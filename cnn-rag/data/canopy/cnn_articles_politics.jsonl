Kristi Noem as a \u201cterrific person\u201d when asked in an interview about the backflash she received over\u00a0revelations in her new book that she shot and killed\u00a0her 14-month-old dog. \u201cShe had a bad week. We all have bad weeks,\u201d Trump told radio hosts Clay Travis and Buck Sexton in an interview that aired Tuesday. \u201cCouple of rough stories, there\u2019s no question about it,\u201d the former president said.\u00a0\u201cUntil this week, she was doing incredibly well. And she got hit hard and sometimes you do books and you have some guy writing a book and you maybe don\u2019t read it as carefully, you know. You have ghost writers do it, they help you, and they, in this case, didn\u2019t help too much.\u201d Noem became the subject of intense criticism for disclosing in her new book, \u201cNo Going Back: The Truth on What\u2019s Wrong with Politics and How We Move America Forward\u201d that she shot and killed her dog, Cricket, because the puppy was \u201cuntrainable,\u201d \u201cdangerous\u201d and \u201cless than worthless \u2026 as a hunting dog.\u201d Noem also said in the book that President Joe Biden\u2019s dog Commander should suffer a similar fate to Cricket. Commander, Biden\u2019s German shepherd, has bitten Secret Service personnel in 24 separate incidents at the White House and other locations, according to CNN\u2019s reporting from February. The dog was\u00a0removed from the White House\u00a0in October. Controversy over the book also extended to other disclosures. For example, Noem falsely claimed that she once met North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un. The book\u2019s publisher announced earlier this month that the relevant passage would be removed in reprints. CNN previously reported that Noem had already fallen off Trump\u2019s vice presidential candidate shortlist long before the latest controversy began. Still, Noem is slated to attend a Tuesday fundraiser for Trump in Manhattan, which will include others said to be under running mate consideration. Trump\u2019s praise also comes amid escalating tensions between Noem and tribal leaders in South Dakota over her previous remarks about Native American communities. After Trump\u2019s interview aired, Biden campaign spokesperson James Singer said in a statement, \u201cAt the Biden campaign, we are proudly anti-puppy-killing and don\u2019t think those who murder puppies are \u2018terrific.\u2019\u201d This story and headline have been updated.

Giuliani is among a group of former President Donald Trump\u2019s allies indicted last month in Arizona alongside the 11 individuals who acted as fake GOP electors from the state in the last presidential election. But the former New York City mayor and one-time attorney for Trump is the only defendant prosecutors have been unable to serve with a summons, according to Richie Taylor, a spokesperson for the Arizona attorney general\u2019s office. The summons is a formal notice that Giuliani has been criminally charged and must appear before a judge on May 21. CNN has reached out to a spokesman for Giuliani for comment. A team of prosecutors and investigators working for Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes, a Democrat, has made multiple attempts to locate Giuliani, Taylor told CNN. The day after the state-level grand jury handed up its indictment, two agents for the attorney general\u2019s office traveled to New York City with plans to hand-deliver the notice to Giuliani, Taylor said. The agents believed Giuliani was likely in his New York City apartment because he had recently video streamed from there \u2013 which they determined by matching the setting of the feed with pictures of the interior of the residence from an old real estate listing. But upon arriving at the building, a person at the front desk told the agents they were not allowed to accept service of the documents, according to Taylor, who added that the individual did not dispute Giuliani lived there. \u201cWe were not granted access,\u201d Taylor added, confirming details previously reported by the Washington Post. While Trump is not among those charged in Arizona, the details in the indictment suggest he is \u201cUnindicted Coconspirator 1.\u201d \u201cIn Arizona, and the United States, the people elected Joseph Biden as President on November 3, 2020,\u201d the indictment reads. \u201cUnwilling to accept this fact, Defendants and unindicted coconspirators schemed to prevent the lawful transfer of the presidency to keep Unindicted Coconspirator 1 in office against the will of Arizona\u2019s voters.\u201d Trump\u2019s former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, his close adviser Boris Epshteyn, the Republican National Committee\u2019s top lawyer for \u201celection integrity\u201d Christina Bobb and former Trump campaign aide Mike Roman are among those charged in Arizona alongside Giuliani.

{"id": "2024_05_11_politics_presidents-campaigning-what-matters", "text": "When he talks to reporters outside the New York courtroom where he is on trial for falsifying business records, former President Donald Trump usually complains he\u2019d rather be with voters. \u201cThey want to keep me off the campaign trail,\u201d he said on Tuesday, suggesting the trial is part of an election interference conspiracy, for which there is no evidence. It was a similar story last week, when Trump said he should be campaigning in battleground states. \u201cWe\u2019re at a courthouse instead of being in any one of I would say 10 states where I\u2019d like to be right now,\u201d he said to TV cameras that beamed his remarks around the country. Meanwhile, President Joe Biden has been folding trips to Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin and Florida into his schedule. Trump chose not to campaign when court was out of session Wednesday, but he will appear in New Jersey this weekend. Both major candidates obviously perceive value in the act of campaigning \u2014 being on the trail and speaking directly to voters. It\u2019s hard to believe that early American presidents did no personal campaigning whatsoever. They thought it was beneath them and the office they held. I talked to Brendan\u00a0Doherty, a\u00a0professor of political science at the United States Naval Academy and author of the books,\u00a0\u201cThe Rise of the President\u2019s Permanent Campaign\u201d\u00a0and\u00a0\u201cFundraiser in Chief: Presidents and the Politics of Campaign Cash,\u201d about why early presidents stayed off the trail and how this became the permanent campaign. Our conversation, conducted by email, is below: WOLF: Why didn\u2019t early presidents personally campaign? DOHERTY: In the early decades of the republic, presidential candidates adhered to the norm that they should not actively campaign for office. It was seen as unseemly to seek the office to which they hoped to be elected. But that didn\u2019t stop them from finding other ways of communicating with voters. WOLF: How did these early non-campaigning presidents get their message out? DOHERTY: While early presidential candidates didn\u2019t actively campaign, their supporters got the word out on their behalf. Newspapers were openly\u00a0partisan in the early republic, and many of their articles openly praised or criticized various candidates. While candidates did not attend political conventions in the 1800s, supporters made the case for their preferred candidates in ways that drove news coverage. In the late 1800s, some presidential candidates mounted what were called \u201cfront porch campaigns.\u201d They would speak to supporters at or near their homes, and newspapers would cover these speeches and spread their messages across the country. WOLF: What are some key moments in the rise of the current model of campaigning? DOHERTY: In 1866, President Andrew Johnson broke from precedent and actively campaigned in the midterm elections. His travel to give a series of speeches was called the Swing around the Circle, and he was criticized both for actively campaigning and for using inflammatory rhetoric while doing so. Two years later, the House of Representatives impeached Johnson for, among other things, giving these campaign speeches that brought Congress into \u201cdisgrace, ridicule, hatred, contempt, and reproach.\u201d In 1896, Democratic nominee William Jennings Bryan actively campaigned across the country, while the eventual winner, Republican William McKinley, conducted a front porch campaign. In 1932, Franklin Roosevelt became the first presidential candidate to appear at a convention to accept his nomination in person. And in 1948, Harry Truman actively campaigned across the country, giving speeches from the back of a train in what became known as his whistle-stop campaign. WOLF: Who was, in your view, the best natural campaigner who ran for president? What did they do differently? DOHERTY: While it\u2019s hard to pick out a single best campaigner, two who come to mind are John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan. Kennedy actively campaigned in the primary elections in 1960 at a time when leading candidates often skipped active campaigning during the nomination contest. But he wanted to demonstrate his electability to party leaders who might be skeptical that a Catholic could win the White House after the only other Catholic major party nominee had lost in a landslide to Herbert Hoover in 1928. Kennedy was widely seen as charming and eloquent on the stump, and his wins in the Wisconsin and West Virginia primaries helped him win his party\u2019s nomination and then the White House. Reagan channeled his years of performance as an actor and his sense of humor to campaign effectively for the presidency. His voice, his timing, and his telling of stories and jokes to connect with his audiences won him much praise. When questioners implied that being an actor wasn\u2019t adequate preparation to be president, Reagan would respond that he didn\u2019t know how someone could be an effective president who hadn\u2019t been an actor. WOLF: Is active campaigning \u2014 holding rallies and flying from stop to stop \u2014 effective in a country of more than 335 million people? A candidate can only shake so many hands. Plus, most people already lean toward one party or the other. What does putting a candidate on the trail accomplish? DOHERTY: While presidential candidates can only meet a relatively small sliver of the American population \u2014 and, more importantly, of the population of the small number of Electoral College\u00a0battleground states\u00a0that will decide a presidential election \u2014 their campaigning can drive news coverage, which has a multiplier effect when it comes to getting their message out. Political science studies have shown that local news coverage is often more favorable to presidents and presidential candidates than national news coverage is, so candidates campaign in part so that local media outlets will amplify their campaign messages. While it\u2019s increasingly difficult for candidates to grab and hold the public\u2019s attention given our increasingly fragmented media landscape, that certainly doesn\u2019t stop presidential hopefuls from trying. WOLF: I suppose the inverse of candidates who don\u2019t campaign is our current system, in which they only briefly stop campaigning to govern. Why is the permanent campaign a problem, and how could it be fixed? DOHERTY: Modern presidents campaign for themselves and for their fellow party members throughout their term in office. They raise campaign funds and they travel to key electoral states. While presidents used to try not to appear to be overly focused on campaigning too early in their term in office, that\u2019s no longer the case. In the summer of his third year in office, Ronald Reagan refused to tell an interviewer whether or not he would run for another term because he said that he didn\u2019t want everything he did as president to be seen through a political lens. In contrast, Donald Trump filed paperwork establishing his reelection campaign committee on the day in 2017 when he was inaugurated as president, and he held his first reelection fundraiser less than six months later, in June of his first year in office. When presidents begin their explicit campaigning earlier and earlier in their term in office, they are responding to the incentives of our electoral system. But time is the president\u2019s scarcest resource, and time spent campaigning is time not spent doing the important job to which he, and someday she, was elected. For better or worse, there are no readily apparent realistic fixes that could stop a reelection-focused president from campaigning for reelection throughout his term in office. WOLF: If transportation and technology have helped candidates directly reach more and more people, where do you see campaign methods heading next? DOHERTY: Technological advances have helped candidates connect with the American people, from the radio to television, the internet, and now social media. These developments, along with advances in campaigns\u2019 ability to micro-target voters in key states with messages designed to appeal to issues they care about, have led campaigns to shift away from broadcasting appeals in favor of narrow, targeted outreach to potentially persuadable voters. In an era in which so much of what voters do online is tracked and can be used to build profiles of voters\u2019 interests and preferences, I expect that this micro-targeting will become ever more precise, allowing campaigns to tailor increasingly specific messages to the voters they are trying to reach.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/11/politics/presidents-campaigning-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_13_politics_louisiana-bill-abortion-drugs-highly-regulated-medications", "text": "A\u00a0Louisiana bill\u00a0would classify the abortion-inducing drugs misoprostol and mifeprostone as Schedule IV controlled dangerous substances in the state, placing them in the same category as highly regulated drugs such as narcotics and depressants. The amendment that would classify the drugs as Schedule IV substances was added to a\u00a0Senate bill\u00a0that would make it a crime to give abortion medication to a person without their consent. The bill\u2019s sponsor, Republican state Sen. Thomas Pressly, said he proposed the legislation after his sister was given misoprostol against her will. Abortion is already banned in Louisiana with no exceptions for rape or incest. The bill sparked outcry from a group of nearly 270 Louisiana physicians, health care providers and medical students, who signed a letter to Pressly expressing concerns over the reclassification. The letter, obtained by CNN, says in part, \u201cneither mifepristone nor misoprostol have been shown to have any potential for abuse, dependence, public health risk, nor high rates of adverse side effects.\u201d The letter continues that placing the drugs under Schedule IV would create \u201cthe false perception that these are dangerous drugs that require additional regulation\u201d and that they are \u201cwidely prescribed and taken safely.\u201d Pressly rebutted the letter\u2019s claims in a response he shared with CNN: \u201cIf enacted, this legislation would not prohibit misoprostol or even mifepristone from being prescribed or dispensed for legitimate reasons.\u201d \u201cThe doctors I have consulted with feel this provision will not harm healthcare for women,\u201d he continued. In a medication abortion, mifepristone blocks the hormone progesterone, which is needed for a pregnancy to continue. A second drug,\u00a0misoprostol,\u00a0is taken within the next 24 to 48 hours. Misoprostol causes the uterus to contract, creating cramping and bleeding. Approved for use in other conditions, such as preventing stomach ulcers, the drug has been available at pharmacies for decades. The amended bill would make it a felony \u2013 punishable with up to five years in prison and fines of up to $5,000 \u2013 for anyone found in possession of the drugs without a valid prescription. The legislation includes an exemption for pregnant women in possession of mifepristone and misoprostol for their own consumption. Doctors in the state would still be able to prescribe the drugs. In Louisiana, the distribution or possession with intent to distribute Schedule IV drugs\u00a0carries a penalty\u00a0of up to 10 years in prison and fines of up to $15,000. Lawmakers have until June 3\u00a0to give the legislation final approval before sending it to Republican Gov. Jeff Landry for his signature.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/13/politics/louisiana-bill-abortion-drugs-highly-regulated-medications/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_14_politics_new-china-tariffs-biden-trump", "text": "No matter who wins the presidential election in November, American businesses can expect to pay more to import certain foreign-made goods. Former President Donald Trump, who has referred to himself as a \u201cTariff Man,\u201d has called for increasing tariffs on all imports. Meanwhile, President Joe Biden \u2013 who has kept most of Trump\u2019s tariffs in place for the past three-plus years \u2013 said Tuesday that his administration will increase tariffs on some Chinese-produced goods, including electric vehicles, semiconductors and steel. The two presidential candidates are usually far apart on the issues, but a protectionist trade policy is where they find common ground. Tariffs can be politically popular, even though many economists agree they are costly tools that don\u2019t always boost domestic industries as promised. Still, there are major differences to note between Trump\u2019s call for sweeping tariffs and Biden\u2019s more targeted approach. Here\u2019s what voters should know: Trump\u2019s tariffs Starting in 2018, Trump imposed new tariffs of up to 25% on foreign-made washing machines, solar panels, steel and aluminum, as well as many Chinese-made goods, including\u00a0baseball hats, luggage,\u00a0bicycles, TVs and\u00a0sneakers. If he returns to the White House, Trump plans to add to those tariffs by enacting a duty of at least 10% on all imports from all countries, a tariff upward of 60% on all Chinese imports and a 100% tariff on all cars made outside the US. It\u2019s unclear what legal authority the former president would use to implement such widespread tariffs if he wins November\u2019s election. Several economic studies have shown that Trump\u2019s tariffs failed to boost US manufacturing and ultimately cost more jobs than they created. Plus, American importers have borne nearly the full cost of Trump\u2019s tariffs, according to a 2023 study from the\u00a0US International Trade Commission. Americans have paid nearly $236 billion to date for tariffs that Trump imposed on imported solar panels, steel and aluminum and Chinese-made goods,\u00a0according to US Customs and Border Protection.\u00a0More than half of the duties have been collected during the Biden administration. When it came to China, Trump used tariffs as a negotiating tactic, meant to hurt its economy and pressure Beijing to agree to a new deal that addresses unfair trade practices, such as intellectual property theft and forced technology transfers. Business leaders across the US, as well as lawmakers on both sides of the aisle, tend to agree that China\u2019s trade policies need to be addressed. While Trump did get Chinese President Xi Jinping to the negotiating table, some of the commitments China made in an agreement reached in January 2020 never came to fruition. Under what\u2019s known as the Phase One agreement, China agreed to increase its purchases of US goods and agricultural products \u2013 setting a target of buying $200 billion more than it did before the trade war began. But\u00a0China fell well short\u00a0of that pledge. A Phase Two agreement was never reached between the US and China\u00a0under either the Trump or Biden administrations. Biden\u2019s tariffs Unlike Trump\u2019s pledge to implement widespread tariffs, the duties Biden announced Tuesday are focused only on China. As a long-delayed review of Trump\u2019s tariffs on Chinese-made goods comes to an end, the Biden administration has decided to increase some of those existing tariffs. Duty rates will rise on Chinese-produced steel, aluminum, semiconductors, electric vehicles, batteries, solar cells, cranes and some medical products such as syringes and needles. Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin told reporters Tuesday that China opposes \u201cthe unilateral imposition of tariffs which violate (World Trade Organization) rules, and will take all necessary actions to protect its legitimate rights.\u201d Those increased tariffs are in line with Biden\u2019s other economic policies aimed at boosting domestic manufacturing in industries including clean energy and semiconductor chips. Steel and aluminum trade groups and unions welcomed the news after Biden first said in April he was considering a tariff hike on steel during a speech at the United Steelworkers headquarters in Pittsburgh. But some analysts say the move could have little impact on the US steel industry because China accounts for a very small percentage of US steel imports. Biden has faced some political pressure to ramp up protections to fight China\u2019s unfair trade policies. A recent letter from seven Democratic senators from potential swing states including Michigan, Wisconsin, Ohio and Pennsylvania urged Biden to maintain or increase the tariffs that Trump imposed on Chinese goods. \u201cMaintaining the scope and impact of these tariffs benefits American workers, manufacturers, and their communities, and holds China accountable for the country\u2019s continued anti-competitive practices,\u201d the senators wrote.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/14/politics/new-china-tariffs-biden-trump/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_12_politics_biden-lawmakers-congress-israel-ultimatum-weapons-israel", "text": "President Joe Biden is facing backlash from lawmakers in both parties over his ultimatum that a\u00a0major Israeli offensive\u00a0in the city of Rafah would result in a shut-off of some US weapons. Biden\u2019s decision to go public with the ultimatum in an interview with CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett last week was greeted with pointed criticism across the GOP spectrum on Sunday, and vocal concern among Democrats. \u201cOn the one hand, they\u2019re saying too many Palestinian civilians have been killed. With the other hand, they\u2019re depriving us of the precision guided weapons that actually cut down on civilian casualties,\u201d Republican Sen. JD Vance of Ohio told CNN\u2019s Dana Bash on \u201cState of the Union,\u201d though Biden specifically mentioned withholding bombs and artillery shells\u00a0deemed\u00a0by the administration as indiscriminate and imprecise. \u201cSo if you\u2019re worried about Palestinian casualties, the stated policy here actually doesn\u2019t make a ton of sense,\u201d Vance said. The US is also reviewing the potential sale or transfer of other munitions, including Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) kits, to Israel. But these\u00a0transfers are not imminent and would occur in the future, a US official said. The president\u2019s announcement last week amounted to a turning point\u00a0in\u00a0US-Israeli ties\u00a0since\u00a0the seven-month conflict between Israel and Hamas\u00a0began in October.\u00a0Still,\u00a0the president\u2019s aides said the message shouldn\u2019t have been a surprise to their intended recipients in Israel given repeated warnings to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Earlier this month, Biden signed off on a pause of 3,500 bombs to Israel that administration officials feared would be dropped on Rafah \u2014 where Israel has issued evacuation orders for some of the estimated 1.4 million civilians sheltering there as it appears poised to continue its advancement on the southern Gaza city. And last week, Biden told Burnett that if Israel goes into Rafah, \u201cI\u2019m not supplying the weapons that have been used historically to deal with Rafah, to deal with the cities \u2013 that deal with that problem.\u201d Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina called the ultimatum \u201cthe worst decision in the history of the US-Israel relationship.\u201d A frequent White House critic, Graham called on the Biden administration to \u201ckeep the weapons flowing\u201d and sit down with Israel. GOP Sen. Rick Scott of Florida, meanwhile, told Fox News on Sunday that Biden\u2019s decision sends \u201ca horrible message for Israel\u201d and claimed that the president is \u201cunfortunately, now part of the pro-Hamas wing of his party.\u201d But the backlash hasn\u2019t just fallen along party lines. On Friday, a group of 26 House Democrats sent a letter to Biden saying they are \u201cdeeply concerned about the message the Administration is sending to Hamas and other Iranian-backed terrorist proxies by withholding weapons shipments to Israel.\u201d The group of House Democrats, led by Rep. Josh Gottheimer of New Jersey, also requested a briefing from the White House to get more information on Biden\u2019s decision, as well as how and when aid appropriated by Congress for Israel will be delivered. Democratic Rep. Adam Smith of Washington\u00a0state,\u00a0however, highlighted the kinds of weapons being withheld.\u00a0\u201cThe\u00a0president was not as clear on this in the Erin Burnett interview as he should have been,\u201d he said Sunday on Fox News, adding: \u201cAll that has been held back to date are dumb, 2,000-pound bombs because the president feels \u2013 and I think rightly \u2013 they should not be used in Rafah.\u201d Other Democrats have offered more forceful defenses of Biden, who arrived at his ultimatum decision after multiple rounds of phone calls with Netanyahu, starting in mid-February. Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut told Bash in a separate interview on \u201cState of the Union\u201d that Biden was \u201clearning the mistakes of US military campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan.\u201d \u201cWhat we learned in both of those efforts was that you cannot defeat terrorist ideology. You cannot defeat a terrorist movement,\u201d he said. The president, Murphy said, \u201cis telling Israelis we will be partners but you have to understand the pace of civilian casualties, the amount of disaster is, in the long run, going to make Hamas stronger, is going to make it more likely that Israel will be attacked again, and is going to make other terrorist organizations that have designs to attack the United States stronger.\u201d US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Sunday that the US believes Israel has killed more civilians than Hamas terrorists as part of its war in Gaza, and that Israel needs to do more to mitigate civilian deaths. \u201cWhile Israel has processes, procedures, rules, regulations to try to minimize civilian harm, given the impact that this operation, this war in Gaza has had on the civilian population, those have not been applied consistently and effectively,\u201d Blinken said on CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d The Ministry of Health in Gaza\u00a0reported Sunday\u00a0that the number of people killed in the enclave as a result of Israeli military operations has risen above 35,000. State Department report on Israel use of US weapons Last week, the State Department released a report saying it is \u201creasonable to assess\u201d that US weapons have been used by Israeli forces in\u00a0Gaza\u00a0in ways that are \u201cinconsistent\u201d with international humanitarian law but\u00a0stopped short of officially saying Israel violated the law. Democratic Sen. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland told CBS\u2019 Margaret Brennan on \u201cFace the Nation\u201d that \u201cI think there\u2019s enough on the books to be able to point to specific cases and make specific determinations. And on that score, the administration did duck the hard questions.\u201d Pressed if he fears the report helped give political cover to Netanyahu to continue deadly strikes in Israel, Van Hollen said he worries the administration did not provide \u201can unvarnished accounting of the facts and the law.\u201d The report did not find that Israel has withheld humanitarian aid to Gaza in violation of international law, despite conflicting reports. \u201cBy not calling that out flatly and saying that there have been arbitrary restrictions put on it [humanitarian aid], I fear that we have set a very, very low bar, a very low standard for what\u2019s acceptable,\u201d Van Hollen said. \u201cAnd I think that will come back to haunt us.\u201d Murphy said the report \u201ccould have gone further\u201d but added it does \u201caccurately explain the complexity of this. And let\u2019s just also be clear about that. Yes, I believe that there have been some very disastrous decisions on proportionality created by Israeli military.\u201d Democratic Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware, defending Biden from Van Hollen\u2019s criticisms over the State Department report, said. \u201cI think President Biden has taken forceful action \u2013 so much so there\u2019s been a lot of blowback for his recent public statement.\u201d This story has been updated with additional context.

{"id": "2024_05_13_politics_louisiana-congressional-map-supreme-court-filing", "text": "A group of mostly White voters that is challenging Louisiana\u2019s proposed congressional districts called the map \u201cmorally repugnant\u201d in a filing with the Supreme Court on Monday. The high court is considering an emergency appeal over a map drawn by state lawmakers that includes a second majority-Black district in Louisiana\u2019s six-district congressional plan. A conservative-leaning lower court recently ruled against that map, finding that its creation violated the Constitution\u2019s equal protection clause. The second majority-Black district was drawn in response to another court ruling that found an earlier map, which had only one majority-Black district, likely ran afoul of the Voting Rights Act. A federal judge had concluded that the earlier map discriminated against Louisiana\u2019s Black voters, who make up nearly a third of the state\u2019s population but accounted for a majority of voters in just one of the state\u2019s six congressional districts.

Bush died in 2018 at the age of 94. He has survived metastatic brain cancer, liver cancer and a number of health scares, including\u00a0brain surgery\u00a0after a fall in 2019. He entered hospice care in February 2023 after a series of hospital stays and made a rare public appearance to attend his wife\u2019s memorial service back in November. \u201cMy grandmother\u2019s passing was a difficult moment for all of us, including my grandfather,\u201d Jason Carter said Tuesday. But, he added, \u201cThe outpouring of love and support that we, as a family, received from people in this room and from the rest of the world was so remarkable and meaningful to us. And it really turned that whole process into a celebration.\u201d Rosalynn Carter made mental health advocacy one of her key areas of focus as Georgia and America\u2019s first lady. In 1977, Carter made it her signature cause, notably through the creation of the\u00a0President\u2019s Commission on Mental Health. Her efforts resulted in increased research funding, broader treatment access and innovative approaches to mental health care. Jason Carter said that moments with his grandfather over the past year reminded him of the mental illness aspects related to caregiving, another cause his grandmother championed. During the speech, he recounted one conservation with the former president as they watched an Atlanta Braves game together. \u201cI said, \u2018Pa Pa \u2026 people ask me how you\u2019re doing and I say I don\u2019t know.\u2019 And he said, \u2018Well, I don\u2019t know myself.\u2019 And so, he\u2019s still there,\u201d Jason Carter said, laughing. The former president\u2019s health has been the subject of widespread attention in recent years, especially since he entered hospice. Speaking with CBS in February, Jason Carter said his grandfather\u2019s spirit was \u201cas strong as ever.\u201d The former president is widely revered for his championing of human rights. His brokering of the Camp David Accords in 1978 with Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin remains central to his legacy. A peanut farmer and US Navy lieutenant before going into politics, Carter, a Democrat, served one term as governor of Georgia before serving as president of the United States from 1977 to 1981.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/14/politics/jimmy-carter-health-update/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_13_politics_us-israel-rafah-assessment", "text": "The Biden administration has assessed that Israel has amassed enough troops on the edge of the city of Rafah in Gaza to move forward with a full-scale incursion in the coming days, but senior US officials are currently unsure if it has made a final decision to carry out such a move in direct defiance of President Joe Biden, two senior administration officials told CNN. One of the officials also warned that Israel has not come anywhere close to making adequate preparations \u2013 including building infrastructure related to food, hygiene and shelter \u2013 ahead of potentially evacuating more than one million Gazans are who currently reside in Rafah. If Israel were to proceed with a major ground operation into Rafah, it would be going against months of warnings from the US to forego a full-scale offensive into the densely populated city. Biden himself voiced that warning in his most explicit terms yet last week, telling CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett that the US would withhold some additional arms shipments to Israel if they were to take such a step. \u201cThe president was clear that he would not supply certain offensive weapons for such an operation were to occur,\u201d national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters at the White House Monday. \u201cIt has not yet occurred.\u201d As the war enters its eighth month, US officials are increasingly questioning Israel\u2019s approach to the war, including publicly suggesting it is unlikely to achieve its stated aim of destroying Hamas and eliminating its leadership. On Monday, Kurt Campbell, the State Department\u2019s number two official, said there have plainly been tensions between the two countries on \u201cwhat the theory of victory is.\u201d \u201cSometimes when we listen closely to Israeli leaders, they talk about mostly the idea of some sort of sweeping victory on the battlefield, total victory. I don\u2019t think we believe that that is likely or possible,\u201d Campbell said, in a seeming allusion to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s repeated references to a \u201ctotal victory.\u201d \u201cWe view that there has to be more of a political solution. That\u2019s one of the reasons why the president\u2019s team has been so engaged with the surrounding region,\u201d Campbell said at the NATO Youth Summit co-hosted by the Aspen Institute. Going \u201cheadlong into Rafah\u201d could have dire consequences, Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned on Sunday. \u201cIsrael\u2019s on the trajectory, potentially, to inherit an insurgency with many armed Hamas left, or, if it leaves, a vacuum filled by chaos, filled by anarchy and probably refilled by Hamas,\u201d Blinken said Sunday on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d US believes Hamas has been \u2018significantly degraded\u2019 And though the US believes Israel will be unable to completely destroy Hamas, the administration believes Israel has achieved many of its initial war aims. State Department spokesperson Matt Miller said last week that Hamas has been \u201csignificantly degraded.\u201d \u201cYou have seen their ability to launch the kind of attacks that they did\u00a0on October 7\u00a0significantly degraded, if not completely eliminated,\u201d he said. \u201cThey couldn\u2019t launch an attack of that scale today.\u201d \u201cTheir weapons production factories underground have been eliminated. Most of their battalion leadership in the north and in central Gaza has been eliminated. So\u00a0Israel has achieved a great number of its military objectives,\u201d he continued. It remains unclear whether senior Hamas leaders are present in Rafah, but the US is continuing to assist Israel in its mission of trying to eradicate as many senior members as possible, including by providing significant intelligence assistance in trying to track down figures including Yahya Sinwar, Hamas\u2019s leader in Gaza. As Biden continues to call for Israel and Hamas to reach a temporary ceasefire and hostage release agreement, in private, senior US officials have not gone as far as to urge Israel to consider a permanent end to the fighting, according to the senior administration official. However, the Biden administration has been ramping up the pressure on Israel to start focusing much more in earnest on post-war Gaza plans \u2013 so far, to little effect. Israel\u2019s lack of interest on the so-called \u201cday after\u201d plans has been a source of growing frustration for Biden advisers, according to one of the senior administration officials, who went as far as to describe Israel as displaying the attitude of believing that post-war Gaza is somebody else\u2019s problem to figure out. In public and in private, this official said, Israel has offered no clear views on two major questions: post-war governance and who would oversee the strip\u2019s security whenever the war eventually comes to an end. Blinken\u00a0publicly called on Israel to engage more seriously on developing a plan for post-war Gaza over the weekend. So far, the engagement has been sorely lacking, Blinken said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been working for many, many weeks on developing critical plans for security, for governance, for rebuilding. We haven\u2019t seen that come from Israel,\u201d Blinken said on CBS. \u201cWe\u2019ve been working with Arab countries and others on that plan. We need to see that too. We have the same objective as Israel. We want to make sure that Hamas cannot govern Gaza again.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/13/politics/us-israel-rafah-assessment/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "politics"}}

{"id": "2024_05_06_politics_biden-israel-partisan-split-analysis", "text": "President Joe Biden is facing more critical moments this week that will test his fraught relationship with his base over Israel\u2019s war in Gaza and potentially widen the partisan split about the Jewish state that has been building for years. Long before the current conflict, polls showed that sympathies among rank-and-file Democrats have been shifting from Israel toward the Palestinians over roughly the past two decades\u00a0\u2014 a period that coincides with almost unbroken right-leaning governments in Israel, mostly led by current Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Simultaneously, support for Israel over that same long period has markedly increased among rank-and-file Republican voters. As a result, over twice as many Republican as Democratic voters now say they sympathize more with Israel than with the Palestinians, a much bigger gap between the parties than earlier in this century, according to Gallup Organization polling. This widening partisan chasm in the United States suggests that whenever Netanyahu leaves the political stage in Israel, an inescapable part of his legacy will be a leading role in shattering the bipartisan consensus that for decades provided Israel an almost unassailable position in US politics. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that the drivers of the US-Israeli relationship that have accounted for its resilience, its special quality and character over the years, are more under stress than at any point in my government experience or even out of government,\u201d said Aaron David Miller, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace who has advised six secretaries of state on the Mideast. That rising pressure could make Biden the last of his kind: Though the vast majority of Democratic office-holders show no penchant to fundamentally break with Israel, Biden could be the last Democratic president for the foreseeable future who aligns so unreservedly with the nation. He\u2019s expected to make a speech on antisemitism on Tuesday at an event sponsored by the Holocaust Memorial Museum. Meanwhile, Democratic critics of his handling of the war will be watching on Wednesday when his administration is due to report to Congress on whether Israel is using US weapons in accordance with international law and is cooperating with the delivery of humanitarian aid. Biden\u2019s deep personal bond with Israel already makes him a throwback in US politics. In the first half century after Israel\u2019s formation in 1948, it was Democratic presidents such as Harry Truman, Lyndon B. Johnson, Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton who displayed the greatest emotional connection to the Jewish state. Republican presidents including Dwight Eisenhower, Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush also supported Israel but more overtly qualified that support when it conflicted with their other regional goals of preserving access to oil and repelling Soviet influence; Reagan and Bush each at points protested Israeli actions they opposed by temporarily withholding aid. Over roughly the past quarter century this partisan pattern has inverted. Republican Presidents George W. Bush and Donald Trump have identified most thoroughly with Israel, while Clinton (in his second term) and Barack Obama experienced the most disagreements with the Israeli government. Many factors have contributed to this reversal of roles. Bush\u2019s campaign against Islamic extremism after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks encouraged him to place more value on Israel as a regional ally. Growing identification with Israel among US White evangelical Christians, a key GOP constituency, also nudged the party toward greater support for the Jewish state. Conversely, more voters in the Democratic coalition (both racial minorities and liberal Whites) came to see Israel\u2019s treatment of the occupied Palestinian territories as colonial, or even apartheid-type, oppression. While holding the prime minister position in the late 1990s and then again with only brief interruption since 2009, Netanyahu has also played a huge personal role in prompting this American partisan reversal. Netanyahu has pursued staunchly conservative policies within Israel (such as his attempt to weaken the judiciary that triggered massive nationwide protest) and rebuffed pressure from successive Democratic presidents to negotiate an independent Palestinian state. As important, he has aligned with the Republican Party as overtly as any foreign leader has with either political party in modern times. Netanyahu in 2015, for instance, delivered a speech to Congress opposing the Iran nuclear deal at the invitation of House Republicans \u2014 over express objections from Obama. And Netanyahu recently echoed Republican talking points at a news conference when he dismissed the protests about the war on US campuses as simply widespread antisemitism. Against this backdrop, partisan polarization about Israel among American voters was already widening years before the brutal Hamas attack last October and the devastating Israeli response it triggered. One measure is the annual Gallup polls that ask Americans whether they sympathize mostly with Israel or mostly with the Palestinians. In 2001, the share of Republican voters who said they sympathized mostly with Israel exceeded the share of Democrats by only eight percentage points (59% vs. 51%.) By Obama\u2019s second term, Republican partisans were over 20 points more likely than Democrats to say they sympathized mostly with Israel. The gap between the parties in sympathy for Israel expanded under Trump to nearly 40 points, and it has soared to 45 points under Biden \u2014 nearly six times the difference in 2001. In the 2023 and 2024 surveys, Gallup recorded for the first time that the share of Democrats who sympathized mostly with the Palestinians exceeded the share who mostly favored Israel. Another long-running survey series from the Chicago Council on Global Affairs found similar, though not quite as extensive, movement. In 2002, the share of Republicans who said the US should take Israel\u2019s side in the conflict was roughly double the percentage of Democrats; in the latest survey, \u00a0conducted this February, the gap had grown to about 3-to-1. The survey found that the share of Democrats who said the US should align with Israel in the conflict, after falling through the Trump years, rebounded to nearly 1-in-5 in the latest poll, almost exactly its level in the early 2000s. But as many Democrats now say the US should side with the Palestinians \u2013 a view held by just 1-in-50 Democrats in 2002. (That\u2019s also the same share of Republicans today\u00a0 who say the US should side with the Palestinians.) Most Democrats said the US should not take either side in the conflict \u2014 a view shared by only about two-fifths of Republicans. An array of polls this spring show how the war in Gaza has hardened this partisan split. \u00a0Earlier this year, both Quinnipiac University and CBS/YouGov polls found that while about 55% of Republicans wanted the US to send more military aid to Israel, about two-thirds of Democrats did not. Nearly half of Democrats, but only a little over one-fifth of Republicans in the CBS poll, said the US should pressure Israel to stop the fighting. While a slim majority of Republicans expressed confidence in Netanyahu in an April Pew survey, over 7-in-10 Democrats said they had little or no faith in the Israeli leader \u201dto do the right thing.\u201d In the Quinnipiac survey just 5% of Democrats said they had a favorable view of Netanyahu; the number was 11 times as high among Republicans. All of the dividing lines separating the parties are also cleaving the generations. Just 1-in-12 young adults in the Quinnipiac poll said they had a favorable view of Netanyahu and over two-thirds opposed sending more arms to Israel; likewise, in the Pew survey about two-thirds of young adults said they viewed the Israeli government unfavorably. Gallup\u2019s latest poll found that while older adults still mostly favor Israel, a plurality of younger adults now express sympathy for the Palestinians. These shifts in attitudes within the Democratic coalition have only modestly changed behavior among the party\u2019s leading elected officials. Only 37 House Democrats ultimately voted against the recently approved foreign aid package that included over $26 billion in new military assistance to Israel. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, despite an earlier speech criticizing Netanyahu, is reportedly joining with House Speaker Mike Johnson to invite the Israeli leader to address a joint congressional session \u2014 an extraordinary opportunity given how many of Biden\u2019s requests Netanyahu has resisted since the war began. Liberal critics of Israel\u2019s approach to the Palestinians, both before and after the October 7 attacks, largely attribute the widening disconnect between Democratic voters and elected officials to the influence of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, and other pro-Israeli lobbying groups in Washington. Since the Obama presidency, AIPAC has become more aggressive in supporting primary campaigns against Democratic officials critical of Israel; it has pledged to spend $100 million this year to defeat members of Congress who have criticized Israel\u2019s conduct of the war most strongly such as Democratic Reps. Jamaal Bowman of New York and Cori Bush of Missouri. \u201cAIPAC\u2019s enormous financial and political pressure in Washington is the most important factor in slowing down larger numbers of Democratic officials from opposing Israel\u2019s war in Gaza,\u201d said Waleed Shahid, who has held senior positions in multiple liberal organizations and has been active in organizing opposition to the war. \u201cBy targeting Democrats who oppose a blank check of weapons funding to Israel, AIPAC aims to stall an inevitable generational shift within the party.\u201d Yet AIPAC\u2019s influence alone doesn\u2019t explain the distance opening between Democratic voters and officials. Part of the answer, as Shahid suggests, is generational. Biden personifies an older cohort of US political leaders whose image of Israel was formed when it was a lonely outpost of democracy and haven for Holocaust survivors. Ordinary Americans and US political leaders alike in the years of the 1967 and Yom Kippur (1973) wars tended to view Israel, in Miller\u2019s words, as a David barely fending off threatening Goliaths; now, many younger Democrats in particular believe \u201cIsrael is no longer David, it\u2019s Goliath,\u201d and it \u201cis pounding David\u201d in Gaza, Miller said. Older Democratic officials have been less influenced than younger ones by the emergence of that new perspective among their voters. Many observers also note that Biden tends to view foreign policy much as he does domestic politics \u2014 placing enormous confidence in his ability to leverage personal relationships with other leaders. \u201cBiden always says \u2018all foreign policy is an extension of personal relationships,\u2019\u201d said Ben Rhodes, who served as a senior National Security Council adviser while Biden served as Obama\u2019s vice president. \u201cI don\u2019t know how many times I heard him say that.\u201d Biden over the course of the war has more explicitly criticized Netanyahu and the far-right coalition that he is governing with, but he has still rebuffed rising demands within Democratic ranks to penalize Israel for its conduct of the war and resistance to the delivery of humanitarian aid. \u201cWe\u2019re almost at the seventh month of this war, and this administration has been reluctant to impose a single cost or consequence on this Israeli government that normal humans would regard as serious or significant pressure,\u201d said Miller. Instead, Miller added, Biden is still operating primarily from the belief that to achieve his goals in the region \u2014 more humanitarian aid into Gaza, a ceasefire that leads to further hostage releases and eventually a regional accord between Israel and Saudi Arabia \u2014 \u201che cannot do that by creating a sustained public breach with the Israeli prime minister. He needs Israel\u2019s acquiescence if not its active assistance.\u201d Biden allies also believe Israel\u2019s critics within the party are overstating the political risks of his continued support. Though polls show widespread opposition to the war among both young people and Democrats more broadly, they also usually show that those voters prioritize other issues more. \u201cWhile some elements of the party\u2019s activist core are focused on what\u2019s happening in Gaza, most Democrats and most Americans are not,\u201d said long-time Democratic pollster Mark Mellman, president of the Democratic Majority for Israel, a pro-Israeli group. \u201cRather they are seized with other issues \u2014 whether it\u2019s holding down prices or protecting abortion rights or protecting democracy itself. \u201c But as the war persists \u2014 with the wave of campus protests compounding the fractures over the issue in the Democratic coalition \u2014 there are clear signs the party\u2019s center of gravity is moving away from the instinctive support for Israel expressed by older Democrats such as Biden and Schumer. The telltale sign is not the escalating outrage over the war from liberals long critical of Netanyahu and far-right Israeli governments, such as Sen. Bernie Sanders and members of \u201cthe squad\u201d in the House. Rather the key measure is the willingness of ambitious mid-career Democrats closer to the party center to criticize Israel\u2019s conduct of the war more openly and to indicate support for limiting the future transfer of offensive weapons; the list of Democrats in that camp include Sens. Chris Murphy of Connecticut, Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, Chris Coons of Delaware and Tim Kaine of Virginia. Biden only agreed to deliver the report due Wednesday on Israel\u2019s use of US weapons and cooperation with international aid after pressure from a group of about 20 Democratic senators led by Van Hollen. Though almost all Democratic senators voted for the recent military aid package for Israel, Biden risks alienating many who supported the assistance if Wednesday\u2019s report to Congress does not seriously address whether Israel should be penalized for its actions in the war, said Amanda Klasing, the national director of government relations and advocacy for Amnesty International. Amnesty recently issued a report charging that Israel has targeted civilians with US weapons in violation of international law. \u201cBiden has a Democratic caucus that is putting a lot of faith in this process,\u201d she said. \u201cThey have taken these votes under the assumption that these conditions will be applied by the administration.\u201d The Israeli prime minister\u2019s personal relationship with Trump is prickly, but Netanyahu\u2019s hardline approach toward both the Palestinians and Iran has encouraged the GOP\u2019s transformation into what Miller calls \u201cthe Israel can do no wrong party.\u201d If Israel elects a more centrist government in the future, Miller believes, the widening US partisan divide over Israel could narrow. But given the alienation about Israeli actions among Democratic partisans in general \u2014 and younger voters in particular \u2014 it seems virtually guaranteed that Democratic elected officials in the years ahead will face greater pressure than Republicans to maintain a critical distance from Israel. So far, Biden has been much more inclined to resist than respond to that pressure. A ceasefire could diffuse that pressure for a time. But even Biden may not be able to ignore the inevitable backlash among Democrats if Netanyahu, with or without a cease fire, eventually fulfills his pledge to launch a ground invasion of Rafah. The fierce Israeli response to the terrorist attacks of October 7 may leave in rubble not just much of Gaza, but the US tradition of bipartisan support for Israel.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/06/politics/biden-israel-partisan-split-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_13_politics_takeaways-michael-cohen-testimony-donald-trump-day-16", "text": "Michael Cohen implicated his former boss Donald Trump in the hush money scheme to pay Stormy Daniels just days before the 2016 election, saying he doled out $130,000 at Trump\u2019s direction and was promised reimbursement. Cohen\u2019s testimony ties together the prosecution\u2019s allegations that Trump broke the law by falsifying business records to reimburse Cohen and conceal the hush money payment that Cohen said he made at Trump\u2019s direction. Trump has pleaded not guilty and denies having an affair with Daniels. Cohen and Trump mostly avoided eye contact while he testified Monday. Cohen looked directly at prosecutor Susan Hoffinger throughout most of his testimony, occasionally scanning the room or looking in the jury\u2019s direction. Trump spent long stretches of Cohen\u2019s questioning with his eyes closed or thumbing through a stack of news stories. Trump\u2019s attorneys are likely to get their chance to question Cohen on Tuesday. Trump attorney Todd Blanche is expected to try to shred Cohen\u2019s credibility with the jury during cross-examination by painting him as a convicted perjurer who has changed his story more than once. Here are the takeaways from Day 16 of the Trump hush money trial: Cohen ties Trump to the Daniels hush money payment Through roughly five hours of testimony Monday, Cohen walked jurors through how he worked with former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker on Trump\u2019s behalf during the 2016 campaign to kill negative stories; how he kept Trump apprised of his hush money negotiations with Keith Davidson, the attorney for Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal; and how Trump approved and was aware of how Cohen would be falsely repaid in 2017 for the Daniels payment as legal services. Cohen is the glue that brings together the other witnesses the jurors have heard from so far, connected through text message email and phone calls to Pecker, Davidson, Dylan Howard, Hope Hicks and others who were allegedly involved with the hush money payments. Cohen described his conversations with Trump during the Daniels hush money negotiations, which prosecutors backed up using Cohen\u2019s phone records to show when the two had spoken. He also connected the payment to Trump\u2019s campaign. \u201cI had to get this done,\u201d Cohen said on the stand.\u00a0 \u201cThis would be catastrophic to the campaign.\u201d After Cohen and Davidson agreed to a $130,000 settlement payment on October 11, 2016, Cohen said he tried to drag out the process until after the election at Trump\u2019s direction \u2013 claiming he would need 10 days to get the money together and noting that the office was closed on Yom Kippur. Hoffinger asked why Cohen did that. \u201cBecause after the election, it wouldn\u2019t matter,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cAccording to who?\u201d Hoffinger asked. \u201cMr. Trump,\u201d Cohen said. Daniels got fed up with the delays, leading to Davidson briefly canceling the settlement agreement, before they renewed the deal at the end of October. The day before Cohen wired the money, he had two calls with Trump the morning in which he said he told Trump he was going to open the account for the LLC that would wire the money to Daniels. \u201cI wanted to ensure that once again he approved what I was doing because I require approval from him on all of this,\u201d Cohen said. Hoffinger asked whether Cohen would have gone to the bank without Trump\u2019s approval. \u201cNo,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cEverything required Mr. Trump\u2019s sign-off; on top of that, I wanted the money back.\u201d Cohen described how he lied on his bank statements \u2013 lies that led to federal charges against him in 2018 \u2013 by saying that Essential Consultants LLC was being used for real estate consulting. When asked whether his bank would have opened the account had he been truthful, Cohen said, \u201cI believe that they probably would not.\u201d Cohen ties the hush money reimbursement to Trump, too Trump is charged with 34 counts of falsifying business records \u2013 11 invoices, 12 vouchers and 11 checks \u2013 records that prosecutors say stem from the monthly reimbursements Cohen received in 2017 for the hush money payment he made to Daniels. On Monday, jurors heard through Cohen for the first time evidence directly connecting Trump to those reimbursements. Cohen described how he was furious in December 2016 when his annual Christmas bonus had been cut by two-thirds. He said he immediately went to Trump\u2019s then-chief financial officer, Allen Weisselberg, \u201cand in some colorful language expressed to him how truly pissed off and angry I really was. This makes no sense at all.\u201d \u201cI was even for myself unusually angry,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cI used quite a few expletives.\u201d After the new year, Cohen said he went to Weisselberg about getting repaid for the $130,000 payment. \u201cLet\u2019s do it,\u201d he said Weisselberg told him. The jury was then shown Cohen\u2019s First Republic bank statement, which showed the $130,000 settlement payment and Weisselberg\u2019s handwriting detailing how Cohen should be repaid $420,000. Cohen testified that he saw Weisselberg write on the document, while telling jurors that his money would be \u201cgrossed up\u201d to account for taxes, because he was being paid in monthly installments as income, instead of as a reimbursement. Importantly, Cohen said that after their meeting, he and Weisselberg went to Trump\u2019s office to speak to him about it. Cohen said he was given the title of personal attorney to the president around the same time but wasn\u2019t going to be paid for that title. Hoffinger asked whether he was being paid for future legal services. \u201cThat was what it was designed to be,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cWhat was it actually?\u201d Hoffinger asked. \u201cReimbursement of my money,\u201d Cohen said. Cohen describes being Trump\u2019s protector Cohen, who used to say he\u2019d take a bullet for Trump in the height of their relationship, testified Monday about everything he did to protect his former boss. As Cohen described each media story he killed and nondisclosure agreement he locked down ahead of the 2016 election, it was always in the name of protecting Trump. When it came to the settlement agreement with Daniels, Cohen said he kept control of a document revealing the identities of \u201cDavid Dennison\u201d and \u201cPeggy Peterson\u201d so that he could protect Trump. And he testified that he used the Essential Consultants LLC to facilitate the payment to Daniels \u201cto protect him and to isolate him from the transaction.\u201d Hoffinger asked Cohen whether he would sometimes bully people. Cohen confirmed he would. \u201cThe only thing that was on my mind was to accomplish the task to make him happy,\u201d Cohen said of Trump. Cohen also testified that it\u2019s \u201cfair\u201d to say he was once Trump\u2019s \u201cfixer\u201d and told the jury he\u2019d sometimes lie for Trump \u2013 including to his own wife. Cohen said he opted to front the $130,000 to Daniels from his home equity line of credit\u00a0on his personal property because his wife would\u2019ve noticed the large sum missing from their joint personal bank account. Cohen painted Trump \u2013 whom he often called \u201cboss\u201d \u2013 as a micromanager who insisted he be kept informed of the ongoings of any situation, including the more discreet instances like the nondisclosure agreements with McDougal and Daniels. Cohen admitted he also kept Trump constantly informed because he wanted credit for handling Trump\u2019s matters, whether it was negotiating invoices or suppressing negative media stories. Cohen said he always wanted Trump to know situations were handled and he wanted \u201cto get credit for accomplishing the task.\u201d No fireworks in Trump, Cohen showdown Unlike his typical public persona, the jury saw a subdued Cohen who gave slow and deliberate answers on direct examination. Cohen rarely looked over at Trump sitting at the defense table, training his eyes mostly on the prosecutor questioning him. And aside from reviewing some documents and passing a few notes to his attorneys, Trump spent the majority of the day with his eyes closed.\u00a0The former president glanced up at Cohen a few times, but there was never an obvious moment of eye contact. Cohen did prompt a few headshakes of what looked like disapproval from Trump, including when Cohen mentioned Trump\u2019s wife, Melania. Cohen claimed Trump wasn\u2019t worried about his wife\u2019s feelings when the infamous \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape went public before the election \u2013 testimony contrary to what former Trump aides Hicks and Madeleine Westerhout told the jury. He testified, \u201c\u2018Don\u2019t worry, he goes, \u2018How long do you think I\u2019ll be on the market for? Not long.\u2019 He wasn\u2019t thinking about Melania. This was all about the campaign.\u201d At one point, it seemed like Trump had heard enough of Cohen\u2019s devoted-employee story, shaking his head with a pursed-lipped smile when Cohen testified that he used a shell company to pay Daniels to protect Trump. Trump shook his head with a sarcastic smile when Cohen admitted he was disappointed he wasn\u2019t considered for chief of staff when Trump took office. Trump\u2019s entourage grows for Cohen\u2019s testimony Throughout the four weeks of the trial, Trump has looked to having supporters at court \u2013 both on the streets outside of the Manhattan courthouse and within the confines of Judge Juan Merchan\u2019s courtroom \u2013 and has complained about not having more support. Last week, Trump\u2019s son Eric Trump; his senior campaign adviser, Susie Wiles; and Sen. Rick Scott of Florida all appeared in the gallery behind the former president. On Monday, Trump had his biggest entourage of GOP lawmakers yet \u2013 including potential vice presidential hopefuls. Sens. J.D. Vance of Ohio and Tommy Tuberville of Alabama were in court, as was New York Rep. Nicole Malliotakis from Trump-friendly Staten Island, and the attorneys general of Alabama and Iowa. They joined Trump for the high-profile Cohen testimony, sitting in the gallery behind the former president at the defendant\u2019s table. Eric Trump and attorney Alina Habba were also there to support Trump. The Republican politicians stood behind Trump while he gave his new conference before entering the courtroom Monday morning. And after the first break of the morning, they went outside to give their own account to the cameras to denounce the proceedings they had just witnessed.

{"id": "2024_05_13_politics_justice-department-ai-sentences-election-crimes", "text": "Federal prosecutors will pursue tougher sentences in cases in which artificial intelligence is used to commit an election-related crime, including threatening violence against election workers and voter suppression, Deputy US Attorney General Lisa Monaco said Monday. The Justice Department policy change is an effort to keep pace with a chaotic information environment ahead of the\u00a02024 presidential election, as AI tools have made it much easier to mimic politicians\u2019 voices and likenesses to spread false information. The new policy applies to cases in which AI makes the election-related crime \u201cmore dangerous and more impactful,\u201d Monaco said. \u201cOur democratic process and the public servants who protect it have been under attack like never before as threats evolve and spread,\u201d Monaco told a meeting of the Justice Department\u2019s Election Threats Task Force on Monday afternoon. AI and other advances in technology are \u201cemboldening those threatening election workers and the integrity of our elections,\u201d she said. The emergence in recent years of AI-driven software programs that can produce deepfakes, or fake audio or video, has complicated the threat environment for election workers and the federal and state officials trying to protect them. US officials focused on election security are concerned that AI tools will exacerbate this already-fraught threat environment, pointing to an incident during the Democratic primary in New Hampshire in January as an example. An AI-made robocall imitating President Joe Biden targeted thousands of New Hampshire voters, urging them not to vote in the primary.\u00a0A New Orleans magician made the robocall at the behest of a political consultant working for Minnesota Rep. Dean Phillips, a long-shot Democratic challenger to Biden, the\u00a0magician told CNN. Federal officials have also been mapping out ways in which foreign powers might try something similar to the fake Biden robocall to try to influence voters. Senior officials from the Biden administration in December\u00a0drilled\u00a0for a hypothetical scenario in which Chinese operatives\u00a0created an AI-generated video showing a Senate candidate destroying ballots. The Justice Department is already under pressure from election officials to do more to investigate the flood of harassing phone calls and emails they have received in recent years. Many of those threats have been made without AI tools and by people who falsely believe there was widespread fraud in the 2020 election. An Ohio man was sentenced in March to over two years in prison for making death threats to an Arizona election official, whom he accused of committing fraud. The danger is persistent. Thirty-eight percent of more than 900 local election officials surveyed in February and March by the nonprofit Brennan Center for Justice reported experiencing threats, harassment or abuse. More than half of the election officials surveyed expressed concern for the safety of their colleagues and staff. \u201cElection offices across the country continue to deal with threats and harassment for doing their jobs, and in many places, this behavior has been nearly nonstop since mid-2020,\u201d Amy Cohen, the executive director of the National Association of State Election Directors, told CNN. \u201cThis should be unacceptable to all Americans.\u201d Election offices have in recent years been working more closely with state and local law enforcement on personal safety training and \u201cphysical security best practices to help staff stay safe,\u201d Cohen said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/13/politics/justice-department-ai-sentences-election-crimes/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "politics"}}

US District Judge Carl Nichols, who presided over Bannon\u2019s trial, had paused Bannon\u2019s sentence while an appeal of his conviction played out. He has given Bannon until Thursday to respond to the DOJ\u2019s request. Bannon was found guilty in July 2022 by a federal jury of two counts of contempt of Congress for defying a subpoena by the House January 6 select committee in its investigation into the 2021 attack on the US Capitol. The Justice Department said in its court filing that a person who is found guilty must report for their term of imprisonment unless the defendant can establish \u201cthe appeal is not for the purpose of delay and raises a substantial question of law or fact likely to result in reversal.\u201d \u201cThe D.C.

{"id": "2024_05_14_politics_trump-allies-courthouse-appearances", "text": "Several of Donald Trump\u2019s allies are flocking to the Manhattan criminal courthouse where Trump is on trial to display their support for the former president as explosive testimony unfolds about his alleged sexual encounter with an adult film actress and the hush money payment made to keep it under wraps before the 2016 election. On Tuesday, House Speaker Mike Johnson, who has increasingly aligned himself with the former president amid blowback he\u2019s received from the far right, will become the highest ranking Republican and latest Trump ally to make the trip, per a GOP source. The politicians coming to Trump\u2019s defense are attacking the people Trump is barred from publicly speaking about under his gag order, including the prosecution\u2019s star witness Michael Cohen, whose testimony began Monday. Their presence at the courthouse also allows them to show their loyalty \u2014 a trait highly valued and rewarded by the former president \u2014 and gives them a high-profile platform to angle for a potential administration position should Trump win another term. Also on Tuesday, North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, who is under consideration to be Trump\u2019s potential running mate, will join the former president in court, according to a Trump campaign official, as well as Florida Rep. Byron Donalds, Florida Rep. Cory Mills and former GOP presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy. Their court visits come after Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance, another potential vice presidential pick, and Alabama Sen. Tommy Tuberville joined Trump in the courtroom on Monday. Both Vance and Tuberville spoke to reporters outside of the courthouse and attacked Cohen, trying to undermine his\u00a0credibility during his first day of testimony. \u201cDoes any reasonable, sensible person believe anything that Michael Cohen says?\u201d Vance told reporters outside of the criminal courthouse moments before Tuberville panned Cohen\u2019s testimony as \u201can acting scene\u201d and said he was a \u201cserial liar.\u201d In addition to Vance and Tuberville, New York Rep. Nicole Malliotakis, Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall and Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird also appeared in court with Trump on Monday and spoke to reporters outside the courthouse. Florida Sen. Rick Scott joined Trump in court last week, and Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton made the trip the week before. Eric Trump has appeared with his father at the trial, and several of the former president\u2019s top advisers regularly accompany him to court. In the weeks ahead, more of Trump\u2019s allies are expected to join Trump in court, according to a Trump campaign official. The official said \u201ca number of\u201d his friends and supporters have reached out to him and the campaign to ask if they could come to the courthouse. \u201cIt\u2019s going to continue, and it\u2019s just a demonstration of how offended so many of our friends are by what\u2019s happening to the president,\u201d the official told CNN. One person familiar with the campaign argued there were no political downsides for the politicians making the trip to the courthouse to rail against the case against Trump, and that it would give them coveted airtime amid the highly publicized trial. \u201cIf there was a safe trial to show up to, this is the one,\u201d this person said. Trump is a defendant in three other criminal cases and faces charges over his alleged mishandling of classified material and his efforts to overturn the 2020 election results. Trump has pleaded not guilty to all 88 charges against him. Mark Serrano, who was a senior adviser to Trump\u2019s 2020 presidential campaign, said in an interview with CNN he thought the gag order Trump is under was one of the main reasons Trump\u2019s allies felt compelled to show up at the trial. \u201cJudge Merchan has taken Donald Trump\u2019s voice away to a degree. He has stripped him of his first amendment rights and people like J.D. Vance and Tommy Tuberville and others are going to come to New York and they\u2019re going to lend their voice to Donald Trump,\u201d Serrano said. Trump has been fined a total of $10,000 for violating the gag order that bars him from publicly discussing witnesses. The violations included comments he made about Cohen, who is a key witness for the prosecution as they make the case Trump illegally falsified business records after paying off adult film actress\u00a0Stormy Daniels as part of an alleged election interference scheme in 2016. Trump has pleaded not guilty to the 34 felony criminal charges\u00a0of falsifying business records in the New York case.

{"id": "2024_04_24_politics_georgia-suburban-shift-2024-election", "text": "Rebel Teahouse is Christine Nguyen\u2019s business. And her happy place. Nguyen, 29, was a neuro ICU nurse, often treating patients who suffered a stroke or had brain cancer. Stressful enough, and then Covid-19 hit. \u201cWe were right there \u2013 frontline,\u201d Nguyen told us in an interview. \u201cThere were all these battles about whether or not we should be vaccinated. \u2026 Seeing all the death didn\u2019t help either.\u201d So Nguyen left her nursing job and became an entrepreneur, opening a boba tea shop in a place that, like her, is in the middle of giant change. \u201cTwo or three years ago, I would definitely be in scrubs. I would be tired,\u201d Nguyen said. \u201cNowadays, if you come into the shop, you will see I am always happy. There is just this different air \u2013 that I feel I can bring something to the community.\u201d Decatur is in DeKalb County, one of the growing Atlanta suburbs that in 2020 rebuked Donald Trump and helped Joe Biden flip Georgia blue and win the White House. Trump\u2019s caustic tone is one source of his suburban struggles; his erratic handling of the Covid-19 pandemic \u2013 things like questioning science and suggesting ingesting bleach might help \u2013 made things worse. \u201cI definitely did not want Trump to win again,\u201d Nguyen said. Yet she couldn\u2019t bring herself to vote for Biden and didn\u2019t vote that year. \u201cBecause he was out of touch with our generation,\u201d Nguyen said. This year, Nguyen says she will vote, and every few months she allows a local voter registration group to set up tables at Rebel. She still has reservations about Biden, including his age and his handling of the Israel-Hamas conflict. But she sees voting as essential. \u201cThe battle that is going on right now with abortion, I think that is something that speaks to me,\u201d Nguyen said. Still, she is undecided because of her qualms about Biden. But she\u2019s not a Trump fan. And looking at Georgia\u2019s 2020 math, she said, \u201cGoing third party, it feels like you are throwing your vote away.\u201d That 2020 margin was just shy of 12,000 votes, so every shift matters here. Our visit was part of a CNN project to track the 2024 campaign through the eyes and experiences of voters who live in the battleground states \u2013 and the communities within them \u2013 that will determine the presidential winner. That Georgia is among them is still a bit of a shock to locals. \u201cI never thought that could happen,\u201d Nguyen said. \u201cI was, like, that\u2019s awesome.\u201d Explaining Georgia\u2019s suburban evolution Jan and Celia Gardner are conservatives and consistent Republican voters living Georgia\u2019s political change. They bought a home in the DeKalb enclave of Dunwoody 27 years ago. \u201cPretty much a conservative community,\u201d is how Jan Gardner remembers it back then. \u201cWe are now a split community.\u201d The Gardners wish Trump would tone down his rhetoric but are loyal Republicans who see Biden as weak and believe the former president would lower taxes and improve border security. Jan Gardner says it is time to move on from debates about the 2020 election results, but he does echo many other Trump grievances. \u201cI don\u2019t think we trust the DOJ,\u201d he said of the Justice Department. \u201cI don\u2019t think we trust the FBI. I don\u2019t think we trust the CIA. We don\u2019t trust most of government. We just don\u2019t.\u201d Their street is trademark suburbia. Neat lawns. Spring flowers in bloom. Trees filling in green. It\u2019s the kind of place people take evening strolls, walk the dogs, watch the kids play. All that, Jan Gardner says, is a constant of the past quarter century. One change: people are much more hesitant to talk politics. Schools come up. Traffic. Local taxes. \u201cThat\u2019s pretty much where it stops,\u201d Jan Gardner said. \u201cYou have a pretty good idea of why.\u201d Jan Gardner is retired. Celia runs a small travel agency. A getting-to-know-you conversation around the kitchen counter is engaging and entertaining. But these days, they said, putting people with different political views in the chairs is too risky. A visitor asks this: Why can\u2019t politics be fun? \u201cIt is as long as everybody\u2019s thinking the same way,\u201d Celia Gardner said. It would be easy to overlook DeKalb County\u2019s role in the 2020 stunner here, because it was at the forefront of Georgia\u2019s demographic and political shift. In the 2000 Census, DeKalb was majority Black \u2013 54% \u2013 and that number was up just a tad 20 years later. Over that time, the percentage of White DeKalb residents dropped a bit, while the Latino and Asian populations grew. What\u2019s really driving America\u2019s suburban shift blue, however, is education level: 36% of DeKalb residents had a bachelor\u2019s degree or higher in 2000; it is now 47%. In the 2000 election, Democrat Al Gore received 70% in DeKalb; in 2020, Biden won 83%. An inclination to vote third-party \u2013 unless it\u2019s close The suburban shift is even more pronounced in Gwinnett County. In 2000, Gwinnett had a population of 588,448 residents; 67% were White and 34% had a bachelor\u2019s degree or higher. George W. Bush won the county with 64%. Now, Gwinnett\u2019s population is approaching 1 million, the White share of the population is down to 32% and the percentage of county residents with at least four years of college is up to 39%. Biden won Gwinnett County with 58%. \u201cI\u2019ve seen a lot of change, a lot more diversity which is good,\u201d said Kim Cavaliere, a school nurse who moved to Gwinnett County two decades ago. \u201cI see a lot of growth. \u2026 Probably too much growth.\u201d Ask Cavaliere to list her big issues, and you get health care, prescription drug costs, abortion rights, opposition to the availability of assault-style rifles. \u201cDemocrat, right,\u201d she said with a laugh. But Cavaliere has lost faith in both national political parties and voted for third-party candidates in both 2016 and 2020. She just might go that route again this November. \u201cI just don\u2019t feel comfortable with Biden\u2019s age and I don\u2019t feel comfortable with Trump\u2019s mouth,\u201d Cavaliere said. Count Cavaliere as among those stunned by the 2020 result here. \u201cI was actually in shock,\u201d she said. Knowing Georgia is now a battleground could influence Cavaliere\u2019s 2024 decision. \u201cHis age is really concerning to me,\u201d she said of the 81-year-old president. Plus, Cavaliere added: \u201cWith Biden comes the vice president that I know nothing about and who hasn\u2019t really done anything honestly that I can be happy with.\u201d Cavaliere speaks nostalgically of the pre-Covid Trump economy but said she could never vote for him because of his erratic behavior as president, culminating with his actions on January 6, 2021. \u201cThe way he talks. The way he runs his mouth and get, you know, people going and different groups going and fighting,\u201d Cavaliere said. She\u2019s still inclined to vote third-party again but is perhaps open to reconsidering if Georgia could settle a close race. \u201cYou have two people and I just don\u2019t have a lot of faith in either one,\u201d she said. \u201cBut as far as being a little more secure, as far as being a little bit more rational \u2013 Biden. \u2026 I might not have a choice.\u201d Carey Fulks wants to keep Georgia blue but he, too, wishes he had a different choice. \u201cFor all of the negative things you can say about the Republicans, at least they have people out there running who seem passionate,\u201d said Fulks, 35. He moved back in with his parents during Covid-19 and is skeptical when he hears Biden describe the economy as booming. \u201cPart-time substitute teacher, part-time DoorDasher, part-time everything, almost,\u201d is how Fulks describes his economy. \u201cAll I could find at the moment. Just taking jobs as they come.\u201d He is back in the Grove Park neighborhood where he grew up, and sees a lot of change here in Atlanta. \u201cWe\u2019re a transient city,\u201d Fulks said. \u201cSo most people who are here aren\u2019t from here.\u201d Biden won 73% of the vote in Fulton County \u2013 Atlanta and the closest suburbs \u2013 and high turnout will again be critical to his Georgia chances. Fulks will be there for the president, though he describes his motivation as \u201cmore against Trump, probably.\u201d Adjusting to the realities of living in a purple state Hall County is about an hour\u2019s drive north of downtown Atlanta, less from most of DeKalb or Gwinnett. It is rural, and reliably red \u2013 Trump won 71% of the county vote in 2020. Matt Vrahiotes fits right in here \u2013 Christian, conservative, Republican. \u201cI try to vote with my Bible, I really do,\u201d Vrahiotes said an an interview. \u201cI try to think: what is the moral thing to do? What is the right thing to do? But it\u2019s been a little harder over the past couple of years to pick a candidate that I think fits what I believe and what I like.\u201d Eight years ago, Vrahiotes and his wife opened Sweet Acre Farms, a fruit winery tucked into the rolling hills of Alto, a tiny town of about 1,000 people. \u201cThe first winery in Hall County since Prohibition,\u201d Vrahiotes said. We spoke just as Trump\u2019s first criminal trial was getting under way \u2013 the New York case related to a hush money payment to an adult film actress. \u201cIt sounds crazy,\u201d Vrahiotes said. \u201cIt sounds like an irresponsible person, an irresponsible thing to do.\u201d He added, though, that he has \u201cthings that are morally in question for both\u201d Biden and Trump. Vrahiotes supported Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in the GOP primaries and wishes someone other than Trump had won. \u201cI\u2019m not a Trumper,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not somebody who\u2019s got the flag in the back of my truck running around and that sort of thing. Honestly, I wish there was another candidate who would have come through the primaries. \u2026 I like to call myself a reasonable Republican.\u201d His issue list leans Republican. But his qualms about Trump have him shopping. \u201cAt this point, I really don\u2019t know,\u201d he said. \u201cKennedy is somebody we could also kind of take into consideration,\u201d he added, referring to independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Again, in a state where every shift matters, Vrahiotes is aware a third-party vote in Hall County could, in the end, help Biden. \u201cBut you also have to vote the way you feel it needs to be voted for,\u201d Vrahiotes said. Whether Vrahiotes will ultimately tell us his choice is an open question, his caution born of two things: Georgia\u2019s newfound battleground status and the political leanings of the customers who fill the winery\u2019s tasting room. \u201cYou really have to be careful about the things that you do and the things that you say,\u201d Vrahiotes said.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s part of being a small business owner. You are in a purple state. You have 50% one way and 50% the other.\u201d Vrahioties did tell us he voted for Trump in 2016. But he declined to say who he voted for in 2020 \u2013 when Georgia\u2019s flip blue made things here a lot more complicated. \u201cAtlanta\u2019s not far from here \u2013 it\u2019s an hour away,\u201d Vrahiotes said. \u201cI literally turn bottles of wine into shoes for my kids and registration for soccer. If I sit here and ostracize 50% of my community, or 50% of my customers \u2026 it could hurt me. It could hurt my business tremendously. Because as of late, people are dividing themselves.

{"id": "2024_05_14_politics_fact-check-biden-inflation-when-he-became-president", "text": "For the second time in less than a week, President Joe Biden falsely claimed Tuesday that the inflation rate was 9% when he began his presidency. Biden was criticized by many Republicans, including former president and current presidential rival Donald Trump, for telling CNN in an interview last Wednesday: \u201cNo president\u2019s had the run we\u2019ve had in terms of creating jobs and bringing down inflation.\u00a0It was 9% percent when I came to office, 9%.\u201d Biden repeated the claim about the inflation rate, albeit in slightly vaguer form, in a Tuesday interview with Yahoo Finance. This time, he said: \u201cI think inflation has gone slightly up. It was at 9% when I came in, and it\u2019s now down around 3%.\u201d Facts First: Biden\u2019s claim that the inflation rate was 9% when he became president is not close to true. The year-over-year inflation rate in January 2021, the month of his inauguration, was about 1.4%. The Biden-era inflation rate did peak at about 9.1% \u2013 but that peak occurred in June 2022, after Biden had been president for more than 16 months. The March 2024 inflation rate, the most recent available rate at the time Biden made these comments, was about 3.5%, up from about 3.2% the month prior. In other words, Biden\u2019s claims make it sound like inflation is much lower today than it was when he was inaugurated \u2013 but it is actually higher, though there has been a steep decline since the June 2022 peak. (That peak followed Russia\u2019s February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, which sparked global increases in energy and food prices.) And while Biden\u2019s claims make it sound like the end of the Trump presidency was plagued by high inflation, inflation was unusually low during Trump\u2019s last months in the White House amid the economic slowdown caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. Similar to a previous false claim Biden\u2019s false claims in the past week about overall inflation are similar to a false claim he made in October 2022 when talking about gas prices in particular. In both cases, he has wrongly depicted a figure from June 2022 as if it was the Biden-era starting point. A White House official said in a Tuesday email to CNN: \u201cThe President was making the point that the factors that caused inflation were in place when he took office.\u00a0The pandemic caused inflation around the world by disrupting our economy and breaking our supply chains.\u201d The April 2024 inflation rate will be revealed Wednesday with the release of new Consumer Price Index data. Separate Producer Price Index data that was released on Tuesday showed the highest wholesale inflation rate in a year. This story has been updated with comment from the White House.

{"id": "2024_05_13_politics_kamala-harris-breaking-barriers", "text": "Vice President Kamala Harris on Monday reflected on her experiences as a barrier-breaking public figure, telling a crowd in blunt terms that sometimes they need to take it upon themselves strive for their own opportunities and successes \u2013 even if others may doubt them. \u201cWe have to know that sometimes people will open the door for you and leave it open,\u201d Harris said in a moderated conversation with actor and comedian Jimmy O. Yang in Washington. \u201cSometimes they won\u2019t \u2013 and then you need to kick that f***ing door down,\u201d she added, to applause and laughter from the crowd. She added, \u201cExcuse my language,\u201d as the crowd continued to laugh and applaud. Harris\u2019 statement came as she marked Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month, reflecting on her experience as the country\u2019s first female, first Black and first Asian American vice president. Harris told Yang that people should never use others\u2019 preconceptions of what they\u2019re capable of to limit their own dreams and desires. \u201cDon\u2019t ever carry, as a personal burden, your capacity to do whatever you dream and aspire to do based on other people\u2019s limited ability to see who can do what,\u201d Harris said. Harris this year has become a key figure for President Joe Biden\u2019s administration and campaign, criss-crossing the country making points that might be more difficult for the president \u2013 an older white man \u2013 to make himself. Her efforts have included serving as the administration\u2019s point person on abortion rights, becoming the first sitting president or vice president to visit an abortion provider and traveling to states such as Florida and Arizona, where new court rulings and laws have thrown into doubt the future of abortion access. Harris on Monday also discussed the administrations efforts to protect the legal right to an abortion, making references to the 2022 Supreme Court decision that overturned Roe v. Wade. \u201cA decision has been made that takes from the American people a fundamental freedom to make decisions about one\u2019s own body,\u201d Harris told Yang. \u201cThink about what that\u2019s taking us back to, that one does not have the right to exercise authority over issues that I call heart and home, issues that are fundamental to what should be a right to decide to start a family or not.\u201d Harris also reflected on efforts to curb gun violence, expressing optimism that young voters, who have borne the brunt of gun violence in schools, will lead the charge in effecting change. \u201cWhen our young leaders start voting in their numbers on so many of these issues, I believe we are going to see a sea change in terms of how we address it, because our young leaders in particular are very practical and they want to see things done \u2013 and what I love about them is they\u2019re not gonna wait for us to figure it out, they\u2019re gonna do it,\u201d she said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/13/politics/kamala-harris-breaking-barriers/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_12_politics_us-officials-warn-rafah-invasion-israel-gaza", "text": "Top American officials offered stark warnings Sunday against an Israeli invasion of Rafah, predicting that a major ground offensive in the southern Gaza city would lead to widespread civilian casualties, spark a Hamas insurgency and create a power vacuum the terror group would later seek to fill. The alarm bells from US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan came after President Joe Biden delivered an ultimatum last week on CNN that an Israeli invasion of Rafah would cause him to pause certain weapons transfers. Blinken and Sullivan both said Biden made the determination because he didn\u2019t want American weapons used in what he estimates would be a bloody, ill-advised operation. At the same time, they sought to rebut claims from Republicans and pro-Israel Democrats that Biden was leaving Israel to fend for itself. And Blinken worked to explain why his agency last week was unable to make a full determination on whether Israel was upholding international law in its campaign against Hamas, a conclusion that drew criticism from human rights groups and some lawmakers. Blinken said on Sunday that the US believes Israel has killed more civilians than Hamas terrorists as part of its war in Gaza, and that Israel needs to do more to mitigate civilian deaths. \u201cWhile Israel has processes, procedures, rules, regulations to try to minimize civilian harm, given the impact that this operation, this war in Gaza has had on the civilian population, those have not been applied consistently and effectively,\u201d Blinken said on CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d The Ministry of Health in Gaza\u00a0reported Sunday\u00a0that the number of people killed in the enclave as a result of Israeli military operations has risen above 35,000. Despite American warnings dating back months about the wisdom of a ground invasion into Rafah, Israel appears poised to continue advancing on the city and has issued evacuation orders for some of the 1.4 million civilians estimated to be sheltering there. Going \u201cheadlong into Rafah\u201d could have dire consequences, Blinken warned Sunday. \u201cIsrael\u2019s on the trajectory, potentially, to inherit an insurgency with many armed Hamas left, or, if it leaves, a vacuum filled by chaos, filled by anarchy and probably refilled by Hamas,\u201d Blinken said Sunday on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d Sullivan, meanwhile, warned an Israel operation would cause \u201creally significant civilian casualties\u201d while still being unlikely to eliminate Hamas. That is partly why Biden determined that American weapons should not be used in a Rafah offensive. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t want to see American weapons used in that kind of operation,\u201d Sullivan said Sunday on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s not to say that he is going to abandon Israel or cut them off from weapons. He was focused on a particular operation that he doesn\u2019t believe will succeed in defeating Hamas and that will cause grievous harm.\u201d Sullivan on Sunday spoke by phone with his Israeli counterpart, Tzachi Hanegbi, and \u201creiterated President Biden\u2019s longstanding concerns over the potential for a major military ground operation into Rafah,\u201d the White House said. \u201cMr. Hanegbi confirmed that Israel is taking US concerns into account,\u201d according to a\u00a0White House readout of the call. Blinken said Israel had resisted American advice for developing a plan for Gaza once the war ends. \u201cWe\u2019ve been working for many, many weeks on developing critical plans for security, for governance, for rebuilding. We haven\u2019t seen that come from Israel, we\u2019ve been working with Arab countries and others on that plan. We need to see that too. We have the same objective as Israel. We want to make sure that Hamas cannot govern Gaza again,\u201d he told CBS. Last week, the State Department released a report finding it is \u201creasonable to assess\u201d that US weapons have been used by Israeli forces in\u00a0Gaza\u00a0in ways that are \u201cinconsistent\u201d with international humanitarian law. But\u00a0the report stopped short of officially saying Israel violated the law. \u201cWe don\u2019t have double standards. We treat Israel, one of our closest allies and partners, just as we would treat any other country,\u201d Blinken said on NBC. Still, he said making such a full determination was impossible amid the war. \u201cThat makes it very difficult to determine, particularly in the midst of war, exactly what happened and to draw any final conclusions from any one incident,\u201d Blinken told CBS. The top US diplomat downplayed a growing rift between Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, even as the relationship endures its tensest moment since  Hamas\u2019 October 7 attacks. \u201cWe are clear-eyed, and we speak the truth to each other as we see it,\u201d Blinken said. \u201cWe have American interests first and foremost in mind. We also have Israel\u2019s interests in mind. And there may be a difference in view and in the best way to achieve them. But that\u2019s also the nature of the relationship.\u201d This story has been updated with additional information.

{"id": "2024_05_09_politics_climate-trump-biden-what-matters", "text": "It is not news that former President Donald Trump wants to hit rewind on President Joe Biden\u2019s climate policy. What is news is how far Trump may go. There\u2019s new reporting in The Washington Post that Trump, during a meeting at Mar-a-Lago, asked oil executives to raise $1 billion for his campaign so that he could upend efforts by Biden to push the US toward clean energy and electric vehicles. While the transactional nature of the pitch, as relayed to the Post, is overt and somewhat shocking, it\u2019s not out of step with Trump\u2019s view of politics or his insistence that climate change is a \u201choax.\u201d For evidence that climate change is not a hoax, read this CNN story about ocean temperatures. Or look at the pictures of hundreds of thousands of dead fish killed by a heat wave in Vietnam. I talked to CNN climate reporter Ella Nilsen about Trump\u2019s plans for a second term and Biden\u2019s record on climate change. Among the interesting things  I learned is that a lot of the money Biden and Democrats have spent to spur manufacturing has gone to red states. What would climate policy look like under Trump? WOLF: The Washington Post reports that Trump is promising oil executives a friendly administration if they raise $1 billion for his campaign. Politico reports the oil industry is crafting executive orders Trump could sign on day one. Trump has promised \u2013 in his \u201cdictator for a day\u201d fantasy \u2013 to act on immigration and energy production first. What do we know about how different US energy policy would be under Trump? NILSEN: In his first term, Trump overturned more than 100 environmental rules and actions put in place by the Obama administration. Biden\u2019s administration has spent much of its tenure undoing Trump\u2019s actions \u2013 in some places enacting even stronger regulations on planet-warming pollution coming from\u00a0vehicles,\u00a0power plants and the\u00a0oil and gas\u00a0industry. Trump has vowed to again reverse course from Biden; he wants to give a boost to fossil fuels and oil and gas drilling in particular. A mixed view of Biden WOLF: For all their rhetorical differences on climate, it\u2019s not like the US has cut oil production under Biden. In fact, the US remains the No. 1 world oil producer by a long shot. How do climate activists rate the current administration? NILSEN: Climate activists have a mixed view of Biden. On the one hand, he delivered on the most\u00a0ambitious piece\u00a0of climate legislation in modern history. His administration has also finalized some pretty ambitious regulations cutting planet-warming pollution, conserved a lot of public lands and created an American Climate Corps \u2013 a key demand of activists. On the other hand, the administration greenlit\u00a0the massive new oil drilling project\u00a0in Alaska known as Willow, which galvanized a huge amount of opposition from youth climate groups and on social media. Youth climate groups want Biden\u00a0to use executive authority\u00a0to stop drilling for fossil fuels \u2013 something that likely won\u2019t happen as\u00a0oil and gas production booms\u00a0in the US. Are we seeing payoff for all that climate spending Democrats enacted under Biden? WOLF: The money for climate in the  Inflation Reduction Act, which was backed by Democrats only, was sold as the largest-ever investment in clean energy and climate policy. Are we seeing it pay off? NILSEN: Yes, so far. The IRA has already spurred hundreds of billions of dollars of investment in new US manufacturing, largely for clean-energy industries like EVs, battery plants, and solar and wind production. A lot of this funding has been clustered in red states, but other 2024 swing states like Michigan, Arizona and Georgia have been big benefactors. Why is the funding clustered in red states? WOLF: Is that a political move, or does it just have to do with the fact that it gets windy in Texas? NILSEN: You\u2019re right, it\u2019s very windy in a lot of red states \u2013 red states like Texas, Oklahoma, Iowa and South Dakota are big wind-energy producers and consumers. But there are other reasons too. For instance, it\u2019s easier to permit and build in some red states, and others have relaxed union labor laws, another factor that draws big businesses. A third of US emissions are from one sector WOLF: I\u2019ve been seeing a lot of stories about a backlash to EVs. Trump falsely says Biden wants to ban gas-powered vehicles. How big a part does a transition to EVs play in addressing climate change? NILSEN: The vehicles we drive play a huge role in addressing climate change. Transportation emissions account for a little less than a third of total US emissions \u2013 the biggest individual sector for greenhouse gas pollution. Even accounting for mining for the critical minerals needed for EV batteries, EVs\u00a0are much cleaner\u00a0than gas-powered vehicles \u2013 assuming the power used to charge them is also coming from clean sources. Can states pick up the slack if the federal government turns on climate policy? WOLF: Even before Biden took office, states like California were taking the lead in a more climate-focused energy policy. Would that continue even if Trump wins? NILSEN: Yes, blue states like California and Washington state and even some Midwestern, purple states like Michigan and Minnesota have passed some very ambitious climate laws through their legislatures. That work will continue in the states even if Trump is elected. But given how quickly we\u2019re running out of time to get the planet\u2019s warming under control, it will be important to have the federal government moving in that direction as well. What is happening in Congress? WOLF: Better than presidents taking executive action or the Environmental Protection Agency writing a regulation to address the climate would be lawmakers passing a major piece of climate legislation. Are there any indications of movement toward a new national energy policy? NILSEN: Lawmakers passing the IRA was a huge achievement in its own right; however, multiple lawmakers have said the IRA was just the start. Given the 2017 Trump tax cuts are expiring soon, and Congress will have to take up tax policy in 2025, there\u2019s already chatter about a possible carbon tax, or a carbon tariff on polluting products like cement and steel, coming up in the legislature. Of course, what\u2019s possible in Congress depends tremendously on which party is in power \u2013 and who is in the White House.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/09/politics/climate-trump-biden-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_13_politics_bob-menendez-what-to-know-trial", "text": "A sitting US senator faces a weekslong trial over charges of taking bribes including gold bars, cash and a luxury car to, among other things, help push US aid and weapons to a foreign government and stop a federal case against one of his co-defendants. Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez of New Jersey, who faces 16 charges including conspiracy to commit bribery and conspiracy to obstruct justice, has rejected calls to resign and, while he won\u2019t run in the state\u2019s primary for his seat, has left open the possibility for an independent run following his trial. The senator told CNN\u2019s Manu Raju on Capitol Hill last week, \u201cI am\u00a0looking forward to proving my innocence,\u201d when asked repeatedly whether he would resign in the face of a potential conviction. Prosecutors say Menendez and his wife, Nadine, helped several New Jersey businessmen \u2013 all of whom were charged in the conspiracy \u2013 obtain lucrative contracts with Egyptian and Qatari officials and attempted to pressure authorities to stop investigations into the businessmen and their associates. Jury selection in the trial continues Tuesday after more than 30 of 150 potential jurors were dismissed Monday following questioning by presiding judge Sidney Stein over scheduling conflicts or hardships they may have in sitting for a four-to-six-week trial. The defense teams, which include Menendez\u2019s co-defendants, New Jersey businessmen Wael Hana and Fred Daibes, recently hired a consulting firm to assist in the jury selection and other matters, a source familiar with the matter told CNN. When the potential jurors return Tuesday, they will face questions from Stein over their knowledge of the case to root out any bias that would distort their opinions of the case or evidence presented at trial. Stein, a Clinton appointee, has not yet ruled on proposed jury questionnaires. Defense attorneys have suggested asking the jury pool a myriad of questions, including whether they think someone from New Jersey is \u201cmore likely to break the law.\u201d Menendez is being tried with two of his co-defendants: Hana, an Egyptian American businessman, and Daibes, a New Jersey real estate developer. The senator\u2019s wife faces trial in July. Here\u2019s what to know: Foreign entanglements According to the indictment, Hana and Nadine Menendez \u2013 who were friends for years before she started dating the senator in 2018 \u2013 worked together to connect the senator with several Egyptian officials to help secure US military aid as well as an exclusive contract with Hana\u2019s company. The contract, prosecutors say, made Hana\u2019s company the only business able to certify US food exports to Egypt as compliant with halal standards. Menendez, who at the time held senior positions on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, a post with power over foreign military sales, met several times with Hana\u2019s contacts in the Egyptian military and helped steer US military sales and aid to the country, according to prosecutors. The indictment also alleges Menendez ghostwrote a letter on behalf of the Egyptian government attempting to persuade other senators to lift a hold on $300 million in aid. In addition to his alleged agreement to use his position to facilitate military sales and financing to Egypt, Menendez also passed along sensitive information to his wife about who was serving at the US Embassy in Cairo, prosecutors say. His wife, in turn, sent the information to Hana, who forwarded it to an Egyptian government official. The senator also allegedly pressured an official at the Department of Agriculture to protect the halal certification monopoly Hana had secured with Egypt for his company, through which his wife was allegedly being paid for Menendez\u2019s efforts. Menendez\u2019s entanglements with foreign governments extended to Qatari officials, prosecutors say. In exchange for gold bars, whose price Menendez searched online several times, and other items, Menendez helped his co-defendant Daibes secure a multimillion-dollar investment from Qatari officials in a real estate project, according to prosecutors. New Jersey investigations Using his power as senator, prosecutors say Menendez attempted to influence several cases in New Jersey involving his co-defendants, including by talking with a top prosecutor on one case and by working to recommend a candidate for the job of New Jersey\u2019s US attorney, who Menendez believed would help quash a case against Daibes. For Menendez\u2019s efforts in pressuring an official in one case, New Jersey businessman Jose Uribe and Hana bought Nadine a luxury car, prosecutors say. In May, Uribe pleaded guilty to seven counts related to the bribery scheme involving Menendez and his co-defendants and agreed to cooperate with federal prosecutors in the case, including by testifying at the trial. Ultimately, according to the indictment, Menendez\u2019s influence campaigns were unsuccessful. The New Jersey case against Daibes is ongoing. Alleged cover-up According to prosecutors, after search warrants were executed on the Menendezes\u2019 home \u2013 where gold bars and hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash were found \u2013 and elsewhere, the senator and his wife attempted to cover up the bribes by paying back the businessmen for the mortgage and luxury car, claiming they were merely loans. The indictment states that lawyers for the two told prosecutors \u2013 relying on statements from the married couple \u2013 that the bribe payments were actually loans. Menendez allegedly had his attorney at the time say he was originally unaware of the mortgage and car payments, which prosecutors say is false. The couple has been charged with obstructing justice. Menendez\u2019s defense Attorneys for Menendez have hinted at several possible defenses they may bring during trial, including that the 13 gold bars and $480,000 in cash investigators found in his home could be explained by intergenerational family trauma as well as a psychological disorder stemming in part from his father\u2019s suicide. Shortly after he was indicted on bribery charges last year, Menendez told reporters he had withdrawn thousands of dollars in cash over the course of 30 years, citing \u201cthe history of my family facing confiscation in Cuba.\u201d The family trauma and death of his father, defense attorneys say, led to a fear of scarcity through which Menendez developed \u201cseemingly unusual\u201d coping mechanisms. Menendez may also attempt to lay the blame for the alleged conspiracy on his wife, Nadine, whose trial was delayed due to a medical issue. \u201cSenator Menendez intends to present a defense arguing (in part) that he lacked the requisite knowledge of much of the conduct and statements of his wife, Nadine, and thus lacks scienter and did not agree to join any of the charged conspiracies,\u201d attorneys for Menendez wrote in a court filing.

{"id": "2024_05_14_politics_maryland-senate-election-trone-alsobrooks", "text": "Maryland\u2019s Democratic Senate primary will test the power of self-funding as a congressman who\u2019s loaned his campaign more than $61 million faces off Tuesday against a county executive who could become just the third Black woman elected to the Senate. But the race between three-term Rep. David Trone and Prince George\u2019s County Executive Angela Alsobrooks isn\u2019t just about the future of the Democratic Party in Maryland; it will set up a general election matchup for a seat Democrats cannot afford to lose if they\u2019re to retain their Senate majority this fall. Popular former Gov. Larry Hogan is heavily favored to win the Republican Senate nod on Tuesday. And that would make for a competitive fall campaign to succeed retiring Democratic Sen. Ben Cardin in a state that backed Joe Biden in 2020 by one of the largest margins in the country. With Republicans already poised to pick up a Senate seat in West Virginia, Hogan\u2019s entrance into the Maryland race earlier this year shook up the Senate battlefield. \u201cIt has made all of us Democrats wake up and pay close attention to this race,\u201d Maryland Rep. Jamie Raskin, who has endorsed Alsobrooks, said at a get-out-the-vote event with his fellow Democrat in Silver Spring earlier this month. Trone, the co-owner of Total Wine & More, has argued that he\u2019s best positioned to defeat Hogan and many of his ads have highlighted the GOP threat. \u201cOnly one seat stands between losing a woman\u2019s right to choose,\u201d a recent ad says, \u201cand only one candidate can stop it.\u201d His money is a big part of that pitch, especially with national Democrats needing to defend vulnerable incumbents in tougher states. \u201cWe\u2019re going to continue to spend whatever it takes to win,\u201d Trone told reporters last week when asked if he would invest his own money in a general election. \u201cThat will give them a lot more flexibility to spend money elsewhere. And I\u2019m sure that will appeal to the leader [Chuck] Schumer.\u201d Alsobrooks is touting her record in Prince George\u2019s County, home to one of the state\u2019s biggest concentrations of Democratic voters, while arguing that she\u2019s a stronger messenger on protecting abortion rights.\u00a0Democrats are expected to lean on the abortion issue to warn voters that sending the well-liked Hogan to Washington would only bolster the GOP\u2019s chances of controlling the Senate. Alsobrooks frequently points out that her opponent has donated money to Republicans who have since signed abortion restrictions, and she recently received outside help from EMILY\u2019s List\u2019s super PAC in taking that message to the airwaves. (Trone has said that those were business expenses and that he has donated millions to Democrats.) \u201cI have never compromised my values around the protections that women need and deserve, and he has,\u201d Alsobrooks told CNN. Her authority to speak on the issue as a woman \u2013 of which there are currently none in the 10-person Maryland congressional delegation \u2013 resonates with her supporters, even if they said it wasn\u2019t the only reason they were backing her. \u201cI want a woman to speak for me. I want Angela Alsobrooks to speak for me,\u201d state Del. Jheanelle Wilkins said after the recent early vote event with Alsobrooks in Silver Spring. \u201cNow there isn\u2019t a single woman in the federal delegation. So I\u2019d like to see that happen,\u201d added 82-year-old Walter Thaxton from Prince George\u2019s County. If elected, Alsobrooks would also be the first Black woman that Maryland sends to the Senate \u2014\u00a0a potential accomplishment with national implications since the only current Black female senator, California\u2019s Laphonza Butler, was appointed and is not running for a full term. That unique profile is an electability argument in itself, Alsobrooks\u2019 allies say. \u201cWe believe that she\u2019s the voice that is needed that can coalesce around a state that is a multicultural state,\u201d said Glynda Carr, the president of Higher Heights for America, which works to elect Black women. Early money versus early endorsements Trone\u2019s self-funding of at least $61.77 million has set a record for a Senate primary, and he\u2019s already close to the record that Florida Sen. Rick Scott set for an entire campaign, when he invested about $63.6 million in his 2018 bid, including the general election. That enormous financial advantage has led to a significant ad spending disparity \u2013 Trone has spent about $47.5 million to Alsobrooks\u2019 $4 million. EMILY\u2019s List\u2019s $2.5 million buy for Alsobrooks, launched in the final stretch of the campaign, is a drop in the bucket compared with Trone\u2019s firepower. The total ad spending has made this race the second most expensive Senate primary after California. \u201cThis race is almost an A/B test of how much does paid media matter,\u201d said one Democratic strategist supporting Alsobrooks. Trone\u2019s money has allowed him to dominate the airwaves early, but it\u2019s also powered operational advantages that have helped him reach and turn out voters in senior centers, for example, or those who said they wouldn\u2019t normally show up for political events. \u201cI\u2019m just wondering why I should vote for him over Angela Alsobrooks,\u201d 42-year-old Dorothy, who declined to give her last name, said last week as she arrived at his Women for Trone event in Bowie, noting that she\u2019d received a text from the campaign to show up. After hearing local female elected officials praise him and his commitment to hiring formerly incarcerated individuals, her mind was made up: \u201cI\u2019m going to vote for him.\u201d Trone talks about his self-funding as a way of bolstering his progressive bona fides, arguing that only he can stand up to \u201cspecial interests\u201d such as the NRA and pharmaceutical companies. And that\u2019s connected with some supporters, who draw a distinction between his rags-to-riches story and politicians who have inherited wealth. \u201cI\u2019m glad that he\u2019s spending his own money,\u201d Prince George\u2019s County Council Member Krystal Oriadha said at the Women for Trone event. \u201cPeople funding their own campaigns is not dangerous. Special interests are dangerous.\u201d But the spending \u2013 and Trone\u2019s vow to spend whatever it takes \u2013 has alienated others. \u201cIt is so offensive,\u201d 80-year-old Carolyn Long of Bethesda said at the Alsobrooks event in Silver Spring, arguing that her inability to self-fund makes her more relatable. \u201cThere\u2019s so many White men who are millionaires who are in the Senate, and who are really out of touch with the issues that count, but she\u2019s really in touch,\u201d she said. While Trone\u2019s campaign got on air early, Alsobrooks picked up early endorsements, including from Gov. Wes Moore and every other Democrat in the state\u2019s congressional delegation, except for one House member and Cardin, who\u2019s staying neutral in the race to succeed him. \u201cShe reminds me a lot of Ben Cardin, the outgoing senator, in that she\u2019s really worked her way up through Maryland politics,\u201d said Raskin, who himself overcame Trone\u2019s self-funding in a 2016 House primary. \u201cAnd we\u2019re a state that really likes to get to know our officials. We\u2019re very intimate face to face.\u201d Both candidates lean on surrogates Sonya Snedecor, 50, who was browsing the Silver Spring farmer\u2019s market on a recent weekend, said she only recently realized that the primary was coming up and hadn\u2019t yet decided who she was voting for. What would she look at to make her decision? \u201cProbably The Washington Post.\u201d Even if newspaper endorsements have typically had limited influence, observers say Alsobrooks\u2019 endorsement by the paper\u2019s editorial board could resonate in the highly educated suburbs of Washington, DC, where she needs to run up the score. Mileah Kromer, who runs the Goucher College Poll, believes endorsements from other elected officials could be especially important when there\u2019s not much ideological difference between the candidates. \u201cThat comes with political networks and that comes with door-knockers \u2026 and an information shortcut or a cue on who you should vote for.\u201d But Trone has his own backers \u2013 including House Democratic leadership \u2013 and he\u2019s leaned on surrogates like California Rep. Adam Schiff, who appeared with him in Silver Spring last week for a \u201cDefending Democracy\u201d rally, to tout his congressional experience. Both state Attorney General Anthony Brown and Maryland Rep. Dutch Ruppersberger have cut ads for him. Trone has also highlighted the backing of some local elected officials from Prince George\u2019s County \u2014 especially Black women \u2014 who have appeared in ads attacking Alsobrooks. One of those ads, in which a local politician suggested Alsobrooks would need \u201ctraining wheels\u201d in the Senate, has further injected race and gender into the conversation in a state where Black voters are expected to make up at least 40% of the primary electorate. The Trone campaign removed that comment from the ad, but the candidate repeated it in an interview with a local NBC affiliate, only to deny to CNN last week that he had said those words. Earlier in the race, the congressman apologized for using a racial slur during a congressional hearing, saying that he misspoke. More than 750 Black female leaders have condemned Trone\u2019s attack ads, calling out \u201ctones of misogyny and racism.\u201d \u201cThis attempt to undermine Ms. Alsobrooks\u2019 candidacy is deeply troubling and emblematic of the obstacles Black women face in political spheres,\u201d they wrote in a letter. Asked to respond to voters who think it\u2019s time to send a Black woman to the Senate, Trone told reporters, \u201cI have supported wonderful women and diverse candidates all over this country and will continue to do so.\u201d Despite the increasingly contentious tone at the end of the race, Raskin said he was confident that however the primary turns out, Maryland Democrats will unify against Hogan. \u201cWe have a very politically engaged and sophisticated electorate in Maryland,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople understand that it might be one thing to have, you know, a vaguely moderate Republican governor, but to send a person like that into the Senate is just to put another brick in the wall of the MAGA Republican Party behind Donald Trump.\u201d CNN\u2019s David Wright contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/14/politics/maryland-senate-election-trone-alsobrooks/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_04_10_politics_lara-trump-rnc-2020-election-fraud-claims", "text": "The Republican National Committee last week sent out a scripted call to voters\u2019 phones on behalf of new co-chair Lara Trump saying Democrats committed \u201cmassive fraud\u201d in the 2020 election. It\u2019s the latest example of how the RNC under the former president\u2019s daughter-in-law is perpetuating lies about the 2020 election, even as prominent Republicans say the party needs to look forward to win in 2024. \u201cWe all know the problems. No photo IDs, unsecured ballot drop boxes, mass mailing of ballots, and voter rolls chock full of deceased people and non-citizens are just a few examples of the massive fraud that took place,\u201d the RNC call said. \u201cIf Democrats have their way, your vote could be canceled out by someone who isn\u2019t even an American citizen.\u201d The claim of \u201cmassive fraud\u201d in the 2020 election marks a significant shift in messaging for the RNC because lies about the 2020 election had not been a consistent theme in its messaging since Donald Trump left office. But the call\u2019s message is largely consistent with the views publicly espoused over the past four years by Lara Trump, who was elected as co-chair in early March as part of Donald Trump\u2019s takeover of the GOP. Lara Trump has a long history of echoing his election fraud claims, according to a CNN KFile analysis of her past statements as a commentator and surrogate for the former president. \u201cI\u2019m sure you agree with co-chair Trump that we cannot allow the chaos and questions of the 2020 election to ever happen again,\u201d said the call, which was obtained by CNN\u2019s KFile from the anti-robocall application Nomorobo, which estimated 145,000 calls were sent with the message from April 1-7. It comes amid previous CNN reporting about the RNC asking employees who are reapplying for their jobs whether they believe the 2020 election was stolen in an apparent litmus test for hiring. The RNC denied any such litmus test existed.\u00a0Lara Trump and new chair Michael Whatley succeeded Drew McKissick and Ronna McDaniel, who had earned the ire of the former president because of his dissatisfaction with how the RNC handled claims of fraud around the 2020 election, CNN previously reported. There is no evidence of widespread fraud in the 2020 election, as even some state GOP election officials and former Trump Attorney General William Barr have acknowledged. The former president and his supporters filed more than 60 court cases in six key battleground states following the election and lost every one of them. And, they have still not brought forth any evidence of the rampant cheating they continue to talk about on the campaign trail. But in the years since the 2020 election, Lara Trump has continued to push claims of fraud. Her comments have been in line with those of her father-in-law, who\u2019s successfully reshaped the GOP in his image and easily secured his third-straight GOP nomination this year. Polling, for example, shows that a majority of GOP voters think the 2020 election result was illegitimate. A CNN poll released last September found that 71% of Republicans said President Joe Biden\u2019s \u201cdid not legitimately win enough votes to win the presidency.\u201d From November 2020 to February 2024, Lara Trump propagated the narrative of Democratic cheating in the 2020 presidential election. And even after she was elected co-chair and said claims of a stolen election are \u201cin the past,\u201d she didn\u2019t repudiate those baseless accusations. \u201cWell, I think we\u2019re past that. I think that\u2019s in the past. We learned a lot. Certainly, we took a lot of notes,\u201d Trump said in an NBC interview when asked whether claims of a stolen 2020 election would be the official position of the RNC in 2024. She went on to tout lawsuits across 23 states \u201cto ensure that it is harder to cheat and easier to vote,\u201d while raising questions about pandemic-era voting procedures during the 2020 election. In the same interview, Trump also added the GOP needed to \u201ctrust mail-in voting.\u201d Neither the RNC nor Lara Trump responded to multiple requests for comment. A long history of spreading election lies As recently as February 2024, Lara Trump said she did not believe Biden received 81 million votes in the 2020 election. \u201cDoes anyone actually believe that in 2020, 81 million people were so inspired by a guy who could only get 10 people (to attended events) \u2026that he had the most massive turnout in the history of elections?\u201d she said at a Trump event in South Carolina just days before she announced her campaign for RNC co-chair. \u201cNo, we don\u2019t believe that.\u201d On her internet show and podcast, and in public events, she often spread outlandish and nonsensical claims about the 2020 election. On an episode of her show that aired on December 30, 2020, Trump agreed with her co-hosts that the election did not pass the \u201csmell test\u201d and falsely suggested that dead voters helped Biden win. \u201cNow, I don\u2019t know if this is true, but somebody sent me this. Donald Trump got 74 million votes. There are 133 million registered voters in the United States. If every single registered voter went out and voted, which we know is basically impossible, doesn\u2019t happen, there would only be 59 million votes left for Joe Biden. So how the heck did he get 81 million votes?\u201d she said. The comments cite a widely debunked analysis that misrepresents the number of people eligible to vote. \u201cYou\u2019re discriminating against all the dead people, Lara. How dare you!\u201d said one co-host. \u201cOh yeah, that\u2019s right. That\u2019s true,\u201d she responded. A CNN analysis previously found no evidence to support this claim, debunking the misinformation spread by Trump supporters online in the aftermath of the 2020 results. The 2020 election saw a record-breaking turnout, with 155 million people casting their votes, as reported by the US Census Bureau. This marked the highest voter participation of the 21st century, with 66.8% of eligible citizens aged 18 and older voting. Later in the episode, Trump said, \u201cI think that [Democrats] know that the Republicans are not gonna let it stand. They\u2019re not gonna certify votes for Joe Biden. And it is likely that they will be voting for Donald Trump for a second term.\u201d In an episode of her podcast weeks earlier, she claimed the odds of Biden winning in swing states were \u201cone in one quadrillion to the fourth power,\u201d as mail-in ballots were counted, failing to cite a statistical analysis. Though Biden narrowly lost with in-person voters, 46% of voters voted by mail in 2020. As votes were counted, Biden pulled ahead, according to an analysis from Pew Research. Though nothing was abnormal or illegal about the process, Lara Trump has also referred to the counting of votes nefariously. \u201cWe gotta make up so much for all the cheating,\u201d Trump said on her podcast in September 2023. \u201cWe know the Democrats love to do that. We need to go into this thing with such a big lead that they\u2019re like, \u2018oh my God, we can\u2019t do a 3:00 a.m. spike with this. We\u2019re never gonna make it.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/10/politics/lara-trump-rnc-2020-election-fraud-claims/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_12_politics_michael-cohen-trump-hush-money", "text": "Nobody has anything nice to say about Michael Cohen. Donald Trump\u2019s former fixer and lawyer is expected to take the stand Monday as the key witness in the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s case against\u00a0the\u00a0former president, prepared to give testimony connecting to Trump the $130,000 hush money payment Cohen made to adult film actress Stormy Daniels before the 2016 election. Through three weeks of testimony, jurors have already heard plenty about Cohen through numerous witnesses, who have painted an unflattering portrait of an aggressive, impulsive and unlikeable attorney. David Pecker, former head of National Enquirer parent company American Media Inc., said Cohen was \u201cprone to exaggeration.\u201d\u00a0Former Trump aide\u00a0Hope Hicks said Cohen liked to call himself a \u201cfixer\u201d\u00a0\u2013 a role she said was possible only because \u201che first broke it.\u201d\u00a0And Daniels\u2019\u00a0former\u00a0attorney Keith Davidson said he only worked with Cohen because he was a \u201cjerk\u201d whom Daniels\u2019 then-manager Gina Rodriguez \u2013 along with everyone else \u2013 didn\u2019t want to deal with. \u201cGina called me up to tell me that: \u2018Some jerk called me and was very, very aggressive and threatened to sue me. And I, um, would like you, Keith, to call this jerk back,\u2019\u201d\u00a0Davidson testified in the third week of the trial. \u201cI hate to ask it this way, but who was that jerk?\u201d asked Assistant District Attorney Joshua Steinglass. \u201cIt was Michael Cohen,\u201d Davidson responded. Now\u00a0Cohen\u00a0is the witness whom prosecutors are relying on to deliver testimony that can help them prove Trump\u00a0falsified\u00a0business records when he\u00a0allegedly\u00a0reimbursed\u00a0Cohen for the $130,000\u00a0to Daniels\u00a0to keep her from going public about a past encounter ahead of\u00a0the 2016 election. Trump has pleaded not guilty\u00a0and denied the affair. Cohen is the only witness who will testify about Trump\u2019s alleged involvement in both the decision to pay Daniels and the plan to reimburse Cohen for advancing the money. Cohen will likely serve as the narrator for the prosecution and take the jury from the initial meeting in which Pecker, Cohen and Trump allegedly agreed to buy negative stories that could hurt Trump\u2019s presidential run to the payment made to Daniels just days before Election Day to an Oval Office meeting in February 2017, just weeks after Trump was sworn in. Prosecutors allege that during the February meeting, Trump and Cohen agreed how Cohen would be paid back. That arrangement, prosecutors say, included a false story that Cohen was working under a retainer agreement.\u00a0The paperwork, from the invoices\u00a0and\u00a0general ledger entries\u00a0to the\u00a0checks signed by Trump,\u00a0make up the 34 criminal charges in the case. Witnesses who come with \u2018baggage\u2019 Prosecutors have waited to call Cohen until the end of their case, after introducing phone records, emails, text messages and bank records that they hope bolster his credibility with the jury. They have not tried to hide from the jury that he and other witnesses have plenty of problems. \u201cWe are going to be very up-front about the fact that several of the witnesses in this case have what you made might consider to be some baggage,\u201d Steinglass told a panel of prospective jurors during jury selection. The testimony will pit Trump against Cohen, who once said he would take a bullet for the former president. They last saw each other when Cohen testified in Trump\u2019s New York civil fraud trial last fall. Cohen\u2019s testimony was brief, but the showdown was tense. This\u00a0week the stakes are higher,\u00a0with a potential criminal conviction and possible jail sentence\u00a0on the line for Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee. It brings to a close a long journey for Cohen, who is still aggrieved that he served three years in prison\u00a0and home confinement\u00a0after pleading guilty to federal campaign finance charges related to the payoff, among other crimes. Cohen met with prosecutors more than a dozen times and testified before the grand jury in the hush money trial. He has immunity on state charges for his role in the alleged conspiracy. He will also face blistering cross-examination by Trump attorney Todd Blanche. The former president\u2019s lawyers are expected to hammer at Cohen\u2019s credibility, including digging into his past, and suggest to the jury that Trump had no idea what deal Cohen struck or how it was recorded on the books of his company. \u201cEven before he takes the stand, Cohen has been attacked and undermined by the prosecution\u2019s own witnesses. On one hand, he could be damaged goods before he takes the stand. But he also might benefit from low expectations if the jury finds him to be better than advertised,\u201d said Elie Honig, a CNN senior legal analyst and former state and federal prosecutor. After jail sentence,\u00a0Cohen released\u00a0books and\u00a0podcast\u00a0attacking Trump The charges filed against Trump date to events that transpired during the 2016 election. But in many ways, the case against Trump\u00a0stems from his\u00a0former fixer\u2019s decision to plead guilty in 2018 in federal court to two counts of making unlawful campaign contributions in violation of federal campaign finance laws. He implicated Trump directly in the scheme and admitted that he orchestrated to pay Daniels on Trump\u2019s behalf. Cohen also pleaded guilty to tax charges and to lying to Congress about Trump\u2019s business venture to build a Trump Tower in Moscow. Cohen was sentenced to three years in prison, which he served behind bars and under house arrest. Cohen\u2019s plea prompted the Manhattan District Attorney\u2019s Office to launch the investigation surrounding the hush money payments that led to Trump\u2019s indictment\u00a0last year. Cohen became dedicated to antagonizing Trump. He published two books, \u201cDisloyal\u201d in 2020 and \u201cRevenge\u201d in 2022, and launched a podcast, \u201cMea Culpa\u201d \u2013 all of which spent plenty of time bashing Trump and cheering on his prosecution. On social media, Cohen continued to attack Trump in the weeks leading up to the trial, and even after it began. The social media jabs reached the point that Judge Juan Merchan told prosecutors Friday to give Cohen a message \u201cfrom the bench\u201d that he should stop speaking about the case. (Merchan has said he cannot legally gag a witness.) Trump has often punched right back in interviews and on social media, including in several instances that violated the judge\u2019s gag order on the former president barring discussion of witnesses in the case. \u2018No one wanted to talk to Cohen\u2019 Beginning with the first witness in the case, Pecker, jurors have heard criticisms from witness after witness of Cohen ahead of his own expected testimony. Pecker, who met with Cohen and Trump at a key Trump Tower meeting in 2015, was asked by Trump attorney Emil Bove whether Cohen was \u201cprone to exaggeration.\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d Pecker said. Bove then asked Pecker whether he could not trust everything Cohen said. The judge sustained an objection to the question, telling Trump\u2019s attorney in a sidebar discussion that it was not the right place to \u201cimpeach\u201d Cohen\u2019s credibility. More witnesses would keep doing so anyway. Cohen\u2019s\u00a0former\u00a0banker, Gary Farro, then testified that he was specifically given Cohen\u2019s account because he could be firm with individuals who \u201cmay be a little challenging.\u201d Farro said it was fair to call Cohen an \u201caggressive guy.\u201d \u201cAnything he did need, he called me, and it was always something that was urgent,\u201d the banker said. Arguably the most negative assessment of Cohen came from Davidson, who negotiated\u00a0the\u00a0hush money deal with Cohen on Daniels\u2019 behalf in 2016. Davidson described a 2011 conversation\u00a0about a\u00a0blog post on Daniels and Trump on\u00a0thedirty.com, where Cohen unleashed a \u201cbarrage of insults and insinuations and allegations.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think he was accusing us of anything. He was just screaming,\u201d Davidson said. Daniels\u2019\u00a0former\u00a0attorney went on to explain how he ended up involved in the hush money deal, when Daniels\u2019 manager asked him to help finalize the deal for a nondisclosure agreement. Asked why he got involved, Davidson said: \u201cThe moral of the story was: No one wanted to talk to Cohen.\u201d Davidson recalled under questioning from Steinglass that after Trump was elected in 2016, he got a call in December from a \u201cvery despondent and saddened\u201d Cohen. \u201cHe said something to the effect of: \u2018Jesus Christ. Can you f**ing believe I\u2019m not going to Washington? After everything I\u2019ve done for that f**ing guy. I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m not going to Washington. I\u2019ve saved that guy\u2019s a** so many times, you don\u2019t even know.\u2019\u201d Others who didn\u2019t interact with Cohen as much as Davidson didn\u2019t have much better things to say. Jeff McConney, the former Trump\u00a0Organization\u00a0controller, was asked what Cohen\u2019s position was at the company. \u201cHe said he was a lawyer,\u201d McConney responded. \u201cDid he work in the legal department?\u201d asked prosecutor Matthew Colangelo. \u201cI guess so,\u201d McConney said derisively. And Hicks, who worked at\u00a0the Trump Organization before becoming a key aide on the 2016 campaign, described to jurors how Cohen \u2013 Trump\u2019s fixer \u2013 was prone to inflate his influence on the campaign. \u201cThere were times where Mr. Cohen did things that you\u00a0felt were not helpful to what you were trying to accomplish,\u00a0right?\u201d Bove asked Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign press secretary. \u201cYes,\u201d Hicks responded. \u201cI used to say that he liked to call himself \u2018a fixer\u2019 or \u2018Mr. Fix It,\u2019 and it was only because he first broke it that he was able to come and fix it.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/12/politics/michael-cohen-trump-hush-money/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "politics"}}

Joe Manchin\u00a0in the deep-red state. Justice is projected to win a crowded GOP primary that included US Rep. Alex Mooney, a member of the hard-line House Freedom Caucus.

The West Virginia Senate seat\u00a0has long been seen as the most likely\u00a0to flip this cycle and will be key to GOP hopes of winning the Senate this November.

National Republicans, including former President Donald Trump, largely coalesced in the West Virginia Republican primary around Justice, who was barred by term limits from seeking reelection as governor. Still, in the closing weeks, the Senate contest turned bitter as Justice and Mooney traded sharp jabs on air. Mooney launched blistering spots\u00a0accusing\u00a0Justice of supporting \u201cpro-transgender legislation\u201d and\u00a0claiming\u00a0that he \u201cpushed the biggest tax hike in West Virginia history.\u201d Meanwhile, Justice, the owner of the Greenbrier resort\u00a0who turned a coal mining business he inherited into a sprawling empire,\u00a0rebutted some of Mooney\u2019s criticism with\u00a0testimonials in his ads\u00a0from West Virginia coal miners.

{"id": "2024_05_14_politics_irada-akhoundova-plead-guilty-henry-cuellar", "text": "A third person has pleaded guilty in connection with an investigation into Rep. Henry Cuellar and his wife, who have been charged with accepting nearly $600,000 in bribes from two foreign entities, court filings this week revealed. Irada Akhoundova pleaded guilty in federal court in Texas earlier this month to one count of acting as an unregistered foreign agent. She is the third person known to have entered into a plea agreement related to the case. Cuellar, a Texas Democrat, and his wife, Imelda, are facing several charges, including conspiracy, bribery, money laundering and violating a ban on public officials acting as foreign agents. According to their indictment, the bribery scheme involved Azerbaijan and a Mexican bank, and the couple used the proceeds to pay taxes, satisfy debts and spend tens of thousands of dollars at restaurants and retail stores. Court records indicate that the case against Akhoundova is related to the investigation into Cuellar and his wife, and that Akhoundova will \u201cfully cooperate with the United States\u201d as part of her plea agreement. CNN has reached out to Akhoundova\u2019s attorney for comment. Her sentencing is set for September 18. Mina Colin Strother, Cuellar\u2019s former campaign manager and former chief of staff, and Florencio \u201cLencho\u201d Rendon, a political consultant and businessman from San Antonio, also have entered into cooperation agreements. They agreed to plead guilty to conspiracy to commit money laundering. According to her plea agreement, Akhoundova worked for an affiliate of an Azerbaijani company and helped facilitate a $60,000 payment as part of the bribery scheme. Cuellar has denied any wrongdoing by him and his wife. Chris Flood, Cuellar\u2019s attorney, said in a statement to CNN that \u201cCongressman Cuellar is not and has never been a foreign agent.\u201d He added, \u201cCongressman Cuellar has always voted his conscience and in the best interests of his constituents, consistent with many of his colleagues.\u201d With regards to Akhoundova\u2019s plea, Flood said: \u201cIf the person who plead guilty tells the truth then we are not worried.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/14/politics/irada-akhoundova-plead-guilty-henry-cuellar/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_11_politics_trump-schedule-court-campaign", "text": "Former President Donald Trump has repeatedly claimed that his criminal trial in Manhattan has prevented him from campaigning in key swing states. \u201cI should be right now in Pennsylvania, in Florida, in many other states, North Carolina, Georgia - campaigning,\u201d Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, told reporters outside the courtroom on the second day of the trial in April. He made\u00a0similar\u00a0comments in the courthouse hallway on subsequent days,\u00a0saying\u00a0that, if not for the trial he baselessly blamed on President Joe Biden, he was \u201csupposed to be\u201d in Ohio, New Hampshire and South Carolina. It\u2019s certainly possible that Trump would have been campaigning in all of those states if there was no trial. But a review of his activities over the trial\u2019s first four weeks shows that he has done little campaign travel, and held few public campaign events, on days off from court. Instead, he has spent most of his 12 court-free days out of voters\u2019 view at his properties in New York, New Jersey and Florida. And he did not use any of those 12 court-free days to visit Pennsylvania, Georgia, South Carolina, Ohio or New Hampshire, states he asserted the trial was preventing him from visiting. (He is\u00a0scheduled\u00a0to visit Ohio for a fundraiser\u00a0on May 15.) No public events on most free days Trump\u2019s trial is not in session on Wednesdays, Saturdays and Sundays, and the judge also scheduled one Monday off in late April.\u00a0As of this Saturday, May 11,\u00a0that left Trump with 12 court-free days to do as he pleased, compared to 15 days where he was required in court, in the\u00a027 days\u00a0beginning with the\u00a0opening of jury selection on April 15. Trump held no public events on\u00a0seven of the 12 court-free days. And it was no public events on eight of the 12 days\u00a0if you don\u2019t count his one-minute-long appearance for the cameras prior to a private meeting with the president of Poland at Trump Tower in New York City. Trump has visited few swing states since the trial began Trump has done some campaign travel during the trial. He held campaign rallies in the swing states of\u00a0Wisconsin and Michigan on one court-free Wednesday in May, and he booked a weekend April rally in the swing state of North Carolina that was\u00a0called off at the last minute because of severe weather.(He attended a closed-door\u00a0fundraiser\u00a0in the state earlier in the day.) He\u00a0is scheduled to hold\u00a0a rally on Saturday afternoon\u00a0in New Jersey, which has for three decades been a Democratic stronghold in presidential elections, and he\u00a0appeared in May at a Formula One race in Miami. Trump also made campaign-style appearances in Democratic-dominated New York City before or after\u00a0three\u00a0court\u00a0appearances. And he has turned the hallway outside the Manhattan courtroom into a de facto campaigning venue, regularly speaking to media cameras before and after sitting in court. But he has let the majority of the 12 off days pass\u00a0without doing any public campaign events. Instead, he has spent some of the time\u00a0golfing at his Bedminster club in New Jersey,\u00a0attending\u00a0a Republican National Committee fundraiser at his Mar-a-Lago club and residence in Florida, attending a Mar-a-Lago\u00a0dinner\u00a0for people who bought large numbers of his \u201cNFT\u201d digital trading cards, and\u00a0making phone calls and holding meetings. His complete itinerary on the off days is not known. Here is a list showing how he is known to have spent his time from the opening day of the trial, April 15,\u00a0until May 11. April 15: Court April 16: Court (made appearance at New York City bodega afterward) April 17: Day off court.

{"id": "2024_05_14_politics_cohen-trump-hush-money-analysis", "text": "\u201cJust do it.\u201d With three short words, more famous for selling sports gear than exposing conspiracies, star witness Michael Cohen on Monday depicted Donald Trump\u2019s order of a hush money payoff to an adult film star to allegedly save his 2016 campaign. Prosecutors will seek to build on his testimony when he returns to the stand Tuesday to nail down their case that the ex-president broke the law by falsifying financial records to hide the pay-off in the culmination of a scheme to mislead voters. All that will be a curtain raiser for what is looming as a savage cross-examination by the presumptive Republican nominee\u2019s attorney, designed to shatter the reputation of Cohen, expose him as a liar and punish him for turning on his ex-boss. The biggest question before Monday was whether prosecutors had laid a prior foundation of corroborating evidence to which they could connect Cohen\u2019s testimony and prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Trump acted criminally. \u201cI think they have it,\u201d Ryan Goodman, a professor at NYU Law, told CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett, citing fulsome evidence \u2013 such as logs of calls, including between Trump and Cohen, about the proposed payment and the lawyer\u2019s reimbursement, which prosecutors say led to the falsified financial documents. \u201cAs of today, it holds together.\u201d Trump has pleaded not guilty, and no one can say how a jury will interpret events at trial until the fateful moment when the foreperson delivers a verdict. But former New York prosecutor Bernarda Villalona said on CNN\u2019s \u201cThe Lead\u201d that Cohen, from his delivery to his eye contact with the prosecutor, had been \u201cexcellent\u201d on the stand and helped the prosecution. \u201cThey finally provided that link that Donald Trump authorized these payments and the payments were for the purposes of affecting that campaign,\u201d she said. \u201cMichael Cohen did deliver. \u2026 but we have to see how he stands up to cross examination.\u201d Given Cohen\u2019s past, including a conviction for lying to Congress, and his thwarted hopes of a job in Trump\u2019s administration offering a potential motive for revenge, the cross examination will be critical, said David Schoen, who represented Trump during his second impeachment. \u201cI think that they (the prosecution) feel he is a make-or-break witness. I think in real terms, he probably is,\u201d Schoen told CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer. \u201cThis case is going to turn in large part on the cross-examination of Mr. Cohen. That ought to be a dream for a half-way competent lawyer.\u201d A pivotal day The most critical day of the trial so far saw the presumptive Republican nominee come face to face with Cohen, who says he squashed scandals and cleaned up busted business deals as his boss\u2019 ruthless fixer. It was another unfathomable episode in a 2024 election season that has been ensnared by Trump\u2019s legal quagmire but that could still end with him back in the White House. And while the courtroom action Monday will play a pivotal role in how the case turns out, there is a wider audience given how Trump\u2019s defense has morphed into a campaign rationale. It\u2019s too early to assess how voters might process a conviction or acquittal or whether damaging new revelations about his conduct will sway an electorate by now numb to scandals that would have doomed a normal candidate years ago. But fresh New York Times/Siena polls showing Trump leading President Joe Biden in multiple swing states underscore his very real hopes of a non-consecutive second term. And Cohen\u2019s descriptions Monday of the ex-president\u2019s way of doing business added to growing evidence that a second Trump administration would likely pose an even greater threat to the rule of law than his first spell in the White House. Trump is barred from publicly slamming Cohen and what he sees as his treachery because of a gag order imposed by a judge who has threatened jail if he won\u2019t comply following 10 previous violations. But the former president\u2019s tirade outside the courtroom Monday was even more irate than usual, as he lashed out at Judge Juan Merchan and bitterly claimed he was a victim of political victimization. \u201cThe whole world is laughing now at the New York, weaponized, legal system,\u201d he claimed. In a sense, testimony from Cohen \u2013 who has written that he was drawn to Trump before he ran for president because of his aura and fame \u2013 is a lesson in the contortions and legally questionable choices often faced by those in the ex-president\u2019s orbit. But there is no shortage of Republicans seeking to join him. Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance, a vice presidential prospect, and Alabama Sen. Tommy Tuberville joined Trump outside the courtroom Monday morning, strutting like a posse behind a sheriff and reflecting his undimmed power in the GOP. Vance served as Trump\u2019s ungagged mouthpiece, seeking to discredit Cohen and showing his own credentials as a Trump defender as the ex-president mulls a list of running mates. \u201cDoes any reasonable, sensible person believe anything that Michael Cohen says?\u201d the Ohio Republican asked. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on inside that courtroom is a threat to American democracy, ladies and gentlemen,\u201d he said, defending a presumptive GOP nominee who tried to overthrow a free and fair election in 2020. How the Trump and Cohen double act fractured During hours of testimony, the former president sat with his eyes often closed as Cohen, now on a journey of redemption after years of service to Trump ended in his own jail term, detailed a scheme to silence adult film star Stormy Daniels, who claims she had a sexual liaison with the then-reality television star and real estate magnate. (Trump denies the affair.) Prosecutor Susan Hoffinger spent a painstaking day slowly taking Cohen through his former role at the Trump Organization and his commitment to protecting his boss, with Cohen even going on television to lie and organizing schemes to silence alleged claims against Trump from other women. Hoffinger sought to establish that the payment to Daniels did take place, that Trump told Cohen to do it, that Cohen made the payment using a home equity line of credit to disguise it from his wife and that he expected to be reimbursed. Hoffinger also drew Cohen into testifying that the real reason Trump was worried about Daniels\u2019 claims \u2014 which emerged shortly after an \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape came to light in 2016 in which he boasted about grabbing female genitals \u2014 was to protect his campaign rather than, as the defense will argue, to spare his family embarrassment. Cohen said that Trump told him: \u201cWomen are going to hate me. \u2026 Guys may think it\u2019s cool, but this is going to be a disaster for the campaign.\u201d He said, \u201cHe wasn\u2019t even thinking about Melania,\u201d referring to the former first lady. \u201cThis was all about the campaign.\u201d Cohen also testified that Trump said he would not be on the market for long, implying he could get another wife quickly. The ex-president smirked and shook his head after that comment. Throughout his testimony, Cohen said he always kept Trump up to speed with his activities. \u201cEverything required Mr. Trump\u2019s sign-off,\u201d he said, noting the Daniels payment was no exception. \u201cHe stated to me that he had spoken to some friends, some individuals, smart people, and \u2018That it\u2019s $130,000. You\u2019re a billionaire, just pay it. There\u2019s no reason to keep this thing out there so do it.\u2019 He expressed to me, \u2018just do it.\u2019\u201d Trump is charged with 34 counts of falsifying business records. Prosecutors say this was done to hide monthly reimbursements Cohen received in 2017 \u2014 after his boss became president \u2014 for the hush money payment he made to Daniels. In an apparent bid to neutralize an expected effort by the defense to argue that Cohen is lying because he bears a grudge against Trump, the prosecution asked him about his anger when his annual bonus was cut by two-thirds in December 2016. He testified that he was \u201cpissed off.\u201d Shortly afterwards, he went to Trump\u2019s then-chief financial officer, Allen Weisselberg, to discuss the repayment of the $130,000 he had paid Daniels. Cohen also testified that he was disappointed not to be considered for Trump\u2019s first White House chief of staff. His testimony was quite the reversal for a man who previously wrote that he became a \u201cthug\u201d to carry out Trump\u2019s wishes and who said Monday of the client who spurned him: \u201cThe only thing that was on my mind was to accomplish the task to make him happy.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/14/politics/cohen-trump-hush-money-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_14_politics_doj-republicans-democrats-what-matters", "text": "The long-standing allegation from former President Donald Trump is that President Joe Biden has weaponized the Department of Justice and that there is a double standard for Republicans as compared with Democrats. There\u2019s plenty of evidence otherwise lately. Sen. Bob Menendez, the up-for-reelection Democrat from New Jersey, is on trial for bribery for the second time in seven years \u2013 and across the street from where Trump\u2019s New York state trial related to hush money payments is taking place in Manhattan. Menendez denies the allegations, which include that he and his wife accepted gold bars, envelopes of cash and much more. In Texas, federal prosecutors have brought corruption charges against Rep. Henry Cuellar, a Democrat, for allegedly taking nearly $600,000 in bribes, including from a foreign oil and gas company. Cuellar denies the allegations. Another Democrat, Rep. Cori Bush of Missouri, is the subject of a federal probe into her campaign spending, according to a CNN report in January. She has denied wrongdoing and defended paying her husband for security services. Evidence against the idea of political bias The cases above, if nothing else, are a serious complication to Trump\u2019s often-repeated claim that he is the subject of a partisan \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d So is\u00a0prosecution of Hunter Biden, the president\u2019s son, in a gun case in Delaware that is rarely brought as a stand-alone charge, and a separate tax case in California. Both trials are slated to begin in June. Yes, Trump is the subject of two, distinct prosecutions brought by special counsel Jack Smith, concerning the former president\u2019s refusal to return classified material to the National Archives after he left the White House and his efforts to overturn the 2020 election. Both of those prosecutions are currently on hold. But it\u2019s worth noting that federal prosecutors passed on charging Trump for the hush money payments scheme that Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg later pursued. An\u00a0unusually feisty Attorney General Merrick Garland\u00a0rejected any claim of bias during testimony on Capitol Hill last September. \u201cOur job is not to do what is politically convenient,\u201d he said. \u201cOur job is not to take orders from the president, from Congress or from anyone else about who or what to criminally investigate.\u201d The Cuellar indictment, the Bush probe and the beginning of the Menendez trial are new developments to add to a running list of federal prosecutions I first compiled last year. Here\u2019s a look at active and recent federal cases against federal lawmakers and governors. This is not meant to be an exhaustive list, but it is what I could find going back to 2000 in CNN\u2019s coverage and from other news outlets. Ongoing federal cases against sitting federal lawmakers There is one against a Republican,\u00a0expelled Rep. George Santos\u00a0of New York, and two against Democrats, Menendez and Cuellar. No charges have yet been filed against Bush. There is also a non-prosecution to mention. Rep. Matt Gaetz, the Florida Republican, was informed last year by the DOJ that he\u00a0would not be charged\u00a0in a long-running sex trafficking probe. Federal cases against recent members of Congress These are federal cases against current or former federal lawmakers. I was able to find nine targeting Republicans and eight targeting Democrats. Former Rep. Jeff Fortenberry, a Republican from Nebraska\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Found guilty\u00a0in 2022 of three felonies in a case that centered on campaign contributions. Former Rep. TJ Cox, a Democrat\u00a0from California\u00a0\u2013 Still awaiting trial after his\u00a02022 indictment, including for fraudulent campaign contributions. He was offered a plea deal, according to local reports. Former Rep. Duncan Hunter, a Republican\u00a0from California\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Sentenced to 11 months in prison\u00a0for misusing\u00a0campaign funds, but later pardoned by Trump. Former Rep. Chris Collins, a Republican from New York\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Sentenced to 26 months in prison for insider trading, but later pardoned by Trump. Former Rep. Corrine\u00a0Brown, a Democrat\u00a0from Florida\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Served more than two years\u00a0for setting up a false charity. Former Rep. Steve Stockman, a Republican\u00a0from Texas\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Sentenced to 10 years\u00a0in prison\u00a0for multiple felonies including fraud and money laundering, but\u00a0pardoned by Trump\u00a0after serving part of his sentence. Former Rep. Anthony Weiner, a Democrat from New York\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Sentenced to 21 months\u00a0in prison\u00a0for sexting with a minor. Former Rep. Chaka Fattah, a Democrat from Pennsylvania\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Sentenced to 10 years in prison\u00a0for racketeering, fraud and money laundering. Former Rep. Michael Grimm, a Republican\u00a0from New York\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Pleaded guilty and sentenced to eight months in prison\u00a0for tax evasion. Attempted to run again for Congress. Former Rep. Rick Renzi, a Republican from Arizona\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Sentenced to three years for corruption. Pardoned by Trump after he served time. Sen. Bob Menendez, a\u00a0Democrat from New Jersey\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Acquitted by a judge and other charges dismissed\u00a0after a jury deadlocked in a bribery case that predates the current prosecution. Former Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr., a Democrat from Illinois\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Sentenced to 30 months in prison\u00a0for misusing\u00a0campaign funds. Former Sen. Ted Stevens, a Republican from Alaska\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Conviction by jury for lying on ethics forms was later set aside\u00a0over allegations of prosecutorial misconduct. Former Rep. William Jefferson, a Democrat from Louisiana\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Sentenced to 13 years for corruption and soliciting bribes. There was video of him taking $100,000 from an African official. Served multiple years in prison, but many of the charges were later vacated by a judge based on\u00a0a US\u00a0Supreme Court decision. Former Rep. Bob Ney, a Republican from Ohio\u00a0\u2013 Sentenced to 30 months\u00a0after a guilty plea for corruption\u00a0tied to disgraced lobbyist Jack Abramoff. Former Rep. Randy\u00a0\u201cDuke\u201d Cunningham, a Republican from California\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Sentenced to eight years in prison after a guilty plea for bribery. Later pardoned by Trump. Former Rep. James Traficant, a Democrat from Ohio\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Sentenced to eight years in prison\u00a0for corruption after defending himself during trial. Was later expelled from the House. Other prosecutions to consider Two Republican governors and two Democratic governors have been convicted in federal courts in recent decades: Former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell,\u00a0a Republican,\u00a0was convicted for bribery and corruption. But the US Supreme Court changed the rules in corruption and bribery cases when it\u00a0threw out the case against McDonnell. Former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich, a Democrat,\u00a0was convicted for trying to sell his power to appoint a replacement to Barack Obama\u2019s Senate seat. His sentence was\u00a0later commuted by Trump. Former Alabama Gov. Don Siegelman, a Democrat,\u00a0was convicted by a jury\u00a0of bribery and corruption and was sentenced to more than six years in prison. Former Illinois Gov. George Ryan, a Republican,\u00a0was convicted on corruption charges after an FBI sting. Did we miss a federal lawmaker convicted or charged? Let me know at zachary.wolf@cnn.com. What\u2019s not included here Local prosecutions \u2013 like the state or local cases against\u00a0former Rep. Trey Radel, the Republican from Florida, for cocaine possession in Washington, DC, or former\u00a0Sen. Larry Craig, the Republican from Idaho, for lewd behavior in the Minneapolis airport \u2013 don\u2019t really fit here since they were not conducted by the Department of Justice. Some notable recent DOJ prosecutions have focused on Democrats at the state level, like Andrew Gillum, the Democrat and former Tallahassee, Florida, mayor who ran for governor and lost to Gov. Ron DeSantis in 2018. Gillum was\u00a0acquitted of lying to the FBI. Former Baltimore Mayor Catherine Pugh, also a Democrat, was\u00a0sentenced to three years in prison\u00a0after she pleaded guilty to charges related to a scheme in which local nonprofit organizations bought her self-published children\u2019s book. Trump charges Trump likes to argue he\u2019s the subject of a conspiratorial \u201cwitch hunt\u201d engineered by a deep state. Why, he will often say, was Hillary Clinton not prosecuted for her email server while he is being prosecuted\u00a0for mishandling classified material? This forgets the history of the 2016 election, which Clinton has said she lost because of then-FBI Director James Comey\u2019s handling of the investigation of her emails. Comey did not charge her before the election but did criticize her, and then, 11 days before Election Day, he said the investigation had been reopened. These whataboutisms can go on and on without changing anyone\u2019s mind.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/14/politics/doj-republicans-democrats-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_13_politics_abortion-ads-democratic-group-trump", "text": "A Democratic super PAC is launching a $25 million advertising blitz in three swing states, featuring voter testimonials about former President Donald Trump\u2019s role in curbing abortion access. The ads from American Bridge 21st Century mark the first wave of a larger, planned $140 million campaign by the group to persuade swing voters in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin to reject Trump\u2019s bid to return to the White House. President Joe Biden flipped all three states in 2020. The ads, which the group says will target women voters living in rural and exurban areas of the three states, represent the latest effort by Democrats to use emotional, straight-to-the-camera stories to sway election outcomes since the US Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022. American Bridge co-founder Bradley Beychok said the group has recruited hundreds of voters \u201cwilling to share their stories about why another Trump White House would be so devastating for them.\u201d Trump\u2019s nomination of three conservatives to the high court paved the way for the Dobbs decision overturning the federal right to abortion, which has emerged as one of the most contentious issues in politics. Biden\u2019s campaign has sought to make it the defining issue of the 2024 election. While Trump has said he was \u201cproudly the person responsible\u201d for the court\u2019s action, the former president has said decisions on limits to abortion should be left up to the states. He also has declined to say how he would vote on an abortion access measure on the ballot this fall in Florida, where he resides. In some cases, the American Bridge ads juxtapose Trump\u2019s words with those voters. In one, a Wisconsin woman named Anna \u2013 described as an OB-GYN and mother of two \u2013 tearfully describes having to terminate a wanted pregnancy because the baby she was carrying would not survive. \u201cThat\u2019s not a decision for any politician, including Donald Trump,\u201d she says. In another commercial, Lori \u2013 who has worked as a nurse in central Pennsylvania \u2013 frets about the impact of Dobbs on her daughter and granddaughter. \u201cWe\u2019re already moving backwards,\u201d she says. \u201cIf we reelect Trump, what are women going to lose next?\u201d American Bridge officials say the ads are aimed at four kinds of voters: moderates, those who swing between Democrats and Republicans, conservatives who dislike the hard-right rhetoric espoused by some Republicans, and a group they call \u201cdouble doubters,\u201d which they define as voters who aren\u2019t excited about either Trump or Biden. In all, the group has a $200 million budget for its anti-Trump efforts in the 2024 election, including its previously announced $140 million advertising campaign. Officials say another wave of testimonial-style ads will roll out this summer in these three battlegrounds.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/13/politics/abortion-ads-democratic-group-trump/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "politics"}}

They were co-presidents of the campus College Democrats and they know the pro-Gaza encampment that sprung up on campus for the final weeks of school is a sign of deep political problems for President Joe Biden in a state he likely cannot afford to lose. \u201cAll roads to the White House go through Michigan,\u201d Gray said. \u201cMichigan is up for grabs, and I did not think I would be saying this right now. And I wish I wasn\u2019t saying this right now. But I am genuinely concerned about which way Michigan will go.\u201d Jalisatgi will be back on campus to start law school in September and hopes there is no encampment. \u201cJoe Biden has the ability to make sure that there isn\u2019t,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that starts with calling for a cease fire, for listening to his student voters across the country.\u201d Jalisatgi and Gray are part of a 2024 CNN project designed to experience the presidential campaign through the eyes and experiences of voters who live in battleground states and are members of voting blocs most likely to determine the outcome. Younger voters were critical to Biden returning Michigan to the blue column in 2020; exit polling showed Biden winning 61% of voters aged 18-29, to just 37% for Donald Trump.\u00a0Younger voters also helped Michigan Democrats score big 2022 midterm victories. But our conversations exposed profound troubles with this group for Biden in 2024, even more so than we found in our initial visits\u00a0with these voters back in mid-November. That was just weeks after the Hamas terrorist attack on Israel; the campus activism critical of the Israeli response and Biden\u2019s handling of the crisis was just beginning. Now, that campus activism is a defining chapter for many young voters. Dampened enthusiasm for voting for Biden Summer Matkin, for example, was getting her freshman footing when we first visited her at Wayne State last November. She was home in suburban Detroit when we circled back last week. \u201cIt was stressful,\u201d she said of adjusting to her first year at college. Last fall, she raised giant concerns about the president\u2019s age but did not hesitate when asked who she would pick if the November ballot was a Biden-Trump rematch. \u201cI\u2019d go Biden,\u201d she said in that November interview at Wayne State\u2019s computer gaming lounge. This will be Matkin\u2019s first presidential vote, and she was visibly excited talking about that last fall. Still excited? \u201cQuestionable.\u201d That\u2019s because Matkin has more questions about Biden. \u201cHis age will always play a factor in how I think about him,\u201d she said. \u201cNo matter how many Taylor Swift references you make, you will never understand us. But my thing is, I think he has handled everything with Israel and Palestine terribly.\u201d Matkin still leans Biden \u2014 because she cannot stomach the return of Trump to the White House. But she is part of a spirited conversation with friends. \u201cI\u2019ve considered going third party as well,\u201d Matkin said. \u201cA lot of our generation is also considering going third party. But I kind of fear it is going to split up the votes and end up having it fall back on Trump, which I wouldn\u2019t want to happen.\u201d A tepid endorsement There was some progress for Biden in our group. Wayne State student Maya Siegmann was likely Biden when we spoke in November. Certain Biden, she says now. Though her endorsement was hardly overwhelming. \u201cHis age definitely is still a barrier,\u201d Siegmann said in an interview at her suburban Detroit home. \u201cI do still think there should be an age cap on politics in general. \u2026 I would vote Biden. I think that he\u2019s the less bad option for president.\u201d She\u00a0is thrilled with her grades. But Siegmann, who is Jewish, is more thrilled this school year is over \u2014 providing a glimpse into the fear of many Jewish students from the nationwide campus unrest. \u201cIt was terrifying. It was terrifying,\u201d she said of the past semester. \u201cThe escalation on other campuses has made me fear for my campus.\u201d Wayne State was relatively calm. There were modest protests and on a couple of occasions the campus Hillel organization was locked down as a precaution when pro-Palestinian students demonstrated at the student union building where the campus Jewish organization has its offices. Siegmann told us in November she was excited to join a breakdancing club. This visit, she told us she quit because it held a fundraiser for Palestinians and she feared the money would end up going to Hamas. Siegmann said when she asked a club leader questions about the event, he blocked her phone number. It happened again, Siegmman said, when a Jewish student and former Hillel member became highly critical of Israel\u2019s response to the October 7 Hamas attacks. \u201cShe asked for unbiased proof that Hamas is trying to eradicate the Jewish people,\u201d Siegmann said. \u201cI sent her the Hamas charter. And then she blocked me.\u201d Siegmann\u2019s father is Israeli and she is spending the summer in Israel. But her unflinching support of the Jewish state is separate from her views of the Israeli government, especially Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. \u201cI personally don\u2019t agree with how he is operating,\u201d she told us. \u201cI think he is trying to prolong the war. \u2026 I think there should be a new prime minister of Israel.\u201d Eyeing third-party options Like Siegmann, Wayne State law student Ibrahim Ghazal speaks with nuance often missing when politicians discuss the conflict and the campus protests. Ghazal is of Palestinian descent and has distant relatives in Gaza. But he is no fan of Hamas and acknowledges Israel\u2019s right to respond to terrorism. \u201cWe don\u2019t want human rights violations,\u201d Ghazal told us during a break in his finals work. \u201cIf you are going to conduct war, conduct it within the rule of law, international law. That\u2019s all people are asking for. Nothing more.\u201d Our November visit was just five weeks after the October 7 Hamas attacks, and already it was clear that Biden\u2019s standing in Michigan\u2019s Arab and Muslim communities was taking a pounding. Ghazal said the president\u2019s predicament is decidedly worse now. \u201cWhat is he going to do to earn our vote?\u201d Ghazal asked. \u201cSending unconditional aid to Israel with a disregard for any of the human rights violations that have been recorded by international agencies continuously, not just denying but preventing independent probes and investigations into possible war crimes that have been committed and reported. \u201cThat\u2019s an issue. If President Biden valued Palestinian lives, valued lives in Gaza, he would definitely allow for independent probes and investigations. If Biden wants to get certain votes, he needs to change course.\u201d Ghazal said he has been too busy with school to find time but plans to research third-party presidential options over the summer. Many friends are likewise looking third party, he said. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s definitely a conversation,\u201d Ghazal said. \u201cNobody wants to vote for Biden.\u201d That sentiment was backed up in Michigan\u2019s Democratic presidential primary. Biden lost to the \u201cuncommitted\u201d option on the ballot in the three Michigan communities with the highest number of voters of Arab descent: Dearborn, Dearborn Heights and Hamtramck. But Ghazal is no fan of Trump and said he understands sitting out or voting third party could help the presumptive GOP nominee in Michigan. But he is prepared to do so if he doesn\u2019t see a major shift from Biden. \u201cThe only reason I haven\u2019t closed the door is because I think he still has an ability to change course,\u201d Ghazal said. Comparing Biden to his GOP opponent New University of Michigan graduates Jalisatgi and Gray promise to be active Biden supporters in the fall even though their College Democrats stint is over and even though they, too, have some reservations about him. Jalisatgi is going home to Missouri for the summer. Gray is already working for a Michigan progressive group. Both hope a break from campus protests and demonstrations will give younger voters time and space to see a bigger picture. \u201cTo me, there isn\u2019t another option,\u201d Gray said. \u201cBecause I\u2019m certainly not voting for the guy who is in court right now and who incited an insurrection and put three extremists on the Supreme Court who took away [abortion] rights for the first time in history. Who\u2019s demonized the LGBTQ community of which I am a part. \u2026 I know there is frustration with Biden, and some of his decisions have been inexcusable, but the reality is we need to vote for him.\u201d At the moment, though, emotions are raw. \u201cHundreds of thousands of people in Gaza and across Palestine have been displaced. Have been starved, have been killed,\u201d Jalisatgi said. \u201cSo, I think it really does come down to people\u2019s own judgments on the motivation of the president.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/08/politics/young-michigan-voters-biden-israel-gaza/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_14_politics_biden-tariffs-chinese-imports", "text": "President Joe Biden is increasing tariffs on $18 billion in Chinese imports across a handful of sectors deemed strategic to national security \u2013 an attempt to cripple Beijing\u2019s development of critical technologies and instead prioritize US production. The increases will apply to imported steel and aluminum, legacy semiconductors, electric vehicles, battery components, critical minerals, solar cells, cranes and medical products. The new tariff rates \u2013 which range from 100% on electric vehicles, to 50% for solar components, to 25% for all other sectors \u2013 will take place over the next two years. \u201cChina\u2019s using the same playbook it has before to power its own growth at the expense of others,\u201d said Lael Brainard, director of the White House National Economic Council. \u201cChina\u2019s simply too big to play by its own rules.\u201d Announcing the new tariffs during a speech in the Rose Garden on Tuesday, Biden said he seeks \u201cfair competition with China, not conflict.\u201d \u201cThe fact is, American workers can out-work and out-compete anyone, as long as the competition is fair,\u201d Biden said. \u201cFor too long, it hasn\u2019t been fair.\u201d Biden\u2019s predecessor, former President Donald Trump, enacted a sweeping tariff program on $300 billion in Chinese imports during his administration, drawing authority from a provision in US trade law that allows tariffs to be used to stifle competition that would threaten national security interests. That same trade law also requires the effectiveness of such tariff programs to be evaluated every four years, and the Biden administration decision is the result of that study.\u00a0CNN previously reported\u00a0on the forthcoming changes. White House officials said they also redrew the parameters of the program to reflect the Biden administration\u2019s policy priorities, most notably the transition to clean energy. \u201cChina can\u2019t be the only country that produces clean technology for the world we need,\u201d a senior administration official said. \u201cWe need diversified, not concentrated, production of our most critical goods and technologies. \u2026 That\u2019s the kind of dynamic we think will produce resilient supply chains and clean technology.\u201d Electric vehicles imported from China will see their tariffs more than quadrupled from 27.5% to 100% \u2013 a policy lever meant to challenge Beijing\u2019s practice of encouraging aggressively low pricing by domestic EV manufacturers while levying a 40% tariff on US car imports. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to let China flood our market, making it impossible for American automobile manufacturers to compete fairly,\u201d Biden said on Tuesday. He added, \u201cFolks, look, I\u2019m determined that the future of electric vehicles will be made in America by union workers, period.\u201d Chinese manufacturer BYD\u2019s Seagull electric vehicle retails for roughly $10,000, a fraction of what rival American products cost. \u201cIt\u00a0was important to have a large enough step-up in the tariffs to ensure that we try to level the playing field,\u201d a second senior administration official said. Beijing has been known to introduce costly counterpunches. Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin told reporters Tuesday that China opposes \u201cthe unilateral imposition of tariffs which violate (World Trade Organization) rules, and will take all necessary actions to protect its legitimate rights.\u201d After Trump unveiled his wide-ranging tariff policy, China slapped tariffs on $101.4 billion in US exports, retaliation that\u00a0the Brookings Institute estimated\u00a0affected 294,000 American export-related jobs. Biden acknowledged Tuesday that he expects China will likely retaliate in some way to the newly announced tariffs against Beijing. \u201cIt\u2019s about saving American jobs,\u201d Biden said in an interview with Yahoo Finance posted Tuesday. \u201cI\u2019m sure China will talk a lot about it, but the fact is that China already is \u2026 way over their skis on this. I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll lead to any international conflict or anything like that but I think they\u2019ll probably try to figure out how they can raise tariffs maybe on products that are unrelated.\u201d Responding to news of the impending tariffs, Trump, speaking outside of the New York courtroom where he is standing trial on Tuesday, suggested Biden should have taken these steps at the beginning of his term. \u201cChina is eating our lunch right now,\u201d Trump said outside the courtroom. Asked to respond to Trump\u2019s statement after he signed the tariffs, Biden said his predecessor has \u201cbeen feeding them a long time.\u201d The White House has declined to speculate on how Beijing may hit back now. Officials have pointed to parallel investigations by partners in Europe, Brazil and Turkey as bolstering their position. \u201cChina is producing [goods] at a rate and with a trajectory that\u2019s far in excess of any plausible estimate of global demand,\u201d the first senior administration official said. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Secretary of State Antony Blinken each raised that point with Chinese counterparts during formal visits to the country in April.\u00a0Administration officials discussed releasing the changes in April to set the stage for a tariff speech Biden delivered mid-month, but ultimately held off to preserve the diplomatic visits, according to two sources familiar with the matter. On April 17, Biden spoke at the United Steelworkers headquarters in Pittsburgh, calling for a tripling of tariffs Trump placed on certain steel and aluminum products imported from China, and a new investigation into unfair shipbuilding practices. The Chinese government, Biden argued, is providing state money to Chinese steel companies to make more steel than the economy demands, pushing down the price and making it impossible for other companies to compete. \u201cThey\u2019re not competing,\u201d Biden said of China. \u201cThey\u2019re cheating.\u201d It\u2019s a message that plays favorably across the so-called blue wall, the handful of Midwest manufacturing-heavy states that will be critical for either candidate during an election where trade will once again figure prominently. It played less favorably across the Pacific, with China\u2019s Ministry of Commerce accusing the US of \u201cfalse accusations\u201d and \u201cwrong practices.\u201d In a separate executive order issued on Monday, Biden forced MineOne, a Chinese-backed cryptocurrency mining company, to sell its land near the Francis E. Warren Air Force Base in Wyoming. The order said MineOne\u2019s close proximity to the Air Force base raises national security risks due to the company\u2019s use of \u201cspecialized and foreign-sourced equipment potentially capable of facilitating surveillance and espionage activities.\u201d The decision comes amid recent attempts by Washington to limit Chinese companies\u2019 influence on US consumers and national security, especially ahead of the 2024 presidential elections in November.

Sai Varshith Kandula pleaded guilty to one count of\u00a0willful injury or depredation of property of the United States, according to a Justice Department news release. The charge carries a maximum prison sentence of 10 years. Kandula, 20, is set to be sentenced August 23. Kandula was born in Chandanagar, India, according to the release, and was a lawful permanent resident of the US with a green card at the time of the attempted attack. According to prosecutors, Kandula flew to Washington,\u00a0DC,\u00a0on May 22, 2023, from St. Louis. He rented a U-Haul after arriving at Dulles International Airport and drove to the White House, where he crashed into barriers protecting the property at the intersection of H Street NW and 16th Street NW just after 9:30 p.m. ET. Kandula then exited his damaged vehicle and waved a banner with a Nazi swastika on it before being arrested by US Park Police and Secret Service, prosecutors said. The crash caused $4,322 in damage to the National Park Service and more than $50,000 in damage to U-Haul International, according to the release. No agency or White House personnel were injured in the incident, the Secret Service said after the attack. Kandula wanted to gain access to the White House to \u201cseize political power\u201d\u00a0and replace it with a dictatorship backed by the ideology of Nazi Germany, according to prosecutors, and\u00a0he\u00a0had been planning the attack for weeks. He admitted to investigators after his arrest that he would have arranged for President Joe Biden to be killed to accomplish his objective, according to the release. A month before renting the truck, Kandula had contacted a Virginia security company to request 25 armed guards and an armored convoy, according to prosecutors \u2014 an effort that failed along with his attempts to rent other long trucks, including a commercial tractor-trailer truck and a dump truck.

{"id": "2024_05_14_politics_new-federal-student-loan-interest-rate", "text": "Borrowing to pay for college is about to get more expensive: The interest rate on new federal student loans for undergraduates during the upcoming 2024-25 academic year will be the highest in 12 years. The federal student loan interest rate will be 6.53% for undergraduate students, up from 5.5% for the current year. The interest rate has not been that high on any undergraduate loans since the 2012-13 school year. Graduate students will see an 8.08% interest rate this coming academic year, up from 7.05%. And PLUS loans, which are available to both parents and graduate students, will come with a 9.08% interest rate, an increase from 8.05%. The rates for graduate students and parents have not been as high since before July 2006, when the government started setting fixed rates for student loans. Prior to that, most federal student loans had variable rates. The higher student loan interest rates will make it more costly for borrowers to pay back their debt \u2013 and could cause a problem for President Joe Biden who is working to win over as many young voters as he can before the November election. To be clear, the president does not set the federal student loan interest rates himself. The rates are set annually and are based on the 10-year Treasury note auction held every May. The increase isn\u2019t a total surprise since the Federal Reserve has kept the nation\u2019s benchmark interest rate at a 23-year high as it waits for inflation to cool. Biden has already canceled more federal student loan debt \u2013 nearly $160 billion \u2013 than during any other administration, but debt relief for college grads doesn\u2019t make education less expensive for current and future students. Still, Biden\u2019s new student loan repayment plan, known as SAVE (Saving on a Valuable Education), could make it easier for current and future borrowers to pay off their federal student loan debt, despite the interest rate hike. Launched last year, the income-driven repayment plan can lower monthly bills for enrolled borrowers and reduce the amount they pay back over the lifetime of their loans. Plus, unpaid interest will not accrue as long as the enrolled borrower makes a full monthly payment. That means that a borrower\u2019s balance won\u2019t increase even if the monthly payment doesn\u2019t cover the monthly interest. The SAVE program is estimated to cost as much as\u00a0$475 billion\u00a0over 10 years, according to one estimate, and is facing legal challenges from two groups of Republican-led states that argue Biden doesn\u2019t have the power to create the repayment plan. Since the fall, the Biden administration has also been\u00a0working on a set of new proposals\u00a0to deliver relief to certain groups of borrowers. The proposals aren\u2019t as broad as the student loan forgiveness program that Biden initially planned and was struck down by the Supreme Court last year. But if successfully implemented, the new initiatives could cancel up to $20,000 for borrowers whose balances have grown due to unpaid interest on their loans, regardless of their income. Those new proposals have yet to be finalized, but some could go into effect as soon as this fall.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/14/politics/new-federal-student-loan-interest-rate/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_14_politics_voting-rights-act-galveston-5th-circuit", "text": "Conservative judges on the federal appeals court that oversees a large swath of the South questioned a longstanding legal mandate in the circuit that allows multiple minority groups\u00a0to join together to seek representation under the Voting Rights Act. Judge Edith Jones\u00a0of the\u00a05th US Circuit Court of Appeals said that if it was \u201cobvious\u201d the Voting Rights Act contemplated\u00a0so-called coalition districts that aim to bolster minority voting power, the Supreme Court would have said so in previous rulings about the law. \u201cBut it isn\u2019t,\u201d she told Justice Department attorney Nicolas Riley, who is defending the current precedent and how it was used by a Donald Trump-appointed judge to strike down the county commission map of Galveston, Texas. The trial judge agreed with the Biden administration \u2013 and the civil rights groups and Black and Hispanic voters that also sued over the plan \u2013 that the commission\u00a0map drawn by Republicans was a \u201cclear violation\u201d of the Voting Rights Act. US District Judge Jeffrey Vincent Brown last year struck down the new map, saying that how the commissioners went about their \u201cobliteration\u201d of a majority-minority district was \u201cstark,\u201d \u201cjarring,\u201d \u201cegregious\u201d and \u201cmean-spirited.\u201d The 5th\u00a0Circuit has already voted to pause Brown\u2019s ruling, as it considers reversing the coalition district precedent. The new GOP-drawn map will be in effect for the 2024 election. During Tuesday\u2019s arguments before the full slate of circuit judges, an attorney for the challengers, Chad Dunn, said that the Galveston case was not an apt vehicle for overturning the precedent. Galveston is arguing the text of the Voting Rights Act, in its reference to a \u201cclass of citizens\u201d in the relevant\u00a0provision,\u00a0did not contemplate multiple\u00a0racial or ethnic\u00a0groups joining together to bring redistricting cases under the law. Justice Department Attorney Nicolas Reily\u00a0argued Tuesday that \u201cclass\u201d in that part of the statute referred to the class of voters being harmed by racial discrimination, including when that discrimination was aimed at multiple\u00a0racial groups at once. Obama appointed Judge Stephen Higginson, questioning Galveston\u2019s\u00a0attorney Joseph Nixon, said ending coalition claims would force\u00a0people of mixed racial or ethnic affiliations,\u00a0such as Afro-Latinos, to choose one affiliation over another to\u00a0be protected under the Voting Rights Act. \u201cI think you are actually helping clarify why we need a bright line,\u201d Nixon said in response. For roughly 30 years, Precinct 3 of Galveston\u2019s county commission \u2013 the governing body of the county \u2013\u00a0was drawn to group together Black and Hispanic communities, which together make up nearly 39% of the county\u2019s population and mostly vote for Democrats. After the 2021 Census, the Republican-led county commission broke up that district, locking in four majority-white districts instead. Among the commission\u2019s actions were to hold its lone meeting about its redistricting plans 27 miles away from the county courthouse that usually hosts major commission meetings and to exclude the only Black member at the time (and its only Democrat) from the map-drawing process. However, due to some eyebrow-raising procedural maneuvering last year by 5th Circuit Court \u2013 with the Supreme Court refusing to intervene \u2013 the contested map will be in effect for the 2024 election as the 5th Circuit considers reversing the\u00a035-year-old precedent that was the foundation of Brown\u2019s ruling. The lawyers spearheading the lawsuit told CNN that the case\u00a0shows exactly why the Voting Rights Act contemplated scenarios in which coalitions of multiple ethnic groups are harmed by discriminatory map-drawing. Overturning the current precedent, they say, will encourage map-drawers across the South to break up majority-minority districts made up of multiple ethnic or racial groups. \u201cRecognizing that communities of color often suffer the effects of discrimination together is what\u2019s at stake here,\u201d said Valencia Richardson, a legal counsel for the Campaign Legal Center, which is representing voters challenging the map. Their opponents argue that Congress did not intend for multiple \u201cclasses\u201d of minorities to be considered together when assessing a map\u2019s Voting Rights Act compliance. They claim that the requirement for coalition districts has exacerbated the seemingly endless litigation over redistricting. \u201cAt the heart of this case is the meaning of the Voting Rights Act: Was it meant to restore justice and return things to where they belong, or, is it a political weapon that improperly uses race to distribute power?\u201d said J. Christian Adams, an attorney representing Galveston County, in an email to CNN. Black and Latino voices \u2018extinguished,\u2019 judge says The 2021 map split up the long-established Precinct 3, spreading those minority voters across the four total commission precincts. White voters \u2013 who overwhelmingly vote Republican in the county \u2013 now make up a sizeable majority of all four districts. \u201cLooking \u2013 as this court must \u2013 at the totality of the circumstances, it is stunning how completely the county extinguished the Black and Latino communities\u2019 voice on its commissioners court during 2021\u2019s redistricting,\u201d Brown said in his decision. Brown, who was confirmed by the Senate in 2019 with only Republican support, has previously ruled against the Biden administration in legal disputes over federal Covid-19 vaccine mandates and environmental regulations. The 2021 redistricting cycle was the first that the county was not subject to the so-called preclearance under in the Voting Rights Act, which had\u00a0required that localities with a history of racially discriminatory voting practices get the approval of the Justice Department or a federal court when adopting new political maps. Brown noted how the commission\u2019s Republican members \u2013\u00a0led by the county\u2019s chief executive, County Judge Mark Henry \u2013 departed from the county\u2019s usual redistricting process in a number of ways. The Galveston Republicans opted to shut the public \u2013 and the commissioner representing Precinct 3, the commission\u2019s sole Democrat and, at the time, its only member of color \u2013 out of most of the process, the judge found. The commission opted to have only one public meeting about the redistricting plan, compared to the five held after the 2010 Census. That lone 2021 meeting was also not held at the centrally located county courthouse typically used for major commission business, but at a building 27 miles from Galveston that was much smaller and more difficult to access. An estimated 150 to 200 people showed up to the meeting, with many of them \u2013 including elderly residents and people in wheelchairs \u2013 left lining the hallways due to the lack of space. At the meeting, Henry and the other commissioners showed \u201ca disregard for public input from the minority communities and those critical of the enacted plan\u2019s discriminatory effect,\u201d Brown wrote. In 2022, a second Black member joined the commission, filling a seat left open by the death of a Republican member representing a precinct of\u00a0mostly white voters. The new commissioner, Robin Armstrong, is a Republican. The federal judge in the redistricting case said that his addition to the commission was irrelevant to the legal dispute. \u201cHis precinct is predominantly Anglo, and several witnesses \u2013 including Commissioner Armstrong himself \u2013 testified that he would not be the candidate of choice of Black and Latino voters,\u201d the judge said. Armstrong did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment. If\u00a0the appeals court overturns its precedent and rules against a coalition district mandate, such a decision will be deeply felt in the three states covered by the circuit\u2013 Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi \u2013 which were required to get federal pre-approval for their maps before a 2013 Supreme Court ruling dismantled that mandate. Adams, who is also president and general counsel of the Public Interest Legal Foundation,\u00a0told CNN via email that \u201cthe 5th\u00a0Circuit should make clear that race cannot be used for political gain\u201d and he pointed to how other courts \u201chave not allowed these submajority districts.\u201d \u201cThe law speaks in singular terms, not stacked minority groups,\u201d he said. Supreme Court has already sided with county After the 5th Circuit put Brown\u2019s ruling on pause, the challengers to Galveston\u2019s new map\u00a0asked the Supreme Court last year to block the 2021 plan for the coming election \u2013 a request that was rejected over the dissent of the three liberal justices. The 5th Circuit \u201cwent far beyond its proper authority,\u201d Justice Elena Kagan, joined by the court\u2019s other two liberals, wrote, because the appeals court was imposing a map\u00a0\u201cacknowledged to violate current law \u2026 on the theory that the Circuit might someday change that law.\u201d The current 5th Circuit precedent allowing coalition districts dates back to 1988. At the trial in the Galveston case, the challengers had to show that the Black and Hispanic voters had a shared history of suffering discrimination in the county and that they had consistently voted for the same candidates. \u201cIf racial groups lack the cohesion derived from common experiences and interests, their claims will fail of their own accord. That outcome need not be assumed in advance,\u201d the Justice Department wrote in court filings. The county argues that because Galveston\u2019s Latino and Black populations are, individually, too small to bring a successful VRA claim, the lawsuit must fail. In court filings, it said that there was no \u201cindication in the language or history of the VRA that it is was meant to protect two or more minority groups together, when neither could raise such a claim individually.\u201d Chad Ennis \u2013 the vice president of the Honest Elections Project, a conservative group that works on voting issues and that filed friend of the court briefs calling for the end of coalition districts \u2013 told CNN that legal disputes over coalition districts end up being \u201ca battle of the experts.\u201d Ennis said that the current precedent was fueling protracted court fights over redistricting. \u201cTrying to figure out, \u2018Well can we lump [multiple groups] together? Should we lump them together?\u2019 becomes very difficult,\u201d he said. Supporters of the 5th Circuit precedent say that the Galveston case shows how rare it is for these types of coalition claims to be successful in the first place, and that the dispute exemplifies the kind of discriminatory behavior the VRA was intended to address. \u201cIf defendants get their way, it would essentially greenlight the destruction of majority minority districts throughout the South,\u201d said Hilary\u00a0Harris\u00a0Klein, a senior counsel for Southern Coalition for Social Justice, who is representing some of the challengers in the lawsuit. \u201cIt would be devastating for minority voters as devastating as it was for Galveston\u2019s Black and Latino voters.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/14/politics/voting-rights-act-galveston-5th-circuit/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_10_politics_biden-challenges-2024-analysis", "text": "If Joe Biden wins a second term later this year, he will have defied one of the most complex political environments for a president seeking reelection in years. At home and abroad, he is facing the kind of headwinds that would normally cast severe doubt on his chances of convincing voters that they should send him back to the White House. Biden\u2019s difficult dynamic was on show in an exclusive interview with CNN this week, in the swing state of Wisconsin, which he only won by around 20,000 votes in 2020 and that could be decisive again in November. The president is facing wars in the Middle East and Ukraine that carry a constant threat of escalation and repeatedly throw up challenges to his credibility as a leader. At home, Biden is beset by campus protests triggered by the Israeli offensive in Gaza and a revolt by some progressive and young voters vital to his coalition. More broadly, the electorate isn\u2019t yet buying his \u201cmorning in America\u201d vibe. They\u2019re suffering from high prices and interest rates that confound his reassurances that the economy is in great shape and mask a strong legislative record that stands comparison with any recent president. Then there\u2019s the challenge of being the oldest president in history, running for a second term that would end when he is 86. Biden\u2019s saving grace, however, may be that Donald Trump \u2013 his opponent in a 2020 election rematch that Americans have repeatedly told pollsters they don\u2019t want \u2013 may be saddled with even more vulnerabilities than he is. Trump spent this week in a Manhattan court listening to embarrassing testimony about an alleged liaison he had with an adult film star in 2006 that is now at the center of a hush money trial. New York prosecutors claim he falsified business records to hide a payment to Stormy Daniels in an early act of election interference in 2016. He\u2019s denied the affair and pleaded not guilty in the case. Trump also has a habit of alienating the key suburban voters likely to decide which of the two one-term presidents wins a second mandate in November. His recent warnings that he couldn\u2019t rule out violence after the 2024 election, and his refusal to say he\u2019d accept the result, revived dark memories of his attempt to steal the 2020 election and underscored his fundamental threat to democracy. Trump\u2019s base voters have no problems either with his criminal trials or his false claims that he was cheated out of office. But the most recent midterm and presidential elections suggest that he does scare off large sectors of the general electorate. Trump has also talked himself into a difficult corner on abortion \u2013 one of the few issues where Biden outpolls him and which Democrats believe could enthuse their voters and produce the kind of turnout that could swamp the ex-president in November. Trump\u2019s role in building a generational conservative majority on the Supreme Court is coming back to haunt him after the justices overturned the constitutional right to an abortion. While Trump insists the issue must be left to the states, it\u2019s offering Democrats an opening every time a Republican legislature or conservative court delivers an extreme new anti-abortion measure or decision. Israel may be far from the biggest worry for Trump\u2019s campaign Polls consistently show that voters care most about the economy. And the president\u2019s ratings on the issue are underwater. A CNN poll in April showed that Biden had a 34% rating on the economy \u2014 and 29% on inflation \u2014 as voters say economic concerns are more important to them when choosing a candidate than they were in each of the past two presidential elections. And voters who say the economy is very important to their vote backed Trump over Biden 62% to 30%. This deficit for the president comes despite three years of solid growth and job creation numbers. But inflation, a corrosive political force that can ruin political careers and that only voters who remember the early 1980s have experienced before, has bequeathed a period of high interest rates. This is proving punishing to home and car buyers, for instance. And many Americans still get a shock every time they go to the grocery store. In his interview with CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett, the president pushed back on the notion that the economy is in poor shape while expressing some understanding for the pain caused by high prices. But he was still defensive on the issue \u2014 recalling some previous presidents who appeared irked that voters weren\u2019t appreciating their efforts. Asked by Burnett when he would restore consumer confidence, Biden replied: \u201cWe have already turned it around,\u201d then added, \u201cThe polling data has been wrong all along. You guys do a poll at CNN. How many folks you have to call to get one response? The idea that we\u2019re in a situation where things are so bad \u2026 we have created more jobs. We have made \u2013 we\u2019re in a situation where people have access to good-paying jobs.\u201d Biden has also balked at Trump\u2019s efforts to conjure nostalgia for the economy in his first term \u2013 before jobs and growth went into free fall during a once-in-a-century pandemic. \u201cLet me say it this way, when I started this administration, people were saying there\u2019s going to be a collapse of the economy. We have the strongest economy in the world. Let me say it again, in the world,\u201d the president said. But telling voters things are great when they don\u2019t feel they are is a questionable political strategy. Any time a president looks like he isn\u2019t fully in touch with the reality of voters\u2019 lives, he\u2019s on dangerous ground. In 1992, for instance, President George H.W. Bush was running for reelection. He was asked in a campaign debate, \u201cHow can you find a cure for the economic problems of the common people if you have no experience of what is ailing them?\u201d Bush got off to a bad start by looking at his watch, making it look like he\u2019d rather be anywhere else in the world. He then offered a halting and confusing answer that ended with: \u201cOf course you feel it when you are president of the United States and that is why I am trying to do something about it.\u201d His rival, Bill Clinton, then stood up and gave a national audience a taste of his burning \u201cfeel your pain\u201d political talent. He directly addressed the questioner, said that as Arkansas governor he knew by name many people who lost their jobs, and told the nation: \u201cThis decision better be about what kind of economic theory you want. Not just people saying I want to go fix it.\u201d A few months later, Clinton was in the White House. Biden has more time than Bush to convince voters that better economic times are ahead, and he\u2019d be considerably helped if the Federal Reserve begins to ease rates in the summer. He\u2019s been contrasting his own humble origins with Trump\u2019s billionaire lifestyle in recent weeks, trying to puncture the idea that the ex-president cares more about working Americans than he does, while warning his predecessor would destroy the Affordable Care Act if he gets back in the Oval Office. \u201cI look at it from a position \u2013 not being facetious \u2013 from a Scranton perspective,\u201d Biden told Burnett. \u201cHe looks at it from a Mar-a-Lago perspective. He wants to give more significant tax cuts to the super wealthy.\u201d And Biden is fortunate in that he faces a rival with his own massive liabilities, rather than a young rising star with a gift for coining a middle-class economic narrative like Clinton. Biden\u2019s path becomes even more complex But if anything, the president\u2019s path to reelection is becoming even more complicated.\u00a0He\u2019s now locked in a showdown with the prime minister of Israel \u2014 always a treacherous proposition for US leaders. This crisis risks playing into Trump\u2019s contention that the world and the nation is spinning out of control and needs a strongman to fix it. The fracture with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu occurred after the president warned in the CNN interview that he would halt the transfer of some weapons to Israel if it went ahead with a major offensive into the Gazan city of Rafah. Biden has been under enormous pressure from progressive activists, supporters on Capitol Hill and Arab American voters in the key swing state of Michigan to rein in Netanyahu after the deaths of many thousands of Palestinian civilians in Israel\u2019s war against Hamas following the October 7 terror attacks that killed 1,200 people. Campus protests have, meanwhile, caught Biden between young and progressive voters who are furious with his support for Israel in the war, and moderates who might be susceptible to his predecessor\u2019s chaos narrative. It\u2019s not clear that heated Republicans attacks on Biden over Israel Thursday will seriously wound him with his own voters. But the tone of the criticism bolstered a wider Republican narrative that Biden is weak and incapable of stabilizing an increasingly restless world. \u201cThat\u2019s a failure of leadership. That is cowardice, that is answering, trying to make a political calculus here that it helps him get out from underwater,\u201d Republican Sen. Thom Tillis said. The North Carolinian\u2019s colleague from Missouri, GOP Sen. Josh Hawley, added: \u201cThis is the message to our allies that, you know, if it\u2019s politically inconvenient for the president to send you arms then, you know, sorry, you\u2019re on your own.\u201d Biden has tried to insulate himself from the political impact of the protests with centrist voters by arguing that while the right to demonstrate is constitutionally guaranteed, any property damage from students occupying college buildings is unacceptable. And in a speech on Capitol Hill memorializing victims of the Holocaust earlier this week, he condemned examples of antisemitism reported at some of the protests. He warned that too many people were \u201cdenying, downplaying, rationalizing and ignoring the horrors of the Holocaust and October 7.\u201d Still, polls show that the Israel-Hamas conflict is well down the list of issues that most concern voters \u2014 including the young voters most often cited as deserting Biden in droves over the conflict. But in an election that could come down to thousands of votes in a few states, the potential for defections or no shows from angry Democratic voters is an alarming one for the president.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/10/politics/biden-challenges-2024-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "politics"}}

{"id": "2024_05_14_politics_takeaways-day-17-trump-hush-money-trial-michael-cohen", "text": "Donald Trump\u2019s attorney Todd Blanche began his confrontation with Michael Cohen on Tuesday by throwing the former fixer\u2019s language back in his face. Blanche confirmed the two had never spoken, but asked Cohen whether he knew who he was already, since Cohen \u201cwent on TikTok and called me a crying little sh*t\u201d just before the trial began. \u201cSounds like something I would say,\u201d responded Cohen, Trump\u2019s former lawyer and fixer. The question set the tone for the cross-examination of the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s key witness in the hush money trial against the former president. For roughly two hours, Blanche began a cross-examination to try to discredit Cohen\u2019s allegations against Trump. Blanche confirmed his questioning will take most of the day when court picks up Thursday. Over two days, Cohen has\u00a0detailed the hush money scheme\u00a0involving adult film actress\u00a0Stormy Daniels\u00a0before the 2016 election, walked\u00a0the jury\u00a0through the $130,000 he paid at Trump\u2019s direction and described his fallout with the former president. Cohen\u2019s testimony ties together the prosecution\u2019s allegations that\u00a0Trump broke the law by falsifying business records\u00a0to reimburse Cohen and conceal the payment. Trump has pleaded not guilty and denies having an affair with Daniels. If Cohen gets off the stand Thursday, the prosecution appears poised to rest its case against Trump. Assistant District Attorney Joshua Steinglass confirmed to Judge Juan Merchan on Tuesday that Cohen is the final witness for the prosecution. Here are the takeaways from Day 17 of the Trump hush money trial: Blanche tries to use Cohen\u2019s words to discredit him Blanche\u2019s opening question was just the first in a series of colorful quotes from Cohen that Blanche raised to jurors to try to paint Cohen as someone who hated Trump and who was hellbent on getting revenge while making money off the former president and trying to get his prison sentence reviewed. Blanche had plenty of material to work with. Cohen has written two books, \u201cDisloyal\u201d and \u201cRevenge,\u201d and has recorded hundreds of podcasts \u2013 confirming he mentions Trump in every episode of \u201cMea Culpa.\u201d Regarding Cohen\u2019s first podcast in 2020, Blanche asked whether he called Trump a \u201cboorish cartoon misogynist.\u201d \u201cSounds like something I would say,\u201d Cohen responded again. Blanche then asked whether Cohen called Trump a \u201cCheeto-dusted cartoon villain.\u201d \u201cThat also sounds like something that I said,\u201d Cohen said. Blanche fired more lines at Cohen, asking whether he said on his podcast in 2020: \u201cI truly f***ing hope Donald Trump ends up in prison.\u201d \u201cSounds more like my language on \u2018Mea Culpa,\u2019\u201d Cohen responded. Blanche then asked Cohen to listen to audio from the podcast, which Cohen, the judge, the lawyers and Trump all put on headphones to hear. Blanche continued by asking Cohen how much money he had made from his books, his podcasts and the TikTok account he launched six months ago. The upshot of the questioning was that Cohen was making a living off attacking Trump after he lost his law license following his 2018 guilty plea to charges including campaign finance violations linked to the hush money scheme. Cohen tried to put another spin on it. Asked what his goal was of putting out a TikTok nearly every night, he said: \u201cBuild an audience, to create a community, to really vent because I have a difficult time sleeping, so I found an outlet.\u201d The tug-of-war over Cohen\u2019s words is sure to continue into Thursday as Blanche tries to convince the jury not to trust Cohen\u2019s allegations related to the case itself. Blanche questions Cohen on his drastically shifting views about Trump Blanche took Cohen through the evolution of the former fixer\u2019s feelings about Trump, pinpointing the shift from admiration to hatred in the summer of 2018, when Cohen turned on his former boss. Asked whether he was \u201cobsessed\u201d with Trump, Cohen said, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say obsessed. I admired him tremendously.\u201d He went on, \u201cI can\u2019t recall using that word. I wouldn\u2019t say it would be wrong.\u201d Cohen also used his admiration to try to explain his shift, responding to a series of questions about the nice things he had said about Trump by saying: \u201cAt that time I was knee-deep into the cult of Donald Trump, yes.\u201d Blanche read a list of compliments Cohen paid Trump publicly in 2015 and 2016, including calling Trump \u201ca good man,\u201d \u201ca man who cares deeply about his family\u201d and \u201ca man who tells it straight.\u201d Throughout cross-examination Blanche asked Cohen pointed questions about when he was telling the truth or lying when it came to Trump. \u201cYou were telling the truth, correct?\u201d Blanche asked in regards to the compliments Cohen gave Trump. \u201cThat\u2019s how I felt,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cI was expressing my feelings, so yes, it would be the truth.\u201d Cohen confirmed his feelings about Trump changed in the summer of 2018 around the time he pleaded guilty to federal charges. Trump\u2019s attorney pushed Cohen on his motivations since turning on the former president, suggesting Cohen is now driven by revenge and money. Blanche quoted an excerpt of Cohen\u2019s book \u201cDisloyal\u201d to him: \u201cI wanted it all: power, the good life, public acclaim, fame, big deals, fast cars, private planes, the excess and glamor and zest for life.\u201d \u201cThose are my words, yes,\u201d Cohen confirmed. There were no fireworks from Trump or Cohen on Tuesday afternoon during the cross-examination. Trump\u2019s former fixer kept his measured manner for the more than two hours of questioning from Blanche. Trump, meanwhile, rarely engaged with Cohen\u2019s testimony. He turned to Cohen initially when Blanche began but spent most of the time with his eyes closed, appearing to zone out, with his mouth hanging open at some points. Occasionally, Trump would look in Cohen\u2019s direction, craning his neck at one point when Cohen was asked whether he lied to special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s office in 2018. Cohen walks jurors through his decision to cease being loyal to Trump In the morning, prosecutors wrapped up their questioning of Cohen, walking him in detail through his decision to stop being loyal to Trump \u2013 and to stop lying for Trump \u2013 when he pleaded guilty to federal charges in 2018. Cohen explained that he lied on Trump\u2019s behalf to Congress in 2017 during the Russia investigation, and that he was \u201cmisleading\u201d when he told the Federal Election Commission about the $130,000 payment to Daniels in a 2018 letter. After he sent the letter to the FEC in February 2018, Cohen testified that Trump\u2019s then-attorney Jay Sekulow sent him a message saying, \u201cClient says thanks for what you do.\u201d Cohen confirmed that the client was Trump. Throughout the testimony explaining the events leading up to his guilty plea, Cohen described how he was given reassurance from Trump\u2019s allies \u2013 and Trump\u2019s tweets \u2013 that his loyalty was appreciated and that he should not \u201cflip\u201d on Trump. After the FBI seized Cohen\u2019s phones and records in a search warrant in 2018, \u201cI received a phone call from President Trump,\u201d he testified. \u201cI wanted obviously him to know what was taking place. And he said to me, \u2018Don\u2019t worry. I\u2019m the president of the United States. There\u2019s nothing here. Everything\u2019s going to be OK. Stay tough.\u2019\u201d It was the last time they spoke, Cohen said. Ultimately, Cohen described how a conversation with his family in August 2018 convinced him to change his tune, plead guilty and tell the truth about Trump, he said. \u201cI made a decision based again on the conversation I had with my family that I would not lie for President Trump anymore.\u201d Prosecutor Susan Hoffinger used several questions to walk Cohen through his flip-flops of past statements on issues such as his federal tax charges in an attempt to get ahead of the cross-examination sure to keep the focus on those discrepancies. She ended her questioning of Cohen by asking him whether he regretted his past association with Trump. \u201cI regret doing things for him that I should not have, lying, bullying people in order to effectuate a goal,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cI don\u2019t regret working with the Trump Organization. As I expressed before, some very interesting, great times. But to keep the loyalty and to do the things that he had asked me to do, I violated my moral compass, and I suffered the penalty, as has my family.\u201d More Trump allies flock to court Trump\u2019s Manhattan courtroom seems to be the hottest club in New York for aspiring Republican politicians. Last week, it was Florida Sen. Rick Scott who joined Trump in court. On Monday, Sen. J.D. Vance of Ohio was sitting two rows behind the former president. Tuesday saw the biggest group of politicians \u2013 and at least one potential VP candidate \u2013 make the trek up to the 15th floor of the Manhattan courthouse to show their support of Trump. The list included Trump\u2019s onetime presidential-rival-turned-VP-hopeful North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, along with House Speaker Mike Johnson, Florida Reps. Byron Donalds and Cory Mills, and former presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy. All were seated behind Trump for much of the day except for Johnson, who appeared in the hallway with Trump for his morning news conference but did not go inside the courtroom. (The Louisiana Republican\u2019s office said he went into the overflow room before he held a news conference outside the courthouse.) Lara Trump, Trump\u2019s daughter-in-law and the new co-chair of the Republican National Committee, also attended court Tuesday, along with Trump\u2019s son Eric Trump, who has become a semi-regular presence in the courtroom over the past two weeks. At one point, when the politicians reentered the courtroom after giving a news conference outside before lunch, the judge stared at them, looking annoyed, as they took their seats while Cohen was in the middle of testifying. At their news conference outside, the Republican politicians all denounced the proceedings they had come to witness, just as those who have come before them have done. \u201cI learned a lot from being in there in person,\u201d Ramaswamy said. \u201cIt is one of the most depressing places I have been in my life, but it is fitting because the only thing more depressing than the environment of that courtroom is what\u2019s actually happening in there.\u201d Trump acknowledged Tuesday morning that he appreciated the show of support. \u201cI do have a lot of surrogates and they are speaking very beautifully,\u201d Trump said before going into court.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/14/politics/takeaways-day-17-trump-hush-money-trial-michael-cohen/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_11_politics_rfk-jr-debate-stage", "text": "The 2024 election cycle got a lot weirder this week when it was revealed that independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. once had a worm enter and eat part of his brain. Kennedy, who says he has recovered from the worm injuries, went on to claim that he could eat \u201c5 more brain worms and still beat\u201d former President Donald Trump and President Joe Biden in a debate. Such stories and quotes might make you think that Kennedy is a sideshow this election year, but nothing could be further from the truth. A look at the polling reveals Kennedy is polling better than any independent candidate since Ross Perot in 1996, even as many of his own supporters aren\u2019t sure what he stands for. And he might do what Perot failed to do before him in 1996: make the fall debates against the major party nominees. Last week, a CNN/SSRS poll made news by painting a dire picture for Biden. He trailed Trump by 6 points in a one-on-one match-up. Trump\u2019s lead jumped to 9 points over Biden when Kennedy, Green Party candidate Jill Stein and independent Cornel West were included in the ballot test. Less publicized was that Kennedy got 16% in the survey. There wasn\u2019t a single poll that had Green Party nominee Ralph Nader in 2000 or Libertarian Party nominee Gary Johnson in 2016 with this level of support. This 16% is important because the polling threshold for candidates to be included in the fall presidential debates has been 15% for the past 24 years. While other polls haven\u2019t been nearly as kind to Kennedy, pretty much all of them have him hitting double-digits when he is a named option. (To make the debate stage, candidates must also appear on state ballots totaling at least 270 electoral votes. This seems more than doable for Kennedy.) The survey average will be key because Kennedy will need to be at 15% on average to make the debates. Kennedy so far has been averaging about 13% in the polls from media entities that the commission included in their 2020 average. I should point out that third party and independent candidates tend to see their polling decline over the course of the campaign. This year, I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s anywhere close to a guarantee as both Biden and Trump have significantly higher negative ratings than positive ratings. That said, Kennedy is a relative unknown. An NBC News poll, which explicitly offers \u201cneutral\u201d and \u201cdon\u2019t know\u201d as an option, found that the plurality (39%) said either \u201cneutral\u201d or \u201cdon\u2019t know\u201d when voters rated Kennedy. Among those with a positive or negative opinion, 29% gave a negative one and 32% gave a positive one. This -3 point net rating was actually the best of any public figure that NBC News tested in that poll. Trump and Biden came in with -15 point and -14 point net ratings respectively. But given that 39% of voters still didn\u2019t have an opinion of Kennedy \u2013 either positive or negative \u2013 his net rating can best be described as \u201csoft\u201d. Indeed, I\u2019m not even sure his supporters or potential supporters understand his platform. Kennedy has been chastised by many for his unfounded views on vaccines and Covid-19. It was one of the first things that was written about him when he declared that he was running for president last year. A recent Monmouth University poll informed voters that Kennedy \u201csupports claims that autism is linked to vaccines and has said that Covid is targeted to attack people of certain races\u201d and asked whether they had known about these stances before taking the poll. Only 55% of voters knew about Kennedy\u2019s beliefs. More interestingly, just 27% of people who said they would definitely or probably support Kennedy indicated that they knew about these stances. The vast majority, 73%, did not. In other words, the people who were potential backers of Kennedy\u2019s didn\u2019t know what a lot of people would consider to be a key part of his position portfolio. The voters who knew most about Kennedy\u2019s positions were the ones who said they would definitely vote against him. Now, it\u2019s quite possible that Kennedy voters will stick by him the more they hear about his positions. (The Monmouth poll suggested that this was a real possibility.) For many, Kennedy may be more than his vaccine position. The fact that so few of his potential backers did know about vaccine and Covid-19 statements, however, points to the fact that he remains largely undefined. He could be more vulnerable to attack ads from opponents than the usual presidential candidate. This lines up with what we\u2019ve been seeing from Trump and his advocates: they\u2019re going after Kennedy. National polling for the most part has, after all, shown Kennedy voters prefer Trump to Biden, though not uniformly. An average of recent CNN and Quinnipiac University polls puts Trump up low double-digits in a two-way matchup among those who selected Kennedy when third party and independent candidates were included. That may not seem like a lot, and it usually wouldn\u2019t be. But in a country where elections have been so close recently, any little bit could make the difference. Don\u2019t expect Biden or Trump to allow Kennedy to surprise them. For now, Kennedy continues to be a viable option for many Americans. We\u2019ll see if it stays that way.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/11/politics/rfk-jr-debate-stage/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_04_09_politics_rfk-jr-campaign-official-january-6-trump", "text": "A New York-based campaign official for Robert F. Kennedy Jr. who raised the possibility that voting for the independent presidential candidate would help Donald Trump defeat President Joe Biden previously promoted false claims that the 2020 election was rigged\u00a0and attended \u201cStop the Steal\u201d rallies after the election,\u00a0including\u00a0the rally on January 6, 2021, in Washington, DC, that preceded the deadly riot at the US Capitol. Rita Palma, who has identified herself as the Kennedy campaign\u2019s state director in New York, also\u00a0repeatedly called\u00a0Trump her \u201cfavorite president,\u201d according to tweets along with comments she posted on\u00a0the conservative social media site Parler that have since been made private. According to a KFILE examination of those now-private posts, Palma also posed for a photo at the former Trump International Hotel in Washington, DC, alongside Sidney Powell \u2013 the pro-Trump attorney who pleaded guilty in Georgia\u2019s election subversion case. In February 2021,\u00a0Palma tweeted her support\u00a0for Trump as a presidential candidate in 2024 and even asked whether he could run for a third term in 2028 \u2013 which is not constitutionally allowed as a president can serve only two full terms. \u201c#Trump2024 Can he run in 2028 too?\u201d she tweeted, posting a meme that said she would vote for\u00a0Trump in 2024. In one comment, Palma dismissed suggestions from then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell that Trump was to blame for violence at the Capitol. \u201cActually the fault lies with the rigged election. Genius,\u201d she\u00a0wrote\u00a0the day after the riot. There is no indication Palma went to the Capitol or was violent on January 6, but tweets from that day show her in DC for Trump\u2019s rally. Palma later dismissed that day\u2019s violence as the work of a few attendees. \u201cJan 6 was not a riot. A small group of people were trouble. It was 99.9 peaceful, respectful. I was there,\u201d\u00a0she wrote. CNN reviewed Palma\u2019s now-private tweets on the Internet Archive Wayback Machine, where\u00a0she included the hashtag #BidenCheated 86 times from November 2020 to February 2021. Palma\u2019s promotion and attendance at \u201cStop the Steal\u201d events after the 2020 election reflects a segment of support Kennedy has received from Trump supporters, particularly as a means of helping the former president retake the White House in 2024. One of the\u00a0biggest donors\u00a0to Kennedy\u2019s super PAC, Timothy Mellon, is also a major donor to Trump. And polls have suggested Kennedy could take critical votes away from Biden. CNN\u00a0was first to report\u00a0that Palma told a gathering of New York state Republicans that efforts to put Kennedy on the ballot in New York would help \u201cget rid of Biden,\u201d which she called her \u201cNo. 1 priority.\u201d \u201cThe only way that Trump can even, remote possibility of taking New York is if Bobby is on the ballot. If it\u2019s Trump vs. Biden, Biden wins. Biden wins six days, seven days a week. With Bobby in the mix, anything can happen,\u201d Palma said in a video of the meeting viewed by CNN. \u201cThe only way for him, for Bobby, to shake it up and to get rid of Biden is if he\u2019s on the ballot in every state, including New York,\u201d she continued. The Kennedy campaign has since distanced itself from Palma. Amaryllis Fox,\u00a0Kennedy\u2019s campaign director, said in a statement posted on X that Palma was hired by the campaign as a ballot-access consultant and that she doesn\u2019t shape electoral strategy, adding that Palma\u2019s remarks in a circulated video were made as a private citizen. Palma did not respond to a CNN request for comment\u00a0but on Tuesday afternoon posted to her Facebook page: \u201cWow- look at that news cycle. I guess the MSM doesn\u2019t like little ole me exercising my 1A rights? Hi, CNN!\u201d Tweets dating to November 2020 show Palma repeatedly volunteering to go to and attending numerous pro-Trump rallies and events \u2013\u00a0even tweeting at\u00a0\u201cStop the Steal\u201d organizer Ali Alexander she would go to Georgia for a week as the state was recounting votes. \u201cWe are rooting for you\u00a0@realDonaldTrump\u00a0Bigly. YUGE rooting. Biggest fan club EVER. #WeLoveYou\u00a0#BestPresidentEver45\u00a0\u00a0#FourMoreYears,\u201d she wrote on November 19, 2020. Palma also\u00a0repeatedly\u00a0expressed\u00a0an affinity for Powell, one of Trump\u2019s election lawyers who\u00a0promoted\u00a0unhinged conspiracy theories\u00a0about nationwide vote-rigging and who filed meritless lawsuits to overturn the results. \u201cYou were born/ chosen for this fight and you will win, win, win. WE LOVE YOU, TOO!\u201d she\u00a0tweeted at\u00a0Powell. In another\u00a0tweet on December 11, 2020,\u00a0Palma called Powell \u201cMY PERSON OF THE DECADE!!\u201d and posted a photo of the pair at the former Trump International Hotel in DC. Last year, Powell\u00a0pleaded guilty\u00a0in the Georgia election subversion case, in which Trump and a host of co-defendants are accused of orchestrating a broad conspiracy aimed at overturning Biden\u2019s 2020 electoral win in the state. It appears that Palma was in DC to attend the \u201cMillion MAGA March\u201d on December 12, 2020, as she\u00a0posted\u00a0photos on Twitter driving to the rally and posted on the day of the rally. \u201c#MAGAMillionMarch\u00a0 #MAGA #TrumpWon #BidenCheated #46DoesNotExist,\u201d\u00a0she wrote. In late December, Palma\u00a0tweeted\u00a0she would attend the January 6, 2021, \u201cStop the Steal\u201d rally,\u00a0writing\u00a0in two tweets, \u201cI got my hotel room!\u201d and \u201cI\u2019ll be there in Jan 6th #FightforTrump #Jan6.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/09/politics/rfk-jr-campaign-official-january-6-trump/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "politics"}}

Kristi Noem from entering their\u00a0Tribal\u00a0land\u00a0adjacent to South Dakota,\u00a0marking the latest escalation in an ongoing clash between Noem and\u00a0Tribal\u00a0leaders over the governor\u2019s previous remarks about Native communities. The Sisseton Wahpeton Oyate\u00a0Tribe\u00a0voted to bar Noem from their land last week and the Yankton Sioux Tribe followed suit. The bans come after the governor made\u00a0recent\u00a0comments\u00a0that many found to be disparaging, alleging that\u00a0Tribal\u00a0leaders were \u201cbenefiting from cartels being there and that\u2019s why they attack me every day,\u201d Noem said at a\u00a0community\u00a0forum last month in Winner, South Dakota, according to the Associated Press. The Standing Rock Sioux, Cheyenne River\u00a0Sioux, Rosebud\u00a0Sioux, and Oglala\u00a0Sioux\u00a0Tribes\u00a0have all moved to banish the governor from their lands. In an email to CNN, Yankton Sioux Council Member Ryan Cournoyer said the governor\u00a0has not apologized or showed remorse for insulting Native people. \u201cWe answered our people\u2019s call for us to stand up and take action against Governor Noem showing that we are united with the Great Sioux Nation of South Dakota, we wanted to send a message that the disrespectful behavior will not be tolerated,\u201d\u00a0he said. \u201cThis decision does not come after one or two incidents but after years of witnessing the governor\u2019s harmful and aggressive actions against Tribes,\u201d\u00a0Cournoyer said. Noem has sought to connect her past comments about\u00a0Tribal\u00a0leaders to the Biden administration and its handling of crime and border security. On Thursday, Noem seemed to double down on her past comments\u00a0against the\u00a0Tribes. \u201cTribals leaders should take action to ban the cartels from their lands and accept my offer to help them restore law and order to their communities while protecting their sovereignty. We can only do this through partnerships because the Biden Administration is failing to do their job,\u201d Noem\u00a0wrote\u00a0on X. \u201cBanishing Governor Noem does nothing to solve the problem,\u201d\u00a0a spokesperson for Noem said in a statement. \u201cShe calls on all our tribal leaders to banish the cartels from tribal lands,\u201d\u00a0the spokesperson said. Sisseton Wahpeton Oyate Tribal Chairman J.\u00a0Garret Renville told CNN the governor\u2019s comments \u201care not only baseless and without merit but also deeply offensive and harmful to the fabric of our community.\u201d \u201cBy perpetuating harmful stereotypes and spreading misinformation, Governor Noem has demonstrated a blatant disregard for the dignity and well-being of Native American people,\u201d Renville said. Noem, who was once considered to be on former President Donald Trump\u2019s 2024 shortlist for vice presidential candidates, has faced increased scrutiny in recent weeks after excerpts from her recently released book, \u201cNo Going Back,\u201d drew the ire of pet owners and world\u00a0leaders alike.

{"id": "2024_05_13_politics_michael-cohen-donald-trump-analysis", "text": "Michael Cohen once described himself as Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cspokesman, thug, pit bull and lawless lawyer.\u201d But this week, he has a new role. He will be the star witness for prosecutors trying to prove Trump illegally falsified business records after paying off adult film actress Stormy Daniels as part of an alleged election interference scheme in 2016. Cohen\u2019s testimony is set to be the critical moment of the hush money trial that could make Trump the first ex-president to be convicted of a crime. His appearance will mark the zenith of a bitter personal feud between two brash New Yorkers obsessed with betrayal and revenge. And it marks one of the most lurid twists yet in the presumptive Republican nominee\u2019s legal morass that is entwined with the 2024 election. Trump\u2019s former fixer wrote in his autobiography that he craved reflected influence and notoriety from Trump, so he adopted the real estate magnate\u2019s methods \u2014 including bullying, lying and mocking the rule of law \u2014 to serve him. He once vowed to take a bullet for his boss. But his testimony will be his latest attempt to atone for this Faustian pact after he paid the price, including with a spell in prison, for his years as a kingpin in Trump\u2019s orbit. In many ways, Cohen is the mirror image of Trump \u2014 a colorful braggart and social media provocateur who craved power and riches and was prepared to pay any price and to intimidate anyone to get them. Cohen, who worked for the Trump Organization cleaning up the mess from the family\u2019s personal scandals and busted business deals, facilitated the $130,000 hush money payment to Daniels, he says, on the orders of his boss. Trump has denied having an affair with Daniels, whose testimony last week about their alleged liaison at Lake Tahoe in 2006 seemed excruciating for the ex-president. He has pleaded not guilty in this case and to three other criminal indictments. Cohen\u2019s value as a witness is that he was involved in every aspect of Trump\u2019s business and personal life, knew all his secrets, and was allegedly an accessory in his efforts to break the law and thwart accountability. In his book \u201cDisloyal,\u201d Cohen wrote, \u201cI know where the skeletons are buried because I was the one who buried them.\u201d Prosecutor Matthew Colangelo said in his opening statement that \u201cCohen made that payment at the defendant\u2019s direction, and he did it to influence the presidential election.\u201d After the election, Trump is accused of working out a scheme in the Oval Office to reimburse Cohen for the hush money payment in installments disguised as billing for legal services. \u201cThe defendant falsified those business records because he wanted to conceal his and others\u2019 criminal conduct,\u201d Colangelo said, adding that both Cohen and the prosecution will be up-front about mistakes Cohen has made in the past. Cohen\u2019s friend and fellow former Trump acolyte Anthony Scaramucci, who briefly served as the ex-president\u2019s White House communications director, said the former fixer will be able to prove the criminality of campaign interference. \u201cI think unfortunately for Donald Trump, Michael Cohen has the receipts for everything that went on,\u201d he told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper  on Friday. \u201cThey\u2019re smoking gun receipts, and he\u2019s going to provide very compelling, very honest, very direct testimony.\u201d How Trump\u2019s legal team will seek to discredit Cohen But like Trump, Cohen has a long history of trashing the truth, and since turning on his onetime mentor, he has sought to monetize his campaign against him with books \u2013 including one called \u201cRevenge\u201d \u2013 podcasts and television appearances. He is, therefore, vulnerable to a savage cross-examination by Trump\u2019s attorneys, who will lambast him as an unreliable witness on a quest for payback as they seek to sow reasonable doubt over Trump\u2019s culpability in the mind of at least one juror. Trump\u2019s attorneys will argue that his payments to Cohen were a legal retainer and that paying someone to stop what they say are unfounded rumors about the ex-president is not illegal. In his opening statement, Trump lawyer Todd Blanche suggested Cohen sought revenge because he was not given a job in the new president\u2019s administration in 2017. He also accused Cohen of an unhealthy obsession with Trump. \u201cHe criticizes President Trump. He has talked extensively about his desire to see President Trump go to prison. He has talked extensively about his desire to see President Trump\u2019s family go to prison. He has talked extensively about President Trump getting convicted in this case,\u201d Blanche said. Trump\u2019s former fixer was sent to prison after pleading guilty to lying to Congress about a possible Trump business project in Russia, for orchestrating illegal campaign contributions in the form of hush money payments and on various tax evasion charges. How prosecutors built a foundation under Cohen\u2019s testimony This issue of credibility is why prosecutors have spent days building a foundation for Cohen\u2019s testimony, taking jurors through inner workings of the Trump Organization including with bank records, text messages and evidence from the firm\u2019s former employees as they seek to prove 34 counts that allege Trump falsified financial records to hide the hush money payments. The testimony from Daniels was designed to illustrate the incident Trump allegedly tried to keep from voters in his successful White House campaign eight years ago. Former Nixon White House counsel John Dean said on \u201cCNN Newsroom\u201d on Saturday that the government case against Trump was \u201cvery powerful\u201d and that \u201cthey have built such a structure that Michael Cohen can come in and testify and he is largely corroborated already.\u201d Cohen has tried to counter defense claims that he has ulterior motives for seeking vengeance against Trump by styling his decision to flip on the former president as a quest for redemption and an attempt to warn the public about the danger Trump poses if he is elected in November. At a dramatic congressional hearing in 2019, Cohen painted a stunning portrait of the mob-like world in which his former boss did business and said that \u201cmy loyalty to Mr. Trump has cost me everything.\u201d He testified that everything he did \u2014 from organizing the suppression of tabloid news stories unflattering to Trump, to bullying business rivals and closing deals \u2014 was in the service of one thing: \u201cEverybody\u2019s job at the Trump Organization is to protect Mr. Trump,\u201d he said, adding that he had been directed by his boss to threaten people more than 500 times. \u201cI am ashamed because I know what Mr. Trump is. He is a racist. He is a conman. He is a cheat,\u201d Cohen said. The Trump worshipper-turned-enemy was a small-time lawyer and businessman who made his fortune in New York taxi medallions before he came to the future president\u2019s attention when he was looking for an enforcer along the lines of the late and notorious New York lawyer Roy Cohn. Trump, who will sit just feet away from his former henchman in the courtroom this week, has been equally unflattering about Cohen. He\u2019s spent months lacerating his former lawyer\u2019s character on social media. And Cohen\u2019s appearance on the witness stand will likely prove one of the biggest tests of Trump\u2019s capacity to avoid infringing the gag order protecting key witnesses and court staff that he has already been fined $10,000 for violating 10 times. Last week, Judge Juan Merchan directly warned Trump that future violations could force him to impose jail time. It will not be the first time the two former partners meet in court. Cohen was a key witness in Trump\u2019s civil fraud trial in New York last fall that resulted in a near half-billion-dollar judgment against the ex-president, his adult sons and the Trump Organization. In what Cohen described as a \u201check of a reunion,\u201d he testified that he manipulated Trump\u2019s financial statements to \u201creverse-engineer\u201d them to hit an arbitrary net wealth figure in a key moment in the prosecution case. He also sparred heatedly with Trump\u2019s lawyers, who tried to discredit him in cross-examination in a way that underscores the risk prosecutors will take putting him on the stand in the hush money trial \u2014 which, unlike the civil fraud case, is being heard by a jury. It is becoming clearer that this trial \u2014 seen by legal experts as the weakest criminal threat facing the former president \u2014 may be the only one to go to a jury before November\u2019s election. The three other cases are all effectively on hold. The Supreme Court is deliberating the former president\u2019s sweeping immunity claims arising from his federal election interference indictment, and a Trump-appointed judge in Florida has postponed his classified documents trial after dragging her feet on adjudicating pretrial motions and disputes. The election interference case in Florida has become mired in a controversy over whether Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis should be disqualified from the case. While the hush money trial harks back to the 2016 election, its end game could play a significant role in the destiny of the White House eight years later. There is no clear sign yet that proceedings have had any impact on Trump\u2019s standing in the race after he brandished his indictments to bolster his claims that he\u2019s the victim of election interference himself. This helped him crush the GOP primary field, and some polls suggest that some Republicans could think twice about voting for him in a neck-and-neck race with President Joe Biden if he\u2019s a convicted felon. But the ex-president would be sure to use any acquittal to argue that all of the cases against him are equally meritless. Cohen\u2019s testimony, therefore, may have consequences far beyond the courtroom.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/13/politics/michael-cohen-donald-trump-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_12_politics_deanne-criswell-fema", "text": "Standing in front of a ruined warehouse in tornado-ravaged Marietta, Oklahoma, FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell was full of questions. \u201cHave you gotten any sleep yet?\u201d she asked the mayor. To the sheriff: \u201cYour home is okay? Your family?\u201d  \u201cDo you have any questions for me?\u201d she prompted another official. It\u2019s a style emblematic of Criswell\u2019s attitude toward disaster relief: On the ground in this small rural community following a devastating EF-4 tornado, her first priority is the people. After a wave of deadly tornados struck Oklahoma, CNN joined Criswell for an exclusive behind-the-scenes look at how she and her agency approach natural disasters.  Her message to officials is straightforward: \u201cYou don\u2019t have to do this alone.\u201d The reaction from local leaders and survivors alike is uniformly one of gratitude that the country\u2019s top emergency response official came to their town to see the damage and hear their stories firsthand. But Criswell shrugged off the praise and thanks. \u201cThis is what I do,\u201d she said. Breaking barriers Long before she became the administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Criswell got her start as a firefighter in Aurora, Colorado \u2014 just the sixth woman to hold that job. \u201cI never thought I was going to be a firefighter,\u201d she told CNN in an interview. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t on my list of things to do.\u201d At the time, Criswell was going through a divorce and \u2014 juggling college tuition with being a single mother to two sons \u2014 decided to join the Colorado Air National Guard to help make ends meet. Given a choice between loading bombs or fighting fires, she chose the latter. \u201cThe firefighters were having a lot of fun and I said, \u2018I\u2019ll give that a shot,\u2019\u201d she said with a smile. \u201cI loved it, I was good at it, and I said, \u2018I\u2019m going to come back and this is the job that I\u2019m going to do.\u2019\u201d It\u2019s a job Criswell would do for more than two decades, including two overseas deployments to Kuwait and Qatar after 9/11. Along the way, she graduated from college, earned two master\u2019s degrees, and eventually rose to lead Aurora\u2019s office of emergency management, where she worked to house evacuees and reunify families displaced by Hurricane Katrina. She joined FEMA during the Obama administration, helping to oversee the agency\u2019s response to natural disasters across the country. In 2019, she became the first woman to lead New York City\u2019s Emergency Management Department, where \u2014 less than a year into the job \u2014 she helped navigate the city through the darkest days of the coronavirus pandemic. Now, as FEMA\u2019s top official, Criswell hopes her unorthodox career path will encourage others to seize opportunities and take professional risks. \u201cYou have to be able to allow the journey to help guide you along the way,\u201d she said. \u201cHave the confidence in yourself, take the personal risk if necessary, and just do the work to get to the level that you want to get to.\u201d A seat at the table When Criswell was unanimously confirmed as FEMA\u2019s 12th administrator \u2014 becoming the first woman to hold that position \u2014 shattering a glass ceiling wasn\u2019t at front of mind. \u201cWhen I first was asked to come in and do this job, I didn\u2019t really think about it,\u201d she admittted.  That changed in her first week on the job. \u201cOne of my younger female employees had come up to me after a meeting and she said, \u2018You know, a year ago, there were zero women in my chain of command between me and the president of the United States,\u2019\u201d Criswell said. \u201c\u2019Now there are five.\u2019 And so what it told me is, people notice, right?\u201d  Criswell knows from experience the obstacles women can face in her line of work. \u201cAs I was coming up in my career, it was always a balance between demonstrating your confidence and your competence with being called the \u2018B word,\u2019\u201d she said, acknowledging that term was directed at her \u201cmany times\u201d over her career. \u201cYou have to believe in yourself that you deserve a seat at that table, that you deserve your voice to be heard,\u201d she said. Now that she\u2019s a woman in a major leadership role in the federal government, Criswell uses her position to help elevate the voices of the women beneath her. \u201cI like to watch how women are either voicing their opinions, or I can maybe sense if they\u2019re afraid to voice their opinions and help encourage them,\u201d she told CNN. \u201cAnd when somebody says something, I will immediately step in and say, \u2018well, that\u2019s a really amazing idea,\u2019 right? In giving that validation at the time, I think it\u2019s important, especially as the leader in the room, to always be observant about the dynamics of what\u2019s happening within that conversation.\u201d That dynamic is already starting to change \u2014 Criswell\u2019s first meeting in Oklahoma, with state emergency management leaders and regional FEMA officials, was led entirely by women. On-the-ground leadership In three years as administrator, Criswell has logged more than 100,000 miles of travel, visiting disaster zones in every corner of the United States. Criswell said seeing the devastation firsthand is critically important to the decisions she makes when determining FEMA\u2019s response. \u201cIt helps me get rid of the red tape,\u201d she said. \u201cIt helps me break down bureaucracy in order to ensure that it\u2019s more than numbers \u2014 it\u2019s people.\u201d Criswell emphasizes the importance of taking the time to hear directly from victims. Otherwise, she said, \u201cyou can\u2019t feel that emotion, you can\u2019t feel the heartache.\u201d It also allows her to get face time with officials at every level. In Oklahoma, Criswell made a point of meeting with first responders, local leaders, state emergency management officials, and representatives from affected tribal nations. Criswell knows that disaster relief transcends party, an approach that has earned her respect and appreciation from across the political spectrum. \u201cWhen there\u2019s a disaster and there\u2019s people in need, we\u2019re all Americans,\u201d Oklahoma\u2019s Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt told CNN shortly after appearing with Criswell at a news conference. \u201cAnd that\u2019s, I think, the administrator\u2019s attitude. These are federal agencies that we have to work with regardless of who\u2019s in the White House.\u201d  Criswell agrees. \u201cThis kind of a partnership, this is absolutely critical to make sure we bring the right people into these communities to help with their specific needs,\u201d she said. Shaking the governor\u2019s hand, she added, \u201cWe will be in touch \u2013 you have my number.\u201d Putting people first At FEMA headquarters in Washington, DC, the agency\u2019s motto is prominently displayed on the wall: \u201cHelping people before, during, and after disasters.\u201d It\u2019s a mission statement Criswell has taken to heart. Coming into the job, she said, \u201cI wanted to make sure that we put people first.\u201d As a former city emergency management director, Criswell knew all-too-well FEMA\u2019s reputation for bureaucratic red tape and convoluted relief programs that made it harder to get help to people who needed it. \u201cWe are an agency that deals with risk every day \u2013 that\u2019s the nature of what we do, yet when it comes to our policies, we can sometimes be a little bit more risk averse,\u201d she says. \u201cI wanted to get away from that. I wanted us to really understand what it meant to put people first.\u201d  Her solution was to listen. \u201cI went to different open disasters and listened to our people, listened to governors, listened to actual people that were impacted about what their barriers were,\u201d Criswell said. \u201cAnd then we were able to address those by making changes.\u201d The result was the most sweeping reforms to the FEMA\u2019s disaster assistance programs in two decades. The changes, which went into effect in March, include: Criswell believes the changes will be transformational and make it easier for FEMA to have an immediate impact on the ground. \u201cWe can actually help people on their road to recovery in a way that makes sense,\u201d she said, \u201cinstead of being so restricted by some of the regulations that we have.\u201d That focus on helping people extends to her staff as well. Recognizing the toll that responding to a seemingly endless stream of natural disasters can have on her team\u2019s mental health, Criswell implemented a \u201cwellness room\u201d just outside FEMA HQ\u2019s nerve center \u2014 complete with comfortable chairs and a soothing livestream of birds at a feeder. \u201cThis is a spot where they can come take a timeout,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have to be able to invest in our employees and we have to be able to give them, not just the support, but the permission to recognize when they need a break.\u201d \u2018Grandma Cookie\u2019 To her staff, she\u2019s \u201cAdministrator Criswell.\u201d But to her family, she\u2019s known by a different title.  \u201cI\u2019m affectionately known as \u2018Grandma Cookie,\u2019\u201d she admitted Despite a career filled with demanding jobs, Criswell has never lost sight of her other job: that of a mom to two grown sons and grandmother of three. It hasn\u2019t come without sacrifices, between multiple deployments and constant travel to different disaster zones. But when Criswell appeared before Congress for her confirmation hearing, her sons were by her side. \u201cWhen they were with me that day and you could see how proud they were and how successful they have both become,\u201d she said, \u201cit really just gave me a really warm feeling as a mother.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/12/politics/deanne-criswell-fema/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_12_politics_menendez-gold-cash-what-matters", "text": "Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez of New Jersey faces his second, distinct bribery and corruption trial in seven years starting Monday. This new case is a complicated affair involving multiple gold bars, envelopes of cash, a Mercedes and a lot more that, prosecutors say, the powerful former chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and his new wife (they got married during the alleged bribery scheme) obtained in exchange for helping a halal meat monopoly, granting favors for people from Egypt and Qatar and trying to influence a New Jersey prosecution. Menendez, who has until June to announce if he\u2019s running for reelection, has pleaded not guilty and denied all of the charges. He told CNN\u2019s Manu Raju on Capitol Hill last week, \u201cI am\u00a0looking forward to proving my innocence.\u201d Also pleading not guilty and denying wrongdoing are his wife Nadine, who is also a named as a defendant, and two businessmen, Wael Hana and Fred Daibes, who have ties to Egypt and Qatar, respectively. Another man, New Jersey businessman Jose Uribe, on the other hand, has pleaded guilty and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors. Here\u2019s what prosecutors say the senator and his wife got: Gold bars Prosecutors say Hana and Daibes gave Menendez and his wife gold bars, which were seized by the FBI from the Menendez residence. After returning from a trip to Egypt and getting a ride home from the airport from Daibes\u2019 driver, prosecutors say Menendez searched online for the price of a gold bar. Envelopes full of cash The indictment includes photos of piles of cash next to envelopes spread across jackets on which the senator\u2019s name is embroidered. There are piles of $20 bills and $50 bills in one photo and $100 bills in another photo. They also found cash in closets, a safe and Nadine Menendez\u2019s safety deposit box. Some of the envelopes, according to prosecutors, bore fingerprints or DNA belonging to Daibes or his driver. Total cash discovered: More than $480,000 in the home and more than $70,000 in the safety deposit box. Later court filings that added charges in the case are more specific, describing bags full of cash being found on top of hangers in the senator\u2019s basement and stuffed into boots in the closet. Convertible Mercedes The 2019 vehicle, which prosecutors value at more than $60,000, was parked in the driveway at the Menendez home when it was raided. The indictment describes Nadine Menendez obtaining $15,000 in cash from Uribe in a parking lot the day before she picked the vehicle up and put $15,000 as a down payment. Uribe is alleged to have then hid his monthly financing payments for the vehicle. Later, after the raid, she would write Uribe a $21,000 check, which prosecutors say was an effort at cleanup, making the gift look like a loan. Nadine Menendez needed a new car, apparently after hitting and killing a jaywalker in Bogota, New Jersey, in December 2018. A police report was filed but she faced no charges. Mortgage payment Prosecutors say the senator and his wife also tried to cover up around $23,000 in help Nadine Menendez got from a halal meat company owned by Hana that bailed her out of foreclosure on a mortgage. Reimbursement checks were paid in December 2022, months after the initial raid on the senator\u2019s house. Payment for low- or no-show work Hana\u2019s company paid Nadine Menendez $10,000 on three occasions, according to prosecutors. At the time, they allege, she was acting as a sort of go-between for Egyptian officials, Hana and the senator. Engagement ring Prosecutors describe a recorded conversation between Hana and a confidential source in which Hana is described as obtaining $150,000 from a man to purchase a car and an engagement ring for Nadine Menendez in exchange for the senator giving a \u201cpush\u201d in a New Jersey criminal case that saved the man three years. Basement carpeting Prosecutors said in their February court filing that Nadine Menendez arranged for carpeting to be installed in her basement, apparently in exchange for setting up dinners between the senator and officials \u2013 and also for his call, according to prosecutors, attempting to interfere in a New Jersey state prosecution. Furniture The initial September 2023 indictment makes several mentions of furniture and furnishings provided by Hana and Daibes but does not go into specifics. Formula One tickets In a superseding indictment filed in March, prosecutors allege Menendez obtained tickets to Formula One races in 2022 and 2023 for Nadine Menendez\u2019s relative. Menendez made comments supportive of Qatar during that period and lobbied Qatari officials to invest in Daibes\u2019 real estate venture, which they ultimately did. Daibes is described as sending the senator pictures of luxury watches priced between roughly $10,000 and $24,000, but it is not clear from the filing if Menendez ever obtained a timepiece. What\u2019s the quid pro quo? There is a long list of actions prosecutors say Menendez undertook in exchange for all of these alleged bribes. They allege Menendez, in his prior role as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee: \u2026 lobbied the US Department of Agriculture to maintain Hana\u2019s monopoly on US halal meat exports to Egypt, even though it drove up prices. \u2026 met with Egyptian officials in exchange for cash. \u2026 gave Hana not-classified but also not-public information about employees at the US embassy in Egypt. \u2026 passed on information about US military sales to Egypt to Hana and signed off on certain sales. \u2026 lobbied Qataris on behalf of Daibes\u2019 real estate scheme and supported resolutions in the Senate supportive of Qatar. \u2026 tried to influence court cases in New Jersey related to Uribe and his associates. Uribe, recall, is now cooperating with prosecutors. \u2026 tried to disrupt a federal prosecution of Daibes.  Again, Menendez denies all the charges, and the jury that will get to hear his side of the story will begin to be selected in New York starting Monday. Nadine Menendez\u2019s trial is slated for July. Perhaps Menendez and his wife can convincingly argue the mortgage and car payments were a loan. Perhaps Menendez will argue he did not know about payments related to dinners and meetings organized by his wife. The envelopes of cash prosecutors say bore Daibes\u2019 fingerprints may be more difficult to explain. Menendez escaped previous bribery charge Menendez is used to being under the microscope of federal prosecutors. The Department of Justice ultimately decided not to retry Menendez in 2018 after a previous jury deadlocked over whether he accepted trips and gifts from a friend, an ophthalmologist named Salomon Melgen. Melgen went to prison in a separate Medicare fraud scheme, but that sentence was commuted by then-President Donald Trump after lobbying by Menendez on Melgen\u2019s behalf.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/12/politics/menendez-gold-cash-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "politics"}}

{"id": "2024_05_14_politics_mike-johnson-donald-trump-hush-money-trial", "text": "House Speaker Mike Johnson is not waiting for ex-President Donald Trump to be judged by a jury of his peers. He\u2019s delivered his verdict already. The top Republican in the legislative branch showed up Tuesday at the courthouse where the presumptive GOP presidential nominee is on trial, deploying his authority and the symbolic weight of his office against the justice system. \u201cThe people are losing faith, right now, in this country, in our institutions,\u201d the Louisiana Republican said outside the building where Trump is facing accusations of falsifying financial records to cover up a hush money payoff to a former adult film star before the 2016 election. (Trump has pleaded not guilty.) Johnson said Americans were \u201closing faith in our system of justice. And the reason for that is because they see it being abused as it is being done here in New York.\u201d As the trial reached its pivotal moment this week with the testimony of Trump\u2019s former fixer Michael Cohen, Trump has been gathering high-profile Republicans at the courthouse \u2013 some of whom are auditioning for his vice-presidential spot. On Monday, Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance, a possible VP contender, was there along with Alabama Sen. Tommy Tuberville, a famed former college football coach. North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, also a possibility for the GOP ticket, showed up Tuesday and dismissed the proceedings as a \u201cpaperwork trial.\u201d It\u2019s a testimony to Trump\u2019s power in the party and command over its grassroots supporters that so many top GOP figures want to be seen supporting him despite his four criminal indictments. Even if this hush money case may be the weakest of them, and even if he\u2019s acquitted, it\u2019s resurfacing details of an alleged liaison with Stormy Daniels and airing testimony about his behavior that paints a grim character sketch. (Trump has denied the affair with Daniels.) These Republicans\u2019 desperation to move into the former president\u2019s inner circle is also ironic since Cohen has offered a cautionary tale in describing how he turned himself into a bullying, lying clone of Trump to grab a piece of his power and reflected glory. His efforts ended \u2013 as with many of Trump\u2019s associates \u2013 in shame and landed him on the wrong side of the law as he went to prison partly because of his role in the hush money cover-up. But Johnson is not just some rising GOP lawmaker \u2013 although he may owe Trump his job after fighting off an attempt to unseat him in which the ex-president declined to play a role. The speaker\u2019s appearance is different, given the constitutional heft of his office and the figurative connotations it evokes. \u201cThese are politically motivated trials, and they are a disgrace,\u201d Johnson said Tuesday. \u201cIt is election interference,\u201d he said, claiming the indictments show how \u201cdesperate\u201d Trump\u2019s opponents are, adopting the former president\u2019s campaign trope that he\u2019s a persecuted political victim. There are legitimate questions about this case \u2013 some of which were being teased out in court as Johnson spoke Tuesday \u2013 including whether the alleged offense arises to the level of a felony. Cohen, a convicted felon, is, to put it mildly, a problematic witness. Some experts have questioned whether any other defendant besides Trump would face the same indictment at the hands of a prosecutor, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, a Democrat. The theory that Trump\u2019s actions amounted to a conspiracy to interfere in an election might be provable in court but may strike many voters as a stretch, especially during an election eight years later. And then there\u2019s the deeper question of prosecutorial discretion \u2013 whether the gravity of the alleged offenses is sufficient to take the unprecedented and politically radioactive step of putting a former president on trial as he seeks the office again. But Trump is hardly a victim. He is fully availing himself of the protections of the legal system he frequently lambasts. His appeals in other cases, for instance, mean this may be the only one of four trials he faces before the election. That means he\u2019s unlikely to face justice for seeking to overturn one election before standing in the next one. And his charges in this case were not just dreamed up \u2013 they emerged from a grand jury that decided there was a case to answer. Trump is exercising his right to mount a defense and is considered innocent until proven guilty. Johnson, however, claimed the trial was an attempt to destroy Trump\u2019s 2024 campaign and prejudged the verdict in lashing out at a \u201csham\u201d trial. He attacked the judge and his partial gag order imposed on Trump to protect the safety of witnesses and sought to discredit the testimony of Cohen. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing that he presents here that should be given any weight at all by a jury and certainly not this judge,\u201d Johnson said of the star witness. In seeking to discredit the case and a potential guilty verdict, Johnson is implicitly questioning whether courts should have the power to judge politicians \u2013 a position that, if adopted, would erode a legal system based on the principle that everyone, even ex-presidents, is equal under the law. Johnson\u2019s embrace of Trump is a sign that the presumptive GOP nominee\u2019s transgressions \u2013 including his two impeachments, his attempt to destroy democracy to stay in office, his three other indictments, his vows to use a second term to weaponize presidential power against political enemies and to start mass deportations of undocumented migrants, as well as his embrace of rhetoric that echoes 1930s dictators \u2013 are no impediment to a party that craves a return to full power. And the speaker\u2019s willingness to put the symbolism of the legislative branch of government at the service of a strongman who again wants to head the executive branch shows there would be even fewer constitutional restraints on Trump than there were in his first term if Republicans triumph in November\u2019s election.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/14/politics/mike-johnson-donald-trump-hush-money-trial/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "politics"}}

{"id": "2024_05_14_politics_cohen-trump-prison-what-matters", "text": "After watching his former fixer Michael Cohen testify against him on Tuesday, former President Donald Trump is expected to attend a fundraiser in New York City co-hosted by Charles Kushner, his son-in-law\u2019s father, whom he pardoned in 2020. The crimes for which Kushner went to prison \u2013 tax evasion and campaign finance violations \u2013 had nothing to do with Trump, but they were tawdry enough to compete with a porn star hush money trial. Trying to intimidate his sister from testifying before a grand jury, the elder Kushner set up a sort of rogue sting operation in which he meant to videotape his sister\u2019s brother with a prostitute and then send the tape to his sister. At least those are the broad outlines of the tale as told by former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who was then the US attorney for the state who prosecuted the case. Christie was ultimately denied a Trump Cabinet position after Jared Kushner, Trump\u2019s son-in-law, opposed the idea. Now Christie, like Cohen, is a former Trump associate trying to take the former president down. RELATED: Read about Cohen\u2019s testimony in Trump\u2019s trial. Cohen is rare in the universe of Trump associates since he both turned on Trump and went to prison. Many of the other Trump aides and associates who faced jail eventually got pardons or clemency and still support the former president. Manafort still wants to help Paul Manafort is still in Trump\u2019s camp despite spending years in jail during a legal odyssey. Manafort ran Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign for a time, but then later, while Trump was president, Manafort \u2013 who made money as a foreign lobbyist \u2013 was convicted for federal tax evasion, among other things. He also pleaded guilty to conspiracy against the US. Trump continually expressed sympathy for Manafort. Manafort served two years until he was released to home confinement during the Covid-19 pandemic and was ultimately pardoned before Trump left office. He\u2019s back in the foreign lobbying business, although the optics of being involved in Trump\u2019s 2024 campaign were apparently too much. Manafort recently backed away from a supporting role helping plan the Republican National Convention after media scrutiny over his involvement. Bannon faces jail for post-pardon activity Steve Bannon, the former Trump White House chief strategist turned right-wing provocateur, obtained a Trump pardon before he could be tried for allegedly defrauding donors of contributions intended to help build a wall on the US border with Mexico. Pardoning Bannon was one of Trump\u2019s final acts in office. Bannon associates in the scheme who did not receive pardons have been convicted and sentenced to prison. Trump\u2019s pardon helped Bannon avoid prosecution in the border wall scheme, but Bannon may yet go to prison. He was the subject of a rare prosecution by the Department of Justice for refusing to comply with a congressional subpoena. Bannon ignored summons to testify before the now-disbanded House committee that investigated the January 6, 2021, insurrection. A federal appeals court recently rejected his attempt to further delay his four-month sentence, and prosecutors this week asked for Bannon\u2019s sentence to be imposed. Bannon hosts a widely downloaded podcast that is supportive of Trump. Another former top Trump aide, Peter Navarro, has already reported to prison after his conviction for contempt of Congress. Trump can\u2019t help Bannon or Navarro now, since he\u2019s not currently president, but he has already promised to use pardon power to help people convicted of crimes related to January 6, a riot committed by his supporters. Stone, Flynn avoided jail Trump already has a notable history of helping supporters when he is able. He commuted the sentence of his longtime friend Roger Stone, the political operative who was convicted by a jury of, among other things, obstructing the Russia investigation. Trump also issued a wide-ranging pardon to retired Gen. Michael Flynn, his first national security adviser who was charged with lying to investigators. Flynn had entered a guilty plea and then tried to rescind it, and the yearslong legal saga hung over Trump\u2019s presidency. Trump issued the Flynn pardon shortly after losing the 2020 presidential election. Flynn is now an avowed QAnon conspiracy theorist, but Trump has said he could bring him back in a second Trump administration. Trump\u2019s longtime CFO is back on Rikers Trump also can\u2019t help another lieutenant, Allen Weisselberg, who stayed loyal. Weisselberg already served one monthslong jail sentence on Rikers Island for a yearslong tax scheme. But then he was found to have lied during a deposition in the civil fraud trial in which Trump was found to have inflated his wealth to get favorable loans. For that perjury, Weisselberg pleaded guilty to different state charges and is now serving another five months at Rikers Island jail. Even if Trump is reelected, a president cannot use his pardon power to absolve state charges. Jonathan Karl of ABC News has reported that Trump was actively considering a pardon for Cohen around the time the FBI raided Cohen\u2019s house in 2018. Cohen ultimately spent weeks in solitary confinement for his tax and campaign finance crimes, something he has said was retribution by Trump \u2013 although a lawsuit Cohen filed making that allegation was dismissed.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/14/politics/cohen-trump-prison-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "politics"}}

Mayes said in\u00a0a statement\u00a0she is \u201cgrateful\u201d the court stayed the enforcement and said the earliest the 1864 abortion ban can be enforced is September 26, due to an additional 45 days stipulated in a separate case. \u201cI will do everything I can to ensure that doctors can provide medical care for their patients according to their best judgment, not the beliefs of the men elected to the territorial legislature 160 years ago,\u201d she said. On Monday, the court also denied a motion from Planned Parenthood Arizona asking the court to stay the 1864 abortion ban until the repeal of that law takes effect. The repeal of the Civil War-era ban earlier this month was a victory for abortion rights advocates, who have for years tried to overturn the 1864 law that banned abortion at all stages of pregnancy, except to save a mother\u2019s life, and threatened providers with two to five year prison sentences.
