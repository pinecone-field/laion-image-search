At the same time, a majority who\u00a0tuned in say it had little or no effect on their choice for president. Debate watchers say, 67% to 33%, that Trump turned in a better performance Thursday. Prior to the debate, the same voters said, 55% to 45%, that they expected Trump to turn in a better performance than Biden. And in 2020, Biden was seen by debate watchers as outperforming Trump in both of their presidential debates. Republicans who watched the first 2024 debate expressed broad confidence in Trump\u2019s performance, the poll finds, with Democrats less sanguine about their party\u2019s presumptive nominee. A near-universal 96% of GOP debate watchers say Trump did the better job in the debate, while a more modest 69% of Democratic debate watchers view Biden as the night\u2019s winner. And 85% of GOP debate watchers credit Trump with doing more than his rival to address concerns about his ability to handle the presidency \u2013 by contrast, only 53% of Democratic debate watchers say that Biden did a better job at addressing concerns, with 27% saying neither candidate did much to allay concerns about their abilities. The poll\u2019s results reflect opinions of the debate only among those voters who tuned in and aren\u2019t representative of the views of the full voting public \u2013 in their demographics, their political preferences or the level of attention they pay to politics. Debate watchers in the poll were 5 points likelier to be Republican-aligned than Democratic-aligned, making for an audience that was slightly more GOP-leaning than all registered voters nationally. An 81% majority of registered voters who watched the debate say it had no effect on their choice for president, with another 14% saying that it made them reconsider but didn\u2019t change their mind. Just 5% say it changed their minds about whom to vote for. Roughly equal shares of Biden and Trump supporters \u2013 about 3% of each \u2013 say the debate had changed their mind. Larger shares of those supporting other candidates say that the debate had changed their minds. Among debate watchers who said pre-debate that they hadn\u2019t chosen a candidate or were open to changing their minds, 9% said that the debate had changed their minds, and 25% were reconsidering. Just 3% of debate watchers who said in the pre-debate survey that they supported Trump currently say they\u2019d consider voting for Biden, while 5% of Biden supporters currently say they\u2019d consider a vote for Trump. Among debate watchers overall, 48% say they\u2019d only consider voting for Trump, 40% that they\u2019d only consider voting for Biden, 2% that they\u2019re considering both candidates, and 11% that they aren\u2019t considering voting for either. The poll\u2019s results reflect opinions of the debate only among those voters who tuned in and aren\u2019t representative of the views of the full voting public \u2013 in their demographics, their political preferences or the level of attention they pay to politics. Debate watchers in the poll were 5 points likelier to be Republican-aligned than Democratic-aligned, making for an audience that was slightly more GOP-leaning than all registered voters nationally. A 57% majority of debate-watchers Thursday night say they have no real confidence in Biden\u2019s ability to lead the country, while 44% have no real confidence in Trump\u2019s ability to do so. Those numbers are effectively unchanged from the poll taken prior to the debate, in which 55% of those voters said they had no confidence in Biden, and 47% that they lacked confidence in Trump. Neither candidate scores highly on this metric, but while just 36% of debate watchers now say they have a lot of confidence in Trump\u2019s ability to lead the country, only 14% say the same of Biden. The share of Democratic debate watchers expressing a lot of confidence in Biden\u2019s ability to lead the country fell from 54% prior to the debate to just 39% afterward, although most continue to express at least some confidence. By contrast, 69% of Republicans say post-debate that they have a lot of confidence in Trump, similar to the 73% who held that opinion prior to the debate. Debate watchers as a whole say, 55% to 27%, that they think Trump would do a better job of handling immigration than Biden. They also give Trump the advantage on the economy (56% to 31%) and foreign policy (47% to 35%). Debate watchers trust Biden over Trump to handle protecting democracy (44% to 38%) and abortion (42% to 34%). By 42% to 27%, voters who watched the debate say that Trump offered a better plan than Biden for solving the country\u2019s problems, with 27% saying neither candidate offered a better plan. And 48% of debate watchers say Trump better addressed concerns about his ability to handle the presidency, with 23% saying Biden did a better job and 22% that neither candidate did. Another 7% thought both candidates did an equally good job allaying concerns. Debate watchers\u2019 views of Biden dipped slightly following the debate: Just 31% now view him favorably, compared with 37% in the pre-debate survey. By contrast, 43% of debate watchers view Trump favorably, similar to the 40% with positive views of him prior to Thursday\u2019s event. The CNN flash poll was conducted by text message with 565 registered US voters who said they watched the debate Thursday, and the poll findings are representative of the views of debate watchers only. Respondents were recruited to participate before the debate and were selected via a survey of members of the SSRS Opinion Panel, a nationally representative panel recruited using probability-based sampling techniques. Results for the full sample of debate watchers have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 5.5 percentage points.

{"id": "2024_06_13_politics_kfile-jd-vance-harsh-twitter-likes-trump-vice-president", "text": "Republican Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance, a leading candidate to be Donald Trump\u2019s vice president, liked tweets in 2016 and 2017 that harshly criticized Trump and his policies \u2014 including one speculating that Vance could serve in former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton\u2019s administration. Other tweets liked by Vance said Trump committed \u201cserial sexual assault,\u201d called him \u201cone of USA\u2019s most hated, villainous, douchey celebs,\u201d and, in a since-removed set of tweets, harshly criticized Trump\u2019s response to the deadly 2017 White nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia \u2013 something Vance now defends Trump over. Vance\u2019s past anti-Trump stances have been well-documented, but these new examples, unearthed by an extensive review of Vance\u2019s past social media activity, demonstrate they were more widespread and scathing than previously known. Their discovery also comes as Vance has solidified his standing in Trump\u2019s inner circle as a frequent defender of the former president and is among a handful of people under consideration to be Trump\u2019s vice-presidential pick. As CNN\u2019s KFile previously reported, Vance deleted past anti-Trump tweets ahead of his announcement in July 2021 that he would run for the open Ohio Senate seat. Vance once\u00a0privately wondered whether Trump was \u2018America\u2019s Hitler\u2019 in February 2016, and a few months later wrote in The Atlantic that Trump was \u201ccultural heroin.\u201d Vance also said he even contemplated voting for Clinton, but ultimately said he would vote for independent candidate Evan McMullin for president in 2016. Once regarded as a \u201cTrump whisperer\u201d for his understanding of the aggrieved White working class and a self-described \u201cNever Trump\u201d Republican, Vance shot to fame over his memoir, \u201cHillbilly Elegy,\u201d published in June 2016. Vance was a frequent guest on cable news programs and later became a CNN contributor in 2017. His subsequent transition from vocal Trump critic to staunch supporter has been widely scrutinized. Vance has become a key surrogate for the former president and routinely defends Trump on television, including during his hush money trial in New York last month. Vance also helped orchestrate Trump\u2019s June 6 fundraiser in San Francisco with tech industry donors. Trump is expected to meet with congressional Republicans in Washington, DC, on Thursday. In a statement to CNN, Vance cited Trump\u2019s \u201cmany successes in office\u201d and claimed that realizing the \u201ccorporate media and Deep State\u2019s\u201d coordinated efforts to undermine Trump changed his perspective. \u201cI\u2019m proud to be one of his strongest supporters in the Senate today and I\u2019m going to do everything in my power to ensure President Trump wins in November - the survival of America depends on it.\u201d Prior to the publication of this story, Vance\u2019s communications director sent along two supportive statements from Donald Trump Jr. and Jason Miller, a senior advisor to the Trump campaign. Trump Jr. criticized news outlets for repeatedly covering Vance\u2019s past anti-Trump comments writing, \u201cWe\u2019re 100% confident that JD is America First to the core\u201d and \u201cno one in the Senate has been a stronger supporter of my father.\u201d Trump Jr. added they were \u201clong past all of this,\u201d saying they had \u201cdiscussed it with him at length.\u201d Miller wrote, \u201cIt\u2019s important to keep in mind that politics is ultimately politics,\u201d and likened Vance\u2019s past criticism to criticism by Kamala Harris of Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential primary over his past opposition to desegregation busing in the 1970s. In an interview published Thursday, Vance told New York Times columnist Ross Douthat about his political conversion to a pro-Trump Republican. \u201cLike a lot of other elite conservatives and elite liberals, I allowed myself to focus so much on the stylistic element of Trump that I completely ignored the way in which he substantively was offering something very different on foreign policy, on trade, on immigration,\u201d Vance said. Anti-Trump social media activity from 2016 CNN reviewed Vance\u2019s past likes on Twitter, the platform now known as X, before X changed its policy to make users\u2019 likes private and hidden from others. A majority of the newly uncovered social media activity dates from the last five months of the 2016 presidential campaign. They include Vance liking a number of anti-Trump posts on Twitter, including those criticizing Trump\u2019s immigration policies, acknowledging antisemitism from Trump supporters, questioning the integrity of voting for Trump over Clinton and even raising concerns over Trump having access to the country\u2019s nuclear codes as president. In February 2016, Vance liked a tweet featuring a photo of Trump, two women and O.J. Simpson with the caption, \u201cHere is an old picture of one of USA\u2019s most hated, villainous, douchey celebs. Also in picture: OJ Simpson.\u201d Vance also liked tweets from August 2016 that praised his book and envisioned a role for him in a potential Clinton administration and another tweet suggesting he could provide Clinton with the \u201cseeds to a plan to defeat Trump.\u201d But Vance soon began liking several tweets with the hashtag #NeverHillary through October 2016. While promoting his memoir and appearing on news programs in 2016, Vance liked a series of tweets calling then-candidate Trump a \u201cmonster\u201d and a \u201cnemesis of the GOP.\u201d He also liked a tweet acknowledging \u201cthreats and derogatory terms Trump supporters hurl at Jews.\u201d He even liked a tweet from CNN anchor Jake Tapper criticizing Trump\u2019s tweet about a woman\u2019s appearance amidst then-first lady Melania Trump\u2019s campaign against cyberbullying. He also liked a tweet that read, \u201cDoes any dad (or future dad) want to look his daughter in the eye and explain why he voted for Trump instead of 1st woman president?\u201d Among the harshest tweets Vance liked was one that called out Trump after the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape surfaced, capturing previously unaired lewd and sexually aggressive remarks by the presidential nominee. \u201cMaybe the Central Park 5 could take out a full-page ad to condemn the coddling of thug real estate barons who commit serial sexual assault,\u201d the tweet read. Other tweets Vance engaged with criticized signature Trump policies, including Trump\u2019s hardline position on immigration and the tax cuts from 2017. In August 2017, Vance criticized Trump\u2019s response to the White supremacist violence in Charlottesville earlier that year, linking in a since-deleted tweet to a TV segment that called Trump a \u201ccoward\u201d for his response, and then liked a tweet indicating he did not consistently support the GOP or Trump. \u201cThere is no moral equivalence between the anti-racist protestors in Charlottesville and the killer (and his ilk),\u201d Vance wrote, while also criticizing left-wing violence. \u201cYou may not like @JDVance1\u2019s view - but it\u2019s hard to pin him down as consistently supporting views of either Trump or GOP,\u201d read the tweet Vance liked. Pro-Trump pivot Despite his earlier harsh criticism of Trump, by 2021, Vance dismissed left-wing condemnation of Trump\u2019s comments \u2014 where Trump equated White nationalist protestors and counter-protestors as \u201cfine people on both sides\u201d\u2014 as \u201cthe ridiculous race hoax in Charlottesville.\u201d Ahead of his Senate campaign that year, Vance apologized for previously calling Trump \u201creprehensible,\u201d in tweets first uncovered by CNN\u2019s KFile. \u201cLike a lot of people, I criticized Trump back in 2016,\u201d Vance told CNN in 2021. \u201cI regret being wrong about the guy,\u201d Vance said, adding he thought Trump was a good president. In a previously unreported blog post Vance wrote in April 2010 under his previous legal name, J.D. Hamel, he wrote in support of legal immigration, advocating to \u201cmassively increase\u201d the number of migrants allowed into the country. \u201cBorder security is a good start, but if we plan to control the border, then we must also plan to massively increase the number of legal migrants allowed into the country,\u201d Vance wrote. \u201cThe day that America no longer welcomes decent, hardworking foreign nationals is the day that our nation loses something very central to its character and its economic diversity.\u201d Vance told CNN, \u201cIt was a stupid opinion from 15 years ago when I was in my twenties. All anyone needs to do is check my voting record as a Senator to see that I have consistently opposed increased immigration levels into America.\u201d Vance said in September 2016 that Trump\u2019s immigration policies were overly simplistic. \u201cAt the heart of Trump\u2019s immigration message is that if we had less immigration, we would have much better jobs,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s a lot more complicated than that. My own sense is that Trump definitely simplifies these problems. I don\u2019t think if you build a great Mexican wall, all of a sudden, all of these steel mill jobs are going to come back to southern Ohio, but it at least gives people something to latch onto.\u201d Three months ago, Vance reiterated his support for Trump\u2019s immigration policies. In an interview on Fox Business Vance said, \u201cIf we don\u2019t get control of the southern border \u2013 tens of millions of illegal aliens are now in our country, tons of fentanyl killing over 100,000 people \u2013 we don\u2019t have a country anymore if we don\u2019t get control of that border.\u201d This story has been updated with more information.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/13/politics/kfile-jd-vance-harsh-twitter-likes-trump-vice-president/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/30/2024", "section": "politics"}}

Freeman transmitted information related to \u201cvulnerabilities\u201d of Air Force aircraft and related to weapon systems on multiple occasions between November 2020 and March 2021, prosecutors allege.

{"id": "2024_06_25_politics_biden-trump-debate-issues-analysis", "text": "Presidential debates crystalize a quadrennial dilemma for a country contemplating a new political direction. But they\u2019re usually defined more by trivial personality quirks, zeitgeist moments and gaffes than high-level ideological argument. Al Gore\u2019s melodramatic sighs, George H.W. Bush\u2019s unwise glance at his watch, a day\u2019s growth on Richard Nixon\u2019s chin and Donald Trump\u2019s bulk looming over Hillary Clinton remain iconic years after the policy clashes in those debates have been forgotten. And while Thursday night\u2019s debate hosted by CNN between President Joe Biden and ex-President Trump could also turn on a theatrical flurry between two men who openly despise one another, the policy meat of a presidential debate has rarely been so important as in this neck-and-neck White House race. The country is confronting a perilous moment, internally estranged over politics and culture and as multiple foreign policy crises deepen. America faces a choice in November that will lead, like in Robert Frost\u2019s poem, down one of two divergent roads from which there may be no coming back. A charged political backdrop to a vital debate Trump\u2019s attempt to regain the White House, less than four years after he attempted to steal the last election, poses a potentially existential question for the democratic system. The former president\u2019s conservative backers are, meanwhile, proposing an evisceration of the bureaucracy and the politicization of judicial and intelligence leadership posts to reconcile the goals of a GOP candidate sporting one criminal conviction, three other indictments and a thirst for revenge. At the same time, and despite a roaring jobs market, millions of Americans are worn down by high prices and the cost of borrowing. The legacy of a once-in-a-generation pandemic robbed the country of a sense of economic security that Biden promised to restore four years ago but that remains elusive for many. The Supreme Court\u2019s overturning of the constitutional right to an abortion two years ago has opened an ideological and religious schism over reproductive rights that Biden plans to exploit to hurt Trump. But the president is equally vulnerable over an immigration crisis on the southern border that has swamped asylum laws unfit to handle a new generation of migrants fleeing gangs, economic blight and climate disasters. Overseas, there\u2019s a frightening sense of fracturing. The global system that has enshrined American power for 80 years is under extreme pressure from US foes seeking to destroy it, including Russia and the new superpower China. Biden has dedicated his term to expanding NATO to counter the Kremlin\u2019s onslaught on Ukraine and threat to wider Europe. In one rare area of continuity with Trump, he\u2019s intensified a military and diplomatic pivot to counter China, although the ex-president\u2019s plan for a tariff war with Beijing would go far beyond Biden\u2019s efforts to stop a new Cold War turning hot. Israel\u2019s war in Gaza, which incessantly threatens to boil over, is a painful vulnerability for a sitting president, as his rival warns that World War III may be about to spark. Trump\u2019s main critique is that Biden is weak \u2013 a caricature that could resonate with some voters. But his own plans are as nebulous as his unlikely plan to end the Ukraine war in 24 hours and his unprovable claim that conflicts in Europe and the Middle East would \u201cnever have happened\u201d if he\u2019d been in office. And Trump seems more at home with authoritarians like Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, who dream of crushing US power, than democratic allies America liberated in the last cataclysmic global conflict. Some of the ex-president\u2019s former White House officials warn he might try to pull the United States out of NATO, the cornerstone of Western security, if he returns to the White House. Voters must therefore pick between Biden\u2019s traditional internationalist foreign policies and a doubling down by Trump of the populist isolationism that turned the United States from the bulwark of global stability into one of its most volatile sources of instability. Two legacies on display For the first time in American history, two presidents will stand side-by-side on a debate stage with their legacies exposed for everyone to judge. (The only other time a former and current president competed for a second term was in 1892, when candidates didn\u2019t actively campaign, let alone debate one another.) The meeting of incumbents is one most voters would have preferred to avoid. And so far, their fears seem to be realized. The tied race means two candidates either side of 80 are struggling to show they\u2019ve got the policies to fix the nation\u2019s problems. And neither so far has shown the vision to conjure a road map to the future that millions of Americans will inhabit long after both are gone. Trump\u2019s first term and sparse legislative record showed that he sees the presidency more as a channel for his wild personal whims rather than a policy laboratory. But his campaign, as well as allied conservative groups, have drawn up plans that, if implemented, would transform American governance. And a second-term administration stripped of restraining influences that frustrated the 45th president means he\u2019d have far more latitude to do what he wants. One irony of Trump\u2019s first term \u2014 and second term proposals \u2014 is that while he\u2019s shifted the Republican Party away from its corporate heritage toward a more working-class orientation, he pursues policies that disproportionately help richer Americans like himself. In his first term, he enacted tax cuts that favored the better off and he wants to extend them if he gets back the White House. Still, earlier this month, in an apparent bid to court support from hospitality workers in the key state of Nevada, he pledged to eliminate federal taxes on tips. And while he\u2019s proposing a draconian immigration policy, including mass deportations of undocumented migrants, Trump also says he wants more green cards for foreign graduates of US colleges \u2014 a step that may win favor among increasingly influential South Asian voters. The former president has also signaled he\u2019d dismiss Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, in a move that would raise concerns of political interference in the central bank but that could please Americans who want interest rate cuts. And the former president is working hard to enhance nostalgia for the Trump economy that was thriving before the pandemic-induced economic crisis. If he concentrates on economic messaging rather than histrionics on Thursday night, the former president may be able to renew a connection with viewers alienated by his extreme behavior but who pine for easier economic times. Still, Biden is likely to argue that some of Trump\u2019s plans would be economically ruinous, including a proposed 10% tariff on foreign goods that some economists warn could reignite the inflation crisis and raise the cost of goods for US consumers. Biden has a humming policy machine. Several times a week, the president or Vice President Kamala Harris highlights a new aspect of the administration\u2019s attempt to honor its vows to reshape the economy, to lift up working Americans, to cut health care costs, cap drugs prices, create jobs, fight climate change, preserve abortion rights, reduce student debt and lower energy costs. But it is the curse of Biden\u2019s term that his efforts rarely get much credit despite a legislative legacy that is as impressive as any Democrat since President Lyndon Johnson. Part of this may lie in the fact that measures like Biden\u2019s bipartisan infrastructure plan may take years to fully come into force. The president is still yet to figure out a way to claim credit for an economy that rebounded more strongly from the Covid-19 emergency than those of other developed countries while also acknowledging the pain many voters still feel. High grocery prices represent a literal and psychological barrier \u2014 even if the worst inflation crisis in 40 years has now moderated. It\u2019s still hard for many Americans to afford a new car or a mortgage because of high interest rates introduced to lower the cost of living. This leaves Biden badly needing to use Thursday night\u2019s debate to convince voters that he can make their lives better \u2014 and soon. He\u2019s tried it once already. During his State of the Union address in March, Biden praised citizens for authoring \u201cthe greatest comeback story.\u201d But it didn\u2019t do him any good politically. \u00a0In an ABC News/Ipsos poll conducted in late April, voters said they trusted Trump more than Biden on the economy and inflation, their top two issues, by margins of 46% to 32% and 44% to 30%. Post-game coverage of Thursday\u2019s debate is certain to zero in on the best verbal jabs, soundbites and the stamina and energy of the rival candidates. But the most meaningful impact of the clash between Trump and Biden will only begin to unfold after noon on Inauguration Day, January 20, 2025.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/25/politics/biden-trump-debate-issues-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/30/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_29_politics_trump-campaign-gop-platform", "text": "Top advisers to Donald Trump are plotting an overhaul of the Republican Party platform that will dramatically slash its size and refocus the GOP around the former president\u2019s agenda for a second term. A memo from Trump campaign managers Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles dated Thursday criticized past platforms as too long and too heavily influenced by special interests and outside groups. A \u201cclear, concise and easily digestible\u201d platform will be easier for voters to understand and harder for political opponents to attack, they wrote. \u201cPublishing an unnecessarily verbose treatise will provide more fuel for our opponent\u2019s fire of misinformation and misrepresentation to voters,\u201d the memo said. \u201cIt is with that recognition that we will present a streamlined platform in line with President Trump\u2019s principled and popular vision for America\u2019s future.\u201d The memo, obtained Saturday by CNN, was first reported by The New York Times. The party\u2019s most recent platform, crafted in 2016 and reapproved in 2020, spans 66 pages. A person familiar with the planning said the goal for the upcoming platform is a concise document that is \u201ca couple dozen pages,\u201d written in clearer language and likely reflecting Trump\u2019s top priorities. That person went on to say that when platform committees convened ahead of previous conventions, their meetings were attended by lobbyists and special interest groups trying to insert specific line items for their clients into the party platform. LaCivita and Wiles wrote they want a platform that will \u201cfree our Party from the constraints of Washington jargon and the shackles of lobbyist influence.\u201d The memo comes amid intensifying anxiety from conservative groups over the direction of the platform ahead of next month\u2019s Republican National Convention in Milwaukee. There is especially concern among anti-abortion groups that Thursday\u2019s memo is signaling Trump intends to remove the platform\u2019s long-standing commitment to a federal abortion ban and an amendment to the US Constitution giving the unborn the same rights as people. \u201cThe party is fully united, and taking out the pro-life language risks dividing the party,\u201d said one Trump ally who is deeply involved in the anti-abortion movement and is aware of the memo from LaCivita and Wiles. The existing platform also lays out the party\u2019s opposition to same-sex marriage and new gun restrictions. It embraces changes to Medicare and Social Security for people under 55 \u2014 some of which has become fodder for Democratic messaging in recent election cycles. Trump\u2019s campaign is especially aware of how Democrats have weaponized the GOP platform in the past and is seeking to avoid a lengthy document full of potential landmines for the former president to navigate. \u201cThe platform is an opportunity to make our vision clear, and to lay out a framework for policy making, while rejecting any special interest influence that seeks to make public policy stray from our clear and straightforward objectives,\u201d LaCivita and Wiles wrote. But by laying down markers in advance of next month\u2019s convention, Trump\u2019s campaign is further asserting his dominance over a party more fully in his control. Already, Trump this year has ousted the party\u2019s previous chair, Ronna McDaniel, and installed close allies atop the GOP \u2014 his daughter-in-law Lara Trump and North Carolina GOP leader Michael Whatley. The platform committee, meanwhile, will be led by three close allies: Randy Evans, Trump\u2019s former ambassador to Luxembourg; Russell Vought, a top official in the Trump administration; and Ed Martin, president of the right-wing interest group the Phyllis Schlafly Eagles and author of the 2016 book \u201cThe Conservative Case for Trump.\u201d That committee will meet behind closed doors ahead of the convention, which begins July 15. Unlike in previous years, its deliberations will not be broadcast by C-SPAN, a source confirmed.

{"id": "2024_06_28_politics_foreign-diplomats-biden-debate-reaction", "text": "President Joe Biden\u2019s dismal showing at the CNN presidential debate against former President Donald Trump resonated around the world, with foreign diplomats expressing shock and concern while raising questions about the\u00a0implications for\u00a0a consequential\u00a0US election\u00a0that could upend the foreign policy status-quo should Trump be\u00a0elected again. \u201cHard to\u00a0watch\u201d is how multiple foreign diplomats described\u00a0Thursday night\u2019s\u00a0debate between Biden and Trump\u00a0to CNN. The overwhelming sentiment among more than half a dozen diplomats from Europe, the Middle East and Asia whom\u00a0CNN spoke to\u00a0was that it was \u201ca bad night for Biden,\u201d as one European diplomat\u00a0put it. \u201cIt is a sad reality that Biden is\u00a0old,\u00a0and he is getting older. We saw it. I had difficulties understanding what he was saying, and I understand English pretty well,\u201d said a second European diplomat. \u201cTrump ate him alive,\u201d said an Arab diplomat. \u201cI was shell-shocked. I could not believe my eyes,\u201d an Asian diplomat said of Biden\u2019s performance. Biden\u2019s debate flop was\u00a0front-page\u00a0news across Europe, with left- and right-leaning\u00a0newspapers\u00a0excoriating the president \u2014 even in France, where the country has its own elections coming up this weekend. The president\u2019s debate\u00a0performance\u00a0also\u00a0compounded already pronounced\u00a0concerns about the policies Trump would likely enact if he wins in November.\u00a0Trump on Thursday\u00a0once again displayed his isolationist tendencies and his NATO-skeptic worldview that often alarmed US allies\u00a0during his first\u00a0presidential\u00a0term.\u00a0At\u00a0the debate, Trump questioned continuing to fund\u00a0Ukraine\u2019s war against Russia and\u00a0falsely\u00a0claimed\u00a0that the US had given more in aid to Ukraine than all other European countries put together. Trump even suggested that he had spoken to Russian President Vladimir Putin about his \u201cdream\u201d of invading\u00a0Ukraine. He also\u00a0attacked Biden over the Afghanistan withdrawal and argued it was the reason Putin invaded\u00a0Ukraine\u00a0in 2022. \u201cWhen Putin saw that, he said, you know what, I think we\u2019re going to go in and maybe take my \u2014 this was his dream. I talked to him about it, his dream. The difference is he never would have invaded Ukraine. Never,\u201d Trump said. A Ukrainian politician told CNN he found Trump\u2019s statements on the war in Ukraine \u201cworrying.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re very concerned because we, more or less, understand what it means for Ukraine, (a) Biden presidency, and we really don\u2019t know what it means for Ukraine, a Trump presidency,\u201d Oleksiy Goncharenko told CNN. \u201cIt can be very good, it can be very bad. We just don\u2019t know. And that\u2019s definitely concerning.\u201d \u2018If they can change the horse\u2019 Biden\u2019s showing\u00a0Thursday\u00a0did not make\u00a0the diplomats CNN spoke to\u00a0question his\u00a0ability to serve as commander in chief at this moment,\u00a0with many noting\u00a0that he has a good team working with him. But\u00a0some diplomats raised questions about how the Democratic Party will handle the issue. Polish Foreign Minister Radek Sikorski wrote on social media\u00a0that Biden should now responsibly manage a succession plan. \u201cMarcus Aurelius was a great emperor but he screwed up his succession by passing the baton to his feckless son Commudos (He, from the Gladiator). Whose disastrous role started Rome\u2019s decline. It\u2019s important to manage one\u2019s ride into the sunset,\u201d he\u00a0wrote. Another Polish diplomat didn\u2019t mince their words, calling Biden\u2019s performance \u201ca horror, what a car crash.\u201d Post-debate,\u00a0it wasn\u2019t just Democrats raising the prospect of replacing Biden on the ticket for November \u2014 foreign diplomats were also wondering whether Democrats could turn to a plan B. \u201cIf they can change the horse, they should,\u201d said the second European diplomat. \u201cIf it was possible to call the governor of California and have Biden\u00a0say,\u00a0\u2018You go and I\u2019ll step out,\u2019 that would be the right thing to do.\u201d But like many Americans, the diplomats woke up Friday unsure\u00a0of\u00a0what could\u00a0be done. \u201cThere are many options that are discussed, but we don\u2019t see, any that are self-evident,\u201d the\u00a0first European diplomat said. Some of them are reaching out to US contacts to get a sense of the likelihood of Democrats moving on from Biden. \u201cSome US contacts say there was always simmering debate about replacing Biden, but they say that now the doubts are in the open. There is fire on the roof,\u201d said a third European diplomat. \u201cI am told that if the Democrats do\u00a0this,\u00a0they have to go with Kamala (Harris), because they cannot skip over a\u00a0Black woman vice president, but they wonder what that will do to their base. They think they could still lose.\u201d \u2018The problem is there is no strategy\u2019 The\u00a0diplomats were not surprised\u00a0by Trump\u2019s comments on foreign policy\u00a0during\u00a0the debate\u00a0\u2014 with one calling it the \u201csame recipe as usual\u201d \u2014\u00a0but\u00a0they added\u00a0that\u00a0they\u00a0felt even\u00a0more\u00a0concerned about his lack of commitment to Ukraine and what\u00a0that\u00a0might mean for European security. \u201cTrump certainly won this. His worldview is problematic. So for those who believe in a rules-based\u00a0order,\u00a0Trump isn\u2019t good,\u201d said a NATO official. \u201cRules mean predictability, so Trump means unpredictability. He could go soft on Russia - he has a penchant for getting on with strongmen. He could also double down in supporting (Ukrainian President Volodymyr) Zelensky. The problem is there is no strategy, it all feels like it\u2019s done on impulse.\u201d Other diplomats also\u00a0observed that Trump\u2019s comments\u00a0on\u00a0the ongoing\u00a0Israel-Hamas war\u00a0would likely\u00a0hurt\u00a0him among Arab\u00a0American\u00a0voters. \u201cWhen he called Biden a\u00a0Palestinian,\u00a0that was bad. It was an insult to the Palestinians\u00a0\u2013\u00a0he lost Arab voters,\u201d the Arab diplomat said. \u201cHe could have said that he is the bigger Israel supporter in multiple other ways.\u201d Still, despite Trump\u2019s\u00a0reinforcing\u00a0of\u00a0longstanding\u00a0issues, there\u00a0was a real sense of shock and concern about Biden\u2019s performance and what it might mean for his chances in November. Biden pilloried in European media The diplomatic reaction was echoed by the British media.\u00a0In unusual unanimity,\u00a0the usually staid Financial Times\u00a0declared,\u00a0\u201cDemocrats panic,\u201d\u00a0with\u00a0the irrepressible tabloids, famous for their stinging critiques,\u00a0joining\u00a0the chorus \u2014 \u201cJoe\u2019Matosed\u201d declared\u00a0The Sun,\u00a0Britain\u2019s most popular tabloid. Another outlet,\u00a0the left-wing Guardian,\u00a0piled\u00a0on,\u00a0stating,\u00a0\u201cBiden Bombed.\u201d Biden\u2019s\u00a0stumbles on the Atlanta debate stage touched a nerve across the continent. Europe woke up to radio stations playing his at times halting, seemingly\u00a0confused,\u00a0comments. No nation was immune to concerns about Biden\u2019s performance. Even\u00a0in\u00a0France,\u00a0which is\u00a0facing its own surprise elections this weekend\u00a0where President Emmanuel\u00a0Macron\u2019s alliance confronts\u00a0a far-right challenge,\u00a0newspapers\u00a0took time out to lament the frailties of the man who\u00a0visited the country only a few weeks ago. The ubiquitous\u00a0left-leaning\u00a0Le Monde declared: \u201cAn old, worn-out, absent Biden: How the debate against Trump turned in to a disaster.\u201d Indeed, waves of worry seemed to ripple around the Mediterranean. Questions were raised about Biden stepping aside, from\u00a0Greece\u2019s\u00a0To\u00a0Vima\u00a0headline, \u201cBiden\u2019s time to exit the race,\u201d to Italy\u2019s Ansa and La Repubblica suggesting\u00a0that Democrats are\u00a0\u201clooking for an alternative.\u201d But where\u00a0much of\u00a0Europe\u2019s media seemed shocked, Russia\u2019s was positively gleeful. Moscow\u2019s\u00a0state TV station, Russia 1, lampooned Biden\u2019s debate performance. Show host Olga Skabeeva laughingly congratulated him for not falling over, then criticized him for what she called a 20-second freeze, saying he had trouble remembering who and where he was. Putin\u2019s spokesman said the Russian leader didn\u2019t stay up late to watch the debate and it \u201cis not on the list of the main issues on the agenda (of Putin).\u201d However, it seems reasonable to surmise he will be up to speed with it now, if only through the unfriendly filter of\u00a0his\u00a0own media. That Russian TV parodied Biden so soon after the debate likely reflects the Russian\u00a0president\u2019s mood, probably buoyed that\u00a0Trump,\u00a0who criticized NATO, hinted at cutting funding for\u00a0Ukraine\u00a0and said there would be peace in Ukraine before the end of the year. Behind closed doors, no doubt, Europe\u2019s leaders\u00a0will be reflecting less on the froth and flailing of Biden\u2019s performance and more on the substance of what they heard. After all, many of them met Biden at the G7\u00a0summit\u00a0in Italy a fortnight ago, so his frailty was likely\u00a0not\u00a0a surprise. Both days at the luxurious resort hotel in\u00a0southern\u00a0Italy\u2019s spectacular Puglia\u00a0region,\u00a0Biden kept them waiting for half an hour, showing up late for no apparent reason, and even then, at times seemed slightly out of sorts. \u201cIt was obvious that he was old,\u201d one diplomat told CNN. \u201cAt one point he wanted to sit and there was no chair\u2026 he was moving slowly. Stupid things, but they showed that he\u2019s an old person who needs assistance.\u00a0We all noticed it,\u201d the diplomat said. Asked if their observations gave them concerns about Biden\u2019s decision- and policy-making, the diplomat said no. \u201cWe aren\u2019t worried about his policies,\u201d they said. \u201cIf you have a president who works three hours a day, with a good team, and makes good decisions, that\u2019s OK.\u201d And a\u00a0Trump\u00a0redux\u00a0is the last thing most European leaders want, with the world far more dangerous now than when he left office.

{"id": "2024_06_26_politics_biden-trump-contrast-debate-analysis", "text": "The Almighty won\u2019t be standing on stage alongside Joe Biden on Thursday night. But Donald Trump will. Biden\u2019s team is seizing on the most critical presidential debate in years to spell out a contrast on character and policy that it believes will decide the 2024 election, if only voters will finally perceive it. It\u2019s the embodiment of one of Biden\u2019s own, rather defensive jokes \u2014 the idea that he doesn\u2019t need to be universally popular, just more acceptable than the other guy, who, happily for him, happens to be the most extreme ex-president of modern times. \u201cMy dad used to say, \u2018Joey, don\u2019t compare me to the Almighty. Compare me to the alternative,\u2019\u201d the president has said for years at rallies. The argument is a safety net for a president with the kind of low approval ratings that would normally condemn him to a single term and who has struggled to sell his achievements to voters. Biden\u2019s team is setting up Trump as an \u201cunhinged\u201d and criminal agent of vengeance unfit for a return to the presidency who will only look after himself, rich friends, and anti-abortion zealots. Biden is reflected in this conceit as a bulwark of stability and a guardian of the country\u2019s democratic values who is tirelessly striving to improve workers\u2019 lives. Biden\u2019s campaign laid the groundwork for the Atlanta showdown hosted by CNN in a weekend memo. \u201cThursday\u2019s debate will be one of the first moments in this presidential campaign where a larger slice of the American electorate will have the opportunity to witness the stark choice between Joe Biden, who is fighting for the American people and Donald Trump who is fighting for himself as a convicted felon with an unhinged campaign of regency and retribution,\u201d Biden campaign communications director Michael Tyler wrote. Campaign co-chair Mitch Landrieu highlighted the contrast on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d on Sunday. \u201cThe American people have to think about the wisdom, the character, and the judgment of the person that they\u2019re going to appoint to lead America not only at home but also to the rest of the world.\u201d And CNN\u2019s Kayla Tausche reported Tuesday that several top Democrats outside the White House want Biden to stop trying to claim credit for his achievements \u2014 including roaring jobs growth and a strong legislative record \u2014 and to go after Trump directly. \u201cHe wants the credit, but it\u2019s not working,\u201d one top Democrat, who had shared concerns with the campaign, said. How the 2024 election is different It\u2019s not unusual for an incumbent to try to savage an opponent\u2019s character and credentials to bolster a tough reelection bid. In 2004, President George W. Bush\u2019s team slandered Democrat John Kerry\u2019s Vietnam War heroism to portray him as too weak to lead the war on terror. In 2012, President Barack Obama\u2019s campaign presented Republican nominee Mitt Romney as a rich and callous corporate shark with an empty soul who relished sacking workers. Both of those attacks worked. But this is not a conventional campaign and Trump is not a conventional candidate. Democrats have been frustrated that the ex-president\u2019s return to the political spotlight and his romp to the GOP nomination have not already cemented the comparison and rendered him politically unacceptable. And the idea that voters will finally connect the dots depends on the premise that most Americans, unlike political obsessives in the campaigns and media industries, don\u2019t think about politics and presidential elections most of the time. They just need a nudge to remind them of how things used to be, the thinking goes. If Trump rants and vents his 2020 election lies on Thursday, he will play into Biden\u2019s hands. But while the television audience will be vast, the idea that there will be a moment of national realization about Trump\u2019s perceived threat seems more suited to the age of Cronkite than the age of TikTok. Biden, whom many voters believe is too old to serve a second term that would end when he is 86, is also under pressure to create a vision for the future for a weary electorate tired of high prices. He must therefore project certainty, stamina and authority on his own behalf to make the comparison work. But there is a deeper issue about the president\u2019s approach. Can it really be true that, eight years after Trump won the White House and three years after his turbulent presidency ended in violence, voters don\u2019t fully understand who Trump is? His dominance of media coverage makes it seem like he never went away. And voters would have to be hugely disengaged to not know that he\u2019s a recently convicted felon, was impeached twice, refused to accept defeat in 2020, called a crowd to Washington, DC, and told followers to \u201cfight like hell\u201d before they beat up police officers and invaded the US Capitol. Trump has lost a massive civil fraud trial, been found liable for sexual assault in a defamation case and mused during the pandemic about using disinfectant to treat Covid-19 inside the body.\u00a0He spent weeks at his recent hush money trial in New York attacking judges, witnesses, the legal system and vowing to use the presidency as a vehicle of personal and political revenge if he wins a second term. But he\u2019s still locked in a neck-and-neck race with Biden and has been leading in many of the critical swing states that pave the way to the 270 electoral votes needed to win the presidency. Biden and his fellow Democrats might see Trump as unacceptable. But he\u2019s not to millions of voters. The tied race reflects a nation split in two, politically and culturally, and is a commentary on Biden\u2019s unpopularity. And it reflects one of the most unusual aspects of this election. There are two presidents, both with a one-term record, competing for the White House. Voters don\u2019t really need to question how Trump would behave as president \u2014 they\u2019ve already seen it, even if a second term for the 45th president already looks like it would be more extreme and volatile than the first. How Trump could seek to frustrate Biden\u2019s strategy Assuming the Biden campaign sticks to this contrast strategy, Trump could thwart it by putting on a show of temperance and arriving with a list of plans to impress voters worried about their personal finances. There were isolated occasions during Trump\u2019s presidency when he met expectations of decorum. Karl Rove, the architect of Bush\u2019s 2004 reelection victory, wrote in his Wall Street Journal column last week that \u201cMr. Trump can\u2019t come off as unhinged or enraged. The words \u2018rigged election\u2019 shouldn\u2019t pass his lips. He has to keep his cool and can\u2019t make it all about himself.\u201d That\u2019s shrewd advice but Trump almost never behaves that way. Some of the former president\u2019s supporters have been transmitting advice on TV. South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, for instance, said on NBC over the weekend that the debate would be a \u201cgreat opportunity for President Trump to talk about \u2026 how his policies when he served as president of this country were good for every single family that lived here. They had more money in their pockets. The grocery prices were down. Gas prices were down.\u201d She added: \u201cI don\u2019t think that he has to get personal in this debate at all.\u201d The former president has taken part in multiple policy sessions with supporters despite his disdain for formal debate practice. But the script often gets tossed out when he goes live. The unusual circumstances of Thursday\u2019s debate could work in Trump\u2019s favor. Microphones will be muted to ensure both candidates can use their time without interruptions. That could avoid the mayhem of the first Trump v. Biden debate in 2020. The then-president\u2019s feverish demeanor was partly explained days later when he was rushed to hospital with a serious case of Covid-19. But Biden\u2019s admonition, \u201cShut up, man!\u201d gave voice to voters tired of four years of Trumpian cacophony. In another break from previous years, there will be no live audience for the debate inside a CNN studio in Atlanta. Often, Trump\u2019s most extreme rhetoric erupts when he works a crowd and doubles down on comments that get a strong reaction. Still, the encounter will mark the ex-president\u2019s reacquaintance with an opponent he blames for what he falsely claims is a campaign of persecution that threatens his fortune and his liberty. And Trump hasn\u2019t exactly been strategic ahead of the debate. His campaign has spent days trying to roll back his expectations of Biden as a doddering, elderly president who can\u2019t string two words together. Now, his team is insisting Biden will be \u201cjacked up\u201d on drugs. After months of suggesting Biden is too senile to serve, the Trump campaign\u2019s strategy now seems illogical as it paints a picture of a supreme debater who, by implication, would seem to be of presidential timber. Trump senior advisor Jason Miller, for instance, said on Tuesday, \u201cWe know that when it comes to the big events, when it comes to debates, when it comes to State of the Union, things of that nature, that they\u2019re going to have Joe Biden completely super soldiered up.\u201d Miller added: \u201cHe is going to be ready to go. He has a certain muscle memory that kicks in for having done this for 50 years.\u201d Democrats will be hoping that\u2019s true and that he can live up to the contrast with his rival staked out by Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren during a two-day swing through battleground Wisconsin. Biden, she said, is \u201ca good and decent man who will protect freedom for women across this country and who is fighting to lower costs for working families.\u201d Warren added, \u201cLet Donald Trump be Donald Trump, the guy who panders to an extremist base and who has said to his rich as hell donors that if they\u2019ll just put more money into his campaign, he\u2019ll give them giant tax cuts and cut back regulations on climate.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/26/politics/biden-trump-contrast-debate-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/30/2024", "section": "politics"}}

{"id": "2024_06_28_politics_key-lines-cnn-debate-what-matters", "text": "In CNN\u2019s presidential debate, President Joe Biden was halting and, at times, trailed off and confused words, feeding a nagging narrative about his fitness for the presidency. Former President Donald Trump refused to answer simple questions about accepting election results and repeatedly overinflated his record, confirming concerns about the chaos his potential victory in November could create. Insults over policy Given the opportunity to answer questions about policy, like how to lower the staggering cost of child care, the men engaged in a back-and-forth about whether presidential scholars think Trump was the worst president in history. Biden called Trump a \u201cwhiner.\u201d Trump said Biden, \u201clike so many politicians \u2026 is just a complainer.\u201d Later, a question about whether either of the elderly men is fit to lead the country turned into a dispute about who is the better golfer. Trump said Biden couldn\u2019t drive a golf ball 50 yards, and Biden challenged Trump to a golf match but only if Trump carries his own clubs. It was that kind of night. It is difficult to include detailed quotes about their policy statements, Trump\u2019s in particular, because they were so misleading. Read CNN\u2019s full fact check. Here\u2019s a look at some of the lines that stood out: On the economy CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper, who moderated the debate in Atlanta with Dana Bash, noted the well-documented angst in the country about the economy and asked Biden what he\u2019d say to people who feel they\u2019re worse off on his watch. Trump, as he frequently does on a range of issues, embellished the facts in his response by saying that the economy he oversaw was the best in history until the Covid-19 pandemic. Trump repeatedly tried to blame inflation entirely on Biden. Biden argued inflation was not an issue four years ago because the economy was in such bad shape. When Biden trailed off The president was making a point about the tax cuts, enacted by Trump, which have helped grow the national debt. Biden was trying explain that he supports tax increases on the wealthiest Americans to pay for many social goals, but the words got jumbled. It was an awkward moment since it was not clear what Biden meant. Trump was quick with a misleading response. That\u2019s misleading since Medicare and Social Security also need more younger workers paying into them to cover the costs of older workers currently looking toward retirement. On abortion rights Trump said \u201ceverybody\u201d wanted Roe v. Wade overturned, which is not at all true since opinion polls suggested most Americans wanted it kept in place. Not in Trump\u2019s telling. Trump also misread the divided politics of abortion rights at the moment, in which voters in some states are protecting abortion rights and legislatures in other states are curtailing them. Voters, given the opportunity, have generally tried to protect abortion rights. That\u2019s hardly a picture of unity. Trump then said some incorrect things about late-term abortions under Roe v. Wade before trying to end on a high note. Biden clearly disagreed and argued allowing states to each have completely different abortion policies is like allowing states to have completely different civil rights laws. But on an issue that Democrats hope will unify voters against Trump and Republicans, Biden offered one of his least coherent answers. Instead, apparently trying to make a point about the need for abortion access for people who have been raped, the president fed Trump\u2019s flawed narrative about migrant crime. Try to follow this: On immigration This a top issue for Trump, and he kept returning to it, arguing the country was safer under him. Biden noted there\u2019s no evidence to support these broad claims about people seeking asylum in the US from other parts of the world and said Trump was lying. These are claims Trump frequently repeats. In a new riff at the debate as he tries to siphon African American support from Democrats, Trump said an influx of migrants at the border were \u201ctaking Black jobs.\u201d Biden argued voters should trust him on immigration since he tried to get a bipartisan agreement passed in Congress to give the president new powers to address an influx of migrants, cut down on the flow of drugs and give new money to border patrol and immigration courts. Biden also pointed out Trump\u2019s policy of intentional family separation during a portion of his presidency. On veterans Biden turned from the immigration debate to his treatment of veterans, pointing out he signed legislation to expand care for veterans exposed to burn pits and toxic substances. He mentioned his late son, Beau, who died of cancer years after serving in Iraq. And Biden repeated a story told by Trump\u2019s former White House chief staff, retired Marine Gen. John Kelly, that Trump declined to visit a World War I cemetery in France because he thought people who fought in wars were \u201csuckers.\u201d Biden\u2019s description of this anecdote seemed to anger Trump. The former president kept coming back to it, disputing it throughout the debate. On Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine Trump, when pressed, said Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s demand to keep territory in Ukraine to end the war was unacceptable. But he also said the US is spending too much money helping Ukraine. Those separate points led Trump to make a bold claim. Biden noted the aid to Ukraine is mostly in the form of weapons, which are manufactured in the US. He also said Putin\u2019s goal is to reconstitute the Soviet Union. Putin will not stop at Ukraine, Biden said. There\u2019s not a way to verify this, of course. And Trump has a history of making bold claims that do not become true. On Israel and Gaza Biden said he will continue to push for a peace plan that has been endorsed by Israel and other countries but rejected by Hamas. He will also, he said, both support Israel and try to moderate the war when it comes to urban areas. Trump said he would not pressure Israel to moderate its actions. Biden, who describes himself as a Zionist and who has largely stood up to progressive Democrats who want him to more forcefully condemn Israel\u2019s actions in Gaza, said Trump had it wrong. \u201cI\u2019ve never heard so much foolishness,\u201d Biden said. When Trump was asked if he supported the creation of a Palestinian state, he would not directly answer, but instead complained about US foreign aid. \u201cWe\u2019re paying everybody\u2019s bills,\u201d Trump said. On protecting democracy Trump was asked by Tapper what he\u2019d say to voters who worry he violated his oath to uphold the Constitution on January 6, 2021, with his actions and inactions, and who worry that he\u2019ll do it again. He pointedly did not answer the question, but said this instead: Biden said Trump deserves blame for watching the riot at the Capitol unfold for hours without doing anything to intervene. On political retribution Trump was asked what he means by saying, after his conviction in a New York courtroom, that he\u2019d have every right to go after his political opponents. But then, after pointing out Biden\u2019s son, Hunter, was also recently convicted of a crime, Trump dialed back up on the idea of using the justice system against Biden. To which Biden said presidents should not be using the justice system in that way. Biden also\u00a0went into more salacious territory, listing off Trump\u2019s civil penalties for \u201cmolesting a woman in public.\u201d Actually, Trump was found liable for sexual abuse and defamation after the former magazine columnist E. Jean Carroll accused him of raping her in a department store dressing room. Biden also referenced Stormy Daniels \u2013 he referred to her as a \u201cporn star\u201d \u2013 who said she had an affair with Trump. Trump denied the affair with Daniels before attacking his criminal conviction in New York for hiding reimbursements to his then-attorney for hush money payments to Daniels before the 2016 election. The prosecution helped his polling and his fundraising \u201cbecause the public knows it\u2019s a scam,\u201d Trump said. On Hitler Biden said he initially ran for president in 2020 because of the deadly White nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, after which Trump said there were \u201cfine people\u201d on both sides. That was another reference to Kelly\u2019s recollection of Trump\u2019s comments. Trump, meanwhile, disputed Biden\u2019s own reason for running for president. On climate change Trump didn\u2019t actually acknowledge that climate change is a thing, but said that when he was president there was clean air and water. Trump\u2019s broad and unprovable comment almost seemed to flabbergast Biden, who stumbled over words in pointing out that on his watch, Democrats passed legislation to address climate change, which is an existential threat to people. On who is the worst president The question from Tapper was about the cost of child care, but the answers turned to who is a worse president. On golf Bash asked about Trump\u2019s age and his capabilities to serve, and his answer went from cognitive tests, which he claimed to have aced, to golf, where he claimed to be winning recent tournaments.  Biden also bragged about his golf game, saying he had close to a six handicap before correcting himself to saying it was, at one point, an eight. On accepting election results Trump repeatedly deflected when asked if he would accept the election results, finally settling on \u201cif it\u2019s a fair and legal and good election,\u201d before suggesting, again, that fraud kept him from the White House in 2020. Biden noted that no court or serious investigation ever found any evidence of any fraud. That\u2019s not a good sign for Trump accepting a potential 2024 loss, according to Biden.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/28/politics/key-lines-cnn-debate-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/30/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_24_politics_presidential-debate-history-what-matters", "text": "CNN\u2019s presidential debate will feel like something new for most Americans, but it is actually a return to the roots of presidential debates. Rather than a forum sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates, which had organized all general election presidential debates since 1988, the meeting Thursday between President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump will be hosted by CNN but simulcast on some other networks. CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper and Dana Bash will moderate the meeting at CNN\u2019s Atlanta studio and, unlike commission debates, there will be no live audience. That TV studio format is not unlike the first televised presidential debates in 1960 between then-Sen. John F. Kennedy and then-Vice President Richard Nixon. There was a series of four televised debates in September and October of 1960, all of which occurred in TV studios, although one featured Nixon in a Los Angeles studio and Kennedy in New York, according to a history maintained by the commission. Those first debates were the brain child of network TV executives, according to Alan Schroeder, professor emeritus of journalism at Northeastern University and author of \u201cPresidential Debates: Risky Business on the Campaign Trail.\u201d Kennedy is generally viewed as the winner of the 1960 debates, in part because of his comfort on camera. Nixon, meanwhile, did not wear makeup, did not practice the debate format and did not look like himself after a stay in the hospital due to a knee injury, Schroeder told me in a phone conversation. Nixon learned his lesson, and there were no debates for his subsequent White House runs in 1968 and 1972. The next presidential debates did not take place until 1976, when Nixon\u2019s successor, Gerald Ford, was in a similar position to Biden today. According to Schroeder, \u201che was looking for something dramatic to break the logjam\u201d of poor polling for the Republican after taking over the presidency following Nixon\u2019s Watergate-related resignation. During his speech to the Republican National Convention that year, Ford issued a challenge to Jimmy Carter to debate. But the gamble backfired when Ford flubbed an answer related to the Soviet Union dominating Eastern Europe. Carter was able to appear qualified and capable in front of a massive audience. That\u2019s a very different dynamic from today, when Americans have already experienced both a Biden and a Trump presidency. Four years later, Carter was less excited to debate. He skipped a forum featuring the Republican candidate, Ronald Reagan, and an independent candidate, John Anderson, and took part in only one debate with Reagan. Ultimately, the commission was formed to create a nonpartisan framework for presidential debates \u2013 something that has been exported to other countries. Schroeder said that while he preferred the old system of debates organized by the commission, it would make sense for campaigns to want to have more control over the process. The TV studio format will allow Biden to sidestep \u201cthe distraction of boisterous Trump supporters interrupting, carrying on with loud applause or laughing, all those things that that happen when you have a live audience, and particularly a very politicized live audience,\u201d Schroeder said. Another model for debates, from the pre-Civil War era, relied on massive live audiences and featured Abraham Lincoln and Stephen Douglas. But the so-called Lincoln-Douglas debates did not take place during the 1860 presidential election, when the two were both candidates and when Lincoln won the White House. Instead, the debates occurred in 1858, and focused on the issue of slavery when the two men were running for Senate in Illinois. Douglas kept the Illinois Senate seat, but the debates gave Lincoln a national profile and helped him on the way to the White House. Don\u2019t expect a Lincoln-Douglas-style debate on TV. While more than 10,000 people attended most of the debates, held in locations across Illinois, they would seem extremely long-winded for someone with a 21st century attention span. The first speaker would get a 60-minute opening statement. The second got a 90-minute response. And the first speaker got a final 30-minute rebuttal. CNN\u2019s entire debate will last 90 minutes and include two commercial breaks. It will not feature opening statements, although each candidate will get a closing statement. After a coin toss, Biden is set to give the first closing statement and Trump will go last. Read more about the debate setup. The debate will be watched live by millions on CNN and other TV networks, but unlike the Kennedy-Nixon debates, it will continue to be digested by potential voters in video clips on social media after it airs. For the large portion of Americans who already know how they\u2019ll vote, it\u2019s unlikely a debate performance will change their minds, but Schroeder argued there are people who haven\u2019t expressed a preference. \u201cThey\u2019re still up for grabs,\u201d he said. \u201cThis debate and the one (hosted by ABC News) in September are likely to be events that would attract the people who don\u2019t normally pay a lot of attention to politics.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/24/politics/presidential-debate-history-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/30/2024", "section": "politics"}}

{"id": "2024_06_27_politics_fact-checking-the-cnn-presidential-debate", "text": "Both President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump made false and misleading claims during CNN\u2019s presidential debate on Thursday \u2013 but Trump did so far more than Biden, just like in their\u00a0debates in 2020. Trump made more than\u00a030 false claims at the Thursday debate. They included numerous claims that CNN and others have already debunked during the current presidential campaign or prior. Trump\u2019s repeat falsehoods included his assertions that some Democratic-led states\u00a0allow babies to be executed after birth, that\u00a0every legal scholar and everybody in general wanted Roe v. Wade overturned, that there were\u00a0no terror attacks during his presidency, that\u00a0Iran didn\u2019t fund terror groups during his presidency,\u00a0that\u00a0the US has provided more aid to Ukraine than Europe has, that\u00a0Biden for years referred to Black people as \u201csuper predators,\u201d that Biden is\u00a0planning to quadruple people\u2019s taxes, that\u00a0then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi turned down 10,000 National Guard troops for the US Capitol on January 6, 2021,\u00a0that Americans don\u2019t pay the cost of his tariffs on China and other countries, that\u00a0Europe accepts no American cars, that\u00a0he is the president who got the Veterans Choice program through Congress, and\u00a0that fraud marred the results of the 2020 election. Trump also added some new false claims, such as his assertions that the US currently has its biggest budget deficit and its biggest trade deficit with China. Both records actually occurred under Trump. Biden made at least nine false or misleading claims in the debate. He used false numbers while describing two of his key Medicare policies, falsely claimed that no US troops had been killed on his watch, repeated his\u00a0usual misleading figure\u00a0about billionaires\u2019 tax rates, baselessly claimed that Trump wants to eliminate Social Security, falsely said that the unemployment rate was 15% when he took office, inaccurately said that the Border Patrol union had endorsed him before clarifying that he was talking about agents\u2019 support for the border bill he had backed, and exaggerated Trump\u2019s 2020 comments about the possibility of treating Covid-19 by injecting disinfectant. Here is a detailed fact check from CNN\u2019s reporting team of some of those claims. Trump on abortion policy after Roe v. Wade Trump repeated his frequent claim that \u201ceverybody\u201d wanted Roe v. Wade overturned and the power to set abortion policy returned to individual states. He said: \u201cEverybody wanted to get it back to the states, everybody, without exception: Democrats, Republicans, liberals, conservatives. Everybody wanted it back. Religious leaders.\u201d He also added: \u201c\u00a0Every legal scholar wanted it that way.\u201d Facts First: Trump\u2019s claims arefalse. Poll after poll has shown that most Americans \u2013 two-thirds or nearly two-thirds of respondents in multiple polls \u2013 wish Roe would have been preserved. And multiple legal scholars have told CNN that they had wanted Roe preserved. A CNN poll conducted by SSRS in April 2024 found 65% of adults opposed the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to overturn Roe. That\u2019s nearly identical to the result of a CNN poll conducted by SSRS in July 2022, the month after the decision. Similarly, a Marquette Law School poll in February 2024 found 67% of adults opposed the decision that overturned Roe. A NBC News poll in June 2023 found 61% opposition among registered voters to the decision that overturned Roe. A Gallup poll in May 2023 found 61% of adults called the decision a bad thing. And \u201cany claim that all legal scholars wanted Roe overturned is mind-numbingly false,\u201d Rutgers Law School professor Kimberly Mutcherson, a legal scholar who supported the preservation of Roe, said in April. \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s claim is flatly incorrect,\u201d another legal scholar who did not want Roe overturned, Maya Manian, an American University law professor and faculty director of the university\u2019s Health Law and Policy Program, said in April. Trump\u2019s claim is \u201cobviously not\u201d true, said Mary Ziegler, a law professor at the University of California, Davis, who is an expert on the history of the US abortion debate. Ziegler, who also did not want Roe overturned, said in an April interview: \u201cMost legal scholars probably track most Americans, who didn\u2019t want to overturn Roe. \u2026 It wasn\u2019t as if legal scholars were somehow outliers.\u201d It is true that some legal scholars who support abortion rights wished that Roe had been written differently; the late liberal Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was one of them. But Ziegler noted that although \u201cthere was a cottage industry of legal scholars kind of rewriting Roe \u2013 \u2018what Roe should\u2019ve said\u2019 \u2014 that isn\u2019t saying Roe should\u2019ve been overturned. Those are very different things.\u201d You can read more here. From CNN\u2019s Daniel Dale Trump on Democrats and abortion Trump repeated his frequent claim that Democrats will kill babies in the \u201ceighth month, the ninth month of pregnancy, or even after birth.\u201d After Biden said that he would \u201crestore Roe v. Wade\u201d if reelected, Trump said, \u201cSo that means he can take the life of the baby in the ninth month and even after birth, because some states \u2013 Democrat-run \u2013 take it after birth.\u201dTrump pointed to the former Virginia governor\u2019s support of a bill that would loosen restrictions on late-term abortions as an example. Trump also said later in the debate that some \u201cDemocrat-run\u201d states allow babies to be killed after birth. Facts First: Trump\u2019s claim about Democrats killing babies after birth is nonsense; that is infanticide and illegal in all 50 states. A very small percentage of abortions happen at or after 21 weeks of pregnancy.\u00a0 According to data published by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, just 0.9% of reported abortions in 2020 occurred at 21 weeks or later. (Many of these abortions occur because of serious health risks or lethal fetal anomalies.) By contrast, 80.9% of reported abortions in 2020 were conducted before 10 weeks, 93.1% before 14 weeks and 95.8% before 16 weeks. Trump invoked controversial comments made in 2019 by Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam, a Democrat, as he voiced support for a state measure that would significantly loosen restrictions on late-term abortions when the fetus was not viable. Northam was not talking about infanticide, which Virginia continues to prohibit. There are some cases in which parents decide to choose palliative care for babies who are born with deadly conditions that give them just minutes, hours or days to live. That is simply not the same as killing a baby. From CNN\u2019s Daniel Dale and Jen Christensen Trump on the \u2018suckers\u2019 and \u2018losers\u2019 controversy\u00a0\u00a0 Trump denied that he had used the words \u201csuckers\u201d or \u201closers\u201d to describe members of the US military who had been killed in action, after Biden pointed to the remarks to criticize his predecessor\u2019s record on supporting veterans. And he claimed that the idea he had made these remarks was \u201cmade up by him,\u201d Biden. Facts First: Trump\u2019s claim that Biden made up this story is false. The story was initially reported by The Atlantic. The magazine, citing four unnamed sources with \u201cfirsthand knowledge,\u201d reported in 2020 that on the day Trump canceled a visit to a military cemetery in France where US troops who were killed in World War I are buried, he had told members of his senior staff, \u201cWhy should I go to that cemetery? It\u2019s filled with losers.\u201d The magazine also reported that in another conversation on the same trip, Trump had referred to marines who had been killed in the region as \u201csuckers.\u201d\u00a0 John Kelly, who served as Trump\u2019s White House chief of staff and secretary of Homeland Security, has said on the record that in 2018 Trump did use the words \u201csuckers\u201d and \u201closers\u201d to refer to servicemembers who were killed in action. Kelly told CNN anchor Jim Sciutto for Sciutto\u2019s 2024 book that Trump would say: \u201cWhy do you people all say that these guys who get wounded or killed are heroes? They\u2019re suckers for going in the first place, and they\u2019re losers.\u201d There is no public recording of Trump making such remarks, so we can\u2019t definitively call Trump\u2019s denial false. But it wasn\u2019t Biden\u2019s invention. From CNN\u2019s Daniel Dale and Kaanita Iyer\u00a0 Biden on his record as commander-in-chief Biden claimed that he is the only president this decade \u201cthat doesn\u2019t have any \u2026 troops dying anywhere in the world, like he did,\u201d referring to Trump. \u201cTruth is, I\u2019m the only president this century, that doesn\u2019t have any, this decade, that doesn\u2019t have any troops dying anywhere in the world, like he did,\u201d Biden said. Facts First:\u00a0Biden is wrong. US service members have died abroad during his presidency, including 13 troops killed in a suicide bombing during the US withdrawal from Afghanistan. Thirteen US service members \u2014 including 11 Marines, one Army special operations soldier, and one Navy corpsman \u2014 were\u00a0killed in the suicide bombing\u00a0at the Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul. Three US soldiers were also\u00a0killed this year\u00a0at a small US outpost in Jordan in a one-way drone attack launched by Iran-backed militants.\u00a0And two US Navy SEALs\u00a0died in January\u00a0off the coast of Somalia while conducting a night-time seizure of lethal aid being transported from Iran to Yemen. Other US service members have also died abroad in training incidents, including\u00a0five\u00a0US soldiers who died in a helicopter crash in the eastern Mediterranean Sea in November 2023 during a routine refueling mission, and\u00a0eight US airmen\u00a0who died in a CV-22 Osprey crash in November 2023 off the coast of Yakushima Island, Japan. From CNN\u2019s Haley Britzky Trump on Biden and the term \u201csuper predators\u201d Trump claimed that Biden called Black people \u201csuper predators\u201d for a decade in the 1990s. \u201cWhat he\u2019s done to the Black population is horrible, including the fact that for 10 years he called them \u2018super predators\u2019 \u2013 in the 1990s \u2013 we can\u2019t forget that,\u201d Trump said. Facts First: Trump\u2019s claim is false. Biden never publicly deployed the phrase \u201csuper predators\u201d or endorsed the criminological theory behind it (which held that there was a new breed of highly and remorselessly violent young offenders), let alone do so for 10 years. Biden did refer to \u201cpredators on our streets\u201d who were \u201cbeyond the pale\u201d while promoting the 1994 crime bill, but he did not specify that he was talking about people of any particular race. As reported by CNN\u2019s KFILE in 2019, Biden said in a 1993 Senate floor speech in support of the crime bill that \u201cwe have predators on our streets that society has in fact, in part because of its neglect, created.\u201d And he urged the government to focus on the people he said were in danger of becoming \u201cthe predators 15 years from now\u201d if their lives weren\u2019t changed \u2013 \u201cthe cadre of young people, tens of thousands of them, born out of wedlock, without parents, without supervision, without any structure, without any conscience developing because they literally \u2026 have not been socialized, they literally have not had an opportunity.\u201d But Biden did not speak of \u201csuper predators.\u201d Four years later, in a 1997 hearing, he noted that the vast majority of youth criminal cases involved nonviolent offenses and said, \u201cWhen we talk about the juvenile justice system, we have to remember that most of the youth involved in the system are not the so-called super predators.\u201d It was Trump\u2019s opponent in the 2016 presidential election, Hillary Clinton, who affirmatively used the phrase \u201csuper predators\u201d as she argued in support of the 1994 crime bill (in 1996). She said in 2016 that she shouldn\u2019t have used that language. Trump wrote in a 2000 book that he supported tougher sentencing and street policing and warned of \u201cwolf packs\u201d of young criminals roaming the streets \u2013 and he cited a since-discredited statistical analysis that was linked to the \u201csuper predator\u201d theory. From CNN\u2019s Holmes Lybrand and Daniel Dale Trump on Iran\u2019s funding for Hamas and Hezbollah\u00a0 Trump claimed that when he was president, Iran \u201chad no money for Hamas\u201d and no money \u201cfor terror.\u201d \u201cDo you wanna know why? Because Iran was broke with me. I wouldn\u2019t let anybody do business with them. They ran out of money. They were broke,\u201d he said. \u201cThey had no money for Hamas, they had no money for anything. No money for terror. That\u2019s why you had no terror, at all, during my administration. This place, the whole world is blowing up under him.\u201d He added later that Iran also had \u201cno money\u201d for Hezbollah. Facts First: Trump\u2019s claims that Iran had \u201cno money for Hamas,\u201d \u201cno money for terror\u201d and no money for Hezbollah during his presidency is false. Iran\u2019s funding for such groups did decline in the second half of his presidency, in large part because his sanctions on the country had a major negative impact on the Iranian economy, but the funding never stopped entirely, as four experts told CNN earlier this month.\u00a0\u00a0 Trump\u2019s own administration said in 2020 that Iran was continuing to fund terror groups including Hezbollah. The Trump administration began imposing sanctions on Iran in late 2018, pursuing a campaign known as \u201cmaximum pressure.\u201d But Trump-appointed Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said himself in 2020 that Iran was continuing to fund terror groups. \u201cSo you continue to have, in spite of the Iranian leadership demanding that more money be given to them, they are using the resources that they have to continue funding Hezbollah in Lebanon and threatening the state of Israel, funding Iraqi terrorist Shia groups, all the things that they have done historically \u2013 continuing to build out their capabilities even while the people inside of their own country are suffering,\u201d Pompeo said in a May 2020 interview, according to a transcript posted on the State Department\u2019s website. Trump could have fairly said that his sanctions on Iran had made life more difficult for terror groups (though it\u2019s unclear how much their operations were affected). Instead, he continued his years-old practice of exaggerating even legitimate achievements. You can read a more detailed fact check from earlier in June here. From CNN\u2019s Daniel Dale Biden on drug prices Biden touted two measures that his administration and congressional Democrats have enacted to reduce drug prices. \u201cWe brought down the price of prescription drugs, which is a major issue for many people, to $15 for a insulin shot as opposed to $400. No senior has to pay more than $200 for any drug \u2026 beginning next year,\u201d Biden said. Facts First: Biden is wrong. He incorrectly described two key provisions of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act that aim to reduce prescription drug costs for Medicare beneficiaries. Under the law, Medicare enrollees don\u2019t pay more than $35 a month for each insulin prescription. The law also placed a cap on Medicare\u2019s Part D drug plans so that seniors and people with disabilities won\u2019t pay more than $2,000 a year in out-of-pocket costs for medications bought at the pharmacy, starting in 2025. Biden corrected himself later in the debate to use the $2,000 figure when talking about the cap on those out-of-pocket costs. From CNN\u2019s Tami Luhby Biden on border crossings dropping during his administration\u00a0 Biden said border crossings had dropped 40% since he took executive action to tighten the border in early June, arguing that the numbers are better than when Trump left office. \u201cWhat I\u2019ve done since I changed the law, what\u2019s happened? I\u2019ve changed it in a way that now you\u2019re in situation where there are 40% fewer people coming across the border illegally,\u201d Biden said. Facts First: This is misleading. The number of daily encounters at the US southern border dropped 40% following Biden\u2019s executive action restricting asylum access earlier this month. While there\u2019s been a recent drop in border crossings, the number of people crossing the US-Mexico border was generally lower during the Trump administration. From CNN\u2019s Priscilla Alvarez Biden on support from the Border Patrol union Biden said the Border Patrol union endorsed him, and then appeared to clarify and said the group \u201cendorsed (his) position.\u201d Facts First: This is misleading. The National Border Patrol Council, the union that represents Border Patrol agents, backed a bipartisan border deal reached by senators that included some of the toughest security measures in recent memory, but didn\u2019t endorse Biden. The deal failed in the Senate.\ufeff In a post on X, the union swiftly responded to the president Thursday: \u201cTo be clear, we never have and never will endorse Biden.\u201d From CNN\u2019s Priscilla Alvarez Trump on the National Guard in Minneapolis\u00a0 Trump said that he deployed the National Guard to Minneapolis in 2020 during the unrest that followed the murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer. \u201cWhen they ripped down Portland, when they ripped down many other cities. You go to Minnesota, Minneapolis, what they\u2019ve done there with the fires all over the city \u2013 if I didn\u2019t bring in the National Guard, that city would have been destroyed.\u201d Facts First: This is false. Minnesota Democratic Gov. Tim Walz, not Trump, deployed the Minnesota National Guard during the 2020 unrest; Walz first activated the Guard more than seven hours before Trump publicly threatened to deploy the Guard himself. Walz\u2019s office told CNN in 2020 that the governor activated the Guard in response to requests from officials in Minneapolis and St. Paul \u2013 cities also run by Democrats.\u00a0 You can read more here. From CNN\u2019s Holmes Lybrand and Daniel Dale Trump on the European Union\u2019s trade practices\u00a0 Trump, complaining about the European Union\u2019s trade practices, claimed that the EU doesn\u2019t accept US products, including American cars. \u201cThey don\u2019t want\u00a0anything that we have,\u201d Trump said Thursday. \u201cBut we\u2019re supposed to take their\u00a0cars, their food, their everything, their agriculture.\u201d Facts First: It\u2019s not true that the European Union won\u2019t take American products, including American cars, though some US exports do face EU trade barriers and though US automakers have often had a hard time gaining popularity with European consumers. The US exported about $368 billion in goods to the European Union in 2023 (while importing about $576 billion from the EU that year), federal figures show. According to a December 2023 report from the European Automobile Manufacturers\u2019 Association, the EU is the second-largest market for US vehicle exports \u2014 importing 271,476 US vehicles in 2022, valued at nearly 9 billion euro. (Some of these are vehicles made by European automakers at plants in the US.) The EU\u2019s Eurostat statistical office says that car imports from the US hit a new peak in 2020, Trump\u2019s last full year in office, at a value of about 11 billion euro. From CNN\u2019s Daniel Dale and Ella Nilsen\u00a0 Biden on Black unemployment\u00a0 Biden attempted to contrast himself with Trump on the economy. He said, \u201cBlack unemployment is the lowest level it\u2019s been in a long, long time.\u201d Facts First: This is false. While the Black or African American unemployment rate hit a record low under Biden in April 2023, 4.8%, the rate was up to 6.1% in May 2024 \u2013 higher than in eight months of the Trump presidency. From CNN\u2019s Daniel Dale and Kaanita Iyer\u00a0\u00a0 Trump on job growth during Biden\u2019s presidency\u00a0 Trump said of President Biden, \u201cThe only jobs he created were for illegal immigrants and \u2018bounce-back jobs,\u2019 a bounce-back from the Covid.\u201d Facts First: Trump\u2019s claims that the job growth during Biden\u2019s presidency has been all \u201cbounce-back\u201d gains where people went back to their old jobs is not fully correct. Nearly 22 million jobs were lost under Trump in March and April 2020 when the global economy cratered on account of the pandemic. Following substantial relief and recovery measures, the US started regaining jobs immediately, adding more than 12 million jobs from May 2020 through December 2020, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data. The recovery continued after Biden took office, with the US reaching and surpassing its pre-pandemic (February 2020) employment totals in June 2022. The job gains didn\u2019t stop there. Since June 2022, the US has added nearly 6.2 million more jobs in what\u2019s become the fifth-longest period of employment expansion on record. In total under Biden, 15.6 million jobs have been added. But it\u2019s not entirely fair nor accurate to say the jobs gained were all \u201cbounce-back\u201d or were people simply returning to their former positions. The pandemic drastically reshaped the employment landscape. For one, a significant portion of the labor force did not return due to early retirements,\u00a0deaths, long Covid\u00a0or caregiving responsibilities. Additionally, because of shifts in consumer spending patterns as well as health-and-safety implications, public-facing industries could not fully reopen or restaff immediately. Some of those workers found jobs in other industries or used the opportunity to start their own businesses. When the pandemic was more under control and in-person activities could fully resume, those industries faced worker shortages. The pandemic recovery included what\u2019s been called the Great Resignation or the Great Reshuffling, where people \u2013 for a variety of reasons \u2013 switched jobs or careers. From CNN\u2019s Alicia Wallace Trump on the Paris climate accord\u00a0 Trump claimed that the Paris climate accord would have cost the US $1 trillion, that it was the only country that had to pay, and that China, India and Russia weren\u2019t paying. Trump called the accord \u201ca rip-off of the United States.\u201d Facts First: Trump\u2019s claim that the US would alone have had to pay $1 trillion as part of the Paris climate accord is wildly inflated. As part of the Paris agreement, in 2009, the US and other developed nations, including Western European countries, committed to collectively\u00a0contribute $100 billion per year\u00a0by 2020 to help poorer, developing countries, predominantly in the Global South, adapt to the impacts of climate change like sea level rise and worsening heat. Developed nations\u00a0met their collective goal two years late\u00a0in 2022, but the figure has never been as high as Trump was suggesting \u2013 and the US has certainly never paid $1 trillion in international climate finance. Under the Obama administration, the US paid $1 billion of a $3 billion commitment it originally made in 2014. After Trump pulled the country out of the Paris accord, the US paid nothing to the global finance goal. And while Biden pledged $11.4 billion annually from the US, this level of funding hasn\u2019t materialized. That\u2019s because Congress, responsible for appropriating the nation\u2019s budget, has allocated only a fraction of that \u2013 roughly $1 billion in 2022. Trump is correct that countries including China, India and Russia have thus far not contributed to international climate finance. However, China\u2019s position as the largest global emitter means many countries are pressuring it to contribute to international climate finance through a formal process. From CNN\u2019s Ella Nilsen\u00a0 Trump on Biden and a Ukrainian prosecutor\u00a0 Trump brought up an anti-Biden lie about Ukraine that has been a mainstay of both the\u00a02020\u00a0and\u00a02024\u00a0presidential cycles, plus Trump\u2019s 2019 impeachment. Trump slammed Biden for supposedly \u201ctelling the Ukrainian people\u201d to \u201cchange the prosecutor, otherwise, you\u2019re not getting $1 billion,\u201d referring to Biden\u2019s efforts to remove Ukraine\u2019s top prosecutor in 2016. Trump also claimed the Ukrainian prosecutor\u2019s ouster was related to Biden\u2019s \u201cson,\u201d referencing Hunter Biden, who at the time was on the board for a prominent Ukrainian energy company. \u201cIf I ever said that, that\u2019s quid pro quo,\u201d Trump quipped. Facts First: Trump\u2019s claims are false.\u00a0 Since 2019, Trump and his Republican allies have falsely accused Biden of abusing his powers while serving as vice president to get a top Ukrainian prosecutor fired, supposedly because the prosecutor\u2019s probe into the Ukrainian energy giant Burisma Holdings threatened his son, Hunter Biden. This claim was never true and has been repeatedly debunked. Nonetheless, it is one of the most-cited talking points used by Republicans against Biden during any discussion about his ties to Ukraine. In reality, Biden\u2019s actions toward the prosecutor were consistent with bipartisan US policy, and was in lockstep with what America\u2019s European allies were pushing for at the time. They sought to remove the prosecutor because he wasn\u2019t doing enough to crack down on corruption in Ukraine \u2013 including at Burisma. The Obama administration, career US diplomats, US allies, the International Monetary Fund and Ukrainian anti-corruption activists, and even Senate Republicans, among others, all made clear that they were displeased with the performance of Viktor Shokin, who became Ukraine\u2019s prosecutor general in 2015. It is not clear how aggressively Shokin was investigating Burisma or its oligarch owner \u2013 or if there was even an active investigation \u2013 at the time that Joe Biden successfully pushed for Shokin\u2019s firing in 2016. During the 2020 presidential campaign, Senate Republicans led a probe to find evidence on whether Biden abused his position to help his family financially, but came up empty. As the 2024 campaign approached, House Republicans put these false claims at the center of their now-flatlined impeachment inquiry into Biden. From CNN\u2019s Marshall Cohen Trump on tariffs\u00a0 Trump claimed that his proposal to impose a 10% tariff on all goods coming into the US would not raise prices on Americans and instead cost other countries. \u201cIt\u2019s just going to cost countries that have been ripping us off for years, like China, and many others,\u201d Trump said. Facts First:\u00a0This is false.\u00a0Study\u00a0after\u00a0study\u00a0including\u00a0one from the federal government\u2019s bipartisan US International Trade Commission(USITC), have shown that American consumers and industries bear almost the entire cost of US tariffs, including those duties previously imposed by Trump. When the US puts a tariff on an imported good, the cost of the tariff comes directly out of the bank account of an American importer when the foreign-made product arrives at a US port. It\u2019s possible that some foreign manufacturers lowered their prices to stay competitive in the US market after Trump raised tariffs \u2013 but not enough to keep the cost paid by American importers the same as before. As of June 12, American importers have paid more than $240 billion for tariffs that Trump imposed \u2013 and Biden mostly left in place \u2013 on imported solar panels, steel, aluminum, and Chinese-made goods, according to\u00a0US Customs and Border Protection.\u00a0The USITC\u00a0found\u00a0that US importers, on average between 2018 and 2021, ended up paying nearly the full cost of the tariffs because import prices increased at the same rate as the tariffs. For each 1% increase in the tariff rate, the price paid by the American importer also went up 1%. Once an importing company pays the tariff, it can decide to eat the cost or pass all or some of it to the buyer of its goods \u2013 whether that\u2019s a retailer or a consumer. For example, American shoe seller Deer Stags, which imports most of its product line from China, decided to do a little bit of both. It was harder to get customers to pay more for existing styles that Deer Stags had carried for a long time, company president Rick Muskat\u00a0told CNN.So the company ended up eating the cost of the tariffs placed on some older styles and charging more for some new items. Economists\u00a0generally agree\u00a0that tariffs drive up prices . The\u00a0Peterson Institute for International Economics\u00a0recently estimated that Trump\u2019s proposed 10% across-the-board tariff, together with his proposal to impose a 60% tariff on all imports from China, would cost the typical middle-income household at least $1,700 a year. And\u00a0JP Morgan economists\u00a0estimated in 2019 that the tariffs Trump imposed on about $300 billion of Chinese-made goods would cost the average American household $1,000 a year. From CNN\u2019s Katie Lobosco\u00a0 Trump on his\u00a0criminal cases Trump repeated his frequent claims that Biden and his Justice Department were behind Trump\u2019s four indictments, including the Manhattan hush money case in which Trump was convicted on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records. \u201cHe indicted me because I was his opponent,\u201d Trump said of Biden. Of the Manhattan conviction, Trump said: \u201cThat was a case that was started and moved. They moved a high-ranking official at DOJ into the Manhattan DA\u2019s office to start that case.\u201d Facts First: There is no evidence supporting either of Trump\u2019s claims. Grand juries made up of ordinary citizens \u2013 in New York, Georgia, Florida and Washington, DC \u2013 approved the indictments in each of Trump\u2019s criminal cases. There is no basis for the claim that Biden ordered Trump to be criminally charged or face civil trials. There is also no evidence that Biden or the federal Justice Department had any role in launching or running Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg\u2019s prosecution \u2013 and Bragg, a Democrat, is a locally elected official who does not report to the federal government. The indictment in the case was approved by a grand jury of ordinary citizens. Trump\u2019s two federal indictments were brought by a special counsel, Jack Smith. Smith was appointed in November 2022 by Attorney General Merrick Garland, a Biden appointee, but that is not proof that Biden was involved in the prosecution effort, much less that Biden personally ordered the indictments. Garland has said that he would resign if Biden ever asked him to act\u00a0against Trump but that he was sure that would never happen. As he did during the debate, Trump has repeatedly invoked a lawyer on Bragg\u2019s team, Matthew Colangelo, while making claims about the Justice Department\u2019s involvement in the New York case. Colangelo left the Justice Department in 2022 to join the district attorney\u2019s office as senior counsel to Bragg. But there is no evidence that Biden had anything to do with Colangelo\u2019s employment decision. Colangelo and Bragg had been colleagues before Bragg was elected Manhattan district attorney in 2021. Before Colangelo worked at the Justice Department, he and Bragg worked at the same time in the office of New York\u2019s state attorney general, where Colangelo investigated Trump\u2019s charity and financial practices and was involved in bringing various lawsuits against the Trump administration. Trump on other countries doing business with Iran during his presidency\u00a0 Trump claimed that China, among other countries, \u201cpassed\u201d on doing business with Iran during his presidency after he vowed that the US would not do business with any country that does so. \u201cIran was broke. Anybody that did business with Iran, including China, they couldn\u2019t do business with the United States. They all passed,\u201d Trump said. Facts First: This is false. China\u2019s oil imports from Iran did briefly plummet under Trump in 2019, the year his administration made a concerted effort to deter such purchases, but they never stopped \u2013 and then they rose sharply again while Trump was still president. \u201cThe claim is untrue because Chinese crude imports from Iran haven\u2019t stopped at all,\u201d Matt Smith, lead oil analyst for the Americas at Kpler, a market intelligence firm, told CNN in November. China\u2019s official statistics recorded no purchases of Iranian crude in Trump\u2019s last partial month in office, January 2021, and none in most of Biden\u2019s first year in office. But that doesn\u2019t mean China\u2019s imports ceased; industry experts say it is widely known that China has used a variety of tactics to mask its continued imports from Iran. Smith said Iranian crude is often listed in Chinese data as being from Malaysia; ships may travel from Iran with their transponders switched off and then turn them on when they are near Malaysia, Smith said, or they may transfer the Iranian oil to other ships. Ali Vaez, Iran project director at the International Crisis Group, said in a November email: \u201cChina significantly reduced its imports from Iran from around 800,000 barrels per day in 2018 to 100,000 in late 2019. But by the time Trump left office, they were back to upwards to 600(000)-700,000 barrels.\u201d Vaez\u2019s comments were corroborated by Kpler data Smith provided to CNN. Kpler found that China imported about 511,000 barrels per day of Iranian crude in December 2020, Trump\u2019s last full month in office. The low point under Trump was March 2020, when global oil demand crashed because of Covid-19. Even then, China imported about 87,000 barrels per day, Kpler found. (Since data on Iranian oil exports is based on cargo tracking by various companies and groups, other entities may have different data.) From CNN\u2019s Daniel Dale and Kaanita Iyer\u00a0 Trump on the impact of immigration on Medicare and Social Security Trump said at least twice during the debate that Biden will destroy Social Security and Medicare by putting\u00a0migrants entering the US on\u00a0the benefits. \u201cThese millions and millions of people coming in, they\u2019re trying to put them on Social Security. He will wipe out Social Security. He will wipe out Medicare,\u201d Trump said. Facts First:\u00a0Trump is wrong. In fact, the opposite is true, particularly in the near term, multiple experts say. Many undocumented immigrants work, which means they pay much-needed payroll taxes, and this bolsters the Social Security and Medicare trust funds and extends their solvency. Immigrantswho are working legally typically won\u2019t collect benefits for many years. As for those who are undocumented, some are working under fake Social Security numbers, so they are paying payroll taxes but don\u2019t qualify to collect benefits. The Social Security Administration looked at the effects of unauthorized immigration on the Social Security trust funds. It found that in 2010, earnings by unauthorized workers contributed roughly $12 billion on net to the entitlement program\u2019s cash flow. The agency has not updated the analysis since, but this year\u2019s Social Security trustees report noted that increasing average annual total net immigration by 100,000 persons improves the entitlement program\u2019s solvency. \u201cWe estimate that future years will experience a continuation of this positive impact on the trust funds,\u201d said the report on unauthorized immigration. Meanwhile, unauthorized immigrants contributed more than $35 billion on net to Medicare\u2019s trust fund between 2000 and 2011, extending the life of the trust fund by a year, according to a study published in the Journal of General Internal Medicine. \u201cImmigrants tend to be younger and employed, which increases the number of workers paying into the system,\u201d said Gary Engelhardt, a Syracuse University economics professor. \u201cAlso, they have more children, which helps boost the future workforce that will pay payroll taxes.\u201d \u201cImmigrants are good for Social Security,\u201d he said. However, undocumented immigrants who gain legal status that includes eligibility for future Social Security and Medicare benefits could ultimately be a drain to the system, according to Jason Richwine, a resident scholar at the Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates for lower immigration. \u201cIllegal immigration unambiguously benefits the Social Security and Medicare trust funds, but amnesty (legalization) would reverse those gains and add extra costs,\u201d Richwine wrote in a report last year. From CNN\u2019s Tami Luhby Trump on the 2020 election\u00a0 Trump reiterated election lies, claiming that he didn\u2019t accept the results of the 2020 election because of voter fraud. \u201cI would\u2019ve much rather accepted these, but the fraud and everything else was ridiculous,\u201d Trump said. Facts First: Trump\u2019s election claims remain false. The 2020 election was not rigged or stolen, Trump lost fair and square to Biden by an Electoral College margin of 306 to 232, his opponents did not cheat, and there is no evidence of any fraud even close to widespread enough to have changed the outcome in any state. From CNN\u2019s Daniel Dale and Kaanita Iyer\u00a0 Trump on his own comments after 2017 Charlottesville march\u00a0 Biden denounced Trump for\u00a0saying\u00a0in August 2017 that \u201cvery fine people\u201d were among the participants in a hateful \u201cUnite the Right\u201d event days prior in Charlottesville, Virginia. The event was organized by White nationalists after the city decided to remove a statue of Confederate general Robert E. Lee from a park. The participants included neo-Nazis,\u00a0one of whom murdered a counter-protester, and prominent public racists. But Trump claimed that Biden\u2019s recall of his remark was \u201cmade up\u201d and a \u201cnonsense story.\u201d Facts First:\u00a0Trump\u2019s claim that Biden\u2019s description of his comments is a \u201cnonsense story\u201d is itself false. Biden fairly characterized Trump\u2019s comments about the events in Charlottesville. The claim that Trump\u2019s \u201cfine people\u201d comment is a \u201choax\u201d and \u201cnonsense story\u201d is based on the inaccurate premise that there were peaceful non-racists attending an\u00a0aggressively hateful marchthat was held in Charlottesville the night before the main daytime protest that featured\u00a0prominent White nationalists as advertised speakers. And supporters of the \u201choax\u201d claim have noted that, when Trump told reporters days later that \u201cyou also had people that were very fine people, on both sides,\u201d he had also said \u201cI\u2019m not talking about the neo-Nazis and the white nationalists, because they should be condemned totally\u201d \u2013 and had specified that he was talking about other unnamed people he claimed had been at the nighttime march \u201cprotesting very quietly the taking down of the statue of Robert E. Lee.\u201d But there has\u00a0never been evidence\u00a0that such a benign group was present at the march. The march \u2013 which\u00a0testimony\u00a0in a 2021 civil trial showed was organized by White nationalists \u2013 was a\u00a0bigoted gathering\u00a0at which participants\u00a0chanted Nazi and White nationalist slogans targeting Jews and others, and displayed Nazi symbols, while\u00a0carrying Tiki torches. CNN correspondent Elle Reeve, who has extensively reported on the Charlottesville gathering, noted that the torch march was organized quietly in White nationalist \u201calt-right\u201d online spaces and intended to be a surprise event that was known in advance only to a select group of like-minded people. So, it\u2019s not clear how people who were not supportive of White nationalism might have come to be part of the crowd or why such people would have remained there if they had somehow stumbled in. And Trump has never identified any non-racists who participated. From CNN\u2019s Daniel Dale and Chandelis Duster\u00a0 Trump on the United States\u2019 trade deficit with China\u00a0 Trump claimed that under Biden, \u201cWe have the largest deficit with China.\u201d Facts First: This is false. Even if you only count trade in goods and ignore the services trade \u2013 in which the US traditionally runs a surplus with China \u2013 the deficit with China fell to about $279 billion in 2023, the lowest since 2010.\u00a0 In 2018, under Trump, the goods deficit with China hit a new record of about $418 billion before falling back under $400 billion in subsequent years. From CNN\u2019s Katie Lobosco\u00a0 Trump on terror attacks during his administration In discussing the Middle East and Hamas\u2019 October 7 attack on Israel, Trump claimed that there was \u201cno terror at all during my administration.\u201d Facts First: Trump\u2019s claim is false, and it remains false even if he was referring specifically to attacks by Islamic extremists. There were various terrorist attacks during the Trump presidency. In fact, in his State of the Union address in 2018, Trump blamed immigration policies for \u201ctwo terrorist attacks in New York\u201d in \u201crecent weeks.\u201d\u00a0 Trump\u2019s own Justice Department alleged that a mass murder in New York City in 2017, which killed eight people and injured others, was a terrorist attack carried out in support of ISIS; Trump repeatedly lamented this attack during his presidency. Trump\u2019s Justice Department also alleged that a 2019 attack by an extremist member of Saudi Arabia\u2019s military, which killed three US servicemembers and injured others at a military base in Florida, \u201cwas motivated by jihadist ideology\u201d and was carried out by a longtime \u201cassociate\u201d of al Qaeda. In addition, there were a variety of other terrorist attacks during Trump\u2019s presidency. Notably, Trump\u2019s Justice Department said it was a \u201cdomestic terrorist attack\u201d when one of Trump\u2019s supporters mailed improvised explosive devices to CNN, prominent Democratic officials and other people in 2018. In 2019, a White supremacist pleaded guilty to multiple charges in New York, including first-degree murder in furtherance of an act of terrorism, for killing a Black man in March 2017 to try to start a race war. And Trump\u2019s Justice Department described a 2019 shooting massacre at a Walmart in Texas as an act of domestic terrorism; the gunman who killed 23 people was targeting Latinos. From CNN\u2019s Holmes Lybrand and Daniel Dale Trump on his tax cuts Trump once again claimed that the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was the biggest tax cut ever. \u201cI gave you the largest tax cut in history,\u201d Trump said. Facts First: Trump is wrong. Analyses have found that the act was not the largest in history either in percentage of gross domestic product or inflation-adjusted dollars. The act made numerous permanent and temporary changes to the tax code, including reducing both corporate and individual income tax rates. In a report released earlier this month, the Congressional Budget Office looked at the size of past tax cuts enacted between 1981 and 2023. It found that two other tax cut bills have been bigger \u2013 former President Ronald Reagan\u2019s 1981 package and legislation signed by former President Barack Obama that extended earlier tax cuts enacted during former President George W. Bush\u2019s administration. The CBO measured the sizes of tax cuts by looking at the revenue effects of the bills as a percentage of gross domestic product \u2013 in other words, how much federal revenue the bill cuts as a portion of the economy \u2013 over five years. Reagan\u2019s 1981 tax cut and Obama\u2019s 2012 tax cut extension were 3.5% and 1.7% of GDP, respectively. Trump\u2019s 2017 tax cut, by contrast, was estimated to be about 1% of GDP. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget found in 2017 that the framework for the tax cuts would be the fourth largest since 1940 in inflation-adjusted dollars and the eighth largest since 1918 as a percentage of gross domestic product. From CNN\u2019s Tami Luhby Trump on his own comments on January 6 In response to a question about his actions \u2013 and inaction \u2013 on January 6, 2021, while his supporters stormed the US Capitol, Trump defended the incendiary speech he delivered before the attack. \u201cI said, \u2018Peacefully and patriotically,\u2019\u201d Trump said. Facts First: This is highly misleading. He did say those words during his speech on the Ellipse on January 6, but he also told his supporters that they \u201cwouldn\u2019t have a country anymore\u201d if they didn\u2019t march to the US Capitol and \u201cfight like hell\u201d against a \u201crigged\u201d election. CNN has previously fact-checked this self-serving quotation from Trump about his January 6 speech. During his speech, Trump said, \u201cI know that everyone here will soon be marching over to the Capitol building to peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard.\u201d But on the debate stage Thursday night, Trump omitted the fact that later in his January 6 speech, he told his supporters to \u201cwalk down Pennsylvania Avenue\u201d to give GOP lawmakers the \u201cboldness that they need to take back our country.\u201d He also told the crowd at the Ellipse, \u201cIf you don\u2019t fight like hell, you\u2019re not going to have a country anymore\u201d and encouraged Republican lawmakers to stop fighting like a boxer \u201cwith his hands tied behind his back.\u201d Last year, a civil court in Colorado, and the Colorado Supreme Court, closely examined Trump\u2019s speech as part of a lawsuit that tried to disqualify him from office under the 14th Amendment\u2019s \u201cinsurrectionist ban.\u201d The Colorado trial judge concluded that \u201cwhile Trump\u2019s Ellipse speech did mention \u2018peaceful\u2019 conduct in his command to march to the Capitol, the overall tenor was that to save the democracy and the country the attendees needed to fight.\u201d From CNN\u2019s Marshall Cohen\u00a0\u00a0 Trump on abortion medication Trump claimed, \u201cThe Supreme Court just approved the abortion pill.\u201d Facts First: Trump\u2019s claim about the abortion drug is false. The Supreme Court did not rule on the merits of the case and approve mifepristone, one of the pills used in a medication abortion. It sent the case back to the lower courts for additional proceedings. The court earlier this month rejected a lawsuit that challenged the US Food and Drug Administration\u2019s approach to regulating mifepristone. The court did not \u201capprove\u201d the drug, as Trump claimed; instead it ruled that the doctors and the anti-abortion groups that had challenged access to the drug did not have the standing to sue. The reasoning of the court in this decision, scholars say, could encourage other mifepristone challenges in the future. Medication abortion is now the most common method of abortion in the United States, according to the Guttmacher Institute. Nearly two-thirds of all abortions in the formal US health care system \u2013 about 63% \u2013 were medication abortions in 2023. From CNN\u2019s Jen Christensen Trump on\u00a0Pelosi and January 6\u00a0 Trump once again tried to blame former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi for the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol, saying that the California Democrat had turned down his offer of 10,000 National Guard troops to protect the Capitol that day and had admitted this in video taken by her own daughter. \u201cNancy Pelosi, if you just watched the news from two days ago, on tape to her daughter, who is a documentary filmmaker \u2026 but she\u2019s saying, \u2018Oh, no, it\u2019s my responsibility, I was responsible for this,\u2019 because I offered her 10,000 soldiers, or National Guard, and she turned them down,\u201d Trump said. He added, \u201cAnd I offered it to her. And she now admits that she turned it down.\u201d Facts First: Trump\u2019s claims about Pelosi\u2019s role in Capitol security and in the deployment of the National Guard are false. The speaker of the House is not in charge of Capitol security; that is overseen by the Capitol Police Board, a body that includes the sergeants at arms of the House and the Senate. And the House speaker does not have power over the District of Columbia National Guard, which is under the command of the president. While there is no evidence Pelosi ever received a Trump offer of 10,000 soldiers on January 6, she would not even have had the power to turn down such an offer even if she had received one. Trump also overstated what Pelosi said in a video recorded by her filmmaker daughter Alexandra Pelosi on January 6 and later obtained by House Republicans, who posted a 42-second snippet on social media earlier this month. Pelosi was shown expressing frustration at the inadequate security at the Capitol, and she said at one point, \u201cI take responsibility for not having them just prepare for more.\u201d But the short video doesn\u2019t show her absolving Trump of responsibility or admitting she was the person in charge of Capitol security \u2013 and Pelosi continues to say it\u2019s not true she turned down an offer of National Guard troops.. After Trump began referring to this clip earlier in June, Pelosi spokesperson Aaron Bennett said in an email to CNN: \u201cNumerous independent fact-checkers have confirmed again and again that Speaker Pelosi did not plan her own assassination on January 6th. Cherry-picked, out-of-context clips do not change the fact that the Speaker of the House is not in charge of the security of the Capitol Complex \u2014 on January 6th or any other day of the week.\u201d In fact, another part of the video appears to undermine Trump\u2019s frequent claims that Pelosi was the person who turned down a National Guard presence in advance of January 6. She said, \u201cWhy weren\u2019t the National Guard there to begin with?\u201d The House select committee that investigated the attack on the Capitol found \u201cno evidence\u201d Trump gave any actual order for 10,000 Guard troops to anyone. Christopher Miller, Trump\u2019s acting defense secretary at the time of the attack on the Capitol, testified to the committee that Trump had, in a phone call on January 5, 2021, briefly and informally floated the idea of having 10,000 troops present on January 6 but did not issue any directive to that effect. Miller said, \u201cI interpreted it as a bit of presidential banter or President Trump banter that you all are familiar with, and in no way, shape, or form did I interpret that as an order or direction.\u201d From CNN\u2019s Daniel Dale Trump on migrants and crime Trump claimed that migrants were entering the United States and killing women, saying that \u201cthese killers are coming into our country, and they are raping and killing women.\u201d Facts First: This needs context. Preliminary statistics show that crime in the US dropped significantly in 2023 and in the first quarter of 2024, with a steep drop in murders and other violent offenses, even as the number of people crossing the southern border spiked. While some undocumented immigrants have been charged with high-profile crimes during the Biden presidency, some undocumented immigrants committed serious crimes under Trump and previous presidents as well. And research has generally found no connection between immigration levels and crime \u2013 and has sometimes found that undocumented immigrants commit crimes at lower rates than people born in the US.\u00a0 Charis Kubrin, co-author of the 2023 book \u201cImmigration and Crime: Taking Stock\u201d and professor of criminology, law and society at the University of California, Irvine, told CNN\u2019s Catherine Shoichet early this year: \u201cAcross a variety of studies that use different years of data that focus on different areas of the United States \u2014 with some exceptions, there\u2019s some nuance there. I don\u2019t want to deny the nuance \u2014 in general, on average, we do not find a connection between immigration and crime, as is so often claimed. The most common finding across all these different kinds of studies is that immigration to an area is either not associated with crime in that area or is negatively associated with crime in that area. Meaning more immigration equals less crime. It\u2019s rare to find studies that show crime following increases in immigration or with larger percentage of the population that are immigrants.\u201d Kubrin\u2019s co-author, Graham Ousey, professor of sociology and criminology at the College of William & Mary, added: \u201cA lot of people when you say that will then say, \u2018Oh, well, but what about undocumented immigration?\u2019 And there\u2019s less research on that topic. But that body of research is growing, and it pretty much reaches the same conclusion.\u201d From CNN\u2019s Priscilla Alvarez and Daniel Dale Trump on the US share of NATO funding During a dispute over who would do a better job countering Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine, Trump criticized the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and how it is funded by its members, claiming he had learned after taking office that \u201calmost 100% of the money was paid by us.\u201d Facts First: Trump\u2019s claim is false. Official NATO figures show that in 2016, the last year before Trump took office, US defense spending made up about 71% of total defense spending by NATO members \u2013 a large majority but not \u201calmost 100%.\u201d And Trump\u2019s claim is even more inaccurate if he was talking about the direct contributions to NATO that cover the alliance\u2019s organizational expenses and are set based on each country\u2019s national income; the US was responsible for about 22% of those contributions in 2016. The US share of total NATO military spending fell to about 65% in 2023. And the US is now responsible for about 16% of direct contributions to NATO, the same as Germany. Erwan Lagadec, an expert on NATO as a research professor at George Washington University\u2019s Elliott School of International Affairs and director of its Transatlantic Program, said the US share was reduced from 22% \u201cto placate Trump\u201d and is a \u201csweetheart deal\u201d given that the US makes up more than half of the alliance\u2019s total GDP. From CNN\u2019s Daniel Dale and Marshall Cohen\u00a0 Trump on the cost of food\u00a0 Trump claimed that Biden caused inflation and that it\u2019s \u201ckilling\u201d Americans, who \u201ccan\u2019t buy groceries anymore\u201d because the cost of food has \u201cdoubled and tripled and quadrupled.\u201d Facts First: Trump\u2019s claims of food prices doubling, tripling and quadrupling are not entirely factual and could use some context. Inflation\u2019s rapid ascent, which began in early 2021, was the result of a confluence of factors, including effects from the Covid-19 pandemic such as snarled supply chains and geopolitical fallout (specifically Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine) that triggered food and energy price shocks. Heightened consumer demand boosted in part by fiscal stimulus from both the Trump and Biden administrations also led to higher prices, as did the post-pandemic imbalance in the labor market. Inflation peaked at 9.1% in June 2022, hitting a 41-year high, and has slowed since (the Consumer Price Index was at 3.3% as of May 2024). However, it remains elevated from historical levels. Three-plus years of pervasive and prolonged inflation has weighed considerably on Americans, especially lower-income households trying to afford the necessities (food, shelter and transportation). Food prices, specifically grocery prices, did outpace overall inflation. However, they didn\u2019t rise to the extent that Trump claims. Annual food and grocery inflation peaked at 11.4% and 13.5% in August 2022, respectively. Through the 12 months ending in May, overall food and grocery prices were up just 2.1% and 1%, respectively. Certain food categories saw much greater inflation: Notably, egg prices were up 70% annually in January 2023. However, the underlying cause of that sharp increase was a highly contagious, deadly avian flu. Food prices are highly volatile and can be influenced by a variety of factors, including disease, extreme weather events, global supply and demand, geopolitical events, and once-in-a-lifetime pandemics. From CNN\u2019s Alicia Wallace Biden on taxing billionaires\u00a0 Biden claimed that there are a thousand billionaires in the country who are \u201cin a situation where they, in fact, pay 8.2% in taxes.\u201d Facts First: Biden used this figure in a way that was misleading. As in previous speeches, including the State of the Union address in March, Biden didn\u2019t explain that the figure is the product of an alternative calculation, from economists in his own administration, that factors in unrealized capital gains that are not treated as taxable income under federal law. There\u2019s nothing inherently wrong with the alternative calculation itself; the administration economists who came up with it explained it in detail on the White House website in 2021. Biden, however, has tended to cite the figure without any context about what it is and isn\u2019t, leaving open the impression that he was talking about what these billionaires pay under current law. So, what do billionaires actually pay under current law? The answer is not publicly known, but experts say it\u2019s clearly more than 8%. \u201cBiden\u2019s numbers are way too low,\u201d Howard Gleckman, senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center at the Urban Institute think tank, told CNN in 2023. Gleckman said that in 2019, University of California, Berkeley, economists Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman \u201cestimated the top 400 households paid an average effective tax rate of about 23% in 2018. They got a lot of attention at the time because that rate was lower than the average rate of 24% for the bottom half of the income distribution. But it still was way more than 2 or 3,\u201d numbers Biden has used in some previous speeches, \u201cor even 8%.\u201d In February 2024, Gleckman provided additional calculations from the Tax Policy Center. The center found that the top 0.1% of households paid an average effective federal tax rate of about 30.3% in 2020, including an average income tax rate of 24.3%. From CNN\u2019s Daniel Dale\u00a0 Biden on unemployment when he took office In defending his record on the economy, Biden said that when he took office, \u201cthe economy was flat on its back. Fifteen percent unemployment. (Trump) decimated the economy. \u2026 That\u2019s why there was not inflation at the time. There were no jobs.\u201d Facts First: Biden\u2019s claim that the US unemployment rate was 15% when he took office is incorrect.\u00a0\u00a0 In January 2021, the unemployment rate was 6.4%, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data. The unemployment rate did near 15%\u00a0during Trump\u2019s presidency, but that occurred during April 2020, when the global and national economy were crushed by the emerging Covid-19 pandemic. In April 2020, the US lost more than 20 million jobs, resulting in unemployment skyrocketing from 4.4% in March 2020 to 14.8% in April 2020. After peaking in April 2020, the unemployment rate declined substantially as the nation recovered those lost jobs (reaching pre-pandemic levels in June 2022) and gained millions more. The nation\u2019s jobless rate is in the midst of a 30-month streak of being at or below 4%. From CNN\u2019s Alicia Wallace\u00a0 Trump on Biden\u2019s tax plans\u00a0 Trump claimed that Biden is proposing to multiply Americans\u2019 taxes by four times. \u201cHe wants to raise everybody\u2019s taxes by four times,\u201d Trump said. Facts First: This is false, just as it was when Trump made the same claim during the 2020 election campaign and in early 2024. Biden has not proposed to quadruple Americans\u2019 taxes, and there has never been any indication that he is seeking to do so. The nonpartisan Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center think tank, which analyzed Biden\u2019s never-implemented budget proposals for fiscal 2024, found this: \u201cHis plan would raise average after-tax incomes for low-income households in 2024, leave them effectively unchanged for middle-income households, and lower after-tax incomes significantly for the highest-income taxpayers.\u201d The Tax Policy Center found that Biden\u2019s proposal would, on average, have raised taxes by about $2,300 \u2013 but that\u2019s about a 2.3% decline in after-tax income, not the massive reduction Trump is suggesting Biden wants. And critically, Tax Policy Center senior fellow Howard Gleckman noted to CNN in May that 95% of the tax hike would have been covered by the highest-income 5% of households. The very biggest burden under the Biden plan would have been carried by the very richest households; the Tax Policy Center found that households in the top 0.1% would have seen their after-tax incomes decline by more than 20%. That\u2019s \u201ca lot,\u201d Gleckman noted, but it\u2019s still nowhere near the quadrupling Trump claims Biden is looking for. And again, even this increase would have been only for a tiny subset of the population. Biden has promised not to raise taxes by even a cent for anyone making under $400,000 per year. From CNN\u2019s Daniel Dale\u00a0 Trump on funding for Ukraine\u00a0 Trump claimed that the US has given more in aid to Ukraine than European countries put together. \u201cThe European nations together have spent $100 billion, or maybe more than that, less than us,\u201d Trump said. Facts First: Trump\u2019s claim is false. From just before Russia\u2019s invasion in early 2022 through April 2024, European countries contributed more aid to Ukraine than the US, according to data from the Kiel Institute for the World Economy in Germany. The Kiel Institute, which closely tracks aid to Ukraine, found that from late January 2022 (the month prior to Russia\u2019s invasion) through April 2024, the European Union and individual European countries had committed a total of about $190 billion to Ukraine in military, financial and humanitarian assistance, compared with about $106 billion committed by the US. Europe also exceeded the US in aid that had been \u201callocated\u201d to Ukraine \u2013 defined by the institute as aid either delivered or specified for delivery \u2013 at about $109 billion for Europe compared with about $79 billion for the US. Additionally, Europe had committed more total military aid to Ukraine, at about $76 billion to about $69 billion for the US. The US narrowly led on military aid that had been allocated, at more than $50 billion for the US to less than $48 billion for Europe, but even that was nowhere near the lopsided margin Trump suggested. It\u2019s important to note that it\u2019s possible to come up with different totals using different methodology. And the Kiel Institute found that Ukraine itself was getting only about half of the money in a 2024 US bill that had widely been described as a $61 billion aid bill for Ukraine; the institute said the rest of the funds were mostly going to the Defense Department. From CNN\u2019s Daniel Dale and Kaanita Iyer Trump on the Veterans Choice program\u00a0\u00a0 Trump took credit for the passage of the Veterans Choice health care law, referring to \u201cChoice, that I got through Congress.\u201d Facts First:\u00a0Trump\u2019s claim is false. The Veterans Choice program was actually signed into law in 2014 by his predecessor, President Barack Obama. Trump signed a law in 2018, the VA MISSION Act, that expanded and modified the program established under Obama, and, as Trump has said, made the initiative permanent. During Trump\u2019s presidency, he falsely took credit for the Choice law more than 150 times. From CNN\u2019s Daniel Dale\u00a0 Trump on lowering the cost of insulin Trump again tried to take full credit for lowering the cost of insulin for older Americans. \u201cI\u2019m the one that got the insulin down for the seniors,\u201d Trump said. Facts First: Trump\u2019s claim that he was the one who reduced the cost of insulin for seniors is exaggerated. The former president did get a $35-per-month out-of-pocket cap on insulin for some seniors through a voluntary program that Medicare prescription drug plans could choose to participate in. But Biden ensured that all 3.4 million-plus insulin users on Medicare got $35-per-month insulin \u2014 through a mandatory cap that not only covers more people than Trump\u2019s voluntary cap, but also applies to a greater number of insulin products and stays in effect at a level of individual drug spending at which Trump\u2019s cap disappeared. Trump could fairly say he played a role in lowering insulin costs and that Biden does not deserve sole credit. The Biden-era federal government has acknowledged that his mandatory $35 monthly cap, signed into law in his Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, \u201cclosely aligns with\u201d the voluntary $35 monthly cap in the Trump-created model that was announced in 2020 and launched in the final month of the Trump presidency in 2021. But Biden\u2019s policy does more than Trump\u2019s did in several substantive ways. The Inflation Reduction Act measure applies the $35-per-month cap to every insulin user in Medicare Part D. Trump\u2019s policy didn\u2019t. Biden\u2019s policy imposes the mandatory $35 monthly cap on insulin taken via a pump, which is obtained through Medicare Part B. Under Trump\u2019s program, the voluntary $35 monthly cap only applied to insulin obtained via Medicare Part D drug plans, such as insulin that is injected or inhaled. The Inflation Reduction Act measure requires a $35 cap on all covered insulin products. Trump\u2019s policy only required it on some. Under Biden\u2019s policy, people in Medicare Part D no longer have to make any payments for covered prescription drugs, including insulin, once they reach a very high level of annual drug spending known as the \u201ccatastrophic\u201d level. Under Trump\u2019s voluntary insulin program, the $35 monthly cap didn\u2019t apply to those whose spending reached the \u201ccatastrophic\u201d threshold, though many people likely paid less than $35 per month for insulin at that point regardless. From CNN\u2019s Daniel Dale and Tami Luhby\u00a0 Trump on funding HBCUs Trump made a claim during the debate that he \u201cfunded\u201d historically Black colleges and universities. \u201cWhen they see what I did for criminal justice reform and for the historically Black colleges and universities where I funded them and got them all funded,\u201d Trump said. Facts First: Trump is exaggerating here and his claims need context. In 2019, Trump signed the FUTURE Act (Fostering Undergraduate Talent by Unlocking Resources for Education), a bipartisan bill aimed at strengthening HBCUs as well as other minority-serving institutions by providing $255 million annually. \u201cHBCUs have been underfunded for over 150 years, since inception. President Trump did sign measures into law that helped HBCUs tremendously (FUTURE Act and the first two COVID 19 packages). However, he never set out to do it,\u201d Monique LeNoir, vice president of branding, marketing and communications for the United Negro College Fund (UNCF), told CNN. \u201cCongress took the lead on putting the HBCU funding in those bills and passing them. The third COVID-19 bill, passed under President Biden, included as much funding for HBCUs as both of the first two COVID-19 bills under President Trump.\u201d Marybeth Gasman, executive director of the Rutgers Center for Minority Serving Institutions, echoed LeNoir, adding that Congress, during former President Barack Obama\u2019s administration, also allocated funding to HBCUs. \u201cHBCUs are strong and resilient institutions, and they are that way because of Black people, Black leaders, Black alumni, Black students. They face obstacles but continue to persevere. They were not at risk of being out of operation \u2014 that\u2019s a big overstatement,\u201d Gasman told CNN. The Trump administration also had a frayed relationship with HBCUs, and Trump\u2019s views on funding for HBCUs have also not been consistent. In 2017, Trump questioned the constitutional basis for federal funding for HBCUs, saying, according to NPR, that \u201cit benefits schools on the basis of race.\u201d CNN\u2019s Chandelis Duster and Owen Dahlkamp This article has been updated with additional information.

{"id": "2024_06_28_politics_us-disconnecting-gaza-pier", "text": "The US is once again dismantling the troubled humanitarian pier to Gaza because of anticipated heavy seas and bad weather, two US officials said, marking the third time it will halt operations since it began working six weeks ago. The pier\u00a0was constructed to bring much needed aid to civilians suffering as the Israel-Hamas war continues, especially as land crossings frequently closed. It\u00a0will be towed back to the Ashdod port in southern Israel on Friday until conditions are calmer. It\u2019s unclear how long the pier will be disconnected, the officials said. \u201cAs always, the safety of our service members is a top priority, and temporarily relocating the pier will prevent potential structural damage that could be caused by the heightened sea state,\u201d\u00a0deputy Pentagon\u00a0press\u00a0secretary Sabrina Singh said Friday. The latest setback comes two days after\u00a0GOP\u00a0Rep. Mike Rogers, chair of the House Armed Services Committee, sent a letter to senior Biden administration officials in which he said the temporary pier \u201chas been riddled with setbacks, sidelined more often than operational, and can only be classified as a gross waste of taxpayer dollars.\u201d Earlier this month,\u00a0GOP\u00a0Sen. Roger Wicker, ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee,was even more blunt. \u201cThis needs to end immediately,\u201d he said in a statement. And on Thursday, the Pentagon and USAID Inspectors General announced they were launching coordinated reviews of the humanitarian mission and pier. This is the second time the pier has been disconnected intentionally as a precautionary measure to avoid damage in bad weather. One week\u00a0after\u00a0the pier began operations in May, it was damaged in heavy seas, forcing the military to tow it to Ashdod for repairs. Since the $230 million pier was first anchored in May, it has delivered 8,831 metric tons, more than 19.4 million pounds, of humanitarian aid, according to one other officials. That aid, however, has begun piling up on the beach as the World Food Programme has suspended distribution as it reviews the security situation on the ground in Gaza. CNN previously reported more than 6,000 pallets of aid are currently awaiting distribution on the beach. Singh said during a news conference on Friday that the marshalling yard where that aid is being held is \u201cpretty close to full \u2026 in terms of how much aid is there.\u201d She also said USAID has been \u201chaving ongoing conversations\u201d with the WFP over its pause in operations. \u201cWe want to see distribution pick back up. We want to see aid delivered to the people that need it most. We certainly know and understand and are monitoring the dire humanitarian situation on the ground,\u201d she said. CNN\u00a0previously reported\u00a0that conversation about setting up a maritime corridor to bring aid into Gaza began near the end of October, following Hamas\u2019 attack and the resulting offensive by Israeli forces in Gaza. The White House began exploring options\u00a0including\u00a0the feasibility of the temporary pier, which was deemed too risky at the time due to the weather conditions at that time of year and ongoing IDF operations. The idea was revisited in January and February as the need for humanitarian aid in Gaza became more dire. The pier was officially announced in March by President Joe Biden, who said in his State of the Union address that he was directing the military to build a temporary pier off the coast of Gaza. Within days, US Army watercraft had departed the US.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/28/politics/us-disconnecting-gaza-pier/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/30/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_28_politics_joe-biden-debate-performance-panic", "text": "President Joe Biden\u2019s debate performance has set off alarm bells among top Democrats, leaving some to openly question whether Biden can stay atop of the Democratic ticket. \u201cHe seemed a little disoriented. He did get stronger as the debate went on. But by that time, I think the panic had set in,\u201d longtime Democratic operative and CNN senior political commentator David Axelrod said. Axelrod also gave voice to a conversation happening among many Democrats on Thursday night: \u201cThere are going to be discussions about whether he should continue.\u201d After a rocky start to the night,\u00a0campaign and party officials pointed to Biden\u2019s rebuke to former President Donald Trump on the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol as a moment where the president hit his stride.\u00a0They also noted Biden\u2019s climate change comments and the exchange over Trump\u2019s reported derogatory terms for veterans as high points and argued the president improved as the night went on. Vice President Kamala Harris conceded that the president got off to a \u201cslow start.\u201d \u201cWhat we saw tonight is the president making a very clear contrast with Donald Trump on all the issues that matter to the American people. Yes, there was a slow start, but it was a strong finish. And what became very clear through the course of the night is that Joe Biden is fighting on behalf of the American people \u2013 on substance, on policy, on performance,\u201d Harris said in an interview with CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper. Pressed by Cooper on Biden\u2019s performance, Harris offered a defense of her boss. \u201cPeople can debate on style points, but ultimately this election and who is the president of the United States has to be about substance. And the contrast is clear,\u201d she said, pointing to his broader record in office. \u201cIt was a slow start. That\u2019s obvious to everyone. I\u2019m not going to debate that point,\u201d Harris said. Biden has fielded persistent questions about his age since he decided to make a third run at the White House in 2019. At 81, he is the oldest president in history, and would be 86 at the end of a potential second term. Thursday\u2019s presidential debate on CNN offered a key test for the president to exhibit vigor and energy \u2013 and Democratic sources reacting to the debate described emotions ranging from concern to straight-up panic about Biden\u2019s biggest vulnerability. From the start of the debate, the president appeared to struggle with his voice. Biden cleared his throat or coughed multiple times, a condition that his doctor has previously stated is caused by acid reflux. He has also been battling a cold in recent days, multiple sources told CNN. Biden often defaulted to an open-mouthed, staring look while Trump was speaking. He occasionally struggled to finish his thoughts or land punches at points, ceding ground on issues like abortion where Democrats have an edge. Biden brushed off concerns about his debate performance, telling reporters that he thought he performed well while visiting patrons at a Waffle House after the debate. \u201cI think we did well,\u201d Biden said. When asked about calls for him to drop out and if he had any concerns about his debate performance, Biden attacked former president Donald Trump. \u201cNo, it\u2019s hard to debate a liar,\u201d Biden said, adding that he has a sore throat. Thursday\u2019s debate took place before both Biden and Trump are formally nominated at their respective party conventions. The Democratic National Convention convenes August 19 in Chicago. No serious Democratic challengers have stepped up to run against Biden, and at this point in the campaign, Biden would have to decide to step aside if Democrats were to pick another nominee. If Biden did withdraw, the Democratic nomination would be decided on the floor. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to argue that Biden should be our nominee,\u201d said an operative who\u2019s worked on campaigns at all levels for over a decade. Democrats were even opining on who it might be instead: \u201cIf I was Gavin (Newsom) or Gretchen (Whitmer), I\u2019d be making calls tonight,\u201d one said. After the debate, Newsom dismissed calls for Biden to be removed from the Democratic ticket. \u201cI will never turn my back on President Biden. Never turn my back on President Biden, I don\u2019t know a Democrat in my party that would do so,\u201d he said when asked about a rumbling of Democrats\u00a0possibly\u00a0open to replacing Biden as the party\u2019s nominee. \u201cDisaster,\u201d one lawmaker told CNN. \u201cTrump is coming off as reasonable even if he\u2019s lying 60 miles per hour. Biden is unintelligible.\u201d And one Democrat who\u2019s worked on campaigns up and down the ballot said simply: \u201cWe are f**ked.\u201d Former Biden White House communications director and 2020 deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield, also a CNN political commentator, described Thursday\u2019s showdown as an \u201catypically bad performance\u201d for Biden. \u201cHis biggest issue that he had to prove to the American people was that he had the energy and the stamina. And he didn\u2019t do that,\u201d Bedingfield said, though she described the performance as one bad night with a lot of campaigning left to go. Other Democrats offered reaction on the style of Biden\u2019s delivery. \u201cBiden looks and sounds terrible. He\u2019s incoherent,\u201d said one Democrat who spent time working in the Biden administration. \u201cHorrific,\u201d said another Democratic operative. Democratic lawmakers watching the debate expressed alarm that the president was not more forceful against Trump\u2019s mistruths, nor clear enough about his own vision and what he\u2019s done for the country. One Democratic congressman in attendance at a watch party on Capitol Hill with other members told CNN that the moment near the beginning of the debate when Biden was talking about the national debt and appeared to lose his train of thought and pause for several seconds before offering a confusing answer was incredibly tough. The room, the member said, went silent in shock \u2013 and the lawmaker\u2019s own initial reaction was that he wanted to jump off a bridge. Asked to characterize the watch party\u2019s reviews, the member said he and his colleagues have generally felt like Trump appeared young and Biden old; and that Trump was playing mostly offense, while Biden was playing mostly defense. \u201cHe and Jill need to hear what folks are saying\u201d after the debate, \u201crather than deny them,\u201d one senior Democrat said. Democrats are especially worried that Trump came across as more measured than usual while Biden was not \u201cpunching back\u201d on Trump\u2019s lies. \u201cI think Joe is doing better than he did in the first 15 minutes, and Trump is just lying his way through the debate. But I wish Joe was a lot stronger punching back,\u201d one lawmaker said midway through the debate. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t great. But that\u2019s why you do this in June. One thousand things will happen between now and Election Day,\u201d another senior Democrat said. Democratic Party officials questioned why Biden missed other opportunities to slam Trump\u2019s comments, particularly on the issue of abortion. Another Democratic lawmaker summed up the evening in a text: \u201cStrong on substance, but agonizing presentation.\u201d Biden advisers were hopeful ahead of the debate that many Americans would watch and see much more than the short clips of Biden on social media that paint him as feeble and weak. There is now a serious concern that that moment where he appeared to lose his train of thought will now be precisely one of those clips that goes viral.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/28/politics/joe-biden-debate-performance-panic/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/30/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_28_politics_iowa-supreme-court-abortion-ban", "text": "The Iowa Supreme Court ruled Friday to uphold the state\u2019s abortion ban, which prohibits most abortions in the state as early as six weeks into pregnancy. The ruling\u00a0will dramatically restrict\u00a0abortions in Iowa, where women were able to seek the procedure for up to 22 weeks as legal challenges played out against the six-week\u00a0ban. The ban\u00a0will prohibit\u00a0physicians from providing most\u00a0abortions after early cardiac activity can be detected in a fetus or embryo, commonly as early as six weeks into pregnancy, before many women know they are pregnant.\u00a0It includes\u00a0exceptions for miscarriages, when the life of the pregnant woman is threatened and fetal abnormalities that would result in the infant\u2019s death. Exceptions will also be made for pregnancies resulting from rapes reported within 45 days and incest reported within 140 days. The case is part of the larger political fallout around the issue of abortion since the\u00a0US\u00a0Supreme Court\u00a0overturned federal abortion rights\u00a0in June 2022. The high court ruling allowed abortion rights to be determined by state governments.\u00a0Several bans\u00a0were quickly met with challenges from abortion rights groups, and many are still being litigated, including in Utah, Ohio and Wyoming.\u00a0And on Thursday, the\u00a0Supreme Court blocked the enforcement\u00a0of Idaho\u2019s strict abortion law. Iowa Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds celebrated the ruling Friday, saying she is glad the state\u2019s high court \u201cupheld the will of the people.\u201d \u201cAs the heartbeat bill finally becomes law, we are deeply committed to supporting women in planning for motherhood, and promoting fatherhood and its importance in parenting,\u201d Reynolds said in a statement, vowing to protect in vitro fertilization, which has become another flashpoint in the post-Roe abortion landscape. Reproductive rights group mourned Friday\u2019s ruling, including the regional chapter of Planned Parenthood \u2014 one of the petitioners in the case \u2014 which called the decision \u201cmanufactured chaos and confusion\u201d with health impacts that \u201care going to be around for generations to come.\u201d \u201cIowans\u2019 freedom to control their body and their futures has been destroyed,\u201d Ruth Richardson, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood North Central, said during a Facebook Live session following the ruling. \u201cPoliticians and the courts have successfully flexed their newfound power with the overturning of Roe to take away bodily autonomy.\u201d The Emma Goldman Clinic, another petitioner in the case, warned that the ruling will have wide-ranging impacts. \u201cThis law will have a ripple effect beyond Iowa, as abortion clients throughout the Midwest will be displaced and forced to travel greater distances and wait longer in order to obtain abortion care,\u201d the clinic said in a Facebook post. The Iowa ban was passed in July 2023 during a special legislative session called solely\u00a0to pass abortion restrictions, after the state Supreme Court declined to lift a block on a similar 2018 bill. The 2023 ban immediately faced challenges from the local Planned Parenthood and American Civil Liberties Union chapters, along with other reproductive rights advocates. A state district court temporarily blocked the measure three days after it went into effect. Attorneys for the state argued in a brief that Iowa\u2019s constitution \u201cdoes not recognize a fundamental right to an abortion\u201d and as a result, the abortion ban doesn\u2019t \u201cimplicate a fundamental right.\u201d Thus, they claimed that the court must only establish whether the legislation has a \u201crational basis.\u201d Reproductive rights advocates said that a law that restricts abortions as early as six weeks into pregnancy will prevent most Iowans from accessing an abortion as many people do not know they are pregnant at that point. Even if some women determine they are pregnant before six weeks, they will face \u201csubstantial logistical and financial obstacles in arranging to have an abortion in Iowa before their time runs out,\u201d attorneys for Planned Parenthood and the ACLU local chapter argued in a brief. With the ruling, Iowa joins nearly two dozen states that have banned or limited access to abortion. Florida, Georgia and South Carolina have similar six-week restrictions in place.

{"id": "2024_06_20_politics_colin-allred-border-texas-senate-race", "text": "Democratic Rep. Colin Allred of Texas, who\u2019s challenging GOP Sen. Ted Cruz in the Republican-leaning state this fall, is promising to \u201cfix the border\u201d in a new ad, declaring that he \u201cstood up to Joe Biden on the border.\u201d But just two years ago, the congressman dismissed the issue as one playing out in the \u201cright-wing echo chamber,\u201d despite a sharp increase of migrants at the US-Mexico border at the time. Allred, a former NFL player and civil rights attorney who represents the northeast Dallas area, made his comments in February 2022 as the US was seeing a surge in migrants at the border compared with during the Trump administration \u2013 and even compared with the previous year under Biden, which smashed past records of encounters at the border. Asked about Republicans running on the border \u2013 along with crime, inflation and \u201cwokeism\u201d in the 2022 midterms \u2013 Allred said he thought most voters were focused on inflation and the economy. \u201cI think some of those others may fall into, kind of, the right-wing echo chamber,\u201d Allred told CBS News\u2019 Major Garrett on \u201cThe Takeout\u201d podcast. \u201cI don\u2019t hear a lot about the border here in Dallas, and I\u2019m in a border state. Obviously, we want to have comprehensive immigration reform. We want to try and, you know, address some of these things,\u201d Allred said. \u201cBut it\u2019s not \u2013 I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a top-of-mind issue,\u201d he added, going on to say that he believed voters were still frustrated about Covid-19. In February 2022, US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) recorded 166,010 encounters with migrants at the US-Mexico border, reflecting a significant increase from the 101,099 encounters in the same month the previous year \u2013 a rise of 64%. That surge was part of a larger trend in 2022, which saw a then-record 2.4 million migrant encounters \u2013 a huge increase compared with during the Trump administration, which saw its highest annual total enforcement actions in fiscal year 2019 with 1.15 million. By comparison, fiscal year 2021, which covered part of Biden\u2019s first year in office, saw 1.95 million total enforcement actions. Though Allred dismissed the political importance of the border at the time, a University of Texas/Texas Tribune poll from June 2021 found that 34% of Texas voters identified immigration and border security, combined, as the biggest concerns for the state (each at 17%) \u2013 ahead of Covid at just 5%. Today, border issues are an even greater concern for Texas voters. A University of Texas/Texas Politics Project poll in April found a significant majority of Texas voters described migrants crossing the US-Mexico border as a crisis (48%) or a very serious problem but not a crisis (23%). In his race to unseat Cruz, Allred is now spending at least $380,000 running an online ad exclusively dedicated to the border issue. Allred did not publicly announce the ad, as he has done for previous ads. \u201cI\u2019m Colin Allred. Fentanyl is flooding into our country. Our border is broken, and so are our politics. To fix it, we have to go after the cartels and fix the border,\u201d Allred says in the ad. \u201cBut we\u2019ve got to do it in a way that upholds our values. Values passed down from my grandfather \u2013 a customs officer in Brownsville. I stood up to Joe Biden on the border and to extremists like Ted Cruz, who prefer chaos to real solutions. I\u2019m Colin Allred. I\u2019m running for Senate to fix this problem.\u201d The ad is running online, where Google ad transparency data shows that Allred has spent at least $280,000 promoting two versions of the spot that run 30 and 15 seconds \u2013 and have been shown more than 11 million times. On Facebook, Allred has spent more than $100,000 running the ad. In a statement to CNN, Allred campaign spokesperson Josh Stewart said: \u201cSince his first days in Congress, Congressman Allred has focused on bipartisan solutions to fix our broken immigration system and secure our border. During his 12 years in the Senate, Ted Cruz has shown that he only wants to play politics with the crisis at the border and that he will never be part of a bipartisan solution.\u201d A shift on the border Allred \u2013 who was first elected to Congress in 2018 by flipping a GOP-held seat in the Dallas suburbs \u2013 has sought to toughen many of his stances on the border and immigration enforcement ahead of the statewide election in November. He joined a Democratic-led border security task force this spring and said he supported the border security bill introduced earlier this year that was killed by\u00a0Republicans. That bill did not contain provisions for any undocumented immigrants, including a pathway to citizenship, which Allred has long pushed for, but he called it \u201ca much-needed step\u201d on immigration reform. Allred has also shifted his rhetoric on a border wall popularized by Trump. At a January 2018 town hall, when he was running to unseat GOP Rep. Pete Sessions, Allred pledged to personally tear down the wall if it was enacted instead of creating a pathway to citizenship for the undocumented. \u201cThis idea that we\u2019re going to trade this for a racist wall. Absolutely not. If they build that wall, I will be there tearing it down,\u201d he said. He would repeatedly refer to the border wall as \u201cracist\u201d and \u201cwasteful, ineffective\u201d and a \u201cfailed policy\u201d that was not needed over the next few years, though he said in 2019 that physical barriers were \u201csometimes appropriate.\u201d Years later, in October 2023, after the Biden administration announced construction of new sections of the wall at the US-Mexico border, using funds already allocated during the Trump administration, Allred praised the decision. \u201cThis is a necessary step to help Texas\u2019 overwhelmed border communities deal with this current surge of migrants,\u201d he told The Hill, adding that it was \u201conly a partial solution.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/20/politics/colin-allred-border-texas-senate-race/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/30/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_28_politics_chevron-precedent-supreme-court", "text": "The Supreme Court on Friday significantly weakened the power of federal agencies to approve regulations in a major decision that could have sweeping implications for the environment, public health and the workplace. The 6-3 ruling, overturning a precedent from 1984, will shift the balance of power between the executive and judicial branches and hands an important victory to conservatives who have sought for years to rein in the regulatory authority of the \u201cadministrative state.\u201d The lawsuits were filed by two groups of herring fishermen challenging a Commerce Department regulation requiring them to pay the salaries of government observers who board their vessels to monitor the catch. But the decision will net a far wider swath of federal regulations affecting many facets of American life. The decision overturns the Chevron v. Natural Resources Defense Council precedent that required courts to give deference to federal agencies when creating regulations based on an ambiguous law. Congress routinely enacts open-ended laws that give latitude to agencies to work out \u2014 and adjust \u2014 the details to new circumstances. \u201cChevron is overruled,\u201d Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in his majority opinion. \u201cCourts must exercise their independent judgment in deciding whether an agency has acted within its statutory authority.\u201d Justice Neil Gorsuch, the son of a former Environmental Protection Agency administrator, wrote separately to call Chevron Deference \u201ca grave anomaly when viewed against the sweep of historic judicial practice.\u201d The 1984 decision, he said,\u00a0\u201cundermines core rule-of-law values ranging from the promise of fair notice to the promise of a fair hearing,\u201d adding that it \u201coperated to undermine rather than advance reliance interests, often to the detriment of ordinary Americans.\u201d Liberals say ruling is \u2018judicial hubris\u2019 Justice Elena Kagan, writing a dissent joined by the court\u2019s two other liberals said that, with the overturning of Chevron, \u201ca rule of judicial humility gives way to a rule of judicial hubris.\u201d \u201cIn one fell swoop, the majority today gives itself exclusive power over every open issue \u2014 no matter how expertise-driven or policy-laden \u2014 involving the meaning of regulatory law. As if it did not have enough on its plate, the majority turns itself into the country\u2019s administrative czar,\u201d Kagan wrote. The majority, she added, \u201cdisdains restraint, and grasps for power.\u201d White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre described the outcome as \u201cyet another deeply troubling decision that takes our country backwards.\u201d Jean-Pierre said that \u201cRepublican-backed special interests have repeatedly turned to the Supreme Court\u201d and that \u201conce again, the Supreme Court has decided in the favor of special interests.\u201d Conservatives have long sought to rein in regulatory authority, arguing that Washington has too much control over American industry and individual lives. The justices have been incrementally diminishing federal power for years, but the new case gave the court an opportunity to take a much broader stride. In the case of the fishermen who brought the case, the law allowed the government to mandate the observers but was silent on the question of who had to pay their salaries, which the fisherman argue added roughly $700 a day to their costs. They encouraged the court to rule that agencies couldn\u2019t enact such a requirement without explicit approval from Congress. The Supreme Court had been trending in that direction for years, knocking back attempts by\u202ffederal agencies in other contexts to approve regulations on their own. In 2021, for instance, the court\u2019s conservatives struck down a Biden administration effort to extend an eviction moratorium first approved during the Trump administration. Last year, the court\u2019s conservatives similarly invalidated a Biden plan to wipe out student loans of millions of Americans.

{"id": "2024_06_28_politics_homeless-grants-pass-oregon-supreme-court", "text": "The Supreme Court ruled Friday in favor of an Oregon city that ticketed homeless people for sleeping outside, rejecting arguments that such \u201canti-camping\u201d ordinances violate the Constitution\u2019s ban on \u201ccruel and unusual\u201d punishment. Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote the opinion for the 6-3 conservative majority, with the three liberal justices dissenting. The case centered on \u201canti-camping\u201d ordinances in Grants Pass, Oregon, that were challenged by several residents experiencing homelessness. It had been watched closely by city and state officials who are uncertain how to respond to a surge in homelessness and encampments that have cropped up under bridges and in city parks across the nation. It\u2019s also being followed by people who live in those encampments and are alarmed by efforts to criminalize the population rather than build shelters and affordable housing. \u201cThe Constitution\u2019s Eighth Amendment serves many important functions, but it does not authorize federal judges to wrest those rights and responsibilities from the American people and in their place dictate this Nation\u2019s homelessness policy,\u201d Gorsuch wrote in his majority opinion. Gorsuch wrote that \u201cHomelessness is complex\u201d and that \u201cits causes are many.\u201d \u201cPeople will disagree over which policy responses are best; they may experiment with one set of approaches only to find later another set works better; they may find certain responses more appropriate for some communities than others,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBut in our democracy, that is their right. Nor can a handful of federal judges begin to \u2018match\u2019 the collective wisdom the American people possess in deciding \u2018how best to handle\u2019 a pressing social question like homelessness.\u201d Justice Sonia Sotomayor said in a dissent joined by the court\u2019s two other liberals that the ruling punishes people for being homeless. \u201cSleep is a biological necessity, not a crime,\u201d Sotomayor wrote. \u201cFor some people, sleeping outside is their only option.\u201d The city, she said, \u201cpunishes them for being homeless. That is unconscionable and unconstitutional.\u201d In a move that underscored her discontent with the court\u2019s ruling, Sotomayor took the rare step of reading her dissent from the bench on Friday. The ordinances barred people from sleeping in public with \u201cbedding,\u201d which can include sleeping bags or bundled-up clothing. Each violation of the ordinances carried a $295 fine, which increased to more than $500 if not paid. After two tickets, police could order a person to avoid a park for 30 days. Anyone who violated that order could have been sentenced to 30 days in jail. A federal appeals court ruled against the city, holding that Grants Pass could not \u201cenforce its anticamping ordinances against homeless persons for the mere act of sleeping outside with rudimentary protection from the elements, or for sleeping in their car at night, when there was no other place in the city for them to go.\u201d Grants Pass argued that the Eighth Amendment\u2019s prohibition on \u201ccruel and unusual\u201d punishment was aimed at torture or hard labor sentences, not tickets.\u00a0An attorney for the city told the justices that the appeals court ruling \u201ctied cities\u2019 hands by constitutionalizing the policy debate over how to address growing encampments.\u201d \u201cThese are low-level fines and very short jail terms for repeat offenders that are in effect in many other jurisdictions,\u201d the attorney, Theane Evangelis, said during the April 22 oral arguments. \u201cThis is not unusual in any way. It is certainly not cruel.\u201d During oral arguments, several of the justices appeared concerned about the prospect of criminalizing homelessness but they also worried about limiting a city\u2019s ability to regulate public health or fire hazards in homeless encampments across the country. \u201cSleeping is a biological necessity. It\u2019s sort of like breathing,\u201d Justice Elena Kagan, a member of the court\u2019s liberal wing, said at one point. \u201cYou can say breathing is conduct, too, but presumably you would not think that it\u2019s OK to criminalize breathing in public. And for a homeless person who has no place to go, sleeping in public is kind of like breathing in public.\u201d On any given night, more than 650,000 people in the United States are experiencing homelessness, according to the US Department of Housing and Urban Development. That number increased 12% from 2022 to 2023. In reaction to the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling, housing rights groups came out in full force to condemn the decision. \u201cArresting or fining people for trying to survive is expensive,\u00a0counterproductive, and\u00a0cruel,\u201d said\u00a0Jesse Rabinowitz, communications\u00a0director at the National Homelessness Law Center, echoing the dissenting justices who decried the majority\u2019s ruling as violating the 8th Amendment. The National Alliance to End Homelessness said it is worried the ruling may shift the burden of the homelessness crisis to law enforcement, a tactic they say \u201chas consistently failed to reduce homelessness in the past, and it will assuredly fail to reduce homelessness in the future.\u201d Gavin Newsom \u2013 a Democratic governor who has focused on reducing homelessness in his state of California \u2013 did not denounce the decision. Instead, he said that the ruling \u201cremoves the legal ambiguities that have tied the hands of local officials for years,\u201d adding that the ambiguity has long limited local officials\u2019 options for clearing encampments. And Jay Cheng, executive director of Neighbors for a Better San Francisco, also sees this ruling as an avenue to progress on the housing crisis facing his city by clearing \u201clarge dangerous tent encampments and offering homeless individuals shelter and services.\u201d This story has been updated with additional details.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/28/politics/homeless-grants-pass-oregon-supreme-court/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/30/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_29_politics_supreme-court-dissents-sotomayor-kagan-jackson", "text": "As the conservative Supreme Court majority has won case after case in recent days, liberal dissenters\u00a0are having\u00a0their moment in the courtroom. Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson each took\u00a0the rare step of reading provocative dissenting statements this past week.\u00a0The ritual from the elevated mahogany bench offered a bit of drama before rapt courtroom spectators and a chance to draw public attention to their views. In\u00a0the face of the conservative dominance, it was the best they could do. After Justice Neil Gorsuch on Friday announced the\u00a06-3 decision letting an Oregon city ticket homeless people\u00a0for sleeping outside,\u00a0Sotomayor spoke up. \u201cSleep is a biological necessity, not a crime,\u201d she said, reading from notes before her. Observing that the city of Grants Pass arrests and fines people for sleeping in public, even if there\u2019s no available shelter bed, Sotomayor said the law \u201cpunishes them for being homeless.\u201d Gorsuch, who sits at Sotomayor\u2019s immediate right on the bench, kept his head turned toward\u00a0her, listening impassively. Other justices stared out at spectators or down at notes, perhaps anticipating the next opinions, and dissents, to be revealed. Protracted, bluntly worded dissents from the bench \u2013 a singular practice taken at the end of an annual court session when the toughest cases come down \u2013 are mainly wielded these days by the liberals. They have been more loudly trumpeting their differences with the right-wing majority, whether in the courtroom or confined to the page. Oral dissents add no legal weight to what\u2019s written in a dissenting opinion. Still, they give the generally cloistered justices a way to amplify gripes with the majority \u2013 notwithstanding the sedate setting of the courtroom. Following the decision on homeless encampments Friday, Chief Justice John Roberts announced a decision\u00a0significantly curtailing the power of federal regulators\u00a0and enhancing the authority of judges, again by a 6-3 vote. That prompted dissenting Kagan to denounce the \u201cmassive shock\u201d to today\u2019s complex federal system that regulates air and water pollution, keeps drugs safe, and protects consumer and investor interests. The court majority reversed a 1984 milestone that required judges to defer to\u00a0reasonable\u00a0agency interpretations of their congressional mandates. That case,\u00a0which Congress, executive branch agencies and the judiciary followed for 40 years, reflected the widespread understanding that\u00a0statutes\u00a0are often ambiguous and that agencies, with their expertise, were best suited to interpret them. Her\u00a0oral dissent lasted nearly 15 minutes, about five minutes longer than Roberts\u2019 rendition of the majority opinion. As she spoke, Roberts gazed downward. The targets of oral dissents seldom react or subtly reveal any sentiment. They\u2019ve won. Kagan\u2019s zingers extended to her written opinion.\u00a0\u201cIn one fell swoop, the majority today gives itself exclusive power over every open issue \u2013 no matter how expertise-driven or policy-laden,\u201d Kagan wrote, adding, \u201cIf opinions had titles, a good candidate for today\u2019s would be Hubris Squared.\u201d The majority\u2019s reversal of the 1984 Chevron v. Natural Resources Defense Council marked the third time in three years that conservatives had reversed\u00a0foundational, decades-old\u00a0precedent. Last year, it overturned a 1978 case allowing racial affirmative action in college admissions. In 2022, it threw out\u00a0the\u00a01973\u00a0Roe v. Wade\u00a0decision giving women the constitutional right to end a pregnancy. \u2018Tough luck\u2019 Bench announcements occur in the courtroom, without cameras or audio access. They begin with the author of the majority opinion delivering the facts of the case, law involved, and the resolution. This is usually a straightforward exercise, although some justices, notably Roberts and Kagan, tend to incorporate some suspense and occasional levity. An oral dissent is necessarily more impassioned. In Friday\u2019s homelessness dispute, the Gorsuch majority ruled that enforcement of bans on camping on public property against homeless people do not violate the 8th\u00a0Amendment\u2019s prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment. Gorsuch said the dilemma of homelessness is a complex matter for policymakers and elected officials, not judges. \u201cAt bottom,\u201d he wrote in his opinion, \u201cthe question this case presents is whether the Eighth Amendment grants federal judges primary responsibility for assessing those causes and devising the responses. It does not.\u201d His\u00a0courtroom tone was as calm and steady as Sotomayor\u2019s was emphatic. Sotomayor\u00a0closed by referring to the Supreme Court\u2019s obligation to safeguard constitutional rights for all Americans, rich and poor, \u201cespecially when doing so is uncomfortable or unpopular.\u201d The day before, Sotomayor had also read an\u00a0oral dissent \u00a0to protest a decision by the six-justice conservative majority that curtailed the power of the Securities and Exchange Commission to enforce fraud regulations. The ruling eliminated the ability of the SEC and other agencies to resolve claims with internal administrative hearings, rather than go to federal court. The message from the court to agencies losing a crucial enforcement tool, Sotomayor asserted in the courtroom: \u201cTough luck. Get a new statute from Congress.\u201d The newest justice joins in There was a time when conservative dissenters were heard more frequently in the white marble setting, up until recent years as the controlling right-wing supermajority coalesced. Justice Antonin Scalia, who served\u00a0from 1986 until his death in\u00a02016, took advantage of the practice with his theatrical flair and confrontational style. Now, oral dissents have become the exclusive tool of the left wing, even in cases when some conservatives lose, too. On Thursday, Jackson, the court\u2019s newest justice and its first African American woman, condemned the majority\u2019s dismissal of an Idaho abortion dispute.\u00a0The majority had engineered\u00a0a cross-ideological\u00a0and\u00a0politically expedient compromise,\u00a0ending\u00a0the case\u00a0for the time being. Jackson said the court should have been able to resolve the conflict over reproductive care that began in Idaho but is emerging in other states that banned abortion after the justices reversed the constitutional right. From her freshman seat at the far end of the bench, Jackson said the court had\u00a0a chance to bring clarity and certainty to a tragic situation but had \u201csquandered it.\u201d The disputed Idaho abortion ban allowed an exception only to prevent the pregnant woman\u2019s death, in conflict with a 1986 federal law requiring hospitals to provide treatment to \u201cstabilize\u201d needy patients. The US Justice Department argued that Idaho women suffering serious complications from a pregnancy and requiring an abortion to preserve their health should be covered by that law, the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA). The case had seemed destined for some sort of compromise in this fractious election year. Conservative Justice Amy Coney Barrett, along with Jackson, Sotomayor and Kagan, appeared more concerned about access to emergency reproductive care than their five male colleagues during oral arguments. In their private deliberations, the justices may have remained initially divided along those gender lines, or possibly along the familiar conservative-liberal divide. Whatever the rift, Barrett, Roberts and other justices bridged the gap. The majority said the case had been \u201cimprovidently granted\u201d and sent it back to lower courts for further proceedings. Jackson, along with three dissenters on the far-right, suggested their colleagues had engaged in a fiction regarding disputed facts to insist on dismissal. (Justice Samuel Alito, joined by Justices Clarence Thomas and Gorsuch, wrote that, \u201cThis about-face is baffling.\u201d Alito noted that the court majority had let the state\u2019s abortion ban take effect, indicating under the justices\u2019 usual standards that Idaho had a \u201cstrong\u201d likelihood of success in its dispute with the Biden administration.) But only Jackson declared her dissent from the bench. She closed her remarks, as well as her written opinion, by chiding her colleagues for putting off the case. She said pregnant patients in Idaho and elsewhere would pay the price for their inaction. \u201cWe owe them,\u201d she said, \u201can answer.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/29/politics/supreme-court-dissents-sotomayor-kagan-jackson/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/30/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_24_politics_fact-check-trump-george-washington-slaves", "text": "Former President Donald Trump delivered another litany of false claims during two speeches on Saturday. And he expressed an opinion on American history that is clearly contradicted by the facts. During a speech to the Faith\u00a0and\u00a0Freedom\u00a0Coalition, a conservative Christian group,\u00a0Trump criticized proposals to change the names of schools, military facilities and other places that honor slaveowners and Confederate leaders. (Under President Joe Biden, the Army has renamed nine installations\u00a0that had been named for Confederate generals.) And Trump said, \u201cHow about George Washington high school? \u2018We want the name removed from that high school.\u2019 They don\u2019t know why. You know, they thought he had slaves. Actually I think he probably didn\u2019t.\u2019\u201d Facts First: Washington owned slaves. This is an extensively documented fact. At the time of Washington\u2019s death in 1799, there were 317 enslaved people at Mount Vernon, his home and plantation in Virginia, including 123 people owned by Washington himself.\u00a0 \u201cGeorge Washington owned slaves. We know this by his own hand. He kept ledgers on everyone he enslaved,\u201d said Alexis Coe, a senior fellow at the think tank New America and author of \u201cYou Never Forget Your First: A Biography of George Washington.\u201d Coe said it is \u201creprehensible, on a personal level, to deny such a thing\u201d and also \u201cdangerous to our country\u201d to have a leading presidential candidate espousing such inaccurate views on US history. The website for Mount Vernon, which is now maintained as a historic place, says\u00a0that the number of slaves at the property \u201cgrew steadily\u201d over Washington\u2019s time there from 1754 to 1799. Washington inherited 10 slaves from his father at age 11. The Mount Vernon website notes that \u201cas a young man, Washington purchased dozens of enslaved people from estate sales and in private transactions\u201d \u2013 and that the first US president also rented slaves from others, inherited them from siblings, and enslaved the children who were born to slaves at Mount Vernon. When he married his wife Martha, the website notes, he also gained control of \u201ca large number\u201d of enslaved people from the estate of her first husband. The\u00a0list\u00a0of\u00a0317 enslaved people at Mount Vernon at the time of his death included 41 people rented from other plantations and 153 people from Martha\u2019s first husband\u2019s estate. Washington privately struggled\u00a0with the idea of slavery and, in the last two decades of his life, expressed private support for the idea of abolishing slavery by legislation. But when he died, he immediately freed just one person in his will, his longtime manservant, and decreed that the other slaves he owned would be freed upon the death of his wife Martha. She ended up signing a deed to free all of his remaining slaves the year after his death, but she kept the slaves she had inherited herself. Trump made many other false claims Here are just some of the other false claims Trump made in the speech to the Christian conservative group or in his rally speech Saturday night\u00a0in Philadelphia: - Trump claimed Democrats rigged the 2020 presidential election, his usual debunked lie. - Trump claimed \u201cevery legal scholar\u201d wanted Roe v. Wade overturned and the power to set abortion policy returned to individual states, which is not true. - Trump claimed \u201cjust about all the Democrats\u201d also wanted Roe overturned and abortion policy set by states, though Democrats overwhelmingly supported the preservation of Roe. - Trump claimed \u201cthere are states that allow\u201d the execution of babies after birth, though that is illegal in every state.  - Trump claimed that the US has record inflation, though the current inflation rate, 3.3% in May, is nowhere near the US record (23.7% in 1920) or even the 40-year high (9.1%) that was hit in June 2022. - Trump claimed the price of bacon has increased 100% or more under Biden, though the Biden-era increase is actually about 17% as of May. - Trump claimed Biden was the person who indicted him in the New York criminal case in which he was convicted on 34 felony counts, though a grand jury of ordinary citizens indicted him and the prosecution was led by a local district attorney who does not report to the federal government. - Trump claimed the global prison population is \u201cway down\u201d under Biden because foreign leaders are emptying their detention facilities to send people to the US as migrants. But the global prison population is actually up since 2021, and there is no proof of Trump\u2019s repeated claim about foreign leaders\u2019 actions. - Trump claimed crime in Venezuela is down 72%, though the limited available numbers show a much smaller decline of about 26%. - Trump claimed crime in the US is \u201cso much up,\u201d though preliminary statistics show US crime dropped significantly in 2023 and again in the first quarter of 2024. - Trump claimed he has been indicted more than notorious gangster Al Capone, though Capone was actually indicted more than Trump. - Trump claimed China paid the entire cost of his tariffs on imported Chinese goods and that \u201cthe American people didn\u2019t pay for it at all,\u201d though study\u00a0after\u00a0study has found that Americans paid the overwhelming majority of the cost of the tariffs. - Trump claimed the Biden administration is trying to require Army tanks to be all-electric, though the military\u2019s move toward electric vehicles does not include tanks. - Trump told a story in which he claimed someone told him that non-electric trucks do not have to stop when driving from New York to Los Angeles, though they do.\u00a0", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/24/politics/fact-check-trump-george-washington-slaves/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/30/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_28_politics_bob-menendez-corruption-trial-prosecution", "text": "Federal prosecutors rested their case\u00a0Friday\u00a0in the corruption trial of Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez of New Jersey\u00a0after seven weeks of testimony from\u00a0at least 30 witnesses. The prosecutors spent weeks untangling the multiple corruption schemes that they say resulted in the senator and his wife, Nadine Menendez, garnishing gold bars, nearly half a million dollars in cash, a Mercedes-Benz and thousands of dollars in mortgage payments. Bob Menendez faces a collection of bribery-related charges and counts of acting as a foreign agent for the Egyptian government and acting to benefit the Qatari government. He\u2019s on trial alongside New Jersey businessmen Wael Hana and Fred Daibes, who are charged for their alleged roles in the purported quid pro quo arrangements with the senator. Nadine Menendez, who was also charged in the indictment, is expected to be tried separately later this summer. All four defendants have pleaded not guilty. Bob Menendez\u2019s attorneys have consistently suggested in cross-examinations that the senator was not aware of deals his wife struck with their co-defendants, which included offering the senator\u2019s influence for a price. Prosecutors allege that Nadine Menendez was an intermediary for communications between the co-conspirators and her willing husband. The government\u00a0structured its case by chapters, calling witnesses to testify about separate schemes allegedly brokered by the senator in tandem with his wife. According to evidence presented by prosecutors in court, the schemes were brokered with Hana, Daibes and another co-conspirator, Jose Uribe, who struck a plea deal ahead of the trial. On his way out of Manhattan federal court Friday, Menendez told reporters that the government \u201chasn\u2019t proven its case.\u201d His lawyers will begin presenting his case when the trial resumes Monday at 9:30 a.m. ET. The lawyers have indicated that his defense should take no more than two or three days. The senator\u2019s older sister, Nadine Menendez\u2019s sister and a forensic accounting expert are expected to be the first few witnesses in the senator\u2019s defense. It is unclear if the senator, Daibes or Hana will testify in their own defense. The trial was first estimated to take about six weeks but is now expected to continue through mid-July. Here\u2019s a summary of the past seven weeks of testimony in the prosecution\u2019s case: A luxury car for prosecution interference Uribe, a co-defendant turned cooperating witness, testified that he bribed Bob Menendez in exchange for his influence to attempt to sway top prosecutors in New Jersey from pursuing criminal cases against his associates. Uribe testified about the conspiracy and how he paid for Nadine Menendez\u2019s luxury car. Gurbir Grewal, a former New Jersey attorney general, testified that Bob Menendez called him and then met with him in the senator\u2019s Newark office in 2019 over concerns Menendez had about a case, though he never mentioned any defendants by name.\u00a0Grewal testified that the senator never asked him to interfere in any specific case but a colleague of the attorney general who was at the meeting called the interaction \u201cgross.\u201d Gold, cash and mortgage payments for doing the Egyptian government\u2019s bidding Federal prosecutors have alleged that Bob Menendez helped Hana secure a halal certification monopoly with the Egyptian government\u00a0in exchange for giving Nadine Menendez gold bars, cash and paying her mortgage. Ted McKinney, a former top official at the US Department of Agriculture, testified that the senator told him in a call to stop interfering with his constituents after McKinney flagged concerns over the monopoly. The jury also heard about the close relationship the senator and his wife developed with Egyptian intelligence officials, who were introduced by Hana. Jurors saw text messages between Nadine Menendez and Egyptian officials and surveillance photos and video of the Menendezes\u00a0at an alleged conspiratorial dinner with Hana and a top Egyptian general at Morton\u2019s The Steakhouse in Washington, DC, in May 2019. Prosecutors say Bob Menendez pushed Egypt\u2019s agenda for years in the Senate \u2013 where he previously served as the top Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee \u2013 and signed off on millions in military funding in exchange for bribes from Hana. Sarah Arkin, a senior Senate Foreign Relations staff member under Menendez, said the senator\u2019s moves toward Egypt were unusual at times. Arkin testified that while Menendez had historically been publicly critical of the Egyptian government\u2019s human rights record, he told her in 2019 that he wanted to ease up on tough public statements, saying it wasn\u2019t working. \u201cI want to try to engage privately and engage more specifically and do more quiet engagement and criticism on a lot of these,\u201d Arkin quoted the senator as saying. Gold and cash for prosecution interference and Qatari government connections Prosecutors allege that Daibes used the senator\u2019s connections to secure a multimillion-dollar commercial real estate deal with a Qatari investment firm tied to members of the Qatari royal family. The jury saw messages between the senator and Qatari contacts, facilitating an introduction with Daibes. The senator also penned complimentary press releases about the Qatari government, which\u00a0he instructed Daibes to flag to the Qatari investors to curry favor, records shown at trial revealed. Fingerprints belonging to the senator and Daibes were found on cash-filled envelopes that were among the items seized from Nadine Menendez\u2019s home, where the senator also lived, during an FBI raid.\u00a0Serial numbers on gold bars also seized at the home during that raid revealed that Daibes had once possessed the gold, according to trial evidence. Meanwhile, other text messages shown by prosecutors at the trial illustrated a timeline of how the senator pushed the nomination of Philip Sellinger, the current US attorney for the District of New Jersey. Sellinger testified that Menendez had hoped the US attorney contender would look at a criminal case against Daibes \u201ccarefully\u201d if he secured the position. But Sellinger also said he never felt pressured to tip the scales for Daibes. Prosecutors from Sellinger\u2019s office ultimately offered Daibes a plea deal in April 2022 and the parties agreed Daibes would plead guilty to one felony charge and serve no jail time for the 2018 multi-count indictment tied to alleged loan fraud. A federal judge eventually rejected the deal last October days after Daibes and Menendez were indicted in the current case.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/28/politics/bob-menendez-corruption-trial-prosecution/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/30/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_28_politics_supreme-court-limits-obstruction-charges-against-january-6-rioters", "text": "The Supreme Court on Friday ruled that the Justice Department overstepped by charging hundreds of people who rioted at the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, with obstruction in a decision that could force prosecutors to reopen some of those cases. At the same time, the high court ruled that the charge could be filed against the rioters if prosecutors are able to demonstrate they were attempting not just to push their way into the building but rather to stop the arrival of certificates used to count electoral votes and certify the results of the election. The high court\u2019s decision means that special counsel Jack Smith is likely to continue to pursue the same charge against former President Donald Trump. Chief Justice John Roberts wrote the opinion for a 6-3 majority that included mostly conservatives and one liberal, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson. Justice Amy Coney Barrett filed a dissenting opinion that was joined by Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan. Roberts barely mentioned the attack on the US Capitol that precipitated the charges, focusing heavily on a detailed discussion of the text of the law. Roberts noted that the breach \u201cof the Capitol caused members of Congress to evacuate the chambers and delayed the certification process.\u201d Roberts argued that if Congress intended for prosecutors to be able to tack 20-year prison sentences onto the kind of conduct witnessed on January 6, 2021, lawmakers would have said so. \u201cNothing in the text or statutory history suggests that (the law) is designed to impose up to 20 years\u2019 imprisonment on essentially all defendants who commit obstruction of justice in any way and who might be subject to lesser penalties under more specific obstruction statutes,\u201d Roberts wrote. Special counsel Jack Smith has alleged Trump\u2019s obstruction of the congressional proceeding is much more sweeping than the rioters\u2019 actions, dating back to a scheme that began on Election Day and involved the use of bogus electoral certificates sent in from states around the country. Still, Trump\u2019s legal team is likely to attempt to use Friday\u2019s Supreme Court opinion to challenge parts of the case, if and when it returns to the trial-level judge. The special counsel contemplated the possibility that the Supreme Court would narrow the obstruction charge this way and said in court filings submitted in Trump\u2019s immunity case before the high court that his use of the charge would still survive under such a ruling. Smith pointed specifically to the indictment\u2019s allegations about the fake electors scheme. The Supreme Court\u2019s opinion released on Friday did not address the fake electors scheme specifically. But the majority opinion by Roberts nodded to the possibility that the obstruction statute would be violated \u201cby creating false evidence \u2014 rather than altering incriminating evidence.\u201d \u201cToday\u2019s ruling will have consequences for many of the January 6 prosecutions, but probably not for the charges against former President Trump,\u201d said Steve Vladeck, CNN Supreme Court analyst and professor at the University of Texas School of Law. \u201cUnlike the defendant in the case before the court, the charges against Trump relate specifically to trying to alter the evidence \u2014 the electoral votes \u2014 that Congress was considering in the January 6 joint session. So whereas at least some defendants will likely get re-sentencing (or even new trials), Trump\u2019s case can go forward \u2014 assuming the court holds on Monday that he isn\u2019t entirely immune,\u201d Vladeck said. Approximately 249 cases involving the obstruction charge at the center of Friday\u2019s ruling are pending, according to federal prosecutors. About 52 people were convicted and sentenced with the obstruction charge as their only felony. Of those, 27 people are currently incarcerated, according to prosecutors.

{"id": "2024_06_29_politics_democratic-donors-biden-debate-election", "text": "Less than 48 hours after President Joe Biden\u2019s alarming debate performance, the Democratic donor class is in crisis, racked by anxiety over what \u2014 if anything \u2014 the party\u2019s wealthiest backers can do to reinvigorate or replace Biden, whose campaign has commissioned new polling to assess the damage. The vast universe of wealthy Biden backers and their political whisperers has split along three lines. One faction is arguing that a pressure campaign urging the president \u2014 who has been adamant he will not step aside \u2014 to drop out would be a self-defeating nonstarter. Another is calling for a middle-of-the road approach, saying party leaders should consider drastic steps only after the fallout from Thursday night is more closely examined. Democratic fundraiser and strategist Dmitri Mehlhorn, who often works closely with LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, another prominent donor, told CNN that while the first 10 or 15 minutes of the debate \u201cwas very upsetting to see,\u201d\u00a0Biden\u2019s performance later in Atlanta and then at a high-energy rally on Friday in North Carolina had begun to settle his nerves. In any event, he reasoned, Biden alone controlled his fate as the Democratic nominee. \u201cThe smartest thing is to think through how you (as influential outsiders) operate, assuming no change,\u201d Mehlhorn said. \u201cAnd if there\u2019s no change, if Biden wants to remain president, then any kind of a pressure campaign is just a waste of time and energy and effort and money.\u201d A third group of donors and advisers, with fewer direct ties to Biden world and less influence within it, is proactively calling on Democrats to quit wasting time and immediately begin the process of seeking out a new nominee with a little more than four months before a general election clash with former President Donald Trump. The would-be favorites to step in for Biden, should he reverse course and leave the race, have been careful to pledge their support to the president and, as California Gov. Gavin Newsom has done, get out-front defending him. \u201cAll this other talk \u2026 it\u2019s unhelpful and unnecessary. We aren\u2019t going to turn our backs because of one performance,\u201d Newsom said in an email to supporters on Friday. \u201cWhat kind of party does that?\u201d As the Biden campaign conducts extensive research in battleground states about the president\u2019s standing, other leading Democrats have been less inclined to circle the wagons \u2014 instead warning that the party is doomed to defeat if it does not act decisively to change the equation. Former Iowa Sen. Tom Harkin, who served alongside Biden in the Senate for decades, sought to set the tone in a pointed letter he dashed off to friends after the debate. \u201cAll incumbent Democratic Senators should write to Biden asking him to release his delegates and step aside so the convention can choose a new candidate,\u201d Harkin wrote in the letter, a copy of which was obtained by CNN. \u201cA couple of Governors may need to do the same.\u201d Harkin said there was still time for a course correction and a new Democratic ticket, which he believes \u201cwould energize the party at all levels and capture the general public\u2019s attention \u2014 many of whom would like an alternative to Trump.\u201d \u201cThis is a perilous time and is more important than Joe Biden\u2019s ego,\u201d Harkin wrote, \u201cor desire to stay president.\u201d There does seem to be agreement among all sides over one thing: Ultimately, the decision will be Biden\u2019s to make. There is no appetite for a clash at the Democratic National Convention this summer in Chicago \u2014 partly because there is no clear apparatus for pushing Biden aside, but mostly due to concerns that a floor fight, no matter the outcome, would do more harm than good. \u201cThe party is in President Biden\u2019s hands \u2014 for better or worse,\u201d a Democratic senator told CNN, speaking on condition of anonymity to avoid disrespecting the president or alienating the campaign. \u201cHe deserves our respect and space to reach any decision.\u201d The absence of an heir apparent to Biden who could satisfy the party\u2019s perpetually warring factions while quickly bringing together competing donor networks is another significant hurdle for those pushing for immediate action. \u201cA true succession plan does not exist,\u201d a senior Democratic adviser to the Biden campaign told CNN on Saturday. \u201cThat\u2019s what makes all of this not just heartbreaking, but very problematic.\u201d Democrats are conducting new polls and research, throughout the weekend and into early next week, in an effort to gain a better understanding of the political fallout, particularly in key contests that will determine whether the party can win back its House majority and maintain its narrow control of the Senate. A second longtime adviser said the only way Biden would even consider stepping aside \u2014 a move that is still very much an open question \u2014 is if he was presented serious data showing that he would not only likely lose his reelection bid, but also endanger down-ballot candidates in House, Senate and competitive local races across the country. The Biden campaign has long had polling that found Democrats would still support those candidates even if they didn\u2019t vote for Biden. If the president\u2019s debate setback would make some of these voters far less inclined to vote at all \u2014 handing a turnout advantage to Trump and Republicans \u2014 Biden could be confronted with a starker decision. Without that information, for now, the most prominent national Democrats, led by former President Barack Obama, are asking party donors to keep the faith. For years, the relationship between Obama and Biden and their circle of advisers was strained by Obama\u2019s decision to support Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential bid in 2015 and urge Biden not to run. This moment \u201cis even more fraught,\u201d one longtime Obama adviser said Saturday, noting that Biden would have to ultimately reach \u201cany decision about his next steps on his own.\u201d At a fundraiser for House Democrats on New York City\u2019s Upper West Side late Friday, Obama did not take questions from donors in the audience as he spoke with House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries in what Florida Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, who was in attendance, told CNN was more like a \u201cfireside chat.\u201d The former president, as he did in a social media post earlier in the day, recounted to attendees his own dismal debate experience from 2012, repeated a message about the stark contrast between the two presidential candidates and said Biden\u2019s values \u201creflect the best in America.\u201d Asked about the debate by Jeffries, Obama pivoted to a more expansive view of the situation. \u201cAn appropriate message for\u00a0this evening\u00a0is that this is a team sport. The president is captain, and we need the White House, because of the enormous power of the executive branch,\u201d Obama said. \u201cBut the critical need for us to regain the House and have Hakeem Jeffries as speaker should be sufficient motivation. And if we do our jobs on that front, that is probably the most important thing we can do for the Biden reelection campaign as well.\u201d But signs \u2014 literally \u2014 of dissent have been more prominent outside the fundraising circuit. When Biden arrived at hedge fund manager Barry Goldstein\u2019s event in East Hampton, New York, on Saturday, his motorcade passed a group of people holding signs appealing for the president to drop out. \u201cWe love you,\u201d one said, \u201cbut it\u2019s time.\u201d Once inside, Biden acknowledged the angst among the donors. \u201cI understand the concern about the debate \u2014 I get it,\u201d the president said. \u201cI didn\u2019t have a great night.\u201d But he also pushed back against the some of the concerns voiced in recent reports. \u201cVoters had a different reaction,\u201d Biden said, claiming that post-debate polling showed little movement except for some figures that \u201cmoved us up, actually.\u201d Goldstein told CNN more than 200 people were expected at the event, which brought in additional donations the Friday morning after the debate. Actors Sarah Jessica Parker and Matthew Broderick were among the hosts, and former Trump communications director Anthony Scaramucci was also on hand. As he made his swing through the Hamptons, Biden was accompanied by Jeffrey Katzenberg, the Hollywood mogul serving as a co-chair of his campaign.\u00a0Biden\u2019s team has tried to point to some fundraising bright spots in the days after the debate, saying the campaign brought in more than $27 million during a two-day period. Biden will be in New Jersey on Saturday night for another fundraiser, this one hosted by wealthy New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy, a former Democratic National Committee finance chair. Those gatherings follow the mixed reviews that emerged from a Friday night event in New York City attended by Biden and headlined by rock \u2018n\u2019 roll legend Elton John. \u201cThe vibe in the room was completely bizarre,\u201d said a Democratic strategist who attended the event. \u201cYou\u2019re having fun and the drinks are flowing, and Elton John was there \u2014 but you\u2019re waiting for the gaffe, you\u2019re waiting for the slip \u2014 magnified by the terror of the night before.\u201d Another donor in the room, Charles Myers, told CNN the panicky narrative around a donor exodus from Biden\u2019s campaign was \u201cfrustrating\u201d and \u201cnot what\u2019s happening.\u201d \u201cYes, donors were nervous after the very bad debate performance,\u201d Myers said, \u201cbut still very much on board and some want to do more.\u201d The gathering in the East Village, he added, saw Biden in \u201cgreat form,\u201d and he had a \u201cgeneral sense\u201d that while the debate \u201cwas really bad \u2026 the campaign is doing a course correction and all of us want to double the effort to help with that turnaround.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s time to do polling and find out if there are any potential replacements that poll higher than Trump,\u201d billionaire businessman\u00a0Mark Cuban, who recently came out in support of Biden, told\u00a0CNN.\u00a0Trump is politically weak, Cuban said, so a Democrat who could\u00a0\u201cstep in and immediately change the race\u201d would be \u201cworth considering.\u201d For now, though, Cuban\u00a0\u2014 who said he is not a donor to the Biden campaign but did attend a fundraiser in March to show his support \u2014\u00a0made clear the task of replacing Biden this late in the cycle would be uniquely challenging. The former majority owner of the Dallas Mavericks basketball team, who previously supported former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley in the GOP primary, used a sports analogy:\u00a0\u201cAt this point, it\u2019s more like discussing an NBA or NFL game after the fact and wanting to trade players,\u201d Cuban said. Hoffman offered a variation on that theme in a Friday night email to friends \u2014 some of whom, he wrote, had been asking him \u201cwhether there should be a public campaign to pressure President Biden to step aside after his (very) bad debate performance last night.\u201d \u201cI think such a campaign to get Biden to step down would be a bad idea,\u201d Hoffman wrote, arguing that such steps might harden Biden\u2019s resolve to prove his doubters wrong. He also pointed to the president\u2019s lively performance at the rally in Virginia and to the way Republicans reacted following Trump\u2019s felony conviction last month. \u201cThey ruthlessly and immediately closed ranks,\u201d Hoffman wrote, \u201cbecause they understand that at this stage of the race, they must spend every minute and dime either boosting their old man, or tearing down ours.\u201d Another Democratic donor was more blunt about the state of play and the party\u2019s choices. \u201cI don\u2019t think (Biden) is going anywhere,\u201d the donor told CNN. \u201cThis is the old horse we\u2019ve got, and we need to ride him \u2018til he\u2019s ready for the glue factory.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/29/politics/democratic-donors-biden-debate-election/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/30/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_22_politics_democrats-elections-what-matters", "text": "With Democrats divided over the Israel-Hamas war, uninspired by their presidential nominee in Joe Biden and planning a convention in Chicago, there have been multiple comparisons to 1968, when Democrat Hubert Humphrey lost the White House to Republican Richard Nixon. The Vietnam War divided Democrats that year. Humphrey was uninspiring to younger voters opposed to the war. There was violence outside their convention in Chicago. Democrats today should hope that a better comparison is to 1948, when then-President Harry Truman, an unpopular incumbent, pulled off a surprise reelection versus Thomas Dewey, then the Republican governor of New York. That year, 1948, was also a much better year for Humphrey, then the young and inspiring Minneapolis mayor who helped push Democrats on the road to embracing civil rights legislation that would ultimately remake both political parties over the coming decades. I talked to Samuel Freedman, a Columbia Journalism School professor, about his recent book about Humphrey and the 1948 Democratic convention in Philadelphia. The book\u2019s title, \u201cInto the Bright Sunshine,\u201d is taken from a line in Humphrey\u2019s rousing speech on civil rights. The crackling audio does not hide the competing jeers and applause when Humphrey says: My friends, to those who say that we are rushing this issue of civil rights, I say to them we are 172 years late. To those who say that this civil-rights program is an infringement on states\u2019 rights, I say this: The time has arrived in America for the Democratic Party to get out of the shadow of states\u2019 rights and to walk forthrightly into the bright sunshine of human rights. It is a particularly important time to remember right now, when there is an effort on the American political right to reinterpret the history of the Civil Rights Movement. Here\u2019s my conversation with Freedman, conducted by phone and edited for length and clarity: Lessons for 2024 Biden from 1948 Truman WOLF: The fulcrum of the book is this 1948 Democratic convention and Humphrey\u2019s civil rights speech there. Until 2016, 1948 was probably the biggest presidential election upset in US history. What could 2024 Joe Biden, who trails Donald Trump in much of the polling, learn from 1948 Harry Truman, who trailed Thomas Dewey right to the end? FREEDMAN: They are very comparable experiences, even with the fact that Truman had not one third party, but two third parties also to worry about \u2013 Henry Wallace to his left and Strom Thurmond to his right. We don\u2019t know about the effect in the tight election of RFK Jr., and even for that matter, of (the Green Party\u2019s) Jill Stein. So Biden has a complicated course to run. Truman went back and forth on civil rights \u2013 he was very bold, amazingly so in 1946 and \u201947, then he backed away out of fear it would cost him the election in \u201848. Really what Humphrey\u2019s triumph with the civil rights plank at the \u201848 convention did is it forced Truman to run as a civil rights candidate, which ended up being the reason he won the race. He really starts it in July, Truman, by desegregating the military and the federal workforce, and he culminates it the last weekend before Election Day, having a rally and giving a campaign speech in Harlem, which no major party presidential candidate had ever done. So I think part of the lesson of what Truman did, for Biden, is to try to be bold, to be assertive, to take some of the risks that need to be taken. Humphrey went from heroic to ridiculed WOLF: Today, we look at Hubert Humphrey as an also-ran of American politics. What were you trying to accomplish writing a book that leads up to this single speech at the \u201948 convention? FREEDMAN: I wanted to fill two gaps. I wanted to, first of all, fill a biographical gap about Humphrey, because if people know him at all today, it\u2019s from a largely disparaged and ridiculed latter part of his career supporting the Vietnam War as Lyndon Johnson\u2019s vice president, getting the presidential nomination in 1968 amid the police riot in Chicago, and then really fecklessly, almost pathetically, running as the establishment candidate against George McGovern for the Democratic nomination in 1972. And yet, there was this amazing chapter in his earlier life when he had been out there in a way few White Americans of the time were, really putting his entire career at risk to fight the fight for civil rights. People who felt betrayed by Humphrey in the \u201960s because he was no longer being a liberal hero forgot why they thought he was a liberal hero in the first place. And what he did in the 1948 convention is the epitome of it, to get the Democratic Party to endorse the civil rights agenda for the first time ever, and to accomplish something that FDR hadn\u2019t been willing to do, which was to defy and ultimately oust the Southern segregationist wing of the party. The other gap I wanted to fill was a historical gap, because a lot of the great writing that\u2019s been done about the Civil Rights Movement tends to position its origins in the 1950s with the Montgomery bus boycott and Brown v. Board of Ed decision, and so forth. And yet, there was all this activity in the \u201940s, very much catalyzed by Black GIs and the Double V movement (victory in the war and victory over oppression at home). You know, very much affected by the global war against fascism, and that activity really anticipates and makes possible everything that happens in the \u201950s and \u201860s, and yet has gotten much less attention, comparatively speaking. So those were the two gaps I was aiming to address. 2024 vs. 1968 WOLF: Humphrey is certainly more associated with that \u201968 convention. This year, there\u2019s obviously a fractured Democratic Party, as there was in 1968, and the convention is again in Chicago. What are the similarities you see between this year and \u201868? FREEDMAN:  There are a couple of takeaways from Humphrey\u2019s campaign in \u201968. One is you\u2019ve got to really hit the right tone. The speech that he made in April of 1968 to announce his campaign was so tone-deaf. It talked about the politics of happiness, the politics of joy, and it was completely out of tune with the tenor of the times. This is like three and a half weeks after Martin Luther King had been killed. It\u2019s just about as long as after Lyndon Johnson decided not to run. There was a massive anti-war movement. It just felt like Humphrey, who usually had such a keen sense of retail politics, totally misread the mood of the country. He struggled, really for the rest of the campaign, to come back to finding a way to stick to things he wanted to stick to about hope and unity and possibility, while trying to find the words, and I think never really quite succeeding, to acknowledge the hurt, the anxiety, the division within the country. It\u2019s also a lesson about the importance of optics, and this is even before the 24-hour news cycle. Humphrey is giving his speech at the \u201968 convention, where in the middle of his speech, the live TV coverage cuts away to show the Chicago police beating demonstrators and journalists on the streets of Chicago. It\u2019s the most catastrophic optic you could imagine. Another similarity is that although Joe Biden has run essentially unopposed in primaries, it\u2019s almost as if he didn\u2019t really have to face the Democratic voting public this year, the way he definitely did in 2020, and comes in as feeling more coordinated and less chosen. In 1968, the Democratic Party was operating under old rules in which primary voters actually had relatively little direct effect on delegates. Humphrey enters late, after Bobby Kennedy had been in, after Eugene McCarthy had been in, and won most of his delegates by going through the party apparatus. So it looked like he had this nomination kind of handed to him by the machine, over and against the passions of the voters, who had turned out in large numbers for Bobby Kennedy and Eugene McCarthy. That also presents a problem of how do you build up the requisite passion? At the end of the day, he did something in late September that almost saved his campaign, which was finally to break away from Lyndon Johnson on Vietnam and to stake out a much bolder peace plank on Vietnam. In fact, it was a peace plank that was defeated at the convention where Humphrey\u2019s forces opposed it. Had Humphrey done that sooner would he have won? Good question. The other important thing Humphrey said, that I think Biden really has to find a way to express, came from the speech accepting the nomination. I\u2019m going to read you this paragraph, because I think it\u2019s so prescient. He says: I say to those who\u2019ve differed with their neighbor or with those who\u2019ve differed with their fellow Democrat, may I say to you that all of your goals, all of your high hopes, all of your dreams, all them will come to naught if we lose this election, and many of them can be realized with the victory that can come to us. That is so exactly right, and it\u2019s something that Joe Biden has to communicate. Just like for people, particularly young liberals, who couldn\u2019t bring themselves to vote for Humphrey in \u201968, what they got was Nixon. What they got was, instead of peace talks and a bombing halt, and an internationally supervised ceasefire, which was Humphrey\u2019s stance by the end of the campaign, they got the war going on for seven more years, with tens of thousands more American deaths and hundreds of thousands, if not millions, more Vietnamese deaths. They got Watergate. They got the race-baiting that Nixon engaged in. They got the proto-Trump pseudo populism of Spiro Agnew as vice president. So there\u2019s a real price to pay there for hanging on to your purity of not being able to vote for Hubert Humphrey and forgive him even the egregious mistake on Vietnam because of everything else he brought to the table that was absolutely consistent with the liberal agenda. Correcting the counterfactual about Republicans and civil rights WOLF: As I was reading the climax of this book, there was an interview on CNN with Rep. Byron Donalds, the Republican from Florida, who was arguing this counterfactual \u2013 and you can find many other instances of it \u2013 that a lot of present-day Republicans are pushing that they deserve credit for the Civil Rights Movement, because Abraham Lincoln was a Republican, because there were Southern Democrats who opposed the Civil Rights Act. This comes up in your descriptions of the \u201948 convention, particularly with Strom Thurmond (the South Carolina Democrat turned Republican). I was hoping to get your historical analysis of that idea. FREEDMAN: It\u2019s preposterous for the Republicans to make that argument in 2024 or at any time in the last 60 years, to be honest. When Strom Thurmond and the Dixiecrats bolted from the Democratic Party in 1948, that\u2019s the beginning of the vast majority of the White South becoming Republicans, stepping away from the Democratic Party. Even though (Adlai) Stevenson in \u201952 and \u201856 and JFK in 1960 tried to lure them back in, it was still the beginning of a process by which \u2013 with Barry Goldwater in \u201964, who opposed civil rights legislation; Nixon\u2019s \u201cSouthern strategy\u201d in \u201868 and \u201872; (Ronald) Reagan\u2019s appeals to racial resentment in \u201880 and \u201884; the Willie Horton ad in \u201888; and then to Trump in all of his races \u2013 that all began in \u201848. Those people who walked out with Strom Thurmond and the voters who voted for them never really went back to the Democratic Party again. While the party labels have remained the same \u2013 there is still the Democratic Party and there is still the Republican Party \u2013 the people who are voting have totally exchanged places, because the parties exchanged places on the issue of civil rights. It\u2019s true that, going back to Lincoln, the Republicans were seen as the party of emancipation and the amendments that created, at least on paper, racial equality. On that basis, until 1948 really with Truman, and then in even larger numbers in 1964 with LBJ and consistently since then, the White Southern vote that used to go to the Democrats, because the Democrats were the party of Jim Crow, has become the solid White vote for the Republican Party. Show me a major Republican politician in the MAGA movement who is a fervent supporter of civil rights legislation. In any kind of iteration, you don\u2019t have (Republicans) now like Mitt Romney\u2019s father, (former Michigan Gov.) George Romney, or (former Pennsylvania Gov.) William Scranton, or Edward Brooke, a Black senator from Massachusetts \u2026 You don\u2019t even have people like Nixon, before he went bad on civil rights, who was a really active member of the NAACP. That doesn\u2019t exist in the Republican Party anymore, and it\u2019s just absurd to say that because 80 years ago to 100, 120 years ago, the Democrats were indeed the party of segregation, that that\u2019s somehow still the case.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/22/politics/democrats-elections-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/30/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_26_politics_primaries-maga-squad-what-matters", "text": "There must be some sort of larger takeaway in the fact that Rep. Lauren Boebert, among the most MAGA members of Congress, won a Republican primary in Colorado on Tuesday night, and Rep. Jamaal Bowman, a member of the progressive \u201cSquad\u201d from the Bronx, lost a Democratic primary to a more moderate candidate from Westchester County in New York. Every House race is different, obviously, since all politics is local, according to the old saying. So it would be an oversimplification to say that Republicans moved more MAGA and Democrats moved more moderate based on these two unrelated races. More MAGA or moderate? And yet there\u2019s evidence to support that general trend. Look no further than the two parties\u2019 presidential candidates. Former President Donald Trump personifies MAGA, and a large part of the Make America Great Again ethos he pushes is loyalty to him. President Joe Biden, on the other hand, effectively worked with Republicans to pass a bill to improve the nation\u2019s infrastructure and has said he wants to work with Republicans on immigration reform. Many Republicans will tell you they don\u2019t believe Biden. There\u2019s nothing moderate about either Boebert or Bowman, who occupy space on the fringe of their respective parties. Both were also seriously flawed candidates with problems that extend beyond policy. Boebert was kicked out of a theater last year for vaping and \u201ccausing a disturbance,\u201d for instance. Bowman was charged last year with pulling a fire alarm in a House office building when there was no emergency. Rather than face voters in the district she narrowly won two years ago, Boebert moved to run in a district with a more conservative voting record. She emerged from a crowded field to win the Republican primary in the district, which was previously represented by Rep. Ken Buck, a conservative Republican who is a critic of Trump and had resigned from office in frustration. Bowman, on the other hand, was targeted by more mainstream Democrats in part for his loud criticism of Israel in its war on Hamas in Gaza, an issue that has split Democrats this year. Pro-Israel groups spent heavily in the race, attempting to oust Bowman. However, in advertising, Bowman was attacked more for his opposition to Biden\u2019s policies than for his position on Israel. Evidence of a liberal retreat I asked CNN\u2019s Gregory Krieg, who covered the Bowman race, why he thinks Bowman lost and what it says about Democrats today. Here\u2019s what he emailed back: KRIEG: There are obviously many ways to read Bowman\u2019s defeat, and his failure to bridge the gap with pro-Israel Jewish voters in the district, specifically in Westchester, is understandably the one you\u2019re hearing most often. But I also think, if we\u2019re looking at this through a national lens, it\u2019s hard to not see it as part of the broader liberal retreat from some of the more aggressive left-wing characters and candidates they embraced during Trump\u2019s presidency.\u00a0 For all the talk about Democrats\u2019 lack of enthusiasm about Biden personally, the idea of Biden \u2013 the moderate, even-tempered statesman type \u2013 is still very, very popular. And (Westchester County Executive George) Latimer, to some extent, embodied that.  It obviously did not help Bowman that AIPAC (the American Israel Public Affairs Committee) and other outside groups bombarded him with record spending and gobs of money invested in research into every thought that\u2019s crossed his mind the last 25 years.  That primary voters did not hold the spending against Latimer, as progressives argued they should, also reminds me that voters (especially Democrats) in presidential cycles tend to be cautious. You\u2019ll probably never hear Trump, Fox News or anyone on the right mention Latimer\u2019s name. And for some folks left-of-center, that\u2019s priceless. Utah went its own way While Boebert\u2019s victory provides a foil for Bowman\u2019s loss, it was far from a perfect night for more MAGA Republicans. In a separate Colorado race, the chair of the state GOP, Dave Williams, who had gotten Trump\u2019s endorsement but who said controversial things about gay rights \u2013 including that Pride flags should be burned \u2013 lost to the more establishment pick, Jeff Crank, a real estate investor and former talk radio host. And in Utah, Republicans snubbed the MAGA options for both governor and senator in a state that is very conservative but where the base of Mormon voters has bristled at the former president. Current Sen. Mitt Romney is a notable Trump critic in the GOP, and his decision not to run for reelection opened up an opportunity to replace one of the few remaining Republicans who voted to convict Trump on impeachment charges in 2021 with a Trump-backed Republican. Rep. John Curtis, the winner of the GOP Senate primary, did not vote to convict Trump as a member of the House, but he is the rare Republican focused on climate change, an issue that disproportionately affects Utah but which Trump dismisses. The larger problem \u2026 Both Curtis and Gov. Spencer Cox were actually rejected by GOP party activists at the state\u2019s nominating convention but found their way onto the ballot with the help of signature drives. Cox has taken more moderate positions on certain issues and was booed at the state GOP convention this year,\u00a0according to The Associated Press. But Cox and Curtis both easily won their primaries, which essentially determine the winner of statewide contests in a state like Utah. It\u2019s a shame that primary voters are becoming the de facto general election voters in states and districts that lean heavily to one side or the other, according to former Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels, a Republican who wrote a lament in The Washington Post that most of the country lives in a state with \u201ctrifecta\u201d government, where one party controls most of what\u2019s happening at their state level. Daniels writes: The issue isn\u2019t simply that states lean reliably Republican or Democratic. It\u2019s that now a big majority are heavily, maybe irrevocably, tilted in one direction or the other. Where that obtains, office seekers pitch their initial appeals to the hard core on their side, as primary candidates always have. The difference is that, instead of the winner\u2019s traditional post-primary imperative, to reach out to nonpartisans and even open-minded members of the opposing party, now their job is finished. There are efforts to change this dynamic, which we\u2019ve written about in this newsletter, such as in states experimenting with nonpartisan primaries and ranked-choice voting. But Daniels has a point. None of the races we\u2019ve discussed so far in this story are expected to be at all competitive in November.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/26/politics/primaries-maga-squad-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/30/2024", "section": "politics"}}

In May, Trump was\u00a0found guilty of 34 counts of falsifying business records\u00a0in a New York court \u2014 in an unprecedented criminal trial that made him the first former US president to be convicted of a felony. Prosecutors said he falsified records to conceal a payment made to an adult film actress to keep her from speaking out about an alleged affair with Trump before the 2016 election. Trump has denied the affair. New Jersey regulators will hold the hearing \u2014 which comes after the presumptive Republican nominee is set to be sentenced in New York on July 11 \u2014 and determine whether the liquor licenses at the golf courses in Colts Neck and Bedminster can be legally renewed. \u201cA review by ABC [Alcohol Beverage Control]\u00a0indicates that Mr. Trump maintains a direct beneficial interest in the three liquor licenses through the receipt of revenues and profits from them, as the sole beneficiary of the Donald J.

A spokesperson for the Trump Organization called the hearing \u201cunwarranted and unjustified.\u201d \u201cAs previously stated, President Trump is not the holder of any liquor license in New Jersey, and he is not an officer, director or operator of any entity that holds a liquor license in New Jersey,\u201d a statement obtained by CNN on Saturday reads. \u201cWe sincerely hope that this investigation is not political in nature, and given the foregoing, we feel confident that our licenses will remain unaffected,\u201d the statement said. The liquor licenses at the Colts Neck and Bedminster golf courses expire Sunday, and until the hearing, the clubs will be allowed to sell liquor under a state-issued temporary 90-day permit, according to the attorney general\u2019s office spokesperson. \u201cDuring such a hearing, the applicant bears the burden of proof to demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that they remain qualified to maintain licensure, which includes a review of any beneficiaries of the licenses,\u201d they said. The liquor license for Trump\u2019s third New Jersey golf course in Pine Hill was renewed on June 3, the spokesperson said. \u201cABC declines further comment on the status of that license pending the outcome of the hearing set for the Colts Neck and Lamington Farm Club licenses,\u201d the spokesperson said.

Not physical work like you do in the plant. And he has a solid gold toilet at home. So, I mean, how can he really empathize with your life?\u201d Sometimes Robinson joins the debate along the assembly line or in the break room, pointing out President Joe Biden\u2019s long history of supporting organized labor, including his decision to join striking United Auto Workers on the picket line in Michigan during their six-week strike last year. The UAW endorsed Biden earlier this year. The retort? \u201cYou, know: guns, gays, abortion, sleepy Joe, Hunter Biden,\u201d Robinson said. \u201cThey just tell me these outlandish things that they think are important. \u2026 If Hunter Biden is such a big issue, why isn\u2019t Jared Kushner a big issue?\u201d The\u00a0autoworkers strike, which ended late last year, was a big win for the UAW.\u00a0Robinson\u00a0got a nice raise and cost of living adjustments were restored in the deal. The bigger gains went to less experienced UAW members hired after the 2008 financial crisis, when the automakers said their only path to survival was a two-tier wage and benefits system that paid new workers less. \u201cI think we got more than I thought we would,\u201d Robinson said in an interview during his lunch break at the UAW Local 900 headquarters across the street from a giant Ford assembly plant. But it didn\u2019t solve everything. \u201cGas prices are still pretty high,\u201d Robinson said. \u201cIt\u2019s just me and my wife and it\u2019s $200 every time I go to the grocery store.\u201d We met Robinson as part of a CNN project tracking the 2024 election through the eyes and experiences of voters who live in presidential battleground states and are part of key voting blocs. UAW membership is way down from Detroit\u2019s heyday, but at roughly 134,000 members in Michigan now, the union remains a political force in this swing state, which Biden won by less than 3 points in 2020 after Trump won it by less than a point four years earlier. Robinson believes the UAW leadership has improved its standing with the rank and file because of the contract gains. But he is skeptical that the UAW endorsement of Biden will sway many of his union colleagues who back Trump. \u201cYou have people in there, in the plant, who don\u2019t want to be told what to do,\u201d Robinson said. Blue-collar voters looking for politicians who understand them People like Bill Govier\u00a0from Wixom, Michigan. \u201cI love my job,\u201d said Govier, a 25-year Ford employee and UAW member who started on the assembly line and now works as a millwright. \u201cAs a skilled tradesman, I definitely love my job.\u201d Govier calls himself\u00a0\u201ca little more on the conservative side, but really close to the middle.\u201d He voted for Trump in both 2016 and 2020. \u201cI\u2019m probably more tolerant than I have ever been, but the powers that be label me as some far-right White supremacist MAGA Republican,\u201d he said. Govier also bristles at how critics label Trump. \u201cEverybody wants to say, \u2018Oh he said this, it\u2019s the nastiest thing ever.\u2019 Stop, just stop. Quit taking things out of context, read the whole thing, listen to the whole thing,\u201d Govier said. \u201cI just don\u2019t see him as the anti-Christ, or Hitler. That\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d Govier described his 2016 vote this way: \u201cI don\u2019t trust Hillary (Clinton) . \u2026 I voted against Hillary more so than for Trump.\u201d In 2020, he said he \u201cliked where the country was going,\u201d praising the pre-Covid Trump economy and how the then-president handled relations with North Korea. Now, Govier said, \u201cI\u2019m leaning away from Biden more than for Trump.\u201d Govier makes a point we hear a lot from blue-collar voters in our travels. \u201cI don\u2019t think there are a lot of people in this country under the age of 40 that really understand what it is like to work with your hands,\u201d Govier said. \u201cMost of the politicians I don\u2019t think understand it.\u00a0\u2026 So, it is hard for guys like us to feel represented properly.\u201d Before committing to vote for Trump in 2024, Govier said he wants to research independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. But he said he would be hesitant to vote third party if he believed it might help Biden. \u201cI would really rather have Kennedy,\u201d he said. But if voting for him boosts Biden, he added, \u201cI might have to vote for Trump.\u201d Chris Vitale has no hesitation about his 2024 choice: he will proudly vote for Trump a third time. \u201cI\u2019m sort of the hands of the engineer,\u201d is how he describes his job doing mechanical work in the engine development shop at Stellantis, the parent company of Chrysler. He is a 30-year Chrysler employee and 30-year UAW member. Vitale blames Democrats for his Trump support. Gone from the party, he says, are people like former Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt, who twice unsuccessfully sought the Democratic presidential nomination, first in 1988. \u201cHe raised a lot of midwestern manufacturing concerns with NAFTA and things like that,\u201d Vitale said of Gephardt. \u201cSo what happened to those Democrats? Those are the Democrats I wanted to vote for. They\u2019re gone now.\u201d Vitale said he initially viewed Trump as \u201cjust another distraction, a sideshow or something\u201d early in the 2016 race. But then he heard Trump talk tough on trade and promise to revive American manufacturing. \u201cI\u2019ve watched this region go from the arsenal of democracy,\u201d Vitale said. \u201cI watched it go from that realm of importance to now we\u2019re happy we can get a sports stadium or we\u2019re going to sell weed or fireworks. It\u2019s absolutely pathetic what we have sunk to and our politicians, they\u2019re good with it. He isn\u2019t. So that is the difference.\u201d Vitale said Biden policies that he argues are hurting the industry are more important to him than the president\u2019s decision to show up at a UAW picket line. \u201cI think the government seems to be appeasing the coasts,\u201d Vitale said during an interview in St. Clair Shores, a town in battleground Macomb County just north of Detroit. \u201cYou know, everyone who lives in Manhattan thinks everyone should drive an electric car. Everyone who lives in Los Angeles thinks the world is coming to an end and you can\u2019t have any more internal combustion engine cars. \u2026 The middle of the country, which used to be the manufacturing base of this country, doesn\u2019t feel that way, doesn\u2019t operate that way. So there is a huge divide.\u201d Vitale said a Trump win would mean an end to requirements for automakers to sell more EVs and, he believes, trade policies designed to protect American jobs. \u201cWe\u2019ve got the government against us at every turn,\u201d Vitale said. \u201cI can\u2019t believe the people who are responsible for regulating our industries are so out of tune with our industries.\u201d Union leadership\u2019s endorsement only goes so far Bob King sees a profound disconnect between Trump\u2019s words and actions \u2013 or inactions \u2013 and he hopes the UAW leadership hones in on that as it sells its endorsement of Biden over the final five months of the campaign. King worked at Ford for more than 40 years and was UAW president for four years during the Obama presidency, when the auto industry \u2013 and the UAW \u2013 were reeling from the 2008 global financial crisis. That is when the two-tiered contracts went into effect, and King sees both a financial and a psychological hit that caused disaffection among blue collar workers \u2013 and ultimately drove many to Trump. \u201cThey are listening because they don\u2019t believe anybody has delivered for them,\u201d King said in an interview. \u201cPeople feel like the establishment hasn\u2019t been delivering for them. Is your life better now than it was 10 years ago? For many working people, it is worse. Their standard of living has deteriorated. In some cases, their communities have deteriorated.\u201d The new contract, King argues, erases most of the concessions made after the financial crisis and, in his view, should boost the standing of the current UAW leadership as it makes the case Biden is better than Trump for union workers. Tonya Rincon isn\u2019t so sure of that. \u201cThe leadership gives their advice and their official endorsement and in the rank and file it goes about 50-50,\u201d said Rincon, a 30-year Ford worker and UAW member. \u201cAnd it will probably go 50-50 this time.\u201d Perhaps, she said, the president\u2019s decision to visit the picket line will help a tad. \u201cMaybe it will move a small percentage and Michigan is a state where small percentages matter,\u201d she said in an interview in the Local 900 union hall. \u201cSo maybe it will be 51-49. But I don\u2019t think it moved a lot of people.\u201d Rincon is committed to Biden. \u201cBecause I think he does care about working men and women,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat he is doing for our kids, with helping to arrest out-of-control student debt. \u2026 Everything he stands for. It aligns with my values. So he has my support.\u201d Objections to Biden among Ford colleagues include the administration\u2019s aggressive support of shifting to EVs. Rincon disagrees with that critique. \u201cI think we should have as many options for drivers as they want to have,\u201d Rincon said. \u201cWe need to build cars and we need to paint them and put them on drive trains, regardless of what kind of engine they have. So it is not going to cost us jobs.\u201d Like Robinson, she rolls her eyes at colleagues who say Trump understands them better. \u201cHe\u2019s stiffed working men and women his entire business career,\u201d Rincon said. \u201cSo I don\u2019t understand that.\u201d But she went on, like King, to suggest some of Trump\u2019s support stems from worries among voters that growing up in communities like Wayne isn\u2019t as safe a bet as it once was. \u201cI didn\u2019t go to college after high school,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I bummed around working a bunch of crappy retail jobs and service jobs. \u2026 And then I lucked out, started a family and needed a good paying job. So I got into the plant.\u201d But that path to middle class security isn\u2019t as guaranteed as it once was. \u201cFor about the last 15 years that hasn\u2019t really been the reality,\u201d Rincon said, because of the two-tier wage and benefits system. \u201cPeople were making as little working on the line now as I made 30 years ago when I started, which is kind of crazy. So people still wanted to get to the Big Three [automakers], but the reality was they weren\u2019t making a realistic living.\u201d The new contract fixed some of those issues, and Rincon said morale is better inside the plant. \u201cIt mattered,\u201d she said, that Biden came out to support the strikers. But did it change the conversation about the president? \u201cInside the plants?\u201d Rincon said. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think it did.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/12/politics/autoworkers-michigan-biden-trump/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/30/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_28_politics_biden-trump-presidential-debate-analysis", "text": "If Joe Biden loses November\u2019s election, history will record that it took just 10 minutes to destroy a presidency. It was clear a political disaster was about to unfold as soon as the 81-year-old commander in chief stiffly shuffled on stage in Atlanta to stand eight feet from ex-President Donald Trump at what may turn into the most fateful presidential debate in history. Objectively, Biden produced the weakest performance since John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon started the tradition of televised debates in 1960 \u2014 then, as on Thursday, in a television studio with no audience. Minutes into the showdown, hosted by CNN, a full-blown Democratic panic was underway at the idea of heading into the election with such a diminished figure at the top of the ticket. Biden\u2019s chief debate coach, Ron Klain, famously argues that \u201cwhile you can lose a debate at any time, you can only win it in the first 30 minutes.\u201d By that standard, the president\u2019s showing was devastating. The tone of the evening was set well before the half hour. It is too early to say how voters will respond and whether the president can rescue himself. But Biden barely beat Trump in key battleground states in the middle of a pandemic in 2020. His approval rating was below 40% before the debate, when he was at best neck-and-neck with his rival in the polls. It would only take a few thousand voters to desert him to put Trump back in the White House. There has been no public sign that Biden is unable to fulfill the duties of the presidency, which include tough decisions on national security. He has just returned from two grueling foreign trips, for instance. But on Thursday\u2019s evidence, his ability to communicate with the country \u2013 and even to sell his own vision for a second term \u2013 is severely compromised. If the debate was the president\u2019s best chance to turn around a tight race with Trump, which has him in deep peril of losing reelection, it was a failure. Biden ended the night with the Democratic Party in crisis with serious conversations taking place behind the scenes among senior figures over whether his candidacy is now sustainable, two months before the Democratic National Convention. The president aimed for an immediate rebound at a post-debate rally in North Carolina Friday, appearing rested, defiant and animated in what was a clear attempt to a quiet a storm of questions about whether he should shelve his reelection race. \u201cI know I\u2019m not a young man, to state the obvious,\u201d Biden told a crowd that chanted \u201cfour more years, four more years.\u201d The\u00a0president added,\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t walk as easy as I used\u00a0to. I\u00a0don\u2019t speak as smoothly as I used to.\u00a0I don\u2019t debate as well as I used to.\u201d Biden went on, raising his voice,\u201cBut I know what I do know. I know how to tell the truth. I know right from wrong. And I know how to do this job.\u201d \u201cI know what millions of Americans know: When you get knocked down, you get back up.\u201d Biden\u2019s much improved performance in a scripted stump speech before a friendly audience however only further exposed his failures on Thursday night when he had his best chance to counter Trump before tens of millions of television viewers. Trump\u2019s task on Thursday was to avoid playing into Biden\u2019s claims that he\u2019s \u201cunhinged\u201d and is therefore unfit to return to the Oval Office. He largely did so as he got out of the way while the president was damaging his own campaign. The presumptive Republican nominee\u2019s unaccustomed restraint, however, did wear thin later in the debate. But in one devastating moment, after yet another Biden waffle, he said: \u201cI really don\u2019t know what he said at the end of that sentence. I don\u2019t think he knows what he said, either.\u201d The ex-president didn\u2019t avoid his own disqualifying issues. He was uncouth and divisive. He spouted outrageous falsehoods about his own presidency, his attempt to steal the last election, and sometimes lapsed into gibberish himself, especially when asked about climate change. He blatantly lied about his role in the mob attack by his supporters on the US Capitol on January 6, 2021. The twice-impeached convicted felon repeatedly declined to say that he would accept the result of the 2024 election if he lost and made sweeping, vague and often illogical claims that US enemies overseas would bend to his will just because of his personality. The former president also struggled to parry Biden\u2019s arguments that he\u2019d slash taxes for rich Americans and leave workers struggling, and he was wobbly on policy, just as he was in the White House. By the time the aged rivals slipped into a bitter debate about who was the best golfer, it was not hard to understand why voters have long told pollsters that they want no part of the choice they have been offered this year. Why Biden\u2019s showing could be so consequential But Biden has rooted his reelection in the idea that he is the last thing standing between America and a second Trump presidency that would destroy democracy and usher in an unprecedented era of American autocracy. Voters who take him at his word could not help but be alarmed at his abject debate showing. Biden\u2019s voice was weak, at times reduced to a whisper. Early on, the president\u2019s answers drifted into incoherence. He missed openings to jab Trump on abortion \u2014 the top Democratic talking point \u2014 and meandered into highlighting his own biggest political liability, immigration. \u201cWe finally beat Medicare,\u201d Biden said at one point, lapsing into confused silence. It was the kind of debate gaffe that Democrats had hoped to avoid. Worse, while Trump spoke, Biden often watched, his mouth gaping open, exacerbating an impression of a president cruelly diminished. His bravura battering of Trump in a debate four years ago was a distant memory. To see a president struggle before millions of people watching on television all around the world was tough to see. As a matter of humanity, the personification of the ravages of age that await everyone was painful. Biden\u2019s campaign revealed during the debate that he had been suffering from a cold. But by that time, the damage had already been done. Biden had entered the debate facing a somber test \u2014 to prove to the majority of Americans who believe he is too old to serve that he is vital, energetic and up to fulfilling his duties in a second term that would end when he is 86. Instead, the president ended up validating those fears and potentially convincing many more voters that his faculties have decayed. The stumbling performance raised questions about the strategic choice Biden\u2019s campaign made in pushing for a debate with Trump. It also completely undercut attempts by the White House and the campaign to talk up Biden\u2019s heartiness behind the scenes. Memories of the president\u2019s barnstorming State of the Union address in March, when he put many fears about his age to rest, have now been obliterated. \u2018Painful\u2019 Often, presidential debates are remembered for visual moments that become embedded in the collective public consciousness in subsequent days. Troublingly for Biden, a viewer only paying attention to visual clues would surely have formed the impression that Trump was the more robust personality. And the history of presidential elections suggests that the candidate who seems strong often beats the one who is weak. \u201cIt\u2019s painful. I love Joe Biden,\u201d said Van Jones, a CNN political commentator. \u201cHe\u2019s a good man, he loves his country, he\u2019s doing the best that he can. But he had a chance \u2026 tonight to restore confidence of the country and of the base and he failed to do that. And I think there are a lot of people who are going to want to see him take a different course now.\u201d Vice President Kamala Harris led attempts to turn the focus away from the optics of Biden\u2019s performance to the threat posed by his Republican opponent. \u201cYes, there was a slow start, but it was a strong finish,\u201d Harris told CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper following the debate. \u201cAnd what became very clear through the course of the night is that Joe Biden is fighting on behalf of the American people. On substance, on policy, on performance, Joe Biden is extraordinarily strong.\u201d \u201cPeople can debate on style points. But ultimately, this election and who is the president of the United States has to be about substance. And the contrast is clear. Look at what happened during the course of the debate. Donald Trump lied over and over and over again as he is wont to do,\u201d she said. Biden\u2019s best moments came too late Harris is correct in her assessment of Trump\u2019s cascade of untruths. And as the debate wore on, the president did seem to get a little stronger. He was especially animated when he spoke about Trump\u2019s threat to democracy. He was scathing about the ex-president\u2019s failure to admit defeat four years ago. \u201cYou can\u2019t stand the loss,\u201d Biden said. \u201cSomething snapped in you when you lost the last time.\u201d And in an extraordinary moment in a debate before millions of television viewers, Biden highlighted Trump\u2019s conviction in his hush money trial in New York. \u201cHow many billions of dollars do you owe in civil penalties for molesting a woman in public? For doing a whole range of things? Of having sex with a porn star on the night \u2013 while your wife was pregnant?\u201d Biden asked Trump. \u201cYou have the morals of an alley cat.\u201d The former president was found guilty last month of 34 counts of falsifying business records in his criminal hush money trial. Last year, a jury found him liable for sexual abuse in a civil defamation suit. And Trump, his adult sons and the Trump Organization lost a huge civil fraud trial, also in New York. But the problem for Biden was that his best moments of the night came deep into the 90-minute showdown, by which time most viewers would have formed strong impressions. And at times, he appeared unable to defend his record or effectively expose Trump\u2019s torrent of falsehoods and distortions of his own first-term legacy. The president only briefly flashed his beaming smile, which he had effectively used to debunk Trump\u2019s absurd arguments in their debate four years ago and when he rhetorically dismembered Republican vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan during the 2012 vice presidential debate. If the cacophony of behind-the-scenes venting by Democrats coalesces into more serious questions about Biden\u2019s capacity, the crisis around him will deepen. But it is hard to see any easy way \u2014 apart from a decision by the president not to accept the party nomination \u2013 that there could be any change to the Democratic ticket. And any decision to try and replace a president who has successfully run the table in Democratic nominating contests would be unprecedented in the modern age and might end up dividing the party \u2014 a step that in itself could help Trump become only the second president to win a non-consecutive second term. There has been little effort by the Biden White House to promote Harris as the president\u2019s heir \u2014 and she has significant political problems of her own. And no Democrat with future presidential possibilities \u2014 for instance, California Gov. Gavin Newsom or Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer \u2014 took the risk of challenging an incumbent who once presented himself as a bridge to the future of the party. Biden is not the first president to have a bad debate \u2014 although his ordeal on Thursday far surpasses the misfires by Barack Obama and Ronald Reagan. Both those presidents bounced back the next time they got the chance on the debate stage and went on to win a second term. But while a second debate with Trump is scheduled for September, it is hard to find a tactical rationale for the ex-president to offer his rival a do-over. One Democratic operative summed up the president\u2019s debate for CNN\u2019s Kasie Hunt with a word that now threatens to encapsulate his entire reelection bid unless Biden can turn the story around. \u201cHorrific,\u201d the person said.

{"id": "2024_06_27_politics_presidential-debate-trump-biden", "text": "The confrontation in Atlanta between Joe Biden and Donald Trump Thursday night has a good chance of becoming the most fateful presidential debate in US history. For the first time, a sitting president and an ex-president will lock horns before millions of viewers, in an encounter taking place far earlier than normal \u2014 even before the party conventions. The CNN-hosted showdown is the most pivotal moment yet in a neck-and-neck election, and it\u2019s Biden\u2019s best chance to shake up a reelection bid that he is in deep danger of losing as he struggles to convince voters that he\u2019s delivered the political and economic normality he promised in 2020. The debate comes at a moment when many Americans are seeking relief from high prices that have made it harder to feed their families and afford rents, mortgages, and new cars. It is unfolding amid an intense national debate over access to abortion that was unleashed by the conservative Supreme Court majority built by Trump. Deep divides over immigration and foreign policy in a world filled with new challenges to US power will form a contentious backdrop to a clash between two candidates who openly disdain one another. The debate in that sense personifies an election race that has left millions of Americans unsatisfied with the choice offered by two elderly candidates who alienate more voters than they attract. But the momentous circumstances of the occasion can only be fully understood alongside the context of the unprecedented politics of the times. Since Sen. John F. Kennedy and Vice President Richard Nixon staged\u00a0the first televised debate\u00a0in the 1960 campaign, there have been agonizingly close elections that have set the country on a sharply different course. But the stakes in 2024 are greater than ever because of Trump\u2019s attempt to disrupt the peaceful transfer of power based on false claims of fraud in the 2020 election and his promise to wage a never-before-seen presidency of personal vengeance if he wins in November. Biden plans to frame what he sees as Trump\u2019s threat to the rule of law and democracy in the starkest terms, sources familiar with the matter told CNN\u2019s Kayla Tausche. He will describe the mob attack by Trump\u2019s supporters on the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, as a \u201cseismic,\u201d era-defining moment that must be a watershed for voters. \u201cThe embodiment of the threat is returning,\u201d said one Biden source. That backdrop means this presidential debate has a different cast than all its predecessors. Had Sen. John Kerry beaten President George W. Bush in 2004 or ex-Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney made President Barack Obama a one-term president in 2012, there would have been significant political change. But the character of the republic and its global posture would not have fundamentally altered. That assurance cannot be applied with any confidence to the current election. Trump\u2019s strongman impulse \u2013 epitomized by his claim before the Supreme Court that presidents have almost limitless power, as well as a blueprint for hardline new policies on immigration, the economy and foreign policy \u2013 means a second term could bring massive disruption. \u201c(It is) unbelievably historic. You cannot (over) hype up the importance of this,\u201d presidential historian Douglas Brinkley told CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer on Wednesday. Democrats are desperate for the 81-year-old Biden to put on a show of vitality and sharpness amid concerns about his age. Seventy-eight-year-old Trump\u2019s biggest liability might be himself and the possibility of a performance that could validate Biden\u2019s warnings that he\u2019s too \u201cunhinged\u201d to be president. Biden is expected to hammer Trump over abortion \u2014 one of the few policy areas where he outpolls the former president \u2014 and his admiration of foreign dictators. Trump is already signaling he\u2019ll portray Biden\u2019s America in dystopian terms, beset by uncontrolled immigration, rampant crime and searing economic pain. The most extraordinary aspect of the debate is that it takes place less than a month after Trump was convicted in a criminal hush money case in New York. Biden has already highlighted the guilty verdict in campaign events, but Trump insists that he\u2019s the victim of an attempt to weaponize the legal system to interfere in the election. Both candidates are facing extreme pressure Both men will hope to avoid the kind of debate night gaffes or odd personal quirks that have often gone viral and dominated critical post-debate media coverage that helps cement the perception of who won and who lost in voters\u2019 minds. Vice President Al Gore\u2019s theatrical sighs in 2000 and President George H.W. Bush\u2019s unwise glance at his watch in 1992 both became emblems of losing campaigns. The risks are now much higher because of social media. Presidential debates don\u2019t always decide who wins in November. But the tension surrounding this year\u2019s first debate in June, rather than in September or October as usual, is palpable. \u201cThe closer the election, the greater the chance that a debate could influence it,\u201d said Aaron Kall, director of debate at the University of Michigan, who has conducted an in-depth study of every presidential debate. \u201cA lot of times these mistakes reaffirm a caricature of one of the particular candidates that existed before it happened.\u201d For Biden, that means no senior moments, and Trump would be advised to avoid outbursts that confirm Biden\u2019s characterization of a tyrant in waiting. Neither Trump nor Biden has debated since their final clash in the pandemic-disrupted 2020 campaign. And their preparation for one of the most important nights of their lives has reflected their character and political personas. The president has been out of sight for days, huddled below the oaks, poplars and maple trees at the Camp David retreat with advisers, strategizing how to handle the most challenging debate foe in history. Fueled by lasagna and tacos, he\u2019s taken part in mock debates, immersed himself in briefing binders and tried to anticipate Trump\u2019s wild twists and diversions. It\u2019s a debate camp in keeping with Biden\u2019s view that he\u2019s locked in an existential election duel with the soul of the nation on the line. The former president hates mock debates and has instead honed his preparation at rallies and events, trusting his instincts and intuition and a feral sense of an opponent\u2019s political weakness. He has, however, had policy refresher sessions with aides and some potential vice-presidential picks including Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio. Biden has raised the stakes for himself heading into the debate higher than those any modern president faced. He argues Trump is a criminal in whom something has \u201csnapped\u201d and who is too dangerous and reckless to be let back into the White House. He\u2019s also rebuked Trump for using Nazi-style language and warned democracy and freedom are on the ballot along with the capacity of \u2018We the People\u2019 to shape America\u2019s destiny. Preparing for anything at Camp David Biden\u2019s debate team is led by former White House chief of staff Ron Klain, who has been prepping Democrats for presidential debates for a generation. One of Klain\u2019s mantras is \u201cwhile you can lose a debate any time, you can only win it in the first 30 minutes.\u201d Biden is therefore expected to front-load the most important points to appeal to the likely highest rated part of the primetime event. The Biden team has been poring over Trump\u2019s recent public interviews and speeches while workshopping responses to whatever he and the moderators may throw Biden\u2019s way. The president will be ready for whichever version of Trump shows up \u2013 whether it\u2019s the bombastic opponent who talked over and insulted him in their first clash in 2020, or a more restrained challenger seeking to project stability. If Trump aims for a presidential bearing, Biden has a locker full of practiced attacks and rebuttals designed to provoke him into making the outbursts that could turn voters off. A Biden adviser told CNN that debate preparations have included getting the president ready to respond should Trump get personal\u00a0 \u2014 weeks after his son Hunter was convicted of felony gun charges. Biden\u2019s love and protective instinct for his family is always close to the surface, and he reacted furiously when the then-president brought up Hunter during their first debate in 2020. Biden has been running through his paces inside a large hangar at the Maryland retreat, where there\u2019s a mock debate stage complete with bright television lights. His personal attorney, Bob Bauer, is playing Trump and other aides have sat in as CNN moderators Dana Bash and Jake Tapper. But sources told CNN that the debate practice was about more than feeling comfortable. It\u2019s also about answering the age question. Aides and allies of the president alike have frequently pointed to his State of the Union address in March as a model example of Biden at his best. He was energetic, focused and nimble, they\u2019ve argued, over the course of his 67-minute prime-time speech. Trump\u2019s debate prep is as unorthodox as he is Sitting presidents often have a rude awakening at first presidential debates, since they are unused to anyone getting in their grill and contradicting them. But Trump\u2019s advantage on this score may be compromised since he refused to debate any of his GOP primary rivals this year. Still, his aggressive debate style isn\u2019t much different from the belligerent, spiky attitude he displays in most public events. Trump has warmed up for the debate by suggesting that Biden will be \u201cjacked up\u201d on drugs, as his aides frantically have tried to dismantle the expectations trap that the ex-president constructed for himself by suggesting that Biden is so mentally diminished that he can barely stand up or finish a sentence. In any other era, the idea of a candidate accusing an opponent of doping would be unthinkable. But Trump\u2019s tactic is a reminder of a presidency and a political style that has shattered all previous norms. In a new memo on Wednesday, Trump\u2019s campaign signaled that the ex-president would assail Biden over immigration and the economy. It boasted about polling averages that his team says show the former president up in all the key states. And Trump, whose administration created a gale of daily falsehoods, characteristically worked to accuse Biden of the very transgression that is most associated with him \u2014 lying. \u201cThe man is a walking lying machine and a fact-checker\u2019s dream,\u201d Trump wrote on Truth Social, while accusing Biden, one of the best presidential golfers, of being unable to hit a ball 10 yards. Trump\u2019s unorthodox approach means that the country may get another reminder of the chaos, discord and cacophony that it experienced in his four years in office \u2014 and that his supporters love and want to restore. But it\u2019s also a risk that could play into Biden\u2019s desire to get voters to see the contrast between the 45th and 46th presidents that he believes could deliver him the election. Former Obama speechwriter Terry Szuplat said successful debate performances tell a coherent story of where the country is and where it is going. \u201cIt\u2019s a story about yourself. Why you\u2019re the right candidate. Why the other candidate is the wrong candidate.\u00a0And it\u2019s a story about the future. Every election is about the future. It\u2019s a choice about the future,\u201d Szuplat told CNN\u2019s Kasie Hunt. Neither Trump nor Biden has so far fulfilled that goal. Thursday is the best chance to do so.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/27/politics/presidential-debate-trump-biden/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/30/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_28_politics_harris-rushes-to-bidens-defense", "text": "Vice President Kamala Harris knew she had to go to bat for President Joe Biden as devastating reviews of the president\u2019s debate performance rolled in late Thursday night, aiming to strike a balance between sounding reasonable about the president\u2019s performance while also hammering home the contrast between the two candidates, two sources told CNN. Moments after the debate, Harris joined an organizing call, checked in with campaign officials on a brief call and then participated in previously scheduled interviews. And on Friday, Harris\u2019 staff made phone calls to check in with Democratic officials, trying to reassure them,\u00a0reminding\u00a0them of Biden\u2019s record and agenda, and\u00a0calling on them to remain united, according to another source. Harris took that argument to Las Vegas on Friday \u2013 marking\u00a0her fifth visit to the state this year \u2013 during a campaign event focused on Latino voters. \u201cThere are three things that were true yesterday before the debate that are still true today. Let\u2019s level set on this. First, the stakes of this race could not be higher. Second, the contrast in this election could not be more stark. And third, we believe in our President Joe Biden, and we believe in what he stands for,\u201d she said. \u201cThis race will not be decided by one night in June,\u201d she added. Biden\u2019s lackluster debate performance carries real consequences for Harris \u2013 both as someone riding on his ticket and as someone who hasn\u2019t generally been floated as the heir apparent amid panic among Democrats. Heading into her Thursday night interviews, one of those sources said, Harris was focused on pointing out falsehoods spewed by Trump, while also nodding to the debate getting off to a slow start. But one line stood out to allies and sources close to the vice president: \u201cI\u2019m not going to spend all night with you talking about the last 90 minutes when I\u2019ve been watching the last three-and-a-half years of performance,\u201d she told CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper. The two sources told CNN that the vice president came up with the line spontaneously over the course of the interview \u2013 and one cited it as an example of why people close to her have repeatedly said she\u2019s best skilled to prosecute the case in this election cycle. \u201cHer mood going in was clear-eyed about her job last night,\u201d one of those sources said, pointing to her statement that Biden shouldn\u2019t be judged by one debate performance. \u201cWhen she\u2019s prosecuting a case, there are fewer tougher and (more) clear-eyed about what she\u2019s got to do,\u201d the source added. Biden aides were pleased by Harris\u2019 performance in a round robin of television interviews Thursday night after the debate. Staff watching from the campaign\u2019s Wilmington headquarters audibly cheered Harris on. The first years of her tenure as vice president were marked by tough assignments that proved thankless \u2013 taking the lead in diplomacy with Central American nations to try to stem migration to the southern border and taking the lead on voting rights legislation that was dead on arrival on Capitol Hill \u2013 along with some high-profile stumbles.\u00a0CNN has previously reported\u00a0that Harris had made her unhappiness with some of her assignments known within the White House. But now Harris is embracing her role as a key voice on the campaign trail, especially on issues like reproductive rights, a major theme for the Biden campaign as it hones its message ahead of November, among other defining issues. She\u2019s also bringing the message to the campaign trail with a revamped energy that has been on full display in recent speeches. Harris will continue her campaign travel blitz Friday, participating in a fundraising\u00a0event in\u00a0Park City, Utah, and a political outreach meeting with Black supporters in Los Angeles.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/28/politics/harris-rushes-to-bidens-defense/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/30/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_11_politics_gender-gap-2024-election-analysis", "text": "Democrats are facing the threat of a gender gap that could imperil the traditional advantage among younger voters that the party has enjoyed for decades and that President Joe Biden likely needs to defeat former President Donald Trump. While Democrats are counting on a big backlash among younger women against the rollback of abortion rights to help propel Biden, a backlash among younger men against changing gender roles could help lift Trump. Both younger men and women are broadly discontented with the economy and Biden\u2019s job performance, polls show. But the anger and frustration over the 2022 Supreme Court decision overturning the federal right to abortion provides Biden a powerful tool to expand his support among young women unhappy with him on other fronts, strategists in both parties agree. For many younger women, pollsters say, the loss of abortion rights has become not only a threat in itself, but a symbol of a broader attempt to reverse women\u2019s gains in economic status and pressure them back into more traditional gender roles. Meanwhile, Biden faces a dual challenge with younger men: Not only is abortion less of a motivating issue for them, but there\u2019s evidence that many of them are receptive to the messaging of Trump\u2019s \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d movement, with its implicit promise to restore traditional racial and gender hierarchies. In a striking new Pew Research Center national survey, for instance, fully two-fifths of the men younger than 50 who are supporting Trump agreed that women\u2019s gains in society have come at the expense of men. That was not only more than double the share of younger Biden-supporting men who agreed with that sentiment, but considerably larger even than the share of older Trump-supporting men who agreed. All this suggests that while cultural attitudes may help Biden overcome economic discontent among younger women, an amorphous but insistent sense of cultural marginalization may reinforce Trump\u2019s economic inroads among younger men. Researchers say democracies across the Western world are experiencing a widening partisan and ideological gap between younger men and women. In a much discussed article earlier this year, Financial Times columnist John Burn-Murdoch pointed to survey data in a variety of countries showing that young men were far more likely to identify as conservative than young women. \u201cIn countries on every continent, an ideological gap has opened up between young men and women,\u201d he wrote. That gap has widened in the US, too, though the evidence shows that it is growing more because young women are ideologically moving to the left than because young men are moving to the right. Merged annual results from NBC polls conducted by a bipartisan team of Democratic and Republican pollsters document the trends. In 2013, the share of young men aged 18-29 who called themselves conservative very slightly exceeded the share who identified as liberal, while the reverse was true for young women, according to results provided by Public Opinion Strategies, the GOP half of the partnership that conducts the NBC poll. For each gender, though, the balance between conservatives and liberals was nearly even. In their 2023 results, the pollsters found that young men had shifted slightly left, with slightly more now identifying as liberal than conservative. But, over that same 10-year period, young women had sped leftward: In the 2023 results, three times as many of them identified as liberal than as conservative. In 2013, the share of self-identified liberals among young women exceeded the share among young men by 5 percentage points; by 2023, that gap was nearly four times as large. These shifts over time have produced a situation where younger men are still more liberal than older men on most issues, but not nearly as liberal as younger women. The annual youth poll conducted by the Institute of Politics at Harvard University\u2019s John F. Kennedy school offers perhaps the best snapshot on the gender divergence among younger adults. In this year\u2019s survey, young men were 15 points more likely than young women to support building Trump\u2019s border wall, 12 points more likely to say same-sex relationships are morally wrong and 11 points more likely to say Israel\u2019s response to Hamas in Gaza has been justified. Still, in each case, only a minority of younger men endorsed those conservative viewpoints. But while younger men have moved only modestly to the right on most public policy issues, they have more clearly shifted in their willingness to identify with the Republican Party. The latest annual Harvard youth survey found that among young men, Democrats now only have a 3-percentage point advantage in party identification, down from 22 points as recently as 2020. Among women, the Democratic identification edge over that same period grew from 20 to 26 percentage points. (The NBC surveys likewise found the Democratic advantage narrowing among younger men and widening among younger women over recent years, though the changes were not as dramatic as in the Harvard poll.) \u201cThere is not a ton of evidence that young men are more likely to identify as conservatives, but there does seem to be a growing affinity for Republican identity,\u201d said Daniel Cox, director of the Survey Center on American\u00a0Life at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. That growing receptivity to the GOP could contribute to a wider gender gap among young people than in recent elections. The latest Harvard poll showed that among likely younger voters, Biden led Trump by about 2-to-1 among women, almost exactly his advantage in the Harvard Poll at this point in 2020. But among likely male voters, the survey found that Biden led Trump by just 6 points, a precipitous, and perilous, decline from his 26-point advantage in the 2020 survey at this point. Other respected sources on voting results in 2020, such as the exit polls, found that Biden didn\u2019t win young men that year by as much as Harvard projected, which would mean his decline now is less severe. Still, pollsters in both parties say their own data track the same movement the Harvard poll identifies, with Biden largely holding his lead from 2020 among younger women, but slipping among younger men, including not only White but Black and Latino younger men. The good news for Biden is that younger women turned out at much higher rates than younger men in 2020; in fact, the gap between female and male turnout that year was wider for younger adults than in any other age group, according to analysis of Census Bureau data by William Frey, a demographer at the Brookings Metro thinktank. But Biden has so little margin for error in the battleground states that the level of erosion among younger men that he\u2019s experiencing in polls still poses a grave threat to his reelection. In explaining the growing youth gender gap, analysts point to several factors. One is diverging priorities between young men and women. Even more young women in the Harvard youth poll expressed negative views about Biden\u2019s economic record than young men did, but the women were far more likely than the men to cite abortion as a key factor in their vote. \u201cThe difference is young women are voting more on culture and rights, such as abortion, and young men are probably going to be more compelled to vote on economic reasons,\u201d said Melissa Deckman, CEO of the non-partisan Public Religion Research Institute and author of the forthcoming book, \u201cThe Politics of Gen Z: How the Youngest Voters Will Shape our Democracy.\u201d As with all generations, Trump\u2019s belligerent style also contributes to the widening gender divide. \u201cYounger men admire the strength of Trump, but what younger men think is strong, women think is chaotic, crazy and divisive,\u201d said Democratic pollster Celinda Lake, who polled for Biden\u2019s 2020 campaign. Trump also has a significant tactical advantage in that he tends to be portrayed much more positively than Biden on the YouTube channels, podcasts, Reddit threads and TikTok videos that constitute the principal source of information for many young men, noted John Della Volpe, who directs the Harvard youth poll. (In that survey, young men were substantially more likely than young women to say they rely on YouTube as a major source of news.) \u201cThe media ecosystem specifically among young men is [a place] where Joe Biden doesn\u2019t get a break and Trump is stood up as an anti-hero,\u201d said Della Volpe, who is advising a newly formed super PAC trying to boost Biden among young people. Trump has leaned into that advantage by identifying with entertainment that disproportionately draws younger men, like the Ultimate Fighting Championship match he attended as his first public event following his felony conviction in New York. Trump may also be drawing from deeper wells of changing social attitudes. Last week\u2019s Pew finding that two-fifths of younger males backing Trump believe women\u2019s gains have come at men\u2019s expense is only one of many recent poll results suggesting more young men are bristling against the rising demands for gender and racial equity. The new Pew poll, for instance, also found that more than four-fifths of the younger men supporting Trump asserted that all the obstacles blocking women\u2019s advancement in society have been eliminated \u2014 more than double the share of Biden-supporting younger men who agreed. (In this case, older men backing Trump were as likely to endorse that statement as younger ones.) Nearly two-thirds of the younger men supporting Trump also agreed in the poll that \u201csociety is better off if people make marriage and having children a priority\u201d \u2014 equal to the share of older Trump men and more than triple the share of younger Biden men. In an AEI poll this spring, the share of all young men who say efforts to promote gender equity have gone too far reached about 1-in-5, more than double the level in 2017. Survey evidence also shows resistance, particularly among younger White men, to the growing demands from minority groups for more racial equity in education, employment and other settings. In that same AEI poll, over three-fifths of young White women said their race has made their life easier, but far fewer young White men said the same (only about 2-in-5). Conversely, in this year\u2019s Harvard poll, nearly three-fifths of men (of all races) agreed that society is placing too much emphasis on racial identity; only about two-fifths of young women agreed. Exactly three-fourths of younger men supporting Trump in the Pew poll rejected the idea that Whites benefit from advantages in society unavailable to Blacks. This backlash against a changing society only extends so far: Though the \u201ctradwife\u201d movement in social media celebrates women reverting to roles as homemakers and mothers, in the Harvard Poll only about 1-in-6 younger men (and 1-in-10 younger women) agreed that women should prioritize having children over entering the workforce. Deckman noted that compared to older generations, young men today\u00a0\u201chave been raised by their mothers and aunts and grandmothers, who have gone on to hold jobs and be professionals and they are used to seeing women as leaders.\u201d But if young men aren\u2019t moving back to 1950s expectations in large numbers, the surveys showing male unease with women\u2019s increasing independence and authority make clear that something is stirring. \u201cLooking across different surveys and different questions, we can debate about the degree to which it is changing, but there is no doubt we are seeing movement,\u201d said Cox of the AEI. This pushback among young men comes after activism around racial and gender equality in the past few years reached its highest level since the late 1960s and early 1970s, with the rise of the #MeToo and Black Lives Matter movements and more forceful advocacy in LGBTQ communities. (In the Harvard poll, one-fourth of young women identified in some way as LGBTQ, more than double the share of young men.) It also comes amid continuing evidence that women are navigating the transition to an information-based economy better than men: Women now account for about 60% of all four-year college graduates and nearly 65% of graduate degrees, according to the latest federal statistics. In her upcoming book, Deckman sees the #MeToo movement as the galvanizing force initially propelling more Gen Z women toward liberal activism. That first impulse, she said, has been reinforced by Trump\u2019s 2016 electoral success, despite his extensive history of misogynistic statements and behavior. The sharp turn right on social issues in red states, punctuated by the Supreme Court\u2019s 2022 Dobbs decision overturning the nationwide right to abortion, has provided another spur to activism. Anna Dean, co-founder and co-CEO of the group LOUDwomen, is one of the young female activists Deckman profiles in her book. Dean, now a rising senior at Harvard, helped to start the group in high school in Bentonville, Arkansas, when she noticed that young women and racial minorities were dropping out of school debate activity after biased treatment by the judges. When Trump was elected, she said, the young women felt the same sexist or racist behavior they were fighting in their schools was \u201creflected on the news when we hear Donald Trump speak.\u201d The Dobbs decision, she said, underlined the sense among the young women that their rights were eroding, even as many of them had reached educational milestones unmatched for older women in their families. When relatives or acquaintances tell Dean she is living the \u201cwildest dreams\u201d of earlier generations of women by attending Harvard, she said she often thinks: \u201cOK, yeah this is awesome but at the same time I don\u2019t have the same rights you did when you were my age. I am doing things my ancestors could have only dreamed of, but at the same time I don\u2019t have the same health care rights.\u201d Della Volpe says that from his research and focus groups, he believes that younger men are not so much hostile to the movements demanding more rights for women or LGBTQ people as wondering where that leaves them. \u201cI have empathy for them because in large measure they are just trying to figure life out,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd they sense and feel, sometimes accurately, sometimes inaccurately, that while they are trying to figure life out that they are being judged by people \u2014 that they are projected to be inferior or bad or ignorant, or worse, racist or homophobic. I think that\u2019s a big part of this.\u201d Such anxieties and grievances about social change have always provided the waters that Trump fishes in. The ability to identify the currents of discontent about change \u2014 cultural, racial or economic \u2014 in each group that he is targeting may be Trump\u2019s greatest skill as a politician. Just as the former president has powerfully appealed to White voters who feel marginalized in a more racially diverse America, or to blue-collar factory towns that feel left behind by the transition to a metro-based information economy, he\u2019s also showing a magnetic pull for the men who feel eclipsed by women\u2019s growing prominence in the workplace and society. Most younger men don\u2019t necessarily hold favorable views about Trump personally, noted Cox, but many are receptive to his broad message that elites in modern US society are discriminating against him and his followers. \u201cThat grievance is what binds them [to him] when very little else does,\u201d Cox said. By contrast, said Deckman, for younger women who believe opportunity and power in US society are still too much tilted toward men, \u201cDonald Trump is the embodiment of many of the things they are opposed to. \u2026 They are sick of old White guys running everything.\u201d That sentiment doesn\u2019t easily translate into enthusiasm for Biden, the other \u201cold White guy\u201d\u00a0in the race. Dean said that despite the distaste for Trump, even young women in her activist circles are more likely to talk about their frustrations with the current president than their fears of the prior one. Given the risk that Biden won\u2019t match his 2020 performance with young men, he has an urgent need to rekindle that flagging enthusiasm among young women. \u201cHe\u2019s got to make up for the defection of young men by winning young women by more, and he\u2019s got to get every young woman he can out to vote,\u201d said Lake, the Democratic pollster. Biden\u2019s best hope of avoiding a catastrophic decline in his youth support is that the number of young women Trump repels exceeds the number of young men he attracts.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/11/politics/gender-gap-2024-election-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/30/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_28_politics_election-biden-presidential-race-what-matters", "text": "Joe Biden\u2019s spotty debate performance immediately triggered new questions from worried Democrats about whether he would leave the presidential race. It would not be an easy process since Biden is already the Democrats\u2019 presumptive nominee and the overwhelming choice of primary voters. He faced little opposition during the primary season, and the fact that he won nearly all of the party\u2019s delegates means it\u2019s very unlikely he\u2019d be forced out of the race against his will. \u201cThis isn\u2019t the \u201960s. Voters choose the nominee. He is the nominee,\u201d said CNN analyst and Democratic strategist David Axelrod, reacting to Biden\u2019s performance at the debate Thursday night on CNN. That current primary system, which empowers primary voters over party bigwigs, essentially sprang from discontent after Democrats selected Vice President Hubert Humphrey as their nominee in 1968. Even after President Lyndon Johnson bowed out of the presidential race that year, recognizing his fading popularity and opposition to the war in Vietnam, Humphrey represented a continuation of Johnson\u2019s Vietnam policy at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago. Violence broke out when protesters clashed with police as Humphrey accepted the nomination. Things would be very different in 2024 if Biden decided to leave the race, although Democrats\u2019 convention will return to Chicago in August. As we\u00a0first wrote\u00a0back in February,\u00a0if the leading candidate was to drop out of the campaign after most primaries or even during the convention, individual delegates would need to select the party\u2019s nominee on the convention floor (or, potentially, during a\u00a0virtual roll call). That would shine a spotlight on the normally niche question of who those actual delegates are. The Democratic Party set a deadline of June 22 for states to select the more than 3,900 delegates \u2013\u00a0almost all of them currently pledged to Biden \u2013 allocated as part of the primary process. These delegates aren\u2019t just pledged to vote for Biden; they\u2019re also approved by his campaign. So while a majority of convention delegates could\u00a0decide to pick a new nominee, doing so would require massive defections from the president\u2019s own supporters. It also means that if Biden dropped out of the race, it would largely be Biden backers who would be responsible for picking his replacement. Who could replace Biden? You can assume, for instance, that Vice President Kamala Harris would be a top contender to be on the ballot in such a scenario. But there would be other potential candidates who previously argued they could run a more effective campaign against former President Donald Trump. Would someone like California Gov. Gavin Newsom \u2013\u00a0who offered unqualified support for Biden in the wake of Thursday\u2019s debate \u2013\u00a0challenge Harris at the convention? Settling on a replacement could be divisive and ugly. It would be up to the delegates to decide, in a series of votes after frantic lobbying, who to pick. On the Democratic side, there is also another group to consider: the\u00a0\u201csuperdelegates,\u201d\u00a0a group of about 700 senior party leaders and elected officials who are automatically delegates to the convention based on their position. Under normal party rules, they can\u2019t vote on the first ballot if they could swing the nomination, but they\u2019re free to vote on subsequent ballots. What if a candidate left the race after the convention? It would take a drastic event for a candidate to leave the race in the few months between a party\u2019s nominating convention in the summer and the general election in November. Democrats and Republicans have slightly different methods of dealing with this possibility. You can imagine the end result would probably be that the running mate stepped up to be on the general election ballot, but that is not necessarily guaranteed. Democrats \u2013\u00a0The Democratic National Committee is empowered to fill a vacancy on the national ticket after the convention under party rules, after the party chair consults with Democratic governors and congressional leadership. Republicans \u2013\u00a0If a vacancy occurs on the Republican side, the Republican National Committee can either reconvene the national convention or select a new candidate itself. Would the running mate automatically become the nominee? An in-depth\u00a0Congressional Research Service\u00a0memo also notes that if an incumbent president becomes incapacitated after winning the party\u2019s nomination, the 25th Amendment would elevate the vice president to the presidency, but party rules would determine who rises to become the party\u2019s nominee. Neither party, according to the CRS, requires that the presidential candidate\u2019s running mate be elevated to the top of the ticket, though that would obviously be the most likely scenario. Has a candidate ever left the race after the convention? In modern times, per the CRS, the Democrat running for vice president in 1972, Sen.\u00a0Thomas Eagleton, was forced to step aside after the convention after it was discovered that he was treated for mental illness. (1972 was a very different time! Today, thankfully, there is not nearly the stigma attached to mental health.) The DNC actually needed to convene a meeting to affirm Sargent Shriver as Democratic nominee George McGovern\u2019s second-choice running mate. What if a president-elect was incapacitated after the election? If a president-elect was to die, timing is again important. Under the Constitution, it is electors meeting in state capitols who technically cast votes for the presidency. While some states require that they vote for the winner of the election in their state, in others they have leeway. The CRS memo, which cites several congressional hearings on the subject, suggests it would clearly make sense for a vice president-elect to simply assume the role of president-elect, but the law itself is murky. Under the 20th Amendment, if a president-elect dies, his or her running mate, the vice president-elect, becomes president. There could be some question, for instance, about when exactly a person becomes president-elect. Is it after the electors meet in December, or after Congress meets to count Electoral College votes on January 6?", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/28/politics/election-biden-presidential-race-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/30/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_28_politics_takeaways-supreme-court-january-6-obstruction-charges-donald-trump", "text": "The Supreme Court on Friday limited the power of prosecutors to pursue obstruction charges against those who rioted at the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, narrowing a law that could have tacked years onto the sentences of hundreds of defendants. The decision had implications for former President Donald Trump, who was charged with the same crime \u2013 though that impact appeared to be more limited than some initially predicted. Two Trump nominees \u2013 Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh \u2013 joined the majority. At issue was a law passed in the wake of the Enron scandal in 2001 that bars people from obstructing an official proceeding. The Biden administration argued that the counting of electoral votes in Congress that was interrupted by a mob of Trump supporters counted. But the Supreme Court\u2019s 6-3 decision narrowed the scope of the law, potentially forcing a reopening of the cases against at least some of the rioters. Here are some key takeaways from the decision. Charges against Trump not likely affected The people who pushed their way into the Capitol aren\u2019t the only ones who are facing the obstruction charge. Special counsel Jack Smith also charged former President Donald Trump with the same crime. But even before the court\u2019s decision was handed down, Smith made clear that the charge was based on different circumstances in Trump\u2019s case. Those charges were based on Trump\u2019s attempt to organize and send a slate of fake electors to Congress \u2013 actions that look a lot more like the evidence tampering that was targeted by the obstruction law. Smith has argued in court filings that the charge against Trump should survive even if the court ruled the way it did, pointing particularly to the indictment\u2019s allegations about the fraudulent electors plot. The Supreme Court\u2019s opinion did not address the fake electors scheme specifically. But Chief Justice John Roberts, writing for the majority, nodded to the possibility that the obstruction statute would be violated \u201cby creating false evidence \u2013 rather than altering incriminating evidence.\u201d That line could prove to be a significant problem for Trump. Trump celebrates anyway and looks to immunity ruling Politically, though, the former president \u2013 who has frequently sought to undercut the criminal justice system \u2013 appeared eager to frame the decision as a major loss for the Justice Department. Trump took to social media to describe the decision as a \u201cBIG WIN!\u201d But even within Trump world there was a recognition that the impact may be limited for the former president. The likely best-case scenario, an adviser to Trump\u2019s legal team told CNN, is that the new ruling weakens the obstruction charges against Trump, rather than prompting the charge to be dismissed. That narrowing might not even happen until appeal, the adviser said, adding that they did not expect the new ruling to delay the trial proceedings the way the pending immunity dispute could. Still, Trump\u2019s legal team expects to file motions based the decision in an attempt to get obstruction counts against the former president dismissed, according to a source familiar with the matter. While legal experts say they are unlikely to be successful, the source says the team will still exercise that option on behalf of the client. At the very least, those attempts could further delay a possible trial in the case, which is already at risk of not happening before the November election. What is far more important for Trump is the Supreme Court\u2019s pending decision on immunity. Trump has argued for sweeping immunity for his efforts to overturn the 2020 election. That decision is expected to land Monday. Hundreds of other charges are pending The opinion gives the Justice Department room to refile cases against at least some rioters accused of obstruction, because it will continue to allow them to prosecute in situations in which people attempted to impact \u201cdocuments\u201d and \u201cother things\u201d used in an official proceeding. Approximately 249 cases involving the obstruction charge are pending \u2013 and in every one of those cases, the defendant faces other charges, including felonies and misdemeanors. About 52 people were convicted and sentenced with the obstruction charge as their only felony. Of those, 27 people are currently incarcerated, according to prosecutors.  The Justice Department has taken steps for months in its prosecutions of rioters to shore up the obstruction charges. That includes showing evidence to juries of the electoral vote boxes being removed from the Senate floor. That could help prosecutors sustain the charges by establishing that some of the defendants had as their goal an attempt to tamper with the records. In a statement after the opinion was released, Attorney General Merrick Garland said he was \u201cdisappointed\u201d because the ruling limited a law intended \u201cto ensure that those most responsible for that attack face appropriate consequences.\u201d But Garland also maintained that the number of people whose sentences could be significantly reduced is likely relatively small. Still, rioters who are serving time or awaiting trial are likely to go back to a trial court to seek review. At least one federal judge in DC on Friday said she would be re-sentencing rioters convicted of obstruction, according to court records. Jackson joins with the court\u2019s conservatives, Barrett with the liberals The Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Fischer v. US was 6-3, but the vote didn\u2019t break entirely along traditional ideological lines \u2013 with Republican-appointed justices in the majority and the Democratic-nominated wing of the court in the minority. Instead, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson sided with Roberts, while Justice Amy Coney Barrett wrote an opinion joined by two liberals. That 2002 law makes it a felony to \u201ccorruptly\u201d alter, destroy or mutilate a record with the intent of making it unavailable for use in an \u201cofficial proceeding,\u201d or to \u201cotherwise\u201d obstruct, influence, or impede such a proceeding. Fischer had argued that, taken together, the law was passed in response to the Enron scandal and was limited to manipulating evidence, not storming a government building. The charge can add a maximum of 20 years onto a sentence. Jackson embraced that argument in her solo concurrence. \u201cNotwithstanding the shocking circumstances involved this case,\u201d she wrote, the court\u2019s role was to interpret the law. \u201cThere is no indication whatsoever that Congress intended to create a sweeping, all-purpose obstruction statute,\u201d Jackson wrote. Barrett, a Trump nominee, fired back at that reading. Why did the majority side with Fischer, she asked rhetorically? \u201cBecause it simply cannot believe that Congress meant what it said,\u201d she wrote. Chief\u2019s opinion breezes over Capitol attack Roberts largely avoided discussion of the traumatic and deadly events of January 6, 2021, in his 16-page opinion \u2013 just as the court did when it hear arguments in the case in April. Instead, the decision turned largely on a technical and legalistic debate over the meaning of the words in the law \u2013 and, in particular, the word \u201cotherwise.\u201d The chief justice devoted just a few lines to explaining some of the facts behind the attack that took place within view of the Supreme Court. Roberts wrote that the breach \u201cof the Capitol caused members of Congress to evacuate the chambers and delayed the certification process.\u201d And he noted that the defendant who filed the appeal, a former Pennsylvania police officer named Joseph Fischer, \u201cwas involved in a physical confrontation with law enforcement.\u201d The meager discussion of the attack itself was clearly an effort to steer clear of what has become a highly charged political fight over the attack, with some Republicans \u2013 including Trump \u2013 attempting to explain away what happened that day. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, a former defense attorney and US District judge who presided over early cases involving the attack, joined the majority. But in a concurrence, the liberal justice discussed the attack in stark terms. \u201cOn January 6, 2021, an angry mob stormed the United States Capitol seeking to prevent Congress from fulfilling its constitutional duty to certify the electoral votes in the 2020 presidential election,\u201d she wrote in the opening lines of her opinion. \u201cThe peaceful transfer of power is a fundamental democratic norm, and those who attempted to disrupt it in this way inflicted a deep wound on this nation. \u201cBut today\u2019s case is not about the immorality of those acts,\u201d she said. The three dissenting justices also kept their references to the riot at a minimum. Justice Amy Coney Barrett, writing for herself and two members of the court\u2019s liberal wing, said Fischer \u201callegedly participated in a riot at the Capitol that forced the delay of Congress\u2019s joint session on January 6th.\u201d \u201cBlocking an official proceeding from moving forward surely qualifies as obstructing or impeding the proceeding by means other than document destruction,\u201d Barrett wrote.

TAPPER: \u00a0Now please welcome the 46th president of the United States, Joe Biden. JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:\u00a0How are you?\u00a0Good to be here. Thank you. TAPPER: \u00a0And please welcome the 45th president of the United States, Donald Trump. Gentlemen, thanks so much for being here. Let\u2019s begin the debate. And let\u2019s start with the issue that voters consistently say is their top concern, the economy. President Biden, inflation has slowed, but prices remain high. Since you took office, the price of essentials has increased. For example, a basket of groceries that cost $100 then, now costs more than $12; and typical home prices have jumped more than 30 percent. What do you say to voters who feel they are worse off under your presidency than they were under President Trump? BIDEN: \u00a0You have to take a look at what I was left when I became president, what Mr. Trump left me. We had an economy that was in freefall. The pandemic are so badly handled, many people were dying. All he said was, it\u2019s not that serious. Just inject a little bleach in your arm. It\u2019d be all right. The economy collapsed. There were no jobs. Unemployment rate rose to 15 percent. It was terrible. And so, what we had to do is try to put things back together again. That\u2019s exactly what we began to do. We created 15,000 new jobs. We brought on \u2013 in a position where we have 800,000 new manufacturing jobs. But there\u2019s more to be done. There\u2019s more to be done. Working class people are still in trouble. I come from Scranton, Pennsylvania. I come from a household where the kitchen table \u2013 if things weren\u2019t able to be met during the month was a problem. Price of eggs, the price of gas, the price of housing, the price of a whole range of things. That\u2019s why I\u2019m working so hard to make sure I deal with those problems. And we\u2019re going to make sure that we reduce the price of housing. We\u2019re going to make sure we build 2 million new units. We\u2019re going to make sure we cap rents, so corporate greed can\u2019t take over. The combination of what I was left and then corporate greed are the reason why we\u2019re in this problem right now. In addition to that, we\u2019re in a situation where if you had \u2013 take a look at all that was done in his administration, he didn\u2019t do much at all. By the time he left, there\u2019s \u2013 things had been in chaos. There was (ph) literally chaos. And so, we put things back together. We created, as I said, those (ph) jobs. We made sure we had a situation where we now \u2013 we brought down the price of prescription drugs, which is a major issue for many people, to $15 for \u2013 for an insulin shot, as opposed to $400. No senior has to pay more than $200 for any drug \u2013 all the drugs they (inaudible) beginning next year. And the situation is making \u2013 and we\u2019re going to make that available to everybody, to all Americans. So we\u2019re working to bring down the prices around the kitchen table. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to get done. TAPPER: \u00a0Thank you. President Trump? DONALD TRUMP, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES AND CURRENT U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:\u00a0We had the greatest economy in the history of our country. We had never done so well. Every \u2013 everybody was amazed by it. Other countries were copying us. We got hit with COVID. And when we did, we spent the money necessary so we wouldn\u2019t end up in a Great Depression the likes of which we had in 1929. By the time we finished \u2013 so we did a great job. We got a lot of credit for the economy, a lot of credit for the military, and no wars and so many other things. Everything was rocking good. But the thing we never got the credit for, and we should have, is getting us out of that COVID mess. He created mandates; that was a disaster for our country. But other than that, we had \u2013 we had given them back a \u2013 a country where the stock market actually was higher than pre-COVID, and nobody thought that was even possible. The only jobs he created are for illegal immigrants and bounceback jobs; they\u2019re bounced back from the COVID. He has not done a good job. He\u2019s done a poor job. And inflation\u2019s killing our country. It is absolutely killing us. TAPPER: \u00a0Thank you. President Biden? BIDEN: \u00a0Well, look, the greatest economy in the world, he\u2019s the only one who thinks that, I think. I don\u2019t know anybody else who thinks it was great \u2013 he had the greatest economy in the world. And, you know, the fact of the matter is that we found ourselves in a situation where his economy \u2013 he rewarded the wealthy. He had the largest tax cut in American history, $2 trillion. He raised the deficit larger than any president has in any one term. He\u2019s the only president other than Herbert Hoover who has lost more jobs than he had when he began, since Herbert Hoover. The idea that he did something that was significant. And the military \u2013 you know, when he was president, they were still killing people in Afghanistan. He didn\u2019t do anything about that. When he was president, we still found ourselves in a position where you had a notion that we were this safe country. The truth is, I\u2019m the only president this century that doesn\u2019t have any \u2013 this \u2013 this decade \u2013 doesn\u2019t have any troops dying anywhere in the world, like he did. TAPPER: \u00a0President Trump, I want to follow up, if I can. You wanted\u2026 TRUMP: \u00a0Am I allowed to respond to him? TAPPER: \u00a0Well, I\u2019m going to ask you a follow-up. You can do whatever you want with the minute that we give you. I want to follow up. You want to impose a 10 percent tariff on all goods coming into the U.S. How will you ensure that that doesn\u2019t drive prices even higher? TRUMP: \u00a0Not going to drive them higher. It\u2019s just going to cause countries that have been ripping us off for years, like China and many others, in all fairness to China \u2013 it\u2019s going to just force them to pay us a lot of money, reduce our deficit tremendously, and give us a lot of power for other things. But he \u2013 he made a statement. The only thing he was right about is I gave you the largest tax cut in history. I also gave you the largest regulation cut in history. That\u2019s why we had all the jobs. And the jobs went down and then they bounced back and he\u2019s taking credit for bounceback jobs. You can\u2019t do that. He also said he inherited 9 percent inflation. No, he inherited almost no inflation and it stayed that way for 14 months. And then it blew up under his leadership, because they spent money like a bunch of people that didn\u2019t know what they were doing. And they don\u2019t know what they were doing. It was the worst \u2013 probably the worst administration in history. There\u2019s never been. And as far as Afghanistan is concerned, I was getting out of Afghanistan, but we were getting out with dignity, with strength, with power. He got out, it was the most embarrassing day in the history of our country\u2019s life. TAPPER: \u00a0President Trump, over the last eight years, under both of your administrations, the national debt soared to record highs. And according to a new non-partisan analysis, President Trump, your administration approved $8.4 trillion in new debt. While so far, President Biden, you\u2019ve approved $4.3 trillion in new debt. So former President Trump, many of the tax cuts that you signed into law are set to expire next year. You want to extend them and go even further, you say. With the U.S. facing trillion-dollar deficits and record debt, why should top earners and corporations pay even less in taxes than they do now? TRUMP: \u00a0Because the tax cuts spurred the greatest economy that we\u2019ve ever seen just prior to COVID, and even after COVID. It was so strong that we were able to get through COVID much better than just about any other country. But we spurred \u2013 that tax spurred. Now, when we cut the taxes \u2013 as an example, the corporate tax was cut down to 21 percent from 39 percent, plus beyond that \u2013 we took in more revenue with much less tax and companies were bringing back trillions of dollars back into our country. The country was going like never before. And we were ready to start paying down debt. We were ready to start using the liquid gold right under our feet, the oil and gas right under our feet. We were going to have something that nobody else has had. We got hit with COVID. We did a lot to fix it. I gave him an unbelievable situation, with all of the therapeutics and all of the things that we came up with. We \u2013 we gave him something great. Remember, more people died under his administration, even though we had largely fixed it. More people died under his administration than our administration, and we were right in the middle of it. Something which a lot of people don\u2019t like to talk about, but he had far more people dying in his administration. He did the mandate, which is a disaster. Mandating it. The vaccine went out. He did a mandate on the vaccine, which is the thing that people most objected to about the vaccine. And he did a very poor job, just a very poor job. And I will tell you, not only poor there, but throughout the entire world, we\u2019re no longer respected as a country. They don\u2019t respect our leadership. They don\u2019t respect the United States anymore. We\u2019re like a Third World nation. Between weaponization of his election, trying to go after his political opponent, all of the things he\u2019s done, we\u2019ve become like a Third World nation. And it\u2019s a shame the damage he\u2019s done to our country. And I\u2019d love to ask him, and will, why he allowed millions of people to come in here from prisons, jails and mental institutions to come into our country and destroy our country. TAPPER: \u00a0President Trump, we will get to immigration later in this block. President Biden, I want to give you an opportunity to respond to this question about the national debt. BIDEN: \u00a0He had the largest national debt of any president four-year period, number one. Number two, he got $2 trillion tax cut, benefited the very wealthy. What I\u2019m going to do is fix the taxes. For example, we have a thousand trillionaires in America \u2013 I mean, billionaires in America. And what\u2019s happening? They\u2019re in a situation where they, in fact, pay 8.2 percent in taxes. If they just paid 24 percent or 25 percent, either one of those numbers, they\u2019d raised $500 million \u2013 billion dollars, I should say, in a 10-year period. We\u2019d be able to right \u2013 wipe out his debt. We\u2019d be able to help make sure that \u2013 all those things we need to do, childcare, elder care, making sure that we continue to strengthen our healthcare system, making sure that we\u2019re able to make every single solitary person eligible for what I\u2019ve been able to do with the COVID \u2013 excuse me, with dealing with everything we have to do with. Look, if \u2013 we finally beat Medicare. TAPPER: \u00a0Thank you, President Biden. President Trump? TRUMP: \u00a0Well, he\u2019s right: He did beat Medicaid (ph). He beat it to death. And he\u2019s destroying Medicare, because all of these people are coming in, they\u2019re putting them on Medicare, they\u2019re putting them on Social Security. They\u2019re going to destroy Social Security. This man is going to single-handedly destroy Social Security. These millions and millions of people coming in, they\u2019re trying to put them on Social Security. He will wipe out Social Security. He will wipe out Medicare. So he was right in the way he finished that sentence, and it\u2019s a shame. What\u2019s happened to our country in the last four years is not to be believed. Foreign countries \u2013 I\u2019m friends with a lot of people. They cannot believe what happened to the United States of America. We\u2019re no longer respected. They don\u2019t like us. We give them everything they want, and they \u2013 they think we\u2019re stupid. They think we\u2019re very stupid people. What we\u2019re doing for other countries, and they do nothing for us. What this man has done is absolutely criminal. TAPPER: \u00a0Thank you, President Trump. Dana? BASH: \u00a0This is the first presidential election since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. This morning, the court ruled on yet another abortion case, temporarily allowing emergency abortions to continue in Idaho despite that state\u2019s restrictive ban. Former President Trump, you take credit for the decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, which returned the issue of abortion to the states. TRUMP: \u00a0Correct. BASH: \u00a0However, the federal government still plays a role in whether or not women have access to abortion pills. They\u2019re used in about two-thirds of all abortions. As president, would you block abortion medication? TRUMP: \u00a0First of all, the Supreme Court just approved the abortion pill. And I agree with their decision to have done that, and I will not block it. And if you look at this whole question that you\u2019re asking, a complex, but not really complex \u2013 51 years ago, you had Roe v. Wade, and everybody wanted to get it back to the states, everybody, without exception. Democrats, Republicans, liberals, conservatives, everybody wanted it back. Religious leaders. And what I did is I put three great Supreme Court justices on the court, and they happened to vote in favor of killing Roe v. Wade and moving it back to the states. This is something that everybody wanted. Now, 10 years ago or so, they started talking about how many weeks and how many of this \u2013 getting into other things, But every legal scholar, throughout the world, the most respected, wanted it brought back to the states. I did that. Now the states are working it out. If you look at Ohio, it was a decision that was \u2013 that was an end result that was a little bit more liberal than you would have thought. Kansas I would say the same thing. Texas is different. Florida is different. But they\u2019re all making their own decisions right now. And right now, the states control it. That\u2019s the vote of the people. Like Ronald Reagan, I believe in the exceptions. I am a person that believes. And frankly, I think it\u2019s important to believe in the exceptions. Some people \u2013 you have to follow your heart. Some people don\u2019t believe in that. But I believe in the exceptions for rape, incest and the life of the mother. I think it\u2019s very important. Some people don\u2019t. Follow your heart. But you have to get elected also and \u2013 because that has to do with other things. You got to get elected. The problem they have is they\u2019re radical, because they will take the life of a child in the eighth month, the ninth month, and even after birth \u2013 after birth. If you look at the former governor of Virginia, he was willing to do this. He said, we\u2019ll put the baby aside and we\u2019ll determine what we do with the baby. Meaning, we\u2019ll kill the baby. What happened is we brought it back to the states and the country is now coming together on this issue. It\u2019s been a great thing. BASH: \u00a0Thank you. President Biden? BIDEN: \u00a0It\u2019s been a terrible thing what you\u2019ve done. The fact is that the vast majority of constitutional scholars supported Roe when it was decided, supported Roe. And I was \u2013 that\u2019s \u2013 this idea that they were all against it is just ridiculous. And this is the guy who says the states should be able to have it. We\u2019re in a state where in six weeks you don\u2019t even know whether you\u2019re pregnant or not, but you cannot see a doctor, have your \u2013 and have him decide on what your circumstances are, whether you need help. The idea that states are able to do this is a little like saying, we\u2019re going to turn civil rights back to the states, let each state have a different rule. Look, there\u2019s so many young women who have been \u2013 including a young woman who just was murdered and he went to the funeral. The idea that she was murdered by \u2013 by \u2013 by an immigrant coming in and (inaudible) talk about that. But here\u2019s the deal, there\u2019s a lot of young women who are being raped by their \u2013 by their in-laws, by their \u2013 by their spouses, brothers and sisters, by \u2013 just \u2013 it\u2019s just \u2013 it\u2019s just ridiculous. And they can do nothing about it. And they try to arrest them when they cross state lines. BASH: \u00a0Thank you. TRUMP: \u00a0There have been many young women murdered by the same people he allows to come across our border. We have a border that\u2019s the most dangerous place anywhere in the world \u2013 considered the most dangerous place anywhere in the world. And he opened it up, and these killers are coming into our country, and they are raping and killing women. And it\u2019s a terrible thing. As far as the abortion\u2019s concerned, it is now back with the states. The states are voting and in many cases, they \u2013 it\u2019s, frankly, a very liberal decision. In many cases, it\u2019s the opposite. But they\u2019re voting and it\u2019s bringing it back to the vote of the people, which is what everybody wanted, including the founders, if they knew about this issue, which frankly they didn\u2019t, but they would have \u2013 everybody want it brought back. Ronald Reagan wanted it brought back. He wasn\u2019t able to get it. Everybody wanted it brought back and many presidents had tried to get it back. I was the one to do it. And again, this gives it the vote of the people. And that\u2019s where they wanted it. Every legal scholar wanted it that way. BASH: \u00a0Staying on the topic of abortion, President Biden, seven states \u2013 I\u2019ll let you do that. This is the same topic. Seven states have no legal restrictions on how far into a pregnancy a woman can obtain an abortion. Do you support any legal limits on how late a woman should be able to terminate a pregnancy? BIDEN: \u00a0I supported Roe v. Wade, which had three trimesters. First time is between a woman and a doctor. Second time is between a doctor and an extreme situation. A third time is between the doctor \u2013 I mean, it\u2019d be between the woman and the state. The idea that the politicians \u2013 that the founders wanted the politicians to be the ones making decisions about a woman\u2019s health is ridiculous. That\u2019s the last \u2013 no politician should be making that decision. A doctor should be making those decisions. That\u2019s how it should be run. That\u2019s what you\u2019re going to do. And if I\u2019m elected, I\u2019m going to restore Roe v. Wade. TRUMP: \u00a0So that means he can take the life of the baby in the ninth month and even after birth, because some states, Democrat-run, take it after birth. Again, the governor \u2013 former governor of Virginia: \u00a0put the baby down, then we decide what to do with it. So he\u2019s in \u2013 he\u2019s willing to, as we say, rip the baby out of the womb in the ninth month and kill the baby. Nobody wants that to happen. Democrat or Republican, nobody wants it to happen. BIDEN: \u00a0He\u2019s lying. That is simply not true. That \u2013 Roe v. Wade does not provide for that. That\u2019s not the circumstance. Only when the woman\u2019s life is in danger, she\u2019s going to die, that\u2019s the only circumstance in which that can happen. But we are not for late-term abortion, period, period, period. TRUMP: \u00a0Under Roe v. Wade, you have late-term abortion. You can do whatever you want. Depending on the state, you can do whatever you want. We don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good thing. We think it\u2019s a radical thing. We think the Democrats are the radicals, not the Republicans. BIDEN: \u00a0For 51 years, that was the law. 51 years, constitutional scholarship said it was the right way to go. 51 years. And it was taken away because this guy put very conservative members on the Supreme Court. Takes credit for taking it away. What\u2019s he going to do? What\u2019s he going to do, in fact, if \u2013 if the MAGA Republicans \u2013 he gets elected, and the MAGA Republicans control the Congress and they pass a universal ban on abortion, period, across the board at six weeks or seven or eight or 10 weeks, something very, very conservative? Is he going to sign that bill? I\u2019ll veto it. He\u2019ll sign it. BASH: \u00a0Thank you. TAPPER: \u00a0Let\u2019s turn now to the issue of immigration and border security. President Biden, a record number of migrants have illegally crossed the southern border on your watch, overwhelming border states and overburdening cities such as New York and Chicago, and in some cases causing real safety and security concerns. Given that, why should voters trust you to solve this crisis? BIDEN: \u00a0Because we worked very hard to get a bipartisan agreement that not only changed all of that, it made sure that we are in a situation where you had no circumstance where they could come across the border with the number of border police there are now. We significantly increased the number of asylum officers. Significantly \u2013 by the way, the Border Patrol endorsed me, endorsed my position. In addition to that, we found ourselves in a situation where, when he was president, he was taking \u2013 separating babies from their mothers, putting them in cages, making sure the families were separated. That\u2019s not the right way to go. What I\u2019ve done \u2013 since I\u2019ve changed the law, what\u2019s happened? I\u2019ve changed it in a way that now you\u2019re in a situation where there are 40 percent fewer people coming across the border illegally. It\u2019s better than when he left office. And I\u2019m going to continue to move until we get the total ban on the \u2013 the total initiative relative to what we\u2019re going to do with more Border Patrol and more asylum officers. TAPPER: \u00a0President Trump? TRUMP: \u00a0I really don\u2019t know what he said at the end of that sentence. I don\u2019t think he knows what he said either. Look, we had the safest border in the history of our country. The border \u2013 all he had to do was leave it. All he had to do was leave it. He decided to open up our border, open up our country to people that are from prisons, people that are from mental institutions, insane asylum, terrorists. We have the largest number of terrorists coming into our country right now. All terrorists, all over the world \u2013 not just in South America, all over the world. They come from the Middle East, everywhere. All over the world, they\u2019re pouring in. And this guy just left it open. And he didn\u2019t need legislation because I didn\u2019t have legislation. I said, close the border. We had the safest border in history. In that final couple of months of my presidency, we had, according to Border Patrol \u2013 who is great, and, by the way, who endorsed me for president. But I won\u2019t say that. But they endorsed me for president. Brandon, just speak to him. But, look, we had the safest border in history. Now we have the worst border in history. There\u2019s never been anything like it. And people are dying all over the place, including the people that are coming up in caravans. TAPPER: \u00a0Thank you, President Trump. President Biden? BIDEN: \u00a0The only terrorist who has done anything crossing the border is one who came along and killed three in his administration, killed \u2013 an al-Qaida person in his administration killed three American soldiers, killed three American soldiers. That\u2019s the only terrorist that\u2019s there. I\u2019m not saying no terrorist ever got through. But the idea they\u2019re emptying their prisons, we\u2019re welcoming these people, that\u2019s simply not true. There\u2019s no data to support what he said. Once again, he\u2019s exaggerating. He\u2019s lying. TAPPER: \u00a0President Trump, staying on the topic of immigration, you\u2019ve said that you\u2019re going to carry out, quote, \u201cthe largest domestic deportation operation in American history,\u201d unquote. Does that mean that you will deport every undocumented immigrant in America, including those who have jobs, including those whose spouses are citizens, and including those who have lived here for decades? And if so, how will you do it? TRUMP: \u00a0Can I get one second? He said we killed three people. The people we killed are al-Baghdadi and Salamani (sic), the two greatest terrorists, biggest terrorists anywhere in the world. And it had a huge impact on everything; not just border, on everything. He\u2019s the one that killed people with the bad border, including hundreds of thousands of people dying, and also killing our citizens when they come in. We \u2013 we are living right now in a rat\u2019s nest. They\u2019re killing our people in New York, in California, in every state in the union, because we don\u2019t have borders anymore. Every state is now a border. And because of his ridiculous, insane and very stupid policies, people are coming in and they\u2019re killing our citizens at a level that we\u2019ve never seen. We call it migrant crime. I call it Biden migrant crime. They\u2019re killing our citizens at a level that we\u2019ve never seen before. And you\u2019re reading it like these three incredible young girls over the last few days. One of them, I just spoke to the mother, and we just had the funeral for this girl, 12 years old. This is horrible what\u2019s taken place. What\u2019s taken place in our country, we\u2019re literally an uncivilized country now. He doesn\u2019t want it to be. He just doesn\u2019t know. He opened the borders nobody\u2019s ever seen anything like. And we have to get a lot of these people out and we have to get them out fast, because they\u2019re going to destroy our country. Just take a look at where they\u2019re living. They\u2019re living in luxury hotels in New York City and other places. Our veterans are on the street, they\u2019re dying, because he doesn\u2019t care about our veterans. He doesn\u2019t care. He doesn\u2019t like the military at all. And he doesn\u2019t care about our veterans. Nobody\u2019s been worse. I had the highest approval rating for veterans, taking care of the V.A. He has the worst. He\u2019s gotten rid of all the things that I approved, choice, that I got through Congress. All of the different things I approved, they abandoned. We had, by far, the highest, and now it\u2019s down in less than half because he\u2019s done \u2013 all these great things that we did \u2013 and I think he did it just because I approved it, which is crazy. But he has killed so many people at our border by allowing\u2026 TAPPER: \u00a0Thank you, President Trump. TRUMP: \u00a0\u2026 all of these people to come in. TAPPER: \u00a0President Biden\u2026 TRUMP: \u00a0And it\u2019s a very sad day in America. TAPPER: \u00a0President Biden, you have the mic. BIDEN: \u00a0Every single thing he said is a lie, every single one. For example, veterans are a hell of a lot better off since I passed the PACT Act. One million of them now have insurance, and their families have it \u2013 and their families have it. Because what happened, whether was Agent Orange or burn pits, they\u2019re all being covered now. And he opposed \u2013 his group opposed that. We\u2019re also in a situation where we have great respect for veterans. My \u2013 my son spent a year in Iraq living next to one of those burn pits. Came back with stage four glioblastoma. I was recently in \u2013 in \u2013 in France for D-Day, and I spoke to all \u2013 about those heroes that died. I went to the World War II cemetery \u2013 World War I cemetery he refused to go to. He was standing with his four-star general, and he told him \u2013 he said, I don\u2019t want to go in there because they\u2019re a bunch of losers and suckers. My son was not a loser. He was not a sucker. You\u2019re the sucker. You\u2019re the loser. TAPPER: \u00a0President Trump? TRUMP: \u00a0First of all, that was a made-up quote, suckers and losers. They made it up. It was in a third-rate magazine that\u2019s failing, like many of these magazines. He made that up. He put it in commercials. We\u2019ve notified them. We had 19 people that said I didn\u2019t say it. And think of this, who would say \u2013 I\u2019m at a cemetery, or I\u2019m talking about our veterans \u2013 because nobody\u2019s taken better care \u2013 I\u2019m so glad this came up, and he brought it up. There\u2019s nobody that\u2019s taken better care of our soldiers than I have. To think that I would, in front of generals and others, say suckers and losers \u2013 we have 19 people that said it was never said by me. It was made up by him, just like Russia, Russia, Russia was made up, just like the 51 intelligence agents are made up, just like the new thing with the 16 economists are talking. It\u2019s the same thing. Fifty-one intelligence agents said that the laptop was Russia disinformation. It wasn\u2019t. That came from his son Hunter. It wasn\u2019t Russia disinformation. He made up the suckers and losers, so he should apologize to me right now. BIDEN: \u00a0You had a four-star general stand at your side, who was on your staff, who said you said it, period. That\u2019s number one. And, number two, the idea \u2013 the idea that I have to apologize to you for anything along the lines. We\u2019ve done more for veterans than any president has in American history \u2013 American history. And they now \u2013 and their family. The only sacred obligation we have as a country is to care for our veterans when they come home, and their families, and equip them when they go to war. That\u2019s what we\u2019re doing. That\u2019s what the V.A. is doing now. They\u2019re doing more for veterans than ever before in our history. TAPPER: \u00a0All right. Thank you so much. BASH: \u00a0Let\u2019s move to the topic of foreign policy. I want to begin with Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine, which is now in its third year. Former President Trump, Russian President Vladimir Putin says he\u2019ll only end this war if Russia keeps the Ukrainian territory it has already claimed and Ukraine abandons its bid to join NATO. Are Putin\u2019s terms acceptable to you? TRUMP: \u00a0First of all, our veterans and our soldiers can\u2019t stand this guy. They can\u2019t stand him. They think he\u2019s the worst commander in chief, if that\u2019s what you call him, that we\u2019ve ever had. They can\u2019t stand him. So let\u2019s get that straight. And they like me more than just about any of them. And that\u2019s based on every single bit of information. As far as Russia and Ukraine, if we had a real president, a president that knew \u2013 that was respected by Putin, he would have never \u2013 he would have never invaded Ukraine. A lot of people are dead right now, much more than people know. You know, they talk about numbers. You can double those numbers, maybe triple those numbers. He did nothing to stop it. In fact, I think he encouraged Russia from going in. I\u2019ll tell you what happened, he was so bad with Afghanistan, it was such a horrible embarrassment, most embarrassing moment in the history of our country, that when Putin watched that and he saw the incompetence that he should \u2013 he should have fired those generals like I fired the one that you mentioned, and so he\u2019s got no love lost. But he should have fired those generals. No general got fired for the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country, Afghanistan, where we left billions of dollars of equipment behind, we lost 13 beautiful soldiers and 38 soldiers were obliterated. And by the way, we left people behind too. We left American citizens behind. When Putin saw that, he said, you know what? I think we\u2019re going to go in and maybe take my \u2013 this was his dream. I talked to him about it, his dream. The difference is he never would have invaded Ukraine. Never. Just like Israel would have never been invaded, in a million years, by Hamas. You know why? Because Iran was broke with me. I wouldn\u2019t let anybody do business with them. They ran out of money. They were broke. They had no money for Hamas. They had no money for anything. No money for terror. That\u2019s why you had no terror at all during my administration. This place, the whole world is blowing up under him. BASH: \u00a0President Biden? BIDEN: \u00a0I\u2019ve never heard so much malarkey in my whole life. Look, the fact of the matter is that we\u2019re in a situation where \u2013 let\u2019s take the last point first. \u00a0Iran attacked American troops, killed, caused brain damage for a number of these troops, and he did nothing about it. Recently \u2013 when he was president, they attacked. He said they\u2019re just having headaches. That\u2019s all it is. We didn\u2019t do a thing when the attack took place, number one. Number two, we got over 100,000 Americans and others out of Afghanistan during that airlift. Number three, we found ourselves in a situation where, if you take a look at what Trump did in Ukraine, he\u2019s \u2013 this guy told Ukraine \u2013 told Trump, do whatever you want. Do whatever you want. And that\u2019s exactly what Trump did to Putin, encouraged him, do whatever you want. And he went in. And listen to what he said when he went in, he was going to take Kyiv in five days, remember? Because it\u2019s part of the old Soviet Union. That\u2019s what he wanted to re-establish, Kyiv. And he, in fact, didn\u2019t do it at all. He didn\u2019t \u2013 wasn\u2019t able to get it done. And they\u2019ve lost over \u2013 they\u2019ve lost thousands and thousands of troops, 500,000 troops. BASH: \u00a0Thank you. President Trump\u2026 TRUMP: \u00a0I never said that. BASH: \u00a0\u2026 I\u2019m going to come back to you for one minute. I just want to go back to my original question, which is, are Putin\u2019s terms acceptable to you, keeping the territory in Ukraine? TRUMP: \u00a0No, they\u2019re not acceptable. No, they\u2019re not acceptable. But look, this is a war that never should have started. If we had a leader in this war \u2013 he led everybody along. He\u2019s given $200 billion now or more to Ukraine. He\u2019s given $200 billion. That\u2019s a lot of money. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s ever been anything like it. Every time that Zelenskyy comes to this country, he walks away with $60 billion. He\u2019s the greatest salesman ever. And I\u2019m not knocking him, I\u2019m not knocking anything. I\u2019m only saying, the money that we\u2019re spending on this war, and we shouldn\u2019t be spending, it should have never happened. I will have that war settled between Putin and Zelenskyy as president-elect before I take office on January 20th. I\u2019ll have that war settled. People being killed so needlessly, so stupidly, and I will get it settled and I\u2019ll get it settled fast, before I take office. BASH: \u00a0President Biden, you have a minute. BIDEN: \u00a0The fact is that Putin is a war criminal. He\u2019s killed thousands and thousands of people. And he has made one thing clear: He wants to re-establish what was part of the Soviet Empire. Not just a piece, he wants all of Ukraine. That\u2019s what he wants. And then do you think he\u2019ll stop there? Do you think he\u2019ll stop when he \u2013 if he takes Ukraine? What do you think happens to Poland? What do you think of Belarus? What do you think happens to those NATO countries? And so, if you want a war, you ought to find out what he\u2019s going to do. Because if, in fact, he does what he says and walks away \u2013 by the way, all that money we give Ukraine and weapons we make here in the United States. We give them the weapons, not the money at this point. And our NATO allies have produced as much funding for Ukraine as we have. That\u2019s why it\u2019s \u2013 that\u2019s why we\u2019re strong. BASH: \u00a0Thank you. Moving on to the Middle East, in October, Hamas attacked Israel, killing more than a thousand people and taking hundreds of hostages. Among those held and thought to still be alive are five Americans. Israel\u2019s response has killed thousands of Palestinians and created a humanitarian crisis in Gaza. President Biden, you\u2019ve put forward a proposal to resolve this conflict. But so far, Hamas has not released the remaining hostages and Israel is continuing its military offensive in Gaza. So what additional leverage will you use to get Hamas and Israel to end the war? You have two minutes. BIDEN: \u00a0Number one, everyone from the United Nations Security Council straight through to the G7 to the Israelis and Netanyahu himself have endorsed the plan I put forward, endorsed the plan I put forward, which has three stages to it. The first stage is trade the hostages for a ceasefire. Second phase is a ceasefire with additional conditions. The third phase is know \u2013 the end of the war. The only one who wants the war to continue is Hamas, number one. They\u2019re the only ones standing out (ph). We\u2019re still pushing hard from \u2013 to get them to accept. In the meantime, what\u2019s happened in Israel? We\u2019re finally \u2013 the only thing I\u2019ve denied Israel was 2,000-pound bombs. They don\u2019t work very well in populated areas. They kill a lot of innocent people. We are providing Israel with all the weapons they need and when they need them. And by the way, I\u2019m the guy that organized the world against Iran when they had a full-blown kind of ballistic \u2013 ballistic missile attack on Israel. No one was hurt. No \u2013 one Israeli was accidentally killed. And it stopped. We saved Israel. We are the biggest producer of support for Israel than anyone in the world. And so, that\u2019s \u2013 there\u2019re two different things. Hamas cannot be allowed to be continued. We continue to send our experts and our intelligence people to how they can get Hamas like we did Bin Laden. You don\u2019t have to do it. And by the way, they\u2019ve been greatly weakened, Hamas, greatly weakened. And they should be. They should be eliminated. But you got to be careful for what you use these certain weapons among population centers. TRUMP: \u00a0Just going back to Ukraine for one second, we have an ocean separating us. The European nations together have spent $100 billion, or maybe more than that, less than us. Why doesn\u2019t he call them so you got to put up your money like I did with NATO? I got them to put up hundreds of billions of dollars. The secretary general of NATO said Trump did the most incredible job I\u2019ve ever seen. You wouldn\u2019t \u2013 they wouldn\u2019t have any \u2013 they were going out of business. We were spending \u2013 almost 100 percent of the money was \u2013 it was paid by us. He didn\u2019t do that. He is getting all \u2013 you got to ask these people to put up the money. We\u2019re over $100 billion more spent, and it has a bigger impact on them, because of location, because we have an ocean in between. You got to ask them. As far as Israel and Hamas, Israel\u2019s the one that wants to go \u2013 he said the only one who wants to keep going is Hamas. Actually, Israel is the one. And you should them go and let them finish the job. He doesn\u2019t want to do it. He\u2019s become like a Palestinian. But they don\u2019t like him, because he\u2019s a very bad Palestinian. He\u2019s a weak one. BASH: \u00a0President Biden, you have a minute. BIDEN: \u00a0I\u2019ve never heard so much foolishness. This is a guy who wants to get out of NATO. You\u2019re going to stay in NATO or you\u2019re going to pull out of NATO? The idea that we have \u2013 our strength lies in our alliances as well. It may be a big ocean, but we\u2019re \u2013 (inaudible) able to avoid a war in Europe, a major war in Europe. What happens if, in fact, you have Putin continue to go into NATO? We have an Article Five agreement, attack on one is attack on all. You want to start the nuclear war he keeps talking about, go ahead, let Putin go in and control Ukraine and then move on to Poland and other places. See what happens then. He has no idea what the hell he\u2019s talking about. And by the way, I got 50 other nations around the world to support Ukraine, including Japan and South Korea, because they understand that this was \u2013 this \u2013 this kind of dislocation has a serious threat to the whole world peace. No \u2013 no major war in Europe has ever been able to be contained just to Europe. BASH: \u00a0President Trump, just to follow up, would you support the creation of an independent Palestinian state in order to achieve peace in the region? TRUMP: \u00a0I\u2019d have to see. But before we do that, the problem we have is that we spend all the money. So they kill us on trade. I made great trade deals with the European nations, because if you add them up, they\u2019re about the same size economically. Their economy is about the same size as the United States. And they were \u2013 no cars. No \u2013 they don\u2019t want anything that we have. But we\u2019re supposed to take their cars, their food, their everything, their agriculture. I changed that. But the big thing I changed is they don\u2019t want to pay. And the only reason that he can play games with NATO is because I got them to put up hundreds of billions of dollars. I said \u2013 and he\u2019s right about this, I said, no, I\u2019m not going to support NATO if you don\u2019t pay. They asked me that question: Would you guard us against Russia? \u2013 at a very secret meeting of the 28 states at that time, nations at that time. And they (sic) said, no, if you don\u2019t pay, I won\u2019t do that. And you know what happened? Billions and billions of dollars came flowing in the next day and the next months. But now, we\u2019re in the same position. We\u2019re paying everybody\u2019s bills. BASH: \u00a0Thank you. TAPPER: \u00a0Let\u2019s turn to the issue of democracy. Former President Trump, I want to ask you about January 6, 2021. After you rallied your supporters that day, some of them stormed the Capitol to stop the constitutionally mandated counting of electoral votes. As president, you swore an oath to, quote, \u201cpreserve, protect and defend,\u201d unquote, the Constitution. What do you say to voters who believe that you violated that oath through your actions and inaction on January 6th and worry that you\u2019ll do it again? TRUMP: \u00a0Well, I don\u2019t think too many believe that. And let me tell you about January 6th, on January 6th, we had a great border, nobody coming through, very few. On January 6th, we were energy independent. On January 6th, we had the lowest taxes ever, we had the lowest regulations ever. On January 6th, we were respected all over the world. All over the world we were respected, and then he comes in, and we\u2019re now laughed at, we\u2019re like a bunch of stupid people. What happened to the United States\u2019 reputation under this man\u2019s leadership is horrible, including weaponization, which I\u2019m sure at some point you\u2019ll be talking about, where he goes after his political opponent because he can\u2019t beat him fair and square. TAPPER: \u00a0You have 80 seconds left. My question was: What do you say to those voters who believe that you violated your constitutional oath through your actions, inaction on January 6th, 2021, and worry that you\u2019ll do it again? TRUMP: \u00a0Well, I didn\u2019t say that to anybody. I said peacefully and patriotically. And Nancy Pelosi, if you just watch the news from two days ago, on tape to her daughter, who\u2019s a documentary filmmaker, as they say, what she\u2019s saying, oh, no, it\u2019s my responsibility, I was responsible for this. Because I offered her 10,000 soldiers or National Guard, and she turned them down. And the mayor of \u2013 in writing, by the way, the mayor. In writing turned it down, the mayor of D.C. They turned it down. I offered 10,000 because I could see \u2013 I had virtually nothing to do. They asked me to go make a speech. I could see what was happening. Everybody was saying they\u2019re going to be there on January 6th. They\u2019re going to be there. And I said, you know what? There\u2019s a lot of people coming, you could feel it. You could feel it too. And you could feel it. And I said, they ought to have some National Guard or whatever. And I offered it to her. And she now admits that she turned it down. And it was the same day. She was \u2013 I don\u2019t know, you can\u2019t be very happy with her daughter because it made her into a liar. She said, I take full responsibility for January 6th. TAPPER: \u00a0President Biden? BIDEN: \u00a0Look, he encouraged those folks to go up on Capitol Hill, number one. I sat in that dining room off the Oval Office \u2013 he sat there for three hours, three hours, watching, begging \u2013 being begged by his vice president and a number of his colleagues and Republicans as well to do something, to call for a stop, to end it. Instead, he talked \u2013 they\u2019ve talked about these people being patriots and \u2013 and great patrons of America. In fact, he says he\u2019ll now forgive them for what they\u2019ve done. They\u2019ve been convicted. He says he wants to commute their sentences and say that \u2013 no. He went to every single court in the nation, I don\u2019t know how many cases, scores of cases, including the Supreme Court, and they said they said \u2013 they said, no, no, this guy, this guy is responsible for doing what is being \u2013 was done. He didn\u2019t do a damn thing. And these people should be in jail. And they should be the ones who are being held accountable. And he wants to let them all out. And now he says if he loses again, such a whiner that he is, that there could be a bloodbath. TAPPER: \u00a0Thank you, President Biden. President Trump? TRUMP: \u00a0What they\u2019ve done to some people that are so innocent, you ought to be ashamed of yourself, what you have done, how you\u2019ve destroyed the lives of so many people. When they ripped down Portland, when they ripped down many other cities \u2013 you go to Minnesota, Minneapolis, what they\u2019ve done there with the fires all over the city. If I didn\u2019t bring in the National Guard, that city would have been destroyed. When you look at all of the \u2013 they took over big chunks of Seattle. I was all set to bring in the National Guard. They heard that, they saw them coming and they left immediately. What he said about this whole subject is so off. Peacefully patriotic. One other thing, the unselect committee, which is basically two horrible Republicans that are all gone now, out of office, and Democrats, all Democrats, they destroyed and deleted all of the information they found, because they found out we were right. We were right. And they deleted and destroyed all of the information. They should go to jail for that. If a Republican did that, they\u2019d go to jail. TAPPER: \u00a0Thank you, President Trump. President Biden, I want to give you a minute. BIDEN: \u00a0The only person on this stage that is a convicted felon is the man I\u2019m looking at right now. And the fact of the matter is he is \u2013 what he\u2019s telling you is simply not true. The fact is that there was no effort on his part to stop what was going on up on Capitol Hill. And all those people, every one of those who were convicted, deserves to be convicted. The idea that they didn\u2019t kill somebody, just went in and broke down doors, broke the windows, occupied offices, turned over desks, turned them over, statues \u2013 the idea that those people are patriots? Come on. When I asked him, the first of two debates we had \u2013 debates we had the first time around, I said, will you denounce the Proud Boys? He said, no, I\u2019ll tell them to stand by. The idea he\u2019s refusing \u2013 will you denounce these guys? Will you denounce the people we\u2019re talking about now? Will you denounce the people who attacked that Capitol? What are you going to do? TAPPER: \u00a0I\u2019m going to give you a \u2013 a minute, President Trump, for a follow-up question I have. After a jury convicted you of 34 felonies last month, you said if re-elected you would, quote, \u201chave every right to go after,\u201d unquote, your political opponents. You just talked about members of the Select Committee on January 6th going to jail. Your main political opponent is standing on stage with you tonight. Can you clarify exactly what it means about you feeling you have every right to go after your political opponents? TRUMP: \u00a0Well, I said my retribution is going to be success. We\u2019re going to make this country successful again, because right now it\u2019s a failing nation. My retribution\u2019s going to be success. But when he talks about a convicted felon, his son is a convicted felon at a very high level. His son is convicted. Going to be convicted probably numerous other times. He should have been convicted before, but his Justice Department let the statute of limitations lapse on the most important things. But he could be a convicted felon as soon as he gets out of office. Joe could be a convicted felon with all of the things that he\u2019s done. He\u2019s done horrible things. All of the death caused at the border, telling the Ukrainian people that we\u2019re going to want a billion dollars or you change the prosecutor, otherwise, you\u2019re not getting a billion dollars. If I ever said that, that\u2019s quid pro quo. That \u2013 we\u2019re not going to do anything, we\u2019re not going to give you a billion dollars unless you change your prosecutor having to do with his son. This man is a criminal. This man \u2013 you\u2019re lucky. You\u2019re lucky. I did nothing wrong. We\u2019d have a system that was rigged and disgusting. I did nothing wrong. TAPPER: \u00a0Thank you, President Trump. President Biden, you have said \u2013 I\u2019m coming right to you, sir. You \u2013 well, you want to respond? Go ahead. I\u2019ll give you a minute to respond. BIDEN: \u00a0The idea that I did anything wrong relative to what you\u2019re talking about is outrageous. It\u2019s simply a lie, number one. Number two, the idea that you have a right to seek retribution against any American just because you\u2019re a president is wrong, is simply wrong. No president\u2019s ever spoken like that before. No president in our history has spoken like that before. Number three, the crimes that you are still charged with \u2013 and think of all the civil penalties you have. How many billions of dollars do you owe in civil penalties for molesting a woman in public, for doing a whole range of things, of having sex with a porn star on the night \u2013 and \u2013 while your wife was pregnant? I mean, what are you talking about? You have the morals of an alley cat. TAPPER: \u00a0Give you a minute, sir. TRUMP: \u00a0I didn\u2019t have sex with a porn star, number one. Number two, that was a case that was started and moved \u2013 they moved a high-ranking official, a DOJ, into the Manhattan D.A.\u2019s office to start that case. That case is going to be appealed in one. We had a very terrible judge, a horrible judge, Democrat. The prosecutor were all high-ranking Democrats, appointed people. And the \u2013 both the civil and the criminal. He basically went after his political opponent because he thought it was going to damage me. But when the public found out about these cases \u2013 because they understand it better than he does, he has no idea what these cases are. But when he \u2013 they \u2013 when they found out about these cases, you know what they did? My poll numbers went up way up. You know that because you\u2019re reporting it. And we took in more money in the last two weeks than we\u2019ve ever taken in in the history of any campaign, I don\u2019t think any campaign has ever taken. Hundreds of millions of dollars came pouring in because the public knows it\u2019s a scam and it\u2019s a guy that\u2019s after his political opponent because he can\u2019t win fair and square. TAPPER: \u00a0Thank you, President Trump. President Biden, you have said, quote, \u201cDonald Trump and his MAGA Republicans are determined to destroy American democracy.\u201d Do you believe that the tens of millions of Americans who are likely to vote for President Trump will be voting against American democracy? BIDEN: \u00a0The more they know about what he\u2019s done, yes. The more they know about what he\u2019s done. And there\u2019s a lot more coming. He\u2019s got a lot of cases around the road coming around. He\u2019s got \u2013 he\u2019s got a whole range of issues he has to face. I don\u2019t know what the juries will do, but I do know \u2013 I do know he has a real problem. And so the fact that \u2013 could you ever think you\u2019re hearing any president say that, I\u2019m going to seek retribution? Do you ever hear any president say that he thought it might be a good idea? What got me involved to run in the first place after my son had died, I decided \u2013 in Iraq \u2013 because of Iraq, I said, I wasn\u2019t going to run again. Until I saw what happened in Charlottesville, Virginia, people coming out of the woods carrying swastikas on torches \u2013 torches and singing the same antisemitic bile they sang when \u2013 back in Germany. And what did \u2013 and the young woman got killed. I spoke to the mother. And she \u2013 they asked him, they said, what \u2013 well, what do you think of those people, the people who \u2013 the one who \u2013 the ones who tried to stop it and the ones who said, I think there\u2019s fine people on both sides? What American president would ever say Nazis coming out of fields, carrying torches, singing the same antisemitic bile, carrying swastikas, were fine people? This is a guy who says Hitler\u2019s done some good things. I\u2019d like to know what they are, the good things Hitler\u2019s done. That\u2019s what he said. This guy has no sense of American democracy. TAPPER: \u00a0President Trump? TRUMP: \u00a0Jake, both of you know that story\u2019s been totally wiped out. Because when you see the sentence, it said 100 percent exoneration on there. So he just keeps it going. He says he ran because of Charlottesville. He didn\u2019t run because of Charlottesville. He ran because it was his last chance at \u2013 he\u2019s not equipped to be president. You know it and I know it. It\u2019s ridiculous. We have a debate. We\u2019re trying to justify his presidency. His presidency, his \u2013 without question, the worst president, the worst presidency in the history of our country. We shouldn\u2019t be having a debate about it. There\u2019s nothing to debate. He made up the Charlottesville story and you\u2019ll see it\u2019s debunked all over the place. Every anchor has \u2013 every reasonable anchor has debunked it. And just the other day it came out where it was fully debunked. It\u2019s a nonsense story. He knows that. And he didn\u2019t run because of Charlottesville. He used that as an excuse to run. TAPPER: \u00a0President Biden? BIDEN: \u00a0And debunk. It happened. All you have to do is listen to what was said at the time. And the idea that somehow that\u2019s the only reason I ran. I ran because I was worried a guy like this guy can get elected. If he thought they were good people coming out of that all \u2013 that forest, carrying those \u2013 those woods, carrying those torches, then he didn\u2019t deserve to be president, didn\u2019t deserve to be president at all. And the idea that he\u2019s talking about all of this being fabricated, we saw it with our own eyes. We saw what happened on January 6. We saw the people breaking through the windows. We saw people occupying there. His own vice president \u2013 look, there\u2019s a reason why 40 of his 44 top cabinet officers refused to endorse him this time. His vice president hasn\u2019t endorsed him this time. So, why? Why? They know him well. They serve with them. Why are they not endorsing him? TAPPER: \u00a0Thank you, President Biden. We\u2019re going to be right back with more from the CNN presidential debate. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BASH: \u00a0Welcome back to the CNN Presidential Debate live from Georgia. Let\u2019s talk about persistent challenges you both faced in your first terms, and you\u2019d certainly face again in a second term. President Biden, while black unemployment dropped to a record low under your presidency, black families still earn far less than white families. Black mothers are still three times more likely to die from pregnancy related causes. And black Americans are imprisoned at five times the rate of white Americans. What do you say to black voters who are disappointed that you haven\u2019t made more progress? BIDEN: \u00a0They acknowledge he made a lot of progress, number one. The facts of the matter is more small black businesses that have been started in any time in history. Number two, the wages of black \u2013 black unemployment is the lowest level it has been in a long, long time. Number three, we find them \u2013 they\u2019re trying to provide housing for black Americans and dealing with segregation that exists among these corporate \u2013 these corporate operations that collude to keep people out of their houses. And in addition to that, we find that the impact of, on the \u2013 the choice that black families have to make relative to childcare is incredibly difficult. When we did the first major piece of legislation in the past, I was able to reduce black childcare costs. I cut them in half, in half. We\u2019ve got to make sure we provide for childcare costs. We\u2019ve got to make sure \u2013 because when you provide that childcare protections, you increase economic growth because more people can be in the \u2013 in the job market. So there\u2019s more to be done, considerably more to be done, but we\u2019ve done a great deal so far and I\u2019m not letting up and they know it. BASH: \u00a0You have 49 seconds left. What do you say to black voters who are disappointed with the progress so far? BIDEN: \u00a0I say, I don\u2019t blame them for being disappointed. Inflation is still hurting them badly. For example, I provided for the idea that any black family, first time home buyer should get a $10,000 tax credit to be able to buy their first home so they can get started. I made sure that we\u2019re in a situation where all those black families and those black individuals who provided had to take out student loans that were ballooning, that if they were engaged in nursing and anything having to do with volunteerism, if they paid their bills for 10 years on their student debt, all the rest was forgiven after 10 years. Millions have benefited from that and we\u2019re going to do a whole lot more for black families. BASH: \u00a0Thank you. President Trump? TRUMP: \u00a0And he caused the inflation. He\u2019s blaming inflation. And he\u2019s right, it\u2019s been very bad. He caused the inflation and it\u2019s killing black families and Hispanic families and just about everybody. It\u2019s killing people. They can\u2019t buy groceries anymore. They can\u2019t. You look at the cost of food where it\u2019s doubled and tripled and quadrupled. They can\u2019t live. They\u2019re not living anymore. He caused this inflation. I gave him a country with no, essentially no inflation. It was perfect. It was so good. All he had to do is leave it alone. He destroyed it with his green new scam and all of the other \u2013 all this money that\u2019s being thrown out the window. He caused inflation. As sure as you\u2019re sitting there, the fact is that his big kill on the black people is the millions of people that he\u2019s allowed to come in through the border. They\u2019re taking black jobs now and it could be 18. It could be 19 and even 20 million people. They\u2019re taking black jobs and they\u2019re taking Hispanic jobs and you haven\u2019t seen it yet, but you\u2019re going to see something that\u2019s going to be the worst in our history. BASH: \u00a0Thank you. President Biden? BIDEN: \u00a0There was no inflation when I became president. You know why? The economy was flat on its back. 15 percent unemployment, he decimated the economy, absolutely decimated the economy. That\u2019s why there was no inflation at the time. There were no jobs. We provided thousands of millions of jobs for individuals who were involved in communities, including minority communities. We made sure that they have health insurance. We have covered with \u2013 the ACA has increased. I made sure that they\u2019re $8,000 per person in the family to get written off in health care, but this guy wants to eliminate that. They tried 50 times. He wants to get rid of the ACA again, and they\u2019re going to try again if they win. You find ourselves in a position where the idea that we\u2019re not doing it. I put more \u2013 we put more police on the street than any administration has. He wants to cut the cops. We\u2019re providing for equity, equity, and making sure people have a shot to make it. There is a lot going on. But, on inflation, he caused it by his tremendous malfeasance in the way he handled the pandemic. BASH: \u00a0Thank you. Another persistent challenge is the climate crisis. 2023 was the hottest year in recorded history, and communities across the country are confronting the devastating effects of extreme heat, intensifying wildfires, stronger hurricanes, and rising sea levels. Former President Trump, you\u2019ve vowed to end your opponent\u2019s climate initiatives. But, will you take any action as President to slow the climate crisis? TRUMP: \u00a0Well, let me just go back to what he said about the police, how close the police are to him. Almost every police group in the nation from every state is supporting Donald J. Trump, almost every police group. And what he has done to the black population is horrible, including the fact that for 10 years he called them super predators. We can\u2019t, in the 1990s (ph), we can\u2019t forget that. Super predators was his name. And he called it to them for 10, and they\u2019ve taken great offense at it, and now they see it happening. But, when they see what I did for criminal justice reform and for the historically black colleges and universities, where I funded them and got them all funded, and the opportunity zones with Tim. As you know, Tim Scott was - incredible, he did a great job, a great Senator from South Carolina. He came to me with the idea and it was a great idea. It\u2019s one of the most successful economic development acts ever in the country, opportunity zones. And the biggest beneficiary are blacks. And that\u2019s why we have the best numbers with them in maybe ever, they\u2019re saying ever, I read this morning, wherever, the best numbers, he has lost much of the black population because he has done a horrible job for black people. He has also done a horrible job for Hispanics. But, why do you see these millions of people pouring into our country and they\u2019re going to take the jobs? And it\u2019s already started. And you haven\u2019t seen anything yet. It\u2019s a disaster. BASH: \u00a038 seconds left, President Trump. Will you take any action as President to slow the climate crisis? TRUMP: \u00a0So, I want absolutely immaculate clean water and I want absolutely clean air, and we had it. We had H2O. We had the best numbers ever. And we did \u2013 we were using all forms of energy, all forms, everything. And yet, during my four years, I had the best environmental numbers ever. And my top environmental people gave me that statistic just before I walked on the stage, actually. BIDEN: \u00a0I don\u2019t know where the hell he has been. The idea that, Dana, he said is true. I\u2019ve passed the most extensive, it was the most extensive climate change legislation in history, in history. We find ourselves \u2013 and by the way, black colleges, I came up with $50 billion for HBCUs, historic black universities and colleges, because they don\u2019t have the kind of contributors that they have to build these laboratories and the like. Any black student is capable in college in doing what any white student can do. They just have the money. But now, they\u2019ll be able to get those jobs in high tech. We\u2019re in a situation where the idea that he kind of is claiming to have done something that had the cleanest water, the cleanest water? He had not done a damn thing with the environment. He \u2013 out of the Paris Peace Accord \u2013 Climate Accord, I immediately joined it, because if we reach for 1.5 degrees Celsius at any one point, well, there is no way back. The only existential threat to humanity is climate change. And he didn\u2019t do a damn thing about it. He wants to undo all that I\u2019ve done. TRUMP: \u00a0The Paris Accord was going to cost us a trillion dollars, and China nothing, and Russia nothing, and India nothing. It was a ripoff of the United States. And I ended it because I didn\u2019t want to waste that money because they treat us horribly. We were the only ones \u2013 it was costing us money. Nobody else was paying into it. And it was a disaster. But, everything that he said just now, I\u2019ll give you an example. I heard him say before insulin, I\u2019m the one that got the insulin down for the seniors. I took care of the seniors. What he is doing is destroying all of our medical programs because the migrants coming in. They want everybody. And look, I have the biggest heart on the stage. I guarantee you that. And I want to take care of people. But, we\u2019re destroying our country. They\u2019re taking over our schools, our hospitals, and they\u2019re going to be taking over Social Security. He is destroying Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. BIDEN: \u00a0Where does that come from? The idea is that we, in fact \u2013 we were the only ones of consequence or not who are not members of the Paris Accord. How can we do anything when (ph) we\u2019re not able to \u2013 the United States can\u2019t get it\u2019s pollution under control? One of the largest polluters in the world, number one. We\u2019re making significant progress. By 2035, we will have cut pollution in half. We have \u2013 we have made significant progress. And we\u2019re continuing to make progress. We set up a Climate Corps for thousands of young people will learn how to deal with climate, just like the Peace Corps. And we\u2019re going to \u2013 we\u2019re moving in directions that are going to significantly change the elements of the cause of pollution. But the idea that he claims that he has the biggest heart up here and he\u2019s really concerned about \u2013 about pollution and about climate, I\u2019ve not seen any indication of that. And, by the way, with regard to prescription drugs, one company agreed that they would reduce the price to $35, which I was calling for \u2013 one, voluntarily. I made sure every company in the world, every pharmaceutical company, cannot have to pay. BASH: \u00a0Thank you. BIDEN: \u00a0And, by the way\u2026 TAPPER: \u00a0So every day millions of Americans struggle just to make ends meet. For many older Americans, Social Security provides a critical lifeline. President Biden, if nothing is done to Social Security, seniors will see their benefits cut in just over 10 years. Will you name tonight one specific step that you\u2019re willing to take to keep Social Security solvent? BIDEN: \u00a0Yes, make the very wealthy begin to pay their fair share. Right now, everybody making under $170,000 pays 6 percent of their income, of their paycheck, every single time they get a paycheck, from the time of the first one they get when they\u2019re 18 years old. The idea that they\u2019re going to \u2013 I\u2019m not \u2013 I\u2019ve been proposing that everybody, they pay \u2013 millionaires pay 1 percent \u2013 1 percent. So no one after \u2013 I would not raise the cost of Social Security for anybody under $400,000. After that, I begin to make the wealthy begin to pay their fair share, by increasing from 1 percent beyond, to be able to guarantee the program for life. TAPPER: \u00a0So you still have 82 seconds left. Are there any other measures that you think that would be able to help keep Social Security solvent, or is just \u2013 is that one enough? BIDEN: \u00a0Well, that one enough will keep it solvent. But the biggest thing I\u2019ll do, if we defeat this man, because he wants to get rid of Social Security; he thinks that there\u2019s plenty to cut in Social Security. He\u2019s wanting to cut Social Security and Medicare, both times. And that\u2019s with \u2013 and if you look at the program put forward by the House Republican Caucus that he, I believe, supports, is in fact wanting to cut it as well. The idea that we don\u2019t need to protect our seniors is ridiculous. We put \u2013 and, by the way, the American public has greater health care coverage today than ever before. And under the ACA, as I said, you\u2019re in a circumstance where 400,000 people \u2013 I mean, 40 million people \u2013 would not have insurance because they have a pre-existing condition. The only thing that allows them to have that insurance is the fact that they in fact are part of the ACA. And, by the way, the other thing is we\u2019re in a situation where I talk about education for black communities. I\u2019ve raised the number, the amount of money for Pell grants by other $8,000 for anybody making under $70,000 a year, are going to be able to get $15,000 towards their tuition. It\u2019s just \u2013 he \u2013 he just doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s talking about. TAPPER: \u00a0Thank you, President Biden. President Trump? TRUMP: \u00a0So I\u2019ve dealt with politicians all my life. I\u2019ve been on this side of the equation for the last eight years. I\u2019ve never seen anybody lie like this guy. He lies \u2013 I\u2019ve never seen it. He could look you in the face. So \u2013 and about so many other things, too. And we mentioned the laptop, We mentioned \u201cRussia, Russia, Russia,\u201d \u201cUkraine, Ukraine, Ukraine.\u201d And everything he does is a lie. It\u2019s misinformation and disinformation. The \u201closers and suckers\u201d story that he made up is a total lie on the military. It\u2019s a disgrace. But Social Security, he\u2019s destroying it. Because millions of people are pouring into our country, and they\u2019re putting them on to Social Security; they\u2019re putting them on to Medicare, Medicaid. They\u2019re putting them in our hospitals. They\u2019re taking the place of our citizens. They\u2019re \u2013 what they\u2019re doing to the V.A., to our veterans, is unbelievable. Our veterans are living in the street and these people are living in luxury hotels. He doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s doing. And it \u2013 it\u2019s really coming back. I\u2019ve never seen such anger in our country before. TAPPER: \u00a0President Biden? BIDEN: \u00a0The idea that veterans are not being taken care of, I told you before \u2013 and, by the way, when I said \u201csuckers and losers,\u201d he said \u2013 he acknowledged after it that he fired that general. That general got fired because he\u2019s the one that acknowledged that that\u2019s what he said. He was the one standing with Trump when he said it, number one. Number two, the idea that we\u2019re going to be in a situation where all these millions and millions, the way he talks about it, illegal aliens are coming into the country and taking away our jobs, there\u2019s a reason why we have the fastest-growing economy in the world, a reason why we have the most successful economy in the world. We\u2019re doing better than any other nation in the world. And, by the way, those 15 Nobel laureates he talked about being phony, those 15 Nobel laureates, economists, they all said that, if Trump is re-elected, we\u2019re likely to have a recession, and inflation is going to increasingly go up. And by the way, worst president in history \u2013 159 presidential scholars voted him the worst president in the history of the United States of America. TAPPER: \u00a0President Biden, thank you so much. Let\u2019s turn to the cost of childcare, which many American families struggle to afford. President Trump, both you and President Biden have tried to address this issue, but the average cost of childcare in this country has risen to more than $11,000 a year per child. For many families, the cost of childcare for two children is more than their rent. In your second term, what would you do to make childcare more affordable? TRUMP: \u00a0Just to go back. The general got fired because he was no good. And if he said that, that\u2019s why he made it up. But we have 19 people that said I didn\u2019t say it, and they\u2019re very highly respected, much more so than him. The other thing is, he doesn\u2019t fire people. He never fired people. I\u2019ve never seen him fire anybody. I did fire a lot. I fired Comey because he was no good. I fired a lot of the top people at the FBI, drained the swamp. They were no good. Not easy to fire people. You\u2019d pay a price for it, but they were no good. I inherited these people. I didn\u2019t put him there. I didn\u2019t put Comey there. He was no good. I fired him. This guy hasn\u2019t fired anybody. He never fires. He should have fired every military man that was involved with that Afghan \u2013 the Afghanistan horror show. The most embarrassing moment in the history of our country. He didn\u2019t fire? Did you fire anybody? Did you fire anybody that\u2019s on the border, that\u2019s allowed us to have the worst border in the history of the world? Did anybody get fired for allowing 18 million people, many from prisons, many from mental institutions? Did you fire anybody that allowed our country to be destroyed? Joe, our country is being destroyed as you and I sit up here and waste a lot of time on this debate. This shouldn\u2019t be a debate. He is the worst president. He just said it about me because I said it. But look, he\u2019s the worst president in the history of our country. He\u2019s destroyed our country. Now, all of a sudden, he\u2019s trying to get a little tough on the border. He come out \u2013 came out with a nothing deal, and it reduced it a little bit. A little bit, like this much. It\u2019s insignificant. He wants open borders. He wants our country to either be destroyed or he wants to pick up those people as voters. And I don\u2019t think \u2013 we just can\u2019t let it happen. If he wins this election, our country doesn\u2019t have a chance. Not even a chance of coming out of this rut. We probably won\u2019t have a country left anymore. That\u2019s how bad it is. He is the worst in history by far. TAPPER: \u00a0Thank you, President Trump. President Biden? BIDEN: \u00a0We are the most admired country in the world. We\u2019re the United States of America. There\u2019s nothing beyond our capacity. We have the finest military in the history of the world. The finest in the history of the world. No one thinks we\u2019re weak. No one wants to screw around with us. Nobody. Number one. Number two, the idea that we\u2019re talking about worst presidents. I wasn\u2019t joking. Look it up. Go online. 159 or 58, don\u2019t hold me to the exact number, presidential historians. They\u2019ve had meetings and they voted who\u2019s the worst president in American history. One through best to worst. They said he was the worst in all of American history. That\u2019s a fact. That\u2019s not conjecture. He can argue they are wrong, but that\u2019s what they voted. The idea that he is knowing (ph) \u2013 doing anything to deal with child care. He did very \u2013 virtually nothing to child care. We should significantly increase the child care tax credit. We should significantly increase the availability of women and men for child or single parents to be able to go back to work, and we should encourage businesses to hold \u2013 to have child care facilities. TAPPER: \u00a0Thank you, President Biden. President Trump, the question was about what would you do to make child care more affordable? If you want to take your minute. TRUMP: \u00a0Just you understand, we have polling. We have other things that do \u2013 they rate him the worst because what he\u2019s done is so bad. And they rate me \u2013 yes, I\u2019ll show you. I will show you. And they rate me one of the best. OK. And if I\u2019m given another four years, I will be the best. I think I\u2019ll be the best. Nobody\u2019s ever created an economy like us. Nobody ever cut taxes like us. He\u2019s the only one I know. He wants to raise your taxes by four times. He wants to raise everybody\u2019s taxes by four times. He wants the Trump tax cuts to expire so everybody, including the two of you are going to pay four to five times. Nobody ever heard of this before. All my life I\u2019d grow up and I\u2019d see politicians talking about cutting taxes. When we cut taxes, as I said, we did more business. Apple and all these companies, they were bringing money back into our country. The worst president in history by far, and everybody knows it. TAPPER: \u00a0President Biden? BIDEN: \u00a0Look, the fact of the matter is that he\u2019s dead wrong about it. He\u2019s increased the tariff \u2013 he\u2019s increased \u2013 he will increase the taxes on middle class people. I said I\u2019d never raise a tax on anybody making less than $400,000. I didn\u2019t. But this tariff, this 10 percent tariffs. Everything coming into the country, you know what the economists say? That\u2019s going to cost the average American $2,500 a year and more, because they\u2019re going to have to pay the difference in food and all the things that are very important. Number two, he\u2019s in a situation where he talks about how he has not raised \u2013 he somehow helped the middle class. The middle class has been devastated by you. Now you want a new tax cut of $5 trillion over the next ten years, which is going to fundamentally bankrupt the country. You had the largest deficit of any president in American history, number one. Number two, you have not, in fact, made any contact, any progress with China. We are the lowest trade deficit with China since 2010. TAPPER: \u00a0Thank you, President Biden. Thank you, President Biden. Let\u2019s discuss an epidemic impacting millions of Americans that both of you have made a top priority in your first term, the opioid crisis. And for both of you, the number of overdose deaths in this country has gone up. Under your term, it went up. Under your term, it has gone up. Former President Trump, despite the efforts that both of you have made, more than 100,000 Americans are dying from overdoses every year, primarily from fentanyl and other opioids. What will you do to help Americans right now in the throes of addiction, who are struggling to get the treatment they need? TRUMP: \u00a0To finish up, we now have the largest deficit in the history of our country under this guy, we have the largest deficit with China. He gets paid by China. He\u2019s a Manchurian candidate. He gets money from China. So I think he\u2019s afraid to deal with him or something. But do you notice? He never took out my tariffs because we bring in so much money with the tariffs that I imposed on China. He never took them away. He can\u2019t because it\u2019s too much money. It\u2019s tremendous. And we saved our steel industries. And there was more to come, but he hasn\u2019t done that. But he hasn\u2019t cut the tariffs because he can\u2019t, because it\u2019s too much money. But he\u2019s got the largest deficit in the history of our country and he\u2019s got the worst situation with China. China is going to own us if you keep allowing them to do what they\u2019re doing to us as a country. They are killing us as a country, Joe, and you can\u2019t let that happen. You\u2019re destroying our country. TAPPER: \u00a0So, President Trump, you have 67 seconds left. The question was, what are you going to do to help Americans in the throes of addiction right now who are struggling to get the treatment they need? TRUMP: \u00a0Jake, we\u2019re doing very well at addiction until the COVID came along. We had the two-and-a-half, almost three years of like nobody\u2019s ever had before, any country in every way. And then we had to get tough. And it was \u2013 the drugs pouring across the border, we\u2019re \u2013 it started to increase. We got great equipment. We bought the certain dog. That\u2019s the most incredible thing that you\u2019ve ever seen, the way they can spot it. We did a lot. And we had \u2013 we were getting very low numbers. Very, very low numbers. Then he came along. The numbers \u2013 have you seen the numbers now? It\u2019s not only the 18 million people that I believe is even low, because the gotaways, they don\u2019t even talk about gotaways. But the numbers of \u2013 the amount of drugs and human trafficking in women coming across our border, the worst thing I\u2019ve ever seen at numbers \u2013 nobody\u2019s ever seen under him because the border is so bad. But the number of drugs coming across our border now is the largest we\u2019ve ever had by far. TAPPER: \u00a0President Trump, thank you. President Biden? BIDEN: \u00a0Fentanyl and the byproducts of fentanyl went down for a while. And I wanted to make sure we use the machinery that can detect fentanyl, these big machines that roll over everything that comes across the border, and it costs a lot of money. That was part of this deal we put together, this bipartisan deal. More fentanyl machines, were able to detect drugs, more numbers of agents, more numbers of all the people at the border. And when we had that deal done, he went \u2013 he called his Republican colleagues said don\u2019t do it. It\u2019s going to hurt me politically. He never argued it\u2019s not a good bill. It\u2019s a really good bill. We need those machines. We need those machines. And we\u2019re coming down very hard in every country in Asia in terms of precursors for fentanyl. And Mexico is working with us to make sure they don\u2019t have the technology to be able to put it together. That\u2019s what we have to do. We need those machines. TAPPER: \u00a0Thank you, President Biden. President Trump, and again, the question is about Americans in the throes of addiction right now struggling to get the treatment they need. TRUMP: \u00a0Because this does pertain to it. He ended remain in Mexico, he ended catch and release. I made it catch and release in Mexico, not catch and release here. We had so many things that we had done, hard negotiations with Mexico, and I got it all for nothing. It\u2019s just like when you have a hostage, we always pay $6 billion for a \u2013 every time we sees hostage. Now we have a hostage. A Wall Street Journal reporter, I think a good guy, and he\u2019s over there because Putin is laughing at this guy, probably asking for billions of dollars for the reporter. I will have him out very quickly, as soon as I take office, before I take office. I said by literally as soon as I win the election, I will have that reporter out. He should have had him out a long time ago. But Putin is probably asking for billions and billions of dollars because this guy pays it every time. We had two cases where we paid $6 billion for five people. I got 58 people out and I paid essentially nothing. TAPPER: \u00a0Thank you, President Trump. Dana. BASH: \u00a0Let\u2019s turn to concerns that voters have about each of you. President Biden, you would be 86 at the end of your second term. How do you address concerns about your capability to handle the toughest job in the world well into your 80s? BIDEN: \u00a0Well, first of all, I spent half my career being \u2013 being criticized being the youngest person in politics. I was the second-youngest person ever elected to the United States Senate. And now I\u2019m the oldest. This guy\u2019s three years younger and a lot less competent. I think that just look at the record. Look what I\u2019ve done. Look how I\u2019ve turned around the horrible situation he left me. As I said, 50 million new jobs, 800,000 manufacturing jobs, more investment in America, over millions \u2013 billions of dollars in private investment and \u2013 and enterprises that we are growing. We\u2019ve \u2013 by the way, we brought an awful a lot of people \u2013 the whole idea of computer chips. We used to have 40 percent of the market. We invented those chips. And we lost it because he was sending people to cheap \u2013 to find the cheapest jobs overseas and to bring home a product. So I went \u2013 I went to South Korea. I convinced Samsung to invest billions of dollars here in the United States. And then guess what? Those fabs, they call them, to \u2013 to build these chips, those fabs pay over $100,000. You don\u2019t need a college degree for them. And there\u2019s billions, about $40 billion already being invested and being built right now in the United States, creating significant jobs for Americans all over \u2013 from all over the world. BASH: \u00a0President Biden, you have 40 seconds left. Would you like to add anything? BIDEN: \u00a0Yeah, I would. The idea that somehow we are this failing country, I never heard a president talk like this before. We \u2013 we\u2019re the envy of the world. Name me a single major country president who wouldn\u2019t trade places with the United States of America. For all our problems and all our opportunities, we\u2019re the most progressive country in the world in getting things done. We\u2019re the strongest country in the world. We\u2019re a country in the world who keeps our word and everybody trusts us, all of our allies. And our \u2013 those who he cuddles up to, from Kim Jong-un who he sends love letters to, or Putin, et cetera, they don\u2019t want to screw around with us. BASH: \u00a0Thank you. Former President Trump, to follow up, you would be 82 at the end of your second term. What do you say to voters who have concerns about your capabilities to serve? TRUMP: \u00a0Well, I took two tests, cognitive tests. I aced them, both of them, as you know. We made it public. He took none. I\u2019d like to see him take one, just one, a real easy one. Like go through the first five questions, he couldn\u2019t do it. But I took two cognitive tests. I took physical exams every year. And, you know, we knock on wood, wherever we may have wood, that I\u2019m in very good health. I just won two club championships, not even senior, two regular club championships. To do that, you have to be quite smart and you have to be able to hit the ball a long way. And I do it. He doesn\u2019t do it. He can\u2019t hit a ball 50 yards. He challenged me to a golf match. He can\u2019t hit a ball 50 yards. I think I\u2019m a very good shape. I feel that I\u2019m in as good a shape as I was 25, 30 years ago. Actually, I\u2019m probably a little bit lighter. But I\u2019m in as good a shape as I was years ago. I feel very good. I feel the same. But I took \u2013 I was willing to take a cognitive test. And you know what, if I didn\u2019t do well \u2013 I aced them. Dr. Ronny Jackson, who\u2019s a great guy, when he was White House doctor. And then I took another one, a similar one, and both \u2013 one of them said they\u2019d never seen anybody ace them. BASH: \u00a0Thank you. President Biden? BIDEN: \u00a0You\u2019re going to see he\u2019s six-foot-five and only 225 pounds \u2013 or 235 pounds. TRUMP: \u00a0(inaudible). BIDEN: \u00a0Well, you said six-four, 200. TRUMP: \u00a0(inaudible). BIDEN: \u00a0Well, anyway, that\u2019s \u2013 anyway, just take a look at what he says he is and take a look at what he is. Look, I\u2019d be happy to have a driving contest with him. I got my handicap, which, when I was vice president, down to a 6. And by the way, I told you before I\u2019m happy to play golf if you carry your own bag. Think you can do it? TRUMP: \u00a0That\u2019s the biggest lie that he\u2019s a 6 handicap, of all. BIDEN: \u00a0I was 8 handicap. TRUMP: \u00a0Yeah. BIDEN: \u00a0Eight, but I have \u2013 you know how many\u2026 TRUMP: \u00a0I\u2019ve seen your swing, I know your swing. (CROSSTALK) BASH: \u00a0President Trump, we\u2019re going to\u2026 (CROSSTALK) TRUMP: \u00a0Let\u2019s not act like children. BIDEN: \u00a0You are a child. BASH: \u00a0To you, a specific concern that voters have about you. Will you pledge tonight that once all legal challenges have been exhausted that you will accept the results of this election regardless of who wins and you will say right now that political violence in any form is unacceptable? TRUMP: \u00a0Well, I shouldn\u2019t have to say that, but, of course, I believe that. It\u2019s totally unacceptable. TRUMP: \u00a0And if you would see my statements that I made on Twitter at the time, and also my statement that I made in the Rose Garden, you would say it\u2019s one of the strongest statements you\u2019ve ever seen. In addition to the speech I made, in front of, I believe, the largest crowd I\u2019ve ever spoken to, and I will tell you, nobody ever talks about that. They talk about a relatively small number of people that went to the Capitol. And in many cases were ushered in by the police. And as Nancy Pelosi said, it was her responsibility, not mine. She said that loud and clear. But the answer is, if the election is fair free, and I want that more than anybody. And I\u2019ll tell you something \u2013 I wish he was a great president because I wouldn\u2019t be here right now. I\u2019d be at one of my many places enjoying myself. I wouldn\u2019t be under indictment because I wouldn\u2019t have been his political appoint \u2013 you know, opponent. Because he indicted me because I was his opponent. I wish he was a great president. I would rather have that. I wouldn\u2019t be here. I don\u2019t mind being here, but the only reason I\u2019m here is he\u2019s so bad as a president that I\u2019m going to make America great again. We\u2019re going to make America great again. We\u2019re a failing nation right now. We\u2019re a seriously failing nation. And we\u2019re a failing nation because of him. His policies are so bad. His military policies are insane. They\u2019re insane. These are wars that will never end with him. He will drive us into World War Three and we\u2019re closer to World War Three than anybody can imagine. We are very, very close to World War Three, and he\u2019s driving us there. And Kim Jong-Un, and President Xi of China \u2013 Kim Jong-Un of North Korea, all of these \u2013 Putin \u2013 they don\u2019t respect him. They don\u2019t fear him. They have nothing going with this gentleman and he\u2019s going to drive us into World War Three. BIDEN: \u00a0If you want a World War Three, let him follow (ph) and win, and let Putin say, do what you want to NATO \u2013 just do what you want. There\u2019s a thing called Article Five, an attack on one is attack on all, a required response. The idea \u2013 the idea \u2013 I can\u2019t think of a single major leader in the world who wouldn\u2019t trade places with what job I\u2019ve done and what they\u2019ve done because we are a powerful nation, we have wonderful piece (ph), because of the people, not me, because of the American people. They\u2019re capable of anything and they step up when they\u2019re needed. And right now, we\u2019re needed. We\u2019re needed to protect the world because our own safety is at stake. And again, you want to have war, just let Putin go ahead and take Kyiv, make sure they move on, see what happens in Poland, Hungary, and other places along that border. Then you have a war. BASH: \u00a0President Trump, as I come back to you for a follow-up. The question was, will you accept the results of this election regardless of who wins? TRUMP: \u00a0Just to finish what he said, if I might, Russia \u2013 they took a lot of land from Bush. They took a lot of land from Obama and Biden. They took no land, nothing from Trump, nothing. He knew not to do it. He\u2019s not going to play games with me. He knew that. I got along with him very well, but he knew not to play games. He took nothing from me, but now, he\u2019s going to take the whole thing from this man right here. That\u2019s a war that should have never started. It would\u2019ve never started ever with me. And he\u2019s going to take Ukraine and, you know, you asked me a question before, would you do this with \u2013 he\u2019s got us in such a bad position right now with Ukraine and Russia because Ukraine\u2019s not winning that war. He said, I will never settle until such time \u2013 they\u2019re running out of people, they\u2019re running out of soldiers, they\u2019ve lost so many people. It\u2019s so sad. They\u2019ve lost so many people and they\u2019ve lost those gorgeous cities with the golden domes that are 1,000-years-old, all because of him and stupid decisions. Russia would\u2019ve never attacked if I were president. BASH: \u00a0President Trump, the question was, will you accept the results of the election regardless of who wins? Yes or no, please? TRUMP: \u00a0If it\u2019s a fair and legal and good election \u2013 absolutely. I would have much rather accepted these but the fraud and everything else was ridiculous that if you want, we\u2019ll have a news conference on it in a week or we\u2019ll have another one of these on \u2013 in a week. But I will absolutely \u2013 there\u2019s nothing I\u2019d rather do. It would be much easier for me to do that than I\u2019m running again. I wasn\u2019t really going to run until I saw the horrible job he did. He\u2019s destroying our country. I would be very happy to be someplace else, in a nice location someplace. And again, no indictments, no political opponent\u2019s stuff, because it\u2019s the only way he thinks he can win. But unfortunately, it\u2019s driven up by numbers and driven it up to a very high level, because the people understand it. BIDEN: \u00a0Let\u2019s see what your numbers are when this election is over. TRUMP: \u00a0We\u2019ll see. BIDEN: \u00a0Let\u2019s see. You\u2019re a whiner. When you lost the first time, you continued to appeal and appeal to courts all across the country. Not one single court in America said any of your claims had any merit, state or local, none. But you continue to promote this lie about somehow there\u2019s all this misrepresentation, all the stealing. There\u2019s no evidence of that at all. And I tell you what? I doubt whether you\u2019ll accept it because you\u2019re such a whiner. The idea if you lose again, you\u2019re accepting anything, you can\u2019t stand the loss. Something snapped in you when you lost the last time. BASH: \u00a0We\u2019ll be right back with more from the CNN presidential debate live from Georgia. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) TAPPER: \u00a0It is now time for the candidates to deliver their closing statements. As predetermined by a coin toss, we\u2019re going to begin with you, President Biden. You have two minutes. BIDEN: \u00a0We\u2019ve made significant progress from the debacle that was left by President Trump in his \u2013 in his last term. We find ourselves in a situation where, number one, we have to make sure that we have a fair tax system. I ask anyone out there in the audience, or anyone out watching this debate, do you think the tax system is fair? The fact is that I said, nobody even making under $400,000 had a single penny increasing their taxes and it will not. And if I\u2019m reelected, that\u2019ll be the case again. But this guy is \u2013 has increased your taxes because of the deficit. Number one, he\u2019s increased inflation because of the debacle he left after \u2013 when he handled the pandemic. And he finds himself in a position where he now wants to tax you more by putting a 10 percent tariff on everything that comes into the United States America. What I did, when, for example, he wants to get away with \u2013 and get rid of the ability of Medicare to \u2013 for the ability to \u2013 for the \u2013 us to be able to negotiate drug prices with big pharma companies. Well, guess what? We got it \u2013 we got it down to 15 \u2013 excuse me, $35 for insulin instead of $400. No more than $2,000 for every senior no matter what they \u2013 how much prescription they need. You know what that did? That reduced the federal deficit (ph) \u2013 debt by $160 billion over 10 years because the government doesn\u2019t have to pay the exorbitant prices. I\u2019m going to make that available to every senior, all \u2013 or go longer. It\u2019s happening now, and everybody in America. He wants to get rid of that. We have \u2013 I\u2019m going to make sure we have childcare. We\u2019re going to significantly increase the credit people have for childcare. I\u2019m going to make sure we do something about what we\u2019re doing on lead pipes and all the things that are causing health problems for people across the country. We\u2019re going to continue to fight to bring down inflation and give people a break. TAPPER: \u00a0Thank you, President Biden. President Trump, you now have two minutes for your closing statement. TRUMP: \u00a0Like so many politicians, this man is just a complainer. He said we want to do this. We want to do that. We want to get rid of this tax, that tax, but he doesn\u2019t do anything. He doesn\u2019t do. All he does is make our country unsafe by allowing millions and millions of people to pour in. Our military doesn\u2019t respect him. We look like fools in Afghanistan. We didn\u2019t stop \u2013 Israel, it was such a horrible thing that would have never happened. It should have never happened. Iran was broke. Anybody that did business with Iran, including China, they couldn\u2019t do business with the United States. They all passed. Iran was broke. They had no money for Hamas or Hezbollah, for terror, no money whatsoever. Again, Ukraine should have never happened. He talks about all this stuff, but he didn\u2019t do it. For three-and-a-half years, we\u2019re living in hell. We have the Palestinians and we have everybody else rioting all over the place. You talk about Charlottesville. This is 100 times Charlottesville, 1,000 times. The whole country is exploding because of you, because they don\u2019t respect you. And they have to respect their president and they don\u2019t respect you throughout the world. What we did was incredible. We re \u2013 rebuilt the military. We got the largest tax cut in history, the largest regulation cut in history. The reason he\u2019s got jobs is because I cut the regulations that gave jobs, but he\u2019s putting a lot of those regulations back on. All of the things that we\u2019ve done, nobody\u2019s ever \u2013 never seen anything like \u2013 even from a medical standpoint. Right to Try, where we can try Space Age materials instead of going to Asia or going to Europe and trying to get when you\u2019re terminally ill. Now, you can go and you can get something. You sign a document. They\u2019ve been trying to get it for 42 years. But you know what we did for the military was incredible. Choice for our soldiers, where our soldiers, instead of waiting for three months to see a doctor, can go out and get themselves fixed up and readied up, and take care of themselves and they\u2019re living. And that\u2019s why I had the highest approval rating of the history of the V.A. So, all of these things \u2013 we\u2019re in a failing nation, but it\u2019s not going to be failing anymore. We\u2019re going to make it great again. BASH: \u00a0Thank you, former President Trump, President Biden. Stay with us because we have full analysis of this debate.

{"id": "2024_06_28_politics_texas-gender-affirming-care-ban", "text": "The Texas Supreme Court ruled Friday to allow the state\u2019s ban on nearly all gender-affirming care for minors to remain in effect. In an 8-1 decision, the all-Republican court overturned a lower court\u2019s order that blocked implementation of the law, known as\u00a0Senate Bill 14, while a challenge to its constitutionality was heard. The ruling marks the court\u2019s second opinion in favor of the same law in a year after it allowed the ban to take effect as scheduled in September. The law bars Texas health care providers from providing gender transition surgeries, puberty-blocking medication or hormone therapies to those under 18, although exceptions are provided for intersex patients. The ban was passed by the state\u2019s Republican-controlled legislature in May 2023 after days of protest and procedural delays by Democrats, which led to a provision that allowed those who had started receiving treatment to \u201cwean off.\u201d Under the law, which was signed last June, health care providers who offer such care would have their license revoked. Texas\u2019 ban is similar to restrictions in nationwide as GOP-led states have moved to curb gender-affirming care for minors, expressing concerns over the long-term effects of such treatment \u2014 though major medical associations have deemed it clinically appropriate. More than 20 states have enacted restrictions on gender-affirming care for minors. LGBTQ advocacy groups slammed the ruling Friday, with Lambda Legal \u2014 one of the parties involved in the original lawsuit against the bill \u2014 saying, \u201cIt is impossible to overstate the devastating impact of this ruling.\u201d \u201cInstead of leaving medical decisions concerning minor children where they belong, with their parents and their doctors, the Court here has elected to let politicians \u2014 in blatant disregard for the overwhelming medical consensus \u2014 determine the allowed course of treatment, threatening the health and the very lives of Texas transgender youth,\u201d Karen Loewy, senior counsel for Lambda Legal, said in a statement, vowing to \u201ccontinue to fight\u201d against such measures. Texas GOP Gov. Greg Abbott\u2019s office celebrated the decision, arguing that the ban \u201cprotects children from making permanent, life-altering decisions before they have the mental capacity to do so.\u201d \u201cPassed by a bipartisan majority in the Texas Legislature, this law ensures access to appropriate and medically necessary services,\u201d Abbott\u2019s press secretary Andrew Mahaleris said in a statement shared with CNN. \u201cGovernor Abbott will continue to work with the legislature to do everything possible to protect Texas children and their bright futures.\u201d Gender-affirming care for minors has become a political flashpoint, with Democrats criticizing Republicans for introducing record number of anti-LGBTQ bills and arguing that medical decisions regarding minors should be left to their parents. The Biden administration directly challenged Tennessee\u2019s ban on gender-affirming care for minors, and the US Supreme Court announced this week that it will hear the appeal, which will determine whether states can restrict such care.

{"id": "2024_06_27_politics_takeaways-biden-trump-debate", "text": "President Joe Biden is three years and seven months older than former President Donald Trump. In their debate Thursday night on CNN, the gap between the 81-year-old incumbent and his 78-year-old challenger seemed much larger. Biden, hoarse and displaying little vocal range, was often unable to express his differences with Trump with clarity. At one point, after Biden had trailed off as he defended his record on border security, Trump said: \u201cI really don\u2019t know what he said at the end of that sentence. I don\u2019t think he knows what he said, either.\u201d Trump, meanwhile, at times repeated his frequent election denialism. He said he\u2019d accept the results of the 2024 election if it\u2019s \u201cfair and legal,\u201d but then repeated his lies about fraud in the 2020 election. \u201cYou\u2019re a whiner, and you lost the first time,\u201d Biden said. It was the first time either man had debated since 2020, and they made history Thursday night: It was the first time a sitting president and a former president had ever debated. The two clashed over abortion, immigration, foreign policy, inflation and more. Their showdown took a bitter and personal turn. Biden highlighted Trump\u2019s criminal convictions. Trump responded by invoking Biden\u2019s son, Hunter, who was also recently convicted. Then Biden accused Trump of having sex with porn star Stormy Daniels while Trump\u2019s wife was pregnant. \u201cI didn\u2019t have sex with a porn star,\u201d Trump said. Here are 11 takeaways from the CNN debate in Atlanta, moderated by Jake Tapper and Dana Bash: Biden\u2019s age problem just got a lot worse The most important job for Biden on Thursday night was to put to rest voters\u2019 concerns about his biggest vulnerability \u2014 his age \u2014 and turn the election into a referendum on Trump. He failed to do so. Biden was hoarse and at times unintelligible. Words often ran together. He stumbled, particularly when he tried to cite statistics and legislation. He rarely raised his voice to hammer home points of emphasis \u2014 missing opportunities to attack Trump over his efforts to overturn the 2020 election, his Supreme Court appointments that led to the reversal of Roe v. Wade\u2019s abortion rights protections and more. Two campaign sources said Biden has had a cold in recent days. Though the Democratic primary is long over, his performance is sure to lead to more hand-wringing among party members over whether handing Biden a second nomination with only nominal opposition was the right move. It also raises the stakes for September 10, when Biden and Trump are set to meet for their second and, as of now, final, debate, hosted by ABC. Trump pulls (some of) his punches on Biden For a candidate who regularly attacks Biden on his age, Trump was fairly restrained during the president\u2019s numerous stumbles. About 20 minutes into the debate, Trump followed a Biden remark with a quick snipe, saying, \u201cI really don\u2019t know what he said at the end of that sentence. I don\u2019t think he does either.\u201d It was the exception that proved the rule \u2013 and history suggests it was a kind of self- or campaign-imposed rule on Thursday night for Trump to not be seen taunting or mocking Biden\u2019s difficulties. Four years ago, the first general election debate of the cycle was a mess for Trump, who constantly interrupted Biden and shouted over the moderators. If not exactly a lesson learned, then his tone in Atlanta was a correction designed to erase memory of that damaging, helter-skelter performance. When Biden stumbled over a question about the national debt, trying to explain the benefits of raising taxes on the super-rich before losing steam and concluding with the declaration that \u201cWe finally beat Medicare,\u201d there was a sense that Trump would pounce. He had his eyes trained on the president and his lips pursed for much of the rambling, difficult-to-discern answer. He almost winced at one point. But Trump then did a most un-Trump-like thing: he responded like a typical politician. \u201cWell, he\u2019s right: he did beat Medicare,\u201d Trump said, \u201cHe beat it to death.\u201d Then he continued on, railing about Biden\u2019s immigration policy. Questions over Biden\u2019s goal Besides Biden\u2019s physical shortcomings Thursday night \u2013 a voice that failed him, a diminished appearance and a split screen face that was widely shared online \u2013 it wasn\u2019t readily clear after 90 minutes what objectives he entered the evening hoping to achieve. Unlike in their first meetings four years ago, when Biden put Trump\u2019s record under the microscope and offered a more hopeful vision for the country, his message Thursday was muddled and not just by his struggles finishing a thought. Biden was clearly on defense most of the night, but that was to be expected, as he is the incumbent. But his explanation for his record was often deep in the weeds of the policy of his first term and fell short of evoking the \u201cMiddle Class Joe\u201d image he cultivated for years. His attacks on Trump were similarly uneven, and he struggled to fact check the former president on his lies\u00a0\u2014\u00a0even ones that had been repeated for years. On the biggest issue for Democrats \u2013 abortion \u2013 Biden flailed. At times, his retorts were bogged down in statistics that were hard to follow, like this riff on the former president\u2019s tax cuts for the wealthy: \u201cWe have\u00a01,000\u00a0trillionaires\u00a0in America, billionaires in America, and what\u2019s happening, they\u2019re in a situation where they in fact, pay 8.2% in\u00a0taxes.\u00a0If\u00a0they just paid 24% or 25%\u00a0\u2013 either\u00a0one of those numbers when they raise $500 million, billion dollars, I should say, in a\u00a010-year\u00a0period. We\u2019d be able to wipe out his debt.\u201d At another point, he said Trump \u201cis the only president other than Herbert Hoover, who had lost more jobs than he had when he began since Herbert Hoover.\u201d His canned rejoinders leaned on the collective thought of nameless constitutional scholars, historians and Nobel laureate economists to drive home his points. Biden is hardly the first incumbent to be tripped up by the initial debate. \u00a0But his aides were supposedly aware of this curse and had over prepared the president during a week of intense preparation at Camp David. What was presented Thursday, though, not only failed to quiet concerns about Biden\u2019s capacity to fight on \u2013 it left voters with an unclear idea of what he\u2019s fighting for. Biden\u2019s one-liner offense Throughout the debate, Biden\u2019s offensive strategy was to again and again deploy one-liners to ding Trump. Some of the lines were standard Biden fare. \u201cEvery single thing he\u2019s said is a lie. Every single one,\u201d he shot at the former president at one point. In another, he said, \u201cI\u2019ve never heard so much malarky in my life.\u201d And in a potentially bright spot for Biden, the president highlighted a 2020 report by The Atlantic that Trump had referred to American war dead as \u201csuckers\u201d and \u201closers.\u201d He invoked his son Beau, who died of brain cancer after a year in Iraq in which he was exposed to toxic fumes. \u201cMy son was not a sucker. You\u2019re a sucker. You\u2019re the loser,\u201d Biden said. And during a riff about Trump being convicted for trying to cover up having an affair with Daniels, Biden said, \u201cYou have the morals of an alleycat.\u201d The stark difference in addressing January 6 Put simply: Biden was eager to address the events of January 6, 2021, head on as Trump moved to change the subject, and the difference in the responses between the two candidates were some of the starkest during the entire debate. When the debate veered toward the attack on the US Capitol, Trump didn\u2019t address it directly. He described how the country, at the time, \u201chad a great border,\u201d that \u201cwe were energy independent,\u201d and that the United States had \u201cthe lowest taxes ever. We had the lowest regulations ever.\u201d The former president did not address the speech he delivered to supporters ahead of the riot that day, during which he encouraged supporters to\u00a0\u201cshow strength\u201d at the US Capitol. Biden, by contrast, said Trump \u201cencouraged those folks to go to Capitol Hill\u201d and that while the Capitol was under siege, Trump \u201csat there for three hours watching\u201d while staffers begged him to do something. Trump makes news with abortion pill stance In a debate dominated by discussion on the economy, inflation, immigration and foreign policy, abortion should have been Biden\u2019s strongest topic. The US Supreme Court handed abortion rights supporters two wins this month and Democratic voters are still motivated by anger over the overturning of Roe v. Wade. Instead, it was one of his worst moments of the night. Biden struggled to explain his party\u2019s stance on abortion, rambled, appeared confused at times and, unprompted, gave Trump an opening to bring up crimes migrants have committed against Americans. Earlier this month, the Supreme Court dismissed a case that would have rolled back access to the abortion pill mifepristone. And\u00a0Trump on Thursday backed the high court\u2019s ruling. \u201cThe Supreme Court just approved the abortion pill, and I agree with their decision to have done that and I will not block it,\u201d he said. From there, Trump reiterated his stance that regulating abortion should be left to the states, and repeated his false assertion that \u201cevery legal scholar\u201d wanted to end federal abortion protections. He said he supports exceptions for rape, incest and to protect the life of the mother. \u201cIt\u2019s been a great thing,\u201d Trump said of abortion returning to the states. \u201cIt\u2019s been a terrible thing,\u201d Biden shot back. \u201cThe fact is that the vast majority of constitutional scholars supported Roe when it was decided.\u201d But while abortion should have been one of the president\u2019s strongest moments of the night, given the emphasis his campaign has placed on restoring access, Biden\u2019s answer instead took a confusing turn and gave Trump an opening to talk about crimes committed against Americans by migrants. A vibes fight about Israel and Gaza There is no doubt that Trump would handle the war in Gaza much differently than Biden.\u00a0But how? \u201cLet Israel finish the job,\u201d he told Biden, the suggestion being that the president has done too much to restrain the Israeli government and its military bombardment of Palestinians in Gaza. Trump did not say whether he would back a Palestinian state, but did insist that Hamas\u2019 October 7 attack inside Israel would have \u201cnever happened\u201d if he had been in the White House at the time. He also said that Biden has\u00a0\u201dbecome like a Palestinian, but they don\u2019t like him because he\u2019s a bad Palestinian.\u201d That was probably \u00a0intended as a jab to suggest Biden is too deferential to the Palestinians but also too ineffectual earn their respect. It landed flat \u2013 if it landed at all. Biden didn\u2019t offer much himself. He talked up America\u2019s close alliance with Israel and made special note that the US is \u201cproviding Israel with all the weapons they need and when they need them.\u201d If he was fishing for progressive votes, there wasn\u2019t much to bite on. The president also talked up the ceasefire deal he spoke about a few weeks ago that has yet to materialize. (It is, by all recent accounts, a non-starter with leaders on both sides.) The next president \u2013 be it Biden or Trump \u2013 will have a massive job to do in the region. And that\u2019s especially true in Israel and Gaza, where when the fighting ends the US and other world powers will be called upon to negotiate some kind of peaceful path forward.\u00a0But as their performances on Thursday night showed, there are no easy answers and the hard truths will be difficult to come by. Trump ducks on deportations The immigration section of the debate was mostly memorable for Biden\u2019s stumble. But Trump did not directly answer a question about whether the severe immigration crackdown he has promised would involve deporting those who have been in the United States for decades, those with jobs and those whose spouses are US citizens. Instead, he pivoted into an attack on Biden, arguing that the president bears the blame for crime committed by undocumented immigrants since he took office. \u201cWe\u2019re living right now in a rat\u2019s nest. They\u2019re killing our people,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThey\u2019re killing our citizens at a level we\u2019ve never seen before.\u201d Biden, who had sought to emphasize that illegal border crossings have dropped recently, shot back: \u201cEvery single thing he said was a lie.\u201d Trump\u2019s take on foreign policy: Blame Joe As the former president tells it, the current one is not doing such a great job. The US military \u201ccan\u2019t stand him\u201d for a number of reasons, most infamously his botched withdrawal from Afghanistan.\u00a0Russian President Vladimir Putin was \u201cencouraged\u201d by him to invade Ukraine.\u00a0Iran, which \u201cwas broke\u201d during his presidency, was freed up by him to wage a proxy war against Israel because of him. Trump painted a bleak picture of the world and global politics during the Biden era. He also, again, refused to make a clear commitment to NATO, instead bragging about his efforts to get members up to date on their dues. Putin\u2019s terms for ending the war, he said, \u201cwere not acceptable\u201d \u2013 but only after being pressed on the issue. Biden, in response, called it \u201cmalarkey.\u201d It was Trump, he insisted, who emboldened Putin in the lead-up to Russia\u2019s invasion. If there was any \u201cencouraging,\u201d he added, it had come during Trump\u2019s four years of footsie with the autocrat. Biden\u2019s reasoning for continued US support for Ukraine broke down along two lines: First, that it is a priority and essential step because Putin, he believes, would not stop at Ukraine\u2019s western border. He also argued, as he\u2019s done in the past, that the existence of NATO inherently empowers the US \u2013 that such close allyship with Western Europe offers the US a stronger hand in all its interactions around the world. Trump makes a bid for Black and Latino voters As the debate turned to Black voters, Trump took an opportunity to make a bid for Black and Latino voters and knock Biden on inflation. Biden\u2019s chances of winning in November are dependent on Black support in Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania and reach states like Georgia and North Carolina. But polling has shown that Trump is making modest inroads with some Black voters, specificially men, while others are disengaged from the election. Biden was asked what his message is to Black voters who have seen record low unemployment but still face disparities when it comes to wages, maternal health and incarceration rates. Biden touted his policies, including his efforts to reduce student loan debt, but acknowledged that costs are up. \u201cI don\u2019t blame them for being disappointed, inflation is still hurting them badly,\u201d Biden said. \u201cThere\u2019s more to be done, considerably more to be done, but we\u2019ve gone a great deal so far, and I\u2019m not letting up and they know it.\u201d Trump blamed Biden for creating inflation and said his immigration policy has led to jobs losses for Black people. \u201cHe caused the inflation, and it\u2019s killing Black families, and it\u2019s killing Hispanic families and just about everybody,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThe fact is that his big kill on the Black people is the millions of people that he\u2019s allowed to come in through the border. They\u2019re taking Black jobs now.\u201d The conversation then turned to policing, as Biden said Trump tried to cut funding to police. Trump incorrectly said Biden referred to Black people as \u201csuper predators\u201d in the 1990s \u2013 that was\u00a0former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton\u00a0\u2013 and touted his work on criminal justice reform and opportunity zones with South Carolina Republican Sen. Tim Scott. \u201cAnd the biggest beneficiaries are Blacks, and that\u2019s why we have the best numbers with them in maybe ever,\u201d Trump said. The common thread: blaming inflation on the pandemic Biden and Trump landed on the same scapegoat when asked to explain their economic records: the\u00a0pandemic.\u00a0The back and forth over coronavirus for a moment made it feel like they were picking up where they left off in 2020. Asked at the top of the debate about one of the most persistent headwinds facing his reelection bid \u2013 inflation \u2013 Biden said he inherited an economy that was \u201cin freefall\u201d caused by Trump\u2019s stewardship of Covid-19.Biden said the pandemic was \u201cso badly handled\u201d by his predecessor. He quoted Trump saying the coronavirus was \u201cnot that serious\u201d when it arrived and poked fun at Trump\u2019s suggested remedy of injecting disinfectant into the body. \u201cWe put things back together,\u201d Biden said. Trump, for his part, blamed the pandemic for halting an economy he said was \u201cthe greatest economy in the history of our country\u201d \u2013 a familiar refrain from the former president. \u201cWe got hit with Covid and when we did we spent the money necessary so we didn\u2019t get hit with the great depression,\u201d Trump said. Trump \u2013 who racked up twice as much federal debt than Biden, according to a new nonpartisan report referenced by Tapper \u2013 went on to claim that he was about to start paying down the country\u2019s debt when the coronavirus first appeared. He then shifted the conversation to his successor\u2019s handling of the pandemic, including criticizing the vaccine mandates instituted by the Biden administration.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/27/politics/takeaways-biden-trump-debate/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/30/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_24_politics_haley-voters-biden-trump-aotm-podcast", "text": "My mother used to tell me you only learn when you listen. I think it was her polite way of getting me to shut up, but it\u2019s good advice even if her ultimate goal was a little quiet in the King family kitchen. Listening is a lost art in our politics. And, too often, in our political coverage. Everyday Americans are ignored, or given a quote or soundbite here and there, while most of the attention goes to the ever louder partisan bombast. Don\u2019t get me wrong \u2013 we need to cover what the politicians say. And what their ads say. And fact check it all. But our All Over the Map project is an attempt to shift the balance a bit. To listen. To learn. We have been at it 10 months now, and we are learning a ton from voters who are literally all over the map \u2013 in every way. Now, with a presidential debate looming on Thursday and a consequential election heading into the final stretch, we invite you to listen with us \u2013 in a way that goes beyond what we can do on television or in written dispatches. All Over the Map, in podcast form, comes to CNN Audio today, so we can share our voters\u2019 stories in more detail. You can hear people wrestle with their choices and explain the life experiences shaping their politics. A CNN series that began in Iowa and New Hampshire as the primary season took off now includes voters in South Carolina, Virginia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Georgia, Nevada and Arizona. Mom was right. You learn when you listen. My biggest lesson so far: Yes, there are huge differences in polarized America. But voters are not only willing but eager to have the tough conversations many politicians avoid. Most are willing to discuss the compromises politicians refuse to make. Economic anxiety is easy to find, as are doubts about the candidates. In our first episode, Nikki Haley voters share their thoughts, and their frustrations, with their two choices for president. There are enough supporters of the former South Carolina governor, who ended her GOP primary bid in March, to swing the election \u2013 so we wanted to visit a few in battleground Pennsylvania ahead of the first Biden-Trump debate. You will meet Linda Rooney and Michael Pesce and you will hear the torment of self-identified Reagan Republicans who want their party back from Trump but run afoul of their GOP DNA when they ponder voting to reelect a Democratic president. It is fascinating to listen to voters who start in the same place but take different turns when staring at the Trump-Biden crossroads. Rooney, from Media, Pennsylvania, in the Philadelphia suburbs, gives voice to a theme we hear a ton in our travels. She voted for Trump in 2016 and Biden in 2020. \u201cI\u2019m sad that we only have these two choices honestly,\u201d Rooney told us. \u201cI\u2019m tired of celebrities sort of being in politics. I don\u2019t like Trump, but I have to say we were, for us, personally, we were better off when he was president. I don\u2019t like how he\u2019s so unreliable in some ways. You never know what he\u2019s going to do next. I just want a normal person. Like, I just want someone normal. I don\u2019t want a celebrity, and I don\u2019t have confidence in Biden. So, I feel like I don\u2019t have a choice.\u201d But she promised to vote, and it is not lost on her that the Pennsylvania winner tends to be the national winner. Pesce is both part of the generation that changed American politics 40 years ago and the suburban shift that is reshaping our politics today. He lives in Doylestown, in competitive Bucks County, and, like Rooney, was a Trump voter in 2016 and a Biden voter in 2020. \u201cI became a Republican when I turned 18 because of Ronald Reagan,\u201d said Pesce, a Coast Guard veteran who works in a meat processing plant. \u201cI\u2019m a Reagan Republican. I like that version of conservatism. I like that version of America. His version of \u2018America First.\u2019 That we are the leaders of the free world. We are the leaders of the world military. This is what we stand for. And I\u2019m like, yeah, that\u2019s what I want to be.\u201d Down the road, we visit one of America\u2019s newest presidential battlegrounds and meet two voters whose 2024 choices \u2013 and conversations \u2013 are shaped by Biden\u2019s map-changing 2020 win in Georgia. And we explore the cracks in the Biden coalition that make his reelection math, and map, so challenging. A Palestinian American law school student in Dearborn, Michigan, gives voice to the anger young voters and Arab American voters feel over Biden\u2019s handling of Israel\u2019s war in Gaza. A Black entrepreneur in Milwaukee shares his take on the economic decline in neighborhoods that once offered a path to the middle class through factory jobs. I hope you will consider joining our journey. A few minutes into any voter conversation, you might feel no connection to someone who lives far away from you and perhaps has a very different life experience or political views. My bet, though, is by the end, something will connect you or stir your own thoughts about an issue or the candidates. We are just a bit over four months to Election Day now, and we know that the race is close, that the third-party candidates make the state-by-state math complicated and that voters who don\u2019t much like either major-party candidate will decide who wins. Maybe you fit in this group. Maybe you are certain about your choice and can\u2019t understand that frustration. I hope you can share a little time with us, and learn by listening.

{"id": "2024_06_28_politics_joe-biden-debate-performance-fallout", "text": "President Joe Biden\u2019s campaign insisted Friday he will not drop out of the 2024 race, but fractures between those in the president\u2019s orbit insisting on trudging forward and the broader Democratic world seeking a last-minute change were growing after Biden\u2019s disastrous debate performance. Biden acknowledged the weak performance while giving a much more animated speech in North Carolina on Friday, saying, \u201cI know I\u2019m not a young man. I don\u2019t walk as easily as I used to. I don\u2019t talk as smoothly as I used to. I don\u2019t debate as well as I used to, but i know what I do know: I know how to tell the truth. I know right from wrong. And I know how to do this job, I know how to get things done. And I know what millions of Americans know: When you get knocked down, you get back up.\u201d From the West Wing to Wilmington, Biden advisers spent Friday morning calling Democratic members of Congress, donors and other key supporters in hopes of allaying some of the widespread panic about the debate with former President Donald Trump on CNN Thursday night. Biden\u2019s performance \u2014 rife with a raspy voice, an often mouth-agape facial expression and one painful moment in which the president lost his train of thought and suddenly stopped speaking \u2014 laid bare the potential political costs of nominating the oldest-ever president for a second term. Asked whether Biden would exit the race, Biden campaign spokesperson Seth Schuster responded: \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s no basis for that,\u201d one Biden adviser also told CNN Friday morning. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing that voters have indicated that they agree with that.\u201d Mitch Landrieu, the campaign\u2019s co-chair, told CNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins Friday night that he has \u201c100% confidence in Joe Biden,\u201d adding that it will be \u201chis decision alone whether he\u2019s going to continue.\u201d \u201cAnd I think he answered that question for the public today in North Carolina,\u201d Landrieu said on \u201cThe Source.\u201d Despite anxiety from some donors, campaign sources highlighted a record $14 million 24-hour fundraising haul on Thursday, which comes amid signs that Biden\u2019s fundraising edge is slipping. The campaign set its new hourly fundraising record during the 11 p.m. to 12 a.m. hour Thursday following the debate, but a campaign official declined to provide a dollar amount. Biden\u2019s advisers also spent part of the day making calls to ease concerns among some Democratic donors as the campaign prepares for a long-planned fundraising push this weekend. The projections of confidence coming from Biden\u2019s White House and reelection campaign come amid questions even Biden allies are raising over whether anyone with the president\u2019s ear will seek to convince him to suspend his campaign. Democratic congressional leaders are not planning a direct intervention with Biden, according to multiple Democratic sources. Instead, they plan to focus on House and Senate races as they let the debate\u2019s dust settle with the public, and then assess the strength of Biden\u2019s campaign in the weeks ahead. House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries said Friday morning he is standing by Biden \u2014 but he added that he is waiting to hear from Biden at a North Carolina campaign rally later Friday. \u201cI\u2019m going to reserve comment about anything relative to where we are at this moment, other than to say I stand behind the ticket,\u201d Jeffries said. Even as calls for Biden to consider dropping out of the race grew on Friday, Democratic operatives and elected officials alike appeared largely resigned to the reality that him doing so was, at best, a remote possibility \u2014 and most likely a delusional fantasy. One significant reason: the unequivocal support from Biden\u2019s famously impenetrable innermost circle of advisers. One Biden aide argued that while the president is deeply insulated by the tight circle of aides who prepped him at Camp David, the buck ultimately stops with him. \u201cThe people around him aren\u2019t yes-men. All of them know how to tell him no. But once he makes a decision, they are really good at staying united,\u201d the aide said. For instance, there wasn\u2019t agreement on Biden\u2019s decision to seek a second term, \u201cbut once he decides, he decides,\u201d and the wagons are circled. \u201cThe most likely scenario is that nothing f**king changes, right? Because why would it?\u201d said one Democratic operative. The operative pointed the finger at the president\u2019s top advisers for allowing Biden to take the debate stage while knowing what they must have known. \u201cIt\u2019s not like Biden\u2019s inner circle didn\u2019t know this before last night. It\u2019s not like all of a sudden, they\u2019re like, \u2018Oh, wow. He\u2019s showing some signs of age,\u2019\u201d the operative said. One persistent gripe among Biden supporters was why his advisers did not think to preemptively share the fact that the president had been battling a cold, leading to Biden sounding raspy and soft-spoken \u2014 and as a result, at times unintelligible \u2014 on the debate stage. One Democratic congressman said \u201ceveryone\u201d in the party was privately buzzing about whether to try to convince the president to drop out, despite party leaders publicly standing by Biden. But the \u201cquestion is \u2014 who will do something about it?\u201d they said. The New York Times Editorial Board on Friday called for Biden to withdraw from the race, writing, \u201cThe greatest public service Mr. Biden can now perform is to announce that he will not continue to run for re-election.\u201d The board said in part that \u201cthere is no reason for the party to risk the stability and security of the country by forcing voters to choose between Mr. Trump\u2019s deficiencies and those of Mr. Biden.\u201d The board, though, wrote that it would still support Biden as its \u201cunequivocal pick\u201d if he remains in the race and against his predecessor. Biden campaign co-chair Cedric Richmond\u00a0pushed back later Friday, saying, \u201cThe last time Joe Biden lost the New York Times editorial board\u2019s endorsement, it turned out pretty well for him.\u201d Frustration within Biden\u2019s White House, campaign For years at the White House, and for months in Biden\u2019s Wilmington headquarters, anyone but the president\u2019s inner circle has been resigned to the fact that only that insular circle has any real power in the White House. Some aides who traveled to Camp David for debate prep sessions went there knowing they wouldn\u2019t be included in many of the key discussions. It has led to rising stars leaving the administration and strong recruits passing on jobs. But multiple junior and mid-level aides told CNN they were willing to deal with that and the professional frustration that comes with it as long as they could get Biden to deliver. Faith in that group has also been dashed by Biden\u2019s performance, quickly turning into fear that the only people who have the power to change up a campaign aren\u2019t up to it themselves. The frustration with the inner circle was growing on Friday after morning calls were led by more junior staffers on the campaign, giving the impression that those in Biden\u2019s inner circle were either failing to come up with clear talking points or distancing themselves from the president\u2019s performance. A White House official said group text threads were \u201cabysmal\u201d on Friday, with jokes about updating resumes. \u201cEveryone is deflated,\u201d the official said. One source of frustration, the official said, is that neither chief of staff Jeff Zients nor senior adviser Anita Dunn addressed the staff after Biden\u2019s poor debate showing. Zients and Dunn participated in a morning call with the top 40 division managers in the West Wing and Old Executive Office Building, an official said. Their message was one of staying the course \u2013 and they instructed the managers to pass that on to staffers. Many did not. \u201cThe inner circle is used to not having to say anything,\u201d the official said, but \u201cwe cannot pretend like yesterday didn\u2019t happen.\u201d CNN has reached out to the White House for comment about the official\u2019s statement. The Biden campaign will hold an all-staff meeting Friday afternoon, two Biden campaign officials told CNN, part of what they said is a routine pattern of Friday meetings. Many White House staffers were working from home Friday. \u201cWe\u2019re all already commiserating. No reason to do it at a desk,\u201d the official said. \u2018It\u2019s hard to debate a liar\u2019 Biden still plans to participate in a second presidential debate in September, an adviser told CNN. That adviser acknowledged the president\u2019s performance in Atlanta was lackluster but said the campaign is committed to highlighting the moments it believes worked for their candidate \u2014 and then moving on. Many Biden campaign and White House staffers, the adviser said, worked for former President Barack Obama\u2019s reelection campaign, in which Obama turned in a first debate performance that even he described as a \u201cstinker\u201d \u2014 and Obama still won reelection. Obama said Thursday night\u2019s debate didn\u2019t change the fundamentals of the race \u2013 even if it was a rough night. \u201cBad debate nights happen. Trust me, I know,\u201d Obama said in\u00a0a post on X. \u201cBut this election is still a choice between someone who has fought for ordinary folks his entire life and someone who only cares about himself. Between someone who tells the truth; who knows right from wrong and will give it to the American people straight \u2014 and someone who lies through his teeth for his own benefit. Last night didn\u2019t change that, and it\u2019s why so much is at stake in November.\u201d Biden did not plan to dwell on his own performance, one adviser told CNN, but rather will devote more time to pushing back on Trump\u2019s \u201cextreme positions and series of lies\u201d \u2014 work that he struggled to do on stage Thursday night. \u201cThere\u2019s one conversation happening on cable television,\u201d the adviser said, striking a defensive tone when discussing Biden\u2019s shaky debate showing. \u201cThere\u2019s another conversation happening with voters in the country.\u201d A separate adviser said: \u201cVoters are our north star,\u201d pointing to pointing to focus groups and overnight campaign research that found voters in Midwestern battlegrounds responding favorably to some substantive portions of the debate. But from the White House to campaign headquarters, Biden aides on Friday sent signals of defensive frustration \u2014 some directed at their candidate, but most reserved for jittery Democrats and commentators \u2014 over the president\u2019s failure to take command of the stage in his first debate with Trump. A half-dozen aides all dismissed suggestions that Biden was reconsidering seeking a second term. They pointed to a robust travel schedule in the weeks ahead and strong fundraising in the wake of the debate. Still, one adviser conceded: \u201cWe are in a dark place, but we\u2019re moving forward.\u201d Meanwhile, multiple Biden advisers complained that they were frustrated by the falsehoods Trump promoted during the debate, including the former president\u2019s attempt to discredit the Charlottesville White nationalist rally and the January 6, 2021, storming of the Capitol. That dynamic, they say, thrust Biden into a fact-checking role and required him, in their view, to spend much of his time on stage on the defensive \u2014 rather than employing the attack messaging they spent recent days developing. Near the end of the debate, one Biden adviser said he was frustrated \u201cthat Donald Trump is just making stuff up. Almost everything.\u201d And another expressed worry that voters would take Trump\u2019s versions of events at face value, acknowledging that Biden was attempting to correct the record in real-time. But Biden still struggled with his performance in those moments. Biden himself alluded to the challenge following the debate. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to debate a liar,\u201d Biden told patrons at an Atlanta-area Waffle House following the debate. \u201cThe New York Times said he lied 26 times. Big lies.\u201d Pro-Biden political world frets In the broader pro-Biden and anti-Trump political universe, the panic over Biden\u2019s debate performance was much clearer on Friday morning. On Wednesday, Republican Adam Kinzinger \u2014 the former Illinois congressman and Trump critic who did not seek reelection in 2022 after it became clear his role on the House panel that investigated the January 6, 2021, insurrection would cost him his primary race \u2014 made headlines by endorsing Biden. On Friday morning, Kinzinger retweeted a video of MSNBC\u2019s Joe Scarborough \u2014 whose show Axios reported Biden regularly watches \u2014 suggesting Democrats should consider asking Biden to step aside. \u201cI think we have to ask the same questions of him that we have asked of Donald Trump since 2016. And that is, if he were CEO and he turned in a performance like that, would any corporation in America, any Fortune 500 corporation in America, keep him on as CEO?\u201d Scarborough said. Kinzinger also retweeted \u201cThe Daily Show\u2019s\u201d Jon Stewart fuming over the debate. \u201cThis cannot be real life. It just can\u2019t,\u201d Stewart said. \u201cWe\u2019re America. God.\u201d The veterans of Obama\u2019s administration who launched the \u201cPod Save America\u201d series of podcasts popular with liberal listeners also lamented Biden\u2019s performance. \u201cWe have to beat Donald Trump. We have to have a nominee who can do that,\u201d former Obama speechwriter Jon Favreau said on X. \u201cAnd since we haven\u2019t had the convention yet, it would be absurd if Democrats didn\u2019t at least have a serious discussion about whether Joe Biden \u2014 who\u2019s a wonderful human being and has been a great president \u2014 is up for the job.\u201d Ben Rhodes, the former Obama deputy national security adviser, said: \u201cTelling people they didn\u2019t see what they saw is not the way to respond to this.\u201d Hill Democrats split on Biden\u2019s path forward On Capitol Hill, some Democrats expressed alarm about Biden\u2019s struggle to deliver clear answers in the debate. \u201cJoe Biden couldn\u2019t communicate, and Donald Trump lied every time he opened his mouth,\u201d Minnesota Rep. Angie Craig said. Illinois Rep. Brad Schneider said \u201cyeah\u201d when asked if he was keeping the door open to replacing Biden as the Democratic nominee. California Rep. Scott Peters called conversations about replacing Biden \u201cpremature,\u201d but said he is \u201copen to a conversation about how to win this election.\u201d \u201cI think everyone is concerned about last night,\u201d Peters told CNN. \u201cSo the campaign has got to convince a lot of people that this is a campaign we win.\u201d However, senior Democrats rallied to Biden\u2019s defense. Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said that \u201cfrom a performance standpoint, it wasn\u2019t great. \u00a0But from a values standpoint, it far outshined\u201d Trump. \u201cI think that on his worst night his presentation of integrity was \u00a0better than the other guy\u2019s dishonesty. To see the Republicans embrace that dishonesty is just stunning. So, no, I have no problems,\u201d she said. South Carolina Rep. Jim Clyburn, a close Biden ally whose endorsement in 2020 was crucial to the president claiming the Democratic nomination, didn\u2019t defend Biden\u2019s showing Thursday night, saying \u201cit was a poor performance,\u201d but argued that in baseball, batters get three strikes. \u201cThat was strike one,\u201d he said, insisting there is no one better to carry the Democratic message this fall. Retiring Democratic Sen. Ben Cardin of Maryland said he is \u201cvery confident\u201d in Biden\u2019s abilities. \u201cBiden might have had a bad evening, but we don\u2019t want four bad years under Donald Trump. So, on the issues, I thought Joe Biden handled them well. Obviously, we were all looking forward to a more, I guess, energetic approach,\u201d Cardin told reporters in the Capitol. \u2018We\u2019ve got a long way to go until the election\u2019 The more practical problem Democrats face is that even if Biden were to suspend his campaign, the primaries are long over, Biden\u2019s nominal challengers dispatched and the party\u2019s convention in Chicago next month could quickly turn chaotic. Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, the popular Democratic executive of perhaps the most important swing state, conceded on CNN Friday that Biden\u2019s debate performance \u201cwas not a good look.\u201d But Shapiro said the debate \u201cdoesn\u2019t change the fact that there are very stark, competing differences in this race, and I think what the American people have to do right now is make a decision.\u201d \u201cThe Biden campaign should speak for themselves. You know, no question the president was not his best last night, but we\u2019ve got a long way to go until the election,\u201d Shapiro said. Another popular Democratic swing-state governor, Michigan\u2019s Gretchen Whitmer, in a statement Friday morning did not directly mention Biden\u2019s debate performance \u2014 instead seeking to draw a contrast between Biden and Trump on abortion rights, health care policy and more. \u201cJoe Biden is running to serve the American people. Donald Trump is running to serve Donald Trump,\u201d Whitmer said. \u201cThe difference between Joe Biden\u2019s vision for making sure everyone in America has a fair shot and Donald Trump\u2019s dangerous, self-serving plans will only get sharper as we head toward November.\u201d This story has been updated with additional details.

{"id": "2024_06_28_politics_donald-trump-winning-streak", "text": "Donald Trump used to tell his fans that he\u2019d win so much, they\u2019d get tired of winning. This week, that might be true for once. President Joe Biden\u2019s incoherent and painful debate performance in Atlanta on Thursday night gave Trump a massive victory in the most pivotal moment of the 2024 White House campaign so far as he seeks to win a non-consecutive second term and pull off a stunning political comeback. Trump basked in the aftermath of the debate during a rally on Friday in Virginia and drew a link between what he said was the \u201cdecline\u201d of both his opponent and America. \u201cAs every American saw firsthand last night, this election is a choice between strength and weakness, competence and incompetence, peace and prosperity, war or no war,\u201d\u00a0Trump\u00a0said. Hours after the debate, a US Supreme Court ruling that the Justice Department overstepped in charging January 6 Capitol rioters handed the presumptive Republican nominee what he immediately hailed on social media as a \u201cBIG WIN.\u201d The 6-3 decision was a symbolic victory for the ex-president the day after he used the debate to try to whitewash the worst attack on democracy in modern times. There could also be legal ramifications with some scholars arguing the ruling could narrow the scope of Trump\u2019s federal election interference trial, even if special counsel Jack Smith believes his case can proceed unaffected. The ex-president\u2019s lawyers are already signaling they will seek to get evidence tossed and obstruction counts against the ex-president dismissed. The court released its decision ahead of an even more critical case that will bear more directly on Trump\u2019s criminal entanglements. On Monday, justices are expected to finally rule on his expansive claim of immunity for acts committed while president. If the long-awaited ruling by the conservative-majority court mandates new litigation in a lower court, it could have the effect of pushing Smith\u2019s election interference trial well beyond November\u2019s election even if it does not immediately curtail aspects of the special counsel\u2019s prosecution. Trump\u2019s year of peaks and disasters With Trump eyeing a return to the White House, the justices\u2019 evaluation of never-before-considered arguments on the limits of executive power is especially critical given his controversial belief that he would enjoy near unfettered authority in the Oval Office that would effectively place the presidency above the law. There was more good legal news for Trump in Florida, as federal Judge Aileen Cannon, whom he appointed, on Thursday plunged deeper into pretrial litigation in the case over his alleged handling of classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago resort. The way Cannon has overseen the case \u2013 and her frequent clashes with Smith\u2019s team \u2013 have already ensured that another one of Trump\u2019s criminal indictments will not go to trial before the election. And like the federal election interference case, the documents matter is one that a Trump-appointed attorney general in a second administration would have the power to dismiss. A second 2020 election case, in Georgia, is also stalled \u2013 partly over a controversy and appeals process triggered by a relationship between District Attorney Fani Willis and a prosecutor she appointed. There have been plenty of grim weeks for Trump this year, especially over the weekslong hush money trial that resulted in him becoming the first ex-president and major party presumptive nominee to be found guilty of a crime. And on July 11, his humiliation will be reinforced when he attends sentencing in New York before Judge Juan Merchan. His enforced attendance will epitomize his year of personal and political troughs and highs as it will take place just days before the ex-president travels to the Republican National Convention to formally accept his third consecutive presidential nomination. Trump is also expected to use the event in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, to unveil his vice-presidential nominee. There are still four months until the election \u2013 a span of political time that could see unforeseen events and crises at home and abroad that could transform the race. But Thursday night\u2019s debate could hardly have gone better for Trump, who has been locked in a neck-and-neck race with Biden with a slight edge in the swing states that will decide the election. While it\u2019s too early to assess how voters will respond, the president\u2019s disastrous performance unleashed despair among Democrats now questioning whether Biden should remain on the ticket. Even if Biden manages to bounce back, his campaign will never be able to erase the impressions of millions of television viewers who saw an elderly man struggling to compete sentences, losing his train of thought and gaping in apparent open-mouthed confusion at Trump \u2013 who cut a more vigorous, if deceitful, figure. The optics of the night helped reinforce a Republican narrative that the 81-year-old president is suffering from compromised cognition and the views of a majority of Americans that he\u2019s too old to serve a second term. Biden\u2019s struggles also gave Trump a free pass on a night when his gusher of lies and conspiracy theories showed that if anything, he\u2019s become more vengeful and threatening to the rule of law since he left office in disgrace after a chaotic one-term presidency in January 2021. A more effective presidential performance in the debate might have inflicted terminal damage on Trump\u2019s campaign. But while Biden failed his test of vitality at the debate, the ex-president\u2019s generally calm demeanor in the critical early exchanges meant that he did not play into Biden\u2019s accusations that he is \u201cunhinged\u201d and that something has \u201csnapped\u201d in him. While the president did manage to highlight Trump\u2019s extreme behavior and falsehoods later in the evening, the initial sparring was so devastating to Biden that his successes may have passed many voters by. Trump is only three years younger than Biden and often lapses into gibberish in campaign events. But polls show that voters worry less about his mental faculties and age. Many senior Democrats publicly argued on Friday that a bad debate did not mean that the reality of the election \u2013 involving a Republican candidate who has already sought to destroy democracy and might do so again \u2013 has not changed. Yet the stark truth for Biden is that his fumbling performance will only exacerbate concerns of many voters who cannot imagine him fully executing a second term that would end when he is 86. The Supreme Court hands Trump more favorable news In the January 6 case the Supreme Court on Friday ruled that the Justice Department overstepped by bringing obstruction charges against hundreds of people who rioted at the Capitol. At least some of those cases are likely to be reopened. The high court did however rule that the charge could still be filed against the rioters if prosecutors are able to show they were attempting not just to push their way into the building, but rather to stop the certification of the 2020 election. This wrinkle may allow Smith to also maintain the same charge against Trump. Trump\u2019s team expects to file motions to get obstruction counts against the former president dismissed, a source familiar with the matter told CNN\u2019s Paula Reid. Still, Smith\u2019s case against the presumptive GOP nominee is based on a more sweeping set of events and evidence than that arrayed against members of the pro-Trump mob. But even if a new legal gambit by Trump\u2019s team is successful in delaying proceedings with more litigation it would bolster his long-term goal of delaying the trial. As it is, there seems little chance a jury will hear the case in the coming months unless there is a blanket rejection by the high court of Trump\u2019s immunity claim next week. However, if Trump loses the election, and the case goes ahead unhindered, even the chance that his lawyers could narrow his criminal exposure could be immensely valuable to the ex-president. In the Florida documents case, Cannon said on Thursday that she wants to hold additional hearings on Trump\u2019s attempt to challenge key evidence and will allow his lawyers to question witnesses about the investigation and the FBI search of Mar-a-Lago for classified documents in 2022. Cannon has been accused of dragging out the case over multiple hearings. Some critics have put the delays down to her inexperience. Others have suggested that she\u2019s operating out of favoritism to the president who appointed her. But in an 11-page order Thursday, the judge rebuked critics. \u201cThere is a difference between a resource-wasting and delay-producing \u2018mini-trial,\u2019 on the one hand, and an evidentiary hearing geared to adjudicating the contested factual and legal issues on a given pre-trial motion to suppress,\u201d Cannon wrote. As far as Trump is concerned, Cannon can string out the case as long as she wants, especially if it keeps his favorable recent good run going.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/28/politics/donald-trump-winning-streak/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/30/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_28_politics_fact-check-donald-trump-sea-levels-climate-change", "text": "The day after their CNN presidential debate, former President Donald Trump cited a wildly inaccurate figure about sea levels to mock President Joe Biden\u2019s debate\u00a0claim that\u00a0\u201cthe only existential threat to humanity is climate change.\u201d Trump\u00a0said\u00a0at a Friday rally in Virginia that \u201cglobal warming is fine,\u201d rejecting the view of the overwhelming majority of scientists. And he said of Biden: \u201cHe said it again last night, that global warming is an existential threat. And I say that the thing that\u2019s an existential threat is not global warming, where the ocean will rise \u2013 maybe, it may go down, also \u2013 but it may rise one eighth of an inch in the next 497 years, they say. One eighth.\u201d He added what appeared to be a joke: \u201cWhich gives you a little bit more waterfront property if you\u2019re lucky\u00a0enough though.\u201d Facts\u00a0First:\u00a0Trump\u2019s\u00a0claim about the expected pace of\u00a0sea level\u00a0rise is\u00a0not even close to correct. The global average\u00a0sea level\u00a0is\u00a0currently risi\ufeffng\u00a0more\u00a0per year\u00a0than Trump claimed that people\u00a0say it will rise \u201cin the next 497 years.\u201d NASA\u00a0reported\u00a0in March that the current global average\u00a0sea level\u00a0rise in 2023 was 0.17 inches\u00a0per year, more than double the rate in 1993. And a World Meteorological Organization\u00a0report this\u00a0year\u00a0said the rate of\u00a0sea level\u00a0rise between 2014 and 2023 was\u00a0about 0.19 inches\u00a0per year. In other words,\u00a0sea level\u00a0rise is\u00a0already more than an eighth of an inch annually \u2013 and it is\u00a0accelerating. NASA\u00a0found\u00a0a jump of 0.3 inches\u00a0between 2022 and 2023. Gary Griggs, a University of California,\u00a0Santa Cruz professor of earth and planetary\u00a0sciences\u00a0who\u00a0studies\u00a0sea level\u00a0rise,\u00a0said\u00a0last year that Trump\u2019s\u00a0similar claims\u00a0\u201ccan only be described as\u00a0totally out of touch with reality\u201d and that Trump \u201chas\u00a0no idea what he is\u00a0talking about.\u201d Sea levels\u00a0rise by different amounts\u00a0in\u00a0different locations. For the US,\u00a0sea levels\u00a0are\u00a0expected to rise particularly fast\u00a0for the east coast and Gulf of Mexico coast \u2013 and Trump\u2019s\u00a0state of Florida, which is\u00a0bordered by both of those coasts, is\u00a0expected to be\u00a0affected more\u00a0severely\u00a0than many other coastal\u00a0states. In fact, Trump\u2019s\u00a0claims\u00a0about\u00a0sea levels\u00a0are highly inaccurate for the area near Mar-a-Lago, which is\u00a0on the Atlantic. Griggs\u00a0noted in a June email that\u00a0data\u00a0from the closest National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration tide gauge to Mar-a-Lago\u00a0shows\u00a0an increase of an eighth of an inch\u00a0roughly\u00a0every\u00a0nine months. Trump has\u00a0made similar claims\u00a0since his last presidential campaign - sometimes saying the estimate is an eighth of an inch increase over 200, 250, 300 or 400 years. Trump has also\u00a0previously\u00a0made the joke about rising seas creating more waterfront property.\u00a0In reality, rising sea levels are expected to have devastating consequences not only for many seafront properties but for areas further inland \u2013\u00a0rendering some communities uninhabitable\u00a0and others more dangerous, increasing the frequency and reach of\u00a0flooding, making hurricanes\u00a0more destructive, and damaging\u00a0infrastructure\u00a0and ecosystems.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/28/politics/fact-check-donald-trump-sea-levels-climate-change/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/30/2024", "section": "politics"}}

{"id": "2024_06_29_politics_voters-trump-biden-debate-2024", "text": "Larry\u00a0Malinconico\u00a0went to bed worried about President Joe Biden\u2019s debate performance.\u00a0He woke up thinking\u00a0he should do something about it. Malinconico is\u00a0an independent\u00a0and a\u00a0college geology professor in Northampton\u00a0County, Pennsylvania, a bellwether area in one of the nation\u2019s most\u00a0competitive presidential battlegrounds. \u201cI\u2019m extremely\u00a0concerned,\u201d Malinconico said just after the\u00a0CNN debate Thursday night. \u201cPresident Biden performed poorly, His voice was weak. He stumbled and had difficulty staying on track with his answers.\u201d Still, he\u00a0cannot fathom the alternative and ended his debate night take with this: \u201cDespite my significant\u00a0concerns about Biden\u2019s\u00a0capabilities,\u00a0I will still vote against Trump.\u201d But early Friday afternoon, Malinconico reached out to add this: \u201cAfter sleeping on the debate overnight \u2026 now I\u2019m much more in favor of supporting moves to have President Biden drop out or for an open (brokered perhaps)\u00a0convention.\u201d It was one of a flood of voter reactions highly\u00a0critical of the president\u2019s debate performance, and one of several suggesting the debate, at least in the short term, damaged the incumbent\u2019s standing with voters\u00a0critical to his reelection\u00a0 hopes. Pat Levin is another\u00a0Northampton\u00a0County resident. The 94-year-old told us when we first met a few months ago that she was not worried about Biden\u2019s age. She is still planning to vote Biden, but her reaction was also quite telling. Levin had nice things to say about Vice President Kamala Harris and\u00a0California Gov. Gavin Newsom, praising their interviews after the debate. \u201cNothing good to say,\u201d though, about Biden \u2013 and the overall substance of the\u00a0CNN Presidential Debate. \u201cBiden whispered, spoke haltingly and appeared exceedingly vulnerable,\u201d Levin, told\u00a0CNN in a text message. \u201cIt was a sad night for American politics.\u201d Michael Pesce, a self-described Reagan Republican who says he\u00a0cannot support Trump, offered a similar take. \u201cLast night was a horror show,\u201d Pesce said Friday. \u201cBiden looked old and doddering and not at all presidential. Trump was angry and bombastic\u00a0and unable to say anything truthful.\u201d Pesce told us in May he would reluctantly vote for Biden because he sees Trump as unfit for the presidency. His morning after debate take was telling \u2013 and, again, troublesome for Biden. \u201cThe Democrats need to have an open\u00a0convention and rally behind a much younger\u00a0candidate,\u201d Pesce said. Pesce, 60, lives in Bucks\u00a0County in the\u00a0Philadelphia\u00a0suburbs, and like Northampton, is a battleground within the battleground. Malinconico, Levin and Pesce are participating in a\u00a0CNN project designed to track the 2024\u00a0campaign through the eyes and experiences of voters who live in the\u00a0 battlegrounds and are part of\u00a0critical voting blocs. There are 60 voters participating so far, across 10 states, and they are diverse in every way. But the overwhelming\u00a0consensus after the debate, from Democrats and Republicans alike, was that Biden\u2019s showing was alarming. \u201cI\u2019m really scared that if Biden stays on the ticket, Trump is going to win,\u201d said Davette Baker, an African American and longtime Democratic\u00a0organizer in Milwaukee. And while strong Trump supporters were happy with his performance, the former president, too, faced some harsh\u00a0criticism from many of our voters, even\u00a0Republicans. \u201cSame old Donald, talked about himself,\u201d said Matt Vrahiotes, a\u00a0Christian\u00a0conservative who owns a small winery in Hall\u00a0County, Georgia. \u201cStroked his ego.\u201d Still,\u00a0Vrahiotes said Trump \u201cseems to be more\u00a0cognitive and mentally sharper.\u201d When we first\u00a0met, Vrahiotes said he would\u00a0consider a third party option, and his after the debate take reflected his\u00a0continued despair at the major party\u00a0choices. \u201cWhy not allow Kennedy on stage,\u201d he said of independent\u00a0candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who failed to meet the\u00a0CNN debate\u00a0criteria. Four big takeaways from our voters: \u2013\u2013 Those already unhappy with their\u00a0choices\u00a0came away from the debate even more sour about a Biden-Trump rematch. \u201cI hate that Trump talks down about America,\u2019\u201d said Antonio Munoz, a veteran who owns a Las Vegas restaurant and\u00a0catering business. \u201cI\u2019m not motivated to vote. Biden\u2019s\u00a0closing was weak.\u201d \u2013\u2013 Younger voters who align with Biden on many issues but feel little\u00a0connection with him because of his age were taken aback by his performance. \u201cI was genuinely shocked,\u201d said\u00a0Christine Ngyuen, 29, a former nurse who recently opened a Boba tea house in the Atlanta suburb of Decatur. \u201cBoth of our\u00a0candidates are far too old to be doing what they are doing,\u201d said Summer Matkin, a student at Wayne State University who lives in the Detroit suburbs. \u2014 Committed Democrats who plan to vote for Biden regardless of his performance still voiced exasperation because the debate reinforced their worries Trump\u00a0could win the election. \u201cIt felt like he let Trump drive a dangerously false narrative and\u00a0could do nothing more than say, \u2018That\u2019s a lie\u2019 without fully establishing the truth strongly,\u201d said Anushka Jalistagi, a recent University of Michigan graduate and former\u00a0co-president of the\u00a0campus\u00a0College\u00a0Democrats. \u2014 Trump supporters approved of his debate performance but there was no evidence in our group that he gained support. \u201cSad. We don\u2019t have the sharpest tacks in the box to vote for,\u201d said Kim\u00a0Cavaliere, a nurse in suburban Atlanta who is undecided and unhappy with her\u00a0choices. \u201cI bet other\u00a0countries are laughing at us. I was.\u201d Ibrahim Ghazal, a Palestinian-American law student from the Detroit area, is angry with Biden over the Hamas-Israel\u00a0conflict and leaning against voting for him again. But he had a dim view of Trump before the debate, and a dimmer one after. \u201cTrump had much better stage presence than Biden,\u201d Ghazal said in a text Friday. \u201cWhat was most disturbing to me was that Trump used the word \u2018Palestinian\u2019 as a slur.\u201d This was Trump during an exchange about the Hamas-Israel\u00a0conflict: \u201cYou should let them go and let them finish the job. He doesn\u2019t want to do it. He has become like a Palestinian. But, they don\u2019t like him because he is a very bad Palestinian. He is a weak one.\u201d Linda Rooney, a registered Republican who lives just\u00a0outside of Philadelphia,\u00a0voted for Biden in 2020 but said this year she would either \u201chold my nose\u201d and vote for Trump or write in a\u00a0conservative. There are 18 weeks left in the\u00a0campaign, but Trump\u2019s debate showing\u00a0did not win a\u00a0commitment from Rooney. \u201cLast night\u2019s debate was a disaster for Biden but what scares me more is that the Republicans\u00a0can\u2019t say they have a good\u00a0candidate either,\u201d she said. \u201cHow did my party get to the point where the only way we may win the presidency again is because we are up against someone who is feeble and not well? \u2026 Republicans should not be taking\u00a0a victory lap.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/29/politics/voters-trump-biden-debate-2024/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/30/2024", "section": "politics"}}
