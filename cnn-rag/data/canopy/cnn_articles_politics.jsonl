{"id": "2024_05_16_politics_kamala-harris-vice-president-debate-2024", "text": "Vice President Kamala Harris has agreed to debate Donald Trump\u2019s future running mate, a Biden campaign official told CNN Thursday. The Biden campaign informed CBS News it had accepted the network\u2019s invitation to participate in a vice presidential debate in studio on either of the two dates the outlet proposed, July 23 or August 13, the campaign official said. \u201cWe look forward to the Trump campaign accepting one of these dates so that the full debate calendar for this campaign can be set,\u201d the official added. The proposed date of July 23 would come less than a week after the conclusion of the Republican convention\u00a0in Milwaukee, giving Trump\u2019s running mate limited time to prepare for a debate with Harris. CNN has reached out to the Trump campaign about whether it would agree for his running mate to participate. On Friday, Trump took to his Truth Social platform to announce that his campaign had accepted an invitation for his future running mate to participate in a debate hosted by Fox News and called on Harris to do the same. But the Biden campaign indicated to CNN that Harris would not participate in Fox\u2019s debate, pointing to the fact that\u00a0the vice president\u00a0had already accepted CBS\u2019 invitation and referring CNN to an earlier statement by Biden campaign manager Jen O\u2019Malley Dillon. O\u2019Malley Dillon\u00a0specified that\u00a0presidential and vice-presidential debates \u201cshould be hosted by any broadcast organization that hosted a Republican Primary debate in 2016 in which Donald Trump participated, and a Democratic primary debate in 2020 in which President Biden participated \u2013 so neither campaign can assert that the sponsoring organization is obviously unacceptable.\u201d In the 2020 campaign cycle, the Democratic National Committee said Fox News would not host any Democratic primary debates, citing reporting in The New Yorker about the mutually beneficial relationship between Fox and the Trump administration. Trump said in an interview that aired Thursday that there was a \u201cpretty good chance\u201d he would announce his vice presidential pick at the convention in Milwaukee. \u201cI don\u2019t say anything\u2019s a 100%, but you\u2019re getting pretty close. I\u2019ll be doing it in Milwaukee,\u201d he told TMJ4 news. Donald Trump Jr., the president\u2019s oldest son who has been an advocate for his father picking Ohio Sen. JD Vance as his running mate, told the senator Thursday that \u201cwe should choose sooner than later, because I wanted that to be out there right now.\u201d Trump Jr. was speaking on his \u201cTriggered\u201d podcast. Vance indicated that if he received that call from the former president, he\u2019d take the job. \u201cI want to help your dad however I can,\u201d the senator told Trump Jr. \u201cCertainly, if he asked me, I want to help him.\u201d On Wednesday,\u00a0President Joe Biden and Trump accepted an invitation from\u00a0CNN to debate on June 27, a historically early showdown that will set the tone for the final months of the 2024 campaign. They have also agreed to\u00a0a debate on ABC News on September 10. Informal conversations between the Biden and Trump campaigns about debates had taken place in recent weeks and were largely focused on a mutual disdain for the Commission\u00a0on Presidential Debates and potential scenarios to work around the commission, three sources familiar with the discussions previously told CNN. For millions of Americans, the debates will represent the most extensive scrutiny they\u2019ll be able to give the candidates and their running mates since the debates leading up to the 2020 election. Harris this year has become\u00a0a key figure for\u00a0the\u00a0Biden\u00a0administration\u00a0and campaign, criss-crossing the country\u00a0to make\u00a0points that might be more difficult for the president \u2013 an older White man \u2013 to make himself. Her efforts have included serving as the administration\u2019s point person on abortion rights, becoming the\u00a0first sitting president or vice president\u00a0to visit an abortion provider and traveling to states such as\u00a0Florida\u00a0and\u00a0Arizona, where new court rulings and laws have thrown into doubt the future of abortion access\u00a0there.

{"id": "2024_05_17_politics_tax-relief-bill-house-floor", "text": "Florida GOP Rep. Greg Steube says he\u2019s willing to buck his own leadership and bring a\u00a0tax relief\u00a0bill to the House floor \u2013 with the help of House Democrats \u2013 if Speaker Mike Johnson won\u2019t. If it happens, it would mark a rare moment in the House and another first for the 118th\u00a0Congress. With a razor-thin majority, Johnson has faced intense pushback from conservative hardliners and there have been multiple instances of major legislation \u2013 such as government funding bills \u2013 passing with the support of a bipartisan coalition. The support Steube has gotten from Democrats for the move is also the latest example of how bipartisanship has emerged even in the midst of a highly polarized political environment. \u201cAs the tax package now appears to be stuck in the Senate, and House leadership has been unwilling to bring my bipartisan disaster tax relief legislation up as a standalone bill, I filed a discharge petition to bring this bill to the floor for a long-past due vote,\u201d Steube said in a statement to CNN. In late April, Steube\u00a0initiated a rare procedural move \u2013 and\u00a0filed his petition to discharge his bill \u2013 that would provide tax relief for people affected by federal disasters, including Hurricane Ian and residents affected by an Ohio train derailment. With the help of 190 Democrats signing on to the petition, it hit the critical 218 threshold that allows Steube to bring it directly to the floor for a vote. \u201cI am grateful for the motivation and support of 217 of my bipartisan colleagues as we join forces to deliver tax relief for Americans all across the country. In the 30 years of public discharge petitions, this petition is only the third to succeed. That\u2019s a testament to how important this issue is for ALL of our constituents. Floridians have waited since 2022 to receive tax relief from Hurricane Ian, and many other Americans have waited just as long for relief from other disasters. I look forward to swift passage of my legislation on the House floor and urge expeditious consideration in the Senate,\u201d he said. With the petition hitting the threshold, notice will be printed in the congressional record and added to the House calendar. Steube will be required to wait an additional seven legislative days following that, and then can opt to call up a vote on his bill in a floor statement. Speaker Johnson will then have up to two legislative days to bring the bill to the floor. A spokesman from Steube\u2019s office said the congressman will call up his petition if leadership does not act before then. If the bill comes to the floor via the discharge petition, it will mark the third time since 2000 \u2013 and the 12th time since 1967 \u2013 that a discharge petition was successfully executed. CNN has reached out to Speaker Johnson\u2019s office for comment. House leadership only has a finite amount of time in which to bring bills up for consideration and there are always more bills than there is floor time, so it\u2019s not uncommon for members to press for their priorities to get consideration only to find that there isn\u2019t always enough time in the calendar. It\u2019s extremely uncommon, however, for members to succeed in bringing a bill to the floor via a discharge petition. Steube expects that once his bill hits the floor for a vote \u2013 whether via the discharge petition or through leadership action \u2013 it will pass with wide bipartisan support. \u201cWe were going to get to 218 signatures one way or another, and I expect close to unanimous support from the entire House when the vote occurs,\u201d he said.

{"id": "2024_05_17_politics_john-eastman-arizona-not-guilty-plea", "text": "Former Donald Trump lawyer John\u00a0Eastman\u00a0pleaded not guilty in Phoenix on Friday on charges related to allegedly participating in a conspiracy to overturn the 2020 election results in Arizona. A grand jury in Arizona handed up indictments last month charging\u00a0Eastman\u00a0and over a dozen more Trump allies for their efforts to overturn his 2020 election defeat, including the fake electors from that state and several individuals connected to his campaign. While Trump is not among those charged in Arizona, the details in the indictment suggest he is \u201cUnindicted Coconspirator 1.\u201d \u201cI,\u00a0of course,\u00a0plead\u00a0not guilty,\u201d Eastman said following the brief hearing. \u201cI\u2019m confident that,\u00a0with the laws faithfully applied, I will be exonerated at the end of this process.\u201d Eastman was released from custody without conditions. Eastman\u00a0is the first defendant charged in the Arizona case to appear in court and the others are scheduled to follow suit in the coming weeks. Among them are Trump\u2019s former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, former attorney Rudy Giuliani, close aide Boris Epshteyn and Christina Bobb, the top lawyer on \u201celection integrity\u201d for the Republican National Committee. Each defendant is expected to be fingerprinted and have a mugshot taken as they are processed, a source familiar with the matter told CNN. Eastman\u2019s indictment stems from being among those\u00a0pushing fringe legal theories\u00a0for overturning the 2020 election results and intimately involved in the fake electors scheme. \u201cThis really tracks much of the same type of information and allegations that we see in the Georgia indictment and others,\u201d Michael Moore,\u00a0a\u00a0CNN legal analyst and former US attorney,\u00a0said\u00a0Friday on\u00a0\u201cCNN Newsroom.\u201d\u00a0\u201cAnd that is dealing with whether or not there was some forgery committed by presenting false documents and signatures, and that is the offenses that could be defined by state law, so you\u2019re seeing state officials bringing these charges.\u201d The right-wing lawyer devised a multi-step plan for then-Vice President Mike Pence to overturn the 2020 election and advised Trump on plots to disrupt Congress\u2019 certification of the 2020 election results. The House select committee investigating the deadly January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol\u00a0explained how\u00a0Eastman put forward a legal theory that Pence could unilaterally block certification of the election \u2013 a theory that was roundly rejected by Trump\u2019s White House attorneys and Pence\u2019s team, but was nevertheless embraced by the former president. Although Eastman\u00a0wants to keep practicing law\u00a0so he can represent clients and pay his own legal bills as he fights criminal charges stemming from the 2020 election efforts, an attorney discipline judge in California rejected a request from Eastman to reactivate his law license earlier this month\u00a0following her recent recommendation\u00a0that he be disbarred. \u201cIt\u2019s a serious charge, obviously, it can affect both the law licenses for those involved, if they are lawyers, as well as the liberty of them if they are convicted,\u201d Moore said.

{"id": "2024_05_18_politics_senate-republicans-election-control", "text": "The race for the White House hogs most of the attention in a presidential election year, relegating the race for Congress to ugly stepsister status. But in recent years, we\u2019ve all learned how important down-ballot races can be in shaping American policy. That\u2019s especially true for the Senate, which is responsible for the confirmations of government officials and Supreme Court nominees. In this year\u2019s battle for the Senate, like so many cycles before, we have the same competing forces: The election fundamentals favor Republicans, while candidate quality appears to favor Democrats, who currently hold a narrow majority in the chamber. For now, though, it appears even flawed Republican candidates likely won\u2019t be able to stop their side from winning Senate control. Democrats face two \u201cM\u201d problems: the math and the map. Let\u2019s start with the math. Republicans need a net gain of one seat to win the Senate if Donald Trump wins the presidency (with his vice president casting any tie-breaking votes). They need a net gain of two seats for a majority regardless of who wins the presidential election. Republicans have a lot of options to net those one or two seats. Senate Democrats (including independents who caucus with them) hold 23 seats up for election this year; Republicans hold 11. This brings us to the map. Eight of the 23 Democratic seats up for election this year are in states either where Trump won in 2016 or where he is up by at least 5 points in the polls now. Five of them are in states where Trump holds at least a 5-point advantage. Three are in states where Trump won by at least 8 points in 2016 and 2020 and where the incumbent senator is the only Democrat in nonjudicial statewide office. One of those three is West Virginia, where Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin is retiring. Trump won the state by 39 points in 2020, and every respectable nonpartisan handicapping outlet views the seat as a safe Republican pickup. There are only two Republican Senate seats being targeted by Democrats \u2013 Florida and Texas, which Trump carried by single digits in 2020. But the GOP incumbents in both states currently lead their Democratic opponents by double digits. Every other Republican-held Senate seat on the ballot this year is in a state where GOP presidential candidates have dominated since 2012. It\u2019s no wonder that my colleague Simone Pathe had only one Republican seat (Texas) on her most recent list of the 10 Senate seats most likely to flip this year, and that was at No. 10. Positive signs for Democrats But is the race for the Senate really over if Republicans just win West Virginia? No, we can\u2019t call it just yet, and it\u2019s not just because we\u2019re still months before the general election. It\u2019s because if President Joe Biden does win \u2013 a real possibility \u2013 it\u2019s not entirely clear which second Senate seat Republicans will pick up to gain control. Among the eight Democratic Senate seats mentioned above, there are no states beyond West Virginia where the polls (or expert judgment) show Republicans with a solid lead, despite the fundamentals favoring their party this year.\u00a0Democratic Senate candidates seem to be at least tied or ahead in Arizona, Michigan, Montana, Nevada, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. The Democratic Senate candidates\u2019 margins outran Biden\u2019s in the four states \u2013 Arizona, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin \u2013 that The New York Times and Siena College recently polled. And we\u2019re not just talking by a little bit; we\u2019re talking about them doing better than Biden by at least 5 points in those four states among likely voters. A key reason the Democratic candidates are doing so much better than Biden is because they\u2019re popular. We know from recent polls that Sens. Bob Casey of Pennsylvania and Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin had positive net favorability ratings, while Biden\u2019s numbers were well under water in these states. Meanwhile in Arizona, Republicans appear poised to nominate Kari Lake for Senate. Lake was last seen losing a very winnable gubernatorial election in 2022 and her high unfavorable score with state voters was a big reason why Inside Elections recently shifted its rating of the race in the Democratic direction. Of course, Democratic Senate candidates outrunning the top of the ticket is nothing new. Republicans have memorably lost plenty of very winnable seats over the past decade and a half with bad candidates (see 2010 with Nevada\u2019s Sharron Angle and 2012 with Missouri\u2019s Todd Akin). Two years ago, Republicans had a net loss of one Senate seat as Democrats retained control of the chamber in a midterm election when Biden had approval ratings in the low 40s. Again, the GOP ran several unpopular candidates (e.g., Mehmet Oz in Pennsylvania), while Democrats ran relatively popular ones (e.g., Mark Kelly in Arizona) Back to the math and map Still, it\u2019s hard to ignore Republicans\u2019 advantage in 2024 with the math and the map. Senate Democrats have no margin for error, and they are unlikely to win all seven of their seats currently seen as competitive. The past two presidential cycles tell the tale: Just one state (Maine in 2020) voted differently in the presidential and Senate races. Trump likely holds a comfortable polling advantage of at least 5 points over Biden right now in Arizona, Nevada, Montana and Ohio. His lead in Montana is likely in the double digits. Putting aside the polls, Montana and Ohio were not competitive on the presidential level in either 2016 or 2020 and likely won\u2019t be this fall. For Democrats to have any chance of holding the Senate, Republicans would have to lose all these Senate races. Then they\u2019d have to lose in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin \u2013 all states that Trump could very well win again. Republicans would also have to lose in Maryland \u2013 where Biden will almost certainly win in a blowout, but where GOP former Gov. Larry Hogan has been competitive in the polling. Republicans may be prone to blowing it when it comes to Senate races. But I\u2019m not even sure the Washington Generals of Senate races can blow this one. As a memorable \u201cSimpsons\u201d episode once put it, Republicans may finally be \u201cdue.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/18/politics/senate-republicans-election-control/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/20/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_19_politics_biden-morehouse-commencement", "text": "President Joe Biden touted his administration\u2019s efforts to place Black Americans into the highest echelons of political power during a Sunday commencement address at Morehouse College, while also acknowledging the anguish simmering among young people across the US over the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. The president, speaking to graduates at a preeminent college for Black men, delivered a forceful call for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in Gaza paired with the release of Israeli hostages \u2013 while urging a long-term political solution to the crisis. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening in Gaza and Israel is heartbreaking: Hamas\u2019 vicious attack on Israel, killing innocent lives and holding people hostage; innocent Palestinians caught in the middle of all this \u2013 men, women and children killed or displaced and in desperate need of water, food and medicine,\u201d the president said. Biden faced a delicate balancing act ahead of his speech at Morehouse, where some students and faculty members opposed the president\u2019s presence on campus because of his stalwart support for Israel\u2019s campaign against Hamas. The White House worked for weeks to quell concerns, and it hoped the address would give Biden an opportunity to better connect with young Black men, a group that has been increasingly moving away from the president, according to recent polls. Biden and his campaign know the support of Black Americans will be critical for his chances of returning to the White House \u2013 especially in battlegrounds such as Georgia, where the president delivered Morehouse\u2019s commencement, and Michigan, where he travels later Sunday to attend an NAACP dinner. Prior to Biden\u2019s remarks, the school\u2019s valedictorian in his speech invoked the name of one of its most famous alumni, the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., to call for an end to the violence in Gaza. DeAngelo\u00a0Fletcher said it was his \u201cstance as a Morehouse Man \u2013 nay, as a human being \u2013 to call for an immediate and permanent ceasefire in the Gaza Strip.\u201d And as Biden began speaking, some graduates took part in a silent protest; one unfurled a Palestinian flag, while a handful of others turned their backs to the president. But Biden delivered his speech without any noticeable interruptions. Biden acknowledged young Americans\u2019 frustrations about the crisis in the Middle East and said the issue hits close to home. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the hardest, most complicated problems in the world, and there\u2019s nothing easy about it \u2013 I know it angers and frustrates many of you, including my family,\u201d Biden said. CNN has previously reported\u00a0first lady Jill Biden has privately expressed concern\u00a0over the humanitarian toll in Gaza. He added: \u201cI know it breaks your heart. It breaks mine as well.\u201d Democratic presidential candidates have enjoyed the support of Black Americans since the Civil Rights Movement, and Biden\u2019s history with the community runs deep. But polling has shown an erosion in support for the president from Black voters dissatisfied with his handling of the economy and his support for Israel. Spending much of his speech focused on democracy, Biden said there has been a recent national effort to obfuscate America\u2019s historical wrongs against its Black citizens. \u201cI never thought I\u2019d be a president at a time when there\u2019s a national effort to ban books,\u201d Biden said. \u201cNot to write history, but to erase history. They don\u2019t see you in the future of America. But they\u2019re wrong. To me, we make history, not erase it. We know Black history is American history.\u201d Extremist forces, Biden told the group of male graduates, peddle falsehoods about what masculinity is about. \u201cTheir idea of being a man is toxic. I ran into them all the time when I was younger. \u2026 But that\u2019s not you, that\u2019s not us. You all know and demonstrate what it really means to be a man,\u201d he said. Trumpeting his support for the nation\u2019s historically Black colleges and universities, Biden said he had \u201cno doubt a Morehouse man will be president one day \u2013 just after an AKA from Howard.\u201d The remark seemed to demonstrate Biden\u2019s hopes for the political future of Vice President Kamala Harris, a member of the historically Black Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority who graduated from the Washington, DC, HBCU. Over the last several months, Biden has largely shied away from addressing large crowds of young people on college campuses, a change that came shortly after his January remarks on abortion rights at Virginia\u2019s George Mason University were interrupted more than a dozen times by protesters outraged at his continued support for Israel in its war in Gaza. Since then, and as the death toll in Gaza of civilians, aid workers and journalists has continued to rise, that anger has only spread. More than 1,360 student demonstrations have taken place on campuses across the country from October 7 to May 3, according to data compiled by the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project. The overwhelming majority of those demonstrations \u2013 97% \u2013 have been peaceful, though isolated cases of property destruction and violence have gained widespread attention. Those instances reached a crescendo in late April and early May, when students at Columbia University overtook some university buildings, an encampment at the University of Texas in Austin was forcefully dispersed by police, and counterprotesters at UCLA launched an hourslong attack on a pro-Palestinian encampment. Those cases of campus turmoil prompted Biden, in brief remarks from the White House earlier this month, to denounce some of the actions of campus protesters. \u201cI understand people have strong feelings of deep convictions,\u201d Biden said at the time. \u201cIn America, we respect the right and protect the right for them to express that. But it doesn\u2019t mean anything goes.\u201d While dissent is \u201cessential to democracy,\u201d Biden said in those remarks, it \u201cmust never lead to disorder, or to denying the rights of others.\u201d Biden\u2019s Morehouse commencement was the latest in a series of efforts undertaken by the president in recent days to both acknowledge the nation\u2019s historic racial shortcomings while simultaneously addressing its next generation of Black leaders. The president on Thursday met with the plaintiffs of the historic Brown v. Board of Education case that overturned racial segregation in schools 70 years ago. During that meeting, some of the plaintiffs\u2019 relatives urged him to make the case\u2019s anniversary a national holiday. On Friday, Biden delivered remarks at the National Museum of African American History and Culture and spoke with members of the Divine Nine, a group of historic Black fraternities and sororities. Biden\u2019s stop at Morehouse is the second time he visited the college during his presidency. In 2022, both Biden and Harris delivered a speech on voting rights at the college.

Nguyen, 29, was a neuro ICU nurse, often treating patients who suffered a stroke or had brain cancer. Stressful enough, and then Covid-19 hit. \u201cWe were right there \u2013 frontline,\u201d Nguyen told us in an interview. \u201cThere were all these battles about whether or not we should be vaccinated. \u2026 Seeing all the death didn\u2019t help either.\u201d So Nguyen left her nursing job and became an entrepreneur, opening a boba tea shop in a place that, like her, is in the middle of giant change. \u201cTwo or three years ago, I would definitely be in scrubs. I would be tired,\u201d Nguyen said. \u201cNowadays, if you come into the shop, you will see I am always happy. There is just this different air \u2013 that I feel I can bring something to the community.\u201d Decatur is in DeKalb County, one of the growing Atlanta suburbs that in 2020 rebuked Donald Trump and helped Joe Biden flip Georgia blue and win the White House. Trump\u2019s caustic tone is one source of his suburban struggles; his erratic handling of the Covid-19 pandemic \u2013 things like questioning science and suggesting ingesting bleach might help \u2013 made things worse. \u201cI definitely did not want Trump to win again,\u201d Nguyen said. Yet she couldn\u2019t bring herself to vote for Biden and didn\u2019t vote that year. \u201cBecause he was out of touch with our generation,\u201d Nguyen said. This year, Nguyen says she will vote, and every few months she allows a local voter registration group to set up tables at Rebel. She still has reservations about Biden, including his age and his handling of the Israel-Hamas conflict. But she sees voting as essential. \u201cThe battle that is going on right now with abortion, I think that is something that speaks to me,\u201d Nguyen said. Still, she is undecided because of her qualms about Biden. But she\u2019s not a Trump fan. And looking at Georgia\u2019s 2020 math, she said, \u201cGoing third party, it feels like you are throwing your vote away.\u201d That 2020 margin was just shy of 12,000 votes, so every shift matters here. Our visit was part of a CNN project to track the 2024 campaign through the eyes and experiences of voters who live in the battleground states \u2013 and the communities within them \u2013 that will determine the presidential winner. That Georgia is among them is still a bit of a shock to locals. \u201cI never thought that could happen,\u201d Nguyen said. \u201cI was, like, that\u2019s awesome.\u201d Explaining Georgia\u2019s suburban evolution Jan and Celia Gardner are conservatives and consistent Republican voters living Georgia\u2019s political change. They bought a home in the DeKalb enclave of Dunwoody 27 years ago. \u201cPretty much a conservative community,\u201d is how Jan Gardner remembers it back then. \u201cWe are now a split community.\u201d The Gardners wish Trump would tone down his rhetoric but are loyal Republicans who see Biden as weak and believe the former president would lower taxes and improve border security. Jan Gardner says it is time to move on from debates about the 2020 election results, but he does echo many other Trump grievances. \u201cI don\u2019t think we trust the DOJ,\u201d he said of the Justice Department. \u201cI don\u2019t think we trust the FBI. I don\u2019t think we trust the CIA. We don\u2019t trust most of government. We just don\u2019t.\u201d Their street is trademark suburbia. Neat lawns. Spring flowers in bloom. Trees filling in green. It\u2019s the kind of place people take evening strolls, walk the dogs, watch the kids play. All that, Jan Gardner says, is a constant of the past quarter century. One change: people are much more hesitant to talk politics. Schools come up. Traffic. Local taxes. \u201cThat\u2019s pretty much where it stops,\u201d Jan Gardner said. \u201cYou have a pretty good idea of why.\u201d Jan Gardner is retired. Celia runs a small travel agency. A getting-to-know-you conversation around the kitchen counter is engaging and entertaining. But these days, they said, putting people with different political views in the chairs is too risky. A visitor asks this: Why can\u2019t politics be fun? \u201cIt is as long as everybody\u2019s thinking the same way,\u201d Celia Gardner said. It would be easy to overlook DeKalb County\u2019s role in the 2020 stunner here, because it was at the forefront of Georgia\u2019s demographic and political shift. In the 2000 Census, DeKalb was majority Black \u2013 54% \u2013 and that number was up just a tad 20 years later. Over that time, the percentage of White DeKalb residents dropped a bit, while the Latino and Asian populations grew. What\u2019s really driving America\u2019s suburban shift blue, however, is education level: 36% of DeKalb residents had a bachelor\u2019s degree or higher in 2000; it is now 47%. In the 2000 election, Democrat Al Gore received 70% in DeKalb; in 2020, Biden won 83%. An inclination to vote third-party \u2013 unless it\u2019s close The suburban shift is even more pronounced in Gwinnett County. In 2000, Gwinnett had a population of 588,448 residents; 67% were White and 34% had a bachelor\u2019s degree or higher. George W. Bush won the county with 64%. Now, Gwinnett\u2019s population is approaching 1 million, the White share of the population is down to 32% and the percentage of county residents with at least four years of college is up to 39%. Biden won Gwinnett County with 58%. \u201cI\u2019ve seen a lot of change, a lot more diversity which is good,\u201d said Kim Cavaliere, a school nurse who moved to Gwinnett County two decades ago. \u201cI see a lot of growth. \u2026 Probably too much growth.\u201d Ask Cavaliere to list her big issues, and you get health care, prescription drug costs, abortion rights, opposition to the availability of assault-style rifles. \u201cDemocrat, right,\u201d she said with a laugh. But Cavaliere has lost faith in both national political parties and voted for third-party candidates in both 2016 and 2020. She just might go that route again this November. \u201cI just don\u2019t feel comfortable with Biden\u2019s age and I don\u2019t feel comfortable with Trump\u2019s mouth,\u201d Cavaliere said. Count Cavaliere as among those stunned by the 2020 result here. \u201cI was actually in shock,\u201d she said. Knowing Georgia is now a battleground could influence Cavaliere\u2019s 2024 decision. \u201cHis age is really concerning to me,\u201d she said of the 81-year-old president. Plus, Cavaliere added: \u201cWith Biden comes the vice president that I know nothing about and who hasn\u2019t really done anything honestly that I can be happy with.\u201d Cavaliere speaks nostalgically of the pre-Covid Trump economy but said she could never vote for him because of his erratic behavior as president, culminating with his actions on January 6, 2021. \u201cThe way he talks. The way he runs his mouth and get, you know, people going and different groups going and fighting,\u201d Cavaliere said. She\u2019s still inclined to vote third-party again but is perhaps open to reconsidering if Georgia could settle a close race. \u201cYou have two people and I just don\u2019t have a lot of faith in either one,\u201d she said. \u201cBut as far as being a little more secure, as far as being a little bit more rational \u2013 Biden. \u2026 I might not have a choice.\u201d Carey Fulks wants to keep Georgia blue but he, too, wishes he had a different choice. \u201cFor all of the negative things you can say about the Republicans, at least they have people out there running who seem passionate,\u201d said Fulks, 35. He moved back in with his parents during Covid-19 and is skeptical when he hears Biden describe the economy as booming. \u201cPart-time substitute teacher, part-time DoorDasher, part-time everything, almost,\u201d is how Fulks describes his economy. \u201cAll I could find at the moment. Just taking jobs as they come.\u201d He is back in the Grove Park neighborhood where he grew up, and sees a lot of change here in Atlanta. \u201cWe\u2019re a transient city,\u201d Fulks said. \u201cSo most people who are here aren\u2019t from here.\u201d Biden won 73% of the vote in Fulton County \u2013 Atlanta and the closest suburbs \u2013 and high turnout will again be critical to his Georgia chances. Fulks will be there for the president, though he describes his motivation as \u201cmore against Trump, probably.\u201d Adjusting to the realities of living in a purple state Hall County is about an hour\u2019s drive north of downtown Atlanta, less from most of DeKalb or Gwinnett. It is rural, and reliably red \u2013 Trump won 71% of the county vote in 2020. Matt Vrahiotes fits right in here \u2013 Christian, conservative, Republican. \u201cI try to vote with my Bible, I really do,\u201d Vrahiotes said an an interview. \u201cI try to think: what is the moral thing to do? What is the right thing to do? But it\u2019s been a little harder over the past couple of years to pick a candidate that I think fits what I believe and what I like.\u201d Eight years ago, Vrahiotes and his wife opened Sweet Acre Farms, a fruit winery tucked into the rolling hills of Alto, a tiny town of about 1,000 people. \u201cThe first winery in Hall County since Prohibition,\u201d Vrahiotes said. We spoke just as Trump\u2019s first criminal trial was getting under way \u2013 the New York case related to a hush money payment to an adult film actress. \u201cIt sounds crazy,\u201d Vrahiotes said. \u201cIt sounds like an irresponsible person, an irresponsible thing to do.\u201d He added, though, that he has \u201cthings that are morally in question for both\u201d Biden and Trump. Vrahiotes supported Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in the GOP primaries and wishes someone other than Trump had won. \u201cI\u2019m not a Trumper,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not somebody who\u2019s got the flag in the back of my truck running around and that sort of thing. Honestly, I wish there was another candidate who would have come through the primaries. \u2026 I like to call myself a reasonable Republican.\u201d His issue list leans Republican. But his qualms about Trump have him shopping. \u201cAt this point, I really don\u2019t know,\u201d he said. \u201cKennedy is somebody we could also kind of take into consideration,\u201d he added, referring to independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Again, in a state where every shift matters, Vrahiotes is aware a third-party vote in Hall County could, in the end, help Biden. \u201cBut you also have to vote the way you feel it needs to be voted for,\u201d Vrahiotes said. Whether Vrahiotes will ultimately tell us his choice is an open question, his caution born of two things: Georgia\u2019s newfound battleground status and the political leanings of the customers who fill the winery\u2019s tasting room. \u201cYou really have to be careful about the things that you do and the things that you say,\u201d Vrahiotes said.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s part of being a small business owner. You are in a purple state. You have 50% one way and 50% the other.\u201d Vrahioties did tell us he voted for Trump in 2016. But he declined to say who he voted for in 2020 \u2013 when Georgia\u2019s flip blue made things here a lot more complicated. \u201cAtlanta\u2019s not far from here \u2013 it\u2019s an hour away,\u201d Vrahiotes said. \u201cI literally turn bottles of wine into shoes for my kids and registration for soccer. If I sit here and ostracize 50% of my community, or 50% of my customers \u2026 it could hurt me. It could hurt my business tremendously. Because as of late, people are dividing themselves. You\u2019re for this guy or you\u2019re for this guy. And it\u2019s hard, it\u2019s really hard to play the middle.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/24/politics/georgia-suburban-shift-2024-election/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/20/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_17_politics_justice-samuel-alito-flag-home", "text": "Justice Samuel Alito sought to head off mounting criticism Friday over a report that an inverted American flag was flown at his house in January 2021, telling Fox News that his wife hoisted the symbol of discontent in response to profane signs in the neighborhood. Alito said that a neighbor had posted a sign saying \u201cF**k Trump\u201d near a school bus stop and then a sign attacking his wife, Martha-Ann Alito. On a walk, the justice told Fox, the Alitos got into an argument with the neighbor, who used the term \u201cc**t\u201d at one point. His wife then flew the inverted flag. A growing chorus of Democratic lawmakers and ethics experts lobbed criticism at the Supreme Court in response to the report and demanded that Alito recuse himself from cases involving the 2020 presidential election and January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol. The upside-down flag was a symbol for former President Donald Trump\u2019s supporters who falsely claimed widespread fraud in the presidential election. \u201cThis stuff\u2019s not normal,\u201d Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, a Democrat, told CNN on Friday. \u201cI\u2019m just stunned that we would ever have had to have a Supreme Court justice explain why his wife was flying a flag upside down in response to an \u2026 insurrection.\u201d The New York Times published on Thursday a photograph of the flag that it said was seen at the justice\u2019s home in Alexandria, Virginia, on January 17, 2021, days before President Joe Biden\u2019s inauguration. Alito told the Times he had \u201cno involvement\u201d in the flag\u2019s hanging and said it was placed there \u201cbriefly.\u201d There was little sign of political tension Friday in the quiet suburban neighborhood outside Washington, DC, where Alito lives. On his leafy street near the Potomac River, the flagpole was barren. Neighbors who spoke to CNN said the Alitos were \u201cgreat neighbors\u201d and described Martha-Ann Alito as \u201cnice\u201d and \u201ckind.\u201d Neighbors CNN spoke with said they recalled the flag being inverted but said they didn\u2019t know what it meant and there was no public reaction at the time. \u201cIt\u2019s her right,\u201d one neighbor said, adding that if she wanted to hang up the Gadsden flag or any other symbol, she had the right to do so. A spokeswoman for the Supreme Court has not respond to CNN\u2019s requests for comment. Democrats and court critics call for recusal Alito\u2019s explanation hasn\u2019t satisfied critics, who noted the Supreme Court is hearing cases this year involving the aftermath of the 2020 election. Several Democratic members of Congress have called for Alito to recuse himself from cases involving the 2020 election, including the case against Trump for his alleged efforts to overturn the election \u2013 which is currently on hold as the Supreme Court weighs what role presidential immunity may play in the case. Rep. Hank Johnson, a Georgia Democrat who serves on the House Judiciary Committee, described Alito and Justice Clarence Thomas as \u201dMAGA kindred spirits.\u201d \u201cBy their obvious bias, both Thomas and Alito must recuse themselves from participating in the Supreme Court\u2019s consideration of the case involving Trump\u2019s immunity claim, and other matters arising from the January 6 insurrection,\u201d Johnson said in a statement. \u201cTheir refusal to recuse will further erode public trust and confidence in the Supreme Court, and in the rule of law the court has a duty to uphold.\u201d Sen. Dick Durbin, the Illinois Democrat and chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said the incident was the \u201clatest proof\u201d that Congress should pass ethics reform for the high court. \u201cFlying an upside-down American flag \u2014 a symbol of the so-called \u2018Stop the Steal\u2019 movement \u2014 clearly creates the appearance of bias,\u201d Durbin said in a statement. \u201cJustice Alito should recuse himself immediately from cases related to the 2020 election and the January 6th insurrection, including the question of the former president\u2019s immunity.\u201d Republicans were, at least initially, more muted in their response \u2014 or didn\u2019t address the criticism. Sen. Tom Cotton, an Arkansas Republican who also sits on the Judiciary Committee, blamed the media for attempting to \u201cincite another mob to try to intimidate justices, harass them at home, or worse.\u201d South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. Renewed calls for ethics reform The Supreme Court is weighing major cases this term tied to the 2020 election and the attack on the Capitol. In one, the justices are weighing Trump\u2019s claim of absolute immunity from special counsel Jack Smith\u2019s election subversion charges. In another, a January 6 rioter is challenging an obstruction charge filed against him by prosecutors, arguing that Congress intended that law to apply to people destroying evidence, not storming a government building. The revelations about the flag reenergized calls on the left for Congress to enact ethics rules for the Supreme Court, an effort has been stalled for months. By adopting the code of conduct last year, Chief Justice John Roberts appeared to head off Democratic efforts in Congress to impose an ethics code on the high court. But the code\u2019s provisions are self-enforced, and many of the court\u2019s critics argue the document doesn\u2019t adequately address scandals that have plagued the high court for years. \u201cIf\u00a0a judge on\u00a0any\u00a0other federal court had done this, the allegation would be investigated because it calls into question a person\u2019s ability to fairly decide a case,\u201d Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Rhode Island Democrat and member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, told CNN in a statement. \u201cThrough a long string of problematic behavior that has leaked out in the press, the far-right justices have demonstrated that they too should be subject to an enforceable ethics code,\u201d Whitehouse said. \u201cThey are not capable of policing themselves.\u201d News of the flag landed at a critical moment in the Supreme Court\u2019s term, as the justices race to finish opinions before their self-imposed end-of-June deadline. Public support for the court has remained near historic lows since the overturning of Roe v. Wade in 2022. And there have been signs that the combination of controversial cases and ethics scandals have frayed relationships internally. \u201cDisplaying a political symbol like this, with a clear message about the 2020 election given the timing, in the front yard of one\u2019s home falls under this code provision, and Justice Alito should disqualify himself from cases related to the 2020 election challenges,\u201d said Renee Knake Jefferson, a law professor at the University of Houston Law Center. \u201cBut the code does not require him to do so,\u201d Jefferson added. \u201cUltimately, it is his decision alone to make.\u201d This story has been updated with additional developments.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/17/politics/justice-samuel-alito-flag-home/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/20/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_16_politics_nicole-shanahan-robert-kennedy-abortion", "text": "Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\u2019s campaign said late Thursday that he supports restricting abortion access at \u201cfetal viability\u201d and that comments from running mate Nicole Shanahan \u2014 about the campaign supporting federal limits \u201cbetween 15 and 18 weeks\u201d of gestation \u2014 do not reflect Kennedy\u2019s views. It\u2019s just the latest mixed messaging over the campaign\u2019s abortion position after it\u00a0walked back recent comments\u00a0Kennedy made in opposition to government limits. \u201cMr. Kennedy\u2019s position differs from Ms. Shanahan\u2019s, in that he believes the cutoff should be at fetal viability. But both are aligned with the emerging national consensus of no restrictions up till a certain point and restrictions thereafter,\u201d campaign spokesperson Stefanie Spear told CNN. Most experts say fetal viability occurs at around 23-24 weeks of gestation. Shanahan said in an interview on the \u201cCartier Family\u201d podcast released Wednesday that the Kennedy campaign \u201cvery much supports limits\u201d on abortion access, explaining that the independent presidential candidate arrived at the position after conversations with both abortion rights advocates and anti-abortion supporters on his campaign. \u201cThe campaign stance right now is very much, you know, looking at terms and limits, and the campaign very much supports limits on abortion,\u201d she said. When asked at what period the Kennedy campaign would want to set limits on abortion, Shanahan responded, \u201cIt, you know, moves around between 15 and 18 weeks.\u201d The divergence between the running mates\u2019 comments is only the latest in the Kennedy\u2019s campaign\u2019s changing viewpoints on abortion, which have ranged from total opposition to government limits to support for abortion restrictions in the final months of pregnancy in line with the framework created through Roe v. Wade. Kennedy said in a podcast interview released last week that he opposes any government limits on abortion access.\u00a0When asked if he supported keeping abortion legal\u00a0\u201ceven if it\u2019s full term\u201d \u2013 referring to the possibility of an abortion near the expected delivery date of a child \u2013 Kennedy responded affirmatively. His comments inspired blowback from the anti-abortion group Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, which said his comments made him \u201cunacceptable to million of pro-life voters nationwide.\u201d Angela Stanton King, a Kennedy campaign adviser who has guided him on abortion policies, criminal justice and Black voter outreach, publicly denounced Kennedy\u2019s comments in social media posts. Kennedy subsequently walked back\u00a0his\u00a0comment the following day\u00a0after speaking with campaign staff, including Stanton King. In a social media post clarifying his position, he said\u00a0\u201cabortion should be legal up until a certain number of weeks\u201d\u00a0and that abortion should be restricted \u201cin the final months of pregnancy.\u201d In his statement, Kennedy did not say what he believed to be an appropriate limit on abortion access but\u00a0indicated\u00a0support for restrictions based on the framework\u00a0created\u00a0through Roe v. Wade, which established a constitutional right to abortion before fetal viability. \u201cI support the emerging consensus that abortion should be unrestricted up until a certain point. I believe that point should be when the baby is viable outside the womb,\u201d Kennedy said in the statement last week. \u201cTherefore I would allow appropriate restrictions on abortion in the final months of pregnancy, just as Roe v. Wade did.\u201d Kennedy himself previously expressed support for a federal abortion restriction at three months while he was running for president as a Democrat last year, but his campaign quickly walked back that position. In the new interview, Shanahan also expressed support for individual states deciding on abortion access, echoing Kennedy\u2019s skepticism of the federal government regulating health care. But she said she\u2019s concerned state-level abortion restrictions could make the issue \u201cover-politicized.\u201d \u201cI think that the trend towards, you know, states making these decisions is good. The thing that makes me worried in those instances is it becoming, again, over-politicized for election reasons, and then swinging too far,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause, you know, even very religious people in this country felt that, you know, the overall political politicization of this issue has led to stances that have been more extreme than they even intended.\u201d Democrats have seized on Shanahan\u2019s openness to letting individual states determine abortion access. Lis Smith, who is leading the efforts to combat third-party candidates at the Democratic National Committee, blasted the Kennedy-Shanahan ticket for being untrustworthy on the issue of reproductive rights. \u201cWow. When Nicole Shanahan sees state after state banning abortion, she thinks it\u2019s \u2018good.\u2019 This after Robert Kennedy Jr. said he would sign a national abortion ban. They CANNOT be trusted on abortion rights,\u201d Smith wrote on social media Thursday. Shanahan fired back, accusing Smith of \u201ctaking cheap shots\u201d at her and misrepresenting her policy position. \u201cI said allowing communities to work it out for themselves is good. Bringing women\u2019s choice closer to women is a positive thing,\u201d Shanahan responded. \u201cLet\u2019s agree that women in our age group are struggling to build the families they want and do something about that, rather than airlifting one word from a two-minute video and taking cheap shots.\u201d A statement from the DNC later accused Kennedy of hiding from his \u201cabortion extremism\u201d while highlighting state-level abortion restrictions that, the committee asserted, puts \u201cwomen\u2019s lives at risk.\u201d \u201cKicking it down to the states has led to dangerous abortion bans from Alabama to North Dakota, putting women\u2019s lives at risk and ripping away access to care,\u201d the statement read.

{"id": "2024_05_11_politics_trump-schedule-court-campaign", "text": "Former President Donald Trump has repeatedly claimed that his criminal trial in Manhattan has prevented him from campaigning in key swing states. \u201cI should be right now in Pennsylvania, in Florida, in many other states, North Carolina, Georgia - campaigning,\u201d Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, told reporters outside the courtroom on the second day of the trial in April. He made\u00a0similar\u00a0comments in the courthouse hallway on subsequent days,\u00a0saying\u00a0that, if not for the trial he baselessly blamed on President Joe Biden, he was \u201csupposed to be\u201d in Ohio, New Hampshire and South Carolina. It\u2019s certainly possible that Trump would have been campaigning in all of those states if there was no trial. But a review of his activities over the trial\u2019s first four weeks shows that he has done little campaign travel, and held few public campaign events, on days off from court. Instead, he has spent most of his 12 court-free days out of voters\u2019 view at his properties in New York, New Jersey and Florida. And he did not use any of those 12 court-free days to visit Pennsylvania, Georgia, South Carolina, Ohio or New Hampshire, states he asserted the trial was preventing him from visiting. (He is\u00a0scheduled\u00a0to visit Ohio for a fundraiser\u00a0on May 15.) No public events on most free days Trump\u2019s trial is not in session on Wednesdays, Saturdays and Sundays, and the judge also scheduled one Monday off in late April.\u00a0As of this Saturday, May 11,\u00a0that left Trump with 12 court-free days to do as he pleased, compared to 15 days where he was required in court, in the\u00a027 days\u00a0beginning with the\u00a0opening of jury selection on April 15. Trump held no public events on\u00a0seven of the 12 court-free days. And it was no public events on eight of the 12 days\u00a0if you don\u2019t count his one-minute-long appearance for the cameras prior to a private meeting with the president of Poland at Trump Tower in New York City. Trump has visited few swing states since the trial began Trump has done some campaign travel during the trial. He held campaign rallies in the swing states of\u00a0Wisconsin and Michigan on one court-free Wednesday in May, and he booked a weekend April rally in the swing state of North Carolina that was\u00a0called off at the last minute because of severe weather.(He attended a closed-door\u00a0fundraiser\u00a0in the state earlier in the day.) He\u00a0is scheduled to hold\u00a0a rally on Saturday afternoon\u00a0in New Jersey, which has for three decades been a Democratic stronghold in presidential elections, and he\u00a0appeared in May at a Formula One race in Miami. Trump also made campaign-style appearances in Democratic-dominated New York City before or after\u00a0three\u00a0court\u00a0appearances. And he has turned the hallway outside the Manhattan courtroom into a de facto campaigning venue, regularly speaking to media cameras before and after sitting in court. But he has let the majority of the 12 off days pass\u00a0without doing any public campaign events. Instead, he has spent some of the time\u00a0golfing at his Bedminster club in New Jersey,\u00a0attending\u00a0a Republican National Committee fundraiser at his Mar-a-Lago club and residence in Florida, attending a Mar-a-Lago\u00a0dinner\u00a0for people who bought large numbers of his \u201cNFT\u201d digital trading cards, and\u00a0making phone calls and holding meetings. His complete itinerary on the off days is not known. Here is a list showing how he is known to have spent his time from the opening day of the trial, April 15,\u00a0until May 11. April 15: Court April 16: Court (made appearance at New York City bodega afterward) April 17: Day off court.

{"id": "2024_05_18_politics_white-house-democrats-border-security", "text": "The White House and top congressional Democrats are discussing a series of moves aimed at strengthening their hand on border security ahead of the first presidential debate next month. That includes potentially rolling out a sweeping executive order limiting migrants\u2019 ability to seek asylum, revisiting the stalled bipartisan border bill in the Senate, and\u00a0possibly sending\u00a0President Joe Biden\u00a0to the border, according to three sources familiar with the discussions. One of those sources said that some Democrats on Capitol Hill have encouraged White House officials to consider having the president make another visit to the border in the coming weeks. With border arrests down this year, thanks in part to Mexico stepping up its own enforcement efforts in January, the White House is looking to take advantage of a brief reprieve from one of the most politically fraught issues Biden faces in his reelection campaign. But senior administration officials are also bracing for the potential that border crossings will surge this summer, like in previous years, and\u00a0are trotting out a series of policy changes to try to dissuade migrants from journeying to the US, and convince skeptical voters they are working to tighten up immigration at the border. If officials move forward with a border visit, it would mark\u00a0Biden\u2019s second trip to the US southern border this year and third since taking office.\u00a0The discussions have not been previously reported; no trip has been announced. A White House spokesperson told CNN that no border trip for Biden is under consideration at the moment. White House officials are in discussion with Senate Democrats about reviving the border policy package that failed to advance earlier this year, according to the two sources\u2014another sign of ongoing efforts meant to show Democrats are aggressive on border security, an issue that\u2019s been a political liability for the party and the president. The pressure on Congress also reflects the limited tools the administration has at its disposal to affect the situation on the ground over the next few months. Discussions are ongoing on when the border executive action will be rolled out, according to sources, who say that one of the considerations is doing so after Mexico\u2019s election in early June and potentially before the first presidential debate. The White House is hoping to stave off another crisis and keep the focus on congressional Republicans who backed away from the border bill that included some of the toughest border security measures in recent memory, multiple sources told CNN. Aides say Senate Democrats expect to bring back up for a vote the border security bill that was blocked by Republicans after former President Donald Trump came out against the deal.\u00a0Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Connecticut Democrat Chris Murphy, who cut a deal with Republicans on the long-sought border security measure, have been heavily signaling their intention, though nothing has been formally announced. On the campaign trail, Biden has continued to hammer Republicans over the measure. \u201cAfter months, we finally came up with the strongest border bill, the most comprehensive immigration reform in decades,\u201d Biden said at a campaign fundraiser in California this month. \u201cThe majority of the House and Senate members strongly support this. But politics derailed it.\u201d New guidance and regulations Over recent weeks, the Biden administration has\u00a0rolled out new guidance and regulations that would tighten the immigration system to quickly reject migrants who are ineligible for asylum, and speed up court cases for some migrants \u2014 measures Biden officials hope will, in part, dissuade people from journeying north. They\u2019ve also cracked down on countries facilitating irregular migration, like Nicaragua, by imposing visa restrictions\u00a0on over 250 members of the\u00a0Nicaraguan government, nongovernmental actors, and their immediate family members. \u201cIn order to meet the current moment, the administration has taken unprecedented steps to leverage existing resources, exercise our legal authorities and coordinate with our federal and international partners to reduce irregular migration and manage our borders in a safe and orderly way,\u201d a senior administration official told reporters this week. Also under consideration is a sweeping\u00a0executive action\u00a0that would\u00a0restrict\u00a0migrants\u2019 ability to seek asylum at the US-Mexico border if they crossed illegally \u2014 a maneuver\u00a0reminiscent of\u00a0controversial action from the Trump era.\u00a0It\u00a0involves using an authority known as 212f between ports of entry to try to clamp down on unlawful border crossings. The White House has repeatedly stressed the unique challenges it faces in trying to control record migration across the Western hemisphere that\u2019s resulted in thousands of migrants at the US-Mexico border and overwhelmed federal resources. But voters appear unconvinced, as Biden continues to lag Trump on border security in polls. In recent months, Mexico has surged operations to obstruct smuggling and movement to the border, targeting smugglers for prosecution, moving migrants away from the border and engaging in joint enforcement operations along the US southern border with federal authorities, according to Homeland Security officials. In April, Border Patrol recorded more than 128,000 migrant encounters between ports of entry, down from 137,480 in March, according to US Customs and Border Protection data. Last April, Border Patrol apprehended more than 183,000 migrants. But Homeland Security officials are now preparing for an anticipated rise in border crossings, consistent with previous years when numbers tick up in the summer, including shifting resources to meet a potential surge and getting personnel in place. The White House is also bolstering its immigration team following anticipated staff departures earlier this year and plans to bring on one of the administration\u2019s chief architects of border policy, Blas Nunez-Neto, who currently serves as an assistant secretary at the Department of Homeland Security, to work even more closely with Biden\u2019s aides. Upcoming election in Mexico One wildcard is the upcoming election in Mexico slated for June 2, raising uncertainty in the minds of Biden officials about what, if anything, will change with a key partner when it comes to border cooperation at a critical moment. \u201cWhether we\u2019re talking about elections in Mexico or here in the US, it always provokes a level of uncertainty with everyone, generally, but especially in the migrant population,\u201d a Homeland Security official told CNN. US and Mexican officials are in touch on an almost daily basis and high-level delegations have traveled back and forth as the two countries try to stem the flow of migration. Current and former US officials describe Biden and Mexico\u2019s President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador relationship as friendly and professional. Late last month, Biden spoke to Lopez Obrador about migration management, marking the second call between the two leaders this year. \u201cIn the short term, the two leaders ordered their national security teams to work together to immediately implement concrete measures to significantly reduce irregular border crossings while protecting human rights,\u201d according to a White House readout. Officials expect that a new administration in Mexico would likely continue cooperating with the US on migration given years of partnership, but it\u2019s unclear how migrants \u2014 and especially, smugglers \u2014 might plot their next moves in a moment of government transition. Mexican officials are also observing another surge of migrants coming from further south at a time where their own resources are already stretched. \u201cWhat the Mexican government has done is slow people down by bussing them south and rationing out permits for some nationalities to move across the country,\u201d said Andrew Selee, president of the nonpartisan think tank, Migration Policy Institute. \u201cBut it\u2019s not a long-term strategy to stop people and return them to their country of origin. That\u2019s what\u2019s missing in all of this,\u201d he added.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/18/politics/white-house-democrats-border-security/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/20/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_16_politics_cohen-cross-examination-2024-election", "text": "Donald Trump\u2019s former fixer Michael Cohen goes back on the stand Thursday braced for another bruising day of cross-examination that is shaping up as the most crucial chapter in the first criminal trial of a former president. Cohen is the last prosecution witness, and his testimony is a sign that the trial \u2013 arising from a hush money payment Trump allegedly made to an adult film star and efforts to cover it up \u2013 is moving swiftly toward a climax that could rock the last five months of the election. Trump\u2019s self-described former \u201cthug\u201d endured a withering grilling Tuesday, as Trump\u2019s lawyer Todd Blanche sought to puncture his credibility, portraying him as a liar obsessed with the ex-president who was raking in a fortune with his quest to bring him down. CNN\u2019s Paula Reid reported that Blanche \u2013 whose cross-examination some outside observers said was erratic and over personalized on Tuesday \u2013 will strike directly at charges that Trump ordered the payment to cover up an alleged affair to mislead voters in an early instance of election interference in 2016. (Trump denies the affair and has pleaded not guilty in the case). Blanche is also expected to challenge Cohen\u2019s memory of conversations with Trump. And he will seek to sow doubt within jurors\u2019 minds that a decision of such magnitude should be made on the word of Cohen alone, Reid reported. Two significant strategic questions remain unanswered. The first centers on whether the presumptive GOP nominee will testify \u2014 after initially signaling he would like to despite the view of many legal experts that he\u2019d be courting disaster on the stand. It\u2019s also unclear how many witnesses the defense will call, or whether Trump\u2019s attorneys will make a bold argument that the state of New York has failed to meet the bar of proving Trump\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt and rest their case. However things unfold, it\u2019s obvious that following summations from both sides, the jury will retire within days to consider a verdict that will effectively decide whether, for the first time in history, a major political party will nominate a convicted felon for president. A suddenly compressed political calendar Every criminal trial is a grave process since a defendant\u2019s reputation and even liberty is on the line. But this case is especially momentous, given the identity of the accused \u2014 a former president who has about a 50-50 chance to win back the White House, according to national polls. The trial is one of several critical events weighing on the destiny of the presidential race in a suddenly compressed political calendar that means voters will be wrestling with their critical choice long before Election Day in November. For instance, long-held doubts that there\u2019d be any presidential debates were dispelled Wednesday morning as President Joe Biden threw down the gauntlet in a video, telling Trump, \u201cMake my day, pal,\u201d while his campaign suggested debates in late June and early September. Biden later said he\u2019d accepted a CNN debate on June 27. Trump quickly accepted. Later that morning, both men said they\u2019d accepted an invitation from ABC for a second debate on September 10. The sudden breakthrough means that debates will take place far earlier than usual in the campaign \u2014 even before either party has officially anointed their nominee at conventions in July for the GOP and in August for the Democrats. There\u2019s some logic to the shift because voting starts in some states as early as September. But the development also means that the nonpartisan Commission on Presidential Debates, which has hosted debates since 1988 and has angered both parties in recent years, now seems to be on borrowed time and is at risk of becoming the latest tradition to be swept away in the turbulent Trump era. The 81-year-old Biden\u2019s decision to take Trump on is a risk since any flubs attributable to his age could play into the ex-president\u2019s claim that he\u2019s not fit to serve a second term. Some commentators have also argued that Biden should not offer the implied legitimacy of the debate stage to a former president who has been indicted over an attempt to destroy democracy after the 2020 election. But Trump, himself 77, might have already hurt himself by setting a low bar that will allow the president to outperform expectations. The former president frequently comments outside the Manhattan courtroom, for example, that Biden can\u2019t string two sentences together. And any repeat of Trump\u2019s over-torqued performance in the first presidential debate in 2020 could validate Biden\u2019s claim he\u2019s extreme and a danger to the Constitution. Critical Supreme Court ruling Another key development that could weigh heavily on the campaign could occur at about the same time as the first debate. The Supreme Court is expected to deliver its decision on Trump\u2019s sweeping claims of immunity from prosecution. High court rulings are always difficult to predict. But the signs from oral arguments on the issue last month were that the justices could send the case back to lower courts for yet more litigation. That would almost certainly delay Trump\u2019s trial in his federal election interference case until after the election, meaning he wouldn\u2019t be brought to account for the worst attack on democracy in modern times before a subsequent election. The ex-president\u2019s lawyers have long sought to delay Trump\u2019s reckoning on this and other cases until after an election that could make him president again and furnish him with powers that could allow him to halt federal trials against him. Two other cases \u2014 a state one over election interference in Georgia and a federal one arising from his hoarding of classified documents at his Florida home \u2014 have also been bogged down in pre-trial litigation and are unlikely to take place before voters choose their next president. This raises the possibility that an election long expected to be mired in Trump\u2019s legal nightmares could suddenly be dominated by a different kind of political mood music. In that case, the hush money trial may be the only one held before the election. It\u2019s impossible to predict how a guilty verdict or an acquittal would influence undecided voters in swing states who will decide the identity of the next president. Some polling suggests some Republicans might think twice about picking Trump if he\u2019s a convicted felon. But the hush money case is widely considered the least serious criminal issue facing the ex-president. And Trump and his Republican supporters \u2014 including House Speaker Mike Johnson, who showed up at the courthouse Tuesday \u2014 are stepping up attempts to portray the trial as politically motivated, possibly to hedge against a possible conviction. The pre-verdict spin is another sign that a trial that\u2019s taken the country across a historic threshold may be moving toward its conclusion \u2014 at a moment when other forces that could decide the election are gathering pace.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/16/politics/cohen-cross-examination-2024-election/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/20/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_17_politics_michael-cohen-donald-trump-best-day-analysis", "text": "Donald Trump finally had a good day in court. The presumptive GOP nominee has often seemed embarrassed and infuriated by his first criminal trial, which has featured salacious expos\u00e9s of his personal life and details of his alleged attempts to cover it up. But on Thursday, he got to savor his former fixer-turned-enemy Michael Cohen wobbling on the stand under a fearsome cross-examination. Cohen appeared to be tripped up over an account of a call he\u2019d previously said under oath was to discuss Trump\u2019s hush money payment to adult film Star Stormy Daniels. It emerged under questioning on Thursday that, at least to begin with, the topic of the call was about another matter entirely. It was the kind of inconsistency that Trump\u2019s attorneys can use to try to sow reasonable doubt about Cohen\u2019s truthfulness and credibility in the mind of a single juror. That\u2019s all it would take for Trump to walk. And now, the prosecution faces a stiff challenge in repairing the damage when they get to their redirect examination of Cohen\u2019s testimony following the close of cross-examination next week. \u201cI think what happened today still is so devastating they have to do something,\u201d Ryan Goodman, a professor at NYU Law, told CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett. \u201cIf the case ended today and there were final statements, I think there would not be a conviction.\u201d Trump left court after a day in which he was supported by another posse of GOP lawmakers, including Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz, well satisfied. \u201cI think it was a very interesting day, it was a fascinating day. And it shows what a scam this whole thing is,\u201d the former president said. His hyperbolic spin and unique take on proceedings rang less hollow than usual given several positive moments for the defense in what has largely been a grim month for Trump in the courtroom. Another day of testimony from Cohen, the prosecution\u2019s critical witness, came as the case hurtled toward its climax with the judge telling lawyers to be ready to deliver summations as early as Tuesday. That means it\u2019s feasible the jury will retire to consider its verdict in the first criminal trial of a former president sometime after Memorial Day and just five months before Trump hopes to reclaim the White House. A pivotal moment On Tuesday, when the court was last in session this week, Trump\u2019s attorney Todd Blanche had what most legal experts viewed as a rough day as he embarked on the cross-examination of Cohen. But he bounced back in a big way Thursday. Blanche first spent time seeking to destroy Cohen\u2019s credibility. He highlighted the former Trump fixer\u2019s proven history of lying for his former boss and on his own behalf. And using text messages and social media posts, he established that Cohen resented Trump and wanted to see him convicted in a case in which the ex-president is accused of falsifying financial records to hide the payoff in 2016 in an early example of election interference. (He has pleaded not guilty and denied the affair with Daniels.) Then, in one of the most dramatic moments in the entire trial, Blanche drilled down on a call that Cohen placed to his boss\u2019 bodyguard, Keith Schiller, who was with Trump on October 24, 2016. Cohen had testified earlier this week that the purpose of the call was to discuss with Trump \u201cthe Stormy Daniels matter and the resolution of it.\u201d But Blanche produced a text from Cohen to Schiller before the call in which the lawyer said he wanted to get help in dealing with a 14-year-old who was prank calling him. He didn\u2019t mention Daniels in the text ahead of the conversation, which only lasted 96 seconds. \u201cThat was a lie!\u201d Blanche said, raising his voice. \u201cYou did not talk to President Trump on that night, you talked to Keith Schiller. \u2026 You can admit it.\u201d Blanche argued that it was impossible that Cohen would have had sufficient time to discuss the prank calls and then go on to update Trump about the complicated situation with Daniels. Cohen insisted, \u201cI believe I also spoke to President Trump and told him everything regarding the Stormy Daniels matter was being worked on and it\u2019s going to be resolved.\u201d Blanche then wielded a rhetorical dagger, telling Cohen: \u201cWe are not asking for your belief \u2013 this jury doesn\u2019t want to hear what you think happened.\u201d Judge Juan Merchan sustained an immediate objection from the prosecution to the comment, but Trump\u2019s lawyer had emphatically made his point. The exchange was so significant because \u2013 notwithstanding days of testimony and evidence put on by the prosecution to corroborate claims that Trump broke the law \u2013 the case still largely depends on Cohen, himself a convicted felon who has a proven record of lying. Since the burden to prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt lies with the prosecution, the exchange could raise the chances of at least one juror questioning Cohen\u2019s version of events. And it also raises the possibility that some jurors might believe that they have been lied to by Cohen earlier in the trial. If such a feeling takes hold among jurors, who have put their lives on hold to hear the case, it could be disastrous to the prosecution. \u2018A blow on the chin\u2019 No one can say how individual members of the jury will sift the evidence and competing testimony. But experienced trial lawyers immediately spotted a potential turning point. \u201cI think it has to have raised some doubt,\u201d criminal defense attorney Nikki Lotze said on CNN\u2019s \u201cThe Situation Room\u201d of Blanche\u2019s clash with Cohen. \u201cThere was testimony previously that this phone call was about X and now there are texts that suggest it is about Y \u2026 and not a lot of time for there to be a conversation about both X and Y.\u201c Jim Trusty, a former Trump attorney, also believed the exchange was significant and was cause for the ex-president to feel upbeat. \u201cThe defense set the whole trial up to be a referendum on Cohen\u2019s honesty. That is exactly where you want this fight to be, so it is a good moment,\u201d he said. When Blanche eventually wraps up his cross-examination of Cohen, the prosecution will get a chance to try to repair any damage from one of the trial\u2019s most significant moments so far. Some experts pointed out that it was only one small blip compared to a mountain of evidence, much of which looks potentially problematic for Trump. Norm Eisen, a CNN legal analyst, said that Blanche\u2019s apparent trip-up of Cohen was good professional lawyering by the defense, but he disputed the idea that the episode was devastating to the prosecution case. \u201cIt was a blow on the chin. My experience of 30 years of doing this is it takes more than one punch to knock out a witness,\u201d Eisen told CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper. Conservative lawyer and sworn Trump critic George Conway, who was also in court Thursday, told CNN that while there were some good moments for Blanche, much of his cross-examination was \u201cscattered\u201d and meandering and did not establish a strong narrative. But another less theatrical moment in Thursday\u2019s testimony may also offer the defense a strong opening in their final summation to the jury. Blanche asked Cohen about a time when he said he lied under oath to a judge in a different case because \u201cthe stakes affected you personally.\u201d Cohen agreed he had. Then Blanche asked Cohen: \u201cDoes the outcome of this trial affect you personally?\u201d Cohen answered, \u201cYes.\u201d The unspoken implication here is that if Cohen lied in a previous trial that affected him personally, why would he not do the same in a trial involving his now sworn foe, the former president? Again, the defense doesn\u2019t have to prove Cohen is lying. It just has to make one juror think it\u2019s possible \u2014 and therefore make impossible the unanimous verdict needed for conviction. Many prosecutions use potentially problematic witnesses with histories of lying and demonstrated antipathy toward the accused all the time \u2014 for instance, in organized crime cases where lower-ranking associates are used to incriminate kingpins despite their own legal vulnerabilities. So Cohen\u2019s struggles at a key moment on Thursday don\u2019t necessarily mean this case is in deep trouble. But everyone connected with the trial knew before it began that Cohen\u2019s pivotal role in this case represented a risk for the prosecution. The huge scale of that gamble was laid bare in court on Thursday.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/17/politics/michael-cohen-donald-trump-best-day-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/20/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_18_politics_politicians-blaming-wives-what-matters", "text": "Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito doesn\u2019t deny there was an upside-down American flag flying outside his house days before Joe Biden was sworn in as president, an apparent distress signal that would seem to express sympathy with the plight of Donald Trump supporters who refused to believe their guy lost the 2020 election. But Alito did offer an excuse for the flag, which had become a symbol of the \u201cStop the Steal\u201d movement before and after the election. \u201cI had no involvement whatsoever in the flying of the flag,\u201d Alito said in a written statement to The New York Times, which first reported the story this week. \u201cIt was briefly placed by Mrs. Alito in response to a neighbor\u2019s use of objectionable and personally insulting language on yard signs.\u201d So the wife did it to get back at the neighbors. Her first name is Martha-Ann, by the way. A Supreme Court justice being unmasked as having a partisan tilt wouldn\u2019t be illegal \u2013 just awkward and icky. Alito won\u2019t even have to recuse himself from any cases for possibly showing an electoral preference since there\u2019s no binding code of ethics for Supreme Court justices. And the Alito flag incident is small time compared with the direct involvement of Justice Clarence Thomas\u2019 wife Ginni in the \u201cStop the Steal\u201d rally on January 6, 2021, and her active texting with officials in the White House about how to overturn election results \u2013 something for which Thomas has not offered excuse, apology or recusal. But the \u201cMrs. defense\u201d could be used in much more serious matters than flag flying. Menendez \u2018in the dark\u2019 Take the prosecution of Sen. Bob Menendez, the New Jersey Democrat on trial in New York for federal bribery charges. Menendez\u2019s trial is severed from one of his co-defendants, his wife, Nadine. Both Mr. and Mrs. Menendez deny wrongdoing, but at the outset of his trial this week, it seemed likely that one element of his defense could be to blame his wife. The senator was \u201cin the dark\u201d on money matters, his attorney told jurors. Most of the communication referenced in the indictment is between Nadine Menendez and the New Jersey businessmen who are alleged to have coughed up gold bars and envelopes of cash, along with much more, as they sought Sen. Menendez\u2019s help. Couples behaving badly Former Rep. Duncan Hunter, a California Republican, pioneered the Mrs. defense when he and his wife were both accused of funneling campaign funds for private use. Hunter\u2019s defense was that his wife, Margaret, handled the finances in their personal lives and for his campaign. Both Hunters ultimately pleaded guilty and were later pardoned by Trump. Will it ultimately be a similar story in the prosecution of Rep. Henry Cuellar, a Texas Democrat, who has been charged in a bribery scheme along with his wife, Imelda? The Cuellars present a united front and deny all wrongdoing. Prosecutors allege payments to the couple were laundered through \u201csham consulting contracts\u201d made to \u201cfront companies\u201d owned by Mrs. Cuellar. Couples behaving badly is nothing new in US politics. Former Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr., an Illinois Democrat, and his wife, Sandra, pleaded guilty to misusing campaign funds to fuel a lavish lifestyle. Variations on the theme Former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell and his wife, Maureen, were convicted of public corruption in 2014. Their strategy at trial was to portray the former Republican governor as being in the dark about his wife\u2019s activities. A unanimous US Supreme Court, including Alito, later vacated the governor\u2019s conviction and narrowed the scope by which prosecutors can pursue bribery allegations. The Mrs. defense could conceivably be turned on its head and used by a powerful woman to blame her husband. Rep. Cori Bush, a Missouri Democrat, is under investigation for misusing funds to pay her husband for security services. Bush said in a statement that she retained her husband\u2019s security services \u201cbecause he has had extensive experience in this area, and is able to provide the necessary services at or below a fair market rate,\u201d according to CNN\u2019s report. Wives taking the blame, sometimes deservedly, is not a uniquely Washington problem. In April, an Iowa woman named Kim Taylor was sentenced to eight months in prison, according to local reports, for an unsuccessful ballot stuffing scheme to help her husband in a Republican congressional primary. The husband, Jeremy Taylor, was not charged and was later elected to the Woodbury County Board of Supervisors. Alito has strong views about marriage Blaming his wife for flying an inappropriate flag is not the only reason Alito is connected to a wider discussion of the institution of marriage. He continues to complain about the Supreme Court\u2019s 2015 decision that granted the right of marriage to same-sex couples. He grouses that the court\u2019s blessing of same-sex unions means people who think marriage should be between a man and a woman can be labeled by the government as \u201cbigots.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/18/politics/politicians-blaming-wives-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/20/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_04_09_politics_rfk-jr-campaign-official-january-6-trump", "text": "A New York-based campaign official for Robert F. Kennedy Jr. who raised the possibility that voting for the independent presidential candidate would help Donald Trump defeat President Joe Biden previously promoted false claims that the 2020 election was rigged\u00a0and attended \u201cStop the Steal\u201d rallies after the election,\u00a0including\u00a0the rally on January 6, 2021, in Washington, DC, that preceded the deadly riot at the US Capitol. Rita Palma, who has identified herself as the Kennedy campaign\u2019s state director in New York, also\u00a0repeatedly called\u00a0Trump her \u201cfavorite president,\u201d according to tweets along with comments she posted on\u00a0the conservative social media site Parler that have since been made private. According to a KFILE examination of those now-private posts, Palma also posed for a photo at the former Trump International Hotel in Washington, DC, alongside Sidney Powell \u2013 the pro-Trump attorney who pleaded guilty in Georgia\u2019s election subversion case. In February 2021,\u00a0Palma tweeted her support\u00a0for Trump as a presidential candidate in 2024 and even asked whether he could run for a third term in 2028 \u2013 which is not constitutionally allowed as a president can serve only two full terms. \u201c#Trump2024 Can he run in 2028 too?\u201d she tweeted, posting a meme that said she would vote for\u00a0Trump in 2024. In one comment, Palma dismissed suggestions from then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell that Trump was to blame for violence at the Capitol. \u201cActually the fault lies with the rigged election. Genius,\u201d she\u00a0wrote\u00a0the day after the riot. There is no indication Palma went to the Capitol or was violent on January 6, but tweets from that day show her in DC for Trump\u2019s rally. Palma later dismissed that day\u2019s violence as the work of a few attendees. \u201cJan 6 was not a riot. A small group of people were trouble. It was 99.9 peaceful, respectful. I was there,\u201d\u00a0she wrote. CNN reviewed Palma\u2019s now-private tweets on the Internet Archive Wayback Machine, where\u00a0she included the hashtag #BidenCheated 86 times from November 2020 to February 2021. Palma\u2019s promotion and attendance at \u201cStop the Steal\u201d events after the 2020 election reflects a segment of support Kennedy has received from Trump supporters, particularly as a means of helping the former president retake the White House in 2024. One of the\u00a0biggest donors\u00a0to Kennedy\u2019s super PAC, Timothy Mellon, is also a major donor to Trump. And polls have suggested Kennedy could take critical votes away from Biden. CNN\u00a0was first to report\u00a0that Palma told a gathering of New York state Republicans that efforts to put Kennedy on the ballot in New York would help \u201cget rid of Biden,\u201d which she called her \u201cNo. 1 priority.\u201d \u201cThe only way that Trump can even, remote possibility of taking New York is if Bobby is on the ballot. If it\u2019s Trump vs. Biden, Biden wins. Biden wins six days, seven days a week. With Bobby in the mix, anything can happen,\u201d Palma said in a video of the meeting viewed by CNN. \u201cThe only way for him, for Bobby, to shake it up and to get rid of Biden is if he\u2019s on the ballot in every state, including New York,\u201d she continued. The Kennedy campaign has since distanced itself from Palma. Amaryllis Fox,\u00a0Kennedy\u2019s campaign director, said in a statement posted on X that Palma was hired by the campaign as a ballot-access consultant and that she doesn\u2019t shape electoral strategy, adding that Palma\u2019s remarks in a circulated video were made as a private citizen. Palma did not respond to a CNN request for comment\u00a0but on Tuesday afternoon posted to her Facebook page: \u201cWow- look at that news cycle. I guess the MSM doesn\u2019t like little ole me exercising my 1A rights? Hi, CNN!\u201d Tweets dating to November 2020 show Palma repeatedly volunteering to go to and attending numerous pro-Trump rallies and events \u2013\u00a0even tweeting at\u00a0\u201cStop the Steal\u201d organizer Ali Alexander she would go to Georgia for a week as the state was recounting votes. \u201cWe are rooting for you\u00a0@realDonaldTrump\u00a0Bigly. YUGE rooting. Biggest fan club EVER. #WeLoveYou\u00a0#BestPresidentEver45\u00a0\u00a0#FourMoreYears,\u201d she wrote on November 19, 2020. Palma also\u00a0repeatedly\u00a0expressed\u00a0an affinity for Powell, one of Trump\u2019s election lawyers who\u00a0promoted\u00a0unhinged conspiracy theories\u00a0about nationwide vote-rigging and who filed meritless lawsuits to overturn the results. \u201cYou were born/ chosen for this fight and you will win, win, win. WE LOVE YOU, TOO!\u201d she\u00a0tweeted at\u00a0Powell. In another\u00a0tweet on December 11, 2020,\u00a0Palma called Powell \u201cMY PERSON OF THE DECADE!!\u201d and posted a photo of the pair at the former Trump International Hotel in DC. Last year, Powell\u00a0pleaded guilty\u00a0in the Georgia election subversion case, in which Trump and a host of co-defendants are accused of orchestrating a broad conspiracy aimed at overturning Biden\u2019s 2020 electoral win in the state.

DePape was sentenced to 30 years for assault and 20 years for attempted kidnapping, which will run concurrently. Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley, who presided over DePape\u2019s trial for the Northern District of California, said she had to \u201censure that the sentence reflects the seriousness of the offense.\u201d \u201cHe broke into the home of an official and violently attacked the public official\u2019s spouse. That act is unprecedented,\u201d she said. In November, a jury found DePape guilty in a San Francisco federal court of one\u00a0count of assault on the immediate family member of a federal official and a second count of attempted kidnapping of a federal official,\u00a0CNN previously reported. At the time, DePape\u2019s attorneys conceded that their client attacked the then-83-year-old Paul Pelosi, but argued that his motivation for the assault did not match the charges against him. Testifying in his own defense, DePape gave jurors a closer look at his motives before the attack, becoming emotional at times as he shared examples of conspiracy theories he felt were true. DePape recalled that he was looking for Nancy Pelosi and that her husband had not been on his list of targets. He was \u201csurprised and confused,\u201d he testified, when he found out that the congresswoman was not home. \u201cI\u2019m telling him, \u2018I have other targets, but if you stop me, I\u2019ll go through you,\u2019\u201d DePape said, recounting a conversation with Paul Pelosi, adding that he then reacted and hit Pelosi \u201cin the head,\u201d because his plan was \u201cbasically ruined.\u201d In his testimony, Pelosi recounted how he awoke from sleep the night of the attack to see a man with a hammer in his home. That man, later identified by police as DePape, asked where his wife was. \u201cShe\u2019s not here. She\u2019s in Washington,\u201d Pelosi recalled answering. He was violently struck in the head following a struggle with DePape, Pelosi said. Pelosi, who underwent surgery to repair a skull fracture and injuries to his hand and arm, told jurors that his recovery has been difficult, with spells of lightheadedness and headaches. \u201cI\u2019ve made the best effort I possibly can to not revisit this,\u201d he said at the time. In a statement filed with the court, Speaker Emerita Pelosi said the attack on her husband \u201chas had a devastating effect on three generations of our family.\u201d Pelosi added that \u201cthe break-in and violation of our domestic tranquility is having a long-lasting impact.\u201d A state case against DePape that includes charges of attempted murder, burglary and assault is expected to go to trial this summer.

{"id": "2024_03_11_politics_hur-report-investigation-what-matters", "text": "Special counsel Robert Hur, who spent a year investigating the discovery of classified material at President Joe Biden\u2019s former office and Delaware home, is back in the news. The White House, citing executive privilege, has refused to hand over to House Republicans recordings of Biden talking with Hur as well as with his ghostwriter. Transcripts of Biden\u2019s deposition by Hur have already been released. Still, Republicans on Capitol Hill are moving to hold Attorney General Merrick Garland in contempt of Congress for not complying with subpoenas for the recordings. Hur\u2019s key recommendation \u2013 that Biden not be prosecuted for his handling of material when he was a private citizen \u2013 was overshadowed when Hur released his report in February because the special counsel described the president as a sympathetic elderly man with memory problems. Biden fired back against Hur\u2019s note that he was not charged in part because a jury could potentially see him as a \u201cwell-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.\u201d \u201cI am well-meaning. And I\u2019m an elderly man. And I know what the hell I\u2019m doing,\u201d Biden said. Here\u2019s more on Hur, his report and the fallout: Who is Robert Hur? Hur was appointed by then-President Donald Trump as US attorney in Maryland in 2017. During his tenure as a federal prosecutor, which ended in 2021, he prosecuted Baltimore\u2019s then-mayor, Catherine Pugh, in a scandal involving sales of her children\u2019s book. In 2023, Hur was brought back from private practice and appointed to investigate the discovery of classified material at Biden\u2019s former office and Delaware home by Garland. The selection of a Trump-appointed former US attorney was meant to help inoculate the inquiry from allegations of political influence. What did Hur find? Hur issued a 345-page report in February, 15 months after classified material was first found in Biden\u2019s former office. Although investigators found material with classified markings and classified material within Biden\u2019s private notebooks, Hur concluded the \u201cevidence is not strong enough to establish Mr. Biden\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d When did all of this happen? For context, the material was first found in Biden\u2019s office at a time when the handling of classified material was very much in the news because of Trump\u2019s refusal to return classified material to the National Archives. The timeline goes something like this: August 2022: FBI searches Mar-a-Lago, Trump\u2019s Florida estate, as part of its yearslong effort to reclaim classified material that had been taken from the White House by the former president. September 2022: Speaking on \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d Biden responds to the Trump classified documents scandal and wonders \u201chow anyone can be that irresponsible.\u201d These words will not age well. November 2022: Classified material is discovered at the president\u2019s Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement office, a Washington, DC, think tank where Biden spent time after eight years in the Obama administration. The FBI opens an investigation one week later. Later that month, Jack Smith is appointed as special counsel to oversee multiple Trump-related investigations, including the one regarding classified documents. December 2022: Biden\u2019s personal lawyers find more classified material in his Delaware garage and inform the FBI, which dispatches agents, but does not complete a comprehensive search. January 2023: Additional classified documents are discovered in Biden\u2019s Delaware home by his lawyers. CNN first reports on the discovery of material at Penn Biden Center. Hur is appointed as special counsel. He\u2019ll spend the next year conducting his investigation, which includes interviews with 147 witnesses, including Biden. How was the material first discovered? Biden\u2019s personal lawyers found it. As part of an effort to move material out of the Penn Biden Center, one of his personal attorneys looked through boxes of documents found in a closet. One box included an envelope that read \u201cEyes Only\u201d for the vice president. The word \u201cIran\u201d was written on the front. Biden\u2019s lawyers called the White House counsel\u2019s office, which called the National Archives. Within a week, the FBI had opened an investigation. What kind of classified material did Biden have? Most of what Hur describes has to do with US policy toward Afghanistan. Biden, as vice president, was opposed to a surge of US troops into Afghanistan in 2009. Former President Barack Obama decided to go forward with the surge anyway. Biden wrote a memo to Obama in 2009 arguing against the surge, and both the memo and material with classified markings related to the surge were found by the FBI in an unsecured box in Biden\u2019s Delaware garage and in his home office. Separately, investigators found notebooks with classified material in Biden\u2019s handwriting in his Delaware home office and den. Is that all the classified material? No. Additional classified material was found in November 2022 in Biden\u2019s office near the Capitol building at the Penn Biden Center. It was actually the discovery of this material that initially set off a search for classified documents in Biden\u2019s home. There is not as much detail in Hur\u2019s report on these documents, which total 44 pages sprinkled in boxes with nonclassified documents on everything from a 2011 ski trip to the Biden family genealogy. Some documents are concerned with the Obama-era agreement to limit Iran\u2019s pursuit of nuclear weapons. Others had to do with a phone call between Biden and Ukraine\u2019s prime minister at the time, as well as US policy in Iraq. Did Biden know that he had classified material? That\u2019s a key question since it is the \u201cwillful\u201d mishandling of classified material as a former vice president for which Biden could have been prosecuted. Much of the classified material is in the form of handwritten notecards and notebooks, although Hur cites the actions of previous presidents, including Ronald Reagan, to say that Biden could \u201cargue plausibly\u201d he thought he had the ability to keep such things in his home. While Hur documents one instance in which Biden refers to finding classified material during a conversation with the ghostwriter of one of his memoirs, other times the president skips over reading aloud things he thinks might be classified. But, according to Hur, there are moments when Biden does read nearly verbatim classified material to his ghostwriter, Mark Zwonitzer. How do we know what exactly Biden told his ghostwriter? Zwonitzer recorded and transcribed their conversations. In fact, after he learned of the appointment of Hur as special counsel, Zwonitzer deleted the recordings, although he kept the transcripts and gave them to the FBI. The FBI was ultimately able to retrieve the deleted recordings. Hur considered prosecuting Zwonitzer with obstruction for deleting the recordings but ultimately decided there would not be enough evidence to obtain a conviction. Why did Hur decide not to prosecute Biden? Hur concludes that Biden \u201cwillfully\u201d retained classified material, but also that there is not enough evidence to establish Biden\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. There are a variety of reasons for this conclusion. For starters, Hur notes that by quickly notifying the government after the documents were discovered, some jurors would be convinced the president made an innocent mistake. Plus, there are the aforementioned problems with Biden\u2019s memory, both when he was interviewed by the special counsel and during his interactions with Zwonitzer. Hur concludes that even if Department of Justice policies allowed for the prosecution of a sitting president, he would recommend against prosecuting Biden. Why is Trump being prosecuted for mishandling classified data while Biden is not? Hur explains this in his report, arguing there are important distinctions between the two cases and \u201caggravating facts\u201d in the case of Trump. From Hur\u2019s report: Most notably, after being given multiple chances to return classified documents and avoid prosecution, Mr. Trump allegedly did the opposite. According to the indictment, he not only refused to return the documents for many months, but he also obstructed justice by enlisting others to destroy evidence and then to lie about it. In contrast, Mr. Biden turned in classified documents to the National Archives and the Department of Justice, consented to the search of multiple locations including his homes, sat for a voluntary interview. and in other ways cooperated with the investigation. Will that kind of explanation from a special counsel satisfy Republicans who routinely allege a double standard at the Department of Justice? It will not.

{"id": "2024_05_15_politics_trump-presidency-memories-biden-analysis", "text": "During Donald Trump\u2019s four years in the White House, he was famously the only president whose job approval rating never reached 50% in Gallup Organization polls since the firm began systematically tracking that measure in the 1940s. But now more positive retrospective assessments of Trump\u2019s record in office are setting off warning flares for Democrats \u2014 especially as President Joe Biden\u2019s own approval ratings remain stuck at historically low levels. In a CNN poll from April, 55% of Americans said they considered Trump\u2019s presidency a success \u2014 a big jump from the 41% who viewed his presidency so positively when he left office in January 2021, according to a CNN survey from the time. If Biden is to win a second term, \u201cthe fact that Trump is getting this level of credit cannot stand,\u201d said Democratic pollster Jay Campbell, who conducts surveys on the economy with a Republican partner for CNBC. It\u2019s not unusual for approval ratings of presidents to rise out of office. The difference is that none of Trump\u2019s defeated predecessors sought to return to the White House four years later. The public\u2019s shifting ratings of those former presidents was of interest mostly to historians; this year, these reassessments will help decide control of the White House. Generally, Biden\u2019s campaign has spent less time challenging Trump\u2019s record in his first term than highlighting what he might do in a second one. But that balance appears to be shifting. Biden\u2019s campaign has invested heavily in emotional swing-state television advertisements that tie Trump to the 2022 Supreme Court decision overturning the constitutional right to abortion with the stark concluding tagline: \u201cDonald Trump did this.\u201d Now, Biden\u2019s team is escalating its efforts to contrast his record against some of Trump\u2019s other controversial initiatives. An ad aimed at Black voters that the campaign released Tuesday, for instance, juxtaposes Trump\u2019s attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act with Biden policies that have expanded coverage, lowered premiums under the law and capped the price of insulin at $35 per month. \u201cTrump was a failure on health care,\u201d a narrator declares, before a Black woman in the ad says: \u201cWe cannot go back.\u201d Michael Tyler, the Biden campaign\u2019s communications director, said more of those messages are coming. \u201cThis is exactly why you run a campaign,\u201d Tyler said. \u201cAs we move forward here, reminding people of the damage he caused, the damage he will cause and how he made you feel every single day is imperative.\u201d Almost every president sees their retrospective approval ratings improve after they leave office; when Gallup last measured views of former presidents in 2023, each one it included except for Bill Clinton received a higher approval rating than when they left the White House. Even Jimmy Carter and George H.W. Bush, the previous two one-term presidents before Trump, were each much more popular in the poll than when they lost their reelection bids. Trump\u2019s recovery since leaving office is \u201cnot a completely new phenomenon,\u201d said Emory University political scientist Alan Abramowitz, who specializes in studying presidential approval. In Gallup\u2019s poll last year, Trump\u2019s retrospective approval rating stood at 46%. That was up 12 percentage points from his final approval rating in office of 34%. Trump\u2019s improvement in the Gallup poll since leaving office was about the same experienced by both Carter and George W. Bush in their first Gallup post-presidential assessments. Other surveys suggest the backward-looking judgments on Trump have further improved since then. In an April national New York Times/Siena College survey, for instance, slightly more registered voters (48%) now say Trump left the country better off than worse off (46%) after his presidency. Nearly two-thirds of voters in the April New York Times/Siena survey said they approved of how Trump handled the economy and about half said they approved of his handling of both immigration and crime. The April national CNN survey conducted by SRSS reported some of the most dramatic change in attitudes. From the 2021 CNN survey until last month\u2019s poll, the share of people who termed Trump\u2019s presidency a success increased more for women than for men; more for people of color than for White voters; more among working-age adults than seniors; and more among Democratic voters than Republican. The 55% in the recent CNN poll who termed Trump\u2019s presidency a success far exceeded the 39% who gave the same positive verdict to Biden\u2019s time. Abramowitz, the political scientist, said that in today\u2019s highly polarized political atmosphere, it\u2019s not surprising that discontent with Biden is boosting Trump, almost in hydraulic fashion. \u201cThere\u2019s always going to be an inverse relationship to some extent in how people assess the current president of one party versus the previous president of the opposite party, but given that partisan loyalties are stronger today, that is probably a stronger tendency now,\u201d Abramowitz said. \u201cIf you are unhappy with how things are going now, that may influence your assessment of the previous presidency.\u201d Republican strategist Brad Todd likewise said that Trump, in effect, looks bigger to many voters because Biden looks smaller. \u201cWe judge presidential approval by strength and success more than anything,\u201d Todd said. \u201cPeople think the economy was better when Trump was president, whether they liked him or not, and they think Trump projected strength rather than weakness, and plenty of voters find aspects of Biden\u2019s presidency weak.\u201d The Biden comparison also could be benefiting Trump in a more specific way: by encouraging voters to shift the issues around which they are judging Trump\u2019s tenure. Because inflation, as well as immigration and crime, are much more relevant to voters today, in their retrospective judgments about Trump\u2019s record they may be focusing more on those issues and less on other elements of his presidency that disturbed them at the time, such as his open use of racist language or the general atmosphere of chaos that surrounded his presidency, strategists in both parties said. Jim McLaughlin, a pollster for Trump, pointed mostly to shifting public concerns and the contrast with Biden to explain these post-presidential gains for the former president. When the exit polls conducted by Edison Research for a consortium of media organizations including CNN asked voters what issue was most important to their decision in 2020, McLaughlin noted, the survey didn\u2019t include either the cost of living or immigration as a specific choice. That omission, he said, measured how little concern there was in the country at the time about each problem. Now, both of those issues routinely poll near the top of voters\u2019 worries in 2024, with Biden receiving some of his weakest marks on each. To many voters, said McLaughlin, Trump \u201clooks better and better on these issues compared to Joe Biden\u2019s failures.\u201d Many Democratic pollsters say that shift in emphasis about Trump is particularly evident among Black and Hispanic voters, especially younger to middle-aged men. \u201cParticularly among working-class Latinos. \u2026 They will tell us\u00a0that they think he\u2019s racist, xenophobic, anti-immigrant, anti-Latino,\u201d said Ben Tulchin, who served as the principal pollster for Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 two Democratic presidential campaigns.\u00a0\u201cBut then they say, \u2018Comma but,\u2019 and the \u2018but\u2019 is they view his economic record more favorably than Biden\u2019s. Maybe through rose-colored glasses, but that is a challenge the Biden campaign has.\u201d In that New York Times/Siena survey last month, for example, 70% of Hispanic voters said they disapproved of how Biden is handling the economy, while 74% approved of how Trump did. Democrats acknowledge that while it is important for Biden to improve views about his own economic record, it may be difficult for him to tarnish the positive impressions most voters hold about the economy under Trump \u2014 at least before the Covid-19 pandemic struck in 2020. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s possible to impeach the state of the economy under Trump,\u201d said Campbell. It will not be easy, he added, to say to voters, \u201c\u2018Well, your memory is wrong, things were not that great in the economy under the previous guy.\u2019 I just don\u2019t think that will get them very far.\u201d Rather than trying to erase positive views on Trump\u2019s economic performance, Campbell and other Democrats think Biden could have more success reminding voters about everything else they didn\u2019t like about his time in office. \u201cEconomy aside, you can\u2019t let people think the rest of life was hunky-dory under Donald Trump, because it wasn\u2019t,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cHis approval never got above 50% for a reason. There is plenty to dislike there and plenty that people did dislike.\u201d In fact, while Trump was president, polls underscored the dynamic Campbell describes. In that final CNN/SRSS poll in 2021 before Trump left office, a majority of Americans said they approved of his handling of the economy, but even so, 55% described his presidency as a failure, and just 26% said he had changed the country for the better. The challenge for Democrats, Tulchin said, is that while current conditions are constantly reminding voters that staples like gas, groceries and rent cost less under Trump, the controversies he ignites tend to burn out faster. \u201cWhat we have seen with eight or nine years of life with Trump as a presidential candidate is\u00a0unless the glaring awful things he does are right in people\u2019s faces \u2014 January 6, \u2018good people on both sides\u2019 post-Charlottesville, kids in cages \u2014 then two weeks later, it fades away,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to force people to watch the horrific person that Trump is. They can\u2019t look fondly back on\u00a0five years ago by overlooking his character flaws, because they are major.\u201d The new Biden ad aimed at Black voters released Tuesday may encapsulate the campaign\u2019s emerging approach to talking about Trump\u2019s record. The ad takes one of the most controversial episodes of Trump\u2019s presidency \u2014 his attempt to repeal the ACA \u2014 and uses it to create a point of comparison with Biden\u2019s policy initiatives to expand access to health care and to lower medical costs. The same approach is evident in a new Biden ad aimed at Latino voters that contrasts the former president\u2019s policy of separating migrant children from their parents at the border with Biden\u2019s efforts to reunite the families. Another example of that strategy was evident when Biden last week visited Racine, Wisconsin, where Trump had gone as president to trumpet a $10 billion investment from the Taiwanese electronics manufacturer Foxconn, which never materialized. Biden was there to tout a $3.3 billion Microsoft investment in an artificial intelligence center on the site, which he offered as evidence for the success of his broader agenda to promote private-sector investment in advanced industries such as clean energy and semiconductors. \u201cFolks, during the previous administration, my predecessor made promises which he broke more than kept and left a lot of people behind in communities like Racine,\u201d Biden declared. \u201cOn my watch, we make promises and we keep promises. And we leave no one behind.\u201d Biden\u2019s campaign expresses optimism that by reminding Americans about Trump\u2019s record on these fronts it can move voters \u2014 particularly in core constituencies that have drifted toward Trump such as younger Black and Hispanic men. Trump\u2019s standing with some of these groups may wilt, these Democrats think, simply as he spends more time back in the spotlight. But Todd, like many Republicans, believes Democrats are wrong to assume that more exposure inevitably means less support for Trump. \u201cDemocratic strategists \u2026 have been saying that for a year now,\u201d Todd said. \u201cI think it\u2019s time to reevaluate that geometry.\u201d Refreshing voters about Trump\u2019s prior record could add weight to all of Biden\u2019s warnings about his future plans. Reminding college-educated voters about Trump\u2019s record on abortion and January 6, for instance, could heighten their concern about how basic rights and democracy itself would fare in a second Trump term. Likewise, recalling for Latinos Trump\u2019s family separation policy may add credibility to Democratic warnings about his plans to undertake a mass deportation program of undocumented immigrants, complete with internment camps. If Trump is convicted in his New York hush money trial, in which he\u2019s pleaded not guilty, it will remind voters not only about his willingness to push the boundaries of law and morality, but also the volatility that perpetually envelops him. What\u2019s less clear is whether enough voters will make their decisions in November based on those concerns as opposed to the issues where polls show they now express more faith in Trump than Biden, such as inflation, the border and crime. In the end, what voters remember about Trump\u2019s presidency may be less important than what they prioritize. The real risk for Democrats is that Biden\u2019s present may have irrevocably changed what swing voters care most about in Trump\u2019s past.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/politics/trump-presidency-memories-biden-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/20/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_15_politics_michael-cohen-donald-trump-analysis", "text": "It would be no surprise if the jury in Donald Trump\u2019s first criminal trial now sees his former fixer, Michael Cohen, as a profane social media troll and vengeful liar who dreams of seeing the boss he once worshipped behind bars. But jurors don\u2019t have to like Cohen. They just have to believe him. Trump\u2019s self-described former \u201cthug\u201d came under a sustained attack from defense attorney Todd Blanche Tuesday in a cross-examination meant to shatter his credibility as the star witness to the ex-president\u2019s allegedly criminal behavior. But critically, he didn\u2019t lose his composure on the stand. So far, he\u2019s avoided traps that would fatally undermine the case. Cohen will get time to take stock on Wednesday, on the trial\u2019s regular day off, which will also give Trump\u2019s team a chance to sharpen its approach. The presumptive GOP nominee, meanwhile, is due to take the opportunity to launch a fundraising swing through Ohio and Kentucky before court resumes Thursday. Cohen has already directly implicated Trump in making payments to adult film star Stormy Daniels to cover-up their alleged affair and apparently corroborated prosecution evidence that the scheme was meant to influence the 2016 election. (Trump has denied an affair and pleaded not guilty). The task of the defense in cross-examination was, therefore, to so undermine Cohen\u2019s credibility that they sowed reasonable doubt in the minds of at least one juror about the wider case. Blanche took Cohen through a long list of the insults he\u2019s unleashed at Trump since becoming estranged from his former mentor, highlighting his penchant for serial lying. He drew jurors\u2019 attention to a social media post in which Cohen wore a T-shirt that depicted Trump in jail, as he spun a narrative of bias and obsession. Blanche also got the witness to say that he\u2019d built up a lucrative business, especially in books focused on his criticism of the former president. He asked if Cohen had called Trump a \u201cboorish cartoon misogynist.\u201d Cohen replied, \u201cSounds like something I would say.\u201d Then Trump\u2019s attorney inquired if he\u2019d mocked the ex-president as a \u201cCheeto-dusted cartoon villain.\u201d Blanche also sought to draw out Cohen\u2019s grudge against Trump, which he can later highlight to the jury in closing arguments, by asking him about a TikTok post in April in which he said Trump belonged in a \u201cf**king cage like an animal\u201d and asked him to confirm that he\u2019d also called the presumptive GOP nominee a \u201cdictator douchebag.\u201d Michael Moore, a former US attorney for the Middle District of Georgia, said that the defense had made some progress in impeaching Cohen\u2019s credibility. \u201cI really took away that the jury is probably seeing and thinking right now that Cohen is a grifter and a waffler,\u201d said Moore, a CNN legal analyst. \u201cHe clearly is making money off this, he clearly is somebody who has got his hand in the till to sell his books.\u201d Big questions in the trial coming into focus But notably, Blanche mostly concentrated on his effort to tarnish Cohen\u2019s character, motives and credibility rather than the core question of the case \u2014 whether Trump falsified the business records as part of a cover up expressly designed to mislead voters in 2016 in an early instance of election interference. As always, when a Trump subordinate performs in front of the boss, there was a sense Blanche\u2019s histrionics were as much for the benefit of his client as the case. And in a curious debut of the cross-examination, Blanche earned an admonition from Judge Juan Merchan for making it all about him, when he noted Cohen had called him a \u201ccrying little sh*t\u201d on TikTok. Questions hanging over the case with the court dark on Wednesday start with how badly Blanche managed to damage Cohen\u2019s testimony and the prosecution case with his full-frontal assault. Given that the prosecution has already signaled it plans no further witnesses after Cohen\u2019s testimony, attention is turning to the approach the defense will take. Will Trump\u2019s lawyers bring in a number of witnesses? Or could they adopt a bold gambit by simply arguing that the prosecution has fallen woefully short of proving their case beyond a reasonable doubt and dramatically rest? Then there is Trump\u2019s initial indication that he\u2019d like to testify in his own defense. The former president loves a stage and considers himself his best advocate \u2014 even if history often suggests the opposite. But many lawyers believe that given his volatile temperament and trouble telling the truth, putting him on the stand would represent a potential disaster for the defense. A key legal conundrum is whether prosecutors have so far succeeded in validating the legal theory behind the case. \u201cI think the misdemeanor of falsification of business records has been proven beyond any reasonable doubt,\u201d Shira Scheindlin, a retired US district court judge, told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper on Tuesday. \u201cThe felony is a little tougher because you have to say that Trump knowingly and willfully intended to violate the election law in the state of New York by unlawful means and the unlawful means is to violate the federal campaign finance law.\u201d Scheindlin added: \u201cCohen went a long way toward making that case.\u201d As the prosecution case nears its end, there is also a growing sense that the fateful moment when Trump must wait for a jury to decide whether he will become the first president convicted of a crime is approaching. That foreboding realization was exacerbated by a new posse of Trump supporters at the courthouse on Tuesday, including House Speaker Mike Johnson. The Louisiana Republican brought the full symbolic heft of his office to bear in an apparent attempt to delegitimize the trial, to bolster Trump\u2019s claim that he\u2019s a victim of weaponized justice and to potentially hedge against a potential conviction with an early round of political spin. \u201cThese are politically motivated trials, and they are a disgrace,\u201d Johnson said Tuesday outside the courthouse. \u201cIt is election interference,\u201d he said. Defense tactics raise eyebrows It\u2019s impossible to know how a jury interprets testimony until a verdict is delivered \u2014 and even then, jurors often opt not to explain their verdicts in detail in media interviews in high-profile cases like this one. Some legal experts on Tuesday questioned the tone and tactics adopted by Blanche in the court. While Cohen\u2019s reluctance to offer yes-and-no answers came across at times as flippant and confrontational, he did not appear to say or do anything to torpedo the prosecution case. He did not blow up at Blanche, despite the attorney\u2019s incessant goading and an attempt to put him off his game by erratically jumping from topic to topic. \u201cNo massive disasters yet,\u201d former FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe told CNN. But Moore, the CNN legal analyst, defended Blanche\u2019s approach of mixing up the evidential timeline to try to shake Cohen\u2019s pre-trial prep. \u201cYou want to make them tell the story on your terms and not to follow the script,\u201d Moore said. The prosecution knew that Blanche\u2019s attack was coming and worked all morning on Tuesday to nail down a narrative about the payment to Daniels and its purpose. Manhattan prosecutor Susan Hoffinger tried to undermine a defense claim that Trump\u2019s reimbursements to Cohen were part of a retainer for legal services and not to pay him back for the Daniels hush money payment. In a key moment in the trial, which resonated outside the courtroom given the obligations that Trump places on many of his aides and subordinates, Cohen described the moment when he broke from his former boss. \u201cMy family, my wife, my daughter, my son all said to me, \u2018Why are you holding onto this loyalty, what are you doing?\u2019\u201d Cohen said, adding that he came to a point when it was time to listen. \u201cI would not lie for President Trump any longer.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/politics/michael-cohen-donald-trump-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/20/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_17_politics_same-sex-marriage-what-matters", "text": "It\u2019s hard to believe today, when the vast majority of Americans support it, but just 20 years ago the issue of same-sex marriage divided the country and drove voter turnout. The vast majority of Americans opposed same-sex marriage on May 17, 2004, when the first same-sex couples took their vows after a court decision in Massachusetts. The state\u2019s Republican governor at the time, Mitt Romney, planned to invoke an archaic 1913 law in an attempt to bar same-sex couples from traveling from other states to obtain marriages in Massachusetts. Then-President George W. Bush, a Republican running for reelection, gave an address from the White House that year actively pushing to amend the US Constitution to \u201cprotect\u201d marriage, which he described as \u201cthe most fundamental institution of civilization.\u201d There was verifiable backlash to marriage equality in November 2004, when voters in 11 states \u2013 ranging from reliably red Utah to reliably blue Oregon \u2013 codified in their constitutions that marriage should be between a man and a woman. The marriage amendment approved in Ohio by an overwhelming majority may have helped sway that pivotal state into Bush\u2019s column as he retained the White House. The effort to oppose same-sex marriage certainly didn\u2019t hurt him in the state. Without Ohio, Bush would have lost to then-Sen. John Kerry, the Massachusetts Democrat who opposed same-sex marriages taking place in his own state. The 2015 Supreme Court case, Obergefell v. Hodges, by which a divided 5-4 court would ultimately grant a right to same-sex marriage, sprang up as a result of this Ohio amendment. In CNN exit polls for the presidential election in 2004, just a quarter of all American voters that year said they supported marriage rights for same-sex couples. A larger proportion, 35%, supported giving same-sex couples the ability to enter into civil unions. And 37% opposed legal recognition of same-sex unions. Barack Obama notably opposed same-sex marriage when he ran for president as a Democrat in the 2008 election and, as public opinion was rapidly shifting, changed his tune in 2012 to support same-sex unions. In eight years, the US went from the winning candidate (Bush in 2004) exploiting opposition to same-sex marriage to win reelection, to the winning candidate (Obama in 2012) changing his position to support marriage equality before winning reelection. Now, it\u2019s Congress protecting same-sex marriage from the Supreme Court A decade later, in 2022, the person Obama beat in 2012, now-Sen. Romney, voted in favor of protecting same-sex unions in the event the US Supreme Court decided to strip away the national right to marry that it granted in 2015. The court today is much more conservative than it was in 2015 after two justices who supported same-sex marriage rights, Justices Anthony Kennedy and Ruth Bader Ginsburg, were replaced with Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett, respectively. Two current conservative justices, Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, still publicly grouse about the Obergefell decision, but it\u2019s not clear if an opportunity to overturn the decision will present itself or if the conservative justices who weren\u2019t on the court in 2015 would support removing the right to same-sex marriage in the same way they endorsed removing a right to abortion. Romney does not now support same-sex marriages, but he made clear when he voted to protect them from the Supreme Court that he does respect people who have entered into them: \u201cWhile I believe in traditional marriage,\u201d Romney said in a statement, \u201cObergefell is and has been the law of the land upon which LGBTQ individuals have relied. This legislation provides certainty to many\u00a0LGBTQ\u00a0Americans,\u00a0and it signals that Congress\u2014and I\u2014esteem and love all of our fellow Americans equally.\u201d The Respect for Marriage Act that Romney supported does not guarantee a national right to same-sex marriage if the Supreme Court changes course, but it does require every state to honor marriages conducted legally in other states. If the Supreme Court overturned Obergefell, most states still have laws and constitutional amendments that ban same-sex marriage, according to an analysis by Stateline. \u2018Stunning\u2019 reversal The annual American Values survey conducted by PRRI in 2023 found a strong majority of Americans \u2013 more than two-thirds \u2013 now support same-sex unions, but the support varies. In states that protect same-sex marriage regardless of Obergefell, support is over 70%. Support falls to 64% in states where same-sex marriage would end without Obergefell. I talked to Alex Lundry, a Republican pollster and longtime supporter of same-sex marriage,  about how he views this 20-year pivot in public opinion. \u201cIt\u2019s stunning in its reversal,\u201d Lundry said, adding, \u201cin my opinion, it\u2019s the most significant and substantial shift in public opinion of the modern polling era.\u201d 20% of Gen Z identifies as LGBTQ Lundry pointed to a series of data points to explain the overwhelming shift in public opinion: \u25ba First, more people identify as LGBTQ. He pointed to data from Gallup,  which saw the portion of the population who identify as LGBTQ more than double from 3.5% in 2012, when the organization first started asking people about their sexual orientation, to 7.2% 2022, the last year for which it has data. \u25ba More importantly, maybe, is that almost 20% of Gen Z Americans, those born between 1997 and 2004, identify as LGBTQ, with most of them identifying as bisexual. \u25ba As a result, more people know and care about someone who is gay. That trend was already underway back in 2004, when Bush\u2019s vice president, Dick Cheney, one of whose daughters is gay, openly disagreed with the push for an anti-same-sex marriage constitutional amendment. Today there is far more representation of gay outlooks in the media and in government, where the organization Out for America, which tracks representation, found the number of openly LGBTQ lawmakers rose from less than 500 in 2017 to nearly 1,200 in 2023. \u25ba Underlying all of that is that the number of same-sex couples has more than doubled from less than 600,000 in 2008 to more than 1.2 million in 2021, roughly 710,000 of which are married, according to Census Bureau data. Warnings were unfounded There is also evidence that warnings about same-sex marriage somehow endangering \u201ctraditional marriage\u201d simply never materialized. A new study by researchers for the RAND Corporation to assess two decades of same-sex marriage in the US argues marriage rates actually increased among opposite-sex couples as same-sex couples were granted the ability to marry in certain states. Physical health also improved in those states for same-sex couples, according to the study. Another societal shift Abortion rights are another social issue politicians hope to use to move the coming election. A key difference between support for same-sex marriage and support for abortion rights, according to Lundry, is that support for abortion rights has remained positive for decades, in contrast to same-sex marriage, which saw a complete turnaround. The only other issue where he argued there has been such a pivot is on legalizing marijuana, support for which has gone from about a third in 2002 to 70% in 2023, according to Gallup. Not at all coincidentally, President Joe Biden has moved in this election year to reclassify cannabis from a Schedule I drug to a Schedule III drug, acknowledging there are legitimate uses for it and making the government view it as a substance with a lower risk for abuse. Meanwhile, the ever-evolving fight over LGBTQ rights continues. An issue driving state legislatures today is transgender rights, particularly regarding children and gender-affirming care.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/17/politics/same-sex-marriage-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/20/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_04_10_politics_lara-trump-rnc-2020-election-fraud-claims", "text": "The Republican National Committee last week sent out a scripted call to voters\u2019 phones on behalf of new co-chair Lara Trump saying Democrats committed \u201cmassive fraud\u201d in the 2020 election. It\u2019s the latest example of how the RNC under the former president\u2019s daughter-in-law is perpetuating lies about the 2020 election, even as prominent Republicans say the party needs to look forward to win in 2024. \u201cWe all know the problems. No photo IDs, unsecured ballot drop boxes, mass mailing of ballots, and voter rolls chock full of deceased people and non-citizens are just a few examples of the massive fraud that took place,\u201d the RNC call said. \u201cIf Democrats have their way, your vote could be canceled out by someone who isn\u2019t even an American citizen.\u201d The claim of \u201cmassive fraud\u201d in the 2020 election marks a significant shift in messaging for the RNC because lies about the 2020 election had not been a consistent theme in its messaging since Donald Trump left office. But the call\u2019s message is largely consistent with the views publicly espoused over the past four years by Lara Trump, who was elected as co-chair in early March as part of Donald Trump\u2019s takeover of the GOP. Lara Trump has a long history of echoing his election fraud claims, according to a CNN KFile analysis of her past statements as a commentator and surrogate for the former president. \u201cI\u2019m sure you agree with co-chair Trump that we cannot allow the chaos and questions of the 2020 election to ever happen again,\u201d said the call, which was obtained by CNN\u2019s KFile from the anti-robocall application Nomorobo, which estimated 145,000 calls were sent with the message from April 1-7. It comes amid previous CNN reporting about the RNC asking employees who are reapplying for their jobs whether they believe the 2020 election was stolen in an apparent litmus test for hiring. The RNC denied any such litmus test existed.\u00a0Lara Trump and new chair Michael Whatley succeeded Drew McKissick and Ronna McDaniel, who had earned the ire of the former president because of his dissatisfaction with how the RNC handled claims of fraud around the 2020 election, CNN previously reported. There is no evidence of widespread fraud in the 2020 election, as even some state GOP election officials and former Trump Attorney General William Barr have acknowledged. The former president and his supporters filed more than 60 court cases in six key battleground states following the election and lost every one of them. And, they have still not brought forth any evidence of the rampant cheating they continue to talk about on the campaign trail. But in the years since the 2020 election, Lara Trump has continued to push claims of fraud. Her comments have been in line with those of her father-in-law, who\u2019s successfully reshaped the GOP in his image and easily secured his third-straight GOP nomination this year. Polling, for example, shows that a majority of GOP voters think the 2020 election result was illegitimate. A CNN poll released last September found that 71% of Republicans said President Joe Biden\u2019s \u201cdid not legitimately win enough votes to win the presidency.\u201d From November 2020 to February 2024, Lara Trump propagated the narrative of Democratic cheating in the 2020 presidential election. And even after she was elected co-chair and said claims of a stolen election are \u201cin the past,\u201d she didn\u2019t repudiate those baseless accusations. \u201cWell, I think we\u2019re past that. I think that\u2019s in the past. We learned a lot. Certainly, we took a lot of notes,\u201d Trump said in an NBC interview when asked whether claims of a stolen 2020 election would be the official position of the RNC in 2024. She went on to tout lawsuits across 23 states \u201cto ensure that it is harder to cheat and easier to vote,\u201d while raising questions about pandemic-era voting procedures during the 2020 election. In the same interview, Trump also added the GOP needed to \u201ctrust mail-in voting.\u201d Neither the RNC nor Lara Trump responded to multiple requests for comment. A long history of spreading election lies As recently as February 2024, Lara Trump said she did not believe Biden received 81 million votes in the 2020 election. \u201cDoes anyone actually believe that in 2020, 81 million people were so inspired by a guy who could only get 10 people (to attended events) \u2026that he had the most massive turnout in the history of elections?\u201d she said at a Trump event in South Carolina just days before she announced her campaign for RNC co-chair. \u201cNo, we don\u2019t believe that.\u201d On her internet show and podcast, and in public events, she often spread outlandish and nonsensical claims about the 2020 election. On an episode of her show that aired on December 30, 2020, Trump agreed with her co-hosts that the election did not pass the \u201csmell test\u201d and falsely suggested that dead voters helped Biden win. \u201cNow, I don\u2019t know if this is true, but somebody sent me this. Donald Trump got 74 million votes. There are 133 million registered voters in the United States. If every single registered voter went out and voted, which we know is basically impossible, doesn\u2019t happen, there would only be 59 million votes left for Joe Biden. So how the heck did he get 81 million votes?\u201d she said. The comments cite a widely debunked analysis that misrepresents the number of people eligible to vote. \u201cYou\u2019re discriminating against all the dead people, Lara. How dare you!\u201d said one co-host. \u201cOh yeah, that\u2019s right. That\u2019s true,\u201d she responded. A CNN analysis previously found no evidence to support this claim, debunking the misinformation spread by Trump supporters online in the aftermath of the 2020 results. The 2020 election saw a record-breaking turnout, with 155 million people casting their votes, as reported by the US Census Bureau. This marked the highest voter participation of the 21st century, with 66.8% of eligible citizens aged 18 and older voting. Later in the episode, Trump said, \u201cI think that [Democrats] know that the Republicans are not gonna let it stand. They\u2019re not gonna certify votes for Joe Biden. And it is likely that they will be voting for Donald Trump for a second term.\u201d In an episode of her podcast weeks earlier, she claimed the odds of Biden winning in swing states were \u201cone in one quadrillion to the fourth power,\u201d as mail-in ballots were counted, failing to cite a statistical analysis. Though Biden narrowly lost with in-person voters, 46% of voters voted by mail in 2020. As votes were counted, Biden pulled ahead, according to an analysis from Pew Research. Though nothing was abnormal or illegal about the process, Lara Trump has also referred to the counting of votes nefariously. \u201cWe gotta make up so much for all the cheating,\u201d Trump said on her podcast in September 2023. \u201cWe know the Democrats love to do that. We need to go into this thing with such a big lead that they\u2019re like, \u2018oh my God, we can\u2019t do a 3:00 a.m. spike with this. We\u2019re never gonna make it.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/10/politics/lara-trump-rnc-2020-election-fraud-claims/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/20/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_19_politics_stefanik-israel-speech-biden-trump", "text": "House GOP Conference Chair Elise Stefanik delivered remarks at the Israeli Knesset Sunday, saying victory for Israel in the war against Hamas starts with \u201cwiping\u201d those responsible for the October 7 terrorist attacks \u201coff the face of the Earth\u201d and calling for a return to former President Donald Trump\u2019s policies. \u201cTotal victory starts, but only starts, with wiping those responsible for October 7 off the face of the Earth. There can be no retrievable dignity for Hamas and its backers,\u201d she said in her speech in which she called herself a \u201cleading proponent and partner\u201d to Trump and sharply criticized the Biden administration. The New York Republican, who is considered a potential vice-presidential pick for the presumptive GOP nominee, has been outspoken in the House over reports of antisemitism on college campuses, earning attention for her grilling of university presidents. Her speech makes her the highest-ranking House Republican to address the Israeli governing body since the October 7 attacks, according to the GOP conference. \u201cWhen the enemy is inside the gates of the United Nations, America must be the one to call it by its name and destroy it. President Trump understood that,\u201d Stefanik said. \u201cBut you know as well as I that the enemy is inside more than just the gates of the United Nations. It is also in powerful Western institutions in my country and beyond, where the virus, the vile virus of antisemitism is spreading. This is why total victory means not just physical self-defense but ideological self-defense,\u201d added Stefanik, who claimed that pro-Palestinian protesters on college campuses who are calling for a ceasefire in the conflict are \u201ccosplaying Hamas.\u201d In a rare instance of a member of Congress publicly criticizing the American president to a foreign government, Stefanik went after Biden, saying there is \u201cno excuse\u201d for his administration blocking military aid to Israel. \u201cI have been clear at home and I will be clear here: There is no excuse for an American president to block aid to Israel \u2014 aid that was duly passed by the Congress,\u201d Stefanik said. The Biden administration has paused the shipment\u00a0of some bombs to Israel, citing opposition to the weapons being used in the densely populated areas of Rafah. But it has also\u00a0begun the early stages\u00a0of a process to move ahead with a new $1 billion arms deal for Israel. White House spokesperson Andrew Bates said in a statement Sunday, \u201cThere has been no better friend to Israel than President Biden.\u201d \u201cHe was the first American president to visit Israel during war time \u2013 in the aftermath of the horrific October 7 terrorist attacks \u2013 and the first president to order the US military to defend Israel from a foreign nation\u2019s attack. As he has demonstrated, President Biden\u2019s support for Israel\u2019s security is \u2018ironclad,\u2019\u201d Bates said. \u201cUnlike some figures on the right, President Biden did not rail against the Israeli government in the days after October 7, nor has he ever praised terrorist organizations like Hezbollah \u2013 and he will not be lectured by any person who was silent in the face of those offensive statements,\u201d Bates said in reference to statements from Trump, who called the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah \u201cvery smart\u201d and said that Israel \u201cwas not prepared\u201d for October 7 in an interview\u00a0with Fox News days after the attack. Biden said for the first time publicly earlier this month that he would\u00a0halt some shipments of American weapons to Israel\u00a0\u2014 which he acknowledged have been used to kill civilians in Gaza \u2014 if Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered a major invasion of Rafah. \u201cWe\u2019re not walking away from Israel\u2019s security. We\u2019re walking away from Israel\u2019s ability to wage war in those areas,\u201d Biden said in an interview with CNN at the time. Stefanik attempted to paint a contrast between the White House and the House GOP, telling Fox\u2019s Shannon Bream after her speech, \u201cThe world is looking for moral leadership \u2026 and it\u2019s important that House Republicans step up to fill that void.\u201d \u201cOne of the main focuses of my speech was that the American people stand strongly with Israel, as do House Republicans,\u201d she told Fox, applauding the\u00a0House-passed, GOP-led bill that would prevent Biden from withholding, halting, reversing or canceling weapons transfers from the US to Israel already approved by Congress. Asked about civilian deaths in Gaza \u2014 where more than 35,000 people have been killed, according to the enclave\u2019s health ministry \u2014\u00a0Stefanik\u00a0pointed to Hamas\u2019 use of \u201ccivilian shields.\u201d \u201cIsrael has great respect when it comes to human rights,\u201d she said, \u201cand that\u2019s how they have conducted all of their operations, that\u2019s why the United States stands strongly with Israel.\u201d Human rights groups have\u00a0accused Israel of committing war crimes\u00a0and abuses during the war in Gaza. The\u00a0Biden administration said in a State Department report to Congress earlier this month\u00a0that\u00a0it is \u201creasonable to assess\u201d that US weapons have been used by Israeli forces in\u00a0Gaza\u00a0in ways that are \u201cinconsistent\u201d with international humanitarian law, but\u00a0it stopped short of officially saying Israel violated the law.

{"id": "2024_05_19_politics_donald-trump-immigration-agenda", "text": "It took Donald Trump one week in the Oval Office to set off an immigration firestorm with the stroke of a pen. The executive order Trump signed in January 2017 was intended to immediately deliver on a campaign pledge to ban entry into the US from certain Muslim-majority nations. Instead, it sparked protests, a series of successful legal challenges, and recriminations from Republican lawmakers and officials alike, who viewed the effort as a half-baked, self-inflicted wound by a new administration quickly being defined by chaos. The backlash and disarray came to define the early months of an administration that lacked the preparation, personnel and legal underpinning to impose swift and severe changes on a complex and bureaucratic immigration system. But in the years since, that initial failure has served to obscure the eventual outcome of a policy that originated as a 2015 campaign press release calling for a \u201ctotal and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.\u201d A revised version of the proposal was later implemented, upheld by the Supreme Court and expanded. The policy dramatically slashed entries into the US and helped reshape how front-line US officials would apply immigration law around the world. As Trump and his advisers map out a potential second-term agenda, the pathway to the implementation and application of the travel ban is a critical window into understanding their ambitions for immigration policy. The anti-immigrant rhetoric that defined Trump\u2019s successful 2016 campaign has darkened and grown even more inflammatory as he seeks a return to the White House. He has framed the current migrant crisis as an \u201cinvasion\u201d by dangerous criminals, who in some cases \u201care not people.\u201d But the focus on Trump\u2019s incendiary language can obscure an expansive and largely unprecedented swath of immigration policy proposals. They include mass arrests, detention and deportation. Federal law enforcement would be restructured to direct \u201cmassive portions\u201d of agency personnel toward immigration enforcement. The National Guard would be deployed and, if necessary, US troops as well. Trump\u2019s advisers don\u2019t see their agenda as aspirational political messaging. \u201cThink about the first term, but on steroids,\u201d a former senior Trump administration official who is working outside the campaign to draft immigration policy options for a second term. In interviews with more than a dozen Trump allies, lawmakers and advocates opposed to his immigration positions, there\u2019s consistent agreement on one thing: Trump has every intention of making good on what he\u2019s pledging at campaign rallies. \u201cIt\u2019s important to kind of take him at his word of what he\u2019s promising,\u201d said Todd Schulte, the president of the immigration and criminal justice advocacy group FWD.us, which battled with Trump during his first term. \u201cWhat I do know is that his tools to try and do it will have radically expanded from last time.\u201d Should Trump defeat President Joe Biden in November, advisers and outside allies say they have mapped out a concrete pathway to rapid implementation of that agenda, bolstered by the lessons learned from Trump\u2019s previous stint in office and the steady and systematic weakening of the key forces that hampered those earlier efforts: public opinion, Congress and the courts. Plans and personnel Stephen Miller, one of Trump\u2019s closest advisers who is expected to run point on immigration in a potential second term, said on a January podcast that their plans would call for \u201can all-of-nation, all-of-government, state, local and federal effort.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a feat similar in size and scale to the other Great American projects that have been undertaken, for example, the transcontinental railroad or digging the Panama Canal,\u201d Miller told podcast host Sebastian Gorka, another onetime Trump adviser who remains close to the former president. The rapid implementation of those proposals would be driven by veterans of Trump\u2019s first term, who would once again be tapped to lead the effort. One Democratic lawmaker who works on immigration issues told CNN that Miller was \u201cthe most dangerous person in Trump\u2019s inner circle.\u201d Asked why, the lawmaker replied: \u201cBecause he has an encyclopedic knowledge of how things actually work.\u201d The plans are neither secret, nor subtle. Instead, they are being shaped by close allies and Trump administration veterans. \u201cOn Day One, we will begin the largest domestic deportation operation in American history,\u201d Trump says at every campaign rally. He even cites the precedent his team plans to utilize for the effort \u2013 the deportation initiative undertaken by the Eisenhower administration in 1954. Behind the scenes, advisers are eyeing statutes ranging from the 18th century to the Clinton era to provide the necessary legal underpinning. Draft executive orders have been formulated and would be ready to be revised and deployed at Trump\u2019s request. Key personnel priorities \u2013 particularly for political appointees who wouldn\u2019t need to go through a Senate confirmation process \u2013 have been mapped out to ensure Trump\u2019s plans would be put into motion immediately. Trump White House veterans are keenly aware of career government officials on the front lines who were aligned with and willing to embrace and implement Trump\u2019s hard-line policies. In his campaign speeches, the former president has pledged to dramatically expand ideological screening, use federal law to \u201cdeny entry to all communists and Marxists,\u201d and to revoke the visas of \u201cradical anti-American and antisemitic foreigners\u201d enrolled at US colleges and universities. Refugee and asylum claims, both key targets during Trump\u2019s first term, would once again be sharply curtailed. Temporary work permits would be terminated and Trump has pledged to halt the use of parole authority. The pandemic-era authority known as Title 42, which the Trump administration utilized to implement a de facto shutdown of the southern border, would be reimplemented. Trump, who while in office privately raised the idea of shooting missiles into Mexico to take out \u201cdrug labs,\u201d has campaigned on an explicit war against cartels. The US Navy would be deployed to impose a \u201cfull naval embargo on the cartels,\u201d according to the policy laid out on Trump\u2019s campaign website. The Pentagon would be directed to deploy special forces, cyber warfare \u201cand other covert and overt actions to inflict maximum damage on cartel leadership, infrastructure, and operations.\u201d The plans would, in many ways, build off the more than 1,000 policy actions taken during Trump\u2019s first term \u2013 all of which the former president and his advisers plan to reenforce. It\u2019s a reality that underscores the overwhelming scale of the immigration effort Trump and his advisers undertook while in office. By the time Trump left the White House, his team had reshaped not just the policy, but every level of a complex interagency process that crosses everything from Customs and Border Protection Border Patrol agents to State Department consular officers. The result was a radically altered immigration paradigm that had been in place for decades under administrations from both parties. \u201cAmericans can expect that immediately upon President Trump\u2019s return to the Oval Office, he will restore all of his prior policies, implement brand new crackdowns that will send shockwaves to all the world\u2019s criminal smugglers, and marshal every federal and state power necessary to institute the largest deportation operation in American history,\u201d Trump campaign spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said in a statement to CNN. Undocumented immigrants who crossed the border since Trump left office, Leavitt added, \u201cshould not get comfortable because very soon they will be going home.\u201d A contrast with Biden Biden entered the White House pledging to be Trump\u2019s opposite on immigration. Just hours after his inaugural address, he signed a series of executive actions from the Oval Office to swiftly undo key Trump policies in pursuit of what Biden framed as a \u201chumane immigration system that operates consistently with our nation\u2019s values.\u201d On his first day in office, Biden rescinded the former president\u2019s travel ban, along with a series of other Trump immigration policies. But officials cautioned that the process to implement further reforms would take time \u2013 and require congressional action. The lead agencies had been hollowed out in the Trump administration, with a sharp increase in departures from career officials who objected to the policies and chafed under intense White House pressure on their portfolios, multiple Biden administration officials recounted to CNN. The hundreds of executive actions the Trump administration put into place touched every corner of federal authority and were implemented in an interconnected and granular level, the officials said. Three and a half years later, congressional legislative efforts have fallen apart, with Trump playing a central role in torpedoing a bipartisan Senate border compromise in February. Biden\u2019s own executive actions ran headlong into his own thicket of political, legal and policy constraints, driven in no small part by the sheer scale of the overhaul he inherited from Trump. All the while, a series of interlocking migrant crises and cross-cutting political considerations in the wake of the pandemic have elevated immigration to a central electoral issue. The failed bipartisan Senate proposal captured a dramatic shift on immigration. The White House and Senate Democratic supporters moved firmly behind a proposal that contained no pathway to citizenship or protections for recipients of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA. Republican priorities that in past negotiations would\u2019ve been nonstarters for Democrats had become key selling points. If the long-running border crisis was the driving policy motivation, the enforcement-focused bill was at least partly also driven by new political realities. Biden\u2019s public pledge to devise and implement a \u201chumane\u201d immigration system had given way to a public promise to use emergency authority in the Senate legislation to \u201cshut down the border right now.\u201d There\u2019s also been a sharp rise in the share of Americans who call immigration the most important problem facing the country, and it has topped every other named issue for three consecutive months, Gallup polling found in April. An April CNN poll conducted by SSRS found that 76% of registered voters viewed immigration as extremely or very important to their presidential vote. Trump, in poll after head-to-head poll, holds a significant edge over Biden on the issue. Biden and his allies have pushed to highlight Trump\u2019s role in killing the bipartisan Senate proposal to address the border crisis. In closed-door fundraisers, Biden has also called attention to the radical nature of Trump\u2019s immigration proposals \u2013 something his 2020 campaign used to its advantage. \u201cWe have to be able to control our border, any country does,\u201d Biden said at a May 10 fundraiser in California. \u201cBut the way he talks about it and what he wants to do is criminal. Folks, that\u2019s not who we are. That\u2019s not America.\u201d Looking beyond the rhetoric Still, Trump allies view the shift in public sentiment on immigration as a key political opportunity \u2013 one the former president presses at every opportunity, with a flourish of fear-mongering, hyperbole and outright lies. \u201cThese are people coming out of jails and prisons, they\u2019re coming out of mental institutions, insane asylums,\u201d Trump said at a rally in Michigan earlier this month, repeating a line that remains as devoid of evidence now as it was when he first started using it during the Republican primary. \u201cThese are not people we want, and they\u2019re coming from all over the world.\u201d Trump and his campaign have been unapologetic about the rhetoric \u2013 and have actively looked for ways to draw attention to what they see as a critical advantage. After Trump used the term \u201cbloodbath\u201d during a campaign rally in Ohio in reference to Biden\u2019s electric vehicle policy, the campaign faced blowback over what was perceived as a reference to what would happen in the country if Trump lost the election. Within a day, the Trump campaign had moved to co-opt the term as its own \u2013 and apply it to his immigration proposals in ads and stump speeches. \u201cHe said a lot of that last time so people think he can\u2019t do it this time,\u201d Schulte, of the pro-immigration group FWD.us, said of Trump\u2019s rhetoric and campaign trail immigration promises. \u201cIt feels a bit abstract. It shouldn\u2019t.\u201d The dramatic scale of Trump\u2019s immigration agenda would have a sweeping effect across the US, Schulte said \u2013 one that shouldn\u2019t get lost in debates over his rhetoric. A mass deportation effort would be certain to sharply curtail productivity, Schulte said, given the critical role played by immigrants in the US economy. Federal spending would face a dramatic increase between the deployment of resources, personnel and incentives for state and local authorities to cooperate, he added. Mass deportations would also require the country to grapple with the reality of the US government \u201ctrying to hunt down, round up and deport millions of people here,\u201d Schulte said. \u201cWhat does it mean? What does it look like?\u201d Trump allies say the changing public attitudes on immigration have created space to enact their most aggressive \u2013 and expansive \u2013 policy ambitions at the same moment that the other central roadblocks to Trump\u2019s immigration goals have been dramatically diminished. Once viewed as radical and relegated to the fringes of the GOP, Trump\u2019s immigration agenda is now an animating force for most, if not all, Republicans on Capitol Hill. Trump would also stand to benefit in a second term from one of the cornerstone achievements of his first four years in office: a reshaped federal judiciary. More than 200 current district and appeals court judges were nominated by Trump and confirmed by a Republican-led Senate. \u201cHe\u2019s going to start with a federal bench that has a lot more judges likely to be sympathetic to his arguments,\u201d said CNN Supreme Court analyst Steve Vladeck, a University of Texas law professor. \u201cThat\u2019s going to be especially pronounced in some parts of the country, but it really is a nationwide phenomenon.\u201d Trump\u2019s revised travel ban was upheld in 2018 by the Supreme Court in a 5-4 vote that served to validate an expansive view of executive authority on immigration. But is also offered the first window into the weight carried by Trump\u2019s nominees to the nation\u2019s highest court after the confirmation of Justice Neil Gorsuch. Trump would go on to nominate two more justices \u2013 Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett \u2013 who would give conservatives a 6-3 majority, something his advisers regularly point to as they look toward potential second-term legal battles. But veterans of those battles say the strategy is much bigger than the judges themselves. Like so much of what Trump advisers are mapping out for a second term, it\u2019s driven by the lessons learned from the first, including the speed and scale with which they plan to operate. \u201cOne of the other things the Trump folks learned during the first term was that sometimes you win by just flooding the zone,\u201d Vladeck said. \u201cFlooding the zone is a big part of the agenda.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/19/politics/donald-trump-immigration-agenda/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/20/2024", "section": "politics"}}

{"id": "2024_05_16_politics_house-panels-contempt-garland-biden-audio", "text": "A pair of Republican-led House committees voted on Thursday to advance contempt proceedings against Attorney General Merrick Garland for his refusal to turn over audio recordings of President Joe Biden\u2019s interview with\u00a0special counsel Robert Hur. The move is a major escalation in a dispute over the recordings between House Republicans and the executive branch that came after Biden asserted executive privilege over the files. The House Judiciary and Oversight panels both approved a report recommending a contempt of Congress resolution against Garland\u00a0for failing to comply with a congressional subpoena, paving the way for the full House to vote on holding the attorney general in contempt, though it is not clear when that vote could take place. The vote passed along party lines in both committees. Republicans have seized on Hur\u2019s description of Biden as a \u201cwell-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory\u201d in his final report, a characterization that Biden has disputed. Republicans say that access to the tapes would provide valuable information beyond what a written transcript can provide, but the Department of Justice has raised questions over whether the House GOP is seeking the audio files solely for political purposes and maintains they have\u00a0distinct privacy concerns to protect. The special counsel report quickly became a political problem for the president, spotlighting an issue that has proven to be intractable for Biden: his age. The White House and Biden\u2019s campaign reacted furiously to Hur\u2019s characterization of the president, launching a fierce defense aimed at beating back the special counsel\u2019s allegations that Biden was forgetful \u2014 particularly on the matter of whether the president recalled the year in which his son died. Republican lawmakers had previously subpoenaed the audio recordings of Biden\u2019s interviews, along with\u00a0his ghostwriter, Mark Zwonitzer,\u00a0and\u00a0other items from Hur\u2019s investigation into Biden\u2019s handling of classified information. The transcript of the two-day interview between Hur\u2019s team and Biden was released in March ahead of Hur\u2019s testimony before the House Judiciary committee. Hur did not recommend charges against Biden in his report. Through their subpoenas to the DOJ,\u00a0House\u00a0Republicans have argued that the audio recordings are crucial to their impeachment inquiry into Biden, which remains stalled as the prospects of the investigation ending in impeachment are increasingly unlikely. Without the votes in their narrow majority or evidence of an impeachable offense, Republicans are now struggling with how to end their probe and are looking for ways to\u00a0target other members of the Biden administration. The White House pointed out that the Department of Justice has already provided the transcripts of the special counsel\u2019s interviews with Biden and his ghostwriter, and has complied with the other aspects of the initial subpoena from Republicans. \u201cBecause of the President\u2019s longstanding commitment to protecting the integrity, effectiveness, and independence of the Department of Justice and its law enforcement investigations, he has decided to assert executive privilege over the recordings,\u201d White House Counsel Edward Siskel wrote to House Oversight Chair James Comer and House Judiciary Chair Jim Jordan. Siskel accused Republicans of wanting to distort the audio recordings and criticized them for going after prosecutors they do not agree with. \u201cThe absence of a legitimate need for the audio recordings lays bare your likely goal \u2014 to chop them up, distort them, and use them for partisan political purposes,\u201d Siskel wrote. In light of the White House asserting executive privilege, the Department of Justice called on House Republicans to cancel their scheduled contempt proceedings. \u201cWith the information you now have, the Committees ought not proceed with contempt and should instead avoid unnecessary and unwarranted conflict,\u201d Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legislative Affairs Carlos Uriarte wrote. Uriarte\u00a0also defended the need to protect the audio tapes:\u00a0\u201cWe have repeatedly made clear that disclosure of the subpoenaed audio recordings would damage future law enforcement efforts and that the Committees\u2019 continued demands raise serious separation of powers concerns.\u201d In April, CNN sued\u00a0for\u00a0access to the recordings of Biden\u2019s interview. Garland denounced Republican-led attacks on the Justice Department in remarks following the announcement that Biden would assert executive privilege. \u201cThe Justice Department is a fundamental institution of our democracy,\u201d Garland told reporters at the Justice Department in Washington, DC. \u201cPeople depend on us to ensure that our investigations and prosecutions are conducted according to the facts and the law and without political influence.\u201d The White House asserted executive privilege at the request of Garland, who wrote to the president on Wednesday. In their contempt reports, Republicans stated that the DOJ does not get to determine what information is useful to their investigation, and\u00a0argued\u00a0that the verbal nuances of an audio recording provide unique insight into a subject that are not reflected in a transcript. \u201cThe Constitution does not permit the executive branch to dictate to Congress how to proceed with an impeachment inquiry or to conduct its oversight,\u201d the report reads. Republicans, meanwhile, argue\u00a0in their report\u00a0that while the transcripts of the interviews reflect what was said, \u201cthey do not reflect important verbal context, such as tone or tenor, or nonverbal context, such as pauses or pace of delivery.\u201d Such pauses and inflections, Republicans claim, \u201ccan provide indications of a witness\u2019s ability to recall events, or whether the individual is intentionally giving evasive or nonresponsive testimony to investigators.\u201d Republicans pointed to a recent example of when a transcript and audio recording of the president diverged,\u00a0stating that\u00a0at a speech last month, Biden read a teleprompter cue out loud during his speech, which was reflected in the recording of the event but not in the initial transcript of his remarks. The House Oversight Committee pushed back the start time of its Thursday markup so that Republican committee members could attend the criminal trial of former President Donald Trump in New York City, two sources familiar with the planning told CNN. When asked to comment on the reason for the schedule change, an Oversight Committee spokeswoman told CNN, \u201cDue to member schedule conflicts, the markup is now starting at a different time to accommodate members\u2019 schedules.\u201d Once the Oversight Committee markup proceedings began, it didn\u2019t take long to devolve into chaos as\u00a0GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York\u00a0\u00a0briefly locked into a heated back and forth. The markup went into the late hours of the night before the panel voted to advance contempt proceedings\u00a0against Garland.

{"id": "2024_05_15_politics_presidential-debate-or-prize-fight-trump-biden", "text": "Joe Biden sounded more like a professional wrestler than a president when he issued a vertical video social media debate challenge to his rival Wednesday morning. \u201cDonald Trump lost two debates to me in 2020!\u201d Biden said at the outset of the 14-second video, during which he also found time to: \u201cLet\u2019s get ready to Rumble!!!\u201d Trump said, accepting the challenge on his social media platform with a nod to words that typically open boxing matches. The debates are set for June 27 on CNN and September 10 on ABC News. While Biden proposed two meetings and a vice presidential in late July, Trump\u2019s campaign suggested debates in July and August \u2013 the months when the Republican and Democratic nominating conventions are taking place \u2013 as well. \u201dI think we should go two hours,\u201d Trump said during an interview with the conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt, an attempt to criticize Biden\u2019s endurance. Trump added that the debaters should be required to stand at a podium rather than sit. \u201cI think a debate should be standing up,\u201d he said. Both men, well into their Social Security and Medicare years, would like to appear as forceful as possible. CNN invited the presumptive nominees to debate on the network on June 27 at CNN\u2019s studio in Atlanta. It\u2019ll be on cable, so not exactly pay-per-view, but certainly not the aired-everywhere style that has become typical of presidential debate since the Commission on Presidential Debates started sponsoring them in 1988. Those commission-sponsored debates were broadcast on every network with the same sets reused every four years and conducted usually at colleges and universities with live audiences. A town hall version allowed select voters to ask questions of both candidates. The commission said its debates are planned and it will carry forward with planning. The CNN debate, on the other hand, will be conducted in a TV studio with no audience, which means no applause or cheering. While the specific format for the ABC News debate has not been announced, a debate at ABC News studios in New York would harken back to the first televised presidential debates in 1960, when John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon debated four times. While he has accepted both invitations, Trump was already criticizing the idea of an in-studio debate. In a social media post that included an insult for Biden, Trump said he preferred, \u201cfor excitement purposes, a very large venue, although\u00a0Biden\u00a0is supposedly afraid of crowds.\u201d Still, Biden\u2019s challenge and Trump\u2019s response were not entirely spontaneous. From CNN\u2019s report: Informal conversations between the Biden and Trump campaigns about debates have taken place in recent weeks and were largely focused on a mutual disdain for the Commission\u00a0on Presidential Debates and potential scenarios to work around the commission, three sources familiar with the discussions told CNN.\u00a0The Washington Post was first\u00a0to report on those conversations. June is already shaping up to be an exceptionally busy month in US politics. The Supreme Court could rule then on whether Trump should enjoy any sort of absolute immunity from prosecution. Biden\u2019s son Hunter faces two separate criminal trials, one for tax evasion in Los Angeles and the other for a rarely prosecuted gun charge in Delaware. CNN\u2019s debate that month will come before either party conducts its nominating convention, presumably before Trump picks a running mate, and much earlier than the commission\u2019s planned debates, the first of which had been scheduled for September. After grumbling from both campaigns, the Commission on Presidential Debates issued a statement arguing that beginning in September would still allow for early voters to watch before making a decision. The campaigns clearly disagreed; Trump and Biden have both argued that earlier debates are warranted since many Americans are likely to vote early in the months before Election Day on November 5. Biden, for his part, may be looking for a quicker opportunity to reset the narrative of the campaign, in which his arguments about the strength of the economy or the threat Trump poses to democracy have not yet helped him gain traction in battleground states. Trump, meanwhile, could benefit from turning the conversation away from his criminal trials and work to harden perceptions of Biden as soon as possible. One person who has already indicated he is not thrilled with the debate plans: independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. In order to qualify for CNN\u2019s debate, a candidate must be polling at or above 15% in four national polls of registered or likely voters between March 13 and June 20 and be on the ballot in enough states to conceivably win 270 electoral votes, according to a news release from CNN. ABC News outlined similar criteria. For now, that would exclude Kennedy. In a post on X, he accused the campaigns of \u201ccolluding\u201d to keep him off the stage.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/politics/presidential-debate-or-prize-fight-trump-biden/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/20/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_18_politics_trump-nra-convention-guns", "text": "In May 2016, near the zenith of its political sway, the National Rifle Association endorsed Donald Trump for president in a symbolic but forceful show of support for a Republican whose commitment to gun owners was still largely unknown. The group then spent more than $30 million to help elect Trump that November. Trump arrived here Saturday for the NRA\u2019s annual convention having proved himself a reliable ally of Second Amendment activists over the intervening eight years. Significantly less clear, though, is how much the NRA can help Trump\u2019s bid to win the White House once again. The NRA enters the 2024 election cycle with its future uncertain and relevance in question. A series of cascading scandals related to financial misconduct have badly damaged the reputation and coffers of the nation\u2019s most prominent gun rights group, culminating in February with\u00a0a New York jury finding the organization and top executives liable in a civil corruption case. Amid the turmoil, the NRA\u2019s longtime CEO, Wayne LaPierre, stepped down. After several years of internal power struggles, the organization will attempt this weekend to install new leadership. It\u2019s a stunning fall for a group that at its peak commanded enough Republican votes in Congress to stall almost any action to restrict firearms, even amid periods of national grief over mass shootings. \u201cI haven\u2019t heard anything about the NRA since I literally can\u2019t remember when,\u201d said one veteran Republican strategist, who nevertheless\u00a0asked not to be named in order to speak freely. \u201cIt\u2019s been years, plural. I\u2019ve heard nothing. Full stop, nothing.\u201d The strategist added: \u201cI just think they\u2019re not relevant anymore.\u201d Trump, for his part, has publicly stood by the embattled organization. Political organizers affiliated with the NRA were among a recent gathering of conservative groups at Mar-a-Lago arranged by the Trump campaign to plot a grassroots strategy for the fall, a source with knowledge of the meeting told CNN. The campaign did not respond to questions about the looming NRA leadership vote, but two close allies, South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem and the former president\u2019s son Donald Trump Jr., have at various times been linked to the top job. Addressing the NRA\u2019s annual meeting Saturday, Trump said the rights of gun owners were \u201cunder siege\u201d and urged them to get active this political cycle. \u201cGun owners don\u2019t vote. What is that all about? I\u2019ve heard that. \u2026 If gun owners voted, we would swamp them at levels that nobody\u2019s ever seen before. So I think you\u2019re a rebellious bunch, but let\u2019s be rebellious and vote this time, OK?\u201d he said. Trump, who was endorsed by the NRA\u2019s political arm Saturday, boasted that as president he stood by the organization and did not bow to pressure to implement new gun restrictions. \u201cWe\u2019re under siege, but they didn\u2019t move us an inch, and we have to stand strong,\u201d he said. Trump\u2019s appearance put him in a firmly red state in front of a loyal crowd on one of the few days he\u2019s not required in Manhattan for his criminal hush money trial. It follows another campaign\u00a0stop outside the battleground map last weekend in reliably blue New Jersey. Trump will also speak at a Libertarian Party conference in Washington, DC, next weekend. However, the former president has also used his days off from court to raise money as his campaign continues an aggressive push to catch up to President Joe Biden\u2019s growing war chest. Trump has spent the majority of his time outside the courtroom hosting and attending fundraisers \u2014 including one Friday in Minnesota and three others this week. Despite the NRA\u2019s recent tumult and Trump\u2019s limited opportunities to campaign, the annual gathering of gun enthusiasts remains a critical constituency for fundraising, said Bryan Lanza, a Republican lobbyist who was part of the former president\u2019s\u00a02016 campaign. \u201cDonald Trump has funded his campaign primarily on small-dollar\u00a0donations,\u201d Lanza said. \u201cThe NRA is a small-dollar organization that has built a behemoth,\u00a0if not a political giant,\u00a0in the United States. Their convention draws in 20,000, maybe even 30,000 folks,\u00a0who are passionate about guns,\u00a0who spend money. That seems like the audience I\u2019d want to be speaking to,\u00a0even if it was in Wyoming.\u201d The NRA did not respond to a request for comment. As he seeks a second term, Trump has promised to remain an unflinching supporter of the NRA and its agenda to unravel four years of Biden\u2019s\u00a0actions\u00a0on guns. Biden\u2019s campaign has branded Trump \u201cthe greatest defender of the Second Amendment to ever occupy the White House.\u201d Trump\u2019s speech was short on specifics about what he would do to protect or expand gun rights in a second term, but he promised to \u201croll back every Biden attack on the Second Amendment.\u201d He sought to remind the friendly crowd of his administration\u2019s accomplishments while arguing that another four years of Biden\u2019s leadership would result in more firearms and gun owners being targeted. The Biden campaign and gun safety groups are eager to remind voters of Trump\u2019s alliance with the NRA and opposition to certain gun restrictions, believing it could motivate suburban parents worried about the next school shooting and minority communities that deal with daily gun violence. Trump\u2019s position on guns is expected to become a \u201chuge\u201d part of this campaign in the coming months, one Biden official familiar with the strategy told CNN. \u201cDonald Trump is winning no new voters when he boasts about doing nothing about gun violence during his presidency. Period,\u201d said Nick Suplina, a senior vice president at Everytown for Gun Safety, a group founded in the aftermath of the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. Suplina said Trump\u2019s NRA appearance \u201cshows that both the organization and the man are a bit desperate for each other. Trump needs the crowd, the NRA needs the political relevance.\u201d As with many issues, Trump\u2019s stance on gun control has shifted throughout his decades in the public spotlight. Prior to running for office, Trump supported an assault weapons ban, but he\u00a0backed away from that stance during his first presidential campaign. After a gunman opened fire at a Parkland, Florida, high school in 2018, killing 17 students and staff, Trump appeared to briefly embrace a host of measures to restrict gun sales,\u00a0only to quickly pivot again amid intense lobbying from the NRA. Trump did address one concern of gun safety activists when his administration moved unilaterally to ban bump stocks, devices that enable a rifle to fire hundreds of rounds of ammunition per minute. The Supreme Court earlier this year heard oral arguments in a case seeking to overturn the Trump-era regulation. \u201cIf President Trump regrets that decision, that\u2019s something he should come out and say because gun owners are not going to forget that,\u201d said Aidan Johnston, a lobbyist for the Gun Owners of America, an organization that has at times criticized the NRA for not being vigilant enough in pushing for fewer gun restrictions. Trump\u2019s relative inaction stood at the heart of the stark divisions that emerged between Biden and Trump over firearms during their 2020 race. Among both gun safety advocates and gun rights groups, there\u2019s little disagreement about the stakes in 2024. Johnston called Biden \u201cperhaps the most anti-gun president in American history.\u201d Suplina said the current commander in chief was \u201cthe strongest gun-sense president in history.\u201d Biden as president has championed new restrictions on firearms, including bipartisan passage in 2022 of the most comprehensive gun safety legislation in three decades \u2013 a sweeping bill to strengthen background checks. Biden has\u00a0also created the White House Office\u00a0of Gun Violence Prevention and has issued a range of modest executive measures aimed at reducing gun violence. Among them are new regulations on the makers of \u201cghost gun\u201d kits, which allow people to build untraceable guns at home, requiring the same compliance with federal laws imposed on commercially sold firearms. If reelected, Biden has said he would continue to pursue a long-sought ban on the AR-15, the firearm linked to many of America\u2019s deadliest mass shootings. Trump in February vowed to undo any steps taken by Biden to regulate guns \u201cmy very first week back in office, perhaps my first day.\u201d A top priority is halting a proposed rule from the Biden administration to bar hunters from using lead ammunition on certain federal lands. \u201cFirearm owners, gun manufacturers, and our beautiful 2A community know President Trump is the only one who has and will proudly stand for their Second Amendment rights guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution \u2013 which shall not be infringed,\u201d Trump campaign spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said in a statement to CNN.

{"id": "2024_05_17_politics_brown-v-board-of-education-anniversary-supreme-court", "text": "Seventy years after the Supreme Court acknowledged that \u201cseparate but equal\u201d had no place in the United States, one of history\u2019s most celebrated legal opinions is being used by conservative groups to challenge race-related policies in schools across the country. In a remarkable demonstration of the Supreme Court\u2019s power to shape American life, the 1954 unanimous decision in Brown v. Board of Education required the integration of public schools \u2013 a landmark victory for the civil rights movement. The high court handed down its decision 70 years ago Friday. Speaking in Texas last week, conservative Justice Brett Kavanaugh described the decision as one of several that are now part of the \u201cfabric of America.\u201d But a conflict over the decision\u2019s meaning is playing out in a series of lawsuits challenging efforts to foster classroom diversity, in which conservative groups are arguing that Brown requires schools and government programs to be totally colorblind. Civil rights groups say that recasts a decision that was intended to rectify the nation\u2019s history with racism. \u201cBrown is being weaponized against the very people it was intended to directly serve,\u201d Janai Nelson, president and director-counsel of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, told CNN. \u201cAnd that is largely a result of the Supreme Court never giving the 14th Amendment the full and robust interpretation that is required to sustain a multiracial democracy.\u201d Meanwhile, experts note that many of the nation\u2019s schools remain deeply segregated. \u201cNot only has Brown failed to deliver on its promise, right-wing groups have co-opted Brown and turned it into a sword to discredit efforts to integrate our schools,\u201d said Jonathan Feingold, a Boston University law professor and expert on affirmative action and antidiscrimination law. \u201cAs a country, we seem to have accepted a status quo in which Black and brown students, and many Asian American students, do not receive equal educational opportunities.\u201d Conservative groups push a \u2018colorblind\u2019 reading The current Supreme Court reenergized that debate last year with a blockbuster decision ending affirmative action in college admissions at Harvard and the University of North Carolina. The meaning of Brown was hotly contested in that case, and the Supreme Court\u2019s conservative majority said in its decision that the precedent stood for all but eliminating the consideration of race. \u201cThe conclusion reached by the Brown Court was thus unmistakably clear: the right to a public education \u2018must be made available to all on equal terms,\u2019\u201d Chief Justice John Roberts wrote for the 6-3 majority in the UNC opinion. \u201cThe time for making distinctions based on race had passed.\u201d Led by Justice Sonia Sotomayor, the court\u2019s liberal wing disputed that reading. \u201cIn Brown v. Board of Education, the court recognized the constitutional necessity of racially integrated schools in light of the harm inflicted by segregation,\u201d Sotomayor wrote in a scathing dissent. \u201cToday, this court stands in the way and rolls back decades of precedent and momentous progress.\u201d Though the fight over race-conscious admissions was settled, the court\u2019s decision in the Harvard case and the debate over color-blind versus race-conscience policies have emerged in a series of other lawsuits, such as challenges to workplace diversity programs and recent fights over redistricting. Schools and conservative groups, meanwhile, are also sparring in court over policies that promote student diversity without relying directly on race. Students for Fair Admissions, the group that successfully sued over admissions at Harvard and UNC, is now challenging the University of Texas at Austin for its policy of collecting racial data of applicants. In a filing earlier this year, the group claimed the Supreme Court\u2019s decision last year on college admissions \u201cbuilt on Brown\u2019s legacy\u201d and required courts to view the Constitution as requiring a \u201ccolor-blind\u201d approach. \u201cBrown v. Board was perhaps the most consequential Supreme Court opinion in the last one-hundred years,\u201d the group\u2019s president, Edward Blum, told CNN in a statement. \u201cFor a significant majority of Americans of all races, this case established the doctrine of \u2018colorblind\u2019 public policies to which all levels of government must adhere.\u201d The university has said it doesn\u2019t use the racial data to make decisions about applicants. The libertarian Pacific Legal Foundation has challenged an elite Virginia high school\u2019s proposal to accept a set number of students from each of the county\u2019s middle schools. Parents represented by the group sued the Fairfax County, Virginia, school board in 2021, alleging its policy violated the Constitution by seeking to balance the student body\u2019s racial makeup at the expense of Asian Americans. A federal appeals court in Richmond disagreed. The Supreme Court in February declined to hear that case. But similar cases are already on the way. The group has another appeal challenging admissions practices at three selective public schools in Boston that currently is pending at the Supreme Court. That appeal cites Brown v. Board in a footnote, asserting that the justices have \u201cstruggled with cases involving racial discrimination in education\u201d for more than a century. School segregation up in large districts, study finds Anastasia Boden, a senior attorney at the Pacific Legal Foundation, said that Brown was an important step in ensuring that Americans aren\u2019t treated differently based on their race. \u201cFulfilling Brown\u2019s promise means ending discrimination in all of its forms, including modern forms, whereby schools pass new admissions policy for the explicit purpose of \u2018racial balancing,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cThe consequence of racial balancing in schools is excluding some students \u2013 usually Asian students \u2013 solely because of their race.\u201d But the goal of Brown was never \u201cequal representation,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was equal treatment based on race and the elimination of racial discrimination in the law.\u201d Civil rights groups say that argument misreads the history and meaning of the seminal decision. David Hinojosa, an attorney with the Lawyers\u2019 Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, argued in favor of affirmative action in the UNC case before the Supreme Court in 2022. Hinojosa, who represented students and alumni, described Brown as an attempt to \u201cshut down this nation\u2019s terrible caste system,\u201d not turn a blind eye toward it. \u201cI didn\u2019t think the Supreme Court would go as far as it did,\u201d Hinojosa said, referring to the college admissions case. \u201cFor a majority to suggest that Brown v. Board supports the exclusion of highly qualified brown and Black students \u2026 is a travesty.\u201d A product of Chief Justice Earl Warren\u2019s court, both sides agree Brown v. Board was a monumentally important win for civil rights \u2013 though it took years, subsequent appeals and military intervention by President Dwight Eisenhower to begin to carry it out. During confirmation hearings for both Kavanaugh and Justice Amy Coney Barrett, senators needled the then-nominees about whether Brown is settled law. They did so in an effort to highlight distinctions between how former President Donald Trump\u2019s nominees described Brown compared with Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision that established a constitutional right to abortion and that the court overturned in 2022. Kavanaugh, during his 2018 hearings, repeatedly described Brown as the \u201cgreatest moment in Supreme Court history.\u201d Barrett noted that she had previously said in writing that Brown \u201cwas correct as an original matter.\u201d And yet the Brown ruling also underscored the limits of the Supreme Court\u2019s power. Though public schools are no longer segregated by law, they have also never been fully integrated. Racial segregation has increased 64% since 1988 in the nation\u2019s 100 largest school districts, according to a study this month from Stanford University and the University of Southern California. The study\u2019s authors pinned the increase on school districts that have been released from court-ordered desegregation plans and an increase in school choice programs. Advocates such as Hinojosa say the numbers reflect precisely what Brown sought to avoid. Now, Hinojosa said, the decision is being used by \u201canti-civil rights groups to further segregate schools.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/17/politics/brown-v-board-of-education-anniversary-supreme-court/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/20/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_17_politics_biden-black-voters", "text": "President Joe Biden is working to reverse an erosion of support among Black voters this week, placing renewed focus on a group he hopes can once again help propel him to the White House like they did four years ago. A string of events designed to commemorate civil rights milestones and address the next generation of leaders at Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s alma mater comes amid polls showing Black voters flocking from Biden, frustrated by what they regard as inaction on their top priorities and turned off by his handling of the economy and the Israel-Hamas war. In marking the anniversary of the historic Brown v. Board of Education case that found laws promoting segregation unconstitutional, Biden hopes to reiterate his commitment to promoting and advancing historic gains by the Black community over the past 70 years. And a speech at Morehouse College in Atlanta on Sunday, already the subject of controversy amid nationwide campus protests, will aim to uplift the next generation of Black men \u2013 a voting group where Biden\u2019s decline in support has been most marked. Since the Civil Rights era, Democratic presidential candidates have enjoyed wide support from Black voters. Yet leaders of several Black grassroots organizations have warned the president\u00a0should not take for granted the support of Black Americans. In the months before November, Biden is hoping both to underscore his own record and to reinvigorate the memories of all voters about what life was like under a Trump presidency. \u201cHe has to answer two questions: Why go out and bother to vote, which is almost the same question of what\u2019s in it for me for voters,\u201d said Biden campaign co-chair Cedric Richmond. \u201cAnd then he has to answer the Janet Jackson test of: \u2018What have you done for me lately?\u2019\u201d In a radio interview taped Tuesday, Biden urged Black voters to \u201cremember who Trump is.\u201d \u201cHe falsely accused the Central Park Five,\u201d Biden told Darian \u201cBig Tigger\u201d Morgan on V-103.3 in Atlanta. \u201cHe\u2019s a founder of birtherism, he tried to repeal Obamacare the first time \u2013 now he\u2019s promised to do even more damage.\u201d Sharpening the contrast with Trump has been of vital importance for Biden as he works to improve his standing in polls. Nowhere is that imperative more critical than with Black Americans. Many polls have found them more disconnected from the Democratic Party than they have been in decades. Biden often cites issues like infrastructure investments and\u00a0canceling student debt when promoting his record to Black voters. He\u2019s also taken steps on loosening rules on marijuana, including Thursday when the Justice Department formally began the process of rescheduling the drug. On other issues, however, his campaign promises have fallen short, including a push for sweeping legislation to protect voting rights. While Biden often cites issues like infrastructure investments, his pardons of federal marijuana offenders and canceling student debt, on other issues his campaign promises have fallen short, including a push for sweeping legislation to protect voting rights. A New York Times/Siena College survey of battleground states released this week found Trump winning more than 20% of Black voters in a two-way matchup with Biden, which would amount to a historic high if it translates to votes in November. Trump won roughly 1 in 10 Black voters nationally in 2020, according to multiple estimates, including 12% in CNN\u2019s exit poll. \u201cThere are people in the Black community who are feeling like not a lot has changed,\u201d\u00a0Bernice King, the daughter of the late civil rights leader, told Bloomberg this week. Black voters have historically been a rock-solid portion of Biden\u2019s voter base and the president\u2019s history with the community runs deep. The president was inspired to run for political office by the Civil Rights Movement in the 1960s and served as vice president to the country\u2019s first Black president. Those deep connections have faced tests throughout Biden\u2019s decadeslong career but proved critical in launching him to the White House in 2020. That deep relationship is sure to be crucial again this year for the president\u2019s hopes of retaining his spot in the White House, especially in battlegrounds like Georgia and Michigan \u2013 both states that Biden has on his travel schedule over the next few days. \u201cI got involved in politics because of the African American community,\u201d he told a mainly Black audience in Wisconsin earlier this month. On Thursday, Biden met in the Oval Office with plaintiffs in the key Supreme Court case that overturned racial segregation in schools. On Friday, he sought to strike a sharp contrast with Trump in remarks at the National Museum of African American History and Culture before a meeting with members of the Divine Nine, a collection of historic Black fraternities and sororities. \u201cMy predecessor and his extreme MAGA friends are now going after diversity, equity and inclusion all across America. They want a country for some \u2013 not for all,\u201d Biden said. \u201cMy predecessor and extreme MAGA friends are responsible for taking away other fundamental freedoms: from the freedom to vote to the freedom to choose. But I\u2019ve always believed that the promise of America is big enough for everyone to succeed \u2013 and I mean that \u2013 everyone to succeed. That\u2019s what Brown is all about,\u201d he continued. After his Morehouse commencement address in Atlanta on Sunday, he\u2019ll travel to Detroit to address an NAACP Fight for Freedom dinner. Speaking after the meeting between Biden and the plaintiffs in the Brown case \u2013 during which those plaintiffs and their relatives urged the president to make the anniversary of the decision a national holiday \u2013 NAACP President Derrick Johnson dismissed the polling that showed an erosion of support for the president among Black voters. \u201cPolls have proven themselves to be untruthful the last four election cycles,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cWhat I do believe is, we are at a crisis of our democracy. We must decide whether we\u2019re going to have a functioning democracy that\u2019s representing all of the citizens, or something less than that.\u201d Originally inspired to run in 2020 by the 2017 rally of White supremacists in Charlottesville, Biden has not shied away from mentioning the United States\u2019 history of racism \u2013 at times being even more explicit about the way the country has failed its Black citizens than former President Barack Obama. During his inaugural address in January 2021, Biden explicitly denounced White supremacy and terrorism while appealing to the country to heal its deepening racial divisions. \u201cA cry for racial justice, some 400 years in the making, moves us,\u201d Biden said during his inauguration. \u201cThe dream of justice for all will be deferred no longer.\u201d And earlier this year, Biden made a pilgrimage to South Carolina \u2013 the state with a strong Black Democratic coalition that helped propel Biden to the Democratic nomination in 2020, and eventually, the presidency. Speaking at the Mother Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, the site of a 2015 mass shooting by a White supremacist, Biden credited Black people in South Carolina, and especially Rep. Jim Clyburn, for placing him in the White House. \u201cIt\u2019s because of this congregation and the Black community of South Carolina \u2013 and it\u2019s not an exaggeration \u2013\u00a0and Jim Clyburn that I stand here today as your president. And I\u2019ve done my best to honor your trust,\u201d he said. White supremacy, Biden said in that speech, is \u201ca poison.\u201d \u201cThroughout our history, it\u2019s\u00a0ripped this nation apart.\u00a0This has no place in America. Not today, tomorrow or ever,\u201d the president said. But the base of support Biden has traditionally enjoyed from Black voters hasn\u2019t been without its tests. While running for president in 2020, Biden suggested in an interview with Charlamagne tha God that Black supporters struggling to choose between him and Trump \u201cain\u2019t Black.\u201d He later acknowledged\u00a0he should not have said that. As he runs for reelection, Biden has sought to underscore accomplishments that have benefited Black Americans. In the radio interview conducted this week, Biden pointed to Covid-19 vaccinations, $1,400 checks during the pandemic, increases in Black homeownership, efforts to fight racial bias in home appraisal, efforts to bolster Black small businesses, HBCU support, health care and tackling junk fees. Trump, Biden said, \u201chas a fundamentally different view of Americans than I do. And it\u2019s all about hate, retribution,\u201d he said of his predecessor. Biden\u2019s advisers argue reminding voters of the Trump presidency, including transforming the Supreme Court into a conservative majority with the appointment of three justices, and warning what a second term could look like will be key to their work in the coming months. \u201cPeople may not believe, but a court case can be revisited,\u201d said Richmond, a former congressman and White House senior adviser. \u201cTrump\u2019s court would absolutely put Brown vs. Board of Education back in play. They may put Plessy vs. Ferguson back in play.\u201d Pressed on a lack of voter enthusiasm for the November election, Biden said that many Americans aren\u2019t yet focused on voting and complained that it is \u201chard to get legitimate information from news sources.\u201d But voters may soon become more engaged: Biden and Trump are set next month for their\u00a0first debate of the 2024 campaign cycle.

{"id": "2024_05_18_politics_rudy-giuliani-served-arizona-indictment", "text": "Rudy Giuliani was served Friday with notice of his indictment related to an\u00a0alleged scheme to overturn the 2020 election results\u00a0in Arizona, according to Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes. \u201cThe final defendant was served moments ago,\u201d Mayes, a Democrat, said in a\u00a0post on X in which Giuliani is tagged.\u00a0\u201c@RudyGiuliani nobody is above the law.\u201d The summons is a formal notice that a defendant has been criminally charged and must appear before a judge. Richie Taylor, a spokesperson for Mayes, previously told CNN that the attorney general\u2019s office had tried for weeks to locate Giuliani. Caroline Wren, a GOP operative and adviser to Arizona Senate candidate Kari Lake, told CNN she was hosting Giuliani\u2019s 80th birthday party in Palm Beach, Florida, on Friday evening when the former New York City mayor was served. An attendee of the party told CNN that Giuliani was served papers by two agents of the Arizona attorney general\u2019s office in the late hours of the birthday bash.\u00a0\u201cThey\u00a0stormed him on his way out,\u201d the attendee said, adding that \u201cmany of the guests were visibly upset.\u201d \u201cThe mayor was unfazed by the decision to try and embarrass him during his 80th birthday party. He enjoyed an incredible evening with hundreds of people who love him\u2014from all walks of life \u2014 and we look forward to full vindication soon,\u201d said Ted Goodman, a spokesperson for Giuliani. CNN has reached out to Mayes\u2019 office for comment. On Friday evening, Giuliani tweeted a taunting message and photo of himself surrounded by smiling friends.\u00a0\u201cIf\u00a0Arizona authorities can\u2019t find me by tomorrow morning,\u201d he wrote in a now-deleted tweet,\u00a0\u201c1.\u00a0They must dismiss the indictment; 2. They must concede they can\u2019t count votes.\u201d Hours later, Giuliani was served notice of the indictment. Giuliani is expected to appear Tuesday for an arraignment in Phoenix unless he is granted a delay by the court. Giuliani is among a group of former President Donald Trump\u2019s allies indicted last month in Arizona alongside the 11 individuals who acted as fake GOP electors from the state in the 2020 presidential election. The individual who CNN has\u00a0identified as Giuliani is described in the indictment as spreading false claims of voter fraud across the country after the 2020 election, falsely claiming Arizona officials\u00a0\u201cmade\u00a0no effort to find out\u201d whether the vote was accurate, and encouraging\u00a0\u201cRepublican\u00a0electors in Arizona and in six other contested states to vote for Trump-Pence on December 14, 2020.\u201d Former Trump lawyer John Eastman was the first defendant charged in the Arizona case to appear in court. He\u00a0pleaded not guilty\u00a0in Phoenix on Friday on charges related to allegedly participating in a conspiracy to overturn the 2020 election results in Arizona. The others, including Giuliani, are scheduled to follow suit in the coming weeks. The Arizona indictment is just the latest legal woe for Giuliani stemming from his time as Trump\u2019s attorney after the 2020 presidential election. He\u00a0filed for bankruptcy\u00a0in federal court in New York in December days after a jury ordered him to\u00a0pay nearly $150 million to two former Georgia election workers for making defamatory statements about them. Giuliani is also an unindicted co-conspirator in Trump\u2019s federal election subversion case, faces 13 charges in the\u00a0Georgia election subversion case,\u00a0and is being sued for defamation by both Dominion and Smartmatic, voting technology companies that he falsely said rigged the 2020 election.

Ted Cruz\u2019s 2016 GOP presidential campaign. \u201cAlice was wonderful and talented and a dear friend,\u201d Cruz said in a post on X. \u201cShe lived every day to the fullest, and she will be deeply missed.\u201d CNN hired Stewart as a political commentator ahead of the 2016 election, and she appeared on air frequently to provide insight on the political news of the day, including as recently as Friday on \u201cThe Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer.\u201d \u201cWe always invited her to come on my show because we knew we would be a little bit smarter at the end of that conversation,\u201d Blitzer told Jessica Dean on \u201cCNN Newsroom.\u201d \u201cShe helped our viewers better appreciate what was going on and that\u2019s why we will miss her so much.\u201d CNN anchor and chief political correspondent Dana Bash, who knew Stewart for nearly two decades after first meeting her when Stewart worked for the Huckabee campaign, remembered her Saturday as \u201csomebody who told it straight.\u201d \u201cOne of the many reasons why she was so valuable to us on our political panels \u2026 is because she brought that experience,\u201d Bash added. \u201cShe brought that understanding of how Republican politics, Republican campaigns work and she never, ever did it with anything other than a smile.\u201d Speaking about her role as a commentator for the network, Stewart told\u00a0Harvard Political Review\u00a0in 2020 that she brings \u201ca perspective that I think CNN appreciates.\u201d \u201cMy position at CNN is to be a conservative voice yet an independent thinker,\u201d Stewart said. \u201cI\u2019m not a Kool-Aid drinker; I\u2019m not a never-Trumper, and I didn\u2019t check my common sense and decency at the door when I voted for (Trump).\u201d Former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson on Saturday remembered Stewart as \u201csomeone that believes that politics was about making friends and not creating enemies.\u201d He shared with CNN that Stewart \u201cwas one of the first ones to call me and encourage me\u201d after he\u00a0suspended his presidential campaign\u00a0earlier this year, and that they spoke just last week \u201cabout the mess that we see in our politics today.\u201d \u201cShe was trying to change that and we\u2019ll miss her,\u201d Hutchinson added. Stewart was a co-host of the\u00a0podcast \u201cHot Mics From Left to Right,\u201d alongside fellow CNN commentator Maria Cardona. \u201cI just can\u2019t believe that she\u2019s gone,\u201d Cardona said on \u201cCNN Newsroom,\u201d adding that the two were going to record an episode of their podcast Saturday. \u201cI want everyone to know what a special person she was, especially in this industry. As you know, today\u2019s politics can be indecent and so dirty, and Alice was just such a loving, shining light.\u201d Stewart also served on the\u00a0senior advisory committee\u00a0at the Institute of Politics at Harvard University\u2019s Kennedy School, where she\u00a0previously was a fellow.

{"id": "2024_05_18_politics_morehouse-college-joe-biden", "text": "Deep divisions and apprehension on the campus of Morehouse College have presented President Joe Biden with a delicate balancing act this weekend as he prepares to deliver the commencement address at the historically Black, all-male college. There have been mixed reactions within the Morehouse community to Biden\u2019s presence on campus as the school braces for enhanced security measures and potential pro-Palestinian protests amid the president\u2019s stalwart support for Israel\u2019s campaign against Hamas. The White House has been working for weeks to quell any concerns, and it hopes the address will give Biden an opportunity to better connect with young Black men, a group that has been increasingly moving away from the president, according to recent polls. \u201cThere\u2019s just an overwhelming sense of confusion and sort of disarray,\u201d said Colin Royal, managing editor of the Maroon Tiger student newspaper and a junior at Morehouse, when asked about the atmosphere on campus. \u201cSome think that it\u2019s a tremendous opportunity to possibly bring a lot of well-needed attention to Morehouse, and some think the opposite.\u201d The president\u2019s support for Israel\u2019s war in Gaza has roiled college campuses across the country, leaving Biden facing a unique circumstance for a Democratic politician: avoiding the progressive college voters who are traditionally very friendly and enthusiastic about supporting the party. Instead, Biden has basically stopped visiting colleges and universities since a January speech during which he was interrupted several times by activists calling for a ceasefire. While Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris have made giving commencement speeches at historically Black colleges and universities a hallmark of their spring schedules, the Morehouse address is under the microscope as a potential litmus test for the president\u2019s strength with young voters of color in the fall. Aware of the difficult task at hand, Biden and his advisers have prepared for the speech in battleground Georgia for weeks. The president\u2019s advisers say he\u2019s intent on keeping the focus on the graduates even as the prospect of protests over Biden\u2019s handling of the war in Gaza lingers over the event. Cedric Richmond, a Morehouse alumnus and co-chair of Biden\u2019s reelection campaign, said he also expects for Biden to talk about \u201covercoming adversity\u201d and the importance of giving back to the community during his keynote address. CNN spoke to 10 students and four faculty members at Morehouse College who had differing opinions on Biden speaking at their school. A divided campus Aylon Gipson, a graduating senior and a member of the Morehouse College Democrats who met with the Biden administration, said he was reassured Biden would deliver remarks \u201cauthentic to Morehouse College\u201d and that the president \u201chas something to say to us that would be impactful for our lives.\u201d Other students who spoke to CNN, however, expressed deep skepticism of the president\u2019s motives for coming to their school. Jalen Silas Burch, a 19-year-old freshman, told CNN that he feels the president\u2019s speech is a move to \u201cpander\u201d to Black male voters. \u201cI feel like it\u2019s just a tactic just to get more and more Black voters because I feel like Biden knows that he has been losing a lot of support, especially this past year,\u201d he said. Some students said they want the president to use the speech to specifically address his support for Israel. \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to Biden coming on campus in order to hear what his speech truly has to say,\u201d said Calvin Bell, 22, a senior. \u201cAs someone who has felt very weird at this portion in time and history, with the tension in Gaza, I think it\u2019s important for Biden to come with the intention of wrestling with the issues at hand, and reassuring students such as myself, as well as our family members, who are a part of the Black community.\u201d Morehouse extended the invitation to Biden to speak at the commencement in September, a month before the Israel-Hamas war started. Biden will receive an honorary Morehouse degree, following a faculty vote earlier in the week. The college told CNN in an email that \u201cit is imperative to clarify that the recent decision to convene to vote to award President Biden an honorary degree is not because of current political affairs.\u201d Since the announcement that Biden would deliver a commencement speech at the HBCU this spring, several student-led protests have taken place on and off the Morehouse campus. The Atlanta University Center Student Intercommunal Coordinating Committee (AUC SICC) has played an instrumental role in planning pro-Palestinian protests on and near Morehouse\u2019s campus throughout the last few months. The committee recently released a letter of demands to the Morehouse Board of Trustees. Among the committee\u2019s demands is an \u201cimmediate divestment from Israeli companies and corporations\u201d and that the college \u201csever all ties with Israel in solidarity with the oppressed Palestinian people.\u201d Michael Henry, a 22-year-old senior who attended an on-campus rally, told CNN that many students are frustrated with Biden and also with the college\u2019s senior leadership for allowing the president to come to speak at the school. \u201cA lot of the administrators at Morehouse, particularly the president (of the college), would like to suggest that the student body is completely split \u2026 that there\u2019s no plurality of views. But I can\u2019t name one person off the top of my head who is really excited that Biden is coming here,\u201d he told CNN. Noah Collier, a senior, told CNN that his school needs to rescind Biden\u2019s invitation because, he says, if the president speaks on his campus this weekend, it \u201cshows our institution\u2019s complicity in all of the injustices created by Biden\u2019s Cabinet and the US government.\u201d Morehouse College President David A. Thomas told CNN on Thursday that he didn\u2019t rescind Biden\u2019s invitation speak because \u201cwe need some place in this country that can hold the tensions that threaten to divide us.\u201d While Thomas acknowledged he considered the president\u2019s reelection effort a possible motivator when inviting him to speak, he said it wouldn\u2019t be in Biden\u2019s interest to \u201cgive a campaign stump speech.\u201d He called on Biden to discuss what the school represents, lay out his vision for \u201ca more inclusive economy\u201d and address the Israel-Hamas war. The school \u201cwill allow silent non-disruptive protest,\u201d but Thomas said he would shut down commencement ceremonies \u201con the spot\u201d if there are any big disruptions preventing attendees\u2019 ability to \u201cpartake and enjoy.\u201d Senior faculty at Morehouse College are hoping to minimize disruptions at the ceremony by holding several meetings with faculty and students in the past few weeks to hear concerns about the president\u2019s upcoming visit. The White House has also gone to campus, sending White House Director of the Office of Public Engagement Steve Benjamin to meet with members of the Morehouse College community this past weekend. During the meeting, which lasted over two hours, some faculty and students told Benjamin that they did not want Biden to deliver a campaign speech during his keynote address at the graduation ceremony. Instead, they wanted him to focus on the students\u2019 accomplishments, according to a person who attended the meeting, who spoke on a condition of anonymity for fear of retribution. Benjamin said Thursday that the meeting was an opportunity to \u201clean in with these young leaders to hear what they wanted to hear on their very special commencement day.\u201d Laying the groundwork for weeks The president\u2019s advisers have consulted Morehouse students, faculty and alumni, including Dr. Eddie Glaude, a Morehouse alumnus and Princeton professor of African American Studies, according to a source familiar with the matter. Biden\u2019s team is also expected to study Obama\u2019s 2013 Morehouse address as they craft the speech, according to a source familiar with the matter. Biden and Harris previously spoke at Morehouse College in 2022 as part of a major voting rights push with legislation stalled on Capitol Hill. They have alternated years speaking at graduation ceremonies at historically Black colleges and universities, with Biden delivering commencement addresses at South Carolina State University in late 2021 and Howard University in 2023. Harris spoke at Tennessee State University\u2019s commencement exercises in 2022. The White House has been preparing for the possibility of protests at Sunday\u2019s event, according to a source familiar with the matter. Heightened security presence Morehouse College is also taking additional steps to increase security in response to Biden\u2019s upcoming visit after protests on its campus. Senior faculty advisers helping prepare for the graduation ceremony this weekend held a meeting with the Secret Service and are monitoring student protests that are expected to happen this week, according to a source familiar with these conversations. Student volunteers assisting with the graduation ceremony at Morehouse College are also required this year to undergo a virtual de-escalation training with the Morehouse College Police Department before the graduation ceremony, according to an email obtained by CNN. The de-escalation training is aimed at preparing these students to \u201caddress challenging situations that may arise\u201d during the ceremony that could require them to intervene, according to the email. The college has also cleared out academic buildings and student housing located near where the commencement speech is supposed to be held due to security reasons. This move has forced many students who are staying on campus after final exams to relocate to other buildings that are farther away from where the graduation ceremony is supposed to take place. Stephane Dunn, a professor who has taught at the college for over 16 years, said that the Morehouse College faculty\u2019s overall concern about Biden attending the graduation is that it will overshadow the event\u2019s main purpose, which is to celebrate the nearly 500 students who are graduating. \u201cThe number one conversation going on is that this graduation is not for President Biden. \u2026 The commencement at Morehouse on Sunday will be about the students primarily. It\u2019s their story. It\u2019s their chapter that is ending and about the other chapter that is beginning,\u201d Dunn said.

{"id": "2024_05_18_politics_fafsa-problems-low-income-families", "text": "At Robert M. La Follette High School in Madison, Wisconsin, some college-bound seniors are still scrambling to submit their federal financial aid forms \u2013 but it\u2019s not for lack of trying. One student and his father, for example, spent more than three hours sitting with a high school counselor in early May trying to submit the FAFSA, the Free Application for Federal Student Aid. But no matter what they tried, they couldn\u2019t find a way around a technical glitch. And it wasn\u2019t the student\u2019s first attempt. He sat with a high school counselor several times since January to try to submit the FAFSA. \u201cYou just feel terrible,\u201d said Vanessa Hlavacka, a counselor for multilingual students at La Follette High School. \u201cIt was the dad\u2019s only day off, and he spent it in my office trying to figure this out,\u201d she said. A botched rollout of an updated version of the FAFSA \u2013 which must be submitted if a student wants to qualify for certain loans, grants and scholarships \u2013 has resulted in multiple problems and delays this year. Submissions across the country are way down, and many students are stuck in limbo, waiting for financial aid information from schools even after the traditional May 1 college decision deadline has come and gone. For many students, the problems with this year\u2019s FAFSA have made a previously frustrating process even more stressful. But for some low-income students, who are most reliant on financial aid, the ripple effects could be long-lasting. Although La Follette has ramped up its support services, roughly half as many of the school\u2019s seniors have been able to successfully submit the FAFSA so far compared with last year\u2019s senior class. \u201cWe are so concerned and worried that these students will not make it to college in the fall,\u201d said Annie Hank Braga, a teacher and co-coordinator of La Follette\u2019s college readiness program. \u201cI worry about the long-term impact it will have on their ability to make a living,\u201d she said. Racing against the clock The congressionally mandated overhaul of the FAFSA was long overdue. The changes were meant to make the form simpler and help more students qualify for federal student aid. While the form is now much shorter, the glitches students are facing this year have made the process for some families more challenging than usual. Plus, the form wasn\u2019t available until late last year, about three months later than it\u2019s typically released. There\u2019s a lot on the line, especially for students at La Follette High School where more than half come from low-income families and more than one-third speak something other than English as their first language. The concern is that some students may give up trying to complete the FAFSA and ultimately skip college altogether because they can\u2019t afford it without the help of federal loans and grants. Others may forgo enrolling at their preferred four-year school and instead decide to enroll in a community college with a more flexible enrollment timeline. Though hundreds of colleges\u00a0have pushed back their decision deadlines this year, not every college has pushed the date past May 1. \u201cI think it\u2019s inevitable that we will see students\u2019 decisions impacted because of this FAFSA rollout,\u201d Hank Braga said. High school ramps up support Once the issues with this year\u2019s FAFSA became apparent, La Follette High School ramped up support services for families of college-bound seniors. When the school held its first FAFSA workshop in January, most families walked away without successfully completing the form. At the time, there were several glitches that applicants were experiencing. \u201cThat\u2019s when our eyes really opened to the roller coaster we were jumping on,\u201d Hank Braga said. Given the way things went, the school counselors decided to offer a second FAFSA workshop in April \u2013 but many families still didn\u2019t have success. Plus, students have experienced hourslong wait times when they call the government\u2019s FAFSA helpline. Counselors have been sitting down one-on-one with students and parents to help guide them through the application process. The school has also partnered with outside organizations like the Fair Opportunity Project, a federally funded group that offers free, virtual FAFSA guidance to students. Some immigrant families face extra hurdles One problem is specifically impacting mixed-status families \u2013 those where a student is documented but one or both parents do not have Social Security numbers. Documented students are eligible for federal student aid, regardless of their parents\u2019 immigration status. But a technical glitch initially prevented students from mixed-status families from submitting the form altogether. Later, the Department of Education provided some workarounds so that a parent without a Social Security number could enter his or her information, but it wasn\u2019t seamless. By the time the department issued a fix to the problem, it was already April 30. Some La Follette students from mixed-status families have had success since then submitting the FAFSA, but others are still having problems. Now, they\u2019re running into issues other students faced months ago and had more time to resolve. Hank Braga is concerned that some of these families, who tend to already be wary of filling out government firms, will just give up. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to try to continue to reassure them that this is safe and this is worth it when it\u2019s not working well,\u201d she said. Tears of frustration and joy The Department of Education has increased its support for students applying for financial aid this year. It provided $50 million in grants to organizations that help students file the FAFSA in early May. The Biden administration has faced criticism for the botched rollout from both Republican and Democratic lawmakers, as well as from college financial aid groups. At the request of some Republican members of Congress, the Government Accountability Office has started an investigation into the new form\u2019s implementation. And some lawmakers are concerned about whether the problems with the FAFSA will be fixed in time for next year. Nationally, the percentage of high school seniors who have filed the FAFSA is down more than 17% compared with last year\u2019s class at this point, according to the National College Attainment Network. And there has a been a bigger decline at lower-income schools and schools with a higher percentage of minority students. Students at La Follette are behind the national trend, but they have had more success filing the FAFSA in recent weeks. Just a few days after the frustrating, three-hour session in Hlavacka\u2019s office with a student and his father, the family was able to successfully submit the FAFSA. \u201cSuddenly we were able to submit it. No problem. We can\u2019t figure out why,\u201d Hlavacka said. The initial problem had occurred when the student invited his father to fill out part of the form. Despite trying different ways to send the virtual invitation, the father\u2019s account wouldn\u2019t provide the ability to access the form. It\u2019s a glitch that several other La Follette students have experienced. \u201cWhen he was able to submit, I started crying. I was just so happy for him,\u201d Hlavacka said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/18/politics/fafsa-problems-low-income-families/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/20/2024", "section": "politics"}}

The newly agreed deadline gives the US four months to drawdown fewer than 1,000 troops who remain in the country, as well as their equipment, which includes MQ-9 Reaper drones and other assets. Niger\u2019s\u00a0military\u00a0government\u00a0announced in March that it had ended an\u00a0accord\u00a0with\u00a0the US that allowed\u00a0military\u00a0personnel and civilian staff from the Department of Defense to operate in\u00a0the country. The US delegation met with Niger\u2019s ruling military junta last week to try to reach an agreement that would allow for the secure withdrawal of US forces and for clearances for military flights. The flight clearances had been a sticking point in the sensitive negotiations needed to withdraw US forces.\u00a0Until now, US troops who have left Niger took commercial flights, including as recently as last week, according to US officials. The remaining troops on the ground are tasked with drawing down US personnel and equipment still in Niger. The US delegation was led by Chris Meier, the assistant secretary of defense for special operations and low-intensity conflict. The Nigerien delegation was led by Col.-Maj. Mamane Sani Kiaou, the chief of staff of the Nigerian army. \u201cBoth delegations confirmed the guarantees of protection and security to the American forces during their withdrawal. The delegations also established procedures to facilitate the entry and exit of U.S. personnel, including overflight and landing clearances for military flights,\u201d the joint statement said. A deepening divide between the US and the ruling military junta following the coup last July ultimately led to the withdrawal, as the Biden administration called for a path back to free and fair elections. Rebuffing the calls, the military junta instead began partnering more with Russia, whose forces are now operating at the same base from which US forces are withdrawing. The US and Niger said they would continue to work together on areas of \u201ccommon interest.\u201d \u201cThe United States and Niger are committed to ongoing diplomatic dialogue to define the future of their bilateral relations,\u201d the statement said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/19/politics/us-niger-troop-withdrawal-agreement/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/20/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_16_politics_alito-upside-down-american-flag-house", "text": "An\u00a0upside-down\u00a0American flag \u2013 a symbol\u00a0used by some supporters of former President\u00a0Donald Trump\u00a0who challenged the legitimacy of Joe Biden\u2019s 2020 victory\u00a0\u2013 hung outside the home of Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito after the election,\u00a0The New York Times reported Thursday. The revelation\u00a0is\u00a0almost certain to prompt calls for Alito, a member of the court\u2019s conservative wing, to recuse himself from several high-profile cases pending before the court this year involving the election and subsequent attack on the US Capitol, including the blockbuster question of whether Trump may claim immunity from federal election subversion charges. The Times published a photo of the inverted flag, which it said was seen at the justice\u2019s home in Alexandria,\u00a0Virginia, on\u00a0January\u00a017, 2021. A spokeswoman for the Supreme Court did not immediately respond to a request for comment from CNN, which has not independently verified the flag\u2019s use. \u201cI had no involvement whatsoever in the flying of the flag,\u201d Alito said in an emailed statement to\u00a0the\u00a0Times. \u201cIt was briefly placed by Mrs. Alito in response to a neighbor\u2019s use of objectionable and personally insulting language on yard signs.\u201d The upside-down flag became a symbol of the\u00a0\u201cStop the Steal\u201d\u00a0movement in the weeks and months following the election,\u00a0in which Trump\u2019s supporters falsely claimed that Biden\u2019s win was illegitimate due to\u00a0widespread fraud. The inverted flag was widely seen during the January 6, 2021,\u00a0attack on the US Capitol. The Times said it\u00a0was not clear how long the flag flew outside of Alito\u2019s home. The story will heap\u00a0further\u00a0scrutiny on the high court at a time when it is already facing considerable blowback. Justice Clarence Thomas has been the subject of significant criticism and calls for recusal in election-related cases after his wife,\u00a0conservative activist\u00a0Virginia \u201cGinni\u201d Thomas,\u00a0acknowledged she attended\u00a0Trump\u2019s rally\u00a0before the Capitol attack and supported White House efforts to discredit the election results. Thomas recently accused his critics of \u201cnastiness\u201d and \u201clies\u201d in remarks to a judicial conference in Alabama. Last fall, in response to a series of revelations about travel accepted by Thomas and Alito, the Supreme Court adopted a code of conduct for the first time. That code guides the justices\u00a0to\u00a0\u201crefrain from political activity.\u201d \u201cTwo scenarios are plausible and neither one of them is attractive: Either the gesture was trivial pettiness and ought to be beneath the dignity of the court or it is was intended as meaningful symbolism in which case it is a real problem,\u201d said James Sample, a Hofstra Law School professor who has studied judicial ethics. Combined with the earlier Thomas revelations, Sample said, \u201cThe scenarios amplify the need for Congress to impose meaningful ethics enforcement on a court that steadfastly refuses to police itself.\u201d This story has been updated with additional details.

{"id": "2024_05_14_politics_cohen-trump-prison-what-matters", "text": "After watching his former fixer Michael Cohen testify against him on Tuesday, former President Donald Trump is expected to attend a fundraiser in New York City co-hosted by Charles Kushner, his son-in-law\u2019s father, whom he pardoned in 2020. The crimes for which Kushner went to prison \u2013 tax evasion and campaign finance violations \u2013 had nothing to do with Trump, but they were tawdry enough to compete with a porn star hush money trial. Trying to intimidate his sister from testifying before a grand jury, the elder Kushner set up a sort of rogue sting operation in which he meant to videotape his sister\u2019s brother with a prostitute and then send the tape to his sister. At least those are the broad outlines of the tale as told by former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who was then the US attorney for the state who prosecuted the case. Christie was ultimately denied a Trump Cabinet position after Jared Kushner, Trump\u2019s son-in-law, opposed the idea. Now Christie, like Cohen, is a former Trump associate trying to take the former president down. RELATED: Read about Cohen\u2019s testimony in Trump\u2019s trial. Cohen is rare in the universe of Trump associates since he both turned on Trump and went to prison. Many of the other Trump aides and associates who faced jail eventually got pardons or clemency and still support the former president. Manafort still wants to help Paul Manafort is still in Trump\u2019s camp despite spending years in jail during a legal odyssey. Manafort ran Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign for a time, but then later, while Trump was president, Manafort \u2013 who made money as a foreign lobbyist \u2013 was convicted for federal tax evasion, among other things. He also pleaded guilty to conspiracy against the US. Trump continually expressed sympathy for Manafort. Manafort served two years until he was released to home confinement during the Covid-19 pandemic and was ultimately pardoned before Trump left office. He\u2019s back in the foreign lobbying business, although the optics of being involved in Trump\u2019s 2024 campaign were apparently too much. Manafort recently backed away from a supporting role helping plan the Republican National Convention after media scrutiny over his involvement. Bannon faces jail for post-pardon activity Steve Bannon, the former Trump White House chief strategist turned right-wing provocateur, obtained a Trump pardon before he could be tried for allegedly defrauding donors of contributions intended to help build a wall on the US border with Mexico. Pardoning Bannon was one of Trump\u2019s final acts in office. Bannon associates in the scheme who did not receive pardons have been convicted and sentenced to prison. Trump\u2019s pardon helped Bannon avoid prosecution in the border wall scheme, but Bannon may yet go to prison. He was the subject of a rare prosecution by the Department of Justice for refusing to comply with a congressional subpoena. Bannon ignored summons to testify before the now-disbanded House committee that investigated the January 6, 2021, insurrection. A federal appeals court recently rejected his attempt to further delay his four-month sentence, and prosecutors this week asked for Bannon\u2019s sentence to be imposed. Bannon hosts a widely downloaded podcast that is supportive of Trump. Another former top Trump aide, Peter Navarro, has already reported to prison after his conviction for contempt of Congress. Trump can\u2019t help Bannon or Navarro now, since he\u2019s not currently president, but he has already promised to use pardon power to help people convicted of crimes related to January 6, a riot committed by his supporters. Stone, Flynn avoided jail Trump already has a notable history of helping supporters when he is able. He commuted the sentence of his longtime friend Roger Stone, the political operative who was convicted by a jury of, among other things, obstructing the Russia investigation. Trump also issued a wide-ranging pardon to retired Gen. Michael Flynn, his first national security adviser who was charged with lying to investigators. Flynn had entered a guilty plea and then tried to rescind it, and the yearslong legal saga hung over Trump\u2019s presidency. Trump issued the Flynn pardon shortly after losing the 2020 presidential election. Flynn is now an avowed QAnon conspiracy theorist, but Trump has said he could bring him back in a second Trump administration. Trump\u2019s longtime CFO is back on Rikers Trump also can\u2019t help another lieutenant, Allen Weisselberg, who stayed loyal. Weisselberg already served one monthslong jail sentence on Rikers Island for a yearslong tax scheme. But then he was found to have lied during a deposition in the civil fraud trial in which Trump was found to have inflated his wealth to get favorable loans. For that perjury, Weisselberg pleaded guilty to different state charges and is now serving another five months at Rikers Island jail. Even if Trump is reelected, a president cannot use his pardon power to absolve state charges. Jonathan Karl of ABC News has reported that Trump was actively considering a pardon for Cohen around the time the FBI raided Cohen\u2019s house in 2018. Cohen ultimately spent weeks in solitary confinement for his tax and campaign finance crimes, something he has said was retribution by Trump \u2013 although a lawsuit Cohen filed making that allegation was dismissed.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/14/politics/cohen-trump-prison-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/20/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_14_politics_fact-check-biden-inflation-when-he-became-president", "text": "For the second time in less than a week, President Joe Biden falsely claimed Tuesday that the inflation rate was 9% when he began his presidency. Biden was criticized by many Republicans, including former president and current presidential rival Donald Trump, for telling CNN in an interview last Wednesday: \u201cNo president\u2019s had the run we\u2019ve had in terms of creating jobs and bringing down inflation.\u00a0It was 9% percent when I came to office, 9%.\u201d Biden repeated the claim about the inflation rate, albeit in slightly vaguer form, in a Tuesday interview with Yahoo Finance. This time, he said: \u201cI think inflation has gone slightly up. It was at 9% when I came in, and it\u2019s now down around 3%.\u201d Facts First: Biden\u2019s claim that the inflation rate was 9% when he became president is not close to true. The year-over-year inflation rate in January 2021, the month of his inauguration, was about 1.4%. The Biden-era inflation rate did peak at about 9.1% \u2013 but that peak occurred in June 2022, after Biden had been president for more than 16 months. The March 2024 inflation rate, the most recent available rate at the time Biden made these comments, was about 3.5%, up from about 3.2% the month prior. In other words, Biden\u2019s claims make it sound like inflation is much lower today than it was when he was inaugurated \u2013 but it is actually higher, though there has been a steep decline since the June 2022 peak. (That peak followed Russia\u2019s February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, which sparked global increases in energy and food prices.) And while Biden\u2019s claims make it sound like the end of the Trump presidency was plagued by high inflation, inflation was unusually low during Trump\u2019s last months in the White House amid the economic slowdown caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. Similar to a previous false claim Biden\u2019s false claims in the past week about overall inflation are similar to a false claim he made in October 2022 when talking about gas prices in particular. In both cases, he has wrongly depicted a figure from June 2022 as if it was the Biden-era starting point. A White House official said in a Tuesday email to CNN: \u201cThe President was making the point that the factors that caused inflation were in place when he took office.\u00a0The pandemic caused inflation around the world by disrupting our economy and breaking our supply chains.\u201d The April 2024 inflation rate will be revealed Wednesday with the release of new Consumer Price Index data. Separate Producer Price Index data that was released on Tuesday showed the highest wholesale inflation rate in a year. This story has been updated with comment from the White House.

The judge will reopen the sentencing portion of the case on May 28 at 9:30 a.m. In a motion filed Saturday, the court admitted to the mistake, stating that federal rules require the \u201ccourt, prior to imposing a sentence, to \u2018address the defendant personally in order to permit the defendant to speak or present any information to mitigate the sentence.\u2019 At the May 17, 2024 sentencing proceeding, no party brought to the Court\u2019s attention that it had not done so. Nonetheless,\u00a0it was the Court\u2019s responsibility to personally ask Mr. DePape if he wanted to speak. As the Court did not do so, it committed clear error.\u201d The judge\u00a0sentenced DePape on Friday to 30 years for assault and 20 years for attempted kidnapping, which would run concurrently, for the attack at the Pelosis\u2019 San Francisco home. That same day, federal prosecutors filed a motion to reopen the sentencing for \u201cthe limited purpose of addressing the defendant to permit him to\u00a0allocute, if he so chooses, prior to sentencing.\u201d DePape was not required to speak during the hearing, the motion states, but the record shows he didn\u2019t get the opportunity to do so. DePape\u2019s attorneys told prosecutors they opposed the motion. They separately filed a notice of appeal regarding the \u201cjudgment\u00a0and sentence entered in this matter.\u201d In November,\u00a0DePape\u00a0was convicted in a federal court in San Francisco on one count of assault on the immediate family member of a federal official and a second count of attempted kidnapping of a federal official. At the time, DePape\u2019s attorneys conceded that their client attacked the then-83-year-old Paul Pelosi, but argued that his motivation for the assault did not match the charges against him. Testifying in his own defense, DePape recalled that he was looking for Nancy Pelosi and that her husband was not on his list of targets. He was \u201csurprised and confused,\u201d he testified, when he found out the congresswoman was not home. \u201cI\u2019m telling him, \u2018I have other targets, but if you stop me, I\u2019ll go through you,\u2019\u201d DePape said, recounting a conversation with Paul Pelosi, adding that he then hit Pelosi \u201cin the head,\u201d because his plan was \u201cbasically ruined.\u201d Pelosi, who underwent surgery to repair a skull fracture and injuries to his hand and arm, told jurors that his recovery has been difficult. \u201cI\u2019ve made the best effort I possibly can to not revisit this,\u201d he said at the time. A state case against\u00a0DePape\u00a0that includes charges of attempted murder, burglary and assault is expected to go to trial this summer.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/18/politics/paul-pelosi-attacker-david-depape-sentencing-reopen/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/20/2024", "section": "politics"}}

White House officials have held several meetings with prominent Arab Americans\u00a0across the country since Hamas\u2019 October 7 attacks, but some of the invited participants have declined to attend, often making their rejection known in open letters and press interviews. Many members of the community agree Biden would have to made significant policy changes to win\u00a0back this key part of his political coalition \u2014 including Arab and Muslim Americans and progressive voters \u2014 ahead of the November elections while his administration largely refuses to use its leverage over Israel to halt the fighting in Gaza. The groups went in Friday with specific demands for the administration, including calling for an immediate ceasefire, the return of all hostages and prisoners held without charges, the complete withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza, unimpeded humanitarian assistance to reach the Palestinian population, the end to US arms shipments to Israel, and the rebuilding of devastated Palestinian communities. Yet the attendees\u00a0did not leave the meeting, which lasted more than 90 minutes, with any commitments to take action on those fronts. \u201cI believe the meeting was a failure; we were not able to agree on any change in US policy towards the situation in Gaza,\u201d said one attendee. John Dabeet, the president of the US Palestinian Council,\u00a0said he feels \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d after the meeting.\u00a0But he said it was too hard to predict which actions the administration might take. \u201cWe are not naive. We did not go there thinking we can turn the ship completely in the opposite way, but any change we can create will be seen as a positive thing to help the people in Gaza to lower their suffering,\u201d Dabeet said. More than 35,000 people have been killed in Gaza since October 7, according to the region\u2019s health ministry. The Arab and Palestinian American leaders requested the meeting, which included the heads of five national organizations:\u00a0the\u00a0American\u00a0Federation of Ramallah Palestine, the American Arab Chamber of Commerce, Arab America, the Arab American Institute, and the US Palestinian Council. The State Department did not provide a readout of the meeting or respond to an inquiry about the lack of commitments made during the gathering. The Biden administration this month paused a shipment of bombs to Israel amid concerns over their potential use in an incursion into Rafah, where more than a million civilians are sheltering. But the meeting attendees did not view that step as significant enough to amount to a powerful policy change that could force an end to the conflict. They went into the meeting already frustrated by the\u00a0\u201ccallous neglect\u201d they say the Arab American community has received from the Biden administration. But they also approached the meeting with the belief that engagement is necessary to drive policy change. \u201cI am a firm believer that engagement is important. Being around the table is important because at least our voice will be heard this way,\u201d Dabeet said. But for the attendees with whom CNN spoke, returning to the table with Biden administration officials would come only after significant policy changes. \u201cI would not attend another meeting until there is action,\u201d Hammoud said. \u201cAt this point, there is nothing left to be said. I think the administration knows fully what needs to happen.\u201d Bilal is not alone in feeling the Biden administration knows what it must do to win over \u2014 or win back \u2014 the Palestinian and Arab American support domestically. \u201cI think the administration has ample chances to make real change \u2026 and I have not seen change, real change in policy. So that is why I think they\u2019re checking the boxes at this moment,\u201d said\u00a0Ghada Elnajjar, a Palestinian American who has lost more than 80 members of her extended family to the Israel-Hamas war, which she calls \u201cIsrael\u2019s ongoing genocide.\u201d Elnajjar\u00a0added that perhaps the messages will eventually be heard as November\u2019s election approaches. \u201cThey are risking the elections,\u201d she said. Elnajjar helped organize for the Biden campaign in 2020 as part of the Arab Americans for Biden. The group has now removed Biden\u2019s name, becoming Arab Americans Forward. Elnajjar said she\u2019s not sure what she will do in November when it comes to her presidential ballot. Attendees at the meeting with Blinken made the point that it is not just Arab Americans who Biden is losing, but also allies from other ethnic backgrounds who are standing in solidarity with Arab, Palestinian and Muslim Americans. \u201cThis was a last-ditch effort with this administration so they can\u2019t say they didn\u2019t hear from us or our demands,\u201d a meeting attendee said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/18/politics/antony-blinken-arab-palestinian-americans-gaza/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/20/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_17_politics_crockett-greene-contentious-committee-meeting", "text": "Democratic Rep. Jasmine Crockett criticized\u00a0Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, calling her \u201cracist,\u201d following a tense House Oversight markup Thursday evening that quickly devolved into personal attacks. As the panel met to advance contempt proceedings against Attorney General Merrick Garland over his refusal to turn over audio recordings of President Joe Biden\u2019s interview with\u00a0special counsel Robert Hur, Greene, a Georgia Republican, sparked outrage when she commented on\u00a0Crockett\u2019s appearance. \u201cI think your fake eyelashes are messing up what you\u2019re reading,\u201d Greene said. Speaking to reporters on Friday about the incident, Crockett said, \u201cThat\u2019s all it is, it is racism. And she decided that she was going to be that person out loud and out front on yesterday. The difference is I just wasn\u2019t going to take it laying down.\u201d \u201cShe is racist. I mean, I don\u2019t have any questions about that,\u201d she added. When asked by CNN\u2019s Abby Phillip Friday night why she believes Greene\u2019s comments were racist, Crockett said the Georgia Republican \u201cwas just basically repeating the nonsense that MAGA world is constantly putting out there.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve received so many amazing compliments from MAGA America throughout my time in Congress,\u201d Crockett said, sarcastically, on \u201cNewsNight.\u201d \u201cA lot of times when I would go viral, instead of them trying to address the things that I laid out in a very factual way, what they would try to do is say, \u2018Oh, look at her hair,\u2019 or \u2018Look at her nails,\u2019 or \u2018Look at her lashes,\u2019 and they would all then associate anything I do as a form of beautification with being quote-unquote \u2018ghetto.\u2019\u201d \u201cI am not the only woman in Congress that wears lashes, and there are women on her side of the aisle that wear lashes as well, as well as hair extensions. But she\u2019s never felt like that was a dig that she needed to take at anyone except for me, a Black woman who sits on the committee,\u201d she added. Asked for comment by CNN earlier Friday, Greene\u2019s office said, \u201cthe only member that brought up any reference to color was congresswoman Crockett.\u201d On\u00a0social media\u00a0Friday, Greene doubled down on her comments and slammed criticism from within her party about her behavior. \u201cAOC isn\u2019t intelligent. Jasmine Crockett has fake eyelashes. These aren\u2019t attacks on personalities. These are just facts,\u201d she\u00a0wrote on X. The rules of the House dictate members can\u2019t \u201cengage in personalities,\u201d meaning they are not allowed to make offensive comments about or toward another member. If it occurs, the member who was insulted can ask for the words to be stricken from the record and, if that happens, the offending member is not allowed to speak for the remainder of the proceeding. During the markup, there was a failed vote to strike Greene\u2019s comments from the record and she was allowed to continue her remarks. At the markup, Greene started by asking Democrats on the committee if any of them employ the\u00a0daughter of\u00a0Judge Juan Merchan, who is overseeing the criminal trial in New York of former President Donald Trump. As Republicans have sought to\u00a0curry favor with Trump, they have gone after Merchan\u2019s daughter, who has ties to Democrats, as they seek to undermine the case. Crockett, a Democrat from Texas, asked Greene, \u201cDo you know what we\u2019re here for?\u201d Greene shot back: \u201cI don\u2019t think you know what you\u2019re here for \u2026 I think your fake eyelashes are messing up what you\u2019re reading.\u201d Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez immediately jumped in to get Greene\u2019s words taken down. \u201cThat is absolutely unacceptable. How dare you attack the physical appearance of another person,\u201d the New York Democrat said. After a series of votes in response to Greene\u2019s explosive rhetoric,\u00a0Crockett made a dig that appeared to be directed at the Republican. \u201cI\u2019m just curious. Just to better understand your ruling. If someone on this committee then starts talking about somebody\u2019s bleach blonde bad built butch body, that would not be engaging in personalities, correct,\u201d\u00a0Crockett\u00a0said. Crockett said on Friday that Greene is unserious and does not respect the process. \u201cShe\u2019s lacking any ability to actually engage in actual discourse, she doesn\u2019t know her job. She doesn\u2019t know the issues that we\u2019re dealing with when we\u2019re in committee. So instead, she does what most of MAGA does which they seek to insult and personal attacks. She needs to get a staff that can get her up to speed so that she can actually talk about something of substance and actually represent her district,\u201d Crockett said. Crockett also said she is a \u201cgrown woman\u201d and wasn\u2019t going to take it \u201claying down.\u201d \u201cOne thing I\u2019m not going to do is have somebody disrespect me as a duly elected official myself, and then I\u2019m just going to say, well, that\u2019s okay. And rub it off. No, we\u2019re not going to do that.\u201d She added: \u201cSo if if they can\u2019t follow the rules, I will have to fight for myself.\u201d House Speaker Mike Johnson, who has a contentious relationship with Greene, said Friday that \u201cit\u2019s regrettable\u201d that partisanship in the House devolved into ad hominem attacks and chaos during the meeting. \u201cI think decorum is an important thing for us to maintain around here,\u201d Johnson said, adding, \u201ceven when we disagree \u2014\u00a0even vehemently \u2014 we\u2019ve got to treat one another with dignity and respect.\u201d In response, Greene took to social media to slam Johnson, whom she tried to oust from the speakership earlier this month. \u201cHow ridiculous is it that the Speaker runs his mouth about decorum when our opposition refuses to follow it at all,\u201d\u00a0she wrote on X Friday evening. Republican and Democratic members of the House Oversight Committee also expressed shock and disgust at the \u201cunacceptable\u201d conduct during the committee meeting. \u201cIt\u2019s not appropriate. None of it\u2019s appropriate,\u201d said GOP Rep. Tim Burchett, who was seated next to Greene during the hearing. \u201cI mean, \u2018butch body\u2019 and \u2018bleach blonde\u2019 hair, now that \u2013 there\u2019s no place for that up here. And it\u2019s just, it\u2019s disgusting. And I got a little girl, I don\u2019t want to hear her insulting somebody\u2019s appearance like that. And yeah, it was pitiful,\u201d he added. The top Democrat on the committee, Rep. Jamie Raskin, said that House Republicans\u2019 behavior \u201cbrought disgrace to the whole institution,\u201d criticizing Greene\u2019s conduct in the hearing. \u201cWhen the chairman allowed the distinguished gentlelady from Georgia to attack another members\u2019 eyelashes or her personal appearance, the whole meeting descended at that point,\u201d he said.

{"id": "2024_05_17_politics_voting-restrictions-elections-brennan-report", "text": "Americans in more than half of the states will face voting restrictions this year that weren\u2019t in place four years ago during the last presidential election, a new analysis finds. Twenty-eight states \u2013 ranging from political battlegrounds such as North Carolina to Republican strongholds such as Alabama and\u00a0Idaho\u00a0\u2013 have enacted laws since 2020 that make it harder to cast a ballot, according to a report released Friday by the liberal-leaning Brennan Center for Justice at New York University\u2019s law school. \u201cThe most aggressive years for restrictive voting legislation in the last decade have come after the 2020 election,\u201d said Sara Carter, a Brennan Center attorney who analyzed legislation across the country for the new report. \u201cThese new laws are making voting harder, really, at every stage of the process \u2013 from registration to mail voting to strict voter ID.\u201d One class of new laws seeks to curtail voting by mail \u2013 a method that former President Donald Trump and his allies baselessly cast as rife with fraud in the aftermath of his 2020 White House loss \u2013 even as top Republican officials now seek to\u00a0encourage their supporters\u00a0to vote by mail this year. Alabama and Idaho, for instance, have enacted laws this year that impose criminal penalties in some cases for assisting with absentee voting, a practice critics have cast as inappropriate \u201cballot harvesting\u201d by political operatives. Alabama\u2019s law \u2013 signed by Republican Gov. Kay Ivey in March \u2013 makes it a crime in most cases to return an absentee ballot application on behalf of another voter. And it\u2019s now a felony\u00a0for a person to receive payment for distributing or collecting absentee ballot applications. \u201cHere in Alabama, we are committed to ensuring our elections are free and fair,\u201d Ivey said in a\u00a0statement\u00a0when she signed the bill. \u201cUnder my watch, there will be no funny business in Alabama elections.\u201d Opponents of the new law in Alabama, however, have criticized it as a way of curbing the activity of outside groups who assist the elderly and others who cannot vote in person. A coalition of voting and civil rights groups\u00a0has sued\u00a0to block the law. Meanwhile, in North Carolina, a potential presidential battleground this fall, a\u00a0state law\u00a0mandates that mail-in ballots must be received by 7:30 p.m. on Election Day to be counted. Lawmakers last year eliminated a three-day grace period for those ballots to arrive at local election offices. In the 2022 midterms, before the North Carolina law was in place, more than 8,600 absentee ballots that arrived within the grace period were accepted, state records show. Another trend noted in the report: a wave of bills that seek to regulate deepfakes and material generated by artificial intelligence in elections. As of May 3, legislation had been introduced in at least 39 states to safeguard against artificial intelligence content, with laws enacted in at least nine that require notices that the message was manipulated, according to the Brennan Center. The analysis also found that certain states have expanded access to the ballot. At least 11 states have enacted laws this year that the Brennan Center officials say make it easier to vote.\u00a0Kentucky, for instance, now allows mail ballots to be sent to addresses other than the ones on file at the election offices in some circumstances, making it easier for college students away at school, for example, to cast absentee ballots. And\u00a0Nebraska has restored\u00a0voting rights for ex-felons who have completed the terms of their sentence \u2013 including probation \u2013 rather than waiting two years, as previously required. \u201cWe are really seeing a stark divide between states that are trying to make it harder to vote and those that are making it easier,\u201d Carter said. Given the changed election law landscape, she added, it\u2019s crucial that people who plan to cast ballots this fall start to familiarize themselves with their state\u2019s voting rules.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/17/politics/voting-restrictions-elections-brennan-report/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/20/2024", "section": "politics"}}

While in most cases Trump has not asked anyone to attend his trial, sources say word of Trump\u2019s frustration quickly spread to Capitol Hill, prompting his staunchest defenders to spring into action to show their support for Trump while he\u2019s in the hot seat. Some of them began reaching out to Trump\u2019s camp, offering to come and defend the former president in New York and asking how they could secure a spot in court. GOP Sen. Rick Scott of Florida became the first lawmaker to make the trek up north last week, followed several days later by House Speaker Mike Johnson \u2013 who\u2019s been under fire from his right flank \u2013 and a quartet of Republicans sporting nearly identical navy suits with red ties, which, whether accidental or not, took the coordination to the next level. Their appearances inspired what sources say has been a mostly organic movement among Republicans. Now, the floodgates have opened, with Trump\u2019s team fielding a deluge of interest from lawmakers and orchestrating campaign stops with Trump supporters within the city before and after trial appearances as the proceedings drag on. \u201cThere\u2019s been a waterfall [of people] who want to come and show support for him, and we expect more,\u201d one Trump adviser told CNN. It\u2019s just the latest sign that the pilgrimage to Trump\u2019s criminal trial in New York has become a new litmus test for Trump loyalty inside the GOP ahead of November. For participants, the benefits are twofold: Not only are they able to score valuable brownie points with their party\u2019s presumptive presidential nominee, but it\u2019s also an opportunity to step into the spotlight, with several members \u2013 including Johnson and GOP Rep. Lauren Boebert of Colorado \u2013 even fundraising off their appearances. \u201cWhat the Republicans are doing is showing support for a man that is being persecuted unfairly,\u201d Rep. Ralph Norman of South Carolina, one of the GOP members who attended the trial this week, told CNN. \u201cThis can happen to any American. And it shouldn\u2019t. And President Trump is a fighter and he\u2019s standing firm and we want to back him.\u201d Attending court alongside Trump has also become somewhat of an audition for a role in a potential future Trump administration. North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum and Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance, both currently on the shortlist for vice president, have been among those in attendance this week. \u201cShowing up to support somebody in a criminal trial is not naturally a part of the rhythm of a congressional office,\u201d said one GOP lawmaker. \u201cBut when people saw Rick Scott do it, and then J.D. and Vivek [Ramaswamy], they were trying to do it too. It happened organically.\u201d \u2018We\u2019ve got your back\u2019 The latest group to make the voyage to New York: members of the far-right House Freedom Caucus, who represent some of Trump\u2019s closest allies on Capitol Hill. The GOP lawmakers informed the Trump team that they would be bringing a large group on Thursday, even though the House was in session, and requested a meeting with the former president before court processions started that day, according to a source familiar with the plans. The meeting lasted around 30 minutes in Trump Tower, and Trump\u2019s son Eric was also present, sources said. The members gave the former president a \u201cpep talk\u201d ahead of the trial and discussed the future of government funding \u2013 and specifically, his preference for the length of a short-term government funding patch that is expected after September 30 \u2013 if Trump were to win back the White House in November, the source added. Then, the GOP members joined Trump in his motorcade \u2013 including the Republican candidate challenging GOP Rep. Bob Good, who has tried to cozy up to Trump after initially endorsing Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis \u2013 to give the former president a splashy appearance as he arrived for court that day, flanked by a cavalry of his supporters. The lawmakers also made sure to stop by the cameras outside the courthouse to attack the prosecutors and witnesses and undermine the case, filling a void that Trump, who is under a gag order, can\u2019t. \u201cMr. President, we\u2019ve got your back,\u201d GOP Rep. Andy Ogles said outside the courthouse. Even though the 11 Republican House members rode in Trump\u2019s motorcade, the Trump campaign did not foot the bill for their travel to New York, according to a Trump campaign official. In some cases, the individual campaign committees of members of Congress paid, according to someone involved with the travel earlier this week. It is unclear what role the US Capitol Police had in securing members to and from New York, as a USCP spokesperson would not comment when asked if they provided additional security services. \u201cHe did not ask anybody,\u201d Norman said of Trump. \u201cEverybody volunteered to go. We paid our own way. He didn\u2019t pay anything. He didn\u2019t tell us what to say. A lot of us just feel like enough is enough.\u201d Legislating takes a back seat to Trump loyalty test But to attend the trial, the lawmakers left their day jobs behind. There were so many GOP lawmakers in New York to support Trump that, for at least a few hours on Thursday, there were more House Democrats present on Capitol Hill than Republicans. It wasn\u2019t an insignificant day in the House either. The House Judiciary and Oversight committees were set to consider reports to hold Attorney General Merrick Garland in contempt of Congress for refusing to turn over the audio tapes of President Joe BIden\u2019s interviews with special counsel Robert Hur \u2013 a top priority on the right. GOP Reps. Matt Gaetz and Andy Biggs both missed the Judiciary committee markup, while the House Oversight panel had to push their start time back to 8pm, just to give some of their members enough time to get back from New York. On top of that, the House was scheduled to vote\u00a0on a GOP-led bill to compel the delivery of defensive weapons to Israel as Republicans ramp up pressure on Biden over his handling of the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. Gaetz along with Boebert and GOP Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, who were all in New York on Thursday, missed the vote. As soon as the Oversight markup, dubbed by some Democrats as\u00a0\u201cOversight after dark\u201d got underway on Thursday night, it started to go off the rails. GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene sparked outrage when she went after Democratic Rep. Jasmine Crockett\u2019s appearance and Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s intelligence, with the committee meeting devolving into a heated\u00a0sparring match. Some Republican lawmakers speculated that perhaps the reason for Greene\u2019s mood was that she has been frustrated with her colleagues, including the speaker, who have been quick to publicly support the president during his trial, but haven\u2019t always joined her in supporting some of the Trump-favored policies that she has pushed. \u201cGreene is not impressed with the johnny and suzy come latelys to Trump\u2019s defense,\u201d according to a source who has heard her express her opinion. Greene \u2013 the first GOP lawmaker to appear with Trump in New York when he was indicted in March 2023 \u2013 appeared particularly annoyed with Boebert, who had attended Trump\u2019s trial that morning and then voted with Democrats during the markup to try and prevent Greene from speaking further. \u201cLauren Boebert has been in the shadows of Marjorie Taylor Greene for almost four years and is grasping at any bitter relevance that she can latch onto,\u201d the source added. Boebert, who apologized to the American people after Greene\u2019s outburst, defended both her vote to try and silence Greene and her decision to travel to Trump\u2019s trial in New York, which ultimately did not impact the committee\u2019s ability to advance the contempt resolution. \u201cIt was embarrassing what was going on,\u201d Boebert said of the markup. \u201cI felt shame that that was happening while we are taking care of serious business, and it\u2019s the first time in how long that we\u2019ve been taking care of serious business, and we\u2019re doing what the American people have been demanding and having accountability for this weaponized federal government.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/17/politics/trump-hill-allies-trial-litmus-test/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/20/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_17_politics_biden-morehouse-commencement-speech", "text": "After weeks of consultation with prominent Black public figures, President Joe Biden is preparing to deliver a commencement speech at Morehouse College that highlights triumph over adversity and the lasting impact of peaceful protest, according to people involved in the preparations. The content of the speech has been the subject of careful consideration, with an\u00a0event intended to celebrate the next generation of young Black leaders becoming mired in controversy over some campus discontent with the president\u2019s handling of the conflict in Gaza. Dr. Tony Allen, president of Delaware State University and a longtime friend of Biden\u2019s, counseled the president on praising the bravery of young people speaking out against injustice. \u201cThe voices of students have grown even more clear, particularly in the last few years,\u201d Allen told CNN in an interview, pointing to the protests following George Floyd\u2019s murder and the Black Lives Matter movement. \u201cAs opposed to striking a delicate balance, I think he will hit that head on.\u201d But the discussion behind the scenes has been delicate \u2013 with White House officials traveling to Morehouse\u2019s Atlanta campus to hold forth with students and faculty and attempt to quell their concerns. During one meeting in early May, roughly half of the two-hour conversation focused on the conflict in Gaza, one source said, with the rest touching on other issues of concern for students. Among those issues,\u00a0according to people familiar with the discussions, was student worry that their achievements would be overshadowed by a stump speech. They have expressed frustration that the format of the event and the level of security required for such a high-profile visit resulted in limited tickets for family members, many of whom would be required to watch from an overflow room. Stephen Benjamin, the president\u2019s director of public engagement who conducted the meeting, says Biden is intent on keeping the focus on the graduates. \u201cHe is the leader of the free world. On this day, he\u2019s a commencement speaker for these young men, and that\u2019s what he plans to do \u2013 be a commencement speaker,\u201d Benjamin told CNN in an interview. The campaign element is impossible to ignore. Biden will deliver the speech against a politically charged backdrop in front of\u00a0a group whose political backing Biden needs in November amid signs of eroding support from young and Black voters in his rematch against former President Donald Trump. \u201cIf folk think that there\u2019s no substantive difference between the two choices, that their lives haven\u2019t been fundamentally transformed by Biden\u2019s policies, they didn\u2019t, they won\u2019t turn out,\u201d Dr. Eddie Glaude Jr., chair of Princeton University\u2019s Department of African American Studies, told The Bulwark Podcast. \u201cAnd if we don\u2019t turn out in high numbers, then [Biden\u2019s] in trouble.\u201d Glaude, who sits on the Morehouse Board of Trustees and has advised Biden on issues of historical significance in the past, is among the leaders the White House consulted to craft the speech, according to two sources. The president\u2019s top aides also sought input from\u00a0Morehouse alumni like\u00a0former Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson; Birmingham, Alabama, Mayor Randall Woodfin; and Montgomery, Alabama, Mayor Steven Reed. Cedric Richmond, a Morehouse alum who has worked for Biden in various roles, played an integral role in facilitating those conversations and securing the president\u2019s appearance at the college. \u201cAfrican American male leaders that will be leaders in the nation, leaders in their community and that history of work and excellence that the school produces, deserves that recognition,\u201d Richmond told CNN in an interview.\u00a0Richmond said he expects the president to highlight the obligation to give back and the importance of community. In the days leading up to the speech, the Biden administration outlined new data intended to highlight the scale of the White House\u2019s investments in Black institutions. That data included $16 billion in funding for historically Black colleges and universities and roughly $12 billion in funding for Black-owned small businesses. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t just talk the talk, he walks the walk,\u201d Benjamin said Thursday of Biden\u2019s investment and policy priorities. The numbers have already proven to be a powerful talking point, with Biden pointing to those statistics in a speech at the National Museum of African American History and Culture, an event taking place amid a flurry of events to reach Black voters. At Morehouse, Biden\u2019s broader economic message touting the expansion of the middle class is likely to hit home, according to Allen. HBCUs \u201ccontinue to be the number one engine for promoting African Americans into the middle class,\u201d Allen told CNN. \u201cAs drivers of this, it all fits together.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/17/politics/biden-morehouse-commencement-speech/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/20/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_08_politics_young-michigan-voters-biden-israel-gaza", "text": "The nervous Democrat in Jade Gray will get to the worrying part soon enough. But graduating college surrounded by demonstrations and protest was a full circle moment worth cherishing. \u201cIt was in my application letter that this was a campus with a history of protests, a rich history of social justice movements,\u201d Gray said in an interview at the University of Michigan Student Union. \u201cIt was in my application letter,\u201d she repeated with a smile. \u201cI have to be proud that\u2019s the response on campus now. Although the situation is dire, and I\u2019m not remotely happy with what is going on in the world, I am impressed with how people are responding to it. And I think we should feel empowered and inspired by that.\u201d Now to the worrying part. Gray spoke to us alongside fellow new graduate Anushka Jalisatgi. They were co-presidents of the campus College Democrats and they know the pro-Gaza encampment that sprung up on campus for the final weeks of school is a sign of deep political problems for President Joe Biden in a state he likely cannot afford to lose. \u201cAll roads to the White House go through Michigan,\u201d Gray said. \u201cMichigan is up for grabs, and I did not think I would be saying this right now. And I wish I wasn\u2019t saying this right now. But I am genuinely concerned about which way Michigan will go.\u201d Jalisatgi will be back on campus to start law school in September and hopes there is no encampment. \u201cJoe Biden has the ability to make sure that there isn\u2019t,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that starts with calling for a cease fire, for listening to his student voters across the country.\u201d Jalisatgi and Gray are part of a 2024 CNN project designed to experience the presidential campaign through the eyes and experiences of voters who live in battleground states and are members of voting blocs most likely to determine the outcome. Younger voters were critical to Biden returning Michigan to the blue column in 2020; exit polling showed Biden winning 61% of voters aged 18-29, to just 37% for Donald Trump.\u00a0Younger voters also helped Michigan Democrats score big 2022 midterm victories. But our conversations exposed profound troubles with this group for Biden in 2024, even more so than we found in our initial visits\u00a0with these voters back in mid-November. That was just weeks after the Hamas terrorist attack on Israel; the campus activism critical of the Israeli response and Biden\u2019s handling of the crisis was just beginning. Now, that campus activism is a defining chapter for many young voters. Dampened enthusiasm for voting for Biden Summer Matkin, for example, was getting her freshman footing when we first visited her at Wayne State last November. She was home in suburban Detroit when we circled back last week. \u201cIt was stressful,\u201d she said of adjusting to her first year at college. Last fall, she raised giant concerns about the president\u2019s age but did not hesitate when asked who she would pick if the November ballot was a Biden-Trump rematch. \u201cI\u2019d go Biden,\u201d she said in that November interview at Wayne State\u2019s computer gaming lounge. This will be Matkin\u2019s first presidential vote, and she was visibly excited talking about that last fall. Still excited? \u201cQuestionable.\u201d That\u2019s because Matkin has more questions about Biden. \u201cHis age will always play a factor in how I think about him,\u201d she said. \u201cNo matter how many Taylor Swift references you make, you will never understand us. But my thing is, I think he has handled everything with Israel and Palestine terribly.\u201d Matkin still leans Biden \u2014 because she cannot stomach the return of Trump to the White House. But she is part of a spirited conversation with friends. \u201cI\u2019ve considered going third party as well,\u201d Matkin said. \u201cA lot of our generation is also considering going third party. But I kind of fear it is going to split up the votes and end up having it fall back on Trump, which I wouldn\u2019t want to happen.\u201d A tepid endorsement There was some progress for Biden in our group. Wayne State student Maya Siegmann was likely Biden when we spoke in November. Certain Biden, she says now. Though her endorsement was hardly overwhelming. \u201cHis age definitely is still a barrier,\u201d Siegmann said in an interview at her suburban Detroit home. \u201cI do still think there should be an age cap on politics in general. \u2026 I would vote Biden. I think that he\u2019s the less bad option for president.\u201d She\u00a0is thrilled with her grades. But Siegmann, who is Jewish, is more thrilled this school year is over \u2014 providing a glimpse into the fear of many Jewish students from the nationwide campus unrest. \u201cIt was terrifying. It was terrifying,\u201d she said of the past semester. \u201cThe escalation on other campuses has made me fear for my campus.\u201d Wayne State was relatively calm. There were modest protests and on a couple of occasions the campus Hillel organization was locked down as a precaution when pro-Palestinian students demonstrated at the student union building where the campus Jewish organization has its offices. Siegmann told us in November she was excited to join a breakdancing club. This visit, she told us she quit because it held a fundraiser for Palestinians and she feared the money would end up going to Hamas. Siegmann said when she asked a club leader questions about the event, he blocked her phone number. It happened again, Siegmman said, when a Jewish student and former Hillel member became highly critical of Israel\u2019s response to the October 7 Hamas attacks. \u201cShe asked for unbiased proof that Hamas is trying to eradicate the Jewish people,\u201d Siegmann said. \u201cI sent her the Hamas charter. And then she blocked me.\u201d Siegmann\u2019s father is Israeli and she is spending the summer in Israel. But her unflinching support of the Jewish state is separate from her views of the Israeli government, especially Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. \u201cI personally don\u2019t agree with how he is operating,\u201d she told us. \u201cI think he is trying to prolong the war. \u2026 I think there should be a new prime minister of Israel.\u201d Eyeing third-party options Like Siegmann, Wayne State law student Ibrahim Ghazal speaks with nuance often missing when politicians discuss the conflict and the campus protests. Ghazal is of Palestinian descent and has distant relatives in Gaza. But he is no fan of Hamas and acknowledges Israel\u2019s right to respond to terrorism. \u201cWe don\u2019t want human rights violations,\u201d Ghazal told us during a break in his finals work. \u201cIf you are going to conduct war, conduct it within the rule of law, international law. That\u2019s all people are asking for. Nothing more.\u201d Our November visit was just five weeks after the October 7 Hamas attacks, and already it was clear that Biden\u2019s standing in Michigan\u2019s Arab and Muslim communities was taking a pounding. Ghazal said the president\u2019s predicament is decidedly worse now. \u201cWhat is he going to do to earn our vote?\u201d Ghazal asked. \u201cSending unconditional aid to Israel with a disregard for any of the human rights violations that have been recorded by international agencies continuously, not just denying but preventing independent probes and investigations into possible war crimes that have been committed and reported. \u201cThat\u2019s an issue. If President Biden valued Palestinian lives, valued lives in Gaza, he would definitely allow for independent probes and investigations. If Biden wants to get certain votes, he needs to change course.\u201d Ghazal said he has been too busy with school to find time but plans to research third-party presidential options over the summer. Many friends are likewise looking third party, he said. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s definitely a conversation,\u201d Ghazal said. \u201cNobody wants to vote for Biden.\u201d That sentiment was backed up in Michigan\u2019s Democratic presidential primary. Biden lost to the \u201cuncommitted\u201d option on the ballot in the three Michigan communities with the highest number of voters of Arab descent: Dearborn, Dearborn Heights and Hamtramck. But Ghazal is no fan of Trump and said he understands sitting out or voting third party could help the presumptive GOP nominee in Michigan. But he is prepared to do so if he doesn\u2019t see a major shift from Biden. \u201cThe only reason I haven\u2019t closed the door is because I think he still has an ability to change course,\u201d Ghazal said. Comparing Biden to his GOP opponent New University of Michigan graduates Jalisatgi and Gray promise to be active Biden supporters in the fall even though their College Democrats stint is over and even though they, too, have some reservations about him. Jalisatgi is going home to Missouri for the summer. Gray is already working for a Michigan progressive group. Both hope a break from campus protests and demonstrations will give younger voters time and space to see a bigger picture. \u201cTo me, there isn\u2019t another option,\u201d Gray said. \u201cBecause I\u2019m certainly not voting for the guy who is in court right now and who incited an insurrection and put three extremists on the Supreme Court who took away [abortion] rights for the first time in history. Who\u2019s demonized the LGBTQ community of which I am a part. \u2026 I know there is frustration with Biden, and some of his decisions have been inexcusable, but the reality is we need to vote for him.\u201d At the moment, though, emotions are raw. \u201cHundreds of thousands of people in Gaza and across Palestine have been displaced. Have been starved, have been killed,\u201d Jalisatgi said. \u201cSo, I think it really does come down to people\u2019s own judgments on the motivation of the president.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/08/politics/young-michigan-voters-biden-israel-gaza/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/20/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_19_politics_democratic-senators-bob-menendez", "text": "Democratic senators are signaling an openness to expelling Sen. Bob Menendez if he\u2019s convicted in his corruption trial, as House and Senate leaders tread carefully around their indicted colleagues. As Menendez sits in a New York courtroom fighting charges he abused his office and enriched himself to aid the governments of Egypt and Qatar, Rep. Henry Cuellar of Texas has been indicted on federal bribery charges. Both Democrats have pleaded not guilty. While Menendez could face a verdict in the next few weeks, Cuellar\u2019s case will take months to process \u2014 putting House Democratic leaders in a jam as they weigh how to handle a member who is running for reelection in a seat that could flip to the GOP. One reason they\u2019re in a complicated position: Many were quick to call for the expulsion of then-Rep. George Santos before his case on fraud and money laundering charges went to trial. The New York Republican ultimately became the sixth House member ever to be expelled amid his litany of criminal charges and a damning House ethics report. Santos has also pleaded not guilty. Democratic leaders in the House have stopped short of calling on Cuellar to resign, putting those who led the push to oust Santos on the defensive. Rep. Dan Goldman, a Democrat from New York, defended his decision not to call for Cuellar\u2019s resignation even though Goldman was one of the earliest and loudest voices to call on Santos to leave Congress. \u201cGeorge Santos had admitted to enough misconduct to show that he should not be a member of Congress,\u201d Goldman said. \u201cHe admitted to lying throughout his campaign, to deceiving his voters. And that is certainly more than enough to warrant an expulsion. \u201cMr. Cuellar is indicted, he\u2019s presumed innocent, he has disputed the charges against him, and until he either admits to the conduct or is convicted of the conduct, or is found by the ethics committee to have violated the rules of the House, he should be presumed innocent,\u201d Goldman added. Rep. Robert Garcia, a California Democrat who helped lead the push to oust Santos, claimed the situation involving the Republican was different because \u201cSantos also admitted to actually a crime,\u201d referring to a case involving two forged checks from 2008 in Brazil. \u201cThat was a trigger for us,\u201d Garcia said. \u201cBut I think what is going on with Henry Cuellar is very serious. \u2026 I\u2019m very disturbed. Democrats should and will react appropriately.\u201d He added that he is not ready to call for Cuellar\u2019s resignation, saying, \u201cI think we have got to wait and see what happens in the weeks ahead.\u201d House Democratic leaders, similarly, have stopped short of calling on Cuellar to resign. Rep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York, the House minority leader, would not say whether he backs Cuellar\u2019s reelection bid but also said he wasn\u2019t revoking his prior endorsement of the Texas Democrat. \u201cI have not rescinded the endorsement,\u201d Jeffries said of Cuellar. And the No. 3 House Democrat, Pete Aguilar of California, wouldn\u2019t comment when asked whether he backs Cuellar\u2019s reelection bid, even in the face of three of the Texas Democrats\u2019 associates pleading guilty in his bribery case. \u201cI\u2019ll talk about it in the press conference next week,\u201d he told CNN. While House Democratic leaders plan to wait out Cuellar\u2019s case, the issue could come to a head more quickly for Menendez in the Senate. If Menendez were to face expulsion, he would be only the 16th\u00a0senator ever expelled \u2014 and the first since 1862. Fourteen of the previously expelled senators were removed from 1861-1862 due to their support for the Confederacy. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York refused to comment when asked whether he\u2019d support expelling Menendez if he is convicted. \u201cHe\u2019s on trial so I\u2019m not going to comment,\u201d he told reporters last week. But others signaled an openness to it. Sen. Jon Tester, a Montana Democrat whose seat is vulnerable, said he wants to see how the trial goes but acknowledged that a conviction would force him to change his approach to Menendez. \u201cI will cross that bridge when we get to it,\u201d Tester said. \u201cWe\u2019ll let the legal system do what it needs to do. As I\u2019ve said every time, nobody is above the law. If he\u2019s found to be guilty, that does change the equation.\u201d Other vulnerable Democrats \u2014 Bob Casey of Pennsylvania and Sherrod Brown of Ohio \u2014 both said they would wait for the trial to play out before taking a position on a potential Menendez expulsion. \u201cI called on him to resign months ago,\u201d Casey told CNN. \u201cMy position has been very clear.\u201d Some were more open to an actual expulsion. Sen. Michael Bennet, a Colorado Democrat, added that Menendez should be expelled if he is convicted. \u201cI haven\u2019t thought about that or spent one second on it, but I guess if he\u2019s convicted, he should be,\u201d he said. Others were careful not to go as far. \u201cLook, my view is he should have resigned long ago,\u201d said Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat. Asked again whether he should be expelled if convicted, Warren added: \u201cRight now, I said he should resign. He does not belong here.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/19/politics/democratic-senators-bob-menendez/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/20/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_06_politics_biden-israel-partisan-split-analysis", "text": "President Joe Biden is facing more critical moments this week that will test his fraught relationship with his base over Israel\u2019s war in Gaza and potentially widen the partisan split about the Jewish state that has been building for years. Long before the current conflict, polls showed that sympathies among rank-and-file Democrats have been shifting from Israel toward the Palestinians over roughly the past two decades\u00a0\u2014 a period that coincides with almost unbroken right-leaning governments in Israel, mostly led by current Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Simultaneously, support for Israel over that same long period has markedly increased among rank-and-file Republican voters. As a result, over twice as many Republican as Democratic voters now say they sympathize more with Israel than with the Palestinians, a much bigger gap between the parties than earlier in this century, according to Gallup Organization polling. This widening partisan chasm in the United States suggests that whenever Netanyahu leaves the political stage in Israel, an inescapable part of his legacy will be a leading role in shattering the bipartisan consensus that for decades provided Israel an almost unassailable position in US politics. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that the drivers of the US-Israeli relationship that have accounted for its resilience, its special quality and character over the years, are more under stress than at any point in my government experience or even out of government,\u201d said Aaron David Miller, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace who has advised six secretaries of state on the Mideast. That rising pressure could make Biden the last of his kind: Though the vast majority of Democratic office-holders show no penchant to fundamentally break with Israel, Biden could be the last Democratic president for the foreseeable future who aligns so unreservedly with the nation. He\u2019s expected to make a speech on antisemitism on Tuesday at an event sponsored by the Holocaust Memorial Museum. Meanwhile, Democratic critics of his handling of the war will be watching on Wednesday when his administration is due to report to Congress on whether Israel is using US weapons in accordance with international law and is cooperating with the delivery of humanitarian aid. Biden\u2019s deep personal bond with Israel already makes him a throwback in US politics. In the first half century after Israel\u2019s formation in 1948, it was Democratic presidents such as Harry Truman, Lyndon B. Johnson, Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton who displayed the greatest emotional connection to the Jewish state. Republican presidents including Dwight Eisenhower, Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush also supported Israel but more overtly qualified that support when it conflicted with their other regional goals of preserving access to oil and repelling Soviet influence; Reagan and Bush each at points protested Israeli actions they opposed by temporarily withholding aid. Over roughly the past quarter century this partisan pattern has inverted. Republican Presidents George W. Bush and Donald Trump have identified most thoroughly with Israel, while Clinton (in his second term) and Barack Obama experienced the most disagreements with the Israeli government. Many factors have contributed to this reversal of roles. Bush\u2019s campaign against Islamic extremism after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks encouraged him to place more value on Israel as a regional ally. Growing identification with Israel among US White evangelical Christians, a key GOP constituency, also nudged the party toward greater support for the Jewish state. Conversely, more voters in the Democratic coalition (both racial minorities and liberal Whites) came to see Israel\u2019s treatment of the occupied Palestinian territories as colonial, or even apartheid-type, oppression. While holding the prime minister position in the late 1990s and then again with only brief interruption since 2009, Netanyahu has also played a huge personal role in prompting this American partisan reversal. Netanyahu has pursued staunchly conservative policies within Israel (such as his attempt to weaken the judiciary that triggered massive nationwide protest) and rebuffed pressure from successive Democratic presidents to negotiate an independent Palestinian state. As important, he has aligned with the Republican Party as overtly as any foreign leader has with either political party in modern times. Netanyahu in 2015, for instance, delivered a speech to Congress opposing the Iran nuclear deal at the invitation of House Republicans \u2014 over express objections from Obama. And Netanyahu recently echoed Republican talking points at a news conference when he dismissed the protests about the war on US campuses as simply widespread antisemitism. Against this backdrop, partisan polarization about Israel among American voters was already widening years before the brutal Hamas attack last October and the devastating Israeli response it triggered. One measure is the annual Gallup polls that ask Americans whether they sympathize mostly with Israel or mostly with the Palestinians. In 2001, the share of Republican voters who said they sympathized mostly with Israel exceeded the share of Democrats by only eight percentage points (59% vs. 51%.) By Obama\u2019s second term, Republican partisans were over 20 points more likely than Democrats to say they sympathized mostly with Israel. The gap between the parties in sympathy for Israel expanded under Trump to nearly 40 points, and it has soared to 45 points under Biden \u2014 nearly six times the difference in 2001. In the 2023 and 2024 surveys, Gallup recorded for the first time that the share of Democrats who sympathized mostly with the Palestinians exceeded the share who mostly favored Israel. Another long-running survey series from the Chicago Council on Global Affairs found similar, though not quite as extensive, movement. In 2002, the share of Republicans who said the US should take Israel\u2019s side in the conflict was roughly double the percentage of Democrats; in the latest survey, \u00a0conducted this February, the gap had grown to about 3-to-1. The survey found that the share of Democrats who said the US should align with Israel in the conflict, after falling through the Trump years, rebounded to nearly 1-in-5 in the latest poll, almost exactly its level in the early 2000s. But as many Democrats now say the US should side with the Palestinians \u2013 a view held by just 1-in-50 Democrats in 2002. (That\u2019s also the same share of Republicans today\u00a0 who say the US should side with the Palestinians.) Most Democrats said the US should not take either side in the conflict \u2014 a view shared by only about two-fifths of Republicans. An array of polls this spring show how the war in Gaza has hardened this partisan split. \u00a0Earlier this year, both Quinnipiac University and CBS/YouGov polls found that while about 55% of Republicans wanted the US to send more military aid to Israel, about two-thirds of Democrats did not. Nearly half of Democrats, but only a little over one-fifth of Republicans in the CBS poll, said the US should pressure Israel to stop the fighting. While a slim majority of Republicans expressed confidence in Netanyahu in an April Pew survey, over 7-in-10 Democrats said they had little or no faith in the Israeli leader \u201dto do the right thing.\u201d In the Quinnipiac survey just 5% of Democrats said they had a favorable view of Netanyahu; the number was 11 times as high among Republicans. All of the dividing lines separating the parties are also cleaving the generations. Just 1-in-12 young adults in the Quinnipiac poll said they had a favorable view of Netanyahu and over two-thirds opposed sending more arms to Israel; likewise, in the Pew survey about two-thirds of young adults said they viewed the Israeli government unfavorably. Gallup\u2019s latest poll found that while older adults still mostly favor Israel, a plurality of younger adults now express sympathy for the Palestinians. These shifts in attitudes within the Democratic coalition have only modestly changed behavior among the party\u2019s leading elected officials. Only 37 House Democrats ultimately voted against the recently approved foreign aid package that included over $26 billion in new military assistance to Israel. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, despite an earlier speech criticizing Netanyahu, is reportedly joining with House Speaker Mike Johnson to invite the Israeli leader to address a joint congressional session \u2014 an extraordinary opportunity given how many of Biden\u2019s requests Netanyahu has resisted since the war began. Liberal critics of Israel\u2019s approach to the Palestinians, both before and after the October 7 attacks, largely attribute the widening disconnect between Democratic voters and elected officials to the influence of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, and other pro-Israeli lobbying groups in Washington. Since the Obama presidency, AIPAC has become more aggressive in supporting primary campaigns against Democratic officials critical of Israel; it has pledged to spend $100 million this year to defeat members of Congress who have criticized Israel\u2019s conduct of the war most strongly such as Democratic Reps. Jamaal Bowman of New York and Cori Bush of Missouri. \u201cAIPAC\u2019s enormous financial and political pressure in Washington is the most important factor in slowing down larger numbers of Democratic officials from opposing Israel\u2019s war in Gaza,\u201d said Waleed Shahid, who has held senior positions in multiple liberal organizations and has been active in organizing opposition to the war. \u201cBy targeting Democrats who oppose a blank check of weapons funding to Israel, AIPAC aims to stall an inevitable generational shift within the party.\u201d Yet AIPAC\u2019s influence alone doesn\u2019t explain the distance opening between Democratic voters and officials. Part of the answer, as Shahid suggests, is generational. Biden personifies an older cohort of US political leaders whose image of Israel was formed when it was a lonely outpost of democracy and haven for Holocaust survivors. Ordinary Americans and US political leaders alike in the years of the 1967 and Yom Kippur (1973) wars tended to view Israel, in Miller\u2019s words, as a David barely fending off threatening Goliaths; now, many younger Democrats in particular believe \u201cIsrael is no longer David, it\u2019s Goliath,\u201d and it \u201cis pounding David\u201d in Gaza, Miller said. Older Democratic officials have been less influenced than younger ones by the emergence of that new perspective among their voters. Many observers also note that Biden tends to view foreign policy much as he does domestic politics \u2014 placing enormous confidence in his ability to leverage personal relationships with other leaders. \u201cBiden always says \u2018all foreign policy is an extension of personal relationships,\u2019\u201d said Ben Rhodes, who served as a senior National Security Council adviser while Biden served as Obama\u2019s vice president. \u201cI don\u2019t know how many times I heard him say that.\u201d Biden over the course of the war has more explicitly criticized Netanyahu and the far-right coalition that he is governing with, but he has still rebuffed rising demands within Democratic ranks to penalize Israel for its conduct of the war and resistance to the delivery of humanitarian aid. \u201cWe\u2019re almost at the seventh month of this war, and this administration has been reluctant to impose a single cost or consequence on this Israeli government that normal humans would regard as serious or significant pressure,\u201d said Miller. Instead, Miller added, Biden is still operating primarily from the belief that to achieve his goals in the region \u2014 more humanitarian aid into Gaza, a ceasefire that leads to further hostage releases and eventually a regional accord between Israel and Saudi Arabia \u2014 \u201che cannot do that by creating a sustained public breach with the Israeli prime minister. He needs Israel\u2019s acquiescence if not its active assistance.\u201d Biden allies also believe Israel\u2019s critics within the party are overstating the political risks of his continued support. Though polls show widespread opposition to the war among both young people and Democrats more broadly, they also usually show that those voters prioritize other issues more. \u201cWhile some elements of the party\u2019s activist core are focused on what\u2019s happening in Gaza, most Democrats and most Americans are not,\u201d said long-time Democratic pollster Mark Mellman, president of the Democratic Majority for Israel, a pro-Israeli group. \u201cRather they are seized with other issues \u2014 whether it\u2019s holding down prices or protecting abortion rights or protecting democracy itself. \u201c But as the war persists \u2014 with the wave of campus protests compounding the fractures over the issue in the Democratic coalition \u2014 there are clear signs the party\u2019s center of gravity is moving away from the instinctive support for Israel expressed by older Democrats such as Biden and Schumer. The telltale sign is not the escalating outrage over the war from liberals long critical of Netanyahu and far-right Israeli governments, such as Sen. Bernie Sanders and members of \u201cthe squad\u201d in the House. Rather the key measure is the willingness of ambitious mid-career Democrats closer to the party center to criticize Israel\u2019s conduct of the war more openly and to indicate support for limiting the future transfer of offensive weapons; the list of Democrats in that camp include Sens. Chris Murphy of Connecticut, Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, Chris Coons of Delaware and Tim Kaine of Virginia. Biden only agreed to deliver the report due Wednesday on Israel\u2019s use of US weapons and cooperation with international aid after pressure from a group of about 20 Democratic senators led by Van Hollen. Though almost all Democratic senators voted for the recent military aid package for Israel, Biden risks alienating many who supported the assistance if Wednesday\u2019s report to Congress does not seriously address whether Israel should be penalized for its actions in the war, said Amanda Klasing, the national director of government relations and advocacy for Amnesty International. Amnesty recently issued a report charging that Israel has targeted civilians with US weapons in violation of international law. \u201cBiden has a Democratic caucus that is putting a lot of faith in this process,\u201d she said. \u201cThey have taken these votes under the assumption that these conditions will be applied by the administration.\u201d The Israeli prime minister\u2019s personal relationship with Trump is prickly, but Netanyahu\u2019s hardline approach toward both the Palestinians and Iran has encouraged the GOP\u2019s transformation into what Miller calls \u201cthe Israel can do no wrong party.\u201d If Israel elects a more centrist government in the future, Miller believes, the widening US partisan divide over Israel could narrow. But given the alienation about Israeli actions among Democratic partisans in general \u2014 and younger voters in particular \u2014 it seems virtually guaranteed that Democratic elected officials in the years ahead will face greater pressure than Republicans to maintain a critical distance from Israel. So far, Biden has been much more inclined to resist than respond to that pressure. A ceasefire could diffuse that pressure for a time. But even Biden may not be able to ignore the inevitable backlash among Democrats if Netanyahu, with or without a cease fire, eventually fulfills his pledge to launch a ground invasion of Rafah. The fierce Israeli response to the terrorist attacks of October 7 may leave in rubble not just much of Gaza, but the US tradition of bipartisan support for Israel.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/06/politics/biden-israel-partisan-split-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/20/2024", "section": "politics"}}

Gretchen Whitmer is now looking to unseat an incumbent county sheriff. Eric Molitor has filed to run in the Republican primary this August against Trent Taylor, the sheriff of deep-red Wexford County in Northern Michigan. His central message, he told CNN, is ensuring \u201cthe least amount of government involvement and intrusion in our lives.\u201d The 40-year-old from Cadillac, Michigan, describes himself as a \u201cbig political activist\u201d and says he was considering running for township supervisor, but a conversation that he and his brother had with Taylor last month inspired him to enter the race for sheriff instead. \u201cI walked away from there having nothing but the utmost respect for how he handled the situation because we have really tough questions for somebody running for an office, and (Taylor) did not hesitate,\u201d he said. But Molitor said Taylor told them that he would enforce the state\u2019s recently enacted \u201cred flag\u201d gun safety law, which Molitor believes to be \u201chighly unconstitutional.\u201d The law, signed last year by Whitmer, a Democrat, makes it easier for law enforcement authorities to seize firearms from people who are believed to be a danger to themselves or others. It was among a series of gun safety laws signed by the Michigan governor after a string of deadly mass shootings, including at Michigan State University in February 2023 that left three dead and several others wounded. Taylor told CNN he believes he\u2019s constitutionally obligated to enforce the state\u2019s laws and that it would be \u201creckless\u201d not to do so, as Molitor has said he would. \u201cHe has a right to run,\u201d Taylor, who is seeking a third four-year term, said of his opponent. \u201cI hope that the citizens of Wexford County will recognize I have done a good job, along with my team, and they\u2019ll cast their vote for me in the August primary.\u201d In September, a jury found Molitor not guilty of one count of providing material support for a terrorist act and possessing a firearm when committing or attempting to commit a felony. State prosecutors had alleged that Molitor and others targeted Whitmer\u2019s Northern Michigan vacation cottage and conducted surveillance of her home. Molitor and his two co-defendants, who were also acquitted in the fall trial, were the last of a group of 14 people prosecuted in state and federal courts in connection to the kidnapping plot. Ultimately, nine were convicted or pleaded guilty in the case, and five were acquitted. Molitor told CNN his experience opened his eyes to flaws in the justice system. \u201cI had no idea how our system actually worked until I went through it at this level,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was insanity.\u201d Molitor said he and others who feel wronged by the system, including those acquitted of charges in connection with the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol, have a \u201cduty\u201d to \u201cstep forth\u201d and enact reform. \u201cApathy is what got us where we are today. We need to be the change that we want. And you know, to sit there and say somebody needs to do it is so unfair when we are the ones who have been personally affected by the issues that we\u2019ve seen,\u201d he said. Though Molitor said his experience has altered some of his opinions, he denied the notion that he was completely \u201canti-government\u201d or \u201canti-law enforcement,\u201d explaining that he feels called to be an \u201carbiter between the people and the powers that be.\u201d Currently, in order to run for sheriff in Michigan, candidates must live and be eligible to vote in the county where they\u2019re seeking a four-year term. The Michigan House passed legislation late last year that would require new candidates for county sheriff to be a licensed law enforcement officer or a certified corrections officer with at least five years of experience. It is currently under referral by a committee in the state Senate. Both chambers are controlled by Democrats. The Michigan Sheriffs\u2019 Association is backing the bill. Dan Pfannes, the group\u2019s deputy director, said the organization had hoped it would have been signed into law before last month\u2019s candidate filing deadlines for the 2024 races. \u201cOne of the things we were hoping to do was put those qualifications into place sooner rather than later,\u201d he said, noting that he thinks the legislation is still on a \u201cgood path\u201d to eventual passage. Pfannes made clear the sheriffs\u2019 association thinks the bill would be \u201cpart of the efforts to enhance our profession.\u201d The organization would not comment on Molitor\u2019s candidacy, citing group policy. Molitor does not have a law enforcement background. He previously worked as a subcontractor in the security field. The Michigan Democratic Party responded to Molitor\u2019s candidacy earlier this month, calling him a \u201cMAGA Republican,\u201d a reference to former President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d slogan. Trump has not made an endorsement in the primary. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that there\u2019s no line Michigan Republicans won\u2019t cross \u2014 this candidate is only the latest in the long line of the MAGA MIGOP\u2019s roster of extremists running at various levels of the ballot,\u201d the Michigan Democratic Party said in a statement. It also pointed to Michele Lundgren, one of the 16 people facing charges related to the 2020 election subversion plot in Michigan, who is now running in a Republican primary for a state House seat. While Molitor currently identifies as a Republican, he said he previously aligned with \u201cliberal independent\u201d ideology. He said he voted for Whitmer and Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel, also a Democrat, when they first sought their offices in 2018. \u201cI saw two strong women, and I was like, \u2018Let\u2019s see what the hell these two can do,\u2019\u201d he recalled. He now aligns with the Republican Party because he believes conservatives are \u201cmore concerned with protecting all rights,\u201d specifically pointing to free speech. as a key issue. Molitor said he supported Trump in 2016 and 2020, and intends to back the presumptive Republican nominee again in November.

The New York Democrat called the legislation \u201ca tough, serious-minded, and \u2013 critically, bipartisan \u2013 proposal to secure our border\u201d in a \u201cDear Colleague\u201d letter. The initial package, which included tough border provisions and foreign aid to US allies, was blocked in February by the Senate amid a torrent of attacks by top House Republicans and former President Donald Trump, who is making the border a central campaign issue in his race for the White House. The Senate\u00a0passed\u00a0a separate foreign aid package last month. \u201cBack in January, the former President urged Congressional Republicans to kill the bipartisan bill, telling the world proudly to \u2018blame it on me.\u2019 The American people do not have the luxury of playing partisan blame games. They want bipartisan action to secure our border,\u201d Schumer said in the letter, which did not specify when the bill would be taken up. Schumer acknowledged that he doesn\u2019t expect all Democrats will support the stand-alone border bill \u2014 with some caucus members saying earlier this year the legislation \u201cmisses the mark.\u201d Republican leaders have already said they oppose Schumer\u2019s move to revote on the legislation, making it unlikely the bill can secure the 60 votes it would need to advance. President Joe Biden previously endorsed the border provisions, and while Trump and other Republicans have called it too weak, the bill would have marked a tough change to immigration law and would have given the president far-reaching powers to restrict\u00a0illegal migrant crossings at the southern border. The White House and top Democrats have discussed taking more action on the border ahead of the first presidential debate next month, CNN previously reported. Those plans, intended to strengthen the party\u2019s hand on a critical campaign issue ahead of the 2024 election, also potentially include a sweeping executive order limiting migrants\u2019 ability to seek asylum, sources have told CNN.
