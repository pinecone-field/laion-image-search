She was 86. \u201cAs a sister, aunt, cousin, neighbor, and friend to so many, she was beloved beyond words by countless others whose lives were improved by her presence,\u201d the statement from\u00a0Barack and Michelle Obama, Craig and Kelly Robinson, and their children said in part. \u201cShe passed\u00a0peacefully this morning, and right now,\u00a0none of us are\u00a0quite sure how exactly we\u2019ll move on without her,\u201d the statement said. Michelle Obama posted on social media, \u201cMy mom Marian Robinson was my rock, always there for whatever I needed. She was the same steady backstop for our entire family, and we are heartbroken to share she passed away today.\u201d \u201cThere was and will be only one Marian Robinson. In our sadness, we are lifted up by the extraordinary gift of her life. And we will spend the rest of ours trying to live up to her example,\u201d Barack Obama wrote on X. Robinson lived with the Obamas during their time at the White House and was often spotted at events with the first family, including handing\u00a0out goodie bags to trick-or-treaters\u00a0on Halloween. \u201cWe needed her. The girls needed her,\u201d the family\u2019s statement said of her move to Washington. \u201cAnd she ended up being our rock through it all.\u201d A native of Chicago \u2013 where she returned after the Obamas left the White House \u2013 Robinson was married to Fraser Robinson, and the pair had two children, Michelle and Craig. Fraser Robinson died in 1991 after a long struggle with multiple sclerosis. Marian Robinson was heavily involved in her kids\u2019 education, according to the statement. The family recalled Robinson as having taught \u201cher children to read at an early age, sitting together as they sounded out words on a page, giving them the strength and confidence to walk to school.\u201d They also highlighted her presence in a historic moment. \u201cOn Election Night in 2008, when the news broke that Barack would soon shoulder the weight of the world, she was there, holding his hand,\u201d the statement read. David Axelrod, former Obama senior adviser, remembered Robinson as \u201cjust a great lady.\u201d \u201cShe was a South Sider through and through,\u201d Axelrod, a CNN senior political commentator, told CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer on \u201cThe Situation Room\u201d on Friday, adding that during her time at the White House, \u201cshe did not take to the whole celebrity lifestyle.\u201d Instead, Axelrod said, \u201cshe would often slip out of the White House on her own and visit with friends. \u2026 She really wasn\u2019t looking for attention.\u201d Years after the unveiling of the Obamas\u2019 portraits at the Smithsonian\u2019s National Portrait Gallery in 2018, Michelle Obama recalled how impactful her mother\u2019s reaction had been when she took her to the museum after hours. \u201c(It was) quiet and (I was) watching my mom, Marian Robinson, sit at the base of my portrait and look up at it with such a level of awe,\u201d she said when the portraits were temporarily moved to Chicago. \u201cAnd for me, watching her see me in that way meant the world to me,\u201d Michelle Obama said.

{"id": "2024_05_31_politics_fact-check-trump-post-conviction-speech", "text": "Former President Donald Trump said he was going to hold a \u201cpress conference\u201d on Friday in the wake of his Thursday conviction in Manhattan on felony charges of falsifying business records. Instead, Trump delivered a rambling monologue that was filled with false claims on subjects ranging from the Manhattan trial to immigration to tax policy. Here is a fact check of some of the inaccurate or unsubstantiated claims he made. Crime in New York City Trump repeated his familiar claim that, while Manhattan prosecutors have been focusing on him, New York City has been experiencing record-high violent crime. He said this time that \u201cyou have violent crime all over this city at levels that nobody\u2019s ever seen before.\u201d Facts First: Trump\u2019s claim is not even close to true. Violent crime in New York City \u2013 and violent crime in Manhattan in particular \u2013 has plummeted since the early 1990s and is today nowhere near record levels. New York City recorded 391 murders in 2023, down about 83% from the 2,262 in 1990; 1,455 rapes in 2023, down about 53% from the 3,126 in 1990; and 16,910 robberies in 2023, down about 83% from the 100,280 in 1990. Michael Cohen\u2019s crimes Criticizing key prosecution witness Michael Cohen, Trump repeated a claim he made during the trial in April. He asserted that Cohen, his former lawyer and fixer, \u201cgot into trouble not because of me\u201d but because of \u201coutside deals\u201d and \u201csomething to do with taxicabs and medallions, and he borrowed money, and that\u2019s why he went.\u201d He added that Cohen pleaded guilty to campaign finance violations to try to get himself a lighter penalty. Trump continued: \u201cHe got in trouble for a very simple reason: because he was involved with borrowing a lot of money and he did something with the banks \u2013 I don\u2019t know, defrauded the banks, but something happened.\u201d Facts First:\u00a0Trump\u2019s claim that Cohen got into trouble simply because of his non-Trump-related activities, such as those related to taxis and loans, is not true. First, Cohen\u2019s case was referred to federal prosecutors in New York by the special counsel, Robert Mueller, who was appointed to investigate any connections between the Trump campaign and Russia. Second, Cohen\u2019s three-year prison sentence in 2018 was for\u00a0multiple\u00a0crimes, some of which were directly related to Trump.\u00a0 Most notably, Cohen was sentenced for\u00a0campaign finance offenses\u00a0connected to a hush money scheme\u00a0during the 2016 presidential campaign to conceal Trump\u2019s alleged extramarital relationships \u2013 the same hush money scheme that was central to this prosecution against Trump. Cohen was\u00a0also sentenced to two months in prison, to run concurrently with the three-year sentence, for\u00a0lying to Congress in 2017 in relation to previous talks about the possibility of building a Trump Tower in Moscow, Russia, including about the\u00a0extent of Trump\u2019s involvement in the aborted Moscow initiative\u00a0and about when in 2016 the discussions ended.\u00a0(The discussions continued into June 2016, the month after Trump\u00a0became the presumptive Republican nominee, and did not conclude in January 2016 before the first votes were cast, as Cohen had claimed.) Referring to Trump as \u201cIndividual-1,\u201d Cohen\u00a0said\u00a0at the time of his 2018 guilty plea for making false statements to the US\u00a0Senate Select Committee on Intelligence: \u201cI made these statements to be consistent with Individual-1\u2019s political messaging and out of loyalty to Individual-1.\u201d When Cohen pleaded guilty in 2018 to the campaign finance violations, he\u00a0said\u00a0he broke the law \u201cin coordination and at the direction of a candidate for federal office,\u201d\u00a0Trump. Biden and the case Trump repeated his frequent claim that the Manhattan case in which Trump was convicted \u201cis all done by Biden and his people\u201d and \u201cin total conjunction with white house and the DOJ,\u201d the federal Department of Justice. Facts First:\u00a0There is no basis for Trump\u2019s claim. There is no evidence that President Joe Biden, his White House aides or the federal Justice Department had any role in launching or running Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg\u2019s prosecution\u00a0\u2013\u00a0and Bragg, a Democrat, is a locally elected official who does not report to the federal government. The\u00a0indictment\u00a0in the case was approved by a grand jury of ordinary citizens. Trump has\u00a0repeatedly invoked\u00a0a lawyer on Bragg\u2019s team, Matthew Colangelo, while making such claims; Colangelo left the Justice Department in 2022\u00a0to join the district attorney\u2019s office\u00a0as\u00a0senior counsel to Bragg. But there is no evidence that Biden had anything to do with Colangelo\u2019s employment decision. Colangelo and Bragg had been colleagues before Bragg was elected Manhattan district attorney in 2021. Before Colangelo worked at the Justice Department, he and Bragg worked at the same time in the office of New York\u2019s state attorney general, where Colangelo\u00a0investigated Trump\u2019s charity\u00a0and Trump\u2019s financial practices and was\u00a0involved in bringing various lawsuits\u00a0against the Trump administration. The judge and an expert in election law Trump claimed that, because of Judge Juan Merchan, \u201cwe weren\u2019t allowed to use our election expert under any circumstances.\u201d He claimed that this expert on election law was ready to testify \u201cand the judge knocked him out, said you can\u2019t testify.\u201d Facts First:\u00a0Trump\u2019s claim that Merchan refused to allow Trump\u2019s team to use this witness \u201cunder any circumstances\u201d is false. Merchan did not prohibit the potential witness, former\u00a0Federal Election Commission\u00a0chairman Bradley Smith, from testifying. Rather, Merchan\u00a0limited what Smith was allowed to testify about. Merchan\u00a0decided\u00a0in March that Smith could provide background information about the FEC and define certain terms relevant to this case but could not opine on whether Trump broke federal election laws or offer opinions about how to interpret or apply those laws. After Merchan\u00a0refused last week to change his mind, Trump\u2019s defense decided not to call Smith as a witness.\u00a0 Smith\u00a0wrote\u00a0on social media last week: \u201cJudge Merchan has so restricted my testimony that defense has decided not to call me.\u201d Trump, offering a hint of a clarification, did proceed to say on Friday that Smith \u201cessentially\u201d was not able to testify. But his earlier comments made it sound like Merchan had imposed a total ban on Smith\u2019s testimony. Immigration and \u2018the Congo\u2019 Trump repeated a claim he has made before about \u201cthe Congo\u201d and migration, again without specifying whether he was referring to the Democratic Republic of Congo or the neighboring Republic of Congo. He said: \u201cThe Congo has just released a lot of people from jail \u2013 Congo, Africa \u2013 just released a lot of people, a lot of people, from their prisons and jails, and brought them into the United States of America.\u201d Facts First:\u00a0Trump\u2019s claim is baseless. Experts on the Democratic Republic of Congo and the Republic of Congo, plus both pro-immigration and anti-immigration organizations in the US, told CNN they have not seen any evidence of Congolese prisons being emptied, let alone evidence of either country somehow having \u201cbrought\u201d ex-prisoners into the US. Trump\u2019s presidential campaign and an allied super PAC did not respond to requests to provide any evidence. A CNN search of two media databases turned up no evidence. And federal figures show that there is no \u201cvery big\u201d influx of Congolese migrants of any kind, let alone former prisoners in particular. \u201cEverything he is saying isn\u2019t true,\u201d Democratic Republic of Congo spokesperson Patrick Muyaya Katembwe told CNN in a text message in March. Asked specifically about Trump\u2019s claims about Congolese prisons being emptied of violent criminals, he said, \u201cNever ever, it\u2019s not true.\u201d And, he said, \u201cwe want him to stop\u201d telling these stories, since \u201cit\u2019s very bad for the country.\u201d Serge Mombouli, the Republic of Congo\u2019s ambassador to the US, said in an email to CNN in March:\u00a0\u201cThere is no truth or any sign nor a single fact supporting such a claim or statement.\u201d You can read more\u00a0here. Trump and Nord Stream 2 Trump repeated his claim that he had ended a key Russian project \u2013 the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline to Germany. He said: \u201cYou know, I ended the Russian pipeline. It was dead.\u201d Facts First:\u00a0Trump\u2019s claim is false. He did not \u201cend\u201d Nord Stream nor render it \u201cdead.\u201d While he did\u00a0approve sanctions\u00a0on companies working on the project, that move came nearly three years into his presidency, when the pipeline was already\u00a0around 90% complete\u00a0\u2013 and the state-owned Russian gas company behind the project\u00a0said\u00a0shortly after the sanctions that it would complete the pipeline itself. The company\u00a0announced\u00a0in December 2020 that construction was resuming. And with days left in Trump\u2019s term in January 2021, Germany\u00a0announced\u00a0that it had renewed permission for construction in its waters. The pipeline never began operations; Germany ended up\u00a0halting the project\u00a0as Russia was about to invade Ukraine in early 2022. The pipeline was damaged later that year in what has been\u00a0described as a likely act of sabotage. Biden\u2019s tax policy Trump claimed while denouncing the Biden administration: \u201cThey want to raise your taxes by four times.\u201d Facts First: This is false, just as it was when Trump made the same claim during the 2020 election campaign and in early 2024. Biden has not proposed to quadruple Americans\u2019 taxes, and there has never been any indication that he is seeking to do so. The nonpartisan Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center think tank, which analyzed Biden\u2019s never-implemented budget proposals for fiscal 2024, found this: \u201cHis plan would raise average after-tax incomes for low-income households in 2024, leave them effectively unchanged for middle-income households, and lower after-tax incomes significantly for the highest-income taxpayers.\u201d The Tax Policy Center found that Biden\u2019s proposal would, on average, have raised taxes by about $2,300 \u2013 but that\u2019s about a 2.3% decline in after-tax income, not the massive reduction Trump is suggesting Biden wants. And critically, Tax Policy Center senior fellow Howard Gleckman noted to CNN on Friday that 95% of the tax hike would have been covered by the highest-income 5% of households. The very biggest burden under the Biden plan would have been carried by the very richest households; the Tax Policy Center found that households in the top 0.1% would have seen their after-tax incomes decline by more than 20%. That\u2019s \u201ca lot,\u201d Gleckman noted, but it\u2019s still nowhere near the quadrupling Trump claims Biden is looking for. And again, even this increase would have been only for a tiny subset of the population. Biden has promised not to raise taxes by even a cent for anyone making under $400,000 per year.

{"id": "2024_05_28_politics_third-party-president-what-matters", "text": "They booed former President Donald Trump, the Republican presidential candidate who currently leads in polling in some swing states. They rejected Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the independent candidate who is polling at 15% in some polls. Instead, at its convention over the weekend, the Libertarian Party selected a little-known former congressional candidate, Chase Oliver, who is hoping they can get to 2% of the popular vote on Election Day. Turns out that Libertarians are motivated by the ultrasmall-government mindset that leads them to be Libertarians as opposed to an uncomfortable alliance to benefit Trump or help Kennedy get on a debate stage. A match with Kennedy made some sense, at least on paper. Libertarians currently have ballot access in 38 states. Kennedy is currently on the ballot in six, although he promises to be on more by Election Day. But the idea of simply placing Kennedy atop the Libertarian Party ticket to marry his momentum with their organization left Kennedy with an embarrassing loss at the Libertarian Party convention in Washington. Kennedy did not even advance out of the first round of voting. Neither did Trump, who could arguably appeal to some Libertarians with his anti-government rhetoric. After his address, Trump was barred from taking part in the nominating process because his campaign failed to fill out the proper paperwork. Where does Kennedy\u2019s support come from? Kennedy\u2019s politics are unique, melding his history as an environmental crusader, his deeply held belief in conspiracy theories and his notable vaccine skepticism. These views are not necessarily very Libertarian. He is at odds with his own running mate, Nicole Shanahan, the ex-wife of a Google co-founder and a top benefactor of the campaign. Kennedy and Shanahan disagree on both abortion policy and Middle East policy. Among those who didn\u2019t vote for Biden or Trump in 2020 \u2013 including both those who supported another candidate and those who didn\u2019t vote at all \u2013 Kennedy got the support of 37% in CNN\u2019s poll conducted by SSRS in April. Trump got the backing of 30% of these voters who either opted for a major party alternative or simply didn\u2019t vote. Biden got just 12%. Kennedy may well take more support from Trump than from Biden, but not by a lot, according to a recent analysis by CNN\u2019s Harry Enten (watch it below). As evidence, Enten pointed to Quinnipiac University polling that asked Kennedy supporters who they would support in a two-way matchup. About half \u2013 51% \u2013 said they would support Trump in a two-way matchup, compared with 37% who said they would pick Biden. In a written analysis, Enten points to polling that suggests many of Kennedy\u2019s current supporters are not yet familiar with many of his most notable positions, including on vaccines. Support for third-party candidates has a tendency to flag closer to Election Day. The recent high-water mark is Ross Perot, who got 19% of the vote in 1992. The last third-party candidate to win a state and get Electoral Votes was George Wallace, who won Southern states in 1968. The only third-party candidate to outperform a major party candidate was former President Teddy Roosevelt, who outpolled Republicans after he failed to get their nomination in 1912 and then ran as a third-party candidate. Woodrow Wilson, a Democrat, won that election. What are Libertarians aiming for? While Kennedy is polling better than recent third-party or independent candidates, most of them barely register. If Oliver can reach 2% in the popular vote, that would be better than the Libertarian candidate Jo Jorgensen in 2020 but still far short of Gary Johnson\u2019s 3.28% of the popular vote in 2016. CNN\u2019s Aaron Pellish was at the Libertarian convention. When I asked him why there was so much opposition to Kennedy and Trump, Pellish sent me these distinct thoughts: First and foremost, Libertarian opposition to Trump and Kennedy starts with fundamental disagreements on policy. Despite both candidates calling for the US to reduce its involvement in foreign conflicts, many Libertarians feel Trump and Kennedy don\u2019t go far enough to prevent wars globally. Many Libertarians also support eliminating the Federal Reserve and oppose the government taxing citizens, extreme measures neither Trump nor Kennedy endorsed in their remarks at the convention.  Several Libertarians I spoke to were frustrated by what they viewed as attempts by both candidates to pander to party members for votes in November.  A few convention attendees linked Kennedy and Trump to Bob Barr, the former GOP congressman who ran as the Libertarian presidential nominee in 2008, and to Bill Weld, the former Republican Massachusetts gov. who ran alongside Gary Johnson as the Libertarian Party\u2019s vice presidential nominee. Both Barr and Weld left the Libertarian Party after losing their respective elections.  But the memory of past politicians who used the party for their own gain without fully committing to Libertarian values appeared to undergird the resentment some Libertarians held for the two interlopers. The inverse comparison is Ron Paul, who ran for president as a Libertarian in the 1980s but found greater success when he ran as a Libertarian-leaning Republican. Paul did not \u2013 and never was going to \u2013 get the Republican nomination, but he made a calculated decision that he could more effectively influence the policy conversation from within a major party. Now Kennedy\u2019s campaign, and the super PAC that supports it, will have to continue the slog of getting on ballots in enough states to make a mark on the election. The Green Party is the only third party that is consistently on the ballot in all 50 states. It will not officially select a nominee until July. Jill Stein, the Green Party nominee in 2012 and 2016, is seen as a likely bet. The best recent election for the Green Party came in 2000, when Ralph Nader won more than 2% of the vote and arguably kept Al Gore, the Democrat, from winning Florida and the presidency. Less than 2% can sway an election The Republican consultant who orchestrated George W. Bush\u2019s campaigns, Karl Rove, notes in The Wall Street Journal that the Green Party candidate in 2016, Stein, got more votes than Trump\u2019s margin of victory in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. He concludes Stein arguably cost the Democratic ticket, led by Hillary Clinton, the election. The same thing may have happened in 2020, Rove argues, when the Libertarian\u2019s Jorgensen got less than 2% of the national vote but exceeded Biden\u2019s margin of victory in Arizona, Georgia and Wisconsin. Those stats are true, but Rove\u2019s assessment may be flawed. Johnson, the Libertarian candidate in 2016, outperformed Stein in each of those states Rove mentioned. Trump won anyway. The election reform advocacy group FairVote has compiled data on recent third-party candidates here. But rather than focus on the relatively few people who turn out for a third-party candidate, why not look at the large number of people who don\u2019t take part in elections at all? The 2020 presidential election won by Biden had the highest turnout of any presidential election since 1900. But only about two-thirds \u2013 66% \u2013 of eligible voters turned out to vote, according to an analysis by Pew Research Center, although turnout was higher in some states than others.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/28/politics/third-party-president-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/01/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_29_politics_haley-voters-pennsylvania-trump", "text": "Joan London is carrying a 40-year-old newspaper, its edges frayed and turning yellow. She beams as she unfolds it to show a black and white photograph of her earliest political activism \u2014 holding a 1984 Reagan-Bush campaign sign. On her phone, more GOP pride: photos of London at a rally for a Republican candidate for Pennsylvania governor and in Washington, DC, for a Tea Party event during the Obama presidency. \u201cWhen I was 18, I registered as a Republican,\u201d London said. \u201cI\u2019ve been a Republican for many years until a month ago when I changed by registration from Republican to Independent.\u201d Just before the switch, one last ballot cast as a Republican: a vote for Nikki Haley in Pennsylvania\u2019s April presidential primary, even though the former South Carolina governor had bowed out of the race seven weeks earlier. \u201cIt\u2019s time to pass the baton to a new generation in the Republican Party, and I felt that she was it,\u201d London told CNN in an interview. She cast her Haley protest vote, then left Donald Trump\u2019s GOP. \u201cI have a different vision of what conservatism is,\u201d London said. \u201cI came up in the 80s under (Ronald) Reagan. I\u2019ve always had a very positive vision of self-sufficiency and personal responsibility. \u2026 I\u2019m seeing a change more toward populism which carries some unpleasant baggage, which I didn\u2019t see myself as part of. Didn\u2019t see it reflecting my values.\u201d London is hardly alone. Haley garnered nearly 17% of the primary vote statewide this year \u2014 approaching 25% in the suburban collar counties around Philadelphia. More than 155,000 votes in all \u2014 a potentially decisive bloc in a presidential battleground that Trump carried by 44,292 votes in 2016 and Joe Biden won by 81,660 in 2020. Our conversation with London is part of a CNN project designed to follow the 2024 campaign through the eyes and experiences of voters who live in the battleground states and are critical to deciding the outcome. London is an attorney in Berks County. The shift as you drive northwest from the Philly suburbs is unmistakable. First the farms and silos, then the Trump flags. He carried Berks County by 10 points in 2016 and 8 points in 2020. But even here, Haley received nearly 16% in the primary \u2014 votes Trump can ill afford to lose come November. London\u2019s is all but certainly lost. \u201cI don\u2019t see myself voting for Trump,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t see myself voting for Biden.\u201d For now, her plan is to either skip the presidential line on the ballot or write in a conservative. She knows the math: any subtraction hurts Trump. \u201cI believe we have to send a message that the Republican Party needs to go in a different direction,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a principled position I need to take.\u201d Irma Fralic, too, cast her primary vote for Haley as a protest. \u201cI want a country that is normal,\u201d Fralic said. \u201cI want a country that functions and I want people to be together.\u201d She is the daughter of Cuban immigrants, a staunch supporter of Israel and a Reagan Republican who saw Haley as tough and principled on foreign policy. Now? \u201cI\u2019m not happy with the options, no,\u201d Fralic said. \u201cOne is in court. And the other one is \u2013 I feel bad for him. If he was my father, I\u2019d say, \u2018You might want to reconsider your life.\u2019 I don\u2019t know. And the other one, I would say, \u2018You might want to prioritize your personal problems.\u2019\u201d Our visit to Pennsylvania coincided with Haley announcing she will vote for Trump in November despite significant differences with the presumptive GOP nominee. Haley also said in her announcement last week she wished Trump would make a direct effort to court her supporters. Fralic said Haley\u2019s decision to vote for Trump would not automatically sway her. But she offered this: \u201cThe best way for Trump to reach out to me and the millions who voted for Nikki Haley is to choose her as VP. If that\u2019s the ticket, they have my vote.\u201d London was more muted in her response. \u201cMy respect for Ambassador Haley has not changed whether or not I agree with her choice,\u201d London said in a text exchange. Eyeing Trump, but holding her nose Linda Rooney cast her Haley vote in the primary as a question as much as a protest. \u201cWho are the people in the Republican Party that keep shoving this down our throats right now?\u201d Rooney said. \u201cWhy can\u2019t we elect someone normal? You know, someone who is diplomatic.\u201d Rooney is a registered Republican who voted Trump in 2016 then Biden in 2020. But she has ruled out voting for Biden again. \u201cI don\u2019t trust him with the economy,\u201d said Rooney, who runs a digital communications business from her home in Media, in suburban Delaware County. Rooney\u2019s son serves in the Army. \u201cI\u2019m angry about Afghanistan, about that withdrawal. So, honestly, I can\u2019t vote for him.\u201d Rooney framed her 2024 debate this way: \u201cI can write someone in, or I can just hold my nose and vote for Trump and know that\u2019s only going to be four more years.\u201d Later, in a text exchange, Rooney said, \u201cHaley would be a good VP and possibly keep him in check.\u201d\u00a0Her reaction to the former governor saying she\u2019d vote for Trump was perhaps revealing of where Rooney will end up. \u201cI think Haley is in the same boat as the rest of us who don\u2019t want Trump as our nominee,\u201d Rooney texted. \u201cShe\u2019s just holding her nose earlier than the rest of us.\u201d That Rooney would even consider Trump speaks volumes about her disappointment in Biden. She called Trump\u2019s conduct on January 6, 2021, appalling. \u201cI was angry that Trump didn\u2019t say something,\u201d she said. \u201cThat Trump didn\u2019t stop it. \u2026 So, you know, I just can\u2019t forgive him for that.\u201d She also works as a borough elections monitor and rolled her eyes when told that Trump again recently insisted he won Pennsylvania in 2020. \u201cNo,\u201d Rooney said. \u201cNo.\u201d A veteran who wants anyone but Trump Michael Pesce lives in Bucks County and works in a meat processing plant. He has been a registered Republican for 40 years. \u201cMy first election, presidential election, was 1984,\u201d Pesce said in an interview at his Doylestown home. \u201cI became a Republican when I turned 18 because of Ronald Reagan.\u201d His parents were Democrats. \u201cAt the time, they were, like, \u2018We\u2019re Democrats. We\u2019re not Republicans.\u2019 I was like, \u2018No, no, no, I\u2019m a Reagan Republican.\u201d Pesce is a Coast Guard veteran who voted Trump in 2016 but Biden in 2020. This year? \u201cIf I had my choice, I wouldn\u2019t vote for either,\u201d said Pesce, who backed Haley in the April primary. \u201cBut I will vote for Biden. I will vote for anyone but Trump.\u201d Why? \u201cSo, he tried to overthrow our government, and that\u2019s a problem with me,\u201d Pesce said. \u201cServed in the US military. I just have very strong feelings about what it means to be an American.\u201d Pesce has little patience for those who believe Trump can do no wrong. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to hear that, Ok, he could be a convicted criminal in a couple of days,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to hear that he did all these things.\u201d Pesce said he was \u201cgreatly disappointed\u201d to hear of Haley\u2019s decision to support Trump. \u201cI think she is looking ahead four years,\u201d he said. But it won\u2019t sway him. \u201cI\u2019m a Republican. I\u2019m a conservative,\u201d Pesce said. \u201cI think we spend a lot of money on stuff we don\u2019t need to spend money on.\u201d Yet he will vote Biden and hopes many others among the more than 150,000 Pennsylvania Republicans who cast votes for Haley in the primary will do the same. \u201cIf enough of us Republicans can do the right thing, keep Trump out of office, the next four years aren\u2019t going to be perfect,\u201d Pesce said. \u201cBut I think they are going to be better than the alternative.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/29/politics/haley-voters-pennsylvania-trump/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/01/2024", "section": "politics"}}

{"id": "2024_05_18_politics_politicians-blaming-wives-what-matters", "text": "Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito doesn\u2019t deny there was an upside-down American flag flying outside his house days before Joe Biden was sworn in as president, an apparent distress signal that would seem to express sympathy with the plight of Donald Trump supporters who refused to believe their guy lost the 2020 election. But Alito did offer an excuse for the flag, which had become a symbol of the \u201cStop the Steal\u201d movement before and after the election. \u201cI had no involvement whatsoever in the flying of the flag,\u201d Alito said in a written statement to The New York Times, which first reported the story. \u201cIt was briefly placed by Mrs. Alito in response to a neighbor\u2019s use of objectionable and personally insulting language on yard signs.\u201d So the wife did it to get back at the neighbors. Her first name is Martha-Ann, by the way. A Supreme Court justice being unmasked as having a partisan tilt wouldn\u2019t be illegal \u2013 just awkward and icky. Alito won\u2019t even have to recuse himself from any cases for possibly showing an electoral preference since there\u2019s no binding code of ethics for Supreme Court justices. He clarified on May 29 in a letter to lawmakers that he would not recuse himself from any cases as a result of the flag controversy. His wife, Alito said, is entitled to her First Amendment rights. \u201cMy wife is fond of flying flags,\u201d\u00a0Alito\u00a0wrote. \u201cI am not.\u201d And the Alito flag incident is small time compared with the direct involvement of Justice Clarence Thomas\u2019 wife Ginni in the \u201cStop the Steal\u201d rally on January 6, 2021, and her active texting with officials in the White House about how to overturn election results \u2013 something for which Thomas has not offered excuse, apology or recusal. But the \u201cMrs. defense\u201d could be used in much more serious matters than flag flying. Menendez \u2018in the dark\u2019 Take the prosecution of Sen. Bob Menendez, the New Jersey Democrat on trial in New York for federal bribery charges. Menendez\u2019s trial is severed from one of his co-defendants, his wife, Nadine. Both Mr. and Mrs. Menendez deny wrongdoing, but at the outset of his trial this month, it seemed likely that one element of his defense could be to blame his wife. The senator was \u201cin the dark\u201d on money matters, his attorney told jurors. Most of the communication referenced in the indictment is between Nadine Menendez and the New Jersey businessmen who are alleged to have coughed up gold bars and envelopes of cash, along with much more, as they sought Sen. Menendez\u2019s help. Couples behaving badly Former Rep. Duncan Hunter, a California Republican, pioneered the Mrs. defense when he and his wife were both accused of funneling campaign funds for private use. Hunter\u2019s defense was that his wife, Margaret, handled the finances in their personal lives and for his campaign. Both Hunters ultimately pleaded guilty and were later pardoned by Trump. Will it ultimately be a similar story in the prosecution of Rep. Henry Cuellar, a Texas Democrat, who has been charged in a bribery scheme along with his wife, Imelda? The Cuellars present a united front and deny all wrongdoing. Prosecutors allege payments to the couple were laundered through \u201csham consulting contracts\u201d made to \u201cfront companies\u201d owned by Mrs. Cuellar. Couples behaving badly is nothing new in US politics. Former Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr., an Illinois Democrat, and his wife, Sandra, pleaded guilty to misusing campaign funds to fuel a lavish lifestyle. Variations on the theme Former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell and his wife, Maureen, were convicted of public corruption in 2014. Their strategy at trial was to portray the former Republican governor as being in the dark about his wife\u2019s activities. A unanimous US Supreme Court, including Alito, later vacated the governor\u2019s conviction and narrowed the scope by which prosecutors can pursue bribery allegations. The Mrs. defense could conceivably be turned on its head and used by a powerful woman to blame her husband. Rep. Cori Bush, a Missouri Democrat, is under investigation for misusing funds to pay her husband for security services. Bush said in a statement that she retained her husband\u2019s security services \u201cbecause he has had extensive experience in this area, and is able to provide the necessary services at or below a fair market rate,\u201d according to CNN\u2019s report. Wives taking the blame, sometimes deservedly, is not a uniquely Washington problem. In April, an Iowa woman named Kim Taylor was sentenced to eight months in prison, according to local reports, for an unsuccessful ballot stuffing scheme to help her husband in a Republican congressional primary. The husband, Jeremy Taylor, was not charged and was later elected to the Woodbury County Board of Supervisors. Alito has strong views about marriage Blaming his wife for flying an inappropriate flag is not the only reason Alito is connected to a wider discussion of the institution of marriage. He continues to complain about the Supreme Court\u2019s 2015 decision that granted the right of marriage to same-sex couples. He grouses that the court\u2019s blessing of same-sex unions means people who think marriage should be between a man and a woman can be labeled by the government as \u201cbigots.\u201d This story has been updated with additional information.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/18/politics/politicians-blaming-wives-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/01/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_29_politics_donald-trump-judgment-day-analysis", "text": "Donald Trump, who built a mystique as the brash epitome of power, has never been more powerless to dictate his own fate. His reputation, future, and even perhaps the White House\u2019s destiny, will on Wednesday be placed in the hands of 12 citizens of his native New York City, proving that not even once-and-possibly future commanders in chief are above the law. Seven men and five women jurors will retire for deliberations on Trump\u2019s six-week hush money trial after Judge Juan Merchan instructs them on the law and their duties. No jury in American history has faced such a task \u2014 deciding whether a former president and presumptive major party nominee will be convicted of a crime. And while the jury, which can deliberate for as long as it needs, is bound to decide its verdict on 34 felony charges on the testimony and evidence in the case alone, its decision will reverberate across the nation and the world at a critical moment of the 2024 presidential election. The trial slogged toward its end on Tuesday in nearly 10 hours of closing arguments that burst into open hostility between rival lawyers. \u201cYou have to put aside the distractions, the press, the politics, the noise. Focus on the evidence and the logical inference that can be drawn from that evidence,\u201d prosecution lawyer Joshua Steinglass told the jury. \u201cIn the interest of justice and in the name of the people of the state of the New York, I ask you to find the defendant guilty. Thank you.\u201d Prosecutors accused the ex-president of \u201ca conspiracy and a cover-up\u201d and of betraying 2016 voters by illegally falsifying financial records to hide a hush money payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels before the election. Trump denies having an affair with Daniels and has pleaded not guilty in this first of four looming criminal cases\u00a0\u2014 which may be the only one to go to trial before November\u2019s election. In order to convict Trump, jurors must first decide that he falsified financial documents and did so with the express purpose of committing another crime. The ex-president watched quietly but intently in court Tuesday after days of firing off furious rhetorical assaults on the judge, prosecutors and the legal system. His lead defense counsel, Todd Blanche, tried to eviscerate the credibility of the case\u2019s central witness, Michael Cohen, branding the self-described former Trump \u201cthug\u201d as the \u201cGLOAT\u201d \u2014 \u201cthe Greatest Liar of All Time,\u201d while insisting there was no crime and no proof Trump orchestrated the plan to pay off Daniels. And conjuring a dark image that seemed to capture his client\u2019s cynical view of democracy, Blanche said: \u201cEvery campaign in this country is a conspiracy to promote a candidate, a group of people who are working together to help somebody win.\u201d The former president, who chose not to testify in his own defense, looked on, often with his arm draped across a chair, in the unusual position of having to leave others to speak for him. Trump has now spent six ignominious weeks breathing the stale air of a foreboding tower block of a courthouse that has dispensed justice to some of New York\u2019s most storied murderers, crooks and Mafia dons. The yellowing white-wash, austere furniture and florescent lights that form the soulless abyss of America\u2019s criminal justice system may have been an insult to the eyes of a developer who frequently boasts about the splendor of his buildings and is more at home under the glistening chandeliers and gold-leafed opulence of his multiple residencies. The final stages of any criminal trial reach a somber register as the gravity of the moment for the accused begins to come into view. In this case, which is entwined with a presidential election that will decide the country\u2019s future, the consequences are even more profound. And there\u2019s also a poignant personal dimension. The city where Trump made his name and reshaped the skyline while romping through the tabloid era of the 1980s is about to judge its estranged son. A political circus erupts outside the court Events outside the courtroom highlighted the rising stakes of the eventual verdict just five months from a currently tight election between Trump and President Joe Biden. Hollywood legend Robert De Niro showed up on behalf of the Biden campaign to blast \u201cthe loser Trump,\u201d accompanied by some of the police officers beaten up by the ex-president\u2019s mob in the US Capitol on January 6, 2021. The star of \u201cTaxi Driver\u201d and \u201cRaging Bull\u201d \u2014 a New York City icon in his own right \u2014 got into a quintessential finger-pointing standoff with a heckling bystander spreading misinformation about the assault on the Capitol. Moments later, Trump\u2019s adult sons, Don Jr. and Eric, showed up for their father, who has come perilously close to incurring a jail spell for repeatedly violating a gag order. \u201cWe understand that this is a political persecution. That was evidenced, today by the Biden campaign themselves holding a rally here,\u201d Don Trump Jr. said. \u201cThey bring in Robert De Niro \u2026 but apparently he needs attention because it\u2019s been a while since he\u2019s cranked out a good movie.\u201d The Biden campaign has tried to keep its distance from Trump\u2019s criminal tribulations, partly to avoid accusations like those from the ex-president\u2019s camp on Tuesday. But its decision to engage as the presumptive GOP nominee\u2019s trial reached a pivotal point began to answer the question of how Biden\u2019s team will react to the end of the trial \u2014 and Trump\u2019s emergence from weeks of the campaign trail being diverted through the courtroom. Despite the circus unfolding outside the court, there is no sign that the trial has gripped the national imagination like previous celebrity cases \u2014 such as the O.J. Simpson saga or the trial of the late King of Pop Michael Jackson. That\u2019s partly to do with the lack of television cameras in Merchan\u2019s courtroom. Some polls have, however, suggested that a guilty verdict could give some Republican voters pause about choosing a convicted felon in November, despite the way Trump weaponized his legal woes as an asset in the GOP primary and his strategy of portraying himself as a persecuted victim in the general election. In a close White House race, only a few thousand defections from the former president could have an outsize effect since the result is likely to be decided in only a handful of swing states by tens of thousands of votes. If Trump is convicted, he\u2019s sure to lash out and redouble his vow to dedicate any second presidency to personal and political \u201cretribution\u201d in a way that could play into Biden\u2019s dominant campaign theme that US democracy is in mortal peril. An acquittal, on the other hand, could validate for Trump\u2019s supporters his claims that all his legal woes are a witch-hunt. The defense rounds yet again on Michael Cohen Trump bitterly complained on Tuesday that the defense got the right to deliver the first summation, meaning that the prosecution argument could be freshest in the jurors\u2019 minds when they come to deliberate. But he didn\u2019t mention that is how the law works in New York state. On one of the most critical days of Trump\u2019s life, Blanche set out about methodically dismantling the prosecution case, seeking to cast reasonable doubt on multiple examples of testimony and evidence. To begin, as Blanche spoke calmly and conversationally, there were none of the often self-defeating histrionics that the ex-president sometimes demands of his lawyers. All Blanche had to do was to cast doubt in the mind of one juror, which could force the judge to declare a mistrial if the jury cannot reach a unanimous verdict. \u201cWe have no burden to prove anything,\u201d Blanche told the jury. \u201cThe burden is always on the government.\u201d Blanche insisted that Cohen did considerable legal work for Trump as his private attorney, countering prosecution arguments that payments made to him once Trump became president were disguised reimbursements for the $130,000 that Cohen paid to Daniels. He told jurors that there was no proof that Trump orchestrated a scheme to subvert the 2016 election or that he even knew what staffers were doing in his name. The attorney returned time and time again to the credibility of Cohen, the most important prosecution witness, portraying him as a serial liar who was caught \u201cred handed\u201d not telling the truth on the stand and who was making millions of dollars on the back of Trump\u2019s legal storm. \u201cYou cannot convict President Trump,\u201d Blanche said, before repeating himself for emphasis while impressing on the jury the gravity of the historic deliberation that lies before them. \u201cYou cannot convict President Trump of any crime beyond a reasonable doubt based on the words of Michael Cohen.\u201d At the end of his summation, Blanche listed 10 reasons why jurors should have reasonable doubt \u2014 including that there was no intent to falsify documents on Trump\u2019s part and no evidence of an orchestrated attempt to meddle in the 2016 election, while arguing that Trump\u2019s intent was to keep stories about Daniels from embarrassing his family. Blanche kept his Trumpiest flourish for his last moments with the jury \u2014 pleading with them not to send the ex-president to prison, in an infringement of legal etiquette and incurring the fury of Merchan. After the jurors returned from a break, the judge warned that their job was to judge the evidence, not to speculate on what punishments Trump might face if he is found guilty. Prosecution expands its case on election interference Steinglass opened his final argument with a long rebuttal of Blanche\u2019s summation, as he sought to show that Cohen\u2019s credibility was not a deal breaker and that in any case the charges were carried by other testimony. Steinglass repeatedly billed the alleged crime not as a seedy attempt to hide a personal transgression but a threat to the integrity of the electoral system. \u201cYou may say, who cares if Mr. Trump slept with a porn star 10 years before the 2016 election? Many people feel that way. It\u2019s harder to say the American people don\u2019t have the right to decide for themselves whether they care or not,\u201d he said. Some observers have suggested that the extraordinary precedent of indicting and trying an ex-president should stem from an alleged offense that threatens the integrity of the republic itself. Trump\u2019s other looming trials \u2014 including over the attempt to subvert the 2020 election and his alleged mishandling of classified documents \u2014 might come closer to reaching this bar. But Steinglass dismissed the notion that the current case is relatively trivial. He said the value of the \u201ccorrupt bargain\u201d involved \u201ccannot be overstated.\u201d He continued: \u201cIt turned out to be one of the most valuable contributions anyone ever made to the Trump campaign,\u201d adding that \u201cthis scheme cooked up by these men at this time could very well be what got President Trump elected.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/29/politics/donald-trump-judgment-day-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/01/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_30_politics_fact-check-trump-false-claims-trial", "text": "Former President Donald Trump has uttered multiple false or misleading claims about his Manhattan criminal trial this week as the trial has neared a conclusion. Here is a fact check of some of the statements Trump has made on social media and to reporters from Tuesday to Thursday morning. Merchan and the \u2018advice of counsel\u2019  After\u00a0closing arguments Tuesday, Trump\u00a0posted on social media to repeat his misleading complaint that Judge Juan Merchan has prevented him from employing a certain defense. Trump\u00a0wrote\u00a0on his platform Truth Social: \u201cTHE GREATEST CASE I\u2019VE EVER SEEN FOR RELIANCE ON COUNSEL, AND JUDGE MERCHAN WILL NOT, FOR WHATEVER REASON, LET ME USE THAT AS A DEFENSE IN THIS RIGGED TRIAL. ANOTHER TERM, ADVICE OF COUNSEL DEFENSE!\u201d\u00a0He added in another post on Wednesday morning: \u201cRELIANCE ON COUNSEL (ADVISE OF COUNSEL) NOT ALLOWED BY MERCHAN, A FIRST.\u201d Facts First:\u00a0Trump\u2019s claim\u00a0remains\u00a0misleading. He didn\u2019t mention,\u00a0again, that\u00a0the reason Merchan will not allow Trump\u2019s legal team to invoke \u201cadvice of counsel\u201d during the trial is that, when Trump was asked before the trial whether he would be using an \u201cadvice of counsel\u201d defense,\u00a0his lawyers\u00a0told Merchan he would not. An \u201cadvice of counsel\u201d defense\u00a0typically requires\u00a0the defendant to waive attorney-client privilege. Trump\u2019s lawyers told Merchan before the trial that instead of a \u201cformal\u201d defense of \u201cadvice of counsel,\u201d Trump wanted to use a different defense in which he would not waive attorney-client privilege but\u00a0would\u00a0still\u00a0\u201celicit evidence concerning the presence, involvement and advice of lawyers in relevant events giving rise to the charges in the Indictment.\u201d Merchan rejected this proposal. He\u00a0wrote in March:\u00a0\u201cTo allow said defense in this matter would effectively permit Defendant to invoke the very defense he has declared he will not rely upon, without the concomitant obligations that come with it. The result would undoubtedly be to confuse and mislead the jury. This Court can not endorse such a tactic.\u201d\u00a0Therefore,\u00a0Merchan ruled, Trump could not invoke or even suggest a \u201cpresence of counsel\u201d defense in the trial. Last week, during courtroom discussions about Merchan\u2019s instructions to the jury, Merchan\u00a0rejected\u00a0an attempt by Trump\u2019s defense to invoke the\u00a0\u201cinvolvement of counsel.\u201d Merchan noted he had already made his stance on the proposal clear. Merchan said: \u201cThis is an argument that you\u2019ve been advancing for many, many, many, months. This is something you\u2019ve been trying to get through to the jury for many, many, many months. It\u2019s denied, it\u2019s not going to happen, please don\u2019t raise it again.\u201d Merchan and jury unanimity Trump claimed Wednesday that Merchan \u201cis not requiring a unanimous decision on the fake charges against me.\u201d Trump made the claim in a\u00a0social media post\u00a0in which he described Merchan\u2019s supposed position as \u201cRIDICULOUS, UNCONSTITUTIONAL, AND UNAMERICAN.\u201d He was echoing assertions that had been\u00a0circulating among conservatives\u00a0after Fox News anchor John Roberts\u00a0wrote\u00a0on social media earlier on Wednesday that \u201cJudge Merchan just told the jury that they do not need unanimity to convict.\u201d Facts First:\u00a0Trump\u2019s claim inaccurately depicts what Merchan said.  Merchan\u00a0told the jury in his instructions on Wednesday\u00a0that their verdict \u201cmust be unanimous\u201d on each of the 34 counts that Trump faces and that, to convict Trump of felony falsification of business records, they have to unanimously agree that he falsified business records with the intent to commit, aid or conceal another crime \u2013 that other crime being a violation of a New York election law. But Merchan explained that while\u00a0this New York election law\u00a0prohibits people from conspiring to use \u201cunlawful means\u201d to promote a candidate\u2019s election, jurors don\u2019t have to unanimously agree on which particular \u201cunlawful means\u201d Trump may have used; they can find him guilty as long as they unanimously agree that Trump used some unlawful means.\u00a0Prosecutors provided three theories of what unlawful means Trump used. Merchan told the jury: \u201cAlthough you must conclude unanimously that the defendant conspired to promote or prevent the election of any person to a public office by unlawful means, you need not be unanimous as to what those unlawful means were. In determining whether the defendant conspired to promote or prevent the election of any person to a public office by unlawful means, you may consider the following: one, violations of the Federal Election Campaign Act otherwise known as FECA; two, the falsification of other business records; or three, violation of tax laws.\u201d Lee Kovarsky, a University of Texas law professor who has been following the trial,\u00a0put it this way\u00a0on social media on Wednesday: \u201cIf a law says NO VEHICLES IN THE PARK & list of vehicles includes mopeds and motorcycles, all the instruction means is that you need unanimous conclusion of vehicle but not unanimous on whether vehicle was moped or harley.\u201d - CNN\u2019s Jeremy Herb contributed to this item. The charges against Trump  After Merchan recited his instructions to the jury on Wednesday, Trump wrote on social media: \u201cI DON\u2019T EVEN KNOW WHAT THE CHARGES ARE IN THIS RIGGED CASE\u2014I AM ENTITLED TO SPECIFICITY JUST LIKE ANYONE ELSE.THERE IS NO CRIME!\u201d Facts First: This needs context. Less than two hours before Trump made this post claiming he doesn\u2019t even know what the charges are, Merchan had explained each of the 34 charges during his jury instructions\u00a0in the courtroom \u2013 with Trump present.\u00a0 We can\u2019t definitively fact-check what Trump actually knows about the charges, and even some legal analysts have said this case can be a difficult one to understand.\u00a0But there is no basis for any suggestion that the charges have not been specified. Merchan had told the jury, \u201cI will now instruct you on the law applicable to the charged offenses. That offense is Falsifying Business Records in the First Degree \u2013 34 Counts.\u201d He then explained how the crime of first-degree falsifying business records is defined in New York law, further explained the definitions of particular words in that law, and then, one by one, identified each of the 34 business records that make up the 34 counts. The 34 counts were also specified in Trump\u2019s indictment in the case\u00a0more than a year ago. The judge and a possible witness  Trump claimed to reporters on Wednesday that Merchan had refused to allow Trump\u2019s defense to call a leading election-law expert to testify. \u201cThis judge didn\u2019t even let us use the number-one election attorney,\u201d Trump said. He continued moments later, \u201cWe had the leading election expert in the country, Brad Smith, ready to testify. Wouldn\u2019t let him do it.\u201d Facts First: Trump\u2019s claim is false. Merchan did not prohibit this potential witness, former\u00a0Federal Election Commission\u00a0chairman Bradley Smith, from testifying. Rather, Merchan\u00a0limited what Smith was allowed to testify about. He decided in March that Smith could provide background information about the FEC and define certain terms relevant to this case but could not opine on whether Trump broke federal election laws or offer opinions about how to interpret or apply those laws. After Merchan refused last week to change his mind, Trump\u2019s defense decided not to call Smith as a witness.\u00a0 Smith wrote on social media last week: \u201cJudge Merchan has so restricted my testimony that defense has decided not to call me.\u201d Trump could argue that Merchan\u2019s decision to restrict Smith\u2019s testimony rendered Smith useless as a witness. But his assertion that Merchan flat-out banned Smith from testifying is not true. Biden and the case After the jury began deliberations on Wednesday, Trump spoke repeated his frequent claim that this case was \u201call done by Joe Biden.\u201d And on Thursday morning, he claimed that Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg had revived the case during Trump\u2019s campaign \u201cat the request of Biden.\u201d Facts First:\u00a0There is no basis for Trump\u2019s claim. There is no evidence that Biden had any role in launching or running Bragg\u2019s prosecution\u00a0-\u00a0and Bragg is a locally elected official who does not report to the federal government. The\u00a0indictment\u00a0in the case was approved by a grand jury of ordinary citizens. Trump has\u00a0repeatedly invoked\u00a0a lawyer on Bragg\u2019s team, Matthew Colangelo, while making such claims; Colangelo left the Justice Department in 2022\u00a0to join the district attorney\u2019s office\u00a0as\u00a0senior counsel to Bragg. But there is no evidence that Biden had anything to do with Colangelo\u2019s employment decision. Colangelo and Bragg had been colleagues before Bragg was elected Manhattan district attorney in 2021. Before Colangelo worked at the Justice Department, he and Bragg worked at the same time in the office of New York\u2019s state attorney general, where Colangelo\u00a0investigated Trump\u2019s charity\u00a0and Trump\u2019s financial practices and was\u00a0involved in bringing various lawsuits\u00a0against the Trump administration.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/30/politics/fact-check-trump-false-claims-trial/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/01/2024", "section": "politics"}}

Trump was smiling and laughing with his attorney, Todd Blanche, as they waited for Judge Juan Merchan to announce the jury was heading home for the day. With Trump and prosecutors assembled, Merchan returned to the bench at 4:13 p.m. ET to let the parties know that he planned to send the jury home for the day in about 15 minutes. The judge left the courtroom, and Trump, his lawyers and the prosecutors remained behind to wait for the end of the day. But everything changed when the judge re-entered the courtroom at 4:36 p.m. with a stunning note: The jury had reached a verdict. The jury needed 30 minutes to fill out the forms, leaving Trump and the attorneys sitting in the courtroom until the judge and jury returned. They mostly sat still while waiting, occasionally making small talk amongst themselves. When the judge returned to the bench, he warned the parties and the audience against \u201creactions\u201d or \u201coutbursts of any kind\u201d before the jury entered. The six alternates entered and sat in the first row of the gallery, behind prosecutors. The 12 jurors took their seats in the jury box.\u00a0A clerk prompted the jury foreman with each of the 34 counts. He answered \u201cguilty\u201d 34 times. The attorneys were silent and serious as the verdict was read. Only the sound of feverish typing could be heard from the galley filled with press and several members of the public as the foreman delivered Trump\u2019s fate. Reporters could not initially see Trump\u2019s facial reaction when the first guilty verdict was read \u2013 the courthouse had the video screen off while the foreman read most of the verdict, as the court turned off video whenever jurors were moving. Only toward the end of the verdict reading did the video of the defendant\u2019s table get turned back on, letting the reporters behind Trump in the courtroom and those in the overflow room see the former president. Trump sat stone-faced, with a frown, not visibly reacting to the jury as they finished reading the verdict. The jurors were polled one-by-one to confirm this was their verdict, and Trump turned and craned his neck to the right to look at the jurors. Jurors kept serious faces as they were polled one by one to confirm this was in fact their verdict. They each answered \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cyes it is.\u201d They walked past the defense to exit the courtroom. None of the 12 panelists appeared to look in Trump\u2019s direction on their way out. Trump\u2019s face was red and he was frowning as he walked out of the courtroom. Trump and his son Eric exchanged an emotional handshake as Trump departed, as Eric patted his father on the back and followed behind him with the rest of Trump\u2019s entourage or advisors and lawyers. Steve Witkoff was the only apparent supporting guest aside from Trump\u2019s son in attendance when the verdict was read.

Kennedy Jr. who raised the possibility that voting for the independent presidential candidate would help Donald Trump defeat President Joe Biden previously promoted false claims that the 2020 election was rigged\u00a0and attended \u201cStop the Steal\u201d rallies after the election,\u00a0including\u00a0the rally on January 6, 2021, in Washington, DC, that preceded the deadly riot at the US Capitol. Rita Palma, who has identified herself as the Kennedy campaign\u2019s state director in New York, also\u00a0repeatedly called\u00a0Trump her \u201cfavorite president,\u201d according to tweets along with comments she posted on\u00a0the conservative social media site Parler that have since been made private. According to a KFILE examination of those now-private posts, Palma also posed for a photo at the former Trump International Hotel in Washington, DC, alongside Sidney Powell \u2013 the pro-Trump attorney who pleaded guilty in Georgia\u2019s election subversion case. In February 2021,\u00a0Palma tweeted her support\u00a0for Trump as a presidential candidate in 2024 and even asked whether he could run for a third term in 2028 \u2013 which is not constitutionally allowed as a president can serve only two full terms. \u201c#Trump2024 Can he run in 2028 too?\u201d she tweeted, posting a meme that said she would vote for\u00a0Trump in 2024. In one comment, Palma dismissed suggestions from then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell that Trump was to blame for violence at the Capitol. \u201cActually the fault lies with the rigged election. Genius,\u201d she\u00a0wrote\u00a0the day after the riot. There is no indication Palma went to the Capitol or was violent on January 6, but tweets from that day show her in DC for Trump\u2019s rally. Palma later dismissed that day\u2019s violence as the work of a few attendees. \u201cJan 6 was not a riot. A small group of people were trouble. It was 99.9 peaceful, respectful. I was there,\u201d\u00a0she wrote. CNN reviewed Palma\u2019s now-private tweets on the Internet Archive Wayback Machine, where\u00a0she included the hashtag #BidenCheated 86 times from November 2020 to February 2021. Palma\u2019s promotion and attendance at \u201cStop the Steal\u201d events after the 2020 election reflects a segment of support Kennedy has received from Trump supporters, particularly as a means of helping the former president retake the White House in 2024. One of the\u00a0biggest donors\u00a0to Kennedy\u2019s super PAC, Timothy Mellon, is also a major donor to Trump. And polls have suggested Kennedy could take critical votes away from Biden. CNN\u00a0was first to report\u00a0that Palma told a gathering of New York state Republicans that efforts to put Kennedy on the ballot in New York would help \u201cget rid of Biden,\u201d which she called her \u201cNo. 1 priority.\u201d \u201cThe only way that Trump can even, remote possibility of taking New York is if Bobby is on the ballot. If it\u2019s Trump vs. Biden, Biden wins. Biden wins six days, seven days a week. With Bobby in the mix, anything can happen,\u201d Palma said in a video of the meeting viewed by CNN. \u201cThe only way for him, for Bobby, to shake it up and to get rid of Biden is if he\u2019s on the ballot in every state, including New York,\u201d she continued. The Kennedy campaign has since distanced itself from Palma. Amaryllis Fox,\u00a0Kennedy\u2019s campaign director, said in a statement posted on X that Palma was hired by the campaign as a ballot-access consultant and that she doesn\u2019t shape electoral strategy, adding that Palma\u2019s remarks in a circulated video were made as a private citizen. Palma did not respond to a CNN request for comment\u00a0but on Tuesday afternoon posted to her Facebook page: \u201cWow- look at that news cycle. I guess the MSM doesn\u2019t like little ole me exercising my 1A rights? Hi, CNN!\u201d Tweets dating to November 2020 show Palma repeatedly volunteering to go to and attending numerous pro-Trump rallies and events \u2013\u00a0even tweeting at\u00a0\u201cStop the Steal\u201d organizer Ali Alexander she would go to Georgia for a week as the state was recounting votes. \u201cWe are rooting for you\u00a0@realDonaldTrump\u00a0Bigly. YUGE rooting. Biggest fan club EVER. #WeLoveYou\u00a0#BestPresidentEver45\u00a0\u00a0#FourMoreYears,\u201d she wrote on November 19, 2020. Palma also\u00a0repeatedly\u00a0expressed\u00a0an affinity for Powell, one of Trump\u2019s election lawyers who\u00a0promoted\u00a0unhinged conspiracy theories\u00a0about nationwide vote-rigging and who filed meritless lawsuits to overturn the results. \u201cYou were born/ chosen for this fight and you will win, win, win. WE LOVE YOU, TOO!\u201d she\u00a0tweeted at\u00a0Powell. In another\u00a0tweet on December 11, 2020,\u00a0Palma called Powell \u201cMY PERSON OF THE DECADE!!\u201d and posted a photo of the pair at the former Trump International Hotel in DC. Last year, Powell\u00a0pleaded guilty\u00a0in the Georgia election subversion case, in which Trump and a host of co-defendants are accused of orchestrating a broad conspiracy aimed at overturning Biden\u2019s 2020 electoral win in the state. It appears that Palma was in DC to attend the \u201cMillion MAGA March\u201d on December 12, 2020, as she\u00a0posted\u00a0photos on Twitter driving to the rally and posted on the day of the rally. \u201c#MAGAMillionMarch\u00a0 #MAGA #TrumpWon #BidenCheated #46DoesNotExist,\u201d\u00a0she wrote.

{"id": "2024_05_30_sport_negro-league-stats-mlb-record-books-intl-spt", "text": "Have you ever heard something on the news and responded by saying \u201cit\u2019s about darn time?\u201d That\u2019s how I felt when I heard about the integration of Negro League Baseball (NLB) statistics from 1920-1948 into Major League Baseball\u2019s (MLB) record books. This move doesn\u2019t somehow \u201cerase the years of injustice,\u201d as the documentary \u201cWhen It Was A Game\u201d put it. Rather, including NLB statistics in the MLB ones \u201cserve[s] to remind us of what we missed\u201d by having racially segregated leagues. Indeed, as elite sportswriter Neil Paine pointed out to me, it\u2019s the stats that show us that the NLB was the equal of, if not superior to, its White counterpart. Consider the statistics of when nine White major leaguers from various teams \u2013 who came together under the banner of \u201call-star\u201d teams \u2013 played against teams of Black major leaguers. The NLB players won 51% of the time from 1900 to 1948. This isn\u2019t some statistical fluke, either. We have 180 documented games during this stretch, which is the equivalent of over one season of major league games (162 currently) or more than 25 World Series taken to the maximum of seven games. As Negro League historian Todd Peterson noted when he made his case a few years ago, the Negro Leaguers were the only ones to consistently beat White major leaguers, who dominated squads of semi-pro, college and minor leaguers. The games between White MLB stars and NLB players left a lasting mark on Hall of Famer Dizzy Dean, who had organized a lot of games between White \u201call-stars\u201d and Negro League players. Dean had great respect for the skills of arguably the Negro League\u2019s best pitcher, Satchel Paige, after Dean\u2019s team of White ball players fell to NLB teams on numerous occasions. While players like Paige eventually did join an integrated MLB, he was well past his prime. Fortunately, we got to see other NLB players join an integrated MLB a short time into their careers. Willie Mays was the best player of the second half of the 20th century, according to the all-encompassing stat wins above replacement (WAR); Mays was a member of NLB\u2019s Birmingham Black Barons in 1948. Henry \u201cHank\u201d Aaron was the second-best player, according to WAR, of the second half of the 20th century. The 20th century home run king was a member of the NLB\u2019s Indianapolis Clowns in 1952, after the period where NLB teams were considered major league for stat counting purposes. High-level players and deserved accolades It\u2019s depressing to imagine a world where Mays or Aaron didn\u2019t play in the integrated major leagues, which is true for Black players overall. They quickly became an integral part of the American and National Leagues in the late 1940s, 50s, 60s and 70s. Black players were on average the best players, which adds to the case that the NLB was a major league. Former NLB players who joined the integrated MLB got on base more frequently (.361) than the average (.324). They hit for more power too with a higher slugging percentage (.455) than the average (.380). The same dominance of former NLB players held true for pitching in the integrated MLB. They won more games (55%) than the average major leaguer (50%), gave up fewer runs (with an ERA of 3.76 vs. 3.91) and struck out more players per nine innings (5.91 vs. 4.89). It\u2019s not surprising that the second former NLB player to win Rookie of the Year in the integrated major leagues was pitcher Don Newcombe. In fact, former NLB players won the National League Rookie of the Year every year from 1949 to 1953. The first MLB player to win Rookie of the Year in the integrated league was Jackie Robinson. Sometimes lost in all of the deserved accolades of Robinson\u2019s breaking the color barrier in 1947 was just how good he was as a player in the integrated league. He put together seven of the best seasons ever for a guy who primarily played second base, according to WAR. Robinson did this while not playing a single integrated MLB game until he was 28, when many players\u2019 skills are already declining. Players like Robinson and Larry Doby \u2013 the first American League Black player and Hall of Famer \u2013 were able to perform at a high level, despite having to put up with a lot of racist rhetoric from fans and fellow players. Sadly, some NLB stars never got to play in an integrated MLB: catcher Josh Gibson was one of them. He died before Robinson ever took the field for the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1947. With Wednesday\u2019s news, Gibson\u2019s now credited with being the all-time baseball leader in batting average at .372 and power hitting (with a slugging percentage of .718). Gibson also leads in on-base-plus-slugging (OBPS) at 1.177, which combines getting on base and hitting for power. Ty Cobb had led the first category, while Babe Ruth led the second and the third. Gibson\u2019s great grandson put it best when he told CNN that \u201cnow, the conversation begins where Josh Gibson ranks as the greatest of all time or one of the greatest of all time.\u201d It\u2019ll be a fun debate to compare the power hitting of Gibson and Ruth. We\u2019ll never know how Ruth would have batted if Black players were part of the American League, or how Gibson would have done in regular season competition against White players. But what\u2019s interesting about the MLB is that it was already combining records for two totally different leagues prior to adding the NLB to the record books. The American League (of which Doby was part of) and National League (of which Robinson was part of) didn\u2019t play regular season games against each other until 1997. Cobb never played against a NL squad in the regular season. Ruth only did for well less than half a season, after he was well past his prime. In fact, if you were to look at the leaderboard for White MLB stats prior to integration, you\u2019ll see many players never played the opposing league in the regular season. NL pitcher Grover Cleveland Alexander never played against the AL. AL pitcher Walter Johnson never played against the NL. A big reason for that is that it was basically impossible for the AL and NL teams to trade players to each other prior to 1959. The leagues were so distinct that they had different presidents just like the NLB. What today\u2019s MLB did in combining the records of the different leagues \u2013 the AL, NL and NLB \u2013 makes sense and has precedent to some degree. When people look at MLB stats now, they\u2019ll get a truer picture of who was good, great or transcendent, regardless of which league they played in.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/30/sport/negro-league-stats-mlb-record-books-intl-spt/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/01/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_30_politics_biden-ukraine-limited-strikes-russia", "text": "President Joe Biden has given permission to Ukraine to strike inside Russian territory with American munitions, though he has restricted their use so Kyiv can only hit targets over the border close to Kharkiv after Russia made significant advances around the city in the northeastern part of the country close to the Russian border, two US officials told CNN on Thursday. \u201cThe president recently directed his team to ensure that Ukraine is able to use US supplied-weapons for counterfire purposes in Kharkiv so Ukraine can hit back at Russian forces hitting them or preparing to hit them,\u201d one of the officials said. The loosening of the restrictions marks a break from long-standing policy and comes amid growing international pressure from close US allies. But it is limited to the area around Kharkiv,\u00a0and Ukraine has not requested permission beyond that, the official said, adding that they do not anticipate the US widening the area allowed. On Friday, Secretary of State Antony Blinken confirmed the decision had been made following a request from Ukraine. \u201cOver the past few weeks, Ukraine came to us and asked for the authorization to use weapons that were provided to defend against this aggression\u201d near Kharkiv, \u201cincluding against Russian forces that are massing on the Russian side of the border,\u201d Blinken said at a news conference in Prague. The top US diplomat said the request went to Biden, and he approved their use for that purpose. When asked if the door was open for the US to allow Ukraine to strike further into Russia, Blinken said the US would continue to \u201cadapt and adjust\u201d moving forward. \u201cWe want to make sure that we\u2019re proceeding deliberately, as well as effectively,\u201d he said. Politico was first to report the news. Kyiv made the request for Washington to change its policy in just the past few weeks as Russian forces have made their advance, the official said. Russian forces, ammunitions depots and logistical hubs can now be targeted with US-provided artillery and rockets across the border from Kharkiv in western Russia. The administration is also standing firm in not allowing Ukraine to use the most formidable munition it has been given to fire into Russia: the long-range missiles known as ATACMS that can hit targets 200 miles, or\u00a0300 kilometers,\u00a0away. Ukraine has been allowed to use US anti-aircraft weapons to take down the imminent threat of Russian aircraft flying in both Ukrainian and Russian airspace and has done so successfully, the first official emphasized. But the prohibition has blocked Ukraine from targeting Russian aircraft that are on the ground inside Russia. Blinken publicly signaled a willingness to change the administration\u2019s tact this week when he noted that the US could \u201cadapt and adjust\u201d its position. A hallmark of US support for Ukraine \u201chas been to adapt as the conditions have changed, battlefields change, as what Russia does has changed in terms of how it is pursuing its aggression escalation, we\u2019ve adapted and\u00a0adjusted too,\u201d\u00a0Blinken\u00a0said on Wednesday on a visit to Moldova. \u201cI am confident we will continue to do that.\u201d The previous day, key European leaders signaled they had shifted position. Speaking at a news conference alongside German Chancellor Olaf\u00a0Scholz on Tuesday, French President Emmanuel Macron outlined that French weapons sent to Ukraine, including long-range missiles, were permitted to target bases inside Russia. \u201cUkrainian soil is being attacked from bases in Russia,\u201d Macron said during a visit to Schloss Meseberg in Brandenburg, Germany. \u201cSo how do we explain to the Ukrainians that we\u2019re going to have to protect these towns and basically everything we\u2019re seeing around Kharkiv at the moment, if we tell them you are not allowed to hit the point from which the missiles are fired?\u201d \u201cWe think that we should allow them to neutralize the military sites from which the missiles are fired and, basically, the military sites from which Ukraine is attacked,\u201d Macron continued. Germany\u2019s Scholz echoed Macron\u2019s comments and said that Ukraine was allowed to defend itself as long as it respected the conditions given by the countries that supplied the weapons \u2013 including the United States \u2013 and international law. The initial limits preventing Ukraine from firing into Russian territory with US weaponry were rooted in the Biden administration\u2019s concerns about the war escalating. While those concerns remain, the US moved to change position after the Ukrainian government explicitly cited the need to defend Kharkiv, European allies began changing tack and NATO leadership quietly urged the US to allow such strikes. Blinken visited Ukraine earlier this month and heard firsthand the Ukrainian request to go after targets inside Russia\u2019s border. On that trip Blinken reiterated that the US would make\u00a0sure to put Ukraine in a \u201cposition where it can deter and defend against future attacks.\u201d \u201cThe US is feeling the weight of the argument,\u201d said one European diplomat earlier this week, expecting that a change in US policy might be coming. In fact, the wheels were already in motion for Biden to amend the US policy when Blinken returned to Washington two weeks ago. According to US officials, the\u00a0secretary of state\u00a0signed on to a recommendation that had been made to Biden by\u00a0national security adviser\u00a0Jake Sullivan, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and\u00a0Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff\u00a0C.Q. Brown\u00a0in the days after\u00a0Russia launched its offensive on May 10. On a May 13 secure video conference, the trio had heard appeals from their Ukrainian counterparts and determined that it made sense to lift the US restrictions so Ukrainian forces could hit the staging areas from which Russia was launching its attacks on Kharkiv. The head of US European Command,\u00a0Gen.\u00a0Christopher Cavoli, was brought into the conversation to help finalize the details. But it would take until Thursday for the US decision to work its way through the system and go into effect. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg was also quietly urging the US and other nations to give Ukraine the capabilities it needs to go after targets inside Russia,\u00a0sources said. Stoltenberg\u2019s repeated efforts behind closed doors did not immediately result in a US policy change. But he made a point this week to publicly speak to the benefit \u2013 and perhaps necessity \u2013 of allowing Ukraine the defend itself without limits. \u201cTo deny Ukraine the possibility of using these weapons against legitimate military targets on Russian territory makes it very hard for them to defend themselves,\u201d Mr. Stoltenberg said last week.

CNN reported in March\u00a0that Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer approached Manchin about running for reelection as an independent. \u201cI think that\u2019s a long, long, long-shot scenario,\u201d Manchin said at the time. \u201cSo I don\u2019t anticipate that happening. I don\u2019t anticipate running.\u201d But when asked if that meant the door was completely closed, he did not rule it out, saying at the time, \u201cI don\u2019t know if anything in Washington, DC, is 100%.\u201d A Manchin spokesperson told CNN that he\u00a0will continue to caucus with Democrats in the Senate. There are several senators who are registered as independents who caucus with Senate Democrats, including Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Angus King of Maine and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona.

{"id": "2024_05_30_politics_donald-trump-hush-money-trial-verdict", "text": "A Manhattan jury found Donald Trump guilty of all 34 charges\u00a0of falsifying business records Thursday, an unprecedented and historic verdict that makes Trump the first former president in American history to be convicted of a felony. Not only is Trump the first former president to be found guilty of a felony, he\u2019s also the first major-party presidential nominee to be convicted of a crime in the midst of a campaign for the White House.\u00a0And if he defeats President Joe Biden in November, he will be the first sitting president in history to be a convicted felon. The verdict in the hush money trial was announced after jurors deliberated for nearly 12 hours over two days. It will ultimately be up to voters in November to decide the significance of the guilty verdict delivered by 12 ordinary New Yorkers, which, on a legal basis, does not prevent him from being elected president again. \u201cThis was a rigged, disgraceful trial. The real verdict is going to be November 5, by the people, and they know what happened here and everybody knows what happened here,\u201d Trump said after leaving the courtroom, slamming the presiding judge and the prosecutor who brought the case. \u201cWe didn\u2019t do anything wrong. I\u2019m a very innocent man,\u201d he said as he vowed to continue fighting. Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, a Democrat, announced charges against Trump last year and presenting the first indictment of a former president, accusing him of falsifying the repayment of his former lawyer Michael Cohen in order to cover up a $130,000 payment Cohen made to adult film star Stormy Daniels to keep her from speaking out about an alleged affair with Trump before the 2016 election. (Trump has denied the affair.) At a news conference Thursday evening, Bragg acknowledged the historic nature of the case and the conviction. While Trump is a defendant \u201cunlike any other in American history,\u201d the district attorney said the verdict was arrived at \u201cin the same manner as every other case that comes through the courtroom doors\u201d \u2013 \u201cby following the facts and the law and doing so without fear or favor.\u201d \u201cThe 12 everyday jurors vowed to make a decision based on the evidence and the law, and the evidence and the law alone. Their deliberations led them to a unanimous conclusion beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant Donald J. Trump is guilty of 34 counts of falsifying business records in the first degree, to conceal a scheme to corrupt the 2016 election,\u201d he said. Throughout the seven-week trial, the district attorney\u2019s office brought in 20 witnesses to illustrate to jurors how the hush-money payment to Daniels was part of a pattern of payoffs to keep negative stories about Trump out of view before the election, and how Trump was concerned about the impact to the campaign when the payment was made in October 2016. Cohen was the prosecution\u2019s key witness, describing how Trump directed him to pay Daniels and then approved the scheme to repay him in $35,000 monthly installments in 2017, an amount that was \u201cgrossed up\u201d in part to account for taxes Cohen would have to pay. Judge Juan Merchan set Trump\u2019s sentencing date for July 11, 2024, at 10 a.m, just days before the start of the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee. Todd Blanche, the former president\u2019s attorney, told CNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins on \u201cThe Source\u201d that they will \u201cvigorously fight\u201d in post-trial motions due to Merchan in a few weeks. \u201cIf that is not successful,\u201d Blanche said they would appeal following the sentencing. Moments after Trump was found guilty, Biden said the only way to defeat his GOP rival is at the ballot box, with his campaign stressing the stakes of the 2024 election. \u201cThere\u2019s only one way to keep Donald\u00a0Trump\u00a0out of the Oval Office: At the ballot box,\u201d\u00a0Biden\u00a0wrote\u00a0on X, linking to a fundraising page. His campaign said in a statement that the verdict showed \u201cno one is above the law.\u201d \u201cThe threat Trump poses to our democracy has never been greater,\u201d Michael Tyler, Biden 2024 campaign communications director, said. \u201cA second Trump term means chaos, ripping away Americans\u2019 freedoms and fomenting political violence \u2014 and the American people will reject it this November.\u201d Trump\u2019s campaign also moved quickly to fundraise off the verdict, casting the case as a \u201cpolitical Witch Hunt trial,\u201d a sentiment the former president\u2019s allies echoed as they rushed to his defense Thursday. \u201cToday is a shameful day in American history,\u201d House Speaker Mike Johnson said on X, calling the case \u201ca purely political exercise, not a legal one.\u201d This story has been updated with additional developments.

{"id": "2024_05_30_politics_irs-direct-file-free", "text": "The Internal Revenue Service said Thursday that it will continue and expand its free tax filing program in 2025. A pilot version of the online program, known as Direct File, launched earlier this year. It provides step-by-step guidance to taxpayers filing their federal tax returns. Direct File was available to people with certain simple tax returns in 12 states during the 2024 tax filing season. More than 140,000 people successfully filed their federal tax returns using Direct File, exceeding the agency\u2019s expectations. Next year, the IRS plans to allow some taxpayers in all states and Washington, DC, to use the program, though not all states may choose to participate. The Biden administration is touting the pilot program \u2013 which was funded by the Democrat-backed Inflation Reduction Act \u2013 as a win. The legislation, which passed in 2022, provided the IRS with a massive, 10-year investment meant to modernize taxpayer services and crack down on wealthy tax cheats. Republicans, concerned that small businesses and the middle class could be targeted by IRS auditors, have made several\u00a0efforts to chip away at the agency\u2019s funding. \u201cPresident Biden is committed to saving Americans time and money and ensuring families receive the tax benefits they\u2019re owed,\u201d Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said on a call with reporters Thursday. \u201cAfter a successful pilot, we are making Direct File permanent and inviting all 50 states to offer this free filing option to their residents,\u201d she said. The pilot program has cost nearly $32 million so far. About $75 million has been budgeted for Direct File during fiscal year 2025, though the cost will depend on how many people ultimately use the program. The IRS said it plans to gradually increase the number of taxpayers eligible to use Direct File over the coming years so that it can ultimately support most common tax situations. A government survey found that 90% of Direct File users said their experience with the tax filing system was \u201cexcellent\u201d or \u201cabove average.\u201d Nearly half of the survey respondents had paid to file their federal tax returns the previous year. How Direct File works Before starting to file a tax return, Direct File prompts taxpayers to answer screening questions that will determine if they are eligible. During the 2024 tax filing season, eligibility was limited to people with simple tax returns. For example, taxpayers with income from an employer reported on a W-2 may have been eligible \u2013 but not if they had other types of income, such as from a side gig or a business. The IRS plans to expand the capability of Direct File next year so that more people with different kinds of tax situations are eligible. But there is no income threshold \u2013 unlike the existing\u00a0Free File Program, which is currently only available to taxpayers who earn $79,000\u00a0or less. That program is provided by an alliance of\u00a0eight different private companies and has historically had\u00a0a low usage rate. Before using Direct File, taxpayers must create an account and verify their identity using\u00a0Id.Me, a digital identity network already used by other federal government programs. The IRS also offers a live-chat function that connects taxpayers with a customer service representative. Direct File does not prepare state tax returns. But taxpayers who are required to file a state return are directed to their state filing system after completing their federal return. IRS Commissioner Danny Werfel said Thursday that Direct File will serve as an option for taxpayers and will not be mandatory. Major overhaul at the IRS Direct File is just one of the many changes happening at the IRS after it received the new funding, totaling $80 billion over a decade, from the Inflation Reduction Act. With the funding, the IRS has improved phone service, put a plan in motion to\u00a0digitize all paper-filed tax returns and made improvements to the online tool known as \u201cWhere\u2019s My Refund?\u201d so that taxpayers can get more real-time information about the status of their tax returns. The agency also has collected millions of dollars in back taxes by cracking down on millionaires who\u00a0haven\u2019t paid what they owe. Now, the IRS is focused on ramping up audit rates of wealthy taxpayers and large corporations. It expects the audit rate of taxpayers earning more than $10 million to increase by 50%, going up from 11% in 2019 to 16.5% in 2026. Werfel has repeatedly said the agency is committed to shielding American households that earn less than $400,000 a year from an increase in audit rates. Specifically, audit rates of those Americans will not exceed what they were in 2018, a record-low year.

{"id": "2024_05_31_politics_voters-trump-conviction-2024", "text": "Some things take time to sink in. But don\u2019t expect committed Donald Trump voters to suddenly waver because their candidate is now a convicted felon. \u201cJust an abuse of the justice system,\u201d Billy Pierce, a semi-retired consultant and Trump backer in\u00a0Hartsville, South Carolina, said shortly after the former president was found guilty on all 34 counts of falsifying business records in his Manhattan hush money trial. \u201cBiden and Democrats can\u2019t win the 2024 election in the polls, so they use prosecution of Trump to try to keep him out of office. This verdict will not hold up through appeals,\u201d he added, repeating Trump\u2019s false claims about President Joe Biden being behind the New York prosecution. Andrew Konchek, a commercial fisherman and Trump\u00a0supporter\u00a0in New Hampshire, responded to the verdict with sarcastic references to former President Bill Clinton\u2019s personal\u00a0scandals. \u201cThere\u2019s no direct evidence and from who, Cohen?\u00a0Who\u2019s a habitual liar and has been disbarred? I smell some bullshit,\u201d he added referring to the prosecution\u2019s star witness, former Trump fixer Michael Cohen. Another Trump backer in New Hampshire, Debbie Katsanos, texted during the jury deliberations. \u201cI see no crime,\u201d she said. \u201cCertainly at a felony level. I am sorry to say I can\u2019t trust the justice system when it\u2019s being used in a political way. \u00a0\u2026 Yes, no one is above the law, when a law is broken they should be held accountable. I\u2019m just not seeing it in this case.\u201d Iowa Trump supporter Chris Mudd, who owns a solar energy business, said his backing of the former president is solid. \u201cI do think the verdict is bad for America,\u201d Mudd said in a text. \u201cCan\u2019t believe this is happening in this country.\u201d Betsy Sarcone was a Nikki Haley voter in the Iowa caucuses and late last year said she would vote Biden if it ended up a Biden-Trump rematch. But she has shifted dramatically since the caucuses. \u201cI\u2019ve been following this sideshow semi closely,\u201d she said after the jury verdict that gave Trump a place in history as the first former president or presumptive party nominee convicted of a felony. \u201cThis does not impact my plans to vote Republican. I don\u2019t even like Donald Trump and this was a witch hunt, made up crimes on the part of the judge and DA. It will never stand on appeal. \u2026 I actually don\u2019t think it will hurt him. People are so sick of the sideshows to distract/avoid/gaslight people away from the real problems in this country.\u00a0To be clear, I\u2019m still not a Trump fan, but it\u2019s pretty clear these cases are being motivated politically.\u201d Pierce, Konchek, Sarcone and Katsanos are all\u00a0participating in a CNN project to follow the 2024 election through the eyes and experiences of voters who live in key battlegrounds or are part of key voting blocs.\u00a0We will check back as news of the historic 34 count conviction sinks in, and as the former president prepares to be sentenced in July \u2013\u00a0days before he is to be officially nominated for president at the Republican National Convention. But our conversations before and during the trial were eye opening: the overwhelming majority of the Trump supporters in our voter groups viewed the cases against the former president \u2014 especially the Manhattan one \u2014 as politically motivated. (The former president pleaded not guilty in this and three other looming criminal cases.) Even many Republicans who are not Trump fans share the view\u00a0that he\u00a0is being unfairly targeted.\u00a0Biden supporters, on the other hand, saw the verdicts as Trump finally being held accountable for what they see as a lifetime of cheating and lying. Matt Vrahiotes, a Christian conservative who runs a fruit winery in\u00a0Hall\u00a0County, Georgia, was troubled by the charges in the Manhattan case: falsifying business records to hide hush money payments to an adult film star, allegedly to help the 2016 Trump campaign. \u201cI mean it sounds crazy, its sounds like an irresponsible person, an irresponsible thing to do,\u201d Vrahiotes said in April. \u201cBut there\u2019s a lot of things going on with both candidates, and a lot of things that are morally in question for both of them, so,\u00a0it\u2019s\u00a0really hard for me to say, oh don\u2019t like one candidate because of what\u2019s going on, versus promoting another. You know, you got to let the trial go through, you\u2019ve got to let the judge decide what\u2019s right and what\u2019s wrong, and\u00a0I\u2019ll\u00a0go from there.\u201d Jan Gardner, a Trump backer who lives in Dunwoody, an Atlanta suburb, said before the verdict that he has lost faith in the justice system. \u201cDo we feel that some of the things that go on, that there\u2019s a double standard?\u201d Gardner asked, mentioning Hillary Clinton, who, in his view, was treated differently than Trump. \u201d I have questions about the \u2026 how much in honesty and how much power can buy you things.\u201d Republican and likely Trump voter Devin McIver\u00a0said he did not closely follow the trial but would not be putting \u201ctime or energy\u201d into thinking about Trump being found guilty, writing in a text that he believes he was \u201cbetter off when Trump was president.\u201d Uneasy about Trump, but not sold on the Manhattan case We hear the unfairness argument a lot in our travels, even from Republicans who are Trump critics. Linda Rooney is a Haley supporter from Media, Pennsylvania, wrestling with whether to cast a reluctant Trump vote or write in the former South Carolina governor or someone else. Rooney has \u201cmixed feelings\u201d about Trump being convicted, telling us she didn\u2019t think the case had \u201cmerit\u201d but saying she\u2019d \u201clove to see him behind bars but for one of the many other things he\u2019s done. Like the White House records case or January 6.\u201d She said she hoped that with\u00a0the conviction, Trump would\u00a0\u201cbow out of the race on his own now and let someone more suitable run \u2014 like Nikki Haley.\u201d But she acquiesced, \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s in Donald Trump to bow out.\u201d Similarly, fellow Pennsylvania voter Irma Fralic, who voted for Haley in the primary, sees politics behind the Manhattan case. \u201cThe current trial in New York, it\u2019s totally political,\u201d Fralic told us last week at her Montgomery County home. \u201cI looked briefly at some of those things, and it just doesn\u2019t hold water.\u201d Former Trump voter Joan London had a mixed take on the convictions. She was a Republican for more than 40 years, switching her registration to independent after casting a vote for Haley in the April Pennsylvania primary. She left the GOP because of Trump. London, an attorney, said she expected a \u201cmore mixed verdict\u201d because \u201cPresident Trump didn\u2019t sign all of the checks that were at issue, and Michael Cohen\u2019s past history of lying and stealing.\u201d Still, London said, \u201cThis verdict has no impact on my voting plans.\u00a0Still no plans to vote for either Trump or Biden.\u201d Celebration and some caution among Biden voters Darrell Ann Murphy offered a reaction typical of the Biden supporters in our voter groups. \u201cWow! A great day,\u201d said Murphy, who lives in Northampton County, Pennsylvania. \u201cFinally he\u2019s found guilty!! Friends texting me like crazy all happy. Lots of Biden voters I talk to.\u201d Pat Levin, another Biden voter in Northampton County, said of the verdict: \u201cIt supports and reinforces I believe in the rule of Law.\u00a0It supports my attitude towards the limits of executive power.\u00a0It reinforces my belief in the tenets of democracy. They have a strong judicial system.\u00a0I am enormously grateful to this jury and its seriousness of purpose.\u201d David Moore is a registered Republican in Nogales, Arizona, but plans to vote for Biden because he cannot support Trump. He responded to the verdict with a question: \u201cCan he still run if he\u2019s in appeals?\u201d Yes, the conviction does not preclude Trump from running. \u201cI\u2019m not counting chickens,\u201d Moore said. \u201cA lot of folks around me seem very happy about it. I\u2019m curious to see how this all goes.\u201d Recent University of Michigan graduate Jade Gray was a co-president of the College Democrats on campus. \u201cFrom the minute he was elected it was historical for all of the wrong reasons,\u201d she said of\u00a0Trump. \u201cBeing the first president who is a convicted solidifies that legacy.\u00a0This is what accountability looks like. I know it\u2019s said a lot, but no one is above the law and Trump has repeatedly shown himself to be a crooked, untrustworthy person.\u201d Nanette Mees, a Republican but Trump critic who lives in suburban Loudon County, Virginia, offered this: \u201cPersonally I am thrilled he was found guilty and pray that there are no big riots because of his followers.\u201d And Joanna Brooks, a Black voter who runs a yoga studio in suburban Milwaukee, described herself as \u201cshocked but happy. \u2026 It\u2019s bizarre to me that this wouldn\u2019t necessarily impact his run for presidency. He will appeal and play victim and his supporters will probably love him all the more.\u201d Deep divide among voters The sharp divide was again evident as more reactions from voters flowed in Friday morning. Trump supporter Rachel Kulak, a Christian conservative who lives in the Richmond, Virginia, suburbs called the verdict \u201cderanged\u201d and part of a justice system she views as warped by Democrats. \u201cBiden\u00a0cannot win in \u201824 so we have weaponization, lawfare against Trump,\u201d Kulak said, comparing the case to political prosecutions in Russia and Venezuela. \u201cTo not be able to trust the legal system according to our own laws, to know that it is not blind but being used to further the agenda of ruining our country, we are in a dangerous place. I do not recognize America for America anymore.\u201d Attorney Priscilla Forsyth of Sioux City, Iowa, was a Haley supporter in the Iowa caucuses but said Trump has her \u201ccomplete support\u201d now. \u201cI am very sad about what this has done to our criminal justice system and very angry that the system I have given 38 years of my life to was perverted into an attempt to destroy a political opponent,\u201d Forsyth said. \u201cI feel it was a travesty of justice and it makes me sick to my stomach.\u201d \u201cNever Trump\u201d Republicans and Democrats, however, voiced gratitude at the convictions. Angela Lang, a community organizer in Milwaukee, said the convictions might help her canvassers when they encounter voters who are considering voting for Trump. \u201cThese are more facts to talk about when we talk to voters,\u201d Lang said. \u201cOne of our\u00a0ambassadors mentioned that we have to make sure people know about this and what this actually means. It\u2019s not just \u2018he slept with a porn star,\u2019 it\u2019s deeper and how it tried to impact the 2016 election.\u201d Zoila Sanchez, a Las Vegas real estate agent who describes herself as a Reagan Republican, said she followed the trial closely. \u201cAlthough I believed he was guilty, I thought he might be acquitted due to his remarkable luck,\u201d Sanchez said. \u201cI am\u00a0pleased\u00a0that our legal system has once again prevailed.\u201d This story has been updated with additional reaction.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/31/politics/voters-trump-conviction-2024/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/01/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_31_politics_colorado-social-media-bill", "text": "The Colorado Legislature\u00a0sent a bill to the governor this week\u00a0that seeks to limit children\u2019s social media use by requiring, among other actions, a pop-up notification that informs young users of when they use a social media platform for an extended period of time. The bill is the latest state effort to regulate social media use amid widening fears that heavy usage is harmful for children. Democratic Gov. Jared Polis, who has previously voiced concerns over state regulation of social media, has not yet indicated whether he will sign the bill, and a spokeswoman said he was reviewing the final version\u00a0sent to him on Tuesday. The bill passed the Democratic-controlled legislature in April by comfortable margins. If\u00a0the bill is signed into law, it would require social media platforms to display a notification to users who are under 18 who have spent an hour on the platform over a 24-hour period, or are active between the hours of 10 p.m. and 6 a.m. The notification would include\u00a0\u201cinformation\u00a0about their engagement in social media that helps the user understand the impact of social media on the developing brain, and the mental and physical health of youth users.\u201d It would repeat at least every 30 minutes after the initial notification. The bill would require the notifications to be in effect starting on January 1, 2026. Democratic state Sen. Lisa Cutter, one of the bill\u2019s sponsors, said the pop-up notifications would be covered under the state\u2019s Consumer Protection Act, and if a company doesn\u2019t comply, the attorney general\u2019s office could slap it with a\u00a0\u201chuge\u00a0penalty\u201d of $20,000 per violation. The bill also calls for the creation and maintenance of \u201ca resource bank of existing evidence-based, research-based scholarly articles and promising program materials and curricula pertaining to the mental and physical health impacts of social media use by youth, internet safety, and cybersecurity.\u201d The \u201cresource bank\u201d would be created by a group of people knowledgeable about the intersection of youth and social media, including kids, parents and educators. The materials would be publicly available beginning on July 1, 2025. Polis has previously voiced concerns about state regulation of social media, telling NBC News\u2019\u00a0\u201cMeet\u00a0the Press\u201d in December that he thinks\u00a0\u201cthe\u00a0responsibility belongs to the parents, not the government.\u201d Democratic state Rep. Judy Amabile, one of the bill\u2019s sponsors, said in March that the bill would give parents and teens resources to make informed decisions about excessive social media usage and the\u00a0\u201cdreaded\u00a0\u2018doom\u00a0scroll.\u2019\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re working to encourage healthier social media habits among our youth by giving them the tools they need to make smart decisions about their own social media usage and prompting our kids to take a break from their phones,\u201d Amabile said. Healthier Colorado, a nonprofit public health organization, conducted research on social media and its impact on youth mental health, which led the group to support the legislation. \u201cThe apps, by design, are very addictive,\u201d Kyle Piccola, Healthier Colorado\u2019s senior director of communications, said. \u201cAnd\u00a0so, we knew that we wanted to get involved somehow, pass something to at least start the conversation on how can we turn this ship around, because we know that teens are suffering from the overuse and the problematic use of social media.\u201d But TechNet, a technology advocacy group that opposes efforts to regulate social media companies, said that although children deserve a heightened level of protection online, it would rather have families, instead of the government, regulate social media usage. TechNet will \u201ccontinue to work with the General Assembly to ensure that future legislation upholds the First Amendment, does not conflict with any other relevant federal law, and avoids burdening lawful speech,\u201d said Ruthie Barko, TechNet\u2019s executive director for Colorado and the Central US. Several other states have proceeded with efforts to regulate kids\u2019 social media use. In March, Florida moved to restrict social media access\u00a0by banning those under the age of 14 from having their own social media accounts and requiring age verification for those who visit sexually explicit websites. States, including Arkansas, California, Louisiana, Ohio and Utah, have also pushed similar bills to regulate tech platforms. Legal challenges have been filed in response to some of those efforts.

{"id": "2024_05_31_politics_kansas-city-chiefs-white-house", "text": "President Joe Biden on Friday congratulated the Kansas City Chiefs on their second Super Bowl victory in two years, joking, \u201cback to back \u2026 I like that.\u201d \u201cWhen the doubters question whether you could pull it off again \u2014\u00a0believe me, I know what that feels like,\u201d the president said, welcoming the team back to the White House. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s doubting you now.\u201d Biden also tried on a Chiefs helmet the team gifted him, prompting cheers from the players and the crowd. After the president wrapped up his remarks, he turned the mic over to tight end Travis Kelce, who recalled last year\u2019s White House visit, during which he jokingly attempted to give a speech at the podium before being ushered away by quarterback Patrick Mahomes. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to see you all yet again. I\u2019m not gonna lie, President Biden, they told me if I came up here I\u2019d get tased, so I\u2019m gonna go back to my spot,\u201d Kelce said Friday. The visit carried an underlying level of tension not often felt at championship celebrations at the White House. It\u2019s been only a few weeks since Chiefs kicker Harrison Butker, who joined the team\u2019s visit to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, criticized Biden, who is Catholic, and other unnamed Catholic leaders for \u201cpushing dangerous gender ideologies onto the youth of America\u201d \u2014 an apparent reference to transgender rights. His commencement address at Benedictine College contained other controversial statements, such as calling Pride Month a \u201cdeadly sin,\u201d bemoaning diversity and equity initiatives, and suggesting women find more fulfillment from getting married and having children than from their careers. \u201cI want to speak directly to you briefly because I think it is you, the women, who have had the most diabolical lies told to you,\u201d Butker, who is also Catholic, said during the speech. Butker\u2019s criticism of Biden and the backlash to his speech led to speculation that the kicker \u2014 who wore a tie with an anti-abortion phrase on it to the White House last year \u2014 would skip this year\u2019s event. Some of Butker\u2019s high-profile teammates have distanced themselves from his opinions even as they say they embrace the three-time Super Bowl champion as a person. Kelce said last week that he doesn\u2019t agree with \u201cjust about any\u201d of Butker said but that the kicker is \u201ca great person and a great teammate.\u201d Mahomes told reporters Butker was a \u201cgood person,\u201d despite \u201cnot necessarily agreeing\u201d with his comments. The NFL has also distanced itself from Butker\u2019s comments, saying through a spokesperson that his views are \u201cnot those of the NFL as an organization.\u201d Butker is not backing down from his comments. Taylor Swift, the global superstar who is dating Kelce, wasn\u2019t expected at the White House on Friday as she continues the Europe leg of her long-running \u201cEras Tour.\u201d Swift\u00a0played a show in Madrid on Thursday night and is traveling on to Lyon, France, this weekend. The White House visit capped a particularly high-profile season for the Chiefs after Swift and Kelce went public with their relationship early in the season. It ended in an accomplishment that hadn\u2019t been done in two decades by an NFL team \u2014 a back-to-back Super Bowl championship, the fourth in Chiefs history and the third in the last five years. The celebrations in Kansas City were tragically brief. On February 14, one person was killed and 20 others were injured in a\u00a0mass shooting\u00a0just moments after the team\u2019s celebratory rally. Two men were charged with murder in the shooting, which started after a confrontation between two groups of people. In his remarks Friday, Biden said that \u201cas a country, we have to do more to stop these tragic shootings before they happen.\u201d Kelce, who had already racked up a storied career that will likely send him to the Hall of Fame when he eventually follows his brother, Jason, into retirement, became a celebrity outside the world of football thanks to his relationship with Swift. While his performance on the field dropped off as compared with his incredible 2022 season, he still played well enough to be rewarded with a contract extension that made him the highest-paid tight end in the league. For Mahomes, the Super Bowl victory over the San Francisco 49ers in Las Vegas cemented the Texas Tech alum as one of the greatest quarterbacks in the game\u2019s history, even though he\u2019s just six years into his career and is not yet 30 years old. He said last year\u2019s visit to the Oval Office was one of the highlights of his career. \u201cI mean, I\u2019ve never been to Washington, DC \u2013 I\u2019ve never even got to see from the outside, seeing the\u00a0White\u00a0House\u00a0or any of the monuments or memorials,\u201d\u00a0Mahomes\u00a0told reporters at the time. \u201cAnd so, to be able to be here and see that, and see the history of this great nation that we have, it was really cool for me to just be here and be in the moment, and I don\u2019t think I could ever really imagine it being as cool as it was.\u201d CNN\u2019s Nikki Carvajal, Donald Judd, AJ Willingham, Piper Hudspeth Blackburn, Matias Grez and Keith Allen contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/31/politics/kansas-city-chiefs-white-house/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/01/2024", "section": "politics"}}

Twelve Americans. Twelve people like you, like millions of Americans who served on juries.\u201d He said Trump\u2019s jury was \u201cchosen the same way every jury in America\u201d and was \u201ca process that Donald Trump\u2019s attorney was part of.\u201d \u201cThe jury heard five weeks of evidence.

{"id": "2024_05_31_politics_rudy-giuliani-election-fraud-disbarment", "text": "Donald Trump\u2019s former lawyer Rudy Giuliani is one step closer to being disbarred. The professional responsibility board in Washington, DC, recommended Friday that the ex-New York mayor and federal prosecutor lose his law license because of his involvement in a bogus 2020 election fraud lawsuit. Giuliani\u2019s law license had already been suspended due to his work boosting Trump\u2019s false assertions about his electoral loss. It is up to the DC Court of Appeals to decide\u00a0whether\u00a0to permanently disbar\u00a0Giuliani. \u201cWe conclude that disbarment is the only sanction that will protect the public, the courts, and the integrity of the legal profession, and deter other lawyers from launching similarly baseless claims in the pursuit of such wide-ranging yet completely unjustified relief,\u201d the attorney discipline board wrote Friday. The opinion follows a trial-like proceeding held by a hearing committee of the board in late 2022, which weighed the ethics charges brought by the DC Bar\u2019s disciplinary counsel. Giuliani was accused of violating attorney conduct rules with a lawsuit filed in Pennsylvania that sought to throw out more than 1 million votes in the state, which President Joe Biden won in 2022. The disciplinary board on Friday agreed with the committee\u2019s findings that Giuliani had likely broken\u00a0the rules. \u201cWe agree with the Hearing Committee that the Pennsylvania litigation was based \u2018only on speculation, mistrust, and suspicion,\u2019\u201d the opinion said. The board concluded that Giuliani had put forward \u201cno facts to support the claims he made and his opinion that election impropriety occurred does not meet the requirements for filing a lawsuit.\u201d Ted Goodman, Giuliani\u2019s spokesperson, said in a statement the \u201crecommendation comes as no surprise as partisan Democrats continue to destroy the credibility of the American justice system all in an effort to beat President Trump and to hold onto power.\u201d Giuliani is one of several attorneys who face professional misconduct proceedings for aiding Trump\u2019s election reversal schemes. Earlier this week, attorney Jenna Ellis\u00a0saw her Colorado law license\u00a0suspended for three years because of her guilty plea in the criminal 2020 election interference case brought in Georgia. John Eastman, who engineered a plot to disrupt Congress\u2019 certification of the 2020 election results, was found\u00a0by a California Bar court judge to have committed\u00a0\u201cexceptionally serious ethical violations,\u201d\u00a0and his license is suspended while the proceedings over whether he should be disbarred move forward.

{"id": "2024_05_31_politics_biden-middle-east-remarks", "text": "President\u00a0Joe\u00a0Biden asserted Friday that Hamas has been degraded to a point where it can no longer carry out the type of attack that launched the current 8-month conflict in Gaza, laying out a three-phase proposal\u00a0Israel has submitted\u00a0to wind down the grinding crisis as he\u00a0declared, \u201cIt\u2019s time\u00a0for this war to end.\u201d It was perhaps the furthest Biden has gone in telling Israel its stated goals for its operation in Gaza\u00a0have\u00a0been met, and that the time has\u00a0arrived to stop the fighting as part of a hostage deal. \u201cAt this point, Hamas no longer is capable of carrying out another October 7, just one of Israel\u2019s main objectives in this war, and quite frankly a righteous one,\u201d Biden said at the White House. He had just laid out a three-phase Israeli proposal that would pair a release of hostages with a \u201cfull and complete ceasefire,\u201d a plan he said presented the best hope to bring peace to Gaza. \u201cThis is truly a decisive moment,\u201d he said. Biden said the Israeli proposal was transmitted this week. The first phase would\u00a0last six weeks and include\u00a0the \u201cwithdrawal of Israeli forces from all populated areas of Gaza\u201d and\u00a0\u201crelease of a number of hostages including women, the elderly, the wounded in exchange for the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners.\u201d He said\u00a0Phase 2\u00a0would allow for the \u201cexchange for the release of all remaining living hostages, including male soldiers.\u201d \u201cAnd as long as Hamas lives up to its commitments, the temporary ceasefire would become, in the words of the Israeli proposals, \u2018the cessation of hostilities permanently,\u2019\u201d Biden said. In Phase 3, the president said,\u00a0a \u201cmajor reconstruction plan for Gaza would commence and any final remains of hostages who\u2019ve been killed will be returned to their families.\u201d Less than an hour after Biden detailed the Israeli proposal, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin\u00a0Netanyahu\u00a0insisted Israel would not end the war until Hamas is defeated. The Prime Minister\u2019s Office said in a statement that \u201cthe war will not end until all of its goals are achieved.\u201d \u201cThe Israeli government is united in the desire to return our hostages as soon as possible and is working to achieve this goal,\u201d the statement said. \u201cTherefore, the Prime Minister authorized the negotiating team to present an outline for achieving this goal\u00a0while insisting that the war will not end until all of its goals are achieved, including the return of all our hostages and the elimination of Hamas\u2019 military and governmental capabilities. The Prime Minister\u2019s Office insisted that the \u201cexact outline\u201d of Israel\u2019s proposal allows Israel to \u201cmaintain these\u00a0principles.\u201d Shortly after the statement was released it was announced that the top four Congressional leaders have formally invited Netanyahu to address a joint meeting of Congress though no date was specified for it to take place. Hamas released a statement later on Friday saying they viewed the proposal positively. \u201cThe Islamic Resistance Movement Hamas views positively what was included in US President Joe Biden\u2019s speech today,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThe movement affirms its position of readiness to deal positively and constructively with any proposal based on a permanent ceasefire, complete withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, reconstruction, the return of the displaced to all their places of residence, and the completion of a serious prisoner exchange deal if the occupation declares its explicit commitment to that,\u201d it added. Former President Barack Obama, in a rare statement about current events, said the ceasefire proposal is \u201cclear, realistic and just.\u201d \u201cA ceasefire alone won\u2019t ease the terrible pain of Israelis whose loved ones were butchered or abducted by Hamas, or the Palestinians whose families have been shattered by the subsequent war,\u201d Obama said. \u201cIt won\u2019t resolve the longstanding conflict between Israelis and Palestinians, or answer contentious issues surrounding a two-state solution or continuing settler activity in the West Bank. But what it can do is put a stop to the ongoing bloodshed, help families reunite and allow a surge of humanitarian aid to help desperate, hungry people,\u201d he added. \u2018Nearly identical to Hamas\u2019 own proposals\u2019 Israel\u2019s four-and-a-half-page\u00a0hostage-return and\u00a0ceasefire proposal was submitted to Hamas on Thursday evening, a US senior administration official said, and matches closely a deal the group itself recently proposed. \u201cIt\u2019s nearly identical to Hamas\u2019 own proposals of only a few weeks ago. So if that\u2019s what Hamas wants, they can take the deal,\u201d the official said. Indirect talks between Israel and\u00a0Hamas on securing the hostages\u2019 release were paused three weeks ago without a deal after the sides could not come to an agreement on some of the terms. On Thursday, Hamas said it\u00a0had informed mediators that\u00a0it is\u00a0\u201cprepared to reach a comprehensive agreement\u201d that includes a full\u00a0hostage\u00a0and prisoner exchange deal\u00a0if Israel stops its war in Gaza. A statement from the group said while it\u00a0had shown \u201cflexibility and positivity in dealing with the efforts of the mediators throughout all previous rounds of indirect negotiations.\u201d\u00a0Israel,\u00a0Hamas\u00a0said, had used the months of ongoing talks as a cover to continue its war in Gaza. \u201cHamas\u00a0and the Palestinian factions\u00a0will not\u00a0accept being part of this policy of continuous negotiations in the face of aggression, killing, siege, starvation, and genocide of our people,\u201d\u00a0the\u00a0Hamas\u00a0statement said. Netanyahu has repeatedly insisted that the war must continue until\u00a0Hamas\u00a0is completely destroyed. In his speech from the White House, Biden acknowledged internal divisions inside Israel that could prevent a hostage deal from being agreed it. \u201cI know there are those in Israel who will not agree with this plan. And will call for the war to continue indefinitely. Some, some are even in the government coalition,\u201d he said, an unsubtle reference to hardliners in Netanyahu\u2019s government who have resisted efforts to mediate an end to the conflict. \u201cThey made it clear they want to occupy Gaza. They want to keep fighting for years and the hostages are not a priority to them,\u201d Biden said. Though he did not name anyone in his speech, Biden has previously singled out National Security\u00a0Minister\u00a0Itamar Ben-Gvir as among those in Netanyahu\u2019s governing coalition\u00a0who\u00a0are making any progress difficult. Appeal for Israeli public support In his speech, Biden made a direct appeal to ordinary\u00a0Israelis\u00a0to voice their support for a hostage agreement that would result in a ceasefire. \u201cI need your help. Everyone who wants peace now must raise their voices and let the leaders know they should take this deal. Work to make it real, make it lasting, and forge a better future out of the tragic terror attack and war,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s time to begin this new stage. The hostages to come home for Israel to be secure in a suffering to stop.\u201d Biden spoke directly to Americans as well who have\u00a0criticized\u00a0the violence in Gaza, admitting that too many civilians had been killed and calling the situation \u201cone of the hardest, most complicated problems in the world.\u201d \u201cWe all saw the terrible images from a deadly fire in Rafah earlier this week following an Israeli strike \u2026 targeting Hamas,\u201d Biden said, in his first comments since a strike left dozens of civilians dead. \u201cEven as we worked to surge assistance to Gaza \u2026 the humanitarian crisis still remains.\u201d The president, who returned to the White House from his beach home in Delaware earlier in the morning, had avoided commenting on the situation in Israel for several days. Earlier on Friday, Israel\u00a0said its forces have entered central Rafah, the city in southern Gaza that Biden has warned should not be the target of a major ground offensive. The White House called images from the disaster \u201cheartbreaking\u201d but said the incident had not crossed Biden\u2019s red line for withholding some US weapons shipments to Israel. The president\u00a0told CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett\u00a0in an interview this month that he would limit some US arms to Israel if the country\u2019s military \u201cgo into Rafah.\u201d But he has remained vague about how he will quantify such a decision, leading to frustrations and a degree of\u00a0confusion over his stance. Many Democrats, along with foreign leaders who the US counts as allies, say Israel\u2019s actions clearly cross a red line \u2013 if not Biden\u2019s, then their own and those of international law. White House officials have sought this week to explain Biden\u2019s stance, suggesting his barometer for changing policy would be a \u201cmajor ground invasion\u201d of the city.

Officials said the new contract covers wages, time off and severance, among other issues. The unionization effort is affiliated with the Campaign Workers Guild, a non-partisan labor union founded in 2017 to represent workers on campaigns and political committees. \u201cWe are proud of the professional and collaborative process that has resulted in a strong, fair and equitable agreement between the Biden-Harris staff and the Campaign Workers Guild,\u201d read a joint statement between the Guild and Biden\u2019s campaign issued first to CNN. \u201cBoth of our organizations believe standing up for workers\u2019 rights and the dignity of work is paramount, and we hope this process can be a powerful example for how future campaigns and unions can work together to achieve an agreement everyone can be proud of.\u201d The agreement went into effect on May 23, according to an official, and covers nearly 100 campaign workers. The number of unionized staffers is growing by the week as the campaign increases its payrolls ahead of November\u2019s election. Included in the contract are severance\u00a0and a continuation of benefits after the November 5 election, increased time off for workers, monthly child care reimbursement, disciplinary protections, caps on hours worked,\u00a0and health and safety protections. Field organizers on Biden\u2019s previous campaign unionized in May 2020. They worked with Teamsters Local 238 to secure a $15 minimum wage, overtime pay if working more than 40 hours in a week and a six-day work week. Presidential campaign work can be notoriously grueling, with long hours and low pay exchanged for the experience and the career benefit of working in American politics at the highest level. Democratic campaigns and committees have embraced moves by their staff to unionize in recent years as they look to live up to the pro-labor platforms they pitch to voters. It comes as the president has sought to strengthen his union bona fides as he prepares to face off against former President Donald Trump, who is also making a play for union voters heading into November. Trump\u2019s campaign staff is not represented by a union. \u201cPresident Biden pledged to be the most pro-union president ever, and he\u2019s followed through on that promise at every turn \u2013 with today\u2019s important news as just the latest example,\u201d Biden\u2019s campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez said. \u201cJoe Biden has spent his career standing with workers, and just as they did four years ago, he\u2019s proud that his staff has come together and successfully unionized.\u201d Biden has sought to amplify his pro-labor credentials, naming himself the \u201cmost pro-union president in history\u201d and heavily courting powerful unions to endorse his presidential bid.

{"id": "2024_05_29_politics_texas-republican-election-phelan-gonzales", "text": "Texas Rep. Tony Gonzales will win his Republican primary runoff, CNN projects, overcoming a challenge from his right from gun rights advocate and social media personality Brandon Herrera. Tuesday\u2019s race in Texas\u2019 23rd Congressional District, which stretches along the US-Mexico border from El Paso to the San Antonio suburbs, had been among the most expensive and bitter GOP primaries so far in 2024, drawing more than $8 million in television advertising spending. Gonzales was the only member of Texas\u2019 congressional delegation forced into a runoff after he failed to take a majority of the vote during the first round in March. First elected\u00a0in 2020 in what was then a battleground district,\u00a0Gonzales\u00a0was\u00a0censured by the Texas Republican Party last year\u00a0for a \u201clack of fidelity to Republican principles and priorities.\u201d The party took issue with several House votes cast by the congressman, including for\u00a0bipartisan gun safety legislation\u00a0and the\u00a0Respect for Marriage Act, which protected same-sex and interracial marriage. A key division\u00a0between Gonzales and Herrera came\u00a0over gun policy. The district includes Uvalde, which experienced one of the\u00a0worst school shootings in US history\u00a0two years ago that left 19 children and two teachers dead. Gonzales\u2019 vote for the gun safety bill in the aftermath of the tragedy became a centerpiece of Herrera\u2019s campaign, which had the backing of\u00a0several House Republicans, including Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz and Freedom Caucus Chairman Bob Good. The runoff offered a vivid window into the GOP\u2019s intraparty divisions, with hard-right members growing increasingly willing to derail their party\u2019s agenda if there is a whiff of compromise with Democrats. In an\u00a0interview with CNN last week, Gonzales said the primary runoff\u2019s result would send a clear message to Republicans amid a particularly discordant stretch that has seen their\u00a0speaker ousted, parts of their agenda stalled and relations roiled across the conference. \u201cAre we going to be the party that governs and gets things done in a conservative manner?\u201d Gonzales said. \u201cOr are we going to be the party that has jesters that come up here and say wild and crazy outrageous things and just try to burn the place down?\u201d Gonzales will next face Democrat Santos Limon, who won his party\u2019s nomination outright in March. The 23rd District is not on Democrats\u2019 target list this fall \u2013 Trump would have carried it under its current lines by 7 points in 2020. Texas House speaker survives Meanwhile, Texas House Speaker Dade Phelan, the Republican who led last year\u2019s failed effort to impeach and remove from office scandal-plagued state Attorney General Ken Paxton, will win the primary runoff for his legislative seat, CNN projects. Phelan led David Covey, a former local county GOP chairman, by 366 votes as of Wednesday morning, with nearly all votes counted. Covey, who had the backing of Paxton and former President Donald Trump, has conceded the race for the Beaumont-area district. A host of influential hard-right figures in the Texas GOP came out against Phelan in the primary. The speaker finished second to Covey in the first round of voting in March, though neither took the majority needed to avoid the runoff. Paxton and Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, who runs the more conservative state Senate, cast Phelan as a speaker selected by Democrats \u2014 because all members of the House are allowed to vote on who oversees the chamber. \u201cAs lieutenant governor, I do not want to run the House, but I want a conservative Republican to be speaker who will run the House,\u201d Patrick said at the biennial Texas GOP convention earlier this month, The Texas Tribune reported. Phelan was the top target in Paxton\u2019s revenge tour against state House Republicans who voted to impeach him last year. The speaker was among eight state House Republicans who were forced into runoffs \u2014 a list that includes both Paxton targets and those criticized by Gov. Greg Abbott for voting against school vouchers. Among the targets was state Rep. Justin Holland, who is projected to lose the primary runoff for his Dallas-area district to Katrina Pierson, Trump\u2019s national spokesperson during his 2016 presidential campaign.

{"id": "2024_05_31_politics_biden-campaign-trump-verdict-strategy", "text": "Well before the Manhattan jury finished deliberating on Thursday, most of President Joe Biden\u2019s advisers concluded that a guilty verdict wouldn\u2019t drastically alter their 2024 election strategy. But it has stoked some hopes among supporters of the president that if 12 people who focused on Trump voted to find him guilty, there might actually be enough undecided voters who, if the Biden campaign can figure out how to get them to focus on Trump, will vote to keep him from returning to the White House. Aides have discussed among themselves whether the Biden campaign would use the term \u201ccriminal\u201d to describe the likely Republican nominee in their messaging, even as they acknowledge the former president\u2019s legal issues are largely baked in and voters care about other issues more. Still, a guilty verdict is a guilty verdict, and 34 of them hardly makes for\u00a0bad news\u00a0for Biden\u2019s campaign\u00a0five months before Election Day. The convictions might not move the needle in a major way in the election, those close to the Biden reelection effort told CNN, but an acquittal could have really helped Trump \u2013\u00a0and that makes Thursday\u2019s historic decision a win for the Biden campaign, if only because it is not a loss. A sense of despondency had started to creep in from top supporters and donors in recent weeks, as more moments that reelection campaign strategists had projected would shift the race \u2013 the beginning of the 2024 calendar year, the end of the Republican primaries,\u00a0the coming of spring when they figured more people would pay attention to Trump\u2019s record\u2014have come and gone without any notable movement in the polls or overall dynamics. So much frustration built inside the Wilmington headquarters that\u00a0on Tuesday \u2013 with attention locked on the Manhattan courtroom \u2013\u00a0they sent out Robert DeNiro to shout at the crowd, and at the reporters. But the conviction on 34 counts has reassured some of their mantra that the more people focus on Trump and the choice ahead of them, the better Biden\u2019s November is going to be \u2013 and to push back on the \u201cnothing matters\u201d sensibility that has helped power Trump through so many other dark moments over his last nine years in politics. A senior administration official leaving the West Wing\u00a0on Thursday evening\u00a0\u2013 asked to respond to the verdict \u2013 raised his eyebrows and said, \u201cIt matters.\u201d\u00a0Campaign aides, meanwhile, have been instructed to remain tight-lipped in response to reporters and on social media. Biden-centric operatives say an acquittal would not just have validated Trump\u2019s claims of being unfairly persecuted, but fed even more fatalism from already deflated Biden supporters who have come to believe nothing can touch Trump. \u201cAn acquittal would have fed into Trump\u2019s view that he\u2019s just constantly under attack and everyone\u2019s out to get him \u2013 but 12 people, a jury of his peers, convicted him,\u201d said one former Biden aide. \u201cI can\u2019t\u00a0get\u00a012 people to agree on what to get for dinner.\u201d And though they expect Trump to get a tsunami of online fundraising over calling himself \u201ca political prisoner\u201d and assumed\u00a0his backers would send a flood\u00a0of statements attacking the verdict and the judge, several said they\u2019re partial to the kind of thinking expressed by anti-Trump Republican pollster Sarah Longwell on X after the verdict: \u201cIt won\u2019t be a public opinion earthquake. But in an election where inches will matter, this just created a new barrier for undecided swing voters: voting for a convicted felon.\u201d Biden\u2019s official reaction to the verdict was almost identical to the newly minted felon and presumptive Republican nominee on one key point. \u201cThere\u2019s only one way to keep Donald Trump out of the Oval Office: At the ballot box,\u201d Biden wrote on social media, linking to a fundraising page. Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin, the Democrat who is chair of the Judiciary Committee, echoed that even as he praised the verdict. \u201cConsistent with the rule of law, a jury of his peers found the former president guilty on all counts,\u201d Durbin said in a statement.\u00a0\u201cNow, it is up to the American people to decide if he is worthy of the seat behind the Resolute desk in the Oval Office.\u201d In substance, if not style, the sentiment matched exactly Trump\u2019s assertion outside the courtroom that the \u201creal verdict is going to be\u00a0November 5\u00a0by the people.\u201d The day that\u00a0ended in a historic guilty verdict for his predecessor\u00a0began at mass for Biden, where a politician who thinks often in terms of fate and Irish poetry was marking the ninth anniversary of the death of his beloved son Beau, whom Biden has said he wanted to be president instead of him. Absorbing the jury\u2019s decision\u00a0hundreds of miles south of the courthouse at his beach home in Delaware,\u00a0and as his aides were transfixed by the news coverage of the verdict in the West Wing where foot traffic slowed to a halt,\u00a0Biden did not alter his evening with family. There were no rushed plans to appear in public, instead\u00a0leaving it to his campaign and White House spokespeople to respond. \u201cConvicted felon or not, Trump will be the Republican nominee for president,\u201d campaign communications director Michael Tyler wrote in a statement. \u201cThe threat Trump poses to our democracy has never been greater.\u201d \u201cWe respect the rule of law, and have no additional comment,\u201d said Ian Sams, a White House counsel\u2019s office spokesman. There remains a possibility Biden could weigh in on Friday, when he\u2019ll return to the White House for a\u00a0closed-door\u00a0meeting with the Belgian prime minister to discuss plans to utilize Russian assets sitting in Western banks to continue funding Ukraine\u2019s defense. Later, Biden is set to welcome the Kansas City Chiefs to the White House to celebrate the team\u2019s second consecutive Super Bowl win in an event that is usually light-hearted. Perhaps of more value, according to some Biden allies, will be the verdict\u2019s loud reminder that Trump is his party\u2019s nominee \u2013 a fact they believe many voters have\u00a0not\u00a0truly internalized. Biden\u2019s campaign, which continues to grapple with the reality of a tuned-out electorate, views any reminder of Trump\u2019s potential return to office as a net positive. Instead of a major campaign shift centered around his rival\u2019s new status as a convicted criminal, Biden is expected to use the coming weeks to advance his warnings about Trump\u2019s threats to democracy, culminating in CNN\u2019s\u00a0June 27\u00a0debate. Two separate trips to Europe, including for the 80th anniversary of D-Day and the Group of 7 summit, will focus thematically on issues of democracy. The White House said Thursday the president would deliver a speech on the \u201cimportance of defending freedom and democracy\u201d at Pointe du Hoc, one of the sites of the\u00a0Allied\u00a0landings in Normandy. With wall-to-wall coverage of the trial now complete, it could be easier for the president\u2019s message to be heard over the noise. \u201cThe risk of the conviction is that there are people who continue to think that there\u2019s something that will prevent Donald Trump from being the nominee or being president,\u201d the former Biden aide said. \u201cThat is not the case. If you don\u2019t want Donald Trump, if you have to vote against him.\u201d CNN\u2019s Kayla Tausche contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/31/politics/biden-campaign-trump-verdict-strategy/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/01/2024", "section": "politics"}}

{"id": "2024_04_10_politics_lara-trump-rnc-2020-election-fraud-claims", "text": "The Republican National Committee last week sent out a scripted call to voters\u2019 phones on behalf of new co-chair Lara Trump saying Democrats committed \u201cmassive fraud\u201d in the 2020 election. It\u2019s the latest example of how the RNC under the former president\u2019s daughter-in-law is perpetuating lies about the 2020 election, even as prominent Republicans say the party needs to look forward to win in 2024. \u201cWe all know the problems. No photo IDs, unsecured ballot drop boxes, mass mailing of ballots, and voter rolls chock full of deceased people and non-citizens are just a few examples of the massive fraud that took place,\u201d the RNC call said. \u201cIf Democrats have their way, your vote could be canceled out by someone who isn\u2019t even an American citizen.\u201d The claim of \u201cmassive fraud\u201d in the 2020 election marks a significant shift in messaging for the RNC because lies about the 2020 election had not been a consistent theme in its messaging since Donald Trump left office. But the call\u2019s message is largely consistent with the views publicly espoused over the past four years by Lara Trump, who was elected as co-chair in early March as part of Donald Trump\u2019s takeover of the GOP. Lara Trump has a long history of echoing his election fraud claims, according to a CNN KFile analysis of her past statements as a commentator and surrogate for the former president. \u201cI\u2019m sure you agree with co-chair Trump that we cannot allow the chaos and questions of the 2020 election to ever happen again,\u201d said the call, which was obtained by CNN\u2019s KFile from the anti-robocall application Nomorobo, which estimated 145,000 calls were sent with the message from April 1-7. It comes amid previous CNN reporting about the RNC asking employees who are reapplying for their jobs whether they believe the 2020 election was stolen in an apparent litmus test for hiring. The RNC denied any such litmus test existed.\u00a0Lara Trump and new chair Michael Whatley succeeded Drew McKissick and Ronna McDaniel, who had earned the ire of the former president because of his dissatisfaction with how the RNC handled claims of fraud around the 2020 election, CNN previously reported. There is no evidence of widespread fraud in the 2020 election, as even some state GOP election officials and former Trump Attorney General William Barr have acknowledged. The former president and his supporters filed more than 60 court cases in six key battleground states following the election and lost every one of them. And, they have still not brought forth any evidence of the rampant cheating they continue to talk about on the campaign trail. But in the years since the 2020 election, Lara Trump has continued to push claims of fraud. Her comments have been in line with those of her father-in-law, who\u2019s successfully reshaped the GOP in his image and easily secured his third-straight GOP nomination this year. Polling, for example, shows that a majority of GOP voters think the 2020 election result was illegitimate. A CNN poll released last September found that 71% of Republicans said President Joe Biden\u2019s \u201cdid not legitimately win enough votes to win the presidency.\u201d From November 2020 to February 2024, Lara Trump propagated the narrative of Democratic cheating in the 2020 presidential election. And even after she was elected co-chair and said claims of a stolen election are \u201cin the past,\u201d she didn\u2019t repudiate those baseless accusations. \u201cWell, I think we\u2019re past that. I think that\u2019s in the past. We learned a lot. Certainly, we took a lot of notes,\u201d Trump said in an NBC interview when asked whether claims of a stolen 2020 election would be the official position of the RNC in 2024. She went on to tout lawsuits across 23 states \u201cto ensure that it is harder to cheat and easier to vote,\u201d while raising questions about pandemic-era voting procedures during the 2020 election. In the same interview, Trump also added the GOP needed to \u201ctrust mail-in voting.\u201d Neither the RNC nor Lara Trump responded to multiple requests for comment. A long history of spreading election lies As recently as February 2024, Lara Trump said she did not believe Biden received 81 million votes in the 2020 election. \u201cDoes anyone actually believe that in 2020, 81 million people were so inspired by a guy who could only get 10 people (to attended events) \u2026that he had the most massive turnout in the history of elections?\u201d she said at a Trump event in South Carolina just days before she announced her campaign for RNC co-chair. \u201cNo, we don\u2019t believe that.\u201d On her internet show and podcast, and in public events, she often spread outlandish and nonsensical claims about the 2020 election. On an episode of her show that aired on December 30, 2020, Trump agreed with her co-hosts that the election did not pass the \u201csmell test\u201d and falsely suggested that dead voters helped Biden win. \u201cNow, I don\u2019t know if this is true, but somebody sent me this. Donald Trump got 74 million votes. There are 133 million registered voters in the United States. If every single registered voter went out and voted, which we know is basically impossible, doesn\u2019t happen, there would only be 59 million votes left for Joe Biden. So how the heck did he get 81 million votes?\u201d she said. The comments cite a widely debunked analysis that misrepresents the number of people eligible to vote. \u201cYou\u2019re discriminating against all the dead people, Lara. How dare you!\u201d said one co-host. \u201cOh yeah, that\u2019s right. That\u2019s true,\u201d she responded. A CNN analysis previously found no evidence to support this claim, debunking the misinformation spread by Trump supporters online in the aftermath of the 2020 results. The 2020 election saw a record-breaking turnout, with 155 million people casting their votes, as reported by the US Census Bureau. This marked the highest voter participation of the 21st century, with 66.8% of eligible citizens aged 18 and older voting. Later in the episode, Trump said, \u201cI think that [Democrats] know that the Republicans are not gonna let it stand. They\u2019re not gonna certify votes for Joe Biden. And it is likely that they will be voting for Donald Trump for a second term.\u201d In an episode of her podcast weeks earlier, she claimed the odds of Biden winning in swing states were \u201cone in one quadrillion to the fourth power,\u201d as mail-in ballots were counted, failing to cite a statistical analysis. Though Biden narrowly lost with in-person voters, 46% of voters voted by mail in 2020. As votes were counted, Biden pulled ahead, according to an analysis from Pew Research. Though nothing was abnormal or illegal about the process, Lara Trump has also referred to the counting of votes nefariously. \u201cWe gotta make up so much for all the cheating,\u201d Trump said on her podcast in September 2023. \u201cWe know the Democrats love to do that. We need to go into this thing with such a big lead that they\u2019re like, \u2018oh my God, we can\u2019t do a 3:00 a.m. spike with this. We\u2019re never gonna make it.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/10/politics/lara-trump-rnc-2020-election-fraud-claims/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/01/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_15_politics_trump-presidency-memories-biden-analysis", "text": "During Donald Trump\u2019s four years in the White House, he was famously the only president whose job approval rating never reached 50% in Gallup Organization polls since the firm began systematically tracking that measure in the 1940s. But now more positive retrospective assessments of Trump\u2019s record in office are setting off warning flares for Democrats \u2014 especially as President Joe Biden\u2019s own approval ratings remain stuck at historically low levels. In a CNN poll from April, 55% of Americans said they considered Trump\u2019s presidency a success \u2014 a big jump from the 41% who viewed his presidency so positively when he left office in January 2021, according to a CNN survey from the time. If Biden is to win a second term, \u201cthe fact that Trump is getting this level of credit cannot stand,\u201d said Democratic pollster Jay Campbell, who conducts surveys on the economy with a Republican partner for CNBC. It\u2019s not unusual for approval ratings of presidents to rise out of office. The difference is that none of Trump\u2019s defeated predecessors sought to return to the White House four years later. The public\u2019s shifting ratings of those former presidents was of interest mostly to historians; this year, these reassessments will help decide control of the White House. Generally, Biden\u2019s campaign has spent less time challenging Trump\u2019s record in his first term than highlighting what he might do in a second one. But that balance appears to be shifting. Biden\u2019s campaign has invested heavily in emotional swing-state television advertisements that tie Trump to the 2022 Supreme Court decision overturning the constitutional right to abortion with the stark concluding tagline: \u201cDonald Trump did this.\u201d Now, Biden\u2019s team is escalating its efforts to contrast his record against some of Trump\u2019s other controversial initiatives. An ad aimed at Black voters that the campaign released Tuesday, for instance, juxtaposes Trump\u2019s attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act with Biden policies that have expanded coverage, lowered premiums under the law and capped the price of insulin at $35 per month. \u201cTrump was a failure on health care,\u201d a narrator declares, before a Black woman in the ad says: \u201cWe cannot go back.\u201d Michael Tyler, the Biden campaign\u2019s communications director, said more of those messages are coming. \u201cThis is exactly why you run a campaign,\u201d Tyler said. \u201cAs we move forward here, reminding people of the damage he caused, the damage he will cause and how he made you feel every single day is imperative.\u201d Almost every president sees their retrospective approval ratings improve after they leave office; when Gallup last measured views of former presidents in 2023, each one it included except for Bill Clinton received a higher approval rating than when they left the White House. Even Jimmy Carter and George H.W. Bush, the previous two one-term presidents before Trump, were each much more popular in the poll than when they lost their reelection bids. Trump\u2019s recovery since leaving office is \u201cnot a completely new phenomenon,\u201d said Emory University political scientist Alan Abramowitz, who specializes in studying presidential approval. In Gallup\u2019s poll last year, Trump\u2019s retrospective approval rating stood at 46%. That was up 12 percentage points from his final approval rating in office of 34%. Trump\u2019s improvement in the Gallup poll since leaving office was about the same experienced by both Carter and George W. Bush in their first Gallup post-presidential assessments. Other surveys suggest the backward-looking judgments on Trump have further improved since then. In an April national New York Times/Siena College survey, for instance, slightly more registered voters (48%) now say Trump left the country better off than worse off (46%) after his presidency. Nearly two-thirds of voters in the April New York Times/Siena survey said they approved of how Trump handled the economy and about half said they approved of his handling of both immigration and crime. The April national CNN survey conducted by SRSS reported some of the most dramatic change in attitudes. From the 2021 CNN survey until last month\u2019s poll, the share of people who termed Trump\u2019s presidency a success increased more for women than for men; more for people of color than for White voters; more among working-age adults than seniors; and more among Democratic voters than Republican. The 55% in the recent CNN poll who termed Trump\u2019s presidency a success far exceeded the 39% who gave the same positive verdict to Biden\u2019s time. Abramowitz, the political scientist, said that in today\u2019s highly polarized political atmosphere, it\u2019s not surprising that discontent with Biden is boosting Trump, almost in hydraulic fashion. \u201cThere\u2019s always going to be an inverse relationship to some extent in how people assess the current president of one party versus the previous president of the opposite party, but given that partisan loyalties are stronger today, that is probably a stronger tendency now,\u201d Abramowitz said. \u201cIf you are unhappy with how things are going now, that may influence your assessment of the previous presidency.\u201d Republican strategist Brad Todd likewise said that Trump, in effect, looks bigger to many voters because Biden looks smaller. \u201cWe judge presidential approval by strength and success more than anything,\u201d Todd said. \u201cPeople think the economy was better when Trump was president, whether they liked him or not, and they think Trump projected strength rather than weakness, and plenty of voters find aspects of Biden\u2019s presidency weak.\u201d The Biden comparison also could be benefiting Trump in a more specific way: by encouraging voters to shift the issues around which they are judging Trump\u2019s tenure. Because inflation, as well as immigration and crime, are much more relevant to voters today, in their retrospective judgments about Trump\u2019s record they may be focusing more on those issues and less on other elements of his presidency that disturbed them at the time, such as his open use of racist language or the general atmosphere of chaos that surrounded his presidency, strategists in both parties said. Jim McLaughlin, a pollster for Trump, pointed mostly to shifting public concerns and the contrast with Biden to explain these post-presidential gains for the former president. When the exit polls conducted by Edison Research for a consortium of media organizations including CNN asked voters what issue was most important to their decision in 2020, McLaughlin noted, the survey didn\u2019t include either the cost of living or immigration as a specific choice. That omission, he said, measured how little concern there was in the country at the time about each problem. Now, both of those issues routinely poll near the top of voters\u2019 worries in 2024, with Biden receiving some of his weakest marks on each. To many voters, said McLaughlin, Trump \u201clooks better and better on these issues compared to Joe Biden\u2019s failures.\u201d Many Democratic pollsters say that shift in emphasis about Trump is particularly evident among Black and Hispanic voters, especially younger to middle-aged men. \u201cParticularly among working-class Latinos. \u2026 They will tell us\u00a0that they think he\u2019s racist, xenophobic, anti-immigrant, anti-Latino,\u201d said Ben Tulchin, who served as the principal pollster for Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 two Democratic presidential campaigns.\u00a0\u201cBut then they say, \u2018Comma but,\u2019 and the \u2018but\u2019 is they view his economic record more favorably than Biden\u2019s. Maybe through rose-colored glasses, but that is a challenge the Biden campaign has.\u201d In that New York Times/Siena survey last month, for example, 70% of Hispanic voters said they disapproved of how Biden is handling the economy, while 74% approved of how Trump did. Democrats acknowledge that while it is important for Biden to improve views about his own economic record, it may be difficult for him to tarnish the positive impressions most voters hold about the economy under Trump \u2014 at least before the Covid-19 pandemic struck in 2020. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s possible to impeach the state of the economy under Trump,\u201d said Campbell. It will not be easy, he added, to say to voters, \u201c\u2018Well, your memory is wrong, things were not that great in the economy under the previous guy.\u2019 I just don\u2019t think that will get them very far.\u201d Rather than trying to erase positive views on Trump\u2019s economic performance, Campbell and other Democrats think Biden could have more success reminding voters about everything else they didn\u2019t like about his time in office. \u201cEconomy aside, you can\u2019t let people think the rest of life was hunky-dory under Donald Trump, because it wasn\u2019t,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cHis approval never got above 50% for a reason. There is plenty to dislike there and plenty that people did dislike.\u201d In fact, while Trump was president, polls underscored the dynamic Campbell describes. In that final CNN/SRSS poll in 2021 before Trump left office, a majority of Americans said they approved of his handling of the economy, but even so, 55% described his presidency as a failure, and just 26% said he had changed the country for the better. The challenge for Democrats, Tulchin said, is that while current conditions are constantly reminding voters that staples like gas, groceries and rent cost less under Trump, the controversies he ignites tend to burn out faster. \u201cWhat we have seen with eight or nine years of life with Trump as a presidential candidate is\u00a0unless the glaring awful things he does are right in people\u2019s faces \u2014 January 6, \u2018good people on both sides\u2019 post-Charlottesville, kids in cages \u2014 then two weeks later, it fades away,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to force people to watch the horrific person that Trump is. They can\u2019t look fondly back on\u00a0five years ago by overlooking his character flaws, because they are major.\u201d The new Biden ad aimed at Black voters released Tuesday may encapsulate the campaign\u2019s emerging approach to talking about Trump\u2019s record. The ad takes one of the most controversial episodes of Trump\u2019s presidency \u2014 his attempt to repeal the ACA \u2014 and uses it to create a point of comparison with Biden\u2019s policy initiatives to expand access to health care and to lower medical costs. The same approach is evident in a new Biden ad aimed at Latino voters that contrasts the former president\u2019s policy of separating migrant children from their parents at the border with Biden\u2019s efforts to reunite the families. Another example of that strategy was evident when Biden last week visited Racine, Wisconsin, where Trump had gone as president to trumpet a $10 billion investment from the Taiwanese electronics manufacturer Foxconn, which never materialized. Biden was there to tout a $3.3 billion Microsoft investment in an artificial intelligence center on the site, which he offered as evidence for the success of his broader agenda to promote private-sector investment in advanced industries such as clean energy and semiconductors. \u201cFolks, during the previous administration, my predecessor made promises which he broke more than kept and left a lot of people behind in communities like Racine,\u201d Biden declared. \u201cOn my watch, we make promises and we keep promises. And we leave no one behind.\u201d Biden\u2019s campaign expresses optimism that by reminding Americans about Trump\u2019s record on these fronts it can move voters \u2014 particularly in core constituencies that have drifted toward Trump such as younger Black and Hispanic men. Trump\u2019s standing with some of these groups may wilt, these Democrats think, simply as he spends more time back in the spotlight. But Todd, like many Republicans, believes Democrats are wrong to assume that more exposure inevitably means less support for Trump. \u201cDemocratic strategists \u2026 have been saying that for a year now,\u201d Todd said. \u201cI think it\u2019s time to reevaluate that geometry.\u201d Refreshing voters about Trump\u2019s prior record could add weight to all of Biden\u2019s warnings about his future plans. Reminding college-educated voters about Trump\u2019s record on abortion and January 6, for instance, could heighten their concern about how basic rights and democracy itself would fare in a second Trump term. Likewise, recalling for Latinos Trump\u2019s family separation policy may add credibility to Democratic warnings about his plans to undertake a mass deportation program of undocumented immigrants, complete with internment camps. If Trump is convicted in his New York hush money trial, in which he\u2019s pleaded not guilty, it will remind voters not only about his willingness to push the boundaries of law and morality, but also the volatility that perpetually envelops him. What\u2019s less clear is whether enough voters will make their decisions in November based on those concerns as opposed to the issues where polls show they now express more faith in Trump than Biden, such as inflation, the border and crime. In the end, what voters remember about Trump\u2019s presidency may be less important than what they prioritize. The real risk for Democrats is that Biden\u2019s present may have irrevocably changed what swing voters care most about in Trump\u2019s past.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/politics/trump-presidency-memories-biden-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/01/2024", "section": "politics"}}

{"id": "2024_05_31_politics_texas-supreme-court-abortion-ban", "text": "The Texas Supreme Court said a medical exemption in the state\u2019s abortion ban applies only when a person is at risk of death or serious physical impairment, ruling Friday against women who sued the state with claims that the ban had put their health at risk. The state\u2019s highest court, which is made up entirely of Republicans, reversed a lower court\u2019s order that broadened the exception to circumstances in which a pregnancy is \u201cunsafe\u201d for the pregnant person or when there is a fetal condition making it unlikely the fetus will survive. \u201cBecause the trial court\u2019s order opens the door to permit abortion to address any pregnancy risk, it is not a faithful interpretation of the law,\u201d the state Supreme Court said. The ruling came in a lawsuit brought by several Texas women who suffered serious health complications in their desired pregnancies. They alleged the state\u2019s strict abortion laws put their lives and health in danger when they were forced to wait until their health seriously deteriorated before receiving the procedure or were denied an abortion altogether until they traveled out of state. The Texas Supreme Court said the challengers did not prove the abortion ban, with its narrow medical emergency exemption, violated the state constitution. When the\u00a0Supreme Court overturned\u00a0federal abortion rights in June 2022, a Texas trigger law took effect, essentially\u00a0blocking all abortions\u00a0in the state other than those performed when the mother is \u201cat risk of death or poses a serious risk of substantial impairment of a major bodily function unless the abortion is performed or induced.\u201d Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, who was defending the abortion ban, praised the Friday ruling in a statement. \u201cToday, the Supreme Court of Texas unanimously upheld the Human Life Protection Act, one of our state\u2019s pro-life laws,\u201d said Paxton, a Republican. \u201cI will continue to defend the laws enacted by the Legislature and uphold the values of the people of Texas by doing everything in my power to protect mothers and babies.\u201d The Center for Reproductive Rights, which filed the case on behalf of the women last year, said the ruling did not provide \u201cmeaningful clarity\u201d for doctors. Nancy Northup,\u00a0the center\u2019s president and CEO, said in news conference that the group will \u201ccontinue to pursue every available legal avenue to address the suffering that is happening in Texas.\u201d \u201cImagine the trauma of being forced to give birth to a baby who would live only hours. This is happening every day to women in Texas,\u201d Northup said. \u201cToday\u2019s decision means the state of Texas thinks it is perfectly OK.\u201d The Texas justices took issue with the trial court\u2019s order allowing for an abortion to be performed if a doctor had a \u201cgood faith\u201d reason to believe the procedure was necessary. The high court ruled doctors must hew to the \u201creasonable medical judgment\u201d standard in the law, which the ruling described as requiring doctors to \u201cidentify a life-threatening physical condition that places the mother at risk of death or serious physical impairment of a major bodily function unless an abortion is performed.\u201d The state Supreme Court said a fetal condition making a pregnancy unviable was not by itself a reason that an abortion could be performed. \u201cAs painful as such circumstances are, that the law does not authorize abortions for diagnosed fetal conditions absent a life-threatening complication to the mother does not render it unconstitutional,\u201d read the opinion, written by Justice Jane Bland. Amanda Zurawski, a plaintiff in the case\u00a0who nearly died\u00a0after being denied an abortion, criticized the ruling Friday, saying it\u00a0\u201cfeels like a gut punch.\u201d \u201cUnfortunately, the Texas Supreme Court has showed us today that they don\u2019t wish to help pregnant Texans access health care and they don\u2019t want to help doctors practice medicine in the state of Texas,\u201d she said. \u201cThe Supreme Court had the opportunity to provide clarity, but they didn\u2019t \u2013 and we are right back where we started.\u201d Anti-abortion activists, meanwhile,\u00a0praised the opinion and said the Texas abortion ban was clear in allowing exemptions for medical emergencies. \u201cThe abortion lobby has created confusion on this fact to give the Democrats cover for their extremely unpopular all-trimester abortion agenda,\u201d\u00a0Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of anti-abortion group Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, said in a statement after the ruling. How state abortion bans apply in medical emergencies has been flashpoint in the fallout from the US Supreme Court\u2019s 2022 decision that ended the federal right to an abortion. The high court is now considering a Biden administration lawsuit challenging Idaho\u2019s ban, which exempts abortions when a woman\u2019s life is threatened but not when she is facing risks of bodily impairment that fall short of being potentially fatal. In Texas, the state Supreme Court previously weighed in on the medical emergency exemption with a 2023 ruling that blocked a doctor from performing an abortion for a Texas woman whose pregnancy complications were putting her health and future fertility at risk. (The woman traveled out of state to receive the procedure.) The ruling called on the Texas Medical Board to issue more guidance to clear up confusion around when the exemption applies. The state board has proposed such guidance; however, critics say its draft rules have not clarified the question. \u201cThe Texas Medical Board can and should issue guidance \u2026 that translates the way that the Texas Supreme Court has today interpreted the exception to Texas abortion bans and give guidance to physicians about how to apply those laws in specific medical circumstances,\u201d said Marc Hearron, senior counsel at the Center for Reproductive Rights. CNN has reached out to the board for comment. This story has been updated with additional details.

Robert Burke, a retired four-star Admiral, and the company\u2019s co-CEOs Yongchul \u201cCharlie\u201d Kim and Meghan Messenger are facing bribery and conspiracy charges, according to the Justice Department. Burke is also charged with performing acts affecting a personal financial interest and concealing material facts from the United States. If convicted, Burke faces a maximum penalty of 30 years in prison, and Kim and Messenger each face a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison. In a statement to CNN Friday, Rear Adm.

In exchange for the contract, Kim and Messenger promised Burke a lucrative job. That promise came to fruition, prosecutors say, and Burke began working at Company A in October 2022 at a yearly starting salary of $500,000.

{"id": "2024_05_30_politics_what-happens-now-trump-felony", "text": "A New York jury convicting Donald Trump on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records brought the former president\u2019s weekslong trial to a close but ushered in a new phase of the historic case. Now in the unique position of being the first former\u00a0US\u00a0president convicted of a felony, Trump faces the possibility of a prison sentence or probation for his crimes\u00a0stemming\u00a0from a hush money payment scheme he helped facilitate ahead of the 2016 presidential election. Trump\u00a0\u2013 who is known for mounting lengthy appeals of court rulings against him \u2013 has said he will appeal the conviction, which can be done after he is sentenced. Here\u2019s what to know about the case following Trump\u2019s conviction. When will Trump be sentenced? Judge Juan Merchan has set Trump\u2019s\u00a0sentencing\u00a0for\u00a010 a.m. ET\u00a0on\u00a0July 11. Merchan could sentence Trump to probation or up to 4 years on each count in state prison, with a maximum of 20 years. For now, the former president will remain out of prison as he awaits his sentencing. Prosecutors did not ask for Trump to post any bond. Can Trump appeal his conviction? Trump has consistently appealed court rulings against him in an effort to delay the proceedings or eventually land his case before a court that may side with him. The New York case is no different. Shortly after Trump was convicted, his attorney Todd Blanche asked Merchan for an acquittal of the charges notwithstanding the guilty verdict. The judge rejected the pro forma request. During the course of the trial, Trump\u2019s legal team took other steps to preserve its right to appeal a potential guilty verdict, looking at rulings from the judge on testimony and evidence. They\u2019re all but certain to mount such an appeal in the coming weeks. Can Trump still be elected president? In short,\u00a0yes. University of California, Los Angeles law professor Richard L. Hasen \u2013 one of the country\u2019s leading experts on election law \u2013 has consistently said that nothing in the US Constitution bars a convicted criminal\u00a0from\u00a0running for the nation\u2019s highest office. \u201cLegally, nothing changes with Trump\u2019s status as a candidate,\u201d Hasen wrote in his Election Law Blog on Thursday. \u201cThe Constitution contains only limited qualifications for running for office (being at least 35 years old, a natural born citizen, and at least 14 years a resident of the U.S.),\u201d Hasen continued. Additionally,\u00a0states cannot disqualify Trump from running due to his efforts to overturn the 2020 election due to the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling earlier this year, Hasen\u00a0said,\u00a0\u201cand they cannot add qualifications such as removing convicted felons off the ballot.\u201d Will the conviction cost Trump his right to vote? Though Trump, as a Florida resident, is subject to the state\u2019s draconian rules disenfranchising certain people with felony convictions, he may ultimately\u00a0benefit from how legislators in New York in 2021 made it easier for felons to regain the right to vote. When it comes to the Manhattan guilty verdict just rendered,\u00a0Trump\u2019s right to vote in Florida\u00a0in November\u2019s election will depend on whether he is sentenced to a term in prison and if he has finished serving that prison sentence by the time of the election. Florida bans felons from voting until they have completed the full terms of their sentence \u2013 including any supervised release \u2013 and until they have paid any associated fines and fees. That latter requirement was the subject of litigation after Florida\u2019s GOP-led legislature passed legislation that undermined a state constitutional amendment allowing people with felony convictions to regain the right to vote. Florida\u2019s felon voting prohibitions apply to people with out-of-state convictions. However, if a Floridian\u2019s conviction is out of state, Florida defers to that state\u2019s laws for how felon can regain their voting rights. In New York, thanks to a 2021 law, people with felony convictions regain their right to vote once they finish their term of incarceration \u2013 even if they are still subject to parole. That means Trump would only be denied his right to vote in Florida if he is serving a prison sentence for the Manhattan conviction at the time of the election. What does this mean for Trump\u2019s other criminal cases? Trump\u2019s conviction means little for his three other criminal cases, which will continue to proceed as they were prior to him being found guilty in the New York case. Trump\u2019s federal election subversion criminal case has been on hold while the\u00a0US\u00a0Supreme Court considers his claims of presidential immunity. The judge overseeing his classified documents case in Florida has indefinitely postponed the trial. And the Georgia election interference case is in legal limbo while Trump and several of his co-defendants try to disqualify the Atlanta-area prosecutor who brought the charges.

{"id": "2024_05_30_politics_can-trump-still-run-for-president-what-matters", "text": "Now that a New York jury has convicted former President Donald Trump of all 34 felony charges of falsifying business records, the next obvious question is: Can a convicted felon run for president? Definitely. A further question is more complicated: Could Trump, as a felon, vote for himself? Probably. Starting with the easy question \u2026 Can a convict run for president? The US Constitution lays out just three requirements for presidential candidates. They must: Trump meets all three requirements. There is, arguably, another criterion laid out in the 14th Amendment, where it states that no one who has previously taken an oath of office who engages in insurrection can be an officer of the US. But the US Supreme Court ruled earlier this year that Congress would have to pass a special law invoking this prohibition. That\u2019s not happening any time soon. Judge Juan Merchan has scheduled Trump\u2019s sentencing for July 11, which happens to be four days before the start of the Republican National Convention that is scheduled to take place in Milwaukee. It is technically possible, although perhaps unlikely for a first-time offender, that Trump could be sentenced to prison time. CNN senior legal analyst Elie Honig said most Class E felony convictions, the least serious type of felony in New York, result in non-prison sentences \u2013 often a combination of probation, fines and community service. As a former president, Trump enjoys lifetime Secret Service protection and he will continue to get protection wherever he is, according to Anthony Guglielmi, chief of communications for the Secret Service. \u201cToday\u2019s outcome has no bearing on the manner in which the United States Secret Service carries out its protective mission. Our security measures will proceed unchanged,\u201d Guglielmi said in a statement to CNN. There is also precedent for presidential campaigns, albeit unsuccessful ones, being mounted from prison cells. Eugene Debs, the Socialist leader, conducted his 1920 presidential campaign from federal prison in Atlanta, where he was serving a 10-year sentence for sedition. He had encouraged Americans to oppose the draft in World War I. The Supreme Court, in that case, had affirmed his conviction, arguing he was convicted not for opposing the draft but for encouraging people not to comply with it. The decision keeping Debs in jail was written by then-Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes just a few months before Holmes did a famous about-face on free speech that put the US on course for the way we view the First Amendment today. Thomas Doherty, an American studies professor at Brandeis University, wrote last year about Debs, noting that he remained in prison as votes were cast and counted \u2013 he got nearly a million, more than 3% of the vote. Even after the Sedition Act was repealed, Debs was kept in prison. Then-President Woodrow Wilson refused to issue a pardon. Wilson\u2019s successor and Debs\u2019 rival in 1920, Warren G. Harding, later commuted Debs\u2019 sentence in 1921. And now to the more difficult question \u2026 Can a convicted felon vote? It depends. Trump\u2019s right to vote in Florida in November\u2019s election will depend on whether he is sentenced to a term in prison and if he has finished serving that prison sentence by the time of the election. Each state makes its own rules. Vermont and Maine allow felons to vote from prison. There has been movement in multiple states toward allowing felons on parole to cast ballots. Trump is now a Florida resident \u2013 and Florida voters, in 2018, overwhelmingly backed a referendum to reenfranchise convicted felons. But Republican lawmakers who control the state\u2019s government first delayed and then qualified the reenfranchisement by requiring that felons must pay all fines and fees associated with their sentence. I talked to Neil Volz, deputy director of the Florida Rights Restoration Coalition, an organization that works to help reenfranchise formerly incarcerated people. He predicted Trump will have little problem voting since Florida actually defers to the jurisdiction of a felony conviction as to whether a felon can vote. In New York, after a law passed in 2021, any convicted felon who is not incarcerated is eligible to register to vote. Read more from the Campaign Legal Center. Even if the judge ultimately tried to give Trump prison time, it is highly unlikely that Trump\u2019s right to appeal his conviction would be exhausted before Election Day. If, somehow, Trump was convicted in one of the two federal criminal cases against him before Election Day, that might be another story. There are other problems for many post-incarceration felons in Florida, as CNN has reported previously, although they would not apply to Trump. For starters, there is no clearinghouse of data about what fees are required. It has led to confusion and kept many people from voting. \u201cThere are still a lot of people who are confused about their eligibility, and that\u2019s why we continue to work with the state and the election professionals to fix the system,\u201d Volz told me. \u201cBecause people need to know whether they\u2019re eligible or not on the front end of the process.\u201d Volz said his group is making progress with the state to make it much easier for people to confirm their eligibility.

{"id": "2024_05_31_politics_bob-menendez-trial-halal-monopoly", "text": "A key witness in the federal corruption trial of Sen. Bob Menendez testified Friday that the New Jersey Democrat told him to \u201cstop interfering\u201d when he raised concerns about a newfound food industry monopoly by a constituent of the senator\u2019s. Ted McKinney, a former US Department of Agriculture official, said he learned in April 2019 that Egypt had de-listed seven halal certifiers in the US from approving meat exports and replaced them with a sole certifier, IS EG Halal. That company is owned by Wael Hana, Menendez\u2019s constituent and alleged co-conspirator in the case. Menendez and Hana, along with New Jersey businessman Fred Daibes and Menendez\u2019s wife, Nadine, are accused of engaging in a bribery scheme and acting as foreign agents for the Egyptian government. All four have pleaded not guilty. McKinney was a much-anticipated witness in the trial of Menendez, Hana and Daibes in federal court in New York, as prosecutors have pointed to his phone call with Menendez as evidence that the senator worked to keep the monopoly in place in exchange for bribes from Hana. The senator\u2019s wife is set to go on trial in July. McKinney testified that he was very concerned with the monopoly decision, as IS EG Halal had no experience in the industry and the transition, which would happen in only a week, would affect US competition and Egyptian consumers. \u201cWe had never seen or heard anything like this in my history in the agriculture industry and in the foreign agricultural services,\u201d McKinney testified. On May 1, 2019, the date that had been set by Egypt to go live with the monopoly, McKinney said he called the Egyptian ambassador to the US to find a solution that would not disrupt the flow of exports entirely. After not hearing back from the ambassador, McKinney elevated the urgency and emailed Mona Mehrez, an Egyptian deputy minister of agriculture, referring to the monopoly as a \u201cdraconian decision.\u201d He said he did not hear back from the Egyptian ambassador or Mehrez, but he did hear from one US senator in late May. \u201cI will never forget those words,\u201d McKinney testified of his phone call with Menendez, saying the senator told him to \u201cstop interfering with my constituent.\u201d McKinney said he knew exactly whom Menendez was referring to: Hana\u2019s IS EG Halal. McKinney said he understood the message to be: \u201cLet lie the fact that there was now one\u201d certifier. Menendez spoke in a \u201cserious\u201d and sometimes \u201ccurt\u201d tone, McKinney testified, adding that he didn\u2019t recall the senator saying \u201cplease\u201d during the phone call. McKinney said that he tried to explain to Menendez why his team wanted to stop the monopoly and that Menendez interrupted him, with the conversation ending shortly afterward. McKinney said he alerted three people on his staff to the call and prepared a follow-up email he would send Menendez to further explain his position. The \u201csole reason,\u201d McKinney said, that he never sent the email was because he learned of an FBI investigation into the senator. He put the word out within the USDA to stand down because \u201cit was in the hands of the FBI at this point.\u201d Puzzlement and frustration over Hana\u2019s arrangement with the Egyptian government did not begin at McKinney\u2019s desk, as\u00a0James Bret Tate, then a diplomat based in Cairo with a focus on US agricultural interests, testified earlier in the trial. Tate gave a detailed account of how he came to realize that Hana\u2019s new company had obtained its monopoly.

{"id": "2024_05_31_politics_felon-trump-rights-what-matters", "text": "Donald Trump\u2019s conviction by a New York jury on 34 felony counts is historic and unprecedented. No former president or major party presidential candidate has also been a felon. When CNN asked readers for their questions, a flood came in. Some of the more interesting and most-asked questions are below. And if there\u2019s something we didn\u2019t get to, ask us here. It varies by state. In New York, where Trump was convicted, there are \u201ccollateral consequences\u201d of being convicted of a felony. Importantly, felons in New York cannot hold many public offices, including elected positions. But Trump is no longer a New York resident. In Florida, felons lose civil rights, including the ability to hold public office and serve on a jury. While he can\u2019t hold office in Florida or New York, there\u2019s nothing in the Constitution to bar him from running for president. In New York, a felon can apply for a Certificate of Good Conduct to restore all rights after a certain period of time. The charges against Trump are Class E felonies, for which the period is three years. Florida requires felons to apply for clemency through a special board, but in the case of out-of-state convictions like Trump\u2019s, it defers to the state where the person was convicted. Not in this case. Presidents have the power to issue pardons for federal offenses. Trump has been convicted of a felony in New York state court. That would require the pardon of New York\u2019s governor, Democrat Kathy Hochul, who has praised his conviction. Most likely. Trump is a Florida resident, and Florida defers to New York law on the question of felons voting. New York allows felons to vote as long as they are not incarcerated. His sentencing is set for July 11, four days before the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee. Judge Juan Merchan could technically impose prison time \u2013 felony falsifying business records can be punished with up to four years in prison. But Trump has been convicted of Class E felonies, the lowest level in New York law. He is also a first-time offender. That said, Merchan could take into account that Trump has repeatedly violated a gag order. Here\u2019s what Secret Service chief of communications Anthony Guglielmi told CNN after the jury reached the guilty verdict: \u201cToday\u2019s outcome has no bearing on the\u00a0manner in which\u00a0the United States Secret Service carries out its protective mission. Our security measures will proceed unchanged.\u201d No one knows exactly. Time in prison still seems relatively unlikely for this offense. One can imagine the US Supreme Court getting involved or the sentence being delayed until after his term, or even a pardon by the New York governor in the interest of the country. But these are all just possibilities. Yes. A survey of past cases by the legal website Just Security  found numerous examples of prison time being imposed for this offense. These types of convictions do not usually lead to jail time. Trump\u2019s conviction does not automatically prevent him from holding a US passport. But it could make it difficult to travel to some countries. Thirty-eight countries don\u2019t allow felons to enter their borders, according to World Population Review, which says that some of those countries deny entry to felons \u201cup front\u201d while others do so only after such a conviction is \u201cdiscovered.\u201d That list includes Canada and Mexico, as well as Australia, China and South Africa. Federal law bars individuals convicted of a felony from possessing a firearm, and most states have analogous prohibitions. A case challenging the federal prohibition has been appealed to the US Supreme Court, but the justices have not yet said whether they will hear the challenge. In New York, convicted felons cannot obtain a permit to possess a firearm. It\u2019s possible for Trump to later petition a state judge to have his firearm possession rights restored. In Florida, where Trump is a resident, the Sunshine State has a similar felon disarmament law on the books. That law bars people convicted of a felony in Florida courts from possessing a firearm and also extends that prohibition to individuals found guilty of a felony in another state. But under Florida law, the state\u2019s Clemency Board \u201cwill not consider requests for firearm authority from individuals convicted in federal or out-of-state courts,\u201d according to the state. Technically. But not likely. The Supreme Court ruled this year that Congress could keep Trump off ballots if it passed a special measure determining he took part in an insurrection. That\u2019s not at issue in this New York case, and it\u2019s not going to happen when Republicans control the House as they currently do. The Constitution also allows for people who are impeached by the House and convicted by the Senate to be barred from federal office. Trump was impeached twice as president but acquitted twice in the Senate. Yes. Appeals and the sentencing process are ongoing, so the gag order remains in effect. That means every time Trump criticizes a key witness like Michael Cohen, he dances up to the line of violating the gag order, which could lead to penalties like fines or even jail time. The trial has been delayed by allegations of impropriety against Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis for her relationship with a former prosecutor on the case. As a result, a trial date has not been set. Trump\u2019s two federal trials are also on ice. The judge in Florida overseeing the case in which federal prosecutors allege he mishandled classified documents and tried to hide them from the National Archives has proceeded very slowly and has allowed procedural questions to pile up. The trial is currently postponed indefinitely. In the federal election subversion case in Washington, DC, the Supreme Court has yet to weigh in on whether Trump should enjoy immunity from prosecution as a former president. The hush money payoff took place just before the 2016 election. The fact of the payments was discovered in 2018. Federal prosecutors ultimately decided not to pursue charges against Trump related to the payments and so did a previous Manhattan DA, Cy Vance Jr. It was seen as a gamble when current Manhattan DA Alvin Bragg ultimately announced charges in April 2023. It would be difficult for anyone with a felony conviction to get security clearance. But presidents do not need to obtain security clearance. The voters have essentially given them access to all the country\u2019s secrets. Falsifying business records is a misdemeanor in New York unless the crime is committed with intent to commit another crime. In this case, the other crimes were federal campaign violations.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/31/politics/felon-trump-rights-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/01/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_31_politics_biden-administration-border-executive-action", "text": "The Biden administration is preparing to roll out a sweeping border executive action as early as Tuesday, according to two sources familiar with the discussions, who cautioned that timing is fluid. For weeks, administration officials have been working through an executive action that would dramatically limit migrants\u2019 ability to seek asylum at the US southern border \u2014 part of a strategy to try to give President Joe Biden the upper hand on one of his Republican rival\u2019s key campaign issues. The action is designed to potentially blunt Republican attacks on border security and preempt former President Donald Trump ahead of the first presidential debate, which will be held on June 27 on CNN. The executive action is expected to be reminiscent of a controversial measure from the Trump era. It involves using an authority known as 212f between ports of entry to try to clamp down on unlawful border crossings. CNN\u00a0previously reported\u00a0that officials were discussing announcing the executive action after Mexico\u2019s election on June 2 and before the first presidential debate. Biden is scheduled to travel to France on Wednesday. \u201cWhile Congressional Republicans chose to stand in the way of additional border enforcement, President Biden will not stop fighting to deliver the resources that border and immigration personnel need to secure our border,\u201d a White House spokesperson said in a statement. \u201cAs we have said before, the Administration continues to explore a series of policy options and we remain committed to taking action to address our broken immigration system.\u201d A White House official told CNN that no final decisions have been made on additional executive actions. With border arrests down this year, thanks in part to Mexico stepping up its own enforcement efforts in January, the White House is looking to take advantage of a brief reprieve from one of the most politically fraught issues Biden faces in his reelection campaign. Some Democrats on Capitol Hill have also encouraged White House officials to consider having the president make another visit to the border in the coming weeks. A White House spokesperson previously told CNN that no border trip for Biden is under consideration at the moment. Over recent weeks, the administration has trotted out a series of policy changes to try to dissuade migrants from journeying to the US and convince skeptical voters they are working to tighten up immigration at the border. That includes\u00a0rolling out new guidance and regulations that would tighten the immigration system to quickly reject migrants who are ineligible for asylum and speed up court cases for some migrants \u2014 measures Biden officials hope will, in part, keep the number of border crossings low.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/31/politics/biden-administration-border-executive-action/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/01/2024", "section": "politics"}}

Trump, while lambasting the\u00a0prosecution in his New York hush money criminal trial\u00a0as a \u201cdisgrace,\u201d similarly pointed to this fall\u2019s presidential election. \u201cThe real verdict is going to be November 5 by the people. And they know what happened here, and everybody knows what happened here,\u201d Trump told reporters outside the\u00a0Manhattan\u00a0courtroom. News of Trump\u2019s conviction on 34 felony charges of falsifying business records, sent shockwaves through campaigns up and down the ballot. Republican candidates in races for governor, Senate and House largely aligned themselves with Trump, while Democrats largely avoided the specifics of the case but said justice had prevailed. The former president\u2019s allies on Capitol Hill were quick to rally around him, with top Republicans attacking the justice system in the wake of the verdict \u2013 while also highlighting the importance of the\u00a02024\u00a0election and making fundraising appeals of their own. House Speaker Mike Johnson, who had traveled to the Manhattan courthouse during the trial to defend Trump, decried what he described as \u201cthe weaponization of our justice system,\u201d\u00a0saying in a statement, \u201cPresident Trump will rightfully appeal this absurd verdict \u2014 and he WILL WIN.\u201d Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who\u2019s had a frosty relationship with the former president, said in a short statement: \u201cThese charges never should have been brought in the first place. I expect the conviction to be overturned on appeal.\u201d House Majority Leader Steve Scalise wrote on\u00a0social media, \u201cI won\u2019t stand by while the leader of our party is ambushed by our own government. Will you stand with Trump before midnight tonight and condemn this witch hunt once and for all?\u201d\u00a0The Louisiana Republican\u00a0included a link to a fundraising site. New York\u00a0Rep. Elise Stefanik, the House GOP\u00a0Conference\u00a0chair\u00a0and a potential Trump running mate pick, slammed what she referred to as a\u00a0\u201csham trial.\u201d \u201cWe must redouble our efforts and work around the clock to ensure President Trump is victorious this November to save America from Biden\u2019s failed Far Left Democrat agenda,\u201d\u00a0she said in a statement. South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, who is also a possible Trump running mate, claimed on Thursday that the US justice system \u201chunts Republicans while protecting Democrats.\u201d \u201cThis was certainly a hoax, a sham. This was devastating for the average American watching,\u201d Scott told CNN\u2019s Abby Phillip on \u201cNewsNight.\u201d Spinning the verdict into a positive, he added, \u201cEven the \u2018Never-Trumpers\u2019 are now calling and joining the team. Donors who sat on the sidelines are now joining the team because November 5th is a day of reckoning.\u201d Senate GOP candidates back Trump Republican Senate candidates also quickly sided with the former president. Tim Sheehy,\u00a0who is\u00a0challenging Democratic Sen. Jon Tester in Montana, issued a statement declaring the verdict \u201cRIGGED\u201d and called\u00a0the case\u00a0\u201cstate-sponsored political persecution.\u201d Kari Lake, the Republican poised to face Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego in Arizona\u2019s Senate race, said Americans had \u201cjust witnessed the most egregious example of election interference and an outright mockery of the rule of law in the 246-year history of our Republic. This entire process right down to the verdict itself has been nothing but a shameful political stunt.\u201d \u201cThis is a terrible day for America and for trust in our justice system,\u201d said\u00a0Pennsylvania\u00a0Republican Dave McCormick, who is challenging Democratic Sen. Bob Casey. \u201cThis case should never have been brought in the first place, and this miscarriage of justice is despicable.\u201d Democrats, meanwhile, offered more muted reactions \u2014 and many didn\u2019t comment at all in the immediate aftermath of the verdict. \u201cI respect our justice system and the rule of law. The process played out, and we should always demand accountability from our elected leaders,\u201d Gallego\u00a0said on\u00a0social media. And some Republicans who have been more critical of Trump kept their distance from the former president Thursday. When news broke that the jury had reached a verdict, former Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, who\u2019s running for Senate in the traditionally blue state, called for Americans to \u201crespect the verdict and the legal process.\u201d \u201cAt this dangerously divided moment in our history, all leaders \u2013 regardless of party \u2013 must not pour fuel on the fire with more toxic partisanship,\u201d Hogan said in a statement before the verdict was announced. That post elicited a terse response later from Trump senior adviser Chris LaCivita: \u201cYou just ended your campaign.\u201d Presidential rivals\u2019 reactions Not only is Trump the first former president to be found guilty of a felony, he\u2019s also the first major-party presidential nominee to be convicted of a crime in the\u00a0middle\u00a0of a campaign for the White House. If he defeats Biden in November,\u00a0Trump would\u00a0be the first sitting president in history to be a convicted felon. The Biden campaign said in a statement\u00a0that\u00a0the verdict in New York showed\u00a0that\u00a0\u201cno one is above the law.\u201d \u201cThe threat Trump poses to our democracy has never been greater. He is running an increasingly unhinged campaign of revenge and retribution,\u201d\u00a0campaign spokesman Michael Tyler\u00a0said.\u00a0\u201cA second Trump term means chaos, ripping away Americans\u2019 freedoms and fomenting political violence \u2013 and the American people will reject it this November.\u201d The Biden campaign also sent a text message to supporters warning that Trump was likely \u201csetting fundraising records\u201d following Thursday\u2019s verdict. Independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who learned of the verdict while speaking with reporters ahead of his appearance at a cryptocurrency convention in Austin, Texas, dismissed the importance of the case. \u201cI\u2019ve been disciplined about not commenting on the court cases and talking about issues that I think are of deep concern to Americans, and not the issues that, you know, are being used to divide us, the culture war issues. I\u2019m not going to comment on it,\u201d Kennedy said. This headline and story have been updated with additional information.

{"id": "2024_05_29_politics_supreme-court-trump-what-matters", "text": "Former President Donald Trump\u2019s favorite Supreme Court justices might not even be the three he nominated. Trump congratulated Justice Samuel Alito, who was nominated in 2005 by then-President George W. Bush, after the jurist on Wednesday refused to recuse himself from cases related to the January 6, 2021, riot at the Capitol or the 2020 election. Alito said in a letter to lawmakers that he didn\u2019t know that his wife had raised an upside-down flag in the days before President Joe Biden\u2019s inauguration in January 2021. In any event, the deeds of his wife, Martha-Ann Alito, don\u2019t meet his threshold for recusal. Alito\u00a0also\u00a0addressed\u00a0the \u201cAppeal to Heaven\u201d flag \u2013 which some interpret as pushing for more religion in the public space and has also become a symbol for Trump supporters \u2013 that was flown at the justice\u2019s New Jersey beach house last summer.\u00a0He said his wife flew the flag, which dates back to the American Revolution, and neither was aware of its current connotation. But Trump was doing the social media equivalent of a fist pump at Alito\u2019s declaration when he said this on his social media platform: Congratulations to United States Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito for showing the INTELLIGENCE, COURAGE, and \u201cGUTS\u201d to refuse stepping aside from making a decision on anything January 6th related. All U.S. Judges, Justices, and Leaders should have such GRIT - Our Country would be far more advanced than its current status as A BADLY FAILING NATION, headed by the Worst President in American History, Crooked Joe Biden! The Supreme Court is currently deliberating over whether Trump, as a former president, should enjoy some level of super immunity from prosecution. It\u2019s a complicated case, but certainly Alito was one of the justices most open to immunity claims during oral arguments in April. Alito is also the justice who wrote the decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization, the landmark opinion that overturned Roe v. Wade and ended a nationwide right to abortion for American women. While Trump has waffled on how to handle the abortion issue now that there is a patchwork of laws across the country, his latest position is to leave the matter up to states, not unlike what Alito suggested in writing the opinion. The actions of Alito\u2019s wife, flying an upside-down flag as part of a neighborhood dispute over the outcome of the 2020 presidential election, are well within someone\u2019s First Amendment rights. It\u2019s also true that the Alitos\u2019  judgment in how a Supreme Court justice should appear objective is suspect. These relatively innocuous, political expressions pale in comparison to the actions of another Supreme Court spouse: Virginia \u201cGinni\u201d Thomas, who in addition to being married to Justice Clarence Thomas (who was nominated in 1991 by George H.W. Bush) is a conservative activist featured prominently in the House January 6 report. She was actively strategizing around the fake elector scheme by which Trump\u2019s allies wanted to upend Biden\u2019s victory. In text messages with Trump\u2019s White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, Ginni Thomas referred to the 2020 election as a \u201cheist.\u201d She later told the January 6 committee she regretted the messages. Unlike Alito, who responded to lawmakers\u2019 calls for his recusal, Thomas has stayed silent on the matter, although it is clear at this point he will not be recusing himself from any January 6-related cases. Read more from CNN\u2019s Devan Cole. The perception of political bias among Supreme Court spouses does not necessarily mean anything about the political leanings of their powerful husbands, although Alito and Thomas form the core of the conservative majority that currently dominates the Supreme Court.

{"id": "2024_05_29_politics_turnout-2024-election-analysis", "text": "For decades, Democrats have built their electoral strategies on a common assumption: the higher the turnout, the better their chances of winning. But that familiar equation may no longer apply for President Joe Biden in 2024. A wide array of polls this year shows Biden running best among Americans with the most consistent history of voting, while former President Donald Trump often displays the most strength among people who have been the least likely to vote. These new patterns are creating challenges for each party. Trump\u2019s potential appeal to more irregular voters, particularly younger Black and Latino men, is compelling Democrats to rethink longstanding strategies that focused on mobilizing as many younger and non-White voters as possible without worrying about their partisan allegiance. For Republicans, the challenge will be to build an organization capable of connecting with irregular voters they have not traditionally focused on reaching, particularly in minority communities. \u201cWhat all this means is this election has volatility,\u201d says Daniel Hopkins, a University of Pennsylvania political scientist who has studied the widening partisan divergence between voters with and without a consistent history of turning out. \u201cWe used to expect that the marginal non-voter, the next voter who turned out if an election was very engaging, didn\u2019t look different from people who did vote. In this case, the crowd that hasn\u2019t gotten engaged looks very, very different.\u201d Merged results from the three most recent national NBC polls, conducted by a bipartisan team of prominent Democratic and Republican pollsters, for instance, found that Biden leads Trump by 4 percentage points among people who voted in both 2020 and 2022. But among those who voted in 2020 but not 2022, Trump led Biden by 12 percentage points. Trump\u2019s lead swelled to 20 percentage points among those who did not vote in either 2020 or 2022. Fully 65% of those who did not vote in either of the past two elections said they disapproved of Biden\u2019s performance in office. Combined results from recent national New York Times/Siena College polls likewise have found Biden narrowly leading among potential 2024 voters who turned out in 2020 while trailing Trump by double digits among those who did not vote in their previous contest. Hopkins has conducted perhaps the most ambitious attempt to quantify the divergence between Americans with and without a history of voting. Earlier this year, he and a colleague worked with NORC at the University of Chicago to survey over 2,400 adults about their preferences in the 2024 race. The poll only surveyed people who were old enough to vote in each of the past three elections \u2014 the midterms of 2018 and 2022 and the 2020 presidential race. The results were striking. Among adults who had voted in each of the past three federal elections, Biden led Trump by 11 points, and Biden eked out a narrow advantage among voters who participated in two of the past three races. But, the poll found, Trump led Biden by 12 percentage points among those who voted in just one of the past three elections and by a crushing margin of 18 percentage points among those who came out for none of them. As important, the pattern held across racial lines. In the poll, Trump ran even with Biden among Latinos who voted in two, one or none of the past three elections, while Biden held a nearly 20-point advantage among those who voted in all three. With Black voters, Biden\u2019s lead was just 10 points among those who did not show up for any of the past three elections, but over 80 points among those who participated in all three. Using data from Catalist, a leading Democratic voter targeting firm, Michael Podhorzer, the former political director of the AFL-CIO, reached similar conclusions. He found that in 2020 Biden\u2019s margins over Trump were higher among people who voted in the three previous elections of 2018, 2016 and 2014 than those who voted in some or none of them \u2014 and that the relationship held across racial lines. Hopkins said the gap between habitual and irregular voters in his latest survey was far greater than the difference he found when he conducted a similar poll early in the 2016 race between Trump and Hillary Clinton. Key to this widening chasm, he believes, may be another dynamic: Adults who are less likely to vote are also less likely to follow political news. \u201cFor more infrequent voters, these are often people who pay less attention to politics and whose political barometer is more the question of how is my family doing economically, how does the country seem to be doing,\u201d Hopkins said. \u201cFor those voters, Donald Trump\u2026is not especially unusual.\u201d By contrast, Hopkins said, a \u201csizable sliver\u201d of habitual voters \u201chave a sense that Trump may be qualitatively different than other political candidates with respect to norm violations and January 6.\u201d\u00a0For less frequent voters, he added, the equation may be as simple as \u201cthey don\u2019t love what they see with Joe Biden, and if Donald Trump is the person running against Joe Biden, they want change.\u201d The NBC polling results buttress that conclusion: It found that among the roughly one-sixth of voters who say they do not follow political news, Trump led Biden by fully 2-to-1. Several analysts caution that while this divergence between high- and low-frequency voters is appearing consistently in polls now, it\u2019s too early to say for certain whether it will persist through Election Day. \u201cIt\u2019s May,\u201d said Republican pollster Bill McInturff, whose firm conducts the NBC poll with a Democratic partner. \u201cThis data matters when people start having to vote.\u201d Democratic strategist Tom Bonier pointed out that public opinion surveys often have enough trouble measuring attitudes among young people and minorities, let alone accurately capturing those who are most disengaged from the political system. Melissa Morales \u2014 founder and president of Somos Votantes and Somos PAC, groups that mobilize Latino voters \u2014 said that in their outreach campaigns this year, they are not seeing the tilt toward Trump among low-frequency voters evident in these multiple polls. In their work during 2022, she said,\u00a0\u201cWe were hearing it in the field, with low propensity Latino voters, they were open to Trump, especially [over] the economy.\u201d But, she added, \u201cWe are not hearing that in the field right now\u201d and instead \u201cwhat we are hearing is deep concern about the cost of living, rising costs, and a strong desire to know what the path forward is.\u201d Even with all these cautions, there are strong reasons to believe that Trump may benefit more from a very large overall turnout this year than Biden would. That conclusion is consistent with the other unusual demographic patterns evident in the 2024 election. So far, in almost all polls, Biden is holding a higher share of his 2020 vote among White than non-White voters; he\u2019s also maintaining more of his 2020 level of support with seniors than with young people. Among Whites, Biden, as in 2020, is running much better with those who hold at least a four-year college degree than those who don\u2019t. Biden\u2019s relative strength among seniors and college-educated White voters means that he\u2019s drawing from two of the most reliable voting blocs in the electorate. In 2020, about 75% of people older than 65 voted, compared to just 54% of young people aged 18-29, according to calculations from Census data by William Frey, a demographer at Brookings Metro. (Even that was a big increase in turnout among young people from the 2012 and 2016 elections.) Far more White voters with degrees turned out than those without them as well. Turnout was especially modest among the Black and Latino voters who have shown the most receptivity to Trump \u2014 men without a college degree. Only slightly less than half of them voted in 2020, Frey found. Most experts who study turnout consider it unlikely that as many people will vote this year as in 2020, largely because so many voters hold negative views about both Biden and Trump. After a record 160 million people voted in 2020, Bonier said his preliminary calculation is that turnout in 2024 is more likely to reach between 145-150 million with the possibility that as few as 140 million people will vote. Jeremy Smith, CEO of Civitech, a Democratic voter data and targeting firm, said that the number of people registered to even potentially vote is way down from the total at this point in the 2020 cycle. \u201cGenerally, if you said there are two possible electorates \u2014 one is 140 million people voting and one is 160 million people \u2014 the high likelihood is that the 140 would be better for Biden,\u201d said Bonier, a senior adviser and former CEO of TargetSmart, a leading Democratic targeting firm. If turnout shrinks from 2020, the key question for the two sides will be which voters fall away \u2014 and how many new voters enter the electorate to replace them. Generally, Democrats believe that in the Trump era the party benefits when the most habitual voters comprise a larger share of the electorate. Many Democrats believe that a key reason the party exceeded expectations in the 2022 midterm is that the electorate tilted more than anticipated toward these regular voters. The Democratic polling firm Equis Research, which focuses on Latino voters, for instance, found in its post-election analysis that Democrats performed slightly better than expected with that group largely because irregular Latino voters, who were more receptive to Trump, failed to come out. Michael Madrid, a long-time GOP strategist who has become a fierce Trump critic, said that the disappointing 2022 results for Republicans showed the risk for the party in the turnout patterns that the former president has triggered. Republicans under Trump, Madrid argued, are gaining support among non-White men, particularly Latinos, while shedding support among college-educated White voters, especially women. The danger for the GOP, Madrid said, is that the latter group turns out at a far higher rate than the former (as Frey\u2019s data shows). Given that disparity, Madrid argued, Trump \u201cneeds a high turnout\u201d that pulls in less reliable minority voters, especially Latino men. Trump\u2019s conundrum, Madrid said, is that the belligerent rule-breaking persona that attracts those younger non-White men alienates more of the well-educated White women already trending away from him. \u201cHe is talking to a single young male between video games: He\u2019s got them, they love him,\u201d Madrid said. \u201cBut there are suburban women that you lose by that, who hate that. That\u2019s his dilemma. He gets the turnout, but he also gets the turnoff.\u201d The best-case scenario for Trump is that an unusually large number of these irregularly voting working-class minorities come out to vote for him. Given his success in the past two elections at turning out irregularly voting working-class Whites, no one discounts his chances of turning out irregularly voting working-class non-Whites this time. But it\u2019s hardly guaranteed: Though these voters tend to be strongly discontented with the economy, Democrats believe they can loosen Trump\u2019s hold on them by highlighting his views on other issues, such as his pledges to implement a mass deportation effort against undocumented migrants, or to pardon White supremacists convicted in the January 6, 2021, insurrection. And as Podhorzer argued, unhappiness with the economy historically has not proven to be a powerful force in motivating irregular voters to show up. But Republicans point out that even if Trump doesn\u2019t win as many of these irregularly voting non-White men as polls show today, he will still benefit if they drift toward third-party candidates or simply choose not to vote. Looking at the Black community, \u201ceven if you don\u2019t buy the potential for Trump to flip lots of votes there, it seems there\u2019s considerable risk of a turnout drop-off that will hit Biden\u2019s raw margins out of big cities in the battlegrounds that Democrats usually depend on,\u201d said GOP pollster Patrick Ruffini. For that reason, many voter mobilization experts say Democrats can\u2019t give up on infrequent voters showing receptivity to Trump. Podhorzer pointed out that Democrats can still benefit from high turnout if the campaign\u2019s final weeks focus on the aspects of Trump\u2019s agenda that most alienate the irregular voters who surged to the polls against him in 2020. Morales said the number of low-frequency Latino voters that Somos PAC turned out in Nevada in 2022 exceeded Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto\u2019s margin of victory there, and the group remains committed to reaching those same voters for Biden. \u201cNot only can we get them out to vote, but when we have a conversation about the contrast and what their votes mean on the issues, we can win those voters over,\u201d Morales said. All of these dynamics may prove most volatile with younger voters. Through the 21st century, as first Millennials and now Generation Z have entered the electorate in large numbers, Democrats have unwaveringly operated on the belief that turning out as many young voters as possible would benefit the party. But that\u2019s a much more uncertain proposition in 2024, as demonstrated by the latest youth poll from the Harvard Kennedy School Institute of Politics, probably the most in-depth look at attitudes among young people. In the IOP poll this spring, Biden led Trump by nearly 20 points among young adults (aged 18-29) who said they definitely plan to vote in November; that lead was comparable to Biden\u2019s advantage among all young adults in 2020. But Trump\u2019s position steadily improved as the likelihood of voting diminished, with the former president leading Biden by 2-to-1 among those who said they probably would not vote. Those who indicated they were less likely to vote tended to be young people without a college degree, non-Whites and the very youngest cohort aged 18-24. John Della Volpe, the Institute of Politics\u2019 polling director, pointed out that those youngest adults probably don\u2019t remember much about Trump\u2019s presidency. \u201cYounger voters today have a different view of Trump,\u201d said Della Volpe, who advised the Biden campaign in 2020 on young voters. \u201cThey were 10, 12, 13 years old when he descended down that escalator, when he blocked Muslims, when he pulled out of Paris [the international climate treaty], when he talked about Charlottesville. They were children. Their values don\u2019t align with his values, but there is less toxicity when you bring up his name. So there is this openness that wasn\u2019t there in the last two elections.\u201d Even as recently as 2020, Della Volpe said, Democrats could target young people with what politicians in the old big-city machines used to call a \u201cblind pull\u201d \u2014 where a party can focus on turning out everyone in a particular neighborhood because such a high percentage of them will reliably vote for them. This year, he said, with young voters, \u201cit\u2019s definitely more complicated. It\u2019s not a blind pull.\u201d Della Volpe\u2019s observation underscores how Trump\u2019s strength among irregular voters could force Democrats to reconsider their tactics. Much of the voter registration and turnout work aimed at minority and young voters has historically operated through liberal non-profit organizations that target the broad population in those groups on the assumption that most of them will ultimately favor Democrats. But this year, some Democratic strategists worry that casting such a wide net could inadvertently mobilize an unusually large number of peripheral voters who favor Trump. That could compel Democrats to switch more of their registration and turnout efforts toward explicitly partisan programs, which can target voters more precisely based on their partisanship, but which are more difficult to raise money for. \u201cYou are hearing more groups struggling because their thesis has been \u2018I take [non-profit] dollars to get, say, all non-White voters\u2019\u201d to register and turnout, said Smith of Civitech. For Republicans, the mirror image imperative is finding ways to organize the irregular Black and Latino voters showing openness to\u00a0Trump. Republicans don\u2019t have much history of courting those voters, and, ironically, any effort to do so may be impeded by the barriers to voting that many Republican-controlled states have erected since 2020. Republicans also face the complication that Trump\u2019s diversion of large amounts of his fundraising toward his legal defense may mean there\u2019s less money available to invest in on-the-ground campaign operations. That may not matter much if the combination of Trump\u2019s ubiquitous media presence and discontent with Biden\u2019s record encourages enough irregular voters open to the former president to turn out in November. Based on the results in 2018, 2020 and 2022, Democrats can feel confident that at least as many habitual voters are hostile to Trump as committed to him, particularly in most of the battleground states that will decide the election. The decisive variable for 2024 may be how many people beyond that inner core of the most reliable voters show up and whether they break for the former president as decisively as most polls now suggest.

In addition, the US unilaterally destroyed eight aerial attack drones over Yemen and the Red Sea. The coalition strikes targeted 13 Houthi targets in parts of Yemen controlled by the Iran-backed terror group. They marked the fifth round of coalition strikes against the Houthis, who have repeatedly attacked US Navy ships and commercial vessels in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden. The two waterways, separated by the Bab-el-Mandeb strait, are critical to international shipping routes. At least 16 people were killed and a further 35 wounded, by the US-UK airstrikes in the coastal city of Hodeida, Yemen, the Houthi-run news network Al-Masirah reported on Friday. The last round of strikes occurred on February 24, as the US and UK targeted Houthi weapons and radar sites. The US has tried to disrupt the Houthi\u2019s ability to target commercial vessels and US warships by going after their primary weapons, including anti-ship cruise missiles, ballistic missiles and one-way attack drones. The US has also destroyed maritime drones and underwater drones.\u00a0The resumption of strikes follows an uptick in Houthi attacks over the last week. This week, the US destroyed Houthi missile launchers in Yemen and intercepted aerial attack drones.

{"id": "2024_05_30_politics_trump-awaits-jury-verdict-analysis", "text": "The mood flips from torpor to high tension in a second on the high-security 15th floor of the grimy old Manhattan courthouse where a jury will resume deliberations on Donald Trump\u2019s fate Thursday morning. Seven men and five women jurors, headed by a foreperson who grew up in Ireland, were deep into a fourth hour of their historic task when they shattered the oppressive tedium of Wednesday afternoon. A buzzer demanding the judge\u2019s attention sounded, suddenly sending lawyers, court staff, police and reporters rushing for their seats. Then Trump arrived from his holding room, tugging heavily on his lapels. The presumptive GOP nominee sported a trademark extra-long tie \u2014 but in gold rather than his \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d campaign trail red. In the end, the alarm did not herald a verdict in the hush money trial that could brand the 45th president a convicted felon. It was a note from the jury asking for a read back of several long and dense pieces of testimony, from former tabloid kingpin David Pecker and the star prosecution witness, Trump\u2019s former fixer Michael Cohen. Their testimony gets right to the question of Trump\u2019s intent in seeking to snuff out scandalous stories about his personal life, which may shed light on the payoff to adult film star Stormy Daniels facilitated by Cohen, according to prosecutors, under his boss\u2019 orders. (Trump has denied the alleged affair with Daniels and pleaded not guilty in the case.) As Judge Juan Merchan and lawyers combed transcripts filled with complex and sometimes seedy testimony, the buzzer buzzed again, with a new request from the locked down jury. Reporters in an overflow courtroom groaned when it emerged that jurors wanted to hear Merchan\u2019s instructions \u2014 which he spent a painstaking hour reading aloud Wednesday morning \u2014 all over again. No one outside the room where 12 citizens mull a defendant\u2019s fate knows what\u2019s really going on. That didn\u2019t stop tealeaf reading on the row of television standup locations across the street. The jury\u2019s desire to wade through testimony suggested that no verdict was imminent \u2014 and that they grasped the magnitude of their duty in a case that is critical to Trump\u2019s reputation and the nation\u2019s future. Even for those armed with the publicly released courtroom transcript, Merchan\u2019s instructions were potentially confusing to the layman. The jury doesn\u2019t get a printout, according to New York law, so it\u2019s not surprising they wanted clarity. CNN senior legal analyst Elie Honig said the instructions were \u201cway too much for any human being to absorb and make sense of.\u201d The key question at the root of the trial The jury\u2019s requests highlight the big question in a prosecution that is using a novel interpretation of the law to try to hold Trump to account over the 2016 presidential election, which seems a lifetime ago. As Merchan explained, the ex-president is facing 34 charges of falsifying business records. Such an act is only a misdemeanor in New York. To convict Trump of a felony, therefore, the jury must also find that he falsified the documents to hide another crime. Prosecutors are not required to prove a secondary crime took place or even to nail down exactly what it is. In this case, the Manhattan District Attorney\u2019s Office raised the possibility of tax law infringements and the intent to falsify other documents and suggested Trump may have wanted to violate election law using \u201cunlawful\u201d means to deprive someone else of an election win. If the jury \u2014 which sat through days of testimony \u2014 needs more help, the chances of voters with only a cursory knowledge of the case forming their own strong impressions seem remote. Trump\u2019s vigil As Merchan laid out his instructions for the first time on Wednesday, Trump watched from the defense lawyers\u2019 table. He rocked back in his chair and closed his eyes, and just when it appeared he might be snoozing, shook his head contemptuously and grimaced as Merchan read out the 34th charge. At one point, Trump reached inside his jacket and pulled out a pen to write a note to his square-jawed defense lawyer Todd Blanche to his right. When his pen seemed to fail, he reached out a hand and grabbed his attorney\u2019s pen from atop his legal pad so he could scribble a message. He made sure to return Blanche\u2019s pen before returning his own to his pocket. Trump\u2019s confinement at the court all day awaiting the whims of 12 citizens of New York City \u2014 where he made his name as a tabloid-bait real estate developer \u2014 hinted at the extraordinary power imbalance revealed by this trial and his multiple legal threats. Ex-presidents cruise through life in a bubble of deference. Their magnetism lingers along with Secret Service details even after their formal powers are gone. They run on their own time and dominate every room. And Trump has long lived in rarified air, in his skyscraper penthouse, his beach club, on golf resorts boasting super-size fountains and waterfalls or on his personal Boeing. But after weeks in a courthouse built on the site of a former dungeon, Trump can only sit and watch the minutes tick by before he learns if he will enter November\u2019s election as a felon. Still, the longer the deliberations go on, the more hopes will rise in Trump\u2019s camp. They might be clutching at straws, but the ex-president\u2019s allies believe a long wait for the jury could deliver him a more favorable verdict, sources told CNN\u2019s Kristen Holmes. \u201cLook, it was possible the jury was going to come back, guilty verdict in 45 minutes \u2014 every minute after that gives some hope (for a hung jury),\u201d one adviser said. The ex-president\u2019s only way of letting off steam is in a pen outside Merchan\u2019s courtroom, where he stands behind crash barriers in front of a pool of cameras and blasts the judge, the case, and falsely claims the entire process is proof of a plot by President Joe Biden to stop him from reclaiming the presidency in November. Trump\u2019s routine \u2014 aimed at voters as he seeks to delegitimize the case before the jury makes up its mind \u2014 is getting old. One new wrinkle Wednesday was his warning that the jury instructions could doom his defense. \u201cMother Theresa could not beat these charges. These charges are rigged.\u201d The jury hears none of this, so it\u2019s clear Trump is playing an outside political game. The presumptive GOP nominee\u2019s immediate fate is in the hands of jurors who were cross-examined for signs of political bias before the trial began and include a West Harlem man who works in sales, a young female teacher and a speech therapist. Two of the jurors are attorneys and could potentially give deliberations some structure, according to Jeff Swartz, a former Florida judge. \u201cIf the two lawyers agree with each other, that is where the jury is going to go,\u201d Swartz told CNN on Wednesday. Merchan told jurors\u00a0before sending them off to deliberate,\u00a0\u201cYou are asked to make a very important decision about another member of the community.\u201d Despite his fame, wealth and power, that is exactly who Trump is \u2014 just a lonely defendant awaiting a jury\u2019s verdict.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/30/politics/trump-awaits-jury-verdict-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/01/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_30_politics_bob-menendez-trial-nadine-texts", "text": "They had only been dating for a few months, but Nadine Arslanian, who would eventually become Sen. Bob Menendez\u2019s second wife, had a very particular request for the New Jersey Democrat. In a 2018 text message about his upcoming remarks at the Egyptian Embassy, Arslanian asked, \u201ccould you please\u201d discuss Cairo\u2019s improving relations with the International Monetary Fund and other capital projects, including the \u201cnew Suez Canal.\u201d Menendez seemed puzzled. \u201cReally???\u201d he replied. One minute later, according to court documents, the top-ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign\u00a0Relations Committee went online and searched \u201cEgypt and International Monetary Fund.\u201d He then clicked on a page titled \u201cFrequently Asked Questions on Egypt and the IMF.\u201d Nadine offered one final push in the exchange. \u201cWill said please just speak about the IMF. That\u2019s important,\u201d she told the senator, referring to Wael \u201cWill\u201d Hana,\u201d a co-defendant of the senator\u2019s at his corruption trial. The third week of that sprawling trial has featured hundreds of text messages, emails, images and voicemails sent between the senator, his future wife, Hana and an array of friends and business\u00a0associates with alleged roles in the bribery scheme at the heart of the government\u2019s case. Nadine Menendez, though, has been the central character in the communications, alternately cooing in French at her new boyfriend on phone calls, trying to facilitate meetings between Menendez and Egyptian officials, and asking for Menendez\u2019s prayers \u2013 adding that his were almost always answered. Attorneys on both sides have battled over the nature of Nadine\u2019s role in what prosecutors described as the senator\u2019s \u201cpolitics-for-profit\u201d operation \u2013 an enterprise, they say, that secured the couple hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes. In exchange for gold bars, cash, a $60,000 luxury car and more, prosecutors allege, Menendez, 70, acted as an agent of the Egyptian government and delivered a slew of favors for friends in the US, including Hana, who enjoyed a monopoly in the lucrative business of halal meat certification. The senator and his co-defendants have all denied any wrongdoing. Prosecutors have called Nadine, who is also charged but is not slated to go on trial until late July, a mere \u201cgo-between\u201d for Menendez\u2019s corrupt acts. The defense has portrayed her as more involved and connected \u2013 a force behind the alleged crimes, parlaying her romance with the senator into a series of gifts and loans from local businessmen in exchange for her cajoling him to deliver, with a blinkered view of the wider arrangement, on her promises. \u2018My very handsome senator\u2019 Over three days, prosecutor Paul Monteleoni and FBI special agent Michael Coughlin, from the witness stand, went line-by-line through hundreds of pages of correspondence. When Menendez lawyer Avi Weitzman rose Thursday to cross-examine Coughlin, he argued that the documents on display had been cherry-picked by prosecutors, stripped of context, and given to misleading conclusions. The unique dynamics of Menendez\u2019s relationship were on display in the missives. In late February 2018, shortly after they began dating, Nadine left the senator a voice message. \u201cIt\u2019s me calling my very handsome senator,\u201d she said, \u201cI have a favor to ask you. Hopefully, you can do it.\u201d The ask was for Menendez to meet with Egyptian Maj. Gen. Khaled Shawky at the Arab state\u2019s embassy. Even 25 minutes would do, Nadine said, mostly because Shawky would require \u201csome kind of clearance from Egypt\u201d to hold the conversation outside the building. She told the senator it would \u201cnot (be) worth the trip\u201d to Washington, DC, if he couldn\u2019t be in attendance for the meeting with Shawky, before signing off, \u201cI miss you.\u201d A few weeks earlier, before their romantic relationship had begun in earnest, Nadine texted Menendez to celebrate the Justice Department\u2019s dismissal of outstanding bribery charges against him. The case had ended in a 2017 mistrial, and the DOJ decision meant Menendez could run for another term without the specter of a retrial hanging over his head. (The couple married in 2020.) \u201cNow re-election!!!!\u201d Nadine wrote to Menendez, who asked her if she was \u201caround on Friday?\u201d On Saturday, after they got together for dinner in New Jersey, Nadine texted with a pair of questions for Menendez. First, she asked if he knew Albio Sires, then a US House member representing Menendez\u2019s old congressional district. Then she asked: \u201cWhat is your international position?\u201d \u201cI know him well,\u201d Menendez said of Sires, before sharing his title. \u201cI\u2019m the ranking member,\u201d he wrote, \u201cwhich means senior democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.\u201d In response, the sender \u2013 whom Menendez presumably believed was Nadine \u2013\u00a0revealed his identity. \u201cSenator,\u201d he wrote, \u201cI\u2019m using Nadine\u2019s phone but I\u2019m Andy Aslanian. I am now the U.S. attorney for the government of Egypt ministry of defense in EPO office in Washington, D.C.\u201d Aslanian, a New Jersey attorney, added: \u201cWe can definitely help you with your election campaign. We should get together and those arrangements can be made through Nadine.\u201d Apparently unruffled, Menendez greeted Aslanian and commented, \u201cBased on your last name, I guess you\u2019re related\u201d to Nadine. (They are not. Nadine\u2019s last name was Arslanian; her friend\u2019s is Aslanian.) Still, Menendez told Aslanian he \u201cwould be happy to meet\u201d him and would \u201carrange (it) through Nadine.\u201d More favors There would be more favors over the coming months, as their romance took flight. For \u201cmon amour,\u201d as they frequently addressed one another, Menendez enlisted staffers in his office to spruce up Nadine\u2019s resume as she tried to build up her consulting business. And he ghost-wrote or copy edited, depending on whose story in the correspondence one believes, a letter to his own committee \u2013 on behalf of Egyptian interests who passed along the document to Nadine, who forwarded it to Menendez \u2013\u00a0about a hold on $300 million\u00a0in US military aid to Cairo. On May 7, 2018, Nadine called Menendez and the new couple spoke for 12 minutes, according to phone records. \u201cHe said he\u2019s waiting for an answer,\u201d Nadine texted Hana almost immediately after her call with the senator had ended. \u201cAs soon as he gets it he will call me.\u201d Shortly thereafter, she sent Hana details about the embassy provided to her by Menendez, who had asked a committee staffer for the information. The defense has argued that the figures cited \u2013 regarding the number of US and Egyptian staff \u2013 were publicly available, but an exchange between the staffer and the State Department suggests the query was, at the least, unusual. \u201cDon\u2019t know why I\u2019m asking,\u201d the staffer wrote to his colleague after passing along the question. After being pressed, though, he spilled the beans: \u201cMenendez is asking.\u201d Over time, as the circle of alleged conspirators became better acquainted, their interactions began to sour. More often, Nadine became angry with Hana and others \u2013 and took those frustrations to Menendez. In March 2019, Nadine texted the senator to complain about Hana. \u201cCan you believe Wael said he does not need me to make appointments with you\u201d? she asked. \u201cThe man has gone crazy after everything I\u2019ve done for him.\u201d Menendez agreed. \u201cHe is crazy,\u201d the senator replied. Hana, seated behind Menendez now in the courtroom, smirked as Coughlin read the exchange Wednesday. Managing their relationship with Nadine eventually became a focal point for the alleged co-conspirators and their allies. New Jersey attorney Howard Dorian, an associate of Hana\u2019s, texted another man asking him to get a \u201ccarpeting\u201d job done for Nadine. \u201cIt is extremely important,\u201d Dorian wrote, \u201cwe keep Nadine happy.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/30/politics/bob-menendez-trial-nadine-texts/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/01/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_31_politics_trump-conviction-consequences-analysis", "text": "Donald Trump\u2019s first act on becoming a convicted criminal was to launch a raging new attack on the rule of law, laying bare the gravity of the choice awaiting America\u2019s voters. In one sense, Trump\u2019s conviction on all counts in his first criminal trial affirmed the principle on which the United States is founded \u2014 that everyone is equal and that no one, not even a billionaire and former and possibly future president, enjoys impunity. But Trump\u2019s authoritarian outburst minutes after the guilty verdict in New York and a race by top Republicans to join his assault on the justice system underscore how threatened those bedrock values now are. \u201cThis was a rigged, disgraceful trial. The real verdict is going to be November 5, by the people, and they know what happened here and everybody knows what happened here,\u201d Trump said minutes after a jury foreperson announced he was guilty on 34 felony charges of falsifying business records to hide a hush money payment to an adult film star. After returning to Trump Tower and greeting supporters with a clenched fist, Trump issued a written statement that made clear that he views his own fate and the nation\u2019s as indistinguishable \u2014 a familiar hallmark of a dictatorial leader. \u201cI\u2019m a very innocent man, and it\u2019s okay, I\u2019m fighting for our country. I\u2019m fighting for our Constitution. Our whole country is being rigged right now,\u201d Trump wrote. President Joe Biden\u2019s campaign echoed his opponent\u2019s belief that the ultimate judgment on the former president will come in the general election. \u201cToday\u2019s verdict does not change the fact that the American people face a simple reality,\u201d said campaign communications director Michael Tyler. \u201cThere is still only one way to keep Donald Trump out of the Oval Office: at the ballot box. Convicted felon or not, Trump will be the Republican nominee for president,\u201d Tyler said. \u201cThe threat Trump poses to our democracy has never been greater.\u201d A moment of personal anguish with national consequences Trump\u2019s conviction by a unanimous New York jury was the most painful low of a tumultuous life of denying accountability that has seen financial boom and bust, three marriages, television stardom, frequent brushes with the law, the triumph of his outsider 2016 election win, a norm-shattering presidency and an attempt to destroy democracy to stay in power after losing in 2020. Judging by his red-faced shock outside the courtroom, the verdict was a moment of personal anguish. Given that he\u2019s got a good chance of being the next president, it is sure to become a grave national test as well. Trump had pleaded not guilty in a trial that is one of four criminal cases entangled with the 2024 presidential election and the only one likely to see a jury before the election. Responses to any motions from the defense in the hush money case are due by June 27 \u2014 the day of the first presidential debate, hosted by CNN. Trump\u2019s sentencing hearing is set for July 11, just days before he\u2019ll secure the nomination at the Republican National Convention and around when he\u2019s said he\u2019d announce his vice presidential pick. Already, his legal defenses have morphed with his political strategy in a narrative of political persecution, and he is vowing that he will devote a possible second term to \u201cretribution\u201d against his foes. Among an electorate that Trump has constantly polarized, the verdict is likely to be greeted with fury by his supporters and jubilation by his critics. But in truth, this is a somber and even tragic passage of US history. Americans have never seen an ex-president convicted of a crime, and a country already torn apart by bitter political and cultural polarization is likely in for a rocky time. The implications are enormous. They begin with the potential consequences for an election in five months that could be decided by the shift of just a few thousand votes in a few states. Trump has been preparing voters for months for the possibility that he would be found guilty in a case that prosecutors said centered around a bid to mislead voters in 2016. He\u2019s claimed his four criminal indictments are a plot by Biden to destroy him. In essence, he\u2019s been working to shatter his greatest norm yet \u2014 the idea that it would be unthinkable for a felon to serve as president. No one can know how voters will react to Trump\u2019s latest moment of ignominy. His conviction will certainly energize his loyal base and his campaign will try to create a backlash to the verdict among more moderate voters. If they succeed, Thursday could come to be remembered as the day Biden lost the election. Or, the guilty verdict could play into Biden\u2019s campaign theme that his predecessor is too corrupt and extreme to serve as president again. Moderate and suburban voters whom Trump has always struggled to attract could be further alienated. But Trump\u2019s tactics and his capacity to shape the views of his supporters \u2014 with the aid of the conservative media machine \u2014 will inevitably mean that the legal system will join the electoral system as another essential institution of American governance that is now viewed as illegitimate by millions of citizens. And if it is Trump who raises his hand to swear to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution on January 20 as the 47th president, America will be led by a criminal whose duties will include being the symbolic head of the justice system. The danger is acute because with his attempt to stay in power after losing the 2020 election, Trump has already shown he will do what it takes to save himself, even if his actions catastrophically hurt democratic institutions. Profound reverberations of the Trump trial verdict CNN presidential historian Timothy Naftali said Thursday that Trump\u2019s call to arms for a campaign against the legal system will mean that every Republican will be forced to put it at the center of their 2024 campaigns. \u201cThat is going to create, in my view, a torrent of poison that will be likely worse than we saw in the \u2018Stop the Steal\u2019 campaign that preceded January 6. And that is going to further unsettle an already sensitive country,\u201d Naftali said. \u201cI worry about it because the \u2018Stop the Steal\u2019 campaign created widespread doubt about the honesty of our electoral system and led many people to believe that fraud had been committed in 2020.\u201d A question that long hovered over this trial is whether the crime \u2014 falsifying financial records to hide a hush money payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels to mislead voters in 2016 \u2014 was sufficiently serious for Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg to risk the extraordinary political consequences of indicting an ex-president. Prosecutors\u2019 use of Trump\u2019s former fixer Michael Cohen as their star witness, despite his own conviction on tax charges and for lying to Congress, was deeply controversial. Trump\u2019s lawyer Todd Blanche told CNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins Thursday that the timing of the trial \u2014 in the middle of an election campaign \u2014 was unfair to the ex-president. But the charges were not just cooked up by prosecutors as Trump claimed. They were brought by a grand jury. The ex-president was offered the presumption of innocence until proven guilty, and he was judged by a jury of his peers. Even now, the Constitution he claims has been hijacked will protect him with a full array of appeals, as in all of his other criminal cases. But once a jury has delivered a verdict, justice is considered served. So the immediate Republican attacks on the judge, the court and the verdict represent an extraordinary effort by one of the country\u2019s two major political parties to turn against the integrity of the legal system. The GOP is showing \u2014 after failing to convict Trump in two impeachments and after many of its most prominent members repeated his lies about the 2020 election \u2014 that there is nothing that he can do that will sever the party\u2019s cult-like embrace of its leader. This suggests that any Trump second term would feature even fewer constraints than his wild first one. And it raises questions about his claim to be running a \u201claw and order\u201d campaign. One of the first Republicans to react was New York Rep. Elise Stefanik, the House GOP conference chair who is seen as a possible Trump vice presidential pick. \u201cToday\u2019s verdict shows how corrupt, rigged, and un-American the weaponized justice system has become under Joe Biden and Democrats,\u201d Stefanik said. \u201cFrom the start, the weaponized scales of justice were stacked against President Trump.\u201d House Speaker Mike Johnson, who traveled to support Trump during his trial and helped to fuel false claims of electoral fraud in 2020, brought the symbolic weight of his office to support Trump and attack the legal system. \u201cToday is a shameful day in American history. Democrats cheered as they convicted the leader of the opposing party on ridiculous charges, predicated on the testimony of a disbarred, convicted felon. This was a purely political exercise, not a legal one,\u201d the Louisiana Republican claimed. Another top Trump ally, South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, said there was never a chance of a fair trial in a city which drew its jury pool from one of the most liberal areas in America. \u201cThis verdict says more about the system than the allegations. It will be seen as politically motivated and unfair, and it will backfire tremendously on the political Left,\u201d Graham said. \u201cThis is a mockery of justice.\u201d Graham\u2019s comment promoted an idea that\u2019s taken hold among conservatives that a Republican leader can only get a fair trial if they are judged in a jurisdiction where they are popular \u2014 a proposition that would effectively permanently politicize justice. One Republican who refused to join the rush to trash the verdict is former \ufeffMaryland Gov. Larry Hogan, who\u2019s running for Senate. \u201cAt this dangerously divided moment in our history, all leaders\u2014regardless of party\u2014must not pour fuel on the fire with more toxic partisanship,\u201d Hogan said in a statement ahead of the verdict being announced. Chris LaCivita, a senior adviser to Trump\u2019s campaign wrote on X: \u201cYou just ended your campaign.\u201d Hogan\u2019s comment would once have been a standard Republican reaction to the conviction of a top-level politician. In another age, a guilty verdict would have immediately ended Trump\u2019s campaign. The fact that the newly convicted criminal is already using it as a springboard to power speaks to volatile days ahead. \u201cThis verdict shows two different things,\u201d Naftali said. \u201cThe first is that the former president can be indicted and found guilty by a group of his peers. And that shows the strength of our system. The other verdict, though, hasn\u2019t come in and the other verdict is, can the powerful use our political system to escape the consequences of being found guilty? And that verdict is in November.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/31/politics/trump-conviction-consequences-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/01/2024", "section": "politics"}}

New Yorker Ade Salim Lilly, 35, was arrested in Puerto Rico in November and pleaded guilty Thursday to two charges, including interstate communications with a threat to kidnap or injure as well as repeated telephone calls. The targets of the phone calls were not named in court filings. Authorities say Lilly masked his phone number to trick congressional staff into answering his calls. \u201cMost of these phone calls were answered by congressional staff members or interns,\u201d the Justice Department said in a statement Thursday. \u201cIn some of these telephone calls, Lilly became angry and used vulgar and harassing language towards the individual who answered the phone. Congressional staff repeatedly asked Lilly to refrain from calling. U.S. Capitol Police informed Lilly on multiple occasions that his phone calls were unwanted, and due to a harassing nature, were prohibited by law.\u201d In one call, authorities said Lilly threatened a staffer, saying: \u201cI will kill you, I am going to run you over, I will kill you with a bomb or grenade.\u201d He also called one member of Congress more than 500 times over two days, authorities said.

{"id": "2024_05_31_politics_trump-special-counsel-gag-order-classified-documents", "text": "Special counsel Jack Smith has once again asked the federal judge overseeing the classified documents case against Donald Trump to impose a gag order against the former president, barring him from making statements about the law enforcement officers who searched his Mar-a-Lago resort. The gag order request is focused on false or misleading statements Trump has made about the 2022 search of Mar-a-Lago, including that his life was in danger because of a policy in place around the use of deadly force during the\u00a0search. Prosecutors say Trump\u2019s comments in recent weeks have \u201cendangered law enforcement officers involved in the investigation and prosecution of this case and threatened the integrity of these proceedings.\u201d Trump is charged in the case with taking classified national defense documents from the White House after he left office and resisting the government\u2019s attempts to retrieve the materials. He has pleaded not guilty. The request comes one week after Smith\u2019s initial attempt for a gag order, which Judge Aileen Cannon quickly shot down for procedural reasons, and is almost identical to the original request. In her ruling earlier this week, Cannon bashed prosecutors for failing to make a sufficient effort to discuss their motion with Trump\u2019s defense attorneys before filing. The judge said prosecutors could refile their motion once that effort had been made properly. Prosecutors now say they discussed the motion with Trump\u2019s attorneys but failed to resolve the issues. While Trump has told his supporters he could have been in danger during the search because of the use-of-force policy, the policy is standard protocol for FBI searches and limits how agents may use force in search operations.\u00a0The same standard FBI policy was used in the searches of President Joe Biden\u2019s homes and offices in\u00a0a separate\u00a0classified documents investigation. Trump, according to prosecutors, has made false claims that have created \u201ca grossly misleading impression about the intentions and conduct of federal law enforcement agents\u2014falsely suggesting that they were complicit in a plot to assassinate him\u2014and expose those agents, some of whom will be witnesses at trial, to the risk of threats, violence, and harassment.\u201d Prosecutors also repeated their concern that Trump\u2019s \u201cdeceptive and inflammatory claims\u201d expose agents involved in the case to \u201cunjustified and unacceptable risks,\u201d including threats and harassment. In a statement from defense attorneys in the prosecutors\u2019 filing, Trump\u2019s lawyers reiterated their stance that the gag order \u201cis a blatant violation of the First Amendment rights of President Trump and the American People, which would in effect allow President Trump\u2019s political opponent to regulate his campaign communications to voters across the country.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/31/politics/trump-special-counsel-gag-order-classified-documents/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/01/2024", "section": "politics"}}
