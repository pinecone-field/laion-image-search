The\u00a0first\u00a0was a slightly vaguer than usual version of his\u00a0familiar\u00a0lie that he won Wisconsin in the 2020 presidential election. He lost the state\u00a0by\u00a020,682\u00a0votes. The second was a version of a false claim Trump\u00a0delivered\u00a0in 2020 and again in 2022: his\u00a0assertion\u00a0that he had saved the Wisconsin city of Kenosha from destruction in 2020 when Gov. Tony Evers, a Democrat, refused to take action to deal with the civil unrest that followed the police shooting of a Black man. \u201cBy the way, you know, Kenosha: I saved Kenosha, do you know that? When I was president. Right? Right? I saved it,\u201d Trump\u00a0said\u00a0Tuesday. \u201cKenosha was \u2014 Kenosha was about ready to go down the tubes and the governor wouldn\u2019t move, he just wouldn\u2019t move, and I moved. You know, I\u2019m not supposed to; it\u2019s supposed to be the governor, is supposed to do it, the mayor and the governor.\u201d Facts First:\u00a0Trump\u2019s claims that Evers \u201cwouldn\u2019t move\u201d and that Trump was the person who \u201csaved Kenosha\u201d are false, as numerous fact-checkers\u00a0pointed out\u00a0when he made similar claims\u00a0in\u00a02020. Evers, not Trump, deployed the Wisconsin National Guard during the rioting in Kenosha \u2014 and Evers first deployed the\u00a0Guard the day before Trump publicly demanded that Evers do so. In other words, Trump insisted that Evers do something that he was already doing. Trump has repeatedly made a near-identical false claim about another state, Minnesota, that had a Democratic governor and civil unrest in 2020. Though Trump has asserted that he deployed the National Guard to Minneapolis over the objection of Gov. Tim Walz,\u00a0it was Walz who deployed the\u00a0Guard to Minneapolis hours before Trump demanded that he do so. The 2020\u00a0unrest in Kenosha, which involved both peaceful protests and acts of violence and vandalism, followed the police shooting of Jacob Blake by a White police officer who was\u00a0responding to a domestic disturbance call on August 23, 2020. (State and federal law enforcement later\u00a0decided\u00a0not to file charges against the officer.) On Tuesday, after Trump repeated his false claim, the governor\u2019s office provided CNN with the same\u00a0timeline it had sent to reporters when Trump had made the claim in 2020. The timeline, which is corroborated by public evidence, conclusively debunks Trump\u2019s narrative. Trump\u00a0tweeted\u00a0on the night of August 25, 2020, that the\u00a0\u201cgovernor should call in the National Guard in Wisconsin.\u201d But the governor had already done so by then.\u00a0Evers authorized the deployment of 125 Wisconsin National Guard troops\u00a0just after 3 a.m.\u00a0the\u00a0day prior to the tweet, then\u00a0doubled\u00a0the deployment to 250 troops on the afternoon of the tweet \u2013 more than four hours before Trump weighed in. Evers continued to deploy more Wisconsin National Guard troops in the coming days, and he also\u00a0accepted\u00a0National Guard troops from three other states; they were never federalized. Evers did accept limited federal assistance from the\u00a0US Marshals Service\u00a0and the FBI, his office said, but that\u2019s no basis for Trump\u2019s claims that he saved the city when Evers wouldn\u2019t. The idea that the city\u2019s very existence was ever threatened is also\u00a0questionable, but we\u2019ll leave that aside here. Other Trump false claims Trump made lots of other false claims during the Racine rally. Here\u2019s a quick fact check on 12 of them: \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He\u00a0said\u00a0\u201cthe world was at peace\u201d when he was president in 2020, though there\u00a0were\u00a0numerous ongoing armed conflicts. \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He\u00a0said\u00a0Democrats rigged the 2020 election, which did not happen. \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He\u00a0said\u00a0people\u2019s votes \u201ctend to disappear\u201d after they are cast, which is just not true. \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He\u00a0said\u00a0the country is \u201cin the middle of the worst crime wave in modern history,\u201d though preliminary statistics show crime\u00a0declined sharply in 2023 and the\u00a0first quarter of 2024. \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He\u00a0said\u00a0he has been indicted more times than notorious gangster Al Capone, who was\u00a0indicted at least six times to Trump\u2019s four. \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He\u00a0said\u00a0somebody left cocaine at the White House \u201cabout a month ago,\u201d though that\u00a0happened about 11 months ago, and\u00a0said\u00a0it was \u201chundreds of thousands of dollars worth of cocaine,\u201d though photos show the cocaine was in a\u00a0small bag\u00a0worth nothing even remotely close to that amount. \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He\u00a0said\u00a0he went to Washington, DC, the other day for one of his trials, though the trip\u00a0was actually for meetings with congressional Republicans. \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He\u00a0said\u00a0then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi turned down his offer of 10,000 soldiers at the Capitol January 6, 2021; there is\u00a0no evidence she ever received such an offer, and she wouldn\u2019t have had the power to reject it if she did. \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He\u00a0said\u00a0no previous president had taken even 10 cents \u201cout of China\u201d from tariffs; the US\u00a0has had tariffs on China since the 1700s\u00a0and generated billions per year from them under predecessor President Barack Obama \u2014 and study after study has shown that Americans pay the tariffs, not China. \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He\u00a0said\u00a0Syria and Turkey have been fighting over their border \u201cfor 2,000 years,\u201d though\u00a0historians have said this is nonsense:\u00a0Turkey and Syria were both part of the Ottoman Empire, and the modern border between them is less than 100 years old. \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He\u00a0said\u00a0he thinks cumulative inflation under Biden is \u201c40 or 50 percent\u201d; it\u2019s\u00a0actually about 19%.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/19/politics/fact-check-trump-rewrites-wisconsin-history/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "politics"}}

As the one time Trump adviser prepares to report to prison next Monday for defying a congressional subpoena in a separate case, Judge Juan Merchan will no longer handle his trial in the same courthouse where the former president was convicted. Merchan was not removed from the case, but has another case that conflicts with Bannon\u2019s trial, according to the office of court administration. The administrative judge\u00a0for the\u00a0New York County Supreme Court Criminal Term notified the parties in an email Friday saying the reassignment\u00a0will \u201cbest serve the needs of the Court.\u201d \u201cThe Honorable Juan M. Merchan, Acting Supreme Court Justice, who is assigned to this matter, is engaged to preside over a six-defendant trial that is scheduled to commence on September 16, 2024 and expected to last at least three months,\u201d Judge Ellen Biben wrote in the email. Bannon\u2019s legal team learned on Friday about the move,\u00a0a source familiar with the matter told CNN. His criminal case is now assigned to Judge April Newbauer. Bannon has a scheduled appearance before her set for July 23. By then, he will be weeks into serving his sentence at a low-security federal prison in Danbury, Connecticut, unless the Supreme Court intervenes before Monday. Merchan had presided over Bannon\u2019s case since his arraignment in September 2022. Before it was delayed to the fall, Bannon had been scheduled to go on trial in Merchan\u2019s courtroom in May \u2013 when the judge had his hands full with Trump\u2019s seven-week trial. Bannon is accused of\u00a0defrauding donors in a fundraising effort branded the \u201cWe Build the Wall\u201d\u00a0campaign for a border wall\u00a0between the US and Mexico. Bannon pleaded not guilty in 2022 to the state charges that include money laundering, conspiracy and fraud\u00a0related to an alleged online scheme. As CNN previously reported,\u00a0the state charges are based on the same conduct Bannon was charged with by federal prosecutors in 2020 that alleged he and three others had defrauded donors in the border wall effort, which raised more than $15 million. He was later pardoned by Trump.

{"id": "2024_06_26_politics_italian-animation-company-north-korea-sanctions", "text": "An Italian animation company has agreed to pay the US Treasury Department $538,000 for \u201capparent violations\u201d of US sanctions against North Korea by doing business with a North Korean state-owned animation studio, the department said Wednesday. It\u2019s the first time Treasury has levied financial penalties related to sanctions on North Korea\u2019s movie and animation industry, which experts say has quietly done business with foreign companies for decades, bringing the isolated and nuclear-armed North Korean regime vital revenue. The Rome-based animation\u00a0firm\u00a0Mondo\u00a0TV,\u00a0S.p.a. sent wire transfers through US financial institutions to pay North Korea\u2019s flagship studio, known as SEK, about $538,000 for outsourced animation work between May 2019 and November 2021, Treasury said in a statement. To process the payments, SEK used \u201cthird-party companies\u201d in China and the US that had accounts at \u201cseveral\u201d US banks, according to Treasury. A department spokesperson declined to name the US banks. Matteo Corradi, the CEO of Mondo TV Group, declined to comment. Founded in 1985, Mondo has produced or distributed a number of popular cartoons in Italy, including an adventure\u00a0show called \u201cSandokan \u2013 The Two Tigers.\u201d While many companies unknowingly hire North Korean workers, Mondo executives were under no illusions over who they were dealing with, according to the Treasury Department. The outsourcing contract made explicit reference to North Korea, the department said.\u00a0And the business relationship between Mondo and SEK began in the 1990s, when Mondo started subcontracting animation work to SEK \u201cfor a variety of programming, including children\u2019s animation,\u201d the Treasury Department investigation found. Mondo even hosted SEK animators when they took trips to Italy for training provided by the Italian company, according to Treasury. As North Korean leader Kim Jong Un continues to flaunt his nuclear arsenal, US officials have gone to increasing lengths to\u00a0track and intercept the billions of dollars they say North Korean hackers and IT workers have stolen or surreptitiously earned abroad over the\u00a0past\u00a0several years. Mondo\u2019s use of the US financial system to send money to North Korea triggered the Treasury investigation and the threat of fines. CNN has requested comment from North Korea\u2019s diplomatic mission in London. \u201cIt\u2019s rather surprising that any European company would knowingly work with a North Korean company like this after 2013, much less believe transactions to designated third parties \u2014 especially in the US \u2014 would go unnoticed,\u201d Jenny Town, director of the Korea program at the Stimson Center think tank, told CNN, referring to United Nations sanctions imposed on North Korea in 2013. The settlement \u201cshould be a wake-up call to those who might think the sanctions regime is dead,\u201d Town said. Along with Russia, North Korea is among the most heavily sanctioned governments in the world.\u00a0But the North Korean animation industry has provided an important source of revenue for\u00a0Pyongyang, according to experts. A trove of animation sketches that researchers\u00a0found\u00a0on a North Korean computer server last year\u00a0suggests\u00a0that North Korean graphic designers may have helped produce work for US animation studios unbeknownst to those companies. Experts who analyzed the documents told CNN that workers in China may have also been involved in the outsourcing work.

{"id": "2024_06_24_politics_arizona-election-worker-arrested-maricopa-county", "text": "A temporary election worker in Arizona was arrested Saturday after allegedly stealing a security fob and keys from the Maricopa County Tabulation and Election Center, according to court documents obtained by CNN. Arizona, and Maricopa County specifically, has been a hotbed for election conspiracy theories since 2020. The Arizona secretary of state\u2019s office said in a Monday statement that the fact Maricopa officials identified this security incident showed that election safety protocols in the county are working. It came amid concerns the incident could be used to further enflame conspiracy theories in the state. Maricopa County Sheriff Russ Skinner told reporters at a Phoenix news conference Tuesday that authorities \u201cdon\u2019t have any indication at this point\u201d that the incident was politically motivated but that they were \u201cnot ruling it out.\u201d Walter Ringfield, who identified himself to police as a temporary employee of the tabulation center, faces charges of theft and criminal damage. He remains in the custody of the Maricopa County Sheriff\u2019s Office as he awaits his next court appearance due to an unrelated pending felony case against him, a local official confirmed to CNN. According to court documents, Ringfield was captured on surveillance video walking past a desk and multiple tabulators just after 5 p.m. local time on June 20. The surveillance video then shows Ringfield stopping at the desk, grabbing a lanyard with the security fob and keys attached, and placing them in his pocket, court documents say. Ringfield was confronted by his elections supervisor about taking the security fob and keys, and he allowed security to search his car. Arizona detectives ultimately executed a search warrant of Ringfield\u2019s home, where the fob was located. Bill Gates, a Maricopa County supervisor, said at the news conference Tuesday that the fob had been taken during a testing of the tabulation machines in preparation for the state\u2019s upcoming July 30 primary. The fob is part of a multi-layer security process and the fob alone would not be able to turn on a tabulation machine, Gates said. Gates said officials had briefed the county Republican and Democratic parties on the incident. He insisted that it \u201cshould not have any impact whatsoever\u201d on the primary. According to investigators, the security fobs are used in conjunction with special secure tablets during the election. Because one was removed, every fob and tablet must be reprogrammed, court documents say. A director at the elections office told investigators the estimated cost of replacing the security fobs and tablets would be more than $19,000. \u201cThe secure operation of the facility is greatly impeded until the reprogramming is completed,\u201d court documents note. Skinner said Tuesday that investigators are still combing through digital evidence and items taken via a search warrant. Skinner said investigators are also reviewing the suspect\u2019s social media and that they \u201cdon\u2019t have anything that necessarily ties into anything beyond what we have at this point.\u201d During his initial court appearance Saturday, Ringfield was informed that he would remain in custody until his next court appearance, scheduled for Thursday, because of another pending felony case against him, video from his arraignment shows. Ringfield appeared surprised when the judge notified him of the other pending case and said it was his understanding the unrelated matter had already been resolved. It was not immediately clear whether Ringfield has an attorney. In a statement to CNN, the Arizona secretary of state\u2019s office said the incident at the Maricopa County Tabulation and Election Center \u201cshould reassure the public about the effectiveness of the security measures in place.\u201d \u201cOur systems are not only designed to detect anomalies but are also supported by dedicated professionals committed to upholding the democratic process. While this event is unwelcome, it speaks the effectiveness of the security protocols built into Arizona\u2019s election systems,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThe swift actions of the Maricopa County elections staff, including the re-conducting of logic and accuracy tests, builds in extra layers of protection of all affected equipment. This quick response will prevent any potential impact on the upcoming elections,\u201d the office added. This story has been updated with additional information.

{"id": "2024_06_12_politics_autoworkers-michigan-biden-trump", "text": "Walter Robinson Jr. bets about 40% of his Ford Motor Company co-workers are for Donald Trump. He doesn\u2019t get it. \u201cDonald Trump has never had a real job before,\u201d said Robinson, a 35-year Ford employee who started on the assembly line and now works in quality control.\u00a0\u201cHe\u2019s never come in there and shot six bolts and put in four push pins 600 times a day on the assembly line.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s never shoveled crap,\u201d Robinson continued. \u201cHe\u2019s never done a hard day\u2019s work. Not physical work like you do in the plant. And he has a solid gold toilet at home. So, I mean, how can he really empathize with your life?\u201d Sometimes Robinson joins the debate along the assembly line or in the break room, pointing out President Joe Biden\u2019s long history of supporting organized labor, including his decision to join striking United Auto Workers on the picket line in Michigan during their six-week strike last year. The UAW endorsed Biden earlier this year. The retort? \u201cYou, know: guns, gays, abortion, sleepy Joe, Hunter Biden,\u201d Robinson said. \u201cThey just tell me these outlandish things that they think are important. \u2026 If Hunter Biden is such a big issue, why isn\u2019t Jared Kushner a big issue?\u201d The\u00a0autoworkers strike, which ended late last year, was a big win for the UAW.\u00a0Robinson\u00a0got a nice raise and cost of living adjustments were restored in the deal. The bigger gains went to less experienced UAW members hired after the 2008 financial crisis, when the automakers said their only path to survival was a two-tier wage and benefits system that paid new workers less. \u201cI think we got more than I thought we would,\u201d Robinson said in an interview during his lunch break at the UAW Local 900 headquarters across the street from a giant Ford assembly plant. But it didn\u2019t solve everything. \u201cGas prices are still pretty high,\u201d Robinson said. \u201cIt\u2019s just me and my wife and it\u2019s $200 every time I go to the grocery store.\u201d We met Robinson as part of a CNN project tracking the 2024 election through the eyes and experiences of voters who live in presidential battleground states and are part of key voting blocs. UAW membership is way down from Detroit\u2019s heyday, but at roughly 134,000 members in Michigan now, the union remains a political force in this swing state, which Biden won by less than 3 points in 2020 after Trump won it by less than a point four years earlier. Robinson believes the UAW leadership has improved its standing with the rank and file because of the contract gains. But he is skeptical that the UAW endorsement of Biden will sway many of his union colleagues who back Trump. \u201cYou have people in there, in the plant, who don\u2019t want to be told what to do,\u201d Robinson said. Blue-collar voters looking for politicians who understand them People like Bill Govier\u00a0from Wixom, Michigan. \u201cI love my job,\u201d said Govier, a 25-year Ford employee and UAW member who started on the assembly line and now works as a millwright. \u201cAs a skilled tradesman, I definitely love my job.\u201d Govier calls himself\u00a0\u201ca little more on the conservative side, but really close to the middle.\u201d He voted for Trump in both 2016 and 2020. \u201cI\u2019m probably more tolerant than I have ever been, but the powers that be label me as some far-right White supremacist MAGA Republican,\u201d he said. Govier also bristles at how critics label Trump. \u201cEverybody wants to say, \u2018Oh he said this, it\u2019s the nastiest thing ever.\u2019 Stop, just stop. Quit taking things out of context, read the whole thing, listen to the whole thing,\u201d Govier said. \u201cI just don\u2019t see him as the anti-Christ, or Hitler. That\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d Govier described his 2016 vote this way: \u201cI don\u2019t trust Hillary (Clinton) . \u2026 I voted against Hillary more so than for Trump.\u201d In 2020, he said he \u201cliked where the country was going,\u201d praising the pre-Covid Trump economy and how the then-president handled relations with North Korea. Now, Govier said, \u201cI\u2019m leaning away from Biden more than for Trump.\u201d Govier makes a point we hear a lot from blue-collar voters in our travels. \u201cI don\u2019t think there are a lot of people in this country under the age of 40 that really understand what it is like to work with your hands,\u201d Govier said. \u201cMost of the politicians I don\u2019t think understand it.\u00a0\u2026 So, it is hard for guys like us to feel represented properly.\u201d Before committing to vote for Trump in 2024, Govier said he wants to research independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. But he said he would be hesitant to vote third party if he believed it might help Biden. \u201cI would really rather have Kennedy,\u201d he said. But if voting for him boosts Biden, he added, \u201cI might have to vote for Trump.\u201d Chris Vitale has no hesitation about his 2024 choice: he will proudly vote for Trump a third time. \u201cI\u2019m sort of the hands of the engineer,\u201d is how he describes his job doing mechanical work in the engine development shop at Stellantis, the parent company of Chrysler. He is a 30-year Chrysler employee and 30-year UAW member. Vitale blames Democrats for his Trump support. Gone from the party, he says, are people like former Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt, who twice unsuccessfully sought the Democratic presidential nomination, first in 1988. \u201cHe raised a lot of midwestern manufacturing concerns with NAFTA and things like that,\u201d Vitale said of Gephardt. \u201cSo what happened to those Democrats? Those are the Democrats I wanted to vote for. They\u2019re gone now.\u201d Vitale said he initially viewed Trump as \u201cjust another distraction, a sideshow or something\u201d early in the 2016 race. But then he heard Trump talk tough on trade and promise to revive American manufacturing. \u201cI\u2019ve watched this region go from the arsenal of democracy,\u201d Vitale said. \u201cI watched it go from that realm of importance to now we\u2019re happy we can get a sports stadium or we\u2019re going to sell weed or fireworks. It\u2019s absolutely pathetic what we have sunk to and our politicians, they\u2019re good with it. He isn\u2019t. So that is the difference.\u201d Vitale said Biden policies that he argues are hurting the industry are more important to him than the president\u2019s decision to show up at a UAW picket line. \u201cI think the government seems to be appeasing the coasts,\u201d Vitale said during an interview in St. Clair Shores, a town in battleground Macomb County just north of Detroit. \u201cYou know, everyone who lives in Manhattan thinks everyone should drive an electric car. Everyone who lives in Los Angeles thinks the world is coming to an end and you can\u2019t have any more internal combustion engine cars. \u2026 The middle of the country, which used to be the manufacturing base of this country, doesn\u2019t feel that way, doesn\u2019t operate that way. So there is a huge divide.\u201d Vitale said a Trump win would mean an end to requirements for automakers to sell more EVs and, he believes, trade policies designed to protect American jobs. \u201cWe\u2019ve got the government against us at every turn,\u201d Vitale said. \u201cI can\u2019t believe the people who are responsible for regulating our industries are so out of tune with our industries.\u201d Union leadership\u2019s endorsement only goes so far Bob King sees a profound disconnect between Trump\u2019s words and actions \u2013 or inactions \u2013 and he hopes the UAW leadership hones in on that as it sells its endorsement of Biden over the final five months of the campaign. King worked at Ford for more than 40 years and was UAW president for four years during the Obama presidency, when the auto industry \u2013 and the UAW \u2013 were reeling from the 2008 global financial crisis. That is when the two-tiered contracts went into effect, and King sees both a financial and a psychological hit that caused disaffection among blue collar workers \u2013 and ultimately drove many to Trump. \u201cThey are listening because they don\u2019t believe anybody has delivered for them,\u201d King said in an interview. \u201cPeople feel like the establishment hasn\u2019t been delivering for them. Is your life better now than it was 10 years ago? For many working people, it is worse. Their standard of living has deteriorated. In some cases, their communities have deteriorated.\u201d The new contract, King argues, erases most of the concessions made after the financial crisis and, in his view, should boost the standing of the current UAW leadership as it makes the case Biden is better than Trump for union workers. Tonya Rincon isn\u2019t so sure of that. \u201cThe leadership gives their advice and their official endorsement and in the rank and file it goes about 50-50,\u201d said Rincon, a 30-year Ford worker and UAW member. \u201cAnd it will probably go 50-50 this time.\u201d Perhaps, she said, the president\u2019s decision to visit the picket line will help a tad. \u201cMaybe it will move a small percentage and Michigan is a state where small percentages matter,\u201d she said in an interview in the Local 900 union hall. \u201cSo maybe it will be 51-49. But I don\u2019t think it moved a lot of people.\u201d Rincon is committed to Biden. \u201cBecause I think he does care about working men and women,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat he is doing for our kids, with helping to arrest out-of-control student debt. \u2026 Everything he stands for. It aligns with my values. So he has my support.\u201d Objections to Biden among Ford colleagues include the administration\u2019s aggressive support of shifting to EVs. Rincon disagrees with that critique. \u201cI think we should have as many options for drivers as they want to have,\u201d Rincon said. \u201cWe need to build cars and we need to paint them and put them on drive trains, regardless of what kind of engine they have. So it is not going to cost us jobs.\u201d Like Robinson, she rolls her eyes at colleagues who say Trump understands them better. \u201cHe\u2019s stiffed working men and women his entire business career,\u201d Rincon said. \u201cSo I don\u2019t understand that.\u201d But she went on, like King, to suggest some of Trump\u2019s support stems from worries among voters that growing up in communities like Wayne isn\u2019t as safe a bet as it once was. \u201cI didn\u2019t go to college after high school,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I bummed around working a bunch of crappy retail jobs and service jobs. \u2026 And then I lucked out, started a family and needed a good paying job. So I got into the plant.\u201d But that path to middle class security isn\u2019t as guaranteed as it once was. \u201cFor about the last 15 years that hasn\u2019t really been the reality,\u201d Rincon said, because of the two-tier wage and benefits system. \u201cPeople were making as little working on the line now as I made 30 years ago when I started, which is kind of crazy. So people still wanted to get to the Big Three [automakers], but the reality was they weren\u2019t making a realistic living.\u201d The new contract fixed some of those issues, and Rincon said morale is better inside the plant. \u201cIt mattered,\u201d she said, that Biden came out to support the strikers. But did it change the conversation about the president? \u201cInside the plants?\u201d Rincon said. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think it did.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/12/politics/autoworkers-michigan-biden-trump/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_25_politics_biden-expected-pardon-veterans-convicted-gay-sex-law", "text": "President\u00a0Joe Biden\u00a0is pardoning US\u202fveterans who were convicted by the military over a 60-year period under a military law that banned gay sex, three US officials told CNN. In a statement on Wednesday, Biden said he was \u201crighting an historic wrong\u201d by pardoning service members \u201cwho were convicted simply for being themselves.\u201d \u201cOur nation\u2019s service members stand on the frontlines of freedom, and risk their lives in order to defend our country. Despite their courage and great sacrifice, thousands of LGBTQI+ service members were forced out of the military because of their sexual orientation or gender identity. \u2026 This is about dignity, decency, and ensuring the culture of our Armed Forces reflect the values that make us an exceptional nation,\u201d he said. The proclamation\u00a0is\u00a0set to affect roughly 2,000 people, according to a US official.\u00a0The granting of pardons won\u2019t automatically change convicted veterans\u2019 records but allows those impacted to apply for a certificate of pardon that will help them receive withheld benefits. The pardon, which CNN was first to report on, specifically grants clemency to service members who were convicted under former Uniform Code of Military Justice Article 125 \u2014\u202fwhich criminalized sodomy, including between consenting adults\u00a0\u2014\u202fbetween\u00a01951 and 2013 when it was rewritten by Congress. It also applies to those who were convicted of attempting to commit those offenses. Anyone who was convicted of a non-consensual act such as rape will not be pardoned. A senior administration official told reporters on Tuesday that they\u00a0are also\u00a0working to address cases in which LGBTQ+ service members were convicted under other UCMJ charges than Article 125, such as conduct unbecoming an officer. The official said individuals who may have been convicted of other charges \u201cbased on their sexual orientation or gender identity\u201d can go through the normal pardon process at the Department of Justice. \u201cWe\u2019re already doing work with DOJ to make sure that those applications as they come in are flagged and expedited, but we recognize this is limited,\u201d they said. Separately, the law known as \u201cDon\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell\u201d was repealed by Congress in 2011, but not before thousands of service members had been discharged from the military. A service member\u2019s discharge status can determine what kind of Veterans Affairs benefits they are eligible for. A bad-conduct discharge, for example, given under general court-martial, can make someone\u202fineligible\u202ffor services including a VA home loan military pension,\u00a0and education benefits. The pardon is separate from the Pentagon\u2019s ongoing review of military records for those who were discharged based on their sexual orientation, which another US official said did not apply to convictions under the UCMJ. The Pentagon launched a new outreach campaign last September to reach more veterans who believe they \u201csuffered an error or injustice\u201d to have their military records reviewed. \u201cFor decades, our LGBTQ+ service members were forced to hide or were prevented from serving altogether,\u201d Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said at the time. \u201cEven still, they selflessly put themselves in harm\u2019s way for the good of our country and the American people.\u201d In order to get their records changed under the pardon, individuals will need to complete an online application, which will go to their military service department. The services will then review the individual\u2019s court-martial and service record and determine if they are eligible for the pardon; that determination will then be sent to the attorney general,\u00a0acting through the Department of Justice\u2019s pardon attorney, a US official explained. The certificate of pardon does not automatically change someone\u2019s discharge status. If a certificate of pardon is issued, the service member will then have to apply to their respective military department\u2019s board of corrections to have their military records corrected. A second senior administration official said Tuesday that the administration is working through how best to do outreach on the\u00a0pardons\u00a0to ensure veterans know they can apply and is \u201ccommitted to making the process as accessible as possible for former military service members.\u201d The official also said the admin is \u201cthinking through\u201d getting private attorneys to work pro bono and assist veterans through the process. \u201c(T)here are a lot of private attorneys who are eager and interested in providing services to LGBTQ+ individuals and to the extent that individuals may benefit from the attorney in this process, we\u2019re just working through ways to connect those individuals with pro bono counseling,\u201d the official said.

{"id": "2024_06_26_politics_joe-biden-donald-trump-foreign-policy-debate", "text": "President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump\u2019s foreign policy positions have sometimes seemed like an afterthought in an election with domestic concerns at its heart. Yet with two hot wars, growing global instability and a right-wing tilt toward isolationism \u2013 in the US and abroad \u2013 it will be difficult for Biden and Trump to avoid the subject at Thursday night\u2019s debate in Atlanta. The Biden campaign is hoping to make domestic issues like the economy and reproductive rights the centerpieces of the president\u2019s reelection argument. But it is foreign policy that has consumed much of his time during his first term, including in the direct lead-up to Thursday\u2019s debate, when Biden embarked upon back-to-back trips to Europe. His close advisers have candidly acknowledged, particularly since October 7, that events abroad have more than once \u2013 and more than his team would like \u2013 diverted the president\u2019s attention away from important domestic issues. Unlike previous presidential election cycles, there is not a scheduled debate dedicated only to foreign policy, which in the past provided an opportunity for in-depth contrasts on world affairs between Republican and Democratic candidates. Instead, Biden advisers expect those issues could arise as part of the broader discussion that unfolds on the debate stage in Atlanta on Thursday. To that end, Jake Sullivan, the president\u2019s national security adviser, has been one of the more than dozen top advisers who has joined Biden at Camp David this week to lead the group\u2019s discussions on foreign policy, according to a source with knowledge of the preparations. As much as the Biden team would prefer to stay focused on issues close to home, it has also long viewed foreign policy as one of the clearest ways to demonstrate a contrast with Trump on presidential leadership. One campaign official told CNN that if and when foreign policy issues come up Thursday night, the contrast that Biden will try to paint could not be starker. \u201cPresident Biden stands up to dictators and defends freedom \u2013 Trump is a loser who is too dangerous and reckless to ever be anywhere close to the Oval Office again,\u201d the official said. Trump has repeatedly accused Biden of presiding over a chaotic world that, in his telling, was a lot calmer during the four years he was in office. One potential difficulty for the Biden and his advisers might be identifying Trump\u2019s positions on several foreign policy areas. He has said little of substance about the war in Gaza,\u00a0offering\u00a0light criticism of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the start of the conflict while still supporting Israel\u2019s fight against Hamas. Since then, he has taken varying positions: encouraging Israel to \u201cfinish the problem\u201d of Hamas, advising the country to \u201cstop killing people\u201d and to \u201cget it over with\u201d and suggesting Israel stop releasing videos of its efforts in Gaza to solve a PR problem \u2014\u00a0all without providing specifics. He has also vowed to crack down on pro-Palestinian protesters in the US. On Ukraine, Trump has claimed Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s invasion would never have happened while he was in office and promised he would resolve the conflict in a day \u2014 without saying how. And while he has taken a tough tone on China, pledging to enact harsh tariffs on all Chinese imports, his record as president was more conciliatory, striking a trade deal that Beijing later reneged on. The ambiguous positions Trump has taken on foreign policy reflect his approach in office, when he often cited personal sentiments and gut feelings to explain tactics like meeting with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un. But that also could make it more difficult for Biden to pin down a clear line of attack. Instead, the president is likely to play up ways in which he strengthened American leadership on the world stage, bolstered American alliances and defended democracy abroad, according to the campaign official. And on Trump, Biden is expected to deploy a broad accusation: That Trump abandoned US allies, cozied up to dictators and generally made the world less safe. \u201cDonald Trump consistently praises authoritarian leaders and dictators, pledges to sell out our allies, and undermines our democracy,\u201d the official added. Like in other areas, Biden\u2019s team has relied on Trump\u2019s own words to frame their attacks. For example, Trump\u2019s comment that he would \u201cencourage\u201d Russia to \u201cdo whatever the hell they want\u201d to NATO allies should they not spend enough on defense is a moment Biden has seized upon repeatedly in arguing against his predecessor\u2019s leadership. And Trump\u2019s vow to act as a \u201cdictator\u201d on the first day of his presidency has provided Biden an opening to warn of the global consequences should Trump return to office. Still, political risks abound for Biden in foreign affairs. The war in Gaza has caused anger among progressives, many of whom accuse Biden of fueling the humanitarian crisis by providing Israel weapons. But he\u2019s gotten little credit from Republicans, either, who have accused the president of abandoning Israel after he paused shipments of certain heavy bombs. Netanyahu has not made Biden\u2019s situation any easier by accusing the administration of delaying arms shipments and by taking ambiguous positions on a US-backed ceasefire proposal that Biden hopes can bring the fighting to an end. On Ukraine, the president has successfully rallied the west in support of Kyiv, but Trump has taken an isolationist position and opposes any additional aid. While Biden says that could leave the country vulnerable to Russian advances, Trump\u2019s position has resonated within the Republican Party \u2014 which accuses the president of ignoring problems at home while sending billions of dollars abroad. Ultimately, perhaps the greatest risk for Biden is the appearance of being overly focused on foreign issues to the detriment of the matters facing Americans every day. Speaking alongside Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at the Group of 7 summit in Italy earlier this month, Biden acknowledged the war in Ukraine had been a \u201ctest for the world,\u201d with questions of Western resolve tested amid inflation and a rise in nationalism. \u201cWould we stand with Ukraine? Would we stand for sovereignty, freedom, and against tyranny?\u201d he said. \u201cThe United States, the G7 and countries around the world have consistently answered the question by saying, \u2018Yes, we will.\u2019 And we will say it again. Yes, again and again and again.\u201d This story has been updated with additional reporting.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/26/politics/joe-biden-donald-trump-foreign-policy-debate/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "politics"}}

You can also follow\u00a0CNN\u2019s live debate coverage on\u00a0CNN.com, which will include analysis and fact checking. What were the qualifications? Biden and Trump will be the only presidential candidates participating in the debate. In order to qualify, candidates had to satisfy the requirements outlined in Article II, Section 1 of the US Constitution to serve as president, as well as file a formal statement of candidacy with the Federal Election Commission. According to parameters set by CNN in May, all participating debaters had to appear on a sufficient number of state ballots to reach the 270 electoral vote threshold to win the presidency and receive at least 15% in four separate national polls of registered or likely voters that meet CNN\u2019s standards for reporting. Polls that meet those standards are those sponsored by CNN, ABC News, CBS News, Fox News, Marquette University Law School, Monmouth University, NBC News, The New York Times/Siena College, NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist College, Quinnipiac University, The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post. Biden and Trump were the only candidates to meet those requirements. The pair has also agreed to participate in another debate hosted by ABC on September 10. What are the rules of the debate? The debate will include two commercial breaks, according to the network, and campaign staff may not interact with their candidate during that time. The candidates agreed to appear at a uniform podium. Microphones will be muted throughout the debate except for the candidate whose turn it is to speak. While no props or pre-written notes will be allowed on the stage, candidates will be given a pen, a pad of paper and a bottle of water. The event will not feature a studio audience. Catch up on CNN\u2019s recent campaign coverage Campaign promises. Ahead of the debate, Trump has made a number of ambitious promises on the campaign trail, including rolling back car pollution rules and building 10 new cities. Biden, meanwhile, has vowed to protect American democracy and pass a federal law to codify the right to an abortion into law.

{"id": "2024_06_25_politics_lauren-boebert-colorado-4-primary", "text": "Rep. Lauren Boebert will win the Republican primary in Colorado\u2019s 4th Congressional District, CNN projects, after fleeing a stiff challenge in the district she has represented for two terms. Boebert, a MAGA firebrand who barely won reelection to the 3rd\u00a0District in Colorado\u2019s Western Slope in 2022, announced in January that she would run for the open 4th District seat being vacated by Republican Ken Buck in the eastern part of the state. Buck, a fifth-term lawmaker and House Freedom Caucus member, resigned in March after lambasting his fellow Republicans on Capitol Hill for parroting former President Donald Trump\u2019s lies about widespread fraud in the 2020 election. His resignation triggered a special election to fill the remaining months of his term \u2013 though Boebert opted not to run in that election, which also took place Tuesday. Republican Greg Lopez, the former mayor of Parker, will defeat Democrat Trisha Calvarese in the special election, CNN projects, and will serve through January. Lopez did not run in the regular primary, which drew six Republicans, including Boebert. Boebert\u00a0first entered the national political consciousness in 2020 with her upset primary win over Republican Rep. Scott Tipton. She\u00a0will be the\u00a0heavy\u00a0favorite\u00a0to win a third term from her new district, which Trump would have carried by about 19 points in 2020 under its current lines.\u00a0(The 3rd\u00a0District, which she currently represents, also leans Republican, but Trump would have carried it by a narrower 8 points.) Boebert has faced accusations of carpetbagging since switching districts. She has said the decision to relocate was based on personal reasons \u2013 namely, wanting a fresh start following a messy and public divorce. She quickly established herself as the front-runner for the GOP nod in the 4th District after winning a Republican nominating assembly in April and with it, the top spot on the ballot. Boebert\u2019s decision to move avoided a repeat of her hard-fought 2022 race against Democrat Adam Frisch in what was the narrowest general election victory for a House Republican that year. Frisch is making a second bid for Congress and ran unopposed in the Democratic primary Tuesday.

{"id": "2024_06_24_politics_trump-biden-debate-expectations-analysis", "text": "After months lampooning President Joe Biden as a cognitively impaired \u201cbrain-dead zombie\u201d who can\u2019t finish a sentence or navigate off a stage, former President Donald Trump and his campaign are changing their tune days ahead of the critical debate of the election. The commander in chief has suddenly morphed into a \u201cworthy debater,\u201d someone of considerable ability and a veteran political performer who is not to be underestimated, according to Trump and his lieutenants. The game of pre-debate expectation-setting is often absurd \u2013 one aide to former President George W. Bush once claimed that John Kerry, his Democratic opponent in 2004, was a better debater than Roman rhetorician Cicero. But the Trump team\u2019s shift is remarkable given their relentless assault on Biden\u2019s faculties. And it hints at their possible concerns that they\u2019ve set an unnecessarily low bar for the president\u2019s performance ahead of Thursday\u2019s clash hosted by CNN in Atlanta. North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, a possible Trump vice presidential pick, tried to reset the balance on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d on Sunday. \u201cThe guy\u2019s run for office more than a dozen times. He\u2019s run for president four times. He\u2019s been campaigning since President Nixon was in office,\u201d he said. \u201cThis guy has got the ability.\u201d Trump is also hedging against a stronger-than-expected Biden showing by suggesting his opponent will be \u201cjacked up\u201d on drugs to ensure a strong performance. The Biden campaign, meanwhile, is intensifying its new attempt to portray Trump as an \u201cunhinged\u201d criminal who is morally reprobate, out to benefit his rich friends and unfit for a return to the Oval Office. The president\u2019s campaign, which is marking the second anniversary of Roe v. Wade\u2019s reversal this week and making abortion a key election issue, promised in a memo Sunday that the head-to-head would finally show voters the contrast Biden believes will disqualify Trump. \u201cThursday\u2019s debate will be one of the first moments of this presidential campaign where a larger slice of the American electorate will have the opportunity to witness the stark choice between Joe Biden, who is fighting for the American people, and Donald Trump, who is fighting for himself as a convicted felon with an unhinged campaign of revenge and retribution,\u201d campaign communications director Michael Tyler wrote. A moment that could define the campaign \u2013 and America\u2019s future The outlandish claims and pregame spin reflect the vital importance of the debate, with the rematch between Biden and Trump neck-and-neck just over four months from Election Day. The showdown comes amid bitterness between the rivals, especially in the wake of Trump falsely claiming that he won the 2020 election. The shadow of Trump\u2019s criminal conviction \u2013 and his sentencing in New York next month \u2013 is adding an extra level of tension at a time when the ex-president is threatening to use a second term to exact revenge against his enemies and as Biden warns Trump will destroy democracy. Trump\u2019s use of his weekend events as warm-ups contrasts with Biden\u2019s measured approach. The president is sequestered at Camp David in Maryland with a large team of aides and debate experts preparing for a meeting with Trump that could define his reelection bid. Millions of voters on Thursday will have a chance to assess the energy, endurance and mental sharpness of an 81-year-old president who has visibly aged and slowed in office as polls show most Americans think he\u2019s too old to serve another term. Fewer voters worry about the cognitive health of Trump, who is only three years younger at 78. But the ex-president\u2019s brash behavior, attacks on the judicial system and facts, and admiration for foreign dictators, which delight his supporters, often alienate swing-state suburban voters who are likely to decide the next president. But the debate cuts deeper than personalities. Voters hurting from years of high prices and craving the return to the full pre-pandemic normality that Biden promised four years ago will be waiting to hear how the candidates can ease the economic pressure bearing down on their families. Biden\u2019s campaign is signaling he will present himself as a force of stability addressing the needs of families that contrasts with Trump\u2019s \u201cdark vision\u201d and the GOP\u2019s threats to abortion rights. The ex-president is, meanwhile, lambasting Biden as blind to a southern border crisis and what he claims are cities scarred by crime, while trying to conjure nostalgia for the Trump economy before the Covid-19 crash. Trump\u2019s change of tone Trump appeared in Washington, DC, at a conference of Christian conservatives on Saturday before heading to Philadelphia, seeking to seize back a state Biden won in 2020 and without which either man may struggle to get to 270 electoral votes. He mocked Biden for going to a \u201clog cabin to study, prepare\u201d and claimed the president was sleeping at Camp David \u201cbecause they want to get him good and strong, so a little before debate time he gets a shot in the a**.\u201d Trump added:\u00a0\u201cI say he\u2019ll come out all jacked up, right?\u201d The presumptive GOP nominee\u2019s suggestions of chemical intervention mirrored his response to Biden\u2019s barnstorming State of the Union address earlier this year when a fired-up president make a mockery of conservative media expectations that he\u2019d stumble during the speech and instead countered their narrative of mental decline. Trump tempered earlier assessments of Biden\u2019s likely performance in an interview with the \u201cAll-In Podcast\u201d released Thursday. \u201cHe beat Paul Ryan,\u201d Trump said, referring to the vice presidential debate in 2012 when Biden dispatched Republican nominee Mitt Romney\u2019s running mate. \u201cI\u2019m not underestimating him,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI assume he\u2019s going to be somebody that will be a worthy debater.\u201d Burgum also sought to manage expectations on \u201cState of the Union\u201d in a way that appeared to undercut the Trump campaign\u2019s long-held position that Biden is no longer fit to serve as president. \u201cWhen he needs to, he can step up,\u201d he told Kaitlan Collins. \u201cThis guy has got the ability \u2013 and we\u2019ve seen it, we\u2019ve seen him in debate four years ago. We\u2019ve seen him in the State of the Union this year \u2013 that when he needs to, he can step up.\u201d Burgum\u2019s assessment is inconsistent with the ex-president\u2019s portrayal of his rival in even some of his most recent appearances. In the key battleground state of Wisconsin last week, for instance, Trump said of Biden: \u201cHe can\u2019t find his way off a stage ever.\u201d After conservative media highlighted deceptively edited video of Biden at the G7 summit in Italy this month, Trump spokesperson Karoline Leavitt accused the president of \u201cwandering around like a brain-dead zombie\u201d and of putting \u201ccognitive decline on full display.\u201d CNN senior political commentator David Axelrod said on \u201cState of the Union\u201d that the Trump campaign\u2019s reversal had been \u201cfun to watch.\u201d He noted Trump spent the last five years \u201cdescribing Biden as utterly incompetent, to the point where, if Biden arrives and leaves under his own power, that would be a triumph. \u2026 I think they have recognized in the last couple of weeks, \u2018Whoa, this guy is going to exceed those expectations and we\u2019d better start creating a rationale for him having a decent night.\u2019\u201d \u2018A magnifying glass on the choice\u2019 The former president has insisted he won\u2019t be participating in mock debates, though he has held what were described as policy forums with Republicans, including Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, another potential vice presidential contender. There is growing speculation about Trump\u2019s approach after his hyper-aggressive and angry performance in the first debate against Biden in 2020 backfired. South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem had some advice for the ex-president on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d on Sunday. \u201cI don\u2019t think he has to get personal in this debate at all because he\u2019s going to have so many good things to talk about, in contrast with Joe Biden\u2019s policies,\u201d she said. Unlike Trump, who spent the weekend creating headlines, Biden hunkered down at the presidential retreat in Catoctin Mountain Park north of Washington. At his side were former White House chief of staff Ron Klain, who has been prepping Democrats for presidential debates for a generation, and other long-term loyalists including Mike Donilon, Bruce Reed, Anita Dunn and Steve Ricchetti. Former Obama White House counsel and Biden\u2019s personal attorney, Bob Bauer, who sources said was likely to reprise his role playing Trump in debate prep, was also on hand. In its memo, the Biden campaign said that Team Biden-Harris is putting a \u201cmagnifying glass on the choice this week as Democrats in Atlanta and across the country organize around this moment.\u201d The comparison on show even before the debate epitomizes the rivals\u2019 opposite approaches to the presidency. Trump is public, abrasive, profane and as ever flouting the expectations of traditional statesmanship.

{"id": "2024_06_26_politics_georgia-battleground-biden-trump", "text": "The headwinds facing President Joe Biden\u2019s reelection bid are as apparent in Georgia as any battleground. So, too, are the questions of whether Donald Trump can capitalize on them. The president and his predecessor are set to face off in a historic CNN debate Thursday night in Atlanta \u2014 the first for either man since the 2020 election. It\u2019s taking place in one of the nation\u2019s most competitive swing states, and a rare example of a Republican electorate that did not side with Trump as he sought to punish those who refused to support his false claims of widespread election fraud. \u201cPresident Trump still has to earn these Republican voters,\u201d said Kelvin King, who was among Trump\u2019s most prominent Black supporters in Georgia in 2016 and 2020. \u201cHe can win, but he\u2019s got to earn it.\u201d King, who met with Republicans in all of Georgia\u2019s 159 counties during an unsuccessful bid for\u00a0US\u00a0Senate in 2022, said\u00a0he has come\u00a0to the realization that Trump should spend far more time articulating his ideas for the future than relitigating the past. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like a bucket of water with a hole in it.\u00a0He\u2019s\u00a0trying to find new voters to fill up this bucket, but there\u2019s a hole that\u2019s leaking a lot of Republicans out,\u201d\u00a0said King, who founded a political outreach group, Let\u2019s Win for America, to spread a conservative message to minority voters.\u00a0\u201cHe\u2019s going to have to plug that hole.\u201d Four years ago, Biden defeated Trump by 11,779 votes out of 5 million cast \u2013 the first time a Democratic presidential candidate carried Georgia in nearly three decades. Unable to accept his loss, Georgia became an early epicenter of\u00a0Trump\u2019s\u00a0election denialism\u00a0\u2014 eventually leading to criminal charges against the former president. In 2022, he backed primary challenges against Gov. Brian Kemp and Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger\u00a0after they didn\u2019t go along with his efforts to overturn the 2020\u00a0results \u2014 but both easily fended off those Trump-backed rivals and won reelection. How the former president\u00a0balances his complaints about the last election with his plans for the next one\u00a0could help determine how competitive the state remains heading into the fall campaign. \u201cRe-litigation is not going to drive people to the polls,\u201d King said, \u201cat least not the folks in the middle, the votes that we need.\u201d Biden spending big in Georgia The Biden campaign and its allied groups have spent $16.5 million here on advertising \u2013 nearly five times as much as Republicans, which Democrats say is a sign they are committed to trying to win the state again in November. Mirroring the themes both campaigns have focused on nationally, the Biden ads have cast Trump as a threat to democracy and highlighted the former president\u2019s legal troubles. \u201cThis election is between a convicted criminal who\u2019s only out for himself and a president who\u2019s fighting for your family,\u201d a narrator says in one spot. The pro-Trump group Securing American Greatness hammers Biden for inflation. \u201cAtlanta rent is way up, food prices soaring to record highs but Biden claims he\u2019s lowering costs. Is it dishonesty or dementia?\u201d a narrator says. One part insurance policy, one part viable path, the Biden team is blanketing the state in the days leading up to Thursday\u2019s debate with 200 events across Georgia. \u201cWe\u2019ve never not shown up to vote. This year it won\u2019t be any different,\u201d said Keisha Lance Bottoms, a former Atlanta mayor who also worked in the White House as a senior adviser to Biden. \u201cWe\u2019re going to show up and I believe President Biden will win Georgia again.\u201d Asked if the race was more difficult the second time around, she said: \u201cElections aren\u2019t ever easy, but the choice is clear.\u201d \u2018It\u2019s not worse!\u2019 The CNN debate on Thursday between Biden and Trump \u2013 the earliest general election debate in memory \u2013 has captured the attention of Atlanta voters like\u00a0Democrat\u00a0Mariama Davis, who said she has high hopes for Biden\u2019s chances in November. \u201cYou know what you\u2019re getting with Joe Biden,\u201d Davis said in an interview in her store, the Beehive. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t pull any punches. He\u2019s a straight shooter and I\u2019m happy to see more of the same.\u201d Asked whether she was better off today than four years ago, Davis paused and answered with careful deliberation. She said she appreciated the student loan forgiveness from the Biden administration as well as other assistance programs during the pandemic recovery. \u201cThey feel pretty much the same,\u201d Davis said, quickly adding: \u201cIt\u2019s not worse! It\u2019s not worse!\u201d While it\u2019s hardly the slogan the Biden campaign is banking on, it taps into a sentiment often expressed by supporters like Davis. Her small business, like so many others, has been on an economic roller coaster ride. \u201cHow has inflation affected our business? It\u2019s affected our business like it\u2019s affected all businesses,\u201d Davis said. \u201cIf people have the choice to buy eggs or food or gifts, we still expect them to buy food for their families. But our doors are still open so we\u2019re grateful for that.\u201d Paths to 270 electoral votes Georgia is among the battlegrounds Trump is trying to win back, along with Arizona, while also targeting Nevada, which he lost twice. Biden could lose all three and still win reelection, if he holds the \u201cblue wall\u201d of Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, as well as a single electoral vote in Nebraska. To keep all pathways open, Democrats are making big investments in Georgia. More than a dozen campaign offices have opened\u00a0in the state, including one that Vice President Kamala Harris christened last week. \u201cThrough this office right here, we will gather, we will organize, we will build community, we will build a coalition,\u201d Harris said. \u201cThere is power in the collective and in our unity.\u201d That fraying coalition is one of the most pressing challenges facing the Biden campaign. \u201cYoung voters have a lot of homework to do,\u201d said Kerry Singleton Jr., who graduated from Morehouse College last month. He was among the students who voiced frustration at the administration for failing to deliver on all of its promises, telling CNN last year: \u201cAs we hold Trump accountable, we have to hold Biden accountable.\u201d But after hearing the president deliver the commencement address at Morehouse College and focusing more acutely on the choice in November, Singleton now sees it differently. \u201cMy disagreements previously do not matter as much as the two people that we have as choices here,\u201d Singleton said. \u201cTo me, former President Donald Trump just isn\u2019t an option whatsoever.\u201d The question is whether Singleton stands alone or represents a broader view among young voters. Looming over the contest is how engaged the state\u2019s Black voters become in the race and whether Biden or Trump deliver a debate performance that moves an otherwise stagnant campaign less than five months before Election Day. Asked whether he\u2019s worried about Trump winning, Singleton replied: \u201cAbsolutely. If he\u2019s elected, that\u2019s a very scary feeling as a young Black male.\u201d CORRECTION: This story has been updated to accurately reflect the name of the Georgia political outreach group founded by Kelvin King.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/26/politics/georgia-battleground-biden-trump/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_24_politics_presidential-debate-history-what-matters", "text": "CNN\u2019s presidential debate will feel like something new for most Americans, but it is actually a return to the roots of presidential debates. Rather than a forum sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates, which had organized all general election presidential debates since 1988, the meeting Thursday between President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump will be hosted by CNN but simulcast on some other networks. CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper and Dana Bash will moderate the meeting at CNN\u2019s Atlanta studio and, unlike commission debates, there will be no live audience. That TV studio format is not unlike the first televised presidential debates in 1960 between then-Sen. John F. Kennedy and then-Vice President Richard Nixon. There was a series of four televised debates in September and October of 1960, all of which occurred in TV studios, although one featured Nixon in a Los Angeles studio and Kennedy in New York, according to a history maintained by the commission. Those first debates were the brain child of network TV executives, according to Alan Schroeder, professor emeritus of journalism at Northeastern University and author of \u201cPresidential Debates: Risky Business on the Campaign Trail.\u201d Kennedy is generally viewed as the winner of the 1960 debates, in part because of his comfort on camera. Nixon, meanwhile, did not wear makeup, did not practice the debate format and did not look like himself after a stay in the hospital due to a knee injury, Schroeder told me in a phone conversation. Nixon learned his lesson, and there were no debates for his subsequent White House runs in 1968 and 1972. The next presidential debates did not take place until 1976, when Nixon\u2019s successor, Gerald Ford, was in a similar position to Biden today. According to Schroeder, \u201che was looking for something dramatic to break the logjam\u201d of poor polling for the Republican after taking over the presidency following Nixon\u2019s Watergate-related resignation. During his speech to the Republican National Convention that year, Ford issued a challenge to Jimmy Carter to debate. But the gamble backfired when Ford flubbed an answer related to the Soviet Union dominating Eastern Europe. Carter was able to appear qualified and capable in front of a massive audience. That\u2019s a very different dynamic from today, when Americans have already experienced both a Biden and a Trump presidency. Four years later, Carter was less excited to debate. He skipped a forum featuring the Republican candidate, Ronald Reagan, and an independent candidate, John Anderson, and took part in only one debate with Reagan. Ultimately, the commission was formed to create a nonpartisan framework for presidential debates \u2013 something that has been exported to other countries. Schroeder said that while he preferred the old system of debates organized by the commission, it would make sense for campaigns to want to have more control over the process. The TV studio format will allow Biden to sidestep \u201cthe distraction of boisterous Trump supporters interrupting, carrying on with loud applause or laughing, all those things that that happen when you have a live audience, and particularly a very politicized live audience,\u201d Schroeder said. Another model for debates, from the pre-Civil War era, relied on massive live audiences and featured Abraham Lincoln and Stephen Douglas. But the so-called Lincoln-Douglas debates did not take place during the 1860 presidential election, when the two were both candidates and when Lincoln won the White House. Instead, the debates occurred in 1858, and focused on the issue of slavery when the two men were running for Senate in Illinois. Douglas kept the Illinois Senate seat, but the debates gave Lincoln a national profile and helped him on the way to the White House. Don\u2019t expect a Lincoln-Douglas-style debate on TV. While more than 10,000 people attended most of the debates, held in locations across Illinois, they would seem extremely long-winded for someone with a 21st century attention span. The first speaker would get a 60-minute opening statement. The second got a 90-minute response. And the first speaker got a final 30-minute rebuttal. CNN\u2019s entire debate will last 90 minutes and include two commercial breaks. It will not feature opening statements, although each candidate will get a closing statement. After a coin toss, Biden is set to give the first closing statement and Trump will go last. Read more about the debate setup. The debate will be watched live by millions on CNN and other TV networks, but unlike the Kennedy-Nixon debates, it will continue to be digested by potential voters in video clips on social media after it airs. For the large portion of Americans who already know how they\u2019ll vote, it\u2019s unlikely a debate performance will change their minds, but Schroeder argued there are people who haven\u2019t expressed a preference. \u201cThey\u2019re still up for grabs,\u201d he said. \u201cThis debate and the one (hosted by ABC News) in September are likely to be events that would attract the people who don\u2019t normally pay a lot of attention to politics.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/24/politics/presidential-debate-history-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_24_politics_fact-check-trump-george-washington-slaves", "text": "Former President Donald Trump delivered another litany of false claims during two speeches on Saturday. And he expressed an opinion on American history that is clearly contradicted by the facts. During a speech to the Faith\u00a0and\u00a0Freedom\u00a0Coalition, a conservative Christian group,\u00a0Trump criticized proposals to change the names of schools, military facilities and other places that honor slaveowners and Confederate leaders. (Under President Joe Biden, the Army has renamed nine installations\u00a0that had been named for Confederate generals.) And Trump said, \u201cHow about George Washington high school? \u2018We want the name removed from that high school.\u2019 They don\u2019t know why. You know, they thought he had slaves. Actually I think he probably didn\u2019t.\u2019\u201d Facts First: Washington owned slaves. This is an extensively documented fact. At the time of Washington\u2019s death in 1799, there were 317 enslaved people at Mount Vernon, his home and plantation in Virginia, including 123 people owned by Washington himself.\u00a0 \u201cGeorge Washington owned slaves. We know this by his own hand. He kept ledgers on everyone he enslaved,\u201d said Alexis Coe, a senior fellow at the think tank New America and author of \u201cYou Never Forget Your First: A Biography of George Washington.\u201d Coe said it is \u201creprehensible, on a personal level, to deny such a thing\u201d and also \u201cdangerous to our country\u201d to have a leading presidential candidate espousing such inaccurate views on US history. The website for Mount Vernon, which is now maintained as a historic place, says\u00a0that the number of slaves at the property \u201cgrew steadily\u201d over Washington\u2019s time there from 1754 to 1799. Washington inherited 10 slaves from his father at age 11. The Mount Vernon website notes that \u201cas a young man, Washington purchased dozens of enslaved people from estate sales and in private transactions\u201d \u2013 and that the first US president also rented slaves from others, inherited them from siblings, and enslaved the children who were born to slaves at Mount Vernon. When he married his wife Martha, the website notes, he also gained control of \u201ca large number\u201d of enslaved people from the estate of her first husband. The\u00a0list\u00a0of\u00a0317 enslaved people at Mount Vernon at the time of his death included 41 people rented from other plantations and 153 people from Martha\u2019s first husband\u2019s estate. Washington privately struggled\u00a0with the idea of slavery and, in the last two decades of his life, expressed private support for the idea of abolishing slavery by legislation. But when he died, he immediately freed just one person in his will, his longtime manservant, and decreed that the other slaves he owned would be freed upon the death of his wife Martha. She ended up signing a deed to free all of his remaining slaves the year after his death, but she kept the slaves she had inherited herself. Trump made many other false claims Here are just some of the other false claims Trump made in the speech to the Christian conservative group or in his rally speech Saturday night\u00a0in Philadelphia: - Trump claimed Democrats rigged the 2020 presidential election, his usual debunked lie. - Trump claimed \u201cevery legal scholar\u201d wanted Roe v. Wade overturned and the power to set abortion policy returned to individual states, which is not true. - Trump claimed \u201cjust about all the Democrats\u201d also wanted Roe overturned and abortion policy set by states, though Democrats overwhelmingly supported the preservation of Roe. - Trump claimed \u201cthere are states that allow\u201d the execution of babies after birth, though that is illegal in every state.  - Trump claimed that the US has record inflation, though the current inflation rate, 3.3% in May, is nowhere near the US record (23.7% in 1920) or even the 40-year high (9.1%) that was hit in June 2022. - Trump claimed the price of bacon has increased 100% or more under Biden, though the Biden-era increase is actually about 17% as of May. - Trump claimed Biden was the person who indicted him in the New York criminal case in which he was convicted on 34 felony counts, though a grand jury of ordinary citizens indicted him and the prosecution was led by a local district attorney who does not report to the federal government. - Trump claimed the global prison population is \u201cway down\u201d under Biden because foreign leaders are emptying their detention facilities to send people to the US as migrants. But the global prison population is actually up since 2021, and there is no proof of Trump\u2019s repeated claim about foreign leaders\u2019 actions. - Trump claimed crime in Venezuela is down 72%, though the limited available numbers show a much smaller decline of about 26%. - Trump claimed crime in the US is \u201cso much up,\u201d though preliminary statistics show US crime dropped significantly in 2023 and again in the first quarter of 2024. - Trump claimed he has been indicted more than notorious gangster Al Capone, though Capone was actually indicted more than Trump. - Trump claimed China paid the entire cost of his tariffs on imported Chinese goods and that \u201cthe American people didn\u2019t pay for it at all,\u201d though study\u00a0after\u00a0study has found that Americans paid the overwhelming majority of the cost of the tariffs. - Trump claimed the Biden administration is trying to require Army tanks to be all-electric, though the military\u2019s move toward electric vehicles does not include tanks. - Trump told a story in which he claimed someone told him that non-electric trucks do not have to stop when driving from New York to Los Angeles, though they do.\u00a0", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/24/politics/fact-check-trump-george-washington-slaves/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_11_politics_gender-gap-2024-election-analysis", "text": "Democrats are facing the threat of a gender gap that could imperil the traditional advantage among younger voters that the party has enjoyed for decades and that President Joe Biden likely needs to defeat former President Donald Trump. While Democrats are counting on a big backlash among younger women against the rollback of abortion rights to help propel Biden, a backlash among younger men against changing gender roles could help lift Trump. Both younger men and women are broadly discontented with the economy and Biden\u2019s job performance, polls show. But the anger and frustration over the 2022 Supreme Court decision overturning the federal right to abortion provides Biden a powerful tool to expand his support among young women unhappy with him on other fronts, strategists in both parties agree. For many younger women, pollsters say, the loss of abortion rights has become not only a threat in itself, but a symbol of a broader attempt to reverse women\u2019s gains in economic status and pressure them back into more traditional gender roles. Meanwhile, Biden faces a dual challenge with younger men: Not only is abortion less of a motivating issue for them, but there\u2019s evidence that many of them are receptive to the messaging of Trump\u2019s \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d movement, with its implicit promise to restore traditional racial and gender hierarchies. In a striking new Pew Research Center national survey, for instance, fully two-fifths of the men younger than 50 who are supporting Trump agreed that women\u2019s gains in society have come at the expense of men. That was not only more than double the share of younger Biden-supporting men who agreed with that sentiment, but considerably larger even than the share of older Trump-supporting men who agreed. All this suggests that while cultural attitudes may help Biden overcome economic discontent among younger women, an amorphous but insistent sense of cultural marginalization may reinforce Trump\u2019s economic inroads among younger men. Researchers say democracies across the Western world are experiencing a widening partisan and ideological gap between younger men and women. In a much discussed article earlier this year, Financial Times columnist John Burn-Murdoch pointed to survey data in a variety of countries showing that young men were far more likely to identify as conservative than young women. \u201cIn countries on every continent, an ideological gap has opened up between young men and women,\u201d he wrote. That gap has widened in the US, too, though the evidence shows that it is growing more because young women are ideologically moving to the left than because young men are moving to the right. Merged annual results from NBC polls conducted by a bipartisan team of Democratic and Republican pollsters document the trends. In 2013, the share of young men aged 18-29 who called themselves conservative very slightly exceeded the share who identified as liberal, while the reverse was true for young women, according to results provided by Public Opinion Strategies, the GOP half of the partnership that conducts the NBC poll. For each gender, though, the balance between conservatives and liberals was nearly even. In their 2023 results, the pollsters found that young men had shifted slightly left, with slightly more now identifying as liberal than conservative. But, over that same 10-year period, young women had sped leftward: In the 2023 results, three times as many of them identified as liberal than as conservative. In 2013, the share of self-identified liberals among young women exceeded the share among young men by 5 percentage points; by 2023, that gap was nearly four times as large. These shifts over time have produced a situation where younger men are still more liberal than older men on most issues, but not nearly as liberal as younger women. The annual youth poll conducted by the Institute of Politics at Harvard University\u2019s John F. Kennedy school offers perhaps the best snapshot on the gender divergence among younger adults. In this year\u2019s survey, young men were 15 points more likely than young women to support building Trump\u2019s border wall, 12 points more likely to say same-sex relationships are morally wrong and 11 points more likely to say Israel\u2019s response to Hamas in Gaza has been justified. Still, in each case, only a minority of younger men endorsed those conservative viewpoints. But while younger men have moved only modestly to the right on most public policy issues, they have more clearly shifted in their willingness to identify with the Republican Party. The latest annual Harvard youth survey found that among young men, Democrats now only have a 3-percentage point advantage in party identification, down from 22 points as recently as 2020. Among women, the Democratic identification edge over that same period grew from 20 to 26 percentage points. (The NBC surveys likewise found the Democratic advantage narrowing among younger men and widening among younger women over recent years, though the changes were not as dramatic as in the Harvard poll.) \u201cThere is not a ton of evidence that young men are more likely to identify as conservatives, but there does seem to be a growing affinity for Republican identity,\u201d said Daniel Cox, director of the Survey Center on American\u00a0Life at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. That growing receptivity to the GOP could contribute to a wider gender gap among young people than in recent elections. The latest Harvard poll showed that among likely younger voters, Biden led Trump by about 2-to-1 among women, almost exactly his advantage in the Harvard Poll at this point in 2020. But among likely male voters, the survey found that Biden led Trump by just 6 points, a precipitous, and perilous, decline from his 26-point advantage in the 2020 survey at this point. Other respected sources on voting results in 2020, such as the exit polls, found that Biden didn\u2019t win young men that year by as much as Harvard projected, which would mean his decline now is less severe. Still, pollsters in both parties say their own data track the same movement the Harvard poll identifies, with Biden largely holding his lead from 2020 among younger women, but slipping among younger men, including not only White but Black and Latino younger men. The good news for Biden is that younger women turned out at much higher rates than younger men in 2020; in fact, the gap between female and male turnout that year was wider for younger adults than in any other age group, according to analysis of Census Bureau data by William Frey, a demographer at the Brookings Metro thinktank. But Biden has so little margin for error in the battleground states that the level of erosion among younger men that he\u2019s experiencing in polls still poses a grave threat to his reelection. In explaining the growing youth gender gap, analysts point to several factors. One is diverging priorities between young men and women. Even more young women in the Harvard youth poll expressed negative views about Biden\u2019s economic record than young men did, but the women were far more likely than the men to cite abortion as a key factor in their vote. \u201cThe difference is young women are voting more on culture and rights, such as abortion, and young men are probably going to be more compelled to vote on economic reasons,\u201d said Melissa Deckman, CEO of the non-partisan Public Religion Research Institute and author of the forthcoming book, \u201cThe Politics of Gen Z: How the Youngest Voters Will Shape our Democracy.\u201d As with all generations, Trump\u2019s belligerent style also contributes to the widening gender divide. \u201cYounger men admire the strength of Trump, but what younger men think is strong, women think is chaotic, crazy and divisive,\u201d said Democratic pollster Celinda Lake, who polled for Biden\u2019s 2020 campaign. Trump also has a significant tactical advantage in that he tends to be portrayed much more positively than Biden on the YouTube channels, podcasts, Reddit threads and TikTok videos that constitute the principal source of information for many young men, noted John Della Volpe, who directs the Harvard youth poll. (In that survey, young men were substantially more likely than young women to say they rely on YouTube as a major source of news.) \u201cThe media ecosystem specifically among young men is [a place] where Joe Biden doesn\u2019t get a break and Trump is stood up as an anti-hero,\u201d said Della Volpe, who is advising a newly formed super PAC trying to boost Biden among young people. Trump has leaned into that advantage by identifying with entertainment that disproportionately draws younger men, like the Ultimate Fighting Championship match he attended as his first public event following his felony conviction in New York. Trump may also be drawing from deeper wells of changing social attitudes. Last week\u2019s Pew finding that two-fifths of younger males backing Trump believe women\u2019s gains have come at men\u2019s expense is only one of many recent poll results suggesting more young men are bristling against the rising demands for gender and racial equity. The new Pew poll, for instance, also found that more than four-fifths of the younger men supporting Trump asserted that all the obstacles blocking women\u2019s advancement in society have been eliminated \u2014 more than double the share of Biden-supporting younger men who agreed. (In this case, older men backing Trump were as likely to endorse that statement as younger ones.) Nearly two-thirds of the younger men supporting Trump also agreed in the poll that \u201csociety is better off if people make marriage and having children a priority\u201d \u2014 equal to the share of older Trump men and more than triple the share of younger Biden men. In an AEI poll this spring, the share of all young men who say efforts to promote gender equity have gone too far reached about 1-in-5, more than double the level in 2017. Survey evidence also shows resistance, particularly among younger White men, to the growing demands from minority groups for more racial equity in education, employment and other settings. In that same AEI poll, over three-fifths of young White women said their race has made their life easier, but far fewer young White men said the same (only about 2-in-5). Conversely, in this year\u2019s Harvard poll, nearly three-fifths of men (of all races) agreed that society is placing too much emphasis on racial identity; only about two-fifths of young women agreed. Exactly three-fourths of younger men supporting Trump in the Pew poll rejected the idea that Whites benefit from advantages in society unavailable to Blacks. This backlash against a changing society only extends so far: Though the \u201ctradwife\u201d movement in social media celebrates women reverting to roles as homemakers and mothers, in the Harvard Poll only about 1-in-6 younger men (and 1-in-10 younger women) agreed that women should prioritize having children over entering the workforce. Deckman noted that compared to older generations, young men today\u00a0\u201chave been raised by their mothers and aunts and grandmothers, who have gone on to hold jobs and be professionals and they are used to seeing women as leaders.\u201d But if young men aren\u2019t moving back to 1950s expectations in large numbers, the surveys showing male unease with women\u2019s increasing independence and authority make clear that something is stirring. \u201cLooking across different surveys and different questions, we can debate about the degree to which it is changing, but there is no doubt we are seeing movement,\u201d said Cox of the AEI. This pushback among young men comes after activism around racial and gender equality in the past few years reached its highest level since the late 1960s and early 1970s, with the rise of the #MeToo and Black Lives Matter movements and more forceful advocacy in LGBTQ communities. (In the Harvard poll, one-fourth of young women identified in some way as LGBTQ, more than double the share of young men.) It also comes amid continuing evidence that women are navigating the transition to an information-based economy better than men: Women now account for about 60% of all four-year college graduates and nearly 65% of graduate degrees, according to the latest federal statistics. In her upcoming book, Deckman sees the #MeToo movement as the galvanizing force initially propelling more Gen Z women toward liberal activism. That first impulse, she said, has been reinforced by Trump\u2019s 2016 electoral success, despite his extensive history of misogynistic statements and behavior. The sharp turn right on social issues in red states, punctuated by the Supreme Court\u2019s 2022 Dobbs decision overturning the nationwide right to abortion, has provided another spur to activism. Anna Dean, co-founder and co-CEO of the group LOUDwomen, is one of the young female activists Deckman profiles in her book. Dean, now a rising senior at Harvard, helped to start the group in high school in Bentonville, Arkansas, when she noticed that young women and racial minorities were dropping out of school debate activity after biased treatment by the judges. When Trump was elected, she said, the young women felt the same sexist or racist behavior they were fighting in their schools was \u201creflected on the news when we hear Donald Trump speak.\u201d The Dobbs decision, she said, underlined the sense among the young women that their rights were eroding, even as many of them had reached educational milestones unmatched for older women in their families. When relatives or acquaintances tell Dean she is living the \u201cwildest dreams\u201d of earlier generations of women by attending Harvard, she said she often thinks: \u201cOK, yeah this is awesome but at the same time I don\u2019t have the same rights you did when you were my age. I am doing things my ancestors could have only dreamed of, but at the same time I don\u2019t have the same health care rights.\u201d Della Volpe says that from his research and focus groups, he believes that younger men are not so much hostile to the movements demanding more rights for women or LGBTQ people as wondering where that leaves them. \u201cI have empathy for them because in large measure they are just trying to figure life out,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd they sense and feel, sometimes accurately, sometimes inaccurately, that while they are trying to figure life out that they are being judged by people \u2014 that they are projected to be inferior or bad or ignorant, or worse, racist or homophobic. I think that\u2019s a big part of this.\u201d Such anxieties and grievances about social change have always provided the waters that Trump fishes in. The ability to identify the currents of discontent about change \u2014 cultural, racial or economic \u2014 in each group that he is targeting may be Trump\u2019s greatest skill as a politician. Just as the former president has powerfully appealed to White voters who feel marginalized in a more racially diverse America, or to blue-collar factory towns that feel left behind by the transition to a metro-based information economy, he\u2019s also showing a magnetic pull for the men who feel eclipsed by women\u2019s growing prominence in the workplace and society. Most younger men don\u2019t necessarily hold favorable views about Trump personally, noted Cox, but many are receptive to his broad message that elites in modern US society are discriminating against him and his followers. \u201cThat grievance is what binds them [to him] when very little else does,\u201d Cox said. By contrast, said Deckman, for younger women who believe opportunity and power in US society are still too much tilted toward men, \u201cDonald Trump is the embodiment of many of the things they are opposed to. \u2026 They are sick of old White guys running everything.\u201d That sentiment doesn\u2019t easily translate into enthusiasm for Biden, the other \u201cold White guy\u201d\u00a0in the race. Dean said that despite the distaste for Trump, even young women in her activist circles are more likely to talk about their frustrations with the current president than their fears of the prior one. Given the risk that Biden won\u2019t match his 2020 performance with young men, he has an urgent need to rekindle that flagging enthusiasm among young women. \u201cHe\u2019s got to make up for the defection of young men by winning young women by more, and he\u2019s got to get every young woman he can out to vote,\u201d said Lake, the Democratic pollster. Biden\u2019s best hope of avoiding a catastrophic decline in his youth support is that the number of young women Trump repels exceeds the number of young men he attracts.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/11/politics/gender-gap-2024-election-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_20_sport_willie-mays-analysis-spt-intl", "text": "When people ask me how good of a player Willie Mays was, I give them a perhaps odd answer. The San Francisco Giants basically gave Mays to the New York Mets for practically nothing in 1972, and a well past his prime 41-year-old Mays was the best overall hitter \u2013 as measured by his ability to get on base and hit for power \u2013 on that solid Mets squad. Of course, the more normal way to know how good Mays was is that he remains, statistically, the best player who played his entire career in the last century and is in the Hall of Fame. But if you truly want to know how great Mays was? You had to watch him play. I couldn\u2019t help thinking of my Father when I learned of Mays\u2019 passing last night on \u201cThe Source.\u201d I mentioned him almost immediately. You see, my Father watched Mays play when he came up as a rookie for the New York Giants in 1951. He considered Mays the best player he ever saw from the moment he laid eyes on him in that inaugural year. Mays supercharged that \u201851 Giants squad and helped them overcome a 13.5-game deficit in mid-August to win the NL pennant over their crosstown rivals, the Brooklyn Dodgers, thanks to the Shot Heard \u2018Round the World. It remains, in my opinion, the greatest comeback in baseball history. Mays won Rookie of the Year that season. It was three years later, however, when Mays became a baseball legend. After serving in the military for over a season, the man nicknamed the \u201cSay Hey Kid\u201d \u2013 who had a great song written about him playing on that name \u2013 dominated the National League. He led the league in batting average, slugging percentage (a measure of power), triples (one of the ultimate measures of speed and power) and on-base plus slugging (OBPS), which combines all of it into one metric. And yet, I don\u2019t think most remember Mays\u2019 1954 MVP season for his offensive exploits; people like my Father remember him for a play he made during Game 1 of the 1954 World Series. Let me set the scene: the game is tied 2-2 in the eighth inning. The Cleveland Indians have runners on first and second with no one out. Cleveland power hitter Vic Wertz is at the plate, and he hits a long fly ball into the truly cavernous center field at the Polo Grounds in New York. Mays, who roamed center field for over 20 seasons, went back more than 400 feet and made a difficult, over-the-shoulder catch seem easy. He then fired the ball back into the infield to ensure that no runs would score. The Giants would go on to win the game and sweep the series in four games. It was their swan song in New York, as they moved to the West Coast after the 1957 season. Mays never understood why people thought that catch was amazing. For him, it was relatively routine. What was unique about this catch, beyond being in the World Series, was that video cameras captured it in an era from which we don\u2019t have many recordings. That short splice of film is our version of getting to see Mays play. It\u2019s our rare glimpse into a man whose defensive prowess was far more than that one catch. Mays was the best defensive player at any position that entire season in the National League, according to advanced statistics. He is, by those same metrics, a top-five defensive outfielder of all time, and those statistics \u2013 given we don\u2019t have a lot of video from the era \u2013 don\u2019t even really take into account his obviously great arm. The fact that I\u2019m talking about the defense of a man who for a long period of time was third all-time in home runs \u2013 and remains sixth \u2013 tells you everything you need to know. Mays wasn\u2019t just defense, though he excelled at that. He wasn\u2019t just about hitting for power, though he excelled at that. He wasn\u2019t just hitting for average, though he excelled at that. He wasn\u2019t just about speed, even though he excelled at that and led the league in stolen bases four times. Mays was everything \u2013 and he was so for over 20 years. Mays was, as my friend and esteemed sports columnist Neil Paine calculated, the most complete ballplayer in history. Baseball fans talk about finding five-tool players \u2013 those who hit for power and average, have speed and defensive abilities in terms of range and arm \u2013 like a miner trying to find gold. Well, we found our gold in Mays. But again, Mays is more than just numbers. He was one of our last links to multiple eras of baseball history. Mays oversaw the expansion of baseball to the West Coast in 1958, when it had previously been played on the Major League level only east of the Mississippi River. He was the first superstar on the West Coast. Mays was also the last superstar with us who made his name playing in New York during the 1950s. It was baseball\u2019s golden era; a time when America came out of World War II with a booming economy and during which baseball continued to outrank football as America\u2019s favorite sport and pastime. And if Mays wasn\u2019t good enough, he actually added a few hits to his storied, record-book career a few weeks ago when Negro League statistics were integrated into the MLB record books. Mays was one of the last living stars who started his career in the Negro Leagues in 1948 for Birmingham Black Barons. I like to joke that Mays was so great that he was still compiling hits at the age of 93. Indeed, he remained a hit with anyone who saw him play. Long after his career was over, Mays \u2013 when he would come back to New York \u2013 lived down the street from us in the Bronx. My Father would see him on walks and knew he had to get his autograph. Mays gave my Dad that autograph, and he kept it in his office until he passed. Mays is a big reason why my Father was one of the few people who wore a New York Giants baseball cap throughout his later years. I bought at least three of them for my Dad because he had one on his head all the time and literally wore them out. It\u2019s a connection I try to carry on to this day whether it\u2019s by wearing a New York Giants baseball hat on television or by answering \u201cthe New York Giants\u201d when asked what baseball team I root for. Now, excuse me as I go try and find that Mays autograph to honor the greatest player anyone I know saw play.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/20/sport/willie-mays-analysis-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_13_politics_kfile-jd-vance-harsh-twitter-likes-trump-vice-president", "text": "Republican Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance, a leading candidate to be Donald Trump\u2019s vice president, liked tweets in 2016 and 2017 that harshly criticized Trump and his policies \u2014 including one speculating that Vance could serve in former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton\u2019s administration. Other tweets liked by Vance said Trump committed \u201cserial sexual assault,\u201d called him \u201cone of USA\u2019s most hated, villainous, douchey celebs,\u201d and, in a since-removed set of tweets, harshly criticized Trump\u2019s response to the deadly 2017 White nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia \u2013 something Vance now defends Trump over. Vance\u2019s past anti-Trump stances have been well-documented, but these new examples, unearthed by an extensive review of Vance\u2019s past social media activity, demonstrate they were more widespread and scathing than previously known. Their discovery also comes as Vance has solidified his standing in Trump\u2019s inner circle as a frequent defender of the former president and is among a handful of people under consideration to be Trump\u2019s vice-presidential pick. As CNN\u2019s KFile previously reported, Vance deleted past anti-Trump tweets ahead of his announcement in July 2021 that he would run for the open Ohio Senate seat. Vance once\u00a0privately wondered whether Trump was \u2018America\u2019s Hitler\u2019 in February 2016, and a few months later wrote in The Atlantic that Trump was \u201ccultural heroin.\u201d Vance also said he even contemplated voting for Clinton, but ultimately said he would vote for independent candidate Evan McMullin for president in 2016. Once regarded as a \u201cTrump whisperer\u201d for his understanding of the aggrieved White working class and a self-described \u201cNever Trump\u201d Republican, Vance shot to fame over his memoir, \u201cHillbilly Elegy,\u201d published in June 2016. Vance was a frequent guest on cable news programs and later became a CNN contributor in 2017. His subsequent transition from vocal Trump critic to staunch supporter has been widely scrutinized. Vance has become a key surrogate for the former president and routinely defends Trump on television, including during his hush money trial in New York last month. Vance also helped orchestrate Trump\u2019s June 6 fundraiser in San Francisco with tech industry donors. Trump is expected to meet with congressional Republicans in Washington, DC, on Thursday. In a statement to CNN, Vance cited Trump\u2019s \u201cmany successes in office\u201d and claimed that realizing the \u201ccorporate media and Deep State\u2019s\u201d coordinated efforts to undermine Trump changed his perspective. \u201cI\u2019m proud to be one of his strongest supporters in the Senate today and I\u2019m going to do everything in my power to ensure President Trump wins in November - the survival of America depends on it.\u201d Prior to the publication of this story, Vance\u2019s communications director sent along two supportive statements from Donald Trump Jr. and Jason Miller, a senior advisor to the Trump campaign. Trump Jr. criticized news outlets for repeatedly covering Vance\u2019s past anti-Trump comments writing, \u201cWe\u2019re 100% confident that JD is America First to the core\u201d and \u201cno one in the Senate has been a stronger supporter of my father.\u201d Trump Jr. added they were \u201clong past all of this,\u201d saying they had \u201cdiscussed it with him at length.\u201d Miller wrote, \u201cIt\u2019s important to keep in mind that politics is ultimately politics,\u201d and likened Vance\u2019s past criticism to criticism by Kamala Harris of Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential primary over his past opposition to desegregation busing in the 1970s. In an interview published Thursday, Vance told New York Times columnist Ross Douthat about his political conversion to a pro-Trump Republican. \u201cLike a lot of other elite conservatives and elite liberals, I allowed myself to focus so much on the stylistic element of Trump that I completely ignored the way in which he substantively was offering something very different on foreign policy, on trade, on immigration,\u201d Vance said. Anti-Trump social media activity from 2016 CNN reviewed Vance\u2019s past likes on Twitter, the platform now known as X, before X changed its policy to make users\u2019 likes private and hidden from others. A majority of the newly uncovered social media activity dates from the last five months of the 2016 presidential campaign. They include Vance liking a number of anti-Trump posts on Twitter, including those criticizing Trump\u2019s immigration policies, acknowledging antisemitism from Trump supporters, questioning the integrity of voting for Trump over Clinton and even raising concerns over Trump having access to the country\u2019s nuclear codes as president. In February 2016, Vance liked a tweet featuring a photo of Trump, two women and O.J. Simpson with the caption, \u201cHere is an old picture of one of USA\u2019s most hated, villainous, douchey celebs. Also in picture: OJ Simpson.\u201d Vance also liked tweets from August 2016 that praised his book and envisioned a role for him in a potential Clinton administration and another tweet suggesting he could provide Clinton with the \u201cseeds to a plan to defeat Trump.\u201d But Vance soon began liking several tweets with the hashtag #NeverHillary through October 2016. While promoting his memoir and appearing on news programs in 2016, Vance liked a series of tweets calling then-candidate Trump a \u201cmonster\u201d and a \u201cnemesis of the GOP.\u201d He also liked a tweet acknowledging \u201cthreats and derogatory terms Trump supporters hurl at Jews.\u201d He even liked a tweet from CNN anchor Jake Tapper criticizing Trump\u2019s tweet about a woman\u2019s appearance amidst then-first lady Melania Trump\u2019s campaign against cyberbullying. He also liked a tweet that read, \u201cDoes any dad (or future dad) want to look his daughter in the eye and explain why he voted for Trump instead of 1st woman president?\u201d Among the harshest tweets Vance liked was one that called out Trump after the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape surfaced, capturing previously unaired lewd and sexually aggressive remarks by the presidential nominee. \u201cMaybe the Central Park 5 could take out a full-page ad to condemn the coddling of thug real estate barons who commit serial sexual assault,\u201d the tweet read. Other tweets Vance engaged with criticized signature Trump policies, including Trump\u2019s hardline position on immigration and the tax cuts from 2017. In August 2017, Vance criticized Trump\u2019s response to the White supremacist violence in Charlottesville earlier that year, linking in a since-deleted tweet to a TV segment that called Trump a \u201ccoward\u201d for his response, and then liked a tweet indicating he did not consistently support the GOP or Trump. \u201cThere is no moral equivalence between the anti-racist protestors in Charlottesville and the killer (and his ilk),\u201d Vance wrote, while also criticizing left-wing violence. \u201cYou may not like @JDVance1\u2019s view - but it\u2019s hard to pin him down as consistently supporting views of either Trump or GOP,\u201d read the tweet Vance liked. Pro-Trump pivot Despite his earlier harsh criticism of Trump, by 2021, Vance dismissed left-wing condemnation of Trump\u2019s comments \u2014 where Trump equated White nationalist protestors and counter-protestors as \u201cfine people on both sides\u201d\u2014 as \u201cthe ridiculous race hoax in Charlottesville.\u201d Ahead of his Senate campaign that year, Vance apologized for previously calling Trump \u201creprehensible,\u201d in tweets first uncovered by CNN\u2019s KFile. \u201cLike a lot of people, I criticized Trump back in 2016,\u201d Vance told CNN in 2021. \u201cI regret being wrong about the guy,\u201d Vance said, adding he thought Trump was a good president. In a previously unreported blog post Vance wrote in April 2010 under his previous legal name, J.D. Hamel, he wrote in support of legal immigration, advocating to \u201cmassively increase\u201d the number of migrants allowed into the country. \u201cBorder security is a good start, but if we plan to control the border, then we must also plan to massively increase the number of legal migrants allowed into the country,\u201d Vance wrote. \u201cThe day that America no longer welcomes decent, hardworking foreign nationals is the day that our nation loses something very central to its character and its economic diversity.\u201d Vance told CNN, \u201cIt was a stupid opinion from 15 years ago when I was in my twenties. All anyone needs to do is check my voting record as a Senator to see that I have consistently opposed increased immigration levels into America.\u201d Vance said in September 2016 that Trump\u2019s immigration policies were overly simplistic. \u201cAt the heart of Trump\u2019s immigration message is that if we had less immigration, we would have much better jobs,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s a lot more complicated than that. My own sense is that Trump definitely simplifies these problems. I don\u2019t think if you build a great Mexican wall, all of a sudden, all of these steel mill jobs are going to come back to southern Ohio, but it at least gives people something to latch onto.\u201d Three months ago, Vance reiterated his support for Trump\u2019s immigration policies. In an interview on Fox Business Vance said, \u201cIf we don\u2019t get control of the southern border \u2013 tens of millions of illegal aliens are now in our country, tons of fentanyl killing over 100,000 people \u2013 we don\u2019t have a country anymore if we don\u2019t get control of that border.\u201d This story has been updated with more information.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/13/politics/kfile-jd-vance-harsh-twitter-likes-trump-vice-president/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "politics"}}

{"id": "2024_06_21_politics_biden-trump-character-attacks", "text": "Joe Biden is throwing everything at Donald Trump. The president and his campaign are blasting the presumptive Republican nominee as a criminal and a racist who was found liable for sexual assault and who is now being driven so \u201ccrazy\u201d by his loss in 2020 that he\u2019s been left \u201cunhinged.\u201d It\u2019s one of the most\u00a0searing portrayals in the modern age by an incumbent president of his challenger and is designed to define the 45th president as flagrantly unfit for a return to the office he left in disgrace in 2021. With his two impeachments, a criminal conviction and an attempt to overturn the last election, Trump gave Biden plenty to work with. But Biden\u2019s strategy may also tell the story of a reelection campaign that is going nowhere near as well as the president must have hoped, as he battles diminished standing across swathes of the electorate and faces a dauntingly narrow path to the 270 electoral voters needed to win in November. New fundraising figures announced by Biden and the Democratic Party on Thursday reveal that Trump and his team outraised the president for the second month in a row, largely erasing what was a financial advantage held by Biden for much of the campaign cycle. For months, Biden\u2019s team has argued that when the choice between the president and his predecessor became clear to voters, the stakes of the election would shift the political equation in his favor. The theory was that voters were slow to tune into the race and that they may need reminding about the chaos and the discord of Trump\u2019s first term that ended in the worst assault on democracy in generations. But it\u2019s now midsummer, and the election is less than five months away. There\u2019s every sign the race is still shaping up as much as a referendum on Biden \u2013 and a weary populace\u2019s lost sense of economic security \u2013 as it is on the threat to the rule of law that Trump is making clear a second term would entail. The president\u2019s campaign is therefore intensifying an effort to highlight the perceived consequences of a new White House mandate for Trump, who has pledged to use presidential power to exact personal retribution, while conservative groups polish blueprints for an overhaul of the bureaucracy, energy, and economic policy. Biden\u2019s best chance to reset the choice comes in his first debate with Trump on CNN in six days \u2014 a confrontation that the Biden campaign is trying to shape with daily attacks on Trump, looking to appeal to demographic groups the president hopes will return him to the White House. Some small shifts toward the president have emerged in some polling since Trump\u2019s criminal conviction in his hush money in New York last month. But the race has been mostly stable with no clear leader for months, which should be troubling to a president who is asking voters to reward him with a new term. Biden\u2019s best chance for a reset Thursday\u2019s debate will also represent the president\u2019s opportunity before tens of millions of television viewers to counter the bleak character sketch Trump is conjuring of him. The ex-president portrays his rival as a doddering incompetent who can\u2019t make it to the end of a sentence. This picture is exaggerated. But polls show that most Americans worry about the age and capacity of a president who has noticeably slowed physically in recent years and who would be 86 by the end of a second term. Trump isn\u2019t much younger, and if he wins, he\u2019d be the oldest president, at 78, to begin a second term. Biden has been road testing his character attacks on Trump for weeks in fundraising events and they\u2019re now increasingly being parroted by campaign officials. At a fundraiser attended by former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in northern Virginia on Tuesday, Biden laid out a stark scenario that included a warning that his rival was waging an all-out assault on the legal system. \u201cThe threat Trump poses would be greater in a second term than it was in his first term.\u00a0You know \u2026 I think he\u00a0snapped\u00a0when he lost in 2020.\u00a0He can\u2019t accept he lost.\u00a0(It\u2019s) literally driving him crazy. \u2026 He\u2019s not only obsessed with losing in 2020, he\u2019s clearly a little bit unhinged right now.\u201d Biden\u2019s campaign has been seizing the initiative all week as it lays the groundwork for the message it clearly hopes Americans will take away from the debate. On Monday, it debuted a hard-hitting new ad. \u201cThis election is between a convicted criminal who is only out for himself,\u201d the narrator says as the former president\u2019s mug shot splashes across the screen. \u201cAnd a president who is fighting for your family.\u201d The gambit erased any doubt over how Biden will seek to exploit a guilty verdict against Trump and his three other criminal indictments to which he\u2019s pleaded not guilty. The ex-president\u2019s campaign will respond by claiming Biden\u2019s strategy is proof of an attempt to weaponize the justice system against him. But since Trump\u2019s campaign is already spinning that narrative anyway, Biden may have little to lose. The ad, part of a $50 million ad buy in June online, on battleground state TV channels and on national cable, references the hush money trial and Trump\u2019s losses in a defamation suit to the writer E.

The contrast could not be more striking, and the Biden campaign must hope that it at last begins to take root in voters\u2019 minds. \u201cThe people of America are going to very soon have a choice between Donald Trump, who wakes up every day thinking about himself, thinking about his billionaire friends and then thinks about how he\u2019s going to hurt people that he thinks have hurt him,\u201d Biden\u2019s campaign co-chair Mitch Landrieu said on CNN\u2019s \u201cInside Politics\u201d on Thursday. \u201cJoe Biden wakes up every day fighting for the American people, making sure that we\u2019re going to protect people\u2019s freedoms, protect democracy and lower costs,\u201d Landrieu told Manu Raju. Biden seeks to move the goalposts with ads during soccer tournament The Biden campaign is now making daily pitches to a significant corner of his coalition showing signs of stress. Wednesday, the Juneteenth holiday that commemorates the end of slavery in the US, saw a stinging attack on Trump, designed to thwart his attempt to make inroads with Black voters \u2013 a vital Democratic voting block. \u201cAfter a lifetime of racism and in honor of the holiday, the least Trump could do is give Black America a day off from his campaign\u2019s racist, empty pandering,\u201d Jasmine Harris, the campaign\u2019s director of Black media, said in a statement. \u201cBlack voters have had enough \u2013 and they\u2019re ready to put an end to Trump\u2019s candidacy.\u201d The campaign also sent around a list of the many race controversies precipitated by Trump during his lifetime, including his call for the execution of five Black youths over the sexual assault of a woman in Central Park, New York, who were later found to be wrongly convicted, and his long-running racist conspiracy theory about the birthplace of former President Barack Obama. During the 2020 election, CNN exit polls showed that Trump got around 12% of the votes of Black Americans. But some recent opinion polls suggest he\u2019s currently getting around 20%. That kind of performance in 2024 could squeeze Biden\u2019s margins in key swing states like Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, where he needs strong Black turnout in cities like Philadelphia, Detroit and Milwaukee to counter Trump\u2019s strong advantage in more rural areas. On Thursday, the Biden campaign turned to Hispanic voters \u2014 another key voting bloc where polls suggest he is underperforming. His campaign laid a seven-figure bet on the Copa Am\u00e9rica \u2014 the international soccer tournament featuring Western hemisphere men\u2019s teams that Lionel Messi and his World Cup-winning Argentina team kicked off in Atlanta on Thursday night. A new ad featuring the president and slamming Trump will air during games over the next few weeks as Biden\u2019s campaign seeks to remind Latino voters about Trump\u2019s chaotic leadership during the Covid-19 pandemic. \u201cFour years ago, we were shut down. Stadiums were empty. Trump failed us,\u201d a narrator says over images of empty stadiums, arguing that Biden reopened the country and created 15.6 million jobs. The ad then cuts to a shot of Biden in what looks like a sports bar as the soundtrack plays the \u201cGoalllllllllllllll!\u201d cry that South American commentators use when the ball hits the back of the net. According to an NBC News poll in February, Biden and Trump are tied among Latinos, a constituency that has traditionally voted for Democrats. But Biden won the critical demographic 65% to 32% in 2020, according to exit polls. Unless he can get somewhere near that percentage again, key swing states in the West like Arizona and Nevada could be out of his reach and even competitive states further east that he also won four years ago, like Georgia and Pennsylvania, where there are smaller Hispanic populations, could be at risk. Biden\u2019s character attacks on Trump represent his best attempt to remind Americans of the fateful nature of the choice they will face in November. Those hits would be remarkable enough if the presumptive GOP nominee were a neophyte candidate who could be easily defined by negative advertising. But most voters already know exactly who Trump is. So, the finely balanced contest poses a question with which Democrats might prefer not to wrestle: What if enough persuadable voters are fully familiar with Trump\u2019s past and remember the mayhem and division of his White House term \u2013 but still aren\u2019t ready to support Biden?", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/21/politics/biden-trump-character-attacks/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_26_politics_primaries-maga-squad-what-matters", "text": "There must be some sort of larger takeaway in the fact that Rep. Lauren Boebert, among the most MAGA members of Congress, won a Republican primary in Colorado on Tuesday night, and Rep. Jamaal Bowman, a member of the progressive \u201cSquad\u201d from the Bronx, lost a Democratic primary to a more moderate candidate from Westchester County in New York. Every House race is different, obviously, since all politics is local, according to the old saying. So it would be an oversimplification to say that Republicans moved more MAGA and Democrats moved more moderate based on these two unrelated races. More MAGA or moderate? And yet there\u2019s evidence to support that general trend. Look no further than the two parties\u2019 presidential candidates. Former President Donald Trump personifies MAGA, and a large part of the Make America Great Again ethos he pushes is loyalty to him. President Joe Biden, on the other hand, effectively worked with Republicans to pass a bill to improve the nation\u2019s infrastructure and has said he wants to work with Republicans on immigration reform. Many Republicans will tell you they don\u2019t believe Biden. There\u2019s nothing moderate about either Boebert or Bowman, who occupy space on the fringe of their respective parties. Both were also seriously flawed candidates with problems that extend beyond policy. Boebert was kicked out of a theater last year for vaping and \u201ccausing a disturbance,\u201d for instance. Bowman was charged last year with pulling a fire alarm in a House office building when there was no emergency. Rather than face voters in the district she narrowly won two years ago, Boebert moved to run in a district with a more conservative voting record. She emerged from a crowded field to win the Republican primary in the district, which was previously represented by Rep. Ken Buck, a conservative Republican who is a critic of Trump and had resigned from office in frustration. Bowman, on the other hand, was targeted by more mainstream Democrats in part for his loud criticism of Israel in its war on Hamas in Gaza, an issue that has split Democrats this year. Pro-Israel groups spent heavily in the race, attempting to oust Bowman. However, in advertising, Bowman was attacked more for his opposition to Biden\u2019s policies than for his position on Israel. Evidence of a liberal retreat I asked CNN\u2019s Gregory Krieg, who covered the Bowman race, why he thinks Bowman lost and what it says about Democrats today. Here\u2019s what he emailed back: KRIEG: There are obviously many ways to read Bowman\u2019s defeat, and his failure to bridge the gap with pro-Israel Jewish voters in the district, specifically in Westchester, is understandably the one you\u2019re hearing most often. But I also think, if we\u2019re looking at this through a national lens, it\u2019s hard to not see it as part of the broader liberal retreat from some of the more aggressive left-wing characters and candidates they embraced during Trump\u2019s presidency.\u00a0 For all the talk about Democrats\u2019 lack of enthusiasm about Biden personally, the idea of Biden \u2013 the moderate, even-tempered statesman type \u2013 is still very, very popular. And (Westchester County Executive George) Latimer, to some extent, embodied that.  It obviously did not help Bowman that AIPAC (the American Israel Public Affairs Committee) and other outside groups bombarded him with record spending and gobs of money invested in research into every thought that\u2019s crossed his mind the last 25 years.  That primary voters did not hold the spending against Latimer, as progressives argued they should, also reminds me that voters (especially Democrats) in presidential cycles tend to be cautious. You\u2019ll probably never hear Trump, Fox News or anyone on the right mention Latimer\u2019s name. And for some folks left-of-center, that\u2019s priceless. Utah went its own way While Boebert\u2019s victory provides a foil for Bowman\u2019s loss, it was far from a perfect night for more MAGA Republicans. In a separate Colorado race, the chair of the state GOP, Dave Williams, who had gotten Trump\u2019s endorsement but who said controversial things about gay rights \u2013 including that Pride flags should be burned \u2013 lost to the more establishment pick, Jeff Crank, a real estate investor and former talk radio host. And in Utah, Republicans snubbed the MAGA options for both governor and senator in a state that is very conservative but where the base of Mormon voters has bristled at the former president. Current Sen. Mitt Romney is a notable Trump critic in the GOP, and his decision not to run for reelection opened up an opportunity to replace one of the few remaining Republicans who voted to convict Trump on impeachment charges in 2021 with a Trump-backed Republican. Rep. John Curtis, the winner of the GOP Senate primary, did not vote to convict Trump as a member of the House, but he is the rare Republican focused on climate change, an issue that disproportionately affects Utah but which Trump dismisses. The larger problem \u2026 Both Curtis and Gov. Spencer Cox were actually rejected by GOP party activists at the state\u2019s nominating convention but found their way onto the ballot with the help of signature drives. Cox has taken more moderate positions on certain issues and was booed at the state GOP convention this year,\u00a0according to The Associated Press. But Cox and Curtis both easily won primaries, which are open to all voters and which essentially determine the winner of statewide contests in a state like Utah. It\u2019s a shame that primary voters are becoming the de facto general election voters in states and districts that lean heavily to one side or the other, according to former Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels, a Republican who wrote a lament in The Washington Post that most of the country lives in a state with \u201ctrifecta\u201d government, where one party controls most of what\u2019s happening at their state level. Daniels writes: The issue isn\u2019t simply that states lean reliably Republican or Democratic. It\u2019s that now a big majority are heavily, maybe irrevocably, tilted in one direction or the other. Where that obtains, office seekers pitch their initial appeals to the hard core on their side, as primary candidates always have. The difference is that, instead of the winner\u2019s traditional post-primary imperative, to reach out to nonpartisans and even open-minded members of the opposing party, now their job is finished. There are efforts to change this dynamic, which we\u2019ve written about in this newsletter, such as in states experimenting with nonpartisan primaries and ranked-choice voting. But Daniels has a point. None of the races we\u2019ve discussed so far in this story are expected to be at all competitive in November.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/26/politics/primaries-maga-squad-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_04_28_politics_state-abortion-ballot-measure-vote-dg", "text": "This November, many voters across the country could take to the polls to determine the future of abortion access in their state, with organizers working to secure a wave of measures on the 2024 ballot aimed at restoring or protecting the right to an abortion \u2013 and a few aimed at restricting it. Abortion rights advocates hope the effort will restore the issue of reproductive health access to the people, after the Supreme Court\u2019s Dobbs decision overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, eliminating the national right to an abortion. Most of the proposed ballot measures aim to enshrine the right to an abortion in state constitutions.\u00a0They follow a series of restrictive trigger laws that went into effect following the Dobbs decision, along with abortion policies that were handed down by politicians or decided by state supreme courts since the decision. Some are up against a handful of counter measures aimed at restricting abortion access, though similar restrictive measures have failed in the few states where votes have been held in the past couple of years. Abortion measures on the ballot in November Five states \u2014\u00a0Colorado, Florida, Maryland, New York and South Dakota \u2014 have already secured abortion measures on the 2024 ballot. All eyes are on Florida, which has served as a critical access point for people seeking services in a region of the country that is fast becoming an abortion care desert. A six-week abortion ban replaced the state\u2019s 15-week ban on May 1. After organizers secured the New York Equal Rights Amendment on the 2024 ballot, it was briefly struck from the ballot by a state judge. State Attorney General Letitia James appealed that decision, and a state appeals court restored the measure to the ballot in June. States with potential abortion ballot measures Organizers in other states across the country are working to secure funding, gather signatures and jump through the legal hoops necessary to secure abortion measures on the 2024 ballot. In most states, the process entails collecting a certain number of signatures by a designated deadline this summer, while others require the additional step of having the ballot language approved by a state court, according to campaign organizers. The abortion rights measures are largely backed by coalitions of reproductive health advocates, many of which are fundraising to secure the money to support the campaigns. Arizona, Nevada and Montana have all seen proposed measures protecting abortion access up to the point of viability, which doctors say is around 24 weeks into pregnancy. A potential measure in Arkansas would allow abortion up to 20 weeks into pregnancy or in cases of rape, incest or fatal fetal anomalies. A potential measure in Missouri\u00a0that\u00a0seeks to broadly protect reproductive care\u00a0could still make the ballot in November.\u00a0An opposing\u00a0measure to permanently ban abortion,\u00a0however,\u00a0never made it out of the state\u2019s legislative session. A number of potential measures, like those in Nevada and Montana, allow for abortion past the point of viability when deemed necessary by a doctor to protect a pregnant person\u2019s life or health \u2014 though doctors and lawmakers have struggled to define exactly what type of medical emergencies would be allowed under the exception. A proposed measure to restrict abortion access in Pennsylvania seeks to establish that public funding can\u2019t be used for the procedure, though it is unlikely to pass the state legislature. States that have voted on abortion post-Dobbs Seven states have already seen a vote on abortion access since Roe v. Wade was overturned, and reproductive health advocates have been heartened by the overwhelming support for abortion access among voters. Every measure aimed at protecting abortion access has passed, while all measures to restrict it have failed. While support for abortion access is considered a given in states like California, organizers say these votes offer an important layer of legal protection for patients and providers \u2013 and send a message to elected officials about what voters want.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/28/politics/state-abortion-ballot-measure-vote-dg/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_26_politics_what-the-supreme-court-ruling-on-social-media-means", "text": "The Supreme Court on Wednesday issued a decision that could have enormous consequences for the 2024 election, saying the US government can \u2013 for now \u2013 keep warning social media companies about mis- and disinformation threats it\u2019s seeing online. Although the case was decided narrowly on a technicality and not on the substance of the issues, the decision is nonetheless among the most consequential of the court\u2019s current term. Here\u2019s everything you need to know about this critical case affecting online speech and the democratic process. What can the US government tell social media companies to do? As a result of Wednesday\u2019s ruling in Murthy v. Missouri, agencies such as the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security will continue to be able to contact social media companies about posts they view as mis- and disinformation. Examples could include false claims about Covid-19, unfounded allegations about election fraud or other statements that in some situations may violate the platforms\u2019 own policies. Republican-led states, including Missouri and Louisiana, along with five social media users, claimed in 2022 that those contacts with social media companies were in fact part of an unconstitutional government campaign to silence free speech. The US government has been flagging this type of content to social media companies for years, at times using extremely forceful language to demand the content be removed. At oral arguments, justices spent more than 90 minutes trying to discern the line between government persuasion on one hand and undue government coercion on the other. Why is the government talking to social media companies? The government\u2019s outreach to social media platforms has been happening since the 2016 election and in direct response to Russia\u2019s attempts to meddle in US politics. In 2020, a congressional inquiry faulted the US government and tech platforms for not working together more to respond to those types of informational threats, which could baselessly sow division among voters and weaken the United States on the world stage. The ties between Washington and Silicon Valley involved routine, recurring meetings between government and company officials that were often publicly announced and included platforms such as Meta and Twitter (now known as X), as well as input by outside academics and researchers. Those lines of communication became important ways for the government and social media companies to trade information about fake accounts or malicious foreign actors looking to destabilize the United States, said Laura Edelson, an assistant professor of computer science at Northeastern University and the co-director of Cybersecurity for Democracy, a research group focused on digital misinformation. The relationships provided everyone involved with vital situational awareness about a rapidly evolving misinformation landscape, one whose danger has only grown with the advent of generative artificial intelligence, Edelson said. \u201cMoving into [this] election season, we\u2019ve already started to see influence campaigns starting to come out of the woodwork, be identified and reported on,\u201d Edelson said. \u201cThat\u2019s not news that those exist, and something that the government used to be a really good conduit for was making sure that when something was reported or identified in one platform, it was identified and shared with others.\u201d What does the Supreme Court think? The court said Wednesday that the plaintiffs in the case \u2013 the states and private citizens \u2013 didn\u2019t have the legal right, also known as standing, to bring their suit. Writing for a 6-3 majority, Justice Amy Coney Barrett said the plaintiffs didn\u2019t do enough to prove that it was government pressure on social media companies that directly led to their past posts being censored, let alone that the plaintiffs were in any imminent danger of the government somehow censoring their future posts. Social media sites clearly make their own decisions about how to moderate their platforms, regardless of what the US government may call for them to do, Barrett wrote. In fact, as evidence presented in the case showed, online platforms sometimes did the opposite of what the government wanted. \u201cThe platforms continued to exercise their independent judgment even after communications with the defendants began,\u201d Barrett wrote. \u201cFor example, on several occasions, various platforms explained that White House officials had flagged content that did not violate company policy.\u201d Barrett added: \u201cThe plaintiffs, without any concrete link between their injuries and the defendants\u2019 conduct, ask us to conduct a review of the years-long communications between dozens of federal officials, across different agencies, with different social-media platforms, about different topics.\u201d Rather than delve into all that, the court punted. It avoided ruling on whether the government\u2019s communications with social media companies violated the First Amendment.\u00a0But in so doing, the court didn\u2019t say that they were unconstitutional, either, which effectively means they can continue for now. This doesn\u2019t rule out a future set of plaintiffs bringing similar claims under a different set of circumstances, which could potentially allow the court to weigh in on the issue again, perhaps even on the merits of the matter. Legal experts said Wednesday that the court\u2019s decision carefully threads the needle. \u201cThe Supreme Court\u2019s decision is a sensible response to a difficult question,\u201d said James Grimmelmann, professor of digital and information law at Cornell University. \u201cIt recognizes that platforms are free to set their own content-moderation policies against harmful and deceptive posts. It protects them from government coercion of their moderation decisions, but it also allows them to listen to the government\u2019s views.\u201d What does this mean for the 2024 elections? It is up to the Biden administration whether to fully revive the lines of communication it had temporarily paused during the litigation. The FBI resumed sharing some threat information with social media companies earlier this year, prior to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision, CNN has previously reported. In light of Wednesday\u2019s ruling, however, the administration could potentially restore much more of its information-sharing infrastructure. \u201cThe Supreme Court\u2019s decision is the right one, and it helps ensure the Biden administration can continue our important work with technology companies to protect the safety and security of the American people, after years of extreme and unfounded Republican attacks on public officials who engaged in critical work to keep Americans safe,\u201d White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement following the court\u2019s decision. Despite the ruling\u2019s narrow nature,\u00a0some legal experts said it is a significant win for those trying to ensure the 2024 race isn\u2019t disrupted by false claims. \u201cThere are essential moments when our government should be allowed, even encouraged, to contact private companies like social-media platforms and provide factual information to them, especially when issues of foreign interference, election integrity, national security and encouragement of violence crop up online and pose real-world threats,\u201d said Nora Benavidez, senior counsel at the civil rights and consumer advocacy group Free Press. \u201cOf course, we should be wary of government intrusions into private speech,\u201d Benavidez added. \u201cBut the Biden administration\u2019s efforts to fight misinformation do not amount to censorship; rather, they are efforts to make platforms aware of the potential public harms that could result from the unvetted spread of falsehoods via their networks.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/26/politics/what-the-supreme-court-ruling-on-social-media-means/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "politics"}}

I think it was her polite way of getting me to shut up, but it\u2019s good advice even if her ultimate goal was a little quiet in the King family kitchen. Listening is a lost art in our politics. And, too often, in our political coverage. Everyday Americans are ignored, or given a quote or soundbite here and there, while most of the attention goes to the ever louder partisan bombast. Don\u2019t get me wrong \u2013 we need to cover what the politicians say. And what their ads say. And fact check it all. But our All Over the Map project is an attempt to shift the balance a bit. To listen. To learn. We have been at it 10 months now, and we are learning a ton from voters who are literally all over the map \u2013 in every way. Now, with a presidential debate looming on Thursday and a consequential election heading into the final stretch, we invite you to listen with us \u2013 in a way that goes beyond what we can do on television or in written dispatches. All Over the Map, in podcast form, comes to CNN Audio today, so we can share our voters\u2019 stories in more detail. You can hear people wrestle with their choices and explain the life experiences shaping their politics. A CNN series that began in Iowa and New Hampshire as the primary season took off now includes voters in South Carolina, Virginia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Georgia, Nevada and Arizona. Mom was right. You learn when you listen. My biggest lesson so far: Yes, there are huge differences in polarized America. But voters are not only willing but eager to have the tough conversations many politicians avoid. Most are willing to discuss the compromises politicians refuse to make. Economic anxiety is easy to find, as are doubts about the candidates. In our first episode, Nikki Haley voters share their thoughts, and their frustrations, with their two choices for president. There are enough supporters of the former South Carolina governor, who ended her GOP primary bid in March, to swing the election \u2013 so we wanted to visit a few in battleground Pennsylvania ahead of the first Biden-Trump debate. You will meet Linda Rooney and Michael Pesce and you will hear the torment of self-identified Reagan Republicans who want their party back from Trump but run afoul of their GOP DNA when they ponder voting to reelect a Democratic president. It is fascinating to listen to voters who start in the same place but take different turns when staring at the Trump-Biden crossroads. Rooney, from Media, Pennsylvania, in the Philadelphia suburbs, gives voice to a theme we hear a ton in our travels. She voted for Trump in 2016 and Biden in 2020. \u201cI\u2019m sad that we only have these two choices honestly,\u201d Rooney told us. \u201cI\u2019m tired of celebrities sort of being in politics. I don\u2019t like Trump, but I have to say we were, for us, personally, we were better off when he was president. I don\u2019t like how he\u2019s so unreliable in some ways. You never know what he\u2019s going to do next. I just want a normal person. Like, I just want someone normal. I don\u2019t want a celebrity, and I don\u2019t have confidence in Biden. So, I feel like I don\u2019t have a choice.\u201d But she promised to vote, and it is not lost on her that the Pennsylvania winner tends to be the national winner. Pesce is both part of the generation that changed American politics 40 years ago and the suburban shift that is reshaping our politics today. He lives in Doylestown, in competitive Bucks County, and, like Rooney, was a Trump voter in 2016 and a Biden voter in 2020. \u201cI became a Republican when I turned 18 because of Ronald Reagan,\u201d said Pesce, a Coast Guard veteran who works in a meat processing plant. \u201cI\u2019m a Reagan Republican. I like that version of conservatism. I like that version of America. His version of \u2018America First.\u2019 That we are the leaders of the free world. We are the leaders of the world military. This is what we stand for. And I\u2019m like, yeah, that\u2019s what I want to be.\u201d Down the road, we visit one of America\u2019s newest presidential battlegrounds and meet two voters whose 2024 choices \u2013 and conversations \u2013 are shaped by Biden\u2019s map-changing 2020 win in Georgia. And we explore the cracks in the Biden coalition that make his reelection math, and map, so challenging. A Palestinian American law school student in Dearborn, Michigan, gives voice to the anger young voters and Arab American voters feel over Biden\u2019s handling of Israel\u2019s war in Gaza. A Black entrepreneur in Milwaukee shares his take on the economic decline in neighborhoods that once offered a path to the middle class through factory jobs. I hope you will consider joining our journey. A few minutes into any voter conversation, you might feel no connection to someone who lives far away from you and perhaps has a very different life experience or political views. My bet, though, is by the end, something will connect you or stir your own thoughts about an issue or the candidates. We are just a bit over four months to Election Day now, and we know that the race is close, that the third-party candidates make the state-by-state math complicated and that voters who don\u2019t much like either major-party candidate will decide who wins. Maybe you fit in this group. Maybe you are certain about your choice and can\u2019t understand that frustration. I hope you can share a little time with us, and learn by listening.

{"id": "2024_06_26_politics_dhs-identifies-400-migrants-smuggled-isis", "text": "The Department of Homeland Security has identified more than 400 migrants who came to the US via a human smuggling network that may have some connection with ISIS, prompting\u00a0an\u00a0additional review of those individuals, according to\u00a0two\u00a0US officials. The\u00a0purpose of the network was to smuggle people, not bring in terrorists,\u00a0one of\u00a0the officials said. But it is the same network\u00a0that brought eight Tajik nationals,\u00a0who were arrested earlier this month after officials discovered that they had some specific and troubling connections to the terror group. There was specific \u201cderogatory information\u201d linking those individuals to ISIS, the official said. In the latest case, the 400 migrants under scrutiny \u2013 mostly from Central Asian nations \u2013 are being screened purely because of their connection to the\u00a0human smuggling\u00a0network. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas told reporters Wednesday that the department hasn\u2019t identified \u201c400 people with potential ISIS ties.\u201d Of those 400 people,\u00a0a\u00a0number of them\u00a0have\u00a0been detained by immigration authorities, according to the official.\u00a0But there\u00a0haven\u2019t been cases identified of anyone threatening the US at this point, the official said. Vetting is ongoing. NBC News was\u00a0first to report\u00a0the figure of 400 migrants. The review comes as US officials have grown increasingly concerned about migrants from Central Asian nations such as Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. The leadership of ISIS-K is mainly made up of Tajik nationals and the group has recruited from both countries.\u00a0Tajik nationals have carried out a series of recent attacks in Europe on behalf of the group, including the Crocus Hall\u00a0attack in Moscow in March that killed more than 100 people. US officials have been paying particular attention since last summer, when a group\u00a0of\u00a0Uzbek nationals who had crossed the southern border were later found to have been assisted in traveling to the United States by a facilitator who had ties to ISIS. The episode sparked a scramble across the US government to locate and investigate those people. Two US officials also said that it spurred national security officials to ensure that immigration and intelligence authorities were appropriately monitoring anyone traveling from Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan. \u201cI think what (the incident with the Uzbek nationals) did last summer was suggest Central Asians are potentially a population of concern, given what we know about the global ISIS network right now,\u201d a senior US official previously told CNN. The more recent episode played out in a similar fashion: The eight men from Tajikistan\u00a0initially entered the US at the southern border and requested asylum under US immigration law.\u00a0By the time intelligence that was collected on overseas ISIS targets connected the men to the terror group, they had already been vetted by immigration authorities and allowed into the country, officials said. Though there is no hard evidence indicating that they were sent to the US as part of a terror plot, at least some of the\u00a0Tajik nationals\u00a0had expressed\u00a0extremist\u00a0rhetoric in their communications, either on social media or in direct private communications that US intelligence was\u00a0able to monitor, three officials said. National security officials feared that at least some of the eight Tajiks were ripe for radicalization by ISIS-K while they were inside the United States, potentially struggling with isolation, financial stress or discrimination \u2013 all things that could make a person susceptible to ISIS propaganda glorifying violence. Senior officials now see a so-called lone-wolf attacker who emerges seemingly from nowhere as perhaps the more likely \u2013\u00a0and potentially equally dangerous \u2013\u00a0threat rather than the more traditional coordinated plot carried out by trained operatives. Earlier Wednesday, Mayorkas told MSNBC that \u201cwe have no evidence that (the 400) are individuals plotting to harm the United States.\u201d \u201cWe screen and vet individuals at the time of encounter. If we learn of derogatory information, we take enforcement action, we are proceeding with extreme caution here in the service of the security and safety of the American people, number one,\u201d he said.

{"id": "2024_06_18_politics_immigration-policy-biden-what-matters", "text": "In two weeks, the White House has swerved from taking tough action against asylum-seekers trying to enter the country illegally to taking strong action to show empathy for people who have lived for years in the US immigration shadows. It was in early June that President Joe Biden pulled from former President Donald Trump\u2019s playbook to severely limit protections for asylum-seekers who cross the border illegally, effectively trying to seal the border to them, and addressing a changing mood in the country with regard to asylum-seekers. That move angered many progressives and immigration advocates and drew a lawsuit by the American Civil Liberties Union. But those groups will now cheer Biden\u2019s move Tuesday, offering new protection to hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants \u2013 specifically some spouses of US citizens and their children \u2013 who are already in the US. The move could grant legal status to about 500,000 American families, according to the White House. Biden promises empathy; Trump promises mass deportation The new executive action offers a major contrast with Trump, who is promising to deport more than 10 million people from the US if he\u2019s elected to a second term. At the White House, Biden argued Trump\u2019s deportation policy would \u201crip spouses and children from their families, homes and communities and place them in detention camps.\u201d From CNN\u2019s report by Michael Williams: Under current federal law, an undocumented person who enters the United States and marries a US citizen must first request parole before applying for legal residency. That process requires them to leave the country if they were there illegally, upending their careers and families and creating uncertainty about whether they would be authorized to reenter.  Tuesday\u2019s action allows those spouses to apply for residency without needing to leave the United States \u2013 a key change that the Biden administration argues will keep families intact. Read Williams\u2019 full report. Undocumented immigrants eligible for the program will have to apply, but they can stay in the US as the process unfolds. The must have been married by June 17, before the new action was announced, and they must have been in the US for at least 10 years. Is this necessary? One Biden critic argued the new policy is unnecessary since few long-standing undocumented immigrants who are married to a US citizen would ever be deported. \u201cI\u2019m trying to understand the problem that the Biden administration is trying to solve here, and I just don\u2019t see it,\u201d Chad Wolf, an acting secretary of the Department of Homeland Security during the Trump administration, said on CNN. He did not address Trump\u2019s deportation pledge during the interview. Seeking \u2018balance\u2019 Rep. Adriano Espaillat, a New York Democrat who is the first former undocumented immigrant elected to Congress, told CNN\u2019s Brianna \ufeffKeilar that while he does not support the asylum action announced earlier this month, the addition of protection for undocumented spouses and their children \u201cbalances that out in a real smart way.\u201d He argued the immigration debate is too large for one single fix. \u201cJust to do (border) enforcement or just to do what we\u2019re doing today alone is not an answer to the vast majority of the American people that are concerned about this,\u201d Espaillat said. \u201cThe immigration debate is very broad,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s complicated, and these are very specific items within that broader debate that are being addressed.\u201d Legal limbo Biden\u2019s move could also lack permanence. An important caveat to any immigration action is that since Congress continually fails to address the immigration issue, anything a president does with executive power might be reversed by the next administration or invalidated by courts. Look no further than the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program enacted by the Obama administration in June 2012, another strong executive action positioned for effect in an election year. Still proud of that policy, Biden announced his new program in conjunction with the 12th anniversary of DACA. Obama enacted DACA; Trump tried to end it The DACA policy was enacted after bipartisan, comprehensive immigration reform efforts failed for the umpteenth time. It was meant to bring people brought to the US illegally as children, frequently referred to as \u201cDreamers,\u201d out of the shadows and allow them to build lives in the country where they grew up. Nearly 600,000 people have sought protected status under the program, which defers but does not necessarily end any immigration action against them. The Trump administration tried to end the DACA program in 2017, but the effort eventually failed at the Supreme Court in 2020. Instead, Trump hit pause on new applications, something the Biden administration then reversed. Would today\u2019s Supreme Court protect DACA? After the Biden administration tried to formalize the DACA process, a federal judge in 2021 agreed with Texas and other states that the program must be ended, again halting new DACA applications. That case is now under appeal and could land the DACA issue back at the Supreme Court. When a divided 5-4 court prevented the Trump administration from ending DACA in 2020,  Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a liberal justice, was still on the court. She has been replaced by a conservative, Justice Amy Coney Barrett. In 2020, Chief Justice John Roberts infuriated conservatives by joining the liberal block of justices to rule against Trump on technical grounds. The new case and the new makeup of the court mean DACA is far from safe. Congress could, of course, fix all of this with action, but it has failed to pass comprehensive reform despite attempts that go back decades. The much more modest bipartisan effort pushed by Biden earlier this year would not have helped the undocumented spouses of citizens and their children.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/18/politics/immigration-policy-biden-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_26_politics_migrant-apprehensions-dropped-40-percent", "text": "The seven-day average of migrant apprehensions has dropped more than 40% to less than 2,400 encounters per day since President Joe Biden\u2019s executive action barring asylum at the US southern border went into effect about three weeks ago, the Department of Homeland Security said. Border authorities apprehended about 1,600 migrants along the US southern border on Monday, a drop from about 1,900 apprehensions on Sunday, a source familiar with the data said. Despite the significant drop, Biden\u2019s executive order remains in effect, DHS said. Senior administration officials have said the measure would be lifted when there\u2019s a daily average of less than 1,500 encounters between ports of entry. The latest figures, coming on the heels of Customs and Border Protection statistics that also found a sharp decrease in encounters since the asylum restrictions went into effect, are a promising sign that Biden\u2019s actions to address the ongoing crisis at the border are working, the administration said. \u201cWe indeed have seen a tremendous success early on, and I should emphasize that it is early on in our implementation of the president\u2019s proclamation and our accompanying regulation,\u201d Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas told CNN\u2019s Kate Bolduan on \u201cCNN News Central\u201d Wednesday, adding that the executive order is \u201cno substitute for congressional action.\u201d Under the rules of the sweeping executive order, migrants who cross the US-Mexico border illegally are barred from seeking asylum once a daily threshold is met. And unless they meet certain exceptions, they could be returned to Mexico or to their country of origin. DHS has removed or returned more than 24,000 people in more than 100 repatriation flights to more than 20 countries, according to the agency. The swift removal of migrants has led to a more than 65% decrease in the number of migrants released into the country pending immigration proceedings, DHS said. More Border Patrol agents have returned to the field and to the front lines of border security operations, including the interdiction of individuals who pose a threat to public safety, according to DHS. Enhanced screening measures have helped identify known or suspected gang members, including members of the Venezuelan\u00a0\u201cTren\u00a0de Aragua\u201d gang, DHS said. Anyone confirmed to be a gang member is detained and either referred for criminal prosecution or placed on expedited removal proceedings, according to the agency. Responding to the new figures from DHS, Lee Gelernt, deputy director of the American Civil Liberties Union\u2019s Immigrants\u2019 Rights Project, warned that, under the new restrictions, \u201cmigrants with credible claims of danger are being denied an asylum screening.\u201d \u201cIn\u00a0the end, the ban is unlikely to have much impact on the numbers, but if it does deter people in danger from seeking safety here, that\u2019s deeply troubling,\u201d said Gelernt, who is the lead attorney in an ACLU lawsuit over the executive order. Biden\u2019s executive action sought to address an ongoing crisis that has become a significant political challenge. It was the administration\u2019s most dramatic move on the US southern border and used the same authority former President Donald Trump tried to use in office. The issue has grown in urgency in recent weeks ahead of the CNN Presidential Debate between Biden and Trump \u2014 at which immigration is likely to be a major issue \u2014\u00a0as well as in light of the murder of a 12-year-old Houston girl, allegedly by two men who were in the US illegally. Trump said over the weekend that if he were president, the two men \u201cwould\u00a0not have been in our country.\u201d \u201cThe criminals who committed these heinous acts must be held responsible with the fullest force of the law,\u201d Mayorkas, who will travel to Tucson, Arizona, later Wednesday to review border enforcement efforts, said on CNN. \u201cWe\u00a0will hold the criminals accountable.\u201d CNN\u2019s Samantha Waldenberg and Sam Simpson contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/26/politics/migrant-apprehensions-dropped-40-percent/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_26_politics_trump-issues-debate", "text": "Staring down a potentially race-defining debate and an opponent that has spent far more time preparing,\u00a0Donald Trump\u2019s team is now trying to steer\u00a0the former president\u2019s\u00a0focus to kitchen table issues instead of the grievances that have occupied his mind for the past four years. Advisers and allies of Trump have privately encouraged him\u00a0to focus intensely on the economy, crime and inflation during Thursday\u2019s debate, citing poll numbers that reflect he has the upper hand on these issues, sources familiar with the conversations tell CNN. \u201cThese are the issues that are people are hurting from and that need to be addressed,\u201d Trump senior adviser Jason Miller said during a call Tuesday with reporters, citing recent record inflation, crime committed by undocumented migrants and President Joe Biden\u2019s handling of the US-Mexico border. Some of these allies have also urged\u00a0Trump to paint the international landscape under Biden as chaotic and focus on both the two-year war in Ukraine and the fighting between Israel and Hamas as examples. \u201cThis isn\u2019t theoretical anymore,\u201d Trump ally Rep. Mike Waltz told \u201cCNN News Central,\u201d when asked what he hopes to hear from the former president during the debate. \u201cThis is what life was like under the Trump administration\u2014economically with inflation, with the border with security, in terms of crime and the world \u2026 Just look at the Middle East \u2026 You\u2019re going to see the contrast and the contrast is going to be clear.\u201d Sources close to the former president say that while Trump is aware of the gravity of Thursday\u2019s debate and the importance of hammering a message, they acknowledged his propensity to veer into lengthy, off topic rants that leaves the possibility they may have fallout to manage come Friday morning. Trump\u2019s advisers, who have gone back to examine the former president\u2019s 2020 debates with Biden, are also cognizant that his aggressive approach in that cycle\u2019s first matchup may have misfired with\u00a0viewers.\u00a0In that debate, Trump repeatedly attacked Biden and consistently spoke over him, as well as antagonized the moderators. His poll numbers fell shortly after the event. Trump himself acknowledged as much in an interview with the Washington Examiner published on Monday. \u201cI was very aggressive in the first one,\u201d\u00a0Trump said. \u201cThe second one, I was different, and I got great marks on the second one. It was a little unfair because, in the second one, a lot of votes had already been cast. So I\u2019m probably going to look at the scene at the time. It\u2019s like a fight. It depends on what the situation is.\u201d Trump allies have also sought to control the narrative around the debate by stoking speculation around various storylines, in what some people close to the former president have described as efforts to distract from and get ahead of less savory discussions involving Trump. That includes conversations regarding whether Trump may preempt his self-imposed timeline for announcing his running mate in the\u00a0leadup\u00a0to or at the Republican National Convention\u00a0next month, and instead announce his vice presidential pick as early as this week. Several of Trump\u2019s senior advisers have told CNN that there are no formal plans for the former president to make such an announcement this week;\u00a0Trump campaign manager Chris LaCivita dismissed one such report speculating as much.\u00a0However, they have repeatedly reserved the right for Trump to potentially change his mind and announce his decision at the debate or at his rally in Virginia the next day. The expectations game Thursday\u2019s debate is the earliest in a presidential race in modern American history. Trump\u2019s numerous policy sessions and conversations with advisers have also touched on how to answer specific questions, including on abortion and protecting American\u00a0democracy \u2014 particularly the events of January 6, 2021\u00a0\u2013 but also how to pivot back to the core issues perceived to be his strengths against\u00a0Biden. Leading up to debate week, Trump has downplayed the importance of preparation. While Biden has hunkered down at Camp David with advisers, Trump hit the campaign trail Saturday and attended multiple fundraisers \u2013 and relished comparing approaches. At his rally in Philadelphia last weekend, Trump quipped that Biden had \u201cgone to a log cabin to study, prepare, no, he didn\u2019t do, he\u2019s sleeping now.\u201d But with the Thursday showdown coming into focus, the urgency to ready Trump has taken on a new tone. While\u00a0his\u00a0team seldom uses the word \u201cprep\u201d when discussing its debate strategy, the former president himself argued that the lead up to the debate was tedious. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to prepare,\u201d Trump\u00a0told\u00a0the Washington Examiner. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to know this stuff from years of doing it. And I know all the leaders, and I know what I know. It\u2019s largely based on common sense. Common sense is not to allow people to come into our country by the millions if you have no idea where they\u2019re from. \u2026 I don\u2019t know, I think debating is an attitude more than anything else.\u201d Trump\u2019s allies hope he focuses less on attitude and more on messaging Thursday. Many close to Trump originally complained about the lack of an audience during the debate, arguing that it would likely be difficult for Trump to build momentum given\u00a0that\u00a0he usually feeds off the energy from a crowd. However, in recent days, some have argued that riffing off the crowd isn\u2019t necessarily helpful, noting that the absence of supporters might make it easier for Trump to stay focused on his message and not dive into what he views as crowd-pleasing rhetoric. \u201cThe moment Biden said to him \u2018shut up man\u2019 [during the 2020 debate], I knew we\u2019d lose the election,\u201d a Trump ally told CNN, and added that the rules dictating that microphones will be muted\u00a0this debate\u00a0might help avoid another similar confrontation. Trump, though, lamented that he won\u2019t have a crowd to take cues from. The rules for the debate agreed to by both campaigns did not allow for a studio audience. \u201cYou have no audience to read. To me, the audience is easier because it\u2019s telling you what is going on, indirectly, with applause or not applause. This room is a sterile, dead room, which is I guess what they want,\u201d\u00a0Trump told the Examiner. Trumps advisers and allies went into debate week trying to temper expectations, painting Biden as a formidable opponent \u2014 and attacking the media coverage of the debate, the format his team agreed to and CNN\u2019s moderators. The messaging is familiar\u00a0\u2014\u00a0the system is rigged, Trump, along with his\u00a0advisers and allies, says,\u00a0an argument\u00a0he\u00a0has deployed in the courtroom, on the campaign trail, and in the aftermath of the 2020 election \u2014 and sets the table for an escape should\u00a0the former president\u00a0not deliver on the debate stage. Much of the shift in messaging came after the team learned Biden was planning to spend a full week at Camp David as part of his debate boot camp \u2014 a realization that one Trump adviser described as a turning point in their plans to try and raise the bar for how Biden may perform. Trump\u2019s top surrogates, including two of his leading vice presidential contenders, Ohio Sen. JD Vance and North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, spanned the airwaves this week to do just that. \u201cWhen he needs to, he can step up,\u201d Burgum, said on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d Sunday, pushing back on what he called \u201ca real effort on the Biden team to try to lower expectations.\u201d Miller told reporters Tuesday:\u00a0\u201cWe know that when it comes to the big events, when it comes to debates, when it comes to the State of the Union, things of that nature, that they\u2019re going to have Joe Biden completely super-soldiered up. He is going to be ready to go. He has a certain muscle memory that kicks in for having done this for 50 years.\u201d Even the former president, who often mocks Biden during his rallies as incompetent, shifted his posture last week. \u201cI assume he\u2019s going to be somebody that will be a worthy debater,\u201d\u00a0Trump\u00a0told the \u201cThe All-In\u201d podcast. \u201cI don\u2019t want to underestimate him.\u201d However,\u00a0that\u00a0didn\u2019t extend to his rally in Philadelphia last weekend, when Trump implied Biden would need help getting \u201cjacked up\u201d for the debate. There is no evidence that Biden has or plans to take performance-enhancing drugs, and the Biden campaign has sharply criticized such accusations.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/26/politics/trump-issues-debate/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_26_politics_media-release-supreme-court-abortion", "text": "For the second time in two years, the public learned of where the Supreme Court was headed in a major abortion case before the justices had formally handed down their ruling, spoiling the court\u2019s highly controlled protocols. The circumstances around the mistaken publishing of an apparent ruling in\u00a0an Idaho abortion case are very different from the norm-busting leak of the 2022 draft opinion\u00a0that overturned Roe v. Wade. But both disclosures showed the limits on justices\u2019 ability to roll out controversial opinions on their deliberate and custom-oriented timetable. Typically, rulings are released on pre-scheduled opinion days with no forecast ahead of time of which cases are coming down. Those mornings, the justices gather in the court to read summaries of their opinions, which are posted online shortly as hard copies are distributed to the court\u2019s dedicated press corp. Every day, agencies, businesses and organizations deal with the premature disclosure of internal information. But for the Supreme Court, it is viewed as a major departure from its culture of confidentiality if even the smallest nugget about what\u2019s going on behind the scenes makes it into public view. The leak of the 2022 opinion overturning Roe \u2013 obtained and published by Politico nearly two months before the ruling was formally handed down \u2013 was a shocking breach of the storied cone of silence around the Supreme Court\u2019s internal deliberations. It prompted endless speculation about the culprit and their political motives, with an investigation by the court\u2019s marshal unable to identify the source of the leak. The internal probe did reveal that the court had surprisingly lax systems that allowed draft opinions to circulate among a wide group of people, with gaps in the technical security that was supposed to protect the court from such exposures. While much is still not known about how a version of the Idaho case ruling was accidentally posted online, it nonetheless comes as tensions at the court are running high, as the justices scramble to catch up with a backlog of undecided cases. The case in dispute is over whether Idaho can enforce its abortion ban in situations of serious emergency pregnancy complications that do not threaten the pregnant person\u2019s life. According to the accidentally released opinion, which was obtained and reported by Bloomberg, the\u00a0majority opted to dismiss the case as \u201cimprovidently granted\u201d \u2013 a move that allows the justices to duck the case\u2019s legal questions while more proceedings play out at lower courts. The ruling, if and when formally handed down, means that an order from a trial judge that had blocked enforcement of Idaho\u2019s abortion ban in medical emergencies will now go back into effect. For now, the Supreme Court\u2019s public affairs office is acknowledging that a \u201cdocument\u201d was \u201cinadvertently and briefly uploaded\u201d by the court\u2019s \u201cpublication unit.\u201d \u201cThe Court\u2019s opinion in\u00a0Moyle v. United States\u00a0and\u00a0Idaho v. United States\u00a0will be issued in due course,\u201d court spokesperson Patricia McCabe said, referring to the names of the consolidated case. IT hiccups haunt the Supreme Court It appears that the posting of the\u00a0opinion Wednesday to the court\u2019s website was the result of a technological mess-up that was easily traced back to the court and one that likely made the opinion public only a day or two before its planned release. That sets it apart from the leak of the draft opinion reversing Roe, in a case known as Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization. The disclosure seemed to be a purposeful move to get the opinion into the public domain. It happened several weeks before the final ruling came down, while the draft was still being polished and \u2013 perhaps \u2013 votes were not finalized. Still, both instances highlighted how things can fall through the cracks even at the country\u2019s most opaque government institution and how 21st century technology can outpace the court\u2019s practices. While the investigation into the Dobbs leak did not determine how the opinion got out, it revealed stunning lapses in the court\u2019s informational security. At least 90 people had access to the draft, according to the marshal\u2019s report. The probe found no indications of a hack, but the report said that there were issues with the court\u2019s IT system that hindered the investigation. Follow-up reporting by CNN revealed that justices were known to use personal emails to send sensitive communications and that so-called \u201cburn bags\u201d to dispose sensitive physical documents went unused. Court employees we also able to print court documents on devices that did not create the \u201clogs\u201d meant to track the printing of documents. Earlier this term, an IT hiccup gave the public another unintended glimpse into how a separate blockbuster case came together. The case, a unanimous ruling in favor of former President Donald Trump\u2019s challenge to Colorado\u2019s removal of him from its ballot, featured a concurrence authored jointly by the three liberals. But metadata from the opinion showed that the concurrence started out as a partial dissent, authored by Justice Sonia Sotomayor, suggesting that it was a last-minute shift in the votes that got all nine justices signed on to the unanimous opinion.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/26/politics/media-release-supreme-court-abortion/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "politics"}}

The meetings with Defense Minister Yoav Gallant came amid a growing spat between the Biden administration and Netanyahu, who has claimed that armaments are being delayed to the intense frustration of Washington. It was the latest spat between the two allies, which have diverged over Israel\u2019s war tactics in Gaza. US officials meeting Gallant this week brought in experts from across the government to engage in \u201cprofessional to professional\u201d discussions that ticked through in exacting detail the current state of munitions shipments. \u201cWe had a very good opportunity to sit down with experts from across our system and go through every single case,\u201d a senior US administration official said. \u201cThis is one of the most complex security partnerships we have, one of the most multifaceted.\u201d The official attributed Netanyahu\u2019s claims \u2013 made multiple times over the course of the last week, including in a video in English released on social media \u2013 to \u201cmisunderstandings\u201d on the Israelis\u2019 part. \u201cThere\u2019s stuff happening literally every day across the US government and across the Israeli system, and we were able to go through everything,\u201d the official said, adding the US was able to clarify the status of certain shipments as they make their way through a complex delivery process. There was \u201creal progress\u201d in developing an understanding of that process and of prioritizing certain cases, the official said, adding there was an agreement to identify any \u201cinefficiencies\u201d going forward. \u201cThis is a massive, massive undertaking, and nothing has paused other than that one shipment,\u201d the official said, referring to heavy payload bombs that Biden paused last month. There are continued discussions on how to resolve that pause. Instead, the official acknowledged there was a \u201ccomplicated, bureaucratic\u201d system that meant some shipments took a long time to be fulfilled. Netanyahu publicly claimed the Biden administration was \u201cwithholding weapons\u201d in a video posted to X last week, claiming that Secretary of State Antony Blinken \u201cassured me that the administration is working day and night to remove these bottlenecks.\u201d While Biden did halt deliveries of the heavy bombs as Israel was preparing for an operation in the southern city of Rafah, other shipments of armaments continued. Since\u00a0Netanyahu\u00a0first took his complaints public last week, White House officials have brushed off some of\u00a0his\u00a0comments as motivated by politics as he works to maintain a fragile grip on power. But they nonetheless caused deep frustration inside the White House. Officials said they had no idea what he was talking about, and described the remarks as \u201cperplexing,\u201d \u201cvexing\u201d and \u201cincorrect.\u201d Netanyahu responded, saying he was \u201cwilling to absorb personal attacks if that is what it takes for Israel to get the arms and ammunition it needs in its war for survival.\u201d By the weekend, the White House said it wasn\u2019t interested in getting into a back-and-forth with the prime minister. \u201cWe have made our position clear on this repeatedly and we are not going to keep responding to the prime minister\u2019s political statements.

{"id": "2024_06_26_politics_congress-predictions-debate", "text": "Lawmakers from both sides of the aisle on Capitol Hill say that one looming question will be hanging over Thursday night\u2019s presidential debate \u2013 how both President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump address concerns over their age and mental acuity. Democrats want the president\u2019s performance to dispel the GOP-propelled narrative that the 81-year-old president lacks the fitness to hold the nation\u2019s highest office, and by extension prove that Trump, who was found guilty in one criminal trial and faces three more, is the one who is unfit to serve. Republicans, meanwhile, are engineering a double-edged expectations game that seemingly raises the stakes on Biden, while lowering them for Trump. Beyond that, Democrats say they want Biden to clarify what he can and cannot do to help the economy while Republicans implore Trump to stay on message and not resort to personal attacks. In conversations with over a dozen lawmakers, both sides acknowledged that a debate performance four months out from election day is unlikely to make or break either candidate, but each side said they had high expectations for the rematch that presents a unique opportunity for both men to outline what they accomplished in four years as president. The chair of the House GOP campaign arm, Rep. Richard Hudson, wants Trump to focus on his record and not go after Biden for his age, telling CNN he doesn\u2019t think that should be a political issue. \u201cI think the American people will get a clear choice between two visions for America,\u201d Hudson said. \u201cIt\u2019s a unique situation when you got two people who have already been president, so you\u2019re not talking about their hopes and dreams, you\u2019re talking about their records.\u201d Trump, who often claims that Biden is mentally unfit, made the baseless allegation\u00a0over the weekend that Biden could use medical supplements,\u00a0or even illegal substances such as cocaine,\u00a0to enhance his performance on the debate stage in Atlanta. While the Biden campaign called the move \u201cdesperate,\u201d it didn\u2019t take long for Trump\u2019s narrative to take hold among House Republicans. GOP Rep. Ronny Jackson, Trump\u2019s former White House physician,\u00a0called\u00a0on Biden to take a drug test before the debate,\u00a0and many Republicans echoed Trump\u2019s empty claims. But House Speaker Mike Johnson tried to tamp down Trump\u2019s rhetoric about Biden\u2019s preparedness. \u201cLook there is a lot of things that are said in jest. Of course, no one expects that Joe Biden will be on cocaine,\u201d Johnson told CNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins on \u201cThe Source.\u201d \u201cPeople are asking will he be on some sort of energy drinks or something?\u201d Republicans also sought to undermine Biden\u2019s many days of preparation ahead of the debate with his team of advisers at Camp David, as a way to muddy the waters. \u201cHe\u2019s doing a ton of prep work. I never heard anything like that, like eight days at Camp David,\u201d GOP Rep. Byron Donalds said of Biden. \u201cSo I anticipate he\u2019s going to come in ready to go.\u201d Democrats argue this new line of attack \u2014 where Biden is over-prepared instead of unfit \u2014is an attempt from Republicans to try and get ahead of the president if he presents himself similar to his State of the Union address where he exceeded expectations just weeks after\u00a0former Special counsel Robert Hur \u2014 who did not press charges in his investigation \u2014 painted\u00a0a picture of the president as a forgetful commander in chief who failed to properly protect highly sensitive classified information. \u201c\u2018Sleepy Joe\u2019 was not asleep at all during the State of the Union,\u201d Democratic Rep. Steny Hoyer, parroting a GOP refrain of Biden, told CNN. \u201cI think (Republicans) are afraid that Biden is going to be sharp, on point and impressive.\u201d At the same time, Republicans have lowered expectations of Trump, claiming his long history of antagonizing CNN sets him up to claim victory no matter what happens given false accusations that have taken hold in Republican circles. \u201cIt\u2019s a no lose\u201d situation, GOP Rep. Kelly Armstrong said, arguing that many Republicans view the network as \u201can uneven playing field.\u201d The jockeying ahead of the debate puts in context how lawmakers are in overdrive trying to claim the narrative on behalf of their respective candidate ahead of the face off. \u2018Put to rest these rumors\u2019: What Democrats think a Joe Biden performance can do Democrats want to see Biden continue to chip away at Republican claims undermining his ability to lead on Thursday, while acknowledging that no single performance could dismantle the GOP narrative definitively. \u201cI am hoping to see President Biden look strong and competent, which I believe he is,\u201d said Democratic Rep. Susan Wild of Pennsylvania told CNN. \u201cI want him to focus on all of the good things that we have gotten done under this presidency, especially in the last Congress, and to put to rest these rumors of him somehow being unfit.\u201d Wild, who was with Biden in Normandy, where a host of recent GOP allegations about the president\u2019s mental fitness originated, described Biden as \u201cperfect\u201d and said lawmakers who have personal experiences with him need to speak out to cut the noise: \u201cI really think that people need to hear those stories.\u201d For Democrats then, the Republican narrative that Biden is too old or unfit to serve stems from a place of weakness. \u201cThey\u2019re sowing doubt because they can\u2019t come for his\u00a0agenda and his platform because it\u2019s incredibly popular with the American people. And on top of that, a lot of good things have been done over the last few years\u201d Democratic Rep. Maxwell Frost of Florida told CNN. Biden \u201ccould have been in the same high school as Donald Trump.\u201d On top of that, Democrats want Biden to stay above the fray and present a clear message. Part of that clarity Democrats are seeking stems from how Biden presents his economic message. Even though the unemployment rate is at a historically low level, inflation remains high. Democrats want to see Biden on Thursday explain what is working and what he deserves credit for, while outlining what can be done to bring prices down. \u201cWe\u2019re not quite where we need to be, but moving in the right direction,\u201d Democratic Rep. Jim McGovern of Massachusetts told CNN. \u201cHe just needs to stick to the facts.\u201d Republicans want Trump to stay focused on policy not personal vendettas Republicans on Capitol Hill hope that Trump can maintain a calm demeanor and not use his spotlight to air out grievances over his conviction in New York for falsifying business records or his other ongoing criminal cases. \u201cI hope he talks about the country moving forward and not past, you know, regrets,\u201d House Foreign Affairs Chair Michael McCaul told CNN. \u201cI want him to be thinking, looking forward, not backwards.\u201d A winning Trump performance at the debate \u2013 according to moderates like GOP Rep. Nick LaLota of New York \u2013 would be \u201cvery policy oriented.\u201d \u201cFocus on the issues. Lay off the personalities,\u201d Rep. Lisa McClain of Michigan told CNN of what she wants to see from both candidates. Senate GOP Whip John Thune had a clear message to Trump: \u201cDon\u2019t take the bait.\u201d But Thune\u2019s House counterpart had a more divisive message. \u201cI think Trump will win it without a problem,\u201d House GOP Whip Tom Emmer told CNN.  \u201cBecause he\u2019s absolutely sharp, has energy, he has more energy than people that are 20 years younger than him and the current occupant of the Oval Office can barely function.\u201d CNN\u2019s Haley Talbot, Morgan Rimmer, Lauren Fox and Ted Barrett contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/26/politics/congress-predictions-debate/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_25_politics_george-latimer-jamaal-bowman-new-york-16-primary", "text": "New York Rep. Jamaal Bowman lost his Democratic primary to Westchester County Executive George Latimer, marking the first defeat for a member of the House \u201cSquad\u201d of progressive lawmakers. The result in New York\u2019s 16th Congressional District is also a victory for pro-Israel groups, which backed Latimer with historic levels of spending during the campaign. According to ad tracking firm AdImpact, the race was the most expensive House primary on record. Bowman, 48, a former middle school principal in the Bronx, was first elected in 2020 after unseating longtime Democratic Rep. Eliot Engel, a pro-Israel hawk, in the primary. That race, much like this one, centered on accusations that the incumbent had lost touch with the diverse, but heavily segregated district, which spans parts of Bronx and Westchester counties. Latimer, 70, a Democratic political fixture for decades who entered the race at the urging of pro-Israel groups, argued that Bowman\u2019s vocal opposition to Israel\u2019s war in Gaza and his combative political style were out of step with the electorate, which includes a significant Jewish population in Westchester. But a campaign that was widely expected to highlight rifts in the Democratic coalition over Israel and Gaza soon morphed into something more fraught, as issues of race and class at home \u2013 papered over for years in a diverse but largely segregated district \u2013 came together to create one of the ugliest Democratic primaries in years.\u00a0Latimer, in arguing Bowman\u2019s political style was unbecoming and mismatched to the district\u2019s electorate, said the incumbent\u2019s \u201cconstituency is Dearborn, Michigan,\u201d the majority Arab American midwestern city, and in an interview last week, argued that Bowman enjoyed \u201can obvious ethnic benefit.\u201d Bowman was the first Black man elected to represent the New York district. Already under fire over his call for a ceasefire days after Hamas\u2019 October 7 attack inside Israel, Bowman damaged any chance of rapprochement with liberal pro-Israel voters when, in mid-November, he told a small gathering of pro-Palestinian protesters that reports of sexual violence by Hamas were \u201cpropaganda.\u201d (He later apologized, acknowledging a United Nations report.) In January, J Street \u2013 a liberal pro-Israel group that previously backed Bowman \u2013 rescinded its endorsement of the congressman, citing broad \u201cdifferences between us in framing and approach.\u201d Latimer celebrated his victory on Tuesday night by telling supporters, in a clear jab at Bowman, that the results meant \u201cwe turn a page and we say that we believe in inclusion of everybody in our representation.\u201d \u201cWe have to fight to make sure that we do not vilify each other, that we remember that we\u2019re all Americans and that our common future is bound together,\u201d Latimer added. \u201cThis country cannot afford to splinter into little pieces and every single representative has to understand the necessity for unity so that we can move forward as a nation.\u201d Bowman at his own election night gathering in Yonkers conceded defeat but looked ahead to bigger fights on the horizon. \u201cWe musn\u2019t ever stop. This race was never about me and me alone. It was never about this district and this district alone,\u201d Bowman said. \u201cIt was always about all of us. Now our opponents, not opponent, may have won this round at this time, in this place. But this will be a battle for our humanity and justice for the rest of our lives.\u201d By the final days of the campaign, progressives had dug in deep in their bid to hold Bowman\u2019s seat amid an advertising onslaught led by the United Democracy Project, the super PAC of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee. UDP spent about $15 million, while another outside group, Democratic Majority for Israel, invested a little more than $1 million. A third PAC, the crypto-aligned Fairshake, also backed Latimer with more than $2 million in spending. The expenditures for Latimer outpaced the spending on Bowman\u2019s behalf \u2013 from Justice Democrats, the Working Families Party and the Congressional Progressive Caucus PAC \u2013 by a more than 7-1 margin. At a rally for Bowman on Saturday in the South Bronx \u2013 outside the district\u2019s border \u2013 Sen. Bernie Sanders warned that the outcome in the 16th District would radiate across the country. \u201cThis election is one of the most important in the modern history of America. It really is,\u201d the Vermont independent said. \u201cBecause this election is not about Jamaal vs. Mr. Latimer. This election is about whether or not the billionaire class and the oligarchs will control the United States government.\u201d Mark Mellman, a longtime political strategist and founder of Democratic Majority for Israel, said that the New York race would have an impact on future contests. \u201cElections carry messages and politicians always interpret elections. And I will say members of the press also interpret elections,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s important that the message of this election be that being pro-Israel is not just wise policy, it\u2019s also smart politics.\u201d But Mellman, who said his group had polling that showed Bowman trailing Latimer by double digits before the television blitz began, insisted the Israel debate sometimes obscured Bowman\u2019s more basic problems. \u201cHe and his language are divisive,\u201d Mellman said. \u201cAnd whether he is talking at the rally the other day, or whether he is talking about Israel in general, or he is talking about other issues, he\u2019s very divisive.\u201d Speaking before Sanders and after Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez over the weekend, Bowman opened with a salty stemwinder aimed at AIPAC. \u201cWe are going to show f**king AIPAC the power of the motherf**king South Bronx,\u201d Bowman said. \u201cPeople ask me why I got a foul mouth,\u201d he added, accusing his opponents of attacking his family. \u201cWhat am I supposed to do?\u201d Bowman on Tuesday night seemed to allude to that moment \u2013 and what his critics and rivals described as \u201cdivisive\u201d rhetoric. \u201cI would like to make a public apology for sometimes using foul language,\u201d Bowman said. \u201cBut we should not be well adjusted to a sick society.\u201d Progressive groups lashed out late Tuesday after the race was called for Latimer. Calling Bowman \u201cone of the most transformational leaders of our generation,\u201d Justice Democrats executive director Alexandra Rojas, whose group recruited Bowman to run in 2020, echoed Sanders days earlier. \u201cThis race for AIPAC \u2013 the single largest outside group spending in Democratic primaries \u2013 is so much bigger than re-electing a Congressman,\u201d Rojas said in a statement. \u201cIt is part of their final attempts to stop a rising tide of a new generation of voters and leaders who refuse to stay silent in the face of injustice at home or abroad.\u201d AIPAC\u2019s political arm entered the primary season pledging to spend, along with its affiliated groups, up to $100 million across the board against candidates critical of Israel\u2019s war with Hamas. But their spending had failed to move the dial in any key races before Tuesday. Bowman, who was among the first federal lawmakers to call for a ceasefire in Gaza, had already fallen out with parts of the district. His occasionally odd behavior \u2013 including an incident when he pulled a fire alarm in the Capitol \u2013 damaged his standing with even some\u00a0liberal\u00a0supporters. Latimer, who is popular with local establishment figures \u2013 including Hillary Clinton, who endorsed him \u2013 entered the campaign as a familiar face promising a more restrained political manner. Latimer is seen as a shoo-in for the general election in the deep-blue district, which would have backed Joe Biden under the current lines by 45 points in 2020. Former Scarsdale Mayor\u00a0Miriam Flisser was unopposed for the Republican nomination.

{"id": "2024_06_26_politics_steve-bannon-supreme-court-prosecutors", "text": "The Justice Department urged the Supreme Court on Wednesday to reject an effort by former Trump aide Steve Bannon to avoid prison while he appeals his contempt of Congress conviction. Bannon, the Biden administration said in a filing, had not met the standard to justify the \u201cextraordinary\u201d exception.\u00a0 A federal judge ruled recently\u00a0that\u00a0Bannon must turn himself in by July 1\u00a0to begin serving\u00a0a four-month\u00a0sentence. Bannon, a conservative podcast host and\u00a0former strategist for Donald Trump,\u00a0asked the Supreme Court last week\u00a0to pause his prison sentence. The longshot request comes months after another former Trump adviser, Peter Navarro,\u00a0failed to receive a similar break\u00a0from the conservative high court.

{"id": "2024_06_25_politics_biden-trump-debate-issues-analysis", "text": "Presidential debates crystalize a quadrennial dilemma for a country contemplating a new political direction. But they\u2019re usually defined more by trivial personality quirks, zeitgeist moments and gaffes than high-level ideological argument. Al Gore\u2019s melodramatic sighs, George H.W. Bush\u2019s unwise glance at his watch, a day\u2019s growth on Richard Nixon\u2019s chin and Donald Trump\u2019s bulk looming over Hillary Clinton remain iconic years after the policy clashes in those debates have been forgotten. And while Thursday night\u2019s debate hosted by CNN between President Joe Biden and ex-President Trump could also turn on a theatrical flurry between two men who openly despise one another, the policy meat of a presidential debate has rarely been so important as in this neck-and-neck White House race. The country is confronting a perilous moment, internally estranged over politics and culture and as multiple foreign policy crises deepen. America faces a choice in November that will lead, like in Robert Frost\u2019s poem, down one of two divergent roads from which there may be no coming back. A charged political backdrop to a vital debate Trump\u2019s attempt to regain the White House, less than four years after he attempted to steal the last election, poses a potentially existential question for the democratic system. The former president\u2019s conservative backers are, meanwhile, proposing an evisceration of the bureaucracy and the politicization of judicial and intelligence leadership posts to reconcile the goals of a GOP candidate sporting one criminal conviction, three other indictments and a thirst for revenge. At the same time, and despite a roaring jobs market, millions of Americans are worn down by high prices and the cost of borrowing. The legacy of a once-in-a-generation pandemic robbed the country of a sense of economic security that Biden promised to restore four years ago but that remains elusive for many. The Supreme Court\u2019s overturning of the constitutional right to an abortion two years ago has opened an ideological and religious schism over reproductive rights that Biden plans to exploit to hurt Trump. But the president is equally vulnerable over an immigration crisis on the southern border that has swamped asylum laws unfit to handle a new generation of migrants fleeing gangs, economic blight and climate disasters. Overseas, there\u2019s a frightening sense of fracturing. The global system that has enshrined American power for 80 years is under extreme pressure from US foes seeking to destroy it, including Russia and the new superpower China. Biden has dedicated his term to expanding NATO to counter the Kremlin\u2019s onslaught on Ukraine and threat to wider Europe. In one rare area of continuity with Trump, he\u2019s intensified a military and diplomatic pivot to counter China, although the ex-president\u2019s plan for a tariff war with Beijing would go far beyond Biden\u2019s efforts to stop a new Cold War turning hot. Israel\u2019s war in Gaza, which incessantly threatens to boil over, is a painful vulnerability for a sitting president, as his rival warns that World War III may be about to spark. Trump\u2019s main critique is that Biden is weak \u2013 a caricature that could resonate with some voters. But his own plans are as nebulous as his unlikely plan to end the Ukraine war in 24 hours and his unprovable claim that conflicts in Europe and the Middle East would \u201cnever have happened\u201d if he\u2019d been in office. And Trump seems more at home with authoritarians like Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, who dream of crushing US power, than democratic allies America liberated in the last cataclysmic global conflict. Some of the ex-president\u2019s former White House officials warn he might try to pull the United States out of NATO, the cornerstone of Western security, if he returns to the White House. Voters must therefore pick between Biden\u2019s traditional internationalist foreign policies and a doubling down by Trump of the populist isolationism that turned the United States from the bulwark of global stability into one of its most volatile sources of instability. Two legacies on display For the first time in American history, two presidents will stand side-by-side on a debate stage with their legacies exposed for everyone to judge. (The only other time a former and current president competed for a second term was in 1892, when candidates didn\u2019t actively campaign, let alone debate one another.) The meeting of incumbents is one most voters would have preferred to avoid. And so far, their fears seem to be realized. The tied race means two candidates either side of 80 are struggling to show they\u2019ve got the policies to fix the nation\u2019s problems. And neither so far has shown the vision to conjure a road map to the future that millions of Americans will inhabit long after both are gone. Trump\u2019s first term and sparse legislative record showed that he sees the presidency more as a channel for his wild personal whims rather than a policy laboratory. But his campaign, as well as allied conservative groups, have drawn up plans that, if implemented, would transform American governance. And a second-term administration stripped of restraining influences that frustrated the 45th president means he\u2019d have far more latitude to do what he wants. One irony of Trump\u2019s first term \u2014 and second term proposals \u2014 is that while he\u2019s shifted the Republican Party away from its corporate heritage toward a more working-class orientation, he pursues policies that disproportionately help richer Americans like himself. In his first term, he enacted tax cuts that favored the better off and he wants to extend them if he gets back the White House. Still, earlier this month, in an apparent bid to court support from hospitality workers in the key state of Nevada, he pledged to eliminate federal taxes on tips. And while he\u2019s proposing a draconian immigration policy, including mass deportations of undocumented migrants, Trump also says he wants more green cards for foreign graduates of US colleges \u2014 a step that may win favor among increasingly influential South Asian voters. The former president has also signaled he\u2019d dismiss Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, in a move that would raise concerns of political interference in the central bank but that could please Americans who want interest rate cuts. And the former president is working hard to enhance nostalgia for the Trump economy that was thriving before the pandemic-induced economic crisis. If he concentrates on economic messaging rather than histrionics on Thursday night, the former president may be able to renew a connection with viewers alienated by his extreme behavior but who pine for easier economic times. Still, Biden is likely to argue that some of Trump\u2019s plans would be economically ruinous, including a proposed 10% tariff on foreign goods that some economists warn could reignite the inflation crisis and raise the cost of goods for US consumers. Biden has a humming policy machine. Several times a week, the president or Vice President Kamala Harris highlights a new aspect of the administration\u2019s attempt to honor its vows to reshape the economy, to lift up working Americans, to cut health care costs, cap drugs prices, create jobs, fight climate change, preserve abortion rights, reduce student debt and lower energy costs. But it is the curse of Biden\u2019s term that his efforts rarely get much credit despite a legislative legacy that is as impressive as any Democrat since President Lyndon Johnson. Part of this may lie in the fact that measures like Biden\u2019s bipartisan infrastructure plan may take years to fully come into force. The president is still yet to figure out a way to claim credit for an economy that rebounded more strongly from the Covid-19 emergency than those of other developed countries while also acknowledging the pain many voters still feel. High grocery prices represent a literal and psychological barrier \u2014 even if the worst inflation crisis in 40 years has now moderated. It\u2019s still hard for many Americans to afford a new car or a mortgage because of high interest rates introduced to lower the cost of living. This leaves Biden badly needing to use Thursday night\u2019s debate to convince voters that he can make their lives better \u2014 and soon. He\u2019s tried it once already. During his State of the Union address in March, Biden praised citizens for authoring \u201cthe greatest comeback story.\u201d But it didn\u2019t do him any good politically. \u00a0In an ABC News/Ipsos poll conducted in late April, voters said they trusted Trump more than Biden on the economy and inflation, their top two issues, by margins of 46% to 32% and 44% to 30%. Post-game coverage of Thursday\u2019s debate is certain to zero in on the best verbal jabs, soundbites and the stamina and energy of the rival candidates. But the most meaningful impact of the clash between Trump and Biden will only begin to unfold after noon on Inauguration Day, January 20, 2025.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/25/politics/biden-trump-debate-issues-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_25_politics_marco-rubio-trump-vp-pick-hopeful", "text": "It was 2022 and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio had just finished debating\u00a0his\u00a0Democratic opponent Val Demings when former President Donald Trump was on the line. According to a source familiar with the conversation, Trump was calling to relish in Rubio\u2019s performance, telling the\u00a0Republican\u00a0senator\u00a0that\u00a0he\u2019d done well and offering to do whatever he needed in the closing days of his campaign to make sure Rubio went back to\u00a0Capitol Hill. Weeks later, Trump appeared at a massive rally in Miami, telling the audience,\u00a0\u201cYou need Marco Rubio fighting for you in the US\u00a0Senate. He is fantastic.\u201d It was a remarkable shift for two men who just six years earlier had been bitterly entrenched in a primary battle for the White House, but also reflects Rubio\u2019s\u00a0ultimate embrace of Trump, whom he learned to work with closely in\u00a0his\u00a0presidency. For Rubio, the last eight years have been an education. In failure. In humility. In navigating a Republican Party overtaken by Trump and a job he was once desperate to leave.\u00a0The story of Rubio\u2019s transformation is not entirely unique for a member of Congress or even a one time foe, but reflects the political reality that surviving in the party at odds with Trump is no longer an option for members who want a future beyond him. And now, as he finds himself\u00a0on the shortlist of candidates who could be selected as Trump\u2019s running mate, Rubio\u2019s evolution is both a liability and perhaps his greatest asset. The Florida\u00a0senator, who nearly left the body after he was defeated in the GOP\u00a0presidential\u00a0primary in 2016,\u00a0has spent the last eight years rebuilding his image in the likeness of a populist in Washington. At the same time, he has sharpened his foreign policy credentials as the leading Republican on the\u00a0Senate\u00a0Intelligence Committee, while building relationships in his party, across the aisle and around the globe. In interviews with lawmakers, aides and GOP strategists,\u00a0many see Rubio as a clear messenger and a figure who could be a reliable conduit to the White House, a key negotiating partner, and in the eyes of Republicans, maybe even a steadying force for Trump if he returns to the West Wing next year. But Rubio, 53, is hardly the same politician whom Time magazine once dubbed \u201cThe Republican Savor\u201d on its cover, nor the person who pitched himself to GOP voters in 2016 as the son of Cuban immigrants and a living demonstration that the American dream was alive and well. Rubio now defends his change, saying the 2016 campaign was an education and one that changed his outlook and approach to politics. Trump was part of it. But Rubio argues that isn\u2019t the whole story. \u201cI got to go to places I\u2019d never been and meet people I\u2019d never interacted with and realized there\u2019s millions of millions of Americans out there for whom the American dream I believed in and was so enthusiastic about, a lot of them thought it was increasingly out of reach. They\u2019d lost their jobs because they got sent to China. They lived in a town where everywhere some shuttered factory or\u00a0boarded-up\u00a0Main Street shop reminded them of a once vibrant town that was hollowed out,\u201d Rubio told CNN in an interview. \u201cYou know in time, you grow to appreciate how Trump gave voice to that sentiment that needed to be heard and that needed to transform our party,\u201d he added. Still, some former supporters who once saw great promise in Rubio as part of a new generation of Republicans now view him as an example of a GOP that has lost its way. \u201cHe\u2019s made a 180-degree transition from being a center-right Republican with certain issues he championed like immigration, to becoming a total Donald Trump follower,\u201d said Al Cardenas, a former Florida Republican Party chairman and one time mentor to Rubio. \u201cHe\u2019s not the only one who made the transition.\u201d From \u2018Republican savior\u2019 to Trump convert The Rubio of today looks very different from the freshman senator plotting his way to the White House more than a decade ago. Back then, Rubio was in his early 40s and already viewed in Florida as an ambitious climber. At age 28, he jumped at the chance to run for Florida\u2019s House of Representatives, leaving behind the West Miami City Council seat he was just sworn into the year prior. He steadily rose up the party leadership in Tallahassee, eventually becoming speaker of the House. Termed out of his seat in 2010, he decided to run for US Senate, pitting himself against his party\u2019s own governor, Charlie Crist. By capturing tea party fervor, Rubio eventually pushed Crist to run as an independent and emerged victorious in the three-way race. \u201cIf you look at his political climb, it\u2019s an impressive climb,\u201d said Cardenas, who once employed Rubio at his law firm. \u201cHe came from being a humble kid, who graduated from law school and barely eked out a victory in a small municipal race. Now he\u2019s a US senator for one of the three biggest states in the country. Anyone looking at it from the outside would say that\u2019s a very impressive rise.\u201d The establishment and GOP donors were reckoning with how to become a more inclusive, big tent party, with immigration reform seen by many \u2013 including a young Rubio\u00a0\u2013 as a way to make inroads with Latino voters who had voted in droves for President Barack Obama over Republican Mitt Romney. Rubio took the opportunity in stride, helping negotiate a massive, bipartisan immigration bill that would have invested more than $40 billion in border security and legalized millions of immigrants living in the US\u00a0unlawfully at the time. The bill passed the Senate, but then stalled out in the House. Rubio distanced himself from it. Then, as Trump emerged on the scene, the trajectory of the party and Rubio\u2019s own path began to shift. \u201cClearly he has evolved along with the rest of the party on issues like immigration and is far more populist,\u201d one former Rubio aide told CNN. \u201cBut, I think he would argue the facts on the ground have changed too.\u201d When Rubio declared his candidacy for president \u2013 even as his friend former Gov. Jeb Bush was laying the groundwork for a run of his own \u2013 the then-junior senator from Florida announced his decision first on a call with donors before a rally in MIami. \u201cMy candidacy might seem improbable to some watching from abroad,\u201d Rubio said when he announced his candidacy. \u201cIn many countries, the highest office in the land is reserved for the rich and powerful. But I live in an exceptional country \u2026 where even the son of a bartender and a maid can have the same dreams and the same future as those who come from power and privilege.\u201d But in the closing days of his campaign, Rubio spared no schoolyard attack on Trump, saying he wasn\u2019t going to \u201cmake America great. He\u2019s gonna make America orange,\u201d mocking the size of Trump\u2019s hands and calling him a \u201ccon artist\u201d vying to take over the Republican Party. In his concession speech in 2016, Rubio appeared to grapple in real time with what had become apparent in the primary:\u00a0Voters weren\u2019t interested in expanding the tent of the GOP with a hopeful message, they were attracted to Trump\u2019s bluster and his populist message. \u201cPeople are angry. They are frustrated and left behind by this economy and then they are told, \u2018Look, if you are against illegal immigration, that makes you a bigot,\u2019\u201d Rubio said. \u201cQuite frankly there are millions people in this country that are tired of being looked down upon.\u201d And in the intervening years since, Rubio and Trump\u2019s relationship has not only thawed, it\u2019s flourished. \u201cI didn\u2019t know him before he ran. I got to work with him and grew to respect the way he functioned as\u00a0president, but when he first ran I didn\u2019t know anything about him other than I knew he was famous and well known, but I didn\u2019t know him as a person,\u201d Rubio said. Asked how he could go from being the butt of Trump\u2019s attacks in 2016 to being as close as he is with Trump today, Rubio fired back, \u201cthat was a campaign.\u201d \u201cThat is like asking a boxer why they punched somebody in the face in the third round. It\u2019s because they were boxing. Doesn\u2019t mean you hate the guy, but we were in a competition for the same job,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe other people are different, but if he was a Democrat and we had a tough campaign wouldn\u2019t everybody be insisting we come back and work together, right? So why not expect that and then some when it\u2019s a Republican?\u201d Mike Fasano, a former state House majority leader in Florida, said he\u2019s unsurprised by Rubio\u2019s political shift. Fasano named Rubio to his leadership team soon after he arrived in Tallahassee, hoping the \u201cshining star of the Republican Party\u201d would also help carry the banner of Ronald Reagan conservativism to a new generation of voters. Instead, Fasano said, \u201cI found out soon after that he went where the wind blew.\u201d \u201cI would have a problem with anyone who demeans me like he was during that campaign when he ran for president,\u201d Fasano said. \u201cAnd then to suck up like he is doing now? But Marco is the type of person who will do that. He\u2019s always been like that. Whatever it takes.\u201d A return to the Senate Rubio returned to DC in the spring of 2016 defeated and intent on quitting politics. His frustrations with Washington at the time had reached a tipping point after just one term in the Senate. And, as one of the upper chamber\u2019s least wealthy members, he appeared ready to cash in with a private-sector gig. None of the Florida Republicans eying his seat (which included a little-known\u00a0congressional back bencher named Ronald DeSantis) much impressed GOP donors and leadership. To try\u00a0to\u00a0change his mind, the\u00a0US\u00a0Chamber of Commerce deployed one of its board members, Frank VanderSloot, an Idaho nutritional-supplement mogul who had helped bankroll Rubio\u2019s White House bid. The two met at Rubio\u2019s office, where VanderSloot said he told Rubio: \u201cAmerica needs him to stay in the Senate.\u201d Rubio would later attribute his change of heart to the deadly mass shooting at Pulse, a popular night club for LGBTQ people in Orlando. The shooter killed 49 people, mostly gay men, and wounded 53 others. Rubio, who has spent his time in public office arguing against gun restrictions and opposing\u00a0same-sex\u00a0marriage, nevertheless told a conservative radio host at the time that he was \u201cdeeply impacted\u201d by the tragedy and that made him reconsider \u201cwhere you are most useful to your country.\u201d Twelve days after the shooting, Rubio jumped back into the race just ahead of the filing deadline. Trump and Rubio\u2019s relationship also evolved quickly. While they sparred publicly on stage, after Trump won, he had Rubio to the White House for dinner, a turning point. And throughout his presidency, Trump relied on Rubio\u2019s expertise of Latin America to help guide him on issues related to\u00a0Venezuela, Cuba and Colombia. \u201cWe used to joke that his side job was being the Western Hemisphere desk coordinator,\u201d one former aide told CNN, noting that Trump called frequently to gauge Rubio\u2019s opinion on matters in the region. When the pandemic hit, it was Rubio and Democratic Sen. Ben Cardin\u00a0of Maryland\u00a0who worked with the administration to swiftly build out the Paycheck Protection Program, a loan program that gave small-business owners around the country a way to finance payroll and other expenditures during Covid. \u201cIt was a really good experience working with him,\u201d Cardin said. \u201cWe had to get a result, and we had to do it quickly so we had to forgo any of the usual shadowboxing that\u2019s done around this place and reach decisions.\u201d Rubio also played a critical role in working closely with Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka Trump and helping design the child tax credit in the GOP\u2019s 2017 tax bill, threatening to initially vote against the package unless the refundability\u00a0of the credit in the bill was expanded, which eventually it was. \u2018Don\u2019t take the good ones\u2019:\u00a0GOP colleagues see Rubio as good pick for Trump In the years between his presidential run and now, Rubio has spent less time building his public profile and more time investing in his relationships in the Senate. In conversations with nearly a dozen lawmakers, many observe Rubio has matured as a legislator and spent most of the last eight years keeping his head down, focused on his role on the Senate Intelligence Committee and being a resource to members. \u201cI think we look to him for good, solid advice,\u201d\u00a0said\u00a0Sen. Lisa Murkowski, a Republican from Alaska. \u201cI think when he moved from the failed effort \u2026 to run for\u00a0president and then back into the Senate, I did see a change. He seemed more focused on some of the policy initiatives he was working on . \u2026 Was that because there was just more time in the Senate or was that because running for\u00a0president can be a bit humbling? It can put anyone down a peg or two.\u201d Members also say they appreciate Rubio\u2019s personal and stylish delivery in dry party lunches when he does speak up, which they say would be an asset if he were selected to be Trump\u2019s VP. \u201cHe\u2019s kind of like a steady horse. He\u2019s not going to speak unless he needs to speak. He\u2019s not one of those flamboyant people who\u2019s gonna try to stand out and be the face of every topic. He stays in his lane,\u201d Alabama Sen. Tommy Tuberville said. Asked whether Rubio has the experience to be the VP, Tuberville nodded. \u201cHe\u2019s the right age. That is the perfect age. He\u2019s been hardened, he\u2019s been called names by Trump himself, so I would not have any qualms,\u201d Tuberville said. \u201cI would hate to lose him in the Senate, but again we\u2019ve gotta do what\u2019s best in the next four years and the eight after that.\u201d Tuberville said he has joked with Trump \u201cdon\u2019t\u00a0take the good ones\u201d from the Senate, but he argues he\u2019s resigned himself to the fact that Rubio might be needed in the Trump administration more than in the chamber. Others see Rubio\u2019s personal story as an added advantage at a time when the GOP has made some inroads with Latino voters in states like Florida, Nevada and Arizona. \u201cObviously, he is Cuban American, and Hispanics are increasingly coming to vote for Republicans. He speaks Spanish. He demonstrates a broader appeal than just a traditional Republican audience,\u201d\u00a0said GOP\u00a0Sen. John Cornyn\u00a0of Texas. Trump has done little to tip his hand in the veepstakes. Rubio is seen as the preferred pick among many donors,\u00a0and two of Trump\u2019s trusted confidants \u2013 Kellyanne Conway and Sean Hannity\u00a0\u2013\u00a0see him as a strong pick for Trump. But while some have gone out of their way to flaunt their allegiance to Trump, Rubio has taken a more nuanced approach, not appearing with Trump at the courthouse in Manhattan with others such as\u00a0Sen.\u00a0J.D. Vance\u00a0of Ohio, another VP contender. Rubio did, however,\u00a0vote against a massive aid package for Ukraine in April, arguing it didn\u2019t do anything to address the US\u2019 own border. Rubio has also been more reluctant to say whether he will support the results of the election this cycle, telling NBC In an interview last month,\u00a0\u201cI think you are asking the wrong person. The Democrats are the ones that have opposed every Republican victory since 2000.\u201d Rubio\u00a0\u2013\u00a0along with other senators\u00a0\u2013\u00a0has also been helping Trump\u00a0prep for the debate on Thursday and will be a surrogate for Trump in the spin room afterward. Rubio does face a potential hurdle as Trump weighs his options. Trump and Rubio both live in Florida, and while there is no law preventing a president and vice president of the US being from the same state, the Constitution dictates that state electors must vote for a president and vice president \u201cone of whom, at least, shall not be an inhabitant of the same state with themselves.\u201d Meaning, Florida\u2019s 30 Electoral College votes couldn\u2019t go to two Floridians. In a close election, that could prevent either Trump or Rubio (presumably the latter) from reaching 270 electoral college votes to assume their office. Rubio is open to moving if Trump selects him, and his residency is not a major concern among the former president\u2019s advisers at the moment, a person with knowledge of both sides\u2019 thinking told CNN. And while Rubio\u2019s ascension to vice president could mean a vacant Senate seat, he says he\u2019s not worried it could be lost to a Democrat. \u201cI would certainly feel a lot better about Florida today as a Republican than I would have a decade ago,\u201d he quipped.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/25/politics/marco-rubio-trump-vp-pick-hopeful/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_22_politics_democrats-elections-what-matters", "text": "With Democrats divided over the Israel-Hamas war, uninspired by their presidential nominee in Joe Biden and planning a convention in Chicago, there have been multiple comparisons to 1968, when Democrat Hubert Humphrey lost the White House to Republican Richard Nixon. The Vietnam War divided Democrats that year. Humphrey was uninspiring to younger voters opposed to the war. There was violence outside their convention in Chicago. Democrats today should hope that a better comparison is to 1948, when then-President Harry Truman, an unpopular incumbent, pulled off a surprise reelection versus Thomas Dewey, then the Republican governor of New York. That year, 1948, was also a much better year for Humphrey, then the young and inspiring Minneapolis mayor who helped push Democrats on the road to embracing civil rights legislation that would ultimately remake both political parties over the coming decades. I talked to Samuel Freedman, a Columbia Journalism School professor, about his recent book about Humphrey and the 1948 Democratic convention in Philadelphia. The book\u2019s title, \u201cInto the Bright Sunshine,\u201d is taken from a line in Humphrey\u2019s rousing speech on civil rights. The crackling audio does not hide the competing jeers and applause when Humphrey says: My friends, to those who say that we are rushing this issue of civil rights, I say to them we are 172 years late. To those who say that this civil-rights program is an infringement on states\u2019 rights, I say this: The time has arrived in America for the Democratic Party to get out of the shadow of states\u2019 rights and to walk forthrightly into the bright sunshine of human rights. It is a particularly important time to remember right now, when there is an effort on the American political right to reinterpret the history of the Civil Rights Movement. Here\u2019s my conversation with Freedman, conducted by phone and edited for length and clarity: Lessons for 2024 Biden from 1948 Truman WOLF: The fulcrum of the book is this 1948 Democratic convention and Humphrey\u2019s civil rights speech there. Until 2016, 1948 was probably the biggest presidential election upset in US history. What could 2024 Joe Biden, who trails Donald Trump in much of the polling, learn from 1948 Harry Truman, who trailed Thomas Dewey right to the end? FREEDMAN: They are very comparable experiences, even with the fact that Truman had not one third party, but two third parties also to worry about \u2013 Henry Wallace to his left and Strom Thurmond to his right. We don\u2019t know about the effect in the tight election of RFK Jr., and even for that matter, of (the Green Party\u2019s) Jill Stein. So Biden has a complicated course to run. Truman went back and forth on civil rights \u2013 he was very bold, amazingly so in 1946 and \u201947, then he backed away out of fear it would cost him the election in \u201848. Really what Humphrey\u2019s triumph with the civil rights plank at the \u201848 convention did is it forced Truman to run as a civil rights candidate, which ended up being the reason he won the race. He really starts it in July, Truman, by desegregating the military and the federal workforce, and he culminates it the last weekend before Election Day, having a rally and giving a campaign speech in Harlem, which no major party presidential candidate had ever done. So I think part of the lesson of what Truman did, for Biden, is to try to be bold, to be assertive, to take some of the risks that need to be taken. Humphrey went from heroic to ridiculed WOLF: Today, we look at Hubert Humphrey as an also-ran of American politics. What were you trying to accomplish writing a book that leads up to this single speech at the \u201948 convention? FREEDMAN: I wanted to fill two gaps. I wanted to, first of all, fill a biographical gap about Humphrey, because if people know him at all today, it\u2019s from a largely disparaged and ridiculed latter part of his career supporting the Vietnam War as Lyndon Johnson\u2019s vice president, getting the presidential nomination in 1968 amid the police riot in Chicago, and then really fecklessly, almost pathetically, running as the establishment candidate against George McGovern for the Democratic nomination in 1972. And yet, there was this amazing chapter in his earlier life when he had been out there in a way few White Americans of the time were, really putting his entire career at risk to fight the fight for civil rights. People who felt betrayed by Humphrey in the \u201960s because he was no longer being a liberal hero forgot why they thought he was a liberal hero in the first place. And what he did in the 1948 convention is the epitome of it, to get the Democratic Party to endorse the civil rights agenda for the first time ever, and to accomplish something that FDR hadn\u2019t been willing to do, which was to defy and ultimately oust the Southern segregationist wing of the party. The other gap I wanted to fill was a historical gap, because a lot of the great writing that\u2019s been done about the Civil Rights Movement tends to position its origins in the 1950s with the Montgomery bus boycott and Brown v. Board of Ed decision, and so forth. And yet, there was all this activity in the \u201940s, very much catalyzed by Black GIs and the Double V movement (victory in the war and victory over oppression at home). You know, very much affected by the global war against fascism, and that activity really anticipates and makes possible everything that happens in the \u201950s and \u201860s, and yet has gotten much less attention, comparatively speaking. So those were the two gaps I was aiming to address. 2024 vs. 1968 WOLF: Humphrey is certainly more associated with that \u201968 convention. This year, there\u2019s obviously a fractured Democratic Party, as there was in 1968, and the convention is again in Chicago. What are the similarities you see between this year and \u201868? FREEDMAN:  There are a couple of takeaways from Humphrey\u2019s campaign in \u201968. One is you\u2019ve got to really hit the right tone. The speech that he made in April of 1968 to announce his campaign was so tone-deaf. It talked about the politics of happiness, the politics of joy, and it was completely out of tune with the tenor of the times. This is like three and a half weeks after Martin Luther King had been killed. It\u2019s just about as long as after Lyndon Johnson decided not to run. There was a massive anti-war movement. It just felt like Humphrey, who usually had such a keen sense of retail politics, totally misread the mood of the country. He struggled, really for the rest of the campaign, to come back to finding a way to stick to things he wanted to stick to about hope and unity and possibility, while trying to find the words, and I think never really quite succeeding, to acknowledge the hurt, the anxiety, the division within the country. It\u2019s also a lesson about the importance of optics, and this is even before the 24-hour news cycle. Humphrey is giving his speech at the \u201968 convention, where in the middle of his speech, the live TV coverage cuts away to show the Chicago police beating demonstrators and journalists on the streets of Chicago. It\u2019s the most catastrophic optic you could imagine. Another similarity is that although Joe Biden has run essentially unopposed in primaries, it\u2019s almost as if he didn\u2019t really have to face the Democratic voting public this year, the way he definitely did in 2020, and comes in as feeling more coordinated and less chosen. In 1968, the Democratic Party was operating under old rules in which primary voters actually had relatively little direct effect on delegates. Humphrey enters late, after Bobby Kennedy had been in, after Eugene McCarthy had been in, and won most of his delegates by going through the party apparatus. So it looked like he had this nomination kind of handed to him by the machine, over and against the passions of the voters, who had turned out in large numbers for Bobby Kennedy and Eugene McCarthy. That also presents a problem of how do you build up the requisite passion? At the end of the day, he did something in late September that almost saved his campaign, which was finally to break away from Lyndon Johnson on Vietnam and to stake out a much bolder peace plank on Vietnam. In fact, it was a peace plank that was defeated at the convention where Humphrey\u2019s forces opposed it. Had Humphrey done that sooner would he have won? Good question. The other important thing Humphrey said, that I think Biden really has to find a way to express, came from the speech accepting the nomination. I\u2019m going to read you this paragraph, because I think it\u2019s so prescient. He says: I say to those who\u2019ve differed with their neighbor or with those who\u2019ve differed with their fellow Democrat, may I say to you that all of your goals, all of your high hopes, all of your dreams, all them will come to naught if we lose this election, and many of them can be realized with the victory that can come to us. That is so exactly right, and it\u2019s something that Joe Biden has to communicate. Just like for people, particularly young liberals, who couldn\u2019t bring themselves to vote for Humphrey in \u201968, what they got was Nixon. What they got was, instead of peace talks and a bombing halt, and an internationally supervised ceasefire, which was Humphrey\u2019s stance by the end of the campaign, they got the war going on for seven more years, with tens of thousands more American deaths and hundreds of thousands, if not millions, more Vietnamese deaths. They got Watergate. They got the race-baiting that Nixon engaged in. They got the proto-Trump pseudo populism of Spiro Agnew as vice president. So there\u2019s a real price to pay there for hanging on to your purity of not being able to vote for Hubert Humphrey and forgive him even the egregious mistake on Vietnam because of everything else he brought to the table that was absolutely consistent with the liberal agenda. Correcting the counterfactual about Republicans and civil rights WOLF: As I was reading the climax of this book, there was an interview on CNN with Rep. Byron Donalds, the Republican from Florida, who was arguing this counterfactual \u2013 and you can find many other instances of it \u2013 that a lot of present-day Republicans are pushing that they deserve credit for the Civil Rights Movement, because Abraham Lincoln was a Republican, because there were Southern Democrats who opposed the Civil Rights Act. This comes up in your descriptions of the \u201948 convention, particularly with Strom Thurmond (the South Carolina Democrat turned Republican). I was hoping to get your historical analysis of that idea. FREEDMAN: It\u2019s preposterous for the Republicans to make that argument in 2024 or at any time in the last 60 years, to be honest. When Strom Thurmond and the Dixiecrats bolted from the Democratic Party in 1948, that\u2019s the beginning of the vast majority of the White South becoming Republicans, stepping away from the Democratic Party. Even though (Adlai) Stevenson in \u201952 and \u201856 and JFK in 1960 tried to lure them back in, it was still the beginning of a process by which \u2013 with Barry Goldwater in \u201964, who opposed civil rights legislation; Nixon\u2019s \u201cSouthern strategy\u201d in \u201868 and \u201872; (Ronald) Reagan\u2019s appeals to racial resentment in \u201880 and \u201884; the Willie Horton ad in \u201888; and then to Trump in all of his races \u2013 that all began in \u201848. Those people who walked out with Strom Thurmond and the voters who voted for them never really went back to the Democratic Party again. While the party labels have remained the same \u2013 there is still the Democratic Party and there is still the Republican Party \u2013 the people who are voting have totally exchanged places, because the parties exchanged places on the issue of civil rights. It\u2019s true that, going back to Lincoln, the Republicans were seen as the party of emancipation and the amendments that created, at least on paper, racial equality. On that basis, until 1948 really with Truman, and then in even larger numbers in 1964 with LBJ and consistently since then, the White Southern vote that used to go to the Democrats, because the Democrats were the party of Jim Crow, has become the solid White vote for the Republican Party. Show me a major Republican politician in the MAGA movement who is a fervent supporter of civil rights legislation. In any kind of iteration, you don\u2019t have (Republicans) now like Mitt Romney\u2019s father, (former Michigan Gov.) George Romney, or (former Pennsylvania Gov.) William Scranton, or Edward Brooke, a Black senator from Massachusetts \u2026 You don\u2019t even have people like Nixon, before he went bad on civil rights, who was a really active member of the NAACP. That doesn\u2019t exist in the Republican Party anymore, and it\u2019s just absurd to say that because 80 years ago to 100, 120 years ago, the Democrats were indeed the party of segregation, that that\u2019s somehow still the case.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/22/politics/democrats-elections-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_25_politics_julian-assange-decadelong-pursuit-inside-plea-deal", "text": "The United States\u2019 pursuit of Julian Assange for leaking state secrets has played out for more than a decade in courtrooms and government offices across the world, from Washington, DC, to London to Stockholm and Quito, Ecuador. But on Wednesday it came to a sudden, somewhat uneasy end, when the WikiLeaks founder pleaded guilty in a US federal court to a single felony charge related to his alleged role in orchestrating one of the largest-ever breaches of US classified military and diplomatic documents. The plea deal allows Assange to avoid prison in the US and return to his native Australia. Discussions between Assange\u2019s legal team and US prosecutors ebbed and flowed across three US presidencies during his yearslong battle to avoid extradition to the US where he faced a trial on 18 felony counts. Australian diplomats brought up the plight of Assange every chance they got during the past three years of the Biden administration, a stark contrast to their behavior during the Trump years, when they largely avoided the matter due to concerns it could harm the broader bilateral relationship between the two countries, according to multiple sources familiar with the matter. \u201cThat never came up in our conversations,\u201d said David Stilwell, the State Department assistant secretary for the Pacific region during the Trump administration. \u201cNot a word.\u201d But in recent months, talks heated up, in part thanks to the efforts of a left-leaning Australian government that came to power two years ago, giving Assange a powerful ally as he waged a protracted legal battle from a London prison. Recent rulings in UK courts favoring Assange in his extradition fight also provided key gains in the saga. At a meeting in the Oval Office as part of an official state visit at the end of October, Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese raised the issue of Assange with President Joe Biden, suggesting that enough time had passed and that the case needed to be resolved. Biden and his team responded positively but made clear they would not interfere with the Justice Department, according to people familiar with the matter. As recently as April, Assange\u2019s attorneys and DOJ prosecutors held discussions about a potential deal. Assange insisted that he would agree to plead guilty only to misdemeanor charges related to his dissemination of US classified documents, people briefed on the talks told CNN. That same month, Australian officials also wrote a letter to Attorney General Merrick Garland suggesting the outlines of a potential deal, including having Assange plead guilty and being allowed to return to Australia, but also leaving open the potential of a felony plea, according to a person briefed on the matter. Biden told reporters at the time that he was considering a request made by the Australia parliament in February for the Justice Department to drop the 18 felony charges brought against him in 2019. Inside the Biden administration, there was opposition from the FBI and some DOJ officials to any deal that didn\u2019t include felony charges, people briefed on the matter said. Some officials also pushed for Assange to be brought to federal court in northern Virginia and face at least some US prison time. In Australia, a senior Australian intelligence source told CNN, there was distinction between the elected government\u2019s preferences and that of the nation\u2019s security services. \u201cNo one here was particularly advocating for his return,\u201d said the source, referring to one of the government\u2019s intelligence agencies, which is part of the so-called Five Eyes consortium of security services from Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the UK and the US. Assange spent the last five years in London\u2019s high-security Belmarsh prison fighting off extradition. He left the facility on Monday to travel to the Northern Mariana Islands for his plea hearing and sentencing before a federal judge there. US prosecutors had asked the court for the proceedings to take place on the same day because Assange was resistant to setting foot in the continental US for his guilty plea, according to a letter from prosecutors. A judge in US federal court on Wednesday in Saipan, Northern Mariana Islands, accepted Assange\u2019s guilty plea and ruled Assange is entitled to a credit of time served at Belmarsh. \u201cYou will be able to walk out of this courtroom a free man,\u201d Judge Ramona Manglona said. A May ruling by London\u2019s High Court that Assange could continue appealing his extradition appeared to change the trajectory of the negotiations, prompting the US Justice Department and Assange\u2019s lawyers to renew their discussions over a plea deal. For US prosecutors, the fact that Assange had already served five years at Belmarsh fighting extradition, and the likelihood that a guilty plea for similar crimes would result in a comparable sentence within the US, added to efforts to try to seal an agreement. The White House said on Tuesday that it wasn\u2019t involved in the decision. But Biden\u2019s comments in April suggest they weren\u2019t putting up any resistance. Assange and WikiLeaks rose to international prominence after the site released massive troves of classified materials from the Pentagon and State Department that were supplied to Assange by former Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning. Assange allegedly goaded Manning into obtaining thousands of pages of\u00a0unfiltered US diplomatic cables\u00a0that potentially endangered confidential sources, Iraq war-related significant activity reports and information related to Guantanamo Bay detainees. Manning served about seven years in prison for her role in the massive leak. Before leaving office, then-President Barack Obama commuted her sentence. A yearslong legal battle Assange\u2019s hearing on Wednesday concludes what has been a yearslong legal battle that stretched across the past three US presidential administrations. The Obama administration believed that criminal charges against Assange posed potential First Amendment concerns because of the role major news organizations played in publishing some documents obtained by WikiLeaks. But the Trump administration pursued the criminal case after taking a second look at the federal government\u2019s investigation, eventually charging Assange with 18 counts that carried a max of up to 175 years in prison, though he was unlikely to be sentenced to that time in full. When the charges\u00a0were made public in May 2019 the Australians felt that they were in a sweet spot in terms of relations with the Trump administration, according to a source familiar with the relations at the time. They were planning a state visit for September 2019 and highly cognizant of the fact that Trump often let issues bleed into one another instead of keeping them separate. As a result \u2013 despite some internal frustration \u2013 they were not willing to risk the working relationship over Assange. Justice Department prosecutors may have brought the case against Assange under Trump but not under Obama because Trump\u2019s first attorney general, Jeff Sessions, prioritized investigating leaks of classified information, according to Adam Hickey, who served as a national security-focused official at the Justice Department under the Obama, Trump and Biden administrations. Sessions\u2019 focus on national security-related leaks was \u201cprobably one of the reasons why the [Assange] case had more traction,\u201d Hickey told CNN. Hickey said he was not involved in the Assange case when he was a senior official at DOJ\u2019s National Security Division from 2016 to 2023. But the Assange case was always going to present challenges for prosecutors. His background was unusual compared to others the Justice Department has charged under the Espionage Act or other counterintelligence and national security laws. \u201cAssange is neither your traditional journalist nor is he a spy or a card-carrying foreign intelligence officer,\u201d said Hickey, who\u2019s now a partner at the law firm Mayer Brown. \u201cSo how that plays out in court would be interesting. [It] could be unpredictable.\u201d Most well-known groups supporting press freedoms, and some major news outlets, opposed the Assange indictment. Some have argued that the case imperiled journalists, even if Assange didn\u2019t operate under the same rules or ethics that guide newsrooms. The Committee to Protect Journalists, Amnesty International, the American Civil Liberties Union and other organizations that advocate for the First Amendment recently raised these concerns while urging the Justice Department to drop the case altogether. \u201cThe prosecution of Assange in the United States would create legal pathways under the Espionage Act and the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act that would allow for the prosecution of journalists who are simply doing their jobs and covering matters of public interest,\u201d the coalition wrote in a letter to Garland last month. Andrew McCabe, former FBI deputy director and a CNN contributor, called the indictment against Assange, \u201ctotally valid.\u201d But he also echoed Hickey\u2019s concern about the uncertainty of a potential trial, telling CNN that court proceedings could be \u201cdivisive\u201d and have a \u201cnegative impact on journalistic activities.\u201d \u201cThe guy deserved to be charged how he was charged but it\u2019s also the right thing to come to this resolution. Both decisions are legitimate,\u201d McCabe said. Stilwell, the former State Department official under the Trump administration, pushed back on the Assange plea deal. \u201cHe knew what he was doing when he did it, and instead of going through regular channels like the inspector general he did it is own way, he did it for himself,\u201d Stilwell said. \u201cThe number of sources and methods we lost because of Assange is unfathomable. Releasing him sets a precedent and is wrong. He should rot in prison or worse.\u201d Others have more nuanced views. Bradley Moss, a seasoned national security attorney based in Washington, DC, told CNN the Assange plea deal \u201cavoids the significant constitutional implications\u201d that would\u2019ve emerged at Assange\u2019s trial, which would\u2019ve happened at the federal court in northern Virginia, where the jury pool includes people in the defense and intelligence sectors. \u201cThere is no longer a concern that the presiding judge would have to determine the extent to which the First Amendment protects members of the media, who themselves do not hold security clearances, from criminal prosecution under the Espionage Act,\u201d Moss said, adding that past US administrations have \u201cavoided touching\u201d this third rail. He also said that after Assange\u2019s dozen years in de facto detention \u2013 seven years at the Ecuadorian embassy in London and then five years in British jails \u2013 in the eyes of federal prosecutors, \u201cthere is no more blood to be squeezed from this proverbial rock.\u201d This story has been updated with additional details.

{"id": "2024_06_26_politics_social-media-disinformation-supreme-court-ruling", "text": "The Supreme Court on Wednesday said the White House and federal agencies such as the FBI may continue to urge social media platforms to take down content the government views as misinformation, handing the Biden administration a technical if important election-year victory. Of immediate significance, the decision means that the Department of Homeland Security may continue to flag posts to social media companies such as Facebook and X that it believes may be the work of foreign agents seeking to disrupt this year\u2019s presidential race. Rather than delving into the weighty First Amendment questions raised by the case, the court ruled that the state and social media users who challenged the Biden administration did not have standing to sue. Justice Amy Coney Barrett wrote the opinion for a 6-3 majority. \u201cTo establish standing, the plaintiffs must demonstrate a substantial risk that, in the near future, they will suffer an injury that is traceable to a government defendant and redressable by the injunction they seek,\u201d Barrett wrote. \u201cBecause no plaintiff has carried that burden, none has standing to seek a preliminary injunction.\u201d Biden administration officials have for years tried to persuade social media platforms to take down posts featuring misinformation about vaccines, the Covid-19 pandemic and the 2020 election, among other things. Many of those posts, the government has said, ran afoul of the platforms\u2019 own stated policies. Republican officials in two states \u2013 Missouri and Louisiana \u2013 and five social media users sued over that practice in 2022, arguing that the White House did far more than \u201cpersuade\u201d the tech giants to take down a few deceptive items. Instead, they said, the Biden administration engaged in an informal, backdoor campaign of coercion to silence voices it disagreed with \u2013 a practice known as \u201cjawboning.\u201d They pointed to the decision by social media companies to\u202fsuppress coverage of Hunter Biden\u2019s laptop\u202fin late 2020 as evidence of unconstitutional government influence. But internal communications related to Twitter\u2019s handling of the laptop story highlighted how high-level company officials\u202fwere divided\u202fon whether to suppress coverage of the story, contrary to suggestions by some critics that the platform demoted it because of government pressure. The plaintiffs also claimed the FBI leaned on platforms to remove content it identified as \u201cforeign\u201d when the posts were, in fact, written by Americans. Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan, Brett Kavanaugh and Ketanji Brown Jackson were in the 6-3 majority. Alito says court is ignoring threats to free speech Justice Samel Alito, joined by Justice Clarence Thomas and Justice Neil Gorsuch, wrote a dissent that dubbed the case \u201cone of the most important free speech cases to reach this Court in years.\u201d He said the challengers had brought forward enough evidence to establish standing. \u201cThe Court, however, shirks that duty and thus permits the successful campaign of coercion in this case to stand as an attractive model for future officials who want to control what the people say, hear, and think,\u201d Alito wrote. \u201cThat is regrettable.\u201d He called the conduct of the officials sued in the case \u201cunconstitutional,\u201d \u201ccoercive\u201d and \u201cdangerous.\u201d \u201cIt was blatantly unconstitutional, and the country may come to regret the Court\u2019s failure to say so,\u201d Alito wrote. His 34-page dissent went through the details of the case as he sought to counter the court\u2019s conclusions that the challengers\u2019 lacked standing, while also addressing the merits of their claims. \u201cFor months, high-ranking Government officials placed unrelenting pressure on Facebook to suppress Americans\u2019 free speech. Because the Court unjustifiably refuses to address this serious threat to the First Amendment, I respectfully dissent,\u201d Alito said. Biden administration was blocked last year The case challenged the US government\u2019s ability to shape public debates about major issues that once played out in newspaper op-ed pages but that now largely unfold online. And it questioned the government\u2019s power to partner with private-sector organizations to combat large-scale societal threats. The government argued that the social media plaintiffs didn\u2019t have standing to sue, in part because their content was \u201cmoderated\u201d before the administration started flagging suspect posts to the platforms. The Biden administration argued that the states also lacked standing, in part because they relied on a \u201ca handful of past incidents of content moderation, unconnected to any specific governmental actions.\u201d A federal judge in Louisiana who initially reviewed the case\u202fblocked the White House\u202fand a slew of federal agencies from communicating with social media companies about removing content in a sweeping preliminary injunction last year. A three-judge panel of the conservative 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals scaled back the injunction last fall, narrowing its scope to a few agencies it said likely violated the First Amendment: The White House, US Surgeon General Vivek Murthy, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency and the FBI. The New Civil Liberties Alliance, which represented the private plaintiffs in the case, framed the decision as declaring \u201copen season on Americans\u2019 free speech rights.\u201d \u201cThe government can press third parties to silence you, but the Supreme Court will not find you have standing to complain about it absent them referring to you by name apparently,\u201d said the group\u2019s senior litigation counsel, John Vecchione. \u201cThis is a bad day for the First Amendment.\u201d But other groups said the decision struck a balance between free speech and public safety online. Wednesday\u2019s decision highlights online platforms\u2019 responsibility to the public, said Sacha Haworth, executive director of the Tech Oversight Project, a group that has been critical of the tech industry. \u201cThis ruling correctly affirms the federal government\u2019s right to notify the platforms about credible digital threats from foreign and domestic actors and puts the onus on tech companies to take those threats seriously,\u201d Haworth said. Google and Meta declined to comment. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre praised the ruling. \u201cThe Supreme Court\u2019s decision is the right one, and it helps ensure the Biden Administration can continue our important work with technology companies to protect the safety and security of the American people, after years of extreme and unfounded Republican attacks on public officials who engaged in critical work to keep Americans safe,\u201d\u00a0Jean-Pierre said in a statement. Another defeat for the 5th Circuit The opinion is another sign the Supreme Court may be exasperated with the 5th Circuit, said Steve\u00a0Vladeck, CNN Supreme Court analyst and professor at the University of Texas School of Law. Earlier this month, the court rejected an attempt to block the use of the abortion pill mifepristone. \u201cFor the second time in 13 days, a cross-ideological majority has thrown out a controversial lawsuit that right-wing plaintiffs had deliberately steered to the 5th Circuit,\u201d Vladeck said. \u201cJust like in the mifepristone case, the lawsuit was brought in a single-judge division; the district court entered nationwide relief; the 5th Circuit upheld much of the relief; and the Supreme Court held that these plaintiffs should never have been allowed to bring this case in the first place,\u201d Vladeck added. \u201cThe real question is whether, given this pattern, the lower courts in Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas actually get the message.\u201d During oral arguments in March, several of the court\u2019s conservatives appeared skeptical of the states\u2019 position. In a series of hypothetical questions, Roberts, Kavanaugh and Barrett signaled concern about setting a standard that restricted the government\u2019s ability to communicate with the platforms over content that might be problematic. That might include, the justices theorized, social media threats targeting public figures or disclosures of sensitive information about US troops. The case arrived at the high court at a time when the government has repeatedly warned of foreign efforts to use social media to influence elections. The Director of National Intelligence predicted in February that China\u2019s \u201cgrowing efforts to actively exploit perceived US societal divisions using its online personas\u201d would \u201cmove closer to Moscow\u2019s playbook\u201d this year. The jawboning case was one of several high-profile matters the court is deciding at intersection of the First Amendment and social media. In another, officials in Florida and Texas are defending separate laws designed to bar the platforms from throttling conservative views. Alito returns to Supreme Court for opinion but Gorsuch absent Alito returned to the Supreme Court bench on Wednesday after missing two days last week. But Justice Neil Gorsuch, a fellow conservative, did not appear as the court handed down two opinions. A spokeswoman for the court did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Gorsuch on Wednesday. The court did not say why Alito had been absent.

{"id": "2024_06_20_politics_trump-vice-president-auditions-analysis", "text": "Being Donald Trump\u2019s vice president didn\u2019t end well for Mike Pence \u2014 but there\u2019s no sign his painful split from the ex-president over his anti-constitutional demands is scaring off any of the hopefuls keen to slip into his shoes. The presumptive GOP nominee\u2019s search for a new number two is expected to culminate with a dramatic unveiling at the Republican National Convention in a month, likely choreographed to engineer a TV ratings bump. At various points, the list of possible contenders has included Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance, North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, New York Rep. Elise Stefanik, Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton, Florida Rep. Byron Donalds and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson. Trump shattered all conventions about the business of running for president and serving in the Oval Office. And putting potential running mates through a televised audition process is no exception. The old school playbook in which possible nominees feign a lack of interest in the post to maximize their chances of getting it is antithetical to Trump\u2019s way of operating. Possible picks trying to catch Trump\u2019s eye go on television, knowing he\u2019s probably watching, and sprinkle compliments, talk up his chances of winning, amplify his voter fraud conspiracy theories and slam his criminal conviction. Some have made clear that they wouldn\u2019t have done what Pence did on January 6, 2021, when he concluded that he did not have power to change the outcome of the 2020 election in Congress. The almost total adoption of Trump\u2019s mantras suggests that the experience of the last Republican vice president \u2014 who was hunted with calls of \u201cHang Mike Pence\u201d by members of the Trump mob that attacked the Capitol \u2014 is not giving them much pause. This despite history suggesting that, at some point in their potential mandate, a possible President Trump might ask them to so something that tests their consciences, the law or the Constitution. The attractiveness of the vice presidential nomination may reflect Trump\u2019s magnetism and the heady euphoria of being a key player in the \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d movement. For people who are wired with ambition, whether up-and-coming politicians or those who have always dreamed of the presidency but have fallen short, the vice presidency can be an attractive proposition. The job has many indignities, which include always being overshadowed by the boss, taking foreign trips he doesn\u2019t want to do, and having no real formal duties apart from being a constitutional safety net if the president dies. But the increasing belief among Republicans that the presidency is there for the taking this year \u2014 evident from their bullish public statements \u2014 means a spot on Trump\u2019s ticket is a hot ticket. And morbidly, there\u2019s a chance to be a heartbeat away from the presidency alongside a commander in chief who would be 82 by the end of his term. In many ways, Pence created a template right up until the moment in the last two weeks of his tenure that fractured his relationship with his president and ruined his post-West Wing political career. He could hardly have been more loyal to Trump, even through the ex-president\u2019s botched handling of a once-in-a-century pandemic, and at times that loyalty manifested as misty-eyed veneration. A Trump heir? Trump may not think about what will happen to his MAGA movement when he\u2019s no longer active in politics. But a second-term vice president might also be positioned to become his political heir \u2014 a proposition especially appealing to someone like Vance, a 39-year-old who has transformed himself from a harsh Trump critic to MAGA prot\u00e9g\u00e9. The first-term senator has not been afraid to advance his own credentials. In strikingly frank comments on Fox News on Monday, he said, \u201cIf Trump picks up the phone and calls you, the first sort of thought you have to have with yourself is not just, could I be vice president, but could I stand ultimately in the big chair? And look, if he asked me, I\u2019ll think about it, but I think the answer is yes,\u201d he said. The Ohio Republican said that he\u2019d not been asked about the job by Trump but made clear in an interview with CNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins in May that he wasn\u2019t put off by what happened to Pence on January 6, 2021, after Trump publicly called on him to use his power as vice president to oversee the counting of Electoral College votes to cancel out President Joe Biden\u2019s victory. \u201cI\u2019m extremely skeptical that Mike Pence\u2019s life was ever in danger,\u201d Vance said. He has also made clear to Trump that he wouldn\u2019t have adopted Pence\u2019s interpretation of the constitutional limits on vice presidential powers. \u201cIf I had been vice president, I would have told the states, like Pennsylvania, Georgia and so many others, that we needed to have multiple slates of electors and I think the US Congress should have fought over it from there,\u201d Vance told ABC News in February. \u201cThat is the legitimate way to deal with an election that a lot of folks, including me, think had a lot of problems in 2020. I think that\u2019s what we should have done.\u201d There is no constitutional justification for such a course of action. Vance\u2019s potential rivals for a spot on Trump\u2019s ticket Vance is one of several potential vice presidential nominees, along with Rubio and Burgum, who have been sent vetting materials by the Trump campaign, CNN reported earlier this month. Burgum has taken a classic route of parlaying an unsuccessful presidential campaign into a spot in the vice presidential derby. In some ways, he\u2019s similar to Pence, who was a deeply conservative Indiana governor. The North Dakota governor has also shown the kind of unquestioning loyalty that Trump prizes. He\u2019s rich, a self-made businessman and is the kind of person with whom the ex-president has spent his life in boardrooms and golf clubs. And he\u2019s not flamboyant enough to steal the once and possibly future president\u2019s headlines. Burgum has said that he believes that Biden won the 2020 election, but has also raised concerns about its fairness, playing into Trump\u2019s false claims that changes in electoral practices to account for the Covid-19 emergency amount to fraud. And he\u2019s also endeared himself to the ex-president by downplaying his criminal conviction in New York for falsifying business records to hide a hush money payment to a former adult film star as a mere trifle over accounting. Rubio has taken a lower-key approach compared to some of his rivals. But the Florida senator, who many people in Washington think still nurtures presidential ambitions after losing in humiliating fashion to Trump in the 2016 primary, appears to have been trying to make himself more palatable as a vice presidential pick. He has fervently criticized Trump\u2019s conviction in New York and in May said on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d that he\u2019d only accept the result of the 2024 election if it was fair \u2014 despite the lack of any indication that it wouldn\u2019t be. On the same show, he signaled that despite his past ridicule of Trump on the 2016 campaign trail, and many of his original positions on issues like foreign policy and immigration that seem to clash with the ex-president, he\u2019d be ready to serve alongside him. \u201cI think anyone who\u2019s offered that job to serve this country in the second highest office \u2014 assuming everything else in your life makes sense at that moment \u2014 if you\u2019re interested in serving the country, it\u2019s an incredible place to serve,\u201d he said. More recently, Rubio has been conjuring speculation about a possible inside track to the VP job by joining Trump for policy discussions ahead of the first presidential debate on CNN next Thursday. While most of the focus has been on Rubio, Burgum and Vance, Trump\u2019s unorthodox approach and love of keeping people off balance means that a surprise pick can\u2019t be ruled out. One potential candidate whose star seems to have dimmed is South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, who rolled out a book earlier this year in an apparent bid to boost her chances but became mired in a controversy over her tale of shooting the family dog. In an appearance on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d on June 9, Noem looked like she was trying to revive her candidacy, as she urged Trump to pick a female running mate. \u201cAll the polls tell him in these swing states that a woman on the ticket helps him win. The polls just say that,\u201d she said. Referring to a campaign trip to Wisconsin, a critical swing state, the South Dakota governor said independent voters and those leaning toward Trump \u201calso want to know that their perspective is going to be at the table when decisions are made.\u201d Less than a month before Trump is expected to make his choice, there\u2019s no real clarity on who it will be. And that\u2019s how the ex-president likes it.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/20/politics/trump-vice-president-auditions-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_25_politics_biden-administration-american-military-contractors-ukraine", "text": "The Biden administration is moving toward lifting a de facto ban on American military contractors deploying to Ukraine, four\u00a0US officials familiar with the matter told CNN, to\u00a0help the\u00a0country\u2019s\u00a0military maintain and repair US-provided weapons systems. The change\u00a0would\u00a0mark\u00a0another significant shift in the Biden administration\u2019s Ukraine policy, as the US looks for ways to give Ukraine\u2019s military an upper hand against Russia. The policy is still being worked on by administration officials and has not received final sign-off yet from President\u00a0Joe\u00a0Biden, officials said. \u201cWe have not made any decisions and any discussion of this is premature,\u201d said one administration official. \u201cThe president is absolutely firm that he will not be sending\u00a0US\u00a0troops to Ukraine.\u201d Once approved,\u00a0the change\u00a0would likely be\u00a0enacted this year, officials said, and\u00a0would\u00a0allow the Pentagon to provide contracts to American companies for work inside Ukraine for the first time since Russia invaded\u00a0in 2022. Officials said they hope it will speed up the maintenance and repairs of weapons systems being used by the Ukrainian military. Over the last two years, Biden has insisted that all Americans, and particularly US troops, stay far away from the Ukrainian frontlines. The White House has been determined to limit both the danger to Americans and the perception, particularly by Russia, that the US military is engaged in combat there. The State Department has explicitly warned Americans against traveling to Ukraine since 2022. As a result, US-provided military equipment that has sustained significant damage in combat has had to be transported out of the country to Poland, Romania, or other NATO countries for repairs, a process which takes time. \u00a0US troops are also available to help the Ukrainians with more routine maintenance and logistics, but only from afar via video chat or secure phone\u2014an arrangement that has come with inherent limitations, since US troops and contractors are not able to work directly on the systems. Administration officials began to seriously reconsider those restrictions over the last several months, officials said, as Russia continued to make gains on the battlefield and US funding for Ukraine stalled in Congress. Allowing experienced, US government-funded American contractors to maintain a presence in Ukraine means they will be able to help fix damaged, high-value equipment much faster, officials said. One advanced system that officials say will likely require regular maintenance is the F-16 fighter jet, which Ukraine is set to receive later this year. Companies bidding for the contracts would be required to develop\u00a0robust risk mitigation plans to mitigate threats to their employees, an official said. The discussions follow a series\u00a0of decisions the US has made in recent months to try to help Ukraine beat back the Russians. In late-May, Biden gave Ukraine permission to strike targets inside Russia, near the border with the Ukrainian city of\u00a0Kharkiv, with US weapons\u2014a request the US had repeatedly denied in the past. Last week, that policy appeared to expand once again, when National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said Ukraine could counterstrike anywhere along the Ukraine-Russia border using US weapons. Current and former officials familiar\u00a0with the discussions\u00a0about deploying\u00a0contractors to Ukraine emphasized that the policy change will not result in the kind of overwhelming American contractor presence there that existed in Iraq and Afghanistan.

Chief Justice Annette Ziegler called for the investigation after Wisconsin Watch reported on the draft order that it obtained. The order as reported by Wisconsin Watch said the court would hear the court challenge, but it was not a ruling on the case itself. \u201cToday the entire court was shocked to learn that a confidential draft document was ostensibly leaked to the press,\u201d Zielger said in a statement. \u201cI have contacted law enforcement to request that a full investigation be conducted.\u201d She said all seven justices were \u201cunited behind this investigation to identify the source of the apparent leak. The seven of us condemn this breach.\u201d Ziegler is part of a three-justice conservative minority on the court. The draft order did not indicate which justices were in favor of accepting the abortion case, and there were no dissents indicated, according to Wisconsin Watch. Planned Parenthood brought the lawsuit in February. It asks the Wisconsin Supreme Court to overturn a 175-year-old state law that conservatives have interpreted as an abortion ban. That is the second abortion-related lawsuit before the court. The Wisconsin Supreme Court has not said whether it will accept the appeal of a lower court ruling won by Democratic Attorney General Josh Kaul. He challenged the 1849 law as too old to enforce and trumped by a 1985 law that allows abortions up to the point when a fetus could survive outside the womb. Dane County Circuit Judge Diane Schlipper ruled last year that the law only prohibits attacking a woman with the intent to kill her unborn child. The decision emboldened Planned Parenthood to resume offering abortions in Wisconsin after stopping procedures in response to the US Supreme Court ruling overturning Roe v. Wade. Sheboygan County District Attorney Joel Urmanski, a Republican, has appealed and asked the state Supreme Court to take the case directly without waiting for a lower appellate ruling. The draft order in the Planned Parenthood case did not address the other lawsuit, according to Wisconsin Watch. The abortion cases are among the highest profile before the court that flipped to liberal control in 2023. The court in December threw out Republican-drawn legislative maps, handing Democrats a huge win that resulted in the Legislature adopting new boundaries drawn by Democratic Gov. Tony Evers. The court has also heard a lawsuit that would restore the use of absentee ballot drop boxes, a closely watched case in battleground Wisconsin. A ruling on that case is expected soon given that the court\u2019s term ends next week.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/26/politics/wisconsin-supreme-court-abortion-draft-order-leaks/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "politics"}}

John Curtis won the state\u2019s Republican Senate primary, overcoming a challenger backed by Donald Trump in the race to succeed retiring GOP Sen. Mitt Romney. Curtis, 64, won a four-way primary that included Riverton Mayor Trent Staggs, who had the backing of the former president and the state Republican Party. Curtis will be heavily favored in the November general election in the deep-red state that last elected a Democrat to the US Senate in 1970. Though anti-Trump Republicans are losing a standard-bearer in Romney, Curtis has also kept the former president at arm\u2019s length in a state that, while heavily Republican,\u00a0has not\u00a0 always rewarded the most strident conservative candidates in GOP primaries. Curtis did not back Trump during this year\u2019s\u00a0Republican\u00a0presidential primary \u2013 though he did largely vote with the former president during Trump\u2019s term in office. The founder and chairman of the Conservative Climate Caucus in Washington, Curtis regularly hosts what he has called \u201chiking town hall\u201d events at which he invites voters to chat with him while he plays tour guide through some of the state\u2019s most scenic spots. Trump announced his support for Staggs in April, hours before the mayor qualified for the primary ballot by defeating Curtis at the state party convention. Such gatherings tend to be dominated by party hard-liners, and winners haven\u2019t always found success in primaries, which attract a broader swath of Republican voters. (Curtis qualified for the primary ballot by turning in enough signatures.)

{"id": "2024_06_20_politics_colin-allred-border-texas-senate-race", "text": "Democratic Rep. Colin Allred of Texas, who\u2019s challenging GOP Sen. Ted Cruz in the Republican-leaning state this fall, is promising to \u201cfix the border\u201d in a new ad, declaring that he \u201cstood up to Joe Biden on the border.\u201d But just two years ago, the congressman dismissed the issue as one playing out in the \u201cright-wing echo chamber,\u201d despite a sharp increase of migrants at the US-Mexico border at the time. Allred, a former NFL player and civil rights attorney who represents the northeast Dallas area, made his comments in February 2022 as the US was seeing a surge in migrants at the border compared with during the Trump administration \u2013 and even compared with the previous year under Biden, which smashed past records of encounters at the border. Asked about Republicans running on the border \u2013 along with crime, inflation and \u201cwokeism\u201d in the 2022 midterms \u2013 Allred said he thought most voters were focused on inflation and the economy. \u201cI think some of those others may fall into, kind of, the right-wing echo chamber,\u201d Allred told CBS News\u2019 Major Garrett on \u201cThe Takeout\u201d podcast. \u201cI don\u2019t hear a lot about the border here in Dallas, and I\u2019m in a border state. Obviously, we want to have comprehensive immigration reform. We want to try and, you know, address some of these things,\u201d Allred said. \u201cBut it\u2019s not \u2013 I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a top-of-mind issue,\u201d he added, going on to say that he believed voters were still frustrated about Covid-19. In February 2022, US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) recorded 166,010 encounters with migrants at the US-Mexico border, reflecting a significant increase from the 101,099 encounters in the same month the previous year \u2013 a rise of 64%. That surge was part of a larger trend in 2022, which saw a then-record 2.4 million migrant encounters \u2013 a huge increase compared with during the Trump administration, which saw its highest annual total enforcement actions in fiscal year 2019 with 1.15 million. By comparison, fiscal year 2021, which covered part of Biden\u2019s first year in office, saw 1.95 million total enforcement actions. Though Allred dismissed the political importance of the border at the time, a University of Texas/Texas Tribune poll from June 2021 found that 34% of Texas voters identified immigration and border security, combined, as the biggest concerns for the state (each at 17%) \u2013 ahead of Covid at just 5%. Today, border issues are an even greater concern for Texas voters. A University of Texas/Texas Politics Project poll in April found a significant majority of Texas voters described migrants crossing the US-Mexico border as a crisis (48%) or a very serious problem but not a crisis (23%). In his race to unseat Cruz, Allred is now spending at least $380,000 running an online ad exclusively dedicated to the border issue. Allred did not publicly announce the ad, as he has done for previous ads. \u201cI\u2019m Colin Allred. Fentanyl is flooding into our country. Our border is broken, and so are our politics. To fix it, we have to go after the cartels and fix the border,\u201d Allred says in the ad. \u201cBut we\u2019ve got to do it in a way that upholds our values. Values passed down from my grandfather \u2013 a customs officer in Brownsville. I stood up to Joe Biden on the border and to extremists like Ted Cruz, who prefer chaos to real solutions. I\u2019m Colin Allred. I\u2019m running for Senate to fix this problem.\u201d The ad is running online, where Google ad transparency data shows that Allred has spent at least $280,000 promoting two versions of the spot that run 30 and 15 seconds \u2013 and have been shown more than 11 million times. On Facebook, Allred has spent more than $100,000 running the ad. In a statement to CNN, Allred campaign spokesperson Josh Stewart said: \u201cSince his first days in Congress, Congressman Allred has focused on bipartisan solutions to fix our broken immigration system and secure our border. During his 12 years in the Senate, Ted Cruz has shown that he only wants to play politics with the crisis at the border and that he will never be part of a bipartisan solution.\u201d A shift on the border Allred \u2013 who was first elected to Congress in 2018 by flipping a GOP-held seat in the Dallas suburbs \u2013 has sought to toughen many of his stances on the border and immigration enforcement ahead of the statewide election in November. He joined a Democratic-led border security task force this spring and said he supported the border security bill introduced earlier this year that was killed by\u00a0Republicans. That bill did not contain provisions for any undocumented immigrants, including a pathway to citizenship, which Allred has long pushed for, but he called it \u201ca much-needed step\u201d on immigration reform. Allred has also shifted his rhetoric on a border wall popularized by Trump. At a January 2018 town hall, when he was running to unseat GOP Rep. Pete Sessions, Allred pledged to personally tear down the wall if it was enacted instead of creating a pathway to citizenship for the undocumented. \u201cThis idea that we\u2019re going to trade this for a racist wall. Absolutely not. If they build that wall, I will be there tearing it down,\u201d he said. He would repeatedly refer to the border wall as \u201cracist\u201d and \u201cwasteful, ineffective\u201d and a \u201cfailed policy\u201d that was not needed over the next few years, though he said in 2019 that physical barriers were \u201csometimes appropriate.\u201d Years later, in October 2023, after the Biden administration announced construction of new sections of the wall at the US-Mexico border, using funds already allocated during the Trump administration, Allred praised the decision. \u201cThis is a necessary step to help Texas\u2019 overwhelmed border communities deal with this current surge of migrants,\u201d he told The Hill, adding that it was \u201conly a partial solution.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/20/politics/colin-allred-border-texas-senate-race/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_22_politics_democrats-legal-challenges-rfk-jr-ballot", "text": "As Robert F. Kennedy Jr. pushes to gain ballot access in all 50 states, Democrats are ramping up their efforts to block\u00a0the independent presidential candidate by filing legal challenges\u00a0seeking to get his ballot petitions thrown out\u00a0in several states. The Democratic National Committee and Clear Choice PAC, a super PAC backing President Joe Biden that is focused on countering third party candidates, have objected to Kennedy\u2019s ballot access in four states in the last month. Some of those challenges have been filed in key battleground states such as North Carolina and Nevada, while others are focused on his petitions in traditionally Democratic strongholds. Each of the filings claims Kennedy violated state laws that stipulate how independent candidates\u00a0assemble the paperwork needed to qualify for a state\u2019s ballot. Democrats are alleging Kennedy\u2019s campaign misled voters to sign their petitions, improperly formed a minor party to ease ballot qualification and committed procedural errors in its petitions across five states. The challenges mark an escalation of a broader strategy launched by Democrats earlier this year to combat Kennedy\u2019s campaign in hopes of keeping the support of voters who backed Biden in 2020 but may consider Kennedy in November, potentially tilting the outcome of an election that\u2019s expected to be decided by narrow margins. \u201cThese challenges are important because they\u2019re part of a twofold strategy. One is educating voters about Robert F. Kennedy Jr.,\u201d\u00a0DNC spokesperson Matt Corridoni said.\u00a0\u201cAnd the second part is making sure that everyone\u2019s playing by the rules.\u201d Following an event in Albuquerque, New Mexico, last week, Kennedy dismissed the claims made by Democrats and projected confidence he\u2019d overcome the challenges. \u201cThe objections are frivolous, and every case that we brought to court we\u2019ve won easily and will continue to,\u201d Kennedy told CNN. Ramsey Reid, the campaign manager for the DNC\u2019s third-party team, said the DNC is working with lawyers across the country to review\u00a0Kennedy\u2019s petitions in every state and search\u00a0for violations of local petition filing laws. \u201cIt\u2019s a basic review of the filings to make sure that they\u2019re following the rules, the rules that everyone else has to play by. It\u2019s very simple, nitty gritty, election law work to look at the dates, look at the details, look at the actual signatures and make sure that they meet the requirements that state laws set out,\u201d Reid said. The DNC formed its team to combat third-party candidates earlier this year, around the same time a team of Biden allies formed Clear Choice. Until recently, both groups have primarily focused on messaging against third party candidates, particularly Kennedy. The DNC has frequently launched billboards outside Kennedy campaign events labeling him a \u201cspoiler.\u201d But the legal challenges raise the stakes of the Democrats\u2019 campaign to block Kennedy as they seek to solidify Biden\u2019s coalition heading into November, with more objections expected as the independent candidate\u00a0submits petitions in additional states. \u201cAnywhere he\u2019s not following the rules, we\u2019re going to be in a position to hold him accountable to it,\u201d Reid said. The Kennedy campaign has strategically timed submitting signatures in some states to reduce the possibility of legal challenges, which could jeopardize his ballot access if successful. Kennedy \u2014\u00a0who first launched a primary challenge to Biden last year before dropping that bid and starting his independent campaign \u2013 has been harshly critical of the Democrats\u2019 opposition to his candidacy, suggesting the effort to keep him off the ballot makes the election less fair. \u201cThe Democratic Party is doing everything it can to disenfranchise people and make sure that people can vote for who they want to using litigation,\u201d Kennedy said in a Fox News interview in March. But Democrats defend their filings against Kennedy\u2019s ballot qualification as a function of the political system working as intended. Matt Bennett, executive vice president at Third Way, a Biden-allied group opposing third-party candidates, argued Democrats have as much of a right to challenge Kennedy as he does to run for office. \u201cThe first mission of a third-party campaign is to get your candidate on the ballot. If he thinks he can do that, well, go ahead and try. But Democrats and our allies are fully within our rights to challenge that,\u201d Bennett said. \u201cAnd if he wins, then he\u2019s on the ballot, and if he loses, he\u2019s not. That is the American system. That\u2019s how it works.\u201d Both the DNC and Clear Choice have filed legal challenges this year to ballot access petitions from other third-party candidates such as independent candidate Cornel West and Green Party candidate Jill Stein. But Kennedy holds a uniquely significant amount of public support for a third-party candidate. In a Fox News national poll of registered voters released Wednesday, Kennedy received 10%, outpacing both West and Stein, who earned 2% support each. In that same poll, Biden earned 43% support, while Trump earned 42%. In a head-to-head matchup between Biden and Trump, the same Fox News poll found Biden with 50% support and Trump with 48%. The margin of error for the Fox News survey is 3%. Kennedy is currently on the ballot in seven states: Michigan, California, Utah, Hawaii, Oklahoma, Delaware and Tennessee. He\u2019s repeatedly pledged to qualify for the ballot in all 50 states and Washington, DC. Ballot access is viewed as a major hurdle for most independent candidates because of the time and resources required to track deadlines, follow state laws and properly file paperwork with each state. Last month, Kennedy\u2019s campaign brought in\u00a0$2.6 million\u00a0but spent $6.3 million, more than double what it raised, according to federal campaign finance records. The campaign paid approximately $2.7 million to one ballot access consulting firm, Accelevate 2020 LLC. Legal battles with the DNC could put additional pressure on the Kennedy campaign\u2019s resources. Legal challenges The Democrats\u2019 latest challenge was filed in Delaware, a blue state where Kennedy qualified for the ballot earlier this year after being nominated by the Independent Party. The objection, previously unreported, centers on discrepancies in the timing of the party nominating Kennedy and filing paperwork with the state. The Independent Party stated it nominated Kennedy and his running mate Nicole Shanahan on January 23, according to a copy of the nominating paperwork reviewed by CNN, approximately two months before Shanahan was announced as Kennedy\u2019s vice presidential pick. In a letter obtained by CNN, an attorney representing the Delaware Democratic Party asked Delaware Election Commissioner Anthony Albence to block the certification of Kennedy and Shanahan or any Independent Party candidate in the state. On Friday, Democrats also organized a lawsuit in Nevada, a crucial battleground state, arguing that because Kennedy accepted nominations of minor parties in some states where he\u2019s gained ballot access, he is ineligible to run as an independent candidate in Nevada. Earlier this month, the DNC helped two New York voters file objections with the New York State Board of Election and a separate lawsuit seeking to\u00a0void Kennedy\u2019s ballot access petition, claiming Kennedy\u2019s petition is \u201cpermeated with fraud.\u201d Some of the objections claim procedural violations, including missing dates, improperly numbered pages, and forms completed not in blue or black ink. But Democrats are also alleging signature gatherers working for Kennedy\u2019s campaign \u201cknowingly and intentionally misrepresented and/or concealed\u201d his\u00a0and Shanahan\u2019s names on ballot petitions. The allegations of misleading voters appear to have some standing. In a separate lawsuit filed by the Kennedy campaign\u00a0challenging ballot access requirements\u00a0in New York,\u00a0the independent candidate\u2019s team acknowledged hiring two petitioning firms in New York who then folded over the tops of Kennedy\u2019s petitions to hide Kennedy and Shanahan\u2019s names. Kennedy\u2019s campaign did not submit any signatures collected by the two firms, according to the lawsuit. Jeffrey Wice, a New York Law School professor specializing in election law, said some of\u00a0Kennedy\u2019s petition signatures could get thrown out because of New York\u2019s unique ballot access laws that pose obstacles especially for third-party candidates. \u201cIt could very well be a legitimate claim because New York has very specific requirements on what goes on the petitions in terms of the signature and the address of the voter,\u201d Wice said. \u201cNew York has a very complicated election system. These laws were designed, essentially, decades back to help incumbents stay in office,\u201d he added. The DNC\u2019s efforts to block Kennedy\u2019s ballot access are aided by Clear Choice.\u00a0The PAC\u00a0has also filed an objection in New York that home in on questions around Kennedy\u2019s listed residence.\u00a0His New York petitions listed an address in Katonah, New York, as his residence, despite being based primarily in Los Angeles. Kennedy has previously denied reports that he doesn\u2019t live at the Katonah\u00a0residence. Clear Choice has also filed an objection to Kennedy\u2019s ballot petition in battleground North Carolina earlier this month, arguing that the We The People party,\u00a0which was formed by Kennedy\u2019s campaign, wrongly circumvents state laws governing political parties by being tied to Kennedy\u2019s campaign. Clear Choice also argues an incorrect residence listed by a We The People party official could potentially invalidate several pages of Kennedy\u2019s signatures. The Kennedy campaign has shown some success in fighting for ballot access in the courtroom already. After Democrats objected to the Kennedy campaign\u2019s formation of the We The People party in Hawaii, Kennedy campaign staffers successfully defended the formation of the\u00a0party in a state elections office hearing, ensuring ballot access in the state. Kennedy\u2019s lawyers have used lawsuits in multiple states to successfully push back petition deadlines, including in Utah, where Kennedy has qualified for the ballot. But Democrats insist they will continue to fight Kennedy\u2019s petitions in court, further complicating Kennedy\u2019s path to nationwide ballot access.\u00a0The lawsuits, Democrats acknowledge, are an indication of the potential impact Kennedy could have on the race in states where he does make the ballot. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to sit on our hands and leave opponents unchecked, though. We\u2019ve seen in past elections what happens when you don\u2019t take threats seriously,\u201d Corridoni said. \u201cWe view Robert F. Kennedy on the ballot as a threat to stopping President Biden winning reelection.\u201d CORRECTION: This story has been updated to reflect the correct university where Jeffrey Wice serves as a professor.\u00a0", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/22/politics/democrats-legal-challenges-rfk-jr-ballot/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_26_politics_supreme-court-abortion-idaho-bloomberg", "text": "The Supreme Court appears poised to temporarily allow abortions in medical emergencies in Idaho, Bloomberg News reported Wednesday, citing a document that was inadvertently posted on the court\u2019s website in an astonishing breach of protocol. The unsigned opinion showed that three conservatives \u2013 Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett \u2013 sided with the court\u2019s three liberals to block the state from enforcing the ban in certain emergency situations. The court acknowledged a document was briefly posted, but stressed that no opinion is final until announced by the justices. The abortion case is considered among the most significant of the current term that is winding down ahead of the July 4 holiday. It\u2019s the second time in two years that a major decision dealing with an abortion case has been prematurely released. Two years ago, Politico obtained a draft of the high court\u2019s opinion overturning Roe v. Wade \u2013 a document that was substantially the same as the final opinion the court released weeks later. At issue is Idaho\u2019s strict abortion ban, which provides an exception for the life of the pregnant woman. The Biden administration argued that a federal law also requires hospitals to perform abortions in cases where the health of the pregnant woman is at stake. The decision means that an order from a trial judge that had blocked enforcement of Idaho\u2019s abortion ban in medical emergencies would go back into effect while the case continues to be argued in lower courts. Such a ruling is a temporary win for the Biden administration and will be a relief to Idaho women who fear medical complications from their pregnancies could jeopardize their heath. But it would leave unresolved the central question of whether federal law protects access to abortion in medical emergencies, and it is not likely to end the precariousness and uncertainty that doctors have felt about how to navigate strict abortion bans while caring for their patients. \u201cIf the reporting is accurate, this would be a significant but temporary victory for the Biden administration,\u201d said Steve Vladeck, CNN Supreme Court analyst and professor at the University of Texas School of Law. A Supreme Court spokeswoman, Patricia McCabe,  confirmed that a \u201cdocument\u201d was \u201cinadvertently and briefly uploaded\u201d to the court\u2019s website. She stressed that the opinion in the case \u201chas not been released\u201d and would be \u201cissued in due course.\u201d Here\u2019s what to know about what happened Wednesday: Where the conservatives and liberals agreed The copy reviewed by Bloomberg showed the court voting 6-3 to allow the emergency abortions to take place in Idaho on a temporary basis while the case continues. But they did so for slightly different reasons. The court\u2019s three liberals argued in a concurrence by Justice Elena Kagan that the court erred when it allowed the state to enforce the law temporarily while the Supreme Court considered the case. The state ban, Kagan wrote, \u201cprevents hospitals from doing\u201d what the federal law commands. The decision \u201cwill again give Idaho women access to all the needed medical treatments that EMTALA guarantees.\u201d Justice Amy Coney Barrett, in a separate concurrence joined by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Brett Kavanaugh, made a slightly different point. Barrett argued that Idaho appears to be able to enforce its ban \u201cin the vast majority of circumstances.\u201d Barrett\u2019s point is that she doesn\u2019t believe there\u2019s a significant conflict between the Biden administration and Idaho because of changes that were made to the Idaho law as the litigation unfolded. The Department of Justice and the White House declined to comment on Bloomberg\u2019s story and the mistakenly posted document until the Supreme Court\u2019s official opinion is released. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson agreed with the decision to temporarily block enforcement of the Idaho ban but she dissented from the court\u2019s decision to dismiss the case. Liberals and abortion-rights groups worry about the future case How abortion bans have been playing out in medical emergencies has emerged as a particularly explosive political flashpoint in the fallout of Roe v. Wade\u2019s reversal. The Idaho ban at issue allowed abortions if a pregnant woman\u2019s life was at stake, but not her health. Six states have bans like Idaho\u2019s that include no exception for the health of a pregnant woman, the Justice Department has said, though several of those laws are the subject of litigation. The Biden administration argued Idaho\u2019s ban could force patients to, for instance, endure hysterectomies and other lifelong complications if doctors declined to provide an abortion in the emergency room. A US District Court in Idaho last year blocked enforcement of the state law. A three-judge panel of the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals paused that decision, allowing the law to take effect. Weeks later, the full 9th Circuit reversed the panel\u2019s decision, putting enforcement of the law on hold again. In January, the Supreme Court\u00a0agreed to decide the case\u00a0and allowed the state law to take effect while it did so. Abortion-rights groups have been careful not to celebrate the finding in the document, instead saying that the justices\u2019 ruling would merely delay a future decision that may restrict abortion access in emergency situations. Jackson wrote separately to say that she wouldn\u2019t have dismissed the case. \u201cToday\u2019s decision is not a victory for pregnant patients in Idaho. It is delay,\u201d she wrote. \u201cWhile this court dawdles and the country waits, pregnant people experiencing emergency medical conditions remain in a precarious position, as their doctors are kept in the dark about what the law requires.\u201d It was particularly wrong, Jackson said, because the court had for months allowed Idaho\u2019s strict abortion law to remain in effect. \u201cIt is too little, too late for the Court to take a mulligan and just tell the lower courts to carry on as if none of this has happened,\u201d Jackson wrote. The Justice Department sued Idaho over its abortion ban in August 2022, a few weeks before it was scheduled to take effect. It argued that a federal law known as the Emergency Medical Treatment & Labor Act \u2013 or EMTALA \u2013 required hospitals that receive Medicare funding to offer the procedure in medical emergencies. The law, passed in 1986, requires those hospitals to provide \u201cstabilizing\u201d treatments for emergency room patients who are facing serious harm to their bodily functions. Congress enacted EMTALA to stop hospitals from turning away patients who could not afford their care. The law does not specify which procedures hospitals must perform to stabilize patients and Idaho accused the Biden administration of wrongly interpreting the Reagan-era law to \u201ccreate a nationwide abortion mandate in hospital emergency rooms.\u201d The state also argued that changes to the abortion law since its enactment meant doctors could adhere to EMTALA and the ban simultaneously. Idaho\u2019s law makes it a felony to perform an abortion, punishable by up to five years in prison. Doctors can also lose their medical licenses. \u201cThe U.S. Supreme Court had the opportunity to be clear that the federal EMTALA law protects the right to abortion in an emergency in every state \u2026 and they chose not to,\u201d said Planned Parenthood Federation of America President and CEO Alexis McGill Johnson in a statement to CNN. Interpretation of \u2018unborn child\u2019 is left for another day At oral arguments on April 24, several members of the court\u2019s conservative majority expressed skepticism of the Biden administration\u2019s position, with some justices framing the case as a federal encroachment on state powers to regulate medicine. Republican-appointed justices also zeroed in on amendments Congress made to the federal law in 1989 that added language about a pregnant woman\u2019s \u201cunborn child\u201d to its protections. Idaho argued it was nonsensical that a law referencing protections for an unborn child would require hospitals to offer abortions. A dissent written by Justice Samuel Alito, joined by Justices Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch, embraced an argument put forward by Idaho and its supporters in their efforts to defend the state\u2019s strict ban on abortion. Alito said the law provided for the \u201cexpress protection of the unborn child.\u201c \u201cFar from requiring hospitals to perform abortions, EMTALA\u2019s text unambiguously demands that Medicare-funded hospitals protect the health of both a pregnant woman and her \u2018unborn child,\u2019\u201d Alito wrote. He later added that \u201cEMTALA obligates Medicare-funded hospitals to treat, not abort, an \u2018unborn child.\u2019\u201d Kagan, in parts of her concurrence that were joined by both Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Jackson, disagreed. She said three of the statute\u2019s four references to an \u201cunborn child\u201d have to do with how hospitals handle transfers of women in labor, and thus were not related to the types of emergency pregnancy complications at issue in this case. The fourth provision, Kagan wrote, \u201censures that a woman with no health risks of her own can demand emergency-room treatment if her fetus is in peril.\u201d She added, \u201cIt does not displace the hospital\u2019s duty to a woman whose life or health is in jeopardy, and who needs an abortion to stabilize her condition,\u201d Kagan said. Abortion rights advocates countered that that was not Congress\u2019 intent, and worried that the conservative Supreme Court would read fetal personhood into a federal statute for the first time ever. For now, it is unclear whether either interpretation is accepted by a majority of the high court. More major abortion case drama For the second time in two terms, the public learned of where the Supreme Court was headed in a major abortion case before the justices had formally handed down their ruling, spoiling the court\u2019s highly controlled protocols around the release of opinions. On opinion days, the Supreme Court traditionally begins at 10 a.m. ET and reads any opinions it will release in order in terms of seniority \u2014 from most-junior to most-senior. Any per curiam opinions \u2014 majority decisions that are unsigned \u2014 would be at the end. They are announced from the bench and simultaneously handed out to reporters in the press room in print and posted online. The difference Wednesday was that the opinion was mistakenly posted online and it wasn\u2019t announced from the bench and printed copies were not present. The decision came days after the Supreme Court unanimously rejected an effort by anti-abortion groups to limit access to the abortion pill mifepristone. The court ruled that the groups that challenged access to the drug did not have standing to sue, a technical decision that does not foreclose the possibility that others might.

{"id": "2024_06_26_politics_biden-trump-contrast-debate-analysis", "text": "The Almighty won\u2019t be standing on stage alongside Joe Biden on Thursday night. But Donald Trump will. Biden\u2019s team is seizing on the most critical presidential debate in years to spell out a contrast on character and policy that it believes will decide the 2024 election, if only voters will finally perceive it. It\u2019s the embodiment of one of Biden\u2019s own, rather defensive jokes \u2014 the idea that he doesn\u2019t need to be universally popular, just more acceptable than the other guy, who, happily for him, happens to be the most extreme ex-president of modern times. \u201cMy dad used to say, \u2018Joey, don\u2019t compare me to the Almighty. Compare me to the alternative,\u2019\u201d the president has said for years at rallies. The argument is a safety net for a president with the kind of low approval ratings that would normally condemn him to a single term and who has struggled to sell his achievements to voters. Biden\u2019s team is setting up Trump as an \u201cunhinged\u201d and criminal agent of vengeance unfit for a return to the presidency who will only look after himself, rich friends, and anti-abortion zealots. Biden is reflected in this conceit as a bulwark of stability and a guardian of the country\u2019s democratic values who is tirelessly striving to improve workers\u2019 lives. Biden\u2019s campaign laid the groundwork for the Atlanta showdown hosted by CNN in a weekend memo. \u201cThursday\u2019s debate will be one of the first moments in this presidential campaign where a larger slice of the American electorate will have the opportunity to witness the stark choice between Joe Biden, who is fighting for the American people and Donald Trump who is fighting for himself as a convicted felon with an unhinged campaign of regency and retribution,\u201d Biden campaign communications director Michael Tyler wrote. Campaign co-chair Mitch Landrieu highlighted the contrast on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d on Sunday. \u201cThe American people have to think about the wisdom, the character, and the judgment of the person that they\u2019re going to appoint to lead America not only at home but also to the rest of the world.\u201d And CNN\u2019s Kayla Tausche reported Tuesday that several top Democrats outside the White House want Biden to stop trying to claim credit for his achievements \u2014 including roaring jobs growth and a strong legislative record \u2014 and to go after Trump directly. \u201cHe wants the credit, but it\u2019s not working,\u201d one top Democrat, who had shared concerns with the campaign, said. How the 2024 election is different It\u2019s not unusual for an incumbent to try to savage an opponent\u2019s character and credentials to bolster a tough reelection bid. In 2004, President George W. Bush\u2019s team slandered Democrat John Kerry\u2019s Vietnam War heroism to portray him as too weak to lead the war on terror. In 2012, President Barack Obama\u2019s campaign presented Republican nominee Mitt Romney as a rich and callous corporate shark with an empty soul who relished sacking workers. Both of those attacks worked. But this is not a conventional campaign and Trump is not a conventional candidate. Democrats have been frustrated that the ex-president\u2019s return to the political spotlight and his romp to the GOP nomination have not already cemented the comparison and rendered him politically unacceptable. And the idea that voters will finally connect the dots depends on the premise that most Americans, unlike political obsessives in the campaigns and media industries, don\u2019t think about politics and presidential elections most of the time. They just need a nudge to remind them of how things used to be, the thinking goes. If Trump rants and vents his 2020 election lies on Thursday, he will play into Biden\u2019s hands. But while the television audience will be vast, the idea that there will be a moment of national realization about Trump\u2019s perceived threat seems more suited to the age of Cronkite than the age of TikTok. Biden, whom many voters believe is too old to serve a second term that would end when he is 86, is also under pressure to create a vision for the future for a weary electorate tired of high prices. He must therefore project certainty, stamina and authority on his own behalf to make the comparison work. But there is a deeper issue about the president\u2019s approach. Can it really be true that, eight years after Trump won the White House and three years after his turbulent presidency ended in violence, voters don\u2019t fully understand who Trump is? His dominance of media coverage makes it seem like he never went away. And voters would have to be hugely disengaged to not know that he\u2019s a recently convicted felon, was impeached twice, refused to accept defeat in 2020, called a crowd to Washington, DC, and told followers to \u201cfight like hell\u201d before they beat up police officers and invaded the US Capitol. Trump has lost a massive civil fraud trial, been found liable for sexual assault in a defamation case and mused during the pandemic about using disinfectant to treat Covid-19 inside the body.\u00a0He spent weeks at his recent hush money trial in New York attacking judges, witnesses, the legal system and vowing to use the presidency as a vehicle of personal and political revenge if he wins a second term. But he\u2019s still locked in a neck-and-neck race with Biden and has been leading in many of the critical swing states that pave the way to the 270 electoral votes needed to win the presidency. Biden and his fellow Democrats might see Trump as unacceptable. But he\u2019s not to millions of voters. The tied race reflects a nation split in two, politically and culturally, and is a commentary on Biden\u2019s unpopularity. And it reflects one of the most unusual aspects of this election. There are two presidents, both with a one-term record, competing for the White House. Voters don\u2019t really need to question how Trump would behave as president \u2014 they\u2019ve already seen it, even if a second term for the 45th president already looks like it would be more extreme and volatile than the first. How Trump could seek to frustrate Biden\u2019s strategy Assuming the Biden campaign sticks to this contrast strategy, Trump could thwart it by putting on a show of temperance and arriving with a list of plans to impress voters worried about their personal finances. There were isolated occasions during Trump\u2019s presidency when he met expectations of decorum. Karl Rove, the architect of Bush\u2019s 2004 reelection victory, wrote in his Wall Street Journal column last week that \u201cMr. Trump can\u2019t come off as unhinged or enraged. The words \u2018rigged election\u2019 shouldn\u2019t pass his lips. He has to keep his cool and can\u2019t make it all about himself.\u201d That\u2019s shrewd advice but Trump almost never behaves that way. Some of the former president\u2019s supporters have been transmitting advice on TV. South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, for instance, said on NBC over the weekend that the debate would be a \u201cgreat opportunity for President Trump to talk about \u2026 how his policies when he served as president of this country were good for every single family that lived here. They had more money in their pockets. The grocery prices were down. Gas prices were down.\u201d She added: \u201cI don\u2019t think that he has to get personal in this debate at all.\u201d The former president has taken part in multiple policy sessions with supporters despite his disdain for formal debate practice. But the script often gets tossed out when he goes live. The unusual circumstances of Thursday\u2019s debate could work in Trump\u2019s favor. Microphones will be muted to ensure both candidates can use their time without interruptions. That could avoid the mayhem of the first Trump v. Biden debate in 2020. The then-president\u2019s feverish demeanor was partly explained days later when he was rushed to hospital with a serious case of Covid-19. But Biden\u2019s admonition, \u201cShut up, man!\u201d gave voice to voters tired of four years of Trumpian cacophony. In another break from previous years, there will be no live audience for the debate inside a CNN studio in Atlanta. Often, Trump\u2019s most extreme rhetoric erupts when he works a crowd and doubles down on comments that get a strong reaction. Still, the encounter will mark the ex-president\u2019s reacquaintance with an opponent he blames for what he falsely claims is a campaign of persecution that threatens his fortune and his liberty. And Trump hasn\u2019t exactly been strategic ahead of the debate. His campaign has spent days trying to roll back his expectations of Biden as a doddering, elderly president who can\u2019t string two words together. Now, his team is insisting Biden will be \u201cjacked up\u201d on drugs. After months of suggesting Biden is too senile to serve, the Trump campaign\u2019s strategy now seems illogical as it paints a picture of a supreme debater who, by implication, would seem to be of presidential timber. Trump senior advisor Jason Miller, for instance, said on Tuesday, \u201cWe know that when it comes to the big events, when it comes to debates, when it comes to State of the Union, things of that nature, that they\u2019re going to have Joe Biden completely super soldiered up.\u201d Miller added: \u201cHe is going to be ready to go. He has a certain muscle memory that kicks in for having done this for 50 years.\u201d Democrats will be hoping that\u2019s true and that he can live up to the contrast with his rival staked out by Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren during a two-day swing through battleground Wisconsin. Biden, she said, is \u201ca good and decent man who will protect freedom for women across this country and who is fighting to lower costs for working families.\u201d Warren added, \u201cLet Donald Trump be Donald Trump, the guy who panders to an extremist base and who has said to his rich as hell donors that if they\u2019ll just put more money into his campaign, he\u2019ll give them giant tax cuts and cut back regulations on climate.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/26/politics/biden-trump-contrast-debate-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_24_politics_julian-assange-plea-deal-biden-administration", "text": "WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has agreed to plead guilty to a felony charge related to his alleged role in one of the largest US government breaches of classified material, as part of a deal with the Justice Department that will allow him to avoid imprisonment in the United States, according to\u00a0newly filed federal\u00a0court documents. Under the terms of the new agreement, Justice Department prosecutors will seek a 62-month sentence \u2013 which is equal to the amount of time Assange has served in a high-security prison in London while he fought extradition to the US.\u00a0The plea deal\u00a0would\u00a0credit that time served, allowing Assange to immediately return to Australia, his native country. The plea deal must still be approved by a federal judge, but as of Monday morning, Assange had been released from a UK prison, according to WikiLeaks. \u201cJulian Assange is free. He left Belmarsh maximum security prison on the morning of 24 June, after having spent 1901 days there. He was granted bail by the High Court in London and was released at Stansted airport during the afternoon, where he boarded a plane and departed the UK,\u201d WikiLeaks said a Tuesday\u00a0statement. A video uploaded by the group showed a black van traveling on a motorway followed by footage of Assange boarding a plane. A federal judge in the Northern Mariana Islands set a plea hearing and sentencing for Wednesday morning, according to the US District Court there. Justice Department prosecutors had asked the court for the proceedings to take place on the same day because Assange was resistant to setting foot in the continental US for his guilty plea, according to a letter from prosecutors. The court on the islands is near Australia, where Assange is a citizen and is expected to return to after the court hearing, prosecutors said. Prosecutors told the judge they \u201canticipate that the defendant will plead guilty to the charge \u2026 and be sentenced by the Court for that offense.\u201d Assange\u00a0was being pursued by US authorities for publishing confidential military records supplied by former Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning in 2010 and 2011. He faced 18 counts from a 2019 indictment for his alleged role in the breach that carried a max of up to 175 years in prison, though he was unlikely to be sentenced to that time in full. US officials alleged that Assange goaded Manning into obtaining thousands of pages of\u202funfiltered US diplomatic cables\u202fthat potentially endangered confidential sources, Iraq war-related significant activity reports and information related to Guantanamo Bay detainees. President Joe Biden in recent months has alluded to a possible deal pushed by Australian government officials to return Assange to Australia, though a National Security Council spokesperson told CNN Tuesday that the White House was not involved in the plea deal. \u201cThis was an independent decision made by the Department of Justice and there was no White House involvement,\u201d National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson said. FBI and Justice Department officials have opposed any deal that didn\u2019t include a felony guilty plea by Assange, people briefed on the matter told CNN. Last month, a UK court ruled that Assange had the right to appeal his final challenge against extradition to the US, dealing a win to him in his years-long fight to avoid prosecution in the States for his alleged crimes.
