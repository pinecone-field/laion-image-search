{"id": "2024_06_08_us_nitrogen-hypoxia-execution-adoption-legislation", "text": "The day after Alabama carried out the first-known US execution using nitrogen gas, its attorney general sent a clear message to death penalty states that might want to follow suit: \u201cAlabama has done it, and now so can you.\u201d Indeed, in the weeks immediately following the January execution of Kenneth Smith, it appeared a handful of states were listening, introducing bills that would adopt the method known as nitrogen hypoxia or a similar one. Officials behind each framed the legislation as an alternative method that could help resume executions where they had long been stalled. But months later \u2013 as the circumstances of Smith\u2019s death continue to fuel debate about nitrogen hypoxia \u2013 it\u2019s also increasingly unclear whether more states will, in earnest, follow Alabama in implementing the method, which involves replacing the air breathed by the condemned inmate with 100% nitrogen, depriving them of oxygen. Oklahoma and Mississippi have also legalized nitrogen hypoxia, but Alabama, which plans to execute a second inmate with nitrogen gas this fall, is the sole state to have put someone to death using it. Only one of the recently proposed state bills authorizing such a form of execution has been signed into law: Two were stuck before committees when their state legislatures adjourned this year, and a sponsor of the third acknowledged its future is uncertain. \u201cWe\u2019re not seeing a lot of states jumping on board,\u201d said Robert Dunham, director of the Death Penalty Policy Project at Phillips Black, a nonprofit law firm that specializes in post-conviction legal representation, describing the bills so far as \u201ca reflexive reaction by some legislators in some states who are desperate to find alternatives to lethal injection.\u201d \u201cI think that in states in which there is not a reflexive reaction and legislators actually take time to consider what it means to suffocate a prisoner to death with nitrogen gas or other gas, you are unlikely to see gas adopted as an alternative.\u201d Meantime, several manufacturers of nitrogen gas have said they oppose their products being used for executions, echoing the kind of bans many pharmaceutical companies have instituted for their drugs in lethal injections \u2013 thus prompting states to seek an alternative. To head off this complication, the bills proposing nitrogen hypoxia and the like also aim to implement or expand protections shielding those involved with executions from being publicly identified. Taken together, the middling legislative efforts, vocal resistance of some gas producers and declining public support for capital punishment signal nitrogen executions may not be widely embraced among US death penalty states \u2013 at least for now. \u201cThere are very few states that are actually still interested in executing prisoners,\u201d Dunham said. \u201cOne execution is not enough experience to predict what is going to happen among the handful of states that want to get back in the business of killing prisoners. But beyond the initial reflexive introduction of bills in a small number of states, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s going to be a larger first wave of attempts to expand execution methods across the country.\u201d One bill passes \u2026 While some US states decades ago used lethal gas to execute prisoners, the use of nitrogen hypoxia is new. And within weeks of Smith\u2019s execution, legislators in Louisiana, Ohio and Kansas put forward bills to adopt nitrogen hypoxia, while a fourth bill in Nebraska that predated Smith\u2019s execution got renewed attention. It was a small group, given capital punishment remains legal in 27 states and in federal court. \u201cOften what states do is they imitate,\u201d said Austin Sarat, a professor of political science and law at Amherst College who has written extensively and critically about the death penalty. He cast nitrogen hypoxia as just the latest method for states to seize upon in their search since the late 19th century for \u201ca method of execution that would be safe, reliable and humane.\u201d Only Louisiana\u2019s bill, though, has received the governor\u2019s signature, making it the fourth state to adopt nitrogen hypoxia. HB 6 passed during a special session called by Republican Gov. Jeff Landry in February to address a wish list of criminal justice items. Its author, GOP state Rep. Nicholas Muscarello, told CNN he expected his legislation \u2013 which also re-authorized the use of electrocution \u2013 to facilitate the return of executions in the state, which hasn\u2019t put someone to death since 2010. Still, Muscarello anticipated most executions would be carried out using lethal injection, he said. When the regular session convened, however, it was clear the act would not go into effect without a fight. Another bill, SB 430, was introduced by Democratic state Sen. Katrina Jackson-Andrews, seeking to undo HB 6\u2019s nitrogen gas provision while preserving its other pieces. Jackson-Andrews, who did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for an interview, had the vocal backing of a coalition called Jews Against Gassing, which opposes gas executions because they echo the Holocaust, when 6 million Jews were murdered by Nazi Germany before and during World War II. \u201cWhen this came up, it evoked trauma for me,\u201d Jacquelyn Stern, 70, a member of the coalition, said of HB 6. She described knowing survivors of the Holocaust and going to school with their children, all of whom were deeply traumatized. \u201cIt flies in the face of what a civilized community ought to be, to want to gas people when this is what Nazi Germany did,\u201d she said. \u201cHere we are, in Louisiana, just turning a blind eye to that.\u201d SB 430 passed the Louisiana state Senate with bipartisan support. But when it went before the state House Committee on the Administration of Criminal Justice on May 21, the committee rejected it, killing the bill and leaving Stern feeling disappointed, helpless and unrepresented. \u2026 while the other bills languish Ohio\u2019s bill appears to be the only other legislation in this vein that could be adopted. Republican state Reps. Phil Plummer and Brian Stewart proposed HB 392 with the support of the state\u2019s GOP attorney general, who said nitrogen hypoxia could bring \u201cclosure\u201d to victims after years of the state struggling to obtain the drugs necessary for lethal injections, leading to an effective moratorium on Ohio\u2019s death penalty. Plummer echoed that, seeing the bill as a way for the state to again put violent killers to death, he told CNN. \u201cWe decided to follow step with Alabama with the nitrogen hypoxia as just another method,\u201d he said. \u201cThe important thing here is we\u2019re not changing the death penalty. It\u2019s already in statutes. But we\u2019re just giving government another option.\u201d The bill remains before the state House Government Oversight Committee, which Plummer said would hold three hearings before it\u2019s approved: One for the bill\u2019s sponsors and another for its proponents are complete; the third, for those opposed, has yet to be scheduled. At the first hearing, Plummer and Stewart were questioned by committee members, including Democrats who invoked Alabama\u2019s execution of Smith, echoing debate there over whether that execution was humane. Ahead of Smith\u2019s execution, critics had raised alarms, fearing elements contained in Alabama\u2019s protocol \u2013\u00a0which has only been made public in heavily redacted form\u00a0\u2013 would lead to undue suffering for the inmate. The state argued against these claims, saying in court records nitrogen hypoxia was perhaps the most humane execution method ever. After he was dead, both sides pointed to Smith\u2019s execution as evidence their claim had been borne out. GOP Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall called it \u201ctextbook,\u201d while critics pointed to witness accounts that Smith shook and writhed on the gurney for minutes before his death and did not slip into unconsciousness within seconds as the state, citing its own expert, claimed he would. Plummer dismissed the criticism, telling CNN, \u201cThe critics always complain things like that are inhumane. That\u2019s their talking point.\u201d \u201cWe don\u2019t want people to suffer. But at the end of the day, it\u2019s the law, and it\u2019s our job to enact the law,\u201d he said, adding he was open to hearing about alternatives. It\u2019s unclear whether Ohio\u2019s HB 392 will pass. Plummer attributed the uncertainty to division within the state\u2019s Republican caucus after a taxing House speaker\u2019s race. Meantime, legislatures in Kansas and Nebraska both adjourned without passing their respective bills, and each would need to be reintroduced to be considered again. Nebraska\u2019s LB 970 is listed as \u201cindefinitely postponed.\u201d Its sponsor, Republican state Sen. Loren Lippincott, declined an interview but in an email said he had yet to decide whether to reintroduce the legislation next year. Separately, Kansas\u2019 HB 2782 \u2013 which would add \u201chypoxia\u201d as an execution method but does not specify the use of nitrogen gas \u2013 got a hearing before the state House Committee on Judiciary but appeared to progress no further. GOP Kansas Attorney General Kris Kobach, whose office requested introduction of the bill, will seek to have a similar one introduced during next year\u2019s legislative session, a spokesperson told CNN. Some gas producers are opposed \u2026 Beyond sputtering legislation, states hoping to implement nitrogen executions could face another hurdle: lacking the elements to carry them out. Among its proponents, a stated benefit of nitrogen hypoxia has been the readily available nature of nitrogen gas, which makes up about 78% of Earth\u2019s atmosphere and is used widely across various industries for an untold number of applications. But several companies certified by the US Food and Drug Administration to produce nitrogen gas for human use have confirmed to CNN they oppose or would not allow their products to be used for the purposes of carrying out executions, as first reported by The Guardian. For example, AirGas \u2013 owned by Air Liquide, a French company \u2013 \u201chas not and will not supply nitrogen or other inert gases to induce hypoxia for the purpose of human execution,\u201d it told CNN in a statement. \u201cSince 2019, Airgas has publicly articulated its position that supplying nitrogen for the purpose of human execution is not consistent with our company values,\u201d the statement said, \u201cand that position has not changed.\u201d Similarly, Linde, a European company, \u201chas a long-standing policy prohibiting the sale of our gases for use as an asphyxiant applied to humans,\u201d it said in a statement to CNN. \u201cWe do not knowingly sell to third parties nor offer bids on contracts seeking to secure gases for this purpose.\u201d And Air Products, another company, told CNN it had \u201cestablished prohibited end uses for our products, which includes the use of any of our industrial gas products for the intentional killing of any person (including nitrogen hypoxia).\u201d While not an exhaustive survey of nitrogen producers, opposition by these companies echoes that of pharmaceutical drugmakers who prohibited their products from being used in lethal injections. Sarat linked companies\u2019 objection \u2013 whether they produce nitrogen or drugs \u2013 to the current \u201cperiod of national reconsideration of capital punishment,\u201d including not just declines in the numbers of executions and death sentences but also in public support for the death penalty. A Gallup Poll published last November found only 47% of Americans believe the death penalty is fairly applied, while 53% support the death penalty for a convicted murderer overall \u2013 far below the 80% peak seen in 1994. \u201cAs doubts emerge about capital punishment, as people begin to think maybe this isn\u2019t such a great idea, companies who are in the business of manufacturing pharmaceuticals, or companies that produce nitrogen, won\u2019t want their products associated with the American death penalty,\u201d said Sarat. \u201cWould it surprise me that there might be supply problems? No, it wouldn\u2019t surprise me.\u201d \u2026 as states seek to expand secrecy rules For their part, the states mulling nitrogen hypoxia appear to have anticipated this, building into their proposed bills language preventing suppliers from being publicly identified. Louisiana\u2019s HB 6 specifically added a provision that would \u201censure the absolute confidentiality of the identifying information of any person, business, organization, or other entity directly or indirectly involved in the execution of a death sentence\u201d in the state. \u201cThis confidentiality provision shall prevail over any conflicting provision in state law related to public disclosure.\u201d Information about purchases for executions would be disclosed to the state inspector general, who would examine that information and certify the purchases, the bill notes. Similarly, Ohio\u2019s HB 392 expands already-existing protections, extending the prohibition of the release of \u201cexecution identifying information\u201d to anyone who manufactures, distributes, prepares or administers a drug or gas for an execution. That provision, Plummer told CNN, was intended to prevent Ohio from having the same acquisition troubles with nitrogen as it does with lethal injection drugs, preventing suppliers from falling victim to public backlash. \u201cWe\u2019re just trying to give a layer of protection to the makers of the substance we need,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause cancel culture\u2019s alive and well.\u201d CNN\u2019s Eva Roytburg contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/08/us/nitrogen-hypoxia-execution-adoption-legislation/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_05_30_us_kohberger-idaho-killings-pretrial-hearings", "text": "After yet another pre-trial hearing in Bryan Kohberger\u2019s quadruple murder trial in early May, the family of one of the victims openly criticized the slow pace of the proceedings. \u201cThis case is turning into a hamster wheel of motions, hearings, and delayed decisions,\u201d the \u201cincredibly frustrated\u201d family of slain University of Idaho student Kaylee Goncalves said in a statement. The criticism stemmed from the long and winding road ever since four University of Idaho students \u2013 Goncalves, Ethan Chapin, Xana Kernodle and Madison Mogen \u2013 were fatally stabbed in the overnight hours of November 13, 2022, at a home just off the school\u2019s main campus in Moscow. Kohberger, a Washington State University graduate student in criminology, was arrested in the killings on December 30, 2022, in his home state of Pennsylvania. A\u00a0not guilty plea was entered on his behalf one year ago this month, and his\u00a0attorneys have indicated the 29-year-old intends to present an alibi as part of his defense. Prosecutors have said they will seek the death penalty. The progression of the case has been slowed by a series of pre-trial motions and hearings, and a trial date still has not been set. Latah County Judge John Judge said in April he wants a \u201chearing at least every month,\u201d noting the importance of \u201ccleaning up\u201d the legal proceedings. The hearings largely fall into a few different buckets. One relates to the defense attorneys\u2019 access to evidence, particularly how the prosecution used investigative genetic genealogy in building the case. A second set of hearings concerns Kohberger\u2019s proposed alibi for his innocence. Third, there have be a number of hearings related to a gag order that restricts what the parties can publicly say about the case. Here\u2019s a timeline of some of the notable pre-trial hearings and decisions so far: June 9, 2023: A coalition of media organizations and the family of a murder victim came to court to challenge the gag order placed on the parties in the case. June 23, 2023: The judge denied both requests but issued a revised gag order that allows the parties to discuss topics that do not have a \u201csubstantial likelihood of materially prejudicing or otherwise influencing the outcome of the case.\u201d August 2, 2023: Kohberger\u2019s attorneys said they would\u00a0use an alibi defense but couldn\u2019t pin down their client\u2019s specific location on the night of the killings because he was \u201cdriving during the late night and early morning hours.\u201d \u201cMr.\u00a0Kohberger\u00a0is not claiming to be at a specific location at a specific time; at this time there is not a specific witness to say precisely where Mr.\u00a0Kohberger\u00a0was at each moment of the hours\u201d of the attacks, his attorneys said in a court filing. October 26, 2023: The judge denied a\u00a0request to dismiss the grand jury indictment after the defense argued there was an error in the grand jury instructions. December 18, 2023: The judge denied a second motion to dismiss the indictment after the defense argued prosecutors failed to comply fully with state rules on jury selection and the jury questionnaire. February 28, 2024: Defense attorney Anne C. Taylor asked the court to allow three defense experts and others to view the investigative genetic genealogy evidence, which has been sealed, to understand the full timeline of how police began to focus on Kohberger. Genetic genealogy is a practice that blends DNA analysis in the lab with genealogical research, such as tracing a person\u2019s family tree. In this case, investigators found a single source of male DNA on the button snap of a leather knife sheath left at the crime scene,\u00a0according to a probable cause affidavit. FBI investigators loaded the DNA profile to public genealogy sites to search for a match and then sent a tip to investigate Kohberger, according to a prosecution court filing. The judge initially declined to give the defense investigators extended access to the investigative genetic genealogy, saying he would rather the experts already approved to view the material give justification for digging deeper. But in a new order filed June 7, the judge agreed, without explanation. The defense investigators now allowed to view the evidence were not named. April 4, 2024: The judge criticized Kohberger\u2019s defense attorney, saying she commissioned phone surveys to potential jurors that could hinder Kohberger\u2019s ability to get a fair trial. However, Taylor said the judge violated her client\u2019s right to due process by ordering a stop to the anonymous survey without hearing the defense\u2019s side first. April 17, 2024: Kohberger\u2019s defense lawyers filed a court document saying they plan\u00a0to offer a cell phone tower and radio frequency expert to partially corroborate\u00a0his proposed alibi that he was out driving west of Moscow\u00a0on the night of the slayings. April 19, 2024: The judge allowed surveys conducted with potential jurors to continue \u201cwithout modification\u201d after temporarily pausing them. April 29, 2024: The prosecution asked the court to deny Kohberger the opportunity to add to his alibi and to preclude anyone other than the defendant to testify as to his whereabouts on the night of the murders. May 2, 2024: Kohberger\u2019s defense had asked for an upcoming evidentiary hearing with witnesses be made public, while the prosecution asked that it be sealed. The judge ruled that it will be closed to the public. May 23, 2024: Taylor, the defense attorney, questioned a Moscow police detective about the preparation of visual cell phone logs and methods for searching for certain videos. The testimony was related to two motions to compel prosecutors to share discovery with the defense, but the contents of the motions are sealed, so it was not clear what they were requesting. May 30, 2024: The Moscow police detective leading the investigation and a defense expert in cell phone location data testified that the defense has not received some key evidence in the case. Cpl. Brett Payne, the lead investigator on the case, testified he and other investigators collected thousands of hours of video surveillance as they tried to locate a white Hyundai Elantra connected to the suspect. The videos are saved on various thumb drives, but there is no central inventory of the videos, he testified. He also said investigators did not see on any of the videos the Elantra going south from Moscow toward Pullman, Washington, in the early morning hours after the killings. The probable cause affidavit used in the case alleges Kohberger drove south toward Pullman after he committed the four killings. Sy Ray, an expert on cell phone geolocation data, testified that he has not been provided the underlying AT&T source data and list of nearby cell towers that was used by detectives to create a map of Kohberger\u2019s movements with his cell phone. Based on the data he had received, he believed some statements in the records were not accurate, and he said the missing data could be helpful to the defense. \u201cBecause of the piecemealing of the data, because of the missing data, because of data that I\u2019m reviewing that is incredibly inaccurate, everything that is missing is absolutely to the benefit of the defense right now,\u201d he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/30/us/kohberger-idaho-killings-pretrial-hearings/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_10_us_us-violent-crime-rates-statistics", "text": "Violent\u00a0crime\u00a0dropped by more than 15% in the United States during the first three months of 2024, according to statistics released Monday by the FBI. The new numbers show violent\u00a0crime\u00a0from January to March dropped 15.2% compared to the same period in 2023, while murders fell 26.4% and rapes decreased by 25.7%. Aggravated assaults decreased during that period when compared to last year by 12.5%, according to the data, while robberies fell 17.8%. The numbers released Monday were gathered from 13,719 of the just over 19,000 law enforcement agencies from across the country, according to the bureau. Meanwhile, property\u00a0crime\u00a0went down 15.1% in the first three months of this year. Burglaries dropped 16.7%, while motor vehicle theft decreased by 17.3%. The declines in violent and property\u00a0crimes were seen in every region of the US. In a statement Monday, Attorney General Merrick Garland stressed the new data \u201cmakes clear that last year\u2019s historic decline in violent\u00a0crime\u00a0is continuing.\u201d \u201cThis continued historic decline in homicides does not represent abstract statistics. It represents people whose lives were saved \u2014 people who are still here to see their children grow up, to work toward fulfilling their dreams, and to contribute to their communities,\u201d Garland said. US murder rate plunges The new FBI figures validate a trend identified by some national\u00a0crime\u00a0experts: The US murder rate continues to drop at a high rate and could be headed for its largest annual decline ever. Compared to the first five months of 2023, murders this year have dropped more than 40% in cities including New Orleans, Seattle, Boston, Baltimore, and Philadelphia, according to the research firm AH Datalytics, which analyzes\u00a0crime\u00a0figures reported by law enforcement agencies across the nation. Although more than six months still remain in 2024, \u201cit\u2019s plausible that this will be, by far, the largest one-year decline in American history,\u201d said Jeff Asher, criminal justice analyst and co-founder of consulting firm AH Datalytics. The firm\u2019s real-time review of 265 cities currently shows a 19% drop in murders nationwide compared to 2023. Data limitations The preliminary figures in the FBI\u2019s Quarterly Uniform\u00a0Crime\u00a0Report do come with important limitations. For one, the bureau relies upon data voluntarily submitted by policing agencies. Crime\u00a0analysts also say quarterly data are imprecise, as law enforcement agencies have the remainder of the year to audit and correct any reporting errors before final annual figures are published by the FBI. \u201cWe have other data sources that point to the same trends, but the degree of those declines is probably being overstated due to the methodology being employed by the FBI,\u201d said Asher. \u2018Interrupting cycles of violence\u2019 The US murder rate has declined since 2020, when the Covid-19 pandemic brought with it a surge in homicides across the country. FBI figures showed the number of homicides increased nearly 30% from 2019 to 2020 \u2013 the largest single-year increase the agency had recorded since it began tracking these\u00a0crimes in the 1960s \u2013 and violent\u00a0crime\u00a0during the same period increased by 5%. Criminal justice experts say\u00a0crime\u00a0trends are complex, but generally blame the cause in the 2020 surge on vast societal disruptions, including the closure of schools, businesses, childcare and community programs. Others pointed to more stress and more guns along with less policing, less public trust and disruption of social support services. \u201cThese are some of the tools that we would expect to have an effect on reversing or interrupting cycles of violence,\u201d said Asher. \u201cIn a normal year these tools would have been available to us in 2020 or 2021, but they weren\u2019t. It\u2019s only now, several years later, that we\u2019re starting to see the level of gun violence, the level of murder fall back to where it was pre-pandemic.\u201d CNN\u2019s Eric Levenson and Mark Morales contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/10/us/us-violent-crime-rates-statistics/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_08_us_east-brunswick-high-school-yearbook-reaj", "text": "An investigation is underway after seniors at East Brunswick High School in New Jersey received yearbooks this week with a Jewish Student Union photo replaced by a photo of Muslim students, the superintendent said. \u201cWe were made aware that in yearbooks, distributed only to Seniors, the Jewish Student Union is accompanied by a photograph that is not associated with them in any way,\u201d East Brunswick Public Schools Superintendent Victor Valeski posted on Facebook Wednesday. \u201cAdditionally, names of members of the Jewish Student Union were not published.\u201d The school board has retained private legal counsel to investigate after the superintendent\u2019s own probe into the yearbook incident, Valeski told CNN on Friday. \u201cI did an initial internal investigation,\u201d\u00a0Valeski wrote in an email to CNN. \u201cI found, at a minimum, gross (negligence) in the proof review procedure before going to print.\u201d It\u2019s not clear who might have removed the photo and names of the Jewish Student Union members and replaced them with a photo showing members of the school\u2019s Muslim Student Association. East Brunswick Mayor Brad Cohen called the incident a \u201cblatant Anti-Semitic act.\u201d \u201cThe action resulted in a picture of Muslim students replacing the original photograph of the Jewish students,\u201d the mayor posted on Facebook. He called on school officials to answer a litany of questions, including how the incident happened, who was responsible and how perpetrators would be held accountable. On Thursday night, the school board announced an independent group will investigate. The private counsel started working on the case Friday, and it\u2019s unclear when findings will be completed. Student gets threats \u2018calling me a terrorist\u2019 The superintendent apologized on behalf of the East Brunswick Board of Education \u201cfor the hurt, pain and anguish this event has caused our Jewish students, their families and the impact this continues to have on the entire EB community.\u201d \u201cWe do not tolerate bias and we investigate all reported antisemitism,\u201d Valeski posted on Facebook. The Jewish Federation in the Heart of New Jersey demanded facts and accountability after it learned of \u201calterations of photos and names of Jewish students that, while under investigation, appear on their surface may be deliberate and malicious - and if not, then certainly negligent.\u201d Charlotte Friedman, president of the school\u2019s\u00a0Jewish Club, said \u201cit feels as if our identity as Jewish students has been symbolically erased.\u201d \u201cOver the past 48 hours, I have lost sleep and hours studying for my final exams,\u201d Friedman said at a school board meeting Thursday night. \u201cI am worried that there are classmates at EBHS who hate or mock Jewish club members just because we are Jewish.\u201d But it\u2019s not just Jewish students suffering from the yearbook incident. \u201cI\u2019ve personally seen death threats on social media, calling me a terrorist,\u201d a Muslim student identified as Zain told CNN affiliate\u00a0News 12 New Jersey. The Muslim Student Association \u201chad no involvement in this, yet we have become the face of the whole incident because our faces weren\u2019t even blurred out before the photo was posted on social media,\u201d MSA Vice President\u00a0Ali Salama said in a statement provided by the Council on American\u2013Islamic Relations\u2019 New Jersey office. Zain expressed sympathy for the Jewish community and described the Islamophobia he\u2019s endured since seeing his face in the misplaced photo. \u201cI want to offer my condolences to the Jewish community for the pain that they have suffered for the yearbook situation, and I hope that they are able to get their picture back into the yearbook after this is resolved,\u201d Zain said at Thursday\u2019s school board meeting. \u201cI was one of the students in the mislabeled yearbook photo, and I want to speak on behalf of myself and the MSA for the abhorrent Islamophobia that we endured during this event.\u201d He cited posts on social media that \u201ccompared me to a member of the KKK in Klan attire\u201d and called \u201cfor my deportation.\u201d Another student at the meeting said MSA members \u201chave been unjustly blamed\u201d and subjected to online abuse. The high school junior questioned the differing responses to the Jewish community and the Muslim community. \u201cOver the past few days, all we have heard about is how hurt the Jewish community is and how everyone is rallying to support them. While we deeply empathize with their pain, it raises a critical question: When will it be our turn?\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cWe need assurance that our voices are heard, our concerns are addressed and that we, too, are given the support and protection we so desperately need.\u201d In a later Facebook post, the superintendent acknowledged Muslim students had also felt backlash. \u201cAs I mentioned impacts to our Jewish students and families earlier today, I want to offer sincere apologies to our Muslim students and families, as well,\u201d Valeski wrote Wednesday. \u201cI am aware that the picture placed in the yearbook has caused pain for our Muslim students and for that I am deeply sorry.\u201d What happens next While the investigation continues, seniors who received yearbooks have been asked to return them so that the errant page can be replaced.

{"id": "2024_06_10_politics_judge-cannon-trump-classified-documents-charges", "text": "The federal judge overseeing the federal criminal classified documents case against Donald Trump and his two co-defendants in Florida has denied efforts to dismiss nearly 10 of the 41 charges in the indictment against them on several technical issues. District Judge Aileen Cannon did, however, agree with the defendants that some of the language in the indictment was \u201clegally unnecessary\u201d and ruled that one of the paragraphs would be removed from the indictment. In the small win for the defense, Cannon rejected prosecutors\u2019 rationale for including a paragraph in the charges that laid out an episode in which Trump allegedly showed an unnamed representative of his political organization a classified map and commented that he should not be showing the map to the individual. Prosecutors had pointed to a procedural rule that allows the admission of evidence that relates to uncharged conduct. However, Cannon said Monday that such evidence should be subjected to certain pretrial litigation before it is allowed to come into a case. In explaining that narrow ruling, she took swipes at the prosecutors for their use of a so-called speaking indictment, meaning an indictment that goes beyond the sparse legal requirements for charging someone and gives a fuller narrative of the allegations. Cannon noted in her order that \u201cthe risks that can flow from a prosecutor\u2019s decision to include in a charging document an extensive narrative account of his or her view of the facts, especially in cases of significant public interest.\u201d While Trump and his co-defendants raised several other technical issues they saw with charges in the indictment, including duplicity issues, the judge ultimately found those \u201cidentified deficiencies, even if generating some arguable confusion, are either permitted by law, raise evidentiary challenges not appropriate for disposition at this juncture.\u201d Cannon also said that as long as the jury was \u201cinstructed appropriately and presented with adequate verdict forms as to each Defendants\u2019 alleged conduct\u201d there wasn\u2019t an issue.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/10/politics/judge-cannon-trump-classified-documents-charges/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "us"}}

The league also said Monday it had its most-watched start of the season games ever across all six networks that broadcast matches \u2014 ABC, ESPN, ESPN2, CBS, ION and NBA TV. Women\u2019s basketball is experiencing a boom thanks to the phenomenon around WNBA rookie Clark.  The NCAA women\u2019s basketball National Championship matchup between Clark\u2019s alma mater the Iowa Hawkeyes and the South Carolina Gamecocks earlier this year drew 18.9 million viewers, smashing television ratings records. Since then, her entry to the WNBA, along with other players like Reese, has kicked off a new era in the league. Clark\u2019s professional debut in May drew the largest WNBA audience in two decades. People of color and young people are turning to the WNBA with interest. Viewership grew 60% year-over-year among people of color, the WNBA said, with huge jumps in Hispanic and Black audiences, who represent most of the group. The league\u2019s Tip-Off week had a 139% increase in young girls watching. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening now in women\u2019s basketball is confirmation of what we\u2019ve always known: The demand is there, and women\u2019s sports is a valuable investment,\u201d said Chief Growth Officer Colie Edison in a press release.

(In contrast, last year averaged 462,000 viewers per game.) And though the season has recently begun, the WNBA said it has had about 400,000 fans who have attended games in its arenas so far, the most first-month attendance in more than two decades.

{"id": "2024_06_09_us_madison-wisconsin-shooting-multiple-injuries", "text": "At least 12 people were injured when gunfire broke out on the rooftop of an apartment building in Madison, Wisconsin \u2013 one of three separate shootings that left one person dead and more than a dozen injured in the city over the weekend. A dozen victims \u2013 some as young as 14 years old \u2013 have now reported injuries after the rooftop shooting early Sunday morning, and two are still hospitalized, Madison Police Chief Shon Barnes said in a news conference Monday. \u201cWe had a very violent weekend in Madison,\u201d Barnes told reporters. A 27-year-old man was killed in a separate shooting in the city Friday, police said. And Sunday night, a drive-by shooting left two injured, with one person still hospitalized in critical condition, Barnes told reporters Monday. Police don\u2019t currently believe the shootings were connected, Barnes added, \u201cWe\u2019re looking at that as an angle, however we have no information to suggest that at this time.\u201d \u201cGuns are not a solution to conflict, and we must stop normalizing their use and their accessibility,\u201d Mayor Satya Rhodes-Conway said at the news conference Monday. \u201cThe families impacted by these events will never be the same.\u201d Friday\u2019s shooting ended a five-week streak of no reports of shots fired in Madison, officials said. Rhodes-Conway called on state lawmakers to enact gun safety measures. Police have yet to identify a suspect or make arrests in the rooftop shooting and are asking the public for information or videos of the event. \u201cAt this time, we will not be publicly identifying the suspect or a person of interest, as we do not want to jeopardize any leads in this case,\u201d Barnes said. In the rooftop shooting, 10 people suffered gunshot wounds or grazes, one person was hurt by broken glass and another sustained a shoulder injury, according to police. Emergency personnel responded around 1 a.m. Sunday to what police now believe was a \u201csneak bash,\u201d or an unauthorized party in a private setting, Barnes said Monday. Police found one teen who suffered multiple gunshot wounds bleeding in the street, and rushed into the apartment building on Johnson Street, Barnes said. \u201cOfficers watched as dozens of people rushed out of the building, running in panic and tripping over one another, simply trying to find safety,\u201d he said. After running up 12 flights of stairs to reach those at the party, police said they found a chaotic scene. Police believe there were at least 25 people on the rooftop, Barnes said Monday. Authorities initially estimated there were several hundred people on the scene. Victims range in age from 14 to 23, with some victims still in high school, authorities said. Police are looking at \u201cdigital evidence\u201d and are still working to determine who organized the party, Barnes said. The Madison Fire Department took five people with gunshot wounds to the hospital by ambulance, while other victims reported to the hospital on their own. Four ambulances and two engine companies helped triage, treat and transport patients at the scene, the department said in a statement. Earlier this year, the Madison police and fire departments teamed up to train for how to respond to a situation like this one, Barnes previously said, \u201chowever, we didn\u2019t expect to put it into practice so soon.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/09/us/madison-wisconsin-shooting-multiple-injuries/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_07_us_southern-baptists-women-pastors", "text": "From its towering white steeple and red-brick facade to its Sunday services filled with rousing gospel hymns and evangelistic sermons, First Baptist Church of Alexandria, Virginia, bears many of the classic hallmarks of a\u00a0Southern Baptist church. On a recent Sunday, its pastor for women and children, Kim Eskridge, urged members to invite friends and neighbors to an upcoming vacation Bible school \u2014 a perennial Baptist activity \u2014 to help \u201creach families in the community with the gospel.\u201d But because that\u00a0pastor is a woman, First Baptist\u2019s days in the Southern Baptist Convention may be numbered. At the SBC\u2019s annual meeting June 11-12 in Indianapolis, representatives will vote on whether to amend the denomination\u2019s constitution to essentially ban churches with any women pastors \u2014 and not just in the top job. That measure received overwhelming approval in a preliminary vote last year. Leaders of First Baptist \u2013 which has given millions of dollars to Southern Baptist causes and has been involved with the convention since its 19th century founding \u2014 are bracing for a possible expulsion. \u201cWe are grieved at the direction the SBC has taken,\u201d the church said in a statement. And it\u2019s not alone. By some estimates, the proposed ban could affect hundreds of congregations and have a disproportionate impact on predominantly Black churches. The vote is partly the culmination of events set in motion two years ago. That\u2019s when a Virginia pastor contacted SBC officials to contend that First Baptist and four nearby churches were \u201cout of step\u201d with denominational doctrine that says only men can be pastors. The SBC Credentials Committee launched a formal inquiry in April. Southern Baptists disagree on which ministry jobs this doctrine refers to. Some say it\u2019s just the senior pastor, others that a pastor is anyone who preaches and exercises spiritual authority. And in a Baptist tradition that prizes local church autonomy, critics say the convention shouldn\u2019t enshrine a constitutional rule based on one interpretation of its non-binding doctrinal statement. By some estimates, women are working in pastoral roles in hundreds of SBC-linked churches, a fraction of the nearly 47,000 across the denomination. But critics say the amendment would amount to a further narrowing in numbers and mindset for the nation\u2019s largest Protestant denomination, which has moved steadily rightward in recent decades. They also wonder if the SBC has better things to do. It has struggled to respond to sexual abuse cases in its churches. A former professor at a Southern Baptist seminary in Texas was indicted in May on a charge of falsifying a record about alleged sexual abuse by a student in order to obstruct a\u00a0federal investigation\u00a0into sexual misconduct in the convention. SBC membership has dipped below 13 million, nearly a half-century low. Baptismal rates are in long-term decline. The amendment, if passed, wouldn\u2019t prompt an immediate purge. But it could keep the denomination\u2019s leaders busy for years, investigating and ousting churches. Many predominantly Black churches have men as lead pastors but assign pastor titles to women in other areas, such as worship and children\u2019s ministries. \u201cTo disfellowship like-minded churches \u2026 based on a local-church governance decision dishonors the spirit of cooperation and the guiding tenets of our denomination,\u201d wrote Pastor Gregory Perkins, president of the SBC\u2019s National African American Fellowship, to denominational officials. The controversy complicates the\u00a0already-choppy efforts\u00a0by the mostly white denomination to diversify and overcome its legacy of slavery and segregation. Amendment proponents say the convention needs to reinforce its doctrinal statement, the Baptist Faith and Message, which says the office of pastor is \u201climited to men as qualified by Scripture.\u201d \u201cIf we won\u2019t stand on this issue and be unapologetically biblical, then we won\u2019t stand on anything,\u201d said amendment proponent Mike Law, pastor of Arlington Baptist Church in Virginia. Since Baptist churches are independent, the convention can\u2019t tell them what to do or whom to appoint as a pastor. But the convention can decide which churches are in and which are out. And even without a formal amendment, its Executive Committee has begun telling churches with women pastors that\u00a0they\u2019re out. That included one of its largest, Saddleback Church of California. When Saddleback and a\u00a0small Kentucky church\u00a0appealed to the\u00a0annual meeting in 2023,\u00a0delegates overwhelmingly refused to take them back. The amendment would give such enforcement actions more teeth. Some churches with women pastors quit on their own in the past year. They range from Elevation Church, a North Carolina megachurch, to First Baptist of Richmond, Virginia, which had close SBC ties from the convention\u2019s founding. Law contended the issue has been a \u201ccanary in the coalmine\u201d for liberal denominations, several of which began ordaining women and later LGBTQ+ people. \u201cSouthern Baptists are facing a decisive moment,\u201d he said in a video on a pro-amendment website. \u201cHere\u2019s the trajectory of doing nothing: Soon Southern Baptist churches will start openly supporting homosexual clergy, same-sex marriage and eventually transgenderism.\u201d Others point out that Pentecostal and other denominations have had women pastors for generations and remain theologically conservative. Some SBC churches with women pastors are heavily involved with the convention, while others have minimal connections and identify more closely with historically Black or other progressive denominations. Also, some SBC churches interpret the 2000 faith statement as only applying to senior pastors. As long as a the church leader is male, women can serve other pastoral roles, they say. Such churches may leave if SBC leaders interfere with congregations following \u201ctheir conscience, biblical convictions, and values by recognizing women can receive a pastoral gift from God in partnership with male leadership,\u201d said Dwight McKissic, a pastor from Arlington, Texas, on the social media platform X. Other churches say women can be in any role, including senior pastor, and churches can agree to disagree if they embrace most of the SBC faith statement. That category includes First Baptist of Alexandria. Though its current senior pastor is male, it recognizes \u201cGod\u2019s calling to ordain any qualified individual, male or female, for pastoral ministry,\u201d the church said in a statement. First Baptist leaders declined interview requests, but it has posted extensively about the issue on its website. It said while it plans to send representatives to the SBC annual meeting, it was warned to expect a motion to deny them voting privileges. \u201cI do believe we need to be heard and represented,\u201d Senior Pastor Robert Stephens told members in a video-recorded meeting. The SBC\u2019s top administrative body opposes the amendment. Investigating churches\u2019 compliance would consume an unsustainable amount of time and energy over something that shouldn\u2019t be a litmus test for fellowship, wrote Jeff Iorg, president of the SBC Executive Committee, in a Baptist Press commentary. Baptist Women in Ministry, which began within the SBC in the 1980s but now works in multiple Baptist denominations, has taken note. The Rev. Meredith Stone, its executive director, said some women pastors within the SBC have reached out for support. The group plans to release a documentary, \u201cMidwives of a Movement,\u201d about 20th century trailblazers for women in Baptist ministry, on the eve of the SBC meeting. \u201cAs they are saying women have less value to God than men in the church, we want to make sure that women know they do have equal value and that there are no limits to how they follow Christ in the work of the church,\u201d Stone said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/07/us/southern-baptists-women-pastors/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_10_politics_takeaways-day-6-hunter-biden-trial", "text": "The jury in Hunter Biden\u2019s federal gun trial began deliberations on Monday after the defendant declined to testify in his own defense and both sides presented closing arguments in the historic case against the president\u2019s son. Special counsel David Weiss\u2019 prosecutors urged the jury to bring back three guilty verdicts because, even though the evidence was \u201cpersonal\u201d and \u201cugly,\u201d it was also \u201coverwhelming\u201d that Biden bought and possessed a firearm while abusing drugs. Later, Biden\u2019s defense attorney argued that the prosecutors\u2019 case was similar to a \u201cmagician\u2019s trick,\u201d and accused Weiss\u2019 team of trying to inflate the evidence and win convictions based on \u201csuspicion and conjecture\u201d alone. If convicted, Biden could face up to 25 years in prison and a fine of up to $750,000, though first-time offenders like him rarely receive the maximum penalty. He pleaded not guilty to all three charges. Here are takeaways from Day 6 of the historic trial. \u2018No one is above the law,\u2019 prosecutors say In the first seconds of Leo Wise\u2019s closing arguments, he referenced the VIPs from the Biden family that have been filling the front row of the courtroom pews each day, often including\u00a0first lady Jill Biden, who was in attendance on Monday. \u201cThe people sitting in the gallery are not evidence,\u201d Wise said. \u201cYou may recognize some of them from the news or from the community \u2026 but respectfully, none of that matters.\u201d The first three rows of court were completely filled with Hunter Biden\u2019s friends and family, and a Secret Service agent could barely fit at the end of the front-row bench, with so many people trying to squeeze in. Jill Biden sat flanked by her son\u2019s wife on one side, and the first lady\u2019s daughter Ashley Biden on the other. As Wise continued, he returned to a theme that his colleague raised in opening statements: that \u201cno one is above the law.\u201d Jurors, he said, shouldn\u2019t treat this case differently \u201cbecause of who the defendant is.\u201d Evidence was \u2018ugly\u2019 but \u2018overwhelming,\u2019 prosecutors say Wise went on to explain to the jury \u2013 which includes many people whose loved ones are struggling with addiction \u2013 why the prosecution went into so many excruciating details about the defendant\u2019s spiral into crack cocaine abuse. \u201cThe evidence was personal, it was ugly, and it was overwhelming. It was also absolutely necessary,\u201d Wise said. \u201cThere is no other way to prove the use of drugs or addiction to drugs than through the kind of evidence that you saw.\u201d He noted, accurately, that the judge\u2019s instructions don\u2019t require the Justice Department to prove that Biden used drugs on a specific day, but only that he was \u201cactively engaged\u201d in drugs around that time. Recalling key testimony from earlier witnesses, Wise highlighted Biden\u2019s ex-girlfriend who testified that she saw him smoking crack in September 2018, less than two weeks before he bought the gun. Furthermore, he pointed out that Biden\u2019s rehab stints shortly before and after buying the firearm speaks to his \u201cpattern\u201d of drug use around that time. \u201cYou could convict on those facts alone,\u201d he said. \u2018It\u2019s time to end this case,\u2019 defense says During his nearly 90-minute closing argument, defense attorney Abbe Lowell forcefully made the case that prosecutors hadn\u2019t met the high burden to prove Biden\u2019s guilt, pointing to the issue of whether he knowingly violated the law. Lowell repeatedly said that prosecutors showed no direct evidence that Biden was using illegal drugs during October 2018, when he bought the firearm, comparing their case to a slight-of-hand deception. \u201cHave you ever seen the magician\u2019s trick of having you look at this hand, while in the other hand is where the trick is being done? Look at this \u2013 and then see that in the hand that matters, there is nothing there,\u201d Lowell said, invoking a motif that he raised several times during closing arguments. In order to reach a guilty verdict, prosecutors need to prove that Biden was \u201cconscious and aware\u201d of the law and how he was violating it, Lowell argued. \u201cWith this very high burden, it\u2019s time to end this case,\u201d Lowell said. Poking holes in key witness testimony The defense attorney also said there were serious flaws with the testimony from three of Biden\u2019s exes who testified in the case. Lowell noted that Hallie Biden couldn\u2019t remember key details from the day she found Biden\u2019s firearm in his truck. Lowell also questioned the veracity of\u00a0claims from Zoe Kestan\u00a0\u2013 who met Biden at a gentleman\u2019s club where she worked \u2013 noting the immunity deal she reached with prosecutors beforehand. Lowell said Kestan met with prosecutors many times \u201cto rehearse\u201d her testimony \u2013 instantly drawing an objection from the special counsel\u2019s team. Lowell also pointed out that Kestan took many pictures of Biden with drugs when they were together, but none from the critical month when he bought the gun. Lowell also attacked the prosecutors\u2019 case as based on \u201csuspicion\u201d and \u201cconjecture,\u201d phrases that he repeated many times, perhaps hoping to sow some doubt among the jurors. \u201cThere was no actual witness to the drug use in this period of time,\u201d Lowell asserted. Clash over Naomi Biden\u2019s testimony The two sides clashed over the\u00a0testimony of Naomi Biden, who was called as a defense witness on Friday. In his closing arguments, Lowell said prosecutors were \u201cextraordinarily cruel\u201d to Biden\u2019s daughter by asking her during their cross-examination if she ever used cocaine. They posed that question while trying to establish that, because she doesn\u2019t do drugs, it was likely her father who left crack remnants in their shared truck. Lowell glared directly at prosecutors as he criticized the prosecutors, raising his voice and banging his fist on the lectern. But after he was done, prosecutors quickly shot back, telling the jury that they believed Naomi Biden\u2019s testimony actually hurt her father\u2019s defense. \u201cWho called the defendant\u2019s daughter as a witness in this case? Not us,\u201d prosecutor Derek Hines said during his rebuttal. \u201c\u2026 And you saw up there on the stand how uncomfortable she was. The anguish sitting there knowing she was testifying as a defense witness, but she had to tell the truth.\u201d He argued that \u201cshe couldn\u2019t vouch for the defendant\u2019s sobriety throughout that month of October\u201d 2018 when he bought the gun because she swore to tell the truth and could be prosecuted if she lied. Hunter Biden doesn\u2019t testify As last week\u2019s proceedings wrapped up on Friday, Lowell told the judge the defense team was still making the decision over whether their client would testify in his own defense. That would\u2019ve been an extremely risky move that could have opened the president\u2019s son up to intense and potentially expansive questioning from the special counsel prosecutors. Ultimately, however, Lowell said Monday that Biden would not testify and instructions to the jury were adjusted to make it clear they aren\u2019t allowed to hold that decision against him in their deliberations. The jury will continue its deliberations Tuesday morning.

Tesla\u2019s stock price slid by more than half from its peak as a trillion-dollar company in late 2021. Its sales fell short of forecasts and promises. Its profits are squeezed by a global price war for EVs that it started itself. The answer will come Thursday, when Tesla holds its annual shareholders meeting and announces results of shareholder votes on two proposals. One would once again approve the package of 303 million split-adjusted stock options, worth $46.9 billion as of Friday\u2019s closing price. That\u2019s down from the $51 billion those options were worth at the time of the decision. The shareholders approved the package back in 2018, with 73% voting in favor of it. But Delaware Chancery Court Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick in January ruled in favor of shareholders who challenged the package. She wrote that the company\u2019s board \u201cbore the burden of proving that the compensation plan was fair, and they failed to meet their burden.\u201d McCormick said that process the Tesla board used to create the pay package was \u201cdeeply flawed\u201d and criticized the board for being to close to the famous CEO to represent the interests of the shareholders. \u201cMusk launched a self-driving process, recalibrating the speed and direction along the way as he saw fit,\u201d she wrote. Musk and Tesla reacted by appealing the ruling, and by seeking permission from shareholders to move the company\u2019s state of incorporation from Delaware to Texas, where its headquarters is located. Many major companies are incorporated in a different state from where their main offices are located, often in Delaware, which has a reputation for being business friendly. It was because of Tesla\u2019s incorporation in Delaware that McCormick was able to rule on the fairness of the pay package. Despite the widespread support among shareholders back in 2018 for Musk\u2019s pay package, the Tesla board seems to be scrambling to shore-up support for this month\u2019s vote. It has filed with the SEC more than two dozen communications with shareholders advocating for a yes vote, far more active than most companies are when seeking shareholder approval of their proxy items. It has even opened a lottery in which the winning shareholder who casts a vote gets a tour of Tesla\u2019s Texas factory conducted personally by Musk. Holding Musk\u2019s focus Tesla\u2019s filings to shareholders argue it must keep the pay package in place to keep Musk fully engaged running Tesla and not one of his other companies. \u201cThis is obviously not about the money,\u201d Tesla Chair Robyn Denholm wrote in a letter to shareholders. \u201cWe all know Elon is one of the wealthiest people on the planet, and he would remain so even if Tesla were to renege on the commitment we made in 2018. Elon is not a typical executive, and Tesla is not a typical company.\u201d Rather, she continued, it\u2019s about \u201cwhat will motivate him to continue to create value for stockholders,\u201d she wrote. \u201cWhat we recognized in 2018 and continue to recognize today is that one thing Elon most certainly does not have is unlimited time,\u201d Denholm wrote. \u201cNor does he face any shortage of ideas and other places he can make an incredible difference in the world. We want those ideas, that energy and that time to be at Tesla, for the benefit of you, our owners. But that requires reciprocal respect.\u201d But part of the problem with winning support is that Musk is far more controversial than he was in 2018, and appears to be far less focused on simply running Tesla. He famously bought social media platform Twitter for $44 billion in 2022, selling $22.9 billion of his Tesla shares to help fund that purchase. He has even been accused of improperly selling $7.5 billon of those shares late that year knowing that Tesla was due to soon report disappointing sales that would reduce Tesla\u2019s price. Under his management of Twitter, since rebranded X, he\u2019s restored accounts for users who had been banned for hate speech, advocacy of violence or misinformation. Meanwhile, allegations about widespread antisemitism on the platform, and Musk\u2019s own endorsement of antisemitic tweets, has driven away many advertisers and caused widespread losses. But perhaps a more serious concern among Tesla shareholders is problems faced by the electric car pioneer itself. While shares shot up more than 1,700% between when the original package was approved in 2018 and its high point in November 2021, making Musk the richest person in the world at that time, it has lost more than half of that value since, including a 30% drop this year. Tesla has been forced to cut prices in the face of weaker than forecast demand for sales, and increased competition from other automakers offering their own EVs. \u201cThis shareholder vote is happening at the most tenuous time for Musk,\u201d said Dan Ives, tech analyst with Wedbush Securities and an analyst who is still bullish on Tesla shares. \u201cAfter Tesla went through a Cinderella ride, it\u2019s become a horror show. There\u2019s a group of shareholders who are frustrated. And this is a shot across the bow for them to show they\u2019re not satisfied.\u201d While Ives thinks that the pay package will again be approved by shareholders in the current vote, he said it will be a much closer vote this time. He said despite Tesla\u2019s problems and the controversy swirling around Musk, many shareholders believe keeping him at the company, and focused on Tesla more than SpaceX, his new artificial intelligence company xAI, The Boring Company, Neuralink and his rebranded social media company X, or his other ventures, is crucial for the company\u2019s future. Musk has even said he would not want to grow Tesla to become a leader in artificial intelligence and robotics, as he has promised, without a compensation plan that would give him ownership of around 25% of the company\u2019s stock. That would be about double the roughly 13% stake he currently owns. \u201cIt comes down to Musk,\u201d Ives said. \u201cMusk is still the hearts and lungs of the Tesla growth story.\u201d Supporters, opponents to Musk options Some high profile shareholders have spoken out in favor of Musk ahead of the vote, including Ron Baron, CEO of Baron Capital, which has Tesla as one of its top holdings with  a stake worth more than $2 billion in the company. \u201cElon\u2019s compensation contract contained aggressive performance metrics that few in 2018 believed could be achieved. If these aggressive performance metrics had not been achieved, Elon would have received\u00a0nothing,\u201d Baron said in a recent statement. \u201cWhen Tesla achieved targeted earnings, revenues, and market cap metrics, Tesla\u2019s shareholders benefitted greatly. He performed under his compensation contract. He earned his pay. Elon is the ultimate \u2018key man.\u2019\u00a0Without his relentless drive and uncompromising standards, there would be no Tesla.\u201d But there are also high profile opponents of the deal including Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis, two firms that advise investors on how to vote on proxy proposals. Both are urging no votes on Musk\u2019s package. \u201cThe award value was considered outsized from the start,\u201d wrote ISS. \u201cSome investors may find the board\u2019s argument compelling, that it would be unfair for CEO Musk not to receive the award. However, the concerns raised, both back in 2018 and in the interim, have not been sufficiently mitigated.\u201d On Saturday, the Norwegian government\u2019s sovereign wealth fund, which holds 28 million shares of Tesla, according to its most recent filing, said it had voted those shares against the pay package, adding that it did the same back in 2018. \u201cWhile we appreciate the significant value generated under Mr. Musk\u2019s leadership since the grant date in 2018, we remain concerned about the total size of the award, the structure given performance triggers, dilution, and lack of mitigation of key person risk,\u201d said its statement. It said it had voted in favor of the shift of incorporation to Texas. On X, Musk criticized the the decision of the sovereign fund to vote no. \u201cYeah, this is not cool,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cIf they actually surveyed their constituents, they would discover overwhelming support in favor. So far, roughly 90% of retail shareholders who have voted have voted in favor of both resolutions. The public sentiment is unequivocally supportive.\u201d In her decision throwing out the original package, McCormick rejected the argument that Musk would be uncompensated if the package was thrown out, writing, \u201cMusk\u2019s preexisting equity stake provided him tens of billions of dollars for his efforts.\u201d And it could continue to be up to the courts in Delaware to decide if Musk gets the options restored, no matter how the shareholders vote this month, and whether or not they approve incorporating in Texas. The attorneys for Tesla have told the court in Delaware that the companies\u2019 desire to move its incorporation to Texas is not an effort to evade jurisdiction from the original court order in Delaware as that case is appealed. But the outcome of the vote could decide how much Musk wants to continue to be involved with Tesla, the company that made him so rich and so famous before he became so controversial.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/09/business/elon-musk-pay-package-shareholder-vote/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_10_politics_bob-menendez-bribery-trial", "text": "For more than four weeks, Sen. Bob Menendez has been a mostly peripheral figure at his bribery and corruption trial. On Monday, at federal court in Lower Manhattan, the New Jersey Democrat became the main character. Prosecutors\u2019 star witness, businessman Jose Uribe, told the jury for the first time that Menendez helped drive the wider conspiracy that ensnared the senator; his wife, Nadine Menendez; and two co-defendants. In his testimony, Uribe, who pleaded guilty before the trial began and is cooperating with prosecutors, described Menendez as a Godfather-like character who lorded his power over others and, by his deeds and demeanor, appeared to many as an all-powerful figure with vast influence in all walks of life. Menendez, in Uribe\u2019s telling, rarely asked any questions and provided only a blinkered view into his plans and actions. But months after allegedly delivering on the key pieces of the bribery scheme, Menendez, during a 2020\u00a0dinner with Uribe, sat back, his hands crossed over his stomach, and reminded the businessman of all he\u2019d done. \u201cI saved your a** twice. Not once, but twice,\u201d Menendez told him in Spanish, Uribe testified. Nadine and her adult daughter, who were also at the dinner, had just excused themselves to use the bathroom. Before they returned, the senator bragged that it had not been difficult work, but Uribe said his body language suggested that \u201che was proud and confident that he got this done.\u201d Uribe, who first took the stand on Friday, described a series of meetings with Bob and Nadine Menendez as he sought the senator\u2019s help in quashing the prosecution of an associate and a state investigation that he feared would ultimately lead back to his businesses and the close friends who nominally ran them. Those concerns, Uribe said, led him to leverage his relationship with Nadine Menendez \u2013 most notably the Mercedes-Benz convertible he purchased for her \u2013 into audiences with the senator and, eventually, the interventions that led to the Menendezes being charged with conspiring to accept gold bars, bricks of cash and a swishy car in exchange for an assortment of political and legal favors. (Nadine Menendez, who is being treated for breast cancer, is being tried separately, likely in July.) Lawyers for Bob Menendez have sought to portray him as an afterthought in the matter. In their opening arguments, they urged the jury to consider the question \u201cWhere\u2019s Bob?\u201d \u2013 asserting that he was either unaware or not involved in the machinations alleged by prosecutors. It was his then-girlfriend Nadine driving the bus, they said, with the senator evincing only a partial, passive awareness of her actions. Uribe told a different story. In one meeting on the patio in Nadine\u2019s backyard in September 2019, the night before Menendez met with New Jersey Attorney General Gurbir Grewal, Uribe said the senator asked him to write down the names of the people and businesses at the heart of Uribe\u2019s \u201cworries.\u201d In Uribe\u2019s telling, after a brief chat, Menendez called out \u201cmon amour\u201d to Nadine, who was inside the home, while ringing a little bell set up on their backyard table. Nadine emerged with paper and disappeared back inside before Uribe began to write. The senator did not offer much information in return, Uribe said. The next morning, Uribe texted Nadine \u2013 according to phone records \u2013 thanking her \u201cfor everything you do for me\u201d and saying he was \u201cpraying today\u2019s meeting is in GOD\u2019s hand.\u201d Uribe said he did not know, even then, with whom Menendez would be sitting down. Hours later, though, he received another message from Nadine, this time asking him to meet the senator at Menendez\u2019s New Jersey apartment building. (The couple was not yet married and kept separate residences.) Uribe recalled entering to see Menendez chatting in the lobby with a receptionist. The two then walked toward a quieter corner and began to chat. \u201cThe thing you asked me about, there doesn\u2019t seem to be anything there,\u201d Menendez said, according to Uribe, who took it to mean that, while nothing was formally settled, he should no longer be concerned about a probe into his businesses or associates. Uribe said he left optimistic but unsettled. He had come through for Nadine, buying her a new car after she had totaled her old one in a fatal accident \u2013 a detail that has not been disclosed to the jury \u2013 and was desperate for her to help him \u201cstop and kill\u201d his looming legal troubles. \u201cPeace,\u201d as Uribe described it, came in time. About eight weeks later, he received a phone call at his home from a 202 area code \u2013 from Washington, DC. Menendez was on the other line, Uribe said, and told him the good news. \u201cThat thing you asked me about, there\u2019s nothing there,\u201d Menendez told him. \u201cI give you your \u2018peace.\u2019\u201d Uribe became emotional as he spoke about the call. His work had come good. His fears were vanquished \u2013 all thanks, he said, to Bob Menendez. He texted Nadine, \u201cI got a call and I am a very happy person.\u201d \u201cGOD bless you and him for ever,\u201d she replied. Days later, Uribe and an associate met with the couple\u00a0at a local restaurant. Prosecutors showed the court a picture of the foursome smiling widely with champagne glasses raised \u2013 the bubbly had been sent to their table by other diners. One cause for celebration, Uribe said, went unspoken. Instead, they toasted the engagement of Nadine and Bob, who would get married in 2020. \u201cIt was the right place to be that day,\u201d an emotional Uribe told the court. Their gatherings slowed when the Covid-19 pandemic hit a few months later. The dinner when Menendez crowed about taking care of Uribe would not happen until August 2020, when they met to eat outside. Nearly two years would then pass with Uribe keeping in touch with the Menendezes as he tried to finagle a new insurance broker\u2019s license. His first one had been voided as part of a separate criminal probe years earlier. Not much came of those efforts, he said Monday, apart from a dead-end introduction. Uribe said he learned about the investigation that ultimately led him to plead guilty and testify against the senator in June 2022, when FBI agents turned up at his home, took his cell phone and handed him \u201csubpoenas\u201d for assorted documents and records largely related to his payments on Nadine Menendez\u2019s Mercedes. Nadine Menendez and Uribe would meet one more time \u2013 at a Marriott hotel bar in New Jersey, the same place Uribe and two associates first hatched the plan at the offering of Wael Hana. The Egyptian American businessman \u2013 a co-defendant in this case \u2013 told them he could parlay his own friendship with Nadine Menendez into assistance from the senator. It would, Hana allegedly said, cost between $200,000 and $250,000. During their 2022 chat, Nadine Menendez and Uribe shared notes on the federal probe. She asked him, he said, what he planned to tell the FBI about the car payments. Uribe told her he planned to say he was helping a friend and expected to be repaid. Nadine Menendez approved of the plan, he said. The payments would be retconned as a loan. She mailed his lawyer a check for $21,000, considerably less than what he had spent on the Mercedes. How, prosecutor Lara Pomerantz asked, did she arrive at that figure? \u201cNo idea,\u201d Uribe said. It was the last time they spoke.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/10/politics/bob-menendez-bribery-trial/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "us"}}

Donald Trump\u2019s former attorney was given 30 days to appear and get his mug shot and fingerprints taken, according to a Maricopa County court commissioner, after a problematic attempt by agents within the Arizona attorney general\u2019s office to serve Giuliani last month. Giuliani was served on May 17\u00a0in Palm Beach, Florida, at his 80th\u00a0birthday bash held by a GOP operative. Arizona prosecutors spent weeks trying to track down the former New York City mayor and eventually found him based on his podcasts. Giuliani also posted a $10,000 bond in cash on Monday, according to court documents. A grand jury in Arizona\u00a0handed up indictments\u00a0last month charging over a dozen Trump allies, including the fake electors and several individuals connected to his campaign, over their efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss. \u201cThis yet another example of partisan actors weaponizing the criminal justice system to interfere with the 2024 presidential election through outlandish charges against President Trump and anyone willing to take on the permanent Washington political class,\u201d said Ted Goodman, a spokesperson for Giuliani.

{"id": "2024_06_10_tech_apple-ai-next-big-thing", "text": "Apple just kicked off a brand new era for the company with the introduction of its first generative AI features for the iPhone. At its annual Worldwide Developers Conference on Monday, the company unveiled the first batch of tools powered by \u201cApple Intelligence,\u201d from personalized Genmoji \u2013 Apple\u2019s AI-generated emoji \u2013 to a significantly smarter Siri, which can answer questions about your schedule, what\u2019s in your email and what time your loved one\u2019s flight is landing. It also announced a partnership with ChatGPT creator OpenAI to power the features. Although the partnership will likely give the company a much-needed boost, Apple aligning itself with a company and a technology that have yet to win public trust, facing criticism for taking user inputs and incorporating them into ChatGPT\u2019s data set may cause some challenges down the road. Apple emphasized privacy and security during its presentation, noting most AI functions will be done on the phone, keeping inputs away from a far-off server cloud. A big push into AI could spur growth for iPhone sales and services for years to come, as users are now waiting longer to upgrade their devices and an uncertain economic environment weighs on consumers, particularly in China. The company also faces regulatory scrutiny in Washington and was passed this week by chip maker Nvidia as the second-largest public company in the US. The company said it\u2019s been impressed with the generative AI tools already on the market, but wanted to make it more personal with privacy in mind. \u201cAs we look to build in these incredible new capabilities, we want to ensure that the outcome reflects the principles at the core of our products, it has to be powerful enough to help with the things that matter most to you,\u201d Apple CEO Tim Cook said during the keynote. \u201cIt has to be intuitive and easy to use. It has to be deeply integrated into your product experiences.\u201d He added: \u201cMost importantly, it has to understand you and be grounded in your personal context, like your routine, your relationships, your communications, and more. And, of course, it has to be built with privacy, from the ground up.\u201d The timing is also noteworthy: Apple is not always first to adopt and integrate emerging technologies \u2014 it typically researches, develops and aims to perfect new tech for years before including it in new products \u2014 but the speed at which the world is adopting generative AI is perhaps expediting the company\u2019s need to have a smartphone with the most cutting-edge technology. Here\u2019s a closer look at what Apple announced at its big event: AI, AI and more AI Apple is embracing generative AI \u2013 the buzzy form of artificial intelligence that can provide thoughtful and thorough responses to questions \u2013 through Siri, the company\u2019s virtual assistant with a hit-or-miss track record, essentially turning it into an iPhone chatbot. This could enable Siri to perform specific tasks such as recalling a picture taken years ago on the device or answering detailed questions about the weather, the news or trivia. It can also perform more advanced tasks, such as answering when a user\u2019s mom\u2019s plane is landing, by analyzing information previously sent in an email. Over time, it could learn the user\u2019s preferences and respond accordingly. This is not unlike what some competitors have already introduced in generative tools. Siri will also likely adapt automatically and seamlessly to users, based on voice, audio and natural language, along with images and contextual cues. Users will also be able to create personalized photos, such as taking a picture of your mom and making it into a stylized, cartoon-y version, adding a superhero cape. It can take action across apps, including asking the software to pull up all photos of a family member, and retrieve and analyze data from across your apps, such as factoring in what\u2019s on your screen like email or a calendar. If a meeting is being rescheduled, Apple Intelligence can process relevant personal data and see the email your kid sent days before about a recital, alerting users if there may be a conflict. In a Q&A following the keynote, Cook once again said the company is taking privacy and security very seriously with the rollout of the new technology. \u201cWe think AI\u2019s role is not to replace users but to empower them,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you think about what\u2019s possible, it has to be integrated with the experience and be intuitive, and informed by your personal context and knowledge of you. If you\u2019re going to do that, there\u2019s a lot of responsibility.\u201d Beyond AI Apple kicked off its iOS 18 portion of the event by highlighting new controls and personalization coming to iOS 18, including a revamped look for all icons when it goes into Dark Mode, a new tint color that compliments wallpaper and a redesigned control center that is available from the lock screen, so you can swap the flashlight icon for other tools. Apple said it is also doubling down on privacy and security, such as giving users the option to \u201clock\u201d certain apps, making them accessible only via Face ID, Touch ID or a user\u2019s passcode. The feature could be especially helpful to protect apps like a banking app, an insurance app, or if you\u2019re handing your phone over to show off photos or get someone\u2019s phone number. Users can now also \u201chide\u201d an app, so it will show up only in a locked, hidden folder. And media from hidden apps won\u2019t show up anywhere else on their phone. Text messages are getting a bump, too. The company said it will soon let people send texts via satellite, even if they don\u2019t have a cell or WiFi connection. Apple is also adding what it called one of the most requested features in iMessage: the ability to schedule messages .iPhone users will now be able to record and create transcripts of calls right from the phone app. All parties to the call will be notified when it is being recorded. Other product updates The company also made software updates to other products, including the Mac, AirPods and Apple Watch. Apple showed off its latest MacOS software called Sequoia, with a handful of new productivity features. Phone mirroring, for example, will bring iPhone alerts directly to the laptop that show up directly next to Mac notifications. MacOS will also support the ability to arrange windows open on screen in certain areas, such as side by side \u2014 a concept popularized by Microsoft Windows. Video conferencing is getting a presenter preview, so users can see what they\u2019re going to share before they share it. Apple is also introducing background replacements on calls, so users can hide the laundry behind them. Meanwhile, AirPods users will be able to answer or decline a call with just a nod or shake of their head. And new vital sign tracking on Apple Watch can notify users when they may be getting sick, based on signals like body temperature and heart rate. Vision Pro update Just a few months after its launch, Apple showed off a few upgrades coming to the software that powers its Vision Pro mixed reality headset. During its most recent earnings call, Cook said more than half of the Fortune 100 companies have already bought an Apple Vision Pro. \u201c[We] are exploring innovative ways to use it to do things that weren\u2019t possible before,\u201d he added. Vision OS 2 promises to offer more rich experiences for users, such as a wider display for work stations, new hand gestures that let you check battery life or open up the home screen, and get deeper inside the photos in your library, thanks to advanced machine learning that provides more natural depth. The company said it is also adding more capability for users to capture spatial videos. Apple is also bringing Vision Pro to more countries, including the UK, China, Japan Singapore and Australia, this summer. Upgrades could also boost sales of the pricey Vision Pro, which starts at $3,499. Demand for Apple\u2019s new headset has\u00a0reportedly\u00a0been weak.

{"id": "2024_06_07_us_911-dispatcher-pennsylvania", "text": "Prosecutors this week dropped an involuntary manslaughter case against a 911 dispatcher in Pennsylvania who had been accused of failing to send an ambulance to the rural home of a woman who was found dead a day later of internal bleeding. Greene County District Attorney Brianna Vanata said she acted to end the\u00a0case against Leon \u201cLee\u201d Price\u00a0after reviewing an investigator\u2019s report that said he felt charges were not justified in the July 2020 death of 54-year-old Diania Kronk. \u201cThere was just no criminal culpability here,\u201d Vanata said in a phone interview Thursday. She said the decision to pursue charges two years after Kronk died \u2014 and shortly after her family filed a lawsuit over it \u2014 was a mistake by the then-district attorney, Dave Russo. \u201cI\u2019m not sure what the previous district attorney was thinking,\u201d Vanata said. \u201cThat\u2019s where I\u2019m at.\u201d Price\u2019s defense lawyer, Timothy Ross, said Thursday the charges had been a stressful ordeal for his client, who he described as an upstanding employee who had consistently maintained he was innocent of the allegations. In the wake of Kronk\u2019s death, Ross said, an investigator had told Price he would not be charged. Ross said Price is \u201cmoving forward, rebuilding his reputation in this community and just happy to put these charges behind him.\u201d Investigators had said Price was reluctant to dispatch help without getting more assurances Kronk would actually go to the hospital. Vanata said she based her decision on an August 2020 memo by Greene County Regional Police Chief Zachary Sams that said Price may not have been trained properly and the investigator felt Price\u2019s actions did not \u201crise to the levels necessary to facilitate a criminal charge.\u201d On a recording, Price was heard questioning Kronk\u2019s daughter, Kelly Titchenell, for about four minutes. As Titchenell described her mother\u2019s condition, Price asked if Kronk was \u201cwilling to go\u201d to the hospital about a half-hour away from her home in Sycamore. Titchenell assured him she would and said she was concerned her mother might die. Titchenell told the dispatcher Kronk had been drinking heavily for some weeks, she had been losing weight and appeared to be turning yellow. Price said he would send an ambulance but then added that \u201cwe really need to make sure she\u2019s willing to go.\u201d Price asked Titchenell to call once she got to Kronk\u2019s home, but Titchenell said she could not find her mother\u2019s landline and there was no cell service. Titchenell said that when she got to Kronk\u2019s home, her mother was nude on the porch and talking incoherently, telling her repeatedly she was OK. Titchenell said an autopsy attributed Kronk\u2019s death to internal bleeding. Titchenell did not call 911 again on her way home, believing that her uncle would soon check on her mother. The uncle discovered the next day that Kronk had died. Russo defended the charges on Thursday, saying there was ample evidence and called Vanata\u2019s move to drop the case a political decision. Russo said the involuntary manslaughter charge had survived previous efforts by the defense to have it dismissed. At Vanata\u2019s request, a judge withdrew the charges on Monday. Jury selection and trial had been scheduled for next week. Vanata said she approached Price about a potential plea bargain to a lesser charge but he did not take the deal. Titchenell questions the decision to drop charges. \u201cI feel that there was too much for the new district attorney to go through,\u201d Titchenell said in a phone interview Wednesday. \u201cShe would have had to put in a lot of time and work to understand this case, to go over everything. I feel there was too much for her, so she was trying to basically get away without going to trial.\u201d Vanata, who beat Russo in the\u00a02023 GOP\u00a0primary by 44 percentage points, said she spent \u201cmany, many hours\u201d going through the evidence since taking office in January. \u201cIt definitely was not an easy decision to come to.\u201d Price is no longer a dispatcher and now works for Greene County in maintenance. \u201cMr. Price did lose his job and this, I\u2019m sure, has been an ordeal for him,\u201d Vanata said. \u201cBut also I feel so horrible for the family that had to go through this as well.

{"id": "2024_06_10_us_akron-ohio-mass-shooting-police-update", "text": "Investigators have identified a 28th victim in a mass shooting at a birthday party in Akron, Ohio, last week that left one person dead, city officials said Monday, as they continue their search for a suspect or suspects. The latest victim was initially believed to be a witness but was in fact grazed by a bullet, Akron Police Chief Brian Harding said at a news conference Monday, eight days after gunfire erupted at the party early on June 2. The 36-year-old woman went to a hospital after the shooting but was referred elsewhere, Harding said, and ultimately did not seek medical treatment. Police continue to follow up on leads, Harding said, telling reporters investigators had received a \u201clarge number of tips.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t have a specific suspect or any of that information that I\u2019m willing to share right now,\u201d Harding said. Police initially said there were 25 victims, including the 27-year-old man who was killed. Last Wednesday, Akron Police updated that figure, announcing in a post on Facebook that 27 individuals were hit by gunfire and identifying the deceased victim as LaTeris Cook. At that time, two victims remained in critical condition, while the other 25 were either stable or had been released from medical care. The shooting is one of at least 208 mass shootings in the US so far this year, according to the Gun Violence Archive, which \u2013 like CNN\u00a0\u2013 defines a mass shooting as one in which four or more people are injured, excluding the shooter or shooters. Police responded shortly after midnight on June 2 to 911 calls reporting shots fired and multiple victims, according to an earlier statement from Harding and Mayor Shammas Malik. The shooting took place at a \u201clarge birthday party\u201d where 200 people had been in attendance, Harding said at a news conference that evening. The scene appeared \u201cconsistent with someone driving by shooting out of a car,\u201d Harding said at the time. Investigators recovered 45 shell casings fired from at least five different guns, the city\u2019s update last Wednesday said, adding three handguns were found at the scene. At least one person returned fire, the update said. Several agencies \u2013 including the ATF and US Marshals \u2013 are offering up to $22,500 in rewards for information related to the case. Also Monday, Mayor Malik announced the city was creating a gun violence response fund aimed at assisting the victims of last week\u2019s shooting and the victims of future shootings. \u201cGun violence is a huge issue in our community and in many cities across the country. It\u2019s something that has been a high priority for me and for our new administration and will continue to be,\u201d he said.

{"id": "2024_06_10_business_vintage-collectible-toys-market-sale", "text": "An action figure from 1979 that was never officially released in stores has become the most valuable vintage toy ever sold at auction, fetching a final bid that could buy a three-bedroom, two-bath home in many parts of the United States. The Rocket-Firing Boba Fett action figure, modeled after the \u201cStar Wars\u201d bounty hunter, was purchased in Dallas by an anonymous buyer for $525,000, Heritage Auctions announced last Monday. It dethroned Barbie from the No. 1 spot she had held since 2010, when a version of the iconic doll with a necklace of real diamonds sold at a Christie\u2019s auction for $302,500. Pricey efforts by collectors to get their hands on specific toys are par for the course in this niche field, one that can be lucrative but also one where pricing is opaque and volatile and many of the most expensive deals are brokered privately among hobbyists. Part of what makes almost any memorabilia market so speculative and unstable, especially one based on entertainment, is that it\u2019s governed by sentiment and nostalgia. Those who grew up playing with the earliest action figures in the 1970s and 1980s now have the money to spend on some of the toys they had (or couldn\u2019t have) as kids, and many hobbyists are willing to pour a lot of money into rare vintage toys. \u201cI have a lot more disposable income now than I did when I was collecting toys as a kid,\u201d said Justin Caravoulias, the Action Figures & Toys consignment director at Heritage Auctions, whose own collection includes a range of G.I. Joe action figures from the 1960s to present day. \u201cPeople my age have the disposable income to say, \u2018I want that $100 Rambo figure, I want that $400 Hot Toys Star Wars figure or, hey, I want the $525,000 Boba Fett figure.\u2019 So the people who have grown up with it have matured to the point where they can spend some real money on these things.\u201d And while that old toy box in the back of that closet full of beat-up He-Man, Batman and Barbie dolls almost certainly won\u2019t be worth as much as the jackpot Boba Fett, adults today are increasingly gravitating toward buying toys for themselves \u2014 perhaps invigorating new collectible markets down the road. The toy that never was The \u201cRocket Fett,\u201d as it is sometimes called, was part of a mail-away promotion from American toy maker Kenner, which had sold popular toys from properties like \u201cStar Wars\u201d and \u201cBatman.\u201d Under the promotion, anyone who provided proof of purchasing four \u201cStar Wars\u201d action figures would be mailed a Boba Fett figure that had a rocket launcher on its back. But Kenner ultimately decided to attach the plastic rocket onto the toy because it posed a choking hazard to children. The figures came with a \u201cNote to Customers\u201d from the company explaining the change. While no rocket-firing toys were mailed out, a number of them were saved by Kenner employees before the company destroyed its stock. Toy dealer Brian Rachfal, who represented the seller in the Heritage auction, estimates there are about 100 rocket-firing models of various types in circulation among vintage toy collectors and hobbyists. Some have even gone as far as tracking down former Kenner employees to purchase the models they saved, a dogged determination that\u2019s typical in many collectible markets where interpersonal deals still reign supreme. Dolls are for girls, action figures are for boys Unlike fine art or sports memorabilia, the collectible action figure market is only a handful of decades old because action figures have only been around since the mid-1960s. \u201cThe first action figure was G.I. Joe in 1964,\u201d said Caravoulias. He recounted how Hasbro executive Don Levine coined the term \u201caction figure\u201d as a marketing tool, because \u201cwe can\u2019t call these dolls. Boys do not want to play with \u2018dolls.\u2019\u201d Even today, toy experts tell CNN that action figure collectors tend to overwhelmingly be men, many in high-powered professions like finance and the entertainment industry. The market took off in the 1970s and 1980s with properties like \u201cStar Wars,\u201d \u201cMasters of the Universe\u201d and \u201cTransformers.\u201d At the time, these action figures were simply that: toys meant to be played with and stored in a toy bin or the family playroom. \u201cNobody saved them in the box, because why would you? You you can\u2019t play with it while it\u2019s in the box,\u201d said Caravoulias. \u201cThere were very few people who are actually collecting them in this sense that we know today, as something that would be worth anything in the future.\u201d By the 1990s, adults driven by nostalgia began seeking out the toys they grew up with. Increased demand \u2014 coupled with the fact that it was rare to find these toys in original packaging \u2014 pushed prices for pristine-condition action figures even higher, a trend that continues today. According to Caravoulias, the value of a piece is driven by its popularity among collectors, its condition and how common it is to find it in its original packaging. Action figures lose their collectability if they\u2019re all saved in pristine condition. Price is typically subject to the buyers and sellers in any given transaction. With public auctions, the bidders set the ultimate dollar value, while experts can give a range of how much a product might be worth. But even that can change depending on demand among other factors. In 2012, a similar Rocket Fett would have sold for $15,000, said Caravoulias. Other experts note that the items with the highest price tags typically change hands in private sales. Tom Derby, a strategic analyst at Collectible Investment Brokerage who authenticates high-end collectibles, told CNN he facilitates about $10 million in transactions per year. The largest private sale he has ever brokered was for the original wax sculpture model of the first Darth Vader action figure for just under $1.2 million. \u201cThe problem with the private sales is you don\u2019t know really what\u2019s going on,\u201d said Rachfal. \u201cSometimes they\u2019re cash, sometimes they\u2019re cash and trade. Sometimes the yields can drag out. So it\u2019s really kind of hard to compare. It\u2019s not necessarily apples to apples.\u201d Nostalgia drives a lucrative market Many vintage toy collectors enter the hobby out of passion and nostalgia, experts say. Caravoulias recalls laying in bed as a kid in 1985 and wishing he could buy a $5 Rambo II action figure. As with anything collectible, at times people find it hard to put a dollar amount on a piece they\u2019re attached to and are reluctant to part with it regardless of the potential monetary value attached. Rachfal says the showcase of his collection \u2014 which at one time included 11 Rocket-Firing Boba Fett figures \u2014 has several pieces he can\u2019t imagine parting with. \u201cI don\u2019t know what type of money a person could offer me that would not make me cringe for the rest of my life as I walked by that showcase and the pieces aren\u2019t there,\u201d he said. \u201cMoney doesn\u2019t always talk in the hobby. What makes some of these pieces so desirable is because you just can\u2019t get them.\u201d Those who acquire the most valuable pieces are protective of their privacy over fears of theft and to avoid being harangued by other overeager toy buyers. According to Derby, over the past four years, one buyer is a \u201chousehold name\u201d who bought the majority of the best pieces. Caravoulias recommends people collect whatever sparks their interest, as they\u2019re more likely to be better informed about the market if they\u2019re invested emotionally, not just financially, in their collection. When it comes to toys, he says the safest investment are properties that have maintained their relevance for multiple generations and continue reinventing themselves, like \u201cStar Wars\u201d and \u201cTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.\u201d \u201cI think that \u2018Power Rangers\u2019 will be the next one that comes up,\u201d Caravoulias added. \u201cKids played with them and adults really didn\u2019t think to save them. There are packaged examples out there, but they\u2019re not in collector-grade condition. And I think a lot of people will come back and want to collect what they had when they were a kid, probably in the original packaging.\u201d On the other hand, he cited \u201cBeanie Babies\u201d as \u201ca study in what not to do,\u201d referring to the 1990s craze over the plush toys that spurred hysteria among collectors. \u201cBeanie Babies\u201d were manufactured to be collectible, with a limited number of toys released for each series and some pieces that were discontinued seemingly at random. Interest plummeted after a few years, and the value of the stuffed animals likewise crashed. \u201cThe hugest missing component of \u2018Beanie Babies\u2019 is they were collectible right from the beginning,\u201d Caravoulias said. \u201cThey were collected because there was scarcity. And they were fun to collect. But they had no nostalgia because they were collected right off the bat.\u201d Adults dominate the toy market for the first time ever Even beyond rare and collectible pieces, adults are now the most lucrative cohort for the toy industry, beating out preschoolers for the first time ever. In the first quarter of 2024, those 18 and older spent more than $1.5 billion on toys for themselves, according to a report published Thursday by market research firm Circana. Nearly half of adults who bought a toy for themselves in the past 12 months cited \u201csocialization, enjoyment, and collecting\u201d as their motivation. According to Circana, last year\u2019s highest selling toy properties included \u201cPok\u00e9mon,\u201d \u201cBarbie,\u201d \u201cStar Wars\u201d and \u201cHot Wheels.\u201d All of these properties have extensive vintage catalogues, and their enduring relevance and legacy have only propelled prices for older items in the more niche vintage toy market. Some experts say the pandemic was a catalyst for adults\u2019 mainstream interest in toys. \u201cDuring the pandemic, when people were flush with cash and had time to spend at home whether with their families or alone, they wanted to reconnect with the toys that made them happy as kids,\u201d James Zahn, editor-in-chief of industry trade publication The Toy Book, told CNN. But toy collectors by that point had already ramped up their interest. \u201cWe\u2019re talking everything \u2014 dolls, action figures and die-cast vehicles,\u201d he said. \u201cOutside of collectibles, there are boardgames, Lego building sets, and trading cards, (which are extraordinarily hot again) that are also firing up adult interest.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/10/business/vintage-collectible-toys-market-sale/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_10_us_rev-james-lawson-jr-civil-rights-icon-dies", "text": "The Rev. James Lawson Jr., a civil rights icon who trained activists in nonviolent protest, died Sunday, according to the pastor at Holman United Methodist Church in Los Angeles, where Lawson was reverend emeritus. Lawson died in Los Angeles, Rev. Christian Washington told CNN Monday. He was 95. Lawson was born in Uniontown, Pennsylvania, in 1928,\u00a0according to\u00a0his biography by The Martin Luther King, Jr. Research and Education Institute at Stanford University. In 1951, he was imprisoned for refusing to register with the armed forces. After his parole the following year, he traveled to India for missionary work with the Methodist Church, the biography states. There, he studied\u00a0Mahatma\u00a0Gandhi\u2019s use of nonviolence. He returned to the United States in 1956 and studied at Oberlin College School of Theology and Vanderbilt University, according to the biography. Lawson met the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. the following year. The civil rights leader urged Lawson to move to the South to teach nonviolence to others, his biography states, and that same year, Lawson would organize workshops on nonviolence for residents of Nashville and students at Vanderbilt and elsewhere. Following the lunch counter sit-ins in Greensboro, North Carolina, Lawson and other activists held nonviolent protests in Nashville\u2019s downtown stores, according to the biography. He was expelled from Vanderbilt in 1960 due to his involvement in the city\u2019s desegregation movement. King went on to praise Lawson and other preachers for \u201cfighting for the rights of his people\u201d in his April 3, 1968, \u201cI\u2019ve Been to the Mountaintop\u201d speech \u2013 his last. \u201cAnd I want to commend the preachers, under the leadership of these noble men: James Lawson, one who has been in this struggle for many years; he\u2019s been to jail for struggling; but he\u2019s still going on, fighting for the rights of his people. Rev. Ralph Jackson, Billy Kiles; I could just go right on down the list, but time will not permit,\u201d King said. \u201cBut I want to thank them all. And I want you to thank them, because so often, preachers aren\u2019t concerned about anything but themselves. And I\u2019m always happy to see a relevant ministry.\u201d After King\u2019s assassination, Lawson continued working with civil rights groups, including the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. Lawson was the pastor of Holman United Methodist Church in Los Angeles from 1974 to 1999, according to the\u00a0church. He held workshops on nonviolence well into his 90s, Washington said. Lawson also taught at the University of California Los Angeles\u2019 college of social sciences, and university officials\u00a0there\u00a0called him\u00a0\u201cone of the most impactful social justice leaders of the twentieth-century.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/10/us/rev-james-lawson-jr-civil-rights-icon-dies/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_10_us_baltimore-bridge-shipping-channel-opens", "text": "The Port of Baltimore\u2019s shipping channel is fully operational again, response officials announced Monday, more than two months after a massive cargo ship crashed into the Francis Scott Key Bridge, killing six construction workers and cutting off access to the crucial shipping artery. \u201cWe\u2019ve cleared the Fort McHenry Federal Channel for safe transit,\u201d Baltimore District Commander Col. Estee Pinchasin said in a statement Monday. \u201cAlthough the overarching goal to restore full operational capacity to the Federal Channel was successful, each day we thought of those who lost their lives, their families and the workers impacted by this tragic event.\u201d \u201cNot a day went by that we didn\u2019t think about all of them, and that kept us going,\u201d Pinchasin added. Fully reopening the 700-foot wide channel meant crews had to remove roughly 50,000 tons of wreckage from the Patapsco River, according to a Monday news release from Unified Command, a group of agencies that led the response to the collapse. That response included more than 2,000 people and subject matter experts, nearly two dozen tugboats, 13 floating cranes and 10 excavators, among other equipment. The channel, which provides access to an essential international cargo destination, closed to vessel traffic on March 26, after a 213-million pound cargo ship\u00a0lost power and crashed into\u00a0one of the bridge\u2019s support columns, causing the structure to collapse. The collapse, which was captured in stunning video, sparked a multi-agency investigation into what caused the disaster. Recovery crews worked for weeks to remove debris and recover the victims, who were from Honduras, El Salvador, Mexico and Guatemala \u2013 though many had called Maryland home for years. They were fathers, loving partners, sons and visionaries who left behind grieving communities and unfulfilled dreams. The ship, a container vessel called Dali, remained lodged in the channel until it was hauled away on May 20, after crews were able to remove a piece of the bridge that had been pinning down its bow. The ship\u2019s removal allowed for the opening of a temporary 400-foot channel, and cruise ships were able to once again depart from the port at the end of May. Last week, crews cleared the final large steel truss that had been blocking the full channel and had been working to ensure no hazards remain, according to the Unified Command. The closing of the channel was a blow to the port\u2019s economy, which officials say supported tens of thousands of jobs. While the full cost of rebuilding the bridge is not clear, President Joe Biden has pledged federal support to make it happen. The Insurance Information Institute has estimated the bridge alone could be worth more than $1.2 billion.

{"id": "2024_06_10_tech_hospital-cyberattack-google-microsoft", "text": "Microsoft and Google will offer free or discounted cybersecurity services to rural hospitals across the United States to make them less vulnerable to cyberattacks that have disrupted patient care and threatened lives, the White House and those tech firms said Monday. Microsoft said in a statement to CNN that it would provide free security updates for eligible rural hospitals, as well as security assessments and training for hospital staff. Google will provide free cybersecurity advice to rural hospitals and start a pilot program to match the firm\u2019s cybersecurity services with the needs of rural hospitals. The nation\u2019s roughly 1,800 rural community hospitals are among the most vulnerable to dangerous ransomware attacks because they often lack IT security resources and cybersecurity-trained staff. And they may be the only hospitals within dozens of miles, meaning a ransomware attack that prevents a hospital from accepting ambulances can put patients\u2019 lives at risk. The new announcement is\u00a0the result of private discussions between the tech firms and officials at the White House National Security Council who have growing increasingly concerned about cyber threats to hospitals. It\u2019s an effort to use the broad reach of Microsoft and Google\u2019s software, which is used in hospitals across the United States, to help plug a gap in the defense of the health care sector. \u201cWe\u2019re in new territory as we see \u2026 this wave of attacks against hospitals,\u201d Anne Neuberger, the top cyber official at the White House National Security Council, told reporters on Sunday. The Biden administration is also preparing to issue minimum cybersecurity requirements for US hospitals. The details of that proposal have yet to be finalized. But the American Hospital Association, which represents hospitals across the United States, opposes the proposal, saying it would impose penalties on the victims of cyberattacks after they are hacked. A growing problem The number of ransomware attacks against the US healthcare sector increased by 128% in 2023 compared to 2022,\u00a0according to data\u00a0released by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. And recent ransomware attacks have brought the sector\u2019s vulnerability into sharp relief. A February ransomware attack on a major health insurance billing firm\u00a0cut off health providers\u00a0from billions of dollars and put some health clinics on the brink of bankruptcy. UnitedHealth Group, whose subsidiary was hacked, paid a $22 million ransom to the hackers to try to recover patient data. One third of Americans may have had their data stolen. Another ransomware attack, in May, on one of America\u2019s largest hospital chains,\u00a0put patients\u2019 lives in danger\u00a0as nurses were forced to manually enter prescription information, multiple nurses at affected hospitals told CNN. The FBI and its international allies have conducted a series of crackdowns on ransomware gangs, seizing the computers they use and unlocking some of the victim computers that hackers have encrypted. But ransomware remains a flourishing business, in part, US officials say, because many of its perpetrators operate with impunity from Russia. The health care sector is a particularly enticing target because hospitals under duress to restore patient services\u00a0are sometimes willing\u00a0to pay the ransom. \u201cWe do see a much more permissive environment in Russia by both hacktivists and criminals, and it\u2019s of concern,\u201d Neuberger, the White House official, told reporters. \u201cWe also see more and more companies paying ransoms. And every ransom payment feeds the beast and drives further attacks.\u201d Cleveland cyberattack shuts City Hall Cyberattacks have frequently shut down other vulnerable services. The\u00a0City of Cleveland is\u00a0investigating a cyber incident, according to a statement from mayor Justin\u00a0Bibb. As a precaution, the city said it closed City Hall Monday, and it will keep City Hall closed Tuesday. Cleveland also shut down all of its internal systems and software. But city and emergency services like the Department of Public Safety, 911, police, the fire department, ambulances and the Department of Public Utilities, will remain operational, Bibb\u2019s office said. However, the mayor said the emergency services are functioning with limited IT capabilities. \u201cOver the weekend, the city identified some abnormalities,\u201d Commissioner Kimberly\u00a0Roy-Wilson, with the city\u2019s Division of Information Technology Services, said. \u201cWe have moved into our protocols and procedures with regards to containment and we are now investigating the nature and scope of those abnormalities.\u201d Bibb would not say how many or which agencies are helping with the investigation.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/10/tech/hospital-cyberattack-google-microsoft/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "us"}}

The handcuffs were removed. The person fell to the sidewalk, clearly experiencing a mental health crisis, as well as physical injuries and the officers of the Burbank Police Department got back in their vehicle and drove back to Burbank, without giving any aid to this person, without determining whether there was anyone who could provide services to this person.\u201d As seen in the surveillance video played at the news conference, two officers escort the man out of the back seat of their vehicle and remove apparent hand restraints. Walking away from the vehicle, the man appears to lose balance, waves his arms, and falls to the sidewalk on all fours. The police vehicle departs as the man later lies flat on his stomach. The video ends and it is unclear for how long he remained on the sidewalk. Krekorian said he introduced a motion on Friday, calling on the Los Angeles City Attorney, County\u00a0District Attorney, and the Attorney General of California to investigate the matter and to \u201cascertain what appropriate legal actions should be taken.\u201d Burbank Mayor Nick Schultz in a\u00a0post on X\u00a0Friday assured that the \u201cCity of Burbank takes the concerns raised by Los Angeles City Councilmember Paul Krekorian seriously,\u201d saying the city was \u201cgathering all of the facts.\u201d The Burbank Police Department then issued a\u00a0statement, saying it was aware of a video showing Burbank police officers dropping off the individual on the sidewalk in North Hollywood. According to the police department, they had initially responded to a call for service Thursday around 8:45 a.m., regarding a naked person sitting at a bus stop just outside Providence Saint Joseph Medical Center in Burbank. Responding officers found him \u201clucid and communicative,\u201d and the man got dressed after a conversation with the officers, the statement said. Police said the man told them he was homeless and had been transported from the Sunland-Tujunga neighborhood in Los Angeles\u00a0to the hospital for a leg injury he had suffered \u201cmany years ago.\u201d According to police, the man had left the hospital voluntarily prior to the officers\u2019 arrival and had declined any medical attention. Burbank Police said officers then offered to drive the man \u201cto a place of his choosing,\u201d and he asked to be taken to Sunland-Tujunga, but \u201cultimately agreed to be transported to the Metro Red Line in North Hollywood.\u201d \u201cHe voluntarily got into the patrol vehicle and was driven towards the Metro Red Line station. Along the way, the individual asked to be let out of the patrol vehicle to get coffee. The officers complied immediately with his request,\u00a0pulled over, and let the individual out of the patrol vehicle,\u201d the statement continued. In a statement to CNN Saturday, Providence Saint Joseph Medical Center said they are aware of Thursday morning\u2019s incident and says that \u201cmultiple calls\u201d were made to police, including one from a hospital security guard, regarding a person apparently in distress on a public sidewalk. \u201cI was outraged by it and continue to be,\u201d Krekorian said at his news conference on Friday. \u201cIt\u2019s almost impossible to fathom, you know, professionals who are trained and paid to protect and serve the public - to take somebody at this moment of maximum vulnerability, somebody seeking medical care - and dumping, literally dumping, him on a sidewalk to fend for himself. It\u2019s a disgrace.\u201d According to the council member, after being made aware of the surveillance video, his staff drove around trying to find the man, whom Krekorian did not identify, located him around 3 p.m., and were able to secure medical care for him through the Los Angeles Fire Department. \u201cIt\u2019s\u00a0been widely assumed by many, and we hear anecdotally, that some of our surrounding cities and\u00a0jurisdictions, who don\u2019t spend their resources on providing services, who don\u2019t build shelters for their unhoused residents, who don\u2019t invest in permanent supportive housing, who don\u2019t do the basic human things necessary to address homelessness, are instead pushing their unhoused population into the city of Los Angeles,\u201d Krekorian claimed. \u201cWe know it happens, and it\u2019s just rare that we actually get to see it with our own eyes like we can in this video.\u201d \u201cI would submit that if you see it happening like this on a random security camera, chances are it\u2019s happening a lot more often,\u201d he added. The Burbank Police Department said it is currently conducting an \u201cin-depth investigation\u201d into the incident, including the actions of the involved police officers. The investigation will include a review of all available body-worn and\u00a0in-car camera footage, interviews with witnesses, and any other relevant evidence, according to the department. \u201cThe Burbank Police Department remains committed to treating the unhoused community with compassion and respect, and thanks Los Angeles City Council President Paul Krekorian for bringing this matter to our attention,\u201d their statement said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/08/us/los-angeles-burbank-homeless-person-abandoned/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "us"}}

On the morning his trial was set to begin in Manhattan Monday, Felix Herrera Garcia, 35, pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to distribute narcotics resulting in death and serious bodily injury, one count of possession with intent to distribute narcotics resulting in death and one count of possession with intent to distribute narcotics resulting in serious bodily injury, according to a statement from the US Attorney\u2019s Office of the Southern District of New York. All three counts carry a mandatory minimum sentence of 20 years in prison, with a maximum sentence of life in prison, prosecutors said. Herrera Garcia is the husband of Grei Mendez, the owner and operator of the day care, court documents showed. He\u00a0was captured by authorities in Mexico\u00a011 days after the incident. The charges stemmed from the death of Nicholas Dominici, 1, in 2023 after he and three others were exposed to suspected opioids at the Divino Ni\u00f1o day care in the Bronx. \u201cHerrera Garcia has now been held accountable in the tragic loss of little Nicholas, the serious injury of Abel, and the harm to Kiara and Jaziel,\u201d Bronx District Attorney Darcel Clark said in a statement Monday. About two weeks ago,\u00a0a co-conspirator, Renny Antonio Parra Paredes, 38, pleaded guilty to conspiring to distribute narcotics and stipulated his conduct caused death and serious bodily injury \u201cin connection with his role in the poisonings,\u201d prosecutors said. His guilty plea carries a mandatory minimum sentence of 20 years in prison, with a maximum sentence of life in prison. Paredes has \u201caccepted responsibility for his offense\u201d and \u201cexpressed his sadness and remorse for the harm to the children that he was a part of causing,\u201d Paredes\u2019 attorney John Kaley told CNN. \u201cHe also offered his most sincere apology to the families affected by the presence of drugs at the Daycare facility for what had occurred to their children.\u201d Mendez, the owner of the day care, and another defendant, Carlisto Acevedo Brito, are also facing federal charges in relation to the case. The US attorney\u2019s office told CNN Monday their cases are still pending. Mendez and Brito are also both facing\u00a0state murder charges\u00a0in connection to the infant\u2019s death, according to the Bronx DA\u2019s office. According to court documents, Brito is Herrera Garcia\u2019s cousin and a tenant who resided in a bedroom within the day care.

{"id": "2024_06_08_us_rust-shooting-timeline-alec-baldwin", "text": "The actor Alec Baldwin and several crew members gathered in a church at a New Mexico ranch on October 21, 2021, to rehearse a scene from their upcoming Western film \u201cRust.\u201d Then came the unexpected gunshot. A promising cinematographer was killed, a director was wounded and a film production was left in shambles. Since that day\u2019s fatal shooting of 42-year-old Halyna Hutchins, the film\u2019s armorer and its assistant director have been convicted of criminal charges. And after some back-and-forth legal arguments, Baldwin soon is set to stand trial on charges of involuntary manslaughter. The details of what happened that day have been made public in affidavits, probable cause statements, interviews with the main participants and testimony at criminal trials. Here\u2019s a timeline of the on-set shooting and the resulting legal cases. The shooting May 29, 2020: Baldwin, the three-time Emmy winner for his roles on \u201c30 Rock\u201d and \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d was announced as producer and star of the Western feature film \u201cRust,\u201d based on a story by Baldwin and Joel Souza, Deadline reported. In the film, Baldwin plays a grizzled outlaw on the run from authorities with his 13-year-old grandson. October 6, 2021: Filming of \u201cRust\u201d began at Bonanza Creek Ranch, a movie set outside Santa Fe, New Mexico. October 20, 2021: Several crew members walked off set, citing safety concerns. One crew member stated there had been two accidental weapons discharges and a special effects mess-up that set off explosives around the crew between takes. October 21, 2021: Hannah Gutierrez Reed, the armorer for \u201cRust,\u201d loaded a prop six-shot revolver with what she believed were \u201cdummy\u201d rounds, a term for ammo that contains no explosive elements but appear to be real, according to investigators and her defense attorney. Baldwin and several crew members began rehearsing a scene in a rustic church on set before breaking for lunch. After the break, Baldwin, Souza, Hutchins and a few others returned to the church for rehearsal. Assistant director Dave Halls fetched a prop gun from a cart outside the church and yelled \u201ccold gun,\u201d indicating it was unloaded. He then handed the gun to Baldwin. Baldwin practiced a \u201ccross draw\u201d \u2013 pulling a gun from a holster on the opposite side of his body from his draw hand. The scene required him to point the gun toward the camera, helmed by Hutchins, Souza and a camera operator. Suddenly, they heard a loud bang. Hutchins stumbled backward, slumped to the floor clutching her stomach and said she couldn\u2019t feel her legs. Souza, who had been standing beside her, noticed blood on his shoulder. At 1:48 p.m., the crew reported the shooting to emergency responders. Hutchins was transported by air helicopter to the hospital and was pronounced dead at 3:37 p.m. Souza was treated at the hospital, and a projectile from a live round was removed from his back. Sheriff\u2019s deputies arrived to the scene and began investigating the series of events leading to the shooting. October 22, 2021: Baldwin released a statement calling the death a \u201ctragic accident\u201d and said he is fully cooperating with the police investigation. December 2, 2021: In an interview with ABC, Baldwin said he cocked the gun and let go of the hammer, and the gun then fired. He said he was aiming the gun just to the side of the camera toward Hutchins, as she instructed him to do. \u201cI would never point a gun at anyone and then pull the trigger, never,\u201d he said. The investigations August 14, 2022: FBI testing of the firearm found it could not be fired without pulling the trigger while the gun was cocked, according to a forensics report. The report noted the gun eventually malfunctioned during FBI testing after internal parts fractured, causing the gun to go off in the cocked position without pulling the trigger. August 20, 2022: In an interview with CNN, Baldwin\u00a0placed responsibility\u00a0for Hutchins\u2019 death on Gutierrez Reed, the film armorer and props assistant, and on assistant director Halls, who handed him the gun. October 5, 2022: The family of Hutchins and Baldwin reached an undisclosed settlement in a wrongful death lawsuit filed against the actor and others. As part of the settlement, Matthew Hutchins, the cinematographer\u2019s widower, was named an executive producer on \u201cRust.\u201d January 19, 2023: Prosecutors announced Baldwin and Gutierrez Reed will be charged with involuntary manslaughter in Hutchins\u2019 death. Halls, the assistant director, agreed to plead no contest to negligent use of a deadly weapon, the district attorney\u2019s office announced. The terms of that deal include six months of probation\u00a0and a suspended sentence, prosecutors said. January 31, 2023: Baldwin and Gutierrez Reed were formally charged with involuntary manslaughter. February 23, 2023: Baldwin pleaded not guilty to manslaughter charges and was released on personal recognizance. April 20, 2023: New Mexico special prosecutors dismissed the charges against Baldwin, citing \u201cnew facts\u201d in the case. \u201cThis decision does not absolve Mr. Baldwin of criminal culpability and charges may be refiled,\u201d they said. August 9, 2023: Gutierrez Reed pleaded not guilty to involuntary manslaughter and tampering with evidence. January 19: Baldwin was indicted by a grand jury on charges of involuntary manslaughter. January 31: Baldwin pleaded not guilty to involuntary manslaughter charges for the second time. February 22: The trial of film armorer Gutierrez Reed began. Prosecutors alleged her failures allowed six live bullets to make their way on set, and she did not make vital safety checks that would have caught the problem. Her defense blamed Baldwin for failing to follow common-sense gun safety rules and on the film\u2019s production team for creating a chaotic and unsafe environment. March 1: Souza, the director and screenwriter, testified about the moment he was shot on set while standing behind Hutchins. March 6: Gutierrez Reed was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter after jurors deliberated for nearly three hours. She was acquitted of a charge of evidence tampering. April 15: At her sentencing hearing, Gutierrez Reed said \u201cmy heart aches\u201d for Hutchins\u2019 family and friends, and she asked the judge to sentence her to probation. The judge criticized her statement and sentenced her to the maximum 18 months in prison, saying, \u201cYou alone turned a safe weapon into a lethal weapon.\u201d May 24: A New Mexico judge denied Baldwin\u2019s motion to dismiss the involuntary manslaughter indictment. Baldwin\u2019s attorneys had accused prosecutors of misconduct during the grand jury process. June 3: New Mexico prosecutors asked the court to grant use immunity to Gutierrez Reed and compel her to testify at Baldwin\u2019s trial, according to court documents. Gutierrez Reed invoked her Fifth Amendment right to silence in a pre-trial interview, and prosecutors said if she is not granted immunity then she would not be able to testify in the trial. Gutierrez Reed\u2019s attorney, Jason Bowles, told CNN he will oppose the motion.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/08/us/rust-shooting-timeline-alec-baldwin/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_08_us_harvey-weinstein-appeal-los-angeles-sexual-assault-conviction", "text": "Just over a month after his conviction was overturned in New York, attorneys for disgraced movie mogul Harvey Weinstein filed an appeal\u00a0Friday to overturn\u00a0his Los Angeles conviction from December 2022, when he was found guilty on three sexual assault charges and sentenced to 16 years in prison. Weinstein was convicted on charges of rape, sexual penetration by a foreign object and forcible oral copulation associated with Jane Doe 1, one of four women who testified in the trial. Weinstein\u2019s attorneys are now seeking a new trial, according to court documents filed in California\u2019s Second District Court of Appeal. The appeal filing says Weinstein did not receive a fair trial because evidence was excluded regarding the whereabouts of Jane Doe 1 on the\u00a0date\u00a0of the alleged assault, prosecutors didn\u2019t disclose a romantic affair\u00a0Jane Doe 1\u00a0was in at the time of the\u00a0incident, and uncharged alleged criminal assaults by Weinstein were included in evidence. \u201cDefendant\u2019s trial was a free-for-all where the prosecution offered evidence of a dozen uncharged sex crimes and other \u2018offenses\u2019 related to the \u2018mistreatment\u2019 of women,\u201d the filing says. \u201cBut the jury was misguided about what they could do with the highly prejudicial information. The jury was sent to deliberate with a match and barrel of explosive evidence.\u201d Dave Ring, an attorney representing Jane Doe 1, said in a statement to CNN, \u201cWeinstein\u2018s appeal makes the same tired arguments that he previously made multiple times, without success, to the trial court.\u00a0We are of the strong opinion that the trial court vetted the evidence appropriately and made all the correct decisions in its evidentiary rulings. We are confident that Weinstein\u2019s appeal will be denied and he will spend many years in prison.\u201d Prosecutors in the Los Angeles trial said Weinstein was a powerful figure in Hollywood who used his influence to lure women into private meetings, assault them and then silence any accusations. CNN has reached out to the Los Angeles County District Attorney\u2019s office for comment on the appeal. The appeal comes after Weinstein\u2019s 2020 rape conviction in New York was overturned in April by a New York Appeals court. The court ruled the testimony of \u201cprior bad acts\u201d witnesses should not have been allowed because it \u201cwas unnecessary to establish defendant\u2019s intent and served only to establish defendant\u2019s propensity to commit the crimes charged.\u201d The ruling sent shockwaves through communities of sexual assault survivors, particularly the more than 100 women who have accused Weinstein of assault and harassment. A new trial was ordered and\u00a0prosecutors in Manhattan say they plan to retry him. Ahead of retrial, additional accusers have come forward with claims against the Hollywood producer. \u201cWe will do everything in our power to retry this case, and remain steadfast in our commitment to survivors of sexual assault,\u201d\u00a0said Emily Tuttle, deputy director of communications and senior advisor\u00a0for the Manhattan District Attorney\u2019s Office. Weinstein\u2019s attorneys argued\u00a0in the Los Angeles appeal that prosecutors brought up his New York conviction during jury selection and violated his right to a fair and impartial trial. \u201cDefendant is entitled to a new trial where his constitutional rights are safeguarded, where he is permitted to present evidence of his innocence, and where his conduct is on trial - not his character,\u201d the filing says.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/08/us/harvey-weinstein-appeal-los-angeles-sexual-assault-conviction/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_09_us_rex-heuermann-gilgo-beach-murders-document", "text": "An architect by trade, Gilgo Beach killings suspect\u00a0Rex Heuermann allegedly kept a chilling \u201cplanning document\u201d to \u201cmethodically blueprint\u201d \u2013 in the words of prosecutors \u2013 how to select, kill and dispose of his victims. Investigators recovered the Word document Heuermann allegedly created in 2000 and modified over several years on a hard drive in the basement of his suburban New York home, where he lived with his wife and children. In capital letters, the file outlined the \u201cpackaging\u201d of bodies for transport, steps to avoid apprehension and the removal of trace DNA evidence, according to a bail application released Thursday, when Long Island prosecutors brought charges against Heuermann in two additional killings. \u201cHis being an architect is totally consistent with the hyper attention to detail that is manifested in his murders,\u201d criminologist and author Scott Bonn told CNN via email. He now faces charges in the deaths of six women across three decades and multiple communities. On the day Heuermann pleaded not guilty to the latest charges of second-degree murder in the 2003 death of Jessica Taylor and the 1993 death of Sandra Costilla, prosecutors revealed the content of the manual they said he used to \u201cplan out his kills\u201d with scrupulous and fanatical attention to detail. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen a written document such as this,\u201d Suffolk County District Attorney Raymond Tierney told CNN. The manual contained headings such as \u201cSupplies\u201d and \u201cProblems,\u201d with \u201cDNA\u201d listed as the top item under the latter. The DNA evidence \u2013 and \u201cblueprint\u201d document \u2013 will underpin the case against him at his eventual trial. \u201cThe fact that he tried to get rid of these documents and that they were still found on the computer memory is really going to be \u2013 in connection with the DNA \u2013 a kind of nail in the coffin,\u201d said Casey Jordan, a criminologist, behavioral analyst and attorney. \u201cThese two things combined are going to be very difficult for the defense to overcome.\u201d A section titled \u201cbody prep\u201d detailed steps to clean, dismember and move bodies, while another called \u201cpost event\u201d appeared to list tasks to avoid apprehension, including having a story set, according to the bail application. Details of the content of the document come from the latest bail application from prosecutors. CNN has not seen the document independently for verification. \u201cThe thing about his blueprint for murder that stood out to me immediately is his need to document his killings which demonstrates his grandiosity and desire to bask in the glory of his work,\u201d said Bonn, author of \u201cWhy we love serial killers: The curious appeal of the world\u2019s most savage murderers.\u201d \u201cHeuermann\u2019s egotistical documentation of his work definitely led to his undoing and also strengthened the case against him.\u201d \u2018Self-education and homework\u2019 on killing Heuermann was arrested in July 2023 near his midtown Manhattan office and eventually charged with the murders of three women, whose bodies were discovered bound with belts or tape and wrapped in burlap along a stretch of Long Island\u2019s Gilgo Beach in 2010. He was later charged in January 2024 in the death of a fourth woman. Those victims \u2013 Melissa Barthelemy, Megan Waterman, Amber Costello and Maureen Brainard-Barnes \u2013 became known as the \u201cGilgo Four.\u201d Heuermann pleaded not guilty to the charges related to all four. A big break in the case came in January 2023 when investigators took a swab from leftover pizza crust Heuermann discarded in the trash outside his Manhattan office, according to court documents. DNA evidence initially linked him to a hair found on the burlap sack where Waterman\u2019s remains were found. \u201cI think the key evidence is DNA,\u201d Tierney told CNN Friday. Forensic testing performed on strands of hair on or near both Taylor and Costilla\u2019s remains found 99.96% of the North American population could be excluded as the source of the hairs \u2013\u00a0but Heuermann could not. The latest bail application said two forensic laboratories determined hairs recovered on five of the six victims were tied to Heuermann, members of his immediate family or people who lived with him. \u201cDefendant Heuermann is the individual who murdered, stripped, restrained, and transported the remains of Jessica Taylor and Sandra Costilla, as well as the Gilgo Four, until they were each discovered in 1993, 2003, 2010, and 2011,\u201d according to a new bail application released Thursday. The 60-year-old architect was surprised by the latest charges, Heuermann attorney Michael Brown said after the defendant appeared in an eastern Long Island courtroom. Heuermann was remanded without bail and is expected in court July 30. \u201cOne murder is obviously horrific, and it\u2019s a difficult thing to defend,\u201d said Brown. \u201cAnd now we\u2019re at six.\u201d Brown told reporters Thursday he needed more time to review new evidence before commenting further. In January, Brown told reporters his client claimed he is \u201cnot guilty of these charges\u201d and looked forward to fighting the charges in court. The \u201cblueprint\u201d document was discovered after investigators mined more than 350 electronic devices seized from Heuermann\u2019s home, according to Tierney. \u201cIt had been erased and we used forensic tools to recover it,\u201d the district attorney said. The bail application said the Gilgo Homicide Task Force \u201cbelieve that the totality of circumstances surrounding the \u2026 Planning Document, including Heuermann\u2019s attempt to delete its existence, points to it as Heuermann\u2019s self-education and \u2018homework\u2019 on the topic of carrying out serial, sexual murder.\u201d Tierney added, \u201cHis intent was specifically to locate these victims, hunt them down to bring them under his control and to kill them \u2026 His intent was nothing short but to murder these victims.\u201d \u2018Thing to remember\u2019 list of lessons learned The \u201cblueprint\u201d document included a \u201cpre-prep\u201d section on steps to take before a killing, such as checking an area for surveillance cameras. A \u201cprep\u201d section appeared to outline what needed to be done closer to the time of the homicides, such as building a table with a \u201ccross bar\u201d underneath to support heavier objects, according to the bail application. \u201cThis really kind of lays out for us how these women may have died,\u201d Jordan said. A \u201cpost event\u201d section in the document listed ways to avoid detection by changing car tires and creating an alibi or story in case of an inquiry. The document is riddled with typos and misspellings. It also had sections about sites for the disposal of physical evidence. There were notes on removing tattoos and other identifying marks. The bail application said a tattoo on Taylor\u2019s torso had been mutilated with a sharp object. A \u201cthings to remember\u201d section appeared to show lessons learned from previous killings. It recommended the use of heavier rope since lighter types \u201cbroke under the stress of being tightend,\u201d the bail application said. \u201cHeuermann falls into a category\u00a0of serial killer known as a power/control killer,\u201d said Bonn, who has closely examined the lives of serial killers such as Dennis Rader, known as BTK for his preferred \u201cbind, torture, kill\u201d method. \u201cThey are psychopathic and obsessed with detail and planning; covering all contingencies.\u201d Bonn noted similarities between the alleged Gilgo Beach killer and BTK, who was a churchgoer, Cub Scout leader and married father of two before advancements in science and technology ultimately led to his arrest in February 2005. Rader was fastidious in the way\u00a0he approached his killings and kept meticulous records of his fantasies and crimes in folders and binders. Rader pleaded guilty to 10 murders and was sentenced in 2005 to 10 consecutive life terms. Tierney, the Suffolk County district attorney, said the investigation is far from over and Heuermann could be tied to other killings. \u201cWe\u2019re going to continue. We\u2019re not going to stop,\u201d he said. Said Jordan, the criminologist and behavioral analyst: \u201cThere could be more murders out there \u2026 We may never know the answer to that and they may never be charged.\u201d CNN\u2019s Mark Morales, Brynn Gingras,\u00a0Carolyn Sung and Samantha Beech contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/09/us/rex-heuermann-gilgo-beach-murders-document/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "us"}}

Mark Walztoni tells CNN his 17-year-old daughter Cobalt Sovereign, a junior at Hopkins High School in Minnetonka, was in the school bathroom last\u00a0Thursday\u00a0when\u00a0a student started calling her\u00a0transphobic slurs. While she was leaving the bathroom, Walztoni says his daughter\u00a0said\u00a0she was surrounded by\u00a0that student and two others, who began following Sovereign down the hall, and when she turned around to ask them to stop, she was\u00a0punched in the mouth. During the attack, according to Walztoni, Sovereign\u2019s jaw was broken in two places. She had a compound fracture and lost teeth, leading to reconstructive surgery. Walztoni says the students\u00a0responsible\u00a0should face criminal charges. \u201cThere has to be repercussions for their actions. And if they are not charged for some reason, which is our fear, then that is just going to further escalate their behavior because when you get away with stuff, you continue to do stuff,\u201d he said. \u201cThere needs to be some kind of punishment and there needs to be some serious discussion as to whether those kids should be able to come back to the same school.\u201d He also says\u00a0he\u00a0was notified about the incident from a social worker at the school and was told by school officials to notify the police, adding he was displeased the incident \u201cwasn\u2019t treated as an emergency.\u201d Walztoni also tells CNN he is unsure if his daughter will be safe going back to school and wants to see changes. \u201cIt\u2019s unacceptable. The whole transphobia and homophobia thing is, in my opinion, so 20th century, or it should be a thing of the past. And it\u2019s clear that the climate is getting worse in this regard,\u201d he told CNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins on \u201cThe Source.\u201d \u201cWe have a tremendous amount of community support here and Cobalt feeling very loved but it\u2019s you know it\u2019s the kids that are there today aren\u2019t safe.\u201d Sovereign tells CNN she has never met or seen the students who attacked and harassed her prior to the incident. She said she has faced harassment in the past but \u201cnothing even close to this extent\u201d. Sovereign also said using the restroom as someone who identifies as non-binary has always been an issue for her. \u201cI try to use any general neutral or family restroom options if they\u2019re available but when I\u2019m not given that option I \u2026 use the men\u2019s restroom because it\u2019s what makes everybody around me the least amount of uncomfortable and making other people uncomfortable is something that I tried not to do. It\u2019s from one of my worst fears,\u201d Sovereign told Collins. The Minnetonka Police Department said in a statement to CNN\u00a0it is investigating an\u00a0attack\u00a0that day at Hopkins High School as \u201ca possible hate\u00a0crime,\u201d but said \u201cdetails remain limited as the case was reported to police after school had ended for the day.\u201d\u00a0Hopkins High School\u00a0said it is investigating \u201can act of violence\u201d\u00a0that \u201cinvolved a student who identifies as part of the LGBTQ+ community.\u201d  \u201cWe will address any issues that compromise the safety and inclusivity of our school environment,\u201d the school told CNN in a statement. \u201cWe support and stand by any group that is marginalized, including our LGBTQ+ scholars and staff.\u201d Minnetonka Police Chief Scott Boerboom tells CNN Sovereign\u2019s mother reported the incident to the police department\u00a0the day it happened\u00a0and he was not made aware of it until the following Monday. Boerboom says he would have preferred the school notify the police as soon as the incident occurred. \u201cWe would arrive at the school, we would meet with the victim, Cobalt, we would talk to the suspects, identify the suspects, get their side of the story, talk to the victim. And then we are required to notify parents at that time,\u201d he said. \u201cBy having us contacted at the onset, we can assess it as first responders and we have access to EMS or medical services.\u201d Boerboom also says a video of the assault exists, and he has seen it. He says his department filed a subpoena for the video from the school, in line with policy. In the video, he says, one boy is seen assaulting Sovereign in the hallway. There were two other boys nearby, Boerboom says, who were not involved in the physical assault. The\u00a0attack comes amid a rise in\u00a0anti-LGBTQ\u00a0legislation\u00a0and as advocates say LGBTQ students have faced an uptick in threats and violence. It also comes nearly four months after the\u00a0death of Nex Benedict, a nonbinary\u00a010th grader in Oklahoma who told\u00a0police about being beaten to the point of blacking out during a confrontation in the school bathroom.\u00a0 Melanie Willingham-Jaggers, executive director of GLSEN, a non-profit\u00a0group working to end intolerance and homophobia in\u00a0K-12\u00a0schools, said the\u00a0attack is \u201ca heartbreaking reminder of the violence and discrimination that trans youth face daily.\u201d \u201cGLSEN\u00a0stands in solidarity with Cobalt and their family, and we call on their school officials to take immediate, concrete steps to ensure the safety and dignity of all students,\u201d Willingham-Jaggers told CNN in a statement. \u201cHate has no place in our schools, and it\u2019s our collective responsibility to create systems where every student can thrive without fear.\u201d Minnesota state Rep. Leigh Finke, a Democrat and the first\u00a0out\u00a0transgender lawmaker in the state\u2019s legislature, condemned the school and police\u00a0for their\u00a0responses\u00a0to the incident. Finke said violence\u00a0against transgender youth like Benedict and Sovereign will \u201ccontinue unabated until accountability and responsibility is accepted.\u201d \u201cThe response of Hopkins High School and the Minnetonka Police so far sends the same transphobic message to\u00a0(\u2026)\u00a0the world: do as you will and if no one decides to take it public, you\u2019ll get away with it. Is that the message that we want to send?\u201d Finke said in a statement. \u201cWe want to see Hopkins High School and Minnetonka Police, and every school and police department in the future to do what is right and take immediate action, not because people are looking, but because transgender folks everywhere are entitled to live a life free of fear, and violence,\u201d Finke added.

{"id": "2024_06_08_us_oregon-hoodwinker-sunfish-gearhart-beach-trnd", "text": "A rare 7.3-foot hoodwinker sunfish washed ashore on the Oregon coast earlier this week, the Seaside Aquarium said. The massive aquatic species was found north of Seaside in northwestern Oregon along Gearhart Beach on June 3. A buzz on social media led to curious people \u201cflocking to the beach to see this unusual fish\u201d, according to the aquarium. In photos shared by the aquarium, the giant odd-looking fish shaped like a bloated silver dollar appeared to be lying on its side in the sand with its mouth open. The fish was initially believed only to occupy the Southern Hemisphere\u2019s temperate waters, but \u201cthat theory would be challenged as a few have recently washed ashore in California and one as far north as Alaska,\u201d according to Seaside Aquarium. The aquarium said the news of the fish reached New Zealand-based researcher Mariann Nyegaard, who said images indicated this was not just any typical ocean, or Mola mola, sunfish. Nyegaard recognized the species that washed up on Oregon\u2019s coast as the hoodwinker sunfish, or Mola tecta. The researcher previously discovered the new sunfish species through her research and described the unique finding in a 2017 published paper. \u201cThis fish, hiding in plain sight, has most likely been seen/washed ashore in the Pacific Northwest before but was mistaken for the more common Mola mola,\u201d according to the aquarium. Nyegaard contacted the aquarium to request genetic samples of the fish and the aquarium took additional images and measurements, which led to the conclusion \u201cthat this may be the largest specimen ever sampled.\u201d The sea creature remains on the beach as of Saturday, the aquarium confirmed to CNN in an email. It \u201cwill probably remain for a few more days, maybe weeks as their tough skin makes it hard for scavengers to puncture,\u201d the aquarium said on Facebook. CNN\u2019s Ashley R. Williams contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/08/us/oregon-hoodwinker-sunfish-gearhart-beach-trnd/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "us"}}
