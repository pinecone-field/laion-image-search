Davy and Natalie Lloyd \u201cwere attacked by gangs this evening and were both killed,\u201d\u00a0Natalie Lloyd\u2019s father, Missouri state Rep. Ben Baker, said in a Facebook post. \u201cThey went to Heaven together.\u201d Mission director Jude Montis, 45, was also killed. All three worked for Missions in Haiti, Inc., which has been operated by Davy Lloyd\u2019s parents for more than\u00a0two decades, according to\u00a0the group\u2019s website. Davy Lloyd, 23, had a \u201clove for Haiti,\u201d his father David Lloyd told CNN. \u201cHis first language was Creole. He used to tell us when he was little that someday he was going to be a missionary in Haiti.\u201d He and Natalie Lloyd, 21, were ambushed as they left church in Port-au-Prince on Thursday evening, according to David Lloyd. \u201cDavy was taken to the house tied up and beat. The gang then took our trucks and loaded everything up they wanted and left,\u201d a post on Missions in Haiti\u2019s\u00a0Facebook page said. Three hours later, the organization\u00a0posted\u00a0that the three missionaries \u201cwere shot and killed by the gang about 9 o\u2019clock this evening. We all are\u00a0devastated.\u201d \u201cPlease pray for my family we desperately need strength. And please pray for the Lloyd family as well,\u201d Baker said on social media early Friday. \u201cI have no other words for now.\u201d Local emergency response service Haitian Emergency Response Operations (HERO) assisted in coordinating and managing the operation to retrieve the bodies and transport the remains of the American couple to a hospital morgue. \u2018Our last call\u2019 David Lloyd told CNN that he was on the phone with his son during the attacks. The mission and church across the street have two security guards, but when the 23-year-old came out of the church around 6 p.m., \u201cthree pick-up trucks full of guys with guns overwhelmed them immediately,\u201d he said. The armed men dragged Davy Lloyd to the house, tied him up, and started looting the compound, according to his father, who said children from the orphanage were in the compound at the time. After the gang left with its haul, Davy Lloyd called his father. \u201cHe was injured, and he was hurt. He was nervous, and very very scared,\u201d David Lloyd said. \u201cHe was begging me to find someone to get in there and help him, and I did all I could but I couldn\u2019t locate anybody.\u201d Then more armed men arrived, he said. \u201cHe told me, \u2018I have to go down, something else is going down. I gotta go see what it is,\u2019\u201d David Lloyd recalled. \u201cThat was basically our last call.\u201d Around that time, someone shot one of the newly arrived gang members, sparking a violent backlash, he said. \u201cDavy went in and barricaded himself in my personal home with his wife and (mission director) Jude Montis. The gang shot that place up until they got the door busted down and shot them, and set Davy and Jude on fire.\u201d HERO, the ambulance service, confirmed to CNN that Davy Lloyd\u2019s body was found burned at the scene. Haitian police will work with international law enforcement to investigate the killings, police spokesperson Gary Desrosiers told CNN on Friday. \u201cThis is an open investigation but we are sure we will arrest those involved. For now, we\u2019re working on protecting the public and the community while actively searching for the perpetrators,\u201d he said. On Missions in Haiti\u2019s website, Davy Lloyd can be seen talking about growing up in the Caribbean nation and doing manual labor on the mission compound. He previously survived a kidnapping in Port-au-Prince in 2005, when he was just 5 years old, his father said. According to a report that year by the Tulsa World newspaper, Davy Lloyd, his sister and foster sister were abducted in a carjacking on their way home from school. But police were able to locate the kidnappers, rescue the children and quickly return them to their parents, according to the report. \u201cWe got them back 21 hours later,\u201d David Lloyd recalled. \u2018The security situation in Haiti cannot wait\u2019 In a statement to CNN Friday, the White House said it was aware of the reports and expressed condolences while urging for the expedited deployment of UN Security Council-approved international police force to the region. \u201cWe are aware of the reports of the deaths of U.S. citizens in Haiti.\u00a0Our hearts go out to the families of those killed as they experience unimaginable grief,\u201d a national security spokesperson told CNN. \u201cThe security situation in Haiti cannot wait. That is why yesterday, President Biden reiterated our commitment to support the expedited the deployment of the Multinational Security Support (MSS) Mission to bolster the Haitian National Police\u2019s capabilities to protect civilians, restore the rule of law, and pave the way to democratic governance.\u201d Missouri Republican Gov. Mike Parson also mourned the couple\u2019s loss on X Friday morning, calling it \u201cabsolutely heartbreaking news.\u201d Until now, the area around the Missions in Haiti compound had felt largely safe despite the violence in the rest of the city, according to David Lloyd, who was in the country until a few days ago. \u201cWe haven\u2019t really heard any gunshots in any of this. Our school\u2019s been open, the church has been functioning, the bakery\u2019s been selling bread every day,\u201d he said. When flights resumed last week to Port-au-Prince\u2019s Toussaint Louverture International Airport, Lloyd said he asked his son and daughter-in-law if they would like to leave Haiti, but they declined. \u201cWe know Haiti is a very volatile situation, we know that it\u2019s dangerous,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we had a good rapport with the groups in our area, and they\u2019d left us alone. But from what I understand this was an outside group that came in initially from about a mile away, that started it all.\u201d He believes the initial gang attack was just intended as a robbery, with the gangs trying to take what they can before the UN\u2019s Multinational Security Support mission arrives. \u201cWe have a pretty large mission compound, lots of stuff. With the international military force that\u2019s supposed to be coming in any day, I think the gangs are trying to get all they can get because they realize their times may be coming to an end,\u201d he said. In a joint news conference with Kenyan President William Ruto on Thursday, Biden defended the decision not to deploy US troops to Haiti, telling reporters doing so\u00a0could raise \u201call kinds of questions that can be easily misrepresented by what we\u2019re trying to do, and be able to be used by those who disagree with us and against the interests of Haiti and the United States,\u201d while pointing to material support, including equipment and training, the US has already provided to address the crisis. The Facebook feed of\u00a0Missions in Haiti\u00a0has told the story of the increasing dire conditions in the country this year. \u201cThe gangs are still fighting for more control and chaos rules,\u201d the organization\u00a0posted\u00a0April 23. \u201cIt seems the world has turned their backs on Haiti and it is going to be left in complete gang control.\u201d This story and headline have been updated with additional details.

It is unclear what Thomas was reassigned to and if he is still working within the police department. The university did not provide a timeline of how long Thomas will be reassigned and whether it will be permanent. On April 30, law enforcement stood by for hours as counterprotesters attacked the pro-Palestinian encampment at UCLA,\u00a0CNN previously reported.

{"id": "2024_05_24_politics_hunter-biden-delaware-case", "text": "The judge in Hunter Biden\u2019s gun case issued a series of pretrial rulings Friday, handing wins to both sides and setting the contours of the upcoming trial. Federal Judge Maryellen Noreika sided with prosecutors on a\u00a0key question about what\u00a0they need to prove about Biden\u2019s drug use when he bought a gun in 2018. To win a conviction, she said they\u2019ll need to show that he was generally using drugs at the time, and not that he specifically used drugs on the day he bought the gun. Biden has advocated for the narrower scope of the law to be applied. But she also decided to allow Biden\u2019s lawyers to challenge the authenticity of specific texts\u00a0from his infamous laptop that will be presented to the jury by special counsel David Weiss\u2019 team. Biden\u2019s lawyers maintain that there are serious questions about the legitimacy\u00a0of the material. Prosecutors said\u00a0in court that they only want to introduce a small slice of the laptop material at trial. \u201cWhat we\u2019re using from the laptop are messages that will be corroborated by a witness who will testify that she sent those messages,\u201d prosecutor Derek Hines said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t some vast array of messages.\u201d The issues were among the more than a dozen questions before the judge at Friday\u2019s hearing about what evidence could come in during the trial, which will begin June 3.\u00a0Biden was present at the hearing, as was Weiss. The president\u2019s son faces three charges in the case brought by\u00a0the special counsel\u00a0in Delaware. Prosecutors accuse Biden of buying and possessing a firearm while addicted to illegal drugs, which is a violation of federal law, and of lying on a form he submitted during the purchase about his drug use. Biden has pleaded not guilty. Lawyers said the trial could last up to two weeks, including jury selection, with the potential to go longer. Biden recently secured a delay in a separate, tax-evasion trial he is facing from the special counsel\u2019s investigation in California, which was originally slated for late June but is now expected to kick off in September. Dispute over ATF forms The parties also tussled over the forms from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives that were filled out when Biden bought the revolver in a Wilmington gun shop in October 2018. The forms are a key piece of evidence because Biden is charged with making a false statement by checking a box that said he wasn\u2019t\u00a0using illegal drugs.\u00a0That\u2019s one of the boilerplate questions on the form that every gun buyer is required to fill out. But some credibility issues have emerged about the forms and the staff at the gun store, who are expected to be called as witnesses by Weiss. There are apparently two versions of the form involving Biden: The initial version that was\u00a0emailed\u00a0to the ATF not long after the purchase, and a paper copy that contains additional\u00a0written\u00a0information that the gun store staff added a couple years later. \u201cThey tampered with it,\u201d Biden\u2019s attorney Abbe Lowell said Friday, noting that the employees added details about how they verified Biden\u2019s identity in order to comply with federal law. At the time of the purchase, the store verified Biden\u2019s identity by using his passport. They later added information about his car registration. \u201cThey accepted an ID that they shouldn\u2019t have accepted,\u201d Lowell said, and now \u201cthe government is giving them a break\u201d by offering them some immunity so they can testify against Biden. The judge didn\u2019t issue any decisions Friday on the matter. Prosecutors have asked her to exclude the second, altered form from the trial altogether. Questions looming if Biden takes the stand There was minimal disagreement between prosecutors and the defense team on many of the 13 motions Noreika was considering Friday about what arguments a jury could hear. They generally agreed that Biden could not bring up claims that the prosecution violated the Second Amendment and that information from his failed plea deal \u2013 and the July 2023 hearing where\u00a0that\u00a0agreement fell apart\u00a0\u2013 should, in most circumstances, not come into the trial. The judge also granted Biden\u2019s request that the\u00a0paternity case\u00a0he faced in Arkansas be excluded, as should his 2014 discharge from the Navy\u00a0over a drug incident. She also limited what references prosecutors could make at trial to his lavish spending habits at the time of the gun purchase, narrowing such evidence to spending connected to drug use. She sided with Biden on whether prosecutors could refer to the tax charges. \u201cThere shall be no reference to the tax case,\u201d the judge said. However, the judge granted those requests with the caveat that she may need to revisit the questions about what a jury can hear if Biden decides to take the stand. His attorneys have not said whether the defendant will testify, and such a decision is usually not announced until the trial is well underway. \u201cA number of issues may become more contested\u201d if Biden testifies, Noreika said.

{"id": "2024_05_24_tech_google-search-ai-results-incorrect-fix", "text": "Google promised its new artificial intelligence search tools would \u201cdo the work for you\u201d and make finding information online quicker and easier. But just days after the launch, the company is already walking back some factually incorrect results. Google earlier this month introduced an AI-generated search results overview tool, which summarizes search results so that users don\u2019t have to click through multiple links to get quick answers to their questions. But the feature came under fire this week after it provided false or misleading information to some users\u2019 questions. For example, several users posted on X that Google\u2019s AI summary said that former President Barack Obama is a Muslim, a common misconception. In fact, Obama is a Christian. Another user posted that a Google AI summary said that \u201cnone of Africa\u2019s 54 recognized countries start with the letter \u2018K\u2019\u201d \u2014 clearly forgetting Kenya. Google confirmed to CNN on Friday that the AI overviews for both queries had been removed for violating the company\u2019s policies. \u201cThe vast majority of AI Overviews provide high quality information, with links to dig deeper on the web,\u201d Google spokesperson Colette Garcia said in a statement, adding that some other viral examples of Google AI flubs appear to have been manipulated images. \u201cWe conducted extensive testing before launching this new experience, and as with other features we\u2019ve launched in Search, we appreciate the feedback. We\u2019re taking swift action where appropriate under our content policies.\u201d The bottom of each Google AI search overview acknowledges that \u201cgenerative AI is experimental.\u201d And the company says it conducts testing designed to imitate potential bad actors in an effort to prevent false or low-quality results from showing up in AI summaries. Google\u2019s search overviews are part of the company\u2019s larger push to incorporate its Gemini AI technology across all of its products as it attempts to keep up in the AI arms race with rivals like OpenAI and Meta. But this week\u2019s debacle shows the risk that adding AI \u2013 which has a tendency to confidently state false information \u2013 could undermine Google\u2019s reputation as the trusted source to search for information online. Even on less serious searches, Google\u2019s AI overview appears to sometimes provide wrong or confusing information. In one test, CNN asked Google, \u201chow much sodium is in pickle juice.\u201d The AI overview responded that an 8 fluid ounce-serving of pickle juice contains 342 milligrams of sodium but that a serving less than half the size (3 fluid ounces) contained more than double the sodium (690 milligrams). (Best Maid pickle juice, for sale at Walmart, lists 250 milligrams of sodium in just 1 ounce.) CNN also searched: \u201cdata used for google ai training.\u201d In its response, the AI overview acknowledged that \u201cit\u2019s unclear if Google prevents copyrighted materials from being included\u201d in the online data scraped to train its AI models, referencing a major concern about how AI firms operate. It\u2019s not the first time Google has had to walk back the capabilities of its AI tools over an embarrassing flub. In February, the company paused the ability of its AI photo generator to create images of people after it was blasted for producing historically inaccurate images that largely showed people of color in place of White people. Google\u2019s Search Labs webpage lets users in areas where AI search overviews have rolled out toggle the feature on and off.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/24/tech/google-search-ai-results-incorrect-fix/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/25/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_05_24_economy_consumer-travel-inflation-memorial-day", "text": "Americans may be sick and tired of dealing with high prices across pretty much every aspect of their lives, but inflation hasn\u2019t yet squashed the travel bug. And this Memorial Day weekend could be a case in point: Travelers are expected to come out in record-setting droves. US airports on Thursday saw their second-ever busiest day, as nearly 2.9 million travelers were screened at Transportation Security Administration checkpoints. Friday was expected to be even busier, TSA said. Traffic on the ground won\u2019t be any less packed: AAA is projecting that a record 38.4 million people will take road trips over the long weekend. Three-plus years of high inflation have taken their toll on Americans\u2019 budgets and, especially, their mindsets. But even though people may be feeling pinched, some are still willing to spend \u2014 if not splurge \u2014 on travel and leisure. \u201cThe truth is that although people complain about the economy and complain about inflation, overall, households are in very good shape in the United States,\u201d Gus Faucher, PNC Financial Services\u2019 chief economist, told CNN on Friday. Inflation has slowed during the past couple of years, pulling back significantly from its peak of 9.1% in June 2022. In April, it measured 3.4% annually, according to the Consumer Price Index. But it is still well above pre-pandemic levels: In February 2020, CPI measured 2.3% annually. Price hikes continue to hit hard, especially where consumers feel it most (their shelter, food and transportation). However, the job market is historically strong and incomes are outpacing inflation. \u201cPeople see [high gas] prices, and they feel like they\u2019re not keeping up,\u201d Faucher said. \u201cBut the truth is, they are. We see that very clearly in the consumer spending numbers.\u201d Taking flight for Taylor, buying tickets for Mickey Consumer spending has increased for 12 consecutive months, Commerce Department data shows. And those pandemic effects still run deep: Americans are putting their cash, and their credit, toward experiences. Disney\u2019s parks and experiences revenue grew roughly 11% during the second quarter from the year prior. The company said that while attendance isn\u2019t at the elevated levels seen following the end of Covid pandemic restrictions, it still rose at its US and Hong Kong Disneyland resorts. But it\u2019s not just Disney \u2014 consumers\u2019 appetite for travel remains robust and is expected to ramp up as the summer season kicks off. \u201cDemand continues to be strong, and we see a record spring and summer travel season,\u201d said Delta Air Lines CEO Ed Bastian during a call with analysts last month. \u201cDelta\u2019s core consumers are in a healthy position and travel remains a top purchase priority.\u201d United Airlines also said in April that it expects both the airline and industry as a whole to report record passenger volumes during the summer. Credit some of that to Ms. Swift: United and Delta said this week that demand is on the rise for Taylor Swift\u2019s \u201cEras Tour\u201d destinations in Europe. And there is some good news on the inflation front in that regard: Airline fares dropped in April from March and are actually down a little more than 1% from February 2020, CPI data shows. Spending by land and by sea Cruise transactions, which include bookings and spending on board, were 16% higher in the first quarter of this year compared to the first quarter of 2019, according to a recent Mastercard Economics Institute report. The jump in cruise spending may be due to \u201cpersistent price increases in the hotel industry,\u201d the Mastercard report said. That\u2019s made cruises \u201ca relatively more budget-friendly option in many cases.\u201d Yet, many large hotel chains say they aren\u2019t seeing a significant pullback. For instance, Marriott International raised its full-year earnings guidance in first-quarter results reported on May 1. The company saw its global revenue per available room climb 4.2% from the year before. \u201cOur 2024 outlook still assumes continued sturdy travel demand and a continuation of current macroeconomic trends,\u201d said Kathleen Oberg, chief financial officer at Marriott, during a call with analysts. The boom times might not last much longer However, nothing lasts forever. Other key players in the travel industry have reported a similar trend this earnings season. Americans, especially lower-income consumers, have pulled back spending at retailers as goods inflation outpaces wage growth. They\u2019ve even become frugal with some experience-based spending like dining out, opting instead to eat at home. Still, some executives have warned that the appetite for travel doesn\u2019t match the boom seen right after Covid pandemic restrictions were lifted, and that the boost from that period is fading. Another source of potential woe is the uncertain economic environment. Pandemic-era savings have been spent while sticky inflation and high inflation rates eat into household budgets. The labor market has shown remarkable resilience through the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate hikes, but it cooled in April. Expedia Group lowered its full-year guidance, citing in part the slower-than-expected growth in gross bookings during the first quarter.   \u201cWe saw a healthy but more normalized market environment for travel globally,\u201d CEO Peter Kern told analysts earlier this month. \u201cWe are largely past the pandemic-driven recovery.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/24/economy/consumer-travel-inflation-memorial-day/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/25/2024", "section": "us"}}

This comes as Biden has hailed cooperation with Africa and is seeking to build relationships with key leaders in the region as a counter to Russia and China\u2019s inroads on the continent. A state visit is among the highest diplomatic tools the White House can employ to honor a top ally, with the meticulously planned event aimed at intertwining and highlighting American and Kenyan cultures.

This visit marks the first time an American president has hosted an African leader since 2008, when President George W. Bush hosted the president of Ghana. 2.

The deliveries were initially hindered by a Hamas drone attack on Israeli forces \u201cseveral miles away\u201d from the pier that led to a freeze on convoy movements, US officials said. Some trucks were also looted along one of the distribution paths earlier this week. More than 1,000 US troops helped to build the humanitarian pier and causeway off the coast of Gaza over the last two months, and the operation launched last week. Since then, more than 500 metric tons of food and other aid have been offloaded and handed off to humanitarian partners, officials say. 3. Covid-19 The Covid-19 variant KP.2 has become the dominant strain in the US in recent weeks, according to the CDC. The variant is part of the broader Omicron family \u2014 which caused the last wave of cases in the winter \u2014 but does not appear to result in more severe disease. Between April 28 to May 11, nearly 30% of new cases in the US were caused by KP.2, up from less than 16% in the two-week period before that. Health experts say the mutations of this variant threaten increased transmissibility and a possible summer wave because existing vaccines may not be as effective. Covid-19 is also settling into some seasonal patterns, which have included a summer bump in years past, but the exact level of risk for this year is unclear. 4. College sports The NCAA and the five power conferences have agreed to a settlement that will pave the way to allow schools to pay student-athletes. Per ESPN, sources said the parties have agreed to a plan that would allow each school to share up to \u201croughly $20 million per year with its athletes\u201d \u2014 a profound moment that will usher in a new era in college sports. The agreement settles three antitrust cases and includes the payment of more than $2.7 billion in damages to past and current student-athletes. Over several years, numerous college programs were punished by the NCAA for their players being compensated in some way for their exploits on the field. 5. Mortgage rates Mortgage rates declined for the third straight week, dipping just below 7%, according to new Freddie Mac data. This is positive news for prospective homebuyers as stubbornly high inflation in the US has dashed many hopes that the Federal Reserve could cut interest rates in the spring or summer. However, financial experts say the housing market\u2019s recovery will remain stagnant, at least in the short term. Sales of previously owned homes, which make up the vast majority of the US housing market, fell in April for the second month in a row, the National Association of Realtors reported this week. That\u2019s a stark contrast from earlier in the year when sales soared.

{"id": "2024_05_22_us_ethan-crumbleys-parents-refuse-help-appeal", "text": "A Michigan judge on Wednesday denied Ethan Crumbley\u2019s request for his parents\u2019 pre-sentence investigation reports to help him appeal his life without parole sentence. Ethan was sentenced in December after pleading guilty to gunning down four classmates and wounding six others and a teacher at Michigan\u2019s Oxford High School in 2021. He was 15 at the time. His parents, James and Jennifer Crumbley, were each sentenced to 10 to 15 years in prison earlier this year following manslaughter convictions. As part of the appeal of his sentence, Ethan asked a state court for the confidential pre-sentence reports used in the trial of his parents, arguing his family and home environment are relevant to his appeal. On Wednesday, Oakland County Circuit Judge Cheryl Matthews sided with the parents and denied the request for the pre-sentence reports, according to Ashley Williams, a member of Matthews\u2019 legal staff. The sentencing court was required to consider his family background, including his home environment, because he was under the age of 18 at the time of the offenses, Ethan\u2019s attorneys wrote in a motion earlier this month. In response, prosecutors did not take a position on the matter and noted the parents\u2019 pre-sentence reports were not created until months after Ethan was sentenced. Alona Sharon, an attorney for Ethan\u2019s father, wrote in response to the motion that Ethan is \u201cable bodied\u201d and \u201ccapable of advising his counsel about his childhood, his parents and his home environment. Counsel has failed to explain to this Honorable Court why they cannot learn this evidence from Ethan directly.\u201d An attorney for Ethan\u2019s mother wrote in a court filing that the documents are \u201cprivileged and confidential\u201d and she had \u201cnot waived her statutory privilege allowing the disclosure of her pre-sentence report.\u201d Jennifer Crumbley\u2019s attorney wrote that in a bid to show that her son\u2019s trial counsel was ineffective, Ethan \u201cis simply attempting to engage in a fishing expedition for information that (he) hopes will prove helpful.\u201d Her attorney wrote Ethan should be able to provide his attorney with any information about his \u201cfamily and home environment\u201d that may be relevant under the law. The Crumbleys are the first parents to be held criminally responsible for a mass school shooting committed by their children\u00a0as the nation continues to grapple with\u00a0the scourge of gunfire on campuses. Attorneys for Ethan and his parents did not immediately respond to CNN requests for comment. Ethan was sentenced last year after pleading guilty to\u00a0terrorism\u00a0causing death, four counts of murder and 19 other related charges. He\u00a0did not testify in his parents\u2019 trials. Ethan admitted in court that on November 30, 2021, he took a gun from an unlocked container in his home, hid it in his backpack and took it out in a bathroom before opening fire on his schoolmates. He killed Madisyn Baldwin, 17; Justin Shilling, 17; Hana St. Juliana, 14; and Tate Myre, 16. At the parents\u2019 trials, prosecutors used testimony from shooting survivors, police investigators and school employees to show James and Jennifer Crumbley were \u201cgrossly negligent\u201d in allowing their teenage son to have access to the gun and ignoring signs of his spiraling mental health. In pre-sentence investigation reports included in the prosecution\u2019s sentencing memos, the parents continued to defend their actions. \u201cI am wrongly accused, and now wrongly convicted of Involuntary Manslaughter. My actions were that of any other parent,\u201d James Crumbley wrote. He also said he \u201chad no knowledge of what (my son) was going to do, or presented with ANY warning signs,\u201d and he defended his gun safety efforts. \u201cI followed the law and took gun safety to the point as needed.\u201d In her report, Jennifer Crumbley sought to clarify her testimony, saying she would not have done anything differently. \u201cWith the information I have now, of course my answer would be hugely different. There are so many things that I would change if I could go back in time,\u201d she said. \u201cI never imagined he would hurt other people in the way that he did.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/us/ethan-crumbleys-parents-refuse-help-appeal/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/25/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_05_24_politics_trump-haley-not-speaking", "text": "Despite the public thawing in their rivalry this week, Donald Trump and Nikki Haley still have yet to speak, two sources close to the former president told CNN, continuing a stalemate that has lasted since their race ended. The lack of formal communication is illustrative of the deep rift that emerged from the Republican presidential primary contest and the ongoing divide over who must be first to mend fences. One source familiar with the former president\u2019s thinking told CNN that \u201ctheir relationship remains chilled\u201d in the aftermath of their hard-fought race. Haley on Wednesday appeared to take the first step toward a reconciliation. In a highly anticipated speech in Washington, DC, the former South Carolina governor said she will vote for Trump \u2014 her first public remarks on the former president since dropping out of the race in March. Haley said Trump \u201chas not been perfect\u201d on policies important to her, including foreign policy, immigration and the economy, but President Joe Biden \u201chas been a catastrophe.\u201d \u201cSo I will be voting for Trump,\u201d said Haley, who served as US ambassador to the United Nations under the former president. Still, she stopped short of offering an endorsement, just as she did when she ended her campaign. Trump on Thursday welcomed Haley\u2019s support, but declined to elaborate on what role she could play in helping the Republican ticket this November. \u201cI think she\u2019s gonna be on our team, because we have a lot of the same ideas, the same thoughts,\u201d Trump said in an interview with News12 at his rally in the Bronx. \u201cI appreciated what she said, you know, we had a nasty campaign. It was pretty nasty, but she\u2019s a very capable person, and I\u2019m sure she\u2019s going to be on our team in some form. Absolutely.\u201d Many Republicans would like to see Haley play an active role in the Trump campaign, including as a potential vice presidential candidate. South Carolina Rep. Ralph Norman told CNN he had pitched the idea to both Trump and Haley and argued to the former president that Haley can carry moderates and independents, given how she continues to draw voters in primaries after exiting the race in March. Trump all but squashed that idea on Truth Social, posting,\u00a0\u201cNikki Haley is not under consideration for the V.P. slot, but I wish her well!\u201d Haley emerged from the 2024 Republican primary as the former president\u2019s last-standing opponent. In her farewell address in Charleston, Haley congratulated Trump and wished him well but added that it was up to him \u201cto earn the votes of those in our party and beyond it who did not support him.\u201d \u201cAnd I hope he does that,\u201d she said. Within Haley\u2019s orbit, few see evidence Trump has made any such outreach. Meanwhile, Haley continues to win a significant share of the vote in primary contests long after she dropped out of the race, including 17% of the vote last month in Pennsylvania, a critical general election battleground. She also won about 22% of the vote in Indiana\u2019s primary earlier this month, a surprising result in a traditionally red state. Meanwhile, Trump\u2019s team remains adamant that it\u2019s up to Haley to initiate a detente, just as other Republican challengers have done. \u201cWhen you lose the battle or the war, you generally have to make the outreach, and that\u2019s just the nature of the campaign business,\u201d a Trump adviser previously told CNN.

{"id": "2024_05_24_us_alec-baldwin-rust-shooting-case", "text": "A judge in New Mexico denied Alec Baldwin\u2019s motion to dismiss the involuntary manslaughter indictment against him in the \u201cRust\u201d fatal shooting case, connected to the 2021 death of the film\u2019s cinematographer, Halyna Hutchins. Baldwin\u2019s attorneys had accused prosecutors of misconduct during the grand jury process and sought to have the case dismissed. In January, Baldwin pleaded not guilty to involuntary manslaughter in the shooting. Hutchins was fatally shot and director Joel Souza was injured after a gun Baldwin was holding discharged a live round during a scene rehearsal on the New Mexico set of the western movie. It was the second time the actor pleaded not guilty to charges related to the shooting. Involuntary manslaughter charges were dropped against Baldwin in 2023, with prosecutors saying in a statement at the time that they could not \u201cproceed under the current time constraints and on the facts and evidence turned over by law enforcement in its existing form\u201d due to \u201cnew facts\u201d in the case. He was charged for a second time and indicted in January. Baldwin\u2019s lawyers filed a motion to dismiss the indictment in March. They accused prosecutors of engaging in misconduct and said prosecutors \u201cpublicly dragged Baldwin through the cesspool created by their improprieties \u2013 without any regard for the fact that serious criminal charges have been hanging over his head for two and a half years.\u201d Baldwin\u2019s lawyers claimed the prosecution presented false and inaccurate testimony to the grand jury, withheld exculpatory evidence from the grand jury, and gave them improper and prejudicial instructions. In response to Baldwin\u2019s team\u2019s March motion to dismiss the indictment, special prosecutors in New Mexico defended their case, saying Baldwin\u2019s behavior on the \u201cRust\u201d movie set contributed to \u201csafety compromises\u201d that led to the fatal shooting. In the order to deny Baldwin\u2019s motion to dismiss, the judge said despite the defense\u2019s claims,there was no prosecutorial bad faith, as Baldwin\u2019s legal team had claimed, and proper procedures were followed in the grand jury process. In the ruling, the judge said \u201cafter review of transcripts from the January 18, 2024 and January 19, 2024 grand jury presentations, the Court does not find that the \u2018prosecuting attorney assisting the grand jury\u2019 engaged in \u2018intentional misconduct\u2019 reflecting \u2018dishonesty of belief, purpose, or motive\u2019 in the course of the attorney\u2019s \u2018presentation of evidence to the grand jury.\u2019\u201d The film\u2019s armorer, Hannah Gutierrez Reed, who was responsible for firearm safety and storage on the movie\u2019s set, was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter in March. She was sentenced in April to 18 months in prison and is appealing. In a short statement to CNN following a judge\u2019s refusal to dismiss charges against Baldwin, Luke Nikas and Alex Spiro from the actor\u2019s legal team said: \u201cWe look forward to our day in court.\u201d This is a developing story and will be updated.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/24/us/alec-baldwin-rust-shooting-case/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/25/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_05_23_us_katrina-twins-graduate-honore", "text": "The milestone unfolding here this week would have seemed unfathomable in the chaos nearly 19 years ago, when the US Army lieutenant general with the booming voice first met the twin babies. The infant boys were starving and dehydrated, nearly limp in the suffocating heat in the days after Hurricane Katrina defeated New Orleans\u2019 levee system, flooded its streets and killed many of the 1,392 people across the region who\u2019d ultimately succumb to its horrors. Their mom, Alexandria Wheeler, had run out of formula to feed them and so decided finally to venture out for help that by then clearly wasn\u2019t coming for her. \u201cIt was like being in a third world country on United States soil,\u201d she recalled to CNN. She walked a long time to get to dry land. Then, she saw him: combat uniform, black beret, aviator glasses. \u201cThis man comes around the corner to our rescue,\u201d Wheeler said of a moment that soon would become an icon of the Crescent City\u2019s freshly ravaged streets. \u201cIt was like God just coming in, stepping in out of nowhere.\u201d Lt. Gen. Russel Honor\u00e9 and his crew quickly scooped up A\u2019Mari and J\u2019Mari Reynolds, each in nothing but a diaper and a tiny navy baseball cap. The encounter didn\u2019t last long, but it would prove momentous: a young family\u2019s first step toward a future that would include another flood but also many bright twists before the latest chapter came into focus hundreds of miles away with the Reynolds twins again poised to meet Honor\u00e9. This time they wore navy mortarboards and matching gowns as they got ready to line up for their graduation from Eagle\u2019s Landing High School near Atlanta. But first, they had to take a video call, one almost two decades in the making. Before they walked across the stage Wednesday to collect their diplomas, they had to deliver a message to a certain Bronze Star recipient \u2013 now 76 and retired \u2013 about how grateful they were to him. They had to tell him how his legacy was now wrapped up in the plans they had for their own futures. Their mom wanted to see his face when they told him. A\u2019Mari and J\u2019Mari stared at the laptop on a picnic table near the commencement venue when his image blinked onto the screen from Louisiana: open collar, dark suspenders, a few more creases around his brown eyes. \u201cWow! Nineteen years ago, boys! Now, look at you two young men,\u201d Honor\u00e9 said before diving right back to the moment they met: \u201cYou were toddlers on Poydras and Convention street when your mom was walking down the street with you, one in each arm. \u201cAnd as we walked up toward her, myself and two soldiers, she started to lower her arms,\u201d he told them. \u201cShe had become exhausted from carrying you.\u201d \u2018Put those weapons down, dammit!\u2019 In those desperate, sweltering, early days of New Orleans\u2019 great flood of 2005, Wheeler \u2013 like so many survivors \u2013 had been far more concerned for her children than herself. \u201cWe hadn\u2019t eaten in maybe six days\u201d when the mother started making her way to the makeshift shelter at the Superdome \u2013 one 6 \u00bd-month-old strapped to her chest, the other on her back. Wheeler waded through murky water that hid horrors, including one she bumped under the surface: \u201cIt was two bodies, collided,\u201d she told CNN a few years later. \u201cTheir arms were stretched out. They were full of water, and they raised up to the top from me lifting my leg up.\u201d When mom and boys finally made it to the stadium, though, supplies were scant. So, a desperate Wheeler headed to Harrah\u2019s casino a couple blocks away. But military personnel with guns drawn stopped them. Terror and confusion hit Wheeler. \u201cWe\u2019re the victims,\u201d she recalled thinking. \u201cWhat are you pulling guns on us for?\u201d That\u2019s when she first heard his voice: \u201cPut those weapons down, dammit!\u201d It was Honor\u00e9, the Louisiana native dispatched to lead the Defense Department\u2019s response to Hurricanes Katrina and soon Rita; CNN cameras captured the moment. \u201cHe was like God\u2019s angel,\u201d Wheeler said. Firearm barrels lowered. Then, Honor\u00e9 saw the mom with her tiny sons: \u201cMe and my team, I knew we had to reach out and help these babies.\u201d \u2018There\u2019s no question. We would have died\u2019 Their rescue, in Honor\u00e9\u2019s view, had been fate: In a city without drinkable water or electricity, a US Coast Guard vessel had docked just two blocks away; a medevac aircraft was available; and a system was in place to spirit the most dire patients to Louisiana\u2019s capital, then on to Texas, for aid. \u201cThis was meant to happen,\u201d he said, hesitating even to imagine an alternative too \u201cunconscionable to think about.\u201d The lieutenant general then spent about four hours with Wheeler and her twins, cradling A\u2019Mari and J\u2019Mari before the family was en route to San Antonio, she said. \u201cThey were completely dehydrated. Their veins \u2013 everything \u2013 it was really hard for them to put in IVs,\u201d Wheeler recalled, adding her sons were in the hospital for a week and a half. \u201cA\u2019Mari actually coded blue, and then J\u2019Mari went directly after him.\u201d Honor\u00e9 is the only reason they made it, Wheeler said. She is sure of it. \u201cWe would have died,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s no question. We would have died.\u201d Meanwhile, Honor\u00e9\u2019s encounter with the Reynolds twins left him \u201cinspired \u2026 to move faster,\u201d he said this week. \u201cWe had to do this quicker, faster, better \u2026 because I knew that there would be other babies out there that were not as lucky as us to have this moment where all things came together.\u201d \u2018You guys grew up in 12 years!\u2019 A\u2019Mari and J\u2019Mari grew up recounting the story of their deliverance, telling and retelling it with their mom and watching and rewatching the video of their tiny selves getting handed to Honor\u00e9 and his team before their flight to safety. But it would take another dozen years \u2013 and another monster storm \u2013 to give the boys and their mother the chance to thank Honor\u00e9 for all he\u2019d done to help them. Hurricane Harvey threatened the family\u2019s Houston apartment in 2017 as it directly killed 68 people in Texas and did more than $150 billion in damage. The storm\u2019s aftermath also drew a certain lieutenant general, by then retired but still vocal about how best to respond to the changing climate\u2019s power to destroy \u2013 and still known for leading with his heart. Thankfully, Harvey\u2019s water didn\u2019t enter Wheeler\u2019s home. But when she heard Honor\u00e9 was in Texas, she sent him a message on social media. He responded. The four of them reunited, with the twins rushing to the military man to thank him \u201cfor saving our lives.\u201d Honor\u00e9 put his arms around them all. \u201cBoy, you guys grew up in 12 years!\u201d he said. Then, the decorated soldier \u2013 with degrees from Southern University and A&M College and Troy State University \u2013 quizzed the twins in a key category for middle school students, cultivating a seed already taking root in their young minds: Where did they plan to go to college? Though the boys and Honor\u00e9 stayed in touch from then on, it would be another seven years before they could give him answers to that critical question. \u2018Why I\u2019m still standing here today\u2019 Sitting at the picnic table outside Atlanta in their graduation gowns, the Reynolds twins leaned into the laptop screen Wednesday to speak directly to the man whose lessons they\u2019d begun to learn long before either could remember. A\u2019Mari spoke to Honor\u00e9 first: \u201cI would like to take a moment to give you my deepest gratitudes because your kindness, commitment and bravery during Hurricane Katrina is the reason why I\u2019m still standing here today. \u201cThanks to you, it inspired me,\u201d he said, \u201cand you played a pivotal role in my life, and thanks to you, I\u2019ll be a future addition to the United States Marine Corps.\u201d \u201cOoh-rah!\u201d the career Army man responded with the other branch\u2019s battle cry. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna learn how to say that word: Ooh-rah. \u201cCongratulations,\u201d he continued. \u201cThat\u2019s a great move. Best marines in the world. You\u2019re going to a great outfit, and you\u2019ll come out stronger than you went in.\u201d Next up was J\u2019Mari: \u201cI would also like to \u2026 thank you so much for your bravery and your help that I was able to survive. You gave me at least a bunch of hope that there\u2019s still good in the world, and it gave me a chance to change mentally and physically, where I would be nice to other people, I would help others in need of help. \u201cI\u2019m going to college to do automotive engineering,\u201d he declared. \u201cI want to help other people and make sure everything is safe for them.\u201d Honor\u00e9 retook the floor \u2013 and again raised the stakes: \u201cWell, thank you and good luck. I look forward to you inventing things that will make the world safer from climate change \u2026 because the opportunities are there to change the world with the education you\u2019re gonna get and help save the planet.\u201d Wheeler, for her part, watched it all unfold, including the look on the retired lieutenant general\u2019s face. He also had a message for her: \u201cYou done good!\u201d he told A\u2019Mari\u2019s and J\u2019Mari\u2019s mom. \u201cThey\u2019re here today because of you and your tenacity and your willingness to fight for them. \u201cWhen we saw you on the streets of New Orleans, you motivated the entire United States military to do more and do it quicker and do it better. We are here with admiration today because you inspired us.\u201d Wheeler thanked him, too \u2013 for insisting those soldiers put down their guns, for affirming their survival in Houston, for \u201cchanging our lives forever.\u201d They could never find words enough to thank him, she said, or do enough to repay him. The score, however, didn\u2019t seem like one that needed settling. The first steps of the paths the Reynolds twins now had chosen might well have been lain right there at the corner of Poydras Street, when their exhausted mom happened upon an angel in fatigues. \u201cI feel so gratified,\u201d Honor\u00e9 said. \u201cThe engineer \u2026 can have the capability to change the world, and the Marine that\u2019s going into national service to help protect our freedom and our democracy. \u201cThese young men,\u201d the retired Army man said of the babies he once saved from the teeth of a deadly flood, \u201cwill be game changers.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/23/us/katrina-twins-graduate-honore/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/25/2024", "section": "us"}}

I love every child,\u201d she added. \u201cImagining for one second what a mom is going through unable to feed her child or give her child clean water or keep her child safe.\u201d The backlash had started\u00a0four\u00a0days earlier, after Accurso announced a campaign to raise money for children in several war-torn parts of the world, including Gaza.\u00a0She began receiving\u00a0angry comments on her posts, asking why she wasn\u2019t also trying to help victims of Hamas\u2019 deadly October 7 attack on Israel. \u201cYou should be for all children not just the children in gaza. Do you not care what hamas did to all the innocent jewish children october 7th???\u201d\u00a0one Instagram\u00a0comment said. \u201cYou mention the children of Gaza in your video \u2026 how about the children held hostage? Do you care about all children?\u201d another commenter posted on TikTok. In the caption on her tearful May 16 video, Accurso reiterated her concern for all the world\u2019s children. \u201cPalestinian children, Israeli children, children in the US \u2013 Muslim, Jewish, Christian children \u2013 all children, in every country,\u201d\u00a0she wrote. \u201cNot one is excluded.\u201d Her clarification was not enough to quell backlash from commenters who accused her of disregarding the pain of Israeli children. CNN has reached out to Accurso for comment. Between the polarizing Israel-Hamas war and fiery recent protests on US college campuses, some social media influencers have felt pressure to speak up. But the Ms Rachel episode is a reminder that even the most innocuous influencers can\u00a0face pushback\u00a0when they wade into a thorny issue like the Middle East. She raised $50,000 within hours for children affected by war Accurso is an educator who uses videos filled with songs and games to help toddlers and parents navigate the early childhood years. Her series, \u201cSongs for Littles,\u201d features catchy, educational tunes that are popular with both parents and young children. Her videos are a hit with 9.8 million subscribers\u00a0on YouTube, and span a myriad of topics, including learning how to talk and read. She announced her fundraising campaign\u00a0in a video\u00a0posted May 12 to her TikTok and Instagram accounts, offering to make Cameos \u2014 paid personalized video messages that a celebrity can film on request. Accurso said her earnings from the videos will go to Save the Children\u2019s emergency fund for kids affected by war and mentioned Gaza along with Sudan, Ukraine, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. \u201cHopefully I can make little ones smile by giving them a personal video and then the money will go to help more children living in unimaginable circumstances,\u201d she said in the video. \u201cChildren should never experience the horrors of war. These are grave violations of their human rights. Children should be protected.\u201d A day later, she posted another message on the horrifying effects of war. \u201cWe should be ashamed of how children around the world are suffering,\u201d she wrote. Cameo requests and money flooded in. Within hours, she\u2019d raised\u00a0$50,000 from 500 requests\u00a0for personal videos, she said. \u201cEvery penny on my end will go to [Save the Children] to help children facing unimaginable circumstances,\u201d she wrote.\u00a0CNN has reached out to Save the Children for comment. Accurso then paused the\u00a0Cameo requests,\u00a0saying she needed time to film the 500 personalized videos before she could accept\u00a0any\u00a0more. Then came the backlash. A few days later, she posted the tearful video, with the comments turned off\u00a0on Instagram. Instead of her trademark pink T-shirt and denim dungarees, she was barely visible in dim lighting and clutching what appeared to be a blanket. She did not go into details about the bullying she said she\u2019s received and has disabled comments on YouTube and\u00a0some\u00a0Instagram posts. She also received supportive messages. \u201cThis is a moral litmus test and you\u2019re on the right side,\u201d one commenter posted on her TikTok. \u201cStay strong.\u201d Another added: \u201cYou are the Mr. Rogers to our babies\u2019 generation. Thank you for using your platform in such an influential way.\u201d Divisive issues can be tricky for social media influencers, expert says Hamas-led militants killed about 1,200 people in southern Israel on October 7 and took some 250 hostages into Gaza. In response, Israel launched a war on Hamas in Gaza that continues seven months later. More than 14,000 children have been killed in Gaza since the war started in October,\u00a0according to the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund. About 12,000 more children have been wounded and thousands remain missing, it says. \u201cRafah is a city of children,\u201d UNICEF\u00a0spokesperson James Elder said\u00a0this month, referring to the Palestinian city in southern Gaza. \u201cIf we define safety \u2014 as international humanitarian law says we must \u2014 as freedom from bombardment, as well as access to safe water, sufficient food, shelter and medicine \u2014 then there is nowhere safe on the Gaza Strip to go to.\u201d Accurso is one of a number of\u00a0social media influencers\u00a0who have used their platforms to raise funds as the humanitarian crisis unfolds in Gaza.\u00a0She describes herself as an ambassador for\u00a0Save the Children. Giselle Ugarte, an online performance and personal branding coach, says joining conversations on such a divisive issue can be tricky for a social media influencer like Accurso, whose brand is built around kids. \u201cMs Rachel is someone who is looked at as an educational resource for young children, a neutral force and a safe place, separated from any of the dangers of the outside world,\u201d she said. \u201cParents want to feel that they can step away from the screen and not have to worry about their children consuming content outside of her traditional programming.\u201d Ugarte said she advises influencers to assess whether wading into a polarizing issue aligns with their mission and brand, and to first \u201crecognize the potential backlash, consequences or perhaps even physical dangers.\u201d Accurso\u00a0has\u00a0said she plans to resume\u00a0her Cameo fundraising campaign.\u00a0And she\u2019s back to pleading for help for the children of Gaza. \u201cI saw a picture of two babies in Gaza and their thighs are like this small,\u201d she said in\u00a0a post Tuesday, choking back tears and making a circle with her thumb and forefinger. \u201cWe can\u2019t let children starve. That is not who we are.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/us/ms-rachel-gaza-social-media-cec/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/25/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_05_22_us_uvalde-shooting-victims-lawsuit", "text": "Nineteen families of the students and teachers killed or injured at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, announced Wednesday they have settled a lawsuit with the city for $2 million, and announced they are suing 92 officers with Texas Department of Public Safety, the school district and individual employees. \u201cIt has been an unbearable two years,\u201d Javier Cazares, the father of 9-year-old victim Jacklyn Cazares, said at a news conference. \u201cWe all know who took our children\u2019s lives, but there was an obvious systemic failure out there on May 24. The whole world saw that. \u201cNo amount of money is worth the lives of our children. Justice and accountability has always been my main concern. We\u2019ve been let down so many times, that time has come to do the right thing,\u201d he said. The city confirmed the settlement in a statement. \u201cToday, we are thankful to join the victims\u2019 families in arriving at an agreement that will allow us to remember the Robb Elementary tragedy while moving forward together as a community to bring healing and restoration to all those affected,\u201d the city said. \u201cWe will forever be grateful to the victims\u2019 families for working with us over the past year to cultivate an environment of community-wide healing that honors the lives and memories of those we tragically lost. May 24th is our community\u2019s greatest tragedy.\u201d The announcement of the settlement and the latest legal action come just before the two-year anniversary of\u00a0the mass shooting in which an 18-year-old stormed into the elementary school, killed 19 children and two teachers and barricaded himself in a classroom. A total of 376 law enforcement officers from across the region rushed to the school to respond, but ultimately none of them breached the door to the classroom to confront the shooter for 77 minutes. The slow response was at odds with law enforcement active shooter protocols, widely accepted after the Columbine school shooting in 1999, to stop the threat immediately. As part of the settlement, Uvalde will pay the families a total of $2 million from its insurance coverage, according to a statement from attorneys Josh Koskoff and Erin Rogiers. In addition, the city pledged to institute several policy changes to the police department, such as a new \u201cfitness for duty\u201d standard for police officers. The city will also establish May 24 as an annual Day of Remembrance, will create a committee to coordinate designing a permanent memorial and will support mental health services for the families, survivors and community, the attorneys said. The terms of the settlement were reached through a \u201crestorative justice process\u201d between impacted families and the city, the attorneys said. Pursuing further legal action against Uvalde could have bankrupted the city, a result that none of the families wanted, they added. In a statement, Koskoff called the settlement a step in the healing process, and the mother of a student who was killed said it reflected a \u201cgood faith effort.\u201d \u201cFor two long years, we have languished in pain and without any accountability from the law enforcement agencies and officers who allowed our families to be destroyed that day. This settlement reflects a first good faith effort by the City of Uvalde to begin rebuilding trust in the systems that failed to protect us,\u201d Veronica Luevanos, whose daughter\u00a0Jailah and nephew Jayce were killed, said in a statement. \u201cBut it wasn\u2019t just Uvalde officers who failed us that day. Nearly 100 officers from the Texas Department of Public Safety have yet to face a shred of accountability for cowering in fear while my daughter and nephew bled to death in their classroom.\u201d Delayed law enforcement response widely criticized Also Wednesday, the attorneys announced they are suing 92 individual Texas DPS officers, the school district and several employees for their alleged failures responding to the shooting. \u201cLaw enforcement\u2019s inaction that day was a complete and absolute betrayal of these families and the sons, daughters and mothers they lost,\u201d Rogiers said in the statement. \u201cTXDPS had the resources, training and firepower to respond appropriately, and they ignored all of it and failed on every level. These families have not only the right but also the responsibility to demand justice, both for their own loss and to prevent other families from suffering the same fate.\u201d A spokesperson for the Uvalde Consolidated Independent School District said the district \u201cremains committed to supporting our community throughout this process\u201d but declined to comment on the specifics of the case, citing the ongoing litigation. \u201cThe District continues to be open to exploring a resolution involving all the families and individuals impacted by this tragedy,\u201d said Anne Marie Espinoza, the district\u2019s executive director of communications and marketing. CNN has reached out to the Texas Department of Public Safety and the DPS Officers Association for a response. The disastrous police response has been criticized in a series of government investigative reports, although no one has faced criminal repercussions. A scathing US Department of Justice report in January blamed the failed response on \u201ccascading failures of leadership, decision-making, tactics, policy, and training\u201d on the part of law enforcement officials and said lives would have been saved if police had followed generally accepted practices. Uvalde school district police chief Pete Arredondo was fired in August 2022 for his role in the failed response to the mass shooting. His replacement, Joshua Gutierrez, has submitted his resignation and his last day on the job is set for June, according to a school official\u2019s statement. The lawsuit announced Wednesday is just the latest civil action related to the mass shooting. Previously, the family of Eliahna Torres, a 10-year-old victim, filed a lawsuit in November 2022 against nearly two dozen people and entities, including the gun manufacturer and store that provided the rifle used in the attack and law enforcement officials who responded to the scene. In addition, survivors of the shooting filed a $27 billion class action lawsuit in federal court in December 2022 against multiple Texas law enforcement agencies. A trial date has not been set in either lawsuit. Officials have said the shooter legally purchased the guns in the days after his 18th birthday. The carnage remains among the deadliest episodes in America\u2019s ongoing scourge of school shootings.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/us/uvalde-shooting-victims-lawsuit/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/25/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_05_24_business_ace-hardware-staying-power", "text": "Mahin Barker said soccer moms keep her on her toes at her store in West Lake Hills on the outskirts of Austin, Texas. They come in nearly every day and they\u2019re keen to shop. \u201cThey have a lot of time and disposable income to spend so we have to keep our merchandise fresh because they\u2019re here so often,\u201d she said. The store she runs is an Ace Hardware. The 100-year-old, Oak Brook, Illinois-based hardware chain, which has permeated America\u2019s smaller neighborhoods with more than 5,000 locations, appears to be pulling in shoppers even as its big-box hardware rivals Home Depot and Lowe\u2019s are struggling to do the same. One indicator is how frequently people are heading to Ace Hardware versus its competitors. Monthly customer traffic to Ace Hardware locations is up so far this year versus a year ago, compared to mostly dropping shopper traffic every month to Home Depot and Lowe\u2019s stores over the same period, according to Placer. ai, which uses location data from mobile devices to estimate visits to specific retailer locations. Also, all three retailers reported their quarterly sales this month and it wasn\u2019t a pretty picture for the industry Goliaths. Home Depot\u2019s same-store sales (or sales at stores open at least a year) in the US fell 3.2% in its latest quarter both as shoppers pulled back on remodels and renovations and also on discretionary decorative-type purchases to spruce up their homes. Home Depot\u2019s stock price is down 5% so far in 2024. Lowe\u2019s sales at stores open at least a year fell a steep 4.1% in its latest quarter for similar reasons. Lowe\u2019s stock price has dipped 7% in the past month.  \u201cThe danger here is that while Home Depot has a commanding position, it faces much more competition on the light-side improvement space from smaller improvement players, garden centers, and specialists like Sherwin Williams in categories like paint,\u201d Neil Saunders, retail analyst and managing director at Globaldata Retail, wrote in a note last week. \u201cConsumers are now shopping around more to find the best bargains and deals,\u201d he said. These trends appear to be working in Ace Hardware\u2019s favor. The hardware chain saw a small increase in its US same-store sales in its most recent quarter and a 1.1% increase in the average amount people spent per store trip. Total revenue for the company systemwide rose 2.5% in the period from a year ago. It expects to open 200 new stores in 2024. Small and mighty stores Ace Hardware\u2019s store setup \u2014 smaller-sized shops of 7,000 to 10,000 square feet on average \u2014 situated within communities and selling much more than just nuts, bolts and paint are resonating with the evolving shopping psyche of today\u2019s rushed consumers, industry watchers said. Each store carries about 25,000 to 30,000 unique products. \u201cIt\u2019s an interesting phenomenon,\u201d said Michael Brown, partner in consulting firm Kearney\u2019s\u00a0consumer products and retail practice. \u201cAce is your local customized, intimate hardware store where I can go in, get something very quickly, talk to people that I know. It\u2019s also close to home and I can easily meet my small project needs,\u201d he said. Home Depot and Lowe\u2019s, by contrast, cater to the contractor or the homeowner doing big remodeling work. And while bigger home renovation projects have slowed in recent months, those larger hardware stores have suffered sales declines. Ace, meanwhile, benefits as people turn to smaller fix-it projects, he said. \u201cThey\u2019re positioned quite well now geographically to service the needs of the consumer today,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve build a unique niche and their stores are also bringing a local flavor to them.\u201d Barker is owner and operator of five Breed & Co Ace Hardware locations in the Austin, Texas, area. The West Lake Hills store, in particular, is popular with women. While the store stocks typical hardware needs such as screws, drill bits and hammers, Barker goes to great lengths to offer the unexpected. \u201cI like to call it a boutique atmosphere,\u201d she said. She said upper-income customers have expectations of better service. \u201cIf you want to continue to have that consistent repeat business you got to give them what they want.\u201d In addition to hardware and garden products, the housewares section offers a wedding registry. \u201cIt\u2019s a very unique proposition because we don\u2019t have a lot of competition in terms of local, relevant and differentiated retailing here,\u201d Barker said. The registry idea arose from a local need. \u201cWe noticed that a lot of brides don\u2019t necessarily want to get what Aunt May buys for them,\u201d she said. Engaged couples, she said, sometimes prefer picking items such as a grill or plants. So we\u2019ve really beefed up that side of the business to stay relevant to our customers.\u201d Jewelry is a top seller, too, as are pricey Le Crueset pots and pans, Nest candles, baby products such as plush toys, baby onesie pajamas and truffle chocolates. \u201cWe sell a ton of Le Crueset. It\u2019s one of our top performers,\u201d Barker said. \u201cMany of our customers are grandparents going to a baby shower and they need a gift. We count on people coming in everyday to buy a gift item from us.\u201d This hybrid hardware-home goods-curio model is setting Ace Hardware stores apart. \u201cConsumers are looking for new places to shop,\u201d Brown said. \u201cWe\u2019ve lost places like Bed Bath & Beyond and Linens \u2018n Things, where you go to buy a curtain rod or smaller home needs. Ace is nicely filling that void.\u201d A retail cooperative Ace Hardware, with its catchy jingle \u201cAce is the place with the helpful hardware folks,\u201d was founded in 1924 by a group of four Chicago hardware store owners. It operates a unique structure in which only 4% of its more than 6,000 worldwide stores are company owned. The retailer, instead runs as a retail-owned cooperative, which means individual store operators are also part owners, making them independent entrepreneurs. \u201cThey are essentially shareholders, they own the brand and the company,\u201d said Kim Lefko, chief marketing officer of Ace Hardware. Individual store owners, who make up more than 90% of the business, select products in two ways: They can order and stock national brands and private label products in bulk at a lower price directly from Ace Hardware\u2019s warehouses. They also have the flexibility to curate about 20% of the merchandise mix to suit local tastes and needs by ordering directly from other vendors, Lefko said. \u201cDuring the post World War I era, the four business owners much like today wanted to be competitive in the marketplace. They got together and the very first product they bought was a truckload of sponges so they could be price competitive,\u201d said Lefko. \u201cThis really is the co-op structure. It keeps us competitive against the like of Home Depot and Lowe\u2019s, together with the ability to also tailor the products to what the local community needs.\u201d But all stores are still unified under Ace\u2019s national marketing and advertising effort, she said. Ace is pushing innovation with the brand, too. It just launched its first Ace-branded food product, a line of BBQ sauces, and a collection of Ace Hardware vintage-inspired clothing. Legendary NFL coach and broadcaster John Madden served as a pitchman for Ace Hardware for more than 20 years while his NFL broadcast partner Pat Summerall was a pitchman for rival hardware chain, True Value. In many of the same neighborhoods, Ace Hardware has gone head-to-head with True Value, which operated a similar model to Ace for many years, a cooperative partly owned by its roughly 4,000 store owners. Private equity firm Acon Investments purchased True Value in 2018 and ended its time as cooperative retail chain. Michael Wynn, owner of Sunshine Ace Hardware with 12 locations in the Southern Florida area, is catering to a different demographic in his community \u2013- fishermen. Among the locally curated products he stocks next to plumbing, electrical supplies and hardware are fishing gear \u2014 reels, rods, tackles and Yeti coolers. \u201cWe have the largest assortment in southwest Florida,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we also sell homemade fudge and Vera Bradley bags and pouches.\u201d \u201cPeople are time starved. They want quick and convenient shopping experience and we\u2019re trying to give them that,\u201d Wynn said, whose grandfather founded the first Sunshine Ace in 1958. So he added a drive-thru window in one of his newer stores. He\u2019s glad he did. He said a customer recently pulled up to pick up an order but his child was agitated and made it difficult for the man to come into the store. \u201cSo he requested that the store clerk bring the order to him,\u201d said Wynn. \u201cThis for me is a big part of why we try to offer unique services and look out for our customers.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/24/business/ace-hardware-staying-power/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/25/2024", "section": "us"}}

It\u2019s the third time in as many years that a major West Coast city has ousted its DA over apparent concerns about crime. Portland\u2019s vote this week is particularly notable given the unrest in the city following the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis in the summer of 2020\u00a0and a recent surge in drug overdoses that prompted the declaration of a state of emergency. \u201cIt is looking as if I will not be serving another four years as Multnomah County District Attorney,\u201d Schmidt said in a statement obtained by\u00a0CNN affiliate KOIN.\u00a0\u201cI\u00a0have called Nathan Vasquez to congratulate him on his victory.\u201d While results in Tuesday\u2019s nonpartisan election have not been certified, unofficial results on the Oregon Secretary of State\u2019s\u00a0website\u00a0as of 10:00 a.m. ET Friday showed Vasquez ahead of Schmidt, 53.3% to 46.3%. Vasquez, a prosecutor in Multnomah County since 2001, made public safety a key component of his campaign for office. \u201cWe must take lawless behavior seriously and enforce our laws,\u201d his\u00a0campaign platform\u00a0said.\u00a0\u201cEven\u00a0\u2018petty\u2019\u00a0crimes, like theft, vandalism, and littering, public use of illicit drugs and public highs, all contribute to the overall feeling of safety and wellbeing of a community.\u201d Vasquez told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper on Wednesday that the community in Portland is still very progressive and is not abandoning those values with his election. \u201cReally what they\u2019re looking for, though, is a balance,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cThey\u00a0want public safety and they want it delivered in a professional manner. And that\u2019s why I came forward with the experience I have to do that in a way that kind of respects our values in this community, but also makes sure that victims and public safety are our priority.\u201d He also said,\u00a0\u201cThere\u00a0were things that got off track, and I believe the community now is ready for a different vision \u2014 one that involves more public safety, but still has a strong place for progressive values.\u201d As CNN\u00a0has reported, state and local officials declared a fentanyl state of emergency in January for parts of downtown Portland following a surge in overdoses. Last month, Oregon\u2019s Democratic Gov. Tina Kotek\u00a0signed legislation\u00a0re-criminalizing the possession of certain drugs, roughly three years after the state became the first in the nation to decriminalize the possession and personal use of all drugs. The shakeup in Portland comes as public safety issues have driven prosecutor races in other West Coast cities in recent years. Voters in San Francisco\u00a0recalled District Attorney Chesa Boudin\u00a0in 2022 amid concern that he was advancing progressive policies as a national criminal justice reform advocate at the cost of their safety, and in 2021,\u00a0voters in Seattle\u00a0elected Ann Davison, a Republican, as city attorney over a challenger who had called for abolishing jails and police, CNN affiliate KIRO reported.

{"id": "2024_05_15_us_nakba-day-anniversary-palestinians", "text": "Mohammad Zarqa trembled with fear as he watched panicked crowds of people, screaming and covered in blood, rush into his small village on the outskirts of Jerusalem. \u201cYou have to run,\u201d he remembers a woman crying out, shocking Zarqa out of a daze and sending him racing home to warn his family. He was only 12 years old at the time, unaware of the looming war that would soon upend his life. It was April 9, 1948, and Jewish militias had just attacked Deir Yassin, a village about a mile northeast of Zarqa\u2019s home in Ein Karem in what was then the British Mandate of Palestine. At least 100 people, including women and children, were killed \u2013 many stripped, lined up and shot with automatic fire, according to reports from the time archived by the United Nations. The massacre is among the events that led to al-Nakba, or \u201cthe catastrophe,\u201d when roughly 700,000 Palestinians fled or were expelled from their homes by armed Jewish groups seeking to establish the state of Israel. \u201cWe thought we were going to be next,\u201d Zarqa, now 88, tells CNN from his home in New Jersey. \u201cMy father said, \u2018We cannot stay here. They\u2019re going to come and massacre us.\u2019 We had nothing, no weapons, nothing to defend ourselves. That\u2019s the day we became refugees.\u201d On Wednesday, Zarqa joins millions of Palestinians across the world to mark Nakba Day with protests and community events intended to honor the memory of the Palestinians killed and displaced in 1948 and the brutal war unfolding today in Gaza. Part of that commemoration includes a commitment to storytelling, Zarqa says, whereby survivors of the Nakba generation continue to share their experiences with younger Palestinians so the dream of liberation and return never dies. He believes it\u2019s the only way to understand the current war and work toward a just and lasting peace in the region. \u201cMy heart is bleeding,\u201d he says softly. \u201cAt my age, I\u2019m still dreaming of going back home. Palestine is something that is still implanted in my heart and my body. It\u2019s where I was born. It\u2019s where I have my memories. It\u2019s my country.\u201d Yearning for home Zarqa, along with his parents and six siblings, fled Ein Karem on foot, taking very little with them. They walked from village to village, searching for food and sheltering in the homes and garages of kind strangers. The atrocities he witnessed along the way are seared in his memory. \u201cI saw the most horrific things in my life: women coming in with torn clothes and uncovered heads crying, screaming, saying that the Jews \u2013 they weren\u2019t called Israelis at the time \u2013 attacked their village and massacred everybody,\u201d Zarqa says. More than 15,000 Palestinians were killed and 531 towns and villages destroyed during al-Nakba, according to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics, an institute of the Palestinian Authority. Jewish leaders declared independence and the creation of the state of Israel on May 14, sparking a military response from Egypt, Syria and Jordan. The family hoped the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, as it would come to be known, would end in a swift victory for the Arabs. After several weeks, Zarqa\u2019s family returned to Ein Karem. But when they entered the village, they found it had been ransacked and its residents cast out by Jewish militias, Zarqa says. With nothing left to salvage, they fled to Jordan to wait out the war, he recalls. The family initially lived in squalor, surviving off the generosity of strangers and local mosques. They shared a home with other Palestinian refugees in Jabal Al Weibdeh, a neighborhood in Amman, Zarqa says. It had a dirt floor and there were no windows, doors or bathrooms. They often couldn\u2019t shower for months at a time. By March 1949, Israel had won the war and forbidden the hundreds of thousands of Palestinian refugees who had fled or were expelled from returning to their homes and ancestral lands. Zarqa\u2019s family was among them. The family began to build a new life in Jordan, one marked by struggle and poverty, as they patiently waited for permission to return to Ein Karem. But it never came, and decades later Zarqa found himself living in the United States \u2013 even further from his homeland \u2013 trying to raise a small family of his own. \u201cWe made a life in the US, but this still isn\u2019t home. You never forget that you had a house and somebody kicked you out of it,\u201d Zarqa says. \u201cWe will never stop wanting to return.\u201d A responsibility to teach Neither time nor distance has blurred Zarqa\u2019s memories of Palestine. He has passed onto his four children and eight grandchildren every bittersweet memory of Ein Karem, from its acres of orchards to the hilltop where he could see the mountains and Mediterranean sea in the distance. Zarqa remembers Ein Karem so vividly that despite his decades of absence, he was able to give his grandson, Zach Matari, who visited the village in 2019, directions over FaceTime to his old home, now in present-day Israel. An Israeli family is living there. \u201cI remember every inch of my village. If you go there I can tell you there was this apricot tree here, and there was a fig tree there, and that\u2019s the stairs we used to climb,\u201d he says. Jenan Matari, another one of his grandchildren, is a writer and social media influencer who uses her platform to educate followers about Palestinian history, culture and current events, including the war in Gaza. She loves listening to her grandfather\u2019s stories and says her work, which is rooted in his Nakba experience, is a form of resistance. All Palestinians in the diaspora, she says, should use their voices too. \u201cI get really sad for my grandfather, because if I\u2019m feeling triggered by the things that are happening in Gaza, and I\u2019m feeling this depleted and in so much pain watching this, I can only imagine what it\u2019s doing to him and his generation to watch what they lived through happening again, but on an even greater scale,\u201d Matari, 33, tells CNN. Talking about al-Nakba isn\u2019t easy, Zarqa confesses. He often pauses mid-sentence or changes the subject when it hurts a bit too much. But he refuses to be silenced by his grief and even invites other Nakba survivors to his home to share their experiences with family, friends and the wider community Dawud Assad, one of those survivors, lives just 10 miles away. He narrowly survived the Deir Yassin massacre, which he says claimed the lives of 47 family members, including his grandmother and 2-year-old brother. \u201cI was supposed to be dead,\u201d says Assad, who is now 92 and nicknamed Al-shaheed Al-hay, or \u201cthe living martyr.\u201d Assad survived by hiding in a shallow trench near his home, crouching and quietly praying for mercy as bullets grazed his hair. \u201cIt did not begin on October 7. What we went through is exactly what we\u2019re seeing now in Gaza and Rafah,\u201d Assad says, referring to Israel\u2019s ongoing war there. Videos of dead children are especially triggering because they remind him of his slain brother. Israel launched its war in Gaza after Hamas\u2019 brutal attack in Israel on October 7, in which 1,200 people were killed and hundreds of others taken hostage, Israeli officials say. In the seven months since that attack, Israel\u2019s bombing campaign and ground offensive in Gaza has killed more than 35,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health. It also has imposed a siege and razed entire communities, rendering nearly 90% of the population displaced and everyone food insecure. Israel says its military tactics are necessary to defeat Hamas and return the hostages. But in a March report for the United Nations\u2019 Human Rights Council, the UN Special Rapporteur on human rights in the Palestinian territories, Francesca Albanese, said there are \u201creasonable grounds\u201d to believe Israel is committing the crime of genocide against Palestinians in Gaza. Israel said it \u201cutterly rejects\u201d the report, which it said \u201cbrings shame\u201d on the council. For Zarqa and Assad, the war is reminiscent of the horrors they endured during al-Nakba, and it\u2019s important for them to draw that parallel for young Palestinians in the diaspora, as well as anyone else trying to make sense of the violence. \u201cAl-Nakba never ended,\u201d Zarqa says. They point to recent statements from Israeli officials that have alluded to another Nakba through suggestions of mass killing and displacement, or outright calling for it. In a November interview with Israel\u2019s Channel 12 news, Minister of Agriculture Avi Dichter described the war as \u201cthe Nakba of Gaza 2023.\u201d Following Dichter\u2019s comments, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reportedly urged ministers to choose their words more carefully. \u201cWe must be sensitive,\u201d he said, according to The Times of Israel. Hope for the future Zarqa\u2019s heart remains torn between nostalgia and grief as he concedes he may never again see his beloved Palestine, stroll through the quiet streets of Ein Karem or taste its delicious apricots. But he\u2019s sure his descendants will. There are some 5.9 million Palestinian refugees worldwide, most of them descendants of that 1948 generation of exiles, according to the United Nations. It is \u201cthe world\u2019s longest-standing protracted refugee crisis,\u201d the UN said at a 2023 event marking the 75th anniversary of al-Nakba as it urged a solution grounded in international law. While some countries, including the United States and United Kingdom, skipped the commemoration after Israel called for a boycott, Zarqa elsewhere sees hope: The anti-war protests taking over city streets and college campuses across the world. \u201cI am so proud of them,\u201d Zarqa says. \u201cYou pass on your stories to your children and then they carry the banner and continue to teach their children, and eventually their own grandchildren.\u201d \u201cPalestinians will never forget.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/us/nakba-day-anniversary-palestinians/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/25/2024", "section": "us"}}

{"id": "2024_05_23_politics_senators-trudeau-letter-defense-spending", "text": "A bipartisan group of\u00a023\u00a0US senators\u00a0have written\u00a0to Canadian Prime Minister\u00a0Justin Trudeau\u00a0urging\u00a0his country\u00a0to live up to its commitment\u00a0to spend 2% of GDP on defense amid\u00a0concerns\u00a0that key members of the NATO alliance are not pulling their weight. \u201cAs we approach the 2024 NATO Summit in Washington, D.C., we are concerned and profoundly disappointed that Canada\u2019s most recent projection indicated that it will not reach its two percent commitment this decade,\u201d the senators wrote. \u201cIn 2029, Canada\u2019s defense spending is estimated to rise to just 1.7 percent, five years after the agreed upon deadline of 2024 and still below the spending baseline.\u201d The rare letter from lawmakers to a head of state comes about two months before NATO\u2019s next annual summit in Washington, DC, which will mark the alliance\u2019s 75th\u00a0anniversary\u00a0as Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine continues. At last year\u2019s leader-level summit, the allies agreed that each member nation should spend at least\u00a02% of its GDP on defense. The senators pointed to that agreement in making their case for Canada to live up to the commitment. And the senators\u00a0\u2014\u00a0including Republicans Mitt Romney of Utah and Ted Cruz of Texas as well as Democrats Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire and Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, among others \u2014\u00a0argued that if Canada falls short of its commitment, it will hurt\u00a0NATO. \u201cCanada will fail to meet its obligations to the Alliance, to the detriment of all NATO Allies and the free world, without immediate and meaningful action to increase defense spending,\u201d the senators\u00a0wrote. Canada is a founding member of the defensive alliance, which now has 32 member nations. The senators noted the contributions Canada has made to\u00a0NATO on multiple fronts, including taking a leading role in support of\u00a0its military operations and developing standards around democracy, economic resilience and human rights. But the senators also pointed out that many other nations are taking the necessary steps to hit and exceed\u00a0the 2% target. \u201cBy the end of 2024, 18 NATO countries will meet the Alliance\u2019s goal to ensure NATO\u2019s continued military readiness. This is a historic investment in our collective security, led by NATO Allies like Poland, a country that has already exceeded three percent of its GDP for defense spending,\u201d they wrote. Canadian Defense Minister Bill Blair responded to the letter on Thursday by saying that \u201cCanada is on a very strong upward trajectory in defense spending,\u201d adding \u201cwe know we\u2019ve got work to do.\u201d Blair did not offer a specific timeline for when the country plans to hit the 2% commitment. \u201cOur work has begun but there\u2019s a great deal of work to do. It\u2019s really important that when we\u2019re spending hard earned Canadian taxpayers dollars that we spend them well,\u201d he said. Earlier this year,\u00a0NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said that he expects Canada to \u201cdeliver on the pledge\u201d or else details plans for reaching the target spending. More than a dozen\u00a0other NATO members \u2014 including Spain, Turkey and the Netherlands \u2014have also so far fallen short of the alliance\u2019s target. But the senators chose to write to Trudeau because\u00a0they believe Canada \u2014\u00a0unlike other nations\u00a0\u2014  does not appear to have a plan in place to hit the target, a congressional aide explained. While the letter does not mention former President\u00a0Donald\u00a0Trump, the\u00a0presumptive\u00a0GOP presidential nominee has had a real impact on the ongoing efforts to get alliance members to spend\u00a0more. During his presidency Trump\u00a0repeatedly\u00a0pressed\u00a0members to contribute more to the alliance,\u00a0and to spend more on defense spending overall. Europeans are also concerned about what Trump might do in a possible second term when it comes to NATO. If he wins the election in November, Trump\u00a0will consider pushing for a two-tier NATO, CNN\u00a0has previously reported.\u00a0That would mean countries that\u00a0don\u2019t meet the\u00a02% of\u00a0GDP\u00a0spending\u00a0commitment would not be protected by NATO\u2019s Article 5, which guarantees that the resources of the whole alliance can be used to protect any single member nation if it\u2019s attacked.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/23/politics/senators-trudeau-letter-defense-spending/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/25/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_05_21_us_moose-kills-alaska-man", "text": "A 70-year-old man was killed by a cow moose after he tried to take photos of the animal and its newborn calves near his home in southern Alaska on Sunday, authorities said. The man, Dale Chorman, was with a friend when the pair spotted a female moose and her two newborn calves in the city of Homer, the Alaska Department of Public Safety said. \u201cDale was with another adult male and they were attempting to take photos of two newborn moose calves when the cow moose attacked Dale,\u201d agency spokesperson Austin McDaniel told CNN in an email Tuesday. An\u00a0initial report\u00a0says the moose charged the two men and kicked one of them. The other man was not injured, McDaniel said. Chorman\u2019s body was sent to the Alaska State Medical Examiner\u2019s Office for an autopsy. CNN has sought more information from the medical examiner. Chorman\u2019s relatives are now remembering him as a loving father, husband and friend. However, they also are urging people to not blame the moose for his death. \u201cThe moose, obviously, is not at fault. To the concerned neighbors, I say \u2014 quell your primate spear rattling. The ungulate mother need not die. She was just protecting her offspring,\u201d Dale\u2019s son, Nathan Chorman, wrote in a statement, according to CNN affiliate KTUU. Dale was experienced around wildlife, according to his family. He\u2019d said the previous day that the brush was thick enough to come across a wild animal by accident, Nathan wrote. \u201cI\u2019m sure Dale was surprised too. On a given day, nobody expects to die on their own property doing something routine, even when the routine is fairly dangerous. But he would have accepted this outcome,\u201d Nathan\u2019s statement reads. \u201cThis was not a hapless fool stumbling into danger \u2014 this was a person who went out looking for a great photo, knowing the risks, and got caught in a dangerous moment,\u201d the son wrote. A small adult female moose can weigh up to 800 pounds and be up to 6 feet tall, according to the\u00a0Alaska Department of Fish and Game. While in the company of her calves, a female moose will not hesitate to attack should a person come near them, McDaniel said. \u201cCow moose with calves are known to be relentless in their efforts to defend their calves from perceived threats,\u201d McDaniel said. \u201cThe Alaska wildlife troopers encourage Alaskans to not approach moose calves to take photos or attempt to pet them as there is likely a cow moose nearby.\u201d Homer is about 220 miles south of Anchorage on Alaska\u2019s Kenai Peninsula.

{"id": "2024_05_19_us_pennsylvania-pastor-glenn-germany-church-safety", "text": "In the years Pastor Glenn Germany has been leading the small congregation at Jesus\u2019 Dwelling Place, keeping the Pennsylvania church\u2019s doors open has been a struggle. Germany, a full-time bus driver and full-time pastor, knows how important this church is to its community. In addition to religious services, the church \u2013 in the North Braddock borough southeast of Pittsburgh \u2013 provides its primarily low and fixed-income congregants with housing advice, domestic violence and mental health awareness programs, and seminars on everything from improving health to credit scores. To keep it all running, Germany and his family give more than $1,000 out of pocket every month. And now, it seems there\u2019s another critical expense, though one this small church hardly could afford: security. It\u2019s been exactly two weeks since an armed intruder walked into Jesus\u2019 Dwelling Place, pointed a gun at Germany\u2019s head and pulled the trigger, the horrific scene captured via a livestream of the Sunday service. When the gunman tried to fire, though, his weapon jammed, giving the pastor and a cameraman enough time to rush and subdue the suspect until authorities came. Police have not shared what may have motivated the gunman to target the pastor. Germany has said the shooter told him \u201cspirits\u201d got into his head. Then less than a week later, parishioners in south Louisiana helped remove a 16-year-old boy who walked into a Catholic church armed with a gun. The two incidents came roughly three months after law enforcement killed a woman who opened fire inside Lakewood Church in Houston; a 57-year-old man and the shooter\u2019s 7-year-old son were wounded. Now, Germany wants to hire security experts to assess his church\u2019s vulnerability and see how they can secure it. But in the two weeks since the thwarted attack, the church has only been able to raise just over $1,000 in donations, the pastor said. Experts told CNN safety additions such as vulnerability assessments, training, cameras and security personnel can cost several thousand dollars. \u201cIt costs money to hire people, and we don\u2019t have the money,\u201d Germany said. It\u2019s a challenge for religious communities across the US as churches, synagogues, mosques and other places of worship face threats or come under attack in a nation with more guns than people and where shots often explode in places that should be safe. US Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer this month announced an additional $400 million in federal money to help boost security at places of worship. Many places of worship have struggled to balance security while maintaining a warm, welcoming feeling for their attendees. And Germany\u2019s challenges highlight just how much harder conversations around security can be for smaller congregations. \u2018Nothing is sacred, secure or safe\u2019 In San Antonio, the faithful at Pastor Kevin Nelson\u2019s Calvary Baptist Church began new conversations around security after the attack on Lakewood Church, the megachurch of famed televangelist Joel Osteen. Nelson\u2019s church already has cameras and an alarm system \u2013 but those were primarily installed to thwart car break-ins, he said. Calvary Baptist, with roughly 300 regular service attendees, also enlists deacons and other church members who carry concealed weapons to monitor the single entrance it keeps open during services, Nelson said. And it hosts active shooter trainings led by the local sheriff\u2019s office. But now, all that doesn\u2019t feel like enough. \u201cI don\u2019t want our church to become almost like a bank, to where you pull up and you see the police, so I\u2019m really wrestling,\u201d Nelson, a former deputy with the sheriff\u2019s department, told CNN. \u201cBut in the same sense, God\u2019s people and God\u2019s house have to be protected.\u201d Not too far away is an ever-persistent reminder of the threat: Calvary Baptist is just about a 40-minute drive from Sutherland Springs, where a shooter killed 26 people inside a community church in 2017.\u00a0It remains the state\u2019s deadliest mass shooting. Nelson\u2019s church is now considering hiring armed guards, he said. Its leaders are also looking into the federal grant money Schumer announced, though it is a new process requiring time and research, Nelson said. And since the Lakewood Church shooting, during which the attacker walked in with her young son and a rifle, churchgoers at Calvary Baptist have been instructed to be watchful of families entering services, he said. \u201cWhat we\u2019re discovering,\u201d Nelson said, \u201cis nothing is sacred, secure or safe.\u201d Donell Trusty Jr., who provides security and firearms training for places of worship in Maryland through his company Trusty Training Solutions, has seen an uptick in phone calls from churches\u00a0since the attempted shooting in Pennsylvania two weeks ago, he said. Trusty, who is also an elder in his Baltimore church, said he also helps churches contract security officers. He also helps train church volunteers who are licensed to carry weapons in firearm safety, self-defense and situational awareness, he told CNN. Typically, Trusty said, hiring security personnel can cost between $35 and $50 per person hourly. Training courses usually cost $250 to $300 per person, he said. To help out local congregations, Trusty\u2019s company has begun offering free active shooter training to places of worship. \u201cIt is our way of giving back to the local assemblies because it\u2019s what\u2019s needed,\u201d he said. \u201cWe understand the financial crises of the pandemic, membership has been low in a lot of churches \u2026 (and) they don\u2019t really have the finances to put out for some expensive training program.\u201d And active shooter training can help save lives. Rabbi Charlie Cytron-Walker has credited his training in this arena for helping him make a daring escape in 2022 after a hostage-taker joined a worship service at Congregation Beth Israel in Texas. As the attack approached its 11th hour, the rabbi spotted a key moment when the gunman\u2019s guard was down \u2013 just as he had learned in training \u2013 and told others to run, then grabbed a chair and threw it at the assailant, giving the hostages enough time to escape with their lives. Churches now should take an opportunity to renew conversations around safety, conduct risk assessments and reevaluate their security procedures, said Bishop Vashti Murphy McKenzie, president and general secretary of the National Council of the Churches of Christ in the USA, which represents more than 100,000 congregations. Among factors to consider are identifying church members with a background in law enforcement, the military or security, McKenzie said. Other key steps include conducting drills, ensuring all church members know where the nearest exit is or where to go during an emergency, and knowing who would contact authorities if needed, McKenzie said. \u201cSurely, we would all love to believe that it\u2019s not going to happen here, it\u2019s not going to be us. But why take the chance? Let\u2019s prepare,\u201d she said. Every year, the Churches of Christ council hosts discussions \u2013 including about security \u2013 for leaders of Jewish, Muslim, Hindu, Christian and other faiths, McKenzie said. In those spaces, she added, religious leaders have an opportunity to \u201ccompare notes\u201d and learn from each other. A difficult balance for many pastors Nelson, in San Antonio, often thinks about nearby smaller congregations that typically don\u2019t have the financial or human resources to bolster security measures in the same way his church can, he said. He encourages churches to station at least one person to monitor each entrance, and he has tried to spread the word about the federal grant program. Schumer, too, noted the additional challenges smaller congregations face. \u201cFEMA has people who will help if you\u2019re a small synagogue or a small church or a small mosque and you don\u2019t have a grant writer, you don\u2019t know what to do,\u201d he said. Schumer\u2019s May 5 news conference followed a series of hoax bomb threats the prior day against New York synagogues, he said. Places of worship that apply for federal money for bolstered security, such as guards and fences, may be able to get those resources within \u201cmonths,\u201d Schumer said, pointing potential grant recipients to the agency\u2019s website and urging them to apply by Tuesday. Florida-based security company SecureTek Service Group Inc. has been helping low-resource places of worship, including Germany\u2019s church, navigate applications for grants and other types of funding, its founder Rico Reed told CNN. Often, churches with little funding don\u2019t know what kinds of resources are available, and security additions can be costly, with vulnerability assessments in some cases reaching up to $2,000, while camera systems can cost several thousand dollars, he said. \u201cA House of Worship is supposed to be a safe place,\u201d Reed said. \u201cBut it\u2019s actually a soft target. And it takes a while for people that are part of the congregation to understand that times have changed. And it\u2019s really dangerous.\u201d In Tennessee, Lori Morrison has long been talking about the importance of church security, on both her website and her podcast. A former private investigator and now a volunteer on her own church\u2019s security team, Morrison said there\u2019s a tough balance between keeping a church secure and welcoming. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to lock the doors and issue passes,\u201d she said. \u201cBut you can take those common sense precautions.\u201d At her church, team members observe people as they arrive, while others check badges in sensitive areas, like the children\u2019s section, to ensure only approved members enter. There are also trainings throughout the year on safety and preparation for medical emergencies, Morrison said. \u201cWe are supposed to look out for (congregants\u2019) well-being, and so we have to make sure that we\u2019re doing that at the same time that we\u2019re maintaining that openness,\u201d she said. In Pennsylvania, Germany admits he worried before the attempted shooting some parishioners would feel uncomfortable with officers around, or added security could make the church less welcoming. But two weeks ago, someone tried to kill him, he said. And he worries it may happen again. Now, his focus is to make his church safe. He hopes to raise more money, get help to apply for grants, and take all the measures necessary to ensure his community can practice its faith in peace. He hopes other churches \u2013 big and small \u2013 do the same. \u201cI would encourage other churches to use our video as just a springboard to start having thoughts about church security,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause you never think it\u2019s going to happen to you \u2013 until it happens to you.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/19/us/pennsylvania-pastor-glenn-germany-church-safety/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/25/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_05_23_us_scottie-scheffler-arrest-update-louisville", "text": "Louisville police released two videos Thursday showing some of the arrest of star golfer Scottie Scheffler last week and announced the detective who arrested him was disciplined for not turning on his body-worn camera at the time. One video from a fixed pole camera positioned across the street shows portions of the interaction between Scheffler and police. In the video, a vehicle turns left and an officer wearing reflective gear runs toward the vehicle, which then stops. Police then take the driver out of the car and a group of three people walk across the street. A second video from a police vehicle\u2019s dashcam shows two officers walking with a handcuffed Scheffler. The videos were released a week after Scheffler was arrested, charged with felony assault, released from jail and then made his tee time in a whirlwind few hours at the PGA Championship, one of golf\u2019s four major tournaments. The world no. 1 golfer was attempting to drive to the Valhalla Golf Club in Louisville for the second round of the tournament at about 6 a.m. when he came to the scene of a fatal crash. He allegedly injured a police officer who was directing traffic and was arrested, according to police. Scheffler, 27, a new father with a sterling reputation, was charged with felony second-degree assault on a police officer, along with lesser charges of third-degree criminal mischief, reckless driving and disregarding signals from officers directing traffic, according to Jefferson County court records. After taking a mug shot and warming up in a jail cell, he was released and made it to his tee time at the golf club. He then shot 5-under that day on his way to finishing the tournament in a tie for 8th place. Scheffler described the incident as a \u201cbig misunderstanding\u201d during a \u201cchaotic situation.\u201d After the news conference Thursday, Scheffler\u2019s attorney, Steve Romines, reiterated the golfer still plans to plead not guilty to the charges. \u201cIt won\u2019t impact my case at all. Our position is the same as it was last Friday: Scottie Scheffler didn\u2019t do anything wrong. We\u2019re not interested in settling the case. We will either try it or it\u2019ll be dismissed. It\u2019s very simple,\u201d he said. \u201cAll the evidence that continues to come out just continues to support what Scottie said all along, this was a chaotic situation and a miscommunication and he didn\u2019t do anything wrong.\u201d High-ranking police officials in Louisville have privately voiced concerns a felony charge against Scheffler is excessive, a source familiar with the discussions told CNN. Prosecutors said Thursday they continue to investigate the case. \u201cThe Jefferson County Attorney\u2019s office has continued to receive evidence and has yet to conduct final interviews with investigators regarding the charges filed by LMPD against Mr. Scheffler,\u201d said Josh Abner, a spokesman for the office. \u201cAs we have stated previously, no decisions have been made and our review continues.\u201d Scheffler, meanwhile, teed off for his first round at the Charles Schwab Challenge in Fort Worth, Texas, on Thursday afternoon. Police discipline detective for not activating body-worn camera At a news conference Thursday, Louisville\u2019s mayor and police chief announced an internal investigation of the case led to discipline for the arresting officer, Detective Bryan Gillis. \u201cDetective Gillis should have turned on his body-worn camera, but did not,\u201d Police Chief Jacquelyn Gwinn-Villaroel said. \u201cHis failure to do so is a violation of the LMPD policy on uniforms and equipment, subject category body-worn camera.\u201d The police chief said Gillis did not have his body-worn camera \u201coperationally ready\u201d as required. The detective has received \u201ccorrective action,\u201d said the chief, who did not provide specifics about the discipline at the news conference. A Louisville police memo the department subsequently released Thursday said the detective \u201cwas counseled by a member of his command on May 22, 2024, and a performance observation was completed.\u201d The memo was among documents released related to the detective\u2019s failure to activate his body-worn camera. In one, Gillis explained he \u201cnever powered up\u201d the camera and described his own version of what happened. \u201cWhile directing traffic in front of Gate 1 the PGA personnel stopped a bus from entering Gate 1,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI observed a vehicle traveling in the opposing lanes coming at me. I stopped the driver and advised him he could not proceed because of the bus. He demanded to be let in, and proceeded forward against my directions. I was dragged/knocked down by the driver. I then proceeded to arrest the driver.\u201d Neither Mayor Craig Greenberg nor the police chief took questions from the media at Thursday\u2019s news conference. \u201cActivating body-worn cameras is critically important for our police department to have evidence, to maintain community trust, to be transparent,\u201d Greenberg said. Documents obtained by CNN show Gillis has a history of both reprimands and suspensions within the police department. Gillis, who began his service in 2007,\u00a0has received six reprimands throughout his time with Louisville police, a disciplinary history report shows.\u00a0He has also been suspended on five separate occasions. None of Gillis\u2019 prior suspensions involved failing to turn on his body-worn camera. Records also show Gillis has received several commendations during his career, including back-to-back Meritorious Unit Citations in 2019. The detective\u2019s longest suspension at five days stems from a 2012 incident in which\u00a0Gillis allegedly drove an \u201cintoxicated civilian\u201d in his police vehicle while doing \u201cdonuts\u201d in a business parking lot while his emergency lights were illuminated, according to a 2013 LMPD document. More recently, in 2021, Gillis received a written reprimand for pursuing \u201ca vehicle that did not commit a violent felony or wanted on a warrant,\u201d\u00a0documents show. Additionally, Gillis did not tell dispatchers he was engaging in a vehicle pursuit at the time, according to LMPD documents. The year prior, in 2012, he faced a four-day suspension for failing to appear in court on multiple occasions between 2010 and 2011. Documents show Gillis was also found \u201cat fault\u201d for three crashes, for which he received reprimands and mandatory driver\u2019s training. CNN has reached out to the Louisville Police Department for comment and was told \u201cas this matter is before the courts, commenting further on the participants (defendants, witnesses, and victims alike) is not appropriate for us to do.\u201d Gillis did not immediately respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment Friday. CNN has also reached out to\u00a0the River City Fraternal Order of Police Lodge 614, the union representing LMPD detectives, for comment on Gillis\u2019 past conduct. What we know about the arrest According to a Louisville Metro Police report, Scheffler was trying to drive into the golf course when he was stopped by an officer wearing a full police uniform and a yellow reflective rain jacket. The officer, identified as Gillis, stopped Scheffler and \u201cattempted to give instructions,\u201d the report states. \u201cSubject refused to comply and accelerated forward, dragging Detective Gillis to the ground,\u201d according to the report. The detective suffered pain, swelling and abrasions to his left wrist and knee and was taken to the hospital for further treatment, the report states. His uniform pants, valued at about $80, \u201cwere damaged beyond repair,\u201d the report adds. Romines, Scheffler\u2019s attorney, said the golfer was headed to the course early to prepare to play. \u201cDue to the combination of event traffic and a traffic fatality in the area, it was a very chaotic situation. He was proceeding as directed by another traffic officer and driving a marked player\u2019s vehicle with credentials visible,\u201d Romines said in a statement. \u201cIn the confusion, Scottie is alleged to have disregarded a different officer\u2019s traffic signals resulting in these charges.\u201d Multiple eyewitnesses have said Scheffler \u201cdid not do anything wrong\u201d but drove as directed, according to Romines. \u201cHe stopped immediately upon being directed to and never at any point assaulted any officer with his vehicle,\u201d the statement reads. ESPN\u2019s Jeff Darlington witnessed the encounter and filmed part of it. When Scheffler arrived in a marked player courtesy vehicle, he tried to drive around the crash scene on a median, according to ESPN. Darlington wrote on social media Scheffler \u201ccontinued to drive about 10 to 20 yards toward the entrance\u201d before stopping. \u201cThe police officer attempted to attach himself to Scheffler\u2019s car, and Scheffler then stopped his vehicle at the entrance to Valhalla,\u201d Darlington\u00a0wrote on X. \u201cThe police officer then began to scream at Scheffler to get out of the car. When Scheffler exited the vehicle, the officer shoved Scheffler against the car and immediately placed him in handcuffs.\u201d Police escorted a handcuffed Scheffler into a police vehicle, Darlington\u2019s video shows. \u201cRight now he\u2019s going to jail,\u201d an officer at the scene says in the video. Scheffler\u2019s arraignment was originally scheduled for Tuesday but was delayed to June due to his attorney\u2019s scheduling issue.

The resignation of Joshua Gutierrez, chief of police for the Uvalde Consolidated Independent School District, will be presented for approval at a June 17 school board meeting, according to district spokesperson Anne Marie Espinoza. If approved, his last day will be June 26, according to the KSAT report. Details about the reasons for the resignation weren\u2019t immediately available. CNN has sought comment from Gutierrez and the school district. \u201cWe thank Chief Gutierrez for his dedicated leadership and guidance in reestablishing the Uvalde CISD Police Department,\u201d Espinoza said in the statement. \u201cHis contributions have been instrumental in enhancing the safety and well-being of our students, staff, and school community.\u201d Gutierrez replaced Pete Arredondo, who was fired in August 2022 following scrutiny of his actions during the May 2022 shooting in which 19 students and two teachers were killed at Robb Elementary School. Law enforcement officers waited more than an hour before entering adjoining classrooms where the gunman was and killing him. A US Department of Justice report said officers had many opportunities to intervene to stop the bloodshed far earlier. Arredondo was\u00a0seen on police body-worn cameras\u00a0giving orders and receiving information during the response, but he has said he did not see himself as the incident commander. Gutierrez was approved unanimously as the interim police chief in November 2022, and was named\u00a0permanent\u00a0chief in March 2023. \u201cThis is our first step (we are) taking to rebuild our school district police force,\u201d Gary Patterson, then the interim superintendent, said when Gutierrez was named interim chief. As interim police chief, Gutierrez focused on hiring qualified officers, conducting tactical cross-training with local law enforcement and engaging students and the community, according to KSAT, which reported he\u2019d previously worked at several other school districts. \u201cI have the ability to come out here and help the community heal, help our community heal, and the abilities to reestablish a good foundation for our police department,\u201d Gutierrez said in December 2022, according to KSAT. The district has begun a search to replace Gutierrez and has posted the job on its website. \u201cUnder general supervision, this officer performs tasks related to ensuring the safety of UCISD students, staff, and visitors,\u201d the posting says. \u201cAdditionally, the officer provides classroom presentations, counsels students and parents, engages students through mentoring, and serves as a positive role model to help promote healthy relationships between youth and law enforcement.\u201d Among the requirements for the position, the district is looking for someone with a minimum of five years of senior level experience directing law enforcement operations, according to the posting. A candidate should have the \u201cability to effectively deal with personal danger which may include sudden exposure to armed persons,\u201d the posting says. \u201cWe are committed to finding a successor who will continue to uphold the standards of safety and security that our school community deserves,\u201d Espinoza said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/us/uvalde-school-district-police-chief-resignation/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/25/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_05_22_us_california-half-moon-bay-farms-settlements", "text": "Two mushroom farms in Northern California agreed to pay more than $450,000 in back wages and damages for dozens of employees stemming from a federal work- and living-conditions investigation that started after seven people were fatally shot there in 2023, the US Department of Labor said this week. The investigation into California Terra Gardens and Concord Farms Inc. in Half Moon Bay found the employers underpaid workers and provided unsafe housing conditions with mold and insect infestation, the Labor Department said in a news release Monday. The back wages and damages are part of administrative settlements the department reached with the two farms for multiple violations of the\u00a0Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act\u00a0and the\u00a0Fair Labor Standards Act, the department said. \u201cOur investigators found workers at California Terra Gardens and Concord Farms housed in sickening conditions, forced to sleep near garbage and with insects all around,\u201d Alberto Raymond, the department\u2019s wage and hour division assistant district director, said in the release. At California Terra Gardens, investigators uncovered that 39 workers were housed in cramped cargo containers, garages and dilapidated trailers, according to the department. They were forced to sleep on filthy mattresses and were exposed to insects and trash, according to the labor department. The farm\u2019s owners deducted money from workers\u2019 pay for the substandard housing illegally, the department determined. Two miles away, investigators found workers at Concord Farms were housed in moldy, makeshift rooms in a greenhouse infested with insects, the department said. That farm\u2019s owner shortchanged workers by not paying overtime past 40 hours worked in a week, and by not paying for work off the clock, the department said. The federal investigation started after a shooting in which authorities allege a California Terra Gardens worker, Chunil Zhao, killed seven workers and injured another at the two farms on January 23, 2023. Zhao, a Chinese citizen who was 66 at the time, was arrested that month and pleaded not guilty this year to seven counts of first-degree murder and one count of attempted murder. He is awaiting trial. Zhao was a coworker or former coworker of the victims, and evidence indicated the attack was an instance of workplace violence in which specific people were targeted, the San Mateo County sheriff said at the time. After the shooting, officials including the state\u2019s governor criticized living conditions on the farms, and state and federal investigations into the conditions were launched. In June, the farms were cited by the California Division of Occupational Safety and Health for \u201cserious\u201d health and safety violations. Following the federal Labor Department investigation, Concord Farms agreed to pay $370,107 in overtime wages and liquidated damages to 10 workers, $4,242 in late wages to 23 workers and $29,049 in civil money penalties, the release said. California Terra Gardens agreed to pay $84,074 to 39 workers for illegal housing deductions and $42,494 in civil money penalties, the department said. CNN has sought comment from California Terra Gardens and Concord Farms. \u201cThe Department of Labor is determined to hold employers accountable when they ignore their legal responsibilities to provide suitable housing when required and pay workers all their legally earned wages for the hard work they do in difficult conditions,\u201d Raymond said. \u201cWe are committed to enforcing these workplace protections that ensure a safe and suitable living conditions for seasonal workers.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/us/california-half-moon-bay-farms-settlements/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/25/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_05_24_business_us-economy-whats-happening", "text": "The US economy is giving off weird vibes right now. There are millions of job openings and the unemployment rate is low. In fact, it hasn\u2019t been this low for such a long stretch of time in decades. You\u2019d think that would mean the economy is coasting, since periods of low unemployment are generally associated with higher rates of economic prosperity. But there\u2019s a slew of red flags right now \u2014 like a large and growing share of people, particularly Gen Zers, taking on such high levels of credit card debt to cover their spending that lenders have stopped loaning more money to them. That seems to be the case with a lot of recent economic data: No piece of good news comes without other evidence that give economists pause. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t give the economy a clean bill of health,\u201d said Gregory Daco, chief economist at EY. \u201cIt looks robust, but there are pockets of concern.\u201d But while the state of the economy has economists weighing their words, presidential candidates see it in more binary terms. For instance, President Joe Biden tells voters the economy is booming and has hardly ever been doing better \u2014 even though, as he frequently says, there\u2019s still work to be done. Yet from former President Donald Trump\u2019s vantage point, \u201cthe economy is crashing\u201d and is in total disarray, he said at a recent campaign rally in Wisconsin. Here\u2019s what\u2019s really going on. The good If you\u2019re already optimistic about the economy\u2019s current state, you\u2019re going to feel even better by parsing through some of the latest labor market data. Currently, there are 8.5 million job openings. That exceeds the number of pre-pandemic job openings by 1.5 million. Meanwhile, there are 6.5 million unemployed people. That means there\u2019s more than one job per job seeker. In the decade preceding the pandemic, that ratio was 0.6 on average, signifying there were more job seekers than the number of job openings. Americans\u2019 average hourly earnings are 22% higher than before the pandemic, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data. Though wage increases have been slowing, they\u2019re rising at a faster rate than prices. That\u2019s good news for consumers, since it means their income is stretching further. The bad Though inflation has cooled significantly from its peak in the summer of 2022, further progress toward the Federal Reserve\u2019s 2% target is looking like it\u2019ll be a lengthy process. That trajectory has taken many Fed officials by surprise, including Gov. Christopher Waller who thought the economy would be in a good position for cutting interest rates by now. \u201cHowever, the first three months of 2024 threw cold water on that outlook, as data on both inflation and economic activity came in much hotter than anticipated,\u201d Waller said in a speech Tuesday. But he said April Consumer Price Index data, which showed headline inflation levels cooled slightly, was \u201cwelcome relief.\u201d \u201cIf I were still a professor and had to assign a grade to this inflation report, it would be a C+\u2014 far from failing but not stellar either,\u201d he added. But at the same time,\u00a0consumers believe that inflation will move higher in the year ahead, according to two surveys Fed officials monitor closely. Since inflation expectations can effectively control the pace of price hikes, businesses take those expectations into account when pricing goods and services. That can lead to higher prices. However, an early reading on retail spending for April came in much weaker than expected as consumers reined in their spending. That\u2019s good in the sense that it doesn\u2019t give retailers the ability to pass along higher prices to consumers if they aren\u2019t willing to accept them, which had previously been the case. But given consumer spending is one of the biggest drivers of the economy, a pullback can have adverse effects, too. \u201cIt certainly bears watching, but part of the weakness probably was \u2018payback\u2019 for strength in prior months,\u201d David Alcaly, lead macroeconomic strategist at Lazard, told CNN. Daco said he sees the retail sales report as a sign that consumers are \u201ca little more cautious, but are not retrenching.\u201d However, if spending starts to slow a lot more, that could negatively impact the economy, he said. The ugly The biggest flashing red light in the economy right now is the level of debt people are racking up. One reason consumer spending has held up so well in the face of higher-than-desirable inflation combined with the highest interest rates in over two decades is that consumers aren\u2019t necessarily spending within their means. The savings many accumulated during the pandemic have all but evaporated, leading to a lot more credit card purchases that aren\u2019t being paid back on time. That, combined with the gradually cooling labor market \u2014 which is reducing workers\u2019 leverage \u2014 is causing some households to accumulate more debt and fall into serious delinquency, meaning 90+ days late on a payment. Recent New York Fed data showed the percentage of credit card balances in serious delinquency climbed to its highest level since 2012. \u201cThe rising levels of consumer\u00a0debt\u00a0and delinquency rates, if continued, are not just individual problems; they could have macroeconomic effects requiring attention from economic policymakers,\u201d Sung Won Sohn, a Loyola Marymount University economics and finance professor and chief economist of SS Economics, wrote in a recent note. \u201cAs more income is directed toward\u00a0debt\u00a0repayment, consumers have less disposable income for other purchases.\u201d The rising delinquencies will likely force banks and other lenders to lend less money to borrowers deemed riskier or cause lenders to charge even higher interest rates, he said. Ultimately, these combined effects \u201ccan contribute to a broader economic slowdown \u2014 or even a recession.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/24/business/us-economy-whats-happening/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/25/2024", "section": "us"}}

She said she then attempted to grab another Communion bread, which the priest was holding, when he grabbed and bit her arm, the affidavit states. \u201cFather Rodriguez offered the woman Holy Communion on the tongue. At that point, the woman forcefully placed her hand in the vessel and grabbed some sacred Communion hosts, crushing them,\u201d according to the Diocese\u2019s statement on the incident. \u201cHaving only one hand free, Father Rodriguez struggled to restrain the woman as she refused to let go of the hosts. When the woman pushed him and reacting to a perceived act of aggression, Father Rodriguez bit her hand so she would let go of the hosts she grabbed,\u201d the statement continued. The woman was asked to leave, according to the Diocese, which added the priest had not met her before. When interviewed by police, the priest told the investigating officer the woman had pushed him and \u201cwould not let go of the communion tray and the only way he thought to extract her from it was to bite her arm,\u201d according to the affidavit. \u201cIn the Catholic Tradition, the Eucharist is considered \u2018the source and summit\u2019 of worship and faith. The act of participation in Holy Communion therefore calls for a proper understanding, reverence, and devotion,\u201d the statement from the Diocese reads. \u201cIt is not something a person can arbitrarily demand and is certainly not a mere \u2018cookie\u2019 as the complainant called it,\u201d the statement adds. The woman refused medical attention and police photographed the bite mark, according to the affidavit. St. Cloud Police have forwarded the affidavit summary of events to the State Attorney\u2019s Office for review. The Ninth Judicial Circuit State Attorney\u2019s Office told CNN in a statement on Friday, \u201cWe have received the case and it is currently under review to determine the appropriate course of action.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/24/us/st-cloud-fl-priest-communion-dispute/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/25/2024", "section": "us"}}
