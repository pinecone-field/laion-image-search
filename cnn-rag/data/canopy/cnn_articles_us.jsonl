{"id": "us_queer-meaning-lgbtq-cec", "text": "For most of its\u00a0early\u00a0history, the word \u201cqueer\u201d\u00a0meant\u00a0unusual or out of the ordinary. Then it was co-opted as a homophobic insult for much of the 20th century before people from\u00a0LGBT\u00a0communities\u00a0reclaimed the term. Then, LGBTQ activists who identified as queer\u00a0showed that they were proud to be different. LGBTQ activist groups like Queer Nation chanted \u201cWe\u2019re here! We\u2019re queer! Get used to it!\u201d as a unifying call to action for all LGBTQ people. Now, queer is an identifier preferred by some LGBTQ people for its expansive and fluid nature, though others reject the word because of how it was used in the past. For\u00a0many of\u00a0those who embrace the term queer, identity isn\u2019t fixed \u2013\u2013 it evolves, and \u201cqueer\u201d can encapsulate both sexuality and gender identity throughout a person\u2019s life. \u201cQueerness is cloudy by definition \u2013\u2013\u00a0essentially, what is not the norm,\u201d said Maya Satya Reddy, founder of the Queer Asian Social Club, a collective that advocates for improved visibility of LGBTQ Asian Americans in media. \u201cI think queerness gave and still gives me a lot of space to flow between identities or what something means to me on that day.\u201d Here\u2019s what it means to be the Q in LGBTQ. What queer means today Queer is an expansive term used by some LGBTQ people to describe their sexuality, gender identity or both. It\u00a0may be\u00a0preferred by those who find other terms like \u201cgay\u201d or \u201cbisexual\u201d too restrictive or narrow, as well as\u00a0some people\u00a0whose identities are fluid and evolving. \u201c(Queer) includes all of the identities and lived experiences that are included under the LGBTQ acronym \u2013\u2013 folks that might otherwise identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender,\u201d said Samuel Allen, a clinical assistant professor at Northwestern University and a therapist at its Family Institute, where he focuses on LGBTQ health\u00a0and wellbeing. People who are nonbinary \u2013\u2013\u00a0that is,\u00a0those whose gender identity does not fall within the binary categories of man or woman, or who do not identify with any gender\u00a0\u2013\u2013\u00a0might also identify as queer, Allen said. The term may suit people who have a less strict or static relationship to gender. The history of how queer was used against LGBTQ people Queer was used as a relatively innocuous word when it entered the English lexicon in the early 16th century. Then, \u201cqueer\u201d meant peculiar, odd, or out of place, said Gregory Coles, a language scholar who\u00a0has\u00a0studied the histories of slurs\u00a0and how they\u2019re reclaimed by the marginalized people they\u2019re used against. \u201cQueer\u201d wasn\u2019t used as a homophobic slur, it\u2019s thought, until the end of the 19th century,\u00a0Coles said.\u00a0In a private letter in 1894,\u00a0the British nobleman\u00a0John Douglas\u00a0derisively referred\u00a0to men attracted to other men as \u201csnob queers,\u201d\u00a0including the Irish playwright Oscar Wilde, with whom one of his sons had a relationship, according to the United Kingdom\u2019s National Archives. The playwright sued Douglas for libel, but when the letter was made public, charges of gross indecency were brought against Wilde \u2013\u2013\u00a0homosexual acts were illegal in the UK, where Wilde had been living. Wilde was eventually\u00a0convicted and sentenced\u00a0to two years of hard labor, destroying his reputation as a celebrated writer and diminishing his savings. The derogatory use of \u201cqueer\u201d began to overtake the word\u2019s original definition. By the 1920s, the word had fallen out of popular usage because of its new homophobic association, Coles\u00a0said. \u201cWhere the word did appear, it typically carried the same level of hatred as Douglas\u2019 original use, paired with the same determination to destroy the lives of \u2018queers,\u2019\u201d Coles said. \u201cMost often, the word was associated with physical violence.\u201d Why some LGBTQ people prefer the term queer Queer is ambiguous on purpose, said Kaila Adia Story, an associate professor at the University of Louisville who studies the intersection of race and sexuality: It frees LGBTQ people\u00a0who use the term to describe themselves\u00a0from having to specify the particulars of their identity while acknowledging that they don\u2019t subscribe to\u00a0heteronormativity, or the belief that being straight is the norm of sexual behavior. \u201cQueer means not letting society, institutions, friends or loved ones define who you are or who you hope to be,\u201d Story said. \u201cIt means to define yourself for yourself, live boldly and unapologetically.\u201d The term also eschews some of the expectations and stereotypes that accompany terms like \u201cgay\u201d or \u201clesbian,\u201d which explicitly reference gender. \u201cSexuality doesn\u2019t have to have one specific definition, and queer allows people room to learn who they are and claim it for themselves,\u201d said Dr. Lexx Brown-James, a therapist and sex educator who cohosted \u201cQueer Sex Ed,\u201d a webseries from the LGBTQ advocacy organization It Gets Better. Young people particularly have gravitated toward the word because they\u2019re growing up during a time when the way we identify our sexualities and genders is evolving and diversifying beyond the binary of male and female, gay or straight, Allen said. Before nonbinary was a more commonly used identifier, the newer, more expansive definition of queer inspired the term genderqueer, which also refers to people whose gender identity isn\u2019t solely male or female. \u201cWith the (LGBT) acronym, there isn\u2019t really space for them,\u201d Allen said. \u201cQueer offers an opportunity for a bit more expansive view.\u201d Reddy said she has felt more comfortable using queer as an identifier than gay or lesbian because the terms \u201chave traditionally evoked very specific images\u201d that don\u2019t align with her self-perception. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t feel like me,\u201d she said. \u201cQueer, for me, really inhabits the space between\u201d rigid divisions of gender and sexuality. Gen Z adults identify as LGBTQ at much higher rates than older Americans, according to recent studies.\u00a0Queer is becoming a more common identifier among LGBTQ people,\u00a0particularly\u00a0among Gen Z,\u00a0Allen said, but it\u2019s not a \u201cuniversal preference.\u201d Some LGBTQ people from older generations still find the term offensive given its\u00a0history as a homophobic slur\u00a0throughout the 20th century. How LGBTQ people reclaimed the word In 1990, a group of activists from ACT UP, the New York-based organization\u00a0aimed at ending the AIDS crisis, debuted their new initiative: Queer Nation, an advocacy venture dedicated to ending discrimination against all LGBTQ people. They were among the first (or at least most visible) protesters to rehabilitate the word \u201cqueer\u201d into not only an identifying term, but a unifier under which all LGBTQ people could fit,\u00a0language scholar\u00a0Coles said. \u201cQueer\u201d was still widely considered an epithet then. In a leaflet distributed at New York\u2019s Pride Parade in 1990, Queer Nation explained its choice to call LGBTQ people queer.\u00a0In an excerpt provided by Coles, Queer Nation wrote:\u00a0\u201cUsing \u2018queer\u2019 is a way of reminding us how we are perceived by the rest of the world \u2026 Yeah, queer can be a rough word but it is also a sly and ironic weapon we can steal from the homophobe\u2019s hands and use against him.\u201d Adopting \u201cqueer\u201d was a sharp political move, too, Coles said: \u201cInstead of treating the concerns of gay men, lesbians, bisexuals, trans folks, and other groups as largely distinct from one another, \u2018queer\u2019 offered a single unifying word that allowed all these people to band together and fight for their shared interests with greater political influence,\u201d Coles said. Academics soon followed Queer Nation\u2019s lead and began to include the term in their work:\u00a0Teresa de\u00a0Lauretis\u00a0organized\u00a0a 1990 conference of queer theorists, and Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick, who helped popularize the term queer studies instead of gay and lesbian studies,\u00a0said\u00a0in a 1993 book\u00a0that within queer there is room for \u201copen mesh of possibilities, gaps, overlaps, dissonances and resonances\u201d in discussions of gender and sexuality.\u201d TV series like \u201cQueer as Folk\u201d and \u201cQueer Eye for the Straight Guy\u201d further exposed the public to a different interpretation of the term \u2014 queer as it was used in those series \u201cstill implied strangeness and difference from the sexual norm, but that strangeness was now a matter of self-conscious pride,\u201d Coles said. In 2016, LGBTQ media advocacy organization\u00a0GLAAD\u00a0formally recommended that media outlets adopt the longer version of the acronym to include the Q, for queer. With its recommendation, LGBTQ eventually superseded LGBT as the acronym\u00a0many\u00a0media outlets used to describe queer people. Why queer is still controversial Despite the prevalence of queer, its use is still a point of contention among LGBTQ people, particularly those from older generations. Larry Kramer, the late playwright and LGBTQ rights activist, famously disliked using the word as an identifier,\u00a0telling an audience\u00a0at Yale University in 2009, \u201cI am not queer! And neither are you. When will we stop using this adolescent and demeaning word to identify ourselves?\u201d For those who didn\u2019t grow up hearing the word used as a slur, its heft might not register, Coles said. But the word may still carry the \u201cweight of decades of trauma\u201d for older generations of LGBTQ activists to whom queer was always an attack on their identity. \u201cIt can be hard to see a word that was used to abuse you widely used and embraced,\u201d said Dr. Lexx, the therapist and sex educator. Disagreement over use of the word queer gives LGBTQ people a chance to reckon with the history of the word and, hopefully, better understand each other, Reddy said. \u201cI identify this way because that\u2019s how I feel,\u201d Reddy said. \u201cAnd a person from a different generation may really dislike or feel uncomfortable about the word queer. That\u2019s an opportunity for us to (question), \u2018why is that? No matter what the reason, how do we respect that and ensure that there\u2019s space for what we\u2019re all feeling at the same time?\u2019\u201d It\u2019s freeing for so many young people to find a term to describe who they are when other identifiers don\u2019t fit the bill, Allen said. But he also hopes that the young people who identify as queer recognize the term\u2019s loaded meaning. \u201cMy hope is that they use the term intentionally and with due recognition to its history,\u201d he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/us/queer-meaning-lgbtq-cec/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/13/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_12_us_pamela-smart-case-timeline", "text": "A forbidden relationship between a teacher and her student started with an affair and ended in the 1990 killing of the teacher\u2019s husband. Pamela Smart, then 22, was a high school media director when she began an affair with 15-year-old Billy Flynn. In her trial, prosecutors said Smart then coaxed Flynn into carrying out the murder plot with two teenage friends. Flynn admitted to killing Gregg Smart, along with two accomplices, and all three worked out plea bargains. Smart\u2019s trial \u2014 one of the first in the US to allow cameras in the courtroom \u2014 riveted the world with its mixture of sex, adultery and the story of the intimate relationship between an adult and a juvenile. More than 20 years later, the story is back in focus with Smart, who is serving life in prison, accepting responsibility for her husband\u2019s killing for the first time. Here\u2019s a timeline of Pamela Smart\u2019s murder conspiracy plot, the resulting legal cases and convictions. The shooting May 1, 1990: On this evening, teenager Flynn said, he and a friend ambushed Gregg Smart, Pamela\u2019s husband, as he arrived home to his condo in Derry, New Hampshire. The husband was on his knees, begging for his life, according to prosecutors. Flynn fired a bullet into Smart\u2019s head in a hallway where his wife later found his body. The teenagers made the scene look like a break-in. Pamela Smart\u2019s storyline was part of the inspiration for Joyce Maynard\u2019s 1992 novel \u201cTo Die For,\u201d which was later adapted into a 1995 movie starring Nicole Kidman and Joaquin Phoenix. August 1, 1990: Smart was arrested three months after the shooting. Her mother, Linda Wojas, said she was never told her daughter was a suspect at the time, she told CNN\u2019s Larry King in 1991. A riveting trial January 28, 1991: Flynn, 17, and two accomplices, Patrick Randall, 17, and Vance Lattime Jr., 18, pleaded guilty to the shooting death of Gregory Smart, according to the Associated Press. All were facing first-degree murder charges but pleaded guilty to charges related to second-degree murder and were given lighter sentences in exchange for testimony against Smart, CNN reported. That same night, Raymond Fowler, 19, was arrested in connection with the plot, according to the AP. Police said the charges were from a separate attempt on Gregory Smart\u2019s life before the actual murder. March 4, 1991: Oral arguments began in Smart\u2019s murder conspiracy trial in the Rockingham County Superior Court in Exeter, New Hampshire. Smart was on trial on suspicion of plotting the murder of her husband just before their first wedding anniversary. Prosecutors alleged Smart was after her husband\u2019s $140,000 life insurance policy. Smart allegedly seduced Flynn and threatened to stop having sex with him unless he killed her husband, prosecutors said. The trial drew a lot of attention \u2014 people lined up and had to have tickets to enter the courtroom. People who couldn\u2019t get in watched from TV monitors in another room, while television crews and reporters crammed into the press room. Convictions March 22, 1991: Smart was convicted of being an accomplice to first-degree murder, conspiracy to commit murder and tampering with a witness. She was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. August 20, 1992: Flynn was sentenced to 28 years to life in prison for second-degree murder as part of his negotiated plea deal, according to CNN affiliate WMUR. Flynn had sobbed on the witness stand during Smart\u2019s trial, saying he didn\u2019t want to lose her, who he called his first love, so he went forward with her plan, as reported by CNN. August 23, 1992: Randall, one of the accomplices, was sentenced to 40 years to life in prison with 12 years of the minimum sentence deferred for second-degree murder, according to WMUR. His sentence was later reduced. The getaway car driver, Lattime, was sentenced to 18 years to life in prison, as part of his plea deal, according to WMUR. Fowler, a passenger in the car, was sentenced to 15 to 30 years in prison as part of his plea deal. The appeals July 2005: The state\u2019s Executive Council denies Smart\u2019s request for a pardon hearing, according to WMUR. May 15, 2019: The Executive Council voted to deny Smart of a commutation hearing, according to WMUR. New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu agreed with the council\u2019s decision. March 23, 2022: The Executive Council rejected Smart\u2019s third request, according to the AP. Smart went to the state Supreme Court, which dismissed the petition. Freedom for some March 12, 2015: After serving 25 years in prison, Flynn was paroled, according to WMUR. It was his 41st birthday. Flynn and Randall were released on parole on June 4, 2015, according to WMUR. And Fowler and Lattime were out on parole the year prior. Accepting responsibility June 11, 2024: For the first time, Smart accepted full responsibility for the death of her husband in a videotaped statement Tuesday, according to the AP. The video was released as a part of her most recent request for a sentence reduction. Smart asked Gov. Sununu and the state\u2019s Executive Council for a commutation hearing, as she has exhausted her other court appeals options. Smart is serving life in prison at Bedford Hills Correctional Facility in Westchester County, New York.

{"id": "2024_06_12_economy_inflation-real-time-data", "text": "If you want to know how much a publicly traded company is worth at any given time, all you have to do is look up its market cap, which updates in real time during trading hours. But if you want to know how fast prices are rising in the US, you get two official updates a month \u2014 the Consumer Price Index and the Personal Consumption Expenditures price index. Both come with a lag, can be revised several months later and can even be indefinitely delayed in the event of a government shutdown, as was almost the case with September\u2019s inflation data. Despite these shortcomings, officials at the Federal Reserve rely on these government reports to help make crucial monetary policy decisions that directly influence the interest rates you pay on your mortgage and other kinds of debt. The inflation rate the government arrives at also impacts how much you receive in Social Security benefits and likely is a factor in determining your pay. But a novel real-time inflation gauge called Truflation is trying to fix some of the issues with government inflation data that has long been considered the gold standard. While it\u2019s valuable to have regularly updated inflation data, Truflation doesn\u2019t have as much access to certain categories the government data tracks, namely education and health care prices, two big expenses for many Americans. The government also has a much longer history of producing inflation reports with extremely thorough standards. How it works Unlike PCE and CPI, Truflation arrives at a new inflation rate on a near-daily basis, drawing from over 60 different data sources that provide three unique prices across more than 18 million goods and services. Some of the data providers include Amazon, Walmart, Nielsen, Hilton and Zillow. While the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the division of the Labor Department that produces monthly CPI reports, enlists a team of people to either physically go to businesses, call them up or scan websites to collect pricing data for 80,000 goods and services across the country, Truflation pays for some of the data. Over time, more providers have been sharing data for free because they recognize that having it incorporated into the model will give them more updated and accurate information on how competitive their pricing is, Stefan Rust, CEO and founder of Truflation, told CNN. That data goes through a rigorous process incorporating blockchain technology to verify its authenticity, which Truflation outlines in its public 20-page methodology. Like PCE and CPI, Truflation assigns relative importance values to categories to mirror how an average consumer\u2019s income is allocated. For most consumers, housing accounts for the majority of their spending, and is therefore assigned a greater weight than, for instance, clothing. That\u2019s why small increases in the cost of housing can end up having big impacts on the overall inflation rate. Truflation uses the same process the government does to calculate relative importance, but it uses some different data to determine how consumers allocate their income. That accounts for some of the variation between the government\u2019s inflation data and Truflation\u2019s. Another discrepancy is that Truflation\u2019s data is not seasonally adjusted, whereas the government\u2019s monthly data is. That means that an increase in utility prices during the summer when it\u2019s typically more expensive to cool your home would show up more in Truflation\u2019s data than the government\u2019s. As of Wednesday, Truflation put the nation\u2019s annual inflation rate at 2.23%, just inches away from the Fed\u2019s 2% target. In contrast, May\u2019s CPI report released Wednesday morning arrived at a 3.3% inflation rate, matching precisely what Truflation predicted the gauge would come in at based on its data. Truflation is able to predict what government inflation reports will show by adjusting their data to when the government goes out and collects its own pricing data to form its monthly reports. How Truflation data is being used Wall Street traders were the first group drawn to Truflation, Rust said. \u201cThey wanted the data to help them calculate where they felt, based on our data, the government BLS numbers would come out on.\u201d Danielle DiMartino Booth, who advised\u00a0Richard Fisher\u00a0when he was the president of the Dallas Fed and who is now CEO and chief strategist at QI Research, said she uses Truflation \u201cto identify where price pressures are cropping up\u201d on a daily basis. That gives her a \u201cbetter feel\u201d of what\u2019s happening on the ground versus the government\u2019s data, Booth told CNN. While Fed officials have taken a greater interest in analyzing economic data from non-government sources to help shape their views on the economy, it remains to be seen if and how they\u2019re using Truflation data. But it\u2019s on their radar, said Rust, who says he has met with researchers from the New York and Dallas Fed.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/12/economy/inflation-real-time-data/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/13/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_10_us_us-violent-crime-rates-statistics", "text": "Violent\u00a0crime\u00a0dropped by more than 15% in the United States during the first three months of 2024, according to statistics released Monday by the FBI. The new numbers show violent\u00a0crime\u00a0from January to March dropped 15.2% compared to the same period in 2023, while murders fell 26.4% and reported rapes decreased by 25.7%. Aggravated assaults decreased during that period when compared to last year by 12.5%, according to the data, while robberies fell 17.8%. The numbers released Monday were gathered from 13,719 of the just over 19,000 law enforcement agencies from across the country, according to the bureau. Meanwhile, property\u00a0crime\u00a0went down 15.1% in the first three months of this year. Burglaries dropped 16.7%, while motor vehicle theft decreased by 17.3%. The declines in violent and property\u00a0crimes were seen in every region of the US. In a statement Monday, Attorney General Merrick Garland stressed the new data \u201cmakes clear that last year\u2019s historic decline in violent\u00a0crime\u00a0is continuing.\u201d \u201cThis continued historic decline in homicides does not represent abstract statistics. It represents people whose lives were saved \u2014 people who are still here to see their children grow up, to work toward fulfilling their dreams, and to contribute to their communities,\u201d Garland said. US murder rate plunges The new FBI figures validate a trend identified by some national\u00a0crime\u00a0experts: The US murder rate continues to drop at a high rate and could be headed for its largest annual decline ever. Compared to the first five months of 2023, murders this year have dropped more than 40% in cities including New Orleans, Seattle, Boston, Baltimore, and Philadelphia, according to the research firm AH Datalytics, which analyzes\u00a0crime\u00a0figures reported by law enforcement agencies across the nation. Although more than six months still remain in 2024, \u201cit\u2019s plausible that this will be, by far, the largest one-year decline in American history,\u201d said Jeff Asher, criminal justice analyst and co-founder of consulting firm AH Datalytics. The firm\u2019s real-time review of 265 cities currently shows a 19% drop in murders nationwide compared to 2023. Data limitations The preliminary figures in the FBI\u2019s Quarterly Uniform\u00a0Crime\u00a0Report do come with important limitations. For one, the bureau relies upon data voluntarily submitted by policing agencies. Crime\u00a0analysts also say quarterly data are imprecise, as law enforcement agencies have the remainder of the year to audit and correct any reporting errors before final annual figures are published by the FBI. \u201cWe have other data sources that point to the same trends, but the degree of those declines is probably being overstated due to the methodology being employed by the FBI,\u201d said Asher. \u2018Interrupting cycles of violence\u2019 The US murder rate has declined since 2020, when the Covid-19 pandemic brought with it a surge in homicides across the country. FBI figures showed the number of homicides increased nearly 30% from 2019 to 2020 \u2013 the largest single-year increase the agency had recorded since it began tracking these\u00a0crimes in the 1960s \u2013 and violent\u00a0crime\u00a0during the same period increased by 5%. Criminal justice experts say\u00a0crime\u00a0trends are complex, but generally blame the cause in the 2020 surge on vast societal disruptions, including the closure of schools, businesses, childcare and community programs. Others pointed to more stress and more guns along with less policing, less public trust and disruption of social support services. \u201cThese are some of the tools that we would expect to have an effect on reversing or interrupting cycles of violence,\u201d said Asher. \u201cIn a normal year these tools would have been available to us in 2020 or 2021, but they weren\u2019t. It\u2019s only now, several years later, that we\u2019re starting to see the level of gun violence, the level of murder fall back to where it was pre-pandemic.\u201d CNN\u2019s Eric Levenson and Mark Morales contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/10/us/us-violent-crime-rates-statistics/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/13/2024", "section": "us"}}

KOBAYASHI: UNFINISHED BEEF,\u201d which the streaming company advertised as a determination of the ultimate hot dog eating champion. Netflix\u2019s announcement comes just a day after Chestnut was banned from competing in Nathan\u2019s hot dog eating contest because he signed\u00a0a deal with rival plant-based food company Impossible Foods. Chestnut is a hot dog champ. He\u2019s won the \u201cMustard Yellow Belt\u201d 16 times, ate a world record 76 hot dogs and buns in 10 minutes in 2021 and has reportedly made hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of dollars for his competitive eating of hot dogs and other foods. Kobayashi is Chestnut\u2019s \u201cfiercest rival,\u201d he said in a Netflix press release. Kobayashi \u2014 who popularized competitive eating as a sport in 2001 when he almost doubled the previous record for most hot dogs eaten in the Nathan\u2019s Hot Dog Eating Championship \u2014 said he would put off retiring until he takes down Chestnut \u201cone last time\u201d in the release. Netflix said the last time the two faced off was in 2009, when Chestnut edged past Kobayashi. Similar to Chestnut, Kobayashi was banned from competing in the Nathan\u2019s Competition due to a contract dispute in 2010. \u201cWe are devastated to learn that Joey Chestnut has chosen to represent a rival brand that sells plant-based hot dogs rather than competing in the 2024 Nathan\u2019s Famous Fourth of July Hot Dog Eating Contest,\u201d the Major League Eating organization, which oversees the Nathan\u2019s event, said in a statement Tuesday.

With clients working with a single channel of communication that directs\u00a0Samsung\u2019s memory chip, foundry and chip packaging teams at once, the time it takes to produce AI chips, usually weeks, has been cut by around 20%,\u00a0Samsung\u00a0said on Wednesday. \u201cWe are truly living in the age of AI, the emergence of generative AI is completely changing the technology landscape,\u201d said Siyoung Choi, president and general manager of the foundry business, at a\u00a0Samsung\u00a0event in San Jose, California. Samsung\u00a0expects global chip industry revenue to grow to $778 billion by 2028, boosted by AI chips, Choi said. At a briefing with reporters ahead of the event, Executive Vice President of Foundry Sales and Marketing Marco Chisari said the company believes OpenAI CEO Sam Altman\u2019s loose projections on soaring demand for AI chips are realistic. Altman has told executives at contract chipmaker TSMC that\u00a0he wanted to build roughly three dozen new chip factories, Reuters\u00a0has previously reported. Samsung\u00a0is one of the few companies that sells memory chips, offers foundry services and designs chips under the same roof. That combination has often worked against it in the past, as some clients were nervous that doing business with its foundry might benefit\u00a0Samsung\u00a0as a competitor in another field. However, with skyrocketing demand for AI chips and the need for all the chip parts to be highly integrated to train or infer huge amounts of data fast by using less power,\u00a0Samsung\u00a0believes its turnkey approach will be a strength going forward. The South Korean tech giant also touted its cutting-edge chip architecture known as gate all-around (GAA), a type of transistor architecture that helps improve chip performance and reduces power consumption. GAA is seen as important to keep making more powerful chips for AI as chips become finer to the point of pushing the boundaries of physics. Although competitors such as global foundry No 1 TSMC are also working on chips using GAA,\u00a0Samsung\u00a0started applying GAA earlier, and said it plans to mass produce its second-generation 3-nanometer chips using GAA in the second half of this year. Samsung\u00a0also announced its latest 2-nanometer chipmaking process for high-performance computing chips, which places power rails on the backside of the wafer to improve power delivery. Mass production is slated for 2027.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/12/tech/south-korea-samsung-ai-chips-plan-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/13/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_11_us_naacp-sues-shenandoah-county-confederate-school-names", "text": "The NAACP in Virginia and five students filed a federal lawsuit against the Shenandoah County school board in response to their vote last month to restore the names of two schools that previously honored Confederate leaders \u2013 nearly four years after a decision was made to change them. \u201dBy celebrating the memory of these traitors every time a child walked through the school doors, by embracing the cold wind of intolerance and division and insensitivity, the Shenandoah County School Board has resurrected the ghosts of the Jim Crow era,\u201d NAACP Virginia State Conference President the Rev. Cozy Bailey said at a news conference. The lawsuit asks the court to require the school board to remove the confederate names and mascots and to declare that the board violated the Constitution by reinstating the school names. CNN has reached out to all six members of the school board and the superintendent of Shenandoah County Public Schools for comment. Making Black students attend schools honoring Confederate leaders violates their constitutional rights, according to the lawsuit. \u201cPlaintiffs bring this case to redress the creation and maintenance of a discriminatory environment that erodes their right to receive an education and to be free from compelled speech they consider vile,\u201d the suit says. \u201cRequiring Plaintiffs to attend schools named in honor of prominent members of the Confederacy and compelling Plaintiffs to identify as members of the Stonewall Jackson \u201cGenerals\u201d violates Plaintiffs\u2019 rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and the Equal Educational Opportunities Act.\u201d Plaintiff Briana Brown, a rising 12th-grader at the Massanutten Regional Governor\u2019s School, based at Mountain View High School, said she was directly impacted by the board\u2019s decision. \u201cWhen I found out about the school board\u2019s decision, I felt unwelcome in a place that I go every day to, which should never be the case,\u201d Brown said at the news conference. \u201c\u2026 This decision has made me realize that I need to speak out about what I believe in and empower people to use their voices for positive change. I refuse to be afraid any longer.\u201d The lawsuit was filed in US District Court for the Western District of Virginia. \u201cA Black high schooler who wants to play on the soccer team must wear the Stonewall Jackson \u2018Generals\u2019 uniform. The student must honor a Confederate leader who fought to keep Black people in chains as slaves,\u201d said an NCAA attorney, Marja Plater, senior counsel with Washington Lawyers\u2019 Committee for Civil Rights and Urban Affairs. \u201cExposing children to this persistent racism and hate harms their self-worth and long-term health.\u201d In a 5-1 vote on May 9, the school board decided to reinstate the names Stonewall Jackson High School and Ashby Lee Elementary School. The names honor Confederate Gens. Thomas \u201cStonewall\u201d Jackson, Robert E. Lee and Turner Ashby. The schools have been called Mountain View High School and Honey Run Elementary School since July 2021, according to\u00a0board documents. At the time of the vote, several board members criticized how the names were previously changed. Board member Thomas Streett, who voted in favor of restoring the names, described it as a \u201cknee-jerk reaction\u201d that had a lack of involvement from the community, and board member Gloria E. Carlineo told CNN that their decision had nothing to do with\u00a0race. It was based on doing things the right way, she said. \u201cI spoke about not changing history,\u201d said Bailey. \u201cAnyone who says that we can eliminate a discussion about race when we talk about social justice in this country, they\u2019re the ones who are attempting to change history.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/11/us/naacp-sues-shenandoah-county-confederate-school-names/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/13/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_12_us_atlanta-bus-hijacking-how-it-unfolded", "text": "Atlanta police had barely finished briefing the community about a shooting inside a downtown food court Tuesday afternoon when calls began to come in about a bus hijacking. A gunman had hijacked a commuter bus with 17 people inside and shot one of them with the passenger\u2019s own gun, authorities said, prompting others to frantically text loved ones and call 911 for help. But as police arrived on the scene and tried to confront the gunman, identified as 39-year-old felon Joseph Grier, the suspect held the bus driver at gunpoint and forced him to speed away, according to Atlanta Police Chief Darin Schierbaum. The ensuing rush-hour police chase zig-zagged across highway lanes and suburban streets as the bus led authorities across at least two counties, at times careening into other cars and crossing into opposing traffic. Inside, a passenger surreptitiously stayed on the line with 911, allowing authorities to hear the commotion, Schierbaum said. Mayor Andre Dickens said the chaos sounded like a movie scene as the suspect had \u201ca gun to the head of a bus driver saying, \u2018Don\u2019t stop this bus or else worse will happen.\u2019\u201d When the bus finally ground to a halt on a tree-lined street in the suburb of Stone Mountain, passengers streamed out and Grier was arrested without incident, police said. A passenger found shot aboard the bus was taken to a hospital, where they later died, officials said. He was identified Wednesday as 58-year-old Ernest Byrd Jr., according to the Fulton County Medical Examiner\u2019s Office, which ruled his death a homicide. The suspect \u2013 who, in a twist, was at the scene of Tuesday afternoon\u2019s shooting downtown and spoke to local news outlets moments before the hijacking \u2013 now faces a slew of charges in connection to Tuesday\u2019s incident, according to jail records. They include one count of murder, 14 counts of kidnapping, 13 counts of aggravated assault, one count of first-degree hijacking of a motor vehicle, one count of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon and one count of possession of a firearm or knife during the commission of or attempt to commit certain felonies. Grier waved his initial court appearance, according to a spokesperson for the Fulton County Sheriff\u2019s Office. He has 19 prior felony convictions, police said, though no further details were provided. CNN has been unable to determine whether the suspect has an attorney. How the harrowing incident unfolded The hijacked Gwinnett County Transit bus is part of a web of commuter routes that bring people to and from Atlanta\u2019s sprawling suburbs, including passenger Paulette Gilbert, who called her husband from inside the bus as the chase began to unfold. Paulette Gilbert seemed stunned and frightened as she described a man who had boarded the bus and began acting strangely, said her husband, Johnny Gilbert. She said the man got into a confrontation with another passenger and shot them, possibly in the leg. \u201cShe said the guy got on the bus and seemed kinda crazy,\u201d Gilbert said, recounting his wife\u2019s story. \u201cHe was being disruptive or getting on people\u2019s nerves,\u201d he added. The husband urged his wife to get off the phone in case the shooter thought she was calling 911, fearful he may shoot her next. \u201cI said put the phone down, put it away. Just sit still.\u201d Grier was \u201cengaging with passengers\u201d when he got into a fight with one of them, a male, who pulled a gun, according to the Georgia Bureau of Investigation. \u201cGrier took the gun from the passenger and began threatening passengers with it,\u201d the GBI said in a news release, citing preliminary information from its investigation. \u201cGrier then shot the passenger and ordered the bus driver to flee the scene while threatening passengers with the gun.\u201d At around 4:30 p.m., police received the first 911 call from a passenger reporting that a gunman was holding the bus hostage on Ivan Allen Boulevard and that there may have been shots fired, Schierbaum said. Then the line went silent. Soon after, another call came in from the family of a passenger who had texted them that the bus had been hijacked. An officer arrived at the scene within about a minute of the first 911 call and tried to confront the suspect, who then \u201cforced the bus driver to drive off,\u201d Schierbaum said. A third 911 call \u2013 this time from another passenger \u2013 stayed on the line throughout the entire chase, allowing dispatchers to feed information to several law enforcement agencies involved in the pursuit, the chief said. The bus led a fleet of law enforcement vehicles along Atlanta\u2019s Interstate 85 as rush hour commuters sped by. It crossed through several suburban areas before coming to a halt in the city of Stone Mountain. The large bus struck several vehicles during the pursuit, police said, though it is unclear whether any drivers were hurt. Officers were able to disable the vehicle using several tactics, including positioning an armored vehicle at one of its sides, preventing it from maneuvering in that direction, police said. The GBI said law enforcement flattened tires on the bus during the chase, but it continued to move. Ultimately, a Georgia state trooper fired his rifle into the engine compartment of the bus, the GBI said, causing the bus to halt on Hugh Howell Road in Stone Mountain. As the bus came to a halt, passengers began to unload themselves and Grier was arrested without incident, police said. A joint investigation into the hijacking will be conducted by the Atlanta Police Department and the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, which will also investigate the police use of force. Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis said Wednesday an employee of her office was on the hijacked bus, a witness to the incident, so she can\u2019t prosecute the suspect. Willis has asked Georgia\u2019s prosecuting attorneys council to assign a different jurisdiction to prosecute the suspect, writing in the letter her office is \u201cconflicted because it has been determined that a victim/witness in this case is a current employee of the Office of the District Attorney for the Atlanta Judicial Circuit.\u201d A violent day for Atlantans The hijacking was one of two violent incidents in downtown Atlanta Tuesday, just four blocks apart.\u00a0Though police say the incidents do not appear to be connected, their alarming proximity \u2013 and the suspects\u2019 extensive criminal records \u2013 have drawn condemnation and concern from local officials. About two hours before the hijacking, a man shot and wounded three people in a busy Atlanta food court. Police said the 34-year-old suspect in that shooting, who was quickly arrested, is a convicted felon who has been arrested 11 times. Interviews with local news stations showed Grier at the scene, claiming in disjointed statements that he witnessed the shooting at Peachtree Center. \u201cI got knives. I got all this sh*t on me. I protect myself. I can\u2019t get a gun,\u201d Grier said in an interview with CNN affiliate WXIA, adding he had previous felony convictions and was on probation. A CNN crew at the scene of the aftermath of the shooting saw Grier being belligerent and interfering with police officers during their investigation. Police are looking into Grier\u2019s presence at the earlier shooting. \u201cToday has been a very active day, but let me be clear, we\u2019re talking about gun violence that is as a result of too many people having guns in their hands,\u201d Mayor Dickens said in a Tuesday evening news conference. \u201cYou\u2019re talking about people that should not have been on the streets with guns.\u201d Dickens said the spate of gun violence shows \u201csomething more needs to be done\u201d but noted violent crime in the city has been decreasing. \u201cSo, this day is not indicative of all the days in the city of Atlanta, but this is a day we\u2019ll never forget,\u201d the mayor said.

{"id": "2024_06_12_politics_nathan-wade-trump-interview-the-source-cnntv", "text": "Former special prosecutor Nathan Wade says he believes Donald Trump will \u201cabsolutely\u201d be put on trial in Georgia in the 2020 election subversion case \u2013 even if he wins a second term and he\u2019s in the White House at the time. Wade resigned from the case in March over allegations of an improper romantic relationship with Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis but said in an exclusive interview on CNN\u2019s \u201cThe Source\u201d that he remains close friends with her. The question of whether a sitting US president can be forced to stand trial for state-level criminal charges has never been litigated. Wade said in the interview Wednesday that he expects prosecutors and defense attorneys will have to confront that unprecedented scenario if Trump wins the 2024 election. When asked if Trump can be put on trial in the Peach State during a second term, Wade said: \u201cI do believe that he can.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t believe that it \u2026 it looks good to the rest of the world. But certainly I don\u2019t think that there\u2019s anything that would prevent that from happening,\u201d Wade said. He added: \u201cIf he wins the election, then certainly there are lawyers out there who will be charged with figuring out that issue, maneuvering around it.\u201d Wade\u2019s interview comes as the Georgia Court of Appeals has halted the election subversion conspiracy case against Trump and his co-defendants until a panel of judges decides if Willis should be removed from the case. Trump, who has been seeking to push off legal issues until at least 2025, has been arguing that her affair with Wade should also disqualify her. The court\u2019s recent order pausing the case is the latest indication that a trial will not occur before the November presidential election. The appeals court is expected to rule on the disqualification issue by March 2025, though it could issue a ruling sooner. Willis in a new filing on Wednesday asked the state appeals court to dismiss the appeal of trial Judge Scott McAfee\u2019s original order due to a \u201clack of sufficient evidence.\u201d \u201cWith the case now docketed,\u00a0the State of Georgia, by and through Atlanta Judicial Circuit District Attorney Fani T. Willis, moves for the appeal to be dismissed as\u00a0improvidently granted due to the lack of sufficient evidence, based upon\u00a0the explicit factual findings of the trial court, to support reversal of the\u00a0order at issue,\u201d the filing from the district attorney\u2019s office states. Steve Sadow, Trump\u2019s lead defense counsel in Georgia, called Willis\u2019 motion to dismiss the appeal a \u201clast ditch effort.\u201d On Wednesday, Wade pushed back on criticism that his relationship with Willis was to blame for delaying Trump\u2019s trial. \u201cI don\u2019t believe my actions played a role at all,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cI believe in the indictment. Certainly I would never have done anything that would have jeopardized that work. I do think the timing of the personal relationship I had was bad.\u201d \u201cThis prosecution has nothing to do with the voters and their opinion as to whether or not this indictment is proper or not proper. It has everything to do with the rule of law,\u201d he added. Trial court Judge Scott McAfee had previously ruled that Willis could remain on the case if Wade stepped away, prompting his resignation. The decision from the judge came after he held several days of witness testimony and evidence over claims from defense attorneys that Wade and Willis had engaged in an improper relationship, which they alleged financially benefited the district attorney. McAfee, in his ruling, noted that \u201cGeorgia law does not permit the finding of an actual conflict for simply making bad choices \u2013 even repeatedly.\u201d Yet, the judge wrote in his decision that an \u201codor of mendacity remains\u201d over the circumstances of their relationship and that either Willis or Wade would have to leave the case. Wade announced his resignation shortly after the ruling.

{"id": "2024_06_12_us_atlanta-food-court-shooting-suspect", "text": "Authorities have identified the suspected gunman in Tuesday\u2019s shooting at a downtown Atlanta food court as Jeremy Malone, according to a\u00a0news release\u00a0from the Georgia Bureau of Investigation. Malone, 34, is accused of wounding three people during a shooting at the Peachtree Center, a popular downtown Atlanta food court. The Morrow, Georgia, resident is a convicted felon who has served prison time for an armed robbery and has \u201c11 previous arrest cycles,\u201d Atlanta Police Chief Darin Schierbaum said. \u201cThis is an individual that should never have been possessing a gun and an individual that should never have placed this community in harm,\u201d Schierbaum said. Malone was shot by an Atlanta Police officer at the food court before he was taken into custody. He was transferred to a local hospital but has since been discharged. He is currently in the Fulton County Jail facing several charges including aggravated assault, reckless conduct, possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, and possession of a firearm or knife during the commission of or attempt to commit certain felonies. The victims, all three of whom are being treated at area hospitals, include a 47-year-old man, a 69-year-old woman and a 70-year-old woman. They are all expected to survive, authorities said. Shortly before 2:15 p.m. Tuesday, Malone entered the food court armed with a handgun and had a \u201cbrief altercation\u201d with a person before shooting that individual, the police chief said in a news conference, later clarifying the shooter \u201cphysically attacked\u201d the person before shooting them. The suspect then went on to shoot two other people who were in the food court, Schierbaum said. It\u2019s unclear how Malone may have been connected to the individual he first attacked. Peachtree Center, at the heart of the city\u2019s downtown, boasts more than 1.5 million square feet of office space across four buildings, as well as 50 restaurants and retail shops and three hotels, according to\u00a0its website. The building was placed on lockdown after the shooting but had reopened by late Tuesday afternoon, Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens said. He had earlier warned residents to \u201cavoid the area.\u201d Just over two hours after the shooting unfolded,\u00a0another man in Atlanta\u00a0held the driver of a commuter bus at gunpoint, leading police on a rush-hour chase while more than a dozen passengers remained in the vehicle, police said. The suspect in that case was taken into custody, and one person who was found shot on the bus has died, police said. Authorities said they don\u2019t believe the two incidents are connected. Malone waived his initial court appearance, Natalie Ammons, Fulton County Sheriff spokesperson, told CNN. It\u2019s unclear if he has legal representation at this time.

{"id": "2024_06_11_us_pamela-smart-accepts-responsibility-husband-killing", "text": "Concord, New Hampshire (AP) \u2014 Pamela Smart, who is serving life in prison for plotting with her teenage student to have her husband killed in 1990, accepted full responsibility for his death for the first time in a videotaped statement released Tuesday as part of her latest sentence reduction request. Smart, 56, was a 22-year-old high school media coordinator when she began an affair with a 15-year-old boy who later fatally shot her husband, Gregory Smart, in Derry, New Hampshire. The shooter was freed in 2015 after serving a 25-year sentence. Though Pamela Smart denied knowledge of the plot, she was convicted of being an accomplice to first-degree murder and other crimes and sentenced to life without parole. Smart has been incarcerated for nearly 34 years. She said in the statement that she began to \u201cdig deeper into her own responsibility\u201d through her experience in a writing group that \u201cencouraged us to go beyond and to spaces that we didn\u2019t want to be in. \u201cFor me that was really hard, because going into those places, in those spaces is where I found myself responsible for something I desperately didn\u2019t want to be responsible for, my husband\u2019s murder,\u201d she said, her voice quavering. \u201cI had to acknowledge for the first time in my own mind and my own heart how responsible I was, because I had deflected blame all the time, I think, almost as if it was a coping mechanism, because the truth of being so responsible was very difficult for me.\u201d She asked to have an \u201chonest conversation\u201d with New Hampshire\u2019s five-member Executive Council, which approves state contracts and appointees to the courts and state agencies, and with Gov. Chris Sununu. The council rejected her latest request in 2022 and Smart appealed to the state Supreme Court, which dismissed her petition last year. Val Fryatt, a cousin of Gregory Smart, told The Associated Press that Smart \u201cdanced around it\u201d and accepted full responsibility \u201cwithout admitting the facts around what made her \u2018fully responsible.\u2019\u201d Fryatt noted that Smart didn\u2019t mention her cousin\u2019s name in the video, \u201cnot even once.\u201d Messages seeking comment on the petition and statement were sent to the council members, Sununu, and the attorney general\u2019s office. Smart is serving time at Bedford Hills Correctional Facility in Westchester County, New York. She has earned two master\u2019s degrees behind bars and has also tutored fellow inmates, been ordained as a minister and been part of an inmate liaison committee. She said she is remorseful and has been rehabilitated. The trial was a media circus and one of America\u2019s first high-profile cases about a sexual affair between a school staff member and a student. Joyce Maynard wrote \u201cTo Die For\u201d in 1992, drawing from the Smart case. That inspired a 1995 film of the same name, starring Nicole Kidman and Joaquin Phoenix. The killer, William Flynn, and three other teens cooperated with prosecutors.

While the three felonies\u00a0Biden\u00a0was convicted of carry a maximum sentence of more than two dozen years behind bars, the sentencing\u00a0guideline, former federal prosecutor Tim Jansen told CNN, is between 15 and 21 months in prison. The actual sentence, however, will up to the judge. \u201cThey can go above or below the guidelines,\u201d\u00a0said\u00a0Jansen, who now works as a criminal defense attorney. \u201cAnd they usually have to put on the record why they\u2019re doing that.\u201d \u201cThe judge knows that this is the president\u2019s son,\u201d Jansen said, adding that given the security concerns and involvement of Secret Service protection, the judge could sentence Hunter\u00a0Biden\u00a0to a period of house arrest and probation. Federal District Judge Maryellen Noreika said the exact date for determining Biden\u2019s sentence would be decided later but noted that in Delaware, pre-sentence reports usually take four months,\u00a0which would place the sentencing in October, just before the November general election. During this time, pretrial services will, along with other things, investigate whether Biden has a previous criminal record or anything else that the judge would need to know before issuing a sentence. \u201cHe has no enhancements that I can see,\u201d Jansen said, noting\u00a0Biden\u2019s\u00a0lack of a previous criminal record. Jansen also said there was no mandatory minimum for the crimes\u00a0Biden\u00a0has been convicted of and that defense attorneys will likely ask the judge for a downward departure from the sentencing guidelines while prosecutors could ask for an increase President Joe Biden before the verdict said he would rule out a pardon for his son. But he was not asked about commuting a sentence, which he has the power to do in federal cases. The White House press secretary on Wednesday said she has not discussed the matter with the president. \u201cI have not spoken to the president about this. And what I\u2019m saying is he was asked about a pardon, he was asked about, he was asked about the trial specifically, and he answered it very clearly, very forthright,\u201d Karine Jean-Pierre said.

Police said they will not release the identity of the person who died until family members have been notified. The suspect was identified as Joseph Grier, a 39-year-old felon, Atlanta Police Chief Darin Schierbaum said at a news conference. CNN has not been able to determine if Grier has retained legal counsel at this time. The chief called the bus driver \u201ca hero\u201d as he was in \u201ca very dangerous situation\u201d yet remained committed to his passengers. He noted the driver was shaken up by the \u201charrowing experience.\u201d The chief said 17 people were on the bus, including the driver. Authorities responded to a report of gunfire on a bus\u00a0in downtown Atlanta at roughly 4:35 p.m Tuesday and upon arrival, the bus took off, the Atlanta Police Department said. Following a chase that\u00a0took place on I-85 and surface streets in\u00a0multiple counties, the suspect was taken into custody \u201cwithout further incident,\u201d police said. Inside the bus, officers found an adult with a gunshot wound, who died at a hospital, according to police. There were no other injuries to the people on the bus, according to authorities. The bus hit several vehicles during the pursuit, police said. It was not immediately known whether any motorists were hurt. A man told CNN his wife called him from the bus to say someone had been shot and she was scared. Johnny Gilbert said his wife, Paulette Gilbert, takes the bus to and from work. \u201cShe said the guy got on the bus and seemed kinda crazy,\u201d Gilbert said, recounting his wife\u2019s story. \u201cHe was being disruptive or getting on people\u2019s nerves,\u201d he added. Shortly after the bus came to a stop\u00a0in the suburb of Stone Mountain, one person was seen being led away in handcuffs. A police armored vehicle was parked in front of the bus and at least a dozen law enforcement vehicles were parked behind it on the street. During at least part of the pursuit and after the bus came to a stop, aerial footage from CNN affiliate WXIA showed the electronic sign on the front of the bus reading, \u201cEMERGENCY\u201d and then, \u201cCALL POLICE 911.\u201d It was not immediately clear when those words started appearing on the sign. The bus belongs to Gwinnett County Transit, which operates commuter routes in and from the metro Atlanta county, some of which go into downtown Atlanta.

{"id": "2024_06_12_us_southern-baptists-ivf", "text": "Indianapolis (AP) \u2014\u00a0Southern Baptist\u00a0delegates expressed alarm Wednesday over the way in vitro fertilization is routinely being practiced, approving a resolution lamenting that the creation of surplus frozen embryos often results in \u201cdestruction of embryonic human life.\u201d They\u00a0urged members\u00a0to carefully weigh the ethical implications of the technology while also expressing sympathy with couples \u201cwho experience the searing pain of infertility.\u201d The resolution \u2014 approved near the end of the Southern Baptist Convention\u2019s two-day annual meeting \u2014 affirms that embryos are human beings from the moment of fertilization, whether in the womb or generated in the laboratory via IVF. That\u2019s the same position held by the Alabama Supreme Court in ruling that frozen embryos have the full rights of people. In the wake of that decision, Alabama passed a law shielding IVF providers from prosecution and lawsuits \u2014 reflecting that even in a state with strong anti-abortion sentiment, there is support for a technology used by many couples facing infertility. The resolution also urged couples to adopt surplus frozen embryos that would otherwise be destroyed. Did the resolution condemn IVF or call for its banning? Not in a blanket way. What it did was denounce the routine practice of creating multiple embryos, frozen for potential use but often with surplus embryos destroyed. It also denounced the use of embryos for experiments, as well as \u201cdehumanizing methods for determining suitability for life and genetic sorting, based on notions of genetic fitness and parental preferences.\u201d Kristen Ferguson, chair of the committee on resolutions, said after the vote that the resolution amounts to the SBC\u2019s first foray into a new ethnical frontier but rooted in their longstanding belief in \u201cthe sanctity of the human embryo.\u201d IVF \u201cis not respecting the sanctity of the human embryo \u2026 in the way it is routinely practiced,\u201d she said. \u201cRight now we\u2019re trying to open the conversation, remind Southern Baptists of our long-held beliefs of the sanctity of human life and allow them to begin to think through the ethical implications.\u201d She anticipated there may be resolutions with \u201cmuch stronger language\u201d and more specific applications in the future, such as how these issues relate to the medical community, she said. \u201cBut we are not speaking to that at this time, because Southern Baptists aren\u2019t ready to speak to that yet,\u201d she said. \u201cThey wanted to say an affirmation of the human embryo and that it has implications for IVF. \u201d Why is this an important issue for Southern Baptists? Ever since the nation\u2019s largest Protestant body took a conservative turn in the 1980s, it has made opposing abortion a top priority. With the overturning of the Roe v. Wade decision that legalized abortion, new issues have reached the forefront, including IVF. This resolution makes clear that Southern Baptists\u2019 belief that life begins at conception extends to embryos generated via IVF. Do Southern Baptists and other conservative evangelicals have consensus on IVF? No.\u00a0On the convention floor, some delegates gave impassioned testimony to how IVF enabled couples to have long-sought children. Others said that despite that laudable goal, the practice is ethically unacceptable. Some believe it\u2019s ethical to use IVF to create only the number of embryos intended for implantation. Albert Mohler, a prominent SBC seminary president and conservative activist, made a hardline denunciation of IVF at a sideline event before the SBC meeting on Monday, calling IVF a \u201ccommodification of the embryo\u201d that assaults human dignity. He also criticized it for enabling people to have children outside of heterosexual marriage. Did the resolution call for a government ban on IVF? No. It calls for government to \u201crestrain actions inconsistent with the dignity of \u2026 frozen embryonic human beings.\u201d But it doesn\u2019t prescribe specific measures. \u201cI think especially after the Alabama Supreme Court decision, there\u2019s been a rush at state level as well as federal level to protect IVF or to even expand IVF access, often with very little thought to some of the other realities at stake,\u201d said Jason Thacker, a Southern Baptist ethicist who advised the resolutions committee. \u201cWe\u2019re not naive enough to say that we can just ban this technology, full stop,\u201d he said. \u201cWhile that would be the goal, because that\u2019s consistent with dignity of the human embryo in many ways,\u201d he said he recognized that there are others who believe there are ethical ways to apply IVF technology. What\u2019s essential, he said, is laws that respect embryos\u2019 human dignity.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/12/us/southern-baptists-ivf/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/13/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_12_economy_june-fed-decision", "text": "The\u00a0Federal Reserve\u00a0said Wednesday it is keeping its benchmark lending rate at its current level for the seventh time in a row, while signaling fewer rate cuts than previously estimated. That means borrowing costs on everything from car loans to mortgage rates will remain elevated. Officials penciled in just one rate cut this year, according to their latest economic projections, compared to the three they forecast in March. They also expect\u00a0inflation\u00a0to be more stubborn this year than they thought in the spring, according to their forecasts. Fed Chair Jerome Powell noted that the May Consumer Price Index, released earlier Wednesday, was \u201ccertainly a better inflation report than almost anybody expected.\u201d But he said officials still want to see inflation slow further before lowering borrowing costs. The\u00a0Fed\u00a0has kept interest\u00a0rates\u00a0at a 23-year high for nearly a year, after kicking off an aggressive rate-hiking campaign in March 2022. Central bankers are waiting for more evidence that\u00a0inflation\u00a0is headed toward 2%\u00a0\u2014 and the\u00a0economy\u2019s resilience is allowing them to be comfortably on hold. The\u00a0Fed\u00a0will begin cutting interest\u00a0rates\u00a0once it\u2019s clear that\u00a0inflation\u00a0has cooled enough and won\u2019t heat back up \u2014 or if the job market deteriorates much more than expected, but there are currently not many signs of that. The inflation situation is now better than it was in the first quarter: Consumer prices eased in May, the Labor Department reported Wednesday morning. From a year earlier, inflation rose 3.3% in May, down from April\u2019s 3.4% rise and also below economists\u2019 expectations. Fed\u00a0officials\u2019 latest policy statement noted that\u00a0inflation\u00a0has seen some \u201cmodest further progress\u201d toward their 2% target in recent months, versus the May statement that noted there had been a \u201clack\u201d of any improvements. Here are key takeaways from the Fed\u2019s latest decision on interest rates. Powell calls May inflation data \u2018encouraging\u2019 Not only was the Fed chief pleased with Wednesday\u2019s inflation report, saying it was a \u201cgood reading,\u201d but he maintained his view that interest rates are \u201crestrictive\u201d enough to rein in price hikes. Powell pointed to the substantial progress seen in the second half of last year as an example. Still, he said officials now think \u201cit\u2019s probably going to take longer to get the confidence needed to loosen policy,\u201d compared to what they thought in March. That\u2019s precisely what officials\u2019 forecasts showed. When asked what will help tug inflation closer to the Fed\u2019s 2% target, Powell said slower inflation will come \u201cfrom where it\u2019s been coming from,\u201d pointing to the \u201cthe unwinding of the pandemic-related distortions to both supply and demand.\u201d \u201cAnd that is complemented by, amplified by, supported by restrictive monetary policy, so those two things are working together,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve made pretty good progress on inflation with our current [policy] stance.\u201d Economists have said that it\u2019s only a matter of time until declining rents show up in official inflation gauges. Still-high housing costs are still looming large in the CPI: Shelter inflation more than offset the decline in gasoline seen last month, rising 0.4% for the fourth month in a row, the May CPI showed. No concerns about the job market Powell has frequently said the job market likely needs to come back \u201cinto better balance\u201d to ensure that inflation is on track to 2%. That\u2019s because a labor market that\u2019s running too hot could put some upward pressure on prices, making the Fed\u2019s job of fully defeating inflation more difficult. The Fed chief says so far so good. \u201cOverall, a broad set of indicators suggest that conditions in the labor market have returned to about where they stood on the eve of the pandemic, relatively tight but not overheated,\u201d Powell said in his post-meeting press conference on Wednesday afternoon. He pointed to data proving just that: Job gains averaging\u00a0218,000 a month in April and May; unemployment still at low levels, job creation driven by more prime-aged workers and immigrants trickling into the workforce; slower wage growth; and a narrower jobs-to-workers ratio. The Fed focuses on the job market not just because of its implications on inflation, but also because the central bank is explicitly tasked by Congress to strive toward maximum employment. If the labor market unexpectedly weakens, then that could force the Fed to consider cutting rates, but Powell didn\u2019t sound concerned at all. \u201cWe see gradual cooling, gradual moving toward a better balance,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re monitoring it carefully for signs of something more than that, but we really don\u2019t see that.\u201d First rate cut in September? Wall Street\u2019s best bet for the first rate cut is currently September, according to futures, and those odds improved markedly after the release of the May CPI. For that to happen, however,\u00a0inflation\u00a0will have to continue to drift lower in the coming months. Officials frequently emphasize that they are \u201cdata dependent\u201d and make conclusions about the\u00a0economy\u00a0after data stretching over several months reveal a trend. It\u2019s unclear if the factors that resulted in hotter-than-expected\u00a0inflation\u00a0readings earlier this year are still lurking in the background, but the May CPI provided some relief. \u201cThe belief that components boosting\u00a0inflation\u00a0in the first quarter were not indicative of current cost pressures needed to be validated. May\u2019s report provides strong evidence on that front,\u201d Matt Colyar, an economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics, said in a note Wednesday. \u201cThe\u00a0Fed\u00a0is banking it can wait a few more months until\u00a0inflation\u00a0falls further.\u201d The US\u00a0economy\u00a0remains on strong footing for now, including the job market as employers continue to hire at a brisk pace. But it\u2019s unmistakable that some US consumers are under pressure. Still-high\u00a0inflation\u00a0is continuing to eat into some budgets, pandemic savings are drying up, borrowers continue to pile on more debt and the highest interest\u00a0rates\u00a0in nearly a quarter century are squeezing Americans.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/12/economy/june-fed-decision/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/13/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_11_us_peachtree-center-mall-shooting-atlanta", "text": "A 34-year-old man with an extensive criminal record shot and wounded three people in a popular downtown Atlanta food court Tuesday, before he was shot by a police officer and taken into custody, officials said. The victims, all three of whom are alive and being treated at area hospitals, include a 47-year-old man, a 69-year-old woman and a 70-year-old woman. They are all expected to survive, authorities said. \u201cThis is a busy area. This is where people work, and this is where people dine while they are at work so a lunchtime crowd was there and it was fairly active,\u201d Mayor Andre Dickens said. Police began receiving calls shortly after 2:15 p.m. Tuesday reporting shots fired at the food court of Peachtree Center, a hub of office spaces and stores, Atlanta Police Chief Darin Schierbaum said in the news conference. The suspect allegedly entered the food court armed with a handgun and had a \u201cbrief altercation\u201d with a person before shooting that individual, the police chief said, later clarifying the shooter \u201cphysically attacked\u201d the person before shooting them. The suspect then went on to shoot two other people who were in the food court, Schierbaum said. The suspect was then confronted by an off-duty Atlanta Police officer who was working an extra job. The officer confronted and shot the suspect, wounding him, the police chief said. A second officer kicked the gun away from the suspect, helping disarm him, the chief said. The Atlanta police officer \u201cacted decisively, placed himself in danger and ended that threat for the community,\u201d Schierbaum said. The suspect is a convicted felon who has served prison time for an armed robbery and has \u201c11 previous arrest cycles,\u201d the police chief said. \u201cThis is an individual that should never have been possessing a gun and an individual that should never have placed this community in harm.\u201d Authorities are working to determine how the suspect may have been connected to the individual he first attacked. Police have not shared any other identifying details about the suspect. The Georgia Bureau of Investigation will lead the investigation into the case, officials said. Peachtree Center, at the heart of the city\u2019s downtown, boasts more than \u201c1.5 million square feet\u201d of office space across four buildings, as well as 50 restaurants and retail shops and three hotels, according to its website. The building was placed on lockdown after the shooting but had reopened by late Tuesday afternoon, the mayor said. He had earlier warned residents to \u201cavoid the area.\u201d Just over two hours after the shooting unfolded, another man in Atlanta allegedly held the driver of a commuter bus at gunpoint, leading police on a rush hour chase while more than a dozen passengers remained in the vehicle. The suspect in that case was taken into custody, and one person who was found shot on the bus has died, police said. Authorities have said they do not believe the two incidents are connected.  \u201cToday has been a very active day, but let me be clear, we\u2019re talking about gun violence that is as a result of too many people having guns in their hands,\u201d Dickens said in an evening news conference that followed the bus hijacking. \u201cYou\u2019re talking about people that should not have been on the streets with guns.\u201d \u201cI think mental health is going to play a role in some of this, but you\u2019re talking about too many guns in the hands of individuals that should not have guns. Too many guns on our streets, too many guns in our homes, too many guns in our schools and buses,\u201d the mayor said. \u201cSo this is clearly an indication that something more needs to be done.\u201d This is a developing story and will be updated.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/11/us/peachtree-center-mall-shooting-atlanta/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/13/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_12_us_tulsa-race-massacre-lawsuit-dismissed-reaj", "text": "The Oklahoma Supreme Court dismissed a lawsuit arguing the remaining survivors of the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre should be compensated by the city for damages Wednesday, dealing a blow to their ongoing fight for reparations more than 100 years after the attack. Survivors Hughes Van Ellis, Viola Fletcher and Lessie Benningfield Randle initally filed the lawsuit in 2021. Ellis died last year at the age of 102. The lawsuit was previously dismissed by an Oklahoma district court judge, who agreed with the city of Tulsa that \u201csimply being connected to a historical event does not provide a person with unlimited rights to seek compensation.\u201d The plaintiffs appealed the case to the state\u2019s Supreme Court which acknowledged Wednesday that the \u201cgrievance with the social and economic inequities created by the Tulsa Race Massacre is legitimate and worthy of merit.\u201d \u201cHowever, the law does not permit us to extend the scope of our public nuisance doctrine beyond what the Legislature has authorized to afford Plaintiffs the justice they are seeking,\u201d the court wrote in its decision. Ellis, Fletcher and Benningfifeld Randle had argued that they had a right for reparations under the city\u2019s public nuisance statute. They also said the city of Tulsa was getting \u201cunjust enrichment\u201d by promoting the site of the massacre as a tourist attraction \u201cwithout returning any of those benefits to members of the community.\u201d \u201cThe destruction of forty-square blocks of property on the night of May 31, 1921 through murder and arson clearly meets the definition of a public nuisance under Oklahoma law.\u00a0Faithful application of the law compels the conclusion that Mother Randle and Mother Fletcher have stated a claim for relief,\u201d attorneys for Fletcher and Benningfield Randle said in a statement after the decision. \u201cThey are entitled\u00a0to\u00a0a trial.\u00a0Yet the Court held that Mother Randle and Mother Fletcher have asked the Court\u00a0to\u00a0decide a \u2018political\u2019 question that is beyond the purview of the Court,\u201d the attorneys added. In 1921, the Greenwood neighborhood was a thriving Black-owned business district in Tulsa, Oklahoma. On May 31, 1921, a White mob laid waste to about 35 blocks of the neighborhood within 16 hours, arresting thousands of Black residents, while robbing, beating and killing others, CNN previously reported. Historic photos show entire blocks gutted by flame and people lying in the street. Insurance companies later denied many claims filed by Black business owners over what today would be worth tens of millions of dollars in property damage, including the destruction of two Black hospitals and 1,256 residences, according to the Greenwood Cultural Center, CNN previously reported. Attorneys for Fletcher and Benningfield Randle said in their statement that they plan to file a petition for rehearing with the Oklahoma Supreme Court, asking the Court\u00a0to\u00a0reconsider its decision.

{"id": "2024_06_11_us_miami-dade-officer-indictment-2019-ups-shootout", "text": "Four Miami-Dade police officers have been indicted by a grand jury in connection with a 2019 shootout with suspects in a hijacked UPS truck that resulted in the deaths of a hostage delivery driver and a bystander, the Miami-Dade Police Department said Tuesday. The chaotic December 5, 2019, gun battle sent a spray of bullets across a crowded South Florida intersection as at least 18 officers from three jurisdictions pursued a pair of jewelry heist suspects who had hijacked the UPS truck and led authorities on a lengthy vehicle chase. The indictment is under seal, police said Tuesday. \u201cThe Miami-Dade Police Department is aware that four of its officers were recently indicted by a Broward County grand jury,\u201d the department said in a release. \u201cSince grand jury proceedings are not disclosed under Florida law until otherwise ordered by a judge, the information that we have is limited.\u00a0Our department respects the legal process to ensure transparency and accountability for our community.\u201d  Earlier this week, the South Florida Police Benevolent Association, a police union, said the indictment was expected. \u201cWe\u2019re extremely disappointed that after almost five years, these officers are finding themselves indicted for something they had seconds to decide,\u201d\u00a0South Florida Police Benevolent Association president Steadman Stahl said. The names of the indicted officers and the specific charges they face have not been publicly released. In a statement to CNN, the Broward County State Attorney\u2019s Office said: \u201cGrand jury proceedings are secret under Florida law, and any proceedings or actions taken by a grand jury are not public until a judge makes them so. We are not at liberty to comment at this time.\u201d Stahl pointed to the officers\u2019 indictments \u2013 as well as the indictment of a former school resource officer who was found not guilty for not entering an active mass shooting scene at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in 2018 \u2013 and warned that the prosecutions send mixed messages to law enforcement. \u201cIt sends a chilling effect to officers in Broward County that their state attorney\u2019s office prosecutes one officer for not responding to an active shooter and now indicting officers for responding to active shooters. As the process moves forward, we will monitor it and defend our officers,\u201d Stahl said. The 2019 confrontation began with an armed robbery at a jewelry store in Coral Gables, near Miami. The two suspects, Lamar Alexander and Ronnie Jerome Hill, then hijacked the UPS truck and took its driver hostage, leading police on a 30-mile chase that spanned two counties and was punctuated by occasional gunfire from the delivery truck. The chase ground to a halt at a traffic-packed intersection in Miramar, where gunfire wizzed between the suspects and police, some of whom were using their vehicles as impromptu shields. In the end, four people were shot and killed, including the two robbery suspects, a bystander, and\u00a0hostage UPS driver Frank Ordonez, who relatives say had been filling in\u00a0for a colleague who had called out from work that day. The bystander, Richard \u201cRick\u201d Cutshaw, was a local union field representative who was caught in the crossfire as he was driving home from work, according to Don Slesnick, a lawyer for the Office and Professional Employees International Union where Cutshaw worked. At least 13 police officers were shot at, but none were injured, Stahl said at the time.

Aaron Brown Myers, 51, was charged with second-degree murder and second-degree assault in the killing of the 17-year-old, identified as H.R., according to court documents. The teen was shot once in the side and at least six times in the back, and he died at the scene, the documents state. \u201cIn this case the defendant attacked three teenagers who had not committed any crime and at every stage of the interaction chose to escalate with more and more violence until it culminated in the defendant taking the life of 17-year-old H.R.,\u201d King County senior deputy prosecuting attorney Lauren M. Burke wrote in a case summary and request for bail. In a statement on Wednesday, attorneys for Myers said he was a \u201cprofessional security consultant\u201d and argued he fired in self-defense. \u201cWe are confident that over the course of this investigation the evidence will show that Mr. Myers\u2019 only intent that day was to protect himself and others from serious harm or death,\u201d attorneys Michelle Scudder and Zachary Wagnild said in an email to CNN. The incident began the evening of June 5 when H.R. and two other teenagers approached a Big 5 Sporting Goods store in Renton, Washington, according to the court documents. H.R. had an airsoft gun in a pocket, and a teenage friend, identified as B.A., had an airsoft gun in his coat pocket, according to court documents.  Myers, who is not a member of law enforcement, had decided to conduct \u201coverwatch\u201d at the parking lot and \u201cimmediately assumed\u201d the three teens were about to commit a violent robbery, the prosecutor wrote. Overwatch is a military term for surveilling a location. He exited his vehicle and pointed his pistol at the trio, commanding them to stop, drop their guns and get on the ground, the documents state. The teens complied and B.A. put the airsoft gun on the ground, saying it was just a \u201cBB gun,\u201d according to the prosecutor. The 51-year-old then tackled B.A. and pinned him to the ground, the documents state. H.R. had his hands in the air and was backing away, and Myers then shot at him at least seven times, killing the teen, according to the case summary. Myers was arrested at the scene and remains in custody at the King County Correctional Facility on $2 million bail, according to jail records. His arraignment is set for June 24. His attorneys said he acted because he believed he was witnessing a crime in progress. \u201cMr. Myers and his family are devastated by this tragedy and the fact that it resulted in the loss of a young man\u2019s life,\u201d the attorneys wrote. \u201cOn the evening in question Mr. Myers sincerely believed that he was witnessing the beginning of an armed robbery when he observed three young men pass his truck on their way into a store that was adjacent to the location where his son was attending a martial arts class. \u201cWhen he saw one of the men remove a firearm from his waistband Mr. Myers, a professional security consultant, intervened quickly in the hope of stopping the robbery before anyone got hurt.\u00a0Unfortunately, during the confrontation Mr. Myers became in fear for his own life and fired his duty weapon to defend himself.\u201d Incident was captured on surveillance video According to a probable cause document filed by the Renton Police Department, parts of the incident were captured on surveillance video from the Big 5 store and a martial arts business. CNN is working to obtain the videos, which have not been released publicly. According to the document, the video shows Myers approaching two of the teens and pointing a pistol at them, causing B.A. to put down the airsoft pistol and show his empty hands. H.R. also had his fingers extended to show his hands were empty and started to turn his body, the document states. Both his hands were initially raised over his head, and his right arm then briefly lowered before Myers \u2013 who was straddling B.A. on the ground \u2013 opened fire, the document states. B.A. told detectives he and H.R. liked to go into the woods and shoot things, but H.R.\u2019s airsoft gun was having issues, so they were going to the sporting goods store to exchange or return it, the document states. B.A. said his airsoft gun had been in his coat pocket, and H.R. did not take out his airsoft gun, according to the documents. \u201cB.A. said that they told Myers numerous times that the guns were BB guns,\u201d the document states. After he was shot, H.R. called out for his mom, the third teenager, identified as S.A., told investigators. In an interview with police, Myers said he conducts \u201coverwatch\u201d at the location and \u201chas seen numerous crimes occur in the parking lot in the past,\u201d according to a probable cause affidavit. Myers stated he saw three males walk in front of his parked vehicle and noticed one had a gun, and he believed they were going to commit an armed robbery, the affidavit says. \u201cMyers said that he felt like he did not have time to call 911, and that he felt he had a duty to act to stop the individuals from hurting someone innocent,\u201d the affidavit states. The affidavit states that \u201cmany\u201d of the details Myers told police were \u201cnot consistent\u201d with the surveillance video. Myers had previously been involved in a March 2022 incident in which he chose to \u201cintervene\u201d when he mistakenly believed someone was armed, according to the document. In that case, Myers called 911 to report that a person on a bicycle was pointing a gun at people, and Myers said he had a pistol and may have to intervene, the affidavit states. Myers then followed the bicyclist and told police he thought he might have to shoot the person. Officers arrived at the scene and determined the bicyclist\u2019s item was not a gun but \u201ca silver metal object that was possibly a part to a bicycle,\u201d the document states. Burke, the prosecutor, wrote that this prior incident \u201cestablishes that this self-imposed \u2018duty to intervene\u2019 is part of the defendant\u2019s regular approach to interacting with the public.\u201d \u201cOnly a high bail, electronic home detention, and surrender of all firearms will protect the community from an untrained civilian who believes he has a duty to shoot people who have not hurt anyone,\u201d she wrote.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/12/us/big-5-sporting-goods-shooting-washington/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/13/2024", "section": "us"}}

The\u00a02023 law, passed by Florida\u2019s Republican-led legislature and signed by Gov. Ron DeSantis, prohibits doctors and nurses from prescribing medication, including hormones or puberty blockers, to anyone under 18. \u201cThe State of Florida can regulate as needed but cannot flatly deny transgender individuals safe and effective medical treatment\u2014treatment with medications routinely provided to others with the state\u2019s full approval so long as the purpose is not to support the patient\u2019s transgender identity,\u201d the order states. The transgender plaintiffs and their parents argued the law violated their constitutional rights. In a 105-page order, Hinkle agreed, writing: \u201cWhether based on morals, religion, unmoored hatred, or anything else, prohibiting or impeding a person from conforming to the person\u2019s gender identity rather than to the person\u2019s natal sex is not a legitimate state interest.\u201d The order does not address the state law\u2019s ban on gender-affirming surgery for minors or surgery restrictions for adults as the lawsuit did not challenge those provisions, Hinkle noted. Simone Chriss, transgender rights initiative director at the nonprofit Southern Legal Counsel law firm, called the move \u201ca victory for the state of Florida\u201d in a statement. \u201cThe federal court saw Florida\u2019s transgender minor healthcare ban and adult restrictions for what they are\u2014discriminatory measures that cannot survive constitutional review,\u201d Chriss said. \u201cToday\u2019s ruling blocks the state of Florida\u2019s cruel campaign to deny fundamental rights and basic healthcare to its transgender citizens.\u201d In a statement following the order, DeSantis\u2019 office said the state will appeal the ruling. \u201cThrough their elected representatives, the people of Florida acted to protect children in this state, and the Court was wrong to override their wishes,\u201d the statement said. \u201cWe disagree with the Court\u2019s erroneous rulings on the law, on the facts, and on the science. As we\u2019ve seen here in Florida, the United Kingdom, and across Europe, there is no quality evidence to support the chemical and physical mutilation of children. These procedures do permanent, life-altering damage to children, and history will look back on this fad in horror.\u201d CNN has reached out to the Florida Department of Health for comment.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/11/us/federal-judge-blocks-florida-ban-youth-transgender-care/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/13/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_12_politics_john-roberts-recording-what-matters", "text": "The funny thing about \u201csecret\u201d recordings made of public figures is that they generally confirm what everyone already knew. The propriety of liberal activist Lauren Windsor pretending to be a religious conservative in order to surreptitiously record Supreme Court justices attending a dinner hosted by the Supreme Court Historical Society can certainly be debated. The effectiveness of publishing these recordings is clear. Putting the word \u201csecret\u201d in a headline about a recording guarantees more people will read it. The implication is that the subject is saying something they shouldn\u2019t, even if they are actually saying exactly what you\u2019d expect. For example: The secret recording of Mitt Romney talking at a fundraiser \u2013 about how the 47% of the population that would oppose him no matter what probably don\u2019t pay income tax \u2013 contributed to his 2012 presidential election loss in part because the comments rang true to the narrative of the campaign. Alito\u2019s comments are no surprise Did we need a secret recording to know that Justice Samuel Alito feels that religious Americans are being persecuted? We did not. It\u2019s written all over his opinions and his public appearances. Did we need a secret recording to know that Alito\u2019s wife, Martha-Ann, would bristle at having to look at Pride flags flown across the lagoon from their New Jersey beach house? Probably not, after she was scrutinized for flying an upside-down American flag \u2013 a distress signal \u2013 at their home in Virginia before Joe Biden\u2019s inauguration and a religious-themed \u201cAppeal to Heaven\u201d flag in New Jersey. Her German view of revenge against her detractors, which she explains in the recordings, is a new development. CNN\u2019s Joan Biskupic writes the following about Justice Alito: \u201cOver the years, Alito has demonstrated an us-versus-them attitude on religion, as well as ideological and political matters. He has declared religion under siege and cast himself on the side of the persecuted.\u201d Read more from Biskupic about how the Alito recordings will reinforce growing skepticism of the court and Alito\u2019s objectivity. Roberts said something interesting about the current state of politics Chief Justice John Roberts, who was also recorded, similarly sounded just like his public persona \u2013 carefully choosing words and avoiding controversial statements, such as when he argued that his Jewish and Muslim friends do not view the US as a Christian nation. Where Alito\u2019s aggrieved view of his own persecution inflames partisan divides, Roberts argued, with examples, for a more optimistic view of the current political moment, which he said is not nearly as bad as previous eras in US history. It\u2019s a view that explains how Roberts may see the court\u2019s role in the upcoming election, in which Biden says Donald Trump is a threat to democracy and in which Trump has promised to use victory as a path to retribution. Here are some key quotes from the recording of Roberts: This is indeed a broad historical view. The 1857 Dred Scott decision, which is a blot on the history of the court, ruled that slaves were not citizens of the US and not protected under the Constitution. It came a few years before the Civil War, which was fought over the issue of slavery. During the New Deal, then-President Franklin D. Roosevelt essentially remade the US government to handle the Great Depression. He was frequently at odds with the Supreme Court and unsuccessfully tried to pack the court to make it more to his liking. In the 1960s, the Civil Rights Movement and protest movement, along with a series of assassinations and the Vietnam War, tested the nation and the court. Roberts has long felt that one key piece of legislation, the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which was enacted to protect Black votes in the South, was an improper use of federal power. As chief justice in 2013, he oversaw a key decision that whittled away at the power of the Voting Rights Act, allowing Republicans in Southern states to draw more and more noncompetitive congressional districts that solidify their majorities in those states. Last year, however, Biskupic noted that he seemed to change course and helped uphold part of the Voting Rights Act. This is not the view of someone who sounds particularly concerned that American democracy is in danger. Roberts has also been loath to entertain the concerns of lawmakers. He refused to meet with Democratic senators, for instance, about mounting concerns over gifts Justice Clarence Thomas accepted from a billionaire buddy and after reports of the partisan flag displays at Alito\u2019s home. Democrats have also complained that Roberts has not done more to address the issue of partisan lawyers gaming how to get cases before judges they hope will be friendly. Windsor asked if Roberts believes what\u2019s happening right now is normal. His response: And the Supreme Court has not acted as if anything special is going on. Justices refused to allow Colorado to remove Trump from its primary ballot in a case involving the \u201cinsurrectionist clause.\u201d They denied special counsel Jack Smith\u2019s request for an expedited review of Trump\u2019s argument that, as a former president, he should enjoy some kind of super immunity from prosecution. Taking their time, the justices may effectively push Trump\u2019s federal criminal trials past Election Day. Windsor worries in the recording that polarization today is \u201cso extreme that it might be irreparable.\u201d In response, Roberts said this: Note: Roberts did not serve in Vietnam,  but he was a young man as American troops were withdrawing in 1973, a year before then-President Richard Nixon resigned as a result of the Watergate scandal. By the end of the decade, Roberts was a young attorney bound for the Ronald Reagan administration. Today, he\u2019s the chief justice exuding calm and acting aloof even as confidence in the branch of government he leads has fallen.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/12/politics/john-roberts-recording-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/13/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_12_politics_g7-ukraine-loan-agreement-announcement", "text": "Leaders representing the Group of Seven nations are set to announce as soon as Thursday an agreement to loan money to Ukraine backed by the profits from frozen Russian investments, according to sources familiar with the discussions, providing a new source of revenue to a war-torn nation facing a steep and costly road to recovery. Negotiators had focused discussions on a loan amount of roughly $50 billion, a figure that would represent the annual proceeds on the investments \u2013 which generate profit of about EUR 3 billion per year \u2013 over the course of 10 years. Western nations froze Russia\u2019s assets in bank accounts located within Europe and the US as part of a massive wave of sanctions enacted after Vladimir Putin ordered the invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Hundreds of billions of assets are frozen in Europe, with just a small amount \u2013 roughly $3 billion \u2013 located in banks in the US. That led European officials to raise concerns that they could be on the hook if Ukraine failed to pay back the loan, the investments generated less profit, or the assets get delivered back to Russia as part of a peace deal. A senior US official says negotiators, who have continued working out final details in Brindisi, Italy, ahead of the G7 leaders\u2019 arrival, have structured the deal so that all countries participating share the risk. \u201cThis loan will mostly be provided by the United States and will be supplemented by money from Europe,\u201d an \u00c9lys\u00e9e source told journalists at a briefing. \u201cCountries are still discussing how to partition the cost if the profits from Russian assets are not sufficient to cover the need,\u201d the French source added. The source spoke on the condition of anonymity, citing professional norms in Europe. \u201cThe $50 billion will be transferred before the end of 2024,\u201d the source said. US national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters traveling with President Joe Biden to the summit that the discussions were moving toward a \u201ccommon understanding\u201d of how the loan would be structured, though\u00a0multiple countries would participate and work out the technical details\u00a0after the summit. \u201cI believe that we are making good progress in generating an outcome in which those proceeds from those frozen assets can be put to good use,\u201d Sullivan said. G7 countries began brainstorming ways to identify longer-term sources of funding for Ukraine in late 2023, as lawmakers delayed in greenlighting the White House\u2019s funding request. Amid doubts on future political and financial wherewithal to continue spending taxpayer money in Ukraine \u2013 and facing a calendar stacked with elections on both sides of the Atlantic \u2013 officials began zeroing in on the Russian money gathering dust and interest payments in accounts around the world. Beginning in early 2023, working groups led by Treasury, State and the National Security Council officials held three, two-hour meetings each week beginning at 7 a.m. ET to accommodate time differences around the world. Banks and clearing houses that hold and process the funds raised concerns that simply taking the money would open up companies and countries alike to lawsuits and retribution from Russia. Utilizing the profits generated while Russia has no access to the money was conceived as a workaround that satisfied international legal concerns. \u201cIt\u2019s the difference between someone seizing your home and renting\u00a0out\u00a0your home,\u201d said Tim Adams, president and CEO of the Institute of International Finance. The United States has provided $175 billion to Ukraine since Russia\u2019s invasion, a total that now surpasses the $171 billion in 2024 dollars that the US provided to the Marshall Plan to rebuild Europe after World War II. The European Union has delivered $107 billion in aid. The World Bank estimates that Ukraine would need more than $500 billion to rebuild, a figure that climbs each day the war continues.

{"id": "2024_06_12_tech_spacex-elon-musk-former-employees-lawsuit", "text": "SpaceX and CEO Elon Musk were sued on Wednesday by former employees who claim they were illegally fired for raising concerns about gender discrimination and sexual harassment at the rocket company. The lawsuit, brought by eight employees who were fired in 2022, alleges that Musk wants to be \u201cthe leader to a brave new world of space travel, but runs his company in the dark ages \u2014 treating women as sexual objects to be evaluated on their bra size, bombarding the workplace with lewd sexual banter, and offering the reprise to those who challenge the \u2018Animal House\u2019 environment that if they don\u2019t like it they can seek employment elsewhere,\u201d according to the complaint, filed in state court in California. The eight former employees were involved in writing a 2022 open letter criticizing Musk and urging SpaceX executives to make the firm\u2019s culture more inclusive. The letter, which was signed by at least 400 other employees, asked SpaceX management to make it clear that Musk\u2019s statements \u2014 particularly on Twitter \u2014 did not reflect the views or values of the company and asserted that SpaceX\u2019s so-called \u201cNo A**hole\u201d policy was unevenly enforced. Following the letter\u2019s release, the eight employees were fired. Wednesday\u2019s complaint alleges that \u201cMusk personally ordered the Plaintiff\u2019s terminations.\u201d SpaceX did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the lawsuit. SpaceX does not typically respond to queries from news organizations. In response to the 2022 letter, SpaceX COO Gwynne Shotwell previously said she would enforce SpaceX\u2019s \u201czero tolerance\u201d standards against employee harassment, but the The New York Times reported that she said the employees had been fired for making other staff feel \u201cuncomfortable.\u201d SpaceX previously faced similar complaints filed to the National Labor Relations Board over the termination of employees involved in the letter. Those complaints claimed that the terminations amounted to employees being fired for engaging in \u201cconcerted protected activities.\u201d One former employee who filed an NLRB complaint and is a plaintiff in the Wednesday lawsuit, Tom Moline, previously told CNN that SpaceX management used an \u201c\u2018ends justifies the means\u2019 philosophy to turn a blind eye to the ongoing mistreatment, harassment, and abuse reported by my colleagues, much of which was directly encouraged and inspired by the words and actions of the CEO.\u201d Earlier this year, SpaceX responded to a consolidated complaint from the NLRB with its own lawsuit, alleging that the structure of the NLRB itself is \u201cunconstitutional.\u201d Wednesday\u2019s complaint details the statements by Musk and the actions of other workers that the fired employees claim contributed to a hostile work environment and \u201cpervasively sexist culture\u201d at SpaceX. It points to multiple crude posts by Musk on Twitter, now called X, such as one containing a plan \u201cto create a Texas university similar to MIT which he would call \u2018TITS\u2019 and where \u2018Ds [women\u2019s bra size] would get degrees,\u2019 accompanied by an altered photo rendering a rocket to appear to be a giant penis,\u201d the complaint states. It also references a post from Musk, shared the day after Business Insider published a report claiming Musk had sexually harassed a flight attendant, in which the billionaire said: \u201cFinally, we get to use Elongate as scandal name. It\u2019s kinda perfect,\u201d along with a laughing emoji. (Musk has\u00a0denied\u00a0the harassment claims.) \u201cMusk\u2019s conduct of interjecting this juvenile, grotesque sexual banter into the workplace had the wholly foreseeable and intentional result of encouraging other employees to engage in similar conduct,\u201d Wednesday\u2019s complaint states. The former employees allege that engineers commonly applied \u201ccrude and demeaning names to products in an attempt at humor, often at the expense of women and LGBTQ+ individuals. For example, the name \u2018Upskirt Camera\u2019 was used for a camera on first stage of the Falcon rocket that views the bottom of the second stage,\u201d according to the complaint. In one instance, a SpaceX HR director responded to allegations of inappropriate workplace behavior at an internal event by saying: \u201cI\u2019ve never been sexually harassed; I must not be hot enough,\u201d the complaint alleges. The lawsuit adds that the former employees believe \u201cSpaceX has not taken action to redress the harassment, hostile work-environment, and retaliation.\u201d The former employees are seeking unspecified monetary damages to account for \u201clost wages, earnings, and other employee benefits, emotional distress.\u201d This story has been updated with additional details and context.

The indictment against Prieto alleges he discussed his plans between January and May with two people whom he believed \u201cshared his racist beliefs,\u201d unaware they were working with the FBI, the US Attorney\u2019s Office said. He then sold an AK-style rifle and an AR-style rifle to one of those individuals within the span of a month, all while under FBI surveillance, the release said. Prieto was targeting a concert scheduled for May 14 and May 15 at State Farm Arena in downtown Atlanta, according to a statement of probable cause attached to the federal complaint. While it does not specify whose concert Prieto allegedly targeted, a schedule for the venue shows Puerto Rican rapper and singer Bad Bunny was slated to perform there on those dates. After his arrest, Prieto denied he was going to Atlanta, but he did admit to knowing the two people who were working with the FBI, and told agents he had no intentions of carrying out the attack, the federal complaint states. CNN has reached out to Prieto\u2019s public defender in New Mexico for comment. If convicted, the charges of firearms trafficking and transfer of a firearm for use in a hate crime each carry a maximum sentence of 15 years in prison and a $250,000 fine, the US Attorney\u2019s Office said. A conviction for possession of an unregistered firearm carries a sentence of up to 10 years and a $250,000 fine. Indictment outlines monthslong undercover operation One of the individuals Prieto confided in was an undercover FBI agent, while the other was a confidential source who\u2019d spoken with Prieto more than a dozen times at different gun shows over the last three years, according to the complaint. That source told the FBI in late 2023 that Prieto had made comments advocating for a mass shooting targeting \u201cblacks, Jews, or Muslims,\u201d the complaint says. Prieto wanted to carry the shooting out prior to the election in November, the complaint says, because he believed martial law would be in place afterwards, making the attack impossible. The source and the undercover agent met with Prieto at four different gun shows in each of the months between January and May, the complaint states. At the first, Prieto allegedly shared his plans to carry out a shooting in Atlanta \u2013 specifically at a rap concert, the complaint says, because Prieto believed there would be a high concentration of Black people. Prieto said he was focused on Georgia because of what he perceived as its shifting politics; he attributed this to its Black population, which he referred to using the n-word, the complaint says. Over the next few months, Prieto allegedly provided more and more detail about his attack, outlining which weapons and types of ammo he wanted the group to use and what they would wear, the complaint shows. He also allegedly expressed a desire to travel to Atlanta prior to the shooting to set up weapon caches. Prieto wanted to ensure the attack was seen as racially motivated, saying he wanted to leave Confederate flags at the scene and say things like, \u201cwhities out here killing,\u201d and \u201cKKK all the way,\u201d according to the complaint. He \u201calso emphasized that the most important thing was a high body count,\u201d the complaint states. At a fifth gun show in early May, Prieto told the source he was going to leave for Atlanta to conduct reconnaissance and they would meet again at another gun show scheduled for the weekend of June 1, the complaint says. After being read his Miranda rights on May 14, the complaint says, Prieto denied he was going to Atlanta, telling investigators he was bound for Florida to visit his mother. He admitted to knowing both the undercover agent and the confidential source and to having discussed an attack at a \u201crock\u201d concert, the complaint says, but he told agents he did not intend to carry out the attack.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/12/us/arizona-man-indicted-plan-attack-targeting-black-people-atlanta-concert/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/13/2024", "section": "us"}}

But the man and his former attorney say he has never stepped foot in Spain and have insisted he is innocent. David Knezevich, 36, was arraigned and pleaded not guilty on Monday to a kidnapping charge in federal court in Miami \u2013 four months after his wife was last seen in Madrid, according to court records. His wife, Ana Maria Knezevich Henao, has not been heard from since February 2, the day a man wearing a face covering and helmet \u2013 who prosecutors allege was Knezevich \u2013 entered her apartment building in Madrid and spray-painted the lens of a building surveillance camera. About an hour later, the man emerged from an elevator with a suitcase, according to the criminal complaint. Before Knezevich\u2019s arrest in Florida in May, his attorney at the time, Kenneth Padowitz, told CNN that his client \u201chas never been to Spain\u201d and had nothing to do with the incident. But investigators allege Knezevich has been tied to the crime using the can of spray paint, security camera footage, stolen license plates and rental car records, as well as messages he sent to a woman he\u2019d met on a dating app. If convicted, the husband faces a maximum sentence of life in prison. How FBI investigators built their case Knezevich\u2019s current attorney, Jayne C. Weintraub, filed a request on Monday to the court for a hearing on the court\u2019s order of detention, asking to cross-examine an FBI agent regarding new evidence and allegations in the case since a detention hearing last month. The couple had lived in Florida and were planning to divorce, but the separation had become tense because Knezevich didn\u2019t want to evenly split their assets, the criminal complaint said. Padowitz, however, told CNN in February that the split was amicable. Henao had moved to Spain in December and had been living in an apartment in an apartment in Madrid\u2019s upscale Salamanca neighborhood, court documents said. When Henao disappeared from her apartment in February, Knezevich was far away in his native Serbia, Knezevich\u2019s former attorney Padowitz has said. But federal officials said records show Knezevich flew from Miami to Turkey in January and then went to Belgrade, Serbia, where he rented a small car on January 29. The owner of the rental car agency told investigators that when the car was returned in mid-March, someone had tinted its windows and added a new license plate frame, and it had traveled nearly 4,800 miles, the criminal complaint said. Toll booth cameras captured images of the same model Peugeot, with tinted windows, near Madrid in the late night and early morning of February 2 and 3. It had\u00a0license plates stolen from another vehicle on the Madrid street where Henao was living, the complaint said. Shortly after 9 p.m. the night of Henao\u2019s disappearance, a man wearing a face covering and helmet but with \u201cphysical characteristics\u201d resembling Knezevich entered her apartment building and partially obscured the surveillance camera with spray paint, investigators said. Spanish investigators identified the brand of spray paint and determined that a Madrid retailer had sold the same paint, along with two rolls of duct tape, to a man who resembled Knezevich the same day Henao was last seen, the criminal complaint said. Henao, a US citizen originally from Colombia, was in constant communication with her loved ones while overseas. She was planning a trip to Barcelona with her friends on February 5, her brother told CNN, but she abruptly stopped communicating and never showed up for the trip. Two days before the trip, her friend Sanna Rameau received a puzzling WhatsApp message from Henao indicating she was abruptly leaving town with a man she had just met. The message, seen by CNN, read: \u201cI met someone wonderful!! He has a summer house about 2h (hours) from Madrid. We are going there now and I will spend a few days there. Signal is spotty. I\u2019ll call you when I get back.\u201d Henao and Rameau had spoken by phone just hours before her disappearance but she had not mentioned meeting a dreamy stranger, Rameau told CNN. Investigators allege the texts sent from Henao\u2019s phone were really sent by her husband. He is believed to have asked another Colombian woman whom he had met on a dating app to help translate the messages into Colombian, court documents said. The message he sent to the unidentified Colombian woman to translate was the same one sent from Henao\u2019s phone saying she\u2019d met a new guy, court documents said.

{"id": "2024_06_11_us_dog-saves-stranded-owner-oregon", "text": "When Troy Millhollin saw his friend Brandon Garrett\u2019s dog Blue come into their\u00a0camp alone with scratches on his nose, he had a feeling something was wrong. \u201cWhen (Blue) showed up without his sister, Nova, I was like, \u2018That\u2019s not normal,\u2019\u201d Millhollin told CNN. Millhollin, 46, and Garrett, 60, had been driving in separate vehicles from Halfway, Oregon, to a camp in the woods the afternoon of June 2. Every summer, the two set up camp there for a couple of days to cut firewood. Garrett should have been right behind him that day, Millhollin said, but his friend never arrived. While waiting, he realized the scratches on Blue\u2019s nose were actually cuts, and decided to drive back to town to find his friend. In town, no one had seen or heard from Garrett, Millhollin said. He reached out to other friends in the area who started searching. By morning, Garrett still hadn\u2019t shown up. Millhollin then called Garrett\u2019s brother, Tyree Garrett,\u00a0who also started searching with a friend. Having grown up in the area, Tyree Garrett remembered there were two places on the creek not visible from the road where a vehicle could have tumbled into. At the first location he checked on US Forest Service Road 39, he found the pickup truck his brother was driving. But it wasn\u2019t a reassuring sight. \u201cI could see the injured dogs laying down there and I kept yelling for\u00a0my brother,\u201d the younger Garrett said. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t answer.\u201d There was no cell service at the site of the crash, so he had to leave to call for help. \u201cI thought for sure when I was making the 911 call that I was calling just for a body recovery,\u201d Tyree Garrett told CNN. \u201cSo I was pretty heartbroken at the\u00a0time.\u201d Later, the family would realize Blue had traveled approximately 4 miles from where he and his owner had crashed to find and alert Millhollin. \u2018I was hoping just to survive\u2019 Meanwhile, Brandon Garrett had spent the night in the ravine, hoping help would arrive. The accident had happened when he started to fall asleep while driving, Garrett told CNN: \u201cI thought I\u2019d make camp and I didn\u2019t. I\u2019d come to taking a bad line on the corner and lost the whole thing and it beat me up pretty good.\u201d Garrett said he was thrown through the windshield downhill as the truck swerved into the ravine. The truck flipped right next to him.\u00a0Unable to move much, he leaned against the truck and lost consciousness. When Garrett came to, it was raining heavily and he was waist deep into the creek, so he crawled back in for some shelter. \u201cI knew it was going to be touch and go to make it to dawn,\u201d he said.  He didn\u2019t see Blue, but he had his three other dogs to keep him company \u2013 but they, too, were injured. \u201cI was hoping just to survive because it didn\u2019t really look like it at that point. I was in a spot where I couldn\u2019t be seen from the road,\u201d Garrett said. Just before 9:30 a.m. on June 3, the\u00a0Baker County Sheriff\u2019s Office dispatch received Tyree Garrett\u2019s report of the crash, according to a\u00a0news release.\u00a0Law enforcement and Baker County Search and Rescue responded to the scene. When he arrived, Sheriff Travis Ash saw Brandon Garrett\u2019s vehicle tilted on its side in the steep ravine, the release stated. Ash heard Garrett shouting and found him 100 yards from the vehicle with the three other dogs. Ash provided first aid as the county rescue ropes team prepared to get Garrett. They eventually secured him in a rescue basket, connected it to a highline rope system and pulled him across the ravine. Garrett was later airlifted to a regional hospital, the sheriff\u2019s office said. Garrett told CNN he sustained a hairline fracture in his foot and some lacerations. He is recovering at home. Garrett also said he was driving\u00a0Millhollin\u2019s truck the day of the accident, and now hopes to raise money to replace it for his friend. But Millhollin insists that he rest. \u201cI\u2019m not worried about the truck. As long as they all were okay. That\u2019s what mattered,\u201d Millhollin said. Three of Garrett\u2019s dogs \u2013 including Blue \u2013 are with him as he recovers, but one still isn\u2019t back from the veterinarian. It was no surprise to those who know Blue \u2013 who is part Pitbull, Australian Shepherd and Whippet, among other breeds \u2013 that he knew where to go after the accident. Garrett said he often spends time with the dogs in those woods, and Blue in particular knows the area so well that he can find Garrett in the woods, find his way home or navigate to Millhollin\u2019s house. \u201cI\u2019ve been around dogs my whole life,\u201d Tyree Garrett said. \u201cThey\u2019ve got a great sense of direction and they\u2019re just really savvy creatures.\u201d Brandon Garrett described his companions as simply, \u201cmy best friends.\u201d CNN\u2019s Kara Mihm contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/11/us/dog-saves-stranded-owner-oregon/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/13/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_11_us_ucla-campus-palestine-protests-arrests", "text": "A total of 27 people were arrested after setting up multiple pro-Palestinian encampments on\u00a0UCLA\u2019s\u00a0campus Monday that police said were unlawful, according to a\u00a0statement\u00a0from\u00a0UCLA\u00a0leadership. At least six University of California Police Department personnel and other safety officers were injured during confrontations with protesters, including one person with a head injury, said Rick Braziel, UCLA\u2019s associate vice chancellor for campus safety, in\u00a0a statement Tuesday.  UCPD Captain Scott Scheffler said at least five of those arrested reported minor injuries, including soreness, bruises and shoulder pain. As a result of the encampments, the group damaged a fountain, spray-painted brick walkways, tampered with fire safety equipment, damaged patio furniture, stripped wire from electrical fixtures and vandalized vehicles, police said in a statement. University officials are still trying to determine how many of the 27 people arrested are students, but those who are will be subject to disciplinary action, Braziel said. \u201cThis was completely unacceptable,\u201d Braziel said. \u201cThe demonstration activity disregarded our values as a community, violated our campus policies and broke the law. These actions injured people, threatened the safety of our community and vandalized our campus.\u201d While protests spread at college campuses this spring denouncing Israel\u2019s handling of its war against Hamas in Gaza, UCLA\u2019s campus turned into a scene of brutality on April 30 when violent counterprotesters attacked pro-Palestinian demonstrators. A CNN analysis found that some of the most dramatic attacks caught on camera that night were committed by people outside UCLA \u2013 not the university students and faculty who were eventually arrested. But on Monday, a group of about 100 people associated with a\u00a0UCLA\u00a0registered student organization set up an encampment at the top of the Janss Steps around 3:15 p.m., UCPD said. The group resisted leaving the area after initial warnings but left after UCPD issued multiple dispersal orders. The protesters relocated to the Kerckhoff patio, where they \u201cset up an unauthorized and unlawful encampment with tents, canopies, and barricades with patio furniture,\u201d police said. The group also entered Moore Hall and disrupted nearby final exams, police said. Another round of dispersal orders led the group to the courtyard between Dodd Hall and the School of Law, where they set up a third encampment, according to police. UCLA Associate Professor Graeme Blair, a member of Faculty for Justice in Palestine, said one student went to a hospital after getting wounded by a rubber bullet \u2013 which Blair said was fired when students were in the camp near Dodd Hall, the Los Angeles Times reported. Blair, who has participated in the protests, criticized authorities, saying students had been following dispersal orders throughout the evening. CNN has reached out to Blair for comment. A UC Police representative declined to comment on the arrests or say whether \u201cless than lethal\u201d weapons were used, the Times reported. UCLA police did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment Tuesday about the arrests and whether rubber bullets were used. On Monday evening, about 25 people were arrested around 8 p.m. for willful disruption of university operations, the police statement said. Those individuals were cited, issued a 14-day stay-away order from\u00a0UCLA\u00a0property and released, police said. Another person was previously arrested during the setup of the first encampment for interfering with a police officer. That person was cited and released, UCPD said. About 150 protesters remained in the area as of 10:30 p.m. Monday. The university expects more protests at various locations during commencement ceremonies but they \u201cwill not tolerate violence,\u201d Braziel said, adding university policies \u201csupport advocacy that does not jeopardize safety or disrupt university operations.\u201d \u201cProtecting UCLA faculty, staff, students and visitors and creating an environment conducive to teaching, learning, working and living continues to be our priority. The campus community belongs to all of us and we must model the respect we expect to receive from others,\u201d Braziel said. Tensions have simmered on the UCLA campus over how the university has responded to protesters and counterprotesters in recent months. Faculty members have been divided over whether Chancellor Gene Block \u201cfailed to ensure the safety of our students and grievously mishandled the events.\u201d This is a developing story and will be updated.
