Air traffic controllers cleared the FedEx Boeing 767 to land on Runway 18 Left and had also approved the Southwest Airlines Boeing 737 jet to take off using the same runway, the NTSB said. The FedEx crew realized they were about to land on top of the Southwest plane and called for the Southwest crew to abort the takeoff. The FedEx crew then aborted their landing \u2013 averting what could have been a mass disaster. The incident came amid a sharp rise in \u201crunway incursions\u201d last year. The NTSB on Wednesday said that a near-collision between two planes at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York in January 2023 was caused by pilots who were repeatedly distracted in the cockpit. The Federal Aviation Administration responded to the string of incidents with additional controller training and a rare national safety summit.\u00a0There have been at least seven in that top category so far this year \u2013 classified in FAA nomenclature as level A or B. Of the 23 near-collisions last year, Austin was the closest. \u201cThis really could have ended up in catastrophe and the death of 133 people,\u201d Homendy told CNN after the board meeting. Air traffic controller had \u2018inaccurate mental model\u2019 The hearing on Thursday offered further details on the near-collision and recommendations for how to prevent such an incident going forward. The air traffic controller who had cleared both flights, Damian Campbell, later told NTSB investigators that he \u201ccouldn\u2019t see anything\u201d\u00a0on\u00a0the ground through the fog. The NTSB\u2019s new findings show that when the Southwest pilot radioed the tower, the controller \u201cnever determined the accurate position of the airplane\u201d prior to clearing\u00a0its\u00a0takeoff. His incorrect assumption was the Southwest plane could take off before an incoming FedEx jet landed on the same runway. However, taxiing and takeoff take longer in poor weather, and the Southwest plane sat on the runway for 19 seconds performing a procedure\u00a0that is\u00a0required under the weather conditions, the board said. The board concluded\u00a0the controller\u00a0used an \u201cinaccurate mental model\u201d and was biased in his past experience of Southwest pilots promptly departing when he assumed the Southwest jet could make it in time. Ultimately, the FedEx plane was between 150 and 175 feet away from landing atop the Southwest plane before anyone spotted potential disaster. A FedEx pilot said in an NTSB interview he saw the silhouette of the Southwest wing appear through the clouds and quickly pulled away. The weather in Austin that day was so foggy that the controller later told investigators he was listening for the Southwest plane\u2019s engines to know whether it had taken off.\u00a0After the FedEx pilot averted the collision, the controller issued instructions that suggested he believed the Southwest jet was still on the ground, a board member said. \u201cThat is not indicative of a safe aviation system,\u201d Homendy said. \u201cThat\u2019s not safety.\u201d The NTSB issued seven recommendations Thursday based on the Austin incident, including installing technology at all commercial airports to detect movement of planes and vehicles on the ground.\u00a0The technology is currently only in use at a few dozen airports. The NTSB called on the FAA to require pilots to report their position frequently when taxiing in limited visibility conditions. The board also revealed alarming conditions for the weather office at the Austin airport, although the members did not fault the observer on duty. The windowless weather office has no internet access and no cell phone service. And the office has an FAA-issued computer but no password to log on.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/06/us/near-collision-airport-runway-austin/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/09/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_08_us_nitrogen-hypoxia-execution-adoption-legislation", "text": "The day after Alabama carried out the first-known US execution using nitrogen gas, its attorney general sent a clear message to death penalty states that might want to follow suit: \u201cAlabama has done it, and now so can you.\u201d Indeed, in the weeks immediately following the January execution of Kenneth Smith, it appeared a handful of states were listening, introducing bills that would adopt the method known as nitrogen hypoxia or a similar one. Officials behind each framed the legislation as an alternative method that could help resume executions where they had long been stalled. But months later \u2013 as the circumstances of Smith\u2019s death continue to fuel debate about nitrogen hypoxia \u2013 it\u2019s also increasingly unclear whether more states will, in earnest, follow Alabama in implementing the method, which involves replacing the air breathed by the condemned inmate with 100% nitrogen, depriving them of oxygen. Oklahoma and Mississippi have also legalized nitrogen hypoxia, but Alabama, which plans to execute a second inmate with nitrogen gas this fall, is the sole state to have put someone to death using it. Only one of the recently proposed state bills authorizing such a form of execution has been signed into law: Two were stuck before committees when their state legislatures adjourned this year, and a sponsor of the third acknowledged its future is uncertain. \u201cWe\u2019re not seeing a lot of states jumping on board,\u201d said Robert Dunham, director of the Death Penalty Policy Project at Phillips Black, a nonprofit law firm that specializes in post-conviction legal representation, describing the bills so far as \u201ca reflexive reaction by some legislators in some states who are desperate to find alternatives to lethal injection.\u201d \u201cI think that in states in which there is not a reflexive reaction and legislators actually take time to consider what it means to suffocate a prisoner to death with nitrogen gas or other gas, you are unlikely to see gas adopted as an alternative.\u201d Meantime, several manufacturers of nitrogen gas have said they oppose their products being used for executions, echoing the kind of bans many pharmaceutical companies have instituted for their drugs in lethal injections \u2013 thus prompting states to seek an alternative. To head off this complication, the bills proposing nitrogen hypoxia and the like also aim to implement or expand protections shielding those involved with executions from being publicly identified. Taken together, the middling legislative efforts, vocal resistance of some gas producers and declining public support for capital punishment signal nitrogen executions may not be widely embraced among US death penalty states \u2013 at least for now. \u201cThere are very few states that are actually still interested in executing prisoners,\u201d Dunham said. \u201cOne execution is not enough experience to predict what is going to happen among the handful of states that want to get back in the business of killing prisoners. But beyond the initial reflexive introduction of bills in a small number of states, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s going to be a larger first wave of attempts to expand execution methods across the country.\u201d One bill passes \u2026 While some US states decades ago used lethal gas to execute prisoners, the use of nitrogen hypoxia is new. And within weeks of Smith\u2019s execution, legislators in Louisiana, Ohio and Kansas put forward bills to adopt nitrogen hypoxia, while a fourth bill in Nebraska that predated Smith\u2019s execution got renewed attention. It was a small group, given capital punishment remains legal in 27 states and in federal court. \u201cOften what states do is they imitate,\u201d said Austin Sarat, a professor of political science and law at Amherst College who has written extensively and critically about the death penalty. He cast nitrogen hypoxia as just the latest method for states to seize upon in their search since the late 19th century for \u201ca method of execution that would be safe, reliable and humane.\u201d Only Louisiana\u2019s bill, though, has received the governor\u2019s signature, making it the fourth state to adopt nitrogen hypoxia. HB 6 passed during a special session called by Republican Gov. Jeff Landry in February to address a wish list of criminal justice items. Its author, GOP state Rep. Nicholas Muscarello, told CNN he expected his legislation \u2013 which also re-authorized the use of electrocution \u2013 to facilitate the return of executions in the state, which hasn\u2019t put someone to death since 2010. Still, Muscarello anticipated most executions would be carried out using lethal injection, he said. When the regular session convened, however, it was clear the act would not go into effect without a fight. Another bill, SB 430, was introduced by Democratic state Sen. Katrina Jackson-Andrews, seeking to undo HB 6\u2019s nitrogen gas provision while preserving its other pieces. Jackson-Andrews, who did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for an interview, had the vocal backing of a coalition called Jews Against Gassing, which opposes gas executions because they echo the Holocaust, when 6 million Jews were murdered by Nazi Germany before and during World War II. \u201cWhen this came up, it evoked trauma for me,\u201d Jacquelyn Stern, 70, a member of the coalition, said of HB 6. She described knowing survivors of the Holocaust and going to school with their children, all of whom were deeply traumatized. \u201cIt flies in the face of what a civilized community ought to be, to want to gas people when this is what Nazi Germany did,\u201d she said. \u201cHere we are, in Louisiana, just turning a blind eye to that.\u201d SB 430 passed the Louisiana state Senate with bipartisan support. But when it went before the state House Committee on the Administration of Criminal Justice on May 21, the committee rejected it, killing the bill and leaving Stern feeling disappointed, helpless and unrepresented. \u2026 while the other bills languish Ohio\u2019s bill appears to be the only other legislation in this vein that could be adopted. Republican state Reps. Phil Plummer and Brian Stewart proposed HB 392 with the support of the state\u2019s GOP attorney general, who said nitrogen hypoxia could bring \u201cclosure\u201d to victims after years of the state struggling to obtain the drugs necessary for lethal injections, leading to an effective moratorium on Ohio\u2019s death penalty. Plummer echoed that, seeing the bill as a way for the state to again put violent killers to death, he told CNN. \u201cWe decided to follow step with Alabama with the nitrogen hypoxia as just another method,\u201d he said. \u201cThe important thing here is we\u2019re not changing the death penalty. It\u2019s already in statutes. But we\u2019re just giving government another option.\u201d The bill remains before the state House Government Oversight Committee, which Plummer said would hold three hearings before it\u2019s approved: One for the bill\u2019s sponsors and another for its proponents are complete; the third, for those opposed, has yet to be scheduled. At the first hearing, Plummer and Stewart were questioned by committee members, including Democrats who invoked Alabama\u2019s execution of Smith, echoing debate there over whether that execution was humane. Ahead of Smith\u2019s execution, critics had raised alarms, fearing elements contained in Alabama\u2019s protocol \u2013\u00a0which has only been made public in heavily redacted form\u00a0\u2013 would lead to undue suffering for the inmate. The state argued against these claims, saying in court records nitrogen hypoxia was perhaps the most humane execution method ever. After he was dead, both sides pointed to Smith\u2019s execution as evidence their claim had been borne out. GOP Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall called it \u201ctextbook,\u201d while critics pointed to witness accounts that Smith shook and writhed on the gurney for minutes before his death and did not slip into unconsciousness within seconds as the state, citing its own expert, claimed he would. Plummer dismissed the criticism, telling CNN, \u201cThe critics always complain things like that are inhumane. That\u2019s their talking point.\u201d \u201cWe don\u2019t want people to suffer. But at the end of the day, it\u2019s the law, and it\u2019s our job to enact the law,\u201d he said, adding he was open to hearing about alternatives. It\u2019s unclear whether Ohio\u2019s HB 392 will pass. Plummer attributed the uncertainty to division within the state\u2019s Republican caucus after a taxing House speaker\u2019s race. Meantime, legislatures in Kansas and Nebraska both adjourned without passing their respective bills, and each would need to be reintroduced to be considered again. Nebraska\u2019s LB 970 is listed as \u201cindefinitely postponed.\u201d Its sponsor, Republican state Sen. Loren Lippincott, declined an interview but in an email said he had yet to decide whether to reintroduce the legislation next year. Separately, Kansas\u2019 HB 2782 \u2013 which would add \u201chypoxia\u201d as an execution method but does not specify the use of nitrogen gas \u2013 got a hearing before the state House Committee on Judiciary but appeared to progress no further. GOP Kansas Attorney General Kris Kobach, whose office requested introduction of the bill, will seek to have a similar one introduced during next year\u2019s legislative session, a spokesperson told CNN. Some gas producers are opposed \u2026 Beyond sputtering legislation, states hoping to implement nitrogen executions could face another hurdle: lacking the elements to carry them out. Among its proponents, a stated benefit of nitrogen hypoxia has been the readily available nature of nitrogen gas, which makes up about 78% of Earth\u2019s atmosphere and is used widely across various industries for an untold number of applications. But several companies certified by the US Food and Drug Administration to produce nitrogen gas for human use have confirmed to CNN they oppose or would not allow their products to be used for the purposes of carrying out executions, as first reported by The Guardian. For example, AirGas \u2013 owned by Air Liquide, a French company \u2013 \u201chas not and will not supply nitrogen or other inert gases to induce hypoxia for the purpose of human execution,\u201d it told CNN in a statement. \u201cSince 2019, Airgas has publicly articulated its position that supplying nitrogen for the purpose of human execution is not consistent with our company values,\u201d the statement said, \u201cand that position has not changed.\u201d Similarly, Linde, a European company, \u201chas a long-standing policy prohibiting the sale of our gases for use as an asphyxiant applied to humans,\u201d it said in a statement to CNN. \u201cWe do not knowingly sell to third parties nor offer bids on contracts seeking to secure gases for this purpose.\u201d And Air Products, another company, told CNN it had \u201cestablished prohibited end uses for our products, which includes the use of any of our industrial gas products for the intentional killing of any person (including nitrogen hypoxia).\u201d While not an exhaustive survey of nitrogen producers, opposition by these companies echoes that of pharmaceutical drugmakers who prohibited their products from being used in lethal injections. Sarat linked companies\u2019 objection \u2013 whether they produce nitrogen or drugs \u2013 to the current \u201cperiod of national reconsideration of capital punishment,\u201d including not just declines in the numbers of executions and death sentences but also in public support for the death penalty. A Gallup Poll published last November found only 47% of Americans believe the death penalty is fairly applied, while 53% support the death penalty for a convicted murderer overall \u2013 far below the 80% peak seen in 1994. \u201cAs doubts emerge about capital punishment, as people begin to think maybe this isn\u2019t such a great idea, companies who are in the business of manufacturing pharmaceuticals, or companies that produce nitrogen, won\u2019t want their products associated with the American death penalty,\u201d said Sarat. \u201cWould it surprise me that there might be supply problems? No, it wouldn\u2019t surprise me.\u201d \u2026 as states seek to expand secrecy rules For their part, the states mulling nitrogen hypoxia appear to have anticipated this, building into their proposed bills language preventing suppliers from being publicly identified. Louisiana\u2019s HB 6 specifically added a provision that would \u201censure the absolute confidentiality of the identifying information of any person, business, organization, or other entity directly or indirectly involved in the execution of a death sentence\u201d in the state. \u201cThis confidentiality provision shall prevail over any conflicting provision in state law related to public disclosure.\u201d Information about purchases for executions would be disclosed to the state inspector general, who would examine that information and certify the purchases, the bill notes. Similarly, Ohio\u2019s HB 392 expands already-existing protections, extending the prohibition of the release of \u201cexecution identifying information\u201d to anyone who manufactures, distributes, prepares or administers a drug or gas for an execution. That provision, Plummer told CNN, was intended to prevent Ohio from having the same acquisition troubles with nitrogen as it does with lethal injection drugs, preventing suppliers from falling victim to public backlash. \u201cWe\u2019re just trying to give a layer of protection to the makers of the substance we need,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause cancel culture\u2019s alive and well.\u201d CNN\u2019s Eva Roytburg contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/08/us/nitrogen-hypoxia-execution-adoption-legislation/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/09/2024", "section": "us"}}

Bragg\u2019s office has resisted calls to testify before Congress citing the ongoing case against the former president, but in a letter Friday to GOP Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, Bragg stated his willingness to testify at a future date. The letter from Bragg\u2019s general counsel said the Manhattan DA\u2019s office is willing to engage with the committee to decide a date for the testimony as well as to\u00a0\u201cbetter\u00a0understand the scope and the purpose of the proposed hearing.\u201d \u201cThis Office is committed to voluntary cooperation. That cooperation includes making the District Attorney available to provide testimony on behalf of the Office at an agreed-upon date, and evaluating the propriety of allowing an Assistant District Attorney to testify publicly about an active prosecution to which he is assigned,\u201d the letter reads. A Manhattan jury found Trump guilty on\u00a034 felony charges\u00a0of falsifying business records on May 30. Bragg, a Democrat, presented the first indictment of a former US president when he announced charges against Trump last year. Bragg accused Trump of falsifying the repayment of his former lawyer Michael Cohen in order to cover up a $130,000 payment Cohen made to adult film star Stormy Daniels to keep her from speaking out about an alleged affair with Trump before the 2016 election. Jordan then demanded Bragg and prosecutor Matthew Colangelo appear for a\u00a0hearing on June 13\u00a0after Trump\u2019s guilty verdict was reached. CNN has reached out to the DA\u2019s office as well as Jordan\u2019s office for additional information. Bragg\u2019s willingness to testify is the latest action in a series of attempts by House Republicans to try to defend Trump amid his legal troubles by going after those involved in his cases. Jordan, along with House Oversight Chairman James Comer and House Administration Chairman Bryan Steil,\u00a0sent a letter\u00a0calling for Bragg\u2019s testimony last year ahead of the trial and criticized Bragg\u2019s investigation into the former president as an\u00a0\u201cunprecedented\u00a0abuse of prosecutorial authority.\u201d Along with Bragg, Jordan has previously looked to investigate other members in the Manhattan District Attorney\u2019s office, as key allies of Trump attempted to frame his criminal charges as politically motivated. Jordan\u00a0subpoenaed\u00a0former New York County Special Assistant District Attorney Mark Pomerantz last year for his role investigating Trump and his business empire and sought\u00a0voluntary cooperation\u00a0from Colangelo. Similarly, Republicans have questioned Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis on whether she used federal funding in her state-level investigation into efforts to overturn the 2020 election results in Georgia.

{"id": "2024_06_08_politics_teddy-roosevelt-president-what-matters", "text": "Theodore Roosevelt carefully crafted his image of rugged manliness. The wealthy heir became a Badlands cowboy and a volunteer Rough Rider and war hero. A populist and a reformer as president, Roosevelt enjoyed incredible popularity during his lifetime \u2013 and he nearly remade the American political system when, frustrated by the direction of the Republican Party after his presidency, he splintered off as a third-party candidate and nearly won election as a Progressive \u201cBull Moose\u201d in 1912. But that image is not complete, according to \u201cThe Loves of Theodore Roosevelt: The Women Who Created a President,\u201d a new biography by Edward O\u2019Keefe, CEO of the Theodore Roosevelt Presidential Library Foundation, which is constructing a new Roosevelt library in the Badlands of North Dakota. O\u2019Keefe is also a former colleague at CNN. The book argues that the women in Roosevelt\u2019s life do not get the historical attention they deserve, something O\u2019Keefe proves with detailed research and engaging writing. I talked to O\u2019Keefe about the book and how Roosevelt and his definition of masculinity relate to today. Our conversation by phone, edited for length, is below: Notoriously masculine, but the product of unsung women WOLF: Your book is about the women behind the most notoriously masculine president. What were you trying to do here?  O\u2019KEEFE: \u201cThe Loves of Theodore Roosevelt\u201d argues that the most masculine president in the American memory is actually the product of unsung and extraordinary women. Theodore Roosevelt is chiseled in marble on Mount Rushmore, and the myth is that everything he did in his incredibly successful personal and political life was the product of his own will. That is true, but it also isn\u2019t the full story. His two sisters, Bamie (Anna) and Conie (Corinne); his two wives, Alice and Edith; and his mother Mittie (Martha) were an integral part of his success, and their stories have been almost entirely lost to history. Frequently absent at times of emotional difficulty WOLF: That theme shines through \u2014 that these women propped up this most famous of American men. But much of his life is built around leaving them. He was not there when his first wife gave birth. He left his second wife, who was critically ill, to go off with the Rough Riders. He\u2019s on safari. He\u2019s in the Badlands. He\u2019s very absent. How do you reconcile that fact with the larger theme of the book? O\u2019KEEFE: I\u2019m so glad you noticed that. I had this fascinating conversation with Connie Roosevelt, who is the wife of Theodore Roosevelt IV (Teddy\u2019s great-grandson). The first time I met her in 2019, we were at a fundraiser for the National Parks Conservation Association, and I had just started to work on the research for what would become \u201cThe Loves of Theodore Roosevelt.\u201d And I said to Connie almost exactly as you\u2019re saying, that there is this pattern that Theodore Roosevelt is absent. He leaves in a lot of emotionally difficult circumstances. And she chuckled and said, \u201cWhen the going gets tough, the tough go hunting,\u201d which is a line that I do use in the book. Theodore Roosevelt, who is known for willing himself through physical pain \u2014 that resilience of a cowboy and a rancher would really wilt when it came to emotionally difficult circumstances. He basically abandoned his daughter for the better part of three years, offered to give his daughter to his sister and have Bamie, his elder sister, raise her. He later said of his exploits in Cuba that he would have left his wife\u2019s deathbed to be there, and that\u2019s not an exaggerated statement. I think that the women in his life understood that they needed to be the support system, especially emotionally, that he didn\u2019t always have the capacity to have. I think if there\u2019s one surprising thing in \u201cThe Loves of Theodore Roosevelt,\u201d in addition to the argument that TR is actually the product of women, it\u2019s that he\u2019s an incredibly emotional person, as much as he\u2019s caricatured in history. I love Robin Williams and the depiction in \u201cNight at the Museum,\u201d but that\u2019s a cartoon of Theodore Roosevelt. It\u2019s easy to caricature him with the big smile and teeth and the hat and the cowboy, but he\u2019s a very sensitive, emotional person who feels very deeply. I think it\u2019s what allowed him to empathize with people. It\u2019s what allowed him to connect with people. That\u2019s all, by the way, a direct result of the influence of his mother, Mittie, who\u2019s been completely written off in history. How a wealthy person became a populist leader WOLF: The gender inequality of the day is a major takeaway from this book. But also the general inequality. Roosevelt was born into fabulous wealth. These are people that take monthslong trips to Europe when he\u2019s a child. He is never not wealthy. But then he escapes that perception to become this populist leader. When inequality is such a big issue today, how do you view his rise from that perspective? O\u2019KEEFE: Theodore Roosevelt is not a Horatio Alger story. He does not rise from humble beginnings to find his way to the upper echelons of power and wealth in America. Interestingly, the expectation in the Victorian and Gilded Age was that those with the greatest amount in society owed very little back to the people. Theodore Roosevelt, like his distant cousin Franklin Roosevelt, was considered a traitor to his class. It was very unusual for someone of his status and wealth to run for office. Politics was seen as a dirty business, something that the middle and lower classes, that the immigrant class would be interested in, because why would you need the power of the vote? You have wealth. You have influence. I think some of that is due to the influence of his parents, Mittie and Thee (Theodore Sr.), a Southerner and a Northerner, who were able to disagree without being disagreeable over one of the most contentious issues in American memory, the Civil War. He saw them come together as a family and be interested in the unity of their family as well as the country. He did have a noblesse oblige. He did feel that to whom much is given, much is required. And I think that experience out in the Badlands of North Dakota \u2014 where it didn\u2019t matter if you were wealthy; you were expected to work equally with the person alongside you. A horse in a roundup doesn\u2019t much care if you\u2019re from the East Side of Manhattan \u2014 you\u2019re either gonna survive and do the work or you\u2019re not gonna make it. Connecting Roosevelt to Biden WOLF: The most gripping part of the book is your description of the circumstances around his first wife dying in childbirth and his mother dying in the same house on the same day. I was trying to quantify that level of tragedy, and the first thing that popped to my mind was the current president, Joe Biden, who lost his wife and his daughter just after he was first elected to the Senate. I wonder if you also made that connection. O\u2019KEEFE: Absolutely. Loss which no one ever hopes to experience is often the crucible of an individual\u2019s life. In Theodore\u2019s circumstance, it was his mother, Mittie, after his father\u2019s death, that said, we need to live for the living, not for the dead \u2014 that you would dishonor the memory of those who are gone if you did not live a life of purpose. I think that\u2019s very similar to President Biden\u2019s circumstances, absolutely. You know, he took the seat in the Senate that then, of course, he held for 36 years, in part because it would be a dishonor to the memory of his wife and daughter if he didn\u2019t. Loss and happenstance, fate and serendipity play such an incredible role in American history. You have to look at these moments, these crucible moments, as the turning points of not just these individual political lives but how they intertwine with the fate of the nation. A new focus on 21st-century masculinity WOLF: There\u2019s been a rise recently, particularly on the American political right, of men trying to reassert masculinity. Josh Hawley, the Missouri senator who wrote a book about Roosevelt, more recently has a book called \u201cManhood,\u201d for instance. What do you think Roosevelt would make of that trend? O\u2019KEEFE: It\u2019s exactly what he was experiencing at his time. When Roosevelt was born in 1858, there\u2019s no electricity, there\u2019s no cars, there\u2019s no airplanes, there\u2019s no submarines. He will be the first president to go up on an airplane, to ride a car, to travel abroad while president, to go in a submarine. Everything changes, right? The society is shifting from agrarian to industrial. The technology that is coming in this age is disrupting how people feel about their sense of self and connection and community. There\u2019s an immigration wave in the country that, in the view of many, is changing what the definition of what an American is, and there\u2019s a fierce debate about whether we\u2019re an isolationist country, or we\u2019re going to be a global power. Does any of this sound familiar? This all intersects with masculinity and gender roles, right? There are constant themes of masculinity. How to be a man. What does it mean to be a man. What do you have to physically do in order to show that you\u2019re a man. He\u2019ll project the quintessential ideal of manhood in society\u2019s expectations at the turn of the 20th century. But what I\u2019m showing in \u201cThe Loves of Theodore Roosevelt\u201d is that he too had this incredible emotional, soft side \u2014 that it was women, who were constrained by the age, working with him to achieve his goals. To your question about what is happening now, people trying to understand gender roles, masculinity, manhood \u2014 instead of looking at it as a continuum, trying to sort of define it as one or the other, to me, it sounds very much like something I\u2019ve heard before, if you pay attention to history. The duality of Roosevelt in the killing of a dog WOLF: There\u2019s a moment in the book when Roosevelt has just had a falling-out with Edith, his childhood sweetheart, who would later become his second wife. He\u2019s riding his horse home and, in a moment of pique, shoots a neighbor\u2019s dog. As I was reading that passage, I immediately thought of South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, who has faced serious backlash for writing in her memoir about shooting a family dog who was unruly. Obviously, the 19th century was a different time, but I wondered if you thought of Roosevelt when you read about Noem, a Dakota lawmaker. Is she not just living \u201cthe strenuous life?\u201d O\u2019KEEFE: There\u2019s a stark difference between a family pet, as described by the governor of South Dakota, and an animal running in the Oyster Bay woods (in New York) that was owned by a neighbor. But this is the duality of Theodore Roosevelt. If you go out to Sagamore Hill (Roosevelt\u2019s home), to this day, one of the most touching parts is the pet cemetery, where they\u2019ve got the graves of all the different, many beloved animals that they had. The Roosevelts had a menagerie, a veritable zoo at the White House \u2014 Josiah the badger and Emily Spinach, the snake whom Alice (his daughter, who was named for her mother) named because she didn\u2019t like her aunt, Emily, and she didn\u2019t like spinach, so her snake must be Emily Spinach; Algonquin, the pony who was taken up to the second floor of the White House. They had so many dogs in their home, both in Sagamore and in the White House, that the pet cemetery is filled with the names of these beloved family pets. So it\u2019s incongruous with Theodore Roosevelt\u2019s attitude about pets and animals, but yes, it is true that after he broke up with Edith, he was so angry that he did indeed shoot a dog on a horseback ride through the woods around Oyster Bay. An unusual parallel, perhaps, to today\u2019s stories.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/08/politics/teddy-roosevelt-president-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/09/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2023_07_20_us_gilgo-beach-killings-supect-rex-heuermann-wife-asa-ellerup", "text": "In her more than 27 years of marriage to Rex Heuermann, Asa Ellerup likely did not know about the gruesome double life her husband is accused of living, Suffolk County\u2019s top cop says. \u201cIf you ask me, I don\u2019t believe, that they knew about this double life that Mr. Heuermann was living,\u201d Suffolk County Police Commissioner Rodney Harrison said of the suspect\u2019s family. But authorities were not ruling anything out yet and were continuing to collect information \u201cto see if the family might have known exactly what Mr. Heuermann was up to,\u201d Harrison told CNN\u2019s Erica Hill in a July 2023 interview.  That month, Heuermann was arrested and charged with murder in connection to the killings of three of the \u201cGilgo Four,\u201d a group of four women whose remains were found along a short stretch of Long Island\u2019s Gilgo Beach in 2010. He also was identified as the prime suspect in the disappearance and killing of the fourth woman, Maureen Brainard-Barnes, who was 25 years old when she was last seen. He was charged with her murder in January and pleaded not guilty.  Heuermann, 60, was indicted on two new murder charges Thursday: second-degree murder in the 2003 death of Jessica Taylor and the 1993 death of Sandra Costilla, according to a bail application. Taylor\u2019s remains were discovered in Manorville in 2003 and then additional remains along Ocean Parkway on Gilgo Beach in 2011. Costilla\u2019s remains were found in North Sea in 1993 by two hunters who were in the woods, according to the bail application. He pleaded not guilty to the charges. Less than a week after her husband\u2019s arrest, Ellerup filed for divorce, her attorney Robert Macedonio told CNN. He did not comment further on the matter. She was shocked to hear what her husband is accused of, Harrison said. But she unknowingly played a key role in her husband\u2019s arrest: it was her DNA, among other evidence, that authorities say helped tie Heuermann to the crimes.  Here\u2019s what we know about his wife, their life together and the unexpected role she played in the case. The two have been married for 27 years  Heuermann and Ellerup were married in April 1996, the suspect said in a 2018 deposition. Since then, they lived in Heuermann\u2019s red and green childhood home in the Long Island suburb of Massapequa Park with their daughter and Heuermann\u2019s stepson.  But despite their long stint in the neighborhood \u2013 and though Heuermann\u2019s life was long rooted in the same community, neighbors knew little detail about the family.  Neighbors described the home as creepy and the family as distant, according to the Long Island Press, a monthly magazine serving Long Island.  \u201cThe family is very to themselves, quiet,\u201d neighbor Frankie Musto told the publication. \u201cWe never saw anything suspicious.\u201d In his 2018 deposition, Heuermann said he had been married once before. That marriage, he said, lasted three years and they had no children.   Wife\u2019s hair found with all three victims When the victims were first discovered, there were pieces of degraded hair recovered by authorities \u2013 but DNA testing at the time could not provide the answers investigators hoped for.  Technological improvements soon helped yield results.  Hair that is now believed to belong to Ellerup \u2013 which presumably had been unintentionally carried by the suspect on his clothes \u2013 was found on or near the three victims, prosecutors alleged in the bail application, citing DNA testing.  That DNA came from 11 bottles inside a garbage can outside the Heuermann home, the court document says. Authorities had been surveilling Heuermann and his family for months after they identified him as a suspect in early 2022, and during that time collected DNA samples from items the family threw away.  Though her hair was found with the victims, Ellerup and their daughter were both traveling when the killings were committed and Heuermann was \u201calone in the tri-state area,\u201d Suffolk County District Attorney Ray Tierney said at a news conference last summer.  \u201cIt\u2019s very significant in as much as it then limits it down to him,\u201d criminal defense attorney Joey Jackson told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper about the finding. \u201cIf the suspect\u2019s wife is out of town, then why would her hair be there if he\u2019s in town?\u201d  Suffolk County authorities say DNA evidence also linked Heuermann to a male hair found on the burlap sack where one victim\u2019s remains were found. Shocked, disgusted, embarrassed Harrison told CNN last summer he was informed that once authorities told Ellerup and her daughter about the crimes Heuermann is accused of, the two were \u201cshocked, they were disgusted, they were embarrassed.\u201d Their reaction, he said, is why he believes they were not aware of what he was doing.  \u201cBut, time will tell,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd once again, there are still a lot more questions that need to be done to the family and friends.\u201d CNN has made multiple attempts to contact Heuermann\u2019s wife and daughter. The attorneys representing Ellerup said last July she and her family \u201care going through a devastating time in their lives\u201d and are asking for privacy. \u201cThe sensitive nature of her husband\u2019s arrest is taking an emotional toll on the immediate and extended family, especially their elderly family members,\u201d said a statement from the Macedonio & Duncan law firm.  \u201cMs. Ellerup does not wish to comment further and has requested the public and press to please respect the family\u2019s privacy at this time.\u201d Following his arrest, Heuermann was remanded without bail. He entered a not guilty plea through his attorney.

{"id": "2024_06_07_business_senators-unitedhealth-patient-data-hack", "text": "A bipartisan pair of senators is accusing a major health care firm that suffered a crippling cyberattack in February of not complying with federal law that requires patients be notified when their data is stolen. In a letter sent to\u00a0UnitedHealth Group CEO Andrew Witty this week, New Hampshire Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan and Tennessee Republican Sen. Marsha Blackburn demanded that the health care giant \u201cassume full and immediate responsibility\u201d for giving patients and health providers information on the breach. Federal law known as the\u00a0Health Information Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) generally requires health care providers to notify people within 60 days of discovering a breach affecting their personal health data. The Department of Health and Human Services is already investigating whether UnitedHealth is compliant with HIPAA obligations to protect patient data. The department can\u2019t discuss ongoing investigations, an HHS spokesperson told CNN. HHS can use HIPAA to fine companies for failing to protect patient data. The department announced a $4.75 million settlement in February with a nonprofit hospital system in New York for \u201cdata security failures\u201d that the department said resulted in an employee stealing and selling patient data. But the cleanup from the ransomware attack on Change Healthcare, a UnitedHealth subsidiary, has been unusually messy and complicated compared to other ransomware attacks on the health sector. The hack paralyzed computers that Change Healthcare uses to process medical claims across the country. Health care providers were cut off from billions of dollars in payments, according to one hospital association, and some health clinics\u00a0were on the brink of bankruptcy\u00a0because they couldn\u2019t get paid. Witty told Congress last month that a third of Americans may have had their personal data stolen in the hack and that it would likely take \u201cseveral months\u201d before the company is able to identify and notify Americans who were affected. One reason for the lengthy notification process, he said, was that files on patients were compromised in the ransomware attack. In the aftermath of the hack, some health care providers were confused whether they or Change Healthcare were responsible for notifying patients that their data had been breached. On May 31, the HHS Office for Civil Rights clarified that health care providers can delegate that obligation to Change Healthcare. \u201cWe appreciate OCR\u2019s recent clarification that providers and other HIPAA covered entities can delegate their notice obligations to Change, which reiterated our previously stated preference to ease the reporting obligations of our customers,\u201d UnitedHealth spokesperson Eric Hausman\u00a0said in an emailed statement to CNN on Friday. \u201cAs a result, we are working with our customers to ensure the notification process meets their needs and satisfies legal obligations.\u201d The hack cast a spotlight on UnitedHealth\u2019s powerful role in the health care market. The company reported $371 billion in revenue last year. Change Healthcare handles one in three American patient records,\u00a0according\u00a0to the American Hospital Association. Optum, another UnitedHealth subsidiary, employs about 90,000 physicians. The UnitedHealth subsidiary hack, and\u00a0another\u00a0ransomware attack on one of the country\u2019s biggest hospital chains, has also increased pressure on Capitol Hill and in the White House to produce new regulations that require health care companies meet minimum cybersecurity standards. The Hassan-Blackburn letter is not the only inquiry that UnitedHealth faces in the Senate. Sen. Ron Wyden, the Oregon Democrat who chairs the finance committee, has called on the Federal Trade Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission to investigate UnitedHealth\u2019s cybersecurity practices. The FTC declined to comment, while an SEC spokesperson told CNN that the agency would respond directly to Wyden.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/07/business/senators-unitedhealth-patient-data-hack/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/09/2024", "section": "us"}}

Scheffler was arrested for allegedly refusing to stop while on his way to a golf tournament and dragging a police officer, according to an internal investigation released by the department Friday. According to the documents, Detectives Bryan Gillis, Kelvin Watkins and Officer Javar Downs did not turn on their bodycam, which is a violation of police procedures. Scheffler, 27, was attempting to drive to the Valhalla Golf Club in Louisville, Kentucky for a tournament when he came to the scene of a fatal crash around 6 a.m., CNN previously reported. He allegedly injured a police officer who was directing traffic and was then detained and arrested. According to a statement given to police, Gillis said while directing traffic, he observed a vehicle traveling in the opposing lanes toward him. \u201cI  stopped the driver and advised him he could not proceed because of the  bus. He demanded to be let in, proceeded forward against my directions. I  was dragged/knocked down by the driver,\u201d the statement said. \u201cI then  proceeded to arrest the driver.\u201d According to the police\u2019s internal investigation, no other police department members witnessed the initial incident, due to a shuttle bus blocking their view. All charges against Scheffler were dismissed less than two weeks after his arrest, CNN previously reported. According to Gillis\u2019 statement, he never powered up his body cam because when he arrived on the scene, he \u201cimmediately started directing traffic.\u201d \u201cDetective Gillis should have had his issued BWC powered on and at least in standby mode,\u201d the Body-Worn Camera Failure to Record Form stated. It later added, \u201che failed to comply with powering it on.\u201d Detective Watkins said in a statement he \u201cdid not catch\u201d the initial confrontation with Gillis and Scheffler. \u201cMy  bodycam was activated after I realized that this was a potential  problem,\u201d he said in the statement. \u201cMy view was blocked by a bus,\u201d he  said. Officer Downs also failed to activate his bodycam because he said he was \u201ctasked with alleviating traffic,\u201d the document said. According  to the documents, Gillis was counseled by a member of his command on  May 22, and a performance observation was completed. In addition to being documented for failing to turn on his bodycam, Gillis was also cited for reaching into a vehicle while it was running. \u201cNot a violation of policy, but tactically poor decision making by Det. Gillis regarding reaching into a vehicle that is running, is in drive, and the operator has the ability to pull away/accelerate,\u201d the summary said. \u201cWhether Gillis grabbed Mr. Scheffler\u2019s arm, or Mr. Scheffler pinned Gillis\u2019s arm with his knee is immaterial had Gillis not crossed the plain into the vehicle\u2019s passenger compartment.\u201d The summary said \u201cthe charges at the time\u201d were only traffic offenses and Gillis \u201chas been verbally counseled regarding risk versus reward in response to this incident.\u201d The investigation findings did support Gillis\u2019s actions by saying \u201cEvery other driver did as directed throughout the abnormal operations outside Valhalla.\u201d This story has been updated with additional details.

The massive aquatic species was found north of Seaside in northwestern Oregon along Gearhart Beach on June 3. A buzz on social media led to curious people \u201cflocking to the beach to see this unusual fish\u201d, according to the aquarium. In photos shared by the aquarium, the giant odd-looking fish shaped like a bloated silver dollar appeared to be lying on its side in the sand with its mouth open. The fish was initially believed only to occupy the Southern Hemisphere\u2019s temperate waters, but \u201cthat theory would be challenged as a few have recently washed ashore in California and one as far north as Alaska,\u201d according to Seaside Aquarium. The aquarium said the news of the fish reached New Zealand-based researcher Mariann Nyegaard, who said images indicated this was not just any typical ocean, or Mola mola, sunfish. Nyegaard recognized the species that washed up on Oregon\u2019s coast as the hoodwinker sunfish, or Mola tecta. The researcher previously discovered the new sunfish species through her research and described the unique finding in a 2017 published paper. \u201cThis fish, hiding in plain sight, has most likely been seen/washed ashore in the Pacific Northwest before but was mistaken for the more common Mola mola,\u201d according to the aquarium.

{"id": "2024_06_07_us_southern-baptists-women-pastors", "text": "From its towering white steeple and red-brick facade to its Sunday services filled with rousing gospel hymns and evangelistic sermons, First Baptist Church of Alexandria, Virginia, bears many of the classic hallmarks of a\u00a0Southern Baptist church. On a recent Sunday, its pastor for women and children, Kim Eskridge, urged members to invite friends and neighbors to an upcoming vacation Bible school \u2014 a perennial Baptist activity \u2014 to help \u201creach families in the community with the gospel.\u201d But because that\u00a0pastor is a woman, First Baptist\u2019s days in the Southern Baptist Convention may be numbered. At the SBC\u2019s annual meeting June 11-12 in Indianapolis, representatives will vote on whether to amend the denomination\u2019s constitution to essentially ban churches with any women pastors \u2014 and not just in the top job. That measure received overwhelming approval in a preliminary vote last year. Leaders of First Baptist \u2013 which has given millions of dollars to Southern Baptist causes and has been involved with the convention since its 19th century founding \u2014 are bracing for a possible expulsion. \u201cWe are grieved at the direction the SBC has taken,\u201d the church said in a statement. And it\u2019s not alone. By some estimates, the proposed ban could affect hundreds of congregations and have a disproportionate impact on predominantly Black churches. The vote is partly the culmination of events set in motion two years ago. That\u2019s when a Virginia pastor contacted SBC officials to contend that First Baptist and four nearby churches were \u201cout of step\u201d with denominational doctrine that says only men can be pastors. The SBC Credentials Committee launched a formal inquiry in April. Southern Baptists disagree on which ministry jobs this doctrine refers to. Some say it\u2019s just the senior pastor, others that a pastor is anyone who preaches and exercises spiritual authority. And in a Baptist tradition that prizes local church autonomy, critics say the convention shouldn\u2019t enshrine a constitutional rule based on one interpretation of its non-binding doctrinal statement. By some estimates, women are working in pastoral roles in hundreds of SBC-linked churches, a fraction of the nearly 47,000 across the denomination. But critics say the amendment would amount to a further narrowing in numbers and mindset for the nation\u2019s largest Protestant denomination, which has moved steadily rightward in recent decades. They also wonder if the SBC has better things to do. It has struggled to respond to sexual abuse cases in its churches. A former professor at a Southern Baptist seminary in Texas was indicted in May on a charge of falsifying a record about alleged sexual abuse by a student in order to obstruct a\u00a0federal investigation\u00a0into sexual misconduct in the convention. SBC membership has dipped below 13 million, nearly a half-century low. Baptismal rates are in long-term decline. The amendment, if passed, wouldn\u2019t prompt an immediate purge. But it could keep the denomination\u2019s leaders busy for years, investigating and ousting churches. Many predominantly Black churches have men as lead pastors but assign pastor titles to women in other areas, such as worship and children\u2019s ministries. \u201cTo disfellowship like-minded churches \u2026 based on a local-church governance decision dishonors the spirit of cooperation and the guiding tenets of our denomination,\u201d wrote Pastor Gregory Perkins, president of the SBC\u2019s National African American Fellowship, to denominational officials. The controversy complicates the\u00a0already-choppy efforts\u00a0by the mostly white denomination to diversify and overcome its legacy of slavery and segregation. Amendment proponents say the convention needs to reinforce its doctrinal statement, the Baptist Faith and Message, which says the office of pastor is \u201climited to men as qualified by Scripture.\u201d \u201cIf we won\u2019t stand on this issue and be unapologetically biblical, then we won\u2019t stand on anything,\u201d said amendment proponent Mike Law, pastor of Arlington Baptist Church in Virginia. Since Baptist churches are independent, the convention can\u2019t tell them what to do or whom to appoint as a pastor. But the convention can decide which churches are in and which are out. And even without a formal amendment, its Executive Committee has begun telling churches with women pastors that\u00a0they\u2019re out. That included one of its largest, Saddleback Church of California. When Saddleback and a\u00a0small Kentucky church\u00a0appealed to the\u00a0annual meeting in 2023,\u00a0delegates overwhelmingly refused to take them back. The amendment would give such enforcement actions more teeth. Some churches with women pastors quit on their own in the past year. They range from Elevation Church, a North Carolina megachurch, to First Baptist of Richmond, Virginia, which had close SBC ties from the convention\u2019s founding. Law contended the issue has been a \u201ccanary in the coalmine\u201d for liberal denominations, several of which began ordaining women and later LGBTQ+ people. \u201cSouthern Baptists are facing a decisive moment,\u201d he said in a video on a pro-amendment website. \u201cHere\u2019s the trajectory of doing nothing: Soon Southern Baptist churches will start openly supporting homosexual clergy, same-sex marriage and eventually transgenderism.\u201d Others point out that Pentecostal and other denominations have had women pastors for generations and remain theologically conservative. Some SBC churches with women pastors are heavily involved with the convention, while others have minimal connections and identify more closely with historically Black or other progressive denominations. Also, some SBC churches interpret the 2000 faith statement as only applying to senior pastors. As long as a the church leader is male, women can serve other pastoral roles, they say. Such churches may leave if SBC leaders interfere with congregations following \u201ctheir conscience, biblical convictions, and values by recognizing women can receive a pastoral gift from God in partnership with male leadership,\u201d said Dwight McKissic, a pastor from Arlington, Texas, on the social media platform X. Other churches say women can be in any role, including senior pastor, and churches can agree to disagree if they embrace most of the SBC faith statement. That category includes First Baptist of Alexandria. Though its current senior pastor is male, it recognizes \u201cGod\u2019s calling to ordain any qualified individual, male or female, for pastoral ministry,\u201d the church said in a statement. First Baptist leaders declined interview requests, but it has posted extensively about the issue on its website. It said while it plans to send representatives to the SBC annual meeting, it was warned to expect a motion to deny them voting privileges. \u201cI do believe we need to be heard and represented,\u201d Senior Pastor Robert Stephens told members in a video-recorded meeting. The SBC\u2019s top administrative body opposes the amendment. Investigating churches\u2019 compliance would consume an unsustainable amount of time and energy over something that shouldn\u2019t be a litmus test for fellowship, wrote Jeff Iorg, president of the SBC Executive Committee, in a Baptist Press commentary. Baptist Women in Ministry, which began within the SBC in the 1980s but now works in multiple Baptist denominations, has taken note. The Rev.

The first half was all Celtics, led by center Kristaps Porzingis, scoring 18 points in the half off the bench. The 28-year-old missed Boston\u2019s last 10 playoff games after straining his left calf in Game 4 of the team\u2019s opening-round series against the Miami Heat. The Mavericks trailed by 29 heading into halftime but cut the deficit to single digits in the second half behind Luka Doncic. The Slovenian star came out of the gates scorching, scoring 10 points in the third quarter. However, the Celtics regained control, going on an 8-0 run to extend the lead back to double digits and continued to hold off the Mavericks for the rest of the game. Celtics forward Jaylen Brown led the team with 22 points, while Porzingis finished with 20 points and six rebounds in 21 minutes played. Doncic scored a game-high 30 points. Boston star forward Jayson Tatum, who had 16 points in the win, wasn\u2019t thrilled with his performance but credited the team for the win. \u201cI had way too many turnovers,\u201d Tatum told the ABC broadcast after the game. \u201cI got to be a lot better but we took care of the job tonight.

{"id": "2024_06_08_business_renting-electric-vehicle-rental-cars", "text": "Lydia Wu had never driven an electric vehicle before she rented a car from Avis last February. An electric Genesis GV60 was all they had available at a location in Kansas City, Kansas. Wu received no specific instructions on how to use the vehicle, or how to find chargers, but she appreciated the SUV\u2019s ornate and elegant interior. \u201cIf it was a gas vehicle, I would totally consider it as my next car,\u201d she said. But she is out of the market for an EV. I, on the other hand, have had a lot of experience with EVs. So when I recently rented a Polestar 2 from Hertz in San Diego and received no instructions it was no problem. But I could imagine a first-time EV driver wondering, \u201cHow do I turn this thing on?\u201d Many would be flummoxed by a car with no \u201cStart\u201d button, for instance. In a Polestar, you get in and it\u2019s on. You get out and it turns off. A lot of drivers may be baffled by that alone. While sales growth has slowed, EVs make up about 7% of overall car sales, according to Cox Automotive. Rental car companies may have overestimated their customers\u2019 readiness for a switch, though. Hertz made a bold move in 2021, saying it would order 65,000 EVs from Polestar, 100,000 from Tesla and another 175,000 from General Motors. At the time, Hertz said that EVs might represent 25% of its fleet by 2024. But in January Hertz said it would sell 20,000 Tesla models, or one-third of its fleet, to buy gas-powered cars. The company\u2019s CEO at the time, Stephen Scherr, said, \u201cCollision and damage repairs on an EV can often run about twice that associated with a comparable combustion engine vehicle.\u201d Scant driver\u2019s ed In general, big rental car companies, with huge fleets to manage and lots of customers to put into cars, don\u2019t have time to give individual instruction to rookie EV drivers. And it\u2019s not a seamless transition from a gas-powered vehicle to an EV. Experienced as I am, I was still taken by surprise as I approached a stop light in the Polestar and the car slowed abruptly as soon as I lifted off the accelerator. Oh, right\u2026it\u2019s called \u201cautomatic regenerative braking.\u201d The Polestar was using its electric motor to slow the car while sending power back to the battery. That\u2019s a good thing, but, again, I could just imagine a new renter panicking and thinking, \u201cIs something wrong?\u201d Hertz said in an email that it provides a QR code that links to a website with information about how to charge and even how to drive individual models like the Polestar 2. If that link was provided during my rental, then I must have missed it. I went to the website and watched the videos and, yes, the instructions would have been helpful. But, let\u2019s face it, how many people who rent cars take the time to read the paperwork, let alone go to a website to review instructions? Beyond that, both Hertz and Avis declined to comment for this story. Doug Jensen, similarly to Wu, found due to scarcity that he had to rent an EV from a Hertz location in New York City. Given no instruction on how to handle charging, he found himself trying to use Tesla chargers for his Kia rental car, not initially realizing they wouldn\u2019t work. Then he had to struggle with a non-working EV charger at his hotel. Since then, Hertz has respected Jensen\u2019s request to never have an EV again, he said. Hertz also gave him a free rental day and extra loyalty points to make up for his aggravation. Charging as a sticky point It was around around 1 a.m. in February in Kansas City, Kansas, when Wu got her rental GV60 with its batteries charged up to 57%. She had to quickly find a charger since it was cold and, with the heat running, the battery was draining faster than normal. \u201cIt was easy to find chargers but the thing is (the navigation software was) pulling up every single charger available including Tesla Superchargers,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t have EV experience so I had no idea if Tesla Superchargers were going to work with my car.\u201d Wu was ultimately able to find a charger. She said her experience with the EV was good after it had been plugged in. \u201cI could monitor how my car was doing, charge-wise, from my phone, even though it was in the parking lot a few blocks away. So everything was super great,\u201d she said. There are car rental companies that offer customers more hand-holding. In my case, I\u2019ve rented EVs from Turo, a peer-to-peer car rental platform that\u2019s sort of like Airbnb but for cars. Just like with Airbnb, some people have set up small businesses renting their vehicles through Turo and some of them specialize in EVs. When I\u2019ve rented EVs through Turo, a host has always given me a helpful walk-through of the vehicle. The hosts would explain the features, something that was especially helpful when I rented a Tesla Cybertruck, an EV that has plenty of quirks. The Cybertruck had cost more than a $1,000 a day to rent at the time including insurance \u2014 it had just come out \u2014 but EV rental costs are normally more in line with gas cars. Customer service as key Joulez, an EV rental company, rents its fleet through its own website as well as through Turo. Founder Micah Bergdale said he had rented EVs years ago and saw an opportunity to do it better so he started the company in 2021. \u201cThe entire experience that someone has, especially if they\u2019re not familiar with it, is very different than a traditional gas car,\u201d he said. On the Joulez website, customers are asked if they have ever driven an EV and if they have any experience with the specific model they\u2019re about to rent. If not, an on-site attendant can provide an overview. Also, Joulez has a customer service line if they have issues with things like charging. Of course, a company like Joulez can provide that kind of attention because it only has locations in four US cities and its fleet consists of about 150 vehicles. Bigger rental companies, on the other hand, manage hundreds of thousands of cars in locations nationwide. And, of course, Joulez and Turo have the advantage of a customer base that knows up front what they\u2019re renting. Their customers select specific vehicles, unlike customers who rent from big rental companies where they might select a general class of vehicle but not find out the make and model until they arrive at the lot. But not everyone has such a bad time when renting an EV from a big rental car company. Jay Waldron, a Georgia resident, rented a Hyundai Kona EV from National while on a trip to Washington, DC. He loved how fun it was to drive. \u201cIt was so disappointing going back to my old stick-shift 4 cylinder,\u201d he said in a text message. \u201cSitting in traffic with it, I missed that EV bad.\u201d A few weeks later, Waldron bought himself a Kia EV6.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/08/business/renting-electric-vehicle-rental-cars/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/09/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_08_us_florida-shark-attacks-walton-county", "text": "Three people were injured in two shark attacks within just 90 minutes of each other Friday at neighboring beaches in Walton County, Florida, authorities say. The attacks happened about four miles apart and left two people in critical condition and a third in stable condition, South Walton Fire District Fire Chief Ryan Crawford said in a joint news conference Friday. Two people remained in the hospital in a stable condition on Saturday. Just after 1:15 p.m. on Friday, authorities responded to a report of a woman being injured by a shark in the water near Watersound Way and Coopersmith Lane, according to the\u00a0Walton County Sheriff\u2019s Office. A 45-year-old woman was \u201creportedly swimming just past the first sandbar with her husband\u201d near WaterSound Beach, Crawford said in the news conference. The woman suffered significant trauma to the midsection and pelvic area and her left lower arm was amputated, according to Crawford. She was airlifted to a local trauma facility for treatment. The second attack took place at the Sandy Shores Court area of Seacrest Beach at approximately 2:55 p.m., four miles east of the first incident. Two girls approximately 15 to 17 years old were in waist deep water with a group of friends just inside the first sandbar when the incident occurred, according to the fire district. One of the teenagers had significant injuries to the upper leg and one hand, and the other had minor injuries on one foot, according to the fire district. On Saturday, Beach Safety Director for the South Walton Fire District David Vaughn told CNN that the person who suffered minor injuries had been discharged from hospital. The other two attack victims remained hospitalized in stable condition, he said. Vaughn added that officials do not know for sure if the same shark was behind the separate attacks or what species was involved. \u201cIt would make more sense that with the nature and severity of the injuries, that it was the same large shark,\u201d Vaughn noted. Following the incidents, beach flags were changed to double red Friday to indicate the water was closed for swimming. \u201cDouble red flags are now flying on the beaches in the surrounding area. The Gulf is now closed to the public in Walton County in the localized area of the incident,\u201d the sheriff\u2019s office said in its post at the time. \u201cWe are encouraging beachgoers to be cognizant that lifeguards and beach deputies may be trying to keep people out of the water in the immediate area.\u201d The father of a 17-year-old girl who witnessed the teenagers being attacked from her hotel balcony said his daughter was distraught. \u201cShe felt helpless that she couldn\u2019t help,\u201d Brian Erbesfield said of his daughter Hanna. Video provided by the family shows a shark in breakers meters offshore as beachgoers gather at the water\u2019s edge. \u201cOh my God, Oh my God \u2026 They need to get out,\u201d a voice said. Walton County Sheriff Michael Adkinson said during Friday\u2019s news conference that authorities are speaking with experts to see if there is \u201csomething anomalous.\u201d \u201cWe don\u2019t think there is, but we certainly want to be diligent,\u201d he said. \u201cWe know we share the water with sharks, we understand that as tragic as this is, there are always sharks.\u201d The last two shark incidents in the area were reported in 2021 and 2005, according to the Walton County Sheriff\u2019s Office. During the most recent attack, in June 2021, a 14-year-old boy survived after being bitten in the chest area while swimming near a fishing line 40 yards from the shore in Grayton State Park. Another attack was fatal \u2013 in June 2005, a 14-year-old girl from Louisiana was on a boogie board 250 yards from shore when she was pulled under by the shark and bitten in the legs. While the risk of being bitten by a shark is extremely low, Florida tops global charts for the number of shark bites, according to the Florida Museum of Natural History\u2019s annual shark attack report. In 2023, Florida had 16 unprovoked shark bite incidents reported, which represents 44% of the United States total and 23% worldwide. Volusia County had the most shark bites, and the others were reported in Brevard, St. Lucie, Miami-Dade, Palm Beach, Escambia and Pinellas counties. There were no fatalities reported last year in the state as a result of the attacks.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/08/us/florida-shark-attacks-walton-county/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/09/2024", "section": "us"}}

{"id": "2024_06_06_us_26-people-rescued-and-7-suspects-arrested-in-a-texas-human-smuggling-operation-sheriff-says", "text": "Officials in southern Texas say they have disrupted a human smuggling operation, helping rescue 26 people \u2013 11 of whom are in the hospital \u2013 and taking seven suspects into custody. The 26 people who were rescued endured \u201cmiserable conditions\u201d throughout their journey into the area, Bexar County Sheriff Javier Salazar said in a Thursday afternoon news conference. Though authorities don\u2019t know when or where the group may have crossed the border into the US and how long they have been in the country, officials believe the victims were transported inside a false truck compartment for at least three hours Thursday before they were taken to a house with no air-conditioning, no running water, and where authorities believe buckets were being used for toilets. Investigators also believe the residence was also the site of previous animal fighting, the sheriff said. \u201cIt\u2019s miserable conditions in there and it\u2019s just blazing hot,\u201d Salazar told reporters, standing near the house. \u201cFortunately, we were able to get these people before any of them passed.\u201d The group includes an 18-year-old woman \u2013 who authorities believe is the youngest among the victims \u2013 and a woman from Guatemala who paid roughly $16,000 to make it to that point, Salazar said. Officials don\u2019t yet know the countries of origin of the rest of the group, the sheriff said. Those who were taken to the hospital endured heat-related and other minor medical injuries, the sheriff said. Temperatures in San Antonio, the Bexar County seat, reached up to at least 102 degrees Fahrenheit on Thursday. \u201cWe don\u2019t yet know if these people came over the border this morning or if they were already here in a stash house in another part of the state on this side of the border,\u201d Salazar said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know if they were smuggled across against their will, we just don\u2019t know at this point. \u201cBut again, this is the fault of the blood-thirsty organizations that are bringing these people across and putting them in harm\u2019s way,\u201d he added. Salazar\u2019s news conference comes two days after President Joe Biden announced a new executive action that bars migrants who cross the US-Mexico border illegally from seeking asylum once a daily threshold is met, unless they meet certain exemptions. The measure, which went into effect Wednesday, faced criticism from progressives and others who have said the move is similar to steps taken under former President Donald Trump. How Thursday\u2019s operation in Texas unfolded Bexar County officials first received information Thursday morning that a smuggling operation appeared to be taking place. Authorities discovered the alleged smugglers were transporting the group using a \u201clong gooseneck trailer,\u201d which officials began to surveil, Salazar said. The group of more than two dozen people were lying on a hard mesh inside a \u201clarge false compartment,\u201d exposed to the elements for several hours and without access to water, Salazar said. The vehicles eventually pulled into the house the victims were taken to, according to the sheriff. \u201cThat trailer \u2026 you can be standing right there next to it and not know that that thing contains 26 people,\u201d Salazar said. \u201cSo it drove by thousands of cars, easily.\u201d Salazar said the suspects taken into custody were involved in the human smuggling operation and referred to them as \u201ccoyotes\u201d \u2013 a term commonly used for human smugglers. There may be more arrests as the investigation continues, the sheriff said. Authorities found bulletproof vests and long rifles in a back residence, he added, and said Thursday\u2019s incident appears to be part of a larger operation \u201cthat\u2019s been in existence for some time.\u201d Local and federal agencies, as well as US Customs and Border Protection, are assisting in the case, he added. The sheriff also noted that when authorities first arrived at the house where the group was being held Thursday, some people took off running, but he said he believes everyone is accounted for. \u201cNow it is possible that somebody\u2019s laying up in the brush somewhere that got away. We would tell area residents, keep your doors locked, although we don\u2019t believe there\u2019s anybody at large, it\u2019s always possible, so if you see any suspicious activities, any suspicious persons, give us a call,\u201d he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/06/us/26-people-rescued-and-7-suspects-arrested-in-a-texas-human-smuggling-operation-sheriff-says/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/09/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2023_07_21_us_gilgo-beach-four-killings-victims", "text": "Of the six women Rex Heuermann is accused of killing on Long Island, four of them were discovered bound with belts or tape and wrapped in burlap along a stretch of Gilgo Beach in 2010. A married father accused by authorities of leading a double life, Heuermann initially faced three counts of first-degree murder for the killings of Melissa Barthelemy in 2009, and Megan Waterman and Amber Costello the following year, according to the Suffolk County district attorney.  The 60-year-old New York architect was later charged in the disappearance and killing of a fourth woman, Maureen Brainard-Barnes, whose remains were found near the same spot, prosecutors said earlier this year. He had been identified as a prime suspect in the killing since his arrest in July. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges and is being held without bail.  On Thursday, Heuermann was indicted on two new murder charges to which he pleaded not guilty: second-degree murder in the 2003 death of Jessica Taylor and the 1993 death of Sandra Costilla, according to court documents.  Heuermann in January pleaded not guilty to the superseding indictment charging him with murder in the second degree in the death of Brainard-Barnes.  Heuermann \u201chas maintained his innocence from day one,\u201d his defense attorney said after he was charged in the fourth killing. \u201cHe said, \u2018I\u2019m not guilty of these charges,\u2019\u201d defense attorney Michael Brown said. \u201cHe\u2019s looking forward to fight these charges and we\u2019re doing that. We\u2019re going to continue to prepare.\u201d Heuermann was first identified as a potential suspect in early 2022, shortly after a multi-agency task force was formed to examine cold cases involving nearly a dozen sets of human remains found along Long Island\u2019s South Shore between 2010 and 2011, including the \u201cGilgo Four.\u201d \u201cThe grand jury investigation of the so-called Gilgo Four is over. It has been concluded,\u201d Suffolk County District Attorney Ray Tierney said in January, noting the same panel was looking into other murder cases.  Gloria Allred, a victims\u2019 rights attorney representing Barthelemy, Brainard-Barnes and Waterman family members, said it is \u201clong overdue to provide justice for vulnerable women who are missing and murdered.\u201d Allred said it\u2019s up to a jury \u201cto decide if this defendant will be found guilty of the murder of Maureen and the murder of other women for whom the defendant has been indicted.\u201d Here\u2019s what we know about the deaths of those four women: Maureen Brainard-Barnes    Brainard-Barnes was 25 years old and believed to be a sex worker when she was last seen on July 9, 2007. She had called a friend in Connecticut, where she lived, and said she had an \u201cout call,\u201d according to Suffolk County police. The young woman was reported missing by a friend to the Norwich Police Department in Connecticut on July 14.  Her remains were found on December 13, 2010, on the north side of Ocean Parkway, near Gilgo Beach.  She is believed to be the first Gilgo Four victim. Authorities identified Heuermann as a suspect in early 2022 using cell phone data, witness descriptions and other information, and obtained a sample of his DNA from leftover crust in a pizza box he threw out.  Investigators found the DNA of Heuermann\u2019s wife on a leather belt that was used to restrain Brainard-Barnes, according to an indictment.  She had been restrained by three leather belts, one of which was used to tie her feet and ankle legs together, the indictment states. Heuermann\u2019s wife and her two children were in Atlantic City at the time of the killing of Brainard-Barnes, according to a bail application. Tierney described victim Brainard-Barnes as an \u201cintellectual\u201d and \u201cartistic.\u201d \u201cShe was a devoted sister, a devoted mother, a devoted daughter, and she\u2019s sorely missed by those that loved her,\u201d Tierney said. Brainard-Barnes\u2019s family called the latest indictment \u201can important chapter in the long pursuit of justice.\u201d \u201cIt has been 16 years since the last time I saw my sister, 16 years since I heard her voice, because 16 years ago, she was silenced,\u201d Melissa Cann said in January. Cann described her sister as a loving mother, sister and friend. \u201cMaureen would never get the chance to show the world how talented she was,\u201d her sister said, choking up. \u201cMy family will never get the chance to know who Maureen would be today because her life was tragically taken.\u201d Nicolette Brainard-Barnes was only 7 years old when her mother was killed. She said the loss changed the trajectory of her life. \u201cWhile the loss of my mom has been extremely painful for me, the indictment by the grand jury has brought hope for justice for my mom and my family,\u201d said Nicolette Brainard-Barnes. Cann told CNN in 2011 that she desperately tried to solve the mystery of her sibling\u2019s disappearance, scouring her emails and phone records, and staying in touch with families of the other victims.  Cann said her sister worked a seasonal telemarketing job and turned to escort services in desperation when left unemployed and facing eviction.  Melissa Barthelemy   Barthelemy was 24 years old when she was last seen on July 12, 2009, in the basement apartment where she lived in the Bronx, according to the Suffolk County police website on the Gilgo killings.  On the night she was last seen, Barthelemy, a sex worker, told a friend she was meeting a man and would be back in the morning, according to the police website.  Barthelemy\u2019s mother reported her missing on July 18. Records for her cellphone showed activity in Manhattan as well as Freeport, Massapequa and Lindenhurst on Long Island.   In July and August 2009, according to a bail application for Heuermann, Barthelemy\u2019s phone was used by a man to make taunting calls to the victim\u2019s family.  Steve Cohen, who was an attorney for Barthelemy\u2019s mother at the time, told CNN the caller said he killed her daughter. \u201cDo you think you\u2019ll ever see her again?\u201d the unidentified male caller asked Barthelemy\u2019s sister on August 26, 2009, according to Cohen. \u201cYou won\u2019t. I killed her,\u201d he said and hung up. In another phone call, just days after Barthelemy disappeared, Cohen said the unidentified male caller referred to the victim as a \u201cwhore\u201d in a short conversation with her then-15-year-old sister. In one call, the man described in graphic detail to the victim\u2019s sister what he had done sexually to Barthelemy, according to Cohen.  Barthelemy\u2019s remains were the first set of female remains found in bushes along an isolated strip of waterfront property. At the time, authorities were searching for another missing woman, Shannan Gilbert, a 23-year-old from Jersey City, New Jersey, who hadn\u2019t been seen since May 2010. \u201cI still don\u2019t sleep through the night thinking about all of it,\u201d Lynn Barthelemy, the victim\u2019s mother, told CNN in 2011.  She said she jotted down everything she learned about the case in a notebook and spoke regularly with families of other victims.  Investigators believe Barthelemy was the second of the women to be killed.  Megan Waterman  Waterman was 22 years old when she was last seen on June 6, 2010. A resident of Maine, Waterman was last seen by her family boarding a Concord Trailways bus heading from Maine to New York, according to Suffolk County police.  She was a sex worker, police said. At 1:30 a.m. on June 6, she left the Holiday Inn Express on Long Island to meet a client, according to police.  Waterman was reported missing in Maine on June 8. Family members said it was unusual for her not to check on the daughter Waterman had left in their care.   Her body was found on December 13, 2010, near Gilgo Beach. Waterman\u2019s family at one time used funding from a nonprofit human rights organization to hire a team of private investigators to help search for her.  Dottie Laster, a member of that team, told CNN in 2011 Waterman sounded starstruck when she called her mother to boast that her clients included doctors, lawyers and law enforcement officers.  Amber Lynn Costello  Costello was 27 years old and living on Long Island when she was last seen. She struggled with a heroin addiction and worked as an escort to help support her habit, according to Suffolk County police. She was was last seen leaving her home on September 2, 2010, to meet a client. Her remains were found on December 13, 2010, near Gilgo Beach. She is believed to be the fourth victim.   Witnesses told investigators that the client she met the day she went missing had been at her home previously. They described the man as \u201ca large, white male, approximately 6\u20194\u201d to 6\u20196\u201d in height\u201d with \u201cbig oval style\u201d glasses. A witness also said the man resembled an \u201cogre.\u201d Heuermann\u2019s bail application noted the description from these witnesses in 2010 matched Heuermann. Costello\u2019s sister, Kim Overstreet, told CNN in 2011 that she took out an ad hoping to catch the killer. The ad implored other women who work as escorts to call Overstreet. She wanted them to tell her if they ever encountered a client who was threatening or just didn\u2019t feel right. \u201cWhat happened to Amber eats at me every day,\u201d Overstreet said at the time. \u201cFinding out who did this consumes me. I stay up all night doing research and trying to re-trace her last steps.\u201d Witnesses also said the man drove a first-generation Chevrolet Avalanche \u2013 a key clue that prosecutors said helped lead them to Heuermann.

{"id": "2024_06_07_us_food-fraud-scheme-convicted", "text": "A jury convicted five Minnesota residents but acquitted two others on Friday for their roles in a scheme to steal more than $40 million that was supposed to feed children during the coronavirus pandemic. The case received widespread attention after someone tried to bribe a juror with a bag of $120,000 in cash. That juror was dismissed before deliberations began, and a second juror who was told about the bribe attempt was also dismissed. An FBI investigation of the attempted bribe continues, with no arrests announced. The seven defendants are the first of 70 to stand trial in what federal prosecutors have called one of the nation\u2019s largest COVID-19-related frauds, exploiting rules that were kept lax so that the economy wouldn\u2019t crash during the pandemic. More than $250 million in federal funds was taken in the Minnesota scheme overall, with only about $50 million of it recovered, authorities said. The defendants faced a mix of multiple counts including conspiracy, wire fraud, money laundering and federal programs bribery. It ended with a split verdict. Abdiaziz Shafii Farah, Mohamed Jama Ismail, Abdimajid Mohamed Nur, Mukhtar Mohamed Shariff and Hayat Mohamed Nur were found guilty on most of the counts against them. Said Shafii Farah and Abdiwahab Maalim Aftin were acquitted on all counts they faced. Defense attorneys argued that the defendants provided real meals to real people. An Associated Press analysis published last June documented how thieves across the country plundered billions in federal COVID-19 relief dollars. Fraudsters potentially stole more than $280 billion, while another $123 billion was wasted or misspent. Combined, the loss represented 10% of the $4.3 trillion the government disbursed by last fall. Nearly 3,200 defendants have been charged and about $1.4 billion in stolen pandemic aid has been seized, according to the U.S. Justice Department. The Minnesota case drew attention after the judge and attorneys for both sides learned about the bribe attempt. The judge ordered all seven defendants to surrender their cellphones so that investigators could look for evidence. She also ordered all seven taken into custody, and sequestered the jury. According to an FBI agent\u2019s affidavit, a woman rang the doorbell at the home of \u201cJuror #52\u201d in the Minneapolis suburb of Spring Lake Park the night before the case went to the jury. The juror wasn\u2019t home, but a relative answered the door. The woman handed the relative a gift bag with a curly ribbon and images of flowers and butterflies and said it was a \u201cpresent\u201d for the juror. \u201cThe woman told the relative to tell Juror #52 to say not guilty tomorrow and there would be more of that present tomorrow,\u201d the agent wrote. \u201cAfter the woman left, the relative looked in the gift bag and saw it contained a substantial amount of cash.\u201d The juror called police right after she got home and gave them the bag, which held stacks of $100, $50 and $20 bills totaling around $120,000. The woman who left the bag knew the juror\u2019s first name, the agent said. Names of the jurors have not been made public, but the list of people with access to it included prosecutors, defense lawyers \u2014 and the seven defendants. \u201cIt is highly likely that someone with access to the juror\u2019s personal information was conspiring with, at a minimum, the woman who delivered the $120,000 bribe,\u201d the FBI agent wrote, noting that the alleged fraud conspiracy at the heart of the trial involved electronic communications, including text messages and emails. Federal charges of bribery of a juror and influencing a juror carry a maximum potential penalty of 15 years in prison. The food aid came from the U.S. Department of Agriculture and was administered by the state, which funneled the meal money through nonprofit organizations and other partners. As rules were eased to speed support to the needy, the defendants allegedly produced invoices for meals never served, ran shell companies, laundered money, indulged in passport fraud and accepted kickbacks. Federal prosecutors said just a fraction of the money the defendants received through the Feeding our Future nonprofit went to feed low-income kids, while the rest was spent on luxury cars, jewelry, travel and property. The seven collectively stole more than $40 million, they said. The common thread in the defense arguments was that investigators failed to dig deep enough to see they served real meals to real kids. Eighteen other defendants pleaded guilty. Among those awaiting trial is Aimee Bock, the founder of Feeding our Future. She has maintained her innocence, saying she never stole and saw no evidence of fraud among her subcontractors.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/07/us/food-fraud-scheme-convicted/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/09/2024", "section": "us"}}

Patrice Miller, 71, was found dead in her Downieville home last November, but a recently released autopsy report by California\u2019s Department of Fish and Wildlife has verified she was killed by a bear, the Sierra County Sheriff\u2019s department said. A sheriff\u2019s deputy discovered Miller deceased in her home while conducting a welfare check after a grocery store employee reported that she had not been seen or heard from for several days, according to Sheriff Michael Fisher. The sheriff\u2019s office said when they found Miller, there were clear signs a bear had been inside the house. But officials believed Miller had died of natural causes and the bear broke into the house after her death and had been feeding on her remains. The bear was eventually trapped and euthanized, the sheriff said. However, a recently released autopsy revealed that Miller did not die of natural causes but had in fact been killed by the bear, the sheriff said. \u201cPost investigation, we found out that she had been having some bear issues at the house. And after we concluded our coroner\u2019s investigation and removed her remains from the house, the bear continued to break into the house over and over again over the next several days,\u201d Fisher added. The sheriff said further investigation revealed bears had been prowling around Miller\u2019s house for some time because she would leave cat food on the front porch for her cats and there was garbage around the home as well. Miller\u2019s daughter also told authorities that one particular bear would come to the house quite often and her mother had put bars on the windows to keep the bear away. \u201cIt\u2019s a big deal. That doesn\u2019t happen in California. Normally a bear is going to stay away from you, a bear that hasn\u2019t been normalized to human behavior,\u201d Steve Gonzalez with the fish and wildlife department told CNN affiliate KCRA. Last month, there had been reports of another bear breaking into homes in the mountain community. That bear has also been euthanized, the sheriff said. Fisher said that bears are seen around the area regularly, but usually they\u2019re rummaging through garbage or breaking into cars for food, and flee when they see a human. \u201cWe deal with bears on a weekly basis through spring, summer and fall and 99.9% of those animals are not a public safety (issue). They\u2019re a nuisance, but they\u2019re not a public safety (issue),\u201d the sheriff said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/07/us/california-confirms-woman-killed-last-winter-was-states-first-fatal-black-bear-attack/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/09/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_07_us_death-row-visitors-executions-cec", "text": "On August 9, 2018, Steven Hale stood outside a Tennessee prison as a convicted murderer inside awaited a lethal dose of a three-drug cocktail. It was the first execution of a death row inmate in the state in nearly a decade. Hale was one of seven reporters selected by a grim lottery to witness Billy Ray Irick\u2019s execution at the Riverbend Maximum Security Institution in Nashville. He\u2019d written stories about Irick\u2019s horrific rape and murder of a 7-year-old girl more than three decades earlier. But nothing prepared him for that night in 2018. Not far away, in an area reserved for death penalty supporters, a man blared AC/DC\u2019s \u201cHells Bells\u201d from a loudspeaker. And as a chaperone led Hale and other journalists to the execution chamber, Hale saw another small group of people huddled in a field outside the prison. They were there to show their love for Irick. One man told Hale he had called the prison earlier and pleaded with officials to let him sit in the death chamber so Irick would see a friendly face just before he died. The man sobbed when a prison official said no, Hale says. That night, as Irick took his last breath in the execution chamber, the group held a vigil outside the prison, hoping to claim his body for a memorial. Their stories lingered with Hale long after the execution. He soon became fascinated with the commitment shown by these supporters. They were not relatives of the prisoners, or death row groupies. Nor were they anti-death penalty activists \u2014 at least, not at the beginning. They were strangers united in one mission: visiting, befriending and comforting death row inmates in what might be their final months. \u201cI didn\u2019t know these people existed,\u201d Hale told CNN. \u201cI didn\u2019t know anyone was going out there to just visit people on death row, not as attorneys, not even family members, just as regular folks.\u201d He began to join their weekly trips to Riverbend, where they sat with death row prisoners and talked about everything from football to their families. For Tennesseeans on both sides of the death penalty issue, it was a turbulent time. In a span of less than two years after Irick was put to death, Tennessee held six more executions, a string unlike any other seen in the state since the 1940s. Hale witnessed two of those executions, in addition to Irick\u2019s. He chronicles his experiences in a new book, \u201cDeath Row Welcomes You: Visiting Hours in the Shadow of the Execution Chamber,\u201d which explores the complexities of Tennessee\u2019s capital punishment system and the unique friendships that develop between condemned murderers and the strangers who visit them. The book documents the prisoners\u2019 troubled pasts and examines their perspective after decades in prison, away from the public. \u00a0Hale said he was struck by the normalcy of the conversations he and others had with prisoners during their many visits. \u201cThese gatherings are so ordinary as to be extraordinary and so life-giving as to feel defiant,\u201d Hale writes in the book. He told CNN that during one of his visits, a death row inmate learned he had gone to Auburn University and began needling him. \u201cHe was teasing me about Auburn and saying it was overrated that year \u2026 it almost felt like I could be in a bar somewhere.\u201d \u201cIn that visitation room, everything felt normal,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then when we walked out, and there was a barbed wire and armed guard, you kind of remember, \u2018Oh, yeah, I\u2019m in a maximum-security prison.\u2019 \u201c Hale, 36, is a reporter for the Nashville Banner. CNN talked to him about his personal encounters with death row prisoners and the unique community of visitors \u2014 in the tradition of \u201cDead Man Walking\u201d\u2018s Sister Helen Prejean \u2014 who show them love in their final months. His answers have been edited for length and clarity. How did you go from writing about death row inmates to immersing yourself into their world? I was covering criminal justice in Tennessee and had an interest in the death penalty. But when I moved to Tennessee in 2010, there were no executions going on. It was that way until around 2014, when the state started scheduling some executions. I volunteered to witness one of those executions as a reporter, and was gearing up for that when it got called off because of litigation over lethal injection drugs. And then in 2018, the state scheduled a number of executions after the lethal injection litigation was completed and I started covering those cases. I was trying to interview him (Irick) or any of the men on death row.\u00a0 And here in Tennessee, it\u2019s very difficult to get access to incarcerated people as a as a reporter, particularly on death row. And during that process, I met a couple of people \u2013 just regular civilians \u2013 who went out to the prison to visit death row inmates. I was just so taken by this community. I started feeling like there was a bigger story there. When was your first visit with the death row inmates and what was that like? Not long after the first execution. I visited death row with this community of people and sat in that room with them.\u00a0 I was just so moved by that experience. It was unlike anything I\u2019d ever been around. And that\u2019s when I thought, I think I might have a book to write here. Just because there were all these people coming from different places who were together in this room. And it was so different than I had imagined. What stood out to you about that first visit? The visitors\u2019 wide demographic. There are some young folks who go out there to visit, and then there are some older folks who go there either through a church or community organization. The first night I went out to death row for these visitations, I was sitting there \u2026 and there was an older woman next to me.\u00a0 I can\u2019t say exactly how old she was, but she looked older than my parents. There was an older White woman sitting with a Black man on death row. So the ages and demographics are all kind of mixed up in there, and it was fascinating to see that. The people in this community are really not activists. Maybe they see themselves that way now. But when they got into this, they were not. Why do these people visit death row and attend executions? Many of the visitors I met and wrote about in the book started visiting death row through a church or because another visitor invited them. Their reasons vary. In many cases, I think they see it as an expression of their Christian faith. For others, what started out as a sort of personal journey turned into something else. What do the death row inmates think about their visits?\u00a0 I think the visits are very important to them because of the normal social needs we all have \u2026 these relationships represent an acceptance of who they are today. The courts and the prison and much of society have locked them in as the person they were 30 or 40 years ago, a person who did horrible things. But the friendships they\u2019ve developed with regular visitors aren\u2019t defined by that. How did you reconcile death row inmates\u2019 crimes with who they are now?\u00a0 That\u2019s a good question and something I asked some of those visitors myself. I asked them, how much research did you do on some of these guys? Did you feel that you need to know what they were on death row for before you met them? One of the visitors told me, \u2018I didn\u2019t. I don\u2019t\u00a0 Google people when I meet them in regular life.\u2019 And so I decided not to, because I knew the person that I would find online wasn\u2019t gonna be the person that I would meet. But there\u2019s one \u2026 (inmate) \u2026 in the book in particular that I became quite close with. His name\u2019s Terry Lynn King, and I did not look up a lot about his case. (King was convicted of first-degree murder and has been on Tennessee\u2019s death row since 1985). One thing I\u2019ve always said, and that other visitors have said to me, is you know enough just by the fact that the person\u2019s on death row. You know you only get there because you were convicted of killing someone, or more than one person. So for a lot of the visitors and for myself, that was kind of enough. I knew as a journalist \u2013 and for the book \u2013 that I was gonna have to get very deep into their past and the crimes they\u2019d committed. But as far as meeting them in the present, I wanted to just meet the person who was there then and take them on those terms. What kind of preparation did you have to make for visits with death row inmates? I tried not to think too much about it. The first time I went to Riverbend Maximum Security Institution for an execution, it felt very heavy psychologically.\u00a0 But the next time I went was to visit death row. So in some way, that was a much lighter evening because I knew I wasn\u2019t there for an execution. I was there with people who had been there before, and they were excited to see their friends on death row. As a reporter, I just wanted to soak as much of it in as as I could. I was in this atmosphere and environment that most people never get to see. How does the visitation process work? Tennessee\u2019s death row has a sort of unique setup in that it has a tiered system with levels. So when people first get there, they\u2019re very much kind of locked down in the more traditional way, and then based on time and behavior, they can get more privileges (such as visits). They are out of their cells most of the day and are able to do arts and crafts and buy food from the commissary and that kind of thing. In the book, I mention how Terry came with a bag of microwave popcorn, and was like, \u201cdo you want some popcorn?\u201d And went over to the corner and popped it.\u00a0It\u2019s such a surreal experience to go into the visitation gallery on death row. How big is the community of people who visit these inmates? It\u2019s hard to say, because there are consistently regular visitors and then there are others like me. But the community I talk about in the book has probably a dozen people. The first time I went there, there were about 12 visitors from the outside and that many men on death row in the room.\u00a0 It\u2019s a pretty small community. But one of the fascinating things about it is that the people have made it their mission to make it a bigger community by inviting more people to go out there. I was one of those people. Has this experience changed your views on the death penalty? I\u2019ve grown up believing that grace and redemption were good things, and that killing people, even if they had killed other people, was wrong. And so I came into this as someone who was opposed to the death penalty. And the more I reported on it as a journalist, I became more aware of the way the death penalty system in America does not uphold its own standards. It\u2019s become arbitrary in the sense that there are some states where you can commit a crime, and you\u2019ll get sentenced to death. And in another state, you could commit the same crime, and you wouldn\u2019t. Even within states, there may be one county where you\u2019ll get sentenced to death for a crime but not in other counties. But the more I witnessed these executions, I became more convinced that the distance that we keep between ourselves as a society and this issue is a big part of what allows it (the death penalty) to persist. If more people spent time with people on death row, if they witnessed these executions, they may feel differently about them. In the history of the death penalty, we\u2019ve made a lot of changes in how we do it \u2014 you know \u2026 hanging people to electrocuting people to lethal injection. Now we\u2019ve got states trying gas, and other ways. But in my experience, seeing lethal injection and two electrocutions, no matter how you do it \u2014 it looks very clearly like killing a person.\u00a0 Once you see it up close, it\u2019s very obvious.\u00a0 In the book, I describe it as barbarism dressed as bureaucracy and armed with legal jargon. There\u2019s also a racial disparity in that the race of the victim has a very strong correlation with the sentence. People who kill white people have been more likely to be sentenced to death that people who kill black people. It\u2019s just not a fair way to handle those crimes. What executions did you witness, and did those inmates have any notable last words? I witnessed the lethal injection of Billy Ray Irick and the electrocutions of David Earl Miller and Stephen West.\u00a0Irick initially declined to make a final statement\u00a0before suddenly saying he was sorry. Miller just said, \u201cbeats being on death row.\u201d But the one that comes to my mind most often is West weeping in the electric chair. I don\u2019t know and can\u2019t really imagine everything that was going through his mind then. But I often see in my mind the image of him strapped in the electric chair with tears running down his face. What do you hope people take away from your book? I hope it challenges people\u2019s preconceived notions about both the men on death row and the kind of visitors they get. One thing that\u2019s core to the theme of the book is the premise of the death penalty \u2026 that there are some people who are so terrible that they cannot come back from it. They cannot be rehabilitated or changed. And I have seen that is not true. Because I have met some of the people on Tennessee\u2019s death row who I would let in my house with my children. And that is not to diminish the crimes they committed. But it\u2019s because they\u2019re nothing like the person who committed that crime for a variety of reasons, whether it\u2019s mental health, whether it\u2019s substance abuse, whether it\u2019s the childhood they had. Some of the people I met have been on death row longer than I have been alive. They are not the same people anymore.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/07/us/death-row-visitors-executions-cec/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/09/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_08_us_los-angeles-burbank-homeless-person-abandoned", "text": "The Los Angeles City Council president says surveillance video taken from outside his district office in North Hollywood on Thursday\u00a0shows officers from another city\u2019s police department\u00a0dropping a homeless person off on the sidewalk and \u201cabandoning\u201d him there and has called for a state\u00a0investigation of the incident. \u201cA Burbank Police Department vehicle pulled up in front of my office,\u201d Council President Paul Krekorian, a Democrat, said in a news conference Friday. \u201cA\u00a0person was discharged from that vehicle in handcuffs. The handcuffs were removed. The person fell to the sidewalk, clearly experiencing a mental health crisis, as well as physical injuries and the officers of the Burbank Police Department got back in their vehicle and drove back to Burbank, without giving any aid to this person, without determining whether there was anyone who could provide services to this person.\u201d As seen in the surveillance video played at the news conference, two officers escort the man out of the back seat of their vehicle and remove apparent hand restraints. Walking away from the vehicle, the man appears to lose balance, waves his arms, and falls to the sidewalk on all fours. The police vehicle departs as the man later lies flat on his stomach. The video ends and it is unclear for how long he remained on the sidewalk. Krekorian said he introduced a motion on Friday, calling on the Los Angeles City Attorney, County\u00a0District Attorney, and the Attorney General of California to investigate the matter and to \u201cascertain what appropriate legal actions should be taken.\u201d Burbank Mayor Nick Schultz in a\u00a0post on X\u00a0Friday assured that the \u201cCity of Burbank takes the concerns raised by Los Angeles City Councilmember Paul Krekorian seriously,\u201d saying the city was \u201cgathering all of the facts.\u201d The Burbank Police Department then issued a\u00a0statement, saying it was aware of a video showing Burbank police officers dropping off the individual on the sidewalk in North Hollywood. According to the police department, they had initially responded to a call for service Thursday around 8:45 a.m., regarding a naked person sitting at a bus stop just outside Providence Saint Joseph Medical Center in Burbank. Responding officers found him \u201clucid and communicative,\u201d and the man got dressed after a conversation with the officers, the statement said. Police said the man told them he was homeless and had been transported from the Sunland-Tujunga neighborhood in Los Angeles\u00a0to the hospital for a leg injury he had suffered \u201cmany years ago.\u201d According to police, the man had left the hospital voluntarily prior to the officers\u2019 arrival and had declined any medical attention. Burbank Police said officers then offered to drive the man \u201cto a place of his choosing,\u201d and he asked to be taken to Sunland-Tujunga, but \u201cultimately agreed to be transported to the Metro Red Line in North Hollywood.\u201d \u201cHe voluntarily got into the patrol vehicle and was driven towards the Metro Red Line station. Along the way, the individual asked to be let out of the patrol vehicle to get coffee. The officers complied immediately with his request,\u00a0pulled over, and let the individual out of the patrol vehicle,\u201d the statement continued. In a statement to CNN Saturday, Providence Saint Joseph Medical Center said they are aware of Thursday morning\u2019s incident and says that \u201cmultiple calls\u201d were made to police, including one from a hospital security guard, regarding a person apparently in distress on a public sidewalk. \u201cI was outraged by it and continue to be,\u201d Krekorian said at his news conference on Friday. \u201cIt\u2019s almost impossible to fathom, you know, professionals who are trained and paid to protect and serve the public - to take somebody at this moment of maximum vulnerability, somebody seeking medical care - and dumping, literally dumping, him on a sidewalk to fend for himself. It\u2019s a disgrace.\u201d According to the council member, after being made aware of the surveillance video, his staff drove around trying to find the man, whom Krekorian did not identify, located him around 3 p.m., and were able to secure medical care for him through the Los Angeles Fire Department. \u201cIt\u2019s\u00a0been widely assumed by many, and we hear anecdotally, that some of our surrounding cities and\u00a0jurisdictions, who don\u2019t spend their resources on providing services, who don\u2019t build shelters for their unhoused residents, who don\u2019t invest in permanent supportive housing, who don\u2019t do the basic human things necessary to address homelessness, are instead pushing their unhoused population into the city of Los Angeles,\u201d Krekorian claimed. \u201cWe know it happens, and it\u2019s just rare that we actually get to see it with our own eyes like we can in this video.\u201d \u201cI would submit that if you see it happening like this on a random security camera, chances are it\u2019s happening a lot more often,\u201d he added. The Burbank Police Department said it is currently conducting an \u201cin-depth investigation\u201d into the incident, including the actions of the involved police officers. The investigation will include a review of all available body-worn and\u00a0in-car camera footage, interviews with witnesses, and any other relevant evidence, according to the department. \u201cThe Burbank Police Department remains committed to treating the unhoused community with compassion and respect, and thanks Los Angeles City Council President Paul Krekorian for bringing this matter to our attention,\u201d their statement said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/08/us/los-angeles-burbank-homeless-person-abandoned/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/09/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_08_tech_apple-wwdc-event-2024", "text": "Apple is on the verge of kicking off perhaps its most important event in years as it faces a gauntlet of challenges. At its annual Worldwide Developers Conference starting Monday, the company is widely expected to announce a partnership with ChatGPT maker OpenAI and unveil the first batch of generative AI tools coming to its mobile operating system. A big push into AI could spur growth for iPhone sales and services for years to come, as users are now waiting longer to upgrade their devices and an uncertain economic environment weighs on consumers, particularly in China. The company also faces regulatory scrutiny in Washington and was passed this week by chip maker Nvidia as the second-largest public company in the US. \u201cWe see generative AI as a key opportunity across our products and believe we have advantages that set us apart there,\u201d Apple CEO Tim Cook said on the company\u2019s most recent earnings call in early May, noting the company would announce news in the \u201cweeks ahead.\u201d The timing is also noteworthy: Apple is not always first to adopt and integrate emerging technologies \u2014 it typically researches, develops and aims to perfect new tech for years before including it in new products \u2014 but the speed at which the world is adopting generative AI is perhaps expediting the company\u2019s need to have a smartphone with the most cutting-edge technology. According to Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, the company going all in on AI will \u201ckick off a new frontier for Apple\u201d \u2013 one that will have a lasting impact on its products and services. Here\u2019s a closer look at what to expect at Apple\u2019s big event: AI, AI and more AI Apple is expected to call its AI initiative \u201cApple Intelligence\u201d and make opt-in only. It will require an iPhone 15 Pro or a device with an M1 chip or newer, according to a new report by Bloomberg. Perhaps the most obvious way Apple could embrace generative AI \u2013 the buzzy form of artificial intelligence that can provide thoughtful and thorough responses to questions \u2013 is through Siri, the company\u2019s virtual assistant with a hit-or-miss track record. An integration with OpenAI\u2019s latest ChatGPT-4o model could catapult Siri years forward by turning the feature into an iPhone chatbot. This could enable Siri to perform specific tasks such as recalling a picture taken years ago on the device or answering detailed questions about the weather, the news or trivia. Over time, it could learn the user\u2019s preferences and even personality, and respond accordingly. Looking at how competitors have already introduced generative tools, AI-powered features for the iPhone could also likely assist users with summarizing and drafting emails or bringing information up on a device\u2019s screen with a finger gesture. It will also likely adapt automatically and seamlessly to users, based on voice, audio and natural language, along with images and contextual cues. \u201cGenerative AI will allow the next generations of iPhones to become a sixth sense, empowering us to scan and interact with the world around us,\u201d Thomas Husson, an analyst with market research firm Forrester, told CNN. It could also mean changes for Apple\u2019s whole ecosystem by embedding AI within its own apps, such as Apple Maps, iMovie and iPhoto. Some analysts expect Apple to release tools for brand developers and app makers to create new experiences. Reece Hayden, a senior analyst at ABI Research, said he expects the demos during the event to highlight points where on-device AI brings additional value. He also believes Apple will spend time outlining its long-term vision. \u201cAI will increasingly be foundational to Apple\u2019s entire strategic focus, so it will highlight the R&D efforts moving forward, expected investment and acquisitions that the company has made to support their proposition,\u201d he said. A strategic partnership In the spring, Apple was reportedly discussing partnership opportunities with both OpenAI and Google to power its AI tools. But now the company is believed to have inked a deal with the ChatGPT creator, a partnership Apple could elaborate on during the opening keynote on Monday. \u201cIf OpenAI is responsible for powering Apple\u2019s AI capabilities, I would expect a formal partnership announcement as consumers and enterprises want to understand the regulation and rules and what they are signing up for and how their data is being utilized,\u201d Hayden said. Although the partnership would give the company a much-needed innovation boost, it could also hinder Apple\u2019s control over product development and over the rules and regulation on data collection and privacy, Hayden said. Apple aligning itself with a company and a technology that have yet to win public trust could pose some risks for Apple down the line. OpenAI continues to face criticism over some of its practices. This week, a group of current and former OpenAI employees demanded artificial intelligence companies be far more transparent about AI\u2019s \u201cserious risks\u201d \u2014 and that they protect employees who voice concerns about the technology they\u2019re building. The group called for AI companies to foster \u201ca culture of open criticism\u201d that welcomes, rather than punishes, people who speak up about their concerns, especially as regulation struggles to catch up to the quickly advancing technology. A focus on privacy and security Apple has been long focused on consumer privacy and security, and that will likely also be reflected in Monday\u2019s announcements. Companies have acknowledged the serious risks posed by AI \u2014 from manipulation and the spread of misinformation to a loss of control that could potentially result in human extinction. Many researchers and AI workers have expressed the need to better educate the public about risks and protective measures. Apple will need to address how using this type of technology will impact consumers. Vision Pro update Apple will likely provide an update to its Vision Pro mixed reality headset, which was announced one year ago this week and released for purchase in February. During its most recent earnings call, CEO Tim Cook said more than half of the Fortune 100 companies have already bought an Apple Vision Pro. \u201c[We] are exploring innovative ways to use it to do things that weren\u2019t possible before,\u201d he added. Generative AI could potentially propel the headset into another level of personalization and immersion and usher in new use cases for businesses, particularly in the education and medical spaces. Tuong Nygugen, a director analyst at market research firm Gartner, said any company interested in headsets \u201chas to be thinking about [AI]\u201d across all of its product lines. \u201cNobody really knows what\u2019s a winner yet, so they\u2019re pulling together all these use cases right now, with a focus on enterprise, and making a case for why this is the future of experiences and devices,\u201d he said. Upgrades could also boost sales of the pricey Vision Pro, which starts at $3,499 and has reportedly seen weak demand.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/08/tech/apple-wwdc-event-2024/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/09/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_07_business_google-doj-antitrust-case-judge-decision", "text": "A US federal judge ruled on Friday that an antitrust lawsuit brought by the US government against Google will be decided by a judge and not a jury after Google wrote the government a check, paying back the full amount of monetary damages the lawsuit sought. The case regarding Google\u2019s advertising technology is the first antitrust suit against a Big Tech company brought by the Biden administration. US District Judge Leonie Brinkema\u2019s decision on Friday is a setback for the Justice Department, which sought a jury trial for the case. The DOJ and multiple states have alleged in the ad-tech case that Google bulldozed rivals through anticompetitive mergers and bullied publishers and advertisers into using the company\u2019s proprietary ad technology products. Brinkema ruled in Google\u2019s favor after the tech company argued that the check \u2014 for $2.3 million, according to a Google spokesperson \u2014 settled the government\u2019s claim for damages and that a jury was no longer needed to try the case. In a statement, a Google spokesperson, Peter Schottenfels, celebrated Brinkema\u2019s decision. \u201cDOJ\u2019s contrived damages claim has disintegrated. We\u2019re glad the Court ruled that this case will be tried by a judge,\u201d Schottenfels said. \u201cAs we\u2019ve said, this case is a meritless attempt to pick winners and losers in a highly competitive industry that has contributed to overwhelming economic growth for businesses of all sizes.

{"id": "2024_06_08_us_rust-shooting-timeline-alec-baldwin", "text": "The actor Alec Baldwin and several crew members gathered in a church at a New Mexico ranch on October 21, 2021, to rehearse a scene from their upcoming Western film \u201cRust.\u201d Then came the unexpected gunshot. A promising cinematographer was killed, a director was wounded and a film production was left in shambles. Since that day\u2019s fatal shooting of 42-year-old Halyna Hutchins, the film\u2019s armorer and its assistant director have been convicted of criminal charges. And after some back-and-forth legal arguments, Baldwin soon is set to stand trial on charges of involuntary manslaughter. The details of what happened that day have been made public in affidavits, probable cause statements, interviews with the main participants and testimony at criminal trials. Here\u2019s a timeline of the on-set shooting and the resulting legal cases. The shooting May 29, 2020: Baldwin, the three-time Emmy winner for his roles on \u201c30 Rock\u201d and \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d was announced as producer and star of the Western feature film \u201cRust,\u201d based on a story by Baldwin and Joel Souza, Deadline reported. In the film, Baldwin plays a grizzled outlaw on the run from authorities with his 13-year-old grandson. October 6, 2021: Filming of \u201cRust\u201d began at Bonanza Creek Ranch, a movie set outside Santa Fe, New Mexico. October 20, 2021: Several crew members walked off set, citing safety concerns. One crew member stated there had been two accidental weapons discharges and a special effects mess-up that set off explosives around the crew between takes. October 21, 2021: Hannah Gutierrez Reed, the armorer for \u201cRust,\u201d loaded a prop six-shot revolver with what she believed were \u201cdummy\u201d rounds, a term for ammo that contains no explosive elements but appear to be real, according to investigators and her defense attorney. Baldwin and several crew members began rehearsing a scene in a rustic church on set before breaking for lunch. After the break, Baldwin, Souza, Hutchins and a few others returned to the church for rehearsal. Assistant director Dave Halls fetched a prop gun from a cart outside the church and yelled \u201ccold gun,\u201d indicating it was unloaded. He then handed the gun to Baldwin. Baldwin practiced a \u201ccross draw\u201d \u2013 pulling a gun from a holster on the opposite side of his body from his draw hand. The scene required him to point the gun toward the camera, helmed by Hutchins, Souza and a camera operator. Suddenly, they heard a loud bang. Hutchins stumbled backward, slumped to the floor clutching her stomach and said she couldn\u2019t feel her legs. Souza, who had been standing beside her, noticed blood on his shoulder. At 1:48 p.m., the crew reported the shooting to emergency responders. Hutchins was transported by air helicopter to the hospital and was pronounced dead at 3:37 p.m. Souza was treated at the hospital, and a projectile from a live round was removed from his back. Sheriff\u2019s deputies arrived to the scene and began investigating the series of events leading to the shooting. October 22, 2021: Baldwin released a statement calling the death a \u201ctragic accident\u201d and said he is fully cooperating with the police investigation. December 2, 2021: In an interview with ABC, Baldwin said he cocked the gun and let go of the hammer, and the gun then fired. He said he was aiming the gun just to the side of the camera toward Hutchins, as she instructed him to do. \u201cI would never point a gun at anyone and then pull the trigger, never,\u201d he said. The investigations August 14, 2022: FBI testing of the firearm found it could not be fired without pulling the trigger while the gun was cocked, according to a forensics report. The report noted the gun eventually malfunctioned during FBI testing after internal parts fractured, causing the gun to go off in the cocked position without pulling the trigger. August 20, 2022: In an interview with CNN, Baldwin\u00a0placed responsibility\u00a0for Hutchins\u2019 death on Gutierrez Reed, the film armorer and props assistant, and on assistant director Halls, who handed him the gun. October 5, 2022: The family of Hutchins and Baldwin reached an undisclosed settlement in a wrongful death lawsuit filed against the actor and others. As part of the settlement, Matthew Hutchins, the cinematographer\u2019s widower, was named an executive producer on \u201cRust.\u201d January 19, 2023: Prosecutors announced Baldwin and Gutierrez Reed will be charged with involuntary manslaughter in Hutchins\u2019 death. Halls, the assistant director, agreed to plead no contest to negligent use of a deadly weapon, the district attorney\u2019s office announced. The terms of that deal include six months of probation\u00a0and a suspended sentence, prosecutors said. January 31, 2023: Baldwin and Gutierrez Reed were formally charged with involuntary manslaughter. February 23, 2023: Baldwin pleaded not guilty to manslaughter charges and was released on personal recognizance. April 20, 2023: New Mexico special prosecutors dismissed the charges against Baldwin, citing \u201cnew facts\u201d in the case. \u201cThis decision does not absolve Mr. Baldwin of criminal culpability and charges may be refiled,\u201d they said. August 9, 2023: Gutierrez Reed pleaded not guilty to involuntary manslaughter and tampering with evidence. January 19: Baldwin was indicted by a grand jury on charges of involuntary manslaughter. January 31: Baldwin pleaded not guilty to involuntary manslaughter charges for the second time. February 22: The trial of film armorer Gutierrez Reed began. Prosecutors alleged her failures allowed six live bullets to make their way on set, and she did not make vital safety checks that would have caught the problem. Her defense blamed Baldwin for failing to follow common-sense gun safety rules and on the film\u2019s production team for creating a chaotic and unsafe environment. March 1: Souza, the director and screenwriter, testified about the moment he was shot on set while standing behind Hutchins. March 6: Gutierrez Reed was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter after jurors deliberated for nearly three hours. She was acquitted of a charge of evidence tampering. April 15: At her sentencing hearing, Gutierrez Reed said \u201cmy heart aches\u201d for Hutchins\u2019 family and friends, and she asked the judge to sentence her to probation. The judge criticized her statement and sentenced her to the maximum 18 months in prison, saying, \u201cYou alone turned a safe weapon into a lethal weapon.\u201d May 24: A New Mexico judge denied Baldwin\u2019s motion to dismiss the involuntary manslaughter indictment. Baldwin\u2019s attorneys had accused prosecutors of misconduct during the grand jury process. June 3: New Mexico prosecutors asked the court to grant use immunity to Gutierrez Reed and compel her to testify at Baldwin\u2019s trial, according to court documents. Gutierrez Reed invoked her Fifth Amendment right to silence in a pre-trial interview, and prosecutors said if she is not granted immunity then she would not be able to testify in the trial. Gutierrez Reed\u2019s attorney, Jason Bowles, told CNN he will oppose the motion.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/08/us/rust-shooting-timeline-alec-baldwin/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/09/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_08_us_harvey-weinstein-appeal-los-angeles-sexual-assault-conviction", "text": "Just over a month after his conviction was overturned in New York, attorneys for disgraced movie mogul Harvey Weinstein filed an appeal\u00a0Friday to overturn\u00a0his Los Angeles conviction from December 2022, when he was found guilty on three sexual assault charges and sentenced to 16 years in prison. Weinstein was convicted on charges of rape, sexual penetration by a foreign object and forcible oral copulation associated with Jane Doe 1, one of four women who testified in the trial. Weinstein\u2019s attorneys are now seeking a new trial, according to court documents filed in California\u2019s Second District Court of Appeal. The appeal filing says Weinstein did not receive a fair trial because evidence was excluded regarding the whereabouts of Jane Doe 1 on the\u00a0date\u00a0of the alleged assault, prosecutors didn\u2019t disclose a romantic affair\u00a0Jane Doe 1\u00a0was in at the time of the\u00a0incident, and uncharged alleged criminal assaults by Weinstein were included in evidence. \u201cDefendant\u2019s trial was a free-for-all where the prosecution offered evidence of a dozen uncharged sex crimes and other \u2018offenses\u2019 related to the \u2018mistreatment\u2019 of women,\u201d the filing says. \u201cBut the jury was misguided about what they could do with the highly prejudicial information. The jury was sent to deliberate with a match and barrel of explosive evidence.\u201d Dave Ring, an attorney representing Jane Doe 1, said in a statement to CNN, \u201cWeinstein\u2018s appeal makes the same tired arguments that he previously made multiple times, without success, to the trial court.\u00a0We are of the strong opinion that the trial court vetted the evidence appropriately and made all the correct decisions in its evidentiary rulings. We are confident that Weinstein\u2019s appeal will be denied and he will spend many years in prison.\u201d Prosecutors in the Los Angeles trial said Weinstein was a powerful figure in Hollywood who used his influence to lure women into private meetings, assault them and then silence any accusations. CNN has reached out to the Los Angeles County District Attorney\u2019s office for comment on the appeal. The appeal comes after Weinstein\u2019s 2020 rape conviction in New York was overturned in April by a New York Appeals court. The court ruled the testimony of \u201cprior bad acts\u201d witnesses should not have been allowed because it \u201cwas unnecessary to establish defendant\u2019s intent and served only to establish defendant\u2019s propensity to commit the crimes charged.\u201d The ruling sent shockwaves through communities of sexual assault survivors, particularly the more than 100 women who have accused Weinstein of assault and harassment. A new trial was ordered and\u00a0prosecutors in Manhattan say they plan to retry him. Ahead of retrial, additional accusers have come forward with claims against the Hollywood producer. \u201cWe will do everything in our power to retry this case, and remain steadfast in our commitment to survivors of sexual assault,\u201d\u00a0said Emily Tuttle, deputy director of communications and senior advisor\u00a0for the Manhattan District Attorney\u2019s Office. Weinstein\u2019s attorneys argued\u00a0in the Los Angeles appeal that prosecutors brought up his New York conviction during jury selection and violated his right to a fair and impartial trial. \u201cDefendant is entitled to a new trial where his constitutional rights are safeguarded, where he is permitted to present evidence of his innocence, and where his conduct is on trial - not his character,\u201d the filing says.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/08/us/harvey-weinstein-appeal-los-angeles-sexual-assault-conviction/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/09/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_07_us_911-dispatcher-pennsylvania", "text": "Prosecutors this week dropped an involuntary manslaughter case against a 911 dispatcher in Pennsylvania who had been accused of failing to send an ambulance to the rural home of a woman who was found dead a day later of internal bleeding. Greene County District Attorney Brianna Vanata said she acted to end the\u00a0case against Leon \u201cLee\u201d Price\u00a0after reviewing an investigator\u2019s report that said he felt charges were not justified in the July 2020 death of 54-year-old Diania Kronk. \u201cThere was just no criminal culpability here,\u201d Vanata said in a phone interview Thursday. She said the decision to pursue charges two years after Kronk died \u2014 and shortly after her family filed a lawsuit over it \u2014 was a mistake by the then-district attorney, Dave Russo. \u201cI\u2019m not sure what the previous district attorney was thinking,\u201d Vanata said. \u201cThat\u2019s where I\u2019m at.\u201d Price\u2019s defense lawyer, Timothy Ross, said Thursday the charges had been a stressful ordeal for his client, who he described as an upstanding employee who had consistently maintained he was innocent of the allegations. In the wake of Kronk\u2019s death, Ross said, an investigator had told Price he would not be charged. Ross said Price is \u201cmoving forward, rebuilding his reputation in this community and just happy to put these charges behind him.\u201d Investigators had said Price was reluctant to dispatch help without getting more assurances Kronk would actually go to the hospital. Vanata said she based her decision on an August 2020 memo by Greene County Regional Police Chief Zachary Sams that said Price may not have been trained properly and the investigator felt Price\u2019s actions did not \u201crise to the levels necessary to facilitate a criminal charge.\u201d On a recording, Price was heard questioning Kronk\u2019s daughter, Kelly Titchenell, for about four minutes. As Titchenell described her mother\u2019s condition, Price asked if Kronk was \u201cwilling to go\u201d to the hospital about a half-hour away from her home in Sycamore. Titchenell assured him she would and said she was concerned her mother might die. Titchenell told the dispatcher Kronk had been drinking heavily for some weeks, she had been losing weight and appeared to be turning yellow. Price said he would send an ambulance but then added that \u201cwe really need to make sure she\u2019s willing to go.\u201d Price asked Titchenell to call once she got to Kronk\u2019s home, but Titchenell said she could not find her mother\u2019s landline and there was no cell service. Titchenell said that when she got to Kronk\u2019s home, her mother was nude on the porch and talking incoherently, telling her repeatedly she was OK. Titchenell said an autopsy attributed Kronk\u2019s death to internal bleeding. Titchenell did not call 911 again on her way home, believing that her uncle would soon check on her mother. The uncle discovered the next day that Kronk had died. Russo defended the charges on Thursday, saying there was ample evidence and called Vanata\u2019s move to drop the case a political decision. Russo said the involuntary manslaughter charge had survived previous efforts by the defense to have it dismissed. At Vanata\u2019s request, a judge withdrew the charges on Monday. Jury selection and trial had been scheduled for next week. Vanata said she approached Price about a potential plea bargain to a lesser charge but he did not take the deal. Titchenell questions the decision to drop charges. \u201cI feel that there was too much for the new district attorney to go through,\u201d Titchenell said in a phone interview Wednesday. \u201cShe would have had to put in a lot of time and work to understand this case, to go over everything. I feel there was too much for her, so she was trying to basically get away without going to trial.\u201d Vanata, who beat Russo in the\u00a02023 GOP\u00a0primary by 44 percentage points, said she spent \u201cmany, many hours\u201d going through the evidence since taking office in January. \u201cIt definitely was not an easy decision to come to.\u201d Price is no longer a dispatcher and now works for Greene County in maintenance. \u201cMr. Price did lose his job and this, I\u2019m sure, has been an ordeal for him,\u201d Vanata said. \u201cBut also I feel so horrible for the family that had to go through this as well. It dragged them along for four years also.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/07/us/911-dispatcher-pennsylvania/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/09/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_08_business_red-lobster-black-history", "text": "Communities around the country are losing cheddar bay biscuits and all-you-can-eat seafood deals as troubled Red Lobster closes around 100 US restaurants, with up to 135 more closures looming. But Red Lobster\u2019s decline is particularly a loss for many Black diners, who formed a loyal base for the brand and still account for a higher share of customers than other major casual chain restaurants, according to historians, customers and former Red Lobster executives. \u201cRed Lobster cultivated Black customers. It has not shied away from that customer base like some brands have,\u201d Clarence Otis Jr., the former CEO of Darden Restaurants from 2004 to 2014, when the company still owned the chain, told CNN. After Otis became CEO, Sacramento Observer columnist Mardeio Cannon wrote that \u201cit is only fitting\u201d Red Lobster had a Black CEO because \u201cif there is any restaurant in America that most African Americans love, it\u2019s Red Lobster.\u201d In a 2015 presentation to investors, Red Lobster said 16% of customers were Black, two percentage points higher than the Black share of the US population. Red Lobster did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment on current customer demographics. The chain hired Black workers and served Black guests from its beginnings in the South in the late 1960s, and Black celebrities such as Chris Rock and Nicki Minaj worked there before they became famous. (Minaj later joked about being fired from \u201call three or four\u201d of the Red Lobsters where she worked over \u201cLobsterita\u201d drinks and cheddar bay biscuits with Jimmy Fallon.) And Beyonc\u00e9 sang about taking a romantic partner to Red Lobster in her 2016 song \u201cFormation,\u201d which addresses police brutality, Hurricane Katrina and Black culture in America.  Red Lobster attracted both working-class and affluent Black diners during the 1970s and 1980s at a time when many sit-down restaurants were unwelcoming of Black patrons, said Marcia Chatelain, a professor of Africana studies at the University of Pennsylvania and author of \u201cFranchise: The Golden Arches in Black America,\u201d which explores the relationship between McDonald\u2019s and Black consumers. Red Lobster\u2019s early locations near shopping malls also helped it grow with Black customers, she said.  \u201cThe placement of Red Lobster outlets near shopping malls coincided with the opening of more retail options for African Americans after the Civil Rights Act of 1964,\u201d she said in an email. \u201cThis style of restaurant was appealing to people seeking a fine dining-like experience without dealing with the uncertainty of how they would be treated at local businesses.\u201d Civil rights mythology Founded by Bill Darden, Red Lobster was racially integrated when it opened in 1968 in Lakeland, Florida. Hiring and serving Black people was not a revolutionary step by Darden, and he certainly was far from the first to leap at the opportunity. But it was another marker of racial progress for Black people in Lakeland and the changing South. In Lakeland during the early 1960s, local civil rights activists picketed businesses and movie theaters that denied entry to Black patrons, forcing them to integrate. Although Red Lobster\u2019s opening came four years after passage of the Civil Rights Act mandating desegregation of public accommodations, many schools and businesses still were segregated. Some closed rather than integrate. Red Lobster was \u201calways very open and receptive to us,\u201d said Beverly Boatwright, who was active in the sit-in movement in Lakeland while attending the all-Black high school, along with her mother, a leader in the local branch of the NAACP. \u201cWe never had a problem at Red Lobster. There were other places where we did have struggles\u201d in the city. But Red Lobster was not immediately a popular spot with Black customers in Lakeland, and the mythology of Darden as a civil rights pioneer that has grown in recent years has been overstated. Red Lobster was not a \u201cplace we frequented a whole lot\u201d in its early days, said Harold Dwight, who graduated two years after Boatwright in 1968. Most Black residents did not have the means to go out to eat, Dwight said. When they did, they went to establishments run by Black owners and Morrison\u2019s Cafeteria, the largest cafeteria chain in the South, which had been integrated for several years and had more Black employees. In corporate lore, Darden\u2019s first restaurant, the Green Frog \u2014which opened in 1938 in Waycross, Georgia \u2014 was desegregated. Darden has been lauded in various articles as a \u201csocial crusader\u201d \u201cwho [stood] up to Jim Crow\u201d in \u201cdefiance\u201d of segregation laws. On Darden Restaurants\u2019 corporate website, the company mentions the Green Frog and says its founder \u201cwelcomed all guests to his tables.\u201d But the Green Frog did not welcome Black diners initially, according to Black people who grew up in Waycross and recall the Green Frog, which closed in the 1980s. John Fluker, a former mayor of Waycross, said Black people worked in the kitchen, but the Green Frog did not welcome Black customers. The Green Frog reflected the racial norms of the time in south Georgia, said Waycross resident Horace Thomas. \u201cThey didn\u2019t open the doors for Black people,\u201d he said. \u201cEverybody was like that.\u201d Cultural appeal Although Black customers did not immediately frequent Red Lobster, the chain gradually built strength with Black patrons as it expanded in the South and across the country. Red Lobster developed a reputation for being friendly and open to Black customers, in part because it had Black staff when a new restaurant opened, and it later developed marketing strategies to court Black diners, say historians and former executives. Walter King, who was hired in 1971 to manage a Red Lobster restaurant, was one of the company\u2019s earliest Black employees and stayed with the chain for 36 years. Red Lobster later named one of its signature dishes after King: \u201cWalt\u2019s Favorite Shrimp.\u201d King died last year. \u201cThey\u2019ve been loyal to us and we\u2019ve been loyal to them,\u201d Beverly Boatwright said. \u201cWe went there because the food was delicious. It was the only place you could get good seafood. It was a luxury.\u201d Red Lobster\u2019s cuisine was also a major part of its popularity with Black diners. Outdoor fish fries with catfish, crawfish and other seafood have served as a popular tradition in Black communities, said Robyn Autry, a sociology professor at Wesleyan University who studies race and wrote recently on how Red Lobster\u2019s downfall \u201chits differently\u201d for Black communities. Red Lobster brought the \u201coutdoor fried fish experience\u201d indoors, Autry said. For many Black people, it became a \u201cmarker of status to move from outdoor fish fries to sitting down with menus and being served.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/08/business/red-lobster-black-history/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/09/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_08_politics_democratic-convention-security-protests", "text": "Secret Service and Chicago police officials are ramping up preparations for the Democratic National Convention in August, with officers receiving training ranging from First Amendment rights to handling violent protests and mass arrests. Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle visited Chicago this week to tour the United Center, where the televised prime-time convention speeches will take place, and McCormick Place, the convention center where the party will conduct business during the daytime. The convention, which takes place from August 19 to 22,\u00a0is expected to draw a crowd of 50,000 visitors \u2013 including delegates, media, vendors and more \u2013 and is also sure to be met with huge protests. Democrats are poised to nominate President Joe Biden for reelection at\u00a0their Chicago convention.\u00a0But recent\u00a0demonstrations across the country against Biden\u2019s\u00a0support for Israel\u2019s war in Gaza\u00a0have raised the specter of a replay of the\u00a01968 Democratic convention, which\u00a0saw\u00a0violent clashes between\u00a0Chicago police\u00a0and\u00a0anti-Vietnam War protesters. On Monday,\u00a0Cheatle addressed the almost 100 agents of the Secret Service\u2019s Chicago field office in a closed-door meeting.\u00a0The Chicago field office also covers Milwaukee, where Republicans are holding their convention in July, so the team has been planning for both gatherings. Cheatle said in an interview that law enforcement officials are preparing for a wide range of scenarios. \u201cThe lone gunman,\u201d Cheatle said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got folks who are radicalized, you\u2019ve got demonstration that may pop up and, you know, obviously, we hope they remain peaceful here, but they could, you know, turn violent.\u201d The official security perimeter for\u00a0this summer\u2019s convention\u00a0hasn\u2019t yet been detailed. The city of Chicago, meanwhile, is negotiating over protest routes with groups that filed a federal lawsuit after the city denied their protest permits. The Chicago Police Department\u2019s\u00a0Crime Prevention and Information Center\u00a0will serve as its\u00a0command center to monitor all convention-related events\u00a0citywide, including protests.\u00a0The\u00a0command center\u00a0will also include representatives from\u00a0the Secret Service,\u00a0 the Illinois State Police,\u00a0the FBI\u00a0and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Federal and local authorities have been closely following the threat stream from both domestic and foreign extremist groups. A recent joint intelligence bulletin from the National Counterterrorism Center, the Department of Homeland Security and the FBI warned that groups, including al Qaeda and ISIS, continue to generate propaganda urging followers to conduct \u201clone wolf\u201d attacks on US soil using basic methods such as gunfire in crowded places or vehicles in ramming attacks. The bulletin cites an al Qaeda online propaganda article that highlighted the \u201cincreased division between the American people, between the right and the left, and between the Republicans and their supporters, and the Democrats and their supporters,\u201d which could increase the impact of any attack. \u201cI think everyone has a sense that the threats are real. This is not an academic exercise that we\u2019re running through. We are planning for\u00a0real-world\u00a0possibilities,\u201d said Jeff Burnside, the Secret\u00a0Service\u00a0coordinator\u00a0for the Democratic convention. Meanwhile, Chicago police officers have been holding drills on\u00a0a wide range of potential scenarios \u2014 including violent protests, extracting individuals from hostile crowds, medical emergencies and more. Bicycle teams have prepared to move quickly through the city to form barricades if necessary. Officers are also receiving constitutional and legal training on First Amendment protest rights and procedures if mass arrests are necessary. However, Chicago police\u00a0leaders say they hope the hundreds of hours of training, including tactics in de-escalation, will help to avoid clashes with protesters. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to have conflicts with people if we don\u2019t have to. We don\u2019t want to clash with people if we don\u2019t have to,\u201d Chicago Police Superintendent Larry Snelling said. \u201cIf people come here to express themselves, by all means do it, but do it according to the law and do it peacefully. It\u2019s that simple. Once you start to break the law, then \u2026 we have to restore the peace.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/08/politics/democratic-convention-security-protests/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/09/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_06_us_youtuber-alex-choi-charged-firework-lamborghini-helicopter", "text": "A popular Los Angeles YouTuber\u00a0faces an explosives charge with federal prosecutors accusing him of directing a video stunt in which fireworks were blasted from an airborne helicopter and at a speeding Lamborghini. Suk Min Choi,\u00a024, who also goes by Alex Choi, 24, was arrested Wednesday and charged with one count of causing the placement of an explosive or incendiary device on an aircraft, the US Attorney\u2019s Office for the Central District of California announced in a\u00a0news release\u00a0Thursday. Choi, who has 923,000 followers on\u00a0YouTube\u00a0and 1.2 million followers on\u00a0Instagram, posted a video titled \u201cDestroying a Lamborghini with Fireworks\u201d on July 4, 2023, according to an affidavit filed with the criminal complaint. The nearly 11-minute video, which is no longer posted on Choi\u2019s\u00a0social media\u00a0pages, shows two women shooting fireworks out of the helicopter and toward the sportscar, the affidavit said. \u201cAfter shooting what appears to be a live-action version of a fictionalized video game scene, the video transitions to a behind-the-scenes look at how Choi shot the first third of the video. During this portion of the video, Choi allegedly makes various references to himself coordinating the shoot,\u201d the US Attorney\u2019s Office said. Authorities believe the footage was shot in June 2023 on a federally-owned area of the El Mirage Dry Lakebed in\u00a0San Bernardino County, California. The Bureau of Land Management provided photos of tire marks left behind by the sports car, according to prosecutors. Choi is also accused of lacking the proper permits to film in the area, including Federal Aviation Administration approval for planned filming activities involving the helicopter, according to the affidavit. Additionally,\u00a0prosecutors said Choi traveled to Las Vegas to buy the fireworks because they are illegal in California. CNN\u00a0is attempting\u00a0to identify Choi\u2019s legal representation. No other people involved in the video were named in the affidavit. No injuries were reported as a result of the stunt, Ciaran McEvoy, a spokesperson for the US attorney\u2019s office, told CNN. Dozens of videos on Choi\u2019s YouTube channel feature flashy luxury sports cars, though the most recent video was posted in December. Choi made his initial appearance in court Thursday and was released on $50,000 bond,\u00a0McEvoy, said.\u00a0Choi did not enter a plea. His arraignment is scheduled for July 2. He faces up to 10 years in prison if convicted as charged, according to prosecutors.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/06/us/youtuber-alex-choi-charged-firework-lamborghini-helicopter/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/09/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_08_politics_joe-biden-emmanuel-macron-state-visit", "text": "President Joe Biden heralded the close ties between the United States and France on Saturday, calling his current visit \u201cthe most remarkable trip\u201d that he\u2019s made to the country as French President Emmanuel Macron hosted his US counterpart for an official state visit in Paris. \u201cThis week, we have once again showed the world \u2026 the power of allies, what we can achieve when we stand together. That\u2019s what the relationship between France and the United States exemplifies,\u201d Biden said in remarks with Macron from the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace. The visit comes as the US has strengthened its alliance with its oldest ally amid Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine, even as some signs of fissures have emerged over the conflict between Israel and Hamas in the Middle East. \u201cWhen we stand as one, our countries are stronger and literally, the world is safer,\u201d Biden said during a state dinner later Saturday. \u201cWe stand at an inflection point in history. The decisions we make now will determine the course of our future for decades to come.\u201d The state visit began with Macron and French first lady Brigitte Macron welcoming Biden and first lady Jill Biden with a formal ceremony at the Arc de Triomphe, a Paris landmark. The leaders paid their respects at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier and placed the end of a large sword into the eternal flame. A French military choir performed \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner\u201d followed by \u201cLa\u00a0Marseillaise.\u201d\u00a0Biden and Macron observed a flyover before greeting officials from a French delegation as bagpipes played \u201cAmazing Grace.\u201d The Bidens and Macrons signed a guestbook before boarding their respective vehicles, which drove slowly down the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, flanked by military personnel and American and French flags. The normally bustling Parisian thoroughfare was emptied of pedestrians, with significant road closures affecting the area. Biden described Saturday\u2019s arrival ceremony as a \u201cmoving experience.\u201d \u201cIt was a moving experience for a student of history to be at the Champs \u00c9lys\u00e9e today \u2013 that was a moving experience for us, the whole delegation,\u201d he said. Upon arriving at the \u00c9lsy\u00e9e Palace, the French president\u2019s official residence, the leaders posed for photos before beginning a working lunch. In the evening, the Macrons welcomed the Bidens back to the palace for a state dinner. Macron is returning the favor to Biden, who hosted the French president for a state visit at the White House in December 2022, the administration\u2019s first. Biden noted that the US celebrates Independence Day, the Fourth of July, next month. \u201cThat feat would not have been possible \u2026 were it not for France coming to our aid. We\u2019re a nation because of France, in large part. You stepped up when we needed help,\u201d he said. France, Biden said, \u201cwas our first friend. Remains one of our best friends.\u201d \u201cToday, I proudly stand with France and support freedom and democracy around the world. That\u2019s what this spectacular week is all about,\u201d he said. There has been much for the leaders to discuss. Macron, like other US allies, has privately questioned the future of US leadership in the world should Biden lose the November election to former President Donald Trump, with whom he had a more complicated relationship. Biden has frequently recalled meeting with world leaders early in his term during a G7 gathering where he pronounced, \u201cAmerica is back.\u201d \u201cAnd the French leader looked at me, and he said, \u2018For how long?\u2019\u201d Biden said to laughter at a March fundraiser in New York City. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t humorous. He said \u2013 he was serious, \u2018For how long?\u2019\u201d Biden has often pointed to those anxieties among his counterparts as he makes the case for a second term, though Europe has also had to contend with its own rising tide of populism. On the topic of Ukraine, both countries have touted their support for the war-torn country. Biden on Friday announced a new $225 billion aid package while apologizing to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for the congressional delay. And for his part, Macron has been one of the key leaders in Europe\u2019s response to Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. France has doubled its defense budget, announced it would surpass NATO\u2019s 2% defense spending benchmark and restarted domestic production of critical military inputs. Biden pointed to both countries\u2019 support for Ukraine as an example of their close relationship. \u201cWe know what happens if (Russian President Vladimir) Putin succeeds in subjugating Ukraine. \u2026 And we know Putin isn\u2019t going to stop at Ukraine \u2013 it\u2019s not just Ukraine, it\u2019s about much more than Ukraine. All of Europe will be threatened. We\u2019re not gonna let that happen,\u201d Biden said. On the Israel-Hamas war, Macron endorsed a ceasefire proposal laid out by Biden, writing in a post on X last week, \u201cThe war in Gaza must end. We support the US proposal for a durable peace.\u201d But France broke with Western allies last month as its Foreign Ministry expressed support for the International Criminal Court\u2019s decision to seek an arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar. Biden had called the ICC\u2019s decision \u201coutrageous.\u201d Both Macron and Biden on Saturday welcomed the news of the rescue of four Israeli hostages who were taken captive by Hamas on October 7, with Biden using the moment to press for the ceasefire proposal he detailed last week. \u201cWe won\u2019t stop working until all the hostages are home and a ceasefire is reached,\u201d the president said. The US-French relationship has dramatically improved from a low point early in the Biden administration. In September 2021, Macron took the extraordinary step of recalling his ambassador to Washington over a US-Australia submarine deal that blindsided the French and cost them a multibillion-dollar defense contract.\u00a0 \u201cThey have a warm and close relationship,\u201d National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby told reporters Friday evening. \u201cOne of the things the president respects and admires about President Macron is he\u2019s as honest and forthright as President Joe Biden is. That\u2019s what he wants to see in a friend, in an ally.\u201d Biden and Macron were also set to discuss deepening maritime cooperation in the Indo-Pacific, with an announcement expected to build law enforcement capacity and increase US-France technical cooperation on port security, Kirby said. \u201cI think you\u2019ll see that we are as close as we have ever been with our French allies,\u201d Kirby added.

East Brunswick Mayor Brad Cohen called the incident a \u201cblatant Anti-Semitic act.\u201d \u201cThe action resulted in a picture of Muslim students replacing the original photograph of the Jewish students,\u201d the mayor posted on Facebook. He called on school officials to answer a litany of questions, including how the incident happened, who was responsible and how perpetrators would be held accountable. On Thursday night, the school board announced an independent group will investigate. The private counsel started working on the case Friday, and it\u2019s unclear when findings will be completed. Student gets threats \u2018calling me a terrorist\u2019 The superintendent apologized on behalf of the East Brunswick Board of Education \u201cfor the hurt, pain and anguish this event has caused our Jewish students, their families and the impact this continues to have on the entire EB community.\u201d \u201cWe do not tolerate bias and we investigate all reported antisemitism,\u201d Valeski posted on Facebook. The Jewish Federation in the Heart of New Jersey demanded facts and accountability after it learned of \u201calterations of photos and names of Jewish students that, while under investigation, appear on their surface may be deliberate and malicious - and if not, then certainly negligent.\u201d Charlotte Friedman, president of the school\u2019s\u00a0Jewish Club, said \u201cit feels as if our identity as Jewish students has been symbolically erased.\u201d \u201cOver the past 48 hours, I have lost sleep and hours studying for my final exams,\u201d Friedman said at a school board meeting Thursday night. \u201cI am worried that there are classmates at EBHS who hate or mock Jewish club members just because we are Jewish.\u201d But it\u2019s not just Jewish students suffering from the yearbook incident. \u201cI\u2019ve personally seen death threats on social media, calling me a terrorist,\u201d a Muslim student identified as Zain told CNN affiliate\u00a0News 12 New Jersey. The Muslim Student Association \u201chad no involvement in this, yet we have become the face of the whole incident because our faces weren\u2019t even blurred out before the photo was posted on social media,\u201d MSA Vice President\u00a0Ali Salama said in a statement provided by the Council on American\u2013Islamic Relations\u2019 New Jersey office. Zain expressed sympathy for the Jewish community and described the Islamophobia he\u2019s endured since seeing his face in the misplaced photo. \u201cI want to offer my condolences to the Jewish community for the pain that they have suffered for the yearbook situation, and I hope that they are able to get their picture back into the yearbook after this is resolved,\u201d Zain said at Thursday\u2019s school board meeting. \u201cI was one of the students in the mislabeled yearbook photo, and I want to speak on behalf of myself and the MSA for the abhorrent Islamophobia that we endured during this event.\u201d He cited posts on social media that \u201ccompared me to a member of the KKK in Klan attire\u201d and called \u201cfor my deportation.\u201d Another student at the meeting said MSA members \u201chave been unjustly blamed\u201d and subjected to online abuse. The high school junior questioned the differing responses to the Jewish community and the Muslim community. \u201cOver the past few days, all we have heard about is how hurt the Jewish community is and how everyone is rallying to support them. While we deeply empathize with their pain, it raises a critical question: When will it be our turn?\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cWe need assurance that our voices are heard, our concerns are addressed and that we, too, are given the support and protection we so desperately need.\u201d In a later Facebook post, the superintendent acknowledged Muslim students had also felt backlash. \u201cAs I mentioned impacts to our Jewish students and families earlier today, I want to offer sincere apologies to our Muslim students and families, as well,\u201d Valeski wrote Wednesday. \u201cI am aware that the picture placed in the yearbook has caused pain for our Muslim students and for that I am deeply sorry.\u201d What happens next While the investigation continues, seniors who received yearbooks have been asked to return them so that the errant page can be replaced. The school district has been working with the publisher to reproduce the yearbook page, and printing has already started, Valeski said. The new page will include a photo of the actual Jewish Student Union and the names of the club\u2019s members. Underclassmen had not yet received their yearbooks and will get corrected versions, the superintendent said. \u201cWe do not have all the facts but I will report to the community once I do,\u201d Valeski wrote in his initial Facebook post. \u201cI urge the East Brunswick community \u2026 to give me the opportunity to determine the cause and I simply ask individuals and organizations to slow their rush to judgment.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/08/us/east-brunswick-high-school-yearbook-reaj/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/09/2024", "section": "us"}}
