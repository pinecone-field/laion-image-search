{"id": "2024_07_23_us_sonya-massey-police-shooting-what-went-wrong", "text": "The law enforcement visit to Sonya Massey\u2019s home near Springfield, Illinois, earlier this month began with a calm conversation between the 36-year-old Black woman and two White sheriff\u2019s deputies at her front door and in her living room. They asked how she was doing mentally and if she needed help. She said, \u201cI love ya\u2019ll,\u201d and rifled through her belongings to find her ID. And then in the space of about 45 seconds, the deputies took a series of actions that left Massey lying on a pool of blood on her kitchen floor and led to murder charges against one of the deputies, Sean Grayson. How did this visit escalate so quickly? With help from law enforcement analysts and 36 minutes of body-camera footage released Monday, CNN took a closer look at what the deputies did and what they could have done differently. The analysts, as well as Illinois prosecutors and the sheriff, found Grayson took several steps to escalate the situation rather than lower the temperature and reassess Massey\u2019s needs. \u201cThe Body Worn Camera footage has now been released, and the public can see what we saw: Sonya Massey lost her life due to an unjustifiable and reckless decision by former Deputy Sean Grayson,\u201d Sangamon County Sheriff Jack Campbell said in a statement Monday. \u201cGrayson had other options available that he should have used. His actions were inexcusable and do not reflect the values or training of our office.\u201d While some policing experts may be hesitant to critically analyze the actions of police officers after the fact, the Police Executive Research Forum, an independent organization focusing on best practices in law enforcement, advises department leaders to gather their officers and review controversial use-of-force incidents. Chuck Wexler, the organization\u2019s executive director, said their training helps police resolve situations that don\u2019t involve firearms. \u201cIf at any point the situation starts to go in a different direction, then you have to have a plan B,\u201d he said. \u201cThese officers did not have a plan B except pulling out their firearm and barking orders. That\u2019s simply an archaic practice. We teach officers that if you slow things down and communicate using time and distance, you can resolve these situations so everybody can go home safely.\u201d Failing to recognize mental health issues What happened: The interaction began after midnight on July 6 after Massey called 911 to report a possible \u201cprowler\u201d outside her home in Springfield, according to a court document filed by prosecutors. The two deputies arrived and searched around the house before knocking on Massey\u2019s door to speak with her. From the start of their interaction, there are a number of clues suggesting Massey may be experiencing a mental health issue. She has trouble understanding and answering their basic questions, and when they ask if she\u2019s doing alright mentally, she says, \u201cYes, I took my medicine,\u201d according to the body camera footage. The house appears messy in the video, with clothes strewn across her bedroom and the kitchen counter covered in items. In a news conference Monday, Massey\u2019s family and their attorney Ben Crump said she had mental health challenges. What the experts say: A key component of an officer\u2019s interaction with the public is assessing whether they are dealing with someone who could be experiencing a mental health crisis, said Josh Campbell, CNN security correspondent and former federal agent. According to the International Association of Chiefs of Police, which conducts training and recommends best practices for law enforcement, such a situation requires \u201cthe use of special skills, techniques, and abilities to effectively and appropriately resolve the situation, while minimizing violence.\u201d The IACP says, \u201cOfficers are not expected to diagnose mental or emotional conditions, but rather to recognize behaviors that are potentially indicative\u201d of someone in crisis. John Miller, CNN Chief Law Enforcement and Intelligence Analyst, said the officers could have spoken with her further to assess whether she was a danger to herself or others. \u201cThere\u2019s a list of questions that you don\u2019t have to be a mental health professional to ask,\u201d Miller added, \u201csuch as, do you have family looking after you, are you receiving services from the county, do you have a social worker?\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a gap in police training for how to deal with people in crisis, deescalate and use non-lethal tools when situations start to spiral,\u201d he said. Allowing her to get pot of boiling water What happened: When the deputies are inside the home speaking with Massey, they note a pot of boiling water on the lit stove, and Massey gets up and moves to the kitchen to turn off the heat and take the pot off the stove. \u201cWe don\u2019t need a fire while we\u2019re here,\u201d one deputy says. Neither officer has any issue with her going over to get the pot, the video shows. What the experts say: \u201cAgain, this appears a missed opportunity that could have ensured a much different ending,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cIf time allows, officers are trained to observe the totality of a situation and to assess multiple possible outcomes for any public interaction. Allowing someone potentially in crisis near a dangerous object is recipe for a negative outcome.\u201d Miller noted this moment as an issue of controlling the subject and the scene. \u201cThey allow her to walk over to a pot of boiling water,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they believed she constituted some kind of threat, they could have called her over to them, and one of the officers could\u2019ve walked over, turned off the stove and poured the water out.\u201d Using threatening language What happened: When she grabs the pot of boiling water, one deputy steps back \u201caway from your hot steaming water,\u201d he says. \u201cI rebuke you in the name of Jesus,\u201d she says in response. \u201cHuh?\u201d the deputy says. \u201cI rebuke you in the name of Jesus,\u201d she repeats. \u201cYou better f**king not or I swear to God I\u2019ll f**king shoot you in the f**king face,\u201d Grayson says to her. What the experts say: IACP researchers have noted a low tone of voice may be preferable when dealing with someone in mental distress and that making threats \u201cmay create additional fright, stress, and potential aggression,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cWhile an officer is certainly well within their rights to use whatever volume of voice they believe is required to obtain compliance from a subject, law enforcement experts here again draw a distinction for someone in mental crisis,\u201d he said. Miller similarly said \u201ccalmer dialogue\u201d could have been used. Drawing a firearm What happened: After threatening Massey, Grayson immediately draws his firearm and points it at her. She ducks and says, \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d the video shows. What the experts say: \u201cThe gun is the ultimate escalation,\u201d Miller said. \u201cIt cuts you off from other tools and is hard to turn back from, sometimes resulting in these fatalities.\u201d In a court document filed by the state last week, prosecutors noted Grayson could have drawn a Taser located on his duty vest. \u201cHe \u2026 has shown a willingness to use lethal force, despite the availability of non-deadly alternatives, when there is little to no threat to his bodily safety,\u201d prosecutors wrote. Stepping toward her What happened: Both officers yell at her to \u201cdrop the f**king pot,\u201d and Grayson takes three steps toward her as he tries to move around a kitchen counter, the video shows. What the experts say: The deputies could have stepped away from Massey and create distance from the pot of boiling water, the experts said. Campbell said the deputies were at a crossroads at this point. \u201cOfficers across the country are called upon every day to make split-second decisions when faced with a threat \u2013 in this case, a subject holding a pot of scalding water, which certainly could have injured the deputies,\u201d he said. \u201cEffective policing comes down to good judgment in highly stressful situations,\u201d he said. \u201cAlthough being doused with scalding water could warrant the use of deadly force by an officer to stop a threat, in this video we certainly don\u2019t see officers attempting alternative options, such as moving away and creating distance between themselves and Massey.\u201d Miller said, \u201cWhen she comes across with the pot, rather than extend the distance between her and them, they close in giving excited commands and raised voices.\u201d In the state\u2019s court filing, prosecutors said a \u201cuse-of-force\u201d expert had reviewed the body-camera footage and concluded the use of deadly force was not justified. \u201c(The expert) likened the scenario to an officer intentionally and unnecessarily putting himself in front of a moving vehicle and then justifying use of force because of fear of being struck,\u201d the prosecutors wrote. Failing to provide medical care What happened: After the shooting, Grayson failed to provide any medical care for Massey and was dismissive of efforts to do so, the video shows. Grayson\u2019s partner says he\u2019s going to get a medical kit to help, but Grayson responds, \u201cNah, she\u2019s done. You can go get it but that\u2019s a headshot.\u201d \u201cLet her f**king just \u2013 there\u2019s nothing we can do man,\u201d he says. After about two minutes, his partner grabs a towel and leans down to try to help Massey, and he notes \u201cshe\u2019s still gasping a bit.\u201d Grayson later goes to his vehicle to get his own medical supplies, and when he gets back to the house, he is told there\u2019s nothing he can do for her. \u201cAlright, I\u2019m not even gonna waste my med stuff then,\u201d Grayson says. What the experts say: It\u2019s not clear whether faster medical aid might have helped Massey \u2013 her condition after the shooting is heavily blurred in the video \u2013 but the deputy\u2019s actions and words show a lack of compassion, experts said. \u201cIt may be perplexing to some readers, but an officer who employs deadly force actually has an obligation to immediately shift to rendering aid if the subject of their force no longer poses a threat,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cAlthough we don\u2019t see the nature of Massey\u2019s injuries in the blurred video, officers waited over two minutes before moving in to apply pressure on her bullet wounds.\u201d Miller said: \u201cWhile he does not interfere with his partner\u2019s effort to follow procedure and render medical aid, Grayson discourages it and is dismissive of it, which may have not made any difference medically but is an indicator of a passive contempt for procedure and a lack of compassion.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/23/us/sonya-massey-police-shooting-what-went-wrong/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_07_22_us_sonya-massey-police-shooting", "text": "Body-camera footage showing the fatal police shooting of Sonya Massey, a 36-year-old Black woman who had called 911 for help, was released Monday in a case that has led to murder charges against a deputy. The 36-minute video released via the Illinois State Police includes body-camera footage from each of the two Sangamon County sheriff\u2019s deputies who responded to Massey\u2019s house after midnight on July 6 after Massey called 911 to report a possible \u201cprowler\u201d at her home in Springfield, according to a court document filed by prosecutors. In the footage, deputy Sean Grayson and another deputy speak calmly with Massey in her home when she goes to the stove to turn off a pot of boiling water. She then picks up the pot and the other deputy steps back, \u201caway from your hot steaming water,\u201d he says. \u201cI rebuke you in the name of Jesus,\u201d she says in response. \u201cHuh?\u201d the deputy says. \u201cI rebuke you in the name of Jesus,\u201d she repeats. \u201cYou better f**king not or I swear to God I\u2019ll f**king shoot you in the f**king face,\u201d Grayson says. He then draws his firearm and points it at her, and she ducks and says, \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d while lifting the pot, the video shows. \u201cDrop the f**king pot!\u201d both deputies yell. Three shots are heard. After a few seconds of silence, one deputy says \u201cshots fired\u201d and calls for emergency medical services. \u201cDude, I\u2019m not taking f**king boiling water to the f**king head. And look, it came right to our feet, too,\u201d Grayson says. Minutes after the shooting, Grayson speaks to another law enforcement figure. \u201cShe had boiling water and came at me with boiling water,\u201d he says in the video. \u201cShe said she was going to rebuke me in the name of Jesus and came at (me) with boiling water.\u201d CNN has sought comment from Grayson\u2019s attorney. The release of the video comes about two weeks after the fatal shooting and just days after Grayson was charged in her death. Grayson, 30, was indicted by a grand jury last week on three counts of first-degree murder and one count each of aggravated battery with a firearm and official misconduct. He has entered a not guilty plea and was denied pretrial release, according to court records. Massey is one of a number of Black women who have been killed by police in their own homes in recent years, including Breonna Taylor and Atatiana Jefferson. In a news conference Monday afternoon, civil rights attorney Ben Crump, who represents Massey\u2019s family, connected her death to other cases of police violence against Black people across the US. \u201cUntil we get justice for Sonya Massey, we rebuke this discriminatory criminal justice system in the name of Jesus,\u201d he said. Video shows lead-up and aftermath Grayson did not activate his body camera until after he fatally shot Massey, according to charging documents. The other deputy had activated his body camera when he first arrived at the scene, the documents state. According to footage from the other deputy\u2019s body camera, the incident began with the deputies walking around Massey\u2019s yard and finding a vehicle with broken windows. They then knock on the door and speak with her, and she struggles to understand and answer some questions about the vehicle and about herself. As they speak in her living room, the deputies note the pot on the lit stove and one says, \u201cwe don\u2019t need a fire while we\u2019re here.\u201d Massey gets up and turns off the stove and the shooting then follows. Immediately after the shooting, the video records Grayson telling his partner Massey would not need medical help. The other deputy says he\u2019s going to get a medical kit to help, but Grayson responds, \u201cNah, she\u2019s done. You can go get it but that\u2019s a headshot.\u201d Grayson later goes to his vehicle to get his own medical supplies. When he gets back to the house, he asks if there\u2019s anything he can do, but is told no. \u201cAll right, I\u2019m not even gonna waste my med stuff then,\u201d Grayson says. Next, Grayson leaves the house and speaks to a group of law enforcement officers outside. \u201cYeah I\u2019m good, this f**king b*tch is crazy,\u201d he says, according to the footage. In the news conference Monday, along with members of her family, Crump said Massey had mental health challenges but was not aggressive toward the deputies. \u201cShe needed a helping hand,\u201d he said. \u201cShe didn\u2019t need a bullet to the face.\u201d Massey\u2019s father, James Wilburn, said he initially received conflicting information from law enforcement. \u201cI was under the impression that a prowler had broken in and killed my baby. Never did they say that it was a deputy-involved shooting until my brother read it on the internet,\u201d Wilburn said at the news conference. \u201cWe were led to believe that the intruder \u2013 or someone from the neighborhood \u2013 may have killed her.\u00a0We were absolutely shocked to find out that it was a deputy who shot her,\u201d Wilburn told CNN\u2019s Laura Coates on Monday night. \u201cYou\u2019re used to having \u2018the talk\u2019 with boys, but now I guess we have to talk to our girls about \u2026 their interactions with the police,\u201d Wilburn said. Wilburn said that his daughter\u2019s death had left him heartbroken. \u201cSonya was a daddy\u2019s girl. She never ended a conversation \u2013 whether by text or telephone or in person \u2013 without saying, \u2018Daddy, I love you.\u2019 And that\u2019s the last message I have from my daughter that\u2019s saved on my voicemail, was \u2018Daddy, I love you\u2019,\u201d he said. Crump told Laura Coates that he expected the release of the video showing the \u201cheinous killing of this innocent woman\u201d to galvanize the community. \u201cIt\u2019s so senseless. I mean, it is disturbing. This video is reminiscent in the last presidential cycle in 2020 when the George Floyd video, you know,\u00a0encouraged our community to act. \u201cAnd in this 2024 election I believe this Sonya Massey video is going to encourage our community to act \u2013 because Sonya Massey deserved better than this,\u201d Crump said. Officials criticize deputy\u2019s actions Since the shooting, local and state officials have criticized the deputy\u2019s actions as an unjustified use of deadly force. A review of the Illinois State Police investigation into the shooting \u201cdoes not support a finding that \u2026 Grayson was justified in his use of deadly force,\u201d the state\u2019s attorney for the county, John Milhiser, said in a July 17 news release. In a court document filed by the state last week, prosecutors said a \u201cuse-of-force\u201d expert had reviewed the body-camera footage and concluded the use of deadly force was not justified. \u201c(The expert) likened the scenario to an officer intentionally and unnecessarily putting himself in front of a moving vehicle and then justifying use of force because of fear of being struck,\u201d the prosecutors wrote. The sheriff\u2019s office said it has fired Grayson. \u201cIt is clear that the deputy did not act as trained or in accordance with our standards,\u201d the office said. CNN experts offered similar analysis. \u201cEffective policing comes down to good judgment\u00a0in highly stressful situations,\u201d said Josh Campbell, CNN security correspondent and former federal agent. \u201cAlthough being doused with scalding water could warrant the use of deadly force by an officer to stop a threat, in this video we certainly don\u2019t see officers attempting alternative options, such as moving away and creating distance between themselves and Massey.\u201d \u201cThere were a number of ways to avoid this starting with better tactics from the outset,\u201d said CNN Chief Law Enforcement and Intelligence Analyst John Miller, \u201cbut even if you forgive that and limit the observations to the last few seconds, there were still options of a calmer dialogue, more distance between the subject and them, a taser rather than a firearm.\u201d Grayson had worked at six different law enforcement agencies in Illinois since 2020, according to the Illinois Law Enforcement Training and Standards Board. He began working part-time at the Pawnee Police Department in August 2020, then moved to the Kincaid and Virden police departments, before taking up full-time work with the Auburn Police Department then the Logan County Sheriff\u2019s Office and \u2013 in May 2023 \u2013 Sangamon County. It is unclear why Grayson changed jobs so frequently and CNN has reached out to the other law enforcement agencies for more information. The training and standards board records show his Law Enforcement Certification has since been suspended. A petition calling for an investigation into why Sangamon County hired Grayson was circulated at a march and barbecue in Springfield on Monday night, CNN affiliate WICS reported. Several hundred people attended the gathering in honor of Massey, WICS said. \u201cIt was very powerful just seeing all of the people come out from our community. Different ages, different races, different sexual orientations all coming together for one cause, which is to get justice for Sonya Massey,\u201d organizer Tiara Standage told WICS. President Joe Biden said in a statement Monday that Massey\u2019s family \u201cdeserves justice.\u201d \u201cI am heartbroken for her children and her entire family as they face this unthinkable and senseless loss. Jill and I mourn with the rest of the country and our prayers are with Sonya\u2019s family, loved ones, and community during this devastating time,\u201d Biden said in a written statement. \u201cI commend the swift actions that were taken by the Springfield state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office. While we wait for the case to be prosecuted, let us pray to comfort the grieving. Congress must pass the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act now. Our fundamental commitment to justice is at stake,\u201d the president added. Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul issued a statement Monday saying the footage was \u201chorrific\u201d and offering his sympathy to Massey\u2019s family. \u201cAs the community reacts to the release of the footage, I urge calm as this matter works its way through the criminal justice system,\u201d he said. \u201cIn Illinois we have made sure that the law mandates independent investigations after officer involved shootings. In this matter it appears that the investigation by the Illinois State Police and the subsequent referral to the Sangamon County state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office have complied with the letter and spirit of the law by providing the appropriate transparency and moving toward accountability,\u201d Raoul added.

{"id": "2024_07_23_politics_gaza-ceasefire-prospects-netanyahu-congress", "text": "US and Israeli officials are voicing increased optimism about the prospects of a ceasefire and hostage deal being agreed to end the war in Gaza as the loved ones of hostages being held by Hamas say that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu must take the deal on offer. Efforts to secure an agreement have been ongoing for months and picked up renewed momentum in late May after US President Joe Biden laid out the details of a plan to bring home the hostages and eventually bring about an end to the war. Now, as the Israeli Prime Minister prepares to deliver a high-stakes speech to Congress on Wednesday\u00a0and meet with Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris on Thursday, US officials claim a final deal is within reach. For the families of the hostages held more than nine months in Gaza, there is no time to wait. On Monday, Biden said he believed the different parties were on the \u201cverge of being able to\u201d secure a deal to bring home the hostages and end the war. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Friday that they are\u00a0\u201cinside the 10-yard line and driving toward the goal line in getting an agreement that would produce a ceasefire, get the hostages home, and put us on a better track to trying to build lasting peace and stability.\u201d US officials insist that Israel and Hamas have both agreed to the broad framework of a deal, but specifics and crucial technicalities need to be hammered out. Mediators from the US, Egypt and Qatar have been leading efforts to finalize those details. A source familiar with the negotiations told CNN Tuesday that an Israeli delegation that was expected to leave on Thursday to transmit the latest Israeli response to the mediators is likely to delay its trip until at least Friday as a result of Netanyahu\u2019s meeting with Biden being postponed until Thursday afternoon. The Israeli prime minister wants to meet with Biden before the Israeli delegation formally transmits its response to the mediators, the source said. The Israeli response is expected to include Netanyahu\u2019s eleventh-hour demands regarding barring armed men from northern Gaza and Israeli control of the Philadelphi corridor \u2013 key sticking points in the negotiations. If Hamas agrees to those demands, a deal is likely to follow. \u201cIf Hamas will say yes, there will be a deal,\u201d the source said. The latest Israeli response will also coincide with the Knesset, Israel\u2019s parliament, going into recess next week. That will make it harder for any right-wing opponents of the deal to move to collapse the government. US officials have been sensitive to the Knesset recess as they remain convinced that politics are at play for Netanyahu back in Israel. Still, as Israel prepares to transmit its response, it has become increasingly clear to multiple parties involved that clinching a ceasefire now depends on the Israeli prime minister and his government. \u201cIt\u2019s really Israel\u2019s decision,\u201d an official familiar with the talks told CNN. There\u2019s real\u00a0concern\u00a0among the families of Israeli hostages as to whether Netanyahu is willing to make a deal to end the brutal war, after numerous false dawns suggesting a ceasefire was close. Netanyahu \u2018has to take it\u2019 Aviva Siegel, a former hostage whose husband, Keith, is still a hostage, told CNN Tuesday that Netanyahu \u201chas to take it and not continue the war.\u201d \u201cHe needs to stop the war for kids to come home and the hostages to come home. They are much more important than continuing the war. They\u2019ve suffered. I\u2019ve been there. I know what the situation is. I know what they\u2019re going through,\u201d said Siegel, who was freed after 51 days in Hamas captivity. There are believed to be 116 people who were abducted during the October 7 Hamas attack remaining in Gaza \u2013 44 of them are believed to be deceased. The families said ahead of\u00a0Netanyahu\u2019s\u00a0address\u00a0to Congress\u00a0that they expect to hear the Israeli prime minister tell Congress that he has agreed to a deal \u2013 anything less, they said, is a failure. The families praised Biden\u2019s leadership on the efforts to bring their loved one\u2019s home but now that the US president has announced he will not seek reelection, they are urging him to ratchet up the pressure to finish the deal \u2013 something they say could be a key part of his legacy. The families are expected to meet with Biden and with Netanyahu on Thursday. \u201cNot only should you not all collectively take your foot off the gas but put it on even harder and make sure that part of your legacy, Mr. President, is that you get the credit for saving the lives of as many of these hostages as possible,\u201d said Jon Polin, the father of Hersh Goldberg-Polin. Indeed, the conflict in the Middle East has been a consuming issue for the US president since the October 7 attack. Whether it comes to an end before Biden\u2019s first term will be consequential for his predecessor \u2013 whether that is Donald Trump, or possibly Harris, whom Biden has endorsed for the Democratic nomination. When Harris meets with Netanyahu at the White House this week, she plans to convey to the Israeli leader that it is time for the war to end, a Harris aide said. Many Israelis, including family members of hostages, are convinced Netanyahu doesn\u2019t want a deal, instead preferring to extend the war and thereby his grip on power. \u201cWe expect from our prime minister to cease all stalling, to cease torpedoing any hope for a negotiated return of hostages and a ceasefire in Gaza to stop the suffering of the people of Gaza,\u201d said Jonathan Dekel-Chen, the father of Sagui Dekel-Chen. \u201cWe expect to hear him declare that Israel is going to sign this imperfect, imperfect agreement with Satan, meaning Hamas. But it is a national necessity and anything less than that would be a total failure of his leadership.\u201d Netanyahu, who met on Monday in Washington with families of hostages, said his Israeli government is \u201cdetermined to return everyone.\u201d \u201cThe conditions to bring them back are ripe, for the simple reason that we are putting very strong pressure on Hamas. We are seeing a certain change, and I think this change will continue to grow,\u201d the Israeli prime minister said. However, Daniel Neutra, whose brother Omer is being held hostage, said that \u201cthe urgency of the matter did not seem to resonate with\u201d Netanyahu at Monday night\u2019s meeting. \u2018Remaining issues\u2019 On Monday, US State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said that they \u201chave significantly narrowed the disagreements between the parties,\u201d but there are \u201ca few remaining issues that need to be resolved.\u201d \u201cWe continue discussions with the other mediators, and with the Government of Israel to try to reach resolution, but we don\u2019t have that yet, and I don\u2019t have any kind of forecast about when we might come to one,\u201d Miller said. According to an official from a mediating country, the latest proposal from Hamas earlier this month \u201cwas very close\u201d to the Israeli position from late May so when Hamas responded, it was believed that Israel\u2019s reaction \u201cwould be positive and ready to move forward\u201d with technical teams dispatched to iron out the final details. Negotiators are currently awaiting a response from Israel to a Hamas document received on July 3, according to that official, and recent Israeli responses have been unexpected and unclear, the official said, pointing to Israel\u2019s reneging on a previous, critical position about allowing the unrestricted return of Palestinians to northern Gaza during a pause in the fighting. There\u2019s also significant debate around the Philadelphi corridor and Rafah border crossing, both located between Egypt and Gaza. Netanyahu has argued Israel troops will not withdraw from the nine-mile-long Philadelphi corridor while Hamas has insisted on a full eventual Israeli withdrawal from Gaza,\u00a0and their response, according to a source familiar, is expected to stick to that demand. A central sticking point has been whether a first pause in the fighting would flow seamlessly into a permanent ceasefire, something Israel has rejected. The Biden framework \u2013 and a UN resolution that followed \u2013 says the first phase will continue as long discussions do over a second phase. That, theoretically, could mean talks could break down and fighting resumes. Meanwhile, the situation on the ground in Gaza remains dire and US officials involved in the humanitarian and security efforts have grown increasingly frustrated by Israeli aggression in recent weeks. There remains no effective communication between the Israel Defense Forces and humanitarian groups, and just in the last week a UN convoy was shot at by the IDF. US officials believe it is possible that Israelis are seeking to put maximum pressure on Hamas ahead of a deal. If a first phase of the ceasefire is launched, Hamas is expected to release just over 30 hostages in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails. Biden\u2019s natioanl security advisor Jake\u00a0Sullivan acknowledged on Friday that the exact numbers and type of Palestinian prisoners to be released need to be finalized. There is still discussion around the number of vetoes Israel would have over Palestinian prisoners Hamas wants released, with an expectation that Israel would oppose more hardened prisoners serving longer \u2013 or life \u2013 sentences, according to details provided by the official from a mediating country, who was granted anonymity to discuss the sensitive negotiations. As negotiations on the deal continue, there are also ongoing discussions about security, humanitarian aid, and governance once an agreement is put into place. Those discussions will continue with Netanyahu this week. US and Egyptian officials have begun preparing the flood of humanitarian aid that would enter Gaza if a ceasefire deal goes into effect. Egypt has worked to pre-position nearly 200,000 metric tons of supplies in the northern Egyptian city of el-Arish, one official familiar with the matter said, and talks to prepare for the enormous logistical effort have intensified in the last week. \u201cWhat we can\u2019t have is an agreement that\u2019s followed by some kind of void that will either be filled, if it\u2019s there, by Hamas coming back, which is unacceptable; by Israel prolonging its occupation, which they say they don\u2019t want to do and is unacceptable; or just having a vacuum that\u2019s filled by lawlessness, that\u2019s filled by chaos, which we see in so many parts of Gaza right now, which is also inimical to actually helping people who desperately need it,\u201d Blinken said Friday. \u201cSo making sure that we have a plan in place, which we\u2019ve been working on also every single day \u2013 with Arab partners, with Israel, with many others for governance, for security, for humanitarian assistance, for reconstruction \u2013 that\u2019s critical.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/23/politics/gaza-ceasefire-prospects-netanyahu-congress/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_07_20_us_texas-houston-power-outage", "text": "Theodore Doyle, an 81-year-old retired manager with the former US Customs Service, was waking up in his hot and muggy northeast Houston apartment in a bed soaked in sweat. Doyle ultimately checked into a $98-a-night hotel room late Tuesday, after enduring a compounding crisis of extreme heat and no power for more than a week with about 200 other seniors at an independent living facility in the Kingwood community. \u201cThere\u2019s no air circulating. It\u2019s just stifling and it\u2019s sort of tough to breathe,\u201d he told CNN before returning to his apartment when power was restored Thursday afternoon. \u201cI just couldn\u2019t take it anymore.\u201d During the outage, a generator powered one elevator and a large, air-conditioned lounge at the complex \u2013 a lifeline for many who are dependent on electric wheelchairs and scooters to get around and oxygen machines for pulmonary disease. At times, as many as 40 residents sought refuge in the lounge. Others remained in their stifling apartments. Some stayed with relatives. \u201cA friend just turned 95 about a month ago,\u201d Doyle said. \u201cAnother friend of mine is over 90 and quite a few of us are all over 80. It\u2019s tough. You\u2019re not as spry as you used to be.\u201d By Sunday afternoon, about 1,200 customers of Houston\u2019s main utility, CenterPoint Energy, were without power, according to PowerOutage.us. It\u2019s unclear if those customers have been without power since Beryl hit the Golf Coast July 8 as a hurricane, leaving more than 2 million customers in the dark, mostly in the Houston area. More than 135,000 CenterPoint customers had no power on Monday night. The embattled utility said in a statement that customers without power were \u201cpredominantly isolated instances,\u201d where homes or equipment sustained severe damage from the storm. CenterPoint, which has 2.8 million customers in the Houston area, said some current outages could be related to thunderstorms Saturday morning. \u201cFor safety reasons, our crews pause their work when there is lightning,\u201d the statement said. At least 14 Houston-area deaths were confirmed to be hurricane-related, including seven people \u2013 ranging in age from 50 to 110 \u2013 who died from \u201cheat exposure due to power loss,\u201d according to the Harris County Institute of Forensic Sciences. Overall, more than 20 deaths in Harris and nearby counties were attributed to the storm, according to the Houston Chronicle and other local media outlets. Older people were especially vulnerable and, authorities warned, the number of fatalities could grow. For more than a week, some residents of the nation\u2019s fourth largest city were left to sleep in their cars, shuffle perilously with canes and walkers across dark rooms and corridors, and watch food and medications spoil and critical medical equipment become inoperable. At times, they cried in desperation after discovering the bodies of neighbors who succumbed to the heat following a comparatively mild Category 1 hurricane. \u201cIt is unimaginable this is happening in 2024,\u201d Denise Furlough, who delivered food, batteries and ice to her 86-year-old father during the more than a week without power in his Almeda Plaza home, told CNN Saturday. \u201cI was just frightened I might go over there and he wouldn\u2019t be alive.\u201d \u2018She didn\u2019t have to die\u2019 In Houston\u2019s Museum District on Tuesday, Pat Baker arrived at a condo complex to check on a neighbor with health problems who rented out her daughter\u2019s apartment. The neighbor didn\u2019t answer. \u201cI unlocked the door and found her,\u201d Baker, fighting back tears, told CNN affiliate KHOU. \u201cYou know, it\u2019s just been hot and miserable and I\u2019m just sick of this. I\u2019m just sick of it.\u201d Power was restored at the condo complex later that afternoon after the body was removed from the apartment, the station reported. The latest name on the Harris County list of confirmed Beryl-related deaths was Christine Davis, who had turned 110 in May, according to the 110 Club, a site about super-centenarians. She died Tuesday at Memorial Hermann Hospital Northeast from hyperthermia caused by \u201cenvironmental heat exposure due to power outage,\u201d according to the Harris County Institute of Forensic Sciences. Another confirmed storm victim was Pamela Jarrett, 64, who died of hyperthermia on July 11, days after the hurricane, in her home in Spring, Texas, just north of Houston. Relatives told CNN affiliate KTRK on Wednesday that Jarrett relied on a wheelchair and feeding tube. \u201cIt could have been avoided, and she didn\u2019t have to die,\u201d said her sister Janet, who took care of her and struggled to keep the feeding device charged during the outage. She said she tried to keep Jarrett cool with ice and water until she became unresponsive. \u201cAs much as I tried to save her,\u201d Janet Jarrett told the station, \u201cI couldn\u2019t save her.\u201d Power was restored in the Jarrett home on Tuesday. Utility pledges \u2018thorough review\u2019 In the city of Humble, about 20 miles north of Houston, Christina Bourgeois, her three children \u2013 ages 5 through 9 \u2013 and their dog Mimosa spent the night after the storm in her Dodge Journey outside their home. She kept the Dodge on, the air conditioner running because of the heat. \u201cI slept in the driver\u2019s seat,\u201d she told CNN Friday. \u201cIt was awful. You know, my younger son, I had to get up and take him inside to use the restroom.\u201d The children later stayed with relatives and Bourgeois, 32, spent every night in the car until power was restored on Wednesday. \u201cI would wake up every two or three hours or so to turn the air on and then turn it off,\u201d she said of the nights she spent alone in the Dodge.  \u201cI hadn\u2019t slept. I was exhausted. I was starting to swell. I had bags under my eyes. Any little noise would wake me up because I have the windows down, you know \u2026 Any kind of rustle of the leaves or, you know, even cars passing by, I would just wake up.\u201d Texas Gov. Greg Abbott last Sunday threatened executive action if CenterPoint Energy did not address concerns over the prolonged outage. And the Public Utilities Commission of Texas said it would investigate the company\u2019s response, according to Chairman Thomas Gleason. He told reporters Monday the utility\u2019s ability to maintain its infrastructure and its communication with customers has been called into question. CenterPoint Energy told CNN in a statement it was \u201ccommitted to doing a thorough review of our Hurricane Beryl response.\u201d \u201cWe are engaging with community leaders, elected officials, local clergy leadership and others across the area to learn about how we can be more responsive to their needs and concerns,\u201d the statement said. Doyle, before he returned to his apartment on Thursday, said he had about $150 worth of food on his refrigerator that went bad. He said he was unsure about the condition of some insulin he had left behind. He blamed the utility company for leaving thousands of Houstonians marooned in a broiling nightmare. \u201cYou have no idea how frustrating this is,\u201d he said. \u201cWe should not be subjected to this.\u201d Furlough, whose father, Julius Gordon, is a cancer survivor and has heart disease, said he \u2013 like many Houston residents \u2013 felt hopeless and abandoned until power to his home was restored on Tuesday. Her father told CNN, \u201cYou\u2019re just there. You just vegetate.\u201d CNN\u2019s Amy Simonson and Rebekah Riess contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/20/us/texas-houston-power-outage/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_07_23_politics_trump-campaign-fec-complaint-block-biden-harris-funds", "text": "The Trump campaign on Tuesday filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission arguing money raised for President Joe Biden\u2019s reelection bid cannot be transferred to Vice President Kamala Harris\u2019 presidential campaign. The complaint was filed by the Trump campaign\u2019s general counsel David Warrington and argues transferring the funds would amount to \u201clittle more than a thinly veiled $91.5 million excessive contribution from one presidential candidate to another.\u201d \u201cKamala Harris is seeking to perpetrate a $91.5 million dollar heist of Joe Biden\u2019s leftover campaign cash \u2014 a brazen money grab that would constitute the single largest excessive contribution and biggest violation in the history of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, as amended,\u201d\u00a0the complaint, a copy of which was obtained by CNN, states. The complaint is against Biden, Harris, the Biden campaign (which is now the Harris campaign) and campaign treasurer Keana Spencer for allegedly \u201cflagrantly violating the Act by making and receiving an excessive contribution of nearly one hundred million dollars, and for filing fraudulent forms with the Commission purporting to repurpose one candidate\u2019s principal campaign committee for the use of another candidate.\u201d Harris campaign spokesperson Charles Kretchmer Lutvak responded to the FEC complaint in a statement Tuesday, saying, \u201cRepublicans may be jealous that Democrats are energized to defeat Donald Trump and his MAGA allies, but baseless legal claims \u2013 like the ones they\u2019ve made for years to try to suppress votes and steal elections \u2013 will only distract them while we sign up volunteers, talk to voters, and win this election.\u201d The statement also cited the campaign\u2019s fundraising efforts so far, \u201craising $100 million in our first 36 hours and signing up 58,000 volunteers.\u201d It\u2019s unlikely that the commission would take any action until well after Election Day, given its slow pace of resolving enforcement questions. \u201cI don\u2019t think most campaign finance lawyers believe that this is a best reading of the law,\u201d Rick Hasen, an election law expert at UCLA\u2019s law school, told CNN on Tuesday of the Trump campaign\u2019s argument. But, he added, \u201cthat doesn\u2019t mean it can\u2019t get tied up in FEC proceedings for years.\u201d An FEC spokesperson declined to comment, citing the agency\u2019s policy on not discussing enforcement matters. Veteran Republican election lawyer Charlie Spies, who briefly served as the RNC\u2019s general counsel earlier this year, argued recently that the Biden-Harris team must be formally nominated by their party before any money could be shifted. \u201cIf President Biden is committed to passing the torch to his vice president, and wants to be able to seed her campaign with the current Biden for President campaign war chest, he\u2019ll first have to become his party\u2019s legal nominee,\u201d Spies wrote in an\u00a0op-ed\u00a0in The Wall Street Journal before Biden\u2019s exit from the race. But other campaign finance experts disagree. And Federal Election Commissioner Dara\u00a0Lindenbaum, a Democrat viewed as a swing vote on the evenly divided commission, has said Harris could access what Biden raised through the campaign committee because it is registered for both the president and vice president. Lindenbaum\u00a0wrote on X, \u201cIf Kamala Harris becomes the Democratic Party nominee, she gets access to the Joe Biden campaign funds.\u201d This story has been updated with additional reporting.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/23/politics/trump-campaign-fec-complaint-block-biden-harris-funds/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_07_21_us_george-washington-tent-fragment-goodwill", "text": "As a collector of artifacts, Richard \u201cDana\u201d Moore makes a habit of scrolling through Goodwill\u2019s online thrift store, and one day in 2022, the history buff came across an item that piqued his interest.  A post in the historical documents section featured the image of a framed item purporting to contain a fragment of George Washington\u2019s tent. It came with a written note saying the tent had been displayed at an exposition commemorating the 300th anniversary of the founding of Jamestown in the Virginia Colony. \u201cI was like, \u2018This can\u2019t be.\u2019 So I was a little bit astonished,\u201d Moore told CNN. Moore was skeptical of the posting so he initially held off on bidding for two weeks. \u201cThere are a lot of fakes out there,\u201d he added. \u201cThere\u2019s always something that\u2019s not real, that looks to be real.\u201d Moore said he took a closer look at the torn note and determined it looked like it had aged over the years along with the fragment, which is 4 inches wide and over 5 inches long. \u201cI jumped in with both feet. I said, \u2018Hell with it.\u2019 I\u2019m\u00a0gonna\u00a0bid on it,\u201d he said. Moore told CNN that he bid a little over $1,700 on the artifact and won. He initially didn\u2019t tell his wife, Susan Bowen, and hid it in their home. Now, he said, she agrees that he hit it out of the park: The artifact was confirmed to be a piece of Washington\u2019s dining tent, and Moore estimates it to be worth tens of thousands of dollars. The artifact goes on display at a museum Moore contacted the Museum of the American Revolution in Philadelphia in February last year. He knew the museum held Washington\u2019s sleeping and office tent.  Matthew\u00a0Skic, curator of exhibitions, told CNN the museum was excited but first needed to confirm the fragment was actually a piece of one of Washington\u2019s war tents. Moore agreed to send the artifact to the museum for a conservator to look at the weave of the fabric. \u201cWhat\u2019s really fascinating about this particular fragment is it retains some of the red wool trim on the edge of it, and that was telling us that this was likely cut away from the edge of the roof of the dining marquee,\u201d\u00a0Skic\u00a0said. While the museum is still trying to determine which gap the fragment might fill, its binding and hand-stitched linen point to it being the real thing. Also, the note that it came with is appropriate for the time period. Once the museum confirmed the fabric\u2019s authenticity they were excited to feature it alongside the rest of the planned exhibit around Washington\u2019s sleeping and office war tent. \u201cThis one is a lot of fun because it came from an unlikely spot,\u201d Skic said. \u201cYou don\u2019t expect to find these kinds of historical treasures in a place like that, although this is not the first historical treasure that has come up via Goodwill.\u201d The fragment, on loan from Moore, was put on display for public view in February of this year as part of the museum\u2019s exhibit Witness to Revolution: The Unlikely Travels of Washington\u2019s Tent. The fragment will stay in the museum until January 5, 2025, and then it will be returned to Moore. The dining tent that Moore\u2019s fragment belongs to is now being held at the Smithsonian. It is not on display for public view. Symbols of Washington\u2019s leadership George Washington\u2019s tents, as explained by the museum, have nearly 250 years of history. The tents, used during the Revolutionary War, held his sleeping and office quarters where he led meetings, planned strategies and wrote letters. Over the years, the tents became a symbol of Washington\u2019s leadership and the founding of the country following the Revolution. The fragment was likely cut off the dining tent by a man named John Burns, who saw the tent on display in Norfolk, Virginia, at the exposition commemorating the founding of Jamestown. The tent itself was on loan from Mary Custis Lee, the great-granddaughter of Washington\u2019s wife, Martha. Lee\u2019s father, George Washington Parke Custis, later owned the Revolutionary War tents and frequently set them up to host events. Two hundred years ago, he started cutting away pieces of George Washington\u2019s tents as souvenirs. \u201cGeorge Washington Parke Custis was seeing the tent as a way to connect people to the past. And there might have been a similar mindset in 1907 when this, this fragment of the dining marquee, was cut,\u201d Skic said. There are fragments known to have been cut by Parke Custis. But Skic said there is still more to be learned from this fragment, especially about who Burns, the note\u2019s author, might be. Currently, Moore is the only\u00a0known private owner of a piece of Washington\u2019s tent. All of the others are in the Smithsonian and other museums. Moore said knowing he bought the fragment gives him chills at night. It isn\u2019t about the money or recognition for him. It\u2019s about \u201cbreaking away from British rule and the beginnings of our country.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s the history behind it. Can you imagine the information and the things that were said within that tent?\u201d Moore asked rhetorically. Moore and his wife visited the museum earlier this month and said they were filled with emotion at the sight of the artifact.  \u201cI never got chills like that in my entire life,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were both over the moon. We still can\u2019t believe it.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/21/us/george-washington-tent-fragment-goodwill/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_07_23_business_inflation-cost-of-living-cnn-poll", "text": "Many Americans regularly worry they won\u2019t be able to make ends meet. Nearly four in ten (39%) of US adults say they worry most or all of the time that their family\u2019s income won\u2019t be enough to meet expenses, according to a new CNN poll. That\u2019s up from 28% who expressed those concerns in December 2021, and it\u2019s similar to the numbers seen during the Great Recession (37%). To cope, significant shares of\u00a0Americans said they are adding side jobs, cutting down on driving and putting more expenses on credit cards. Even higher percentages of Latino (52%) and Black (46%) Americans said they\u2019re worried most or all of the time about making ends meet, according to the poll. More than half (55%) of those making less than $50,000 a year similarly worry about having enough money to meet expenses. The findings underscore how, despite national statistics that show unemployment is low and inflation is cooling, millions of Americans are hurting from years of rising prices. \u201cThe grocery store is just outrageous right now. But it\u2019s not just that. Everything has gone up. Clothing. My insurance,\u201d said Angela Russell, an Ohio resident who works as a program analyst at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Russell, who has two adult children and three grandkids, said she recently moved out of her rental home in Cincinnati in favor of one in a rural area where the rent is cheaper. Two-thirds of Americans (65%) say\u00a0in\u00a0an open-ended question that expenses and the cost of living are the biggest economic problem facing their family today. That\u2019s down from 75% in the summer of 2022 but well ahead of the 43% who mentioned an issue related to expenses in the summer of 2021. The typical household is spending $925 more a month to purchase the same goods and services as three years ago, according to Moody\u2019s Analytics. \u201cThe pressure is real. Everything is so much more expensive than it was four years ago. It\u2019s astronomical what you\u2019re paying,\u201d said Russell. Inflation is down. Prices aren\u2019t The rate of inflation has eased sharply: Consumer prices increased by 3% year-over-year in July, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That\u2019s a dramatic improvement from the peak of 9% in June 2022 when gas prices spiked above $5 a gallon. Yet many Americans are not really feeling that improvement. Prices are still higher than they were last year \u2013 they\u2019re just rising at a slower pace. And consumers are still trying to catch up to the price spikes of 2022 and 2023. \u201cWe can talk all day about how inflation is moderating but the cumulative impact of several years\u2019 worth of inflation has done a number on household budgets,\u201d said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate. \u201cThe view from 35,000 feet is unemployment is low, the economy is growing and people are spending money. The reality on the ground is moderating inflation doesn\u2019t mean prices are coming down, just that they aren\u2019t going up as fast.\u201d Some good news: Paychecks have also grown over the past three years. Lately, they\u2019ve been growing faster than prices, reversing a years-long troubling trend. Median household incomes are $1,110 bigger than three years ago, according to Moody\u2019s Analytics. That outpaces the $925 more that people are spending for the same goods and services. Side hustles and spending less But not everyone is making more money. \u201cMany have seen their buying power eroded. Even if your income has kept up with prices, you\u2019re just treading water,\u201d said McBride. To get by, many people are being forced to find additional income. The CNN poll showed that 35% of adults say they\u2019ve recently had to take on extra work to make ends meet. Even higher percentages of Latinos (52%), Black Americans (44%) and those under the age of 45 (47%) say they\u2019ve taken extra work. As a result of current economic conditions, most Americans say they\u2019ve had to cut back on spending on extras and entertainment (69%) and changed their grocery buying (68%), according to the CNN poll. Others say they\u2019ve cut back on driving (41%) and they are taking on credit card debt to afford necessities (37%). The share of Americans who\u2019ve cut back on driving is down from 54% in spring 2022, but the shares cutting back on discretionary spending and watching their grocery budgets have seen little downward change over the past two years. Russell, the Ohio woman who works at the CDC, said her pay is at the mercy of the federal budget \u2013 and doesn\u2019t include the bonuses or stock options that people working in other industries rely on. \u201cLiterally everything seems like it\u2019s outpacing what I earn,\u201d she said. Russell has shifted her spending to focus on essentials by canceling most of her streaming services, going to the movies less often and buying candy at Walmart instead of at the movie theater when she does go. \u201cI\u2019ve had to cut back on all the fun things I like to do. I used to go to the bookstore or get magazines. Now, I get books from the library,\u201d she said. The CNN poll was conducted by SSRS from June 3-24, before President Joe Biden dropped out of the 2024 presidential race on July 21, among a random national sample of 2,021 adults initially reached by mail, and 407 adults reached by random digit dialing to a sample of prepaid cellphone numbers. Surveys were either conducted online or by telephone with a live interviewer. Results for the full sample have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 2.7 percentage points; it is larger for subgroups.

The investigation found communication failures \u201cimpacted [Sgt. 1st\u00a0Class] Card\u2019s continuity of care.\u201d\u00a0In one critical failure, military and civilian health facilities\u00a0failed to upload Card\u2019s discharge documents to the military medical system for more than two weeks after he left\u00a0their care. \u201cThe discharge summary included relevant and critical information which if it had been provided to the chain of command would have detailed the extent of SFC Card\u2019s mental health issues,\u201d the investigation report says. Among those details include that he \u201chad homicidal ideations \u2026 appeared resistant to psychoeducation, and he blamed others for his behavior.\u201d The report also outlines several months of extremely troubling behavior\u00a0by Card\u00a0preceding the shooting, during which colleagues, friends, and family alike voiced concerns over his mental health and said they believed he was going to hurt others. \u201cI believe he\u2019s going to snap and do a mass shooting,\u201d Card\u2019s best friend, whose name is redacted in the report, said in a text message to unit leadership in September 2023, a little over a month before Card would go on a shooting rampage, that also injured 13 people, at a local bowling alley and restaurant. Card was\u00a0found dead\u00a0two days later with a self-inflicted gunshot wound. In total, the investigating team interviewed 43 witnesses and gathered 445 exhibits of evidence. Chief of Army Reserve Lt. Gen. Jody Daniels told reporters Monday the team was made up of a senior military intelligence officer, a military judge advocate serving\u00a0as a legal\u00a0adviser, a nurse, and a criminal investigation division agent. The investigation noted Card\u2019s chain of command had \u201climited jurisdiction\u201d over him given that Army Reservists\u00a0are typically on duty in the military roughly 40 days a year. Still, three people within Card\u2019s chain of command have been punished, officials told reporters. It was unclear what exactly the punishment was; Daniels said she took \u201cappropriate administrative action.\u201d The investigation report said his leadership should not have ordered him to his annual training in July\u00a02023 \u2014 during which he was hospitalized in a psychiatric facility \u2014\u00a0and that they failed to conduct a Line of Duty Investigation. The Line of Duty investigation would have \u201cproperly\u201d documented his hospital stay and condition, the report said. \u201cEven though we are on a limited duty status, that doesn\u2019t stop us from calling our soldiers and caring about them and checking in with them and seeing how they\u2019re doing, and asking others to go and do those wellness checks,\u201d Daniels said. \u201cGood leaders care about their soldiers.\u201d Months of warnings The breakdown in Card\u2019s mental state is believed to have started in the fall of 2022, when he experienced \u201ca series of emotional events and behavioral health challenges,\u201d the report said, including auditory hallucinations, interpersonal conflicts, and beginning to use new hearing aids, the report said. Card\u2019s family first reported concerns over his mental health to law enforcement in May 2023, but prior to that, Card \u2014 an Army Reserve sergeant first class who worked as a truck driver\u00a0in his civilian job \u2014\u00a0had no recorded history of suicide attempts or mental health issues. Others in his unit\u00a0\u201cgenerally considered\u201d Card to be\u00a0\u201ca steady, average performer, who was \u2018solid and reliable,\u2019\u201d according to the investigation.\u00a0Fellow service members described him as quiet, laid back, generous, and kind. But in January 2023, his demeanor began to change. Card grew increasingly paranoid, not just of people in his unit but of total strangers, including a Dunkin\u2019 Donuts employee he interacted with at a rest stop.\u00a0 Card\u2019s family had reported at least four mental health incidents by May 2023 to a high school resource police officer, who referred the incidents to the local law enforcement agency,\u00a0Sagadahoc\u00a0County Sheriff\u2019s Office. The report from Card\u2019s family included that he was believed to have \u201c10 to 15 rifles and/or handguns\u201d at his home. In July 2023, Card was ordered to attend annual training at the US Military Academy at West Point where he served as a weapons trainer for roughly two weeks every year between 2014 and 2022. Almost immediately upon arriving, Card remarked to colleagues that people were talking about him; within 24 hours of getting to New York for training, Card\u2019s leadership ordered him to undergo a command directed behavioral health evaluation at an Army hospital. At the Army hospital, officials believed Card needed a higher level of care, transferring him to a civilian hospital in the area, Four Winds, on July 16. The Army\u2019s investigation said psychological testing at Four Winds revealed Card\u2019s coping resources were \u201cabout as well-developed as those of most adults,\u201d but that he exhibited narcissism, poor emotional controls, and an inconsistent coping style that they believed would impact the way he responded to things. Card was ultimately discharged from Four Winds on August 3; the hospital\u2019s discharge summary said he presented a \u201cvery low risk\u201d of harming himself or others. But the individual who picked him up from the hospital told the Army investigating officer that Card told him he was \u201csmarter than the Four Winds staff,\u201d that he \u201cflipped out\u201d on a female patient who he believed was talking about him, and\u00a0he\u00a0was so angry about being in the hospital that \u201che placed his mattress against the wall and punched it until his hands become bloody.\u201d Despite Card being discharged on August 3, the investigation says Four Winds did not fax his discharge summary to the Army hospital until August 11, and it was not uploaded to the military medical system until August 21. It included details about his state including that he told providers he \u201cdecided to quit his job before he ended up killing someone\u201d and that he had a \u201chit list.\u201d Card\u2019s discharge from Four Winds also appeared to have impacted his unit\u2019s ability to remove his personal firearms from his home. Daniels said on Monday there were \u201cmultiple instances\u201d of Army Reserve personnel requesting Card\u2019s personal firearms be stored elsewhere, but that with private weapons, the Army Reserve \u201ccan request, we can ask, but we cannot compel that they store them anywhere \u2026 unless there\u2019s been a medical determination, and in this case there was not because [SFC] Card was released by civilian providers to go home.\u201d Staff at Four Winds refused to participate in the Army\u2019s investigation, the report says. The investigating officer recommended at the conclusion of the report that the Defense Health Agency should consider\u00a0removing\u00a0Four Winds as an authorized treatment facility. Four Winds has not yet responded to CNN\u2019s request for comment. Between Card\u2019s\u00a0discharge from Four Winds and the mass shooting in October, the investigation\u00a0outlined a\u00a0number of other concerning incidents. Among them was a threat by Card to commit a mass shooting which was reported by his chain of command to local law enforcement. Law enforcement could not make contact with him at his home, and despite him being inside, the investigation says, law enforcement \u201cdid not force an interaction or attempt to employ the Maine Yellow Flag Law, which could have restricted SFC Card\u2019s access to his privately owned firearms.\u201d Card\u2019s family\u00a0has since spoken out\u00a0about their many concerns with his behavior. James Herling, his brother-in-law, told an independent commission investigating the shooting that we \u201ccan point fingers at who\u2019s at fault, who has failed to make the ultimate contact, but in all reality, we all could have done better \u2014 from the sheriff\u2019s office to the Army to the family.\u201d Footage from law enforcement\u00a0released in December\u00a0showed authorities speaking to an Army Reserve officer about Card and attempting to make contact with him at his home. \u201cThey\u2019re (Card\u2019s family) worried about him doing a mass shooting,\u201d a sheriff\u2019s deputy is heard telling the captain in one of the videos from September, \u201cand he\u2019s having hallucinations, that he\u2019d been institutionalized for a couple of weeks this past summer, and he\u2019s not showing any signs of improvement.\u201d \u2018We\u2019re doing the best we can\u2019 In the days leading up to the shooting in Lewiston, the investigation said,\u00a0Card \u201ccontinued to withdraw from those around him,\u201d accusing them of talking about him and ridiculing him despite continuous outreach from his family attempting to provide encouragement and support. The Army Reserve Medical Management Center attempted to contact him in October to discuss follow-up treatment and check in on his wellbeing. The investigation says an individual attempted to contact him on October 17 and 19, but was unsuccessful in getting in touch. On October 24, one day before the mass shooting, an individual\u00a0called\u00a0Card. A man answered the phone, but as soon as\u00a0they\u00a0asked to speak with Card, the person on the other end of the hung up. On the evening of October 25, Card opened fire at Sparetime Recreation, a local bowling alley, and Schemengees Bar & Grille Restaurant. His body was located on October 27 in the back of a tractor trailer; the cause of death was noted as a \u201csuicide (shot self with handgun).\u201d The Army\u2019s investigation report said the service felt a \u201cmoral and ethical imperative\u201d to investigate\u00a0after the mass shooting. Since October 2023, there has been speculation as to whether traumatic brain injury sustained during Card\u2019s service may have contributed to his mental health decline. The investigation says Card did not deploy during his 22 years of service, and that while Card\u2019s \u201cBrief Psychotic Disorder\u201d may have been \u201caggravated\u201d by his military service and training during 2023, \u201cthis condition pre-dated SFC Card\u2019s [annual training].\u201d The investigation also references a 2008 incident when Card fell off of his home\u2019s roof and broke his neck \u2014\u00a0an incident that did not appear to be reported to the Army Reserve. Daniels said Monday Card\u2019s fall is believed to have had a larger impact on his health than events during his service. \u201cSFC Card did not deploy or mobilize; therefore, he was not exposed to conditions found in a combat environment,\u201d the investigation report said. Ultimately, Daniels said going forward commanders and legal advisers will be re-trained on their authorities when it comes to private weapons and health privacy, and ensuring other service members who may have been impacted by the shooting had mental health resources available to them. The Army Reserve is also undergoing a review of its behavioral health policies and standard operating procedures, and various issues have been reported up to broader agencies including the Defense Health Agency to improve case management procedures. \u201cMy heart and soul goes out to all those families, the folks that were witnesses to what happened,\u201d Daniels said on Monday. \u201cWe\u2019re doing the best that we can in terms of understanding what did transpire and then make changes for the future.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/army-investigation-robert-card-maine-mass-shooting/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_07_23_business_delta-flight-cancellations", "text": "Bad news for passengers: Delta Air Lines canceled hundreds more flights early Tuesday morning, as the problems caused by last week\u2019s global tech outage continued into a fifth day. Worse news: Delta\u2019s meltdown will probably extend through the end of the week. The meltdown has ensnared an estimated half a million people, ruined holidays and travel plans and prompted a federal investigation \u2013 even as Delta flight cancellations and delays are ongoing and far outpacing issues at other carriers. As of 2pm ET the Atlanta-based airline had canceled 466 flights, and Endeavor Air, its regional carrier that feeds its system under the Delta Connection brand, had canceled another 28 flights. The cancellations follow more than 1,250 flight cancellations Monday, and 4,500 flights from Friday through Sunday between Delta and Delta connection. There were more than 1,000 Delta and Delta Connection listed as delayed by FlightAware. The canceled flights by the two carriers represented nearly 70% of all flights within, to or from the United States that have been canceled on Monday, according to FlightAware. No other US airline had canceled one tenth as many flights. The problems prompted the Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg to announce the Department of Transportation would be starting an investigation to make sure Delta is following the law and treating passengers fairly. \u201cI\u2019m hearing a lot of things I\u2019m very concerned about, including people being on hold for hours and hours trying to get a new flight. people having to sleep on airport floors, even accounts of unaccompanied minors being stranded in airports unable to get on a flight,\u201d Buttigieg told reporters on Tuesday. \u201cPart of why we were opening this investigation is the scale of the problem,\u201d he added. \u201cOver 6,000 flights have been canceled since Friday, hundreds of flights have been canceled today, and we estimate that more than half a million passengers have been impacted by this.\u201d The DOT said it has received a \u201chigh volume of consumer complaints\u201d about Delta\u2019s actions since Friday. The department said if can penalize an airline for \u201can unfair and deceptive practice\u201d if it finds finds that an airline provided inadequate customer assistance when flights are canceled or travel plans significantly changed. Buttigieg asked passengers with complaints to contact the Department of Transportation. \u201cWhile you should first try to resolve issues directly with the airline, we want to hear from passengers who believe that Delta has not complied with USDOT-enforced passenger protection requirements during the recent travel disruptions,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cWe will follow up.\u201d Delta said it cooperating with the investigation. \u201cWe remain entirely focused on restoring our operation,\u201d the company told CNN in a statement. \u201cAcross our operation, Delta teams are working tirelessly to care for and make it right for customers impacted by delays and cancellations as we work to restore the reliable, on-time service they have come to expect from Delta.\u201d The problems stemmed from a software update issued late Thursday night by cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike that crashed Windows software. A cascade effect caused problems throughout the global airline industry last Friday. Although most airlines were able to recover and resume normal operations by the end of the weekend, Delta has been unable to fix problems with its crew tracking system, leaving it unable to find the pilots and flight attendants it needed to fly its planes. The problems will continue for at least a few more days, warned Rahul Samant, the company\u2019s chief information officer, in a message to Delta employees Monday. \u201cSo we\u2019re optimistic we\u2019ll get it done,\u201d Samant said in the video message along with CEO Ed Bastian. \u201cThere will be some things as Ed said, that we will do today, tomorrow to get to a better place by the end of the week.\u201d He said the IT staff is working \u201cfeverishly\u201d and \u201caround the clock\u201d to fix the problem. Frustrated passengers and crews The problems left tens of thousands of frustrated Delta customers stranded and unable to return home. Many of them booked other flights that were subsequently canceled as well. A lack of hotel rooms forced many to sleep in airports and wait for hours on hold trying to get through to Delta in an often-futile effort to find a flight. Delta crew members are dealing with similar frustrations. Many have been left stranded in airports far from their bases and homes, unable to be placed on flights because Delta has been unable to locate crews and place them on planes. Some Delta crew members are also unable to get hotel rooms and are sleeping at airports. And airport employees are contending with angry, frustrated customers who don\u2019t understand why their flights are being canceled when crew members are available. Jeremy and Kaylee Jones were married on Saturday and left Spokane, Washington Monday for their honeymoon, they told CNN. Five guests weren\u2019t able to attend the wedding due to flight issues. They arrived in Atlanta early Tuesday morning for a connecting flight from Atlanta to the Caribbean island of St. Lucia. There were no issues with the flights until they landed in Atlanta this morning and saw the flight to St. Lucia was cancelled due to a lack of crew. The next Delta flight to St. Lucia is not until Friday, so they are canceling their honeymoon. The only other option is to be re-routed to other airports, which they believe will have the same problem, and they still don\u2019t have their luggage. \u201cCurrently I\u2019m pretty sour,\u201d Jeremy Jones said. \u201cI get that things happen. This is just shocking to me that a multi-billion dollar corporation would struggle this much to get the ball rolling again.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m thinking the domino effect of flight cancellations are causing people to be stuck here for 5 days. I\u00a0have no confidence in getting anywhere at this point.\u201d This week, Delta remained in the dark about the whereabouts of its crew members. Crew members who logged on to the company\u2019s computer system to sign up for flights received prompts and questions that included: \u201cPlease enter below what airport code you are closest to,\u201d \u201cWhat is your current status?\u201d and \u201cPlease describe your current location.\u201d A person familiar with the airline\u2019s operations allowed CNN to see screenshots of the prompts. Delta declined to comment on the questions it was asking crews. To help fix its staffing problems, Delta is offering crew members premium pay, as well as additional assurances they will be able to travel back to their homes at the end of their work period, according to the screen shots viewed by CNN. The premium pay and assurances would be in place through Friday, another sign the staffing problem may not be fixed for several more days. Delta also declined to comment on these offers to crew members. But a letter from the chair of Delta\u2019s pilot\u2019s union obtained by CNN said that pilots were once again facing the same \u201cunacceptable obstacles\u201d they usually face when the airline has a problem, namely, the \u201cinability to contact the company in any capacity and the feeling that we have been abandoned in the system.\u201d Costs at $163 million - and climbing The service meltdown will cost Delta, both in terms of its reputation and in dollar costs. The meltdown has already cost the most profitable US airline about $163 million through Monday, according to an estimate from Savanthi Syth, airline analyst for Raymond James. That estimate comes from lost revenue and is likely to climb once additional pay for staff and reimbursements for customers are added in. Although the problems Tuesday are not as bad as they had been the last four days, the additional flight cancellations will add to those losses. Delta has prided itself on its on-time performance and customer service. Earlier this month its bragged in its earnings report that it achieved industry-best completion factor and on-time performance, and operated 39 cancellation-free, brand-perfect days. This meltdown is doing some damage to that reputation that will take time to repair. After a similar service meltdown at Southwest Airlines during the year-end holiday travel period in 2022, the airline canceled nearly 17,000 flights, or about half of its schedule, stranding more than 2 million passengers over an 10-day period. That cost it nearly $1.2 billion between the\u00a0fourth quarter of that year\u00a0and the\u00a0first two months of 2023. In addition to\u00a0customer compensation, the airline faced\u00a0additional labor costs\u00a0and lost revenue that continued into February.\u00a0In addition it was hit with a $140 million fine from the Department of Transportation. Delta\u2019s service black eye could also cause it to lose some future bookings from frustrated customers. This past weekend was the busiest travel period of the summer with 90% of the seats booked. That has made it difficult for Delta to find other flights for those customers whose flights have been canceled. Even if Delta was operating all of its flights normally, it would take days to accommodate all its angry, stranded passengers. Rows and rows and rows of luggage Getting those passengers reunited with their checked baggage is going to take many more days beyond that. United Airlines was also hit hard by the computer problem, with more than 1,000 canceled flights, although it was back to near-normal operations on Monday with only 69 cancellations for its mainline operations. In a note to staff CEO Scott Kirby said that the airline\u2019s 26,000 computers affected by the problem had all been fixed and its operations had been normal for the last 24 hours. He said some passengers had yet to be reunited with their baggage, and United is using FedEx to deliver the bags to some of them. At Atlanta\u2019s Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport, Delta\u2019s headquarters and largest hub, thousands of pieces of luggage are lined up on the floors of baggage claim. The bags made it to the world\u2019s busiest airport but, through delays and cancellations, their owners either have not yet arrived or arrived on a different plane. Delta employees from all different departments and roles across the company were supplementing efforts to help passengers who made it to Hartsfield to find their bags. Arthur Ginolfi, who had flown into Atlanta for a Global Business Travel Association convention after two trips to the airport in Philadelphia over the weekend, was one of those picking up a bag that had arrived on a different flight than he did. \u201cThis is the worst experience I\u2019ve ever had in my 35 years of business travel,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are lines that were unacceptable, there were people that were frustrated. I saw and I heard a lot of sad stories.\u201d He said he thinks Delta needs to be offering more compensation than he\u2019s gotten from the airline so far. \u201cI had to pay for parking for 12 hours, I had to pay for food, I had to pay for tolls,\u201d he said. \u201cI deserve more pros than a $24 gift card.\u201d This story has been updated with additional context and developments.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/23/business/delta-flight-cancellations/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "us"}}

Biscuit Basin, its parking lot and boardwalks \u2013 about 2 miles northwest of the Old Faithful geyser \u2013 are temporarily closed for safety reasons, officials added in the post. No injuries were reported after the incident, which occurred near the Sapphire Pool around 10 a.m. local time. Investigators have yet to determine how much damage has occurred. \u201cHydrothermal explosions are violent and dramatic events resulting in the rapid ejection of boiling water, steam, mud, and rock fragments,\u201d according to the US Geological Survey. They \u201coccur where shallow interconnected reservoirs of fluids with temperatures at or near the boiling point underlie\u00a0thermal\u00a0fields. These fluids can rapidly transition to steam if the pressure suddenly drops. Since vapor molecules take up much more space than liquid molecules, the transition to steam results in significant expansion and blows apart surrounding rocks and ejects debris,\u201d the agency says. The park has experienced such explosions in the past. \u201cPorkchop Geyser, in Norris Geyser Basin, experienced an explosion in 1989, and a small event in Norris Geyser Basin was recorded by monitoring equipment on April 15, 2024.\u00a0An explosion similar to that of today also occurred in Biscuit Basin on May 17, 2009,\u201d a joint release from the park and the USGS said.

Based on the occurrence of large\u00a0hydrothermal explosion\u00a0events over the past 16,000 years, an explosion large enough to create a 100-(meter)- (328-ft-) wide crater might be expected every few hundred years,\u201d it added.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/23/us/yellowstone-hydrothermal-explosion/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "us"}}

Around 1,600 flights into, within or out of the United States were canceled by Sunday evening, while more than 8,500 US flights were delayed, according to the tracking website\u00a0FlightAware.com. More than 1,000 of those cancelations were from Delta Air Lines, the website shows. The airline is continuing its recovery efforts following \u201can outside vendor technology issue\u201d resulting in delays and cancelations, Delta said\u00a0Sunday. The airline is communicating directly with some impacted customers, offering travel vouchers, waivers and SkyMiles Program miles, it said. In an update to Delta customers Sunday afternoon, Delta Air Lines CEO Ed Bastian said the airline\u2019s teams are still working to recover their system and restore operations. \u201cCanceling a flight is always a last resort, and something we don\u2019t take lightly,\u201d Bastian said. On Saturday, 2,136 flights among multiple carriers were canceled, and more than 21,300 flights were delayed, according to\u00a0FlightAware. The issue extended beyond airports, with businesses, government agencies, health and emergency services, banks, schools and universities around the world grinding to a halt or seeing services disrupted due to a\u00a0flawed software update\u00a0for Microsoft Windows operating systems issued by the cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike,\u00a0experts told CNN. The outage affected an estimated 8.5 million Windows devices, according to Microsoft. CrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz\u00a0apologized\u00a0to customers and said a fix has been deployed, but\u00a0experts say\u00a0getting systems back in order will be a lengthy process. Major airlines have said services are being restored, but there could be more delays and disruptions. A majority of\u00a0United\u00a0Airlines\u00a0systems\u00a0have\u00a0recovered\u00a0from Friday\u2019s outage, though some delays and cancellations are still possible, the airline\u00a0said in a statement. More than 400 United flights were canceled Saturday, and over 200 flights were canceled Sunday, according to\u00a0FlightAware.com. Delta has paused unaccompanied minor travel until Wednesday due to the outage, the airline announced over the weekend. Unaccompanied children who are already booked on a Delta flight will not be able to travel, and the airline has asked that no new flights be booked for them. Also impacted was American Airlines, which said in a statement  Friday \u201cwe were able to safely reestablish our operation\u201d and it had \u201cissued a travel waiver for our customers impacted by the vendor technology issue earlier this morning.\u201d Allegiant Air said in a statement Saturday while \u201cnormal operations have resumed\u201d after the outage, they\u2019re processing a backlog of customer messages and troubleshooting their programs and platforms. Even with the flawed computer update rolled back, it\u2019s not a quick fix for airlines, which have computers at thousands of gates that will need to be individually manually rebooted, David Kennedy, cofounder of cybersecurity company Binary Defense,\u00a0told CNN on Saturday. \u201cIt\u2019s not just as simple as rebooting. There\u2019s a lot more steps and complexities in this that are involved,\u201d Kennedy said. \u201cThere\u2019s just not enough people at those airports, at those locations to go and do it.\u201d The US Department of Transportation on Friday said it determined the flight delays and cancelations resulting from the system outage were \u201ccontrollable,\u201d meaning they\u2019re \u201cattributable to the airline.\u201d In such cases, the airlines \u201cmust adhere to their customer service commitments.\u201d Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg in a social media post Saturday said he received reports of some airlines only offering flight credits to passengers for canceled flights. \u201cLet me be clear \u2014 you are entitled to get your money back promptly if your flight is canceled and you don\u2019t take a rebooking,\u201d Buttigieg said. Travelers upset as plans are thwarted Flight cancelations persist at the world\u2019s\u00a0busiest\u00a0airport,\u00a0Atlanta\u2019s\u00a0Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport, where officials have implemented a \u201cconcessions crisis plan, ensuring concessions availability while all flights are operating.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve provided assistance and guidance to passengers spending the night in the airport, and we\u2019re collaborating with our airlines to create space for luggage reunification areas,\u201d an airport spokesperson told CNN on Sunday. \u201cIt just seems like nobody cares about us. We\u2019re sleeping on the floor. There\u2019s kids sleeping on the floor and no one\u2019s done anything about it,\u201d traveler Anthony Augugliaro told CNN affiliate WSB on Sunday. Long lines of passengers also waited for assistance at the airport Saturday. Delta passenger Catalina Villareal described the scene: \u201cMayhem. Chaos. Frustration. Hunger.\u201d Villareal said she had experienced three flights cancellations. Charlotte Yeh, a traveler at Boston Logan International Airport, told CNN affiliate WFXT Saturday she received no notification her flight to Fort Lauderdale for her father\u2019s 96th birthday was canceled. Thousands of people face the same uncertainty as they cram together in airports across the country, waiting for answers. \u201cI was supposed to be in California for my mom\u2019s wedding,\u201d Richard Whitfield of Pasco County, Florida, told CNN on Saturday. Whitfield and his partner, Jonathan Shade, left Tampa on Thursday and missed their connecting flight in Atlanta due to poor weather conditions, delaying their landing and forcing the plane to refuel in Tallahassee. After their rescheduled flight on Friday was delayed many times, the couple\u00a0decided to cancel the trip and just head home. But with no available flights back to Tampa on Friday night, they spent their second night in an airport hotel. They were unable to get a voucher from Delta for either of their stays. \u201c(Richard has) been on hold for 24 hours,\u201d Shade told CNN. \u201cWhen he eventually got his number in line, it was 2,001.\u201d Two hours later, Richard\u2019s place in Delta Air Lines\u2019 virtual customer service queue was 2,300 in line, Shade said. Whitfield told CNN the whole ordeal has had an impact on him. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s been the domino effect that it has on humanity and everything that we need to survive: food, sleep, or water, housing,\u201d he said. After spending 48 hours in Atlanta, they found a Saturday evening flight back to Tampa they say they can only hope is not delayed or canceled. For now, there is nothing the couple can do but wait and \u201cget a good stiff drink,\u201d Shade and Whitfield said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/21/us/tech-outage-flight-cancellations-united-delta-airlines/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "us"}}

{"id": "2024_07_23_economy_real-estate-market-homebuyers", "text": "After the last few years of skyrocketing home prices and elevated mortgage rates, Americans have been feeling overwhelmingly dejected about their prospects of buying a home. But there are now signs that maybe, just maybe, the worst could be over for homebuyers. \u201cJune, in particular, has started to show the housing market slowing down in favor of buyers,\u201d said Skylar Olsen, Zillow\u2019s chief economist. During the pandemic, families and remote workers rushed to find homes offering extra space, taking advantage of historically low borrowing costs after the Federal Reserve slashed interest rates to support the US economy. While the Fed doesn\u2019t directly set mortgage rates, its actions do influence borrowing costs throughout the economy. When the Fed began aggressively hiking rates again in March 2022 to battle historically high inflation, most economists expected housing demand to take a hit. High interest rates tend to decrease demand for homes, driving down prices. But something else happened. Demand for homes didn\u2019t disappear; instead, more homeowners held off on listing their homes to keep their pandemic-era ultra-low mortgage rates. This, coupled with an existing housing shortage, caused home prices to surge even higher. For the past two years, potential homebuyers have faced a double whammy of high prices and high mortgage rates. A recent report from real estate marketplace Zillow found that nearly one in four home sellers offered price cuts in June. That\u2019s the highest level for that month since 2018. Also, the average rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage fell last week to its lowest level since mid-March. This, along with a jump in new home construction and the expectation the Federal Reserve could begin cutting interest rates in September, could make buying a home more affordable in the future. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing a slow shift from a seller\u2019s market to a buyer\u2019s market,\u201d said National Association of Realtors chief economist Lawrence Yun in a statement after the release of the trade group\u2019s latest existing home sales tally. \u201cHomes are sitting on the market a bit longer, and sellers are receiving fewer offers. More buyers are insisting on home inspections and appraisals, and inventory is definitively rising on a national basis.\u201d The report showed that sales of existing homes fell by 5.4% in June. Green shoots are starting to appear Things may soon start looking up for Americans interested in buying a new home, said Rick Sharga, founder of real estate consulting firm CJ Patrick Company. \u201cWe\u2019re sitting today at probably, if not the worst affordability ever, really close to the worst affordability ever \u2014 so we almost have nowhere to go but up,\u201d Sharga said. \u201cI do believe we\u2019re past the worst.\u201d In another promising indicator for homebuyers, home price appreciation is slowing, according to Zillow\u2019s June Market report. Annual appreciation was 3.2% in June and monthly growth decelerated to 0.6%, the slowest June price appreciation since 2011. While still below pre-pandemic levels, home inventory is piling up. According to the NAR\u2019s Tuesday report, there were 1.32 million active listings in June, a 23.4% jump compared to June of 2023. Potential homebuyers now may not feel as much pressure to make a snap decision. Homes in June sat on the market for an average of 15 days. While that is still shorter than pre-pandemic, it is four days longer than last year. \u201cThere\u2019s a bit more breathing room,\u201d Olsen said. \u201cThat\u2019s still a sign of a housing market that we classify as a sellers\u2019 market, but we\u2019re on the cusp of going neutral.\u201d A growing number of Wall Street investors \u2014 more than 90%, according to the CME FedWatch tool \u2014 are forecasting the Federal Reserve will begin cutting interest rates in September. That could translate to more relief from high monthly mortgage payments down the line. Lower mortgage rates could also, crucially, free up housing inventory, Sharga said. \u201cIt will likely entice some homeowners to list their properties and move on, which they haven\u2019t been doing with rates as high as they are,\u201d he said. Another major factor: Home construction is flourishing. Normally, higher borrowing costs make it more expensive to build, but according to US Census data, construction of new homes rose 3% in June, while the number of new, privately owned homes that completed construction jumped more than 10% in one month and 15.5% since June of last year. A potential downside However, buying a home still remains unaffordable for many Americans. The median price of a previously owned home rose to $426,900 in June, the second consecutive month that prices reached a fresh record high based on data going back to 1999, according to the NAR. It may take some time before homebuyers feel any improvement in their market, and since real estate is local, each area in the country tells a different story. For example, New Orleans is one city that has already tipped into becoming a buyers\u2019 market, according to Zillow data. While that may sound like great news for people looking to buy homes in the area, Leslie Heindel, a Realtor in New Orleans, said lower home prices in the city mask other costs. \u201cWhen the pandemic started, everything went crazy. Something would hit the market and you would have 20 offers in one day,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd then insurance changed here and that was it for us.\u201d Heindel said that homeowners\u2019 insurance rates have shot up for many people in the area, creating an additional, and often unexpected, cost of owning a home. \u201cFor people to be able to buy a house, we couldn\u2019t continue selling at inflated prices along with higher interest rates and the insurance situation,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can definitely get something cheaper here now, but there\u2019s a reason for it.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/23/economy/real-estate-market-homebuyers/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_07_20_us_global-it-outage-california-forecaster-trnd", "text": "As what was possibly the \u201clargest IT outage in history\u201d impacted computer systems across the globe this week, a Northern California weather forecaster found a creative \u2013 and hands-on \u2013 solution to keep his viewers updated as his news station\u2019s software remained offline. On Friday, many computer systems for healthcare, business, technology and government sectors worldwide crashed after cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike issued a software update for Microsoft Windows operating systems. The widespread disturbance affected 8.5 million Windows devices, or fewer than 1% of all Windows machines, Microsoft said Saturday. The lengthy process of restoring operations continued on Saturday. But early Friday morning, Preston Donion, a forecaster and multimedia journalist for CNN affiliate KRCR in Redding, California, says he woke up to chaos after \u201ceverything had gone completely haywire\u201d with the systems at his job the night before. \u201cThey didn\u2019t end up even running a broadcast on our stations at 10 and 11 (p.m.), so they were really kaput,\u201d Donion told CNN on Saturday. He says he rushed into work to find that, sure enough, they had no weather graphics available. Donion and his producer teamed up to figure out how they could display a weather forecast on air with the systems down, he said. \u201cBecause I have my numbers, I can get my forecast built, but I have no way to communicate that,\u201d recalled Donion, who\u2019s worked at KRCR since June 2022. He says he spent the first half hour of the show pulling up websites or screen sharing from one of the station\u2019s iPads and stepping off the screen to read numbers. \u201cBut I realized that wasn\u2019t very engaging, wasn\u2019t very effective,\u201d Donion said. About 45 minutes into the broadcast, the Washington native says he used a Sharpie and a pen to draw a rough sketch of a map he had saved as a reference for familiarizing himself with California. \u201cI just went to work on the back of a piece of paper that had my rundown on it, and just did my best,\u201d Donion said. His on-air solution to the tech fiasco turned out to be the hand-drawn maps of his coverage area, which he admitted to viewers weren\u2019t \u201cperfect\u201d renderings. \u201cI just drew this up,\u201d Donion can be seen telling local viewers in a video he shared to his X account Friday. \u201cI know Trinity County looks like it\u2019s been on somewhat of a diet there, and things are a little square in Modoc County, but I wanted to give you a visual.\u201d He also shared on air the seven-day forecast using a chart he typed in his phone\u2019s Notes app, the video shows. \u201cI thought it was the best way to just kind of put together some visuals without having computer technology, so it was fun to me,\u201d said Donion. One viewer commented the retro approach to the forecast took them back to the 1970s, when TV meteorologists used paper maps and magnets in their weather centers, he said. \u201cI definitely got some messages on Facebook and on Twitter saying, \u2018Hey, you know, thanks for adapting. We appreciate you just getting the information out,\u2019\u201d Donion said. \u201cOther meteorologists have reached out and said, \u2018You know, I was thinking I\u2019d have to get my magnets out,\u2019\u201d he added. Many of KRCR\u2019s systems were back online by the end of Donion\u2019s shift around 11 a.m. local time Friday, and the evening shows went smoothly, he shared. CNN Meteorologist Elisa Raffa gave kudos to Donion for his quick thinking. While learning about meteorology in school, Raffa says weather students learned to hand-draw fronts and storm systems. \u201cIt\u2019s a skill you never think you\u2019ll need again \u2013 until the computers go out,\u201d Raffa said. \u201cAnd if you ask a 30-plus-year veteran in the industry, they\u2019d be happy to remind us that this was how weather was done before the magic of green screens,\u201d she added. \u201cMarkers, chalk, magnets and a whole lot of paper were used to get a forecast on TV. It\u2019s amazing how much we depend on technology now!\u201d CNN\u2019s Dalia Faheid contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/20/us/global-it-outage-california-forecaster-trnd/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "us"}}

When deputies responded, they were unable to locate the child\u2019s home or parents due to the boy being both autistic and non-verbal, according to\u00a0a release from the Union County Sheriff\u2019s Office. It was then that bloodhound Remi and his handler, Deputy B. Belk, decided to try a \u201creverse\u201d K-9 track \u2013 something \u201cout of the norm\u201d for a K9 to do, Lieutenant Public Information Officer James Maye told CNN. \u201cNormally, they track from where a person left to try to find where that person is currently. This time we were doing it reverse,\u201d Maye said.

In about 15 minutes,\u00a0Remi was able to lead the child back home, about a half mile away in a nearby neighborhood. When deputies arrived, the home\u2019s garage door was open and they determined the boy, approximately six years old, left \u201cin a secretive manner that would not have alerted his parents.\u201d The deputies found there was no criminal offense and left tips to help the family prevent a similar incident from happening again, the sheriff\u2019s office said.

It\u2019s not something that these guys train on normally, but it is something they\u2019re going to instill in training from here on out,\u201d Maye said. Bloodhounds are known for their\u00a0keen sense of smell, including the ability to distinguish the scent of one human from another. Remi is just one year old and has been with the department since he was a puppy. He was trained internally by its canine handler, Maye said.

The lottery winner, who did not want to be publicly identified, bought two winning tickets at a Shell gas station in Murfreesboro, Tennessee, the\u00a0Rutherford County Sheriff\u2019s Office said in a news release on Monday. One winning ticket had a prize of $40 and the other was the $1 million ticket. A clerk at the gas station stole the ticket and tried to collect the prize, authorities said. Store video obtained by investigators of the Tennessee Lottery shows Meet Patel scanning the tickets, according to authorities. To save time, the customer had only scratched off the front bar code, and then asked Patel to check if the tickets were winners, authorities told CNN affiliate WTVF. \u201cIf you scratch off the front bar code, it will tell you if it\u2019s a winner or not, regardless of whether you scratch off everything showing how much you won,\u201d Lt. Det. Steve Craig told WTVF. Patel then placed the $1 million ticket in the trash, authorities said. Later, the video allegedly shows him taking out the trash, after which he removes the winning ticket and puts it in his pocket. \u201cMr. Patel is then seen later in the video celebrating in the store after scratching off the front of the ticket and learning it was a $1 million winner,\u201d Det. Dennis Ward said in the news release. For any prize of $200,000 or more, players must claim their winnings at the Tennessee Lottery\u2019s Nashville headquarters. Patel, 23, tried to claim his prize from the Tennessee Lottery, but employees there were suspicious, according to the news release. \u201cHe went to the Tennessee Lottery Commission to claim the ticket as his own and through their normal line of questioning there were enough red flags for them to say, \u2018Hey, you need to get all of your affairs in order and come back to us and we\u2019re gonna hold on to the ticket,\u2019\u201d Craig told WTVF. Patel\u00a0is currently being held on a charge of theft over $250,000 at the Rutherford County Adult Detention Center, the sheriff\u2019s office told CNN.

{"id": "2024_07_23_us_railcar-inspections-safety-concerns-ohio-crash", "text": "Major freight railroads are rushing railcar inspections, reinforcing known safety concerns raised by unions for years, but at a House hearing Tuesday they\u2019ll present new evidence from federal inspectors that railcar checks are routinely less than two minutes per car. The unions have sounded the alarm often in recent years as the major railroads all adopted versions of the lean precision scheduled railroading operating model and collectively cut roughly one-third of all their workers. Labor groups like the Transportation Communications Union, which represents the expert carmen who are supposed to inspect railcars, have said all the cuts have led to rushed inspections that miss problems and prompted railroads to rely on train crews too often to do limited inspections. The disastrous Norfolk Southern derailment last year in East Palestine, Ohio, that prompted Tuesday\u2019s hearing was caused by an overheating bearing that wasn\u2019t caught in time by trackside sensors. The National Transportation Safety Board didn\u2019t speculate in its final report released last month whether an inspection in a railyard might have caught the failed bearing, but it did point out that the railroad never inspected the car after it picked it up in St. Louis even though it crossed through several railyards before the crash. And more than 25% of the cars on that train had defects despite being inspected beforehand. The TCU\u2019s National Legislative Director David Arouca says inspections are happening less often and with less time these days because of all the job cuts. \u201cSadly, in today\u2019s era of railroading, many carmen have to make the difficult decision of what to inspect. Under impossible time pressures, carmen are simply unable to perform full inspections,\u201d Arouca said. Each side of a railcar has at least 90 points that are supposed to be checked in an inspection \u2014 something that Arouca said can\u2019t be done in the time allotted today. The Federal Railroad Administration study found that the major freight railroads allowed an average of 1 minute and 38 seconds per car while a federal inspector was watching, but documents showed that when an inspector isn\u2019t there, inspections are being done in about 44 seconds per car. The FRA isn\u2019t ready to say that the railroads\u2019 current operating model is unsafe because more research is needed to determine whether that is the case. But FRA Administrator Amit Bose said railroads\u2019 \u201csafety performance has stagnated over the last decade \u2014 and by some measures, deteriorated.\u201d \u201cDespite assertions to the contrary, derailment rates for our nation\u2019s largest rail companies have not significantly improved,\u201d Bose said. And even though most derailments don\u2019t cause anything like the massive black plume of smoke and lingering health worries that followed the East Palestine derailment \u2014 because many of them happen at slow speeds without spilling toxic chemicals \u2014 smaller derailments shouldn\u2019t be dismissed as the railroad equivalent of a fender-bender because they can still be deadly, Bose said. None of the CEOs of the major railroads \u2013 which include Norfolk Southern, CSX, Union Pacific, BNSF, Canadian National and CPKC \u2013 were at the hearing, even though several of them were invited. US Rep. Derrick Van Orden, R-Wisconsin, said it\u2019s shameful none of the CEOs were willing to show up. The railroads maintain they are committed to improving safety and have taken a number of steps since the East Palestine derailment including adding hundreds more trackside detectors to spot mechanical problems and reviewing the way they respond to temperature alerts from those devices. Plus, the Association of American Railroads trade group continues to point out that even with derailments \u2013 which happen across the country roughly three times a day \u2013 railroads remain the safest option, with more than 99% of all hazardous chemicals arriving safely. But as the Ohio derailment shows, even one derailment can be disastrous if chemicals spill and catch fire. Railroads also argue that new technology they are investing in can help supplement the visual inspections that workers do and spot problems while trains are moving down the tracks. But Greg Hynes with the SMART-TD union, which represents conductors and is the largest rail union, said \u201cin the accident\u2019s wake little has changed.\u201d Ohio\u2019s two US senators \u2013 including Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance \u2013 led a bipartisan group in proposing a sweeping rail safety bill last year that included requirements for inspection standards and rules for those trackside detectors, but that bill stalled after it advanced out of committee and never got a floor vote. US Rep. Troy Nehls of Texas, a Republican who leads the House subcommittee on railroads, recently introduced a similar, broad bill along with US Rep. Seth Moulton, D-Massachusetts. But most Republicans appear to want a more limited approach based on the findings of the NTSB investigation. A narrower bill hasn\u2019t yet been introduced. On Tuesday, Rep. Sam Graves, a Missouri Republican and the chair of the Transportation Committee, said he does not think any rail safety legislation was necessary to address the problems that led to the 2023 derailment. He added that a bill would not be emerging from his committee. But the chair of the NTSB, Jennifer Homendy, suggested that Congress should accelerate its phasing out of the older DOT-111 tank cars that are prone to rupturing in a derailment and then look at addressing the more than 200 other outstanding recommendations her agency has \u201crepeated and repeated and repeated with zero action by the railroads and by some regulators.\u201d In addition to all the rail safety concerns, the NTSB said Tuesday that it is worried that a federal effort by the Drug Enforcement Administration to reclassify marijuana as a less serious drug could prevent train crews, pilots and other transportation workers from being tested for marijuana even though it could impair their judgment. The NTSB said that eliminating marijuana testing for transportation workers \u201cwould create a safety blind spot that could endanger the public.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/23/us/railcar-inspections-safety-concerns-ohio-crash/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_07_23_politics_harris-immigration-work-gop-attacks", "text": "As a border crisis unfolded only months into Joe Biden\u2019s presidency, he looked to his vice president to help solve an intractable issue: migration. It seemed like a no-win political assignment. Vice President Kamala Harris and her staff quickly sought to make one thing clear: She wasn\u2019t charged with managing the southern border. Three years later, that task looms over Harris\u2019 unprecedented campaign\u00a0for the White House, becoming a central line of attack\u00a0from\u00a0Republicans. \u201cAs a result of her dangerously extreme immigration policies, the largest invasion in history is now taking place at our southern border, and it\u2019s getting worse, not better,\u201d former President Donald Trump said in a rare call with reporters Tuesday, falsely claiming Harris had been appointed Biden\u2019s \u201cborder czar.\u201d The management of the US-Mexico border has been a political liability for Biden, and it will now follow Harris as Trump makes it a cornerstone of his campaign. Over the last three years,\u00a0an unprecedented number of border crossings have come to define the administration\u2019s immigration record \u2014 recently resulting in the White House taking an aggressive measure to dramatically clamp down on asylum at the US southern border. As the vice president\u2019s campaign takes shape and as immigration remains a top issue for voters, her team is forced to contend with an assignment that, sources say, has showed early success in Central America as a result of major private-sector investment but that\u2019s been bundled with the administration\u2019s larger migration issues. In the first rally of her 2024 presidential campaign Tuesday, Harris didn\u2019t mention border security. The issue has generally not been featured prominently at campaign rallies over the last year, but both Harris and Biden have recently cited the bipartisan immigration deal that was scuttled by Trump to make the case that Republicans aren\u2019t serious about border security. The\u00a0House\u00a0GOP campaign arm\u00a0is also encouraging\u00a0lawmakers\u00a0to focus on what it describes as Harris\u2019 failed border policies, according to a memo obtained by CNN. Harris\u2019 root cause work dates to March 2021.\u00a0During an influx of unaccompanied migrant children, Biden tasked the vice president with overseeing diplomatic efforts in Central America, seeing\u00a0the assignment\u00a0as a sign of respect, having done the same job himself under former President Barack Obama. While\u00a0Harris\u00a0focused on long-term fixes, the Department of Homeland Security remained responsible\u00a0for\u00a0overseeing border security. At the time, most minors apprehended at the US southern border were from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras \u2014\u00a0a region that was hard-hit by major hurricanes and the Covid-19 pandemic and that had been a main source of migration over the last decade. As the vice president\u2019s team began strategizing, the problem facing the administration grew. Seven months later, it was migrants arriving from even farther away in South America \u2014 outside of Harris\u2019 assigned portfolio \u2014 who were overwhelming the Biden administration. Border crossings surged, and Republicans pointed their fingers at the vice president, dubbing Harris the \u201cborder czar,\u201d a title the White House rejected, arguing that her focus was on the region and not on border security.\u00a0And in 2022, as an affront to Harris, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican, began busing migrants to her residence at the Naval Observatory in Washington, DC. Democratic Rep. Pete Aguilar\u00a0of California\u00a0on Tuesday called efforts by House Republicans to paint Harris as a border czar \u201claughable and unserious.\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s be very clear, there was no \u2018border czar.\u2019 Kamala Harris\u2019 role was to engage in multilateral discussion with our Latin American countries,\u201d the House Democratic Caucus chair told reporters. Harris\u00a0has\u00a0only occasionally talked about\u00a0her efforts as the situation along the US-Mexico border became a political vulnerability for Biden. And it\u2019s the comments she made early on that will likely be used by Republicans in the months to come. In an interview with NBC\u2019s Lester Holt in June 2021, roughly five months after taking office, Harris was pressed about the fact that she hadn\u2019t yet visited the US-Mexico border. \u201cAt some point, you know, we are going to the border,\u201d\u00a0the vice president\u00a0said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been to the border. So this whole \u2026 thing about the border. We\u2019ve been to the border. We\u2019ve been to the border.\u201d Holt responded: \u201cYou haven\u2019t been to the border.\u201d \u201cAnd I haven\u2019t been to Europe. And I mean, I don\u2019t \u2014 I don\u2019t understand the point that you\u2019re making,\u201d Harris said with a laugh. She added: \u201cI\u2019m not discounting the importance of the border.\u201d Later that month, Harris visited the border. Harris navigates one of the most politically fraught issues White House officials quickly worked to get Harris up to speed after she was assigned to tackle the root causes of migration. Officials pulled together a series of memos examining what Biden had done when he was vice president and held a similar role, analyzing what worked and what could be done better, according to a former senior administration official. In some ways, the region had already been familiar territory for Harris, dating to her days as California\u2019s attorney general. \u201cIn terms of the root causes piece as VP, there\u2019s a through line in her work as AG starting to build relationships in Mexico and Central America,\u201d said Daniel Suvor, former chief of policy to then-Attorney General Harris and now partner at O\u2019Melveny & Myers, arguing that her work has often focused on concrete, measurable outcomes. Officials met daily, briefing the vice president along the way, with another former senior administration official describing the process as \u201cintense\u201d amid a worsening crisis at the border. \u201cShe ultimately studied that and put her own stamp on it, which was the private-sector component,\u201d one of the former senior administration officials said, noting that was an area they concluded Biden, as vice president, didn\u2019t have time to fully develop. Harris pulled together the\u00a0Partnership for Central America, which has acted as a liaison between companies and the US government. Her team and the partnership are closely coordinating on initiatives that have led to job creation in the region. Harris has also engaged directly with foreign leaders in the region. Earlier this year, Harris met with President Bernardo Ar\u00e9valo of Guatemala to strengthen the US-Guatemala bilateral relationship and discuss good governance, economic opportunity, security and migration management, according to\u00a0a White House\u00a0readout. Around 56 companies\u00a0are collaborating across financial services, textiles and apparel, agriculture, technology, telecommunications, and nonprofit sectors to bolster the region\u2019s economy. Together, they\u2019ve invested more than $5 billion. Experts credit Harris\u2019 ability to secure private-sector investments as her most visible action in the region to date but have cautioned about the long-term durability of those investments. Honduran Minister of Investment Miguel Medina argued that having the White House behind the initiative has been instrumental in bringing big companies and private-sector money into the region. \u201cThe difference with the partnership is that the facilitating that they\u2019ve been doing, and they continue to do, that facilitating is not something that is accessible to a normal company in Honduras,\u201d he said, citing, for example, work with Nespresso to purchase and sell coffee beans. \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for this being moved from the White House, there\u2019s \u2026 no way we could have had the success that it\u2019s had,\u201d Medina added. While it\u2019s difficult to measure the direct impact on migration, US Customs and Border Protection has seen a considerable drop in migrants arriving\u00a0at\u00a0the southern border from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, according to federal data. \u201cFor the long term, she certainly can claim credit for having started off efforts to improve people\u2019s lives in Central America,\u201d said Andrew Selee, president of the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/23/politics/harris-immigration-work-gop-attacks/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_07_23_business_tesla-earnings", "text": "Telsa profit in the second quarter plunged more than 40% from a year ago, as the electric vehicle company has faced both more EV competition from established automakers and a slowing of overall EV sales growth. The drop in profits is a stark contrast for a company that grew to become the world\u2019s most valuable automaker on surging sales and profitability. The results underscore how Tesla, a pioneer in bringing electric vehicles to American drivers, now faces more intense competition from rivals at home and abroad. And with the EV market maturing, the growth in consumer interest for EVs has slowed. Tesla reported adjusted income of $1.8 billiion in the quarter, or 52 cents a share. Analysts had forecast earnings of 61 cents a share, compared to the 91 cents a share it earned a year earlier. Its key measure of profit margin was sharply lower, as a series of price cuts on EVs took a toll. The April through June period was the second straight quarter of year-over-year sales declines for the company, its first-ever consecutive quarters of declining sales volume. The only previous quarter with a sales decline since Tesla went public came early in the pandemic, when stay-at-home orders forced its factories to close. Tesla did not give a new sales target for the full year. But it did warn that \u201cIn 2024, our vehicle volume growth rate may be notably lower than the growth rate achieved in 2023.\u201d Tesla CEO Elon Musk disparaged the quality of EVs from other automakers now in the market on the investors call after the release, saying they posed only a short-term issue for Tesla, not a long-term issue. He said Tesla remains convinced the world is moving toward fully electric transportation systems, not just for cars, but for planes and ships as well. Musk also said that the company would release more details on fully-automated robotaxis in October, rather than a previously planned August. The company calls its driver assist feature \u201cFull Self Driving,\u201d but that still requires drivers to be ready to take control of the car. Tesla still faces regulatory and technical hurdles before it can offer robotoxis without drivers, the company said in its earning statement. Musk said he still believes that is possible to achieve by the end of this year, and definitely by next year, but he cautioned: \u201cMy predictions on this have been overly optimistic in the past.\u201d Tesla faces federal investigations into some of Musk\u2019s claims about Full Self Driving capabilities. The company has also faced a Department of Justice inquiry in the past, although it\u2019s unclear what the current status is of that investigation. He did announce Tesla\u2019s plans to build an assembly plant in Mexico have been put on hold. The plans were announced more than a year ago, but Musk said the plans have now been paused until after the presidential election because of a threat by Republican nominee Donald Trump to slap tariffs on vehicles imported from Mexico. Musk is a strong Trump supporter, both endorsing him and reportedly pledging tens of millions of dollars toward the former president\u2019s re-election efforts. Trump vowed similar tariffs on Mexican-built cars in 2019, when he was president, but never followed through. Shares of Tesla (TSLA) fell more than 8% in after-hours trading. Shares are down about 1% so far this year through Tuesday\u2019s close, after being down as much as 44% earlier this year.

Two associates of Chronis rushed to\u00a0his aid after\u00a0hearing\u00a0his\u00a0fall and screams, according to the complaint. The shower delivered water at an \u201cextremely excessive temperature,\u201d the complaint stated. The temperature was more than 150 degrees, according to Chronis\u2019 family attorney, N.
