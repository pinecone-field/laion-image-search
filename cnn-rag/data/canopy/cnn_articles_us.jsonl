Alex Chronis, then 76 years old, sustained third-degree burns on his body at the Econo Lodge\u00a0in Erlanger, Kentucky, which ultimately resulted in his \u201cuntimely and wrongful death,\u201d on June 19, 2022. according to the complaint filed by Chronis\u2019 niece. On November 19, 2021, Chronis attempted to take a shower but was \u201calmost immediately bombarded with scalding hot water which knocked him to the floor of the shower tub where the water continued to scald him,\u201d\u00a0the complaint\u00a0states. Two associates of Chronis rushed to\u00a0his aid after\u00a0hearing\u00a0his\u00a0fall and screams, according to the complaint. The shower delivered water at an \u201cextremely excessive temperature,\u201d the complaint stated. The temperature was more than 150 degrees, according to Chronis\u2019 family attorney, N. Jeffrey Blankenship. Most adults will suffer third-degree burns if exposed to 150-degree water for two seconds, according to the\u00a0Consumer Product Safety Commission. Chronis, a food vendor visiting the Cincinnati region for work,\u00a0initially\u00a0used nonprescription medicine for his burns\u00a0before working at a\u00a0local festival, according to Blankenship. He\u00a0went to a nearby hospital but\u00a0left to return to work, Blankenship added. Two days later, Chronis returned\u00a0to the hospital for skin graft surgery and remained hospitalized for nearly five months, according to the complaint. In April 2022, Chronis was\u00a0transferred to a rehabilitation facility in his hometown of Knoxville, Tennessee, Blankenship said. He\u00a0spent months in the hospital after the incident, underwent numerous medical procedures, and endured \u201csubstantial conscious pain and suffering\u201d before\u00a0ultimately dying from his injuries on June 19, 2022, according to the complaint. The jury found the motel owner, Sanjay Patel, \u201cfailed to exercise ordinary care in inspecting and maintaining their hotel rooms in a reasonably safe condition for the use of their guests,\u201d according to the trial order and judgment. According to the Kentucky Secretary of State\u2019s website, Patel owns Aspyn, LLC, which operates the Econo Lodge in Erlanger, which was also named as a defendant in the suit. The judgment, filed on July 3, awarded Chronis\u2019 estate nearly $1.3 million to cover medical expenses, $250,000 for pain and suffering, more than $16,000 for funeral costs, and $500,000\u00a0in\u00a0punitive damages.

{"id": "2024_07_16_us_trump-rally-security-errors-list", "text": "Security errors, lapses and missed opportunities to stop a gunman led to the first shooting of a US president or former president in more than a generation. Here are several issues and problems identified by CNN that could or should have been addressed before the attack on former President Donald Trump. In addition, CNN Chief Law Enforcement and Intelligence Analyst John Miller provided his analysis of some of the issues and their importance. Unsecured rooftop in range of the stage and with clear line of sight The building used by the gunman was outside the \u201chard perimeter\u201d set by the United States Secret Service inside which every person is screened. But less than 500 feet from the stage, the building was within shooting range and had a clear line of sight to where the former president stood to address the crowd. \u201cThis is a key factor in protective planning: What structures have a line of sight to the protectee, especially if that also includes high ground, a window, or a rooftop,\u201d Miller explained. \u201cThis building encompassed all those elements,\u00a0and it was within a very viable range for a rifle shot.\u201d Shooter was apparently seen acting suspiciously early by security cordon\n                   The shooter was spotted by local law enforcement who thought he might have been acting suspiciously near the magnetometers on Saturday, according to a senior law enforcement official. They put it out over their radio to keep an eye on him \u2013 and that information was passed to Secret Service as well, according to the source. When the shooter left the area of the magnetometers, he apparently wasn\u2019t seen again until people alerted law enforcement in a field outside the event that he was on the rooftop. About an hour before the incident, a person wearing clothing resembling the gunman\u2019s was also captured on video in front of the building whose roof the shooter later climbed, according to footage obtained by CNN affiliate WTAE. Pennsylvania State Police told WTAE they are looking into the video as a part of the investigation. CNN has reached out\u00a0to the state police for more information. A source told CNN that about 19 minutes before the shooting, law enforcement was trying to locate the shooter, but they could not find him until he was on the roof. Building access not controlled No one stopped the shooter from reaching the roof of the American Glass Research building. Potential confusion about law enforcement presence Snipers from the Butler County Emergency Services Unit were in the same complex but were not aware of the gunman on the roof, a source familiar with the ongoing investigation told CNN. They were positioned on the second floor, watching the rally crowd, the source said. Miller raised questions about the Secret Service\u2019s approach to securing that building: \u201cIn the initial planning to secure this event,\u00a0if that building was identified as a \u2018high-ground threat\u2019 for a potential sniper attack, did the Secret Service set specific requirements for the police about access control around that building, or did they just instruct them to\u00a0\u2018keep an eye out for anything suspicious?\u2019 \u201cThose are going to be key questions in these after-action reviews,\u201d he added. Agencies initially blamed each other The Secret Service was \u201csolely responsible\u201d for implementation of security at the rally, Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle told CNN\u2019s Whitney Wild. \u201cAt that particular site, we divided up areas of responsibility, but the Secret Service is totally responsible for the design and implementation and the execution of the site,\u201d she told CNN Tuesday evening. But Cheatle earlier told ABC News her agents only \u201cshared support\u201d for the building used for the shooting. \u201cWe sought assistance from our local counterparts for the outer perimeter,\u201d she said. \u201cThere was local police in that building \u2013 there was local police in the area that were responsible for the outer perimeter of the building.\u201d Cheatle said in the same interview that protection for Trump was the responsibility of the Secret Service and \u201cthe buck stops with me.\u201d Miller explained: \u201cAs part of the \u2018outer perimeter,\u2019 that building was the responsibility of local law enforcement, but that distinction only goes so far, and the Secret Service concedes that when the director says, \u2018The buck stops here.\u2019\u201d Crowd flagged gunman on roof almost 2 minutes before shooting Attendees in the crowd noticed the gunman on the roof nearly two minutes before the shots were fired, according to a CNN analysis of witness video and the official video feed of Trump\u2019s speech. As Trump questioned if Biden \u201cwas doing the job,\u201d someone on the video said, \u201cLook they\u2019re all pointing.\u201d One minute and 57 seconds later, gunfire can be heard. \u201cMy wife ran up to law enforcement and was trying to tell them where he was,\u201d Mike DiFrischia, a witness who took video of the shooting, told CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett. \u201cBut they couldn\u2019t seem to see him because they weren\u2019t in the right spot to see him on the roof. They were too close to the building.\u201d Local officer unable to tackle gunman before he fired at stage Butler Township police officers were alerted to calls about a suspicious person near the rally on Saturday, the head of another law enforcement agency told CNN. They discovered the man on the roof and one local officer hoisted another to get up to the ledge, Butler County Sheriff Michael T. Slupe said. The shooter turned around, saw the officer peering over and pointed his gun at him. The officer let go of the ledge to \u201ctake cover\u201d and save his life. The gunman then started firing from the rooftop.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/16/us/trump-rally-security-errors-list/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/23/2024", "section": "us"}}

{"id": "2024_07_22_business_delta-canceled-flights-computer-problems", "text": "Three days after a computer update problem caused more than 5,000 flight cancellations around the world in a single day, things are pretty much back to normal \u2014 except at Delta Air Lines. Atlanta-based Delta canceled more than 1,000 more flights Monday alone, according to flight tracking service FlightAware, when counting both Delta\u2019s mainline operations and Endeavor, its regional airline that feeds its system under the Delta Connection brand. Those 1,000 flights represented just over half of all flights canceled by airlines worldwide on Monday, and about three-quarters of the flights within, to or from the United States, as most carriers returned to normal operations. Other US airlines had 2% or fewer of their flights canceled. Monday\u2019s problems follow 1,500 flights that Delta canceled on Friday and nearly 3,000 more flights over the weekend. The problems likely left tens of thousands of frustrated Delta customers stranded and unable to return home, many of them being booked onto a series of flights that would subsequently be canceled as well. Lack of available hotel rooms left many forced to sleep in airports and wait for hours on hold trying to get through to Delta in an often-futile effort to find a flight. In a note to customers Sunday, Delta CEO Ed Bastian apologized for the disruptions and attributed the problem to the computer program affecting its \u201ccrew tracking\u201d software. \u201cOne of our crew tracking-related tools was affected and unable to\u00a0effectively process the unprecedented number of changes triggered by the system shutdown,\u201d he wrote in a note to customers.\u00a0\u201cOur teams have been working around the clock to recover and restore full functionality.\u201d While many airlines large and small had the CrowdStrike problem affect computers that were supposed to check in passengers, it appeared that Delta might have been the one airline that had its crucial crew scheduling software affected. At Atlanta\u2019s Hartsfield International Airport on Monday, friends Nicole\u00a0DaSilva, Tiffany Denlinger and Melissa Levine had been traveling since Saturday to get home to Tucson, Arizona, after an international trip to Athens. But they were told that finding a flight for the last leg of their trip could take until Wednesday or Thursday. \u201cWe\u2019ve been on multiple different flights, and they\u2019ve all been canceled,\u201d DaSilva said, clutching a handful of tickets that could not be used. Denlinger stayed glued to her phone, waiting to speak with a Delta employee. She held up her phone to show how long she\u2019s been on hold: \u201cSix hours and 20 minutes,\u201d she said. But the problem with the critical crew tracking system was still not fixed as of Monday morning, according to a video message to Delta staff from Bastian and Rahul Samant, the company\u2019s chief information officer. \u201cSo we\u2019re optimistic we\u2019ll get it done,\u201d Samant said in the video message. \u201cThere will be some things as Ed said, that we will do today, tomorrow to get to a better place by the end of the week.\u201d He said the IT staff is working \u201cfeverishly\u201d and \u201caround the clock\u201d to fix the problem. Delta appears to still be in the dark about the whereabouts of their crew members. Crew members logging on to the company\u2019s computer system to sign up for flights receive prompts and questions that include: \u201cPlease enter below what airport code you are closest to,\u201d \u201cWhat is your current status?\u201d and \u201cPlease describe your current location.\u201d A person familiar with the airline\u2019s operations allowed CNN to see screen shots of the prompts. Delta would not comment on the screen shots. Delta is offering crew members premium pay, as well as additional assurances they will be able to travel back to their homes at the end of their work period, according to the screen shots viewed by CNN. The premium pay and assurances would be in place through Friday, another sign the staffing problem may not be fixed for several more days. Delta also declined to comment on these offers to crew members. The problems with the flight groundings and delays produced nightmares for travelers throughout the weekend. And they were only one part of the \u201clargest IT outage in history\u201d that was caused by the CrowdStrike, which shut down an estimated 8.5 million computers running Windows software worldwide, disrupting hospital operations, package deliveries, banking and retail transactions. CrowdStrike said late Sunday that \u201ca significant number\u201d of those affected computers \u201care back online and operational.\u201d But in the case of affected airlines, it is not just computers that need to be fixed. It can take longer to get crews needed to fly planes in the right cities to again staff flights. \u201cAn airline is kind of like your circulatory system. If it stops, even for just a short time, the blood isn\u2019t where it\u2019s supposed to be,\u201d said airline consultant Michael Boyd. \u201cGetting airplanes back to where they need to be, people where they need to be\u2026all of that takes time. So even if it\u2019s disrupted for only a few hours, it can take five times as long to make it right.\u201d The problem for passengers was made worse by the busy summer travel season, according to Bastian\u2019s message to Delta customers. \u201cThe technology issue occurred on the busiest travel weekend of the summer, with our booked loads exceeding 90%, limiting our reaccommodation capabilities,\u201d he wrote. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg spoke with Bastian on Sunday about the problems and taking steps to compensate passengers, according to a statement from the Department of Transportation. \u201cI have made clear to Delta that we expect the airline to provide prompt refunds to consumers who choose not to be rebooked, and free rebooking and timely reimbursements for food and overnight hotel stays to consumers affected by the delays and cancellations, as well as adequate customer service assistance to all of their passengers,\u201d said Buttigieg in the DOT statement. \u201cNo one should be stranded at an airport overnight or stuck on hold for hours waiting to talk to a customer service agent.\u201d Bastian told Delta passengers in the message that the airline would \u201ccontinue to offer meal vouchers, hotel accommodations and transportation where available. And as a gesture of apology, we\u2019re also providing impacted customers with Delta SkyMiles and travel vouchers.\u201d The problems at Delta are similar to the problems that occurred at Southwest Airlines over the end-of-year holiday travel period in 2022 when it had to cancel nearly 17,000 flights over the course of more than a week. In that instance the problem was attributed to its crew scheduling system, which Southwest unions criticized as \u201cantiquated\u201d and which Southwest executives vowed to fix in the wake of the service meltdown.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/22/business/delta-canceled-flights-computer-problems/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/23/2024", "section": "us"}}

We will make sure the process is fair, because, as it stands, no candidate has secured a majority of the delegates to the convention.\u201d Democratic National Committee Chair Jaime Harrison also pledged to the party being \u201ccommitted to an open and fair nominating process\u201d that \u201creflects the dedication to democracy our party stands for.\u201d According to DNC officials and a document obtained by CNN, candidates will need to declare their interest in becoming the Democratic Party\u2019s nominee for president by filing a formal\u00a0declaration\u00a0of candidacy,\u00a0meeting\u00a0party and legal qualifications to be president, and\u00a0gathering\u00a0at least 300 delegate signatures, with no more than 50 from a single state. The window of time for candidates to declare their interest will be short, one DNC official said, and would end by this week. Under the proposal, the DNC will share with delegates a candidate directory, which will include names and contact information for candidates to allow delegates to opt into information from campaigns. However, while the DNC intends to have a Democratic nominee chosen by August 7, exactly when virtual voting would begin has yet to be determined and would depend on factors like how many candidates are ultimately able to obtain support from the necessary 300 delegates. If only one candidate were to reach that threshold, for example, the party could move more quickly to begin the virtual voting process, the official said. If multiple candidates qualify, there would be a period of a few days for candidates to make their case to delegates. A date for the start of the virtual voting process, therefore, has not yet been set, but it could be as early as August 1. Party officials were less specific about the timing of the vice-presidential nomination, saying that while they would give the future nominee the ability to finalize the choice by August 7, the exact schedule would be up to the candidate. The rules will allow for candidates to file the necessary paperwork and to gather the signatures electronically. To win the nomination, a candidate will have to have the support of a majority of pledged delegates to the convention \u2013 1,976 out of 3,949 pledged delegates, party officials said. While all delegates will receive ballots, votes cast by superdelegates \u2013 senior Democrats who serve as delegates by virtue of their position \u2013 will be counted on the first ballot only if one candidate has the support of enough pledged delegates to make up a majority of the full convention. That could be determined either by a candidate winning enough votes during remote balloting, or by gathering that many signatures. The convention rules committee will vote Wednesday on the proposed rules, a Democratic official said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/22/politics/democrats-dnc-process-nominee/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/23/2024", "section": "us"}}

And the party\u2019s best-known governors, several of whom had been seen as potential challengers, announced their support for Harris \u2014 making clear that the biggest remaining question about the 2024 Democratic ticket is who Harris will choose as her running mate. Harris, who will hold a campaign event in Milwaukee on Tuesday, staked her claim to the party\u2019s standard-bearer role with an electric speech Monday evening, as she visited the campaign\u2019s headquarters in Delaware. The vice president informed staffers who had been working for the Biden-led campaign that they\u2019d remain onboard \u2014 and that campaign chair Jen O\u2019Malley Dillon and campaign manager\u00a0Julie Ch\u00e1vez Rodr\u00edguez would remain at the helm. And she laid out her case against Trump, invoking a host of the former president\u2019s scandals and legal troubles. She pointed to her time as a district attorney and California attorney general, saying that she \u201ctook on perpetrators of all kinds.\u201d \u201cPredators who abused women, fraudsters who ripped off consumers, cheaters who broke the rules for their own game,\u201d Harris said. \u201cSo hear me when I say, I know Donald Trump\u2019s type.\u201d In her first day as a candidate, Harris raised $81 million, the campaign announced Monday, saying it was the largest 24-hour raise by any candidate ever. The huge haul underscored grassroots enthusiasm for a shake-up to the Democratic 2024 ticket. According to the campaign, more than 880,000 \u201cgrassroots supporters\u201d donated, with 60% making their first contributions of the 2024 cycle. Democratic donation-processing site ActBlue called it \u201cthe biggest fundraising day of the 2024 cycle.\u201d The Democratic super PAC Future Forward secured $150 million in commitments from donors in the 24 hours after Biden announced his decision, a senior aide to the group said.\u00a0The commitments came from donors who were either uncommitted, unsure or previously stalled, the aide added. Four\u00a0governors of must-win Midwestern states \u2014 Michigan\u2019s Gretchen Whitmer, Minnesota\u2019s Tim Walz,\u00a0Wisconsin\u2019s Tony Evers\u00a0and Illinois\u2019 JB Pritzker \u2014 have endorsed Harris. They join endorsements from Kentucky\u2019s Andy Beshear, North Carolina\u2019s Roy Cooper, California\u2019s Gavin Newsom and Pennsylvania\u2019s Josh Shapiro. Many of those governors could be considered for the party\u2019s vice presidential nomination. Meanwhile, the cascade of endorsements for Harris\u2019 candidacy that had begun Sunday afternoon was accelerating on Capitol Hill.\u00a0Harris has the support of\u00a0more than 40 Democratic senators and nearly 100 House members\u00a0\u2014 numbers that had grown rapidly throughout Monday morning. A significant one came from former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who said in a Monday afternoon statement that her \u201centhusiastic support for Kamala Harris for President is official, personal and political.\u201d Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, the top-ranking Democrats in each chamber, were set to endorse Harris\u00a0soon, according to multiple sources familiar with the decision. Harris has the support of more than\u00a040\u00a0Democratic senators and\u00a0nearly 100\u00a0House members \u2014 numbers that had grown rapidly throughout\u00a0the day\u00a0Monday. She also has the support of the political arms of the Congressional Black Caucus, Congressional Hispanic Caucus and Congressional Progressive Caucus, as well as two key labor unions, Service Employees International Union and the American Federation of Teachers. And\u00a0growing numbers of\u00a0state delegations to next month\u2019s Democratic National Convention \u2014 Tennessee, North Carolina, South Carolina,\u00a0Louisiana, New Hampshire, Maryland, Kentucky, Florida and Pennsylvania\u00a0\u2014 announced that they are backing Harris. Support for the vice president came across the party\u2019s ideological spectrum \u2014 from moderate populists, including Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown, one of the most endangered Democratic incumbents on the ballot this fall, to progressives, including Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Democratic congressional leaders had remained quiet so far \u2014 but there were signs that could soon change. Massachusetts Rep. Katherine Clark and California Rep. Pete Aguilar, the second- and third-ranking House Democrats, endorsed Harris on Monday morning. The hour-by-hour endorsements of Harris from Democratic governors, senators, Cabinet officials and state delegations is unfolding by design, with the hope of reaching a majority of delegates by Wednesday, two people familiar with the process tell CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s a coordinated drumbeat,\u201d a senior Democratic aide working on the effort said. \u201cThat sound Democrats hear is the party uniting around the vice president.\u201d How Harris and her allies mobilized Joe Biden\u2019s 1:46 p.m. ET Sunday announcement that he would not seek a second term ignited a frenetic push by Harris to consolidate the support of a party that had been in crisis in the weeks since the president\u2019s dismal performance during his June 27 debate with former President Donald Trump. Harris knew what Biden had decided: She\u2019d had multiple phone calls with Biden on Sunday, a person familiar with the matter said. Once the announcement came, Harris \u2014 wearing a hoodie from her alma mater, Howard University, workout sweats and sneakers \u2014 made more than 100 phone calls over 10 hours. Alongside her family and staff, the vice president\u2019s calls included lawmakers, governors and leaders of influential labor, advocacy and civil rights groups. Those calls included former Presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton, as well as former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. The Clintons, in a statement Sunday, endorsed Harris; Obama did not, deferring to the party\u2019s process. Harris also called her pastor, Amos Brown III, who, along with his wife, prayed over her, the source said. She ate pizza with anchovies \u2014 Harris\u2019 go-to topping \u2014 for dinner. In those phone calls, Harris made clear that while she was grateful for Biden\u2019s endorsement, she planned to earn the Democratic nomination in her own right. That echoes the statement she released following Biden\u2019s announcement to step aside. \u201cI am honored to have the President\u2019s endorsement and my intention is to earn and win this nomination,\u201d she wrote. Harris\u2019 supporters were also mobilizing. Harris\u2019 chief of staff Lorraine Voles and California Lt. Gov. Eleni Kounalakis led a call Monday morning with around 350 Democratic donors, fundraisers and supporters, a longtime Democratic fundraiser and supporter of Harris for many years told CNN. The source, who was on the call, said by gathering Harris\u2019 core supporters from her previous campaigns and newly interested donors, they hoped to get everyone to \u201crow the right way.\u201d The group Win With Black Women periodically holds Zoom calls \u2014 but the one that took place Sunday evening had a different tone, with 44,000 people joining, according to its leaders. Longtime Democratic operative Donna Brazile said that she was in the process of gathering delegates to support Harris. \u201cI need all of you to sign your delegate pledge forms now,\u201d Brazile said on the call. She said voter registration and fundraising will be key in the days ahead. Washington, DC, Mayor Muriel Bowser also spoke on the call. \u201cI know what it\u2019s like to be in the crosshairs of Donald Trump,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have to defend our sister.\u201d Former Congressional Black Caucus Chairwoman Joyce Beatty and Texas Rep. Jasmine Crockett were also among the speakers. No serious challenger materializes yet Though some Democrats have held off on announcing endorsements, no serious challenger has emerged to take on Harris for the nomination ahead of the Democratic National Convention, which starts August 19 in Chicago. Any challenge might need to materialize even faster: Prior to Biden\u2019s departure from the race, the party had set up a virtual roll call to begin the first week of August. There are no signs at this point it intends to abandon those plans. Manchin, who had left the party earlier this year and is not seeking reelection, said Monday he will not rejoin the party and seek its nomination. CNN has previously reported the West Virginia senator was considering re-registering as a Democrat to throw his hat in the ring. But in an interview with CBS News on Monday, Manchin said he will not be a candidate. \u201cI could not believe that there was not going to be a primary process or a mini process. Other countries do it,\u201d Manchin said, adding that he believes Harris is too liberal but could be forced to the middle if she faces a challenge. New York City Democratic Mayor Eric Adams announced his support for Harris in an interview with MSNBC on Monday, reversing course just hours after he told CNN, \u201cthere\u2019s a process and we\u2019re going to follow that process,\u201d to determine the party\u2019s nominee. \u201cWe need real, clear, leadership, and she understands it,\u201d Adams told MSNBC. \u201cShe was in the position of looking over the border issue, so she understands some of the things that we need to do.\u201d And he offered a stirring endorsement of Harris\u2019 fitness to lead the ticket, urging advisers to \u201clet her be her.\u201d Running mate jockeying begins As of mid-morning Monday, as the swell of support for Harris continued to build, the biggest question might have been who she will choose as a running mate. Democratic lawyers are beginning their work conducting a deep, yet truncated, vetting process for potential vice presidential hopefuls, two people familiar with the matter told CNN, with siloed teams being established for the leading prospective candidates. Cooper, Shapiro and Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly are among the Democrats who have been asked to submit information about their finances, family histories and other personal details, two people familiar with the process said. They are part of a group that includes about 10 names, nearly all of whom are elected officials. Former Attorney General Eric Holder and his law firm Covington & Burling will handle vetting for Harris\u2019 running mate, a source familiar with the plans said. The audition process is also playing out in public, with Cooper and Beshear appearing on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe\u201d on Monday \u2014\u00a0with the intent that Harris was watching. An aide said she caught at least part of the conversations. Beshear, the two-term Kentucky governor, announced his support for Harris \u2014 and said he is open to joining Harris as her potential running mate, noting it\u2019s \u201cflattering to be a part\u201d of the conversation about the vice-presidential nomination. He also offered a window into how he\u2019d play the traditional attack-dog role of a running mate. At multiple points in the interview, Beshear attacked Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance, who has family ties to Beshear\u2019s home state of Kentucky. \u201cLet me just tell you that JD Vance ain\u2019t from here,\u201d Beshear said, referring to his home state, taking issue with how Vance described Appalachia in his best-selling memoir \u201cHillbilly Elegy.\u201d Beshear also attacked Vance for past comments expressing support for strict restrictions to abortion access, while touting Harris\u2019 record of supporting protections for reproductive health care. \u201cJD Vance calls pregnancy arising from rape \u2018inconvenient,\u2019\u201d Beshear said. \u201cNo, it\u2019s just plain wrong. He suggests that women should stay in abusive relationships. Now listen, a domestic abuser isn\u2019t a man, he\u2019s a monster, and no one should support anyone having to stay in those relationships.\u201d Cooper, the North Carolina governor who endorsed Harris on Sunday, also appeared on MSNBC on Monday, but deflected questions about whether he would be open to becoming her running mate. \u201cI think it\u2019s really important that we do keep the focus on her this week. The vice-presidential conversation needs to occur later,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cI want to make sure that Kamala Harris wins. I\u2019m going to work for her all over this country and do what I can to make sure we stop Donald Trump.\u201d Whitmer, the Michigan governor, told a local reporter she\u2019s \u201cnot planning to go anywhere\u201d when asked Monday if she would accept the vice presidential role if offered. Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, meanwhile, told CNN\u2019s Dana Bash that\u00a0\u201cobviously, if somebody asks, I\u2019d take a serious look at it,\u201d but that \u201cmy phone hasn\u2019t rung yet.\u201d \u201cIf they do the polling and it turns out that they need a 49-year-old, balding, gay Jew from Boulder, Colorado, they got my number,\u201d Polis quipped.

{"id": "2024_07_19_us_missouri-sandra-hemme-murder-conviction-overturned", "text": "Chillicothe, Missouri (AP) \u2013 A woman whose murder conviction was overturned after she served\u00a043 years of a life sentence\u00a0was released Friday, despite attempts in the last month by Missouri\u2019s attorney general to keep her behind bars. Sandra Hemme, 64, left a prison in Chillicothe, hours after a judge threatened to hold the attorney general\u2019s office in contempt if they continued to fight against her release. She reunited with her family at a nearby park, where she hugged her sister, daughter and granddaughter. \u201cYou were just a baby when your mom sent me a picture of you,\u201d she said. \u201cYou looked just like your mamma when you were little and you still look like her.\u201d Her granddaughter laughed. \u201cI get that a lot.\u201d Hemme had been the longest-held wrongly incarcerated woman known in the U.S., according to her legal team at the Innocence Project. The judge originally ruled on June 14 that Hemme\u2019s attorneys had established \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d of \u201cactual innocence\u201d and he overturned her conviction. But Republican Attorney General Andrew Bailey fought her release in the courts. \u201cIt was too easy to convict an innocent person and way harder than it should have been to get her out, even to the point of court orders being ignored,\u201d her attorney Sean O\u2019Brien said. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be this hard to free an innocent person.\u201d During a court hearing Friday, Judge Ryan Horsman said that if Hemme wasn\u2019t released within hours, Bailey himself would have to appear in court Tuesday morning. He threatened to hold the attorney general\u2019s office in contempt. He also scolded Bailey\u2019s office for calling the warden and telling prison officials not to release Hemme after he ordered her to be freed in her own recognizance. \u201cI would suggest you never do that,\u201d Horsman said, adding: \u201cTo call someone and tell them to disregard a court order is wrong.\u201d Hemme declined to address reporters after she was released. O\u2019Brien said she was going straight to the side of her father, who was hospitalized with kidney failure and recently moved to palliative care. \u201dThis has been a long time coming,\u201d he said of her release. O\u2019Brien said previously that delays had caused their family \u201cirreparable harm and emotional distress.\u201d There are still struggles ahead. \u201cShe\u2019s going to need help,\u201d he said, noting she won\u2019t be eligible for social security because she has been incarcerated for so long. Over the last month, a circuit judge, an appellate court and the Missouri Supreme Court all agreed Hemme should be released, but she was still held behind bars, leaving her lawyers and legal experts puzzled. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen it,\u201d said Michael Wolff, a former Missouri Supreme Court judge and professor and dean emeritus of Saint Louis University Law School. \u201cOnce the courts have spoken, the courts should be obeyed.\u201d The lone holdup to freedom came from the attorney general, who filed court motions seeking to force her to serve additional years for decades-old prison assault cases. The warden at the Chillicothe Correctional Center initially declined to let Hemme go, based on Bailey\u2019s actions. Horsman ruled on June 14\u00a0that \u201cthe totality of the evidence supports a finding of actual innocence.\u201d A\u00a0state appeals court ruled\u00a0on July 8 that Hemme should be set free while it continued to review the case. The next day, July 9, Horsman ruled Hemme should be released to go home with her sister. The Missouri Supreme Court on Thursday declined to undo the lower court rulings that allowed her to be released on her own recognizance and placed with her sister and brother-in-law. Bailey, a Republican facing opposition in the Aug. 6 primary election, responded with another request late Thursday, asking the Circuit Court to reconsider. Hemme was serving a life sentence at the Chillicothe Correctional Center for the 1980 stabbing death of library worker Patricia Jeschke in St. Joseph, Missouri. Hemme\u2019s immediate freedom was complicated by sentences she received for crimes committed while behind bars. She received a 10-year sentence in 1996 for attacking a prison worker with a razor blade, and a two-year sentence in 1984 for \u201coffering to commit violence.\u201d Bailey had argued that Hemme represents a safety risk to herself and others and that she should start serving those sentences now. Her attorneys countered that keeping her incarcerated any longer would be a \u201cdraconian outcome.\u201d Some legal experts agreed. Peter Joy, a law professor at the Washington University School of Law in St. Louis, said the effort to keep Hemme in prison was \u201ca shock to the conscience of any decent human being,\u201d since evidence strongly suggests she didn\u2019t commit the crime. Bailey\u2019s office did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment Friday. Bailey, who was appointed attorney general after Eric Schmitt was elected to the U.S. Senate in 2022, has a history of opposing overturning convictions, even when local prosecutors cite evidence of actual innocence. Horsman,\u00a0after an extensive review, concluded in June that Hemme was heavily sedated and in a \u201cmalleable mental state\u201d when investigators repeatedly questioned her in a psychiatric hospital after the killing. Her attorneys described her ultimate confession as \u201coften monosyllabic responses to leading questions.\u201d Other than the confession, no evidence linked her to the crime, her trial prosecutor said. The St. Joseph Police Department, meanwhile, ignored evidence pointing to Michael Holman \u2014 a fellow officer, who died in 2015 \u2014 and the prosecution wasn\u2019t told about FBI results that could have cleared Hemme, so it was never disclosed before her trials, the judge found. Evidence presented to Horsman showed that Holman\u2019s pickup truck was seen outside Jeschke\u2019s apartment, that he tried to use her credit card, and that her earrings were found in his home. Horsman, in his report, called Hemme \u201cthe victim of a manifest injustice.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/19/us/missouri-sandra-hemme-murder-conviction-overturned/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/23/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_07_22_investing_global-markets-rise-in-bidens-wake", "text": "Global markets made solid gains after President Joe Biden dropped out of the 2024 presidential election Sunday and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris as the Democratic nominee. European stocks saw an uptick and markets in the US closed higher following Biden\u2019s announcement. The Dow ended Monday higher by 128 points, or 0.3%. The S&P 500 closed up 1.1% and the Nasdaq gained 1.6%. European markets also closed higher, and Asian markets closed mostly lower. US Treasuries rose slightly, trimming yields, and the dollar was softer against major currencies. Much of Monday\u2019s gain came from a rebound in tech stocks. Nvidia gained 4.8% while chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices was up 2.8%. Shares of CrowdStrike, the cybersecurity firm behind a crippling global tech outage on Friday, plunged 13.5%. The stock has lost 27% of its value since Thursday. The Trump trade falters Significant doubt about Biden\u2019s ability to beat former President Donald Trump led Wall Street to begin to price in a Trump victory in November. That became apparent with so-called Trump trades, in which investors bought up stocks they believed Trump\u2019s tariff-heavy agenda could benefit \u2014 and they likewise sold off stocks related to green energy and other industries traders believed Trump\u2019s policies could hurt. Meanwhile, a large number of economists have predicted Trump\u2019s policies would\u00a0make America\u2019s inflation problem worse, and he would balloon the US deficit. As Trump\u2019s fortunes appeared to advance in recent weeks, US Treasury prices fell and yields rose, which they often do in anticipation of higher inflation. With the Democratic party now apparently coalescing around Vice President Kamala Harris as its likely nominee, some of those Trump trades could begin to unwind \u2014 or at least go on hiatus until new polling begins to show whether or not Harris appears to stand a better chance against Trump than Biden did. With fewer than 100 days until the US election in November, Sunday\u2019s upheaval could have sent uncertain investors into a worry spiral. But \u201cthe fact that Biden endorsed Kamala Harris reduces uncertainty,\u201d said Jay Hatfield, CEO at Infrastructure Capital Advisors. He expects a muted market reaction instead. Uncertainty remains Last week was exceptionally rough for markets. The S&P 500 notched its worst three-day performance of 2024 and Europe\u2019s STOXX 600 logged its worst weekly performance since October, according to Deutsche Bank data. Some analysts worry that market churn could continue as we get closer to the election. \u201cMarkets are increasingly focused on the US presidential election in November,\u201d wrote Deutsche Bank\u2019s Henry Allen in a research note on Monday. \u201cBut there\u2019s heightened uncertainty about the outcome, particularly after President Biden has just become the first incumbent President to withdraw since Lyndon Johnson in 1968.\u201d Moreover, the S&P 500 has declined in every September since 2020, he said. Over the last three years, September was the worst month of the year for the index. Still, markets remain unusually strong. The S&P 500 has been higher for 28 of the last 38 weeks, something we haven\u2019t seen exceeded since 1989, he noted. Stocks tumbled\u00a0toward the end of last week as a turbulent election cycle and a global tech outage rocked technology stocks in particular.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/22/investing/global-markets-rise-in-bidens-wake/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/23/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_07_22_us_sonya-massey-police-shooting", "text": "Body-camera footage showing the fatal police shooting of Sonya Massey, a 36-year-old Black woman who had called 911 for help, was released publicly Monday in a case that has led to murder charges against a deputy. The 36-minute video released via the Illinois State Police includes body-camera footage from each of the two Sangamon County Sheriff\u2019s deputies who responded to Massey\u2019s house after midnight on July 6 after Massey called 911 to report a possible \u201cprowler\u201d at her home in Springfield, according to a court document filed by prosecutors. In the footage, deputy Sean Grayson and another deputy speak calmly with Massey in her home when she goes to the stove to turn off a pot of boiling water. She then picks up the pot and the other deputy steps back, \u201caway from your hot steaming water,\u201d he says. \u201cI rebuke you in the name of Jesus,\u201d she says in response. \u201cHuh?\u201d the deputy says. \u201cI rebuke you in the name of Jesus,\u201d she repeats. \u201cYou better f**king not or I swear to God I\u2019ll f**king shoot you in the f**king face,\u201d Grayson says. He then draws his firearm and points it at her, and she ducks and says, \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d while lifting the pot, the video shows. \u201cDrop the f**king pot!\u201d both deputies yell. Three shots are heard. After a few seconds of silence, one deputy says \u201cshots fired\u201d and calls for EMS. \u201cDude, I\u2019m not taking f**king boiling water to the f**king head. And look, it came right to our feet, too,\u201d Grayson says. Minutes after the shooting, Grayson speaks to another law enforcement figure. \u201cShe had boiling water and came at me with boiling water,\u201d he says in the video. \u201cShe said she was going to rebuke me in the name of Jesus and came at (me) with boiling water.\u201d CNN has reached out to Grayson\u2019s attorney for comment. The release of the video comes about two weeks after the fatal shooting and just days after Grayson was charged in her death. Grayson, 30, was indicted by a grand jury last week on three counts of first-degree murder and one count each of aggravated battery with a firearm and official misconduct. He has entered a not guilty plea and was denied pretrial release, according to court records. Massey is one of a number of Black women who have been killed by police in their own homes in recent years, including Breonna Taylor and Atatiana Jefferson. In a news conference Monday afternoon, civil rights attorney Ben Crump, who represents Massey\u2019s family, connected her death to other cases of police violence against Black people across the US. \u201cUntil we get justice for Sonya Massey, we rebuke this discriminatory criminal justice system in the name of Jesus,\u201d he said. Video shows lead-up and aftermath Grayson did not activate his body camera until after he fatally shot Massey, according to charging documents. The other deputy had activated his body camera when he first arrived at the scene, the documents state. According to footage from the other deputy\u2019s body camera, the incident began with the deputies walking around Massey\u2019s yard and finding a vehicle with broken windows. They then knock on the door and speak with her, and she struggles to understand and answer some questions about the vehicle and about herself. As they speak in her living room, the deputies note the pot on the lit stove and one says, \u201cwe don\u2019t need a fire while we\u2019re here.\u201d Massey gets up and turns off the stove and the shooting then follows. Immediately after the shooting, the video records Grayson telling his partner Massey would not need medical help. The other deputy says he\u2019s going to get a medical kit to help, but Grayson responds, \u201cNah, she\u2019s done. You can go get it but that\u2019s a headshot.\u201d Grayson later goes to his vehicle to get his own medical supplies. When he gets back to the house, he asks if there\u2019s anything he can do, but is told no. \u201cAll right, I\u2019m not even gonna waste my med stuff then,\u201d Grayson says. Next, Grayson leaves the house and speaks to a group of law enforcement officers outside. \u201cYeah I\u2019m good, this f**king b*tch is crazy,\u201d he says, according to the footage. In the news conference Monday, along with members of her family, Crump said Massey had mental health challenges but was not aggressive toward the deputies. \u201cShe needed a helping hand,\u201d he said. \u201cShe didn\u2019t need a bullet to the face.\u201d Massey\u2019s father, James Wilburn, said he initially received conflicting information from law enforcement. \u201cI was under the impression that a prowler had broken in and killed my baby. Never did they say that it was a deputy-involved shooting until my brother read it on the internet,\u201d Wilburn said. Officials criticize deputy\u2019s actions Since the shooting, local and state officials have criticized the deputy\u2019s actions as an unjustified use of deadly force. A review of the Illinois State Police investigation into the shooting \u201cdoes not support a finding that \u2026 Grayson was justified in his use of deadly force,\u201d the state\u2019s attorney for the county, John Milhiser, said in a July 17 news release. In a court document filed by the state last week, prosecutors said a \u201cuse-of-force\u201d expert had reviewed the body-camera footage and concluded the use of deadly force was not justified. \u201c(The expert) likened the scenario to an officer intentionally and unnecessarily putting himself in front of a moving vehicle and then justifying use of force because of fear of being struck,\u201d the prosecutors wrote. The sheriff\u2019s office said it has fired Grayson. \u201cIt is clear that the deputy did not act as trained or in accordance with our standards,\u201d the office said. CNN experts offered similar analysis. \u201cEffective policing comes down to good judgment\u00a0in highly stressful situations,\u201d said Josh Campbell, CNN security correspondent and former federal agent. \u201cAlthough being doused with scalding water could warrant the use of deadly force by an officer to stop a threat, in this video we certainly don\u2019t see officers attempting alternative options, such as moving away and creating distance between themselves and Massey.\u201d \u201cThere were a number of ways to avoid this starting with better tactics from the outset,\u201d said CNN Chief Law Enforcement and Intelligence Analyst John Miller, \u201cbut even if you forgive that and limit the observations to the last few seconds, there were still options of a calmer dialogue, more distance between the subject and them, a taser rather than a firearm.\u201d President Joe Biden said in a statement Monday that Massey\u2019s family \u201cdeserves justice.\u201d \u201cI am heartbroken for her children and her entire family as they face this unthinkable and senseless loss. Jill and I mourn with the rest of the country and our prayers are with Sonya\u2019s family, loved ones, and community during this devastating time,\u201d Biden said in a written statement. \u201cI commend the swift actions that were taken by the Springfield State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s office. While we wait for the case to be prosecuted, let us pray to comfort the grieving. Congress must pass the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act now. Our fundamental commitment to justice is at stake,\u201d the president added. Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul issued a statement Monday saying the footage was \u201chorrific\u201d and offering his sympathy to Massey\u2019s family. \u201cAs the community reacts to the release of the footage, I urge calm as this matter works its way through the criminal justice system,\u201d he said. \u201cIn Illinois we have made sure that the law mandates independent investigations after officer involved shootings. In this matter it appears that the investigation by the Illinois State Police and the subsequent referral to the Sangamon County State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s office have complied with the letter and spirit of the law by providing the appropriate transparency and moving toward accountability,\u201d Raoul added.

Luis Alfredo De La Rosa Rios, 29, Ernesto Cisneros, 22, and Jesse Contreras, 34, are allegedly members of the F-13 gang, according to a US Justice Department release. Rio\u2019s alleged girlfriend Haylee Marie Grisham, 18, was also charged. According to the complaint, Arroyos was house-hunting on Monday with his girlfriend when a black pickup truck drove up. Rios and Cisneros pointed guns at Arroyos and his girlfriend and removed items from both, including chains from Arroyos\u2019 neck.  There was an exchange of gunfire between Arroyos and the two suspects, after which Arroyos collapsed and the two suspects fled, the release said. Los Angeles County sheriff\u2019s deputies responded to the scene and took Arroyos to a hospital where he died.   The four defendants were in the vehicle and allegedly were at the scene of the robbery and the shooting, the complaint said. They are charged with violent crime in aid of racketeering, which carries a potential death penalty and a minimum sentence of life in federal prison without the possibility of parole.  CNN has reached out to the Los Angeles County Public Defender\u2019s office in an attempt to contact legal representation for the defendants and is awaiting a response. Arroyos, 27, \u201cwas starting a very promising career,\u201d LAPD Chief Michel Moore said Tuesday. He was with the department for three years and assigned to the Wilshire Division. \u201cHe found himself, after working a series of days in patrol, to have a day off, enjoying it with his girlfriend on a hunt for a house, a place to live, a place to buy and invest in this city and the future of this region,\u201d Moore said. Arroyos is survived by his mother and stepfather. \u201cHe was the only child, he had a promising future, a bright future that was taken away, viciously, over a street robbery,\u201d the chief said.  F-13 is a \u201clarge, multi-generational street gang that previously has been the subject of federal prosecutions, including two large racketeering cases,\u201d the US Attorney\u2019s office said in a news release.

{"id": "2024_07_22_politics_harris-declined-preside-netanyahu-address", "text": "Vice President Kamala Harris declined to preside over Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s address to Congress on Wednesday, a source familiar with the matter told CNN. The decision to skip the joint meeting underscores the tense relationship between the Biden administration and Netanyahu at a time when the war in Gaza has caused growing backlash from the left. An aide to the vice president said the two world leaders will meet separately later this week. Harris\u2019 aide cited a previously scheduled event\u00a0as the reason\u00a0for missing the speech Wednesday. A date for the Netanyahu-Harris meeting has not been announced, but it will be separate from President Joe Biden\u2019s planned meeting with the Israeli prime minister. The closely watched bilateral will mark Harris\u2019 first meeting with a world leader since Biden stepped aside from his reelection campaign and endorsed Harris\u2019 candidacy. Harris is expected to \u201ccontinue her intensive engagement on the conflict in Gaza,\u201d the aide said, noting that she is expected to underscore a commitment to ensuring Israel can defend itself, condemn Hamas\u2019 attack on October 7 and reiterate concerns about the humanitarian situation in Gaza. \u201cWe anticipate the Vice President will convey her view that it is time for the war to end in a way where Israel is secure, all hostages are released, the suffering of Palestinian civilians in Gaza ends, and the Palestinian people can enjoy their right to dignity, freedom, and self-determination,\u201d according to the aide. \u201cAnd they will discuss efforts to reach agreement on the ceasefire deal.\u201d On Wednesday, Harris is set to address Zeta Phi Beta sorority\u2019s Grand Boule in Indianapolis for a moderated conversation, an effort to engage Black women voters. \u201cHer travel to Indianapolis on July 24 should not be interpreted as a change in her position with regard to Israel,\u201d the aide said. Harris was not the only top Democrat to decline presiding over Netanyahu\u2019s speech. Senate President Pro Tempore Patty Murray, a Washington state Democrat, also declined to preside, according to a spokesperson. Instead, Senate Foreign Relations Chairman Ben Cardin, a Democrat from Maryland, will preside over Netanyahu\u2019s address on Capitol Hill, a source familiar told CNN. Netanyahu\u00a0landed in the Washington, DC, area on Monday afternoon, according to a\u00a0post by an Israeli Embassy official on X. He is expected to meet with the families of those held hostage by Hamas in Gaza \u2013 including Americans \u2013\u00a0on Monday evening. Netanyahu is also slated to meet with congressional leaders on Wednesday, including House Speaker Mike Johnson, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. Biden is expected to meet with Netanyahu on Thursday, a US official said, though the date of the meeting has been fluid as the US president recovers from Covid-19. Over the weekend, Biden announced he would end his bid for reelection and has endorsed Harris to be the Democratic nominee for president. This story has been updated with additional details.

{"id": "nba-rights-deal-match-tnt-amazon-wbd", "text": "Warner Bros. Discovery notified the NBA on Monday that it will pay roughly $1.8 billion per year to match an offer from Amazon to carry a package of the league\u2019s games, setting up a last-second buzzer-beating attempt by TNT\u2019s parent company to retain the broadcast rights to the games. \u201cWe have reviewed the offers and matched one of them,\u201d TNT Sports said in a statement. \u201cOur matching paperwork was submitted to the league today. We look forward to the NBA executing our new contract.\u201d The announcement comes as the NBA moves to renew its contracts with media partners, agreeing to 11-year deals with Disney, NBC and Amazon Prime Video\u00a0for a reported\u00a0$76 billion. Those deals, which were approved by the NBA\u2019s Board of Governors last week, notably did not include WBD, CNN\u2019s parent company, which currently broadcasts the league\u2019s games on the TNT network and Max streaming service. The governors\u2019 signoff on the deals started the clock on a five-day window for WBD, during which it could opt to match the league\u2019s other offers. While NBC\u2019s bid for the package  currently held by WBD far surpassed the current price it pays to air the games, WBD executives have repeatedly underscored that the company retains the right to match other offers, including a new third slimmer package of games won by Amazon. A person familiar with the matter confirmed WBD\u2019s matching offer Monday was for Amazon\u2019s bid, which includes regular season and playoff games. \u201cWe\u2019ve received WBD\u2019s proposal and are in the process of reviewing it,\u201d an NBA spokesperson said. It\u2019s unclear if the NBA will accept or reject WBD\u2019s offer, which the league intended for a streaming partner. In recent weeks, WBD executives have suggested that if the NBA declines to accept its matching offer, it could bring a lawsuit. The months of dealmaking and uncertainty has set off alarms both inside and out of WBD, raising the possibility of Turner Sports\u2019 nearly four decades as an NBA partner and home to the beloved \u201cInside the NBA\u201d show could come to an end. In its statement Monday, TNT said its offer to match Amazon\u2019s deal, \u201cwill allow fans to keep enjoying our unparalleled coverage, including the best live game productions in the industry and our iconic studio shows and talent, while building on our proven 40-year commitment for many more years.\u201d The high-profile deals, months in the making, represent a massive shakeup for the league and WBD, which has aggressively marketed the NBA as a cornerstone of its streaming platform, Max, to woo audiences away from competitors. The first sign of an upending to the carriage rights came earlier this year when WBD\u2019s exclusive negotiating window with the NBA expired in April without an agreement. That allowed other companies to vie for the coveted sports rights, considered by many to\u00a0be\u00a0the crown jewel in WBD\u2019s sports portfolio. As reports emerged that the league agreed to multi-billion dollar offers from other media companies, the fate of \u201cInside the NBA\u201d\u00a0 was thrown into question. In recent months, host Charles Barkley has publicly decried what he believed was WBD\u2019s\u00a0bungling of the NBA deal. \u201cThese people I work with, they screwed this thing up, clearly; and we have zero idea what\u2019s\u00a0gonna\u00a0happen,\u201d Barkley said in May. \u201cI don\u2019t feel good, I\u2019m not\u00a0gonna\u00a0lie \u2014 especially when they came out and said we bought college football. I was like, \u2018Well damn, they could\u2019ve used that money to buy the NBA.\u201d Barkley\u2019s comments came after WBD inked a new five-year deal with Disney\u2019s ESPN to air two first-round College Football Playoff games this season and two additional quarterfinal matchups beginning in 2026, adding to the company\u2019s live sports offerings. The showdown over the NBA rights comes as legacy media companies struggle to retain audiences, with viewers opting to leave cable bundles behind in favor of cheaper, on-demand content. As streaming services like Netflix have continued to attract and further carve up audiences, live sporting events have continuously proved impervious to declines in viewership felt across traditional television. While WBD maintains the rights to the\u00a0NCAA March Madness\u00a0tournament, along with the\u00a0MLB,\u00a0NHL\u00a0and\u00a0NASCAR, the NBA remains crucial to the media conglomerate. The cable channel TNT has built a programming slate around the NBA games, most notably the highly rated \u201cInside the NBA\u201d show featuring Barkley, Ernie Johnson, Kenny Smith and Shaquille O\u2019Neal. Asked last week about the fate of WBD\u2019s broadcast rights, NBA Commissioner Adam Silver told reporters, \u201cI don\u2019t know yet.\u201d \u201cMuch of it is outside my control,\u201d he added. \u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d ", "source": "http://cnn.com/nba-rights-deal-match-tnt-amazon-wbd/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/23/2024", "section": "us"}}

{"id": "2024_07_19_us_houston-surrogacy-escrow-company-fraud-scheme-lawsuit", "text": "Arielle Mitton\u2019s world turned upside down when she learned the $50,000 she borrowed to pay for surrogacy had disappeared from her escrow account. \u201cThat was the hardest day for me,\u201d she told CNN in a video chat. \u201cI couldn\u2019t eat. I couldn\u2019t sleep.\u201d Her surrogate was 12 weeks pregnant, and in a cloud of emotional confusion, she remembers reporting the alleged fraud to at least 10 federal and state law enforcement agencies and calling her bank asking for loan forgiveness. But she says the answer was the same. No one could help her. \u201cI just felt alone. I felt abandoned,\u201d she said. The lawsuit claims Surrogacy Escrow Account Management LLC, or SEAM, and its owner, Dominique Side, systemically misappropriated millions of escrow dollars, allegedly using the funds to enrich herself and fund side businesses \u2013 including a clothing line and a career as a rap and R&B singer and producer. Mitton is one of nearly two dozen families listed\u00a0in a lawsuit accusing the owner of a Houston-based surrogacy escrow company of stealing millions of dollars from their accounts, intended to pay their surrogates and cover medical expenses, to fund her lavish lifestyle. The escrow funds also paid for Side\u2019s \u201clavish trips all over the world,\u201d designer clothing, luxury vehicles, real estate, and membership at the \u201cSoho House,\u201d a chain of private clubs, the filing alleges. The lawsuit was initially filed by one family last month, but 22 additional families across the country \u2013 as well as prospective parents in France and Italy \u2013 asked to join the lawsuit, the plaintiffs\u2019 attorney announced Tuesday, claiming there are \u201chundreds more families\u201d victimized by SEAM\u2019s conduct. The lawsuit alleges Side and the other defendants \u201chave lured families and their surrogates into entering into a fiduciary relationship with SEAM so they could steal their escrow funds\u201d for their benefit. SEAM provides surrogacy escrow account management services to couples and women who have agreed to act as their surrogates. The company has an obligation as the intended parents\u2019 escrow agent to hold escrow funds, review the expenses incurred by their surrogates and distribute payments to the surrogate, the lawsuit states. During a court hearing on Wednesday, a judge issued a temporary injunction, ordering funds and assets of the defendants be frozen for the duration of the lawsuit. A trial in the case has been scheduled to begin in January 2025, according to the judge\u2019s order. Last month, the FBI\u00a0said in a news release\u00a0it was \u201cseeking to identify potential victims\u201d of SEAM and asked any other\u00a0potential victims to fill out an online form. The lawsuit, filed in June in the district court of Harris County in Texas, names Side as a defendant, along with one of her business partners, Anthony Hall and Life Escrow, LLC,\u00a0an escrow company created by Hall. The judge\u2019s order says in March, Hall formed a new escrow company called Life Escrow, LLC, which is located at the same business address as SEAM. Dominique and SEAM \u201cmay have transferred any escrow funds remaining in SEAM\u2019s accounts\u201d as of June 14 to bank accounts in the name of Life Escrow, according to the judge\u2019s order. CNN has reached out to Hall for comment on the lawsuit and\u00a0did not receive a response.\u00a0But in a statement posted on his Facebook page, Hall said he defended himself from the accusations in court and has agreed \u201cto turn over specific assets I control that can be traced to the alleged mismanagement by Ms. Side. \u201cI also presented a sworn affidavit from Ms. Side that states I have no insight or access to any of the funds or, processes of SEAM. Also, it states that no monies have been transferred to me fraudulently,\u201d Hall said. Hall added Life Escrow was a passion project he started in 2023, \u201chas no financial accounts, or clients,\u201d and was \u201cnot a front for illegal activity.\u201d In an automatic reply to an email sent by CNN, Side said she and her company \u201chave been notified that we are subject to an active investigation by federal authorities.\u201d \u201cUnder advice of counsel, I am not permitted to respond to any inquiries regarding the investigation,\u201d her reply continued. In a statement on behalf of the families, attorney Marianne Robak said: \u201cThis is an important step for our legal team as we fight to help those affected by this scheme receive the recovery and answers they deserve.\u201d \u201cWe will continue to investigate where the money went and the best course of action to hold the defendants accountable for their deceitful actions,\u201d the statement continued. Defendants\u2019 actions \u2018nothing short of evil,\u2019 lawsuit says The lawsuit describes the defendants\u2019 actions as \u201cnothing short of evil,\u201d and says more than 800 families who belong to a private Facebook group for victims of the alleged scheme have been defrauded by SEAM and its owner for over $16 million. Mindy and Aaron Herstein, who are not part of the lawsuit but who are members of the\u00a0Facebook\u00a0group, told CNN they are down $50,000 after using SEAM\u2019s escrow services to pay a surrogate who is now 24 weeks pregnant.\u00a0They say after a devastating stillbirth and health problems, they chose surrogacy as it was still their dream to have a child. \u201cWe are heartbroken and\u00a0devastated\u00a0about losing the money that was supposed to be safely managed in a trusted escrow account for our surrogate, as that is how she was paid. Now we are down 50K, and I do not see this money ever being returned. I feel for everyone going through this at this time,\u201d Mindy told CNN. The families each\u00a0deposited between $31,000 and $100,000 into a SEAM escrow account, only some of which was used to pay surrogates, the lawsuit said. \u201cTroubles with SEAM came to light in June when expectant parents who had each deposited tens of thousands of dollars to pay women carrying their children learned instead that their money was apparently lost,\u201d the plaintiffs\u2019 attorney said in a Tuesday news release. \u201cInitially, it looked as though millions had vanished.\u201d The families were notified by SEAM on June 4 their accounts had been put \u201con hold\u201d by Capital One Bank due to \u201cfraudulent charges,\u201d the judge\u2019s order states. Ten days later, Side informed all the company\u2019s clients in an email: \u201cDue to legal action all operations have been placed on hold. At this time, I am unable to provide further details regarding the matter,\u201d according to the order. Arielle Mitton says she and her husband Andrew have three children and after struggling for three years with infertility, found a road to surrogacy to complete her family. They connected with their surrogate in November 2023 and established their escrow account with SEAM in March by depositing $50,000. One month later, the embryo was successfully transferred to the surrogate and the pregnancy was confirmed in May. \u201cI was elated. I was so happy,\u201d Arielle told CNN. But her joy would soon turn to deep worry when the monthly payments from SEAM stopped in June. Since then, Arielle says she started picking up extra shifts at work, is in talks with her surrogate about an alternative payment plan, and has set up a\u00a0GoFundMe\u00a0page. But the page has only raised about $5,000 of her $38,000 goal. SEAM owner used funds to launch music career, clothing line, suit says The judge cited evidence showing SEAM\u2019s escrow accounts do not have enough funds to pay the families\u2019 escrow fees, and the 23 families incurred damages ranging from roughly $12,400 to $90,400 \u2013 totaling over $1 million, not including attorney fees. \u201cThe evidence shows that it is likely \u2013 and probable \u2013 that SEAM misappropriated millions of its clients\u2019 escrow funds,\u201d the judge wrote. The judge determined the intended parents have a probable right to recovering their claims because it appears likely the defendants transferred SEAM\u2019s assets \u201cin order to hinder, delay or defraud SEAM\u2019s creditors.\u201d The families\u2019 forensic accountant reviewed bank records showing SEAM transferred the escrow funds into an operating account, most of which was then transferred to other bank accounts, the order says. Bank records show Side transferred more than $2.2 million to launch her career as \u201cDom,\u201d a \u201cracy rap and R&B singer and music producer,\u201d according to the filing. She allegedly used some of the funds to create music videos and social media content. The records also show SEAM transferred nearly $5 million to pay for a credit card, which \u201cappears to be related\u201d to a music studio owned by Side and Hall, along with $275,000 to Side\u2019s clothing line. In October 2023, a designer clothing company named Nikki Green, LLC \u2013 partially owned by Side and Hall \u2013 showcased its clothing line at Fashion Week in Las Vegas, which was funded with the parents\u2019 escrow funds, the lawsuit says. The lawsuit alleges the defendants committed fraud by failing to disclose the whereabouts and the status of their client\u2019s funds, as part of a larger scheme to defraud the families of their escrow funds.

{"id": "2024_07_22_business_misinformation-kamala-harris", "text": "Within minutes of\u00a0President\u00a0Joe Biden endorsing\u00a0Vice President\u00a0Kamala Harris to replace him on the Democratic Party\u2019s ticket on Sunday, the internet crackled with lies, altered photos and other misleading claims about Harris. Some supporters of former President Donald Trump \u2013 the Republican nominee in the November election \u2013 even suggested Biden was the victim of a coup. Meanwhile, a slew of slickly edited pro-Harris videos quickly proliferated on social media as her backers tried to capitalize on the moment. The vitriol and counter-punches are a likely preview of the final three months of the presidential campaign, where a furious battle to shape and smear Harris\u2019 image will play out at a moment where social media platforms have weakened guardrails on disinformation. \u201cAs Kamala Harris becomes increasingly likely to be the presumptive presidential nominee for the Democratic Party and gains more public spotlight, the corresponding amount of disinformation and misleading rhetoric will grow exponentially,\u201d Erik Nisbet, a professor at Northwestern University\u2019s School of Communication, told CNN. On X, owner Elon Musk fanned an antisemitic conspiracy theory by replying to a photo of Harris and Alexander Soros, son of the billionaire megadonor George Soros, by suggesting that Harris would be a \u201cpuppet\u201d of the Soros family. Musk endorsed Trump this month and has been pumping out pro-Trump content to his roughly 190 million followers. Photoshopped images of Harris also circulated. One image of Harris posing with her husband had been edited to make it appear like the vice-president had posed with Jeffrey Epstein, the deceased financier and accused sex trafficker. On X, the hashtag \u201cShe\u2019s Indian\u201d was trending in the hours after Biden\u2019s announcement, with\u00a0some users advancing a false\u00a0\u00a0smear of Harris that she is \u201cnot\u00a0Black\u201d (Harris\u2019 mother\u00a0was born\u00a0in\u00a0India and her father\u00a0was born\u00a0in Jamaica). A review by social media analytics firm PeakMetrics of nearly 175,000 posts on X between 6 and 7 pm ET on Sunday that mentioned Harris in relation to Biden\u2019s announcement found that 8.3% of the posts used \u201cracialized\u201d language in referring to Harris, while 4.5% posts used \u201csexualized\u201d language. Biden\u2019s likeness was also exploited in the aftermath of his announcement, which came via a post on social media and not televised address. A fake expletive-laden video purportedly of Biden announcing his decision to leave the race began circulating on X. PBS News, whose logo was featured in the video, issued a statement describing the video as a \u201cdeepfake,\u201d adding, \u201cPBS News did not authorize the use of this video and we do not condone altering news video or audio in any way that could mislead the audience.\u201d On TikTok, pro-Harris videos surged, many referencing a coconut meme that has become synonymous with support of her candidacy. (In 2023, Harris gave a speech on advancing opportunities for Hispanic Americans that included a line that she attributed to her mother about understanding the context of young people\u2019s lives: \u201cYou think you just fell out of a coconut tree?\u201d) One TikTok video, a round-up of Harris memes, had over 712,000 likes and 73,000 shares. Harris\u2019 team has also embraced a viral post from British pop singer Charli XCX that referred to Harris as \u201cbrat,\u201d a concept that includes women and queer empowerment. Russian state media was also quick to react to Biden\u2019s decision to drop out. Sputnik, one of a number of pro-Kremlin mouthpieces, falsely suggested in a tweet that Ukrainian President\u00a0Volodymyr Zelensky\u00a0had been a \u201ccurse\u201d on Biden. \u201cI don\u2019t think Kremlin-aligned accounts will drive conversations related to this news,\u201d Joseph Bodnar, a researcher who tracks pro-Kremlin media, told CNN. \u201cBut they\u2019re certainly happy to boost divisive domestic narratives.\u201d Foreign operatives will have a hard time outpacing the real-life twists and turns around the US presidential campaign, according to some experts. \u201cImagine being a foreign disinfo/information operations actor trying to compete with the actual news this election cycle,\u201d quipped Shane Huntley, a cyber threat intelligence expert at Google, on X.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/22/business/misinformation-kamala-harris/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/23/2024", "section": "us"}}

Sherry Holtz, who was 50 at the time of her death, was found dead on December 4, 1999, a day after she was last seen at a bar in Sanford, Florida, authorities said at a Friday news conference. A person collecting cans in the woods discovered Holtz\u2019s body lying on a concrete slab about 20 feet into a wood line in Sanford, according to Sanford Police Department spokesperson Bianca Gillett. \u201cThis was \u2026 there\u2019s no other way to describe it but a brutal homicide,\u201d Gillett said. Holtz\u2019s neck was cut and there were signs of strangulation, blunt force trauma and sexual battery, authorities said. A lock blade knife was found near her body with blood and other DNA on it, but since the samples were not large enough, it was difficult to perform testing in 2000, according to Gillett. Investigators preserved the knife and reopened the case in May 2023. Authorities confirmed last month the blood on the knife was Holtz\u2019 and additional DNA on the knife belonged to Gary Durrance, 74. Durrance, who was Holtz\u2019s longtime boyfriend, was arrested on Thursday and charged with second-degree homicide, Gillett said. CNN has been unable to determine if Durrance has obtained legal representation at this time. The couple lived at a home in Sanford with three other people who were interviewed by investigators at the time of the homicide. The roommates said the couple had an argument and on December 2, 1999, Durrance kicked Holtz out of the house. Authorities say Durrance had denied being with Holtz on the night of the homicide. The bar Holtz was last seen at was about half a mile away from where her body was later found, Gillett said. \u201cSherry Holtz was brutally murdered and left behind in the woods as if her life had no value. This was someone\u2019s mother, someone\u2019s daughter,\u201d Sanford police chief Cecil Smith said in a statement. \u201cDurrance will now face justice for the horrible and despicable things that he did,\u201d Smith said. \u201cI hope his arrest brings a little comfort to those that loved Sherry and have waited 24 years for this moment.\u201d Durrance is being held at Seminole County\u2019s John E. Polk Correctional Facility and has a court appearance scheduled for September 10, according to jail records. CNN\u2019s Chenelle Woody and Ashley R.

Global banks start reporting some service disruptions, including Australia\u2019s Commonwealth Bank, South Africa\u2019s Capitec, and the Bank of Israel. Australian lenders ANZ and Westpac were also impacted, according to Downdetector, a website that tracks cyber outages. Downdetector has also reported issues for New Zealand\u2019s ASB Bank. Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler issues an emergency declaration in response to the outage that affected Bureau of Emergency Communication\u2019s Computer Aided Dispatch system that is used for fielding emergency calls. The bureau begins taking calls manually, according to the mayor\u2019s office.

A spokesperson for Atlanta\u2019s Hartsfield Jackson International Airport said that systems were operational and the airport put in place additional customer service personnel to address the challenges they\u2019re facing. The spokesperson urged customers to \u201chave patience. We\u2019re trying to have grace and patience with all of the passengers. We\u2019re asking the same.\u201d Later Friday morning, Charlotte Douglas International Airport, an American Airlines hub, advises passengers to not go to the airport \u201cunless they have confirmed their flight information with the airline.\u201d Officials at Miami International Airport, another American Airlines hub, likewise warn travelers that US Customs and Border Protection operations have been affected nationwide, \u201cso international passenger arrivals are currently being processed manually at a slower pace.\u201d Between 9 a.m. and noon, federal agencies get involved and Biden is briefed A little before 9 a.m., Alaska State Troopers and Phoenix Police Department in Arizona say that service at its 911 centers are once again operational after emergency and non-emergency call centers were impacted. Portland\u2019s Computer Aided Dispatch system also comes back online at 9 a.m. \u201cAt no time was the community\u2019s ability to make 911 calls impacted,\u201d the mayor\u2019s office says in a news release. \u201cThe critical, life-saving services of public safety bureaus, including Police and Fire & Rescue, continue.\u201d The Federal Communications Commission announces it is working with federal agencies to provide assistance and determine the extent of the outage after it was made aware of \u201creports of a systems outage causing disruptions in service, including 911.\u201d President Joe Biden is briefed on the CrowdStrike outage and his team is in touch with CrowdStrike and impacted entities, says a White House official. The president\u2019s team is also engaged with agencies \u201cto get sector by sector updates throughout the day and is standing by to provide assistance as needed,\u201d according to the official. Around this time, an increasing number of federal agencies begin getting involved and reporting service disruptions. The US Department of Homeland Security says in a statement on X they are \u201cworking with CrowdStrike, Microsoft and our federal, state, local and critical infrastructure partners to fully assess and address system outages.\u201d Social Security offices close to the public, as the agency warns the public that \u201clonger wait times on our national 800 number are expected.\u201d In an internal memo viewed by CNN, the US Department of Justice says it is feeling some impact from the technology outage and, while it\u2019s working on workarounds, notes it does not have an \u201cestimated restoration time.\u201d Mail carriers UPS and FedEx tell CNN they were also impacted by the outage. UPS says its airline is operational and its drivers are on the roads, but there may be some service delays. A little after 11 a.m., CrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz says in a post on X, the firm \u201c(understands) the gravity of the situation and are deeply sorry for the inconvenience and disruption,\u201d adding that the incident was not a cyber attack, and that customers\u2019 data remains protected. \u201cThe issue has been identified and a fix has been deployed,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was an issue with a Falcon content update for Windows Hosts.\u201d Late morning through early afternoon: canceled doctors and DMV appointments The Massachusetts Department of Transportation announces that some Registry of Motor Vehicle operations are impacted. Other states also report impacts to their driving services, including Georgia, North Carolina, Texas and Tennessee. Around the same time, several of the nation\u2019s healthcare and hospital systems announce they have been impacted by the global outage, including Mass General Brigham hospital system in Massachusetts, Penn Medicine in Pennsylvania, Northwell Health in New York, and Emory Healthcare in Atlanta. While some hospitals report delays in services, others cancel some non-urgent surgeries and medical office visits. Several cancer centers, including Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston and New York\u2019s Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center say they have paused certain procedures and scheduled appointments. In British Columbia, the Provincial Health Services Authority (PHSA) announces its health system has been impacted, and is working on implementing contingency plans in order to ensure care for patients. Late afternoon sees more medical disruptions Around 4 p.m., New York Blood Center, a supplier of blood to approximately 200 hospitals in the Northeast United States, says it has put in place an emergency driving operation to distribute blood. \u201cThe test tubes are not making it onto planes from yesterday and today, requiring for us to drive them,\u201d New York Blood Center\u2019s senior vice president Andrea Cefarelli told CNN in a phone call. \u201cThere is going to be a 12-24 hour delay in getting the test results.\u201d Blood Centers of America, which rely on shipping companies like FedEx, says it is experiencing delays in reporting test results.\u00a0Executive Vice President Jenny Ficenec says blood usage may be down due to hospitals canceling elective surgeries, so the delay should not cause any shortages unless the problem persists. Blood\u00a0Assurance, which provides blood to hospitals in a number of Southeast states, including Tennessee, Georgia, North Carolina and Virginia, says its planned shipment of at least 20\u00a0platelets has been postponed due to flight delays and cancellations caused by the outage. \u201cWe are asking community members to help through donation,\u201d\u00a0Blood\u00a0Assurance says in an email to CNN. \u201cWe have a fantastic community of donors that always shows up when we need them.\u201d Meanwhile, CrowdStrike CEO Kurtz takes to social media again and promises customers \u201cfull transparency\u201d on how the global IT outage involving the company\u2019s software occurred. CrowdStrike would take steps \u201cto prevent anything like this from happening again,\u201d according to a statement on the company\u2019s website. Saturday morning: massive flight delays In a statement Saturday morning, Microsoft estimates the outage affected 8.5 million Windows devices.

Although airlines have largely resumed services, many tell customers that they expect disruptions in schedules to continue. As of noon on Saturday, at least 3,375 flights across the United States have been delayed and more than 1,200 canceled, according to data from flight tracker FlightAware. Atlanta\u2019s Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport, the nation\u2019s busiest airport, remains the most affected.

{"id": "2024_07_22_us_5-things-to-know-for-july-22-biden-drops-out-harris-ascends-vp-speculation-trump-reaction-campaign-cash", "text": "Welcome to a special edition of 5 Things, where we catch you up on the latest developments in President Joe Biden\u2019s stunning exit from the 2024 race. Here\u2019s what you need to know to\u00a0Get Up to Speed and On with Your Day. 1. Biden drops out President Joe Biden has ended his reelection bid and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris to succeed him. \u201cIt has been the greatest honor of my life to serve as your President,\u201d Biden wrote in a letter. \u201cWhile it has been my intention to seek reelection, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down,\u201d he added. Biden said he will finish his term and speak to the nation later this week in more detail. In a follow-up post, Biden praised Harris and urged Democrats to unite behind her. \u201cIt\u2019s time to come together and beat Trump. Let\u2019s do this,\u201d Biden wrote. His departure marks the first time a US president has dropped out of a reelection run in decades, recalling memories of President Lyndon Johnson deciding against seeking a second full term in 1968. 2. Harris ascends Vice President Harris said in a statement that she was \u201chonored\u201d to receive President Biden\u2019s endorsement and intends to \u201cearn and win\u201d the Democratic nomination. While it remains unclear if Harris will go unchallenged, she has already received a groundswell of support from Democratic lawmakers backing her ascension to become the first Black woman and first Asian American to lead the ticket of a major political party. The makeup of the ticket now rests with the roughly 4,700 delegates who will vote for a new standard-bearer at the Democratic National Convention in August. CNN has so far been able to identify more than 500 endorsements for Harris from Democratic delegates \u2014 and analysts say that number will grow as the party continues to coalesce around her 2024 campaign. 3. VP speculation With the election less than four months away, Harris must now quickly narrow her focus on a handful of potential running mates. Democratic Rep. Jim Clyburn, a close ally of President Biden\u2019s who has endorsed Harris, weighed in on several possible options for her to select as a running mate if she gets the nomination. The South Carolina Democrat said he likes Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and noted that North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper is in play. Some Democrats hope there will be an open race for Harris\u2019 running mate with a focus on other Democratic governors, including Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. Speculation is also swirling around Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, who joined a campaign staff call for Harris on Sunday night, sources told CNN. 4. Trump reaction Minutes after President Biden announced his exit from the race, former President Donald Trump described him as going \u201cdown as the single worst president by far in the history of our country.\u201d Trump\u2019s campaign managers echoed his remarks with a blistering statement tying Harris to the Biden administration\u2019s policies. Trump went on to suggest that the next debate move from the agreed-upon host network, ABC, to Fox News. Sources say Trump\u2019s team is planning a series of negative advertisements going after Harris\u2019 record \u2014 not only under the Biden administration but also during her time as a prosecutor and attorney general in California. Trump\u2019s campaign and allies also plan to argue that Harris is the person in the administration responsible for the border crisis, a key theme in GOP messaging this year. 5. Campaign cash Vice President Harris has raised $49.6 million in grassroots donations for her campaign since Biden endorsed her Sunday, campaign spokesperson Lauren Hitt said. Additionally, the Biden-Harris campaign amended filings with the FEC to rename its principal committee and declare Harris a candidate for president \u2014 meaning Harris could take control of the Biden-Harris campaign account, which had nearly $96 million cash in hand at the end of June. However, newly filed campaign reports show the Trump team entered July and the general election showdown with a bigger war chest of available cash. Still, Trump on Sunday issued an urgent fundraising appeal calling on donations from \u201cone million pro-Trump patriots.\u201d The message blasted out via text said: \u201cIf we\u2019re going to win back the White House, it will all be because of the momentum we built at this very moment \u2014 right here, right now!\u201d BREAKFAST BROWSE NASA rover makes a \u2018most unexpected\u2019 find on MarsWhile surveying the site of an ancient channel on Mars, NASA\u2019s Curiosity rover ran over a rock and accidentally exposed yellowish-green crystals.

{"id": "2024_07_22_us_microsoft-power-outage-crowdstrike-it", "text": "Hundreds of US flights were canceled Monday as carriers, particularly Delta Air Lines, work to recover four days after a global tech outage caused massive delays and left travelers stranded at airports around the nation. Delta is facing mounting pressure to get passengers back in the air, as it continues to rack up the majority of canceled US flights. US Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg has expressed frustration with the pace of Delta\u2019s recovery and its CEO has apologized to affected travelers. Over 1,000 flights into, within or out of the United States were canceled Monday, and over 9,000 were delayed, according to flight tracking site\u00a0FlightAware. Delta passengers have been slammed by more than 4,400 cancellations since Friday, including more than 950 as of Monday evening, by far the most of any airline. Delta declined to comment on the numbers, but in an update to customers Sunday afternoon, CEO Ed Bas\ufefftian said the company is working to restore operations for its customers. On Monday, Bastian told employees by video message: \u201cWe\u2019ve got everyone around this company working around the clock to get this operation where it needs to be,\u201d according to a news release. The airline \u2013 headquartered in Atlanta \u2013 said it hopes to \u201cmake it right,\u201d offering SkyMiles, vouchers and the right to request a refund, among other offers. Three of those customers, Nicole\u00a0DaSilva, Tiffany Denlinger and Melissa Levine were stranded at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport on Monday, surrounded by bags and lines of weary travelers \u2013 with no clear way to get home. Fresh off their vacation in Athens, Greece, the trio has been trying to get back to Arizona for two days. So far, all they have is a stack of canceled flight tickets. Denlinger has an electronic tracker in her luggage and said it\u2019s bounced from concourse to concourse at the Atlanta airport. But because she can\u2019t access her suitcase, she hasn\u2019t been able to use her laptop \u2013 leading to lost commissions and income. While Delta says it plans to cover hotel, meal or ground transportation for affected customers, the airline\u2019s policy says it does not compensate passengers for lost income due to canceled flights. DaSilva and Levine managed to find extended care for their dog back in Tucson only to have the air conditioning go out. Tucson is expected to hit a high of 104 degrees Monday. Now the couple is scrambling to find care for their dog somewhere out of the extreme heat. Denlinger said she believes the airline was not prepared for this situation \u201cand we\u2019re just kind of the guinea pigs to something truly catastrophic.\u201d Many stranded passengers are feeling the strain from days without access to their usual resources. Melissa Vestal, a North Carolina resident, told CNN affiliate WCCO on Monday she was running out of her prescription medicines after being stuck at the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport for the past three days. \u201cI prepared for an extra day with my medications but then I quickly saw that there\u2019s a possibility that I was going to be here a few days, so I\u2019ve been rationing out my medicines,\u201d Vestal said. \u201cActually, I don\u2019t have any for today, so I\u2019m hoping that we can find some luck today.\u201d Vestal told WCCO she was flying home on Delta after a trip to Alaska when the outage hit, and she was running on little sleep after waiting for hours in lines for flights over the weekend. Regardless, Vestal praised Delta\u2019s employees, calling them \u201cangels,\u201d and said she had a flight home booked for later Monday. The \u201clargest IT outage in history\u201d \u2013 prompted by a software update for Microsoft devices late Thursday into the early hours of Friday \u2013 impacted an estimated 8.5 million Windows devices worldwide, causing disorder at airports, outages for 911 services and challenges at health care facilities. While the CrowdStrike problem affected computers meant to check customers in for many airlines, it also disrupted\u00a0Delta\u2019s\u00a0crucial crew scheduling software. \u201cIn particular one of our crew tracking-related tools was affected and unable to\u00a0effectively process the unprecedented number of changes triggered by the system shutdown,\u201d Bastian said in the statement. It didn\u2019t help that the outage took place on what Bastian described as \u201cthe busiest travel weekend of the summer,\u201d with 90% of the airline\u2019s flights booked. Here\u2019s what we know about the outage and its continued effects. Outage caused by a CrowdStrike update The company said the outage was not caused by a security incident or a cyberattack, but rather a software defect. The issue was identified and isolated, and engineers deployed an update to fix the problem, CrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz said. Kurtz has apologized to customers and said the company is \u201cdeeply sorry for the inconvenience and disruption.\u201d In an update posted to LinkedIn late Sunday, CrowdStrike said \u201ca significant number\u201d of the 8.5 million devices were back online and operational. Overall costs from the outage could top $1 billion, Patrick Anderson, CEO of Anderson Economic Group, told CNN. Chaos and confusion for travelers On Sunday, more than 1,800 US flights were canceled and more than 9,900 delayed, according to FlightAware. Major hotels, including Marriott International and some Hiltons, were impacted both in regard to payment processing and delays to check in-processes. US-based carriers American Airlines, United Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Allegiant Air, Sun Country and Frontier Airlines all\u00a0reported issues on Friday. Delta paused all its flights Friday morning while its systems were offline, and more than 3,500 Delta and Delta Connection\u00a0flights\u00a0were canceled through Saturday, according to the airline. More than 1,200 Delta\u00a0flights\u00a0were canceled on Sunday, after the carrier canceled 1,208\u00a0flights\u00a0on Saturday, according to\u00a0FlightAware. Delta said it would not be allowing unaccompanied minors to travel until July 24, due to the outage. Experts are urging travelers who have been forced to cancel trips to look into refund options. New federal rules\u00a0say travelers deserve cash refunds when inconvenienced by their airline \u2013\u00a0not vouchers or travel credits. Buttigieg spoke with Delta\u2019s Bastian on Sunday afternoon as the air carrier continues to struggle with a high number of flight cancellations, according to the department. \u201cI have made clear to Delta that we expect the airline to provide prompt refunds to consumers who choose not to be rebooked, and free rebooking and timely reimbursements for food and overnight hotel stays to consumers affected by the delays and cancellations, as well as adequate customer service assistance to all of their passengers,\u201d Buttigieg said in a statement. Other airlines largely got back on track over the weekend, including one of the world\u2019s largest operators, Turkish Airlines, which said Saturday, \u201cThe global technical issue has been resolved. All our operations have returned to normal.\u201d The same day, Jetstar Japan, Hong Kong Express and Cebu Pacific airlines said their operations are gradually being restored after disruptions due to the global tech outage. Even with the flawed computer update rolled back, it\u2019s not a quick fix for airlines, which have computers at thousands of gates that will need to be individually rebooted, David Kennedy, cofounder of cybersecurity company Binary Defense,\u00a0told CNN on Saturday. \u201cIt\u2019s not just as simple as rebooting. There\u2019s a lot more steps and complexities in this that are involved,\u201d Kennedy said. \u201cThere\u2019s just not enough people at those airports, at those locations to go and do it.\u201d The Monday statement from Delta notes one of its most critical systems, \u201cwhich ensures all flights have a full crew in the right place at the right time \u2026 is deeply complex and is requiring the most time and manual support to synchronize.\u201d Amid the travel chaos, Buttigieg said earlier in a social media post Saturday he received reports of some airlines only offering flight credits to passengers for canceled flights. \u201cLet me be clear \u2013 you are entitled to get your money back promptly if your flight is canceled and you don\u2019t take a rebooking,\u201d Buttigieg said. Hospitals, 911 systems and government agencies affected The widespread usage of CrowdStrike\u2019s software meant the outage penetrated numerous industries, including emergency communications, government services and health care. Large hospital systems, including Mass General Brigham in Massachusetts, Penn Medicine in Pennsylvania, Mount Sinai Health System in New York all reported Friday they were affected by the outage. Emory Healthcare in Atlanta said it had delayed \u201cprocedures at ambulatory surgical centers and hospitals are delayed until our systems are stabilized.\u201d Some cancer centers, including Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston and New York\u2019s Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, also paused certain procedures and scheduled appointments. Several blood banks likewise experienced disruptions. And in a few areas, including Arizona and Alaska, 911 services were briefly disrupted before being restored. Government agencies, including Social Security offices and local Department of Motor Vehicles offices, also temporarily paused their operations due to the outage. Public transportation in Washington, DC, and Pennsylvania were affected but restored operations Friday.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/22/us/microsoft-power-outage-crowdstrike-it/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/23/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_07_22_politics_democratic-voters-kamala-harris-excitement", "text": "Live to 94 like Pat Levin, and you think maybe you have seen it all. Well, think again. \u201cWe\u2019ve been thrown into an emotional tailspin,\u201d is how Levin described President Joe Biden\u2019s abrupt departure from the 2024 campaign this weekend and his quick endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris. \u201cWhat next? An\u00a0enormous feeling of relief along with an enormous feeling of anxiety.\u201d Oh, plus this: \u201cYes, I support Harris.\u201d That was the consensus among Democrats in our All Over the Map project, which is tracking the 2024 campaign through the eyes and experiences of key voters. We heard relief that the president stepped away from a campaign that was on a path to likely defeat, worry that there is not enough time to turn things around, and support for Harris to take the baton. \u201cI\u2019ve always said it needs to be Vice President Harris,\u201d said Angela Lang, a community organizer in Milwaukee\u2019s Black neighborhoods. \u201cShe\u2019s the first Black woman VP and I think it would be seen as a sign of disrespect to have someone seemingly jump ahead of her.\u201d Michigan auto worker Tonya Rincon described herself as \u201ckind of stunned\u201d by Biden\u2019s decision but said Democrats have no time to waste. \u201cVice President Harris is the obvious choice,\u201d Rincon said. \u201cShe\u2019s experienced. Qualified. An extremely strong candidate and we need to get behind her immediately.\u201d There was overwhelming support for the California Democrat, but not unanimity. On the plus side for Harris: Democratic voters think she can rebuild lagging Biden support in the Black community and among younger voters, and they see her as a more vibrant and aggressive campaigner on abortion rights and other issues viewed as critical motivators for Democratic voters. But the doubts some voters raised about Harris underscore the challenges ahead, assuming she emerges as the Democratic nominee. They range from concerns the process will become too messy to worries that she is not the strongest candidate to contest critical battleground states. \u201cIf it\u2019s Kamala, her choice of a VP must be the absolute best,\u201d said Darrell Ann Murphy, a retiree in Pennsylvania\u2019s bellwether Northampton County. \u201cI wonder if the country is ready for a Black woman president,\u201d said Walter Robinson Jr., an African American union auto worker.\u00a0\u201cShe wasn\u2019t seen so much during her term (as vice president), so I\u2019m still processing the whole thing.\u201d Likewise, Carey Fulks, an African American from Atlanta, said: \u201cI don\u2019t believe Harris is a strong enough candidate to take the presidency this close to the election. \u2026 Democrats might rally around Harris, but I don\u2019t know about undecided voters.\u201d Some uncommitted voters not happy with \u2018absentee VP\u2019 A Harris campaign would face the same daunting challenge that factored into Biden\u2019s exit from the race: Former President Donald Trump is ahead in major battleground states, at least in polling taken before Biden bowed out. Any Democratic path to victory runs through Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, and leading Democrats in those states say the vice president has a lot to prove. Our project includes voters in 10 states, and several who are undecided or at least not firmly committed to a candidate were quick to take issue with Harris as Biden\u2019s replacement. Allen Naparalla, who runs a winery in Cedarburg, Wisconsin, said Biden waited too long. \u201cHe was just too old to be president anymore,\u201d Naparalla said. \u201cI don\u2019t think Kamala Harris has it in her to be a competent president.\u201d Antonio Munoz, who owns a restaurant and catering business in Las Vegas, texted two words when asked about the change: \u201cMichelle Obama.\u201d Ray Flores, who owns a handful of restaurants in Tucson, Arizona, was also nonplussed by the Democrats\u2019 changing of the guard. \u201cOur country is lost,\u201d said Flores, who is deeply disillusioned with both major political parties. \u201cWe have serious issues, but issues aren\u2019t being considered, just the pocketbooks of the very rich and famous.\u201d Kim Cavaliere, a Georgia independent who backed Trump in 2016 and Biden in 2020, said she was happy Biden made the decision to step aside. \u201cHowever, I am not pleased with Harris running,\u201d she said. \u201cWho is this absentee VP?\u201d And Linda Rooney \u2013 a Republican from Media, Pennsylvania, in the Philadelphia suburbs, who backed former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley in the GOP primary \u2013 likewise does not have a good impression of Harris. \u201cI think, personally, she has done a horrible job as VP,\u201d Rooney said. She is no fan of Trump and said she might vote Democratic if her governor, Josh Shapiro, emerged as the Biden replacement. \u201cIf Shapiro was the Dems\u2019 pick, I\u2019d be in a quandary about who to pick in November,\u201d Rooney said. Shapiro, however, was quick to endorse Harris. The swing state governor is on the list of possible Harris running mates. So is Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly, whose name as a possible Harris vice presidential pick also came up as our voters shared their initial reaction to Biden\u2019s decision. \u201cHaving Mark Kelly at that level would be immensely beneficial for Arizona, as he would fight to protect our reproductive rights, veteran rights, and advocate against the deportation of veterans,\u201d said Melissa Cordero, an Air Force veteran who now works for a conservation group in Tucson. \u201cLet\u2019s continue to push for a ticket that prioritizes these crucial issues.\u201d Kelly, a veteran and former astronaut, was a first choice of Nanette Mees, a registered Republican in the northern Virginia suburbs who tends to vote Democratic for president because of abortion rights and, more recently, issues she has with Trump\u2019s character. \u201cOh boy, what a sad state our country is in,\u201d Mees said Sunday. \u201cMark Kelly would be good, but I think it\u2019s extremely sad that Trump is probably going to win.\u201d Like Mees, Las Vegas real estate agent Zoila Sanchez is a longtime Republican but not a Trump fan. \u201cThere are no other Democrats I see as presidential,\u201d Sanchez said after Biden withdrew. \u201cI know it is going to be Kamala Harris. I hope they pick a Hispanic woman to be her running mate.\u201d Some of the reaction included unconventional suggestions, perhaps to be expected after such a tumultuous stretch in the campaign. Longtime Black activist and organizer in Milwaukee Davette Baker said, \u201cYes, we could make history\u201d if Harris won the presidency. But she said she was worried about whether Harris can win. Baker mentioned Arizona\u2019s Kelly as an option, and then added this: \u201cIf we did want to try a woman, we could get Liz Cheney.\u201d\u00a0The former Wyoming congresswoman, a conservative who lost a primary to a Trump-backed challenger, is one of the former president\u2019s fiercest critics. Optimism about the Harris-Trump contrast While acknowledging significant challenges, many of the Democratic voters in our group were energized by the weekend drama, believing that Biden had virtually no chance of winning and that a new ticket at least might. \u201cIt was for the best,\u201d said Eric Jones, an African American entrepreneur in Milwaukee. \u201cNow, the Dems have a chance.\u201d Summer Matkin, a college student in Detroit who was undecided because she opposes Biden\u2019s handling of the Israel-Hamas conflict, described Harris as \u201ca strong pick\u201d to lead the Democratic ticket. And Jade Gray, a recent University of Michigan graduate who was co-president of the campus College Democrats, said her phone was busy Sunday with excited texts from friends. \u201cSpecifically, about the felon vs. prosecutor angle that a Trump vs. Harris race would have,\u201d Gray said. \u201cI know I\u2019d like to see them in a debate.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/22/politics/democratic-voters-kamala-harris-excitement/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/23/2024", "section": "us"}}

The WNBA star and her wife, Cherelle, welcomed their first child on July 8, the 33-year-old Griner revealed Friday on the \u201cShe Knows Sports\u201d podcast. \u201cThat\u2019s my man,\u201d Griner revealed when asked about her son. \u201cHe is amazing. They say as soon as you see him, everything you thought mattered just goes out the window. And that\u2019s literally what happens.\u201d The two-time gold medalist will be heading to the 2024 Paris Olympics in the coming week. \u201cKind of sucks, I got to leave,\u201d Griner added, referring to herself as \u201cPops.\u201d \u201cBut at the same time, he will understand. \u2026 My whole phone has turned into him now.\u201d The couple had initially posted a pregnancy announcement on Instagram in April. Griner will play for Team USA in Saturday\u2019s WNBA All-Star Game ahead of the Olympics. She has averaged 18.6 points, 6.4 rebounds and 1.4 blocks in 15 games for the Phoenix Mercury this season. The new bliss and successful basketball season follow Griner\u2019s almost yearlong detainment in Russia after being unjustly sentenced to nine years for drug smuggling in 2022. Griner, who had played in the offseason for a Russian women\u2019s basketball team for years, was arrested at a Moscow airport in February 2022 after authorities found cannabis oil in her luggage. She later apologized repeatedly and said she had inadvertently packed the less than one gram of the substance. Her lawyers said the cannabis oil had been prescribed to Griner for \u201csevere chronic pain.\u201d The 10-time All Star was released in December 2022 in a prisoner swap with Russian arms dealer\u00a0Viktor Bout, who was serving 25 years in the US. She had previously been moved to a penal colony in Mordovia. Months of \u201cdifficult\u201d negotiations with the Russians culminated in the swap, senior US administration officials said, with it becoming clear only in the weeks leading up to Griner\u2019s release an opening existed to secure the American basketball player\u2019s return. In December, alongside President Joe Biden, Cherelle Griner thanked the administration for helping secure her wife\u2019s release and said she was \u201coverwhelmed with emotions.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/19/us/brittney-griner-cherelle-son/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/23/2024", "section": "us"}}
