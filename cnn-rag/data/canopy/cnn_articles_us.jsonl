{"id": "2024_06_12_us_pamela-smart-case-timeline", "text": "A forbidden relationship between a teacher and her student started with an affair and ended in the 1990 killing of the teacher\u2019s husband. Pamela Smart, then 22, was a high school media director when she began an affair with 15-year-old Billy Flynn. In her trial, prosecutors said Smart then coaxed Flynn into carrying out the murder plot with two teenage friends. Flynn admitted to killing Gregg Smart, along with two accomplices, and all three worked out plea bargains. Smart\u2019s trial \u2014 one of the first in the US to allow cameras in the courtroom \u2014 riveted the world with its mixture of sex, adultery and the story of the intimate relationship between an adult and a juvenile. More than 20 years later, the story is back in focus with Smart, who is serving life in prison, accepting responsibility for her husband\u2019s killing for the first time. Here\u2019s a timeline of Pamela Smart\u2019s murder conspiracy plot, the resulting legal cases and convictions. The shooting May 1, 1990: On this evening, teenager Flynn said, he and a friend ambushed Gregg Smart, Pamela\u2019s husband, as he arrived home to his condo in Derry, New Hampshire. The husband was on his knees, begging for his life, according to prosecutors. Flynn fired a bullet into Smart\u2019s head in a hallway where his wife later found his body. The teenagers made the scene look like a break-in. Pamela Smart\u2019s storyline was part of the inspiration for Joyce Maynard\u2019s 1992 novel \u201cTo Die For,\u201d which was later adapted into a 1995 movie starring Nicole Kidman and Joaquin Phoenix. August 1, 1990: Smart was arrested three months after the shooting. Her mother, Linda Wojas, said she was never told her daughter was a suspect at the time, she told CNN\u2019s Larry King in 1991. A riveting trial January 28, 1991: Flynn, 17, and two accomplices, Patrick Randall, 17, and Vance Lattime Jr., 18, pleaded guilty to the shooting death of Gregory Smart, according to the Associated Press. All were facing first-degree murder charges but pleaded guilty to charges related to second-degree murder and were given lighter sentences in exchange for testimony against Smart, CNN reported. That same night, Raymond Fowler, 19, was arrested in connection with the plot, according to the AP. Police said the charges were from a separate attempt on Gregory Smart\u2019s life before the actual murder. March 4, 1991: Oral arguments began in Smart\u2019s murder conspiracy trial in the Rockingham County Superior Court in Exeter, New Hampshire. Smart was on trial on suspicion of plotting the murder of her husband just before their first wedding anniversary. Prosecutors alleged Smart was after her husband\u2019s $140,000 life insurance policy. Smart allegedly seduced Flynn and threatened to stop having sex with him unless he killed her husband, prosecutors said. The trial drew a lot of attention \u2014 people lined up and had to have tickets to enter the courtroom. People who couldn\u2019t get in watched from TV monitors in another room, while television crews and reporters crammed into the press room. Convictions March 22, 1991: Smart was convicted of being an accomplice to first-degree murder, conspiracy to commit murder and tampering with a witness. She was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. August 20, 1992: Flynn was sentenced to 28 years to life in prison for second-degree murder as part of his negotiated plea deal, according to CNN affiliate WMUR. Flynn had sobbed on the witness stand during Smart\u2019s trial, saying he didn\u2019t want to lose her, who he called his first love, so he went forward with her plan, as reported by CNN. August 23, 1992: Randall, one of the accomplices, was sentenced to 40 years to life in prison with 12 years of the minimum sentence deferred for second-degree murder, according to WMUR. His sentence was later reduced. The getaway car driver, Lattime, was sentenced to 18 years to life in prison, as part of his plea deal, according to WMUR. Fowler, a passenger in the car, was sentenced to 15 to 30 years in prison as part of his plea deal. The appeals July 2005: The state\u2019s Executive Council denies Smart\u2019s request for a pardon hearing, according to WMUR. May 15, 2019: The Executive Council voted to deny Smart of a commutation hearing, according to WMUR. New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu agreed with the council\u2019s decision. March 23, 2022: The Executive Council rejected Smart\u2019s third request, according to the AP. Smart went to the state Supreme Court, which dismissed the petition. Freedom for some March 12, 2015: After serving 25 years in prison, Flynn was paroled, according to WMUR. It was his 41st birthday. Flynn and Randall were released on parole on June 4, 2015, according to WMUR. And Fowler and Lattime were out on parole the year prior. Accepting responsibility June 11, 2024: For the first time, Smart accepted full responsibility for the death of her husband in a videotaped statement Tuesday, according to the AP. The video was released as a part of her most recent request for a sentence reduction. Smart asked Gov. Sununu and the state\u2019s Executive Council for a commutation hearing, as she has exhausted her other court appeals options. Smart is serving life in prison at Bedford Hills Correctional Facility in Westchester County, New York.

{"id": "2024_04_17_us_massachusetts-satanic-temple-bombing-arrest", "text": "A suspect has been arrested for allegedly throwing a pipe bomb that damaged The Satanic Temple headquarters in Salem, Massachusetts, where investigators found a letter addressed, \u201cDear Satanist\u201d at the scene last week, prosecutors announced. Sean Patrick Palmer, 49, of Perkins, Oklahoma, was arrested Wednesday morning and has been charged with using fire or an explosive to damage a building used in interstate or foreign commerce during the April 8 incident, the US Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of Massachusetts said. CNN has been unable to identify an attorney for Palmer. Surveillance cameras captured a person igniting and throwing a pipe bomb over a fence and onto the covered porch of The\u00a0Satanic\u00a0Temple building at approximately 4:14 a.m., according to an affidavit written by an FBI agent. The explosive partially detonated and caused minor fire damage to the exterior of the building, according to the document. No one was in the building at the time and staff discovered the damage later that day, according to Salem police. The makeshift device was constructed using a plastic pipe covered with taped-on metal nails and filled with what was preliminarily identified as smokeless gunpowder, the affidavit said. The surveillance footage also showed the man throwing a small item into the building\u2019s flower bed, where investigators later found a handwritten note, the affidavit said. The note, addressed \u201cDear Satanist,\u201d references Elohim, a Hebrew name for God, and appears to allude to an incident of vandalism at the building last year, the affidavit said. The letter reads, in part, \u201cElohim send me 7 months ago to give you peaceful message to hope you repent. You say no, Elohim now send me to smite Satan and I happy to obey,\u201d according to the affidavit. About 7 months ago, on September 11, the Satanic Temple headquarters was vandalized with Bible verses spray painted in white, according to the affidavit. Palmer had not been charged in connection with that incident as of Wednesday. Investigators also identified a car appearing to belong to Palmer that was in the area at the time of the incident, as well as a 2018 photo on the suspect\u2019s Facebook that shows him wearing a tan vest similar to one worn by the man in the video, prosecutors said. If found guilty, Palmer faces up to 20 years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000, prosecutors said. Palmer will make an initial appearance in an Oklahoma district court on Thursday and is expected to appear in federal court in Boston at a later date, according to prosecutors. The\u00a0Satanic\u00a0Temple\u2019s social media accounts say it\u2019s \u201cthe only federally recognized international (non-theistic) religious Satanic organization.\u201d Its Salem headquarters are located in a former funeral parlor, where it maintains an art gallery with a permanent exhibit on Satanism, witch hunts and moral panic, its\u00a0website says. Members also perform ceremonial events and hold meetings and lectures in the space. In a news release, Salem police said the headquarters has been the target of bomb threats and possible hate crimes in the past, including a June 2022 incident during which a man was arrested on suspicion of arson, they said. Earlier this year, a Michigan man also was arrested and charged in his state with planning to bomb the temple, according to the release. In a statement on the arrest Wednesday, The Satanic Temple expressed thanks to police and federal investigators and \u201cprofound gratitude to the Salem community for the outpouring of support we have received during this challenging period.\u201d CNN\u2019s Zenebou Sylla contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/17/us/massachusetts-satanic-temple-bombing-arrest/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/16/2024", "section": "us"}}

{"id": "2024_06_15_us_florida-fatal-drive-by-shooting-fort-lauderdale", "text": "One person was killed and four others were injured in what appeared to be a drive-by shooting in Fort Lauderdale on Friday, Florida law enforcement officials say. Officers responded to the shooting just after 7 p.m., Fort Lauderdale Police Detective Ali Adamson said. When officers and fire crews arrived, they found five men with gunshot wounds. All the victims were transported to Broward Health Medical Center with life-threatening injuries, and one victim was pronounced dead at the hospital, according to police. Another victim is in critical condition, and the other three victims are in stable condition and are expected to survive, officials said. Police believe the incident appears to have been a drive-by shooting, but did not provide information about motive or whether there are any suspects. It\u2019s also unclear how many people opened fire.

{"id": "2024_06_12_us_atlanta-bus-hijacking-how-it-unfolded", "text": "Atlanta police had barely finished briefing the community about a shooting inside a downtown food court Tuesday afternoon when calls began to come in about a bus hijacking. A gunman had hijacked a commuter bus with 17 people inside and shot one of them with the passenger\u2019s own gun, authorities said, prompting others to frantically text loved ones and call 911 for help. But as police arrived on the scene and tried to confront the gunman, identified as 39-year-old felon Joseph Grier, the suspect held the bus driver at gunpoint and forced him to speed away, according to Atlanta Police Chief Darin Schierbaum. The ensuing rush-hour police chase zig-zagged across highway lanes and suburban streets as the bus led authorities across at least two counties, at times careening into other cars and crossing into opposing traffic. Inside, a passenger surreptitiously stayed on the line with 911, allowing authorities to hear the commotion, Schierbaum said. Mayor Andre Dickens said the chaos sounded like a movie scene as the suspect had \u201ca gun to the head of a bus driver saying, \u2018Don\u2019t stop this bus or else worse will happen.\u2019\u201d When the bus finally ground to a halt on a tree-lined street in the suburb of Stone Mountain, passengers streamed out and Grier was arrested without incident, police said. A passenger found shot aboard the bus was taken to a hospital, where they later died, officials said. He was identified Wednesday as 58-year-old Ernest Byrd Jr., according to the Fulton County Medical Examiner\u2019s Office, which ruled his death a homicide. The suspect \u2013 who, in a twist, was at the scene of Tuesday afternoon\u2019s shooting downtown and spoke to local news outlets moments before the hijacking \u2013 now faces a slew of charges in connection to Tuesday\u2019s incident, according to jail records. They include one count of murder, 14 counts of kidnapping, 13 counts of aggravated assault, one count of first-degree hijacking of a motor vehicle, one count of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon and one count of possession of a firearm or knife during the commission of or attempt to commit certain felonies. Grier waved his initial court appearance, according to a spokesperson for the Fulton County Sheriff\u2019s Office. He has 19 prior felony convictions, police said, though no further details were provided. CNN has been unable to determine whether the suspect has an attorney. How the harrowing incident unfolded The hijacked Gwinnett County Transit bus is part of a web of commuter routes that bring people to and from Atlanta\u2019s sprawling suburbs, including passenger Paulette Gilbert, who called her husband from inside the bus as the chase began to unfold. Paulette Gilbert seemed stunned and frightened as she described a man who had boarded the bus and began acting strangely, said her husband, Johnny Gilbert. She said the man got into a confrontation with another passenger and shot them, possibly in the leg. \u201cShe said the guy got on the bus and seemed kinda crazy,\u201d Gilbert said, recounting his wife\u2019s story. \u201cHe was being disruptive or getting on people\u2019s nerves,\u201d he added. The husband urged his wife to get off the phone in case the shooter thought she was calling 911, fearful he may shoot her next. \u201cI said put the phone down, put it away. Just sit still.\u201d Grier was \u201cengaging with passengers\u201d when he got into a fight with one of them, a male, who pulled a gun, according to the Georgia Bureau of Investigation. \u201cGrier took the gun from the passenger and began threatening passengers with it,\u201d the GBI said in a news release, citing preliminary information from its investigation. \u201cGrier then shot the passenger and ordered the bus driver to flee the scene while threatening passengers with the gun.\u201d At around 4:30 p.m., police received the first 911 call from a passenger reporting that a gunman was holding the bus hostage on Ivan Allen Boulevard and that there may have been shots fired, Schierbaum said. Then the line went silent. Soon after, another call came in from the family of a passenger who had texted them that the bus had been hijacked. An officer arrived at the scene within about a minute of the first 911 call and tried to confront the suspect, who then \u201cforced the bus driver to drive off,\u201d Schierbaum said. A third 911 call \u2013 this time from another passenger \u2013 stayed on the line throughout the entire chase, allowing dispatchers to feed information to several law enforcement agencies involved in the pursuit, the chief said. The bus led a fleet of law enforcement vehicles along Atlanta\u2019s Interstate 85 as rush hour commuters sped by. It crossed through several suburban areas before coming to a halt in the city of Stone Mountain. The large bus struck several vehicles during the pursuit, police said, though it is unclear whether any drivers were hurt. Officers were able to disable the vehicle using several tactics, including positioning an armored vehicle at one of its sides, preventing it from maneuvering in that direction, police said. The GBI said law enforcement flattened tires on the bus during the chase, but it continued to move. Ultimately, a Georgia state trooper fired his rifle into the engine compartment of the bus, the GBI said, causing the bus to halt on Hugh Howell Road in Stone Mountain. As the bus came to a halt, passengers began to unload themselves and Grier was arrested without incident, police said. A joint investigation into the hijacking will be conducted by the Atlanta Police Department and the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, which will also investigate the police use of force. Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis said Wednesday an employee of her office was on the hijacked bus, a witness to the incident, so she can\u2019t prosecute the suspect. Willis has asked Georgia\u2019s prosecuting attorneys council to assign a different jurisdiction to prosecute the suspect, writing in the letter her office is \u201cconflicted because it has been determined that a victim/witness in this case is a current employee of the Office of the District Attorney for the Atlanta Judicial Circuit.\u201d A violent day for Atlantans The hijacking was one of two violent incidents in downtown Atlanta Tuesday, just four blocks apart.\u00a0Though police say the incidents do not appear to be connected, their alarming proximity \u2013 and the suspects\u2019 extensive criminal records \u2013 have drawn condemnation and concern from local officials. About two hours before the hijacking, a man shot and wounded three people in a busy Atlanta food court. Police said the 34-year-old suspect in that shooting, who was quickly arrested, is a convicted felon who has been arrested 11 times. Interviews with local news stations showed Grier at the scene, claiming in disjointed statements that he witnessed the shooting at Peachtree Center. \u201cI got knives. I got all this sh*t on me. I protect myself. I can\u2019t get a gun,\u201d Grier said in an interview with CNN affiliate WXIA, adding he had previous felony convictions and was on probation. A CNN crew at the scene of the aftermath of the shooting saw Grier being belligerent and interfering with police officers during their investigation. Police are looking into Grier\u2019s presence at the earlier shooting. \u201cToday has been a very active day, but let me be clear, we\u2019re talking about gun violence that is as a result of too many people having guns in their hands,\u201d Mayor Dickens said in a Tuesday evening news conference. \u201cYou\u2019re talking about people that should not have been on the streets with guns.\u201d Dickens said the spate of gun violence shows \u201csomething more needs to be done\u201d but noted violent crime in the city has been decreasing. \u201cSo, this day is not indicative of all the days in the city of Atlanta, but this is a day we\u2019ll never forget,\u201d the mayor said.

{"id": "2024_06_14_media_infowars-alex-jones-liquidation-ruling", "text": "A Texas bankruptcy judge\u00a0has\u00a0rejected a proposed liquidation of\u00a0conspiracy theorist\u00a0Alex Jones\u2019\u00a0company\u00a0Free Speech Systems, the parent company of Infowars, saying that a denial of the bankruptcy plan was, in his opinion, in the best interest of the creditors. But the judge approved a separate liquidation of Jones\u2019 personal assets. Judge Chris Lopez said the Infowars bankruptcy process had dragged on and that it needed to stop \u201cincurring costs\u201d and let the families of Sandy Hook victims try to claim what they are owed through state courts. The families have not received payment of the approximately $1.5 billion in damages against Jones that they have won after he lied about the 2012 school massacre. \u201cThe right call is to dismiss this case,\u201d\u00a0Lopez said Friday. Lopez made his ruling in a\u00a0lengthy\u00a0decision\u00a0where he seemed emotional at times, once even noting the timing of this decision being made shortly before Father\u2019s Day. \u201cI think it needed to happen,\u201d he said towards the end of the hearing. \u201cI wish I would\u2019ve picked a better day.\u201d Unanswered questions The rejection of the bankruptcy plan leaves many questions to sort out in the decision\u2019s wake. Among them: What happens next for Infowars? And what legal avenues remain for the victims\u2019 families to collect the massive sum Jones still owes them? This judgment could be viewed as a partial victory for Jones, who fought the liquidation proposal \u2013 but so too did some families, whose attorneys said they\u2019ll benefit more from the bankruptcy plan\u2019s dismissal by going after Jones\u2019 assets immediately \u2013 rather than waiting for a prolonged bankruptcy procedure to play out. That ruling leaves Free Speech Systems to face its creditors outside of bankruptcy in state courts, noted Marie Reilly, professor of bankruptcy law at Penn State University. In a statement, an attorney for the families said they would press on. \u201cToday is a good day. Alex Jones has lost ownership of Infowars, the corrupt business he has used for years to attack the Connecticut families and so many others,\u201d said Chris Mattei, an attorney for the families. \u201cThe Court authorized us to move immediately to collect against all Infowars assets, and we intend to do exactly that.\u201d Lopez noted that the case is far from over. The interim trustee, and later the permanent trustee\ufeff, in Jones\u2019 personal case will ultimately decided Infowars\u2019 fate. \u201cThose trustees will make decisions about where things go,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not leaving thing\ufeffs into the wind here.\u201d Jay Westbrook, a University of Texas bankruptcy law professor, said that Infowars could still be sold by the court-appointed trustee to pay some of the damages owed to the families, but it would likely not fetch a high price. \u201cJones owns [Free Speech Systems] and thus his bankruptcy trustee could sell it, but without his active promotion it may be of little value, except for its inventory of products he has been selling,\u201d Westbrook said. Jones\u00a0had been\u00a0opposed to liquidating\u00a0Infowars and in recent days ranted on his show about what could be its impending shutdown, urging his audience to buy his products to support him. \u201cI\u2019m going to try to move forward and maximize the amount of money we can make at Info\ufeffwars to then have a wind-down,\u201d Jones said outside the court house after the hearing Friday. Jones\u2019 attorney, Vickie Driver, applauded the decision, saying the judge was fair in his review of the unique aspects of the case. \u201cMr. Jones did everything he could to preserve as much value as he could in Free Speech Systems to pay the plaintiffs,\u201d Driver said. Westbrook said if Jones continues at Infowars, it could maximize the amount of money the victims families could draw from it. \u201cThe problem is that Jones\u2019 appeal to his audience, awful as it is to say it, is probably the only thing of value he has that is not exempt in Texas and it is very difficult to make him use it to benefit anyone else,\u201d Westbrook said. Jones\u2019 personal bankruptcy approved Earlier on Friday, Lopez approved the liquidation of\u00a0Jones\u2019 personal assets after the conspiracy theorist agreed to convert\u00a0his personal bankruptcy into a Chapter 7 liquidation last week. The liquidation means that Jones will immediately lose control of his property except for certain exempt property, such as a $2 million house in Austin. Jones\u2019 decision to seek bankruptcy protection comes after he agreed to demands from the families of Sandy Hook victims. The judge said an interim trustee will be appointed to oversee Jones\u2019 estate, as is standard in these cases. Jones\u2019 attorney Vickie Driver told the court $2.8 million from the sale of Jones\u2019 ranch could be sent to the trustee. Jones founded Infowars, an influential conspiracy empire, in the late 1990s. Over the years, Jones has used the media company to poison the public discourse with lies and conspiracy theories, and he also enriched himself, making millions of dollars in the process. Whatever proceeds are gained from Jones\u2019 personal bankruptcy will amount to just a fraction of what he owes families of Sandy Hook victims. The families argued to the court that there is \u201cno prospect\u201d the Jones\u2019 company could produce a proper reorganization plan under a Chapter 11 bankruptcy, which would allow the company to remain operational through its restructuring. The judge\u2019s rulings on Friday would not prevent Jones from spreading conspiracy theories and lies online. X CEO Elon Musk restored Jones\u2019 social media account in December 2023 after a five-year ban from the platform. And Jones could go on any number of far-right outlets to share his outlandish views. But the Sandy Hook families are hoping\u00a0to seize Jones\u2019 social media accounts, arguing they are a key part of his Infowars business that allow Jones to promote his brand. And Jones may not be welcome at some venues: He had been listed as a guest on the Milwaukee stop on Tucker Carlson\u2019s live tour but was recently dropped from the lineup without explanation. Lies and conspiracy theories Since founding Infowars in the late 1990s, Jones has pushed several conspiracy theories, including the lie that the 2012 Newtown, Connecticut, mass school shooting was a so-called \u201cfalse flag\u201d operation staged by the government and that the grieving family members of 20 child victims were \u201cactors.\u201d\u00a0Jones makes money on those conspiracy theories by hawking high-priced dietary supplements to his audience. The mood Friday on Jones\u2019 Infowars was somber, with the far-right outlet\u2019s hosts speculating on its future. Chase Geiser, an Infowars host who had driven with Jones to the courthouse where the bankruptcy hearing was underway, made a brief appearance on the outlet, attempting to twist the judge\u2019s decision as one that would net Jones an even larger audience. Jones\u2019 regularly scheduled program was replaced with previously recorded interviews, airing conversations with Tucker Carlson and Russell Brand.

Nine, \u201cmaybe 10\u201d victims were injured in the shooting at Brooklands Plaza Splash Pad in Rochester Hills and transported to multiple hospitals with \u201cvarying kinds of injuries,\u201d Oakland County Sheriff Michael Bouchard said during a Saturday evening news conference. The sheriff did not have further details on the extent of the injuries but said he knew at least one person was out of surgery and \u201cdid well.\u201d Rochester Hills is about 27 miles north of Detroit. One of the victims was 8 years old, said Bouchard, who added he could not comment on the age of the other victims. The sheriff stressed the information is preliminary and the incident is changing \u201cby the second.\u201d Gov. Gretchen Whitmer announced in a statement on X she is in contact with local officials following the shooting.  \u201cI am heartbroken to learn about the shooting in Rochester Hills,\u201d she wrote. \u201cWe are monitoring the situation as updates continue to come in, and are in touch with local officials.\u201d \u201cThis is a great community and it\u2019s heartbreaking to see this happen here,\u201d said Rochester Hills Mayor Bryan Barnett. The first 911 call alerting police to the incident was made around 5:11 p.m. Bouchard said a Rochester Hills sergeant was listening to a new technology that securely livestreams 911 calls directly to first responders and responded to the scene within two minutes, before the call was dispatched. Authorities located a handgun and three empty magazines at the scene. Bouchard said it appears the suspect pulled up to the recreation area, exited a vehicle and opened fire roughly 20 feet away, reloading multiple times. The suspect fired \u201cpotentially 28 times,\u201d the sheriff said. The incident appears to be random and authorities have yet to determine a motivation for the attack, he added. Suspect contained in home surrounded by officers An individual who police believe to be the suspect is contained at a house within a half mile from the crime scene, which is surrounded by officers, the sheriff said.  Authorities are bringing in additional assets, including SWAT teams and armored vehicles to assist officers at the scene, Bouchard said. \u201cWe are trying to talk to that person without response but we, again, believe he is contained there,\u201d he said. \u201c\u2026 We are in the process of getting a search warrant for that address.\u201d The sheriff advised those sheltering in the parks to go home and asked people to stay away from the area if they are sheltering at a nearby location. The suspect was not known to authorities until they did a \u201cquick investigation\u201d and determined who they believed was involved based on evidence from the crime scene. \u201cA vehicle that matched what had been described as a vehicle leaving the scene was there,\u201d the sheriff said. \u201cWe put up a quick perimeter and deputies on scene apparently heard or saw the individual they are trying to communicate with.\u201d Investigators believe there are potentially more weapons in the home but it is unclear if the suspect has access to them, according to Bouchard. The sheriff called the incident a \u201cgut punch,\u201d and stressed the community is still reeling from the 2021 shooting at a high school in Oxford, located 15 miles north of Rochester Hills, when four students were killed. \u201cWe\u2019re not even fully comprehending what happened at Oxford, and now we have another complete tragedy that we\u2019re dealing with,\u201d he said.

{"id": "2024_06_13_us_cal-state-palestinian-protests", "text": "Pro-Palestinian protesters who entered and barricaded themselves in a building at California State University, Los Angeles, on Wednesday cleared out by early Thursday, a spokesperson for the school told CNN. Most protesters left the Student Services Building of their own accord around 1:15 a.m. local time and returned to an unauthorized encampment on campus. No arrests were made, university spokesperson Erik Frost Hollins said. A small group remained inside but the university\u2019s Department of Public Safety officers entered the building and asked them to leave, and they complied, Hollins said. University President Berenecea Johnson Eanes, whose office is in the building, according to the university\u2019s website, was among dozens of employees who remained inside during the takeover. She and other administrators were safely escorted out after midnight Thursday, Hollins said. The group of 50 to 100 protesters barricaded the exits on the first floor on Wednesday and blocked off areas around the building, Hollins told the Los Angeles Times. The university asked employees on the upper floors to shelter in place, Hollins said. Video from CNN affiliate\u00a0KABC showed protesters moving furniture on the first floor of the building with signs on windows and plywood spray-painted with the messages, \u201cThe time to escalate is now!\u201d and \u201cCSU stop funding genocide.\u201d Demonstrators \u201cdon\u2019t want folks inside the building,\u201d a protester told KABC, saying, \u201cThis is not a hostage situation.\u201d The university called the Los Angeles Police Department to assist, CNN affiliate\u00a0KCAL/KCBS reported. \u201cSignificant\u201d damage including broken glass and graffiti was observed on the interior and exterior of the building, primarily the first four floors, according to Hollins. All classes and operations at\u00a0the university\u2019s main campus will be held remotely until further notice, according to a message posted on its\u00a0website. \u201cPlease do not come to main campus,\u201d the Protest Action Alert reads. Meanwhile, operations on Cal State\u2019s downtown campus will remain normal, the alert said. An assessment will be done to determine the overall cost of the damage and when the building, which houses services like financial aid and student support, will reopen. \u201cIt will take time to recover and to provide these services in the same way that we were able to before, and that\u2019s deeply unfortunate,\u201d Hollins said. On Thursday, Eanes ordered the encampment that has been on the campus for the past 40 days to be dismantled following what she referred to in a statement as \u201cviolence and destruction\u201d that unfolded Wednesday night, according to the university. \u201cKnow that we will recover from this, but also know that I am committed to doing everything we can to ensure this will never be allowed to repeat,\u201d the university\u2019s president said. \u201cThe Encampment has crossed a line. Those in the Encampment must leave.\u201d Eanes did not give a timeline of when the encampment will be dismantled or if the university would request assistance from law enforcement. Three employees and a student were reportedly assaulted during the protest \u2013 one person was assaulted as the protesters entered the university building, another as they were leaving, one was \u201caccosted on a walkway\u201d and another who was looking at damage, said Eanes, who did not say if they were injured. The demonstrations escalated due to frustration with university officials who sent a message regarding encampments, which \u201creiterated something \u2026 said 20 days ago,\u201d a protester told KABC. The protesters\u2019 actions at Cal State, Los Angeles, come as some American campuses continue to be convulsed by pro-Palestinian demonstrations denouncing Israel\u2019s handling of its war against Hamas in Gaza. Protests late this spring gripped schools across the country, but they have persisted in some places, including at UCLA \u2013 some 20 miles west of Cal State, Los Angeles \u2013 where 27 people were arrested Monday after setting up multiple pro-Palestinian encampments that police said were unlawful. Additionally, at least six University of California Police Department personnel and other safety officers were injured in confrontations with the protesters, including one person with a head injury, Rick Braziel, UCLA\u2019s associate vice chancellor for campus safety, said in\u00a0a news release Tuesday. Of those arrested at UCLA, 18 were students, and two were faculty, police said. Another was a former student, while the rest were not affiliated with the university.

{"id": "2024_06_15_politics_bannon-turning-point-trump-retribution", "text": "Steve Bannon, a longtime ally of Donald Trump, vowed investigations and prosecutions of those who have probed the former president and his political allies, declaring at a conservative gathering Saturday that Inauguration Day in 2025 will be \u201caccountability day.\u201d Pointing to Trump\u2019s recent conviction in New York, Bannon told a crowd at Turning Point Action\u2019s \u201cThe People\u2019s Convention\u201d in Detroit, hours before Trump was scheduled to speak, that the former president\u2019s allies are going to \u201cget every single receipt.\u201d \u201cYou are going to be investigated, prosecuted and incarcerated,\u201d he said. \u201cThis has nothing to do with retribution. It has nothing to do with revenge. Because retribution and revenge might be another order of magnitude. This has to do with justice.\u201d Bannon was referring to\u00a0recent comments by Trump vowing to be his supporters\u2019 \u201cretribution\u201d\u00a0and saying\u00a0that \u201csometimes revenge can be justified.\u201d Trump has repeatedly bypassed opportunities from friendly interviewers \u2014 including multiple conversations with Fox News host and friend Sean Hannity \u2014 to dial back his rhetoric and walk away from threats of retaliation against his political opponents and over his criminal prosecutions. \u201cLook, when this election is over, based on what they\u2019ve done, I would have every right to go after them, and it would be easy because it\u2019s Joe Biden,\u201d the former president told Hannity earlier this month. Some Trump allies, including another veteran of his 2016 campaign and the Trump White House, former campaign manager Kellyanne Conway, have downplayed the former president\u2019s comments. Earlier this month, Conway noted that Trump\u2019s Justice Department did not try to prosecute Hillary Clinton despite the chants of \u201cLock her up!\u201d at 2016 campaign rallies. But other allies have responded more forcefully to Trump\u2019s conviction in his New York hush money trial. Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, demanded that Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg and Matthew Colangelo, an attorney in the prosecutor\u2019s office, testify \u201cabout the unprecedented political prosecution of President Trump.\u201d In response to the verdict, several Republican senators \u2014 including vice presidential contenders Marco Rubio of Florida and J.D. Vance of Ohio \u2014 signed a letter signifying they would not work with the Biden administration to pass legislation, confirm his judicial nominees or increase non-security spending. Bannon\u2019s incendiary speech comes two weeks before he is due to report to prison. He was convicted of contempt of Congress in 2022 after failing to provide documents and testimony to the House select committee that investigated the January 6, 2021, Capitol attack. He was sentenced to four months in prison, and a federal judge earlier this month ordered him to report to prison by July 1. Once a top adviser to Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign and a senior White House aide, the bombastic Bannon is now a right-wing podcaster with a following of loyal Trump supporters. He is no longer the Trump insider he once was, but Bannon was influential in House conservatives\u2019 ouster of former Speaker Kevin McCarthy, and he has taken credit for the removal of former Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel. His \u201cWar Room\u201d podcast has also been a megaphone for false claims of election fraud and a rewriting of the history of the January 6 attack on the Capitol. Rallying the room around the former president\u2019s recent conviction in New York, Bannon claimed, without elaborating, that Trump is \u201celigible for 700 years in prison\u201d and \u201cthey want him to serve all of it.\u201d Trump\u2019s sentencing in the New York case, so far his only criminal conviction in the four cases he faces, is set for July 11. The judge can sentence the former president to probation or up to four years in state prison on each count, with a maximum of 20 years. Bannon pointed to Trump allies such as Roger Stone and Rudy Giuliani who have been prosecuted and claimed, \u201cthey\u2019re turning people into political prisoners and sending people to prison, and they will send every one of you in this audience to prison also.\u201d Bannon told the crowd they are the \u201cvanguard of this revolution,\u201d adding, \u201cwe are not prepared to be governed by criminals\u201d and vowing to \u201cpurge\u201d the Justice Department and \u201ctake apart\u201d the FBI. \u201cNovember 5 is judgment day. January 20, 2025, will be accountability day,\u201d Bannon said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/15/politics/bannon-turning-point-trump-retribution/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/16/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_15_us_lake-champlain-plane-crash-1971", "text": "Kristina Nikita Coffey was four years old when the plane her father had boarded lost contact with air controllers and disappeared over Lake Champlain in Vermont on a snowy night in 1971. The crash site was never found, but over the years she held out hope it would be uncovered, steadily accumulating newspaper clippings and documents related to the case. So it was a surprise when her cousin, Barbara Nikitas, called on May 28 with news: An underwater searcher had found the jet\u00a0on which her father,\u00a0George Nikita, had embarked with four other men 53 years ago. \u201cWhen I called her, I think she was stunned because we didn\u2019t know Garry was doing the search,\u201d Nikitas told CNN, referring to the searcher. \u201cIt was a shock on all levels.\u201d After seeing the photos of the jet underwater, Nikita Coffey says she knew it was the right plane. \u201cI knew it,\u201d she said of the plane carrying her father. \u201cI\u2019ve looked at that picture of the plane my whole entire life.\u201d What happened aboard the plane that night is still a mystery. On January 27, 1971, the aircraft departed Burlington, Vermont, toward Providence, Rhode Island. The takeoff appeared normal to the control tower, according to Garry Kozak, the underwater searcher who found the jet. But shortly after takeoff, the controller lost\u00a0all radar contact. There was no mayday or communication from the jet, Kozak says. On board were Nikita, Donald Myers, Robert R. Williams, III, Frank B. Wilder and Kirby Windsor. An initial search for the jet was unsuccessful, Kozak says. It was winter and the bitter cold temperatures had frozen the lake, making immediate subsequent searches impossible. By spring, the ice melted and searches recovered some debris from the plane. More search attempts followed.\u00a0Over the next 53 years, more than 17 searches were carried out to find the plane, all unsuccessful, according to Kozak. Kozak\u00a0first learned of the plane crash from a friend in the 1980s. The fact that so many attempts had failed intrigued him. \u201cI\u2019ve always been challenged by finding stuff underwater, so\u00a0that was the personal satisfaction for me to solve something that everybody else had sort of forgotten,\u201d Kozak told CNN. \u201cSecondly, for the family because I had spoken with some of the family members back in 2014 when one of the searches was being put together.\u201d When searches were conducted, Kozak believes the plane was within the searched areas but had been overlooked on scans. \u201cI\u2019ve worked on many aircraft crashes over the years, but I have a pretty big mental library on the kind of anomaly I should be watching for when I read data,\u201d Kozak said. Kozak says in his field some may overlook what seems to be a pile of rocks. Frank K. Wilder,\u00a0the son of passenger Frank B. Wilder, agrees. He says he knew the plane was going to be hard to find based on this fact. \u201cMost people think the airplane is in one piece and\u00a0it\u2019s on the bottom and that would be easy to find, but in reality\u00a0the plane is debris to a lot of small pieces and that\u2019s a lot harder to identify,\u201d Wilder said. Lost and found again The jet was found in approximately 200 feet of water west of Juniper Island, about 3 miles from Burlington. From the video and pictures captured, experts could see the plane\u2019s red and black accent stripes. Nearby, they also saw\u00a0two turbine engines and a broken wing. The wreck site was left undisturbed. Even though it was\u00a0over 53 years ago, the passengers\u2019 children still remember the day their lives changed forever. \u201cI remember my mom just crying and this terrible scream. I\u00a0don\u2019t think I really understood at that point what it all meant,\u201d Wilder said. Nikitas still remembers the impact the crash had on her mother. \u201cMy mother and her two brothers were very close. They were always there for each other, and I think she felt like, \u2018I can\u2019t be there for my brother. I can\u2019t find him. I can\u2019t properly bury.\u2019 That always resonated with me,\u201d she said. After many years of search attempts and some false leads, families had to move on,\u00a0said Charles C. Williams,\u00a0son of Robert Williams, III. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to explain the limbo that this created,\u201d Williams said. \u201cSix months turns into a year and a year turns into two and there\u2019s just been no answers. That\u2019s really super, super hard on families.\u201d But the search never stopped for many of them. With her cousin, Nikita Coffey started reaching out to other families cited in the news articles she saved. They say their group has been a source of support. \u201cThis event happened, and I think it\u2019s probably fair to say we all went our separate ways. You live your life and you feel like you\u2019re carrying this burden by yourself,\u201d Williams said. \u201cIt\u2019s been wonderful because most people don\u2019t understand what you\u2019re going through, but with this group, we understand and it\u2019s nice to have that support,\u201d Wilder added. As more news outlets report the story, Williams says that people have reached out amid a resurgence of details about the case. \u201cFor them to have been lost and now kind of found again. I think it\u2019s really neat that people are seeing that and reaching out, but for the families it\u2019s also got a sense of sadness to it because now we know,\u201d Williams said. Nikita Coffey thanks every person who volunteered their time to help them find the crash site. Those many searches allowed them to cross locations off when another one began. \u201cThey\u2019re family now. I can\u2019t say enough about them. I can\u2019t thank them enough for their tireless effort,\u201d\u00a0Nikita Coffey said. Now that the crash site was found, the\u00a0National Transportation Safety Board will make its evaluation to confirm it\u2019s the right aircraft. The agency has received an information package about the case from the Federal Aviation Administration, according to a NTSB spokesperson. \u201cWe will be evaluating the specifics of what was found, and the degree of certainty to which we are able to positively link it back to the wreckage that was located. Following that, if and when any of that wreckage were recovered, we would determine what level of examination would be appropriate given what is recovered and what condition it is in,\u201d spokesperson Peter C. Knudson told CNN in a statement. While the crash site may have been found, it\u2019s important to the passengers\u2019 children the next generation also knows about their fathers. \u201cThat\u2019s what we really want to get across,\u201d she said. \u201c(They were)\u00a0five amazing men that left a hole in many people\u2019s hearts because of their loss, not just their family, their colleagues, their friends.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/15/us/lake-champlain-plane-crash-1971/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/16/2024", "section": "us"}}

The suspected gunmen \u2013 Willie Zavon Hill, 27; Allen Gregory Chambers Jr., 30; Eugene Anthony Holmes, 22; and\u00a0Jacarree\u00a0Brian Green, 30, \u2013 each face three counts of first-degree murder, 20 counts of attempted murder and a single count of conspiracy to commit murder, according to an affidavit. Hill also was charged with evidence tampering. Investigators said he disposed of a vehicle used in the crime by dumping it in a canal, according to the affidavit. \u201cMiami-Dade was shocked, indeed everyone in South Florida was shocked, when 23 individuals were shot during the Memorial Day Weekend on May 30, 2021,\u201d said Miami-Dade County state attorney Katherine Fernandez Rundle at a Thursday press conference. The shooting outside the El Mula Banquet Hall near Hialeah stemmed from an ongoing rivalry between two gangs identified as the \u201cBricks\u201d and \u201cBack Blues/Apes\u201d in\u00a0Miami-Dade County, according to the affidavit. On the night of the shooting, the banquet hall was being rented out by a music group that featured several rappers affiliated with the \u201cBack Blues\u201d gang, the affidavit states. Shortly after midnight, a group of hooded men pulled up to the venue in an SUV and fired indiscriminately into a crowd standing outside, authorities said. Several people in the parking lot returned fire, leaving behind a crime scene littered with shell casings. Less than a month after the shooting, Chambers posted a music video on YouTube titled \u201cMr. Pull Up\u201d where he seemingly rapped about shooting and killing the \u201cApes.\u201d The video also showed multiple suspects in the shooting, including Hill, the affidavit said. \u201cWe as a law enforcement community vow that this investigation will continue until everyone who can be charged, is charged and held accountable for this horrific incident,\u201d Rundle said. Hill is being held on a $10,000 bond on the evidence tampering charge but none of the men are eligible for bond on their murder charges. CNN has been unable to identify attorneys for the suspects. Two other men have previously been charged in connection to the shooting, though charges in one of the cases have been dropped.  Last September, Davonte Barnes was convicted\u00a0of three counts of second-degree murder and 20 counts of attempted second-degree murder,\u00a0according to the Associated Press. He was sentenced to life in prison. In 2021, authorities also arrested Warneric\u00a0Buckner in connection with the shooting but prosecutors later dropped the charges after determining detectives made a mistake while interrogating him and after Buckner invoked his right to counsel, according to the Associated Press.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/13/us/miami-dade-2021-concert-shooting-suspects-charged/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/16/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_15_economy_good-news-inflation-may", "text": "\u201cGood news is bad news\u201d has been a common refrain for a while now. When economic reports are released that are solid, they have all too often been clouded with concerns that good news for the economy actually means a longer wait before the Federal Reserve rolls out rate cuts. This week, a string of good news was actually good news: Closely watched inflation gauges showed prices had cooled more than anticipated; Americans\u2019 financial outlooks were rosier than they have been in years while their inflation expectations dipped; and, on Friday, US import prices reversed course and fell sharply, adding fuel to the disinflationary fire. \u201cWhat we saw in the data is a reaffirmation of the idea that the economy, hiring, inflation are all cooling, which should create the conditions later this year for the Federal Reserve to relax their restrictive policy rate,\u201d said Joe Brusuelas, principal and chief economist for RSM US. \u201cAnd long-term interest rates will come down, which means the cost of financing, to purchase a car, a dishwasher or a washing machine or dryer, all will fall.\u201d He added: \u201cThat is good news.\u201d This week \u2014 with its multiple inflation reports, a Fed meeting, a new central bank rate cut timeline and economic projections, and a slew of ancillary data \u2014 had the makings of being a market-mover and a foreteller of the economic trajectory. And it sure did deliver. On Monday, new survey data from the New York Fed showed that US consumers reported increased optimism about their current and future financial situation, the stock market and the continued slowing of inflation. On Tuesday, the National Federation of Independent Business\u2019 optimism index hit the highest level of the year (although firms\u2019 uncertainty rose as well). But those data points were small fry as to what would come Wednesday. Inflation as measured by the Consumer Price Index cooled more than expected in May, with prices holding flat on the month for the first time since July 2022. On an annual basis, consumer prices rose 3.3% from a year earlier,\u00a0slowing from April\u2019s 3.4% rate, Falling gas prices did their part, as did stable grocery prices, but a key gauge of underlying inflation also cooled. Core CPI rose just 0.2% for the month (its slowest pace since October of last year), and its annual rate dropped to 3.4%, setting a fresh three-year low. \u201cThe disinflationary trend we saw in 2023 is reasserting itself in that the seasonal noise that we typically see in inflation at the turn of the year was just that, \u2018noise,\u2019\u201d Brusuelas said. The soft CPI bolstered traders\u2019 expectations that interest rate cuts could now come as soon as September. The Fed, putting on its hawkish hat, tried to play spoilsport later that afternoon when it held rates at their current levels once again, and officials signaled only one rate cut for the remainder of the year, down from the three penciled in last December. The markets don\u2019t seem to be buying the one-cut plan, especially after the Producer Price Index on Thursday showed that wholesale prices fell from April to May and the BLS\u2019 Import and Export Price Index showed that US imports prices fell 0.4% in May after rising 0.9% in April. Excluding gas prices, imports still fell 0.3%. \u201cEverywhere Fed officials look, inflation is now in a cooldown phase after the worrisome first quarter flare-up,\u201d Chris Rupkey, chief economist at FwdBonds, wrote in a note on Friday. \u201cFed officials did not see what they were hoping for in the inflation trend when they met earlier this week, but the winds of change are coming for those bearish inflation outlooks as the economy may be slowing more than expected at the end of the second quarter.\u201d \u201cWe would not rule out a first rate cut in September; the market is not,\u201d Rupkey wrote. And more good news is likely on the way this next week and later this month, Brusuelas said. Inflation growing at a slower rate will give Americans more comfort in terms of overall spending, he said, adding that should be on display in next week\u2019s retail sales report. Additionally, the disinflation seen in the CPI and PPI are setting the stage for an equally softer report from the Fed\u2019s favored inflation gauge: The Personal Consumption Expenditures price index, which is due out at the end of the month.  \u201cThere\u2019s a real possibility we could see no increase on a monthly basis and that inflation slows into the 2.5% to 2.6% range,\u201d he said. \u201cAt that point, you\u2019re within spitting distance of the Fed\u2019s 2% target, and we have to seriously be talking about rate cuts in the near term.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/15/economy/good-news-inflation-may/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/16/2024", "section": "us"}}

{"id": "2024_06_13_us_susan-lorincz-interrogation-video-florida", "text": "Newly released interrogation video shows Florida woman Susan Lorincz telling detectives she heard her neighbor say she was going to kill her before Lorincz was arrested for fatally shooting the woman through a closed door during a dispute over children playing outside last year. Lorincz, a 58-year-old White woman, is charged with manslaughter with a firearm and assault related to the June 2, 2023, shooting of her Black neighbor, Ajike \u201cAJ\u201d Owens, who had been knocking on Lorincz\u2019s door. Investigators have said Lorincz became angry because several neighborhood children, including Owens\u2019 children, were playing near her home. In the video, released Monday by the Marion County Sheriff\u2019s Office, Lorincz during the nearly two-hour long interrogation repeatedly\u00a0tells\u00a0two detectives she was in fear of her life during the incident and she recalled Owens saying \u201cI\u2019m gonna kill you.\u201d \u201cI just remember being terrified that she was banging and screaming and just, I just remember hearing her say, \u2018I\u2019m going to kill you,\u2019\u201d Lorincz tells detectives, as also described in\u00a0the affidavit in the case. \u201cI was in fear for my life. I mean, honest to God, I just feared that she was going to come through that door. I\u2019m sorry. That\u2019s how I felt. I can\u2019t change the way I felt. I mean, it was sheer terror on my part,\u201d Lorincz adds. Detectives tell Lorincz no one they had interviewed had made statements about Owens saying that she wanted to kill Lorincz. \u201cThese people said that she was saying to come outside,\u201d the video shows one detective telling Lorincz. \u201cShe wanted to confront you about something, she wanted you to come outside.\u201d The Owens family previously told CNN Lorincz harassed Owens and her children and used racial slurs toward them prior to the killing. Lorincz admitted using racial slurs against neighborhood children in the past, according to an\u00a0arrest affidavit. The video also shows detectives asking Lorincz whether she had searched Florida laws on self-defense and \u201cstand your ground,\u201d to which she replied she had searched the topic earlier in the day, after she saw \u201cthey had it up on Facebook.\u201d \u201cI know what you\u2019re thinking \u2013 that I looked at the laws so I could do something. No,\u201d Lorincz tells detectives. Before placing Lorincz under arrest, detectives explain that her actions the day of the shooting did not appear reasonable. \u201cFrom everything I\u2019ve seen, it doesn\u2019t rise to the level for you to justify shooting through a closed door and with a firearm, OK. And I think you know that that wasn\u2019t reasonable what you did,\u201d one of the detectives says, questioning why the shot that killed Owens was fired only two minutes after Lorincz got off the phone with a dispatcher while calling 911 and requesting police. \u201cTwo minutes \u2013 to me it was much longer,\u201d Lorincz says. At the end of the interrogation, the video shows Lorincz being given the opportunity to write Owens\u2019 children a note, which she does while waiting for deputies to return. When deputies return to transport Lorincz to jail, the video shows she initially refuses arrest, repeatedly saying \u201cI can\u2019t do this,\u201d and exclaiming \u201cI don\u2019t care. Kill me!\u201d She eventually stands up and is handcuffed. Jury selection in the case against Lorincz is set to begin June 17, court records show.

{"id": "2024_06_13_us_new-york-arrest-weapons-nypd", "text": "(CNN) \u2014 The New York Police Department is investigating whether a Queens man who was arrested Wednesday had plans to carry out an attack before he was pulled over and found with a gun, eight loaded magazines and other weapons, according to police officials with knowledge of the investigation. Officers stopped Judd Sanson after noticing a\u00a0blacked-out license plate on the Black Ford Explorer he was driving around 1:30\u00a0a.m., according to NYPD. The officers ended up finding a large cache of\u00a0weapons, handcuffs, NYPD uniform items and a New York City transit vest, NYPD Chief of Department Jeffrey B. Maddrey told reporters Wednesday. Sanson, 27, was taken into custody and now faces charges of criminal possession of a weapon \u2013 a loaded firearm, criminal possession of a weapon, unlawful possession of ammo feed device, and an obscured license plate, the NYPD told CNN in an email. In court Thursday, his lawyer entered a not guilty plea and Sanson was remanded into custody. His next hearing is set for Monday. During their search of Sanson\u2019s car, officers also found a 9-millimeter Glock, 100 rounds of ammunition, a stun gun, multiple knives, a weighted whip, an expandable baton, heavy body armor and two axes, Maddrey said. The man allegedly had a bullet-proof vest with an NYPD patch on the front as well as an orange MTA vest typically worn by workers in New York City subways, according to police officials with knowledge of the investigation. Police displayed the items at a news conference on Wednesday, including the Guy Fawkes mask made popular by the movie \u201cV for Vendetta.\u201d According to an affidavit released Thursday, police found an expandable baton with the words \u201cleft me no choice,\u201d \u201cyou gon learn today\u201d (sic) and \u201castaghfirullah\u201d written in marker. That latter phrase is Arabic for \u201cI seek forgiveness in God,\u201d the affidavit states. Sanson also told an officer, in sum and substance, \u201cSorry, I\u2019ll take it off. There\u2019s a lot of drunk people nowadays,\u201d according to the affidavit. Questions about motive After the court hearing Thursday, Queens District Attorney Melinda Katz said investigators would look through all of Sanson\u2019s social media accounts to find out his true motives. \u201cWhen someone is driving around with 11 different weapons, all of this ammunition, language on the baton that sounds threatening, transit uniforms that can be used almost anywhere in our subway system or in our transit system, we have reason to be concerned,\u201d Katz said. A day earlier, Maddrey said \u201cit\u2019s still too early\u201d in the active investigation to determine if the incident is related to terrorism. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be very thorough with this investigation,\u201d Maddrey said. \u201cIt will be investigated by the detective bureau along with our intel unit to just see what else we can learn about this arrest.\u201d Police sources said investigators from the NYPD\u2019s Intelligence Division and the Joint Terrorism Task Force were brought in because of the number and types of weapons, the gun, the amount of ammunition and vests with police and transit symbols. Investigators are also examining writings found in the car and on social media, the police sources said. \u201cMembers of this department make gun arrests, weapons arrests, arrests for knives every day. But an arrest of this magnitude \u2013 the amount of ammunition, NYPD paraphernalia\u00a0in the car, was significant,\u201d Maddrey said Wednesday. New York\u00a0Gov. Kathy Hochul said officials take the case \u201cvery seriously,\u201d but could not say whether the man was plotting an attack. \u201cThere is no tolerance for this behavior, this is criminal, and I have confidence\u00a0in\u00a0our system that this\u00a0individual will be prosecuted and handled to the fullest extent\u00a0of\u00a0the law,\u201d Hochul told CNN\u2019s Laura Coates\u00a0Wednesday night. \u201cThis is unacceptable\u00a0in\u00a0the State\u00a0of\u00a0New York, it\u2019s frightening but it\u2019s important to know that the police are\u00a0on\u00a0top\u00a0of\u00a0this and more will be reported as we are able to disclose this to the public,\u201d she said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/13/us/new-york-arrest-weapons-nypd/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/16/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_15_us_nyc-lgbtq-pride-month-flags-vandalized", "text": "Flags dedicated to celebrating LGBTQ Pride Month were vandalized this week in New York City, according to the city\u2019s police department. The colorful flags near the Stonewall National Monument, located in Manhattan\u2019s Greenwich Village neighborhood and dedicated to a turning point in the modern LGBTQ civil rights movement, were removed and damaged sometime on Thursday night, the New York City Police Department said in a statement to CNN. Authorities received a report early Friday, shortly before 8 a.m. ET about flags missing from the park where the monument is located. A preliminary investigation found an unidentified person had removed and destroyed 160 flags in the area around 8 p.m. Thursday, according to police. \u201cThe individual then fled the location to parts unknown,\u201d the statement said. There were no injuries reported and authorities have not made any arrests. The investigation is ongoing, the police department said Friday evening. New York City Mayor Eric Adams commented on the vandalism in a post on X, formerly Twitter, writing: \u201cHate has no place in our city, and nothing will change that.\u201d Adams on Thursday celebrated June\u2019s LGBTQ Pride Month at a gathering at his residence at Gracie Mansion Conservancy. \u201cWe love the LGBTQ+ community and celebrate them during Pride and all year round,\u201d the mayor wrote on X. \u201cWe\u2019ll always have your back, and we will bring whoever defaced the Stonewall monument to justice.\u201d The mayor\u2019s office is working closely with the NYPD to identify the person responsible for the vandalism, which Adams referred to as a \u201cheinous act\u201d in a statement to CNN. New York Attorney General Letitia James called the vandalism \u201cdisgusting\u201d in response to New York City Council member Erik Bottcher sharing images of the damaged and broken flags in an X post. Bottcher\u2019s post showed a pile of LGBTQ flags on the ground near the Stonewall monument and Christopher Park. \u201cAnyone who thinks this will intimidate our community is badly mistaken,\u201d Bottcher wrote. In 2016, President Barack Obama designated the Stonewall National Monument area, which includes Christopher Park the historic Stonewall Inn, as the first US national monument to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights. The area was the site of the 1969 Stonewall uprising and protests often cited as a flashpoint for LGBTQ rights in the US. A June 1969 police raid of the Stonewall Inn, a gay bar, prompted patrons to fight back and eventually led to the first gay and lesbian rights march. Last June, the NYPD said its Hate Crime Task Force investigated at least three incidents during Pride Month during which the Stonewall National Monument\u2019s flags were damaged or removed, CNN previously reported.

{"id": "2024_06_15_politics_election-age-what-matters", "text": "A truism of American politics is that older voters prefer the Republican and younger voters prefer the Democrat. That\u2019s what happened in 2020, when Democrat Joe Biden won voters under 50 and Republican Donald Trump won voters over 50, according to exit polls. Biden\u2019s margin among younger voters \u2014 he got 65% of voters ages 18-24 \u2014 helped him overcome the fact that Trump got 52% of older voters, who accounted for more than half the electorate. In 2016, Trump defeated Hillary Clinton in the Electoral College even though she got more votes than him, but the pattern of younger voters supporting the Democrat held. Clinton got more votes among voters ages 18-44, and Trump got more votes among voters ages 45 and older, according to exit polls. In 2012, Republican Mitt Romney lost the election, but he did better than Democrat Barack Obama among voters 45 and older. Voters under 30 haven\u2019t preferred the Republican since 1988, when George H.W. Bush defeated Democrat Michael Dukakis in a landslide. Voters over the age of 65 haven\u2019t preferred the Democrat since 2000, when Al Gore lost the election despite getting more votes than Republican George W. Bush. But the old rules don\u2019t seem to apply in this year\u2019s presidential election, where both candidates are old men and their fitness to serve is a top issue. Older voters are gravitating to Biden, and younger voters are taking a look at Trump. A new Marist poll in the battleground state of Pennsylvania, for instance, showed a tight race overall with Trump at 47% and Biden at 45%, a within-the-margin-of-error difference. Trump is making inroads with voters of color and is nearly even with Biden among voters under 45 in that poll. But older voters have gone in the opposite direction, and instead of favoring Trump, are nearly split in the Marist poll. It\u2019s a trend that extends to other states. In a nationwide Quinnipiac University poll released in May, Biden and Trump split younger voters, but Biden has an edge among voters 65 and older. Not\u00a0every poll shows the same\u00a0level of shift,\u00a0but\u00a0the general movement among both younger and older voters is\u00a0a departure from past results. Biden is now leaning into questions about his age that have dogged his reelection campaign and worry voters in opinion polls. \u201cJoe isn\u2019t one of the most effective presidents of our lives in spite of his age, but because of it,\u201d first lady Jill Biden said at a campaign stop in Wisconsin this week, part of a three-day swing designed to boost his support among older voters. Older voters are essentially Biden\u2019s and Trump\u2019s peers. Both men were born in the 1940s. CNN\u2019s Jeff Zeleny and Eric Bradner note that older voters were \u201calive in the aftermath of World War II and the Cold War, a period Biden has attempted to tap into as he casts Trump as a threat to democracy.\u201d They also write that \u201cin 2024, baby boomers now make up a wide majority of the senior vote for the first time \u2014 an enticing demographic shift the Biden campaign is seizing upon in Michigan and across the country.\u201d In Michigan, Zeleny and Bradner talked to Linda Van Werden, a retired real estate agent who only got active in politics after Trump\u2019s 2016 victory. \u201cI never thought I\u2019d be one of those people holding up a political sign or being involved, but I can\u2019t sit back anymore and watch this happen,\u201d she said. Despite the shift of older voters in the direction of Biden (and younger voters away from him), I was surprised to see older voters still have reservations about Biden\u2019s age. In a February New York Times/Siena College poll, nearly three-quarters of registered voters ages 65 and older said Biden was too old to be effective as president compared with less than half who said the same about Trump. Those figures tracked with the population at large. CNN\u2019s Ronald Brownstein noted last year that older voters were more likely to approve of Biden\u2019s job performance and argued that some of his policy wins, like pushing for lowering drug costs in Medicare, appeal directly to seniors. Whatever the reason, if Biden is to overcome questions about his age to keep his job, it will be with help from people his own age.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/15/politics/election-age-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/16/2024", "section": "us"}}

The bottles were found in five storage pits in the mansion\u2019s cellar, with 29 of them\u00a0intact and containing \u201cperfectly preserved cherries and berries, likely gooseberries or currants,\u201d\u00a0according to a news release\u00a0from George Washington\u2019s Mount Vernon on Thursday. Crews unearthed the 18th-century bottles during the ongoing $40 million\u00a0revitalization\u00a0project launched last year at Mount Vernon, Virginia. The bottles were extracted from the pits and refrigerated, and are expected to undergo scientific analysis, the release states. The slowly drying bottles, \u201ccomposed of materials and foodstuffs that are likely 250 years old,\u201d will be sent from Mount Vernon\u2019s archaeology lab to an off-site location for conservation, according to the release. The latest discovery comes after\u00a0the\u00a0recent find\u00a0of two intact European-manufactured glass bottles,\u00a0also from the 18th century,\u00a0filled with liquid, cherries and pits in the same cellar, according to the organization. \u201cNow we know those bottles were just the beginning of this blockbuster discovery,\u201d Mount Vernon President and CEO Doug Bradburn said in a statement. Bradburn referred to the discoveries as \u201can unprecedented find,\u201d adding that \u201cnothing of this scale and significance has ever been excavated in North America.\u201d \u201cThe bottles and contents are a testament to the knowledge and skill of the enslaved people who managed the food preparations from tree to table,\u201d said Jason Boroughs, Mount Vernon principal archaeologist. The bottles may have been forgotten when Washington left Mount Vernon to take command of the Continental Army, according to Bradburn. \u201cThese artifacts likely haven\u2019t seen the light of day since before the American Revolution,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s so appropriate that these bottles have been unearthed shortly before the 250th anniversary of the United States.\u201d Bradburn added that the organization\u2019s team is hopeful the cherry pits may be viable for future germination. Mount Vernon partnered with the US Department of Agriculture\u2019s Agricultural Research Service to analyze the bottles\u2019 contents. In the early stages of analysis, researchers identified 54 cherry pits and 23 stems, suggesting the bottles were likely full of cherries at one point, according to the release. \u201cThe cherries likely are of a tart variety, which has a more acidic composition that may have aided in preservation,\u201d the release states. The cherries are likely candidates for DNA extraction, which could help researchers compare them against a database to identify their exact species, according to\u00a0the release.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/15/us/george-washington-mount-vernon-cherries-berries-trnd/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/16/2024", "section": "us"}}

Family members of the victims watched from nearby tents on school property. Some cried. It is expected to take several weeks to complete, according to the Broward County Public Schools district. It will be dismantled in pieces, starting from the top. \u201cThis building has been a symbol \u2013 a symbol of failure. I know many in the community are happy to see it go,\u201d said Tony Montalto, who lost his 14-year-old daughter, Gina. His son is concerned people will forget once the building is gone. His wife had grown attached to it from the many times they took lawmakers through its corridors. \u201cAs for me, I\u2019m concerned because we haven\u2019t seen a solid plan yet for what\u2019s going to replace this building. We need something that\u2019s going to reflect the ones who were taken from us, the people they were before the tragedy.\u201d The district said in May the demolition would take place in summer 2024 following the end of the school year, which was Monday. The demolition was initially set to begin Thursday, but was delayed due to days of torrential flooding rain in South Florida. In a statement, the district said Friday it \u201cis\u00a0continuing to work with the families and school staff to determine future use of the site.\u201d The shooting ripped apart 17 families, including 14 students and three faculty members, on Valentine\u2019s Day in 2018. Seventeen others were wounded; their journey through grief and trauma continues to this day. The gunman was\u00a0sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. \u201cThis is one more step in our healing process,\u201d Lori Alhadeff, whose 14-year-old daughter, Alyssa, was killed at the school, told CNN Friday. \u201cAnd it\u2019s important that\u2026 six years later, that this building comes down and my family, you know, we\u2019re grieving the death of our daughter, Alyssa. We\u2019re healing but we\u2019re also trying to make change.\u201d Alhadeff founded the nonprofit Make Our Schools Safe, which promotes school safety. Alyssa\u2019s Law, which requires that public elementary and secondary school buildings be equipped with silent panic alarms to notify law enforcement, is on the books in six states. \u201cWe know that time equals life,\u201d said Alhadeff, noting that legislators who toured the building \u2013 \u201cseeing the blood on the ground, the glass on the floor, the horror\u201d \u2013 were moved to action. Alhadeff, who chairs the Broward County School Board, said she hoped the grounds would be turned into a \u201cusable space\u201d she called \u201cMSD Legacy Field\u201d that can serve as a \u201cteachable area where we can remember and keep the legacy alive.\u201d \u201cThe day before Alyssa was murdered, she played in her last soccer game and she was fierce,\u201d her mother recalled Friday. \u201cShe was captain of her soccer team, wore number eight, and we just miss and love Alyssa so much, and we will continue to keep your memory alive through Make Our Schools Safe.\u201d \u2018There is no closure\u2019 Before the demolition got underway, a rainbow soared over the area where families of the victims later gathered. Among those assembled were Debbi Hixon and her son Corey, whose father, Chris, 49, the school athletic director and wrestling coach, was killed that day. Alhadeff was there with her family, along with Montalto. And Max Schachter, whose 14-year-old son, Alex, was murdered in English class. Once the demolition started, Schachter did not stop watching. \u201cWhen I brought people through that building, it changed their lives,\u201d Schachter said. \u201cAnd everybody that came out of that building was focused to make sure that this never happens again.\u201d Even after it\u2019s torn down, Schachter said, the 1200 building will always be there. \u201cI will always remember the horrific images that I saw walking through that building, knowing the pain that Alex was going through when he was being shot and murdered. There is no closure for me. It\u2019s a progress through this journey that I am on.\u201d His only regret, Schachter said, is that more people will not be able to bear witness to the horror. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to understand the magnitude of the failures unless you\u2019re walking through that building,\u201d he said. \u201cIn Florida, we\u2019ve passed seven school safety bills since Parkland. We take it very, very seriously. You have to prioritize safety before education because you can\u2019t teach dead children. I\u2019m looking at this building today and it reminds me of all the failures that happened that day.\u201d It rained earlier but, by the time the excavator went to work, the sky was a clear blue. Some family members greeted each other with hugs. Others stood in small groups and talked. The school building was preserved pending the trials of both the shooter and Parkland school resource officer Scot Peterson, who stayed outside during the massacre. A jury acquitted Peterson on all counts, absolving him of wrongdoing in the\u00a0rare trial of a law enforcement officer. On the day of the massacre, the then 19-year-old gunman grabbed his AR-15-style rifle and magazines and rode in an Uber to his former high school. There, he took out his rifle and loaded it then wandered through the halls of the school. He\u00a0fired indiscriminately at various students and staff in hallways and classrooms.\u00a0He eventually left the school and was taken into custody several miles away. Students initially returned to the campus two weeks after the shooting. But building 1200, where most of the victims were killed,\u00a0was closed off behind emergency tape with its windows covered. A\u00a0new building\u00a0later replaced the temporary classrooms students had been using in the wake of the slaughter. Survivors and family members of those killed in the shooting were given \u2014 at their request \u2014 private, individual tours in 2023 inside the 1200 building and described a tragic and grotesque scene, with blood stains in the areas where the victims had been killed, bullet holes puncturing the classrooms, and Valentine\u2019s Day candy still on students\u2019 desks. Other school shooting sites destroyed Many schools where mass shootings occur choose to demolish the sites of the massacres to ease the extraordinary trauma experienced by survivors, victims\u2019 families and the rest of the community. Four years after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting that killed 26, a newly rebuilt school opened to students \u2014 including fourth-graders who were kindergarteners during the bloodbath. Columbine High School also demolished its school library, where most of the carnage ensued during the 1999 shooting that killed 13, and replaced it with a newly built school library named the Hope Library. In Uvalde, Texas, where students at Robb Elementary School were marred by the slaughter of 19 children and two teachers in 2022, city officials have said they also plan to destroy the building. \u201cIn many cases, these schools are closed or entirely renovated in an attempt to decrease the traumatic reminders that they have become for community members,\u201d according to the\u00a0Center for Violence Prevention\u00a0at Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia.

A jury acquitted him on all counts.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/14/us/parkland-demolish-stoneman-douglas-high-school-shooting/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/16/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_15_business_why-do-small-trader-joes-bags-keep-going-viral", "text": "A few months ago, Thaddeus Yan heard that Trader Joe\u2019s was preparing to sell a fairly mundane new item: A miniature insulated cooler bag. Right away, he was on the lookout. When he went to London on a trip, he even deputized his mom to keep an eye out for the bags. After months of waiting, Yan drove to a Trader Joe\u2019s at 7:30 one morning this month and bought as many as he could, given the store\u2019s purchasing limit: Two in bright teal, and one in hot pink, both with prominent TJ\u2019s branding. Yan, a social media content creator, paid $3.99 for each of the small bags (too tiny for his Stanley cup, he noted in a TikTok video on his \u201cthaddybearz\u201d account \u2014 but big enough for a six pack). Others may not be so lucky. The mini-coolers have already been listed for several times that price on eBay. Yan is part of a throng of influencers who have been changing, and even accelerating, the way certain retail products go viral. They\u2019re not only rushing out to buy as many items as they can, but spreading the word on their popular social channels, where trends catch fire. Before social media, it took a lot more for a niche item to hit. \u201cYou\u2019d have to see people in public settings,\u201d so trends were much more localized, said Colin Campbell, an associate professor of marketing at the University of San Diego\u2019s Knauss business school. But now \u201cyou can have it all happen instantly across the whole country.\u201d Success strikes twice This isn\u2019t even the first time little Trader Joe\u2019s bags have gone viral. In March, shoppers went wild over Trader Joe\u2019s mini canvas tote bags, which rapidly sold out. Most brands don\u2019t see their products take off this way, especially not twice in a row. On those rare occasions, companies make hay: They talk to fans online and build new marketing campaigns, squeezing as much as possible out of that moment in the sun. But Trader Joe doesn\u2019t have much of a social media presence. The company staying (mostly) mum has allowed content creators, particularly on TikTok, to fill the vacuum, making the items \u2014\u00a0which may well have been popular on their own \u2014 even more successful. These creators are playing a key role in the worlds of retail marketing.  Talia Heskett, for example, has more than 134,000 followers on TikTok and about 146,000 on Instagram, plus roughly 68,000 on Facebook for her \u201cTrader Joe\u2019s Talia\u201d accounts, as of Friday. Because Trader Joe\u2019s doesn\u2019t boast much of an official online presence, \u201cI\u2019ve kind of taken on that role\u201d with those pages, she said. Heskett is a fan of the grocery chain, and has turned her interest in the brand into something lucrative. Her channels are popular enough for her to earn payment from TikTok. She\u2019s not the only one posting this type of content. Christy Vetere runs her own TikTok account, \u201cTrader Joe\u2019s and Target Finds,\u201d where she spotlights products from the stores. It had more than 54,000 followers on the social platform on Friday. Heskett, Vetere and others keep shoppers up to date on TJ\u2019s news, tapping into an existing audience of fans to bolster their own followings. What\u2019s up with these bags? Last March, when TJ\u2019s canvas mini totes went viral, the chain appeared baffled by their popularity. \u201cWhat is up with these tote bags? Like, they\u2019re a thing that we didn\u2019t plan for them to be,\u201d said Tara Miller, co-host of the company\u2019s Inside Trader Joe\u2019s podcast, in a March episode. \u201cI\u2019m still a little perplexed about how quickly that excitement went to kind of frenzy,\u201d she said. \u201cWe thought we bought enough of these mini canvas totes to last for several weeks, maybe a whole month,\u201d said Matt Sloan, who hosts the podcast with Miller. \u201cWe had no inkling that they would be this exciting, this quickly, for so many customers. We had actually hundreds of thousands of bags come in and go out within a week.\u201d This time, with the brightly colored coolers, the brand seemed more prepared. \u201cConsider yourself fairly warned: these Totes are totally destined to become the next craze!\u201d screams a product description on the grocery chain\u2019s site.  Apart from the prediction on its website, Trader Joe\u2019s hasn\u2019t said much about the swift-selling seasonal items. A Trader Joe\u2019s representative told CNN that the brand is always looking for new products its customers will like \u2014 and that it plans to offer more of the mini insulated bags this summer. How some products go viral If you search \u201cTrader Joe\u2019s mini insulated bag,\u201d right now you\u2019ll be served a seemingly endless stream of videos featuring the brightly colored items. Some people might just decide to pick one up on their next grocery trip because they saw it online. Others may seek the item out specifically, rushing to stores before they sell out. \u201cWhen you can get something that not everyone else has it makes you look cool, makes you look like an insider,\u201d said Jonah Berger, marketing professor at the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Wharton School and author of \u201cContagious: Why Things Catch On.\u201d That desire doesn\u2019t only apply to high-priced or extremely rare luxury items, he noted. \u201cYou often see \u2026 trends and things catching on, or going viral, in what I would describe as low-cost public consumables,\u201d Berger said. Think Stanley cups, Owala water bottles and Nike socks \u2014 all items that can be seen in public. These items \u201ccan be affordable luxuries, and can allow people to either show their distinction or show that they\u2019re part of a certain group,\u201d Berger added. For some, the treasure hunt aspect may be part of the fun \u2014\u00a0especially when it ends not only with the coveted item, but a chance to post evidence of success online. Yan, who drove to Trader Joe\u2019s at 7:30 am to find the bags, doesn\u2019t run a Trader Joe\u2019s-focused account like Vetere and Heskett. His videos on Instagram and TikTok are mostly devoted to pop culture and Disney. But he likes the chain, and he likes to post about what he buys there. \u201cYou never know what they\u2019re going to drop, it could be some random, really cool thing that everyone might be interested\u201d in seeing, or getting for themselves, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s always a surprise.\u201d The chain\u2019s unusually loyal fanbase is eager for more Trader Joe\u2019s branded merchandise, TikToker Heskett said, but Trader Joe\u2019s doesn\u2019t offer much of that. \u201cYou can\u2019t buy a Trader Joe\u2019s hat, you can\u2019t buy a Trader Joe\u2019s sweatshirt,\u201d she said. That\u2019s why, she thinks, the branded bags have been such a hit. \u201cPeople want a little piece of Trader Joe\u2019s to carry around with them.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/15/business/why-do-small-trader-joes-bags-keep-going-viral/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/16/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_15_politics_trump-biden-cnn-debate-rules", "text": "With less than two weeks until the first presidential debate of the 2024 election cycle, CNN has released additional details on the parameters agreed upon by the Trump and Biden campaigns. The debate, which will be hosted by CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper and Dana Bash in Atlanta on June 27, will mark the first in-person showdown of the 2024 campaign between President\u00a0Joe Biden\u00a0and his predecessor, former President\u00a0Donald Trump. Both candidates have accepted the network\u2019s invitation and agreed to accept the rules and format of the debate, as outlined in letters sent to the campaigns by the network in May. The 90-minute debate will include two commercial breaks, according to the network, and campaign staff may not interact with their candidate during that time. Both candidates agreed to appear at a uniform podium, and their podium positions will be determined by a coin flip. Microphones will be muted throughout the debate except for the candidate whose turn it is to speak. While no props or pre-written notes will be allowed on the stage, candidates will be given a pen, a pad of paper and a bottle of water. Some aspects of the debate \u2013 including the absence of a studio audience \u2013 will be a departure from previous debates. But, as in the past, the moderators \u201cwill use all tools at their disposal to enforce timing and ensure a civilized discussion,\u201d according to the network. In order to meet CNN\u2019s qualifications for the debate, candidates must satisfy the requirements outlined in Article II, Section 1 of the US Constitution to serve as president. Both Biden and Trump meet those requirements, as do Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Cornel West and Jill Stein, who are running on non-major-party tickets. Participants must also file a formal statement of candidacy to the Federal Election Commission. All five have done so. All participating debaters must appear on a sufficient number of state ballots to reach the 270 electoral vote threshold to win the presidency and receive at least 15% in four separate national polls of registered or likely voters that meet CNN\u2019s standards for reporting. Polls that meet those standards are those sponsored by CNN, ABC News, CBS News, Fox News, Marquette University Law School, Monmouth University, NBC News, The New York Times/Siena College, NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist College, Quinnipiac University, The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post. Though not impossible in Kennedy\u2019s case, it is less likely that candidates other than Biden and Trump will meet those requirements. Kennedy has received at least 15% in three qualifying polls so far and is currently on the ballot in six states, making him currently eligible for 89 Electoral College votes.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/15/politics/trump-biden-cnn-debate-rules/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/16/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_15_us_lesbian-bars-south-cec", "text": "Trying to find Arcana is like going on a treasure hunt. North Carolina\u2019s only known lesbian bar is tucked away somewhere on West Main Street in Durham, in one of those configurations that confuses navigation apps and results in several minutes of wide-eyed wandering. It\u2019s there, though, around the back of a building, behind some of the city\u2019s buzziest restaurants. A circular sign signals the entrance across from the railroad tracks that run through Durham. Then, it\u2019s down a flight of pitch-black stairs \u2014 perfumed by the Indian fusion restaurant above \u2014 and you\u2019re inside a candlelit space decorated with mismatching antique furniture and local art. Sade and Tracy Chapman croon from the speakers overhead, and owner Erin Karcher is behind the bar, chatting with two women seated on the stools in front of her. They address her by name. \u201cThe Lion King\u201d musical is playing at the nearby Durham Performing Arts Center, and Karcher has created a lineup of craft cocktails for the occasion: the Nala, the Sarafina and Pride Rock. A silver jar sits on the bottle shelf behind her, with a handwritten paper sign reading \u201cTips for Tits;\u201d inches away hangs a palm-sized transgender flag. Arcana is part of what has been dubbed a dying breed in the country: a lesbian-specific bar, of which there are only 33, according to The Lesbian Bar Project. While not an official tally, the Lesbian Bar Project aims to amplify and keep track of these spaces, which can register with the project.\u00a0 On a slow Wednesday evening, with just a handful of customers stopping in for a drink, Arcana is operating at a low, comfortable hum. In the back, a burlesque class is in session, and a tarot card reader wearing a rainbow face mask sits in the corner near the bar, offering her services. Before she started doing tarot readings at Arcana, Joy Carter, who lives in neighboring Raleigh, would often make the trek out to Durham just to stop in. \u201cWhen I was here, it made me wish I could be here more, because I knew I was safe,\u201d Carter, who identifies as queer, said. \u201cI am both safe and comfortable on a lot of fronts, in a lot of ways that I\u2019m not necessarily safe and comfortable in the world outside the door.\u201d Carter isn\u2019t the only one who feels that way. Arcana, which opened in 2015, also hosts regular craft nights, figure drawing, and even queer bachata lessons. Their monthly \u201cDyke Night\u201d dance parties attract upwards of 100 people. For one of the bar\u2019s very first Dyke Nights last year, there was a line out the door. \u201cIt was a sense of, not only is this wanted, but it\u2019s been wanted for a while,\u201d Karcher said. Despite mounting political efforts to restrict gay rights in states like North Carolina, Texas and Tennessee, many cities in the South have a robust LGBTQ scene. These bars are more than just spots to grab a drink. They\u2019re community fixtures and emblems of LGBTQ history. Lesbian bars are places of belonging and resistance Nightlife has always been a tenet of LGBTQ culture. For most of US history, being gay was a criminal offense, one that could lead not only to social ostracization but jail time. Being seen out in public, socializing with visibly queer people, was shrouded in shame. The only place to be out and safe was in bars and parties, where the cover of night, close quarters and plausible deniability \u2014 a bar, after all, is a place for petty sin \u2014 provided shelter. In the 19th century, women socialized (and slept) with other women at private parties and gatherings. LGBTQ bars began to appear in cities like Chicago and San Francisco in the 1920s and 1930s, but most lesbians never went to them, according to lesbian history expert Lillian Faderman in her book \u201cOdd Girls and Twilight Lovers.\u201d Instead, they would attend private parties, like the weekly gatherings organized for lesbians and gay men by New York\u2019s Nucleus Club. As they left, each man would pair with a woman, so neighbors would be none the wiser. Today, these bars offer an alternative to the straight mating rituals of common watering holes, where groups of women and men circle the room like predator and prey. Even in these rarified places, there\u2019s still variety: Some are cocktail-forward spaces that close at a respectable hour, others are dance clubs that don\u2019t let up until 3 in the morning. No matter the vibe, all exist, in some capacity, as a space for LGBTQ people to be themselves. Most American lesbian bars exist in large cities. In the South, The Lipstick Lounge, Tennessee\u2019s only bar registered with the Lesbian Bar Project, is in Nashville\u2019s hip East End neighborhood. My Sister\u2019s Room, the only known lesbian bar in Georgia, sits right in the middle of Atlanta alongside sky-scraping office buildings and modern apartments. Houston\u2019s Pearl Bar is nestled among a frenzied bar scene on Washington Ave. Although Arcana is the only known lesbian bar in Durham, there are a handful of other gay and LGBTQ bars in the city, hosting everything from queer dance parties to fundraisers for sexual violence survivors. These events can be packed. Nights out here attract dozens of locals and students from neighboring colleges. Depending on the evening, you\u2019re as likely to see Carhartt work pants as you are leather corsets. Though Karcher has lived in North Carolina for most of her life, she spent time in New York and has visited LGBTQ bars in other cities, like Seattle. In more liberal cities, there\u2019s a sense that the state\u2019s politics support you, she said, that even outside the bar is safe. Even in Durham, a city that has become \u201cso queer\u201d in an otherwise red-leaning state, Karcher said going to a LGBTQ bar carries an air of defiance. \u201cWe\u2019re never as confident about our state politics here,\u201d she said, referencing controversies over Confederate monuments, efforts against diversity in higher education, and past struggles against discriminatory laws like HB2, commonly known as \u201cthe bathroom bill.\u201d There\u2019s always something to fight against, either nationally or locally, she continued. But to look around and know you\u2019re fighting alongside community, alongside family, is empowering. \u201cWe\u2019re working together,\u201d she said. When queer culture meets Southern hospitality Over the course of nine months, writer Krista Burton visited 20 lesbian bars around the country, going to each one multiple times and immersing herself in their scenes. She chronicled her findings in her book \u201cMoby Dyke: An Obsessive Quest to Track Down the Last Remaining Lesbian Bars in America.\u201d As she traversed through the South, she noted a fascinating ambient shift. At every bar she went to in the region, she was immediately noticed and greeted \u2014 a different experience from lesbian bars in other parts of the country, and one she hadn\u2019t expected. Strangers would readily talk to her. The vibe was relaxed. It felt like they were all a part of a secret club \u2014 an oasis in a part of the country that isn\u2019t always overtly welcoming to LGBTQ people. \u201cTo step inside those doors was to experience a new kind of welcome that I had not experienced before,\u201d Burton said. \u201cLike members of the community, seeing me and being happy that I was (there).\u201d Call it queer Southern hospitality. At Herz, in Mobile, Alabama, every single person turned around to greet Burton upon her entrance, a \u201cfreaky\u201d experience unlike anything she\u2019d ever encountered. By the time she left, she had met every person in the bar \u2014 about 50 people. At Yellow Brick Road, in Tulsa, Oklahoma, bartenders eagerly introduced her to regulars to chat with. Five hours down south, at Sue Ellen\u2019s in Dallas \u2014 a packed bar brimming with hundreds of people \u2014 a bartender she met upon first entering yelled goodbye when Burton left, hours later, and still remembered her name. By the end of Burton\u2019s trip, she found that the narrative of \u201cdying lesbian bars\u201d was maybe not totally accurate. Lesbian bar culture\u2019s evolution reflects changing demographics More people, especially those in younger generations, are identifying as LGBTQ, according to Gallup, with 3% of Gen Z adults considering themselves lesbian. On the other hand, many young people are increasingly identifying not simply as \u201cgay\u201d or \u201clesbian,\u201d but \u201cqueer\u201d or \u201cpansexual\u201d \u2014 shifting labels that evade binary classifications. Sexuality and gender identity can be fluid. Though nearly a quarter of Gen Z adults consider themselves part of the broader LGBTQ umbrella, not everyone may see themselves solely as \u201clesbian,\u201d and thus may prefer gathering in a more generalized LGBTQ space. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s a physical shift from a lesbian bar to a bar that sometimes holds \u2026 queer or lesbian nights,\u201d Burton said. \u201cThe need for bars is there. The customer base is there. It\u2019s just that the bars shift in how they look.\u201d That\u2019s what has happened at Harlym Blue\u2019Z, a bar in Richmond, Virginia owned by wife-duo Shamecca and Le\u2019Teshia LeSane. Though they don\u2019t consider Harlym a lesbian bar per se \u2014 their clientele is wide-ranging \u2014 there are rainbow stickers scattered throughout the space, and they\u2019ve partnered with local Black LGBTQ organizations to host weekly events in the past. When customers realize the two are married, some of them have questions \u2014 sometimes about managing a business with a spouse, sometimes about being young Black business owners, and sometimes, of course, about their sexualities. For some customers, the LeSanes are the first lesbian couple they\u2019ve ever interacted with. One group, who\u2019ve become regulars after previously not knowing any LGBTQ couples, even invited the two on a week-long family cruise. \u201cBeing able to educate people, not saying \u2018Hey this is what you have to do, but this is who we are,\u2019\u201d Le\u2019Teshia said. \u201cAnd if you\u2019re enjoying it, you\u2019re enjoying this dance, if you\u2019re enjoying this place, then this is who we are and this is what it\u2019s about.\u201d Lesbian bars fight to keep tradition alive As LGBTQ bars became more popular, these watering holes were still subject to police raids and other violent upheavals in the late 20th century. Notably, the watershed 1969 Stonewall riots, which inspired our modern Pride parades, began as a police raid on the Stonewall Inn, a known gay bar. These days, for most people, the sense that a bar would be the only safe space has lessened, which could be one reason behind the seemingly fading culture of lesbian-specific bars. Still, there are more general challenges facing these spaces. Like any bar or restaurant, they can be hard to keep open. Herz, in Mobile, closed last year after four years in business, the owners announced in a Facebook post. Dozens mourned the bar\u2019s closing in the comments section, grieving the karaoke nights and the \u201csafe haven\u201d the bar provided. \u201cIt\u2019s a really big loss for the Mobile community and the Gulf Coast. I mean, people from Florida and Mississippi were coming to Herz,\u201d customer Kimberly McKeand told CBS42. \u201cWe were all devastated by its closing, I mean, many of us cried over it because it was just a safe place for us, a very comfortable place.\u201d In Virginia, too, Le\u2019Teshia said many of the longstanding LGBTQ bars have closed both in Richmond and in the neighboring cities. The popular Club Colours, a LGBTQ pop-up bar on Saturday nights, shut down after nearly a decade. Though other LGBTQ bars in the area still exist, Le\u2019Teshia said Club Colours was one of the only LGBTQ spaces in the area that served a truly diverse clientele. \u201cI really don\u2019t feel that the scene is what it used to be,\u201d she said. \u201cNow you\u2019ll see just more groups of people going to regular clubs, regular bars.\u201d In bigger cities where places may be more LGBTQ-friendly, there\u2019s an idea that lesbian-specific bars may be a relic, particularly when general bars and clubs could provide the same experience. But Christa Suppan, who has owned Nashville\u2019s The Lipstick Lounge for more than two decades, believes the culture will live on. \u201cI will always believe that at the heart of any bar resides a common language, whatever that may be,\u201d Suppan said. \u201cWhen you see your people, you know. I think it\u2019s much easier to build community within a space of like-minded individuals.\u201d For any lesbian bar, creating that common space is the goal. And especially in the South, it means the community they build isn\u2019t just valued, it\u2019s essential, even if you have to search to find it.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/15/us/lesbian-bars-south-cec/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/16/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_14_business_boeing-737-max-dutch-roll-investigation", "text": "Federal authorities and Boeing are trying to figure out why a 737 Max 8 experienced a rare, unsafe back-and-forth roll during flight. The oscillating motion is known as a Dutch roll, and one characteristic described by the Federal Aviation Administration is the nose of an aircraft making a figure-eight. There were no injuries onboard Southwest Airlines flight 746 on May 25, according to the airline and a preliminary report by the FAA. The report said the crew \u201cregained control,\u201d and the plane safely landed. But the aircraft suffered \u201csubstantial\u201d damage and the FAA classified the incident as an \u201caccident.\u201d The FAA report said an inspection \u201crevealed damage to the standby PCU,\u201d or power control unit, which controls the rudder. It is unclear if the damaged unit led to or was a result of the roll. The plane has not flown since landing in Oakland, California after the incident, except to move it to a Boeing facility in Washington state. Boeing did not immediately comment to CNN. Southwest told CNN it referred the incident to the FAA and National Transportation Safety Board and is participating in and supporting the investigation. The incident occurred almost three weeks ago and was added to a FAA database this week. There were 175 passengers and six crew onboard, according to the airline. The NTSB confirmed it has opened an investigation into this incident. Investigators have downloaded data from the flight data recorder, which \u201cwill aid investigators in determining the length and severity of the event.\u201d Voice recordings from the voice data recorder \u2013 the other of the so-called black boxes - were overwritten. In February, the FAA required airlines flying some 737 Max 8 and similar aircraft to inspect the rudder assembly for loose or missing nut, washer and bolt. It said the flaw would prevent the pilots from controlling the rudder using foot pedals. Authorities have not said if this condition and the Dutch roll last month are related. An unusual motion Most passengers have never felt a plane make this movement \u2014 and most airline pilots have never experienced it in actual flight. \u201cIt\u2019s very obscure,\u201d aviation safety analyst and former airline pilot Kathleen Bangs told CNN.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s a very uncomfortable movement and you feel the tail swinging around.\u201d While moving forward in flight, airplanes can pivot along three axis:\u00a0Nose up and down, known as pitch; wings dipping down or raising up, known as roll;\u00a0and the tail shifting left or right, known as yaw. Airliners turn using a typically seamless combination of roll and yaw coordinated by the aircraft\u2019s computers. These large aircraft also have yaw dampers that make small adjustments throughout flight. In the Dutch roll, the plane both rolls and yaws excessively.\u00a0Passengers would feel the plane shift to one side, and back to the other \u2014 moving back and forth, Bangs said. She said airline pilots train for scenarios where their yaw dampers fail.\u00a0They could take an aircraft simulator to a high altitude and turn off the yaw damper. \u201cThen you stomp on a rudder pedal really hard to try to initiate [the roll] in the simulator,\u201d Bangs said. To get out of a Dutch roll, pilots can slow the aircraft and descend to thicker air. Modern airliners are designed to be inherently stable in air, she said, so the plane may return to level flight with minimal additional input. But the forces can be powerful. In 1959, four of the eight occupants on a Boeing 707 test and training flight were killed just outside of Washington, DC, after extremely steep Dutch rolls. \u201cThe aircraft immediately yawed and rolled violently to the right,\u201d reads a report from the Civil Aeronautics Board, which investigated the incident. \u201cSeveral gyrations followed and after control of the aircraft was regained, it was determined that three of the four engines had separated from the aircraft and it was on fire.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/14/business/boeing-737-max-dutch-roll-investigation/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/16/2024", "section": "us"}}

{"id": "2024_06_14_us_catholic-bishops-indigenous-apology-reaj", "text": "The US Conference of Catholic Bishops issued a\u00a0formal apology Friday to Indigenous people for the mistreatment and trauma inflicted by the Catholic Church. The apology is part of a document approved by US Catholic bishops by a vote during its annual spring meeting in Louisville, Kentucky. The document titled\u00a0\u201cKeeping Christ\u2019s Sacred Promise: A Pastoral Framework for Indigenous Ministry,\u201d\u00a0includes the apology, discusses the church\u2019s role in the\u00a0boarding schools for Native American that forced assimilation in the 19th and 20th centuries, and sets a series of new policies for ministering to Indigenous Catholics. The vote passed 181-2 with three abstentions. \u201cToday, many North American Indigenous Catholics trace their faith to the decision of their ancestors to embrace Catholicism hundreds of years ago. Sadly, many Indigenous Catholics have felt a sense of abandonment in their relationship with Church leaders due to a lack of understanding of their unique cultural needs,\u201d the document states. \u201cWe apologize for the failure to nurture, strengthen, honor, recognize, and appreciate those entrusted to our pastoral care.\u201d Native Americans comprise approximately 3.5% of Catholics in the United States, according to the UCCB. In the document, the bishops described how Native Americans were forced to assimilate to White culture by the church. \u201cIn these schools, Indigenous children were forced to abandon their traditional languages, dress, and customs,\u201d the bishops said in the document. \u201cBoarding schools were seen as one expedient means to achieve this cultural assimilation because they separated Indigenous children from their families and Tribes and \u201cAmericanized\u201d\u00a0them while they were still malleable,\u201d the document adds. The guidelines issued Friday call on Catholic bishops to promote and expand healing and reconciliation with Native American communities, set up listening sessions and provide training for \u201cclergy, religious, and lay leaders to better minister to the pastoral needs of Indigenous Peoples,\u201d according to the document. \u201cWe must go beyond an apology to take concrete actions, if we are to restore trust within these communities and demonstrate our true willingness to be transparent, present, and accountable to them,\u201d the document states. Most Rev. Chad Zielinski, chairman of the conference\u2019s subcommittee on Native American affairs, said during the first day of the meeting on Thursday that the framework has been requested for a long time. Its goal is to help bishops refocus and \u2018reinvigorate\u2019 the ministry, he said. \u201cThis pastoral framework has been anticipated by Catholic indigenous communities in the US, who have long requested renewed pastoral attention and support from the bishops for their efforts on evangelization, reconciliation and healing, education and addressing matters of justice and social concerns in native communities,\u201d Zielinski said.  For years, advocates and Indigenous leaders have worked to raise awareness about harm inflicted on Indigenous children in boarding schools in the US and Canada and the subsequent generational trauma.  Hundreds of those schools were run or directly supported by the federal government to assimilate children into White society, but many were run by religious groups and churches after Congress passed the Civilization Fund Act in 1819. The legislation provided religious organizations with the resources to run more than a hundred schools for Native American children. Many operated like military training camps where children were subject to abuse, neglect and corporal punishment. In 2022, Pope Francis apologized for the Catholic Church\u2019s role in the abuse of Canada\u2019s Indigenous people, following the discovery of hundreds of unmarked graves on the grounds of former boarding schools and a years-long initiative by the federal government to investigate and create a historical record of the schools. Indigenous leaders in the US continue calling for a similar apology from the Pope.  In the US, Interior Secretary Deb Haaland launched an initiative to investigate the boarding schools that released initial findings in 2022, showing that 19 boarding schools accounted for the deaths of more than 500 American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian children.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/14/us/catholic-bishops-indigenous-apology-reaj/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/16/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_13_us_washington-makah-tribe-harpoon-whales", "text": "The United States granted the Makah Indian Tribe in Washington state a long-sought waiver Thursday that helps clear the way for its first sanctioned whale hunts since 1999 and sets the stage for renewed clashes with animal rights activists. The Makah, a tribe of 1,500 people on the northwestern tip of the Olympic Peninsula, is the only Native American tribe with a treaty that specifically mentions a right to hunt whales. But it has faced more than two decades of court challenges, bureaucratic hearings and scientific review as it seeks to resume hunting for gray whales. The decision by NOAA Fisheries grants a waiver under the Marine Mammal Protection Act, which otherwise forbids harming marine mammals. It allows the tribe to hunt up to 25 Eastern North Pacific gray whales over 10 years, with a limit of two to three per year. There are roughly 20,000 whales in that population. The tribe celebrated the decision but said it took far too long. \u201cWhaling remains central to the identity, culture, subsistence, and spirituality of the Makah people, and we regard the Gray Whale as sacred,\u201d Makah Tribal Council Chairman Timothy J. Greene Sr. said in a written statement. \u201cIn the time since our last successful hunt in 1999, we have lost many elders who held the knowledge of our whaling customs, and another entire generation of Makahs has grown up without the ability to exercise our Treaty right or experience the connections and benefits of whaling that our ancestors secured for us.\u201d The hunts will be timed to avoid harming endangered Western North Pacific gray whales that sometimes visit the area \u2014 about 200 to 300 remain \u2014 as well as a group of about 200 gray whales that generally spend summer and fall feeding along the Northwest coast. Nevertheless, some hurdles remain. The tribe must enter into a cooperative agreement with the agency under the Whaling Convention Act, and it must obtain a permit to hunt, a process that involves a monthlong public comment period. Animal rights advocates, who have long opposed whaling, could also challenge NOAA\u2019s decision in court. DJ Schubert, a senior wildlife biologist with the Washington, DC-based Animal Welfare Institute, said his organization would object to the issuance of the hunt permit but likely wait until final approvals are given before deciding whether to sue. He noted that while the Eastern North Pacific gray whale population appears healthy now, it has fluctuated wildly in recent years, and no one knows how the whales will fare as climate change continues to affect the Arctic. Scientists estimate that as much as\u00a040% of the population died off\u00a0from 2018 to last year before it began to recover. \u201cWe completely respect the tribe\u2019s cultural practices and traditions,\u201d Schubert said. \u201cWe just fundamentally disagree that they need to hunt whales to continue those traditions. We hope that as this decision-making process plays out, perhaps the Makah Tribe and the government could reconsider the need to hunt whales and advocate for protection instead of persecution.\u201d Archeological evidence shows that Makah hunters in cedar canoes killed whales for sustenance from time immemorial, a practice that ceased only in the early 20th century after commercial whaling vessels depleted the population. By 1994, the Eastern Pacific gray whale population had rebounded, and they were removed from the endangered species list. Seeing an opportunity to reclaim its heritage, the tribe announced plans to hunt again. The Makah trained for months in the ancient ways of whaling and received the blessing of federal officials and the International Whaling Commission. They took to the water in 1998 but didn\u2019t succeed until the next year, when they harpooned a gray whale from a hand-carved cedar canoe. A tribal member in a motorized support boat killed it with a high-powered rifle to minimize its suffering. It was the tribe\u2019s first successful hunt in 70 years. The hunts drew protests from animal rights activists, who sometimes threw smoke bombs at the whalers and sprayed fire extinguishers into their faces. Others veered motorboats between the whales and the tribal canoes to interfere with the hunt. Authorities seized several vessels and made arrests. After animal rights groups sued, the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals overturned federal approval of the tribe\u2019s whaling plans. The court found that the tribe needed to obtain a waiver under the 1972 Marine Mammal Protection Act. Eleven Alaska Native communities in the Arctic have such a waiver for subsistence hunts, allowing them to kill bowhead whales \u2014 even though bowheads are listed as endangered. The Makah Tribe applied for a waiver in 2005. The process repeatedly stalled as new scientific information about the whales and the health of their population was uncovered. Some of the Makah whalers became so frustrated with the delays that they went on a rogue hunt in 2007, killing a gray whale that got away from them and sank. They were convicted in federal court.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/13/us/washington-makah-tribe-harpoon-whales/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/16/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_15_business_child-care-crisis-providers", "text": "For the past eight years in the small city of Waupaca, Wisconsin, Susan Elandt has been a fixture for dozens of families \u2014 taking care of their children, some as early as 4:45 a.m., so they can get to work. \u201cMost of our parents, when they drop off, are like, \u2018I could never do what you do,\u2019\u201d Elandt says. \u201cAnd my response is always, \u2018Well, I can\u2019t do what you do either! So I\u2019ll watch your kids and you go do that, because I\u2019m better at this.\u2019\u201d Elandt is the owner and operator of My First Adventure Child Care and Preschool \u2014 but only for a few more weeks. She announced in May that she\u2019s closing her doors before the end of August. \u201cIt\u2019s emotionally and physically and mentally demanding,\u201d Elandt says. \u201cThere\u2019s not benefits. The pay is not anywhere near what it should be. And we don\u2019t get a lot of professional recognition in the community, either, for the value of the work that we do.\u201d Like so many centers around the country, My First Adventure is feeling the squeeze of a child care crisis that\u2019s crippling parents and providers alike. Nationwide, the average yearly cost of care rose to $11,582 per child last year, according to Child Care Aware of America\u2019s latest\u00a0annual report. Placing two kids at a child care center cost at least 25% more than the typical rent, on average, in every state. And the tab exceeded annual\u00a0typical\u00a0mortgage payments in 45 states, plus the District of Columbia. The report looked at care for an infant and a 4-year-old. While the price of keeping children in care is sky-high, the burden of running these centers is equally unsustainable. Running a center comes with a battery of expenses, from hefty insurance policies to \u201cconsumables\u201d such as art supplies, books and food. Tight margins don\u2019t leave much room for the biggest cost \u2014 staff \u2014 which is also Elandt\u2019s biggest challenge. \u201cIf you were going to pay your teachers what they were worth even based off of basic education and experience, you would need to charge the parents so much that you would have no children in your center, no could parents afford care,\u201d she says. The basic costs of employing enough staff to comply with legal and safety requirements in child care centers are already high. The costs are also compounded by the additional expenses of fielding high staff turnover, due in large part to the low wages that these employers can afford to pay. Over the years, Elandt has struggled to keep employees because she can\u2019t compete with what\u2019s offered by local factories or even fast food restaurants. The typical hourly wage for a child care worker in Wisconsin is $13.78, according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. \u201cIt\u2019s very humbling to go to work every day and pass Help Wanted signs at McDonald\u2019s and Hardee\u2019s, and they are paying more money than child care providers can afford to pay their staff,\u201d says Lydia Higgins, a teacher at My First Adventure. The child care industry got a brief boost during the Covid-19 pandemic, as federal funding allowed providers to give their staff much-needed raises and bonuses, as well as cover their rent, mortgages and utilities and buy personal protective equipment and other supplies. Elandt was able to bring up her starting salaries from $8 or $9 an hour to $12 and reward more experienced teachers, attracting and retaining enough employees to keep the center open during the depths of the pandemic. Facing a \u201cchild care cliff\u201d The historic $24 billion federal investment helped more than 225,000 providers nationwide \u2014 or more than 8 in 10 licensed child care centers \u2014 and affected as many as 10 million children. But it expired last September, leaving many centers facing what\u2019s been dubbed \u201cthe child care cliff.\u201d An analysis last year by The Century Foundation projected that more than 70,000 child care programs could close and about 3.2 million children could lose their spots due to the end of the federal child care stabilization grant program, which Congress approved as part of the 2021 American Rescue Plan Act. Multiple states have beefed up their child care investments in recent years, but it\u2019s generally not enough to keep all providers afloat. Elandt has implemented several rate increases for parents in the last year, knowing it would increase their burden. She felt there was no other choice because a return to pre-pandemic salaries would likely mean losing her whole staff. In some cases the higher wages weren\u2019t enough. A few months ago, she says, one of her employees left for a factory: \u201cShe needed to make a living.\u201d The stresses of managing a tight budget and dealing with staff turnover have taken a toll.Elandt first started thinking seriously about leaving her business two years ago and tried to sell, but no viable option emerged. In May, she made the formal announcement that this summer would be the center\u2019s last. The news left families and staff scrambling. Higgins, who is also a parent at My First Adventure, described the moment as \u201cpanic.\u201d As more and more child care providers and parents find themselves struggling through this crisis, she hopes bigger picture solutions will emerge. \u201cIt needs to start with an awareness of how critical this crisis is, and not just from the parents that are terrified and suffering through it, but as a whole picture as a whole country,\u201d Higgins said. \u201cI think everybody was really aware during the height of the pandemic, with the critical workers and things like that. I don\u2019t know if that has started to fade out for people.\u201d The city of Waupaca is actively trying to help facilitate a sale to keep the facility or re-open it under new ownership. As it stands, My First Adventure is expected to close in July. This fall will find Elandt in the public school system, where she\u2019s found joy the past few months working as a substitute teacher. Both she and Higgins say they plan to get more involved in activism to raise the voices of child care workers and fight for better conditions. \u201cWe are literally shaping tomorrow\u2019s youth,\u201d Higgins says. \u201cI think that needs to start being reflected in compensation and policies and where government funding is being directed.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/15/business/child-care-crisis-providers/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/16/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_04_11_us_creating-catan-board-games-card-cec", "text": "When Guido and Benjamin Teuber were young, their father would sit them down at a table in their small family home in Hessia, Germany on Sundays \u2014 the only day he wasn\u2019t working 12 hours as a master dental technician \u2014 to play board games. It was more than fun between father and sons: Klaus Teuber, who passed away last year, became a renowned board game creator. In 1995, Klaus Teuber released Catan (then called The Settlers of Catan) in Germany. The game would go on to become one of the most popular in the world. The brothers recall a day around 10 years ago when they tested out an early version of a Catan expansion with their parents. It was so unplayable that their mother left the table to go do the laundry. Such visions of family and friends huddled around a board game are universal. Everyone has their version \u2014 maybe it involves Parcheesi, or one of the hundreds of versions of Monopoly, or a raucous round of Cards Against Humanity at a party. With 19% of people worldwide playing board games as a hobby and the global board game market reaching almost $17 billion in 2023, it\u2019s an industry that\u2019s hard to ignore. Big box retailers and bookstores have shelves dedicated to games, and you can even find board game cafes in cities around the world. Tabletop games, such as Risk and Clue, are the most popular segment of board games, closely followed by card and dice games like Uno and Pandemic: The Cure. Tabletop games also encompass role-playing games like the iconic Dungeons & Dragons. Whether you\u2019re a dedicated hobby player or a casual board gamer, have you ever stopped to wonder what, exactly, it takes to create one of the beautiful board games you see everywhere? For National Board Game Day on April 11, CNN spoke with designers, artists, marketers and publishers of some of the most popular board games in the world to understand what it takes to build a game from scratch. Building the story of a board game Like a board game itself, developing a game requires both creativity and strategy at every stage \u2014 from ideation to playtesting to picking out the components, finding vendors and shipping the game. Patience, according to Benjamin Teuber, is key. After working with their father at the company for many years, Benjamin and his brother Guido\u00a0now run Catan GmbH, as the managing director and CEO, respectively. Since its release in 1995, the strategy game about collecting resources such as lumber, ore and grain, and using them to build empires has spawned numerous expansions and alternate versions. Tiles of the various resources form the game board, along with resource cards and models of roads, towns and cities in each player\u2019s color. To date, Catan has sold over 45 million copies worldwide. For Benjamin Teuber, who worked closely on the development of games with his father Klaus for over 10 years, the first step is writing down ideas for a new game. Then he takes about a month to think about these ideas, the story he wants to tell, and what some of the mechanics could be. \u201cThe story is always the core,\u201d says Benjamin Teuber. \u201cIf the story is well reflected in the mechanics, that is the point when you start making notes, then off the notes maybe some sketches on the computer in a graphic program.\u201d From there, he prints the first prototype on paper to play the game himself. Bringing the story to life The development process for Wyrmspan, which was released on March 29 by Stonemaier Games, was slightly different to that of CATAN. Wyrmspan is a spinoff of the award-winning Wingspan (also by Stonemaier), but instead of enticing birds to habitats on your board (with each bird represented on individual cards), you\u2019re building caves with various types of dragons. A dragon variation was one of the most requested spinoffs of the original, says Connie Vogelmann, Wyrmspan\u2019s designer. When Jamey Stegmaier, a co-founder of Stonemaier, approached Vogelmann to design the game in early 2022, the first step was to get approval from Wingspan designer Elizabeth Hargrave, who signed on as a developer for Wyrmspan. Because Vogelmann had a pre-existing game system, the development process for Wyrmspan was a bit faster than average. \u201cIt took about a year, or 15 months, to get the core of the game locked in,\u201d says Vogelmann. For context, the idea for Catan: New Energies, which is set to release in May, was in development around 10 years ago before getting shelved. During the pandemic, they revisited the idea and have been working on it since. The biggest design challenge, Vogelmann says, was paying homage to Wingspan while making Wyrmspan unique. \u201cIn some ways it was easier, because it provided some constraints for the game, but in some ways it was much, much harder.\u201d Vogelmann and Hargrave went through many iterations for Wyrmspan \u2014 for a while it was actually a bag-building game, where players\u2019 actions are affected by tokens added to or removed from a bag. Then, \u201cmid to late in the process,\u201d Vogelmann says they imported the Wingspan player mats into Wyrmspan, which is when the game clicked. \u201cThat was kind of the missing secret sauce.\u201d Playing, testing and playing again Once the designer has an initial prototype for a board game, they usually go straight into playtesting mode. For Jane Hoffacker, CEO of game studio Incredible Dream, this also includes printing the game on paper. Prior to co-founding Incredible Dream in 2020, Hoffacker worked in production and video games. They started at Activision with Guitar Hero before moving on to Riot Games, where they became an executive producer for the Emmy award-winning Netflix animated series \u201cArcane,\u201d based on League of Legends. \u201cI came in (to board games) with much more of a video game mindset,\u201d says Hoffacker. \u201cWhich was like, \u2018we need to go through 1,000 steps to get to whatever.\u2019\u201d They quickly realized this was not the case. \u201cI could literally print it out on my printer and take it to a local game cafe and sit down with strangers who were very willing to just test with me in person,\u201d Hoffacker says. These paper prototypes are used to test the game before the specific mechanics are set. Aside from game cafes, Hoffacker and the Incredible Dream team also take prototypes to game conventions where \u201cthere\u2019s lines of people waiting to play a paper prototype.\u201d These playtesting sessions, where people will play through a prototype of a game to give their feedback, will often result in a series of adjustments \u2014 or, in some cases, scrapping a game completely and going back to the ideation and development phase. Vogelmann, the designer of Wyrmspan, says she\u2019s very much a mechanism-first designer but that playtesting is really where a game\u2019s mechanics become clear. \u201cI tend to iterate and prototype very, very, very quickly,\u201d Vogelmann says. Her philosophy is to print it out and get it onto a paper page as soon as possible \u2014 no matter how ugly the prototype is. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard to envision how things are gonna play out \u2014 they play out one way in your head, they were perfect in your head, then you get to the table and it falls apart.\u201d From there, it\u2019s clear what works and what doesn\u2019t, and Vogelmann can try again. For Benjamin Teuber, the iteration process for Catan looks very similar, although the playtesting is quite different from most board game studios. When doing the first playtest with another person, he says it \u201cnormally completely fails.\u201d After this, he already knows whether it makes sense to continue developing or not. \u201cIn some cases, you will also have to say at some point, it just didn\u2019t work. It doesn\u2019t draw the people to the table \u2014 and you have to let it go.\u201d Making the game a physical reality Game development doesn\u2019t end once the mechanics and design are set. From there, developers work to get a finished game into the hands of players. This includes everything from finalizing the art and finding vendors to manufacture the game\u2019s parts, to deciding on what physical elements can be included \u2014 and in what form \u2014\u00a0based on the target demographic and price point. \u201cWe spent a lot of time trying to get the components right,\u201d Hoffacker says. Often, this has included working with a publisher (like Stonemaier) to finalize the elements and try to keep costs down through existing relationships. Increasingly, indie board game studios are using crowdfunding platforms to launch their games \u2014 offering stretch goals to upgrade certain elements to a premium look or feel. It\u2019s not just about the art \u2014 it\u2019s also about something as simple as font size, or how each element feels in someone\u2019s hand. For Incredible Dream\u2019s upcoming title A Gentle Rain, which it describes as a \u201ccozy tile placement game,\u201d each tile has a soft velvet feeling, with UV spot treatments on the back that look like a drop of water. \u201cWhen you touch it, you can actually feel all the ripples and it kind of feels nice as you\u2019re placing the tiles down,\u201d says Hoffacker. \u201cThen you\u2019re also supposed to place these tokens which are made out of wood, so it kind of mixes up the tactile feel between components.\u201d Another version of the game is being produced specifically for the mass consumer market, with 3D-sculpted plastic flowers instead of the wooden tokens. This version will be sent to big box stores such as Target, says Hoffacker. The quick turn for Wyrmspan was, in part, due to having Clementine Campardou, an artist from France, work at the same time as the development for the game \u2014 a process that usually happens after the core mechanics are locked in. Campardou hand-painted everything for Wyrmspan in watercolor, from the game\u2019s box to the backgrounds of the boards and the cards themselves \u2014\u00a075 unique cave cards and 183 unique dragons. This in itself was a challenge, with the team having to be pragmatic. \u201cWhen doing 200 of anything, if each takes 1 day or 5 days, that\u2019s the difference between a 2024 or a 2026 release date,\u201d Campardou told CNN via email. The entire process took Campardou a year and a half, with the first few months spent researching dragons, nature and weird animals. \u201cEven though I took no part in the game design itself, I had to understand how the pieces all fit together,\u201d Campardou says. \u201cFor the dragons, Connie and I worked closely so the classification would somehow match the designs, whether their dominant colour, their size, their family.\u201d One thing that many players don\u2019t think about, says Benjamin Teuber, is the actual cost of each individual element. \u201cYou have the final price of a game, which is so much higher than people think,\u201d he says. \u201cThis little token, or this dice, would make the game 50 cents more expensive \u2026 we always have to try to find the balance between nice and appealing material which is still affordable.\u201d If the game is for a mass consumer market, developers have to be a lot more conscious of the price. These players are often just looking for a fun diversion, says Kelli Schmitz, Director of Brand Development at Catan Studio, who works on Catan\u2019s marketing strategy for the English-speaking world. \u201cYour hobby gamer is a lot less price sensitive,\u201d she says. They understand that the cost isn\u2019t just about the physical components themselves, but also the expertise of the developers and the time it took to create the game. Once the vendors are picked, the parts manufactured, and the boxes compiled, the shipping of the games globally can take anywhere from six to eight months, depending on where the vendors are and the freight company that is chosen. The first print run of Catan in the US was 5,000 units out of a garage in Skokie, Illinois, near the airport, says Guido Teuber. Reflecting on Klaus Teuber\u2019s process for game design and development, Guido Teuber says that his dad always believed in having beautiful prototypes. \u201cHe invested so much time and money into creating these amazing prototypes,\u201d he says. \u201cWe gave our dad a really hard time if it didn\u2019t pan out. We had to be immersed, and he knew it.\u201d Otherwise, Benjamin would read his Mickey Mouse magazines, Guido would play the guitar and their mom would start talking about everything she had to do that day \u2014\u00a0like two loads of laundry. \u201cThe Mickey Mouse magazine \u2014 this is how the urban legend goes \u2014 was his (Klaus\u2019) test to see what was more interesting to me \u2013 the game or the MM magazine?\u201d Benjamin Teuber says. \u201cIf I started looking into it (the magazine) while playing, he knew he needed to get back to the basement and continue.\u201d The expansion game the family played that day 10 years ago did end up becoming something, says Benjamin Teuber \u2014 but it took multiple iterations to get there.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/11/us/creating-catan-board-games-card-cec/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/16/2024", "section": "us"}}

{"id": "2024_06_14_politics_civilian-mariner-missing-houthi-attack", "text": "US forces launched successful attacks late this week on Houthi radars that helped facilitate the Iranian-backed group\u2019s ongoing assaults on ships in the Red Sea, according to US Central Command. CENTCOM said the US military destroyed seven radars in Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen, which had allowed\u00a0\u201cHouthis\u00a0to target maritime vessels and endanger commercial shipping.\u201d The strikes followed a Wednesday Houthi attack on a Liberian-flagged, Greek-owned and operated ship that left one civilian mariner\u00a0missing. The attack on the ship caused severe flooding and damage to the engine room, CENTCOM said. The crew abandoned ship and was rescued by US and partner forces, including the USS Philippine Sea. The cargo ship is still in the Red Sea and is taking on water, CENTCOM said. The ship is drifting from its last reported position, according to the UK Maritime Trade Operations. In addition to the attacks on the radars, US forces destroyed one uncrewed aerial system launched from Yemen and two uncrewed surface vessels in the Red Sea, according to the CENTCOM statement. The Houthis have launched dozens of missile and drone attacks directed at ships in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden since Israel launched its invasion of Gaza following Hamas\u2019 October 7\u00a0attack. On Thursday, Iran-backed Houthi militants struck another cargo ship, the M/V Verbena, in two separate missile attacks in the Gulf of Aden, severely injuring a civilian mariner and causing fires on board, according to CENTCOM. The wounded mariner from the M/V Verbena was medically evacuated by aircraft from a nearby US warship. Two days later, the crew issued a distress call indicating it was abandoning the ship \u201cdue to continued fires and an inability to control them,\u201d CENTCOM said Saturday. Another commercial ship responded to the distress signal and is transporting the mariners to safety. Notably, the Iranian frigate IRIN Jamaran was 8 nautical miles from the M/V Verbena and did not respond to the distress call, CENTCOM said in a statement on X. \u201cThis continued reckless behavior by the Iranian-backed Houthis threatens regional stability and endangers the lives of mariners across the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden. The Houthis claim to be acting on behalf of Palestinians in Gaza and yet they are targeting and threatening the lives of third country nationals who have nothing to do with the conflict in Gaza,\u201d CENTCOM said in a statement earlier this week. \u201cThe ongoing threat to international commerce caused by the Houthis in fact makes it harder to deliver badly needed assistance to the people of Yemen as well as Gaza.\u201d The US and UK have carried out several rounds of strikes against the Houthis in Yemen, including as recently as last week, to try to degrade their weapons supplies. But the Houthis have shown no signs of halting their attacks. \u201cThe United States will continue to act with partners to hold the Houthis accountable and degrade their military capabilities,\u201d CENTCOM said.

{"id": "2024_06_13_us_amy-donofrio-florida-teacher", "text": "A former Jacksonville, Florida, teacher who said she was fired for displaying a Black Lives Matter flag outside her high school classroom will be able to reapply for her teaching license, an attorney representing the teacher confirmed to CNN. Attorney Mark Richard said a five-member panel of Florida\u2019s Education Practices Commission agreed with an administrative judge\u2019s recommendation that Amy Donofrio receive a written reprimand after state officials accused the teacher of bringing her personal views into the classroom. \u201cBlack students matter, and they are worth fighting for 100 percent every single day,\u201d Donofrio said after the hearing. \u201cTeachers across the state feel that way too.\u201d Donofrio said her goal remains to return to the classroom. Her contract with the school was not renewed after the 2020-21 school year. \u201cIt\u2019s a big day in Florida for teachers,\u201d Richard told CNN. \u201cYou can stand up to a system that\u2019s been attacking teachers and prevail.\u201d Thursday\u2019s hearing was prompted by administrative law judge Suzanne Van Wyk\u2019s April recommendation that Donofrio receive a written reprimand for\u00a0wearing and displaying face masks that read \u201cRobert E. Lee was a gang member\u201d as the district was in the process of renaming six schools. Donofrio was a beloved and highly regarded high school teacher in Jacksonville, where for years\u00a0she\u00a0sought to empower students and advocate for racial justice. Outside the room where she taught English to mostly Black students at the former Robert E. Lee High School she had placed a sign that read, \u201cHate Has No Home Here,\u201d according to the April order by an administrative law judge. \u201cMs. Donofrio was a pillar for us,\u201d former student Diamond Wallace, 24, told CNN this week. \u201cShe acted as a rock for us and she was more like a mom, like a second mom to all of us students.\u201d  At the start of the 2020 school year,\u00a0in the aftermath of\u00a0George Floyd\u2019s murder\u00a0at the hands of\u00a0police in Minneapolis, Donofrio,\u00a0who is White, put up a large \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d banner outside her classroom.\u00a0She had displayed\u00a0a BLM sign and t-shirt in her classroom as early as 2018, according to\u00a0findings in\u00a0the administrative judge\u2019s\u00a0recommendation. Administrators\u00a0asked her to remove it,\u00a0and expressed concern the display might violate school district\u00a0policy. Donofrio refused. She said she believed the policy did not apply to the banner.\u00a0On March 23, 2021, a school administrator removed the banner \u2013\u00a0about five months after she was first asked to bring it down. A day later Donofrio was reassigned to a work at a district warehouse. School officials had also voiced concerns that Donofrio\u00a0displayed Robert E. Lee face masks in her classroom\u00a0\u2013 which they considered to be an expression of her personal view. At the time the school district was in the process of renaming six schools named for Confederate generals.\u00a0Donofrio denied the masks \u2013 which were common during the pandemic \u2013 were on display. She said the logo \u201cI am not a gang member\u201d was a phrase students use as part of their advocacy of racial justice, according to the administrative judge\u2019s findings. Van\u00a0Wyk\u2019s order noted in part that the \u201coffense was not severe\u201d and there was no danger or harm to the public or students. The judge determined there was no evidence that Donofrio\u00a0\u201cfailed to distinguish between her personal views and those of the School, or District\u201d when she displayed the Black Lives Matter banner or that it went against district policy, according to her findings. The five-person panel of the Education Practices Commission \u2013 a member of law enforcement, a parent and three teachers \u2013 had the final say and could have revoked her teaching license. The quasi-judicial state agency imposes discipline on teachers and school administrators. \u201cI\u2019m not doing the thing that I was born to do, that I loved more than anything and I\u2019m having to fight to get it back,\u201d Donofrio, who taught at the school for nine years but has not been allowed back in a Florida classroom since 2021, told CNN earlier this week. She added, \u201cSchool is supposed to be a safe place for students. It\u2019s about them.\u201d Florida Education officials didn\u2019t respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment ahead of the hearing. The decision on Donofrio\u2019s future as a teacher came at a time when Florida\u2019s classrooms have become front lines in Gov. Ron DeSantis\u2019 culture wars, which have taken aim at\u00a0every aspect of education from\u00a0formal classroom\u00a0instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity to what\u00a0public\u00a0schools teach about racism and American history to what books students can read and what\u00a0bathrooms they can use. \u201cOur school system should be about educating kids not indoctrinating kids,\u201d\u00a0DeSantis told reporters in May 2023. \u2018I\u2019m a passionate, quality teacher\u2019 In 2021, the BLM banner\u00a0hanging over\u00a0Donofrio\u2019s\u00a0classroom door, as well as her outspokenness on racial justice,\u00a0became\u00a0a political flash point across the state. Her advocacy of racial justice was\u00a0brought up in discussions\u00a0about whether the school should abandon its Confederate namesake. The school was renamed Riverside High School in\u00a0June\u00a02021. Days before the banner was taken down, the district published a memo that stated \u201cemployees are not permitted to display flags, banners or other signage representing a particular social cause or movement in a manner that may be interpreted as District speech,\u201d and identified \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d as \u201can expression of support for a social justice movement,\u201d according to the administrative judge\u2019s\u00a0recommended\u00a0order. Florida\u2019s former education commissioner\u00a0called it an example of \u201cindoctrination\u201d and \u201ccritical race theory\u201d in schools \u2013 even though the discipline was not part of Donofrio\u2019s curriculum. \u201cThere was an entire classroom memorialized to Black Lives Matter,\u201d the former commissioner, Richard Corcoran, told reporters at the time. \u201cWe made sure she was terminated.\u201d Donofrio was not fired even as she defied multiple requests from school officials to take down the flag. She also challenged the district on its treatment of Black students and staff. Her students responded by collecting nearly 18,000 signatures on a public petition calling for her return. \u201cI wasn\u2019t removed for anything having to do with my teaching,\u201d Donofrio said. \u201cNo one has ever been able to say anything.\u00a0Nor of my test scores, right, reflected anything but that I\u2019m a passionate, quality teacher.\u201d Donofrio eventually sued Duval County Public Schools and its regional high school superintendent in federal court, alleging that the district retaliated against her \u201cfor her protected speech, her complaints about discrimination, and, more broadly, her support of Black students\u2019 lives,\u201d according to a complaint\u00a0filed in April 2021. The school board paid $300,000 to settle the lawsuit in 2021, according to CNN affiliate WJXT. \u201cI really thought that things were kind of moving forward and then suddenly, we turned human compassion into something that\u2019s controversial,\u201d Donofrio said. Donofrio\u2019s outspokenness on racial justice was not new. Even before she put out the Black Lives Matter flag, she had led a course for several years to empower Black students through professional development, college preparation and civic engagement. \u201cFor her to be able to make teenagers feel comfortable enough to come in her classroom and express the trauma that they have gone through voluntarily, that\u2019s a gift,\u201d said Wallace\u2019s mother, Renita Turner. Donofrio and her students\u00a0earned national attention, and the course eventually became the organization known as the\u00a0EVAC Movement.\u00a0Students traveled to the White House in 2016 and met with congressional leaders. Then-President Barack Obama met with them when he visited Jacksonville. \u201cIt is honestly the most beautiful thing I have ever been a part of,\u201d Donofrio recalled this week,\u00a0referring to the EVAC movement\u00a0and the attention it garnered for her students. \u201cTeachers have gathered to swing back in the name of teaching honest history, teaching honestly to their students,\u201d said Donofrio\u2019s lawyer, Mark Richard. \u201cWe do not want to be caught in these culture wars.\u201d Donofrio added, \u201cMy students matter, teachers who care about students matter \u2026 I have no doubt that with or without me, they\u2019re going to change the world.\u201d CNN\u2019s Harmeet Kaur contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/13/us/amy-donofrio-florida-teacher/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/16/2024", "section": "us"}}
