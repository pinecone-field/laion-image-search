{"id": "2024_06_21_economy_us-homes-prices-record-high", "text": "Homes in America are the most expensive they\u2019ve ever been, according to one measure. The median price of a previously owned US home climbed for the eleventh consecutive month in May, up 5.8% from a year ago, to $419,300, the National Association of Realtors said Friday. That\u2019s the highest price ever recorded by NAR. \u201cHome prices reaching new highs are creating a wider divide between those owning properties and those who wish to be first-time buyers,\u201d NAR\u2019s chief economist Lawrence Yun said in a release. \u201cStill, first-time buyers in the market understand the long-term benefits of owning.\u201d Housing affordability remains in the gutter: In addition to sky-high home prices, mortgage rates are still higher than anything seen in the decade before 2022. There still aren\u2019t enough homes in the market to keep up with demand, despite some improvements in recent months. The situation could improve somewhat later this year, when the Federal Reserve is expected to begin paring back interest rates from a 23-year high, which should bring down mortgage rates. But Fed officials have penciled in just one rate cut for this year, and the days of ultra-low interest rates are long gone. Economists don\u2019t expect the average mortgage rate to fall below 6% in 2024. Recent research from Zillow shows that in order for a median-income household to afford a monthly mortgage payment on the typical US home, it would need to save up more than $127,000 for a down payment. That\u2019s roughly double the median salary of a US worker. Potential homebuyers are indeed facing a tough market, but that doesn\u2019t seem to be deterring some: Sales of previously owned homes in the US are up from the decades lows in the fall and only edged lower by 0.7% in May to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.11 million. What\u2019s going on with housing supply? When supply doesn\u2019t keep up with demand, it pushes up prices. That\u2019s been the case in the US housing market for decades now. However, there have been some steps in the right direction: Total housing inventory has steadily increased throughout this year, according to NAR data. Inventory at the end of May stood at 1.28 million units, 6.7% higher from April and up 18.5% from a year ago. Homeowners who locked in a low rate before the\u00a0Fed\u00a0began to hike in 2022 have been unwilling or unable to sell their homes because of months of elevated mortgage\u00a0rates. But the recent growth in inventory may mean that homeowners are finally parting with their homes out of necessity because of life events such as marriage, divorce or new children, NAR\u2019s Yun has said. New home construction also contributes to housing supply, but high interest rates seem to have pumped the brakes on homebuilding. Housing starts fell in May to their lowest level since 2020, according to government statistics released Thursday, dropping by 5.5% from April. Building permits, seen as a forward indicator of future construction, came in below economists\u2019 expectations.

{"id": "2024_06_20_us_baltimore-bridge-collapse-ship-crew-deal", "text": "Twelve weeks after the Dali cargo ship lost power and crashed into a famed Baltimore bridge, the mammoth vessel will soon leave for repairs \u2013 with only a handful of crew on board. The 20 Indians and one Sri Lankan on board have been stuck on the ship since March 26, when the 984-foot ship lost propulsion, veered off course and destroyed the Francis Scott Key Bridge \u2013 killing six construction workers. They\u2019ve been unable to leave for a variety of reasons. But at a Thursday court hearing, a judge approved a deal that would allow eight of the crew members to fly home as early as this week. And on Friday, a spokesperson for the crew\u2019s employer said federal authorities have cleared two more seamen to return home halfway around the world. The two newly cleared crew members are both cadets who were on board as part of a training program when the tragedy unfolded, said Darrell Wilson, a spokesperson for ship manager Synergy Marine. As for the 213-million-pound vessel, which has been docked at Baltimore\u2019s Seagirt Marine Terminal for a month, the Dali is now tentatively scheduled to leave for Norfolk, Virginia, on Monday for repairs. Four crew members will stay on board for the voyage, said the Rev. Joshua Messick, director of the Baltimore International Seafarers\u2019 Center and chaplain for the Port of Baltimore. The crew members who do not have clearance to fly home \u2013 including all the ship\u2019s officers \u2013 must stay in the United States until litigation involving the crash is finished, which could take more than a year, Messick said Thursday. Wilson, the Synergy Marine spokesperson, could not confirm whether the remaining crew members will be forced to stay in the US until the end of litigation. But he said they\u2019re remaining in the US for now \u201cbecause they are participating in the investigation.\u201d The crew members who will stay indefinitely in the US will be moved to hotels or apartments, Messick said. \u201cThey\u2019re anxious, under considerable stress considering they don\u2019t know what the future holds,\u201d Messick said Thursday. \u201cThey don\u2019t know when they\u2019ll see their family again or how they\u2019ll be treated here.\u201d The drama over 8 crew members\u2019 fate While none of the crew members have been charged in connection with the disaster, investigations are underway to determine who might be responsible. Baltimore\u2019s mayor has announced legal action, vowing to \u201chold the wrongdoers responsible.\u201d Attorneys for the city and for a bridge inspector who nearly died in the disaster want to depose the crew members, according to filings in the US District Court of Maryland. But legal technicalities have prevented them from doing so, said Jason Foster, an attorney representing the bridge inspector. The attorneys expressed shock in court documents this week after receiving an email from William Bennett, an attorney representing the ship\u2019s owner and manager, saying eight crew members might soon be able to fly home. \u201cOur clients are in the process of arranging for replacement crew for the DALI,\u201d Bennett wrote in an email to dozens of recipients Tuesday. \u201cWe have been advised that the U.S. Coast Guard will permit certain crew members to return to their home countries but has requested that other crew members remain in the United States.\u201d The eight eligible crew members do not include any officers, Wilson said. They include a cook, a fitter, an oiler and several able-bodied seamen. \u201cAll of these crew members have been interviewed by DOJ and DOJ does not object to their departure from the United States,\u201d Bennett wrote in his email, which was attached to court filings. CNN has reached out to the Department of Justice and the US Coast Guard for comment. Attorneys for the city and the bridge inspector filed emergency motions this week, asking a judge to temporarily ban any crew members from leaving the US because they hadn\u2019t been deposed. But opposing sides reached an agreement late Wednesday that would protect attorneys\u2019 ability to get sworn statements from the crew while allowing some of the seamen to go home. Their depositions \u201cwill be taken in London or elsewhere by written agreement of all parties to the Litigation,\u201d according to terms of the agreement filed in court. The depositions will take place \u201cno sooner than November 2024,\u201d the document states. Synergy Marine and Grace Ocean must make the crew members available for depositions in the months ahead and provide documents including personnel files, employment contracts and training files, according to the terms of the deal. A judge approved the agreement Thursday. But it\u2019s still unclear exactly when those eight seamen will get to leave, Wilson said. Why the crew wasn\u2019t deposed earlier No civil lawsuits can get underway because of a pending request by the ship\u2019s owner and manager to limit their financial liability, said Foster, one of the attorneys representing the bridge inspector. Foster said his client narrowly escaped and lost six friends in the bridge collapse. Six days after the catastrophe, Grace Ocean and Synergy Marine filed a petition in federal court\u00a0asking for a $43.6 million cap\u00a0on potential liability payouts. But a decision on that request probably won\u2019t happen anytime soon, since potential claimants have until September 24 to come forward, Foster told CNN Wednesday. And due to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Foster and other attorneys weren\u2019t able to depose the crew members until all of the potential claimants had come forward \u2013 in other words, possibly September or later. But with the new agreement approved Thursday, the eight crew members\u00a0can leave the country before they\u2019re deposed. And if the ship\u2019s owner or manager violates any terms of the agreement, they could face sanctions by the court. How the crew is faring now Despite months-long separation from their families, the seafarers are in good spirits, said Wilson, the Synergy Marine spokesperson. He said the company \u201clooks after them on a daily basis,\u201d helping make sure they have the supplies they need. And local seafarers\u2019 organizations have \u201cbeen tremendous in helping to look after the crew,\u201d Wilson told CNN on Wednesday. The seamen have had pizza and catered foods delivered as well as access to cricket matches broadcast from their home countries \u2013 \u201cyou know, small touches that mean a lot to the crew,\u201d Wilson said. The fate of 11 crew members who must stay in the US remains in limbo. It\u2019s not clear how many more weeks or months they\u2019ll have to stay half a world away from their loved ones. \u201cAs soon as we can get them cleared,\u201d Wilson said, \u201cwe\u2019d like to return them to their families as well.\u201d CNN\u2019s  Mary Kay Mallonee and Jeff Winter contributed to this report.

{"id": "2024_06_21_tech_apple-ai-chatgpt-ban-china", "text": "Apple is banking on its upcoming AI features to boost iPhone sales especially in China, where demand has been lagging. But there\u2019s a problem: ChatGPT \u2014 soon to be integrated into Siri \u2014 is banned in China. In a presentation earlier this month, Apple (AAPL) showed off its proprietary technology called Apple Intelligence to power compelling new AI features and announced a partnership with OpenAI to also use its viral ChatGPT tool in a limited capacity. (When Siri is activated and needs more assistance answering an inquiry, ChatGPT can step in.) The move signaled how Apple is trying to expedite the latest buzzy technology at a time when tech rivals, such as Microsoft, Google, Meta and Samsung, have already found their AI footing. A deal with OpenAI could help Apple close the gap. But China is one of the first countries in the world to regulate the generative AI technology that powers these popular services. In August, the Cyberspace Administration of China, the country\u2019s top internet watchdog, rolled out new guidelines for the industry, requiring companies to seek approval before deployment. The organization has approved more than 100 AI models as of March, all from Chinese companies. According to a report from the Wall Street Journal Thursday, Apple is looking for a Chinese AI company to partner with ahead of the iPhone\u2019s expected September launch, but it hasn\u2019t reached a deal yet. Apple did not respond to a request for comment. The need to find a partner \u2014 and quickly \u2014 comes at a time when Apple\u2019s smartphone sales tumbled a stunning 10% in the first quarter of this year, according to market research firm IDC, due largely to iPhone sales sharply dropping in China. The company has lost momentum in China as nationalism, a rough economy and increased competition have also hurt sales. China is the company\u2019s second-largest market. Trouble in the EU Limitations on its new AI tools may not be specific to China. In a statement sent to CNN following the publication of this article, Apple said it \u201chighly motivated\u201d to bring the features to customers around the world, but it is facing regulatory challenges in the European Union, as well. The company said it doesn\u2019t believe it will be able to roll out its AI features in Europe this year. \u201cDue to the regulatory uncertainties brought about by the Digital Markets Act (DMA), we do not believe that we will be able to roll out three of these features\u2014iPhone Mirroring, SharePlay Screen Sharing enhancements, and Apple Intelligence\u2014to our EU users this year,\u201d a spokesperson said in a statement. \u201cSpecifically, we are concerned that the interoperability requirements of the DMA could force us to compromise the integrity of our products in ways that risk user privacy and data security,\u201d it added. \u201cWe are committed to collaborating with the European Commission in an attempt to find a solution that would enable us to deliver these features to our EU customers without compromising their safety.\u201d Resurgent competitors In China, concerns around iPhone sales continue to mount as Chinese smartphone brand Huawei\u2019s smartphone sales growth was 70% in the first quarter, according to Counterpoint Research. If a solution is not worked out by fall, Chinese consumers may feel short changed and choose to wait until they can get the full AI experience with Apple, she added. \u201cApple is very likely to seek a local partner in China in place of OpenAI, because simply put, it needs to,\u201d said Nabila Popal, a senior director at IDC Research. \u201cChinese consumers are expecting\u00a0their premium phones to have the latest AI functionality and may\u00a0hesitate to spend over $1000 for devices that don\u2019t have all the AI bells and whistles.\u201d \u201cThe real growth in China for Apple will come in the long term, as Apple Intelligence evolves offering more use cases, extends language support beyond English and when Siri can leverage other local AI models to provide the ChatGPT-like function,\u201d Popal said. In the meantime, some AI companies in China may be better suited to target its consumers anyway, such as by offering more local dialects than what\u2019s currently found in foreign AI models, Reece Hayden, an analyst at ABI Research, noted. Apple wouldn\u2019t be the first foreign company to work with the Cyberspace Administration of China for AI and smartphones. In January, Samsung teamed up with Chinese tech giant Baidu (BIDU) to use its AI model to help power its translation service. It works with another AI firm Meitu for photo editing tools. In other parts of the world, Samsung uses its own propriety AI technology, along with Google\u2019s (GOOGL) AI model Gemini, which is also banned in China. Samsung, however, accounts for less than 1% of the total market in China, according to Counterpoint Research. Although the clock is ticking for Apple to secure a partnership ahead of its fall software launch, Jeff Fieldhack, a research director at Counterpoint, believes it will be able to ink a deal in time. \u201cApple should be able to have a partnership aligned very quickly because it has such a strong global install base, and it would be a gem for these companies to work with them,\u201d he said, noting that they\u2019d soon be established as an an AI power player in the country.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/21/tech/apple-ai-chatgpt-ban-china/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/22/2024", "section": "us"}}

Bryan Maclean Howard, 41, faces eight charges of DUI manslaughter stemming from Tuesday\u2019s fatal crash, in which authorities said the 2001 Ford Ranger he was driving traveled toward the center line along Highway 40 west of Ocala and struck a bus carrying more than 50 farm workers. The bus left the roadway, went through a fence and overturned, according to the Florida Highway Patrol. In addition to the eight dead, at least 40 people were injured. Howard pleaded not guilty on Wednesday, online records show. He has been denied bond. CNN has reached out to the public defender\u2019s office for comment. The six\u00a0victims identified\u00a0in\u00a0the arrest\u00a0report were Evarado Ventura Hern\u00e1ndez, 30; Cristian Salazar Villeda, 24; Alfredo Tovar S\u00e1nchez, 20; Isa\u00edas Miranda Pascal, 21; Jos\u00e9 Heriberto Fraga Acosta, 27, and Manuel Perez R\u00edos, 46.

Howard said he did not remember how\u00a0the\u00a0accident\u00a0happened and he was \u201cdriving very carefully\u201d because he was\u00a0involved\u00a0in\u00a0the car\u00a0accident days\u00a0before,\u00a0the\u00a0report says. A prosecutor Wednesday asked the judge to deny bond, in part based on Howard\u2019s criminal history. She listed\u00a0a litany of convictions, many stemming from driving-related infractions and all confirmed by state court records, including that Howard was: \u2022 Found guilty in 2019 of leaving the scene of an accident with property damage \u2022 Twice convicted \u2013 in 2013 and 2018 \u2013 of driving while his license was suspended, canceled or revoked \u2022 Convicted of grand theft in 2013 \u2022 Convicted of leaving the scene of an accident in 2006 CNN has reached out for comment to the public defender\u2019s office.

{"id": "2024_06_21_politics_donald-trump-vice-president-contenders", "text": "Former President Donald Trump has been busy in recent weeks. He was found guilty in his hush money trial in New York, is embroiled in three other legal cases and has continued his campaign to win back the White House. But Trump has another task: Choosing a running mate. With just weeks until the Republican National Convention, where the former president is expected to announce his pick for vice president, sources have told CNN that these are the possible contenders on Trump\u2019s mind. Doug Burgum North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum challenged Trump for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination before suspending his campaign in December. A former Microsoft executive, Burgum is a second-term governor with a conservative track record. He signed a bill last year that bans gender-affirming care for most minors and enacted a near-total ban on abortions in the state. Late last month, Burgum \u2014\u00a0who was among the candidates that received vice-presidential vetting materials from the Trump campaign \u2014 told CNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins that \u201cthe whole discussion about the veepstakes \u2026 is kind of a giant distraction.\u201d \u201c(Trump) can win this election on his own,\u201d Burgum said, adding that the \u201cpeople of this country\u201d are \u201cfocused on the issues\u201d and \u201cnot on who\u2019s going to be the VP.\u201d Marco Rubio With several Trump insiders encouraging the former president to consider a Hispanic running mate, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio \u2014 the son of Cuban immigrants \u2014 could be an appealing choice. Rubio ran against Trump in 2016, positioning himself at the time as the only person who could stop Trump. But since then, Rubio has adopted Trumpism and regularly defends the former president. The senator, who was first elected to his office in 2010, is among the candidates who received vice-presidential vetting materials from the Trump campaign, and if chosen, Rubio would be the first Hispanic running mate on a major party ticket. The senator helped the former president gear up for the June debate against President Joe Biden by participating in a policy discussion. But he faces a potential hurdle. Rubio and Trump are both Florida residents and while there is no law preventing a president and vice president of the US being from the same state,\u00a0the Constitution prevents electors\u00a0from voting for two people from the same state. This could be detrimental if the election is close \u2014\u00a0and the Trump campaign expects it to be so, according to multiple Trump advisers. Rubio has not ruled out changing his residence. J.D. Vance Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance, a freshman, entered Congress with the help of the former president, whose endorsement helped him win a contentious race in 2022. Vance was critical of Trump in 2016, and, six year later, Trump publicly humiliated Vance even after endorsing him in the 2022 election. Still, Vance is an outspoken supporter of Trump in Congress, and often votes in allegiance with the former president\u2019s interests. He opposed a Ukraine aid bill\u00a0earlier this year, adopting Trump\u2019s criticism of providing more aid. He is also close with Donald Trump Jr. Vance, a former venture capitalist, veteran and author, is among the candidates who received vice-presidential vetting materials from the Trump campaign. When asked by CNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins if he has any pause to be Trump\u2019s running mate given Trump\u2019s treatment of his former vice president, Vance said he is \u201cextremely skeptical that Mike Pence\u2019s life was ever in danger\u201d on January 6, 2021, the day of the riot at the US Capitol. Tim Scott Trump has said Tim Scott is \u201ca guy I look at\u201d when asked on a radio show earlier this year if the South Carolina senator was a front-runner to be his potential running mate. While Scott challenged Trump for the Republican nomination this election cycle, he ran a campaign that avoided being overly critical of the former president and often expressed support for policies enacted during the Trump administration, positioning himself to be considered as a running mate. Since he suspended his campaign in November, he has aligned himself closely with Trump, and he is among the candidates who were sent various levels of paperwork in the vice-presidential vetting process. Scott was appointed to the Senate in 2013 by then-South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley. He retained the seat in a 2014 special election, was reelected to a full term in 2016 and won a second full term in 2022. He has one of the most conservative voting records in Congress and rarely broke with Trump during the latter\u2019s presidency. Elise Stefanik House GOP Conference Chair Elise Stefanik was once a Trump skeptic during the 2016 campaign and in the early days of his presidency. She has since emerged as one of the former president\u2019s most ardent supporters in Congress. Stefanik delivered a strong defense of Trump during his 2019 impeachment trial, which positioned her as a \u201cRepublican star,\u201d\u00a0as the then-president said at the time. She then objected to Biden\u2019s 2020 win in the House and promoted election lies. Trump has at various times asked donors and allies what they think about Stefanik as a potential vice president, though her perceived\u00a0zeal for the job turned off some of the former president\u2019s advisers, one person close to Trump previously told CNN. Stefanik\u00a0\u2014 who was among the candidates who were sent various levels of paperwork in the vice-presidential vetting process \u2014\u00a0has publicly expressed interest in becoming Trump\u2019s running mate or for a Cabinet position if he wins. The congresswoman, who was first elected in 2014, told CNN earlier this year that she\u2019s \u201cproud to be a top surrogate\u201d and \u201cwould proudly serve in a future Trump administration.\u201d Ben Carson Former Housing and Urban Development secretary Ben Carson challenged Trump for the Republican nomination in 2016. And while Carson \u2014 who didn\u2019t win a single primary contest \u2014 didn\u2019t immediately endorse Trump, he did offer a strong defense of the man who would eventually become president. \u201cPeople who think Donald Trump would be the worst thing that ever happened \u2026 you make a really big mistake by trying to thwart the will of the people,\u201d Carson, a retired neurosurgeon, said while suspending his campaign. Once Trump was elected, Carson turned down the then-president-elect\u2019s offer to be his health and human services secretary. But he eventually led the Department of Housing and Urban Development, despite criticism that he was not qualified to do so. Carson \u2014\u00a0who is among the candidates who received various levels of paperwork in the vice-presidential vetting process \u2014 disagrees with Trump\u2019s stance on one key issue: Abortion. In his new book, \u201cThe Perilous Fight,\u201d Carson argued in favor of a legislation that \u201cguarantees the right to life for all American citizens, including those still in the womb.\u201d Trump has said that he would not sign a federal abortion ban if he\u2019s back in office. Byron Donalds Florida Rep. Byron Donalds is a Trump loyalist and one of the former president\u2019s most trusted surrogates. He rose to prominence in Trump world last year when he\u00a0endorsed Trump\u00a0over Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in the Republican presidential primary, and he has received routine praise and public support from the former president. He was part of\u00a0a launch\u00a0of the\u00a0\u201cBlack\u00a0Americans for Trump\u201d group meant to target Black voters as the Trump campaign seeks to win over voters from the traditionally Democratic bloc. Donalds has been outspoken on related issues, including controversial\u00a0comments he made\u00a0earlier this month suggesting that Black families were\u00a0\u201ctogether\u201d\u00a0during the Jim Crow era of racial segregation. Donalds has been confident that if selected as Trump\u2019s vice president, he would be able to assume the role of commander in chief, if necessary, and said he will support Trump however he decides. \u201cI think that I have the ability to step in,\u201d Donalds said in June on NBC\u2019s\u00a0\u201cMeet\u00a0the Press.\u201d\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m\u00a0actually pretty intelligent.\u201d Nikki Haley Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley was the last Trump opponent to stay in the GOP presidential race and on the trail, she tried to distinguish herself from the former president as the better alternative to reel in moderate and independent voters in a general election against Biden. When asked if he would consider Haley as his running mate, Trump said earlier this month that he \u201cwas very disappointed in her because she stayed too long.\u201d Haley, who served as Trump\u2019s ambassador to the United Nations, said on the trail\u00a0that she feels \u201cno need to kiss the ring.\u201d Even after suspending her campaign, she didn\u2019t immediately endorse the former president and instead urged him to \u201cearn\u201d the support of voters who backed her. But she ultimately said last month that she\u2019d be voting for her former boss. Even after Haley suspended her campaign, tens of thousands of voters continued to vote for her in Republican primaries across the country. Her selection could help Trump win over GOP voters who are seeking an alternative to the former president. Still, Trump himself said on Truth Social that she is not under consideration. Haley was elected as governor of South Carolina in 2011, making history as\u00a0the first woman\u00a0and the first person of an ethnic minority to hold governorship in the state. In the Trump administration, she was initially considered for secretary of state before being offered the UN ambassadorship \u2014 a role she said she accepted on conditions that she be a Cabinet member, be on the National Security Council and have the ability to speak her mind. She resigned as ambassador in October 2018. Tom Cotton Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton spent months exploring a 2024 presidential run, but eventually decided after the 2022 midterms that he would not join the race. First elected to the US House in 2012 and then to the US Senate in 2014, the Afghanistan and Iraq War veteran has established himself as a conservative security hawk. He also put a long-standing hold on US attorney and US marshal nominations. Cotton announced earlier this year that he would run for Senate Republican conference chair, the third-ranking leadership position in GOP leadership. However, he told NBC earlier this month that \u201cany great patriot, if offered a chance to serve our country by the president, would have to consider it seriously.\u201d However, he said he has not talked to Trump or his campaign about the role \u201cor any position in his administration.\u201d Tulsi Gabbard Former Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard ran as a Democratic presidential candidate in 2020, but left the party to become an independent in 2022, alleging that her former party is \u201cunder the complete control of an elitist cabal of warmongers driven by cowardly wokeness.\u201d Gabbard, a veteran, was first elected to Congress in 2012, making history as the first American Samoan woman and first practicing\u00a0Hindu\u00a0member in Congress. She also served as the vice chair of the Democratic National Committee. She left Congress in 2021. As a congresswoman, she voted \u201cpresent\u201d on both articles of impeachment against Trump in 2019. And in recent months, she has ramped up her praise and defense of the former president, alleging at a Conservative Political Action Conference earlier this year that \u201cthe Democrat elite and cronies\u201d are \u201cusing our criminal system to prosecute\u201d Trump and \u201cundermine his support.\u201d Gabbard has publicly expressed interest in joining the ticket, telling an audience in response to a question at a book event, \u201cIf asked to serve in that way, I would be honored to do so,\u201d\u00a0according to the New York Times. In 2016, Gabbard was considered by Trump for jobs at the Defense Department, State Department and the United Nations, a source then told CNN.

{"id": "2024_06_20_us_donkey-elk-herd-california-cec", "text": "When Diesel the donkey ran away on a hike near his home outside Sacramento, California, five years ago, his owners assumed the worst. \u201cHe\u2019s not aggressive, he\u2019s a lover,\u201d Terrie Drewry told CNN affiliate KOVR in 2019, days after Diesel\u2019s great escape. \u201cBut right now, he\u2019s scared.\u201d Years passed without a sign of life from Diesel \u2014\u00a0until earlier this year, when a hunter spotted and filmed a herd of at least a dozen elk in the northern California wilderness. Among them, strangely, was a wild burro. Drewry is positive that the donkey in the hunter\u2019s video is her Diesel. \u201cFinally we saw him,\u201d Drewry told KOVR this month after the Instagram video began making headlines. \u201cFinally, we know he\u2019s good. He\u2019s living his best life. He\u2019s happy. He\u2019s healthy, and it was just a relief.\u201d The Drewry family adopted Diesel from the Bureau of Land Management, and he lived on their ranch in peace for the first few years of his life alongside chickens, a llama and a miniature donkey. But on a fateful hike in April 2019, Diesel noticed something that spooked him and took off running, dragging Drewry\u2019s husband Dave through the bushes behind him, she told KOVR at the time. For weeks they searched for Diesel in the Cache Creek Wilderness, a rugged area northwest of Sacramento made up of nearly 30,000 acres. They thought they spotted him on a trail camera and once found some tracks that may have matched his hooves, but they never found him. Enter Max Fennell, a professional triathlete who occasionally hunts in wild California with a bow and arrow. On a hunting trip in March, Fennell stumbled upon the elk herd \u2014 and was stunned to see a donkey among them. In a video shot by Fennell, which Drewry said was taken mere miles from where Diesel bolted in 2019, the herd is seen moving in unison. When Fennell spots them, they stop to stare at him. The animals don\u2019t move again until the donkey apparently gives the all-clear: After sizing up a disbelieving Fennell, the burro turns its head and trots off. The elk quickly follow. \u201cProbably one of my wildest hunting trips to date,\u201d Fennell wrote in the caption of the video on Instagram. \u201cI can\u2019t get over seeing it and I\u2019m amazed that the donkey looks happy and healthy!\u201d In addition to clearing land, pulling wagons and providing general cuteness, donkeys can protect livestock on farms. The pack animals fiercely defend their flocks by braying, kicking wildly and charging, teeth bared, at potential predators. Drewry suspects that, if the donkey Fennell spotted is indeed Diesel, he\u2019s merely doing his donkey duty and protecting his deer friends. \u201cThey learned to get along and be each other\u2019s family,\u201d she told KOVR. A video shared in September last year also purported to show Diesel with his elk kin. The donkey in that clip looked utterly content, trotting through tall yellow grass in the dappled sunlight. Though she misses him, Drewry said she won\u2019t try to catch Diesel and bring him back. As grazing animals, donkeys in the wild can usually find plenty to eat. And the donkey in Fennell\u2019s video appears to be thriving in the wilderness, with friends by his side. \u201cHe\u2019s truly a wild burro now,\u201d she said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/20/us/donkey-elk-herd-california-cec/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/22/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_21_us_rust-baldwin-motion-dismiss-denied-friday", "text": "A New Mexico judge denied a motion Friday from Alec Baldwin\u2019s attorneys asking the court to dismiss the actor\u2019s involuntary manslaughter indictment in a shooting on the set of the film \u201cRust,\u201d in which cinematographer\u00a0Halyna Hutchins died. A separate motion to dismiss from Baldwin\u2019s team will be considered at a hearing on June 24. The case is slated to go to trial in July in Santa Fe. In the first motion to dismiss, an attorney for Baldwin, John Bash, argued the shooting death of Hutchins on set in October 2021 was an accident and Baldwin is \u201cnot criminally liable.\u201d Prosecutor Kari Morrissey countered Baldwin is experienced in the movie business. \u201cMr. Baldwin knew he had a real gun in his hand. Mr. Baldwin specifically asked for the biggest gun that was available. Mr. Baldwin knew and understood that dummy rounds look identical to live ammunition,\u201d Morrissey said. Furthermore, she argued, Baldwin was aware armorer Hannah Gutierrez Reed \u201cwasn\u2019t following the rules\u201d when she was doing gun safety checks on the set of \u201cRust.\u201d Gutierrez Reed was convicted in March of involuntary manslaughter and sentenced to 18 months in prison. She is appealing the conviction. In the second motion to dismiss the case, Baldwin\u2019s team argued the gun used in the shooting was destroyed during forensic testing by the FBI, making it impossible for the defense to attempt to recreate the testing. The judge is set to rule on the motion following a hearing scheduled for next Monday. Judge Mary Marlowe Sommer also denied a motion from the prosecution to provide \u201cuse immunity\u201d for Guiterrez Reed. Use immunity protects a witness from the use of their own testimony against them. Trial set for July Special prosecutors have signaled they intend to portray Baldwin as repeatedly flouting safety protocols on the movie set in the days before the fatal shooting, according to\u00a0a new court filing. In a notice to Baldwin\u2019s attorneys on evidence they intend to present in court next month, prosecutors outlined repeated instances in which Baldwin allegedly acted dangerously between October 12 and October 21, 2021, and a key focus will be the defendant\u2019s \u201creckless behavior.\u201d Prosecutors in the filing argue the evidence \u201cis relevant because it is part of the crime of involuntary manslaughter as it shows defendant\u2019s recklessness or criminal negligence on October 21, 2021, when he shot and killed Halyna Hutchins.\u201d Baldwin has pleaded not guilty to a felony charge of involuntary manslaughter in connection to Hutchins\u2019 death. Luke Nikas, an attorney for Baldwin, had no comment Wednesday about the prosecution document, but referred CNN to the defense\u2019s most recent filing asking the court again to dismiss the indictment and accusing the prosecution of selected disclosure of evidence. In\u00a0a statement\u00a0to CNN\u00a0last month\u00a0following a judge\u2019s refusal to dismiss the charge, Baldwin\u2019s legal team said, \u201cWe look forward to our day in court.\u201d Prosecutors cited video evidence from the set obtained during the state\u2019s criminal investigation, laying out examples of Baldwin\u2019s alleged mishandling of the replica revolver he used\u00a0during\u00a0the movie\u2019s production, according to the court document filed Monday and obtained by CNN. Baldwin, prosecutors alleged, \u201cused his gun as a pointer directing crew members,\u201d \u201cdischarged the revolver after the filming was over and \u2018cut\u2019 was called,\u201d \u201cengaged in horseplay with the revolver\u00a0while making videos,\u201d pointed the gun and fired a blank round at a crew member \u201cwhile using that crew member as a line of site as his perceived target\u201d and \u201cshot several scenes wherein he placed his finger on the trigger of the revolver where the scene did not require any shooting of the firearm.\u201d Baldwin\u00a0previously told CNN\u00a0he did not pull the trigger on the weapon during the deadly incident. \u201cI never took a gun and pointed\u00a0at somebody and clicked the thing,\u201d Baldwin said at the time. The special prosecution team also alleged Baldwin was \u201cinattentive during\u00a0the\u00a0firearms training\u201d conducted by on-set armorer Gutierrez Reed, claiming the actor was texting and video conferencing with family members rather than focusing on the safety briefing. In addition to holding the gun when it fired the fatal round, Santa Fe\u00a0County\u2019s\u00a0district attorney\u00a0previously told\u00a0CNN Baldwin\u2019s\u00a0role as a producer for the film also opens him up to potential liability for the alleged culture\u00a0of unsafe practices on the\u00a0\u201cRust\u201d set. In the filing, special prosecutors repeatedly insisted Baldwin exercised\u00a0complete control over the set and crew\u00a0during instances where alleged unsafe practices were identified on video. Hutchins\u00a0was killed and director Joel Souza injured when a gun held by Baldwin fired a live round during a scene rehearsal on the set of the western.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/21/us/rust-baldwin-motion-dismiss-denied-friday/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/22/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_18_us_usa-swimming-coach-abuse-lawsuit", "text": "A former high-level swimmer accused her Hall of Fame coach of sexually abusing her about 15 years ago when she was a minor  and alleged USA Swimming and other organizations and individuals knew about the abuse and did nothing to stop it, according to a federal lawsuit. The suit from Amanda Le was filed against\u00a0\u201cthe individuals and corporate entities who let a known child rapist work as a youth swim coach, who supported him with infrastructure, position, and prestige for decades, and who allowed him full access to a never-ending cycle of young girls to prey upon,\u201d the suit states. \u201cAmanda Le was one of those girls.\u201d Filed in US District Court in Massachusetts on Friday, the 33-page lawsuit alleges sexual abuse on the part of Joseph Bernal, the former Fordham and Harvard swim coach who served on the US coaching staff at the 1984 and 1988 Olympics. He coached multiple Olympic medalists and world record holders and was inducted into the American Swim Coaches Hall of Fame in 2015, the lawsuit states. He also founded the Bernal\u2019s Gator Swim Club, an amateur swim club, and coached Le from 2006 to 2010. Bernal sexually abused Le from about 2008 to 2014, the lawsuit states. In February 2016, USA Swimming permanently banned Bernal for his abuse of an unnamed \u201cAthlete A,\u201d the lawsuit states. That athlete was Le, the suit states. Bernal is named on a USA Swimming website listing individuals permanently suspended or ineligible for membership, due to \u201csexual misconduct.\u201d \u201cUSA Swimming is deeply committed to the safety and welfare of all its members,\u201d the organization\u2019s then-spokesman Scott Leightman said in 2016 in a statement to The Boston Globe. \u201cThe Safe Sport program\u2019s mission is to increase awareness to reduce the risk for abuse in sport and our organization has no tolerance for violations of our code of conduct.\u2019\u2019 CNN reached out to USA Swimming for comment on the lawsuit. CNN has also reached out to an attorney for Bernal\u2019s estate and other defendants named in the lawsuits for comment. Bernal died in October 2022, according to an obituary. The lawsuit comes amid a series of allegations of abuse and wrongdoing in the national governing bodies that oversee elite-level youth sports like USA Swimming. In 2021, for example, USA Gymnastics, the US Olympic and Paralympic Committee and their insurers agreed to pay $380 million in a settlement with the victims of Larry Nassar, the former Olympic doctor who sexually abused girls for decades. Jon Little, Le\u2019s attorney, told CNN there is a culture that allows this abuse to happen. \u201cWhile what happened to her is sad, it\u2019s far from uncommon,\u201d Little said. \u201cPeople like Larry Nassar and Bernal, that produce Olympic medalists \u2013 as long as these guys produce medals and money, they can literally rape children. The system is designed to protect the producers. Getting rid of Nassar and Bernal does not change the problem.\u201d The attorney said Le filed the lawsuit to let kids know they are not alone. \u201cShe felt alone back then, but she doesn\u2019t now,\u201d Little said. What the lawsuit alleges According to the lawsuit, Le trained and competed with Bernal\u2019s Gator Swim Club of New England, known as BGSC-NE, from 13 to 18 years old. When she was 15 and Bernal was in his mid-60s, he kissed her after practice, and the sexual contact escalated over the next few years, the lawsuit states. \u201cWhile she was in high school, Amanda started to have panic attacks, which she believed at the time were due solely to the stress of swimming; she knew that (she) was afraid of performing poorly because she would be punished,\u201d the suit states. \u201cAmanda was also suffering the consequences of the sexual abuse, although she did not realize it at the time.\u201d On several overnight team trips, Le slept in Bernal\u2019s hotel room, the lawsuit states. From her junior year of high school into her senior year, she would skip school and the coach would pick her up and take her to his house for sex, according to the lawsuit. Le went to college from 2011 to 2014, and as a junior, Bernal impregnated Le and then paid for an abortion, the lawsuit states. The abuse continued even though some adults knew about it, according to the lawsuit. In one instance, Le\u2019s mother found her diary, which detailed her relationship with Bernal, and Le\u2019s parents then showed it to another coach for Bernal\u2019s Gator Swim Club, the lawsuit states. That coach did not contact law enforcement and \u201cdid nothing to protect Amanda,\u201d the suit states. In addition, USA Swimming \u201cwas aware of complaints about Bernal\u2019s inappropriate behavior with minor female swimmers\u201d before Le began the sport, the suit alleges. The suit accuses Bernal, USA Swimming and other defendants of violating the Trafficking Victims Protection Act. Further, the lawsuit accuses Bernal of sexual abuse and the others of negligence. Bernal was previously named in an August 2021 lawsuit in which Kimberly Stines accused him of a \u201cfive-year campaign of systemic emotional and sexual abuse\u201d beginning in 1976. USA Swimming is not a defendant in the lawsuit. Little, who also represents Stines, said the litigation is ongoing and a trial is expected sometime in late 2025 or early 2026. He said the system failed to protect Stines. \u201cThe system failed her and now she feels guilty that there is an Amanda Le,\u201d he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/18/us/usa-swimming-coach-abuse-lawsuit/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/22/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_21_us_california-alameda-county-jury-notes", "text": "Lance Clark was 9 years old when he was shot dead in a robbery. A man named Ernest Dykes was convicted of the 1993 Oakland murder and sentenced to death. But the boy\u2019s family says prosecutors just told them\u00a0Dykes\u202fcould\u202fbe released from prison in nine months to a year. \u201cLance was a happy, funny, loving, sweet little boy,\u201d his sisters told CNN in a family statement. \u201cHe was robbed of a future.\u201d Dykes might be released because, while preparing for his appeal, an Alameda County deputy district attorney found in the dusty case files some handwritten notes about potential jurors from the trial back in the 1990s. One potential juror in the Dykes case file is described as a \u201cShort, fat troll.\u201d Like other Black potential jurors \u2013 and only Black potential jurors \u2013 her race is noted. The letters \u201cFB\u201d are written next to her name, apparently noting her gender and race. \u201cMust go,\u201d is written next to the name of a Black man, who is described as \u201cMB.\u201d Another juror has the word \u201cJewish\u201d underlined on their questionnaire. Farther down, a handwritten note reads: \u201cI liked him better than any other Jew. But no way.\u201d There were no Black or Jewish jurors seated at the trial. \u201cWhen you have serious prosecutorial misconduct, that means that the conviction is a wrongful conviction,\u201d said current Alameda County District Attorney Pamela Price. \u201cAnd so, it\u2019s a question of whether or not we\u2019re able to negotiate a resolution, or whether we have to go back to trial.\u201d Brian Pomerantz, current counsel for Dykes, could only speculate about what prejudices prosecutors could have had about certain groups. \u201cBlack people don\u2019t like police. So, they\u2019re more defense-oriented,\u201d he said when asked why prosecutors might have tried to keep Black people off juries in death penalty cases. \u201cObviously, I think that\u2019s a generalization that shouldn\u2019t be made,\u201d he added. \u201cI\u2019ve heard a couple of different things,\u201d said Pomerantz when asked why prosecutors might not have wanted Jewish jurors seated. \u201cThere\u2019s a thought that perhaps Jewish jurors would not want to send someone to a gas chamber,\u201d he said, recalling the genocide of Jews in the Holocaust. \u201cThe other was, they just thought Jewish jurors were more liberal.\u201d \u2018Pattern of serious misconduct\u2019 Federal Judge\u202fVince Chhabria, who was alerted to the prosecutors\u2019 notes after being assigned the appeal by Dykes last year, believes they are evidence of a much wider issue. \u201cIn prior decades, prosecutors from this office were engaged in a pattern of serious misconduct \u2013 automatically excluding Jewish and African American jurors from death penalty cases,\u201d he wrote in a court order. He has ordered the DA\u2019s office to review 35 cases dating from the mid-1980s through 2007. Among those cases are convicted mass shooters, serial killers, rapists and murderers. Pomerantz has begun looking through those files as he works on his cases for Dykes and other clients. \u201cIn almost all the cases we\u2019ve seen lists like this,\u201d he said, pointing to the letters \u2018MB\u2019 and \u2018FB\u2019 next to the names of potential jurors in a number of different cases, involving defendants of different races. A misspelled homophobic slur is used to describe another person in the jury pool. Pomerantz showed documents he says prove that jurors were being racially profiled and struck as late as 2008. Prosecutors, by\u202flaw,\u202fcannot exclude jurors because of race, ethnicity, gender or sexuality. District Attorney Price, who took office last year, would not comment on the claim of Dykes\u2019 impending release. Earlier, she told CNN: \u201cMr. Dykes has spent 31 years behind bars and so he has paid a price for that crime.\u201d Pomerantz believes that some of those sentenced to death might now be freed. \u201cFor some, that may be the solution,\u201d he said. \u201dAnd for some that should be the solution.\u201d Like Mark Schmeck, a client who Pomerantz believes is innocent but was sentenced to death for the killing of Lorin Germaine during an armed robbery in the mid-1980s. \u201cHe was a fun dad,\u201d Germaine\u2019s daughter, who asked to remain anonymous for her safety, told CNN. \u201cHe would always take us fishing and camping\u2026 mom worked swing shift, so he was the guy home at night\u2026 he, he even was the tooth fairy. I caught him. Once.\u201d Schmeck claims he is innocent in Germaine\u2019s death and Pomerantz is petitioning for his release, claiming he did not get a fair trial.\u202fAnd that terrifies Germaine\u2019s daughter. \u201cI don\u2019t know why,\u201d she said. \u201cJust that somebody out there like hurt my dad and then he\u2019s gonna be out there and who\u2019s to say he\u2019s not gonna hurt me.\u201d \u2018There had to be knowledge\u2019 Price and Pomerantz believe there has been a decades-long cover-up of jury tampering within the Alameda County DA\u2019s office. \u201cThere does not appear to have been any accountability, or certainly no investigation to determine how widespread the practice was.\u201d Price said. \u201cThere had to be knowledge.\u201d In 2003, during an appeal of a death penalty conviction, John Quatman, a former deputy DA, testified that a judge \u201csaid I could not have a Jew on the jury.\u201d He went on, \u201cIt was standard practice to exclude Jewish jurors in death cases: as it was to exclude African-American women from capital juries.\u201d \u201cIt is ironic they didn\u2019t want me on the jury,\u201d said Price, who is Black. \u201cAnd now I\u2019m the district attorney.\u201d A number of prosecutors who worked in the office testified in 2003 that Quatman\u2019s claims were untrue, and some have told CNN that potential jurors were never racially profiled. According to Price, one of the prosecuting attorneys involved in jury selection on the Dykes case was Morris Jacobson, who now serves as a judge in Alameda County. Asked if it is Jacobson\u2019s handwriting on those jury notes Price said, \u201cWe don\u2019t know that for sure.\u201d It is also not known if it was definitely a prosecutor who wrote the notes. Judge Jacobson declined CNN\u2019s request for an interview. A CNN crew waited outside his courthouse in Berkeley one day hoping to ask him some questions. Jacobson, a source said, knew they were outside but did not come out for at least two hours after his hearings had ended for the day. Colton Carmine was the chief prosecutor on the Dykes case. He is now retired and could not be reached for comment. A problem in America, not just Alameda \u201cThis is one of the most liberal counties in America. This is where Berkeley is. If this is happening there, what\u2019s happening everywhere else?\u201d said Pomerantz. Studies have found patterns of racial bias in jury selection from California and Washington to Connecticut and New York as well as the Deep South. One of the Alameda County cases that Pomerantz has reviewed is that of Franklin Lynch, known as \u201cThe Day Stalker.\u201d He was convicted of killing three elderly women in 1987 and sentenced to death. \u201cYou see the B circled,\u201d said Pomerantz pointing to notes on potential jurors at Lynch\u2019s trial. He also pointed to \u20181/2 B\u2019 written twice on one person\u2019s form. \u201cThey were so concerned about that person even being half Black,\u201d he said, \u201cthat they flagged it not once\u2026 but twice.\u201d \u201cThis is a tragedy on all levels,\u201d Pomerantz said. \u201cThere are victims, families who are suffering because now these cases 30 years later are, are coming back through this situation. That\u2019s incredibly unfair. It is wrong that these prosecutors did this this way and that now people are going to suffer for it\u2026 It\u2019s also wrong when Franklin Lynch doesn\u2019t get a fair trial.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/21/us/california-alameda-county-jury-notes/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/22/2024", "section": "us"}}

The boy, who is Black and referred to by the initials \u201cM.W.\u201d in the lawsuit, attended Glover Elementary School in Marblehead, Massachusetts, as a third-grader from September 2023 to March 2024 as a part of the commonwealth\u2019s voluntary school integration program called the Metropolitan Council for Educational Opportunity (METCO). CNN has agreed not to name the boy or his mother over the family\u2019s concerns about the emotional health and wellbeing of her son.  Nearly 83% of students at Glover Elementary School were White and less than 2% percent were Black during the 2023-2024 school year, according to the commonwealth\u2019s Department of Elementary and Secondary Education. While enrolled in the school, employees allegedly restrained the child multiple times and, on those occasions, according to the lawsuit, they \u201cforcibly grasped his wrists,\u201d \u201cdragged (him) down school hallways,\u201d and, on at least one occasion, \u201cencircled (M.W.) \u2026 with a large gym mat so that he was forcibly trapped\u201d and pushed to \u201ctransport\u201d him, leaving him \u201cisolated \u2026 in empty rooms.\u201d \u201cThese employees\u2019 actions terrified M.W. and caused him to suffer from severe asthma attacks and vomiting,\u201d the lawsuit states. According to the lawsuit, M.W. was restrained \u201cin three separate incidents\u201d on December 6, 2023 \u2013 including after an incident that \u201coccurred because M.W. had a baseball bat and was allegedly swinging it at some of the Defendant staff \u2014 a characterization that is not corroborated by video evidence.\u201d  Later that day, M.W. \u201cneeded emergency transport to the hospital via ambulance because his asthma attack could not be controlled,\u201d according to the lawsuit. A school employee allegedly witnessed this incident and filed an anonymous complaint with the Massachusetts Department of Children and Families (DCF), a child welfare agency, the lawsuit states. Erika Richmond Walton, the family\u2019s attorney, told CNN the child\u2019s mother withdrew him from the school in March of this year. \u201cI want there to be accountability from the district regarding what happened to my clients and the trauma that they are still experiencing,\u201d Richmond Walton said. \u201cWe want there to be a change in the way that this district and other districts in Massachusetts treat Black and Latinx children. We also want there to be some reform regarding Massachusetts restraint laws,\u201d she said. The commonwealth\u2019s Department of Elementary and Secondary Education has guidelines that state the use of restraint \u201cshall be limited to the use of such reasonable force as is necessary to protect a student or another member of the school community from assault or imminent, serious, physical harm.\u201d The lawsuit notes that\u00a0the regulations prohibit\u00a0physical restraint from being used when a student cannot be safely restrained due to medical reasons, including asthma. Four Glover Elementary school employees were placed on paid administrative leave in December while the district reviewed its policies on student restraint, according to CNN affiliate WCVB, citing Marblehead Public School\u2019s interim superintendent Theresa McGuinness. At the time, McGuinness said the employees\u2019 leave\u00a0\u201cis not a punitive action, but it is necessary during this process,\u201d according to WCVB. CNN has reached out to the school district to confirm if the employees placed on administrative leave were those involved in the incidents mentioned in the lawsuit. CNN has not been able to confirm the current status of the four employees. The lawsuit seeks damages from the Town of Marblehead, the school district and individual employees in an amount to be determined at trial and to have the child\u2019s student record cleared. \u2018Our Way Forward\u2019 In response to a question from CNN about incidents spanning September to December, McGuinness shared a statement this month, saying that when district leadership learned about the allegations, they \u201ccommissioned an outside investigation into the matter, and took appropriate action.\u201d \u201cThe Marblehead Public Schools was transparent during the difficult process and will continue to be,\u201d McGuinness said in the statement. \u201cFurthermore, immediately upon learning of the matter in question, the district filed a 51A child abuse/neglect report with \u2026\u00a0(DCF), in keeping with its role as a mandated reporter,\u201d the statement said. In response to a question from CNN, DCF confirmed it received a report and investigated. Richmond Walton shared a copy of DCF findings sent to the mother with CNN. It concludes that five allegations of neglect of her son were \u201csupported.\u201d Three out of the five caregivers who are identified in the DCF report are named as plaintiffs in the lawsuit. The school district also hired a third-party consulting firm to investigate a November incident where staff were allegedly \u201cusing a large, padded mat to trap M.W. and control his movements,\u201d according to the lawsuit. During the incident, the student began to \u201cexperience symptoms of active asthma\u201d and vomited and, according to the lawsuit, \u201conly then did a Glover Elementary School employee give M.W. his inhaler.\u201d The independent investigators issued a redacted report in March that aligns with the lawsuit\u2019s description of what happened during the Nov. 20 incident, including that employees \u201ctransported\u201d a student in a padded mat.  Richmond Walton confirmed to CNN that M.W. was the student referenced in the consulting firm\u2019s report. The report concluded, \u201cthe staff involved in this incident \u2026 had an extraordinarily difficult task. Some of the techniques that were utilized were not aligned with the proper procedures outlined in Safety-Care training.\u201d The report also said that, while school staff had \u201cevery right to use restraints\u201d to prevent potential harm, the \u201cviolation of procedure was their selected method of restraint.\u201d \u201cThe improvisation of encircling (M.W.) with a mat was an undue hardship on (M.W.)\u00a0and was unnecessary for creating a safe environment. Furthermore, the chosen restraint was not effective,\u201d the report said, adding that \u201cin the heat of the moment, (M.W.) was improperly transported.\u201d Investigators also concluded that using the mat in this incident \u2026 was a violation of the commonwealth\u2019s regulation prohibiting use of \u201cmechanical restraint\u2026and seclusion.\u201d In March, the district unveiled a new plan outlining how it would address restraints on students in the future, called \u201cRestraint Response Plans \u2026 Our Way Forward.\u201d The plan includes, among other things, requiring all staff to participate in a training on restraint prevention and behavioral support policy, and requiring staff debrief after \u201cany significant escalation\u201d to \u201cprevent and minimize future incidents.\u201d Richmond Walton said M.W. has since enrolled in another school, but he\u2019s still dealing with trauma because of the incidents. In a statement shared with CNN through her lawyer, the now 9-year-old\u2019s mother said her son has had a difficult time adjusting to his new school. \u201cThe teachers say he is showing signs of trauma,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to see that my baby is not the same. I cry every day.\u201d According to a report from the US Department of Education\u2019s Office for Civil Rights, \u201capproximately 52,800 K-12 students were physically restrained, mechanically restrained, and/or placed in seclusion at schools,\u201d during the 2020-2021 school year. While Black students made up 15% of K-12 public school enrollment during the same year, the report found they accounted for 21% of students physically restrained, 42% of the students restrained using a device or equipment, and 19% of students secluded. Boys, Black students, students of two or more races and students with disabilities were also more likely to be restrained, the report said. Richmond Walton told CNN the child\u2019s mother believes her son\u2019s race played a role in the repeated use of restraints. \u201cShe\u2019s almost 100% sure that this would not be happening if he was a White child,\u201d she said. However, Richmond Walton said METCO should not take the blame, and she feels the school district is responsible. \u201cDistricts that participate in the METCO program are obligated to be welcoming and respectful of the children of color that attend these schools,\u201d she said. According to the commonwealth\u2019s department of education, the METCO program \u201cis a voluntary program intended to expand educational opportunities, increase diversity, and reduce racial isolation for students in urban and suburban communities.\u201d It allows children from Boston and Springfield to attend schools in other districts with greater resources. METCO currently serves approximately 3,200 students across 38 school districts in metropolitan Boston and outside Springfield. METCO President and CEO Milly Arbaje-Thomas said in a statement that the program remains committed to \u201cempowering our\u202fMETCO\u202fdistricts with the tools and resources they need to recognize, respond to, and repair racial harm in their communities.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/21/us/massachusetts-family-school-restraint-lawsuit-reaj/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/22/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_21_business_teamsters-president-speaking-republican-convention-trump", "text": "Teamsters President Sean O\u2019Brien will speak to the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee in July, a sign that former President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign is hoping to peel off the support of union members from President Joe Biden. But unlike other speakers at the RNC, O\u2019Brien\u2019s appearance does not represent an endorsement of Trump, according to Teamsters union spokesperson Kara Deniz. O\u2019Brien has requested the opportunity to also speak at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in August. The DNC has yet to accept that request, Deniz said. Trump posted the announcement Friday afternoon on his Truth Social platform. \u201cOur GREAT convention will unify Americans and demonstrate to the nation\u2019s working families they come first,\u201d Trump wrote. \u201cWhen I am back in the White House, the hardworking Teamsters, and all working Americans, will once again have a country they can afford to live in and be respected around the world. Sean, I look forward to seeing you represent the Teamsters in Milwaukee. Together we can Make America Great Again.\u201d Deniz said in an email that the union was happy Trump extended the invitation. \u201cThis is truly unprecedented since it will be the very first time a Teamsters General President has addressed the RNC,\u201d she said in an email. \u201cOur 1.3 million members\u00a0represent every political background, and their message needs to be heard by as wide an audience as possible, and that includes all political candidates running for elected office. We appreciate former President Trump\u2019s openness to inviting a labor leader to speak on behalf of working families.\u201d \u201cWe sincerely hope the DNC will also respond to our request with an invitation,\u201d she said. Trump and O\u2019Brien met at the former president\u2019s Mar-a-Lago resort in early January. Trump then met with the union\u2019s leadership on January 31. Some other union leaders objected to the meetings, with John Palmer \u2014 the group\u2019s international vice president at-large \u2014 writing a letter at that time denouncing Trump as \u201ca known union buster, scab, and insurrectionist.\u201d \u201cWe should never entertain dialogue with a candidate with such an anti-union record,\u201d he wrote. Biden has a very pro-union record. He became the first sitting president to appear on the picket line to support strikers during the United Auto Workers union\u2019s strike against the nation\u2019s three unionized automakers. He has regularly voiced support for unions and has appointed a very pro-union leadership to the National Labor Relations Board, which has been much friendlier to union positions during his administration. He also met with the Teamsters leadership in March. But so far, the Teamsters have endorsed neither candidate, unlike the AFL-CIO and many powerful unions, such as the UAW and the National Education Association. And the union\u2019s political arm gave similar size donations of hundreds of thousands of dollars to committees of both the Democratic and Republican parties earlier this year. O\u2019Brien has had his own harsh criticism of some other Republicans, if not Trump. At a Senate hearing in November, he and Sen. Markwayne Mullin, a Republican from Oklahoma, both said they were prepared to engage in a fist fight in the middle of a hearing until Sen. Bernie Sanders, the committee chair, ordered them to stop. The DNC said it has yet to settle on its set of speakers for its convention in August. \u201cWe are building a convention in Chicago that will tell our story to the American people, including the stories of labor and union leaders and workers that President Biden has been delivering\u00a0for as the most pro-union president in modern history,\u201d said DNC spokesperson Matt Hill. \u2013 CNN\u2019s Gregory Krieg and Kristen Holmes contributed to this report", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/21/business/teamsters-president-speaking-republican-convention-trump/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/22/2024", "section": "us"}}

{"id": "2024_06_21_politics_judge-dismisses-charges-nevada-fake-electors", "text": "A Nevada judge dismissed an indictment Friday against six Republicans\u00a0accused of submitting certificates\u00a0to Congress falsely declaring Donald Trump the winner of the state\u2019s 2020 presidential election, potentially cutting from four to three the number of states with criminal charges pending against so-called fake electors. Nevada Attorney General Aaron Ford said he\u2019ll take the issue to the state Supreme Court after Clark County District Court Judge Mary Kay Holthus ruled that Las Vegas was the wrong venue for the case. \u201cThe judge got it wrong, and we\u2019ll be appealing immediately,\u201d Ford, a Democrat, told reporters afterward. He declined additional comment. Defense attorneys bluntly declared the case dead, saying that to bring it now before another grand jury in another venue such as Nevada\u2019s capital of Carson City would violate a three-year statute of limitations on filing charges that expired in December. \u201cThey\u2019re done,\u201d said Margaret McLetchie, attorney for Clark County Republican Party chairman Jesse Law, one of the defendants in the case. The judge called off the trial, which had been\u00a0scheduled for January, for defendants that also included state GOP chairman Michael McDonald; national party committee member Jim DeGraffenreid; national and Douglas County committee member Shawn Meehan; Storey County clerk Jim Hindle; and Eileen Rice, a party member from the Lake Tahoe area. Each was accused of offering a false instrument for filing and uttering a forged instrument \u2013 felonies that carry penalties of up to four or five years in prison. Defense attorneys led by McDonald\u2019s lawyer, Richard Wright, contended that Ford improperly brought the case before a grand jury in Las Vegas \u2014 Nevada\u2019s largest and most Democratic-leaning city \u2014 instead of Carson City or Reno, northern Nevada cities in a more Republican region where the alleged crimes occurred. They also accused prosecutors of failing to present to the grand jury evidence that would have exonerated their clients, who they said had no intent to commit a crime. \u201cCrimes are tried and venue lies in the venue in which the offense was committed,\u201d Wright told the judge on Friday. \u201cSigning the document occurred in Carson City.\u201d Challenged by Holthus to respond, Deputy State Attorney General Matthew Rashbrook argued that \u201cno one county contains the entirety of these crimes.\u201d \u201cSociety is the victim of these crimes,\u201d the prosecutor said. \u201cVoters who would have been disenfranchised by these acts \u2026 would have been victims of these crimes.\u201d But the judge decided that even though McDonald and Law live in Las Vegas, \u201ceverything took place up north.\u201d After the court hearing, Hindle\u2019s attorney, Brian Hardy, declined to comment on calls from advocacy groups for his client to resign from his elected position as overseer of elections in northern Nevada\u2019s Storey County, a jurisdiction with a few more than 4,100 residents. Those calls included a news conference Friday outside the courthouse by leaders of three organizations. The state Republican Party issued a statement welcoming the court decision, pointing to Ford\u2019s vow to appeal and asking for contributions to continue the court fight. Meehan is the only defendant not to have been named by the state party as a Nevada delegate to the\u00a02024 Republican National Convention\u00a0next month in Milwaukee. His defense attorney, Sigal Chattah, said her client chose not to seek the position. Chattah ran as a Republican in 2022 for state attorney general and lost to Ford by just under 8% of the vote. Nevada is one of seven presidential battleground states where slates of fake electors falsely certified that Trump had won\u00a0in 2020, not Democrat Joe Biden. Others are Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, New Mexico, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Nevada\u2019s case, filed last December, focused on the actions of six defendants. Criminal cases in three other states focus on many more \u2014 16 in\u00a0Michigan, 19 in\u00a0Georgia\u00a0and 18 in\u00a0Arizona. Kenneth Chesebro, a lawyer who\u00a0pleaded guilty in Georgia\u00a0last October to helping orchestrate the Trump campaign fake elector scheme in 2020, cooperated with prosecutors in the\u00a0Nevada criminal investigation\u00a0and was not charged. In testimony before the grand jury that met in Las Vegas in November, Chesebro said he provided the state GOP with an \u201corganized step-by-step explanation of what they would have to do\u201d to sign and submit certificates falsely stating that Trump, not Biden, won in Nevada. He also called\u00a0Nevada \u201cextremely problematic\u201d\u00a0to the fake elector plot, compared with other states, because the meeting of electors was overseen by the secretary of state. Also, unlike other states, Nevada did not have a legal challenge pending in courts at the time. Trump\u00a0lost Nevada in 2020\u00a0by more than 30,000 votes to Biden, and the state\u2019s Democratic electors certified the results in the presence of Nevada Secretary of State Barbara Cegavske, a Republican. Her defense of the results as reliable and accurate led the state GOP to\u00a0censure her, but Cegavske later conducted an investigation that found no credible evidence of widespread voter fraud in the state.

{"id": "2024_06_21_business_cdk-global-car-dealership-outage", "text": "CDK Global is ubiquitous in the auto dealership world \u2013 its software is used at 15,000 dealers. Its products handle everything from records to scheduling. Now, thousands of dealerships across the United States and Canada are entering a third day in a near deadlock after two consecutive cyber incidents at CDK Global led to a shut down of its systems. There\u2019s never an opportune time for a systems outage, but it\u2019s now the official start of summer, a time when many Americans are shopping for a new car and dealerships enjoy a bump in sales. Here\u2019s what the CDK Global outage means for both car sellers and shoppers. What exactly happened? On Wednesday, CDK spokesperson Lisa Finney told CNN that the company was investigating a cyber incident. \u201cOut of an abundance of caution and concern for our customers, we have shut down most of our systems and are working diligently to get everything up and running as quickly as possible,\u201d Finney said in the statement. Later Wednesday, the company said most of its critical computer systems were back online. But Thursday morning, the company told dealerships another incident had happened. North Carolina-based Sonic Automotive said it was a \u201ccybersecurity incident.\u201d CNN has asked CDK to confirm. Are systems still shut down? CDK said it proactively shut down most of its systems after it experienced an additional cyber incident late in the evening on Wednesday, June 19. \u201cIn partnership with third party experts, we are assessing the impact and providing regular updates to our customers. We remain vigilant in our efforts to reinstate our services and get our dealers back to business as usual as quickly as possible,\u201d the company said in a statement Thursday. On Thursday afternoon, the company said it still had no new information. The company told dealers the systems could be down for several days, according to two sources briefed on the situation. What does CDK Global do? CDK Global provides data and technology to different automotive dealerships. Its systems are used by roughly 15,000 car dealerships across the United States and Canada. CDK operates different products that car dealers use to handle things like keeping records of negotiated deals to scheduling and communicating about service. Not every dealer uses CDK\u2019s products, and even those that do may not use them for everything, but the system shutdown has been a problem for many. To protect customer privacy, customers\u2019 details aren\u2019t written out on a piece of paper that\u2019s just sitting on a desk anymore. Instead, information about deals and customer appointments is\u00a0kept in a server that\u2019s now impossible for salespeople affected by the outage to access. Why is this a bad time for dealerships? The outage can eat into sales during the first official weekend of the summer. Summer is car-buying season. CDK said it themselves in a blog post on its site last week. Post Memorial Day, \u201cthis presents increased opportunities for vehicle sales, service and, of course, revenue. It also means that it\u2019s time to roll out your summer Sales and Service marketing campaigns.\u201d In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, Sonic Automotive said the outage resulted in disruptions to its dealer management system hosted by CDK, \u201cwhich supports critical dealership operations including those supporting sales, inventory and accounting functions and its customer relationship management system.\u201d The company said that while the outage has affected its business operations, it hasn\u2019t determined the financial impact. Can I still buy a car? Jeff Ramsey, an executive with Ourisman Auto Group, which is headquartered in Maryland, told CNN the shutdown is a major hassle and could cost his dealerships some business. Customers who are delayed in closing a sale at one of his dealerships could just find a dealer nearby that\u2019s not having these issues and buy a new vehicle there, instead. However, some affected dealerships are still selling cars. \u201cMy selling team can hand-write a buyer\u2019s order,\u201d said Brian Benstock, general manager of Paragon Honda and Paragon Acura in Long Island City, New York. But salespeople could lack access to customer agreements that had been previously negotiated, making it harder to close those sales, dealers CNN spoke with said. There\u2019s more than just the negotiated price of the car involved, since these agreements can involve rebates and incentives, some of which customers must show they\u2019re qualified for. What are automakers saying? Ramsey, whose company operates a number of dealerships, said automakers including Kia, Toyota and Stellantis, which makes Jeep and Dodge vehicles, have been very helpful with finding ways to serve customers even with all technology issues. Ford also said its dealerships involved in the CDK outage have alternate ways to take care of customers. \u201cAlthough there is an industry-wide system outage for some dealers who use CDK, Ford and Lincoln customers are able to receive sales and service support due to alternative processes available to our dealers. While a customer\u2019s local dealer remains the best place for information about their sales and service needs, they can always contact the Ford Customer Relationship Center at 1-800-392-3673,\u201d Ford said in a statement shared with CNN.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/21/business/cdk-global-car-dealership-outage/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/22/2024", "section": "us"}}

In 2021, the Baltimore-based company had agreed to pay $9 million to settle Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) charges that it misled investors about its revenue growth. The SEC in its\u00a0investigation\u00a0found that\u00a0Under\u00a0Armour\u00a0failed to disclose to investors that it employed a sales tactic to accelerate or \u201cpull forward\u201d a total of $408 million in existing orders in the second half of 2015. Mark Solomon, lead counsel for the shareholders and a partner at litigation firm Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd, called the proposed settlement an \u201cimportant win\u201d that\u00a0underscored the key role of pension funds in holding companies accountable. Under\u00a0Armour\u00a0said it intends to pay the settlement amount of $434 million through cash on hand as well as by drawing on its $1.1 billion revolving credit facility. The company added in a regulatory filing it had agreed to also continue to separate the roles of the chair and the chief executive officer for a period of at least three years. Under\u00a0Armour\u00a0said it has consistently denied the accusations and entered into this agreement in principle, which is not an admission or finding of fault or wrongdoing. The company expects its total accrual in legal proceeding contingencies related to the lawsuit to reach $434 million during the first quarter of fiscal year 2025, from $100 million at the end of fiscal 2024.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/21/business/under-armour-to-settle-lawsuit-over-sales-disclosures/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/22/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_21_politics_depape-verdict-guilty-state-charges", "text": "David\u00a0DePape, the man convicted in federal court for violently attacking House Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi\u2019s husband, Paul, has been convicted of five\u00a0charges in state court. A California jury found\u00a0DePape\u00a0guilty\u00a0of\u00a0first-degree burglary, false imprisonment, threatening a family member of a public official, aggravated kidnapping and preventing or dissuading a witness by force or threat. The verdict comes as DePape already faces a 30-year sentence from his conviction last year in connection with the October 2022 attack. In court Friday, DePape showed no visible reaction as the verdict was read, and his lawyer later said they intend to appeal the case. Before the trial, Judge Harry M. Dorfman dismissed three of the charges\u00a0DePape\u00a0was facing, including attempted murder, assault of an elder and assault with a deadly weapon, because DePape\u2019s\u00a0defense team argued that would amount to double jeopardy.\u00a0DePape\u00a0was convicted in federal court last November for assault on the immediate family member of a federal official and attempted kidnapping of a federal official in connection with the attack. Defense\u00a0attorney Adam Lipson said\u00a0DePape was\u00a0disappointed with the Friday\u00a0verdict,\u00a0which the jury deliberated for nearly 12 hours over three days. \u201cHe\u2019s lived a very isolated and lonely life when he kind of just got wrapped up in lot of conspiracy theory-type situations,\u201d Lipson said.\u00a0\u201cAnd, you know, he has some mental illness too, so he\u2019s just dealing with that right now.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s really unfortunate he was charged this way. It was sort of a textbook vindictive prosecution,\u201d Lipson said. CNN has reached out to the San Francisco district attorney\u2019s office for comment. Aaron Bennett, a spokesperson for Nancy Pelosi, said in a statement Friday that the family is \u201cgrateful for the kind thoughts and prayers they continue to receive,\u201d adding, \u201cSpeaker Pelosi and her family will refrain from further substantive comment until sentencing is complete.\u201d A sentencing hearing has not yet been scheduled. Federal prosecutors claimed last year that DePape broke into the Pelosis\u2019 home with \u201ca violent plan to kidnap Nancy Pelosi\u201d and \u201cto hold her hostage.\u201d While DePape\u2019s attorney at the time conceded that DePape had attacked Paul Pelosi, she argued that his motivation for the assault did not match the federal charges against him. DePape\u00a0testified in his own defense\u00a0at the trial, telling the jury that he had been looking for Nancy Pelosi and that her husband was not on his list of targets. He was \u201csurprised and confused,\u201d he said, when he found out the congresswoman was not home. \u201cI\u2019m telling him, \u2018I have other targets, but if you stop me, I\u2019ll go through you,\u2019\u201d DePape said, recounting a conversation with Paul Pelosi. \u201cI reacted. I hit him in the head,\u201d he continued, \u201cI reacted because my plan was basically ruined.\u201d The morning before the jury in the state case started deliberating, Gypsy Taub, DePape\u2019s ex-wife, was escorted out of the courtroom. She was ordered excluded from the courtroom and the second floor of the courthouse for the remainder of the trial after a judge said she attempted to tamper with members of the jury. According to the AP, on Tuesday, graffiti from a website Taub runs that promotes conspiracy theories was discovered in a women\u2019s bathroom near the courtroom.\u00a0CNN observed her outside the courtroom on Monday handing out pieces of paper with a\u00a0website address\u00a0that also promoted conspiracy theories. A San Francisco County Superior Court communications representative said they cannot comment on pending cases. This story has been updated with additional reporting.

{"id": "2024_06_21_politics_us-israel-hezbollah-assurances", "text": "Senior US officials reassured a delegation of top Israeli officials visiting Washington this week that if a full-out war were to break out on Israel\u2019s northern border between Israel and Hezbollah, the Biden administration is fully prepared to back its ally, according to a senior administration official. The in-person assurances came as an increase in cross-border attacks in recent weeks between Israel and the Iran-backed group Hezbollah have intensified concerns about the possible outbreak of another full-fledged conflict in the Middle East \u2013 and also as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has publicly accused the US of withholding weapons and ammunition from his country, touching off a tense back-and-forth between Israeli and US officials. Top Israeli officials including\u00a0Minister of Strategic Affairs\u00a0Ron Dermer and national security adviser Tzachi Hanegbi participated in a series of meetings with Biden administration officials like national security adviser Jake Sullivan, Secretary of State Antony Blinken and White House Middle East affairs coordinator Brett McGurk in Washington this week. They discussed a wide range of topics including the situation on Israel\u2019s northern border, Iran and the ceasefire and hostage negotiations, sources said. When discussing the issue of Hezbollah\u2019s provocations, US officials made clear this week that the Biden administration would offer Israel the security assistance it needs, the senior administration official said, though the US would not deploy American troops to the ground in such a scenario. Since Hamas\u2019 attack on Israel on October 7, Hezbollah\u2019s provocations against Israel have continued \u2013 and escalated in recent weeks. Biden administration has repeatedly stated that it does not wish to see yet another war break out on Israel\u2019s northern front, urging diplomatic de-escalation. This week, US envoy Amos Hochstein was dispatched to the region to try to help de-escalate the conflict. Still, with Hezbollah\u2019s attacks across the border into Israel continuing in the absence of a ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war, US officials are on heightened alert about the eruption of a full-blown conflict in the region. If Hezbollah were to significantly expand the scale of its attacks on Israel, resulting in the deaths of Israelis, US officials expect Israel to respond with full force. As CNN reported, US officials have serious concerns\u00a0that in the event of a full-blown war between Israel and\u00a0Hezbollah, the Iran-backed militant group could overwhelm Israel\u2019s air defenses\u00a0in the north \u2014 including the much-vaunted\u00a0Iron Dome\u00a0air defense system. That reality would make the US\u2019 full support of Israel all the more critical. In this week\u2019s meetings, US and Israeli officials discussed possible \u201coff-ramps\u201d to try to lower the temperature along the so-called Blue Line that separates Lebanon and Israel, the senior administration official said. Those talks touched on ways of returning Israelis and Lebanese people who have been displaced from the border back to their homes, they said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/21/politics/us-israel-hezbollah-assurances/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/22/2024", "section": "us"}}

The 10 people wounded include two police officers. The suspected shooter was also wounded and taken into custody. Police first received calls about an active shooter at the Mad Butcher grocery store at around 11:30 a.m. local time, Mike Hagar, the Secretary of Public Safety and Director of Arkansas State Police said at the news conference. Law enforcement responded immediately and exchanged gunfire with the \u201clone suspect.\u201d The injuries to the officers and the suspect are not considered life-threatening, according to Hagar. He noted the \u201csituation is secured \u2026contained. There are no active threats to the community.\u201d \u201cThe remaining civilian injuries range from non-life threatening to extremely critical,\u201d he said. At least 234 mass shootings have taken place in the United States in 2024, according to data from the Gun Violence Archive, which, like CNN, defines a mass shooting as one in which four or more people are shot, excluding the shooter. The country has seen a spate of shootings in the past few weeks as the summer heat has escalated, with 21 mass shootings recorded by the Gun Violence Archive since last Friday. In a statement on\u00a0X, Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders said she had been briefed on the \u201ctragic shooting\u201d in Fordyce and is in \u201cconstant contact\u201d with state police at the scene. One witness, David Rodriguez, told CNN that he was pulling into a gas station when he heard \u201cpops,\u201d which he thought were fireworks. Shortly after the suspect began firing bullets more rapidly, Rodriguez saw people running from the scene. He then heard sirens and saw ambulances and police arrive at the scene. Rodriguez says the Mad Butcher grocery store\u2019s front windows were broken as if they had been \u201cshot open\u201d by gunfire. Matthew Gill, the meat manager at the\u00a0Mad Butcher,\u00a0told CNN a man came into the store with a shotgun and ended up in a shootout with police. As the shooting unfolded, some people hid in a cooler in the grocery store, Fordyce City Council Member Roderick Rogers told CNN affiliate KATV. He said he was on the phone with someone in the store when the shooting took place. \u201cMan, it was bad,\u201d Rogers said. The council member said that he had talked to survivors of the shooting who \u201care traumatized.\u201d \u201cWe are trying to get some counseling and everything set up at the moment,\u201d he added. Fordyce, a small city in southeast Dallas County, had a population of just 3,396 in 2020.

{"id": "2024_06_20_us_shenandoah-hikers-killings-solved", "text": "Almost 30 years after the brutal killings of two women in Virginia\u2019s Shenandoah National Park, the FBI says it now knows who was responsible. DNA evidence and a methodical case review helped identify a suspect in the killings, the FBI\u2019s Richmond Field Office said in a news release Thursday. Laura \u201cLollie\u201d Winans, 26, and Julianne \u201cJulie\u201d Williams, 24, were killed at their campsite near the Skyland Resort on May 24, 1996, according to the release. Family members called the National Park Service when the women did not return home. Their bodies were found about a week later after \u201can extensive search\u201d by National Park Service rangers. After all these years, DNA evidence positively matched Walter \u201cLeo\u201d Jackson Sr., a convicted serial rapist from Cleveland, Ohio, the news release said. \u201cEven though we had this DNA match, we took additional steps and compared evidence from Lollie and Julie\u2019s murders directly to a buccal swab containing Jackson\u2019s DNA. Those results confirmed we had the right man and finally could tell the victim\u2019s families we know who is responsible for this heinous crime,\u201d\u00a0FBI Richmond Special Agent in Charge Stanley Meador said in the news release. The case picked up momentum in 2021 when a new FBI Richmond investigative team conducted a methodical review of the case, taking another look at hundreds of leads and interviews, according to the release. Evidence from the crime scene was sent to a private lab, which successfully pulled DNA from some of the items. Jackson, the man whose DNA matched, had a criminal history \u201cincluding kidnapping, rapes, and assaults,\u201d the release said. He died in prison in March 2018 in Cuyahoga County, Ohio, authorities said. Jackson was a residential painter and an avid hiker who was known to visit Shenandoah National Park. But decades ago, in 2002, a different man was at the center of the case. A federal grand jury in April 2002 indicted Darryl David Rice, a Maryland man incarcerated for other crimes, on charges of capital murder and a hate crime in their slayings. At that point, it was nearly six years after the women\u2019s bodies were found with their throats slashed. Rice, who appears to still be alive, was released from prison in 2011 after some probation violations, according to public and court records. However, the US Attorney\u2019s office made it clear in a public filing 22 years ago that the forensic evidence did not implicate Rice and the DNA materials located on crime scene evidence excluded him, US Attorney for the Western District of Virginia Christopher Kavanaugh said Thursday at the news conference. \u201cIt was in a retesting of the crime scene evidence that developed a profile that was uploaded into the national database that led us to Walter Leo Jackson Sr., ultimately resulting in a finding that there was a one out of 2.6 trillion chance that had originated from someone other than Walter Leo Jackson, Sr.,\u201d Kavanaugh said. \u201cI prosecuted many homicides and cold cases and I have never witnessed statistics that high.\u201d Winans and Williams were members of the LGBTQIA+ community, Kavanaugh said, and although their murders were originally believed to be hate crimes, he has found no evidence of that. The case was eventually dismissed due to the lack of forensic evidence. \u201cMake no mistake, this crime was brutal. This crime was definitionally hateful,\u201d Kavanaugh said. \u201cNevertheless, we do not have any evidence that the victims were selected for or that Jackson had any knowledge of or was otherwise motivated by their membership in a protected class. And if the evidence showed otherwise, I would say it,\u201d he said. Kavanaugh was confident in the strength of the evidence and if the suspect were alive, he\u2019d act on the new information, he said. The families of the victims were not at the news conference. \u201cI want to again extend my condolences to the Winans and Williams families and hope today\u2019s announcement provides some small measure of solace,\u201d Kavanaugh said in a news release.

{"id": "2024_06_16_us_round-rock-texas-park-shooting", "text": "A 17-year-old was arrested on charges of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon Thursday morning in this weekend\u2019s mass shooting at a Juneteenth celebration in Round Rock, Texas, which left two people dead and 14 others injured, according to police. The teenager, Ricky Thompson III, was arrested at about 7:30 a.m. in nearby Pflugerville, Round Rock Police Chief Allen Banks said. He is currently held without bond at the Williamson County Jail in Georgetown, Texas. Jail records do not list his attorney. He has no criminal history and is the suspect who police had said was wearing a white hoodie at the time of the shooting. Thompson was not the only shooter at the event, and he and others could face further charges, the chief said. \u201cWe are still looking for other suspects and continuing to gather all evidence, we\u2019ll continue to talk to witnesses, and we\u2019ll continue to do everything we can to bring everybody involved to justice,\u201d Banks said. The arrest comes days after the shooting Saturday at Old Settlers Park in Round Rock. An altercation broke out between two groups, and \u201cseveral subjects\u201d pulled out guns and shot at each other, Banks said. A large crowd was at the event at the time and \u201cmultiple victims were hit,\u201d the chief said at an earlier news conference. Officers who were at the event responded and began rendering aid, Banks said. Austin-Travis County EMS said earlier first responders transported six people, including two children, to local trauma facilities, \u201call with potentially serious injuries.\u201d Lyndsey Vicknair, a 33-year-old from Manor, and Ara Duke, a 54-year-old from Pflugerville, were killed, police said.

The Juneteenth Festival at Old Settlers Park on Saturday night featured musical performances by different artists, according to the Round Rock Parks and Recreation Department\u2019s\u00a0Facebook page. Round Rock is about 20 miles north of Austin. Banks said the park was closed for the duration of the morning on Father\u2019s Day.

Drake, 50, was believed to be in the Morrilton area after a vehicle he is suspected of stealing was found Tuesday night, authorities said earlier. He was last seen on foot outside a motel in Morrilton, according to a release from the Arkansas Department of Public Safety. \u201cDrake is wanted in connection with homicides and carjackings in Oklahoma and is wanted on other felony warrants from multiple jurisdictions, with charges including aggravated robbery, carjacking, and murder,\u201d the Arkansas Department of Public Safety said.

{"id": "2024_06_18_us_justin-harris-georgia-hot-car-prison-release", "text": "Justin Ross Harris, a Georgia father whose murder\u00a0conviction\u00a0for the hot-car death of his 22-month-old son was\u00a0overturned\u00a0by the state\u2019s Supreme Court in 2022, has been released from prison, according to prison records. Harris was released from Macon State Prison on Father\u2019s Day \u2013 nearly 10 years to the day since his son, Cooper, died after his father left him strapped inside a car for seven hours on a hot day while he went to work \u2013 according to the Georgia Department of Corrections website. The father was convicted of Cooper\u2019s murder in 2016 after prosecutors convinced a jury Harris killed his son to escape the burdens of his marriage and fatherhood. But the life sentence was overturned in 2022 by the Georgia Supreme Court, which ruled 6-3 that evidence submitted by prosecutors of Harris\u2019 extramarital relationships \u2013 which the state had portrayed as the motivation behind his alleged decision to kill his son \u2013 had an unfair prejudicial impact on the jury. Though the murder charges were nullified, the court left in place three other counts relating to his electronic exchanges of lewd material\u00a0with an underage girl. Harris was sentenced to a total of 12 years on those three charges: 10 years for one count of attempt to commit sexual exploitation of a child, and one year each for two counts of dissemination of harmful material to a minor, according to the ruling. Prison records state his maximum release date as June 18, 2024, on the sexual exploitation charge and marks his confinement status as \u201cinactive.\u201d After his release from prison Sunday, he was transferred to the Cobb County Adult Detention Center to serve the two additional years on the other charges, according to the Office of the Cobb County District Attorney. Cooper\u2019s death and his father\u2019s trial captivated the nation, in part because hot-car death cases rarely lead to murder charges against grieving parents who insist leaving their child in a hot car was nothing more than a tragic accident. After prosecutors announced last year they would not retry the murder case against Harris, his attorney said Harris was relieved and \u201cthankful that today\u2019s dismissal may begin to restore Cooper\u2019s legacy as a child much loved by his parents.\u201d \u201cRoss has always accepted the moral responsibility for Cooper\u2019s death. But after all these years of investigation and review, this dismissal of charges confirms that Cooper\u2019s death was unintentional and therefore not a crime,\u201d attorney Carlos Rodriguez said in May 2023. \u201cThroughout the course of representing Ross, we have learned that these tragic accidents often happen while the child is in the care of a loving parent. Ross was no different,\u201d Rodriguez said. Cooper\u2019s mother, Leanna Taylor, has stood by her belief that Harris did not intend to kill their child that sweltering day. She said after the Georgia Supreme Court ruling that she hoped it would change how their son is remembered. \u201cThat he was wanted, that he was loved and that he is missed every single day,\u201d she said in a statement released by her attorney. While the trial revealed that on the day their son died, Harris exchanged sexual messages and photos with five women and a 16-year-old minor, Taylor maintained that Harris remained a loving father despite failing their marriage. The couple has since divorced. \u201cRoss was a loving and proud father to Cooper. At the same time Ross was being a terrible husband. These two things can and did exist at the same time.\u201d CNN\u2019s Ray Sanchez contributed to this report.

The swapped photo appeared in East Brunswick High School\u2019s 2024 yearbook that was handed out to the senior class \u2013 prompting an independent investigation that started on June 6 and was completed on Tuesday, according to attorney Yaacov Brisman, whose law firm was retained\u00a0by the school district\u00a0to conduct the probe. Seniors who received the yearbooks had been asked to return them so that the errant page can be replaced, CNN previously reported. An unidentified school staff member who served as a Yearbook Club advisor placed the incorrect image in the yearbook, Brisman said in the report. \u201cI conclude that the use of the incorrect photograph was not purposeful, but rather was a highly unfortunate error,\u201d Brisman wrote in the findings, adding the staff member\u2019s actions were \u201cat best careless\u201d but \u201ccan also be considered negligent.\u201d \u201c\u2026 I have no basis to find that she acted out of any animus, racial, religious, or political, towards Jewish or Muslim students,\u201d he said\u00a0in the report. The\u00a0Jewish Federation in the Heart of New Jersey\u00a0demanded facts and accountability after it learned of the swapped photo. Muslim Student Association Vice President Ali Salama said in a statement after the incident came to light, the MSA \u201chad no involvement in this, yet we have become the face of the whole incident because our faces weren\u2019t even blurred out before the photo was posted on social media.\u201d In his report, Brisman gave a series of recommendations to the school district, notably that it should \u201crevisit the entire Yearbook production process and implement more sophisticated review measures.\u201d Any decisions on taking disciplinary action against the school\u2019s administration for the error will be left to the discretion of the school\u2019s administration, he wrote. The unidentified school staff member who was interviewed by investigators \u201cexpressed deep remorse at her error, and sadness that her mistake caused the uproar,\u201d Brisman said\u00a0in the report.\u00a0 \u201cShe was visibly distressed when discussing the possibility that she might have done this purposefully, and vehemently denied having done so,\u201d Brisman added. In a Wednesday news release, East Brunswick Public Schools Superintendent Victor Valeski said: \u201cWhile I\u2019m grateful that the results of this investigation show that these actions were serious mistakes without malice, we must now focus on repairing the deep hurt and division that has been created in our school and community.\u201d The superintendent said the school district will work with the state\u2019s board of education to ensure \u201cthere is accountability for the mistakes that were made and take measures, including implementing a tolerance training program for the start of the next school year, to ensure something like this never happens again.\u201d CNN\u2019s Emma Tucker and Taso Stefanidis contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/21/us/east-brunswick-high-school-yearbook-investigation/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/22/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_20_us_columbia-university-protesters-trespass-dismissed", "text": "A New York judge on Thursday dismissed trespassing cases against 30 individuals who were among the\u00a0dozens arrested\u00a0inside Columbia University\u2019s Hamilton Hall during a pro-Palestinian protest in April, with prosecutors citing a lack of evidence. Of the 46 initially arrested, 15 defendants still face charges, the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office said. Dozens of pro-Palestinian protesters were accused of unlawfully entering the university\u2019s Hamilton Hall on April 30 and barricading themselves inside before the university asked for assistance from the New York Police Department. After being removed from the building, many were charged with criminal trespass in the third degree, a class B misdemeanor. Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg said at the time he intended to look at each case and make decisions based on facts and the law. In the past, the Manhattan DA\u2019s office has declined to prosecute or deferred prosecution cases where large numbers of people were arrested as part of civil disobedience. During Thursday\u2019s court hearing, Judge Kevin McGrath dismissed 30 cases of trespass against those who have no criminal history. One other defendant previously had their case dismissed, for a total of 31 individuals no longer facing charges. \u201cAt the time of the charged conduct, the defendants were either staff employed by, or students enrolled in, Columbia University, and are now subject to student or staff disciplinary proceedings,\u201d according to the Manhattan DA\u2019s news release. In calling for the dismissal of charges Thursday, Assistant District Attorney Stephen Millan cited what he called \u201cextremely limited video,\u201d adding that \u201cthe security cameras were immediately covered by certain defendants,\u201d who prosecutors have been unable to identify. The available video evidence \u201cfails to establish or prove\u201d the 31 people participated in damaging university property or causing harm to anyone, making it difficult for prosecutors to prove anything other than trespassing at trial, the DA\u2019s office said. Also complicating matters, students inside Hamilton Hall were wearing face masks, making it difficult to tie students to specific acts, according to a law enforcement official. Columbia University on Thursday declined to comment on the court proceedings when contacted by CNN. Protesters \u2018unanimously\u2019 reject deals Fourteen of the defendants still facing charges \u2013 12 of whom were neither staff nor students at Columbia \u2013 have been offered Adjournments in Contemplation of Dismissal (ACD), the Manhattan DA\u2019s office said. An ACD allows a court to defer a defendant\u2019s case \u2013 with the potential that the defendant\u2019s charge will be dismissed \u2013 if the defendant does not engage in additional criminal conduct. But those defendants have refused the offer, they said at a news conference held outside the courtroom after Thursday\u2019s hearing, speaking to demonstrators wearing keffiyehs, a traditional Palestinian scarf. \u201cWe stand here today united by our action and the Palestinian cause,\u201d one of the protesters said. \u201cThe state has attempted, once again, to divide us \u2013 dismissing some of our cases and offering others deals in accordance with their outside agitator narrative,\u201d adding they reject the division they say is intended to \u201cpreserve the sanctity of Columbia University, not an institution in the city of New York but always above and apart from it.\u201d \u201cAll of us who took part in the liberation of Hind\u2019s Hall were driven by the same necessity to escalate, to escalate for Gaza, to resist the savage genocide of our siblings in Palestine,\u201d the protester continued, referring to Hamilton Hall by another name bestowed on it by protesters. \u201cWe exercised our shared right to oppose the US war machine by putting our bodies upon the years of Columbia, one of its most well-oiled domestic components.\u201d The protester said the defendants unanimously rejected deals to present a \u201cunited front against state repression.\u201d The 14 defendants are scheduled to appear back in court on July 25. \u201cThe only allegation that\u2019s different is they weren\u2019t currently enrolled as a student or weren\u2019t employed by the university,\u201d said public defender Matthew Daloisio, who is representing 43 defendants. Daloisio argued those defendants experienced the same police raid and got the same injuries as anyone else during the NYPD raid. A 15th defendant, James Carlson, 40, was arrested on burglary charges at Columbia University, is facing a charge of criminal trespass in the third degree from the Manhattan DA, according to court records. He is also facing an arson charge from a separate incident. He\u2019s pleaded not guilty in both cases, court records show. On Thursday, Carlson went before the judge, where the prosecutor recounted how he is being accused of involvement in the Hamilton Hall protest. Carlson is accused of damaging a NYPD camera and being involved in burning an Israeli flag. When the prosecutor described the flag burning in court, some supporters in the courtroom snickered, prompting the court officer to reprimand them, telling them to be quiet. The district attorney said there are ongoing school disciplinary proceedings for the students who had their case dismissed.

The abortion pill will continue to be available to patients via mail, without an in-person doctor\u2019s visit. Because the case was dismissed due to lack of legal standing, the door is still open for future challenges against mifepristone. The fight over abortion is well underway in state legislatures and courts. On May 2, Arizona Gov.

Lizzette Zambrano, a resident of El Paso County, Texas, accuses the \u201coperators, managers, and possessors\u201d of the Sonoran Sea Resort in Sonora, Mexico, of being \u201cgrossly negligent,\u201d which led to her injury and the death of her husband, Jorge Guillen, according to the lawsuit.\u00a0She is now recovering at home, her attorney said. \u201cI want somebody to take accountability for what happened to my\u00a0husband\u00a0and myself,\u201d Zambrano\u00a0told ABC\u2019s Good Morning America\u00a0in\u00a0an\u00a0interview aired Friday. The couple were on vacation at the resort on June 11 when they decided to spend time in the hot tub, the lawsuit said. As soon as Guillen entered the tub, he was \u201cexposed to an electrical current in the water,\u201d it said. \u201cJorge immediately keeled over into the tub and was taken under the surface of the water,\u201d according to the lawsuit. \u201cWitnessing her husband immediately collapse, Lizzette sprang forward from the pool deck to try and grab Jorge\u2019s body \u2026 \u201d Zambrano attempted to rescue him, the suit states, but was also shocked. She was eventually rescued by a bystander and taken to a hospital. \u201cPatrons attempted to assist, grabbing a shepherd\u2019s cross and other items to attempt to get Jorge\u2019s body,\u201d the suit claims. \u201cHowever, the metal from the objects carried the electrical current and began shocking the rescuers.\u201d The lawsuit names vacation rental\u00a0companies\u00a0Casago, LLC, Casago\u00a0International, LLC and High Desert\u00a0Travel,\u00a0Inc. as defendants.

Zambrano told ABC: \u201cA lot of people jumped\u00a0in, but they kept jumping out because the shocks were so strong.\u201d In a statement to CNN, Casago LLC said, \u201cWe are devastated by what has occurred and our hearts are with the family and the victims of this terrible\u00a0incident.\u201d \u201cThe Sonoran Sea is a condo\u00a0resort\u00a0and the homeowners\u2019 association is responsible for all common areas,\u00a0including the maintenance of the swimming pool,\u00a0hot\u00a0tubs, and grounds.
