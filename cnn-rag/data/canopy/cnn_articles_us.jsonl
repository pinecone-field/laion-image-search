A new Massachusetts policy goes into effect today, banning overnight stays at Logan International Airport.  Some eligible families on a waiting list will be taken to new shelters, officials said, including a former prison in Norfolk, Massachusetts, that was recently converted into an emergency shelter. The move comes as state officials say they\u2019ve run out of shelter space. \u201cWe\u2019ve never thought that Logan was an appropriate place for people to be staying overnight,\u201d Gov. Maura Healey told CNN affiliate WBZ after announcing the policy. Officials converted a former prison into a shelter. It\u2019s controversial For months, officials in Massachusetts have warned they were overwhelmed by the number of migrants arriving. Healey said last year that the state\u2019s emergency shelter system for families had reached capacity with 7,500 families. At one point last year, the state\u2019s lieutenant governor called on residents to consider housing migrants in their homes due to the lack of shelter space. And recently a delegation from the state traveled to the US Southern border to spread the word \u201cabout how Massachusetts is out of shelter space,\u201d officials said. In May officials announced that the Bay State Correctional Center in Norfolk, which shut down in 2015, was being converted into an emergency shelter that could house 140 families. The controversial announcement sparked protests outside the facility some 25 miles southwest of Boston, WBZ reported. Footage from the CNN affiliate showed protesters waving signs that said, \u201cNo kids in prisons\u201d and \u201cNorfolk Prison-Shelter Not Safe for Anyone!\u201d And at a heated community meeting last month, tensions flared as Norfolk residents expressed concerns about possible impacts on schools, medical services and public safety, according to WBZ. Police and social workers escorted families out Migrants have been sleeping in a corner of the Boston airport\u2019s international arrivals terminal for months. Footage from CNN affiliates showed people lining up sleeping bags, blankets and pillows in rows along the walls of the terminal. At one point, hundreds of migrant families were staying there, CNN affiliate WCVB reported. On June 25, officials said 288 people had slept there overnight. By Tuesday morning, only a few families remained. After sunrise, WBZ reported that state police, social workers and airport staff led those migrants to taxis, which took migrants to welcome centers in Allston and Quincy. \u201cThis is in the best interest of families and travelers and staff at Logan, as the airport is not an appropriate place for people to seek shelter,\u201d state Emergency Assistance Director Scott Rice said in a press release last month. \u201cWe are going to continue to spread the word that Massachusetts is out of shelter space and that, if families are travelling to Massachusetts, they need to be prepared with a plan for housing that does not include Logan Airport or our Emergency Assistance shelters.\u201d CNN\u2019s Braden Walker contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/09/us/boston-logan-airport-migrants-cec/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/10/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_07_05_us_nashville-school-shooter-writings", "text": "The writings of the person who\u00a0killed three 9-year-olds and three adults\u00a0at a private Christian elementary school in Nashville last year cannot be released to the public, a judge ruled Thursday. Chancery Court Judge I\u2019Ashea Myles found that The Covenant School children and parents hold the copyright to any writings or other works created by shooter Audrey Hale, a former student who was killed by police. Hale\u2019s parents inherited the works and then transferred ownership to the families. Myles ruled that \u201cthe original writings, journals, art, photos and videos created by Hale\u201d are subject to an exception to the Tennessee Public Records Act created by the federal Copyright Act. The ruling comes more than a year after several groups filed public records requests for documents seized by Metro Nashville Police during their investigation into the\u00a0March 2023 shooting. The shooter left behind at least 20 journals, a suicide note and a memoir, according to court filings. When the records requests were denied, several parties sued, and the situation quickly ballooned into a messy mix of conspiracy theories,\u00a0leaked documents, probate battles and\u00a0accusations of ethical misconduct. Myles\u2019 order will almost surely be appealed. After the initial records requests last year, police said they would eventually release the documents but could not do so right away because their investigation was still open. The groups suing for the immediate release of the records \u2014 including news outlets, a gun rights group, a law enforcement nonprofit and Tennessee state Sen. Todd Gardenhire \u2014 argued that there was no meaningful criminal investigation underway since Hale, who police say acted alone, was dead. Meanwhile, a group of Covenant parents was allowed to intervene in the case and argue that the records should never become public. They said the release would be traumatic for the families and could inspire copycat attacks. As part of the effort to keep the records closed, Hale\u2019s parents transferred ownership of Hale\u2019s property to the parents\u2019 group. Attorneys for the parents then argued they owned the copyright, further reason the records could not be released. Also intervening in the case were The Covenant School and the Covenant Presbyterian Church, which shares a building. They argued the records should remain closed because their release could threaten their security. Part of the interest in the records stems from the fact that Hale, who police say was \u201cassigned female at birth,\u201d may have identified as a transgender man. Republican Sen. Josh Hawley, of Missouri, is among those who have promoted a theory that the shooting was a hate crime against Christians. The delay in releasing the writings fueled speculation \u2014 particularly in conservative circles \u2014 over what they might contain and conspiracy theories about why police wouldn\u2019t immediately release them. As the court case has dragged on, pages from one journal were\u00a0leaked to a conservative commentator\u00a0who posted them to social media in November. More recently, The Tennessee Star\u00a0published dozens of stories\u00a0based on allegedly 80 pages of Hale\u2019s writings provided by an unnamed source. The publication is among the plaintiffs, and Myles briefly threatened to hold the paper\u2019s editor-in-chief, Michael Leahy, and owner, Star News Digital Media, in contempt.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/05/us/nashville-school-shooter-writings/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/10/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_07_09_us_missouri-sandra-hemme-release", "text": "Kansas City, Missouri (AP) \u2014 An appellate court has ordered the release of a Missouri woman whose murder conviction was overturned after she served 43 years in prison, but the state attorney general is still trying to keep her behind bars as the case is reviewed. Monday\u2019s ruling by a panel of appeals court judges comes after a judge\u00a0ruled that Sandra Hemme\u2019s\u00a0attorneys had established \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d of \u201cactual innocence.\u201d Judge Ryan Horsman said on June 14 that she must be freed within 30 days\u00a0unless prosecutors decide to retry her. The appeals court granted Republican Attorney General Andrew Bailey\u2019s request to review Horsman\u2019s decision, but told Horsman meanwhile to establish her bail terms and set her free. The attorney general\u2019s office, which almost always objects to wrongful conviction claims, then asked the appellate court to reconsider, saying the court didn\u2019t give them enough time to argue against her release. Bailey\u2019s office also argued that Hemme was sentenced decades ago to 12 years for violence in prison, and she would start serving that penalty now. Her attorneys responded Tuesday that keeping her incarcerated any longer would be a \u201cdraconian outcome.\u201d Hemme, now 64, has been serving a life sentence at a prison northeast of Kansas City after she was twice convicted of murder in the death of library worker Patricia Jeschke. She\u2019s now the longest-held wrongly incarcerated woman known in the US, according to her legal team at the Innocence Project. After an extensive review,\u00a0Horsman found that Hemme was heavily sedated and in a \u201cmalleable mental state\u201d when investigators repeatedly questioned her in a psychiatric hospital. Police ignored evidence pointing to a discredited fellow officer who died in 2015, and the prosecution wasn\u2019t told about FBI results that could have cleared her, so it was never disclosed before her trials. The prosecutor at her trial agreed, four decades later, that nothing linked her to the crime other than her confession, which followed multiple contradictory statements, the judge noted. Her attorneys described her ultimate confession in a court filing as \u201coften monosyllabic responses to leading questions.\u201d \u201cShe is the victim of a manifest injustice,\u201d Horsman concluded in his 118-page ruling. \u201cThis Court finds that the totality of the evidence supports a finding of actual innocence.\u201d But Bailey then sought a\u00a0delay\u00a0in Hemme\u2019s release to allow an appellate court review, saying she represents a safety risk to herself or others, citing a 1990s attack on a prison worker and statements she made decades ago about enjoying violence, and arguing that the evidence she presented is not \u201cnewly discovered,\u201d so \u201cHemme did not meet the actual innocence standard as a matter of law.\u201d The Buchanan County prosecutor\u2019s office, which tried the case, didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment. Hemme was arrested weeks after the death of Jeschke, a 31-year-old library worker who lived in St. Joseph, Missouri. After Jeschke missed work on November 13, 1980, her worried mother climbed through an apartment window and discovered her daughter\u2019s nude body on the floor, surrounded by blood, with her hands tied behind her back and a telephone cord and a pair of pantyhose wrapped around her throat. A knife was under her head. These and other details were released to the media by the St. Joseph police chief, Robert Hayes, as the crime prompted a massive investigation. Meanwhile, the department took only a cursory look at Michael Holman, a since discredited St. Joseph police officer who was being investigated for insurance fraud and burglaries, and ended that investigation after evidence cast doubt on his alibi. Holman\u2019s plea deal included a promise not to prosecute him for any other \u201ccriminal matters now under investigation.\u201d He died in 2015, according to the judge\u2019s finding of facts. Hemme wasn\u2019t on anyone\u2019s radar until she showed up more than two weeks after the killing at the home of a nurse who once treated her, carrying a knife and refusing to leave. Police took her back to St. Joseph\u2019s Hospital, the latest in a string of hospitalizations that began when she started hearing voices at the age of 12, and she was heavily sedated. It turned out that Hemme had been discharged from the hospital and hitchhiked out of town hours before Jeschke was last seen alive. She showed up that evening at her parents\u2019 home, more than 100 miles (160 kilometers) to the east. Police interviewed the initial driver who provided her alibi, but this wasn\u2019t shared with the jury, the judge found. Investigators began interrogating her as the psychiatric hospital treated her with antipsychotic drugs that triggered involuntary muscle spasms. She complained that her eyes were rolling back in her head. Detectives said Hemme seemed \u201cmentally confused\u201d and not fully able to comprehend their questions, her attorneys argued. Hemme ultimately pleaded guilty to murder to avoid the death penalty, and after her plea was thrown out on appeal, she was convicted again in 1985 after a one-day trial. The prosecutor told Horsman that police never shared exculpatory evidence, including FBI tests that ruled out any connection between Hemme and crime scene evidence. Police also didn\u2019t share key evidence pointing to their fellow officer, even though his pickup truck was seen outside the victim\u2019s apartment, he tried to use her credit card and her earrings were found in his home. When Holman couldn\u2019t be ruled out as the source of a palm print detected on a TV antenna cable found next to the victim\u2019s body, the FBI asked for clearer prints. Police, however, didn\u2019t follow up. An FBI report also found that a hair found on the victim\u2019s bedsheet had \u201cmicroscopic characteristics similar to Holman\u2019s head hair samples and he could not be eliminated as the source.\u201d Jurors never heard these details because the police never shared them with prosecutors, the judge found. \u201cThis Court finds that the evidence shows that Ms. Hemme\u2019s statements to police are so unreliable and that the evidence pointing to Michael Holman as the perpetrator of the crime (is) so objective and probative that no reasonable juror would find Ms. Hemme guilty,\u201d Horsman concluded. The judge also noted how police had showed Hemme crime scene photos and other details that a prosecutor later falsely told jurors only the killer would know. Chief Hayes \u2014 who died in 2010 after serving time for involuntary manslaughter \u2014 also was unusually involved, the judge noted, participating in questioning the victim\u2019s father as he described buying his daughter a pair of gold horseshoe-shaped earrings. That those earrings were found in Holman\u2019s home is another fact the jury never heard.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/09/us/missouri-sandra-hemme-release/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/10/2024", "section": "us"}}

Kennedy Jr. and Cornel West on the state\u2019s ballot after learning that some voters who signed petitions to help the independent presidential hopefuls gain ballot access did not understand the purpose of those petitions. The findings potentially lend credence to some of the objections filed by allies of President Joe Biden seeking to block access for the two candidates in the key battleground state. At a North Carolina State\u00a0Board\u00a0of\u00a0Elections\u00a0hearing on Tuesday, board staff shared\u00a0that they\u00a0had reached out to\u00a0voters\u00a0who\u00a0signed\u00a0petitions\u00a0to help the minor parties established by Kennedy and West to gain ballot access in the state and found\u00a0that some\u00a0of\u00a0them \u201cwere not told the\u00a0purpose\u00a0and intent or did not understand the\u00a0purpose\u00a0and intent\u201d\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0petitions\u00a0they\u00a0signed. In its objections to both Kennedy and West\u2019s ballot access, the pro-Biden super PAC Clear Choice claimed that both candidates were \u201cmisleading\u201d voters who signed their petitions, arguing that the candidates had violated a state law that requires newly formed political parties to inform signers of the \u201cgeneral purpose and intent\u201d of the party. An elections board\u00a0staff member reached out to 26\u00a0voters\u00a0who\u00a0signed\u00a0the Kennedy campaign\u2019s petition to get his We The People party on the ballot and 66 people who\u00a0signed\u00a0the\u00a0West\u00a0campaign\u2019s petition to help his Justice For All party qualify. West\u2019s campaign submitted over 17,000 validated signatures, while Kennedy\u2019s campaign submitted over 18,500 validated signatures. Minor parties must submit at least 13,000 valid signatures to be considered for approval by North Carolina\u2019s\u00a0elections\u00a0board. Board staff also spoke to 12 North Carolina voters who said they did not recall signing petitions to help West qualify for the state\u2019s ballot. None of the Kennedy petition signatories recalled not supporting his ballot access, staff said. The\u00a0elections board\u00a0did not take action Tuesday, with board chair Alan Hirsch saying that staffers were still reviewing materials submitted during the petition process for both\u00a0minor parties. Tuesday\u2019s brief meeting revealed partisan tensions on the five-seat\u00a0board, which features three Democrats and two Republicans. The Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee criticized the\u00a0board\u00a0for delaying a ruling at a hearing last month. Following last month\u2019s hearing, a conservative-aligned group called Fair Election Fund launched an ad campaign targeting the Democratic members of the board for \u201cblocking Biden\u2019s competition from the ballot.\u201d Kevin Lewis, a Republican elections\u00a0board\u00a0member, suggested Tuesday that the\u00a0board\u00a0had an ulterior reason for delaying a ruling, saying, \u201cYour motives are being questioned.\u201d Democratic\u00a0board\u00a0member Siobhan O\u2019Duffy Millen criticized the attacks on the\u00a0board, citing the Fair\u00a0Election\u00a0Fund ads. \u201cSome\u00a0of\u00a0the rhetoric is a little bit out\u00a0of\u00a0hand,\u201d O\u2019Duffy Millen said. \u201cSome\u00a0of\u00a0these ads that are very personal are unfortunate.\u201d Meanwhile, Kennedy has qualified for Minnesota\u2019s presidential ballot, a state elections official told CNN on Tuesday. He\u2019s also qualified in Michigan, Tennessee, Oklahoma, Delaware, California, Hawaii and Utah \u2013 making him eligible to compete for 110 electoral votes in total.

{"id": "2024_07_09_politics_biden-nato-summit-ukraine-aid", "text": "President Joe Biden on Tuesday announced plans to supply new air defenses to Ukraine in a speech opening the NATO summit \u2013 providing much-needed support for the country at a critical juncture in its defense against Russia\u2019s invasion. The US, Germany, and Romania will each provide a Patriot battery of their own, while the Netherlands will work with other countries to enable an additional Patriot battery, each country announced in a joint statement. Meanwhile, Italy would also provide a SAMP-T long-range air defense system. The statement said the air-defense systems \u201cwill help to protect Ukrainian cities, civilians, and soldiers, and we are coordinating with the Ukrainian government so that these systems can be utilized rapidly.\u201d During his speech on Tuesday, Biden vowed that \u201cthe United States will make sure that when we export critical air defense interceptors, Ukraine goes to the front of the line.\u201d \u201cThey will get this assistance before anyone else gets it,\u201d Biden added. Israel also receives defensive interceptors from the United States, though the country relies far more on its Iron Dome to intercept drones and rockets. The US had previously discussed sending Patriot interceptors in Israel to Ukraine. In addition to the long-range aerial defense systems, the US and other countries are also providing Ukraine with \u201cdozens\u201d of short- and medium-range systems to help Kyiv intercept Russian drones and missiles. The systems including NASAMS, HAWKs, IRIS T-SLM, IRIS T-SLS, and Gepard systems. Canada, Norway, Spain, the UK and other countries will \u201cplay an integral role\u201d in providing the systems to Ukraine, while \u201cmany other supporters\u201d will provide the interceptor missiles, the statement said. Ukrainian President Volodymyr\u00a0Zelensky said he would fight for \u201cdecisive actions\u201d from\u00a0the United States\u00a0and Europe to help Ukraine. \u201cIt is not only our country that needs it \u2013 everyone needs it, literally every partner, all nations,\u201d Zelensky said in his first remarks after arriving in the US. The Ukrainian president said he would ask for more air defense systems, F-16 fighter jets, and additional security guarantees, \u201cincluding weapons and finances, political support.\u201d One day before Biden\u2019s announcement, Russian strikes across Ukraine killed at least 22 people and injured 68 more, according to Ukrainian officials, including a strike on the country\u2019s largest children\u2019s hospital. On Monday evening, Biden called the strikes a \u201chorrific reminder of Russia\u2019s brutality.\u201d Two-and-a-half years into the war with Russia, Zelensky has repeatedly asked allied nations to strengthen his country\u2019s air defenses to thwart Moscow\u2019s military prowess overhead. The United States has been a crucial ally to Ukraine since Russia\u2019s invasion in 2022 \u2013 but the future of that alliance has been thrown into question. Former President Donald Trump has said he would pressure Ukraine into a peace deal with Russia that would see Kyiv cede territory in the process if he wins the presidency. Earlier this year, Trump said he would allow Russia to do \u201cwhatever the hell they want\u201d with countries that don\u2019t meet NATO defense-funding obligations. Support for Ukraine was also a prime topic at this year\u2019s G7 summit in Italy, where Biden and Zelensky signed an agreement that commits the US for 10 years to continued training of Ukraine\u2019s armed forces, more cooperation in the production of weapons and military equipment, the continued provision of military assistance and greater intelligence sharing. But that agreement could be undone under a different administration. Biden spoke Tuesday from the Mellon Auditorium, where the North Atlantic Treaty was signed in 1949 \u2013 creating the alliance \u2013 and where former President Bill Clinton held the alliance\u2019s 50th\u00a0anniversary summit. Given the backdrop, Biden leaned into the history of the alliance and the trajectory of the threats it has faced \u2013 and argued that, under his leadership, NATO has become stronger than ever. \u201cAll we allies knew before this war Putin thought NATO would break,\u201d Biden said. \u201cToday, NATO is stronger than its ever been in its history.\u201d He concluded his speech by presenting NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg with the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Biden\u2019s remarks were scripted and read from a teleprompter, but the stakes were high for the president as many members of his own party and the public writ large are watching him closely following his poor debate performance late last month. Some members of his own party have recently said\u00a0they want more evidence of his mental and physical fitness before deciding whether to back him for four more years. Biden largely got through his speech without any major hiccups, though he did appear to accidentally read stage instructions from his prepared remarks while presenting the medal to Stoltenberg. Though foreign diplomats were horrified by Biden\u2019s debate performance, the president has several more chances to prove himself this week \u2013 including during a solo press conference on Thursday.

{"id": "2024_07_08_us_college-value-cost-americans-skeptical-poll", "text": "Americans are increasingly skeptical about the value and cost of college, with most saying they feel the US higher education system is headed in the \u201cwrong direction,\u201d according to a new poll. Overall, only 36% of adults say they have a \u201cgreat deal\u201d or \u201cquite a lot\u201d of confidence in higher education, according to the report released Monday by Gallup and the Lumina Foundation. That confidence level has declined steadily from 57% in 2015. Some of the same opinions have been reflected in\u00a0declining enrollment\u00a0as colleges contend with the effects of the\u00a0student debt crisis, concerns about the high cost of tuition and\u00a0political debates\u00a0over how they teach about race and other topics. The dimming view of whether college is worth the time and money cuts across all demographics \u2014 including gender, age and political affiliation. Among Republicans, the number of respondents with high confidence in higher education has dropped 36 percentage points over the last decade \u2014 far more than it dropped for Democrats or independents. \u201cIt\u2019s so expensive, and I don\u2019t think colleges are teaching people what they need to get a job,\u201d says Randy Hill, 59, a registered Republican in Connecticut and a driver for a car service. His nephew plans to do a welding apprenticeship after graduating high school. \u201cYou graduate out of college, you\u2019re up to eyeballs in debt, you can\u2019t get a job, then you can\u2019t pay it off. What\u2019s the point?\u201d The June 2024 survey\u2019s overall finding \u2014 that 36% of adults feel strong confidence in higher education \u2014 is unchanged from the year before. But what concerns researchers is shifting opinion on the bottom end, with fewer Americans saying they have \u201csome\u201d confidence and more reporting \u201cvery little\u201d and \u201cnone.\u201d This year\u2019s findings show almost as many people have little or no confidence, 32%, as those with high confidence. Experts say fewer college graduates could worsen labor shortages in fields from health care to information technology. For those who forgo college, it often means lower lifetime earnings \u2014 75% less compared with those who get bachelor\u2019s degrees, according to Georgetown University\u2019s Center on Education and the Workforce. And during an economic downturn, those without degrees are more likely to lose jobs. \u201cIt is sad to see that confidence hasn\u2019t grown at all,\u201d says Courtney Brown, vice president at Lumina, an education nonprofit focused on increasing the numbers of students who seek education beyond high school. \u201cWhat\u2019s shocking to me is that the people who have low or no confidence is actually increasing.\u201d This year\u2019s survey added new, detailed questions in an effort to understand why confidence is shrinking. Almost one-third of respondents say college is \u201ctoo expensive,\u201d while 24% feel students are not being properly educated or taught what they need to succeed. The survey did not specifically touch on the\u00a0protests this year against the war in Gaza\u00a0that divided many college campuses, but political views weighed heavily on the findings. Respondents voiced concerns about indoctrination, political bias and that colleges today are too liberal. Among the respondents who lack confidence, 41% cite political agendas as a reason. Among other findings: More than two-thirds, or 67%, of respondents say college is headed in the \u201cwrong direction,\u201d compared with just 31% who feel it\u2019s going in the right direction. Generally when people express confidence in higher education, they are thinking of four-year institutions, according to Gallup. But the survey found that more people have confidence in two-year institutions. Forty-nine percent of adults say they have \u201ca great deal\u201d or \u201cquite a lot\u201d of confidence in two-year programs, compared with 33% of Americans who feel that way about four-year colleges.

{"id": "2024_07_07_us_hitchhiker-serial-killer-daughter-podcast-cec", "text": "Steve Fishman was still in his teens when he came face-to-face with a serial killer. At 19, he was hitchhiking from a friend\u2019s place in Boston to Norwich, Connecticut, where he was an intern at a newspaper. Fishman was not far from his destination and sticking out his thumb when a man pulled over in a green Buick sedan, said his name was \u201cRed,\u201d and told him to hop in. The man appeared friendly and had a balding head with wispy patches of red hair, likely the reason for his nickname. But as Fishman would learn later, the man harbored a dark secret: His name was Robert Frederick Carr III, and he was a serial killer who preyed on young hitchhikers. Three years earlier, Carr had raped and strangled two 11-year-old boys and a 16-year-old girl who\u2019d hitched a ride with him in the Miami area. When he gave Fishman a ride, he was on parole after serving time for a rape in Connecticut. Fishman\u2019s ride lasted only about 15 minutes \u2014 Carr dropped him off unharmed \u2014 but his memories of that fall 1975 encounter have haunted him for decades. About six months later, Carr was arrested for an attempted rape of a hitchhiker in the Miami area and then startled detectives when he confessed to kidnapping and raping more than a dozen people and killing four of them. Edna Buchanan, the Pulitzer Prize-winning Miami police reporter who wrote a book about Carr, once said: \u201cHe was about the most evil person I ever met.\u201d Fishman was stunned when he saw Carr\u2019s picture on a breaking news alert. He recognized him instantly as the talkative man who\u2019d given him a ride. In retrospect, Fishman said, he missed several major red flags that day. First, the sedan\u2019s door latch on the passenger side was jammed and Fishman had to roll down the window and open it from the outside. And Carr had casually mentioned he had just got out of prison. \u201cI\u2019m an intern at a local newspaper. And I\u2019m thinking, \u2018Wow, that could be a good story about a guy getting out of prison, trying to reintegrate into the community,\u201d Fishman told CNN. \u201cI really didn\u2019t stop to think or ask him what the crime was. I didn\u2019t have any idea.\u201d Nearly five decades later, Fishman and Carr\u2019s daughter, Donna, are unraveling lingering questions about the pedophile and killer in a new season of the \u201cSmoke Screen\u201d podcast titled, \u201cMy Friend, the Serial Killer.\u201d In the podcast, they explore Carr\u2019s brutal crimes and and deceptions by digging through confession tapes, a box of his personal items from prison and hours of interviews with detectives. Although her father died in a Florida prison in 2007, Donna continues to struggle with her family\u2019s dark past. And Fishman still wonders how he made it out of Carr\u2019s sedan alive. A job on the road offers an opportunity to prey on hitchhikers In the 1970s, hitchhiking was considered a safe way to get from point A to B. \u201cIt was a pretty regular mode of transportation back then,\u201d said Fishman, who as an intern constantly relied on random strangers to drive him where he wanted to go. \u201cDepending on where you lived, we hitchhiked a lot. It was so safe, there were moms who picked me up hitchhiking, with their kids in the backseat with groceries,\u201d he said. Carr may have played on this belief to carry out his crimes, which mostly targeted hitchhikers. A TV repairman and car salesman, Carr lived in Norwich with his wife and two kids: Donna and her younger brother. But he traveled nationwide for work and used that opportunity to prey on underage children. Nearly all his crimes, which occurred in the 1970s, involved children under age 18. In 1972, Carr picked up two 11-year-old hitchhiking friends, raped and strangled them, then buried them in Louisiana and Mississippi.\u00a0 He also picked up a 16-year-old girl and drove her from Miami to Mississippi before he strangled her. He strangled his fourth victim, Rhonda Holloway, 21, not long after his encounter with Fishman and buried her in Connecticut. Carr would later take investigators on a cross-country trip to show them where he\u2019d buried his victims. \u201cWhat he did to those children was truly unprintable,\u201d David Simmons, a detective involved in his arrest, said in a 2007 interview. \u201cIn my 33-year career in law enforcement, Carr ranks as the most dangerous child sexual predator-murderer I ever investigated.\u201d A daughter changes her last name to escape her father\u2019s shadow Five decades later, Donna is still living in the shadows of her father\u2019s horrific legacy. She is married, with another last name, and asked CNN to withhold her full name for safety reasons. In an exclusive interview with CNN, Donna tearfully described an adolescence filled with bullying and jokes about having a serial killer dad.\u00a0She barely looked people in the eye as a child, she said.\u00a0Those who knew who she was pointed and talked about her father in hushed tones. Donna said she first learned about her father\u2019s murderous rampage when she was 12. But she didn\u2019t believe he was the monster he was portrayed to be until he led police on a road trip to unearth his buried victims in Louisiana, Mississippi and Connecticut. \u201cWhen he agreed to take the detectives on the search for the bodies, the denial could no longer be. Just every range of emotions you could possibly think of for a 12-year-old girl to go through,\u201d said Donna, 60, who now lives in West Virginia. \u201cAnd that\u2019s when I started to withdraw.\u201d Today Donna has a 27-year-old daughter and worries that a public connection to her father could lead to a new wave of harassment for them. She dropped her father\u2019s last name years ago in favor of her married name, and has told her daughter about his history. \u201cSometimes in life, his name can come up on things like background checks for employment, and so on,\u201d Donna said. \u201cI raised my daughter to be very mature and to understand things. I didn\u2019t want to lie to her.\u201d Donna said she wishes people would show more compassion for relatives of convicted killers. They grieve too, but dare not verbalize their loss, she said. \u201cNo one sees what\u2019s happening in the lives of those people just by hearing about a news story,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re humans and they have feelings and they get hurt, and they suffer trauma. And they are very much victims, too, but in a different sense.\u201d A hitchhiker asks a killer why he spared his life After her father\u2019s crimes became public, Donna spent much of her adolescence holed up inside their Norwich home with her mother. But one day Fishman, still an intern at the newspaper, knocked on their door after her father\u2019s arrest. He pleaded with Donna\u2019s mother to let Carr know that the guy whose life he\u2019d spared months earlier would like to visit him in jail for an interview. Fishman finally got a chance to interview Carr in prison in the mid-1970s after numerous attempts. In hours of recorded jailhouse interviews, Carr never pretended to be a saint, Fishman said. He talked about how he stole cars and offered sex to men for money when he was younger. He confessed to killing his victims and sounded not the least bit remorseful, Fishman said. \u201cOne of the questions that I had for him was, \u2018Why not me?\u2019 And that feels like a really bizarre question to ask. But I did. And he basically shrugged and said, \u2018I thought you were too big,\u2019\u201d Fishman said. Fishman\u2019s paper published his interview with Carr. But as Fishman grew up, got married and became a dad, he started rethinking the tone of his coverage. \u201cAn interview with a serial killer was a big story. It was a big journalism scoop that really kind of sent me on the path to be a journalist. And yet, it was a story that I didn\u2019t really like to think about because I did it when I was 19 and 20, and I was really afraid of what my focus had been,\u201d Fishman said. Fishman said he believes his friendly conversation with Carr during the ride may have clouded his perspective and humanized the killer a little too much. \u201cI was really afraid that I had gotten the story wrong, that I somehow didn\u2019t understand or appreciate the horror of the story,\u201d he said. \u201cBack then, I looked at it as a societal problem of how do we treat criminals? How do we rehabilitate rapists? And the utter depravation of it kind of slipped by me.\u201d That is partly why Fishman is excavating the story in his podcast. He hopes that by understanding Carr better, he can correct the record from a more mature and nuanced viewpoint. \u201cI\u2019m a father now a few times over. I think about crime and victims differently,\u201d Fishman said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s kind of why I went to look for Donna.\u201d An answer to a decades-long question: \u2018He was just born evil\u2019 After deciding to make the podcast, Fishman sent Donna a Facebook message introducing himself. \u201cShe immediately responded with, \u2018I\u2019ve been wondering what happened to you,\u201d Fishman said. Turns out, Donna had spent her lifetime trying to understand her father. She\u2019d wondered: Did he kill people because he was mentally ill and had no access to psychiatric treatment \u2014 as Fishman had once written? Or was he just an inherently evil person? She\u2019d tried reaching out to Fishman over the years and even had called the Norwich paper. But the decision to be a part of the podcast was not easy. \u201cI was hesitant, because I really have not spoken much about it. Very few people know that part of my life,\u201d she said. \u201cIt took me a little while to make that decision, and then I decided if I was going to do it with anyone, it was going to be Steve.\u201d Donna said she believes her father had manipulated Fishman, like he did with everyone in his life. So she and Fishman agreed to meet at her West Virginia farm to understand the complexities of the story from a new point of view. They looked through boxes stuffed with Carr\u2019s items from prison, including letters Donna had sent him at age 15.\u00a0 \u201cDear Dad, I love you. I\u2019m sorry I haven\u2019t written in so long,\u201d one said. Her father responded with letters urging her to find Jesus. He claimed he had found Jesus, too. But he also sent her sexually suggestive letters, leading her to cut off communication with him. Donna told CNN that she knew her dad was a monster, but she was holding on to the childhood dream of having a nuclear family. In between her flashes of terror and anger, there were happy memories of family camping trips and the Christmas when her father unwrapped a large stereo he\u2019d bought for the family. Donna said the inappropriate letters from her father finally gave her the strength to severe ties with him. But they were so unnerving that she said she constantly called the prison to make sure he had not been released on parole. One day in the summer of 2007 she found out he was no longer listed as being in prison and had a brief moment of panic, thinking he\u2019d been set free. But a call to the prison confirmed that her father had died of prostate cancer. He was 63. Only after his death did her sense of peace slowly start creeping back. Donna said that despite her initial reluctance, working on the podcast has been a therapeutic experience that has given her a better sense of who her father was. \u201cAs many diagnoses as my father had as far as his mental state \u2014 and there were a lot \u2014 I believe he was just born evil,\u201d she said. She\u2019s in counseling and hopes to keep making steps toward healing. \u201cI kept everything boxed in for so many years. I would just push everything down,\u201d she said. \u00a0\u201cIt was nice to finally talk about it freely.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/07/us/hitchhiker-serial-killer-daughter-podcast-cec/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/10/2024", "section": "us"}}

The recently discovered five musket balls will be on display at the park Saturday. The fighting that led to the birth of the United States began that 1775 day with a short skirmish in Lexington, Massachusetts, in which eight militia members were killed and 10 were wounded. The British continued to move to Concord to search a home for military supplies, leaving a contingent of about 100 soldiers at the North Bridge. As militia members approached, shots were fired by the British troops. Historians say 18 men were killed or wounded in the battle at the bridge. The fighting that day at Lexington, Concord and other sites took the lives of more than 120 people.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/09/us/revolutionary-war-first-day-musket-balls-found/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/10/2024", "section": "us"}}

{"id": "2024_07_09_business_fifth-third-bank-penalties-repossessing-autos-insurance", "text": "Fifth Third Bank on Tuesday said it agreed to pay $20 million in penalties imposed by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to settle a CFPB investigation into its auto insurance practices, and a 2020 lawsuit the agency filed pertaining to the bank\u2019s creation of fake customer accounts. The CFPB said it was imposing penalties on the bank for illegally charging customers for unnecessary auto insurance policies. It estimates the practice harmed more than 35,000 customers and resulted in vehicle repossession for more than 1,000 of them. \u201cFifth Third Bank demanded borrowers pay for coverage they did not need or else face delinquency, additional fees and repossessions,\u201d the agency said in a statement. \u201cFifth Third Bank conducted repossessions of vehicles when the delinquency was caused by the bank charging unnecessary and duplicative coverage.\u201d The bank, which is based in Cincinnati, Ohio, operates branches in 12 states, primarily in the Midwest and Southeast. For its illegal auto insurance activities, the bank must pay $5 million in redress to affected customers, the CFPB said. And the agency is ordering the bank \u201cto clean up these broken business practices or else face further consequences,\u201d CFPB director Rohit Chopra noted. In addition, CFPB said Tuesday that it had filed a proposed court order that would require the bank to pay $15 million in penalties pertaining to practices that incentivized employees to create fake customer accounts. The proposed order also bans Fifth Third \u201cfrom setting employee sales goals that incentivize fraudulently opening accounts,\u201d CFPB said. \u201cToday\u2019s settlement concludes both the sales practices litigation with the CFPB, and its separate investigation into certain auto finance servicing activities related to a collateral protection insurance program that the Bank shut down in 2019 before the CFPB began its investigation,\u201d said Susan Zaunbrecher, chief legal officer of Fifth Third. \u201cWe have already taken significant action to address these legacy matters, including identifying issues and taking the initiative to set things right. We consistently put our customers at the center of everything we do.\u201d Penalties will be paid into CFPB\u2019s victim relief fund.

Keshawn Dixon, 18, was arrested on Saturday in Killeen, Texas, and taken to the Bell County Jail, according to a\u00a0statement from the Round Rock Police Department. Dixon faces a charge of deadly conduct, a third-degree felony, according to the police department. Additional charges are possible, police said. \u201cThe investigation is ongoing, and the Round Rock Police Department continues to pursue leads involving additional suspects,\u201d the police department said. The deadly shooting took place on June 15 at Old Settlers Park during Round Rock\u2019s Juneteenth Festival. On the celebratory night that featured musical performances, an altercation broke out between two groups, and \u201cseveral subjects\u201d pulled out guns and shot at each other, Round Rock Police Chief Allen Banks said at the time. A large crowd was at the event at the time and \u201cmultiple victims were hit,\u201d the chief said at an earlier news conference. Lyndsey Vicknair, a 33-year-old from Manor, and Ara Duke, a 54-year-old from Pflugerville, were killed, police said. Neither was involved in the altercation. \u201cOur hearts are heavy as we mourn the tragic loss of innocent lives and the injuries sustained by several others in Saturday\u2019s senseless act of violence. Our deepest condolences go out to the families affected by this tragedy,\u201d Banks said following the shooting. Days after the shooting, Ricky Thompson III,\u00a017, became the first suspect to be arrested in connection to the incident. He was taken into custody on suspicion of\u00a0aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, according to police. A juvenile suspect, who has not been identified, was later also taken into custody and taken to the Williamson County Juvenile Justice Center. \u201cWe are committed to ensuring the safety and well-being of our community and will work tirelessly to bring those responsible to justice. Together, we will stand strong and support one another during this difficult time for our community,\u201d Banks said. The holiday shooting is one of 277 mass shootings in the US so far this year, according to the\u00a0Gun Violence Archive. Like CNN, the Gun Violence Archive defines a mass shooting as where four or more people are shot, excluding the shooter. \u201cIt breaks your heart for a family that was coming out to enjoy their evening and now their life is forever changed as a result of somebody who could care less about somebody else\u2019s life and that\u2019s so disappointing,\u201d Banks said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/07/us/suspect-arrested-shooting-round-rock-texas-juneteenth/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/10/2024", "section": "us"}}

Last year, Biden asked Stoltenberg to extend his tenure as NATO secretary general an additional year, citing Russia\u2019s ongoing war in Ukraine. The former Norwegian prime minister has served in the role since 2014. Former Dutch Prime Minister\u00a0Mark Rutte\u00a0was formally selected as the next NATO secretary general in late June and will begin the job on October 1. \u201cI realized \u2013 I was talking to your wife, I personally asked you to extend your service, forgive me, that you put your own plans on hold. When the Russian war in Ukraine began, you didn\u2019t hesitate,\u201d Biden told Stoltenberg Tuesday. \u201cToday, NATO is stronger, smarter, more energized than when you began. A billion people across Europe and North America \u2013 indeed the whole world \u2013 will reap the rewards of your labor for years to come.\u201d Biden, himself a recipient of the medal when he was vice president to Barack Obama, most recently awarded the Medal of Freedom to 19 Americans spanning decades of accomplishments in athletics, politics and civil rights. Biden honored Stoltenberg with the medal at the conclusion of his closely watched speech to open the summit, during which the president announced that NATO would be donating new air defense systems to Ukraine. During his own remarks earlier in the event, Stoltenberg urged members of the alliance to continue their support for Ukraine. \u201cOur alliance was created by people who had lived through two devastating world wars,\u201d Stoltenberg said, \u201cThey knew only too well the horror, the suffering, and the terrible human cost of war.\u201d \u201cRussia\u2019s war against Ukraine is the biggest security crisis in generations,\u201d he said, \u201cUkraine has showed remarkable courage and NATO allies have provided unprecedented support.\u201d \u201cThe reality is there are no cost-free options with an aggressive Russia as a neighbor. There are no risk-free options in a war,\u201d he said, \u201cRemember - the biggest cost and the greatest risk will be if Russia wins in Ukraine. We cannot let that happen.\u201d Biden\u2019s decision to award the honor was not part of the announced program, though the president did appear to accidentally read stage instructions from his prepared remarks. \u201cAsk the military,\u201d Biden said, before correcting himself. \u201cMilitary come forward \u2013 I\u2019ll ask you to read the citation.\u201d Biden is expected to give a solo news conference as part of the NATO summit on Thursday.

Dvontaye Mitchell, 43, was at the downtown Hyatt Regency in Milwaukee on June 30, where police allege he \u201ccaused a disturbance,\u201d prompting security guards to escort him out of the hotel, a statement from Mitchell family attorney Ben Crump said. Part of a video posted on social media shows four security guards pinning Mitchell to the ground. In the video, Mitchell can be heard grunting and pleading with the guards, repeatedly saying \u201cplease\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d One of the guards, who appears to be White, can be heard saying \u201cstay down,\u201d and \u201cstop fighting,\u201d as the others, who appear to be people of color, hold Mitchell down. The same guard is heard calling out to witnesses, \u201cThis is what happens when you go into the ladies room.\u201d It\u2019s unclear what led up to Mitchell\u2019s encounter with the security guards, how long it took police officers to arrive on the scene, and what Mitchell was doing at the hotel. When officers arrived, Mitchell was unresponsive and pronounced dead despite lifesaving measures that were taken, Milwaukee Police told CNN on Tuesday without mentioning Mitchell by name. The preliminary manner of death for Mitchell is homicide, Karen Domagalski from the Milwaukee County Medical Examiner\u2019s Office told CNN on Tuesday, but the final manner is yet to be determined. \u201cThe cause and manner of death is pending toxicology and further investigation, Domagalski said. \u201cWe do not have a timeline for when this case will be finalized.\u201d The encounter comes as the use of force\u00a0\u2013 particularly\u00a0against people of color\u00a0\u2013\u00a0by police and others in authority roles remains under scrutiny nearly four years after protests flared nationwide following the murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer. Now, every time Mitchell\u2019s children turn on the TV, they are reminded of how their father died, DeAsia Harmon, Mitchell\u2019s widow, told CNN affiliate WTMJ on Monday. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t even go into the grocery store with my daughter without her being afraid of the security standing at the door,\u201d Harmon said. \u201cShe said, \u2018is all security bad or just the ones who murdered my dad.\u2019\u201d The security guards involved in the incident have been suspended. Aimbridge Hospitality, which operates the downtown Hyatt Regency Milwaukee, is still completing its investigation, a Hyatt spokesperson told CNN on Monday. \u201cWe extend our heartfelt condolences to Dvontaye Mitchell\u2019s family, all those who knew and loved him, and the Milwaukee community in light of this tragedy,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cAs the investigation continues, Hyatt is fully committed to supporting efforts to help ensure accountability for the circumstances that led to the death of Dvontaye Mitchell.\u201d Milwaukee Police are not considering the incident as a criminal investigation because there isn\u2019t any evidence of \u201cblunt force,\u201d according to Crump. \u201cIt is unacceptable that this case is not being considered a criminal investigation despite the fatal outcome, which the medical examiner considers a homicide,\u201d Crump said. The case is pending further investigation and there\u2019s no timeline for a charging decision at the moment, the Milwaukee\u00a0County\u00a0District Attorney\u2019s office told CNN on Tuesday. \u2018To know him is to love him\u2019 Mitchell\u2019s mother, Brenda Giles, said her eldest son was a jolly, outgoing, brother, uncle and father who loved his family, she told WTMJ. \u201cEverybody that knows him, to know him is to love him, they know,\u201d his sister, Nayisha Mitchell told the station. \u201cThey knew he was a good person.\u201d When Mitchell\u2019s father passed away in 2016, Mitchell fell into depression, his family told WTMJ. Giles believes her son was suffering from a mental health episode at the time of the incident, according to Crump. Shawn Moore, a witness who recorded parts of the interaction, told WTMJ he wishes he had done more. \u201cWhat I ended up capturing was another Black man in Milwaukee dealing with mental issues losing his life over nothing,\u201d he said. Family and friends held a vigil for Mitchell over the weekend outside the downtown Hyatt Regency echoing similar sentiments of calls for justice.

Alvin Bragg\u2019s\u00a0office is working with alleged victims whose claims of forcible rape and sexual abuse against the 72-year-old\u00a0disgraced\u00a0former Hollywood producer still fall within the statute of limitations, prosecutor Nicole Blumberg told the court. Blumberg said prosecutors could realistically go to trial in November against Weinstein,\u00a0whose downfall over similar claims became a symbol of the #MeToo movement. Some of the alleged victims had been not willing to participate in the legal process at the time of Weinstein\u2019s first trial, the prosecutor said. \u201cAs we said in 2020, some women were not ready. These women are now ready,\u201d Blumberg said The New York Court of Appeals\u00a0ruled this year\u00a0that the testimony of \u201cprior bad acts\u201d witnesses should not have been allowed in the trial that led to Weinstein\u2019s 2020 conviction of first-degree criminal sexual act and third-degree rape because it \u201cwas unnecessary to establish defendant\u2019s intent and served only to establish defendant\u2019s propensity to commit the crimes charged.\u201d He was sentenced to\u00a023 years in prison\u00a0and has maintained his innocence and denied any nonconsensual sexual activity. Prosecutors in New York had in May indicated their plans to seek a new indictment but said Tuesday they have yet to do so. Weinstein\u2019s lawyers must be notified when that happens because the defense team plans to present a case to the grand jury that might include testimony from Weinstein himself. Defense attorney Arthur Aidala accused the DA\u2019s office of delaying tactics at the hearing, telling state Judge Curtis Farber, \u201cThey have a defendant and they\u2019re out there looking for a crime.\u201d Aidala said Weinstein is \u201cbegging\u201d his attorneys to get this matter done quickly and wants to go to trial in September as initially discussed at the first hearing after Weinstein\u2019s 2020 conviction was vacated by New York\u2019s highest court. He\u00a0has remained behind bars because he was sentenced last year in Los Angeles to\u00a016 years in prison on charges\u00a0of rape and sexual assault \u2013 a trial that similarly used \u201cprior bad acts\u201d witnesses and has also been appealed. The defense attorney said Tuesday that Weinstein is suffering in solitary confinement at Rikers Island after being removed from a hospital setting. According to his lawyer, Weinstein is not getting any treatment for his health issues, including fluid in his heart and his lungs, Spinal Stenosis, macular degeneration in his eyes and diabetes. CNN has reached out to Rikers and the Bureau of Prisons on his claims. Weinstein\u2019s attorneys have consented to Weinstein remaining in custody in New York pending the retrial despite his vacated conviction because he could alternatively be transferred to California to serve a prison sentence for his rape conviction there.

{"id": "2024_07_09_business_fed-chair-powell-talks-up-progress-on-inflation-but-says-rate-cuts-not-imminent-yet", "text": "Inflation has come a long way since reaching a four-decade peak two years ago, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Tuesday. However, central bank officials still want to see more progress before cutting interest rates, he noted, though they are also keeping a close eye on the job market. \u201cWe do not expect it will be appropriate to reduce the target range for the federal funds rate until we have gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2%,\u201d Powell said in prepared testimony submitted to congressional lawmakers. During the hearing, Powell didn\u2019t specify that cutting this year remains likely, or give any hint about the timing of the first rate cut, which is a departure from previous comments he\u2019s made. \u201cThe most recent inflation readings, however, have shown some modest further progress, and more good data would strengthen our confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2%,\u201d he added. Powell appeared Tuesday before the Senate Banking Committee to deliver his semiannual monetary policy report to Congress. He heads to the House Financial Services Committee on Wednesday to address the same report on the state of the US economy. The Fed\u2019s key interest rate, which influences borrowing costs across the economy, has been at a 23-year high for about a year now, after the central bank aggressively lifted rates to bring down inflation. While the pace of price hikes slowed dramatically in 2023, it hit a snag early this year, which pushed back the timing of the first anticipated rate cut. Fed officials expect to cut interest rates just once this year, according to their latest economic projections in June, compared to the three cuts they forecast in March. Inflation resumed a downward trend in the spring, but officials appear to be in lockstep saying they need more evidence that inflation is truly headed toward their 2% goal. In June, consumer prices didn\u2019t rise on a monthly basis for the first time since November, according to the Fed\u2019s favorite inflation gauge, the Personal Consumption Expenditures price index. The annual PCE inflation rate registered at 2.6% in June, down slightly from 2.7% in May. \u201cInflation is now around 2-and-a-half percent, so we have seen significant progress in bringing it down,\u201d New York Fed President John Williams said last week at an event in India. \u201cBut we still have a way to go to reach our 2% target on a sustained basis.\u201d But inflation isn\u2019t the only thing the Fed is watching as it mulls when to begin cutting interest rates. The Fed is watching America\u2019s long-robust job market closely after it has shown signs of cooling. That comes as US consumers show signs of pulling back after years of elevated inflation and a sharp rise in interest rates, according to the latest spending data and remarks from retailers. Here are key takeaways from Powell\u2019s hearing before the Senate Banking Committee. Powell says the labor market is back to normal \u2014 but there are still risks The Fed\u2019s top leader told senators that America\u2019s job market now looks similar to the way it did before the Covid-19 pandemic: \u201cstrong, but not overheated.\u201d The US job market rebounded mightily after a brief, pandemic-induced recession in 2020, and it has continued to expand ever since. But it has loosened a little recently: The unemployment rate last month crept up to its highest level in more than two years, and new applications for unemployment benefits have trended up in recent weeks. \u201cI\u2019m concerned that if the Fed waits too long to lower rates, the Fed could undo the progress we\u2019ve made in creating good-paying jobs,\u201d\u00a0Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio, who chairs the Senate Banking Committee, said during the hearing. The US job market is still a pillar of strength for the broader economy but it\u2019s not running at the same red-hot pace of a few years ago. The unemployment rate edged higher, to 4.1%, in June, the highest rate since November 2021, though employers have continued to hire at a brisk pace. The gap between job openings and the number of unemployed people seeking work, a measure of how tight the labor market is, has narrowed markedly over the past year. Powell expressed throughout the hearing that the Fed is fully aware that it is dealing with \u201ctwo-sided risks\u201d \u2014 one is of inflation heating back up because the central bank cut rates too soon, and the other is of the labor market weakening sharply because the Fed waited too long to cut rates. Both risks would result in consequences for Americans and the overall US economy. The Fed is tasked by Congress to both stabilize prices and maximize employment, and it balances its focus on either goal depending on the economic circumstances at the time. For a few years, the Fed has focused more on its inflation side of its dual mandate, but that has shifted recently. \u201cIf we see that the labor market were weakening unexpectedly, which is to say more than what we\u2019ve seen in a material way unexpectedly,\u201d Powell said, \u201cthen we could also respond to that, because we have a dual mandate and we now see the two mandates more in balance than they were a year ago.\u201d America\u2019s economic engine, consumer spending, has started to show some cracks. Sales at US retailers have consistently come in weaker than expected for the past few months and retailers have sounded the alarm on shoppers across the income spectrum trading down for cheaper alternatives. Recent surveys of service-providing businesses in the United States have shown that consumer demand so far this summer has been tepid, a stark contrast to last year when Americans splurged. Put together, the recent spate of economic data help build a case for the Fed to begin lowering borrowing costs. Senators talk financial regulation The Fed chief told lawmakers that a proposed set of banking regulations will likely be revised and re-proposed \u2014 a topic Republicans repeatedly brought up with Powell. Meanwhile, some Democrats talked about rules over compensation for Wall Street executives. The Fed is one of the country\u2019s key banking regulators, in addition to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. In the aftermath of the Great Recession, banking authorities around the world convened in Basel, Switzerland, to develop global standards for banks to fortify financial stability. Those rules are still in the process of being adopted and implemented. The final phase of these banking rules is known as Basel III Endgame, and it calls on raising the amount of capital that the largest banks hold to protect themselves against risks. The Fed\u2019s latest so-called \u201cstress test,\u201d which is a simulation of how major banks would fare in tough economic conditions, showed that all 31 banks tested would survive and still be able to lend credit. But they took a bigger financial hit\u00a0than last year. When the Basel III Endgame was proposed last year, bank interest groups\u00a0and lawmakers from both sides of the aisle\u00a0pushed back, saying that banks needing to beef up capital\u00a0beyond what\u2019s currently required\u00a0would undermine their ability to lend. Powell said Tuesday a \u201cstrongly held view of the members of the board is that we do need to put a revised proposal out for comment for some period.\u201d It\u2019s unclear what changes a new proposal would specifically have. Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts grilled Powell over a long-delayed rule that aims to restrain reckless behavior on Wall Street tied to incentive-based pay for executives, known as Section 956 of the Dodd\u2013Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act passed in 2010. Several regulators, including the Fed, need to figure out how to implement the rule first, but reaching a consensus among them is typically a challenge, especially considering intense lobbying efforts. \u201cThe Fed has refused to join the other financial regulators in finalizing a rule implementing Section 956 as Congress directed,\u201d Warren said. She pointed to a comment that Powell made in the past that he wants to see evidence of the problem that Section 956 would solve. Powell said that he \u201cnever said trust the banks to regulate themselves.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/09/business/fed-chair-powell-talks-up-progress-on-inflation-but-says-rate-cuts-not-imminent-yet/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/10/2024", "section": "us"}}

Officers were dispatched to the location after receiving a call from a bystander alerting them there were children inside a vehicle that was turned off, the San Antonio Police Department\u00a0said in its preliminary report. First responders discovered a 1-month-old, 2-year-old, and 4-year-old in the car. \u201cThe mother of the children (suspect) was at the scene and stated she went inside a store and did not realize how long she was gone,\u201d the department said. \u201cBased on information gathered, the children were in the car for approximately 50 minutes.\u201d Angela Garza\u2013Amador was arrested June 28 and charged with three counts of abandoning/endangering a child, according to the report. She was released on bond June 29, according to the Bexar County Sheriff\u2019s Office. It is unclear if Garza\u2013Amador has legal representation. A woman who rescued the children and took a video of the moment told CNN affiliate KENS she was walking toward a children\u2019s clothing store when she noticed a young boy in the car next to her. She said she felt her \u201cmother\u2019s instincts\u201d and decided to looked inside and found another child in the car and alerted store employees to call 911. She then tried to open the car door and found it unlocked and helped the children while waiting for first responders to arrive. \u201cThe boy, he was really sweating profusely, and you know, was crying. It seemed like he was grasping for air to me, like they were already on that verge,\u201d the woman, who wanted to remain anonymous, told KENS. \u201cA lot of parents think, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s OK, I\u2019ll be right back,\u2019 but so much can happen in that time frame.\u201d In the video, at least three women can be seen helping get the three children out of the car, including a baby from its car seat, as the three-year-old boy cries while struggling to breathe. \u201cI live across town, I hadn\u2019t been there to that store I was going to in 10 years,\u201d she added. \u201cI feel that God literally sent me over there for those kids.\u201d The temperature in the San Antonio area at the time was between 98 and 100 degrees.

{"id": "2024_07_09_tech_ftc-ngl-anonymous-messaging-app-teens", "text": "The Federal Trade Commission and the Los Angeles District Attorney\u2019s Office have banned a controversial anonymous messaging app from serving kids under 18, taking an unprecedented and aggressive step against what regulators called \u201crampant cyberbullying and threats against children and teens\u201d on the platform. The targeted ban is the FTC\u2019s latest move in a wider crackdown on social media companies, data brokers and other businesses that allegedly mishandle consumer data or make overhyped claims about artificial intelligence. As part of a\u00a0lawsuit\u00a0and\u00a0settlement\u00a0announced Tuesday, the app being penalized \u2014 known as NGL \u2014 will also pay $5 million to settle what FTC Chair Lina Khan said was \u201creckless disregard for kids\u2019 safety.\u201d The app will also have to implement an age gate to block its services to current and new users who are under 18 years old. The regulators wrote that the app billed itself as a \u201csafe space\u201d for teens but, in reality, preyed on them. In addition to highlighting FTC follow-through on\u00a0earlier promises to police AI hype, the lawsuit directly names the company\u2019s co-founders, reflecting recent agency commitments to\u00a0holding individual executives accountable\u00a0for corporate wrongdoing. The app, known as NGL, had been downloaded millions of times, according to the complaint. NGL is an internet abbreviation for \u201cnot gonna lie.\u201d NGL actively marketed itself to young users and violated federal laws aimed at protecting children\u2019s data, the lawsuit claimed, while its employees allegedly mocked paying users as \u201csuckers\u201d while profiting from their ignorance. In a statement, NGL co-founder Joao Figueiredo said the company had spent nearly two years cooperating with the FTC\u2019s investigation but that it disputes the agency\u2019s findings, which were approved unanimously by the five-member commission. NGL responds \u201cWe view this resolution as an opportunity to make NGL better than ever for our users and we think the agreement is in our best interest,\u201d Figueiredo said. \u201cWhile we believe many of the allegations around the youth of our user base are factually incorrect, we anticipate that the agreed upon age-gating and other procedures will now provide direction for others in our space, and hopefully improve policies generally.\u201d The settlement must still be approved by the US District Court for the Central District of California before taking effect. NGL deceptively hooked teens into subscribing to its premium service by sending them fake, anonymous messages and then promising to reveal the sender after they paid, said the complaint. The computer-generated messages were purposely written to prey on teens\u2019 social anxieties or aspirations, the lawsuit said, citing examples such as \u201cI know what you did\u201d and \u201cI\u2019ve had a crush on you for years.\u201d NGL created more than 1,000 different such messages posing as real users and sent them millions of times\u00a0to persuade teens to pay to see who sent them, the complaint said. But when users paid for information about both the fake and the real messages, sometimes as much as $9.99 a week, the app didn\u2019t show the sender\u2019s name but instead provided \u201chints\u201d such as the user\u2019s rough location or the type of device being used, according to the lawsuit. The messages started being sent in 2022, a year after the app\u2019s lackluster launch, the complaint said. After users began suspecting the fake messages, many wrote negative reviews of the app and some even called it a scam, according to the lawsuit. NGL had allegedly boasted in its marketing that the app was a \u201csafe space for teens\u201d and that it used AI-based content moderation to protect users. Behind the scenes, however, the app\u2019s co-founders allegedly ignored or denigrated users who complained, with Figueiredo responding \u201clol\u201d in an internal message to a report about one upset customer, according to the lawsuit. The lawsuit and settlement are another example of how Khan, a vocal critic of the tech industry, has made regulating digital data a hallmark of her tenure. In addition to\u00a0warning\u00a0that generative artificial intelligence may \u201cturbocharge\u201d fraud and scams, Khan has proposed multiple regulations that would clamp down on how businesses may collect, use and share consumer data. One would crack down on what she calls a \u201ccommercial surveillance\u201d industry, while another seeks to\u00a0expand the FTC\u2019s enforcement\u00a0of a landmark children\u2019s privacy law. The FTC is also currently\u00a0seeking to prohibit Meta\u00a0from monetizing children\u2019s data, a move that company has challenged in court. In 2022, the FTC\u00a0forced Epic Games, maker of the hit video game \u201cFortnite,\u201d to pay $520 million to settle allegations that it used sneaky user-interface tricks known as \u201cdark patterns\u201d to dupe users into making in-game purchases. Rising ire from regulators The FTC move comes against the backdrop of a flurry of state legislation seeking to limit young people\u2019s access to social media. In another first this year, New York\u00a0approved legislation\u00a0that regulates the algorithms powering social media feeds on Facebook, Instagram, TikTok and other apps. States such as\u00a0Arkansas,\u00a0Florida,\u00a0Louisiana\u00a0and many others have also passed laws clamping down on social media companies\u2019 approach to teens. Opponents, however, say the laws violate the First Amendment rights of teens and the Supreme Court has\u00a0agreed to consider\u00a0the constitutionality of age-based website restrictions in its next term. Highlighting the groundbreaking nature of the NGL settlement, FTC Commissioner Andrew Ferguson described Tuesday\u2019s action as a \u201cnovel\u201d use of the agency\u2019s legal powers. For the first time, he said in a statement, the FTC claimed that NGL broke the law \u201cby marketing an anonymous messaging app to children and teenagers despite knowing that anonymous messaging apps are harmful to these groups.\u201d \u201cThis alleged conduct, tailormade to manipulate the vulnerable teenage psyche, was reprehensible and unfair,\u201d Ferguson said. But, he argued, the public should not interpret the lawsuit to mean that it is illegal in general to market any anonymous messaging app to teens. On Tuesday, the FTC credited the consumer advocacy group Fairplay and the social media critic Kristin Bride for \u201cinvaluable assistance\u201d on the NGL investigation. Last year, Bride testified before Congress in a\u00a0high-profile hearing\u00a0about social media\u2019s risks for teens, recounting how her teenage son Carson died by suicide in 2020 after receiving a barrage of anonymous cyberbullying messages. In October, Bride and Fairplay\u00a0wrote to the FTC\u00a0calling for an agency investigation into NGL and accusing it of unfair and deceptive business practices in violation of federal law. In a statement Tuesday, Bride applauded the lawsuit and settlement. \u201cThis dangerous business model keeps kids engaged while struggling to identify their unknown harassers so that these companies can profit from more data collection,\u201d Bride said. \u201cIt is unconscionable that NGL would not only charge vulnerable teens for useless hints as to who was messaging them but that the developers themselves were sending harassing messages to teens and joking about it as parents expressed cyberbullying concerns.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/09/tech/ftc-ngl-anonymous-messaging-app-teens/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/10/2024", "section": "us"}}

Bobb\u2019s attorneys previously argued that the Dominion defamation lawsuit, and the routine deposition they are seeking, should be paused in the wake of her\u00a0indictment in Arizona on charges related to her role in the Trump campaign\u2019s fake electors plot. She denies wrongdoing in both cases. Lawyers for Dominion told a judge Monday that the defamation case should move forward and that they can tailor document requests and deposition questions to steer clear of the specific Arizona allegations. \u201cAny deposition of Ms. Bobb, could and likely would impair Ms. Bobb\u2019s Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination, extend criminal discovery beyond the limits set forth by Arizona law, potentially expose Ms. Bobb\u2019s theory to the prosecution in advance of trial, and otherwise prejudice her criminal case,\u201d Bobb\u2019s criminal attorney in the Arizona case, Thomas Jacobs, said in a past court filing. The voting technology firm\u00a0sued Bobb and the far-right cable network OAN\u00a0in 2021, as well as\u00a0other Trump allies\u00a0and\u00a0right-wing outlets\u00a0that peddled lies about the election. Lawyers for Dominion said a filing Monday that Bobb\u2019s lawyers didn\u2019t answer their emails in March and May when they tried to schedule Bobb\u2019s deposition. \u201cBobb has not produced a single document in this litigation, and simply ignored Dominion\u2019s attempts to schedule a date for her deposition, including attempts made well before the Arizona indictment,\u201d Dominion lawyers wrote, urging the judge in the DC-based case to order Bobb to sit for a deposition. After then-President Donald Trump lost the 2020 election, Bobb used her on-air role at OAN to repeatedly promote baseless conspiracy theories about the results being rigged, including by Dominion software. At the same time,\u00a0she also worked closely\u00a0with Trump\u2019s lawyers and allies to subvert the results in several battleground states that he lost by organizing illegitimate slates of Republican electors. After a shakeup at the RNC earlier this year, Bobb and other Trump loyalists assumed top leadership posts, with Bobb focusing on so-called \u201celection integrity\u201d efforts. These efforts include\u00a0new lawsuits\u00a0aimed at tightening the rules regarding mail-in ballots and restricting the availability of ballot drop boxes.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/09/media/rnc-christina-bobb-deposition-dominion-voting/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/10/2024", "section": "us"}}

The shooter, identified as 28-year-old Samson Lucas Bariah Fussner, died after an exchange of gunfire with law enforcement, the US National Park Service said in a news release Tuesday. The injured park ranger was flown to a nearby regional hospital in stable condition and has since been released, according to the agency. The shooting happened at Canyon Village, a cluster of lodges and cabins inside the park, north of Yellowstone Lake and away from the park\u2019s busiest tourist areas. Yellowstone\u2019s 911 dispatch center received a call just after midnight on July 4 reporting that a woman had been held against her will by an armed man in a residence at the village, the park service said. The woman also told law enforcement rangers Fussner \u201cthreatened to kill her and others, including plans to allegedly carry out a mass shooting(s) at July 4th\u00a0events outside the park,\u201d according to the release. Rangers found the suspect\u2019s vehicle unoccupied in the Canyon area and determined he was likely armed and dangerous, the release said. \u201cWith the individual\u202fat large,\u202flaw enforcement rangers were strategically deployed to protect areas with park visitors and employees while searching for Fussner, and the park\u2019s 911 dispatch center notified surrounding jurisdictions,\u201d according to the National Park Service. By the early morning hours that day, more than 20 rangers were searching for Fussner and working to protect people in the park, the agency said. At around 8 a.m., rangers stationed near the Canyon Lodge dining facility located Fussner as he walked toward the service entrance while firing a semi-automatic rifle, according to the release. Roughly 200 people were inside the building as several rangers exchanged gunfire with Fussner, who was shot and died at the scene, authorities said. Fussner \u2013 of Milton, Florida \u2013 was employed by Xanterra Parks and Resorts, a private business authorized to operate in Yellowstone, the release stated. The FBI is leading the investigation into the incident, the park service said, and will be reviewed by the United States Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of Wyoming. The park service is also working with the FBI to offer victim and witness support. The law enforcement rangers who were involved in the shooting have been placed on paid administrative leave while the incident is investigated, in accordance with park service policy, the agency said.

{"id": "2024_07_08_us_chicago-shootings-july-fourth-weekend", "text": "Gun violence is down across America this year but it peaks every summer and Chicago\u2019s Fourth of July weekend bore the data out, with 109 people shot, including 19 fatally, police said in a Monday news conference. All of the victims were boys and men ranging in age from 16 to 36 years old, according to police records. This year\u2019s violent holiday weekend comes as the city and the nation have seen a drop in gun violence in recent years. As of June 24, Chicago had seen 1,105 shooting incidents so far this year, a 6% reduction from the same time last year and a 12% reduction over the past two years. The city had seen 271 gun deaths as of June 24, a 12% reduction since the same time last year and 16% reduction of the past two years, according to data from the Chicago Police Department. Last year over the long holiday weekend, 57 people were shot and eight were killed between Friday, June 30 at 6 p.m. and Tuesday, July 4 at 11:59 p.m., according to Chicago police. July 4 is the peak day for mass shootings in the US, more than any other single calendar day over roughly a decade, a 2023 CNN analysis of the Gun Violence Archive\u2019s mass shooting data since 2014\u00a0found. The day with the second most shootings was July 5. Gun violence is a \u2018societal issue\u2019 In the United States, law enforcement statistics and independent researchers have continually pointed to summer months as a time of increased gun violence, with July 1-7 being an especially violent period each year for both mass shootings and individual incidents. Heat, experts say, can elevate discomfort and aggression\u00a0\u2013 a potential catalyst for violence at a time\u00a0kids are out of school\u00a0and warmer weather drives\u00a0more people outdoors\u00a0in a country with\u00a0more guns than people. \u201cWhen we look at what happened this weekend, we always like to say that it\u2019s a police issue,\u201d Chicago Police Department Superintendent Larry Snelling said at the news conference. \u201cThis is a societal issue. The police cannot be in everybody\u2019s backyard. They cannot be in everyone\u2019s home. They cannot invade every single gathering where there\u2019s a possibility that someone may show up with a gun.\u201d \u201cEveryone needs to be involved in this, this cannot just be the police department alone,\u201d he added. On Friday, after dozens of people had already been shot in Chicago, Mayor Brandon Johnson released a statement addressing the violence. \u201cWe are devastated by the recent violence that has left our city in a state of grief and we extend our heartfelt condolences to the families and communities impacted by these recent events,\u201d Johnson said in the statement. \u201cThe City of Chicago is committed to ensuring the safety of all residents and visitors.\u201d The city had canceled time off for police officers to \u201cmaximize presence and ensure prompt incident response,\u201d activated an emergency services assistance center to provide  support to people in the community and would hold a community rally Friday afternoon to \u201cpromote bonding, support, and healing,\u201d according to Johnson. But the efforts did not end the shootings. Snelling urged public cooperation and tips to lead detectives to suspects, especially those who \u201cmake the choice\u201d to shoot women and children. \u201cThose people have to be taken off the street,\u201d Snelling implored. \u201cThey have to be put away. If we\u2019re not doing that, then we\u2019re failing other families. We\u2019re failing people in our city.\u201d One of those killed over the weekend was an 8-year-old-boy who was shot alongside two other boys, ages 5 and 8, according to the Chicago Police Department\u2019s online records. Several 15- to 16-year-olds were also among those shot over the weekend, police say. In another instance, eight people between the ages of 18 and 74 suffered gunshot wounds and in a separate incident, seven people aged 15 to 40 years old were shot. The 40-year-old died, according to the police department. Officers are training for the upcoming Democratic National Convention next month to be better prepared for potential protests or civil unrest, Snelling said. \u201cAlong with that, we have been working on a neighborhood plan to make sure that we\u2019re not pulling resources that are necessary to keep our neighborhoods safe to place down and around the footprint of the DNC,\u201d he said. \u201cGenerations of disinvestment and deep disenfranchisement\u201d have led to the state of violence within the city, Johnson said during Monday\u2019s news conference. He is pushing for more federal resources to increase intervention and prevention of gun violence, including \u201cmore boots on the ground\u201d to help get illegal guns off the streets. \u201cWe are going block to block, neighborhood by neighborhood, to make sure that the city is safe and ultimately stop this violence,\u201d said Johnson. \u201cThese are not just numbers on pages.

The filing seeks an order from the court that would prevent the state from\u00a0requiring public schools to\u00a0display\u00a0posters of the\u00a0Ten Commandments in all classrooms or implementing any other statute from the new law. That\u00a0lawsuit,\u00a0filed last month in federal\u00a0court, contends that the legislation\u00a0violates both US Supreme Court precedent and the First Amendment. House Bill 71, signed by Republican Gov. Jeff Landry in June, mandates that by January 1, 2025, a poster-sized display of a state-approved version of the Ten Commandments with \u201clarge, easily readable font\u201d be put in every classroom from kindergarten through the university-level at state-funded schools. Last month, Oklahoma State Superintendent of Public Instruction Ryan Walters issued a memo requiring that schools in the state incorporate the Bible and the Ten Commandments into their curriculum, calling the Bible an \u201cindispensable historical and cultural touchstone.\u201d The memo came after the state\u2019s Supreme Court blocked an effort to establish the first publicly funded religious charger school in the country, CNN previously reported. Plaintiffs in the Louisiana lawsuit argued mandating that the Ten Commandments be displayed in every classroom renders them \u201cunavoidable\u201d and \u201cunconstitutionally pressures students into religious observance, veneration, and adoption of the state\u2019s favored religious scripture.\u201d \u201cIt also sends the harmful and religiously divisive message that students who do not subscribe to the Ten Commandments \u2014 or, more precisely, to the specific version of the Ten Commandments that H.B. 71 requires schools to display \u2014 do not belong in their own school community and should refrain from expressing any faith practices of beliefs that are not aligned with the state\u2019s religious preferences,\u201d the complaint continues. The lawsuit\u00a0was\u00a0brought by the American Civil Liberties Union, the ACLU of Louisiana, Americans United for Separation of Church and State, and the Freedom From Religion Foundation,\u00a0on behalf of nine \u201cmulti-faith families\u201d with students enrolled in Louisiana public schools. It names state Superintendent of Education Cade Brumley, several other Louisiana State Board of Elementary and Secondary Education officials, and some local school boards. When asked about the lawsuit, Brumley told CNN in a statement last month that he looked forward to implementing the law. \u201cThe Ten Commandments law passed with overwhelming support in Louisiana\u2019s state legislature and was enthusiastically signed by our Governor,\u201d he said. \u201cI look forward to implementing the law and defending Louisiana\u2019s sovereign interest to select classroom content fundamental to America\u2019s foundation.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/08/us/louisiana-ten-commandments-plaintiffs-lawsuit-reaj/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/10/2024", "section": "us"}}

Officers found seven victims suffering from gunshot wounds shortly before 3 a.m. after receiving calls of an active shooter at a home on Ridgecrest Drive in Florence, southwest of Cincinnati, Ohio, Florence Police Department Chief Jeff Mallery said during a Saturday afternoon news conference. Mallery identified the four gunshot victims as Shane Miller, 20; Hayden Rybicki, 20; Delaney Eary, 19; and Melissa Parrett, 44. Parrett, the homeowner, was hosting her son\u2019s 21st birthday party when the shooting occurred, Mallery said. Police identified Chase Garvey, 21, as the suspect and say he was not invited to the party but was known by the people in attendance. Three of the victims were transported to a hospital in Cincinnati and are listed in critical but stable condition, according to a statement by police. Garvey initially fled the scene and police say he was discovered a short time later in a crashed vehicle with an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound. Police said Garvey was transported to a hospital, where he was later pronounced dead. The shooter\u2019s motive is unclear, and Garvey acted alone, authorities say. \u201cWe\u2019ve never dealt with this before.

Officials say there is no ongoing threat to the public and the investigation remains ongoing. The shooting is the 277th mass shooting to occur in the United States in 2024, according to data from the Gun Violence Archive.
