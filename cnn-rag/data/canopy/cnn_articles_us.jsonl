{"id": "2024_07_12_politics_bob-menendez-jury-corruption-trial", "text": "The jury in the federal corruption trial against Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez of New Jersey and his co-defendants began deliberations Friday after hearing from 37 witnesses over nine weeks of testimony. Jurors were dismissed for the day after deliberating for approximately\u00a0three hours Friday and are expected to return to Manhattan criminal court at 9:30 a.m. ET on Monday to continue their deliberations. Menendez and his co-defendants, New Jersey businessmen Wael Hana and Fred Daibes, are accused of participating in a yearslong bribery scheme. Prosecutors say the senator tried to use his power to advance Egyptian military interests, interfere in criminal prosecutions and secure investment from Qatari officials, among other things. Menendez and his wife allegedly received gold bars, hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash, a Mercedes Benz convertible and other bribes in exchange for his influence. The senator\u2019s wife, Nadine Menendez, was also charged in the case, but will be tried separately later this year after she was granted a delay by the judge so she can focus on her treatment for breast cancer.\u00a0She has pleaded not guilty. Bob Menendez faces 16 counts \u2013 including bribery, extortion, wire fraud, obstruction of justice and acting as a foreign agent \u2013 for his alleged role in the scheme. The senator has denied any wrongdoing and accused prosecutors of targeting him. He did not take the stand in his own defense during the trial. Prosecutors spent nearly seven weeks untangling the multiple corruption schemes that they allege Bob and Nadine Menendez and the co-defendants were involved in. Federal prosecutors structured their case by chapters, calling witnesses to testify about separate schemes allegedly brokered by the senator in tandem with his wife. According to evidence presented by prosecutors in court, the schemes involved Hana, Daibes and another co-conspirator, Jose Uribe, the New Jersey businessman who allegedly bribed the senator in exchange for legal favors. Uribe struck a plea deal ahead of the trial. Bob Menendez\u2019s attorneys consistently suggested in cross-examinations that the senator was not aware of the deals his wife struck with the co-defendants, which included offering the senator\u2019s influence for a price. Prosecutors alleged that Nadine Menendez was an intermediary for communications between the co-conspirators and her willing husband. During the trial, the senator\u2019s lawyers called five witnesses, including his sister, sister-in-law and the attorney for a friend of Uribe. A Menendez lawyer said the senator customarily stored cash due to familial trauma caused by the Cuban communist regime. (Menendez was born in New York City, and Fidel Castro had not yet come to power at the time his family left Cuba). In his closing argument, Menendez\u2019s defense attorney said the lack of evidence in the case against the senator made it \u201cshaky and rotten to its core.\u201d The trial has been largely overshadowed, first by former President Donald Trump\u2019s conviction in a nearby Manhattan criminal court at the end of May and then by the drama surrounding Joe Biden\u2019s political fate. But a verdict in Menendez\u2019s case could have broader consequences \u2013 potentially imperiling Democrats\u2019 narrow Senate majority and throwing New Jersey politics into a new round of disarray. Menendez, who is up for reelection in November, did not run in the Democratic primary this spring. Rep. Andy Kim, of South Jersey, is now the Democratic nominee, but Menendez has floated an independent bid to keep his seat \u2013 if he is acquitted. That could lead to a messy, three-way race in which Kim and Menendez could split the Democratic vote, opening a path for Republican nominee Curtis Bashaw \u2013 a scenario Senate Democrats are desperate to avoid given the many challenges they face in defending their narrow majority.

{"id": "2024_07_12_politics_judge-dismisses-giuliani-bankruptcy-case", "text": "Rudy Giuliani\u00a0is no longer entitled to\u00a0bankruptcy\u00a0protection, a judge decided Friday, making it possible\u00a0for creditors to immediately pursue his assets\u00a0within days. The former mayor of New York sought bankruptcy protection\u00a0after a jury awarded two Georgia election workers $148 million because Giuliani defamed them after the 2020 election. The judge\u2019s decision Friday, to end his bankruptcy, paves the way for\u00a0Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss,\u00a0as well as other creditors, who are trying to collect on the more than $150 million Giuliani owes. Judge Sean Lane of the federal bankruptcy court in New York made the decision partly because of Giuliani\u2019s lack of transparency after he filed for bankruptcy more than six months ago. Lane highlighted in his 22-page opinion that Giuliani hadn\u2019t provided any insight whatsoever into the books of companies he solely owns, and that have taken in thousands of dollars in wire transfers in recent weeks. The judge also said Giuliani hasn\u2019t been fully transparent with his creditors \u2013 such as by not fully explaining on time an upcoming book contract he has, or keeping his personal earnings from a radio show and podcast coming into one of the corporate accounts. \u201cMr. Giuliani has failed to provide an accurate and complete picture of his financial affairs in the six months that this case has been pending,\u201d Lane wrote in his decision Friday. \u201cThe lack of financial transparency is particularly troubling given concerns that Mr. Giuliani has engaged in self-dealing and that he has potential conflicts of interest that would hamper the administration of his bankruptcy case.\u201d Giuliani \u2013 once Time magazine\u2019s Person of the Year and a fixture in New York society \u2013\u00a0says he is now worth about $10.6 million, with nearly all of that wealth in the value of\u00a0two apartments he owns, in New York City and in Palm Beach, Florida. Moss and Freeman plan to seek liens on\u00a0those properties in the coming days, according to their lawyers. In a statement provided by a spokesman, Giuliani cast himself Friday as a man being punished for his role in politics in recent years. \u201cWe will continue to pursue justice and we are confident that\u2014in the long run\u2014our system of justice will be restored and the mayor will be totally vindicated,\u201d Giuliani\u2019s spokesman Ted Goodman said in the statement. Giuliani\u2019s attorneys have indicated he plans to appeal the defamation jury verdict in favor of Moss and Freeman and that he may\u00a0fight them in state court on any liens they seek. In addition to the $6 million, three-bedroom co-op apartment on the Upper East Side of Manhattan and the $3.5 million condo on the Intracoastal Waterway in Florida, Giuliani\u2019s creditors will also be able to try to seize his bank accounts, a Mercedes-Benz sports car, his collection of 26 luxury watches, three World Series championship rings for the New York Yankees, and other baseball memorabilia, like a signed Joe DiMaggio shirt he claims to own. The worth of those other assets\u00a0is unclear, as creditors accuse\u00a0Giuliani of\u00a0downplaying or not disclosing complete estimates of the value of\u00a0what he owns. The creditors believe one World Series ring alone would sell for nearly $30,000, according to court filings in his bankruptcy case. Giuliani also says in bankruptcy filings that the state of California owes him\u00a0more than $10,000 related to\u00a0overpaid taxes from\u00a0his appearance on the TV singing game show \u201cThe Masked Singer,\u201d according to bankruptcy filings. Giuliani also said in filings in recent weeks that he expects to be paid\u00a0tens of thousands of dollars from various ventures: coffee beans being marketed\u00a0with his name and image, and a documentary that\u2019s been in the works for years. The court decision on Friday, announced by Lane in White Plains, New York, marks a long, slow decline for Giuliani, largely related to his work as a lawyer for\u00a0former President Donald Trump after the 2020 election. Giuliani lost his law license in New York last week because he had pushed false information in court challenging the election results on behalf of\u00a0Trump. He is also fighting criminal charges in Arizona and Georgia related to Trump\u2019s efforts to undermine his electoral loss. Giuliani has pleaded not guilty in both cases. Giuliani agreed to end his bankruptcy proceedings, after Freeman and Moss suggested that approach earlier this week. They and other creditors had become furious with the lack of transparency he provided into his assets. The creditors\u00a0argued to the judge in recent days that Giuliani was exploiting the bankruptcy system to avoid having to pay\u00a0his debts, and was acting in bad faith. That accusation prompted outbursts from Giuliani in court, claiming he was the one being defamed. In addition to Moss and Freeman, Giuliani owes more $1 million in taxes, tens of thousands of dollars in unpaid phone bills, and more than $1 million to a law firm where a close friend represented him through past investigations. Several other companies and people, such as a former assistant and the voting machine companies Smartmatic and Dominion, are suing him too. This story has been updated with additional developments.

A new Massachusetts policy goes into effect today, banning overnight stays at Logan International Airport.  Some eligible families on a waiting list will be taken to new shelters, officials said, including a former prison in Norfolk, Massachusetts, that was recently converted into an emergency shelter. The move comes as state officials say they\u2019ve run out of shelter space. \u201cWe\u2019ve never thought that Logan was an appropriate place for people to be staying overnight,\u201d Gov. Maura Healey told CNN affiliate WBZ after announcing the policy. Officials converted a former prison into a shelter. It\u2019s controversial For months, officials in Massachusetts have warned they were overwhelmed by the number of migrants arriving. Healey said last year that the state\u2019s emergency shelter system for families had reached capacity with 7,500 families. At one point last year, the state\u2019s lieutenant governor called on residents to consider housing migrants in their homes due to the lack of shelter space. And recently a delegation from the state traveled to the US Southern border to spread the word \u201cabout how Massachusetts is out of shelter space,\u201d officials said. In May officials announced that the Bay State Correctional Center in Norfolk, which shut down in 2015, was being converted into an emergency shelter that could house 140 families. The controversial announcement sparked protests outside the facility some 25 miles southwest of Boston, WBZ reported. Footage from the CNN affiliate showed protesters waving signs that said, \u201cNo kids in prisons\u201d and \u201cNorfolk Prison-Shelter Not Safe for Anyone!\u201d And at a heated community meeting last month, tensions flared as Norfolk residents expressed concerns about possible impacts on schools, medical services and public safety, according to WBZ. Police and social workers escorted families out Migrants have been sleeping in a corner of the Boston airport\u2019s international arrivals terminal for months. Footage from CNN affiliates showed people lining up sleeping bags, blankets and pillows in rows along the walls of the terminal. At one point, hundreds of migrant families were staying there, CNN affiliate WCVB reported. On June 25, officials said 288 people had slept there overnight. By Tuesday morning, only a few families remained. After sunrise, WBZ reported that state police, social workers and airport staff led those migrants to taxis, which took migrants to welcome centers in Allston and Quincy. \u201cThis is in the best interest of families and travelers and staff at Logan, as the airport is not an appropriate place for people to seek shelter,\u201d state Emergency Assistance Director Scott Rice said in a press release last month. \u201cWe are going to continue to spread the word that Massachusetts is out of shelter space and that, if families are travelling to Massachusetts, they need to be prepared with a plan for housing that does not include Logan Airport or our Emergency Assistance shelters.\u201d CNN\u2019s Braden Walker contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/09/us/boston-logan-airport-migrants-cec/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/13/2024", "section": "us"}}

Alvin Bragg\u2019s\u00a0office is working with alleged victims whose claims of forcible rape and sexual abuse against the 72-year-old\u00a0disgraced\u00a0former Hollywood producer still fall within the statute of limitations, prosecutor Nicole Blumberg told the court. Blumberg said prosecutors could realistically go to trial in November against Weinstein,\u00a0whose downfall over similar claims became a symbol of the #MeToo movement. Some of the alleged victims had been not willing to participate in the legal process at the time of Weinstein\u2019s first trial, the prosecutor said. \u201cAs we said in 2020, some women were not ready. These women are now ready,\u201d Blumberg said The New York Court of Appeals\u00a0ruled this year\u00a0that the testimony of \u201cprior bad acts\u201d witnesses should not have been allowed in the trial that led to Weinstein\u2019s 2020 conviction of first-degree criminal sexual act and third-degree rape because it \u201cwas unnecessary to establish defendant\u2019s intent and served only to establish defendant\u2019s propensity to commit the crimes charged.\u201d He was sentenced to\u00a023 years in prison\u00a0and has maintained his innocence and denied any nonconsensual sexual activity. Prosecutors in New York had in May indicated their plans to seek a new indictment but said Tuesday they have yet to do so. Weinstein\u2019s lawyers must be notified when that happens because the defense team plans to present a case to the grand jury that might include testimony from Weinstein himself. Defense attorney Arthur Aidala accused the DA\u2019s office of delaying tactics at the hearing, telling state Judge Curtis Farber, \u201cThey have a defendant and they\u2019re out there looking for a crime.\u201d Aidala said Weinstein is \u201cbegging\u201d his attorneys to get this matter done quickly and wants to go to trial in September as initially discussed at the first hearing after Weinstein\u2019s 2020 conviction was vacated by New York\u2019s highest court. He\u00a0has remained behind bars because he was sentenced last year in Los Angeles to\u00a016 years in prison on charges\u00a0of rape and sexual assault \u2013 a trial that similarly used \u201cprior bad acts\u201d witnesses and has also been appealed. The defense attorney said Tuesday that Weinstein is suffering in solitary confinement at Rikers Island after being removed from a hospital setting. According to his lawyer, Weinstein is not getting any treatment for his health issues, including fluid in his heart and his lungs, Spinal Stenosis, macular degeneration in his eyes and diabetes. CNN has reached out to Rikers and the Bureau of Prisons on his claims. Weinstein\u2019s attorneys have consented to Weinstein remaining in custody in New York pending the retrial despite his vacated conviction because he could alternatively be transferred to California to serve a prison sentence for his rape conviction there. Another hearing is scheduled for July 19.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/09/us/harvey-weinstein-alvin-bragg-new-indictment-charges/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/13/2024", "section": "us"}}

{"id": "2024_07_12_us_delta-employee-social-post-palestinian-reaj", "text": "A Delta employee has been removed from their position with the airline\u2019s social media channels following backlash over a post made from an official account that some perceived to be anti-Palestinian.\u00a0\u00a0  In a statement shared with CNN Friday, Delta said the company \u201cremoved a mistakenly posted comment on X Wednesday because it was not in line with our values and our mission to connect the world.\u201d \u201cThe team member responsible for the post has been counseled and no longer supports Delta\u2019s social channels,\u201d the airline said in the statement. \u201cWe apologize for this error.\u201d On Wednesday, an account on X reposted pictures of two Delta flight attendants wearing Palestinian flag pins on their uniforms. It\u2019s unclear what account posted the initial images. \u201cSince 2001 we take our shoes off in every airport because a terrorist attack in US soil. Now imagine getting into a @Delta flight and seeing workers with Hamas badges in the air. What do you do?\u201d the post read, falsely equating the Palestinian flag to the one flown by the militant group. Screenshots show that Delta\u2019s official account replied on Wednesday, writing, \u201cI hear you as I\u2019d be terrified as well, personally. Our employees reflect our culture and we do not take it lightly when our policy is not being followed.\u201d\u00a0That post has since been deleted, and it wasn\u2019t clear what policy the post was referencing. The reply sparked a swift backlash from Delta employees and leaders in Palestinian and Muslim communities. Azka Mahmood, executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations chapter in Georgia, where the airline is based, said in a statement that conflating the Palestinian national symbol to Hamas \u201cerases the existence and legitimacy of the entirety of Palestine.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cThe Palestinian flag represents a country and national aspirations of over 7 million Palestinians,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is clear that some groups want to delegitimize the flag of Palestine entirely, suppress any expression of the existence of Palestine, and discourage open support for Palestinian rights.\u201d\u00a0  A Delta spokesperson said the flight attendants pictured were compliant with the company\u2019s current uniform guidelines and the company has contacted them to offer support. Both flight attendants remain employed by the company, the spokesperson said.\u00a0  However, effective Monday, the company will only allow US flag pins to be worn, Delta told CNN. The move is a departure from previous policies that allowed pins representing countries and nationalities from around the world to be displayed, according to the spokesperson. Mahmood criticized the change to the uniform policy, noting that it \u201cerodes (Delta employees\u2019) freedom of expression.\u201d \u201cWe should be concerned that this policy change has come about in response to negative attention related to Palestine in particular. It speaks volumes that in the past flight attendants have been able to sport pins showing solidarity with Ukraine, for instance, without any issue,\u201d she said. \u201cDelta should stand by its employees\u2019 right to free speech and expression rather than caving to pressure.\u201d On Thursday, a group of Delta employees working to unionize\u00a0posted an open letter\u00a0they sent\u00a0to the company\u2019s CEO, demanding a public apology for the post. \u201cFor decades, it has been common practice for crew members to wear pins reflecting their heritage. The strength of diversity at network airlines is celebrated as a reflection of the places and people we connect around the world,\u201d the\u00a0group\u00a0said in its letter.\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cEveryone should be able to freely express their pride and support for their heritage without encountering hostility or discrimination from employers or customers.\u201d Following the incident, civil rights activist and American Islamic scholar Omar Suleiman \u2013 who has about 8 million followers across social media platforms \u2013 urged his followers to boycott Delta. In 2023, CAIR said it received the highest number of complaints of anti-Muslim bias in the organization\u2019s 30-year history, CNN previously reported. The civil rights group said nearly half of the complaints it has received occurred in the final three months of the year, after the October 7 Hamas attack on Israel. Mahmood maintains the numbers likely \u201cunderrepresent the true extent of anti-Muslim activity in the U.S.\u201d due to lack of knowledge on how to report incidents as well as some citizens \u201csimply accept[ing] it as part of life in the U.S.\u201d\u00a0 ", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/12/us/delta-employee-social-post-palestinian-reaj/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/13/2024", "section": "us"}}

American Rounds, the distributor of the machines, uses AI technology to scan the customers\u2019 identification as well as facial recognition software to verify a customer\u2019s identity, according to the company\u2019s website. The software works together to verify the buyer\u2019s age and that the person using the machine matches the identification scanned. Each machine sells ammunition\u00a0for various firearm calibers, including rifles, shotguns and handguns, according to American Rounds. Grant Magers, CEO of American Rounds, said local grocery stores approached him\u00a0in the spring of 2023 about utilizing his technology to sell ammunition. The company rolled out its\u00a0first dispenser in Alabama last November. \u201cIt\u2019s not much different than setting up any other business,\u201d Magers said. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) has\u00a0allowed the machines, telling CNN in a statement: \u201cA federal license is not required to sell ammunition. However, commercial sales of ammunition must comply with state laws as well as any applicable federal laws.\u201d The Office of the Oklahoma Attorney General tells CNN a \u201creview of state statutes indicates these vending machines appear to be lawful.\u201d CNN has reached out to the Alabama and Texas attorneys general to confirm the legality of the dispensers in their respective states. Earlier this month, the ammunition dispenser in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, was taken down and relocated by American Rounds. \u201cWe as a business \u2026 made the decision to relocate that machine because we weren\u2019t having the sales that we wanted to at that location compared to our other spots,\u201d Magers said. Kip Tyner, a member of Tuscaloosa city council, told CNN: \u201cIt may be getting in the hands of people who are not that responsible. I just don\u2019t see it as a necessity.\u201d \u201cThere could be a dispute, and someone got upset with someone else and instead of cooling off and having to go to the store the next day they could go to the grocery store to get ammunition and use it for the wrong reasons,\u201d Tyner said. American Rounds plans to expand into more states, having already received offers from stores in California, Florida and Hawaii, among others, Magers said.

{"id": "2024_07_10_us_pauly-likens-transgender-teen-murder-pennsylvania-reaj", "text": "A suspect is facing murder\u00a0and other\u00a0charges after the remains of a transgender teen who had been missing in Pennsylvania\u00a0since late June\u00a0were found in a lake, according to a criminal complaint. Dashawn Watkins, 29, has been charged with first degree murder, aggravated assault, abuse of\u00a0a\u00a0corpse,\u00a0and tampering with evidence in connection with the death of 14-year-old Pauly Likens of Sharon, Pennsylvania, police said in a complaint filed in Mercer County District Court. CNN has reached out to Watkins\u2019 attorney for comment\u00a0but has not yet received a response.\u00a0If\u00a0convicted,\u00a0Watkins could face the death penalty or life in prison, according to Pennsylvania state law. Mercer County District Attorney Peter C. Acker told CNN at this point investigators have not found any evidence that suggests Likens\u2019 murder was a hate crime. However, investigators are also not ruling out the possibility, and if anyone has evidence that would suggest this is a hate crime, he said, authorities will investigate it. Likens\u2019\u00a0relatives had been searching for the teen for several days when police began finding dismembered human remains in and near the Shenango River Lake in Mercer County, the criminal complaint said. Mercer County Coroner John A. Libonati said in a July 3 statement the remains belonged to\u00a0Likens. The cause of death was determined to be sharp force trauma to the head and the manner was ruled as homicide, Libonati said. Pamela Ladner, president of\u00a0LGBTQIA+ Alliance Shenango Valley who spoke on behalf of\u00a0the teen\u2019s\u00a0family, told CNN\u00a0Likens \u201cwas a selfless, loving child who loved nature, getting her nails done, and shopping.\u201d \u201cShe aspired to be a\u00a0park\u00a0ranger like her Aunt Liz,\u201d\u00a0Ladner said.\u00a0\u201cOur community is mourning with Pauly\u2019s family at this tragic loss of young life. We are hoping justice is served.\u201d Likens\u00a0was last seen walking home on June 22 after leaving a friend\u2019s house, police said in the complaint.\u00a0In the early hours of June 23, the teenager posted on Snapchat that she had gone on a late-night walk. She replied\u00a0initially\u00a0when her friend asked if she was OK but did not reply to further messages, the complaint said. Video surveillance from\u00a0nearby\u00a0businesses and homes showed a person that appeared to be Likens\u00a0walking near a canoe launch along the Shenango River in Sharon, as well as a vehicle arriving and leaving the area around the same time on June 23, according to the complaint. Police said Watkins, the suspect, was seen in video footage leaving a nearby apartment complex with a large duffel bag that appeared empty and returning about 20 to 25 minutes later with the bag looking \u201cheavy and awkward,\u201d the complaint says.\u00a0Video shows a vehicle leaving the apartment complex, arriving to the canoe launch area and returning to the complex during the same time frame,\u00a0the complaint states. The footage shows Watkins struggling to carry the duffle bag and placing it on the floor\u00a0of a hallway in the building, and then again\u00a0before entering an apartment, the complaint said. He\u2019s also seen coming to the apartment later that day with a shopping bag and leaving with multiple bags\u00a0and garbage bags\u00a0the next day. When officers went to the building, they saw what appeared to be blood stains in the places where Watkins rested the bag on the floor, the complaint said. When Watkins was detained by police on July 2, he told authorities that he recently met with a person he had met on Grindr,\u00a0who\u00a0police said matched\u00a0Likens\u2019\u00a0description, according to the complaint. Watkins claimed his memory was poor when asked about where they met or where he had gone, the complaint said. He said the person did not come to his apartment and noted that he brought in a large rolling luggage\u00a0bag\u00a0that he had left in his car from a recent vacation, the complaint said.\u00a0When police searched Watkins\u2019\u00a0apartment, they found\u00a0traces of\u00a0blood,\u00a0a saw, and a receipt for the purchase of the tool, the complaint said. \u00a0 A candlelight vigil for\u00a0Likens\u00a0will be held in Sharon on Saturday.\u00a0The teenager is being remembered for her will to help others, her love of animals and her \u201ccontagious laughter,\u201d according to her obituary. \u201cPauly lit up every room she entered, always making people smile and passing around her contagious laughter. Pauly was a selfless person, never missing a chance to help others and give what she could. Even as a young child, she donated her spare change to the veterans\u2019 stand outside Walmart,\u201d her obituary\u00a0reads. \u201cA sassy kid, Pauly loved to give her family a hard time, cracking jokes and loving every moment with her family.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/10/us/pauly-likens-transgender-teen-murder-pennsylvania-reaj/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/13/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_07_10_us_dwight-jackson-employment-discrimination-lawsuit-reaj", "text": "A Black man has filed an employment discrimination lawsuit against a hotel in Detroit, Michigan, alleging the hotel only offered him a job interview after he changed the name on his resume, according to a copy of the lawsuit obtained by CNN. Dwight Jackson filed the lawsuit against the Shinola Hotel on July 3, alleging he was denied a job when he applied as \u201cDwight Jackson,\u201d but later offered an interview when he changed his name to \u201cJohn Jebrowski.\u201d The lawsuit alleges Jackson was denied a job in \u201cviolation of Michigan Elliott Larsen Civil Rights Act.\u201d Between January and April 2024, Jackson, a 27-year-old Black man, applied to multiple positions at the Shinola Hotel in downtown Detroit, including a role in reception, according to the lawsuit. On its website, Shinola Hotel says it is a \u201cluxury\u201d hotel. Jackson\u2019s attorney, Jon Marko, provided CNN with a copy of Jackson\u2019s resume, which details consistent employment, including previous roles as a \u201cFront Desk Agent\u201d at Detroit\u2019s Marriott Westin Book Cadillac and David Whitney Hotel, which use the words luxury and luxurious to describe their respective hotels. \u201cMr. Jackson had applied for a job that he was eminently qualified for,\u201d Marko, a civil rights attorney, told CNN. However, Shinola Hotel did not offer Jackson an interview. After getting no response to his initial job applications, in April 2024 Jackson applied again, making one significant change to his application \u2014 his name. According to the lawsuit, Jackson applied to Shinola Hotel \u201ctwice for similar positions under a more readily apparent Caucasian name, with the alias \u2018John Jebrowski,\u2019\u201d using nearly identical resumes. The resumes have different dates of previous employment. He was offered multiple interviews within the same week, the lawsuit claims. The lawsuit alleges that \u201cJackson established that the Defendant\u2019s consideration of candidates was based on the racial appearance of the applicant\u2019s name.\u201d \u201cTo be denied a job in 2024 in your hometown, for the color of your skin, goes beyond dollars and cents. It goes into the psyche of a person,\u201d Marko said. Sage Hospitality Group is Shinola Hotel\u2019s operating partner. Anna Stancioff, Sage Hospitality\u2019s Senior Corporate Director of PR & Brand Communications and spokesperson for the hotel said in an email Tuesday, \u201cWe take this allegation very seriously and do not tolerate discrimination of any kind. We are committed to fostering an inclusive workplace where everyone has the opportunity to succeed and are dedicated to building a diverse workforce that reflects the community.\u201d According to Marko, Jackson attended the job interview and confronted the interviewer at Shinola Hotel. He revealed his real identity and expressed his belief that he was not given an interview initially because his name appeared more traditionally African American. \u201cShortly after Jackson underwent the interview process, he was informed that he was no longer a viable candidate for the position,\u201d the lawsuit states. Marko said employment discrimination is not unusual. He added, as a civil rights attorney, \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a lot of discrimination in hiring, especially when it comes to the exclusion of minorities and individuals who have minority-sounding names.\u201d A recent\u00a0study published by the National Bureau of Economic Research\u00a0found that name bias is a prevalent issue in the hiring process. Researchers sent out identical resumes to 108 U.S. employers to analyze whether race and gender affected callback rates for job applications. Resumes with Black male and Black female names received the fewest callbacks. But, Marko said, proving cases of name bias is extremely challenging and most of these cases never get off the ground due to a lack of evidence. Jackson\u2019s case is different, he said, because he applied twice for similar positions with nearly the exact same resume and it yielded different results when he used the alias. Marko said Jackson \u201cwants to shed light on this problem that\u2019s not just isolated at the Shinola Hotel, not just isolated in Detroit or Michigan, but across the country. He wants to make sure that it doesn\u2019t happen to anyone else.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/10/us/dwight-jackson-employment-discrimination-lawsuit-reaj/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/13/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_08_us_rust-shooting-timeline-alec-baldwin", "text": "The actor Alec Baldwin and several crew members gathered in a church at a New Mexico ranch on October 21, 2021, to rehearse a scene from their upcoming Western film \u201cRust.\u201d Then came the unexpected gunshot. A promising cinematographer was killed, a director was wounded and a film production was left in shambles. Since that day\u2019s fatal shooting of 42-year-old Halyna Hutchins, the film\u2019s armorer and its assistant director have been convicted of criminal charges. After nearly three years of back-and-forth legal arguments, Baldwin\u2019s trial on the involuntary manslaughter charge began on July 10 with opening statements but ended abruptly on June 12, when the judge ruled prosecutors did not properly turn over evidence to the defense, and dismissed the charges. The details of what happened the day of the shooting have been made public in affidavits, probable cause statements, interviews with the main participants and testimony at criminal trials. Here\u2019s a timeline of the on-set shooting and the resulting legal cases. The shooting May 29, 2020: Baldwin, the three-time Emmy winner for his roles on \u201c30 Rock\u201d and \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d was announced as producer and star of the Western feature film \u201cRust,\u201d based on a story by Baldwin and Joel Souza, Deadline reported. In the film, Baldwin plays a grizzled outlaw on the run from authorities with his 13-year-old grandson. October 6, 2021: Filming of \u201cRust\u201d began at Bonanza Creek Ranch, a movie set outside Santa Fe, New Mexico. October 20, 2021: Several crew members walked off set, citing safety concerns. One crew member stated there had been two accidental weapons discharges and a special effects mess-up that set off explosives around the crew between takes. October 21, 2021: Hannah Gutierrez Reed, the armorer for \u201cRust,\u201d loaded a prop six-shot revolver with what she believed were \u201cdummy\u201d rounds, a term for ammo that contains no explosive elements but appear to be real, according to investigators and her defense attorney. Baldwin and several crew members began rehearsing a scene in a rustic church on set before breaking for lunch. After the break, Baldwin, Souza, Hutchins and a few others returned to the church for rehearsal. Assistant director Dave Halls fetched a prop gun from a cart outside the church and yelled \u201ccold gun,\u201d indicating it was unloaded. He then handed the gun to Baldwin. Baldwin practiced a \u201ccross draw\u201d \u2013 pulling a gun from a holster on the opposite side of his body from his draw hand. The scene required him to point the gun toward the camera, helmed by Hutchins, Souza and a camera operator. Suddenly, they heard a loud bang. Hutchins stumbled backward, slumped to the floor clutching her stomach and said she couldn\u2019t feel her legs. Souza, who had been standing beside her, noticed blood on his shoulder. At 1:48 p.m., the crew reported the shooting to emergency responders. Hutchins was transported by air helicopter to the hospital and was pronounced dead at 3:37 p.m. Souza was treated at the hospital, and a projectile from a live round was removed from his back. Sheriff\u2019s deputies arrived to the scene and began investigating the series of events leading to the shooting. October 22, 2021: Baldwin released a statement calling the death a \u201ctragic accident\u201d and said he is fully cooperating with the police investigation. December 2, 2021: In an interview with ABC, Baldwin said he cocked the gun and let go of the hammer, and the gun then fired. He said he was aiming the gun just to the side of the camera toward Hutchins, as she instructed him to do. \u201cI would never point a gun at anyone and then pull the trigger, never,\u201d he said. The investigations August 14, 2022: FBI testing of the firearm found it could not be fired without pulling the trigger while the gun was cocked, according to a forensics report. The report noted the gun eventually malfunctioned during FBI testing after internal parts fractured, causing the gun to go off in the cocked position without pulling the trigger. August 20, 2022: In an interview with CNN, Baldwin\u00a0placed responsibility\u00a0for Hutchins\u2019 death on Gutierrez Reed, the film armorer and props assistant, and on assistant director Halls, who handed him the gun. October 5, 2022: The family of Hutchins and Baldwin reached an undisclosed settlement in a wrongful death lawsuit filed against the actor and others. As part of the settlement, Matthew Hutchins, the cinematographer\u2019s widower, was named an executive producer on \u201cRust.\u201d January 19, 2023: Prosecutors announced Baldwin and Gutierrez Reed will be charged with involuntary manslaughter in Hutchins\u2019 death. Halls, the assistant director, agreed to plead no contest to negligent use of a deadly weapon, the district attorney\u2019s office announced. The terms of that deal include six months of probation\u00a0and a suspended sentence, prosecutors said. January 31, 2023: Baldwin and Gutierrez Reed were formally charged with involuntary manslaughter. February 23, 2023: Baldwin pleaded not guilty to manslaughter charges and was released on personal recognizance. April 20, 2023: New Mexico special prosecutors dismissed the charges against Baldwin, citing \u201cnew facts\u201d in the case. \u201cThis decision does not absolve Mr. Baldwin of criminal culpability and charges may be refiled,\u201d they said. August 9, 2023: Gutierrez Reed pleaded not guilty to involuntary manslaughter and tampering with evidence. January 19: Baldwin was indicted by a grand jury on charges of involuntary manslaughter. January 31: Baldwin pleaded not guilty to involuntary manslaughter charges for the second time. The trials February 22: The trial of film armorer Gutierrez Reed began. Prosecutors alleged her failures allowed six live bullets to make their way on set, and she did not make vital safety checks that would have caught the problem. Her defense blamed Baldwin for failing to follow common-sense gun safety rules and on the film\u2019s production team for creating a chaotic and unsafe environment. March 1: Souza, the director and screenwriter, testified about the moment he was shot on set while standing behind Hutchins. March 6: Gutierrez Reed was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter after jurors deliberated for nearly three hours. She was acquitted of a charge of evidence tampering. April 15: At her sentencing hearing, Gutierrez Reed said, \u201cMy heart aches\u201d for Hutchins\u2019 family and friends, and she asked the judge to sentence her to probation. The judge criticized her statement and sentenced her to a maximum of 18 months in prison, saying, \u201cYou alone turned a safe weapon into a lethal weapon.\u201d May 24: A New Mexico judge denied Baldwin\u2019s motion to dismiss the involuntary manslaughter indictment. Baldwin\u2019s attorneys had accused prosecutors of misconduct during the grand jury process. June 3: New Mexico prosecutors asked the court to grant use immunity to Gutierrez Reed and compel her to testify at Baldwin\u2019s trial, according to court documents. Gutierrez Reed invoked her Fifth Amendment right to silence in a pre-trial interview, and prosecutors said if she is not granted immunity then she would not be able to testify in the trial. Gutierrez Reed\u2019s attorney, Jason Bowles, told CNN he will oppose the motion. June 17: Prosecutors signaled their intention to portray Baldwin as repeatedly flouting safety protocols on the movie set in the days before the fatal shooting, according to\u00a0a court filing. June 21: Judge Mary Marlowe Sommer denied a defense motion asking the court to dismiss the involuntary manslaughter indictment. The defense had argued the shooting death was an accident and Baldwin was \u201cnot criminally liable,\u201d but the prosecution countered Baldwin was experienced in the movie business and knew he was handling a real gun. The judge also denied the prosecution\u2019s motion to grant use immunity to Gutierrez Reed to compel her to testify at Baldwin\u2019s trial. June 28: The court denied a motion to dismiss the charges related to the gun that was damaged during forensic testing. Separately, attorneys for Gutierrez Reed in a court filing on June 27 accused prosecutors of withholding evidence that would have favored the defendant during her manslaughter trial and requested she be released from prison,\u00a0Reuters\u00a0reported. According to the filing obtained by Reuters, prosecutors had a report from their own weapons experts that the gun used on set had \u201cunexplained toolmarks on critical surfaces of the trigger and sear.\u201d July 3: Judge Marlowe Sommer denied two motions filed by Baldwin\u2019s legal team alleging prosecutors had improperly handled evidence, paving the way for Baldwin\u2019s trial to start. July 8: The judge ruled Baldwin\u2019s role as a producer on the film \u201cRust\u201d would not be considered at trial. The prosecution had sought to show Baldwin had more responsibility and influence on the set than just as an actor, but the judge said the evidence was prejudicial and confusing to the jury. July 9: Twelve jurors and four alternates were empaneled in Santa Fe for Baldwin\u2019s trial. July 10: The trial of Baldwin on a charge of involuntary manslaughter began with opening statements. Prosecutors alleged Baldwin was reckless with firearms on set and violated the \u201ccardinal rules of firearm safety.\u201d \u201cHe pointed the gun at another human being, cocked the hammer and pulled that trigger, in reckless disregard for Ms. Hutchins\u2019 safety,\u201d prosecutor Erlinda Johnson said. The defense blamed the film\u2019s armorer and the first assistant director for allowing a live round to be loaded into the prop gun. \u201cThis was an unspeakable tragedy, but Alec Baldwin committed no crime. He was an actor, acting, playing the role of Harlan Rust. An actor playing a character can do things that are lethal,\u201d attorney Alex Spiro said. \u201cThese \u2018cardinal rules\u2019 are not cardinal rules on a movie set.\u201d July 12: The involuntary manslaughter case against actor Alec Baldwin was dismissed in dramatic fashion after the judge overseeing the case ruled prosecutors did not properly turn over evidence to the defense. Judge Mary Marlowe Sommer sided with the defense and dismissed the case with prejudice, meaning it cannot be brought again. \u201cThe state\u2019s discovery violation has injected a needless, incurable delay into the jury trial,\u201d she said. \u201cDismissal with prejudice is warranted to ensure the integrity of the judicial system and the efficient administration of justice. Your motion to dismiss with prejudice is granted.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/08/us/rust-shooting-timeline-alec-baldwin/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/13/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_07_12_us_van-epps-plane-crash-ny-georgia-cec", "text": "A few days after the plane crash, Ansley Van Epps visited the house where her brother and his family once lived. There was food in the refrigerator, dishes in the sink. She walked through her nephews\u2019 rooms and looked at their medals, their sports jerseys, their school uniforms. Elsewhere she found items laid out for a beach vacation the family would never take. \u201cIt was heartbreaking,\u201d she said. Her brother, Ryan Van Epps, had gone to upstate New York for a youth baseball tournament with his wife, Laura, and their two sons, Harrison, 10; and James Ryan, 12. They were returning June 30 in a small plane piloted by the boys\u2019 grandfather, Roger Beggs. The plane crashed in the Catskill Mountains, not long after takeoff, for unknown reasons that may have been related to bad weather. All five people were killed. The Van Epps family left behind two dogs, a stunned and grieving community, and an untold number of priceless memories. Regan Burr was a friend of the family. She remembered Laura\u2019s flower arrangements. They often featured blue hydrangeas and magnolia leaves. Laura brought flowers in a vase to Burr\u2019s house for a cookout on Memorial Day weekend. Burr washed the vase and stored it away. When she heard about the plane crash, she found the vase, cut some hydrangeas from her own yard, put them in the vase, and brought it back to Laura\u2019s house. No one was home to receive them, so she left the vase on the front porch. \u201cA whole family was taken away in an instant,\u201d she said. The Van Epps family was well-known and beloved in Atlanta\u2019s northern suburbs On Monday, Ryan\u2019s sister Ansley was at Perimeter Mall with her husband and daughters. They were buying clothes for the funeral, scheduled for Friday afternoon at Roswell United Methodist Church, the same church that hosted Ryan and Laura\u2019s wedding 15 years and one day earlier. At the mall on Monday, Ansley sat down at a table under a skylight and thought about her brother, her nephews, and the challenge of planning a service for five people all at once. Ryan was the oldest of four Van Epps siblings. Ansley reminisced about the giant forts he built in the backyard. He and his father would collect discarded lumber from construction sites. One treehouse was multiple stories high and had a crow\u2019s nest like you\u2019d see on a pirate ship. Ryan played baseball, football and lacrosse. He graduated from Roswell High School a year ahead of Laura, who also played lacrosse. Ryan got a college degree in business administration; Laura in special education. They started dating after college, got married and had two sons who attended King\u2019s Ridge Christian School in Alpharetta. \u201cHarrison cared about doing well in school and had a great attitude about working hard to improve his skills,\u201d wrote Stefanie Gammage, head of the lower school. \u201cHe was well-liked by classmates and was a good friend.\u201d Harrison played quarterback and linebacker in the North Atlanta Football Club. \u201cHe was incredibly smart, incredibly driven,\u201d said his coach, Rich Dennis. \u201cHe was loved by every kid on the team.\u201d James Ryan, his older brother, also played football. His team in the Milton High feeder program won a state championship, said his coach, Brent Bechard. James Ryan played tight end, receiver and middle linebacker, or \u201cmic linebacker,\u201d where he led the defense. The coach recalled a goal-line stand at the end of a playoff game. James Ryan and his teammates stopped the running back at the 1-yard line to preserve the victory. The coach also remembered how James Ryan\u2019s mother, Laura, went out of her way to celebrate the other boys on the team. \u201cShe always had a hug for everybody,\u201d he said. A trip to Cooperstown, and a memorable home run James Ryan also played on an elite travel-ball team called the Ninth Inning Blue Jays. They\u2019d been together since the previous August and had looked forward to the tournament in Cooperstown, home to the Baseball Hall of Fame. Each family was responsible for its own travel arrangements. The head coach, Chase Timms, rented an SUV, packed it with baseball equipment, and drove up to New York. The Van Epps family took a different route. Laura\u2019s father, Roger Beggs, was a licensed pilot with a six-seat, single-engine Piper Malibu Mirage. Ansley remembered flying with him when Roger delivered her to Savannah for her bachelorette party. She said he was a meticulous pilot who took every precaution, and the plane had recently undergone its annual maintenance. James Ryan joined the other Blue Jays on one of the many fields at Cooperstown Dreams Park. Their first game was Wednesday night, June 26. The bases were loaded when James Ryan walked to the plate through heavy rain. Coach Timms watched from his place near third base. He could see the batter\u2019s box turning to mud. The pitcher aimed and fired. James Ryan swung. The ball sailed into the night, over the outfield, over the fence. James Ryan ran the bases carefully after his grand slam. He didn\u2019t want to fall in the mud. The coach saw him rounding third with a big smile on his face. That was the first of many home runs for the Blue Jays in Cooperstown. They went 3-2 in pool play before heading into the single-elimination bracket, where they won two more games. On Sunday morning, James Ryan was the starting pitcher against Team Elite National, another Georgia squad, the top-seeded team in the tournament. \u201cFor the majority of the game, we were winning,\u201d Timms said. The Blue Jays scored several runs in the first inning, and James Ryan was pitching well. But Team Elite came back, took the lead, and won the game. The Blue Jays were eliminated. James Ryan put on a brave face. \u201cHe always took a loss with as much grace as you could want from a 12-year-old,\u201d Timms said. The coach gathered the players and congratulated them on a wonderful season. The families pressed in together for a picture. Then they prepared to go their separate ways. Coach Timms gave James Ryan one last fist-bump. \u201cI told him I was proud of him,\u201d Timms said. \u201cI told Laura, \u2018We\u2019ll see you guys soon. Safe travels.\u2019\u201d \u2018Storm activity along the flight path\u2019 Oneonta Municipal Airport is about 15 miles from the baseball park. According to the National Transportation Safety Board, the Piper carrying Roger Beggs and his four passengers took off from Oneonta at 1:40 p.m. They were headed for Charleston, West Virginia, about 560 miles southwest, to refuel before heading on to suburban Atlanta. It\u2019s not clear what the pilot knew or believed about the weather when he first ascended. Investigators are still working on their preliminary report, which is expected later this month. According to an NTSB statement, \u201cFlight tracking data was lost about 12 minutes after departure.\u201d It also said, \u201cMeteorological data shows storm activity along the flight path.\u201d The single-engine Piper did not get very far. It crashed in unknown circumstances along the wooded hills near Lake Cecil Road in the town of Masonville, New York, about 30 miles from the Oneonta airport. The NTSB said the plane left a trail of debris almost a mile long. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of questions about what happened,\u201d Ansley Van Epps said, beneath the skylight at Perimeter Mall, in a conversation with a reporter on Monday. It had been more than a week since the crash, and she did not expect to understand it anytime soon. \u201cWe will be asking why for the rest of our lives,\u201d she said. Meanwhile, she and others who loved the Van Epps family took care of other priorities. The dogs, a young black lab named Gunner and an old golden retriever named Walker, were in the care of Laura\u2019s stepmother. Friends were helping each other choose colorful outfits for the funeral, because they were sure Laura wouldn\u2019t have wanted anyone to wear black. James Ryan\u2019s football teammates were adding their signatures to his helmet. Someone was organizing an unusually long list of pallbearers. There was something else, too. A terrible errand to run. On Tuesday morning, Ansley, her husband, D.J., her parents, and her younger brother, Jason, flew to JFK airport in New York. A man who worked for Delta Air Lines drove them onto the tarmac to see the remains of their loved ones loaded into the cargo hold of a plane. The driver was nearly overcome with emotion. Ansley started crying. The survivors boarded the plane to escort their loved ones back to Atlanta. On that flight, Ansley reached a state of emotional exhaustion.

Mayor G.T. Bynum announced at\u00a0a news conference Friday the victim\u2019s identity as C.L. Daniel, a veteran who served in World War I. \u201cHis family did not know where he had been buried for the last 103 years until this week,\u201d Bynum said. Officials say Daniel was identified \u201cusing data submitted through GEDmatch and Family Tree DNA\u201d and with the assistance of Intermountain Forensics, a laboratory that conducts genealogy work,\u00a0according to a news release. The dig is part of the 1921 Graves Investigation, an effort to identify currently unknown victims of the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre,\u00a0CNN previously reported. Alison Wilde, the\u00a0genealogy\u00a0case manager for the 1921 Graves Investigation, said that they compared\u00a0the DNA profiles and the GEDmatch in the family tree databases. People who have taken DNA tests to create family tree databases \u201chave contributed so much to this research,\u201d she said. Then, they contacted individuals who had matching DNA relatives to see who was buried at Oaklawn Cemetery, according to the news release. Daniel, born in Newnan, Georgia, was one of seven sons to Thomas and Amanda Merriweather. \u201cIt was only through those additional DNA comparisons that we were able to narrow our focus down to a set of brothers and begin requesting records of their lives which led to the records from the National Archive,\u201d Wilde said. A letter obtained from the National Archives also contributed to Daniel\u2019s identification, the release states. \u201cContained in the records (from the National Archives) was the most convincing piece of evidence tying him to the Tulsa Race Massacre \u2013 a letter from C. L.\u2019s family attorney written to the US Veterans Administration on behalf of C. L.\u2019s mother regarding C. L.\u2019s survivor benefits,\u201d according to the release. With the help of the National Archives, officials found records showing Daniel was drafted into the US Army in 1918, was stationed at Camp Gordon and then honorably discharged in December 1919, the news release said. Another\u00a0letter, written by Daniel in February 1921, showed that he was in Ogden, Utah, and was trying to make his way back home to his mother in Georgia, officials said at the news conference. Wilde said that this letter came from the same records request, which was written to the Veterans Administration and the War Risk Insurance Department. There was no mention of Tulsa in the 1921 letter, Wilde said. Officials said they could only assume that in his efforts to travel back to Georgia, he went through Tulsa, since his remains were found in the city. The circumstances of the veteran\u2019s death are unknown, officials say. His remains showed no signs of gunshot wounds, according to Bynum. Bynum said Friday Daniel\u2019s identification offers \u201chope that other remains found in similar circumstances\u201d can also be identified. Bynum said on\u00a0Facebook\u00a0Monday officials \u201chave written documentation that 18 unidentified victims were buried.\u201d He reiterated that fact at Friday\u2019s news conference. \u201cThis identification affirms our need to continue this search with the knowledge that identification and reunification is possible,\u201d he said.

{"id": "2024_07_12_politics_trump-biden-presidential-election", "text": "If you follow my work, you know that I\u2019ve tended to be pessimistic about President Joe Biden\u2019s chances of reelection. There are plenty of reasons for that \u2013 for instance, he\u2019s trailing in the polls both nationally and in swing states, and has an approval rating south of 40%. But sometimes it\u2019s worth taking a step back and looking at the counterargument. Biden\u2019s been through arguably two of the worst weeks for a president running for reelection that I can recall, and he\u2019s still within earshot of former President Donald Trump. If you average the national polls since the debate 15 days ago, Trump\u2019s ahead by 3 points.\u00a0An NPR/PBS News/Marist College poll out Friday morning even put the race at 50% for Biden to 48% for Trump (a result within the margin of error). No one should be comfortable calling the presidential race with these sorts of polling results. Since 1972, the average difference between the polls at this point and the eventual result has been 6 points. Sometimes races change by far more than that. Democrat Michael Dukakis led Republican George H.W. Bush by mid-to-high single digits at this point in 1988 before the party conventions. By the time the race was over, Bush had defeated Dukakis by 8 points. Biden and Trump\u2019s own history should make you think twice about calling wraps on this race as well. Biden was ahead by 9 points in the early July national polls in 2020. He ended up winning the national popular vote by only half that (4.5 points). Such a shift in Biden\u2019s direction this time around would put him over the top in the popular vote. Of course, this election will ultimately come down to the pivotal battleground states. The post-debate data from those states is limited, though the polling we had from before the debate suggested that Biden was doing worse in those states taken as a whole than he was nationally. Biden\u2019s clearest path, according to the public data (and both campaigns), continues to be through the northern battleground states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Wins in all three would likely mean Biden can lose Arizona, George, Nevada and North Carolina and still pull off a victory. Looking at the forecasting models Figuring out how to account for all this information (or lack thereof) to better understand the state of the race between Biden and Trump can be a challenge. One way to do that is through forecasting models, which look at a lot of data, including current national polls, current swing-state polls, the time until the election (i.e., how much polling can shift over time) and even the state of the economy (e.g., strong job reports and less positive data about income growth). I love to check these forecasting models and have even assisted with building some in the past because they help ground us in objective facts and not subjective opinions. Models like these cannot account for everything (e.g., we\u2019ve never had a rematch between two presidents in the polling era), but they are far better than conjecture. Per the average forecasting model, Biden wins about 30% of the time against Trump. Some might view a 3-in-10 probability as low. I wouldn\u2019t read it that way. If the current model average is to be believed, Biden has a better chance of winning this election than a flipped coin\u00a0landing on heads twice in a row. Any young student or NFL captain can tell you that flipping heads twice in a row happens all the time, despite it not being the more likely outcome. For the politically obsessed, a different example might hit closer to home. When I worked at FiveThirtyEight \u2013 my then-boss Nate Silver now has a model that looks similar to the current average \u2013 we gave Trump about a 30% chance of defeating Hillary Clinton on the eve of the 2016 election. As I wrote at the time, Trump was a \u201cnormal polling error behind Clinton\u201d \u2013 the idea being that the polls were close enough that Trump could win if the polling was off by a normal amount. Today, the situation is somewhat different. Biden\u2019s Electoral College path does seem to be narrower than Trump\u2019s was in 2016. What Biden does have that Trump didn\u2019t in 2016 is time. We\u2019ve already seen over the past few weeks since the debate that a lot can change in a short period. So what do all these facts and figures mean? I think it\u2019s totally fair to say that Trump is the favorite and that Biden has his work cut out for him. There is also data to suggest that Vice President Kamala Harris would be a stronger\u00a0Democratic nominee against Trump than Biden. (I tend to believe Democrats would do better with Harris leading the presidential ticket.) But if you currently think Biden can\u2019t win, history would disagree with you.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/12/politics/trump-biden-presidential-election/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/13/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_07_12_business_att-customers-massive-breach", "text": "The call and text message records from mid-to-late 2022 of tens of millions of AT&T cellphone customers and many non-AT&T customers were exposed in a massive data breach, the telecom company revealed Friday. AT&T said the compromised data includes the telephone numbers of \u201cnearly all\u201d of its cellular customers and the customers of wireless providers that use its network between May 1, 2022 and October 31, 2022. The stolen logs also contain a record of every number AT&T customers called or texted \u2013 including customers of other wireless networks \u2013 the number of times they interacted, and the call duration. Importantly, AT&T said the stolen data did not include the contents of calls and text messages nor the time of those communications. The records of a \u201cvery small number\u201d of customers from January 2, 2023, were also implicated, AT&T said. \u201cWe have an ongoing investigation into the AT&T breach and we\u2019re coordinating with our law enforcement partners,\u201d the FCC said on social media platform X. The company\u00a0blamed\u00a0an \u201cillegal download\u201d on a third-party cloud platform that it learned about in April \u2013 just as the company was grappling with an\u00a0unrelated major data leak. AT&T says that the exposed data is not believed to be publicly available, however CNN was unable to independently verify that assertion. AT&T spokesperson Alex Byers told CNN that this was an entirely new incident that had \u201cno connection in any way\u201d to another incident disclosed in March. At that time, AT&T said personal information such as Social Security numbers on 73 million current and former customers was released onto the dark web. \u201cWe sincerely regret this incident occurred and remain committed to protecting the information in our care,\u201d the company said in a statement about the latest breach. AT&T listed approximately 110 million wireless subscribers as of the end of 2022. AT&T said international calls were not included in the stolen data, with the exception of calls to Canada. The breach also included AT&T landline customers who interacted with those cell numbers. AT&T said that contents of the calls or texts, personal information such as Social Security numbers, dates of birth, or customer names were not exposed in this incident, however the company acknowledged that publicly available tools can often link names with specific phone numbers. Additionally, AT&T said that for an undisclosed subset of its records, one or more cell site identification numbers linked to the calls and texts were also exposed. Such data could reveal the broad geographic location of one or more of the parties. AT&T believes that at least one person involved in the cybercriminal incident is in custody, the company said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The FBI declined to comment when asked about that statement. AT&T promised to notify current and former customers whose information was involved and provide them resources to protect their information. Usage details such as the time of calls and text messages were not compromised either. But AT&T spokesperson Byers told CNN that the number of calls and text messages, and total call durations for specific days or months were exposed. That means the data would not identify precisely when one phone number called another but could reveal how often two parties called each other \u2013 and how long they spoke for \u2013 on specific days. AT&T said it learned on April 19 that a \u201cthreat actor claimed to have unlawfully accessed and copied AT&T call logs.\u201d The company said it \u201cimmediately\u201d hired experts and a subsequent investigation determined hackers had exfiltrated files between April 14 and April 25. Justice Department delays public disclosure The company said the US Department of Justice Department determined in May and in June that a delay in public disclosure was warranted. The FBI said AT&T reached out shortly after learning about the hack, but the agency wanted to review the data for potential national security or public safety risks. \u201cIn assessing the nature of the breach, all parties discussed a potential delay to public reporting\u2026 due to potential risks to national security and/or public safety,\u201d the FBI said in a statement. \u201cAT&T, FBI, and DOJ worked collaboratively through the first and second delay process, all while sharing key threat intelligence to bolster FBI investigative equities and to assist AT&T\u2019s incident response work.\u201d This appears to be the first cyber incident in which the Justice Department has asked a company to delay filing a disclosure with the SEC because of potential national security or public safety concerns. \u201cThis is very concerning. This information is very valuable to cyber criminals and to nation-states,\u201d Sanaz Yashar, co-founder and CEO of cybersecurity firm Zafran, told CNN. Yashar, previously an Israeli cyber spy, said threat actors can correlate the cell ID data with other information readily available to pinpoint where someone works \u2013 including at sensitive locations like the White House and Pentagon. \u201cYou don\u2019t need the timestamp. If someone is there everyday, you can understand they work there and their routine. This is very secret information and a way that spies do stuff.\u201d Justin Sherman, founder of Global Cyber Strategies, a consultancy, also put the potential threat in stark terms. \u201cMetadata about who\u2019s communicating with who, at massive scale, enables someone to map connections between people \u2014 think journalists and sources, intelligence officers and their contacts, married people and those with whom they\u2019re having an affair,\u201d Sherman told CNN. Jason Hogg, a former FBI special agent who is now executive-in-residence at Great Hill Partners, said the cell site data is \u201cquite significant because it could allow bad actors to determine certain consumers\u2019 geolocation, which could be used to make the social engineering attacks more believable.\u201d AT&T shares fell 1% on Friday following the news. In the new incident, AT&T told CNN it learned in April that customer data was illegally downloaded from its workspace on Snowflake, a third-party cloud platform. AT&T is only the latest major company to have data stolen via access to their Snowflake platform. Ticketmaster and Santander Bank have also recently disclosed massive data breaches linked to Snowflake. Mandiant, a Google-owned cybersecurity firm, has notified at least 165 organizations that they may have been affected by the hacking spree. Mandiant analysts said they have \u201cmoderate confidence\u201d that the hackers are based in North America and that they collaborate with an additional person in Turkey. Brad Jones, chief information security officer at Snowflake, told CNN in a separate statement that the company has not found evidence this activity was \u201ccaused by a vulnerability, misconfiguration or breach of Snowflake\u2019s platform.\u201d Jones said this has been verified by investigations by third-party cybersecurity experts at Mandiant and CrowdStrike. AT&T said it launched an investigation, hired cybersecurity experts and took steps to close the \u201cillegal access point.\u201d This story has been updated with additional context and developments.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/12/business/att-customers-massive-breach/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/13/2024", "section": "us"}}

{"id": "2024_07_10_us_alec-baldwin-rust-shooting-trial", "text": "Opening statements began Wednesday in the involuntary manslaughter trial of actor Alec Baldwin, nearly three years after cinematographer Halyna Hutchins was fatally shot on the New Mexico set of the Western film \u201cRust.\u201d Prosecutor Erlinda Johnson focused on Baldwin\u2019s reckless behavior on set, saying he violated the \u201ccardinal rules of firearm safety\u201d by pointing a gun at a person and pulling the trigger. She also said the evidence would show the firearm was in \u201cperfect order\u201d and did not malfunction. \u201cWhen someone plays make-believe with a real gun in a real-life workplace, and while playing make-believe with that gun violates the cardinal rules of firearm safety, people\u2019s lives are endangered and someone could be killed,\u201d she told jurors. \u201cThe evidence will show that someone who played make-believe with a real gun and violated the cardinal rules of firearm safety is the defendant, Alexander Baldwin.\u201d In contrast, the defense blamed the film\u2019s armorer and the first assistant director \u2013 jointly in charge of firearm safety on set \u2013 for allowing a real bullet to be loaded into the prop gun and failing to make it safe before it reached Baldwin. \u201cThis was an unspeakable tragedy, but Alec Baldwin committed no crime. He was an actor, acting, playing the role of Harlan Rust. An actor playing a character can do things that are lethal,\u201d attorney Alex Spiro said. \u201cThese \u2018cardinal rules\u2019 are not cardinal rules on a movie set.\u201d After opening statements, four law enforcement officers who responded to the \u201cRust\u201d set or handled evidence testified about their roles in the investigation. Baldwin has pleaded not guilty to a felony charge of involuntary manslaughter in connection with the death of 42-year-old Hutchins. If convicted, he could face up to 18 months in prison. The trial stems from the\u00a0fatal shooting\u00a0on October 21, 2021, inside a makeshift church at the Bonanza Creek ranch as the cast and crew rehearsed a scene for the film \u201cRust.\u201d Baldwin was practicing a \u201ccross draw\u201d \u2013 pulling a gun from a holster on the opposite side of his body from his draw hand \u2013 with a prop gun when it fired a live round, killing Hutchins and injuring director Joel Souza. The shocking death was the first of its kind since the 1993 death of\u00a0actor Brandon Lee, the son of martial arts icon Bruce Lee, who was killed in the filming of \u201cThe Crow\u201d when his co-star fired a prop gun containing a fragment of a bullet. Twelve jurors and four alternates were empaneled Tuesday for the Baldwin\u2019s trial in Sante Fe. The trial is expected to last for about two weeks. This is the third criminal case related to the on-set shooting. In March, Hannah Gutierrez Reed, the armorer for \u201cRust,\u201d was\u00a0found guilty of involuntary manslaughter and sentenced to 18 months in prison. Dave Halls, the assistant director, agreed to plead no contest to negligent use of a deadly weapon, the\u00a0district attorney for New Mexico\u2019s First Judicial District said. The terms of that deal included six months of probation\u00a0and a suspended sentence, prosecutors said. Dueling narratives from prosecution and defense On set that fatal day, Gutierrez Reed loaded a prop six-shot revolver with what\u00a0she\u2019s said she believed were \u201cdummy\u201d rounds, a term for ammo that contains no explosive elements but appear to be real, according to investigators and her defense attorney. After a lunch break, Halls fetched the prop gun from a cart outside the church and yelled \u201ccold gun,\u201d indicating it was safe. He then handed the gun to Baldwin. Baldwin then practiced the \u201ccross draw\u201d move and pointed the gun toward the camera, helmed by Hutchins, Souza and a camera operator. Suddenly, they heard a loud bang. Hutchins, who was shot in her torso, was transported by helicopter to the hospital and later pronounced dead. Souza, who was hit in the shoulder, was treated at the hospital, and a projectile from a live round was removed from his back. In opening statements, prosecutors said Baldwin did not follow appropriate safety rules on set, even before the fatal shooting. When he fired a gun, he did not do a safety check, Johnson alleged. He also used the gun to point at things, cocked the hammer when he was not supposed to and put his finger on the trigger when he was not supposed to, according to Johnson. Forensic testing of the firearm showed that the gun did not malfunction, she alleged. \u201cAfter the shooting, Baldwin began to claim he did not pull the trigger,\u201d she said. \u201cThe evidence will show, ladies and gentlemen, that\u2019s not possible.\u201d \u201cHe pointed the gun at another human being, cocked the hammer and pulled that trigger, in reckless disregard for Ms. Hutchins\u2019 safety,\u201d she said. Baldwin\u00a0has previously stated to CNN\u00a0that he did not pull the trigger during the fatal shooting, though he said he did cock the hammer of the gun. \u201cI never took a gun and pointed\u00a0at somebody and clicked the thing,\u201d Baldwin said in the 2022 interview. In the defense\u2019s opening statements, Spiro said the prosecution\u2019s attempt to prove Baldwin pulled the trigger did not make him guilty of homicide. The key to the fatal shooting was that others had loaded the prop gun with a live bullet and had cleared it as safe before the gun reached Baldwin. The prop gun was later damaged during unnecessary testing from the prosecution and investigators, hindering the evidence in the case, Spiro said. Further, Spiro played a video from the scene in question, in which Baldwin pulls a gun with the camera up close. In the video, he is in continual discussion with people off-camera about how to position himself and how to \u201cwhip out\u201d the gun. \u201cThere\u2019s no danger. They wanted him to do it again,\u201d Spiro said. Law enforcement officers testify on investigation After opening statements, four law enforcement investigators testified about their interactions with those on set and the chain of custody of the prop gun and rounds. The first witness was Nicholas Lefleur, a former deputy with the Santa Fe Sheriff\u2019s Office, who responded to the \u201cRust\u201d set after the shooting and spoke briefly with Baldwin. \u201cI was holding the gun, yeah,\u201d\u00a0Baldwin said when Lefleur approached him, according to body-camera video played in court. The deputy pulled Baldwin aside and told him not to speak to other people because they could all be witnesses, according to the video. However, the video shows Baldwin and other crew members continuing to discuss what happened in the shooting. On cross-examination, Lefleur acknowledged he did not repeat his order or tell Baldwin to get away from other people. Timoteo Benavidez, a former lieutenant with the Santa Fe County Sheriff\u2019s Office, testified about his visit to the set shortly after the shooting. He obtained the prop gun used in the shooting from Gutierrez Reed and then put it into his vehicle and locked the door, he testified. The gun did not have any rounds in it when he examined it, he said. Santa Fe County sheriff\u2019s Deputy Joseph Lujan testified he went to the hospital after the shooting and retrieved a projectile that doctors removed from Souza\u2019s shoulder. Finally, Marissa Poppell, a crime scene technician with the sheriff\u2019s office, testified she sent the prop gun to the FBI for a firearm functioning test to make sure it was in \u201cproper working order.\u201d When the firearm came back from the FBI, the cylinder had been removed and a small internal component was in a separate plastic bag, she testified. Five live rounds and one spent casing were found on set, she said. The long path to trial The case has been marked by years-long fits and starts with turnovers in prosecutors, a prosecution stalled by questions surrounding the integrity of evidence and a steady spate of motions from Baldwin\u2019s team attempting to get the charge thrown out. In the run-up to Baldwin\u2019s trial, the judge denied multiple defense motions seeking to throw out the case. Baldwin\u2019s attorneys had accused prosecutors of misconduct during the grand jury process; had argued the shooting death of Hutchins was an accident and Baldwin was not criminally liable; and had claimed the gun used in the shooting was destroyed during forensic testing by the FBI and the defense could not attempt to recreate the examination. Baldwin\u2019s prosecution was initially led by New Mexico First Judicial District Attorney\u00a0Mary Carmack-Altwies, a Democrat who later stepped aside, leaving the work to special prosecutors. One special prosecutor, Andrea Reeb, who also serves as a Republican state legislator, subsequently resigned from the case after Baldwin\u2019s legal team moved to\u00a0have her disqualified,\u00a0citing constitutional questions about a lawmaker working for the prosecution. Controversy surrounding Reeb later escalated after the New York Times\u00a0obtained communications\u00a0between Reeb and Carmack-Altwies following her hiring, in which the GOP lawmaker joked that serving on the team prosecuting Baldwin could help her political campaign. Reeb did not respond to a request for comment by the Times. In April 2023, special prosecutors\u00a0dismissed an involuntary manslaughter charge against Baldwin, citing \u201cnew facts\u201d in the case. But in October,\u00a0prosecutors said\u00a0\u201cadditional facts have come to light,\u201d and Baldwin was\u00a0indicted by a grand jury\u00a0in January on two counts of involuntary manslaughter. Prosecutors initially sought to argue in court that Baldwin\u2019s\u00a0role as a producer also opened him up to potential liability for the alleged culture\u00a0of unsafe practices on the\u00a0set. However, in a significant victory for the defense, Judge Mary Marlowe Sommer ruled on Monday that Baldwin\u2019s producer role will not be considered at trial.

{"id": "2024_07_12_us_on-nyc-beaches-angry-birds-fight-drones-patrolling-for-sharks-and-struggling-swimmers-ap", "text": "A fleet of drones patrolling New York City\u2019s beaches for signs of sharks and struggling swimmers is drawing backlash from an aggressive group of seaside residents: local shorebirds. Since the drones began flying in May, flocks of birds have repeatedly swarmed the devices, forcing the police department and other city agencies to adjust their flight plans. While the attacks have slowed, they have not stopped completely, fueling concern from wildlife experts about the impact on threatened species nesting along the coast. Veronica  Welsh, a wildlife coordinator at the Parks Department, said the birds  were \u201cvery annoyed by the drones\u201d from the moment they arrived on the  beach. \u201cThey will fly at it, they\u2019ll swoop at it, they\u2019ll be  vocalizing,\u201d Welsh said. \u201cThey think they\u2019re defending their chicks from  a predator.\u201d No birds have been harmed, but officials say there have been several close calls. The drones, which come equipped with inflatable life rafts that can be dropped on distressed swimmers, have yet to conduct any rescues. They spotted their first shark on Thursday, resulting in a closure of most of the beach. City officials said the \u201cswarming incidents\u201d have been primarily carried out by American oystercatchers. The shorebird, known for its striking orange bill, lays its eggs this time of year in the sand on Rockaway Beach. While its population has improved in recent decades, federal authorities consider the species a \u201chigh conservation concern.\u201d The birds eventually may grow habituated to the devices, which can stretch over 3 feet (nearly a meter) long and emit a loud hum as they take flight, said David Bird, a professor of wildlife biology at McGill University. But he was quick to raise a far more dire possibility: that the  drones could prompt a stress response in some birds that causes them to  flee the beach and abandon their eggs, as several thousand elegant terns  did following a recent drone crash in San Diego. \u201cWe don\u2019t know a lot about what sort of distance is required to protect the birds,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we do know there are birds on this beach that are highly endangered. If they abandon their nests because of the drones, that would be a disaster.\u201d On Rockaway Beach, a popular summertime destination for New Yorkers, American oystercatchers share their habitat with multiple tern species of water birds, as well as piping plovers, a small, sand-colored bird that is the city\u2019s only federally designated endangered species. Local officials closely monitor the plovers each summer, barring beachgoers \u2014 and drones \u2014 from the stretches of sand where they primarily nest. The city\u2019s Emergency  Management Department, which also flies drones over the beach, flagged  the coastal conflict last month to other drone operators in the police  and fire department, who agreed to launch the devices further from  oystercatcher nesting areas. \u201cWe pointed out that there\u2019s a nest  here and there\u2019s two angry parents who don\u2019t want you anywhere near  their eggs or their babies,\u201d said Natalie Grybauskas, the agency\u2019s  assistant commissioner. Since then, agencies have been holding briefings on the issue, a departure from their usual work on disasters like fires and building collapses. \u201cIt\u2019s rare that you have to learn about the life cycles of baby birds,\u201d Grybauskas said. But even after the city adjusted its flight range, beachgoers said they witnessed groups of birds rushing at the drones. New York City is not alone turning to drones to patrol its waters. Following a spate of shark bites last summer, a similar effort  was launched by officials on Long Island. Those devices are smaller and  quieter and do not have flotation devices. In recent years, lifeguards  in Australia also have used drones to monitor sharks and to conduct  rescue operations. New York City Mayor Eric Adams, a devoted drone enthusiast,  has touted the new drone program as a \u201cgreat addition to saving the  lives of those that we lose over the summer,\u201d especially as the city  struggles to hire lifeguards to staff its beaches. Four people have drowned off city beaches this summer, matching the total number of swimming deaths from last year. After two teenagers disappeared while swimming off a beach adjacent to Rockaway, the NYPD flew its drones as part of the search mission. Both bodies eventually washed up on the shoreline. The fire department\u2019s drones also have captured footage of lifeguards assisting swimmers on Rockaway Beach struggling in a rip tide. Christopher  Allieri, founder of the NYC Plover Project, a bird protection group,  praised the city for taking an innovative approach to water safety. But  he stressed additional precautions were necessary to ensure the drones  weren\u2019t harming the shorebird population. \u201cWildlife in New York  is often an afterthought,\u201d he said. \u201cWe should be asking ourselves how  we can use this technology in a way that works for all New Yorkers, and  that includes those with feathers.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/12/us/on-nyc-beaches-angry-birds-fight-drones-patrolling-for-sharks-and-struggling-swimmers-ap/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/13/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_07_12_economy_us-producer-price-index-inflation-june", "text": "Wholesale price inflation unexpectedly accelerated in June to its highest rate since March 2023, according to new data released Friday. On the surface, the jump in PPI appears to be an unwelcome development for the US economy and the fight to rein in high inflation \u2014 and it appears especially jarring landing one day after the BLS announced that consumer prices fell on a monthly basis for the first time in four years. However, economists caution that monthly data \u2014 and especially the category that drove PPI higher in June \u2014 can be erratic, and that the unexpected jump in PPI isn\u2019t likely a worrisome sign of any broader inflation pressures building in the pipeline. The June increase was attributed to a sharp rise in final demand services, specifically trade services margins, which soared 1.9% from May and offset lower energy prices and still-falling goods production prices. It\u2019s the largest monthly increase for trade services since March 2022. \u201cThe increase was broad-based among wholesalers and retailers of fuel, autos and other goods, but almost certainly is\u00a0not the start of a resurgence in margins,\u201d Ian Shepherdson, chairman and chief economist for Pantheon Macroeconomics, wrote in a note to clients on Friday. \u201cThe data are volatile and often revised a lot. Margins will come under increasing\u00a0pressure as growth in consumers\u2019 spending continues to slow.\u201d Economists had expected that prices would increase 0.1% on a monthly basis and hold steady at 2.2% annually. Looking past the volatility and at the \u2018core core\u2019 PPI often is looked to as a potential bellwether for retail-level inflation in the months ahead. Increased margins make the public think of corporate greed and higher costs that are being passed along to consumers by middlemen that are making a profit along the way, said Chris Rupkey, chief economist with FwdBonds. \u201cIt does not sound good, but we don\u2019t think consumers are getting ready to be hit by a new surge in price increases just because margins are going up,\u201d Rupkey wrote in an email reply to a CNN Business query. \u201cThese margins are notoriously difficult to measure, and wholesalers do have their own costs to cover.\u201d When stripping out energy and food-related prices, core PPI jumped 0.4% for the month, rising 3% annually, its highest rate since April 2023. However, to better eliminate the influence of the volatile trade services, economists also look at a \u201ccore core\u201d reading, Andreas Hauskrecht, clinical professor of business economics, at Indiana University\u2019s Kelley School of Business, said in an interview. \u201cSo the \u2018core core\u2019 is without energy, without food and without the trade, because we think this is volatility and pricing that has no direct link with monetary policy, and we try to clean up the data so that we really see a trend,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd so I wouldn\u2019t stress too much about the trade index.\u201d In June, the PPI excluding energy, food and trade was flat for the month and on an annual basis slowed to 3.1% from 3.3% in May, BLS data show. Inflation still \u2018dying on the vine\u2019 For US consumers, inflation has been trending in a desired direction during the past couple of months. Despite a brief flare-up of price hikes in the first quarter of the year, which ultimately delayed the Federal Reserve\u2019s plans for interest rate cuts, inflation has cooled considerably during the following three months. On Thursday, the US economy got more good news in the latest Consumer Price Index, the most widely used inflation gauge that measures the average price changes for commonly purchased goods and services. Prices dropped on a monthly basis for the first time since May 2020, and annual inflation slowed to 3%, its slowest rate since June 2023. The June PPI doesn\u2019t reflect a shift in inflation\u2019s slowing trajectory, Rupkey said. \u201cWe think core [Personal Consumption Expenditures] inflation for June is still likely to be either unchanged or the same modest 0.1% increase it was in May,\u201d he said, referencing a closely watched inflation gauge. \u201cInflation still looks to be dying on the vine in large part because commodities and goods price increases have moderated.\u201d The Fed bases its 2% target on the headline PCE index and has increasingly scrutinized the core PCE index for underlying inflationary trends. Energy-heavy transportation and warehousing operations saw prices fall in the early and final purchasing stages of their business, PPI data showed. That indicates that supply-side pressures are easing, Kurt Rankin, senior economist with PNC Financial Services, wrote Thursday. \u201cThe downward-trending energy PPI pace, which lies at the root of all price pressures in the US economy, implies that the second half of 2024 will see diminishing cost pressures from producers\u2019 own energy bills, as well as the cost of shipping goods to retailers,\u201d Rankin wrote.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/12/economy/us-producer-price-index-inflation-june/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/13/2024", "section": "us"}}

AT&T said Friday that data was breached from \u201cnearly all\u201d of its cellular customers and the customers of wireless providers that used its network between May 1, 2022, and October 31, 2022. The records of a \u201cvery small number\u201d of customers from January 2, 2023, were also breached, AT&T said. The company\u00a0blamed\u00a0an \u201cillegal download\u201d on a third-party cloud platform that it learned about in April \u2014 just as AT&T was grappling with an\u00a0unrelated major data leak. AT&T listed approximately 110 million wireless subscribers as of the end of 2022.\u00a0Here\u2019s what that means for the millions of Americans that use AT&T\u2019s cellular service. What\u2019s at risk Hackers did not get any names, addresses or Social Security numbers. What they did get is metadata \u2014 call logs that contain a record of every number AT&T customers called or texted (including customers of other wireless networks), the number of times they interacted and the call duration. A cybercriminal could now identify relationships among phone numbers, a useful data point for hackers trying to make their scams more believable. For example, a hacker could see that a customer is in constant contact with a big bank\u2019s line and could send a phishing attempt posing as the bank. The hacker could text the customer saying, \u201cThis is Bank of America. We have some suspicious activity on your account. Click this link to review the charges, or call this number,\u201d said John Dwyer, director of security research at Binary Defense, a cybersecurity solutions firm. Or the hacker could pose as someone the customer has a personal relationship with, like a friend or family member. The age of artificial intelligence makes this even more pressing, according to Collin Walke, cybersecurity and data privacy partner at Hall Estill. \u201cOnce they know who you\u2019ve been communicating with, it allows deep fakes and those sorts of hacks to occur much easier,\u201d Walke said. Some customers\u2019 cell tower ID numbers were also exposed, which could help some bad actors track down geolocations, Walke said. That could also make these hacking attempts more believable. What customers should do Cellphone users should always be careful about phishing and other scam attempts, especially as hackers become more and more sophisticated. But AT&T customers should be hypersensitive to phone calls and text messages where they\u2019re being asked to do things like call a number, click a link or transfer money. That includes requests from what appears to be a number that you normally communicate with, Dwyer said. \u201cIf someone calls or texts you and asks you to do something, make sure you call them back to verify that it\u2019s actually them,\u201d Dwyer said. Of course, without stricter cybersecurity regulation, there isn\u2019t much customers can do to protect against data breaches. That responsibility lies with the federal government and giant telecom companies, which experts say widely go unchecked. \u201cI don\u2019t think we should have an expectation that everyday Americans should be on the front lines of defending themselves for making sure the businesses they interact with have mandatory minimum cybersecurity in place,\u201d Eric Noonan, CEO of cybersecurity provider CyberSheath said.

{"id": "2024_07_10_us_dartmouth-student-death-won-jang", "text": "The hourslong disappearance, then confirmed death of a Dartmouth College fraternity member has police investigating the case as a possible hazing incident. The Ivy League school has suspended the 20-year-old\u2019s Greek organization, as well as a sorority. Won Jang, a member of Beta Alpha Omega, had last been seen by friends around 9:30 p.m., Saturday, at an informal social gathering at docks near the Dartmouth boathouse on the Connecticut River, the New Hampshire Fish and Game Department said in a news release. When he didn\u2019t show up for an event the next day, authorities were notified, the agency said. Items found near the dock indicated Jang hadn\u2019t left the river area, which authorities searched while divers checked the water. About 3 1/2 hours after Jang was reported missing, his body was found in the Connecticut River by an underwater camera not far from the dock where he last was seen, the department said. While a cause of death remains unclear, the school forwarded to the nearby Hanover Police Department anonymous emails indicating hazing or alcohol may have contributed to Jang\u2019s death, Hanover Police Chief Charlie Dennis said during a Monday news conference. \u201cCertainly this is a tragic event,\u201d he said, asking anyone with information to come forward to help with the investigation. Hanover Police did not immediately reply to CNN\u2019s request for more information about the case. Jang had been a member of Dartmouth\u2019s chapter of Beta Alpha Omega, according to the college and his profile on the fraternity\u2019s website, which has been taken down. As Hanover police investigate his death, Dartmouth suspended the Beta Alpha Omega fraternity, along with the Alpha Phi sorority, college spokesperson Morgan Kelly told CNN on Wednesday. Kelly would not say what role the fraternity or sorority played relative to the investigation into Jang\u2019s death. \u201cWe aren\u2019t able to provide details on an ongoing investigation, but we can say that at the time of the incident, Beta Alpha Omega was on alcohol probation following a fall-, winter- and spring-term suspension. Alpha Phi was placed on alcohol probation during the fall 2023 term and then returned to good standing,\u201d Kelly added. Beta Alpha Omega\u2019s local chapter and Alpha Phi\u2019s national organization did not immediately respond to CNN\u2019s requests for comment. Jang\u2019s death and the police probe follow a spate of hazing deaths in recent years on or near US college campuses that have led variously to suspensions, expulsions, criminal charges and scrutiny of university oversight of fraternities and sororities. Seventy-three percent of students in US fraternities and sororities experienced what they called some form of hazing at least once, according to a\u00a0University of Maine study\u00a0released in 2008, the most recent available for such research. Jang\u2019s death comes nearly two months after another Dartmouth student\u2019s body was found in the Connecticut River after she was reported missing, CNN affiliate WMUR reported. Their deaths do not appear to be connected. An \u2018amazing guy\u2019 who was always smiling Jang had been studying biomedical engineering and economics at Dartmouth and worked part-time at the school\u2019s DALI Lab, a startup-like experiential learning program where students work in teams of designers and developers, according to his LinkedIn profile. \u201cWon wholeheartedly embraced opportunities at Dartmouth to pursue his academic and personal passions,\u201d Dean Scott C. Brown wrote on a site memorializing school community members who have died. \u201cWe are in contact with Won\u2019s family and have expressed our sincere condolences at this most difficult time,\u201d he continued. Kledian Marinaj, a friend of Jang who recently had been trying to make plans to grab a meal with him, was upset by his death, he told CNN affiliate WMUR. \u201cWon was always an amazing guy,\u201d Marinaj said. \u201cI don\u2019t think there was ever a time when I didn\u2019t see him with a smile on his face.\u201d Jang had been his high school valedictorian in Middletown, Delaware, according to his LinkedIn profile and YouTube recording of the graduation ceremony. During an introduction to his speech at commencement, he was praised by an administrator for his wit, humility and motivation.

{"id": "2024_07_12_politics_biden-pod-save-america-hosts", "text": "Two co-hosts of the \u201cPod Save America\u201d podcast on Friday fired back at Biden campaign staffers who have reportedly dismissed their calls for the president to consider stepping down from the Democratic ticket. In an episode released Friday, Dan Pfeiffer called it \u201cinfuriating\u201d to think that he and co-host Jon Favreau, both former Barack Obama aides, are questioning whether Joe Biden can win out of \u201cpersonal animus.\u201d It\u2019s the latest episode of Democratic infighting since the president\u2019s disastrous debate performance in June kicked off a flurry of calls for the president to withdraw. \u201cThe incompetence of spending your time fighting \u2018Pod Save America,\u2019 David Axelrod, George Clooney, and the most popular figure in the Democratic Party at a time when you were struggling with Black voters is f**king insane,\u201d Pfeiffer said, referring to Obama. A New York Times report Wednesday described Biden\u2019s advisers as dismissing the \u201cPod Save America\u201d co-hosts as \u201coperatives who worked for a cerebral, cool-guy president and never understood the world according to the scrappy kid from Scranton.\u201d Favreau said that Biden\u2019s team has \u201cbigger f**king fish to fry.\u201d \u201cWhat are you spending time on us for? Go f**king just beat Donald Trump or \u2026 help your candidate be on message,\u201d he said. The Democratic Party continues to wrestle with not only Biden\u2019s reelection bid but also its ability to hurt the party in down-ballot races. More than a dozen House Democrats and one Democratic senator have asked the president to step aside. Meanwhile, many anxious Democratic donors are withholding big checks, and George Clooney, one of Biden\u2019s biggest supporters, publicly called for him to bow out earlier this week. The president, for his part, has vowed to continue. Speaking at a high-stakes news conference on Thursday, Biden promised to make his case and \u201cpersuade people to move our way or people are already there.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m determined on running, but I think it\u2019s important that I allay fears by seeing \u2014 letting them see me out there,\u201d Biden said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/12/politics/biden-pod-save-america-hosts/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/13/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_07_12_us_what-we-know-dvontaye-mitchell-death", "text": "D\u2019Vontaye Mitchell was his mother\u2019s \u201cbig teddy bear,\u201d who enjoyed music, cooking and art, and was a beloved brother, uncle and father of two. Mitchell, 43, died on June 30, after he was pinned down by hotel security guards outside a Hyatt Regency in Milwaukee in an incident partially captured on video. Hotel employees have been fired since the incident, and police have referred four charges of felony murder in Mitchell\u2019s death, Milwaukee Police said in a statement to CNN Friday, while an ongoing homicide investigation is underway and the full results of the autopsy are pending. The encounter comes as the\u00a0use of force\u00a0\u2013 particularly\u00a0against people of color\u00a0\u2013\u00a0by police and others in authority roles remains under scrutiny nearly four years after\u00a0protests flared nationwide\u00a0following the murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer. It\u2019s unclear what led up to Mitchell\u2019s encounter with the security guards, how long it took officers to arrive on the scene and what Mitchell was doing at the hotel. Here\u2019s what we know about Mitchell, the incident and what witness video shows: What witness video shows (and doesn\u2019t show) Police allege Mitchell \u201ccaused a disturbance,\u201d prompting security guards to escort him out of the hotel,\u00a0according to\u00a0a statement\u00a0from civil rights attorney Ben Crump, who represents the Mitchell family. Security guards and others then pinned Mitchell to the ground, part of a video posted on social media shows Mitchell grunting and pleading with the guards, repeatedly saying \u201cplease\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d It\u2019s unclear what part of the incident witness video captured, what led up to this moment and what happened in the moments after. One guard, who appears to be White, can be heard saying, \u201cStay down,\u201d and \u201cStop fighting,\u201d as the others, who appear to be people of color, hold Mitchell down, the video shows. The same guard calls out to witnesses, \u201cThis is what happens when you go into the ladies room.\u201d Hotel operator fires \u2018hotel associates\u2019 involved It\u2019s unclear how many \u201chotel associates\u201d were fired and if they include the security guards involved in the Mitchell incident. Those security guards initially were suspended as Aimbridge Hospitality, which operates the downtown hotel, completed its investigation, a Hyatt spokesperson told CNN on Monday. \u201cThe conduct we saw from several associates on June 30 violated our policies and procedures, and does not reflect our values as an organization or the behaviors we expect from our associates,\u201d Aimbridge Hospitality, said Thursday in a statement about the death of D\u2019Vontaye Mitchell. \u201cFollowing review of their actions, their employment has been terminated,\u201d the statement added. \u201cWe will continue our independent investigation and do everything we can to support law enforcement with their investigation into this tragic incident.\u201d A homicide investigation is underway The local prosecutor is investigating Mitchell\u2019s death as a homicide, he said Wednesday. The district attorney\u2019s office is awaiting the full results of Mitchell\u2019s autopsy, which will help inform the police investigation into his death and allow the office to evaluate what happened before his death \u201cfrom the perspective of potential criminal liability,\u201d District Attorney John Chisholm said Wednesday in a statement. CNN has reached out to the Milwaukee County Medical Examiner\u2019s office. Police have been in consultation with the Milwaukee County District Attorney\u2019s Office since July 5 and have subsequently referred the charges to the DA, who is reviewing them, Milwaukee Police said in a Friday statement. It\u2019s unclear who those four felony charges are for and how they came to be. Crump said\u00a0the charges\u00a0would be\u00a0a \u201csignificant step toward justice\u201d that \u201cunderscore the severity of the actions that led to\u00a0D\u2019Vontaye\u2019s\u00a0sudden and untimely death.\u201d \u201cWe must now press for these charges to be formally filed by the District Attorney\u2019s Office in order for these officers to truly be held accountable,\u201d he said in a Friday statement to CNN. Crump had originally said Milwaukee Police were not considering the incident as a criminal investigation because there wasn\u2019t any evidence of \u201cblunt force.\u201d CNN has reached out to Crump\u2019s team for more information. Crump\u2019s office obtained an affidavit from an unidentified hotel employee who claimed he reluctantly helped hold down Mitchell after being ordered to do so by a security guard, the attorney said. Crump said he would turn the document over to prosecutors but did not release it publicly. How loved ones remember his big heart Mitchell\u2019s mother, Brenda Giles, said her eldest son was a jolly and outgoing brother, uncle and father who loved his family, she told\u00a0WTMJ. \u201cEverybody that knows him, to know him is to love him, they know,\u201d his sister, Nayisha Mitchell, told the station. \u201cThey knew he was a good person.\u201d Mitchell was known for his creativity in the kitchen, according to his obituary, which was read during Thursday\u2019s funeral. \u201cThe man could turn a can of ravioli into a gourmet meal,\u201d the obituary said. \u201cHe loved to dance, and he was harmless,\u201d Giles told reporters Wednesday. \u201cI always called him my big teddy bear.\u201d Mitchell enjoyed expressing himself through art and music. He had a love for drawing, singing, gospel music, dancing and writing original rap lyrics, his obituary read. \u201cHe also had an insatiable love of knowledge, which he fed through his love of documentaries,\u201d it continued. \u201cD\u2019Vontaye was an avid family man who filled his time visiting his kids and family and he lit up every face with joy when he entered the room.\u201d \u201cHe was known as the person to go to for help, because his big heart would seldom allow him to say no.\u201d When Mitchell\u2019s father passed away in 2016, Mitchell fell into depression, his family told WTMJ. Giles believes her son was suffering from a mental health episode at the time of the incident,\u00a0according to Crump. \u201cTo see him go out this world the way he did, that was devastating. That would never leave my mind, that\u2019s going to live with me for the rest of my life,\u201d Giles, told reporters Wednesday.

{"id": "2024_07_11_us_arizona-hot-car-girl-death", "text": "A 2-year-old Arizona girl died after her father left her asleep in a car during a heat wave on Tuesday, police said. An initial investigation indicates the toddler\u2019s father arrived home while she was asleep in the car, and he left her there with the vehicle running and the air conditioner on while he went inside his home, according to police in Marana, located just outside Tucson. Her mother eventually arrived home, and shortly afterward the child was discovered unresponsive inside the car, which was no longer running and had the air conditioning off, police said. Someone called 911, and firefighters and Marana police arrived shortly after 4 p.m., police said. The girl was left in the car for about 30 minutes to an hour before she was found, police told CNN affiliate KNXV. Resuscitation efforts were done on the child and she was transported to a hospital, where she was pronounced dead, according to police. Marana police detectives were granted a search warrant Tuesday night and an investigation into the death is ongoing, police said. \u201cWe are doing our interviews with the dad, any witnesses, neighbors, to determine if the car was still running, if the AC was still operational,\u201d Marana police Capt. Tim Brunenkant told CNN affiliate KPNX. \u201cAll we know is it was a hot car and the child was unresponsive, it was very hot, and it\u2019s very tragic.\u201d Afternoon air temperatures in the Marana area on Tuesday ranged from 102 to 108 degrees, according to\u00a0the National Weather Service. Much of the western and southern US has been experiencing a long-lasting heat wave that has led to numerous daily high temperature records and\u00a0caused deaths. In Omaha, Nebraska, police say they are investigating the death of a 5-year-old boy after they found the child Wednesday unresponsive inside of a vehicle. It appeared he had been left there for an extended period of time, police said. The area\u2019s high temperature that day was 89 degrees, according to the National Weather Service. Ten children have died as a result of being in a hot vehicle in the US this year, according to\u00a0NoHeatStroke.org, a website that tracks hot car deaths and is run by a San Jose State University lecturer. Since 1998, 44 children have died from vehicular heatstroke in Arizona, according to the National Safety Council. On average, 37 children under the age of 15 die each year from heatstroke after being left in a hot vehicle, the council says. In 2023, 29 child hot car deaths were reported in the US, according to the council. Since 1998, the highest annual number of children known to have died after being left in a hot vehicle was 53, recorded in both 2018 and 2019, according to the council. A child\u2019s body temperature rises three to five times faster than an adult\u2019s, and children can die when their body temperature reaches 107 degrees, according to the\u00a0National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Of the pediatric heatstroke deaths reported from 1998 to 2023, about 52% happened because a caregiver forgot the child in a vehicle, according to NoHeatStroke.org, which cited media reports of the deaths.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/11/us/arizona-hot-car-girl-death/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/13/2024", "section": "us"}}
