As she waited for the cooling cross breeze, the 74-year-old recalled fondly the days when her family grew squash, corn and pumpkin on this property. They sought shade under its trees and had no need for electricity or other modern conveniences. \u201cThe weather,\u201d she said, \u201cit wasn\u2019t that hot.\u201d But that\u2019s all changed: The Navajo Nation last year declared an extreme heat emergency as temperatures hit well above 110 degrees in parts of the region. And the heat just keeps coming. These days, Benally barely steps outside her home. What she wants is to go outdoors more often, then return to the cool kiss of air conditioning. \u201cThat would be perfect,\u201d she said, smiling. But Benally \u2013 like 13,000 families in roughly a third of Navajo Nation households \u2013 is still off the electrical grid. Like many here, she uses solar panels to power essentials, such as a small refrigerator and a couple of light bulbs. But the power doesn\u2019t last all day. Now, as global temperatures keep rising, the rush to fully electrify one of the poorest regions in the United States is more urgent than ever. To that end, several power poles laid flat this month on Benally\u2019s land, waiting to be installed so she can connect to the power grid for the first time.\u00a0Thanks to a non-profit initiative called Light Up Navajo, 46 utility companies from 16 states are partnering this year with the Navajo Nation\u2019s utility authority to build dozens of miles of power lines under the same kind of mutual aid pacts that help restore power after natural disasters. It\u2019s no easy task in an area known for its\u00a0rugged terrain and arid climate.\u00a0But it\u2019s ever more critical to the health and safety of a community that traces its roots in the American Southwest back at least 800 years. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy that this still happens in America,\u201d said Bryan English, a crew foreman with Trico Electric Cooperative in Arizona who\u2019s working his second year in a row on the project. Connecting a home a mile from Benally\u2019s, English wiped sweat from his brow: \u201cI don\u2019t think any part of America shouldn\u2019t have electricity in 2024.\u201d Business and political factors pose obstacles Roughly the size of West Virginia, the Navajo Nation long has been rich with energy sources and production. But while private companies tapped those resources in the 20th\u00a0century to help electrify areas around the Southwest, the Navajo Nation reaped few benefits. \u201cIt\u2019s a fairly unique rural situation,\u201d said Dave Lock with the Grand Canyon State Electric Cooperative Association. \u201cA hundred years ago, when the rural electrification effort came into focus, a lot of rural areas across the country were like Navajo Nation: It wasn\u2019t profitable for the for-profit utilities to go out and bring them power because of the long distances.\u201d That changed under President Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s administration in the 1930s, when farmers banded together to create rural co-ops to power remote parts of the country, using federal loans under the Rural Electrification Act. But many Native American nations at the time were still trying to assimilate and fell behind in the electrification efforts, according to a 2023 US Energy Department report to Congress. The non-profit Navajo Tribal Utility Authority started up in 1959 to help rectify the issue, but a complex myriad of political and geographical obstacles have made it more difficult to get the nation fully on the grid. Among the hurdles, the federal government put a 40-year development ban \u2013 known as the Bennett Freeze \u2013 across roughly 1.5 million acres of Navajo land to settle a dispute between the Navajo Nation and the Hopi Tribe. The ban, lifted in 2009, barred installation of electricity and other key infrastructure. The slow, steady slog to connect households to the power grid is expensive. Today, it costs the Navajo Nation $40,000 per family, largely due to the remote, desert land. It\u2019s a massive financial challenge in an area where the average annual household income is just over $30,000, less than half the national rate. Without help from projects like Light Up Navajo,\u00a0it could cost close to $1 billion to extend electricity to all 13,000 families, tribal utility authorities estimate.\u00a0That astronomical sum \u2013 including hundreds of millions of dollars for transmission lines, electric substations and house wiring \u2013 is a huge reason other cooperatives have decided to help, their representatives said. In 2019, the Navajo Tribal Utility Authority partnered with the American Public Power Association, a non-profit industry lobbying group, to create Light Up Navajo, which so far has connected almost 850 families. But even with help from utilities across the country and groups like the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association, another trade group, it could take three more decades to run power to every household. The partnership relies on a mix of private and federal funding. Workers come out for a 13-week stretch each spring and summer to set up the connections, while the tribal utility authority works year-round to get the homes shovel-ready. The task is \u201cfar from over,\u201d said Deenise Becenti, the tribal utility authority\u2019s government and public affairs manager. But when companies volunteer manpower and services, it makes the overall mission feel within reach. \u201cIf it weren\u2019t for Light Up Navajo,\u201d she said, \u201csome of the families who\u2019ve already received electricity would still be on the waiting list for years to come.\u201d Using cars to charge phones and feel cool air Living without connected electricity had been a way of life for so many in the Navajo Nation. But with the climate changing and technology advancing, many families are signing up to get on the Light Up Navajo waiting list. Without a grid connection, residents use their vehicles to charge cell phones or get a brief taste of air conditioning. One young family in Crystal, New Mexico, with a 2-year-old and a baby on the way picks up fresh produce and meat daily from a store 45 minutes away, then cooks dinner over a campfire before the sun goes down, they said. They don\u2019t have a working refrigerator. Many families use camp-style coolers to store food, but those need constant supplies of ice, which quickly melts. Thirty miles south, Arlene Henry,\u00a056, lives on a small compound with her sisters, children and grandchildren. She planted a tree, hoping to land at least a sliver of shade on their property, but insects thwarted its potential. \u201cWe\u2019re looking for shade all the time,\u201d Henry said. Her family sits outside in the afternoons and seeks relief in the shadow of her home, moving seats around the house to hide from the roving sun. \u201cWe sometimes bring ice, but it just melts right then and there.\u201d Solar panels power the family\u2019s refrigerator, two light bulbs and the flashlights they use to get to their outhouse at night. More than anything, Henry worries about her adult son, who relies on supplemental oxygen and has trouble keeping the tank powered full-time, she said. In 90-degree heat, she recently eyed her 2-year-old granddaughter riding around on a red tricycle. The little girl enjoyed an ice pop. But after a few minutes, Henry urged her to come back to the shade. \u201cCome this way, baby, come this way,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s too hot over there.\u201d Henry clutched some framed photos of her parents and grandparents who grew up on this land and passed it down to her and her sisters. But now, the lack of electricity scares her \u2013 though she also doesn\u2019t want to leave this place that means so much. \u201cI thought it was normal,\u201d she said of growing up without electricity. \u201cBut now it\u2019s getting to me.\u201d A single bulb \u2013 and a face \u2013 light up So far this summer, Light Up Navajo has connected\u00a0125 homes with 38 miles of power lines built and a goal of connecting\u00a025 more homes by the end of July, when the rainy season starts. William Lee Tom Jr.,\u00a056, benefited from one of those new connections this summer. He\u2019s lived the past 15 years without electricity near Window Rock, Arizona, and didn\u2019t want to leave because he can afford this house and it\u2019s close to his family. Before the power hookup, Tom and his son often slept outside in his truck or in a wooden, tent-like structure when it got too hot. Once, while out on errands, his son had to go to the hospital due to dehydration, Tom said. \u201cA lot of times, it\u2019s just unbearable,\u201d he said. Power line workers with Light Up Navajo recently installed poles at Tom\u2019s property, and on June 13, they strung up the final wires to electrify his house.\u00a0The crew wore long-sleeved work shirts and white hard hats, with cloth covers draping from the back to protect their necks from the scorching sun. After a lineman flipped a few switches on a new breaker box, Tom walked inside and turned on his only light bulb \u2013 one he\u2019d just bought and installed an hour earlier. The dark room now had light, but it was the normally reserved mechanic\u2019s face that lit up even more. Surprised it actually worked, Tom let out a triumphant \u201cAlriiiiight!\u201d He paused to look around the room, joking he could now see its messy contents. \u201cWow, that\u2019s neat,\u201d Tom added. \u201cI\u2019ve seen electricity before but not in my own property.\u201d Now, he looks forward to installing an air conditioning unit.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/03/us/navajo-nation-power-grid-connection/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/08/2024", "section": "us"}}

Not a subscriber? You can sign up\u00a0right here. You can listen to an audio version of the newsletter by clicking the same link. A vast swath of the US economy is showing signs of weakness as unemployment rises to its highest point in more than two years. Consumer demand seems to have tapered off so far this summer, according to surveys of American businesses that sell any kind of service to make a profit, ranging from restaurants to dental clinics. That weakness is also evident in the latest spending figures \u2014 a far cry from last year\u2019s lucrative summertime spending spree when Americans shelled out for films and high-profile concerts. The Institute for Supply Management\u2019s latest monthly survey that gauges economic activity in the services sector showed that so-called new orders and overall economic activity unexpectedly slipped into contraction territory last month. The headline index fell to a reading of 48.8 in June from 53.8 in May as the new orders sub-index saw an even steeper decline, down to 47.3 from 54.1. (A reading above 50 indicates expansion while anything below that threshold points to a contraction.) This apparent slowdown in demand, if it persists for long enough, could translate into service-providing businesses hiring at a slower pace and possibly slashing jobs. The overwhelming majority of employment in the United States is considered service-providing, specifically 86% of the 158.6 million total US jobs as of June. \u201cWhen you think of services, a lot of it is driven by the consumer, and consumers are key to where the US economy goes,\u201d James Knightley, chief international economist at ING, told CNN. \u201cWe\u2019re starting to see stress in more and more households.\u201d The US consumer is indeed under pressure, grappling with still-high inflation, the highest interest rates in more than two decades, depleted pandemic savings (according to some measures), and a growing load of debt. Consumer spending, which makes up about 70% of the US economy, has already moderated over the past few months, government statistics show, and retailers themselves have said they\u2019ve noticed shoppers across the income spectrum change their purchasing behavior. A food services business surveyed by ISM said \u201csales and traffic remain soft compared to last year,\u201d blaming \u201chigh gas prices in California and constant news about inflation and restaurant menu prices.\u201d Spending at restaurants and bars declined 0.4% in May,\u00a0according to the latest Commerce Department figures on retail sales. A retail company told ISM: \u201cWith inflation continuing, will customers have enough discretionary funds to spend?\u201d Knightley provided CNN an analysis of government data showing that Americans in the top 20% of earners were responsible for a large share of spending on services related to transportation (air travel and cruises), recreation, food and finance. The bottom 60% of households by income accounted for a larger proportion of spending on health care services. But it takes time before slowing demand translates into slower hiring or layoffs because businesses have to determine if they didn\u2019t just deal with a bad month or two, perhaps even a bad quarter,\u00a0Scott Hamilton, global chairman of human resource and compensation consulting at Gallagher, told CNN. Service-providing businesses have already been hiring at a weaker clip. These firms have added 168,000 jobs a month, on average, from April through June, according to\u00a0fresh Labor Department data\u00a0released Friday. That\u2019s much lower than the average for the prior three months, from January through March, which was 241,000 jobs. Last year, the average monthly job gain in the services industry was 228,000 jobs. Hiring trends, of course, vary within the services sector, a huge slice of the job market. Last month, retail trade employment shrunk for the first time since November while temporary help services contracted by 48,900 jobs, dragging down the broader professional and business services super sector, which lost 17,000 workers. Health care has been one major bright spot for the services sector, adding jobs at a brisk pace for the past few decades, excluding a drop off in 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic, but even then, some businesses in that industry have recently noticed softening demand. \u201cDemand for services has moderated after near-record patient levels in the last month,\u201d a health care and social assistance firm said in the latest ISM survey. The job market staged a stunning comeback when the broader US economy recovered from the Covid-19 pandemic, eventually leading to unemployment falling to a half-century low of 3.4% in 2023 for the first time. It\u2019s loosened up recently, however, with unemployment now at 4.1%, the highest level since November 2021, and new applications for jobless benefits on an upward trend. Fed officials are keeping a close eye for any alarming signs of weakness in the job market as they await for further evidence that inflation will continue to slow without an unexpectedly hot economy sabotaging that. Tesla is now an official Chinese government car For the first time ever, Tesla cars have been placed on a Chinese government purchase list, according to state-owned media outlet\u00a0Paper.cn. Tesla is the only foreign-owned EV car brand on the purchase catalog published by the government of Jiangsu province in eastern China. The other brands mentioned include Volvo, owned by China\u2019s Geely, and state-owned SAIC, reports my colleague Laura He.That means that government agencies and public groups in the province can procure them as service cars, highlighting the\u00a0cozy relationship\u00a0China has with Elon Musk\u2019s company. The development has gone viral on Chinese social media, with some users questioning if foreign cars should be considered for use by the government. The Jiangsu government has tried to ease such concerns by saying that the Tesla model is \u201ca domestic car, not imported,\u201d according to\u00a0a report\u00a0by state-owned National Business Daily on Thursday, citing a government employee. Tesla, which has a massive gigafactory in Shanghai, manufactured some 947,000 cars in China in 2023, and most of them were used locally. Read more here.

{"id": "2024_07_05_us_san-antonio-hot-car-children-arrest", "text": "A mother who police said left her three children in a hot car in San Antonio, Texas, for nearly an hour while shopping was arrested after a good Samaritan helped rescue them from the vehicle. Officers were dispatched to the location after receiving a call from a bystander alerting them there were children inside a vehicle that was turned off, the San Antonio Police Department\u00a0said in its preliminary report. First responders discovered a 1-month-old, 2-year-old, and 4-year-old in the car. \u201cThe mother of the children (suspect) was at the scene and stated she went inside a store and did not realize how long she was gone,\u201d the department said. \u201cBased on information gathered, the children were in the car for approximately 50 minutes.\u201d Angela Garza\u2013Amador was arrested June 28 and charged with three counts of abandoning/endangering a child, according to the report. She was released on bond June 29, according to the Bexar County Sheriff\u2019s Office. It is unclear if Garza\u2013Amador has legal representation. A woman who rescued the children and took a video of the moment told CNN affiliate KENS she was walking toward a children\u2019s clothing store when she noticed a young boy in the car next to her. She said she felt her \u201cmother\u2019s instincts\u201d and decided to looked inside and found another child in the car and alerted store employees to call 911. She then tried to open the car door and found it unlocked and helped the children while waiting for first responders to arrive. \u201cThe boy, he was really sweating profusely, and you know, was crying. It seemed like he was grasping for air to me, like they were already on that verge,\u201d the woman, who wanted to remain anonymous, told KENS. \u201cA lot of parents think, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s OK, I\u2019ll be right back,\u2019 but so much can happen in that time frame.\u201d In the video, at least three women can be seen helping get the three children out of the car, including a baby from its car seat, as the three-year-old boy cries while struggling to breathe. \u201cI live across town, I hadn\u2019t been there to that store I was going to in 10 years,\u201d she added. \u201cI feel that God literally sent me over there for those kids.\u201d The temperature in the San Antonio area at the time was between 98 and 100 degrees. A National Weather Service chart comparing outside and inside-the-car temperatures showed after one hour inside a car with an outside temperature of 93 degrees, the temperature in the vehicle could reach up to 130 degrees. The children were transported to a hospital for treatment and were expected to be discharged from the hospital the same day, according to the preliminary police report. Child protective services was notified of the incident, police said. \u201cWhile details of investigations are confidential according to law, I can confirm there was no open case regarding this family when the report of this incident came in,\u201d a Texas Department of Family and Protective Services spokesperson told CNN. \u201cThe children were not placed in CPS care and were placed in the care of family.\u201d There have been at least seven hot car children\u2019s deaths in 2024, according to Kids and Car Safety, an organization researching and documenting car death data. At least 1,090 children have died in hot cars nationwide since 1990.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/05/us/san-antonio-hot-car-children-arrest/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/08/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_07_07_politics_house-democrats-biden-out", "text": "More than a handful of House Democratic ranking members told House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries in a Sunday call that President Joe Biden needs to step aside from the 2024 campaign, according to sources familiar with the call. Jeffries held the call to take the temperature of ranking members after Biden\u2019s dismal debate performance last month. The call, held before lawmakers return to Washington this week, was filled with deep concern about potential damage to the Democratic ticket and how it imperils the party\u2019s chances to win back the House majority. Jeffries\u00a0did not share with his colleagues where he stands on the question of whether Biden should continue running for reelection, a source who was on the call told CNN. The number of lawmakers who explicitly said Biden should not be the Democratic nominee was greater than the number who spoke up for him to stay, according to one of the sources. Among those who opposed Biden as the nominee were Reps. Mark Takano, Adam Smith, Jim Himes, Joe Morelle, Jerry Nadler and Susan Wild, according to three sources. Five lawmakers have publicly called for Biden to withdraw from the presidential race: Reps. Lloyd Doggett, Seth Moulton, Ra\u00fal Grijalva, Angie Craig and Mike Quigley. Democratic Reps. Maxine Waters and Bobby Scott spoke in support of Biden, according to one of the sources. One of the concerns expressed during the nearly two-hour call was that Democrats will lose their chance at the House majority if Biden is the candidate, one of the sources said, adding that it was generally acknowledged the nominee should be Vice President Kamala Harris. \u201cIt was pretty brutal,\u201d a senior Democratic aide told CNN, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the private conversation among House leaders. Though not present on the call, lawmakers from the Congressional Black Caucus, including Rep. Joyce Beatty of Ohio and Rep. Frederica Wilson of Florida, were quick to defend Biden from their colleagues calling on the president to step aside. Beatty, former chair of the CBC, said that Democrats \u201cshouldn\u2019t be going rogue against our own president\u201d and that Black voters are loyal and will continue to support Biden. \u201cAny \u2018leader\u2019 calling for President Biden to drop out needs to get their priorities straight and stop undermining this incredible actual leader who has delivered real results for our country,\u201d Wilson said in a statement. No decisions about demands for a White House meeting or sending a letter to Biden are expected to be made before the full Democratic caucus meets Tuesday, aides said, but Jeffries has made clear he will allow members to speak their minds and make their own judgments. One senior House Democrat said they have been on calls and group chats with dozens of their colleagues where the consensus is that Biden needs to step aside. The member said the caucus is trying to \u201cfind the best way to move forward\u201d while still giving the president the respect they believe he deserves for his storied career. It is the view of the senior House Democrat and another member that Tuesday \u2014 the day of the planned caucus meeting \u2014 will be the most consequential day for the president this week. One of the members told CNN they anticipate that is the day when the dam will break. Many Democrats concerned about Biden\u2019s viability as a candidate following his poor debate performance are waiting for Jeffries to take a public position. So far, the leader has been in a purposeful listening mode \u2014 as one person told CNN last week, Jeffries has \u201cassiduously\u201d avoided sharing his own judgment on the matter as he continues to survey his own caucus. Biden, meanwhile, was busy on the campaign trail in battleground Pennsylvania, speaking earlier in the day at a predominantly Black church in Philadelphia before making a surprise stop at a local campaign office \u2014 amping up the unscripted and off-the-cuff events his allies have encouraged him to take on. He then made his way to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, where he showed off his support from state Democrats Sen. John\u00a0Fetterman, Rep. Madeleine Dean and Lt. Gov. Austin Davis at a campaign event. It was between those trips on Sunday that Biden answered with a resounding \u201cyes\u201d when press asked whether the Democratic Party was still behind him. This story has been updated with new reporting.

{"id": "2024_07_07_us_hitchhiker-serial-killer-daughter-podcast-cec", "text": "Steve Fishman was still in his teens when he came face-to-face with a serial killer. At 19, he was hitchhiking from a friend\u2019s place in Boston to Norwich, Connecticut, where he was an intern at a newspaper. Fishman was not far from his destination and sticking out his thumb when a man pulled over in a green Buick sedan, said his name was \u201cRed,\u201d and told him to hop in. The man appeared friendly and had a balding head with wispy patches of red hair, likely the reason for his nickname. But as Fishman would learn later, the man harbored a dark secret: His name was Robert Frederick Carr III, and he was a serial killer who preyed on young hitchhikers. Three years earlier, Carr had raped and strangled two 11-year-old boys and a 16-year-old girl who\u2019d hitched a ride with him in the Miami area. When he gave Fishman a ride, he was on parole after serving time for a rape in Connecticut. Fishman\u2019s ride lasted only about 15 minutes \u2014 Carr dropped him off unharmed \u2014 but his memories of that fall 1975 encounter have haunted him for decades. About six months later, Carr was arrested for an attempted rape of a hitchhiker in the Miami area and then startled detectives when he confessed to kidnapping and raping more than a dozen people and killing four of them. Edna Buchanan, the Pulitzer Prize-winning Miami police reporter who wrote a book about Carr, once said: \u201cHe was about the most evil person I ever met.\u201d Fishman was stunned when he saw Carr\u2019s picture on a breaking news alert. He recognized him instantly as the talkative man who\u2019d given him a ride. In retrospect, Fishman said, he missed several major red flags that day. First, the sedan\u2019s door latch on the passenger side was jammed and Fishman had to roll down the window and open it from the outside. And Carr had casually mentioned he had just got out of prison. \u201cI\u2019m an intern at a local newspaper. And I\u2019m thinking, \u2018Wow, that could be a good story about a guy getting out of prison, trying to reintegrate into the community,\u201d Fishman told CNN. \u201cI really didn\u2019t stop to think or ask him what the crime was. I didn\u2019t have any idea.\u201d Nearly five decades later, Fishman and Carr\u2019s daughter, Donna, are unraveling lingering questions about the pedophile and killer in a new season of the \u201cSmoke Screen\u201d podcast titled, \u201cMy Friend, the Serial Killer.\u201d In the podcast, they explore Carr\u2019s brutal crimes and and deceptions by digging through confession tapes, a box of his personal items from prison and hours of interviews with detectives. Although her father died in a Florida prison in 2007, Donna continues to struggle with her family\u2019s dark past. And Fishman still wonders how he made it out of Carr\u2019s sedan alive. A job on the road offers an opportunity to prey on hitchhikers In the 1970s, hitchhiking was considered a safe way to get from point A to B. \u201cIt was a pretty regular mode of transportation back then,\u201d said Fishman, who as an intern constantly relied on random strangers to drive him where he wanted to go. \u201cDepending on where you lived, we hitchhiked a lot. It was so safe, there were moms who picked me up hitchhiking, with their kids in the backseat with groceries,\u201d he said. Carr may have played on this belief to carry out his crimes, which mostly targeted hitchhikers. A TV repairman and car salesman, Carr lived in Norwich with his wife and two kids: Donna and her younger brother. But he traveled nationwide for work and used that opportunity to prey on underage children. Nearly all his crimes, which occurred in the 1970s, involved children under age 18. In 1972, Carr picked up two 11-year-old hitchhiking friends, raped and strangled them, then buried them in Louisiana and Mississippi.\u00a0 He also picked up a 16-year-old girl and drove her from Miami to Mississippi before he strangled her. He strangled his fourth victim, Rhonda Holloway, 21, not long after his encounter with Fishman and buried her in Connecticut. Carr would later take investigators on a cross-country trip to show them where he\u2019d buried his victims. \u201cWhat he did to those children was truly unprintable,\u201d David Simmons, a detective involved in his arrest, said in a 2007 interview. \u201cIn my 33-year career in law enforcement, Carr ranks as the most dangerous child sexual predator-murderer I ever investigated.\u201d A daughter changes her last name to escape her father\u2019s shadow Five decades later, Donna is still living in the shadows of her father\u2019s horrific legacy. She is married, with another last name, and asked CNN to withhold her full name for safety reasons. In an exclusive interview with CNN, Donna tearfully described an adolescence filled with bullying and jokes about having a serial killer dad.\u00a0She barely looked people in the eye as a child, she said.\u00a0Those who knew who she was pointed and talked about her father in hushed tones. Donna said she first learned about her father\u2019s murderous rampage when she was 12. But she didn\u2019t believe he was the monster he was portrayed to be until he led police on a road trip to unearth his buried victims in Louisiana, Mississippi and Connecticut. \u201cWhen he agreed to take the detectives on the search for the bodies, the denial could no longer be. Just every range of emotions you could possibly think of for a 12-year-old girl to go through,\u201d said Donna, 60, who now lives in West Virginia. \u201cAnd that\u2019s when I started to withdraw.\u201d Today Donna has a 27-year-old daughter and worries that a public connection to her father could lead to a new wave of harassment for them. She dropped her father\u2019s last name years ago in favor of her married name, and has told her daughter about his history. \u201cSometimes in life, his name can come up on things like background checks for employment, and so on,\u201d Donna said. \u201cI raised my daughter to be very mature and to understand things. I didn\u2019t want to lie to her.\u201d Donna said she wishes people would show more compassion for relatives of convicted killers. They grieve too, but dare not verbalize their loss, she said. \u201cNo one sees what\u2019s happening in the lives of those people just by hearing about a news story,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re humans and they have feelings and they get hurt, and they suffer trauma. And they are very much victims, too, but in a different sense.\u201d A hitchhiker asks a killer why he spared his life After her father\u2019s crimes became public, Donna spent much of her adolescence holed up inside their Norwich home with her mother. But one day Fishman, still an intern at the newspaper, knocked on their door after her father\u2019s arrest. He pleaded with Donna\u2019s mother to let Carr know that the guy whose life he\u2019d spared months earlier would like to visit him in jail for an interview. Fishman finally got a chance to interview Carr in prison in the mid-1970s after numerous attempts. In hours of recorded jailhouse interviews, Carr never pretended to be a saint, Fishman said. He talked about how he stole cars and offered sex to men for money when he was younger. He confessed to killing his victims and sounded not the least bit remorseful, Fishman said. \u201cOne of the questions that I had for him was, \u2018Why not me?\u2019 And that feels like a really bizarre question to ask. But I did. And he basically shrugged and said, \u2018I thought you were too big,\u2019\u201d Fishman said. Fishman\u2019s paper published his interview with Carr. But as Fishman grew up, got married and became a dad, he started rethinking the tone of his coverage. \u201cAn interview with a serial killer was a big story. It was a big journalism scoop that really kind of sent me on the path to be a journalist. And yet, it was a story that I didn\u2019t really like to think about because I did it when I was 19 and 20, and I was really afraid of what my focus had been,\u201d Fishman said. Fishman said he believes his friendly conversation with Carr during the ride may have clouded his perspective and humanized the killer a little too much. \u201cI was really afraid that I had gotten the story wrong, that I somehow didn\u2019t understand or appreciate the horror of the story,\u201d he said. \u201cBack then, I looked at it as a societal problem of how do we treat criminals? How do we rehabilitate rapists? And the utter depravation of it kind of slipped by me.\u201d That is partly why Fishman is excavating the story in his podcast. He hopes that by understanding Carr better, he can correct the record from a more mature and nuanced viewpoint. \u201cI\u2019m a father now a few times over. I think about crime and victims differently,\u201d Fishman said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s kind of why I went to look for Donna.\u201d An answer to a decades-long question: \u2018He was just born evil\u2019 After deciding to make the podcast, Fishman sent Donna a Facebook message introducing himself. \u201cShe immediately responded with, \u2018I\u2019ve been wondering what happened to you,\u201d Fishman said. Turns out, Donna had spent her lifetime trying to understand her father. She\u2019d wondered: Did he kill people because he was mentally ill and had no access to psychiatric treatment \u2014 as Fishman had once written? Or was he just an inherently evil person? She\u2019d tried reaching out to Fishman over the years and even had called the Norwich paper. But the decision to be a part of the podcast was not easy. \u201cI was hesitant, because I really have not spoken much about it. Very few people know that part of my life,\u201d she said. \u201cIt took me a little while to make that decision, and then I decided if I was going to do it with anyone, it was going to be Steve.\u201d Donna said she believes her father had manipulated Fishman, like he did with everyone in his life. So she and Fishman agreed to meet at her West Virginia farm to understand the complexities of the story from a new point of view. They looked through boxes stuffed with Carr\u2019s items from prison, including letters Donna had sent him at age 15.\u00a0 \u201cDear Dad, I love you. I\u2019m sorry I haven\u2019t written in so long,\u201d one said. Her father responded with letters urging her to find Jesus. He claimed he had found Jesus, too. But he also sent her sexually suggestive letters, leading her to cut off communication with him. Donna told CNN that she knew her dad was a monster, but she was holding on to the childhood dream of having a nuclear family. In between her flashes of terror and anger, there were happy memories of family camping trips and the Christmas when her father unwrapped a large stereo he\u2019d bought for the family. Donna said the inappropriate letters from her father finally gave her the strength to severe ties with him. But they were so unnerving that she said she constantly called the prison to make sure he had not been released on parole. One day in the summer of 2007 she found out he was no longer listed as being in prison and had a brief moment of panic, thinking he\u2019d been set free. But a call to the prison confirmed that her father had died of prostate cancer. He was 63. Only after his death did her sense of peace slowly start creeping back. Donna said that despite her initial reluctance, working on the podcast has been a therapeutic experience that has given her a better sense of who her father was. \u201cAs many diagnoses as my father had as far as his mental state \u2014 and there were a lot \u2014 I believe he was just born evil,\u201d she said. She\u2019s in counseling and hopes to keep making steps toward healing. \u201cI kept everything boxed in for so many years. I would just push everything down,\u201d she said. \u00a0\u201cIt was nice to finally talk about it freely.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/07/us/hitchhiker-serial-killer-daughter-podcast-cec/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/08/2024", "section": "us"}}

Keshawn Dixon, 18, was arrested on Saturday in Killeen, Texas, and taken to the Bell County Jail, according to a\u00a0statement from the Round Rock Police Department. Dixon faces a charge of deadly conduct, a third-degree felony, according to the police department. Additional charges are possible, police said. \u201cThe investigation is ongoing, and the Round Rock Police Department continues to pursue leads involving additional suspects,\u201d the police department said. The deadly shooting took place on June 15 at Old Settlers Park during Round Rock\u2019s Juneteenth Festival. On the celebratory night that featured musical performances, an altercation broke out between two groups, and \u201cseveral subjects\u201d pulled out guns and shot at each other, Round Rock Police Chief Allen Banks said at the time. A large crowd was at the event at the time and \u201cmultiple victims were hit,\u201d the chief said at an earlier news conference. Lyndsey Vicknair, a 33-year-old from Manor, and Ara Duke, a 54-year-old from Pflugerville, were killed, police said. Neither was involved in the altercation. \u201cOur hearts are heavy as we mourn the tragic loss of innocent lives and the injuries sustained by several others in Saturday\u2019s senseless act of violence. Our deepest condolences go out to the families affected by this tragedy,\u201d Banks said following the shooting. Days after the shooting, Ricky Thompson III,\u00a017, became the first suspect to be arrested in connection to the incident. He was taken into custody on suspicion of\u00a0aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, according to police. A juvenile suspect, who has not been identified, was later also taken into custody and taken to the Williamson County Juvenile Justice Center. \u201cWe are committed to ensuring the safety and well-being of our community and will work tirelessly to bring those responsible to justice. Together, we will stand strong and support one another during this difficult time for our community,\u201d Banks said. The holiday shooting is one of 277 mass shootings in the US so far this year, according to the\u00a0Gun Violence Archive. Like CNN, the Gun Violence Archive defines a mass shooting as where four or more people are shot, excluding the shooter. \u201cIt breaks your heart for a family that was coming out to enjoy their evening and now their life is forever changed as a result of somebody who could care less about somebody else\u2019s life and that\u2019s so disappointing,\u201d Banks said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/07/us/suspect-arrested-shooting-round-rock-texas-juneteenth/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/08/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_07_04_us_blaze-bernstein-killing-conviction", "text": "A California man was convicted of murder with a hate crime enhancement Wednesday for the 2018 stabbing death of a gay University of Pennsylvania student. Samuel Woodward, 26, was found guilty of first-degree murder plus the enhancement in the killing of Blaze Bernstein, a gay, Jewish college sophomore who was home visiting his family in Southern California on winter break when he went missing. Authorities scoured the area for him and found his body a week later in a shallow grave at a nearby park. The question during the monthslong trial was not whether Woodward killed Bernstein but why, and the circumstances under which it happened. During closing arguments, prosecutor Jennifer Walker emphasized Woodward\u2019s affiliation with a violent, anti-gay, neo-Nazi extremist group known as Atomwaffen Division. \u201cThis is a person focused on hate,\u201d Walker said. \u201cNot following, not being led by, influenced by, victimized by Atomwaffen \u2014 seeking it out.\u201d With the hate crime enhancement, Woodward could face a sentence of life without parole. Ken Morrison, Woodward\u2019s attorney, sought at trial to show his client did not plan to kill Bernstein and did not hate anyone, in an effort for a conviction to be on a lesser charge such as second-degree murder or manslaughter. Morrison, who plans to appeal after sentencing, said the judge made some key rulings that denied \u201cjurors the ability to consider evidence critical to a fair trial.\u201d Bernstein\u2019s family said in a statement no verdict could \u201cerase the pain of losing our son and the agony of waiting all of these years without resolution,\u201d ABC News reported. \u201cHe was an amazing human and humanitarian and a person we were greatly looking forward to having in our lives, seeing wondrous things from him as his young life unfolded,\u201d the family said. \u201cFrom this funny, articulate, kind, intelligent, caring and brilliant scientist, artist, writer, chef and son, there will never be anyone quite like him.\u201d Woodward and Bernstein previously attended the same high school in Orange County and connected via a dating app in the months before the attack, according to testimony at trial. Woodward said he picked up Bernstein and went to a nearby park, and he repeatedly stabbed Bernstein after trying to grab a cellphone he feared had been used to photograph him. Prosecutors said Woodward joined Atomwaffen Division and repeatedly targeted gay men online by reaching out to them and then abruptly breaking off contact while keeping a hateful, profanity-laced journal of his actions. They said Woodward showed an interest in carrying out violent acts in the weeks before the killing and reached out to Bernstein online. \u201cHate will never be tolerated here in Orange County \u2014 and instead of a symbol to be revered by other haters, he is a symbol of how society will never tolerate those who terrorize the most vulnerable members of our society,\u201d county District Attorney Todd Spitzer said Wednesday in a statement. Morrison, the defense lawyer, told jurors Woodward faced challenges in his personal relationships due to a long-undiagnosed autism spectrum disorder and was confused about his sexuality after growing up in a politically conservative and devout Catholic family where his father openly criticized homosexuality. The case took years to go to trial after questions arose about Woodward\u2019s mental state and following multiple changes in defense attorneys. Woodward was deemed competent to stand trial in late 2022. Bernstein, who was 19 at the time, disappeared in January 2018 after he went out at night with Woodward to a park in Lake Forest, about 45 miles southeast of Los Angeles. After Bernstein missed a dentist appointment the next day, his parents found his glasses, wallet and credit cards in his bedroom and tried to contact him, but he did not respond to texts or calls. Authorities launched an exhaustive search and said Bernstein\u2019s family scoured his social media and saw he had communicated with Woodward on Snapchat. Authorities said Woodward told the family Bernstein had gone off to meet a friend in the park that night and did not return. Days later, Bernstein\u2019s body was found\u00a0in the shallow grave. He had been repeatedly stabbed in the face and neck. Authorities said they searched Woodward\u2019s family home in Newport Beach and found a folding knife with a bloodied blade in his room. They also found a black Atomwaffen mask with traces of blood and a host of anti-gay, antisemitic and hate group materials, prosecutors said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/04/us/blaze-bernstein-killing-conviction/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/08/2024", "section": "us"}}

{"id": "2024_07_06_business_electric-nascar-race-car-unveiled", "text": "NASCAR racing is all about loud, fast cars burning gas and rubber around a track. But on Saturday, NASCAR unveiled something different: an all-electric SUV that has twice as much horsepower as any of their current gas guzzlers. It\u2019s a sign of just how far electric vehicles have come that even a sport better known for its adherence to tradition is entertaining embracing the technology \u2013 even if, for now, the new car is just a prototype. In some ways, it looks like what you\u2019d expect from NASCAR. It\u2019s colorful with big wheels and a wing on the back to help the vehicle hold the road at high speeds. But, if NASCAR is known for anything, it\u2019s the loud V8 internal combustion engines that power the race car. NASCAR executives insist they have no plans to turn away from fuel-burning power any time soon. \u201cThe combustion engine is our core product, and that will remain so for the coming future,\u201d said Riley Nelson, NASCAR\u2019s head of sustainability. But this vehicle, a fully drivable prototype, provides a way for NASCAR to gauge fan interest in electric cars. The racing crossover has three electric motors \u2014 one driving the front wheels and two the back \u2014 capable of producing a maximum of 1,300 horsepower, almost double the horsepower of NASCAR\u2019s current gasoline-powered race cars. Some passionate NASCAR fans will, no doubt, reject the very idea of electric racing, said John Probst, NASCAR\u2019s senior vice president of racing development. That\u2019s why NASCAR wants to make it very clear that gasoline-burning race cars are in no immediate danger of extinction. This is also an opportunity to open minds to what could be something exciting in the future. NASCAR\u2019s own research with fans indicated that many are curious to know more about electric vehicles and could see EV racing as a way to learn about them, he said. Once fans see the speed and excitement of an electric cars, which can be more powerful and faster than gas cars, he thinks even the most anti-EV fans will drop some of their objections. The NASCAR EV prototype was built in cooperation with ABB, a company that\u2019s involved in building electric vehicle infrastructure, such as power equipment for chargers. ABB is also heavily involved in Formula E, the electric racing series affiliated with Formula 1. Involvement in racing like this hopefully generates interest in EVs and shows what they\u2019re capable of, said Michael Plaster, ABB\u2019s executive vice president for electrification in the US. The hope is that exciting track performance can sell electric cars. NASCAR introduced a broader initiative last year to reduce its overall net carbon emissions to zero by 2035. Racing itself represents only a small part of the organization\u2019s overall carbon emissions, said Nelson. For now, most of that initiative has to do with reducing emissions from office space, transportation and operations at the 15 NASCAR-owned tracks. \u201cThe pilot programs that we\u2019ve implemented within operations of our core business, and then also the events, has been going really well,\u201d she said, \u201cand we know where we need to go but we\u2019re still in the early stages of this journey.\u201d Currently, NASCAR cars run on fuel that is 85% gasoline and 15% ethanol but, in the next few years, NASCAR plans to announce a more sustainable racing fuel that can still be burned in loud V8 engines. The original idea behind NASCAR, the National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing, was that it was supposed to involve cars similar to what Americans drive on the road. With many changes over the years, modern NASCAR race cars bear little resemblance to the Toyotas and Chevrolets that typical Americans own. This time, designers wanted to maintain that resemblance between the race car and the vehicles fans drive, which are, increasingly, SUVs. Today, traditional cars \u2014 as opposed to SUVs, trucks or vans \u2014 make up less than 20% of US auto sales, according to Cox Automotive. \u201cWe actually have the opportunity to evaluate not just the battery electric part, but then also the crossover vehicle part,\u201d said Probst. \u201cSo, it may be that one or both of these will become something in the future for us.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/06/business/electric-nascar-race-car-unveiled/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/08/2024", "section": "us"}}

Officers found seven victims suffering from gunshot wounds shortly before 3 a.m. after receiving calls of an active shooter at a home on Ridgecrest Drive in Florence, southwest of Cincinnati, Ohio, Florence Police Department Chief Jeff Mallery said during a Saturday afternoon news conference. Mallery identified the four gunshot victims as Shane Miller, 20; Hayden Rybicki, 20; Delaney Eary, 19; and Melissa Parrett, 44.

Three of the victims were transported to a hospital in Cincinnati and are listed in critical but stable condition, according to a statement by police. Garvey initially fled the scene and police say he was discovered a short time later in a crashed vehicle with an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound. Police said Garvey was transported to a hospital, where he was later pronounced dead.

The advisory was issued Wednesday by the District of Columbia Water and Sewer Authority\u00a0and Arlington County due to an increase in algae blooms in the Potomac River, as the nation\u2019s capital prepared for its annual Fourth of July celebrations.

The warnings were lifted as the area readied for an influx of visitors for the Fourth of July, including the annual fireworks display on the National Mall. The Army Corps of Engineers said the advisory was prompted by elevated cloudiness in the water supply caused by increases in algae blooms in the Potomac River. \u201cUpon observing the increase in algae and resulting turbidity today, Washington Aqueduct staff implemented additional mechanical and chemical treatment solutions to help meet system water supply demands and (Environmental Protection Agency) standards,\u201d the Army Corps said in a statement.

{"id": "2024_07_03_us_replica-handgun-utica-police-shooting", "text": "Before an officer fatally shot Nyah Mway last week as he ran from law enforcement in upstate New York, the 13-year-old had pulled out what police said appeared to be a handgun. But it wasn\u2019t a real gun, authorities later discovered, they\u2019ve said \u2013 only one capable of firing pellets. Still, the firearm \u2013 which is entirely black, photos released by the Utica Police Department show \u2013 carried the same \u201cGlock markings, signatures, detachable magazine and serial numbers\u201d as a Glock 17 Gen 5 handgun, Utica Police spokesperson Lt. Michael Curley told The Associated Press. \u201cThis weapon in every facet resembles a real GLOCK handgun, in functionality, appearance, and design,\u201d he told CNN, adding it\u00a0\u201cfires .177 pellets.\u201d Nyah Mway apparently pointed the handgun at three officers while he ran away from them after dark, body camera footage released by Utica Police shows. The officers yelled \u201cgun,\u201d and one officer tackled and punched the teenager. As they wrestled on the ground, another officer fired a single shot, the video shows. The teen was taken to a local hospital where he died, police said. Imitation guns have led to unintended fatal consequences over the years, posing challenges for law enforcement who interpret them as real in a nation with more guns than people. Here\u2019s what we know about such items and some other cases: What imitation firearms are \u2013 and aren\u2019t Toy, look-alike and imitation firearms are devices that \u201chave the appearance, shape, and/or configuration of a firearm,\u201d according to the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the agency that enforces federal rules governing them. The term \u201clook-alike firearm\u201d includes:\u2022 Toy guns\u2022 Water guns\u2022 Replica nonguns\u2022 Airsoft guns firing nonmetallic projectiles Some other guns that don\u2019t fire live bullets, however, are not considered \u201clook-alike firearms.\u201d The term does not include:\u2022 Non-firing collector replica antique firearms\u2022 Traditional BB, paintball or pellet-firing air guns\u2022 Decorative, ornamental and miniature objects that have the appearance of a firearm and measure no more than 38 mm by 70 mm (excluding any gun stock length) In Utica,\u00a0police initially said Nyah Mway was holding\u00a0\u201ca replica GLOCK pellet gun.\u201d It appears a firearm with that description would not be considered a look-alike under the federal rule \u2013\u00a0although at night, it may have been virtually impossible for a police officer to know that. What regulations require of look-alikes While federal law does not govern the transfer, use or possession of imitation guns, according to the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, the way such items look when they\u2019re \u201cmanufactured and entered into commerce\u201d is regulated \u2013 to a degree \u2013 by the Consumer Product Safety Commission. Every look-alike firearm \u2013 that is: toy guns, water guns, replica nonguns and airsoft guns that fire nonmetallic projectiles \u2013 must either:\u2022 have a permanently affixed blaze orange plug inserted in the firearm\u2019s barrel\u2022 have a similar marking on the exterior of the barrel\u2022 be constructed entirely of transparent or translucent materials\u2022 or be covered in certain bright colors The rules \u2013 in place since 1989 \u2013 don\u2019t apply to non-firing replicas; BB, paintball or pellet guns; or decorative or mini firearms. They also do not cover \u201chow consumers use or enjoy their products,\u201d according to the commission. Under those rules, it appears the Consumer Product Safety Commission would not require the gun Nyah Mway was carrying to bear \u201clook-alike firearm\u201d markings, such as an orange plug or transparent or bright coverings, either because of its pellet projectiles or as a replica. Being able to buy a look-alike or imitation gun also can depend on the law. For example, while Amazon sells a variety of imitation firearms, the online marketplace won\u2019t ship airsoft guns, non-powdered weapons like BB guns, pellet guns, paintball guns and air rifles or toy guns to places with sales restrictions, its policy states. Amazon, Walmart and three other retailers announced a deal in 2015 with the then-attorney general of New York \u2013 where Nyah Mway was fatally shot \u2013 to stop selling realistic toy guns there. And Pennsylvania, Florida, Delaware and other states impose age restrictions on the possession, use or transfer of some non-powder guns, according to the Giffords Law Center. \u2018No one could reasonably tell the difference\u2019 Police across the United States shot 305 people brandishing non-powder and toy firearms between 2015 and 2023, according to a Giffords Law Center analysis of the Washington Post\u2019s Fatal Force database, which tracks fatal shootings of civilians by police. While police in Utica initially said Nyah Mway was holding\u00a0\u201ca replica GLOCK pellet gun,\u201d they later clarified the term \u201creplica\u201d was used to describe its physical condition because of its resemblance to a Glock handgun, the department told CNN on Tuesday. \u201cIn the future we will ensure that we utilize proper terminology so that there is no mistake in what we are trying to portray,\u201d Curley said. Imitation handguns in the hands of anyone \u2013 especially juveniles \u2013 pose many challenges for police departments across the country, Curley added. \u201cAs we see in this tragic incident, split second decisions have to be made when individuals are in possession of realistic looking weapons that are indistinguishable\u00a0from their real counterparts,\u201d he said. \u201cNo one could reasonably tell the difference between the two, much less in high stress situations where the item is being displayed.\u201d Imitation guns have led to other fatalities In New York \u2013 where Nyah Mway was shot and killed \u2013 at least 63 shootings, eight of them fatal, unfolded as a result of people mistaking imitation weapons for real ones, according to 2015 data from the state Office of the Attorney General. Beyond that, hundreds of crimes have been committed in New York City with imitation weapons, the office said. No new data was available on the issue, it told CNN this week. Just last month, a teenager with an airsoft gun was fatally shot by an armed man who \u201ctook it upon himself\u201d to conduct surveillance outside a sporting goods store in Washington state, according to court documents. The armed man \u201cassumed\u201d the teen and two others were about to commit a violent robbery, the prosecutor wrote. The man has been charged with murder. His attorneys say he was acting in self-defense, protecting himself and others. Several years before that, Antonio Arce, 14, was fatally shot by police in Tempe, Arizona, while holding what later was determined to be a replica 1911 airsoft gun he\u2019d just stolen from a truck reported to police as suspicious. The officer who fired was not criminally charged in Arce\u2019s death. And in 2014, Tamir Rice, 12, was shot and killed outside an Ohio recreation center when an officer opened fire after authorities mistook a black, toy airsoft pistol Tamir had for a real firearm. The US Justice Department in 2020 found insufficient evidence to support federal criminal charges against the former officer who fired his weapon at Rice.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/03/us/replica-handgun-utica-police-shooting/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/08/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_07_07_politics_republican-convention-target-extremists", "text": "The Republican National Convention in Milwaukee next week could be an \u201cattractive\u201d target for violent extremists or other people looking to sow chaos by disrupting a high-profile political event, according to a threat assessment from federal agencies and the Milwaukee Police Department obtained by CNN. This election season has seen a \u201cresurgence in disruptive tactics targeting election symbols\u201d that are very likely meant to \u201cinstill fear and disrupt operations at election-related critical infrastructure facilities,\u201d according to the assessment.\u00a0The report was\u00a0prepared by the\u00a0FBI, US Secret Service, Department of Homeland Security, and Wisconsin state and city law enforcement officials. Homeland Security\u2019s Office of Intelligence and Analysis distributed the assessment to federal, state and local officials in recent days. There is \u201cno credible reporting to indicate a threat\u201d to the Republican National Convention, but \u201cviolent threat actors\u201d may view the convention \u201cas an attractive target due to its symbolic nature and link to the 2024 general election,\u201d says the threat assessment, which was dated July 2. One of the \u201cdisruptive tactics\u201d that law enforcement officials are worried about is \u201cswatting,\u201d in which a caller makes a bogus crime report intended to trigger a massive law enforcement response to a target\u2019s residence. Since December, at least four swatting incidents have been aimed at the homes of elections officials, CNN previously\u00a0reported. The Republican National Convention, taking place July 15-18, is expected to draw some 50,000 people as Republicans nominate Donald Trump as their presidential candidate. It comes at a time of bitter partisan divide and simmering tensions among Americans over policies such as President Joe Biden\u2019s handling of the Israel-Hamas war. \u201cDHS and FBI remain concerned about the possibility of violent conflict occurring at otherwise lawful protest events or gatherings linked to the 2024 RNC,\u201d the threat assessment says. There are also expected to be security concerns and a large law enforcement presence around the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in August. The Republican convention, like other major political events, is an opportunity for foreign intelligence services to collect information on policy positions or people with \u201cperceived access\u201d to political campaigns, the threat assessment says. Blockbuster political events like the convention also \u201cremain attractive targets\u201d for foreign terrorists or domestic violent extremists looking to draw attention to their ideological causes, according to the assessment. There are\u00a0heightened concerns\u00a0from US officials that an ISIS affiliate could carry out an attack on US soil, CNN reported last month. \u201cWhile our standard practice is to not comment on specific intelligence products, the FBI regularly shares information with our law enforcement partners to assist in protecting the communities they serve,\u201d the FBI said in a statement to CNN. \u201cThe FBI encourages members of the public to be vigilant and report anything they consider suspicious to law enforcement.\u201d The Secret Service referred questions about the threat assessment to DHS. CNN has also requested comment from the Milwaukee Police Department. Federal, state and local law enforcement officials have spent months preparing for the Republican convention, mapping out potential threats and chasing down investigative leads. In February, according to the threat assessment, \u201can unidentified individual\u201d was seen \u201crecording/photographing\u201d during a delivery to a loading dock at the exterior of Fiserv Forum \u2014\u00a0the arena that is the main venue for the convention. The Milwaukee Police Department is investigating the incident, the assessment says. The Secret Service last month laid out the security measures for the convention, including a perimeter that will prevent protesters from gathering at a large park near the venue. The announcement\u00a0came\u00a0after a\u00a0monthslong dispute between the Secret Service and the Republican Party over security measures around the convention. The party had accused the agency of ignoring its concerns, while the Secret Service said Republicans were undermining efforts to keep the event safe. Around the convention, law enforcement officials are also on alert for the mailing of suspicious packages, arson, property destruction and the exposure of public officials\u2019 private information online, according to the threat assessment. Election offices in multiple states reported receiving suspicious packages around the November 2023 gubernatorial and state legislative elections. \u201cWe also remain concerned about the potential for hoax threats to disrupt the 2024 RNC, leading to evacuations and closures of political events, as well as straining law enforcement resources,\u201d the document says. The large influx of out-of-state visitors could also be a boon for sex traffickers, officials warned. \u201cThe FBI anticipates victims will arrive in Wisconsin and advertise online or in locations known to offer sexual services in the weeks prior to the events,\u201d according to the assessment.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/07/politics/republican-convention-target-extremists/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/08/2024", "section": "us"}}

{"id": "2024_07_07_business_john-deere-mass-layoffs-2024", "text": "John Deere announced it will lay off about 600 employees across three US factories as the Illinois-based company shifts production to a newly planned facility in Ramos, Mexico. Effective August 30, about 310 employees will be laid off at two Iowa-based plants in Dubuque and Davenport, as well as 280 from a factory in East Moline, Illinois. In total, the three factories have roughly 4,175 production and maintenance employees. The Illinois factory primarily produces harvesting equipment such as combines, while the two Iowa factories manufacture construction and forestry equipment. The decision is the latest in a string of production layoffs by the farm-equipment manufacturer over the past year. Deere has sought to reposition itself as a technology company amid falling agricultural revenue in the United States. \u201cThese changes are being made due to reduced demand for the products produced at these facilities,\u201d the company told CNN in a statement Friday. \u201cTo better position Deere to meet future demand, we continue to take proactive steps to reduce production and inventory.\u201d The company has reported slumping year-over-year revenue after announcing a net income of more than $10.16 billion in 2023. In a May earnings call, executives forecast Deere\u2019s 2024 income will be about $7 billion, citing higher production costs, lower shipment volumes and volatile weather that has made customers more cautious in their purchasing decisions. \u201cWe do expect incremental demand decline in the back half of 2024,\u201d Josh Beal, the company\u2019s director of investor relations, said in the May earnings call. \u201cNotably, our production volumes will decline more than demand in the back half as we\u2019re taking proactive steps to drive down field inventories. This is true for all of our major markets, South America, Europe, and also now for North America large tractors. We believe this approach best positions us to build the retail demand in 2025.\u201d Diminishing demand comes as US farming has faced significant headwinds over the past several years. According to the Department of Agriculture, in 2023 there were 1.89 million farms in the United States, a decline of 7% from the 2.04 million in 2017. In February, the USDA forecast net farm income in 2024 will fall by $43 billion, about 27%, after reaching a record high in 2022. Crop and animal product sales are also expected to generate $21 billion less in revenue this year, according to the USDA. At the same time, manufacturing jobs across the country have plateaued at 13 million employees after recovering from a sharp pandemic-related downswing in 2020, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Specifically, machinery manufacturing, which include jobs that produce agriculture and construction equipment, has seen a decline of about 9,000 employees since the beginning of the year.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/07/business/john-deere-mass-layoffs-2024/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/08/2024", "section": "us"}}

The children included endangered runaways and those abducted by parents who didn\u2019t have custody, a news release from the Justice Department said. They were rescued from May 20 to June 24 during a nationwide effort called Operation We Will Find You 2. A critically missing child is one who is at an increased risk of danger if they are not found as soon as possible.

{"id": "2024_07_03_us_unite-the-right-victims-damages-reaj", "text": "A federal appeals court ruled on Monday that white supremacist and nationalist groups will have to pay a more than $2 million in punitive damages to people who suffered physical or emotional injuries from the 2017\u00a0\u201cUnite the Right\u201d rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. In 2021,\u00a0a jury ruled\u00a0white nationalist leaders and organizations had to pay more than $26 million in damages to those who suffered injuries from the rally. The \u201cUnite the Right\u201d rally was a two-day event to protest the city\u2019s plan to remove a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee. Approximately $24 million of the $26 million were for punitive damages, but a judge\u00a0later cut\u00a0that\u00a0amount to $350,000, meaning the eight plaintiffs were going to receive only $43,750 each. However, according to court documents, restoring more than $2 million of the slashed amount means each plaintiff will receive approximately $350,000. A three-judge panel of the Richmond-based 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals\u00a0found a state law which caps the total dollar amount\u00a0of punitive damages each person can receive to $350,000, court documents show. In Monday\u2019s opinion, Chief Judge Albert Diaz wrote, \u201c\u2026 we vacate the district court\u2019s order to the extent that it reduces the jury\u2019s punitive damages to $350,000 for all plaintiffs under the Virginia punitive damages cap. And we remand with instructions that the district court apply the cap instead on a per-plaintiff basis.\u201d Before the \u201cUnite the Right\u201d rally began, counter-protestors clashed with white nationalists and other right-wing groups which prompted local officials to declare the rally an \u201cunlawful assembly\u201d and the governor declared a state of emergency,\u00a0CNN previously reported. About two hours later, James Alex Fields Jr., a white supremacist from Maumee, Ohio, intentionally drove his car into a crowd of counter-protesters, killing one woman and injuring dozens more. Fields is serving a life sentence for murder and hate crimes. Fields\u2019 lawyer was not immediately\u202favailable for comment. When the defendants requested the court ask the Supreme Court to question the $350,000 rule, the 4th Circuit panel rejected it and said the law was \u201cclear enough to predict how Virginia\u2019s high court would rule.\u201d \u201cOver two years ago, the jury used its $24 million punitive damages award to send an unmistakable message to the defendants and to the public about the outrageous misconduct that took place in Charlottesville, Virginia,\u201d Diaz wrote in the 3-0 ruling. \u201cWhile the law compels us to reduce the award, it\u2019s long past time for that message to be delivered.\u201d CNN reached out to the defendants\u2019\u00a0lawyers who were not immediately available for comment.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/03/us/unite-the-right-victims-damages-reaj/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/08/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_07_04_us_fireworks-july-4-essay-cec", "text": "My pregnant mom was certain she knew how things would go that night. It was late afternoon, but she already had movie tickets in her pocket. I wasn\u2019t due for another month. And my parents were excited to see \u201cStar Trek II: The Wrath of Khan\u201d in a few hours. But I surprised my family with a different sort of spectacle. My mom\u2019s water broke while she was washing the dishes that day. And I made my entrance on July 4, just after 10 p.m., when surely a few fireworks were still lighting up the Chicago sky. The idea that I burst into the world during the event\u2019s finale is a bit of family lore I\u2019ve always loved retelling. For decades, the beauty and fun of fireworks were deeply intertwined with the way I saw my country and myself. To me, these were facts as indisputable as the wetness of water or the blueness of the sky. But I see things differently now. And that\u2019s something I never expected. Fireworks were a huge part of my \u20184th of July Baby\u2019 identity Growing up, it\u2019s not an overstatement to say no one loved going to see July 4 fireworks more than I did. Yes, it was a bit of a blow to my only-child, millennial mentality to learn at a young age that all the festivities that day weren\u2019t just for me. But I quickly learned to love sharing my 4th of July birthday with America. It\u2019s amazing for most of your loved ones to have the day off on your birthday, and for everyone around you to be celebrating. Gifts emblazoned with American flags became a beloved part of my birthday repertoire, from earrings to T-shirts to teddy bears. I loved flaunting my patriotism. As a toddler, I learned to belt out \u201cGod Bless America,\u201d \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner\u201d and, of course, \u201cI\u2019m a Yankee Doodle Dandy.\u201d More than anything, I loved going with my family to watch the fireworks. There was nothing like the feeling of seeing colors burst into the sky as the symphony played the triumphant finale of the 1812 Overture. The boom of the cannons was thrilling. And the way those extra sparkly golden fireworks crackled gave me the good kind of goosebumps. Even when it was clear the show had ended, I\u2019d look upward toward the wisps of smoke in the atmosphere and hope there might still be more. As I grew older and life got busier, my birthday celebrations became more muted. Sometimes I\u2019d have to work. Sometimes there wasn\u2019t time to plan a party. But no matter, what, I\u2019d have one requirement. \u201cAll I want is to see at least one firework in the sky,\u201d was a refrain I repeated many times when asked how I planned to celebrate. On my 35th birthday, that\u2019s just what I said. And my boyfriend granted that wish, taking me to see a lovely firework display in a town square outside Atlanta. We watched children playing with sparklers and listened to a concert band play as dusk fell. It was as idyllic an American night as anyone could have imagined. But the next day I\u2019d learn that a family I knew had a very different experience that night, only a few miles away. It was their first July 4 in America I first met Abdalla Munye and his family in January 2017, days after the Trump administration\u2019s travel ban went into effect. Abdalla, his wife Habibo and seven children who made the journey with them had only been living in the US for a few days. These Somali refugees were supposed to be starting their new lives, but instead found themselves at a press conference, sobbing in front of strangers. Because of the travel ban, they feared they might never see their daughter, Batulo, again. Officials had booked her on a separate flight a few days after theirs, and the surprise travel ban left her stranded in a refugee camp in Kenya. I spent weeks alongside the family, chronicling how the travel ban affected them. When courts blocked the policy and Batulo finally made it to the US nearly a month later, I was with them at the Atlanta airport and was able to share the story of their reunion with millions of people. Knowing that moment would mark the end of one journey and the beginning of another, we stayed in touch, and I kept visiting them for months so I could tell the story of their first year in America. That\u2019s when an unexpected conversation we had opened my eyes to a reality I\u2019d never considered. I visited Abdalla and his family the day after my birthday, on July 5, 2017, and I still remember how struck I was by what he said. I\u2019d expected him to tell me his family had spent their first Independence Day in America having a cookout, or maybe watching a parade, or gazing in wonder as beautiful fireworks illuminated the sky. But when I asked how their July 4 had been, Abdalla said they\u2019d spent the night hiding in the dark in their apartment, afraid to go outside. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d I asked, naively. Abdalla told me the sounds they\u2019d heard outside made them think of the night when their oldest daughter had been raped and murdered. Memories of war and bloodshed and tragedy raced through his mind. He\u2019d been taught in his refugee orientation that July 4 was a time for celebration in the United States, but he couldn\u2019t believe that\u2019s what was unfolding around them. For Abdalla, there was only one possibility. The dangers they\u2019d fled had found them here, too. In my steno pad, I jotted down Abdalla\u2019s description of the experience. \u201cIt sounded,\u201d he said, \u201clike Somalia.\u201d What a series of panicked text messages reminded me Six months later, on New Year\u2019s Eve, I got a series of frantic WhatsApp message from Abdalla that I\u2019ll never forget. Hello! This is Abdalla how are you doing I hope u doing good, how is the weather today does it change like Somalia we had some booms in our area what is going on we almost to run, don\u2019t forget when u are running tell us too to run on our side. At first, I was puzzled by what he\u2019d written. Then I thought back to our conversation in July. New Year\u2019s revelry was frightening his family the same way Independence Day festivities had. He was asking me what I was hearing on the other side of town. And he wanted me to alert him if I was fleeing, so his family would be able to escape in time, too. I tried writing a brief explanation to reassure him. And I sent a photo of fireworks, too. Abdalla\u2019s English had improved so much since his arrival, but he was still learning. I hoped the image would calm his fears and clarify any confusion in case something had gotten lost in translation. \u201cHere people sometimes celebrate the New Year with fireworks\u2026you don\u2019t need to run! How are you doing?\u201d His response made it clear he was unconvinced. Am fine but u say that it sounds like booms it\u2019s not the way u think. And it is night and why are they booming night time. \u201cIt is just a tradition for some people. \u2026 I know it is scary to hear,\u201d I wrote. \u201cHopefully it will stop soon and you can get some rest.\u201d Ok let us pray to God in the morning to wake up peacefully with kids. The idea that fireworks had inspired this exchange was a sobering reminder that\u2019s stuck with me ever since. By the time my next birthday rolled around, so much had changed in my life. I\u2019d moved to the Washington, DC area, and it had been months since I\u2019d spoken with Abdalla and his family. I watched fireworks with my fianc\u00e9 from an apartment rooftop, and I laughed as I heard my friend\u2019s son gleefully shouting, \u201cHi, fireworks!\u201d as they lit up the horizon. But in my mind, I heard Abdalla\u2019s voice, too, even though he was hundreds of miles away. The way I celebrate July 4 has changed I have thought about my conversations with Abdalla and his family many times over the years. The visual beauty of fireworks still wows me. But every July 4, I now find myself closing my eyes for a few moments, and hearing how those same sounds could so easily be a very different kind of explosion. I think about how lucky I have been to live my whole life without a shred of doubt that the boom of a firework was a sound of celebration. And I think about how so many others have stories like Abdalla\u2019s. The UN refugee agency estimates there are now more 117 million forcibly displaced people in the world \u2014 roughly equal to a third of the entire US population. I think back on my mom, washing the dishes 42 years ago, with movie tickets in her pocket and no doubt in her mind about what that July 4 had in store. Until everything changed in an instant. So many times, we are so certain about our futures, only to find out something unexpected awaits us. That\u2019s the beauty and the terror of living. Abdalla never expected people in his own family to be killed as armed groups ravaged the Somali countryside. He never expected to be forced by war to flee his home. He never expected a US president\u2019s decision would throw his life into chaos. He never expected to end up on the other side of the world, hiding in his apartment with the lights off in the place where he thought he\u2019d be safe. I don\u2019t speak with Abdalla as regularly as I once did when writing about his family. But I try to stay in touch with people who\u2019ve trusted me to help share their stories. It\u2019s been more than seven years since we first met, and Abdalla and I still exchange text messages every so often. He sent me photos of Batulo\u2019s wedding. After my own daughter was born a few years ago, I sent him pictures of our family, too. He wrote to me recently to ask how my daughter was doing. And I asked him about his family and their plans for July 4 this year. They now live in Kentucky, where Abdalla works for Amazon sorting clothing returns. These days, Abdalla says his family is more prepared for July 4. \u201cWe are used to it,\u201d he says. \u201cIn America we see people celebrating it.

{"id": "2024_07_02_us_cincinnati-jewish-cemeteries-vandalism", "text": "(CNN) \u2014\u00a0Nearly 180 gravestones at two Jewish cemeteries in Cincinnati have been vandalized, according to the Jewish Cemeteries of Greater Cincinnati and the Jewish Federation of Cincinnati. Many of the gravestones \u2013 some dating back to the late 1800s \u2013 have been knocked face-down, with some cracked in half, at the Tifereth Israel and the Beth Hamedrash Hagadol cemeteries in the Covedale Cemetery complex, a news release on behalf of the Jewish Cemeteries of Greater Cincinnati, the Jewish Federation of Cincinnati and the Jewish Community Relations Council said. The vandalism is believed to have occurred between June 25 and July 1, the statement said, and was discovered Monday morning. The FBI, Cincinnati Police and Green Township of Hamilton County are investigating the incident but there are no known suspects, the release added. \u201cThe FBI Cincinnati Field Office, the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of Ohio, and the Justice Department\u2019s Civil Rights Division are working with local law enforcement partners to investigate the damage to gravestones at Tifereth Israel Cemetery and the Beth Hamedrash Hagadol Cemetery,\u201d The FBI said Thursday. \u201cWe encourage anyone with information about this vandalism to contact the FBI.\u201d Capt. Mitch Hill of the Green Township Police Department told CNN Wednesday the investigation is ongoing and no new information is available. \u201cThe vandalism of nearly 200 graves at two Jewish cemeteries near Cincinnati is despicable. This is Antisemitism and it is vile,\u201d President Joe Biden stated in a post on X Wednesday, \u201cI condemn these acts and commit my Administration to support investigators in holding those responsible accountable to the full extent of the law.\u201d The vandalism comes amid a rise in antisemitic incidents across the nation. The\u00a0most recent data\u00a0from the Anti-Defamation League, which has tracked antisemitic incidents in the US since 1979, found a 140% increase from 2022 to 2023, with a \u201cdramatic\u201d increase taking place after the October 7 Hamas\u00a0attacks\u00a0on Israel. \u201cWe unequivocally condemn this act of hatred and desecration. Our hearts go out to the families affected by this senseless vandalism. The Jewish community in Cincinnati is resilient, and we are committed to repairing the damage and restoring the sanctity of these sacred spaces,\u201d the federation\u2019s release said. Sue Susskind, executive director of the Jewish Cemeteries of Greater Cincinnati, told CNN, \u201cUntil you walk that ground and feel it, I mean, it\u2019s horrendous. I\u2019ve never felt anything like that in my life.\u201d While the organization has not yet been able to identify all the graves affected, Susskind said law enforcement has now granted permission for the gravestones to be repaired and inspected. Some of the gravestones are so heavy, they will have to be lifted up by cranes, she said. Two monument companies have reached out and are willing to donate their services in restoring the vandalized stones, Susskind told CNN. First, they hope to identify names and pull reports from the Jewish Cemeteries database, Susskind said. For the older graves not in the system, the organization will have to \u201cgo on the ground and try to figure it out.\u201d CNN observed on Wednesday that at least six of the overturned graves were those of US veterans.  According to Susskind, families are currently allowed to enter the cemeteries and find their loved ones\u2019 gravestones before reporting if that gravestone is \u201cup or down\u201d in order to reduce the list of suspected impacted areas. Janson Becker is one resident who came to check on the gravestones of his parents and several other family members at Covedale Cemeteries. While his family\u2019s graves were safe, Becker told CNN he felt \u201ca combination of anger and sadness\u201d about what occurred, describing it as a \u201cfeeling of being violated.\u201d But Becker offered a hopeful message to the families affected, despite the negative feelings. \u201cYou can be angry about it. You can be sad about it. But be at peace about it because this is just a symbolic resting place. Your loved ones are in a better place,\u201d Becker said. \u201cSo, they\u2019re OK. We\u2019re the ones hurting.\u201d Becker said he hopes there will be justice for the perpetrators, but added it\u2019s not his place to decide what that justice will be. \u201cI think the odds of catching them are fairly slim, and if they don\u2019t get their justice here, then they have to go through their lifetime wondering what their justice is going to be when they meet their maker,\u201d Becker said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/02/us/cincinnati-jewish-cemeteries-vandalism/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/08/2024", "section": "us"}}

Baldwin was indicted earlier this year on a charge of involuntary manslaughter in the shooting, which left Hutchins dead and injured director Joel Souza when a gun he held fired a live round during a scene rehearsal on the set.

A dramatic increase in jobs could have pushed the Federal Reserve to hold off on cutting rates, keeping lending costs high for businesses and households. But June\u2019s more modest job gains show that the labor market remains strong but is gradually ebbing. Also factoring into the Fed\u2019s equation for a potential future rate cut is the previous CPI report, which showed inflation cooled more than expected in May.

{"id": "2024_07_05_us_nashville-school-shooter-writings", "text": "The writings of the person who\u00a0killed three 9-year-olds and three adults\u00a0at a private Christian elementary school in Nashville last year cannot be released to the public, a judge ruled Thursday. Chancery Court Judge I\u2019Ashea Myles found that The Covenant School children and parents hold the copyright to any writings or other works created by shooter Audrey Hale, a former student who was killed by police. Hale\u2019s parents inherited the works and then transferred ownership to the families. Myles ruled that \u201cthe original writings, journals, art, photos and videos created by Hale\u201d are subject to an exception to the Tennessee Public Records Act created by the federal Copyright Act. The ruling comes more than a year after several groups filed public records requests for documents seized by Metro Nashville Police during their investigation into the\u00a0March 2023 shooting. The shooter left behind at least 20 journals, a suicide note and a memoir, according to court filings. When the records requests were denied, several parties sued, and the situation quickly ballooned into a messy mix of conspiracy theories,\u00a0leaked documents, probate battles and\u00a0accusations of ethical misconduct. Myles\u2019 order will almost surely be appealed. After the initial records requests last year, police said they would eventually release the documents but could not do so right away because their investigation was still open. The groups suing for the immediate release of the records \u2014 including news outlets, a gun rights group, a law enforcement nonprofit and Tennessee state Sen. Todd Gardenhire \u2014 argued that there was no meaningful criminal investigation underway since Hale, who police say acted alone, was dead. Meanwhile, a group of Covenant parents was allowed to intervene in the case and argue that the records should never become public. They said the release would be traumatic for the families and could inspire copycat attacks. As part of the effort to keep the records closed, Hale\u2019s parents transferred ownership of Hale\u2019s property to the parents\u2019 group. Attorneys for the parents then argued they owned the copyright, further reason the records could not be released. Also intervening in the case were The Covenant School and the Covenant Presbyterian Church, which shares a building. They argued the records should remain closed because their release could threaten their security. Part of the interest in the records stems from the fact that Hale, who police say was \u201cassigned female at birth,\u201d may have identified as a transgender man. Republican Sen. Josh Hawley, of Missouri, is among those who have promoted a theory that the shooting was a hate crime against Christians. The delay in releasing the writings fueled speculation \u2014 particularly in conservative circles \u2014 over what they might contain and conspiracy theories about why police wouldn\u2019t immediately release them. As the court case has dragged on, pages from one journal were\u00a0leaked to a conservative commentator\u00a0who posted them to social media in November. More recently, The Tennessee Star\u00a0published dozens of stories\u00a0based on allegedly 80 pages of Hale\u2019s writings provided by an unnamed source. The publication is among the plaintiffs, and Myles briefly threatened to hold the paper\u2019s editor-in-chief, Michael Leahy, and owner, Star News Digital Media, in contempt.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/05/us/nashville-school-shooter-writings/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/08/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_07_07_us_north-carolina-artifacts-church", "text": "When not leading sermons, the Rev. Daniel Cenci\u00a0is quite the history buff. Cenci\u2019s two passions coincided when a plethora of centuries-old items were found June 20 in the yard of Christ Episcopal Church in Elizabeth City, North Carolina, where Cenci has served as rector since 2019. He said the church\u2019s construction crew was digging up a century-old magnolia tree when the mundane quickly turned into something extraordinary around lunchtime. The crew had hit something while digging up a pit for drainage underneath the stump. When Cenci saw the almost dome-like shape of the structure the crew had hit, he thought it was a crypt or an unmarked soldier\u2019s grave\u00a0given the many battles fought in eastern North Carolina\u00a0during\u00a0the Civil War. Cenci enlisted the help of a nearby parishioner to poke around. Soon, the two had pulled out a bone that was eight inches long. \u201cI thought, \u2018Oh gosh, maybe that\u2019s a crypt after all,\u2019\u201d Cenci told CNN. After telling the construction crew to go home for the day, artifacts like pottery, old and broken dishes, glassware, bottles and more bones were unearthed from the loose, sandy\u00a0terrain\u00a0filled with bricks. With guidance and inspection from a local museum and a specialist in early porcelain dating, the items were roughly dated\u00a0from the early 1700s up through the mid-1800s. The bones didn\u2019t belong to human bodies but to\u00a0animals \u2013\u00a0including\u00a0a possible jawbone from a wild boar. \u201cThe guess right now is maybe (the spot) is either a root cellar that was associated with an early home or a cistern for water storage, again associated with another early home in the city,\u201d Cinci said. The\u00a0North Carolina Office of State Archaeology\u00a0from the Raleigh and Greenville offices were called in to possibly further identify and date the items. Five days later, the ground was excavated, according to\u00a0CNN affiliate WTKR. After the state office agreed with the artifacts\u2019 initial dating estimate, they\u00a0were\u00a0labeled and placed on\u00a0plates in the church\u2019s kitchen until they can\u00a0be sent to the state office\u2019s conservation laboratory for testing. Cenci was told that either a team from the Raleigh or Greenville archeology offices would return to the site, a graduate student from a local university would be tasked with continuing the excavation or the church\u00a0could\u00a0hire an outside archaeological firm. CNN has reached out to the state office of archaeology in Raleigh for comment. Christ Episcopal Church\u00a0was founded in 1825\u00a0but the building it currently occupies wasn\u2019t built until 1856, according to Cenci. From research done by church parishioners\u00a0Ian Lowry, Robyn Nix and Sam Mancla,\u00a0who dug into deeds, wills and estate documents at the Pasquotank County courthouse, the group has discovered a Black man named George Davis used to own the property in the early 1800s that the church sits on \u2013 on two of the most premier lots in the city. His daughter Charlotte was married in the Episcopal church in 1833, according to church records and as posted by\u00a0Lowry on Facebook.\u00a0Nothing is confirmed yet, but some of the artifacts are thought to have been owned by Davis, Cenci explained. \u201c(Davis) did very well for himself based on the items that have come out of the excavation site,\u201d Cenci said. \u201cWe\u2019ve found bottles of French wine and we found imported porcelain from China \u2026 It seems we have uncovered the history of an early African American in our community that was quite influential (and) quite affluent in the town which I think is really interesting.\u201d Cenci said all he did was stop the construction; Lowry, Nix and Mancla are \u201creally the heroes in this story as far as finding out what was in there and why it matters.\u201d With the church being founded in 1825, this discovery comes just in time for its 200th anniversary. \u201cAs a Christian, I believe it\u2019s God\u2019s providential timing that it would happen right as we\u2019re coming into our 200th anniversary,\u201d Cenci said. \u201cWe\u2019re getting\u00a0this \u2013 almost like a time capsule \u2013\u00a0back to when the church was founded.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/07/us/north-carolina-artifacts-church/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/08/2024", "section": "us"}}

And the PTSD from the Camp Fire kicked in instantly, especially with how big the cloud of smoke was,\u201d Penick said. The Camp Fire was the\u00a0deadliest wildfire in California\u2019s history. Before the Maui fires, it was the deadliest wildfire in the US in more than a century as well, according to the\u00a0National Fire Protection Association. On Tuesday around 2:30 p.m. PT, Penick packed up her things in Oroville with her 5-year-old son, her fianc\u00e9 and her fianc\u00e9\u2019s two kids. The family is among the thousands of residents evacuated as the Thompson Fire continues to burn in Butte County, just about 20 miles south of Paradise. \u201cBy then, you could just see the cloud of smoke right there behind my house. And it started to get orange,\u201d\u00a0Penick said.\u00a0\u201cWe gathered as much stuff as we could. Our three dogs, our dog crates, all the dog food, my kids\u2019 favorite toys, all their diapers and wipes, their favorite bedding, their chairs.\u201d After the Camp Fire, Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E) reached an\u00a0$11 billion settlement with insurance companies and admitted it\u00a0was\u00a0\u201cprobable\u201d that its equipment started the 2018 Camp Fire. Penick is one of the people who received settlement money. She\u00a0has received one payment so far, and she used it to pay for her car and the rent on her Oroville house in advance,\u00a0she told CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s scary. It\u2019s sad. I\u2019ve worked hard to try and find this house. And the fact that the Camp Fire is the only way that I got this house with that settlement, and for it to just be gone again would just be devastating to me,\u201d she said. Penick also just found out she\u2019s pregnant, just like she was when she had to flee the Camp Fire in 2018. \u201cI was almost seven and a half months pregnant with my son Andrew. And he\u2019s five now,\u201d\u00a0she recalled.\u00a0\u201cAnd there was five of us, two dogs and a cat \u2026 and not one of us had a car. And so we were walking, and we walked for almost a mile. And some guy in a big white truck named Butch, he picked us up and he put us in the bed of his truck.

{"id": "2024_07_06_politics_biden-abc-interview-analysis", "text": "President Joe Biden\u2019s struggle to prove he\u2019s got the strength and cognitive capacity for a second term is becoming an excruciating personal and national ordeal. Watching a visibly aged Biden answer frank questions Friday about his health on primetime television \u2013 which would normally remain between a patient and their doctor \u2013 felt like an affront to presidential dignity. It was sad to see a person who\u2019s respected and beloved by many Americans suffer such a plight. And it would be a hard heart that did not empathize with Biden as he confronts the painful human realities of aging in the most public manner imaginable. Yet Biden\u2019s position, his shocking presidential debate performance and his defiant refusal to contemplate its implications for his reelection campaign, mean he\u2019s forcing the country to have the conversation. The political tide may be turning against Biden, but the interview underscored his deep pride in a presidency that it took him nearly half a century to achieve. And he\u2019s not close to giving up his lifelong mantra to stand up and fight when he\u2019s knocked down \u2013 a factor that will exacerbate the Democratic Party\u2019s dilemma. While his interview performance was far stronger than the president\u2019s often incoherent showing at the CNN debate in Atlanta, that\u2019s not saying much. It did not contain any new disasters that would push him immediately out of the race. But it equally did little to quell the storm assailing his campaign and raised fresh intrigue about his health amid increasing signs his Democratic power base is beginning to crack. It\u2019s becoming clear that the president, his party and the country are slipping inexorably into a political crisis that raises the extraordinary possibility that a presumptive nominee could be pushed aside weeks before his party\u2019s national convention and four months before one of the most critical elections in history. The threats to Biden\u2019s prospects are quickly mounting. Two more Democratic congressman Friday called on the president to cede the nomination to a younger candidate. Virginia Sen. Mark Warner moved forward with an effort to get Senate Democrats on the same page about Biden\u2019s future and is reaching a place where he thinks it\u2019s time for Biden to suspend his campaign, a source familiar with his efforts told CNN. And House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries scheduled a virtual meeting with ranking party committee members as he faces increasing pressure from his conference over Biden\u2019s position, a Democratic lawmaker said. A test set by the campaign Biden\u2019s campaign had scheduled the interview with ABC News to try to prove that the president\u2019s stumbling debate performance last week was an aberration and to shut down growing doubts about his position as his party\u2019s 2024 nominee. He appeared more composed and fluent than at the CNN debate. He made a far more robust argument for his own successes in office and more effectively prosecuted a case against Trump than he did in the debate. And he dug in deeper despite calls by a handful of a Democratic lawmakers for him to fold his reelection bid and the growing panic among many others yet to break cover. He also dismissed concerns about his health, insisting that he was not frailer than before. \u201cCan I run the 100 (in) 10 flat? No, but I\u2019m still in good shape,\u201d Biden said. \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody\u2019s more qualified to be president or win this race than me,\u201d Biden said in the interview conducted in swing state Wisconsin. \u201cIf the Lord Almighty came down and said, \u2018Joe, get out of the race,\u2019 I\u2019d get out of the race,\u201d Biden said, but added: \u201cThe Lord Almighty\u2019s not coming down.\u201d But Biden\u2019s admission that he felt \u201cterrible\u201d in the days before his clash with the Republican presumptive nominee Donald Trump only posed new questions about his health. Those questions come at a time of growing anxiety that he\u2019s well enough at 81 to shoulder the exhausting demands of the presidency and the strain of a reelection bid. Biden compounded those doubts by seeming unsure about whether he\u2019d watched a playback of the debate \u2013 \u201cI don\u2019t think so, no,\u201d he said when asked if he\u2019d watched the event \u2013 and other moments in which he trailed off in some sentences. And he added yet another explanation for his poor debate performance to add to his allies\u2019 claims he was overloaded with facts by staff, jet-lagged and suffering from a cold. The president said Trump\u2019s insistence on speaking even though his microphone was muted had put him off. Asked whether he was the same man who took office three years ago, Biden deflected by offering a litany of his achievements. \u201cIn terms of successes, yes,\u201d he said. \u201cI also was the guy who put together a peace plan for the Middle East that may be coming to fruition. I was also the guy that expanded NATO. I was also the guy that grew the economy. All the individual things that were done were ideas I had or I fulfilled. I moved on.\u201d The president was adamant that the debate was a only \u201ca bad night\u201d for which he took responsibility. But more than a week after the event, and amid rising fear among Democrats about his prospects in November and the possibility of what it will mean for democracy if Trump wins a second term, one thing is becoming increasingly clear. One bad night on such a high-profile stage before millions of viewers may be all it takes to irretrievably damage the campaign of president who will be 82 two weeks after Election Day, who large majorities of Americans worry is unfit to serve and who is asking the country to keep him in office until January 2029. Americans are worried about the next four years, not the last three Biden and his supporters warn that his painful 90 minutes on stage in Atlanta should not overshadow the achievements of his time in office. And they say that the threat posed by Trump and his autocratic instincts and vow to dedicate a second presidency to \u201cretribution\u201d far outweigh concerns over Biden\u2019s capacity. But the question that millions of Americans are asking has less to do with a review of Biden\u2019s first-term legacy and is more about whether he can function for four more grueling White House years. The interview also begged the question of whether the president is fully aware of the corrosive impact of the debate on confidence among Democrats over his chances of beating Trump. He quarreled with ABC News\u2019 George Stephanopoulos over polling that showed him slipping further behind the former president nationally and in swing states. The interview was one of a series of events, including the Friday rally and a planned news conference at the NATO summit next week in Washington, that the campaign has held up as moments to prove Biden\u2019s fitness. But Democratic Rep. Brad Sherman of California told CNN that the president needed to do a prolonged and live television interview unlike the recorded one on ABC. Other members are demanding the president get out far more to prove his stamina, even though the campaign on Friday promised an \u201caggressive\u201d program of events in July. But that pledge did not stop the growing demands for Biden to step aside. \u201cPresident Biden has done enormous service to our country, but now is the time for him to follow in one of our founding father, George Washington\u2019s, footsteps and step aside to let new leaders rise up and run against Donald Trump,\u201d\u00a0Massachusetts Rep. Seth\u00a0Moulton\u00a0told Boston radio station WBUR in an interview that went out before the ABC interview aired. And\u00a0Illinois Rep. Mike\u00a0Quigley\u00a0said Biden\u2019s continued presence in the race has \u201calmost no hope of succeeding.\u201d \u201cI would say Mr. President, your legacy is set. We owe you the greatest debt of gratitude. The only thing you can do now to cement that for all-time and prevent utter catastrophe is to step down and let someone else do this,\u201d\u00a0Quigley told MSNBC.\u00a0He later added on CNN: \u201cWhat we need right now \u2013 and what I think takes a spine \u2013 is to step aside and recognize the president of the United States doesn\u2019t have the vigor necessary to overcome the deficit here and it\u2019s going to affect us all.\u201d Massachusetts Gov.\u00a0Maura\u00a0Healey did not go quite so far but said in a statement to CNN that Biden needed to \u201ccarefully evaluate whether he remains our best hope to defeat Trump. Whatever President Biden decides, I am committed to doing everything in my power to defeat Donald Trump.\u201d The agonizing over Biden\u2019s fate is especially painful for Democrats because many of them believe that the president has done a good job in reviving the post-Covid-19 economy, powering job growth, harnessing US allies overseas and passing big-ticket infrastructure and climate change plans. But increasingly, it seems as though the fear of a Trump term may be overwhelming satisfaction with Biden\u2019s achievements. To temper such worries, Biden used the rally to pivot from questions about his age to try to refocus attention on what he\u2019d actually done in office. \u201cI keep seeing all\u00a0those stories about I\u2019m being too\u00a0old,\u201d he said. \u201cLet me say something. I wasn\u2019t too\u00a0old\u00a0to create over 15 million new jobs. To make sure 21 million Americans are insured under the Affordable Care Act. Was I too\u00a0old\u00a0to release student debt for nearly 5 million Americans? Too\u00a0old\u00a0to put the first Black woman on the Supreme Court in the United States of America?\u201d After the debate, Biden\u2019s every word is under intense scrutiny and risks bolstering a critical narrative about his age and mental acuity after he seared an image of a struggling, president diminished by age in the mind of viewers. So, one fatalistic statement in the ABC interview about how he\u2019d feel next January if Trump won is likely to inflame concerns of many Democrats about his mindset, his understanding of his situation and what will happen in November. \u201cI\u2019ll feel as long as I gave it my all and I did the goodest job as I know I can do, that\u2019s what this is about,\u201d Biden said. The Biden campaign later contacted CNN to argue that the president had not said \u201cgoodest\u201d and ABC News changed its transcript of the interview to read \u201cI did the good as job as I know I can do.\u201d An editor\u2019s note said the transcript was \u201cupdated for clarity.\u201d The audio of the sentence is not conclusive on the question. But the situation underscored the extent to which every word the president utters following the debate is under the highest scrutiny.

Lomax said the station prides itself on being an independent, trustworthy voice for its primary audience of Black Philadelphians and that using questions that were provided ahead of time \u201cjeopardizes that trust and is not a practice that WURD Radio engages in or endorses as a matter of practice or official policy.\u201d \u201cWURD Radio is not a mouthpiece for the Biden or any other Administration,\u201d she added. Lawful-Sanders, who hosted \u201cThe Source,\u201d spoke with Biden last week and asked him four questions about what\u2019s at stake in this election, his accomplishments, his debate performance and what he would say to hesitant voters. In an interview Saturday with CNN\u2019s Victor Blackwell, she said those questions were part of eight that were recommended to her by Biden aides ahead of the interview. \u201cThe questions were sent to me for approval. I approved them,\u201d she said. The move has further inflamed the maelstrom that has been swirling over Biden\u2019s acuity since his lackluster performance in the first presidential debate, which was hosted by CNN. Biden\u2019s debate performance has left many top Democrats wringing their hands in frustration and concern amid talk that he should not accept the party\u2019s nomination. \u201cIf the White House is trying now to prove the vim, vigor \u2026 of the president, I don\u2019t know how they do that by sending questions first before the interview so that the president knows what\u2019s coming,\u201d said Blackwell. Blackwell pointed out that both Lawful-Sanders and Earl Ingram, host of \u201cThe Earl Ingram Show\u201d in Milwaukee who also interviewed the president this week, asked Biden \u201cessentially the same questions.\u201d A Biden campaign spokesperson on Saturday did not deny the campaign provided questions, but said, \u201cWe do not condition interviews on acceptance of these questions.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not at all an uncommon practice for interviewees to share topics they would prefer. These questions were relevant to the news of the day \u2014 the president was asked about this debate performance as well as what he\u2019d delivered for black Americans,\u201d spokesperson Lauren Hitt said in a statement. The Biden campaign said later Saturday it will no longer suggest questions to interviewers. \u201cWhile interview hosts have always been free to ask whatever questions they please, moving forward we will refrain from offering suggested questions,\u201d a source familiar with the Biden booking operation told CNN.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/07/media/biden-interview-radio-host-philadelphia/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/08/2024", "section": "us"}}
