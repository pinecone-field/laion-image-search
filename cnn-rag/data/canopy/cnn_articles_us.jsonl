Americans consume more than 20 billion hot dogs each year, most of them during the summer months. Between Memorial Day and Labor Day, Americans eat an estimated 818 hot dogs every second, according to the National Hot Dog and Sausage Council. But nothing tops July Fourth on Coney Island in Brooklyn, New York, where people compete to eat as many hot dogs and buns as humanly possible in 10 minutes at the Nathan\u2019s Famous International Hot Dog Eating Contest. Tens of thousands of spectators every year brave the unpredictable summer weather to watch the contest at the Nathan\u2019s Famous flagship restaurant. Over time, the competition has become synonymous with the holiday and established itself as an iconic American tradition. The current record for most hot dogs eaten at a competition is 76 hot dogs, held by 16-time champion Joey \u201cJaws\u201d Chestnut. That\u2019s more than the 70 franks and buns that the average American eats over the course of a year. After dethroning Takeru Kobayashi in 2007, Chestnut went on to beat his own record eight times, in less than 20 years. Women competed alongside the men until 2011, when they started competing separately. Chestnut won in 2023 with a healthy lead of 13 hot dogs. At this year\u2019s contest, however, competitive eating\u2019s biggest star will not be participating. After agreeing to a sponsorship deal with Impossible Foods, a company that develops plant-based meats and is a competitor to Nathan\u2019s Famous Hot Dogs, Chestnut was barred. Miki Sudo, reigning champion of the women\u2019s contest and nine-time winner of the Mustard Belt, defended her title with 39.5 hot dogs. The estimated 40,000 people who attend the event, according to Nathan\u2019s, would exceed capacity at the seven other popular hot-dog-eating venues: MLB stadiums. The Padres\u2019 Petco Park, the Pirates\u2019 PNC Park, the Twins\u2019 Target Field, the Royals\u2019 Kauffman Stadium, the Red Sox\u2019s Fenway Park, the Marlins\u2019 loanDepot Park and the Guardians\u2019 Progressive Field all have capacity below 40,000. MLB games are a major venue for hot dog consumption: In 2020, ballparks sold 19.4 million hot dogs. Viewership on TV often exceeds 1 million viewers. The all-time viewership record was 2.8 million for an encore presentation following World Cup coverage in 2014, according to Sports Media Watch. Whoever lifts the Mustard Belt this Independence Day will be the reigning champion of a uniquely American sport. For their part, amateur hot dog eaters at barbecues across the nation will consume 150 million hot dogs during the holiday, according to the National Hot Dog and Sausage Council.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/03/us/american-history-nathans-hot-dog-eating-contest-dg/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/05/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_07_04_business_germany-blocks-vw-subsidiary-china", "text": "Germany has blocked the sale of a Volkswagen subsidiary to China on national security grounds, delivering a fresh blow to the already tense relationship with its biggest trading partner. MAN Energy Solutions, part of the Volkswagen Group, said in June 2023 that it planned to sell its gas turbines business to Chinese state-owned CSIC Longjiang GH Gas Turbine Co (GHGT). But a German government review, initiated in September, raised concerns that China might use the gas turbines to power warships, according to Reuters. The decision to block the deal comes just weeks after the European Union hiked tariffs on electric vehicles from China, sparking a trade dispute with Beijing, which days later launched an investigation into prices of EU pork. During a press conference Wednesday, Germany\u2019s economy minister Robert Habeck said that Berlin welcomes investments from foreign companies, but technologies relevant to \u201cpublic security\u201d must be protected from countries \u201cwhich maybe do not always have a friendly relationship with us.\u201d At the same press conference, Interior Minister Nancy Faeser said she welcomed the government\u2019s decision \u201cfor security reasons.\u201d Germany and China traded goods worth \u20ac255 billion ($275.3 billion) last year, according to German government figures. But Berlin\u2019s relationship with Beijing has come under strain in recent years, as Germany tries to protect local manufacturers and reduce its dependence on China. It was burned badly by its close economic ties with Russia after the invasion of Ukraine \u2014 in particular a heavy reliance on Russian natural gas \u2014 and wants to reduce the risks of something similar happening in future. In November 2022, Germany blocked the sale of one of its semiconductor factories to a Chinese-owned tech company, also citing security concerns. A spokesperson for China\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Thursday that China opposes the \u201cpoliticization\u201d of \u201cnormal commercial cooperation.\u201d \u201cWe hope that Germany will provide a fair, just and non-discriminatory business environment for companies from all over the world, including Chinese companies.\u201d MAN Energy Solutions said it respected the government\u2019s decision. \u201c(We) will now initiate a structured process to close-down the gas turbine division, which will take place over the coming months,\u201d the company added in a statement shared with CNN. The additional EU tariffs, which could add as much as 38% to the cost of importing an electric car from China, will take effect from Friday for an initial period of four months. The EU must decide by November whether to adopt the tariffs for five years. In a statement Thursday, the European Commission said that \u201cconsultations with the Chinese government have intensified in recent weeks,\u201d with a view to resolving the dispute. Volkswagen, Europe\u2019s biggest carmaker, reiterated earlier comments that the timing of the EU decision is \u201cdetrimental to the current weak demand\u201d for EVs in Germany and the region. \u201cThe negative effects of this decision outweigh any potential benefits for the European and especially the German automotive industry,\u201d the company added in a statement.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/04/business/germany-blocks-vw-subsidiary-china/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/05/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_07_04_politics_biden-governors-sleep", "text": "President Joe Biden told Democratic governors during a meeting at the White House on Wednesday that part of his plan going forward is to stop scheduling events after 8 p.m. so that he can get more sleep, according to three sources briefed on his comments. The remarks, first reported by The New York Times, came as the 81-year-old Biden sought to reassure a group of more than 20 state leaders about his ability to defeat former President Donald Trump in November and govern effectively for another four years. Biden\u2019s comment left several of the governors in the room frustrated, sources told CNN, and is one of the reasons that some of the participants have been rankled by the statement of loyalty and enthusiasm from them distributed by the Biden campaign on Thursday. The White House did not immediately comment about what the president said. A Biden campaign aide argued that, as well as doing debate prep in the week after his two trips to Europe, Biden was engaged in hours of official work in addition to the hours of campaign work. \u201cPresident (George W.) Bush went to bed at 9, and President (Barack) Obama made dinner\u00a0at 6:30,\u201d said Biden campaign spokesperson Kevin Munoz. \u201cNormal presidents strike a balance, and so does Joe Biden. Hardly the same rigor as Donald Trump, who spends half of his day ranting on Truth Social about plans that would cause a recession and the other half golfing.\u201d Biden also made a joke to the governors that didn\u2019t go over well: \u201cI\u2019m fine \u2014 I don\u2019t know about my brain, though.\u201d Jen O\u2019Malley Dillon, Biden\u2019s campaign chairwoman, said the president was \u201cclearly making a joke and then said, \u2018All kidding aside.\u2019\u201d In the wake of Biden\u2019s poor performance during CNN\u2019s presidential debate last week,\u00a0some Democrats have begun to call for the president to drop out of the race, leaving the White House scrambling to convince skeptics within the party and voters. In the days after, administration officials have provided confusing and conflicting explanations as they attempted to spin a performance that exacerbated voters\u2019 concerns about Biden\u2019s age. Biden himself on Thursday signaled that he intends to\u00a0remain in the race, telling military service members and their families that he would stay on. An attendee at the July Fourth barbecue at the White House said to the president, \u201cWe need you.\u201d \u201cYou got me,\u201d the president responded, before the attendee yelled again. \u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere,\u201d Biden reiterated. Following the Wednesday meeting, Govs. Wes Moore of Maryland, Kathy Hochul of New York and Tim Walz of Minnesota painted a positive picture of the meeting during a news conference, adding that Biden is \u201call in\u201d and \u201cin it to win it.\u201d In response to a reporter\u2019s question, Walz dismissed any concerns about Biden\u2019s age and health, saying the president is \u201cfit for office.\u201d Campaigning for Biden in South Haven, Michigan,  on Thursday, California Gov. Gavin\u00a0Newsom \u2014 who attended the meeting in person \u2014 told CNN that Biden\u2019s acknowledging his fatigue shows he\u2019s \u201chuman\u201d and said he felt people were making too much of the remark. \u201cLook at his schedule, look at the fundraising things that you don\u2019t see. All that work, the work you\u2019re doing behind the scenes, the phone calls you\u2019re making times all times of night. Alliance management, everything he\u2019s doing to prepare for NATO this week, what they\u2019re doing to land a deal with Hamas and Israel,\u201d Newsom said. Biden, the oldest president in US history, has faced questions around his age and health for years. They came to a head during the debate, when he was hoarse and at times unintelligible, leaving Trump \u2014\u00a0who is only three years younger than Biden \u2014\u00a0to appear more fit. The majority of debate watchers deemed the former president as the winner of the stand-off, according to a CNN poll. And Biden\u2019s debate performance opened the floodgates for more scrutiny and reporting on the president\u2019s health, with sources describing a decline in his mental fitness. The New York Times reported earlier this week that the president\u2019s \u201clapses\u201d have increased and grown more worrisome, with a source telling the Times that Biden\u2019s six-day debate preparations at Camp David didn\u2019t start before 11 a.m. and that the president was given time to nap each day. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre sidestepped a question during Wednesday\u2019s briefing about whether the president takes daily afternoon naps following the Times\u2019 reporting. But she offered jet lag and travel fatigue as an explanation for Biden\u2019s poor debate performance after previously chalking it up to a cold. Amid increasing pressure to consider dropping out of the race and growing concern whether he can serve another term, CNN has previously reported that Biden has privately expressed that the next stretch of days will be critical for whether he can save his reelection bid.  This story has been updated with additional details.

{"id": "2024_07_04_business_heat-keep-your-power-bill-down", "text": "Emma Corrado tries to be conscious of her electricity usage, both as an aspiring biosystems engineer with a focus on natural resources and a self-proclaimed \u201cbroke college student\u201d at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. But on the tail of a record-breaking heatwave that swept the Midwest and Northeast, she\u2019s finding it difficult to keep costs down. Corrado told CNN that the power bill for the two-bedroom apartment she shares with a roommate in Madison, Wisconsin, usually averages about $21 a month. Come summer, it spikes to $100\u2014 a jump she attributes to the cost of air conditioning. To escape the sweltering temperatures, Corrado seeks refuge at her workplace rather than keeping the air conditioner running at home. \u201cI have the option to work remotely, but I tend not to because the building we work in has really good AC,\u201d she said. Americans\u2019 power bills are expected to soar this summer, as heat waves have already begun baking parts of the country. But experts say there are ways to keep cool without breaking the bank \u2013 or at least to limit how much you\u2019re shelling out each month. Be strategic with your temperature setting Do use your air conditioner or other systems to keep cool. \u201cHeat is the number one weather-related killer,\u201d said Annie Carforo, climate justice campaigns manager for WE ACT for Environmental Justice, a community activist group. Carforo cited New York City\u2019s 2024 Heat-Related Mortality Report, which found that the most likely location for heat-related deaths was inside homes that had no AC or had an AC that was not in use. But be mindful of the temperature to which you set your air conditioner. \u201cWe advise people to set your air conditioner to the highest temperature that you\u2019re comfortable with,\u201d said Jamie McShane, director of media relations for New York-based energy company Con Edison. \u201cEvery degree that you increase the thermostat lowers your cost.\u201d Carforo says that some Americans are keeping their air conditioners off entirely when they head out for the day. But keeping your AC off when you\u2019re not home may actually result in higher bills later on. According to the Department of Energy, the smaller the difference between the temperatures inside and outside your home, the lower your overall cooling bill will be. The department says that setting your thermostat to a colder setting when you first turn on your AC may result in unnecessary expenses as it forces your AC to work harder to offset the outside heat. For this reason, it recommends equipping your home with a programmable thermostat that can adjust the temperature according to a preset schedule. \u201cYou can keep (your temperature) up to 78 and still be perfectly safe,\u201d said Mark Wolfe, the executive director of the National Energy Assistance Directors Association, but he advises against making the change abruptly. Instead, he recommends gradually upping the thermostat by one degree every couple of days to acclimate to the new temperature. Invest in your home\u2019s energy efficiency Wolfe anticipates that Americans may need to spend more on their electricity bill as climate change makes for hotter Septembers. One long-term solution is making sure your home\u2019s cooling system is up to date. \u201cEspecially if it\u2019s an old system, replacing it might be the better strategy than fixing it,\u201d he said. One way to gauge your cooling system\u2019s efficiency is by looking at your AC unit\u2019s seasonal energy efficiency ratio, or SEER rating. A higher rating indicates lower energy consumption levels and, in turn, lower costs of cooling. Upgrading from a SEER 10 unit to a SEER 14 could cut costs by 20%. But overhauling an existing cooling system can be pricey. That\u2019s why Wolfe encourages getting in touch with your local utility provider and taking advantage of available rebate programs. \u201cSome of these rebate programs are better than others, but they all make a difference. They all want to encourage you to make these improvements,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you buy a high efficiency furnace, if you buy a heat pump, if you install insulation, they provide subsidies to help you do that.\u201d McShane pointed to Con Edison\u2019s own residential rebate programs, which offer New Yorkers living in the Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan, Queens and Westchester up to $4,000 to get insulation professionally installed. \u201cYou can rail against it, but you can\u2019t stop it. Temperatures are continuing to rise,\u201d Wolfe said. \u201cWhat we can do is look at how we use energy and manage it better.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/04/business/heat-keep-your-power-bill-down/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/05/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_07_02_us_cincinnati-jewish-cemeteries-vandalism", "text": "(CNN) \u2014\u00a0Nearly 180 gravestones at two Jewish cemeteries in Cincinnati have been vandalized, according to the Jewish Cemeteries of Greater Cincinnati and the Jewish Federation of Cincinnati. Many of the gravestones \u2013 some dating back to the late 1800s \u2013 have been knocked face-down, with some cracked in half, at the Tifereth Israel and the Beth Hamedrash Hagadol cemeteries in the Covedale Cemetery complex, a news release on behalf of the Jewish Cemeteries of Greater Cincinnati, the Jewish Federation of Cincinnati and the Jewish Community Relations Council said. The vandalism is believed to have occurred between June 25 and July 1, the statement said, and was discovered Monday morning. The FBI, Cincinnati Police and Green Township of Hamilton County are investigating the incident but there are no known suspects, the release added. \u201cThe FBI Cincinnati Field Office, the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of Ohio, and the Justice Department\u2019s Civil Rights Division are working with local law enforcement partners to investigate the damage to gravestones at Tifereth Israel Cemetery and the Beth Hamedrash Hagadol Cemetery,\u201d The FBI said Thursday. \u201cWe encourage anyone with information about this vandalism to contact the FBI.\u201d Capt. Mitch Hill of the Green Township Police Department told CNN Wednesday the investigation is ongoing and no new information is available. \u201cThe vandalism of nearly 200 graves at two Jewish cemeteries near Cincinnati is despicable. This is Antisemitism and it is vile,\u201d President Joe Biden stated in a post on X Wednesday, \u201cI condemn these acts and commit my Administration to support investigators in holding those responsible accountable to the full extent of the law.\u201d The vandalism comes amid a rise in antisemitic incidents across the nation. The\u00a0most recent data\u00a0from the Anti-Defamation League, which has tracked antisemitic incidents in the US since 1979, found a 140% increase from 2022 to 2023, with a \u201cdramatic\u201d increase taking place after the October 7 Hamas\u00a0attacks\u00a0on Israel. \u201cWe unequivocally condemn this act of hatred and desecration. Our hearts go out to the families affected by this senseless vandalism. The Jewish community in Cincinnati is resilient, and we are committed to repairing the damage and restoring the sanctity of these sacred spaces,\u201d the federation\u2019s release said. Sue Susskind, executive director of the Jewish Cemeteries of Greater Cincinnati, told CNN, \u201cUntil you walk that ground and feel it, I mean, it\u2019s horrendous. I\u2019ve never felt anything like that in my life.\u201d While the organization has not yet been able to identify all the graves affected, Susskind said law enforcement has now granted permission for the gravestones to be repaired and inspected. Some of the gravestones are so heavy, they will have to be lifted up by cranes, she said. Two monument companies have reached out and are willing to donate their services in restoring the vandalized stones, Susskind told CNN. First, they hope to identify names and pull reports from the Jewish Cemeteries database, Susskind said. For the older graves not in the system, the organization will have to \u201cgo on the ground and try to figure it out.\u201d CNN observed on Wednesday that at least six of the overturned graves were those of US veterans.  According to Susskind, families are currently allowed to enter the cemeteries and find their loved ones\u2019 gravestones before reporting if that gravestone is \u201cup or down\u201d in order to reduce the list of suspected impacted areas. Janson Becker is one resident who came to check on the gravestones of his parents and several other family members at Covedale Cemeteries. While his family\u2019s graves were safe, Becker told CNN he felt \u201ca combination of anger and sadness\u201d about what occurred, describing it as a \u201cfeeling of being violated.\u201d But Becker offered a hopeful message to the families affected, despite the negative feelings. \u201cYou can be angry about it. You can be sad about it. But be at peace about it because this is just a symbolic resting place. Your loved ones are in a better place,\u201d Becker said. \u201cSo, they\u2019re OK. We\u2019re the ones hurting.\u201d Becker said he hopes there will be justice for the perpetrators, but added it\u2019s not his place to decide what that justice will be. \u201cI think the odds of catching them are fairly slim, and if they don\u2019t get their justice here, then they have to go through their lifetime wondering what their justice is going to be when they meet their maker,\u201d Becker said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/02/us/cincinnati-jewish-cemeteries-vandalism/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/05/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_07_04_us_blaze-bernstein-killing-conviction", "text": "A California man was convicted of murder with a hate crime enhancement Wednesday for the 2018 stabbing death of a gay University of Pennsylvania student. Samuel Woodward, 26, was found guilty of first-degree murder plus the enhancement in the killing of Blaze Bernstein, a gay, Jewish college sophomore who was home visiting his family in Southern California on winter break when he went missing. Authorities scoured the area for him and found his body a week later in a shallow grave at a nearby park. The question during the monthslong trial was not whether Woodward killed Bernstein but why, and the circumstances under which it happened. During closing arguments, prosecutor Jennifer Walker emphasized Woodward\u2019s affiliation with a violent, anti-gay, neo-Nazi extremist group known as Atomwaffen Division. \u201cThis is a person focused on hate,\u201d Walker said. \u201cNot following, not being led by, influenced by, victimized by Atomwaffen \u2014 seeking it out.\u201d With the hate crime enhancement, Woodward could face a sentence of life without parole. Ken Morrison, Woodward\u2019s attorney, sought at trial to show his client did not plan to kill Bernstein and did not hate anyone, in an effort for a conviction to be on a lesser charge such as second-degree murder or manslaughter. Morrison, who plans to appeal after sentencing, said the judge made some key rulings that denied \u201cjurors the ability to consider evidence critical to a fair trial.\u201d Bernstein\u2019s family said in a statement no verdict could \u201cerase the pain of losing our son and the agony of waiting all of these years without resolution,\u201d ABC News reported. \u201cHe was an amazing human and humanitarian and a person we were greatly looking forward to having in our lives, seeing wondrous things from him as his young life unfolded,\u201d the family said. \u201cFrom this funny, articulate, kind, intelligent, caring and brilliant scientist, artist, writer, chef and son, there will never be anyone quite like him.\u201d Woodward and Bernstein previously attended the same high school in Orange County and connected via a dating app in the months before the attack, according to testimony at trial. Woodward said he picked up Bernstein and went to a nearby park, and he repeatedly stabbed Bernstein after trying to grab a cellphone he feared had been used to photograph him. Prosecutors said Woodward joined Atomwaffen Division and repeatedly targeted gay men online by reaching out to them and then abruptly breaking off contact while keeping a hateful, profanity-laced journal of his actions. They said Woodward showed an interest in carrying out violent acts in the weeks before the killing and reached out to Bernstein online. \u201cHate will never be tolerated here in Orange County \u2014 and instead of a symbol to be revered by other haters, he is a symbol of how society will never tolerate those who terrorize the most vulnerable members of our society,\u201d county District Attorney Todd Spitzer said Wednesday in a statement. Morrison, the defense lawyer, told jurors Woodward faced challenges in his personal relationships due to a long-undiagnosed autism spectrum disorder and was confused about his sexuality after growing up in a politically conservative and devout Catholic family where his father openly criticized homosexuality. The case took years to go to trial after questions arose about Woodward\u2019s mental state and following multiple changes in defense attorneys. Woodward was deemed competent to stand trial in late 2022. Bernstein, who was 19 at the time, disappeared in January 2018 after he went out at night with Woodward to a park in Lake Forest, about 45 miles southeast of Los Angeles. After Bernstein missed a dentist appointment the next day, his parents found his glasses, wallet and credit cards in his bedroom and tried to contact him, but he did not respond to texts or calls. Authorities launched an exhaustive search and said Bernstein\u2019s family scoured his social media and saw he had communicated with Woodward on Snapchat. Authorities said Woodward told the family Bernstein had gone off to meet a friend in the park that night and did not return. Days later, Bernstein\u2019s body was found\u00a0in the shallow grave. He had been repeatedly stabbed in the face and neck. Authorities said they searched Woodward\u2019s family home in Newport Beach and found a folding knife with a bloodied blade in his room. They also found a black Atomwaffen mask with traces of blood and a host of anti-gay, antisemitic and hate group materials, prosecutors said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/04/us/blaze-bernstein-killing-conviction/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/05/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_07_04_politics_biden-netanyahu-call", "text": "The framework for a hostage and ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas is \u201cnow in place\u201d according to a senior administration official. That acknowledgement comes on the heels of President Joe Biden\u2019s call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday. The call came as\u00a0Israel\u00a0and Hamas appear to be on the brink of a framework agreement for a deal, an\u00a0Israeli source familiar with the negotiations has told CNN.\u00a0Hamas recently provided a response to the framework to Qatari and Egyptian mediators, a move Israeli officials believe will enable the two parties to enter detailed negotiations to reach an agreement. A deal, however, is still not finalized nor is it assured. Biden laid out the three-phase proposal in a May speech. The first phase would last six weeks and include the \u201cwithdrawal of Israeli forces from all populated areas of Gaza\u201d and \u201crelease of a number of hostages, including women, the elderly, the wounded in exchange for the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners.\u201d Phase 2 would allow for the \u201cexchange for the release of all remaining living hostages, including male soldiers.\u201d In Phase 3, the president said, a \u201cmajor reconstruction plan for Gaza would commence and any final remains of hostages who\u2019ve been killed will be returned to their families.\u201d The official noted that the two leaders during their call Thursday seemed to reach a \u201cbreakthrough\u201d on the transition from Phase 1 to Phase 2. The deal as it stands now is \u201cvery consistent\u201d with what the president had laid out in his May speech, the official added. \u201cSome of the key issues on the transition of a Phase 1 to Phase 2 have really been a stumbling block. I think we had a breakthrough in that area,\u201d the official said. \u201cThe text now is very consistent with the address of the president on May 27 and the UN Security Council resolution.\u201d The official cautioned that a final deal could take some time to come together, and that the administration will do \u201call\u201d that it can to help reach a final agreement. \u201cThis is not a deal that\u2019s going to come together in a period of days. There\u2019s still work to do, and we\u2019re prepared to do all we can to facilitate reaching an agreement as soon as possible, a final agreement,\u201d the official added. The call lasted 30 minutes and was \u201cfocused\u201d on the details of the hostage and ceasefire deal, according to a senior administration official, who added that Biden will have the opportunity to talk about the deal with other world leaders next week during the NATO summit, which will be held in Washington. When asked if the administration believes that Netanyahu is playing politics and could try to sabotage the deal, the official said that the deal is structed in a way that \u201cfully protects Israel\u2019s interests.\u201d Hostage talks are expected to be held in Doha starting as early as Friday and continue through the next few days, the official said. In a readout provided by the White House, Biden and Netanyahu discussed \u201congoing efforts to finalize a ceasefire deal together with the release of hostages.\u201d \u201cThe leaders discussed the recent response received from Hamas,\u201d the White House said. \u201cThe president welcomed the prime minister\u2019s decision to authorize his negotiators to engage with US, Qatari, and Egyptian mediators in an effort to close out the deal.\u201d Biden \u201creaffirmed his ironclad commitment to Israel\u2019s security,\u201d wrote the White House, which also announced a meeting on July 15 between the two leaders\u2019 national security teams. CNN\u00a0previously reported\u00a0the US recently proposed new language to help\u00a0bridge gaps in discussions for a deal. The proposed language focused on a period in the first phase of the proposal when Israel and Hamas would be expected to hold more negotiations with the goal of moving to the second phase of the deal. A US official says the response appears to be constructive while adding more work will need to continue. An Israeli official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to speak to the media, also told CNN that Netanyahu will convene a cabinet meeting Thursday night. Biden and\u00a0Netanyahu\u00a0last spoke on May 6. The two men are expected to meet in Washington in several weeks when the Israeli prime minister visits to address Congress, a source familiar with the matter previously told CNN\u2019s MJ Lee.\u00a0US and Israeli officials are still nailing down logistical details for the Biden-Netanyahu\u00a0meeting, which would likely take place at the White House, the source said.

{"id": "2024_07_03_us_mass-shootings-fourth-july-fbi-tips", "text": "Mass shooters generally don\u2019t just snap. Instead, they plot. And many outwardly display troubling signs along their pathway to violence. That assessment from the renowned profilers at the FBI\u2019s behavioral analysis units underpins a new effort by the bureau\u00a0to inform the public of key warning signs ahead of gatherings for the Fourth of July \u2013 a holiday period that researchers say tends to feature an increase in mass shootings. The FBI says that if people report seeing threat indicators that would-be shooters typically exhibit, they may very well prevent a massacre. What are the warning signs? \u201cYou have someone who may be more fixated on violence, maybe obsessively focusing on violent fantasies or ways to resolve their different challenges,\u201d said Karie Gibson, who leads one of the FBI\u2019s behavioral analysis units and holds a doctorate in psychology. \u201cThey may actually record or write a manifesto or an actual video or suicide note, to really want to take credit for this plan they are preparing to do.\u201d Noticeable shifts in behavior are also key. \u201cYou have somebody who, at one time in their life, was functioning in a way where they were handling the stress, and now we\u2019re seeing marked changes to that,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing that they have changes in their school performance or work performance; we\u2019re seeing that they are not participating in hobbies or areas of activities.\u201d For certain people, the \u201cpathway to violence, a lot of times, will begin with a grievance,\u201d Gibson said. \u201cIt can be a slight, it can be an injustice, it can be a wrong that has happened to them \u2013 it can be real or perceived.\u201d No single factor guarantees someone might commit a shooting, but when several concerning characteristics begin to manifest, it could be time to seek help, either from law enforcement, a principal or a supervisor, she said. \u2018Our best hope\u2019 \u201cFriends, family, teachers, classmates, workmates, and others similarly situated are our best hope,\u201d Katherine Schweit, mass shooting expert and former FBI executive, wrote in her book \u201cStop the Killing.\u201d These people often are best placed to pick up a phone and report concerns \u2013 but to make the correct move they may have to push themselves past any notion that they\u2019re not the ones who need to do it, Schweit warned. For example, she wrote, teachers may simply try to wait out a concerning student and pass them to the next grade. Parents ill-equipped to handle a struggling child may try to pass them off to another relative. Schweit wrote that those closest to a possible mass shooter might become desensitized to concerning conduct or may refuse to believe the end result could be an attack, but notes speaking up is critical to saving lives. \u201cWe have to accept a willingness to understand that what we see and hear may be a pattern of behaviors that might lead a person to act out violently,\u201d she wrote. \u2018Our worst week for shootings\u2019 Law enforcement statistics and independent researchers have continually pointed to summer months as a time of increased gun violence in the US. An especially violent period each year for both mass shootings and individual incidents: July 1-7. \u201cThat is always our worst week for shootings,\u201d said Mark Bryant, executive director of the Gun Violence Archive, a nonprofit that tracks gun deaths and injuries across America. Both CNN and the Gun Violence Archive define a mass shooting as an incident in which four or more people are shot, not including the shooter. July 4 itself accounted for more US mass shootings than any other single calendar day over roughly a decade, a 2023 CNN analysis of the Gun Violence Archive\u2019s mass shooting data since 2014 found. The day with the second most number of shootings was the day after \u2013 July 5. Over the past three years, 77 mass shootings happened collectively during the first week of July, Bryant said. \u201cThere are so many people in large groups during that period of time and it\u2019s usually extremely hot,\u201d Bryant said. \u201cYou\u2019ll find a difference in an area that is 95 degrees versus a place that is 65 degrees.\u201d That impact of heat on the rate of gun violence has been studied by academic researchers, who have noted how higher temperatures\u00a0can result in increased anger, agitation, and hostility. Other possible factors responsible for an uptick in violence around Independence Day include the consumption of alcohol at gatherings and the sheer number of guns now available in the US, which has often resulted in people attempting to settle disputes with firearms. Bryant says the odds are, \u201cwhen one gun comes out, other guns come out.\u201d More than \u2018mental illness\u2019 Although the FBI\u2019s behavioral analysts have long helped law enforcement agencies across the country prevent and solve crimes, the bureau ramped up its proactive approach to curbing gun deaths in 2018 following deadly mass shootings in Las Vegas and at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, Gibson said. That effort included building and supporting more than 150 federal, state, and local law enforcement threat assessment teams across the US to help stop the next mass shooter. As the initiative has progressed, the FBI has evolved to not just sharing information with law enforcement, but more proactively educating the public about the agency\u2019s behavioral research findings and warning signs. While a spate of mass killings in recent years has placed greater emphasis on the impact of mental health in driving certain acts of violence, a key finding of the FBI\u2019s examinations of active shooters across the nation has dispelled notions that all shooters are mentally ill, versus those individuals unable to handle the stresses of life, Gibson said. \u201cThis is lending towards really looking at how someone is coping with stress, how someone is managing their life when they\u2019re struggling,\u201d Gibson said. \u201cLet\u2019s help them, let\u2019s help get interventions, because it\u2019s more about that mental wellness issue that they\u2019re struggling with versus an actual mental illness.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/03/us/mass-shootings-fourth-july-fbi-tips/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/05/2024", "section": "us"}}

In 2021,\u00a0a jury ruled\u00a0white nationalist leaders and organizations had to pay more than $26 million in damages to those who suffered injuries from the rally. The \u201cUnite the Right\u201d rally was a two-day event to protest the city\u2019s plan to remove a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee. Approximately $24 million of the $26 million were for punitive damages, but a judge\u00a0later cut\u00a0that\u00a0amount to $350,000, meaning the eight plaintiffs were going to receive only $43,750 each. However, according to court documents, restoring more than $2 million of the slashed amount means each plaintiff will receive approximately $350,000. A three-judge panel of the Richmond-based 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals\u00a0found a state law which caps the total dollar amount\u00a0of punitive damages each person can receive to $350,000, court documents show. In Monday\u2019s opinion, Chief Judge Albert Diaz wrote, \u201c\u2026 we vacate the district court\u2019s order to the extent that it reduces the jury\u2019s punitive damages to $350,000 for all plaintiffs under the Virginia punitive damages cap. And we remand with instructions that the district court apply the cap instead on a per-plaintiff basis.\u201d Before the \u201cUnite the Right\u201d rally began, counter-protestors clashed with white nationalists and other right-wing groups which prompted local officials to declare the rally an \u201cunlawful assembly\u201d and the governor declared a state of emergency,\u00a0CNN previously reported. About two hours later, James Alex Fields Jr., a white supremacist from Maumee, Ohio, intentionally drove his car into a crowd of counter-protesters, killing one woman and injuring dozens more. Fields is serving a life sentence for murder and hate crimes. Fields\u2019 lawyer was not immediately\u202favailable for comment. When the defendants requested the court ask the Supreme Court to question the $350,000 rule, the 4th Circuit panel rejected it and said the law was \u201cclear enough to predict how Virginia\u2019s high court would rule.\u201d \u201cOver two years ago, the jury used its $24 million punitive damages award to send an unmistakable message to the defendants and to the public about the outrageous misconduct that took place in Charlottesville, Virginia,\u201d Diaz wrote in the 3-0 ruling. \u201cWhile the law compels us to reduce the award, it\u2019s long past time for that message to be delivered.\u201d CNN reached out to the defendants\u2019\u00a0lawyers who were not immediately available for comment.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/03/us/unite-the-right-victims-damages-reaj/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/05/2024", "section": "us"}}

Elizabeth Wolf, 42,\u00a0who\u00a0was arrested on May 19 in connection with the accusations in the Dallas-area city of Euless, had been charged with attempted capital murder of a person under 10 years old and injury to a child, but was released after posting bail. During a subsequent bond hearing on June 27, her bond for the attempted capital murder charge was increased to $1 million,\u00a0and she was taken back into custody, Euless police Capt. Brenda Alvarado told CNN Tuesday. Wolf still was in custody Tuesday, inmate records showed. The incident is being investigated as a hate crime, Alvarado said. The Tarrant County district attorney\u2019s office has received the case for filing and the matter remains under investigation, police said. CNN has sought comment from Wolf\u2019s attorney. A court date is set for October 17, a docket shows. Witnesses told police that \u201ca woman who was very intoxicated had tried to drown a child and argued with the child\u2019s mother\u201d at an apartment complex pool in Euless on May 19, police had said in a news release. Officers approached Wolf as she tried to leave, and she was taken into custody on suspicion of public intoxication, police said. The child\u2019s mother told police Wolf was questioning where she was from and whether the two children playing at the pool were hers, the news release said. The mother wore\u00a0a hijab and modest swimwear and the family is Muslim and Palestinian, according to the\u00a0Texas chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR). Wolf also made statements about the mother not being an American and said racist things, police said. \u201cWhen the mother answered her \u2026 Wolf tried to grab her 6-year-old son but he pulled away from her grasp, which caused a scratch on his finger. The mother began helping her son when Wolf grabbed her 3-year-old daughter and forced her underwater,\u201d police said in the news release. The mother pulled her daughter from the water but she \u201chad been yelling for help and was coughing up water,\u201d the police news release reads. In a release Monday, CAIR-Texas welcomed the decision to rearrest Wolf. \u201cThe affected family and the American Muslim community are temporarily relieved to know the alleged perpetrator is in custody again.

{"id": "2024_07_02_us_karen-read-mistrial-what-happens-next", "text": "The murder trial of Karen Read ended in a mistrial Monday after jurors couldn\u2019t reach a unanimous verdict, prolonging a case that\u2019s divided a Massachusetts community amid allegations of a sweeping cover-up by police and investigative misconduct. While not an acquittal, the outcome was a boon for Read, who is accused of drunkenly driving into her then-boyfriend, Boston police officer John O\u2019Keefe, and leaving him to die on a snowy night in January 2022 outside a home in Canton, Massachusetts. The 45-year-old had pleaded not guilty to charges of second-degree murder, vehicular manslaughter while intoxicated and leaving the scene of a collision, and she faced up to life in prison if convicted. But prosecutors with the Norfolk District Attorney\u2019s Office failed to convince the jury of six men and six women beyond a reasonable doubt. Over the last two days of the five-day deliberations, jurors repeatedly informed the judge they were hopelessly deadlocked, saying in a final note on Monday their perspectives were \u201cstarkly divided.\u201d Now, prosecutors must decide whether to rethink their approach. As they reconsider their case, they may decide to present evidence differently in hopes of securing a conviction, or avoid a second trial altogether and offer a plea deal, legal experts said. \u201cThey\u2019re going to make an assessment about basically what went wrong,\u201d trial attorney Misty Marris told CNN. \u201cYou go back, and you do the diagnostic: Where does the evidence fail to meet those standards from the jury\u2019s perspective?\u201d Here\u2019s what could happen next: Prosecutors intend to retry the case In a brief statement Monday, the office of Norfolk County District Attorney Michael Morrissey said it plans to retry the case, which alleged Read and O\u2019Keefe had gotten into an argument the night of January 28, 2022, before she struck him with her SUV and fled the scene. The couple had been out drinking at two bars with friends, then went to the home of O\u2019Keefe\u2019s colleague for an after-party, court documents show. O\u2019Keefe was found the next morning bruised and battered in the snow outside the home in Canton. Read and her attorneys had, in turn, presented another theory: Read dropped O\u2019Keefe off, then left \u2013 while O\u2019Keefe was injured in a fight with off-duty officers inside the home, mauled by the homeowners\u2019 dog, then tossed in the snow to die. The police then conspired to fabricate evidence and lie under oath to protect their own and frame Read, her defense alleged. Court documents say Read went looking the next morning for O\u2019Keefe in the snowstorm and found his body in the front yard of the Canton home. Prosecutors rejected that theory, presenting evidence the couple had a volatile relationship. Firefighters who responded the morning of January 29 to the site of O\u2019Keefe\u2019s body asked about his injuries and were told by Read, \u201cI hit him, I hit him,\u201d according to their testimony. Additionally, Read\u2019s vehicle had a broken taillight, and pieces of the taillight were found at the scene. Read\u2019s attorneys on Monday signaled they would not shy away from a retrial. \u201cNo matter how long it takes, no matter how long they keep trying, we will not stop fighting. We have no quit,\u201d\u00a0Alan Jackson, one of Karen Read\u2019s attorneys, said in video provided by CNN affiliate WCVB outside the courthouse. Prosecutors could rethink the case \u2026 Prosecutors\u2019 decision to quickly signal their intent to retry the case wasn\u2019t unexpected, said Rosanna Cavallaro, a professor of law at Suffolk University in Boston. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to be seen as thinking that they failed, or that they have nothing but a very strong case,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the reality is, of course, that what a mistrial means is that the jury could not agree, and they were not persuaded.\u201d But ahead of a status conference on July 22, prosecutors will be engaged in a post mortem of the case, said Daniel Medwed, a law professor at Northeastern University, and they will be asking themselves a series of questions. \u201cWhat worked, what didn\u2019t work? If they were to proceed again,\u201d he said, \u201cwould they choose the same charges? \u2026 Would they change their strategy in some ways? Where are places that they need to shore up their case, maybe through additional investigation?\u201d Perhaps, Medwed said, prosecutors will look back and feel they overreached charging Read with murder, which requires intent, and instead focus on the other charge. \u201cThey might just consider dropping the murder charge and going with manslaughter,\u201d he said. Indeed, Cavallaro said the indictment against Read and the charges stemming from it would not change. But prosecutors could offer another narrative that would make it easier for a second jury to convict Read on a lesser type of homicide than second-degree murder like manslaughter or reckless manslaughter. The stories heard by the jury were \u201cbinary\u201d and \u201cpolarized,\u201d she said: In prosecutors\u2019 telling, Read intended to kill O\u2019Keefe, while the defense argued she was innocent and framed. \u201cIt\u2019s possible the second time around, the government says, \u2018Maybe we need to give the jury this intermediate possibility that she didn\u2019t mean to kill him,\u2019\u201d Cavallaro said, in addition to alleging Read intended to murder O\u2019Keefe. \u201cIt captures the idea that a reasonable person would have been more careful, and because of your lack of care, your recklessness, a death occurred that you\u2019re responsible for,\u201d she added. \u201cThat behavior is punishable as a homicide, but not as a murder,\u201d she said. \u2026 or offer a plea deal Former Massachusetts Attorney General Martha Coakley indicated in an interview with WCVB that prosecutors could drop the most serious charge of second-degree murder, adding, \u201cThey can also seek to plea bargain, which is something that I\u2019m guessing they will at least talk about.\u201d \u201cIf I were defense counsel, you owe it to your client to talk and the prosecution could talk about whether they could reduce charges and reach some plea agreement,\u201d Coakley said. In jurors\u2019 final note to the judge before she declared a mistrial, they said \u201csome members\u201d believed the prosecutors had met the burden of proof, proving the charges beyond a reasonable doubt. But \u201cothers\u201d felt the evidence failed to meet that standard. Jurors\u2019 language signaled it was not a single holdout but multiple jurors who were unconvinced, Cavallaro said, which the defense would take as a win. \u201cGiven that,\u201d she asked, \u201cis there any temptation for (Read) to plead?\u201d Medwed echoed that idea, pointing out that Read\u2019s defense focused on her proclaimed innocence in O\u2019Keefe\u2019s death. He would be surprised if she was interested in pleading guilty to anything that would include admitting she caused O\u2019Keefe\u2019s death. State trooper\u2019s testimony appears to be key A key decision could be whether to present testimony from a lead investigator who had to apologize on the stand for sexist and offensive texts he sent about Read in a private group chat, according to WCVB. Massachusetts State Police Trooper Michael Proctor called her a \u201cwhack job,\u201d mocked her medical issues and told coworkers he found \u201cno nudes\u201d while searching her phone for evidence, the station reported. Proctor was relieved of duty Monday following the mistrial, state police Col. John Mawn said in a news release. \u201cThis follows our previous decision to open an internal affairs investigation after information about serious misconduct emerged in testimony at the trial,\u201d Mawn said, adding the investigation is ongoing. CNN has sought comment from the State Police Association of Massachusetts. An attorney for Proctor previously said he was cooperating with the internal inquiry and said his personal messages did not undermine the investigation into O\u2019Keefe\u2019s death. There\u2019s no evidence Proctor tampered with any evidence, Julie Grant, a Court TV anchor and a former federal prosecutor, told CNN\u2019s Sara Sidner Tuesday. But his behavior and comments were \u201cunprofessional.\u201d \u201cThe Massachusetts State Police \u2013 you have to wonder if they felt as if he had any role in this hung jury,\u201d she said. Still, experts who spoke to CNN saw Proctor\u2019s testimony as key to the commonwealth\u2019s case, which might force prosecutors to call on him despite the apparent baggage. \u201cHe\u2019s the lead investigator, which means that his performance, his work, his efforts are inherently relevant to the case,\u201d Medwed said, adding the defense would likely call the trooper to impeach the investigation even if prosecutors didn\u2019t. \u201cI just don\u2019t see how the government can avoid him as much as they\u2019d like to,\u201d Medwed said.

And the PTSD from the Camp Fire kicked in instantly, especially with how big the cloud of smoke was,\u201d Penick said. The Camp Fire was the\u00a0deadliest wildfire in California\u2019s history. Before the Maui fires, it was the deadliest wildfire in the US in more than a century as well, according to the\u00a0National Fire Protection Association. On Tuesday around 2:30 p.m. PT, Penick packed up her things in Oroville with her 5-year-old son, her fianc\u00e9 and her fianc\u00e9\u2019s two kids. The family is among the thousands of residents evacuated as the Thompson Fire continues to burn in Butte County, just about 20 miles south of Paradise. \u201cBy then, you could just see the cloud of smoke right there behind my house. And it started to get orange,\u201d\u00a0Penick said.\u00a0\u201cWe gathered as much stuff as we could. Our three dogs, our dog crates, all the dog food, my kids\u2019 favorite toys, all their diapers and wipes, their favorite bedding, their chairs.\u201d After the Camp Fire, Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E) reached an\u00a0$11 billion settlement with insurance companies and admitted it\u00a0was\u00a0\u201cprobable\u201d that its equipment started the 2018 Camp Fire. Penick is one of the people who received settlement money. She\u00a0has received one payment so far, and she used it to pay for her car and the rent on her Oroville house in advance,\u00a0she told CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s scary. It\u2019s sad. I\u2019ve worked hard to try and find this house. And the fact that the Camp Fire is the only way that I got this house with that settlement, and for it to just be gone again would just be devastating to me,\u201d she said. Penick also just found out she\u2019s pregnant, just like she was when she had to flee the Camp Fire in 2018. \u201cI was almost seven and a half months pregnant with my son Andrew. And he\u2019s five now,\u201d\u00a0she recalled.\u00a0\u201cAnd there was five of us, two dogs and a cat \u2026 and not one of us had a car. And so we were walking, and we walked for almost a mile.

{"id": "2024_07_03_us_replica-handgun-utica-police-shooting", "text": "Before an officer fatally shot Nyah Mway last week as he ran from law enforcement in upstate New York, the 13-year-old had pulled out what police said appeared to be a handgun. But it wasn\u2019t a real gun, authorities later discovered, they\u2019ve said \u2013 only one capable of firing pellets. Still, the firearm \u2013 which is entirely black, photos released by the Utica Police Department show \u2013 carried the same \u201cGlock markings, signatures, detachable magazine and serial numbers\u201d as a Glock 17 Gen 5 handgun, Utica Police spokesperson Lt. Michael Curley told The Associated Press. \u201cThis weapon in every facet resembles a real GLOCK handgun, in functionality, appearance, and design,\u201d he told CNN, adding it\u00a0\u201cfires .177 pellets.\u201d Nyah Mway apparently pointed the handgun at three officers while he ran away from them after dark, body camera footage released by Utica Police shows. The officers yelled \u201cgun,\u201d and one officer tackled and punched the teenager. As they wrestled on the ground, another officer fired a single shot, the video shows. The teen was taken to a local hospital where he died, police said. Imitation guns have led to unintended fatal consequences over the years, posing challenges for law enforcement who interpret them as real in a nation with more guns than people. Here\u2019s what we know about such items and some other cases: What imitation firearms are \u2013 and aren\u2019t Toy, look-alike and imitation firearms are devices that \u201chave the appearance, shape, and/or configuration of a firearm,\u201d according to the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the agency that enforces federal rules governing them. The term \u201clook-alike firearm\u201d includes:\u2022 Toy guns\u2022 Water guns\u2022 Replica nonguns\u2022 Airsoft guns firing nonmetallic projectiles Some other guns that don\u2019t fire live bullets, however, are not considered \u201clook-alike firearms.\u201d The term does not include:\u2022 Non-firing collector replica antique firearms\u2022 Traditional BB, paintball or pellet-firing air guns\u2022 Decorative, ornamental and miniature objects that have the appearance of a firearm and measure no more than 38 mm by 70 mm (excluding any gun stock length) In Utica,\u00a0police initially said Nyah Mway was holding\u00a0\u201ca replica GLOCK pellet gun.\u201d It appears a firearm with that description would not be considered a look-alike under the federal rule \u2013\u00a0although at night, it may have been virtually impossible for a police officer to know that. What regulations require of look-alikes While federal law does not govern the transfer, use or possession of imitation guns, according to the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, the way such items look when they\u2019re \u201cmanufactured and entered into commerce\u201d is regulated \u2013 to a degree \u2013 by the Consumer Product Safety Commission. Every look-alike firearm \u2013 that is: toy guns, water guns, replica nonguns and airsoft guns that fire nonmetallic projectiles \u2013 must either:\u2022 have a permanently affixed blaze orange plug inserted in the firearm\u2019s barrel\u2022 have a similar marking on the exterior of the barrel\u2022 be constructed entirely of transparent or translucent materials\u2022 or be covered in certain bright colors The rules \u2013 in place since 1989 \u2013 don\u2019t apply to non-firing replicas; BB, paintball or pellet guns; or decorative or mini firearms. They also do not cover \u201chow consumers use or enjoy their products,\u201d according to the commission. Under those rules, it appears the Consumer Product Safety Commission would not require the gun Nyah Mway was carrying to bear \u201clook-alike firearm\u201d markings, such as an orange plug or transparent or bright coverings, either because of its pellet projectiles or as a replica. Being able to buy a look-alike or imitation gun also can depend on the law. For example, while Amazon sells a variety of imitation firearms, the online marketplace won\u2019t ship airsoft guns, non-powdered weapons like BB guns, pellet guns, paintball guns and air rifles or toy guns to places with sales restrictions, its policy states. Amazon, Walmart and three other retailers announced a deal in 2015 with the then-attorney general of New York \u2013 where Nyah Mway was fatally shot \u2013 to stop selling realistic toy guns there. And Pennsylvania, Florida, Delaware and other states impose age restrictions on the possession, use or transfer of some non-powder guns, according to the Giffords Law Center. \u2018No one could reasonably tell the difference\u2019 Police across the United States shot 305 people brandishing non-powder and toy firearms between 2015 and 2023, according to a Giffords Law Center analysis of the Washington Post\u2019s Fatal Force database, which tracks fatal shootings of civilians by police. While police in Utica initially said Nyah Mway was holding\u00a0\u201ca replica GLOCK pellet gun,\u201d they later clarified the term \u201creplica\u201d was used to describe its physical condition because of its resemblance to a Glock handgun, the department told CNN on Tuesday. \u201cIn the future we will ensure that we utilize proper terminology so that there is no mistake in what we are trying to portray,\u201d Curley said. Imitation handguns in the hands of anyone \u2013 especially juveniles \u2013 pose many challenges for police departments across the country, Curley added. \u201cAs we see in this tragic incident, split second decisions have to be made when individuals are in possession of realistic looking weapons that are indistinguishable\u00a0from their real counterparts,\u201d he said. \u201cNo one could reasonably tell the difference between the two, much less in high stress situations where the item is being displayed.\u201d Imitation guns have led to other fatalities In New York \u2013 where Nyah Mway was shot and killed \u2013 at least 63 shootings, eight of them fatal, unfolded as a result of people mistaking imitation weapons for real ones, according to 2015 data from the state Office of the Attorney General. Beyond that, hundreds of crimes have been committed in New York City with imitation weapons, the office said. No new data was available on the issue, it told CNN this week. Just last month, a teenager with an airsoft gun was fatally shot by an armed man who \u201ctook it upon himself\u201d to conduct surveillance outside a sporting goods store in Washington state, according to court documents. The armed man \u201cassumed\u201d the teen and two others were about to commit a violent robbery, the prosecutor wrote. The man has been charged with murder. His attorneys say he was acting in self-defense, protecting himself and others. Several years before that, Antonio Arce, 14, was fatally shot by police in Tempe, Arizona, while holding what later was determined to be a replica 1911 airsoft gun he\u2019d just stolen from a truck reported to police as suspicious. The officer who fired was not criminally charged in Arce\u2019s death. And in 2014, Tamir Rice, 12, was shot and killed outside an Ohio recreation center when an officer opened fire after authorities mistook a black, toy airsoft pistol Tamir had for a real firearm. The US Justice Department in 2020 found insufficient evidence to support federal criminal charges against the former officer who fired his weapon at Rice.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/03/us/replica-handgun-utica-police-shooting/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/05/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_07_01_us_karen-read-murder-trial-deliberations", "text": "A judge declared a mistrial in the murder trial of Karen Read, the Massachusetts woman accused of drunkenly driving into her police officer boyfriend and leaving him to die in January 2022, in a case featuring accusations of a vast police cover-up and investigative misconduct. And the state trooper who helped lead the investigation \u2013 a man who admitted on the stand that he\u2019d sent sexist and offensive text messages about the defendant to friends \u2013 was relieved of duty Monday after the mistrial was declared, the Massachusetts State Police said. The mistrial was declared after the jury twice told the judge Monday that it could not reach a verdict after spending days deliberating Read\u2019s fate. Jurors also said Friday they could not reach a unanimous decision. Read, 45, pleaded not guilty to charges of second-degree murder, vehicular manslaughter while intoxicated, as well as leaving the scene of an accident resulting in death in connection to the 2022 death of John O\u2019Keefe, who was her boyfriend and a Boston police officer. \u201cWe thank the O\u2019Keefe family for their commitment and dedication to this long process,\u201d said Morrisey after the mistrial was announced. \u201cThey maintained sight of the true core of this case \u2013 to find justice for John O\u2019Keefe.\u201d The commonwealth intends to retry the case with a new jury following the mistrial, according to Norfolk District Attorney Michael Morrissey. Read could face life in prison if convicted, according to Massachusetts law. Read\u2019s attorney Alan Jackson, meanwhile, said prosecutors in the case had \u201cfailed miserably and they\u2019ll continue to fail,\u201d according to video outside the courthouse provided by CNN affiliate WCVB. \u201cNo matter how long it takes, no matter how long they keep trying, we will not stop fighting,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cFolks, this is what it looks like when you bring false charges against an innocent person.\u201d The Massachusetts judge overseeing the trial gave jurors a so-called \u201cdynamite charge\u201d Monday morning, directing them to continue their deliberations after they indicated for a second time Monday they could not reach a unanimous verdict. The Tuey-Rodriguez charge instructs jurors to reconsider their positions while taking into consideration the opinions of panelists with whom they do not agree. Norfolk County Superior Court Judge Beverly Cannone read the charge around 11 a.m. after jurors sent a note saying, \u201cDespite our commitment to the duty entrusted to us, we find ourselves deeply divided by fundamental differences in our opinions and state of mind.\u201d Jurors had resumed deliberations Monday morning at the judge\u2019s direction, after first saying on Friday they could not reach a unanimous decision. Cannone on Friday asked the jury to continue to deliberate, but decided against reading the Tuey-Rodriguez charge, which case law cautions against providing prematurely. The jury of six men and six women had been considering a verdict since midday June 25, weighing the evidence in a case featuring accusations of a vast police cover-up as well as improper conduct and sexist text messages from a lead investigator. On both Friday and Monday, Norfolk County Assistant District Attorney Adam Lally argued against the judge issuing the Tuey charge, saying the jury had not yet deliberated enough, citing in part the complexity of the case and the high volume of evidence and witness testimony. Defense attorney David Yannetti, meanwhile, urged the judge to issue the charge, saying Monday jurors had now twice indicated they are \u201chopelessly deadlocked.\u201d On Monday, Cannone sided with the defense, telling the court she\u2019d determined the jury had conducted the requisite \u201cdue and thorough deliberation.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve never seen a note like this, with reporting to be at an impasse,\u201d the judge said. If prosecutors seek another trial, they could take a different approach, perhaps bringing a lesser charge than second-degree murder if prosecutors determine their evidence failed to meet the standard required or using different experts or different testimony, trial attorney Misty Marris said. \u201cIt\u2019s a chance to identify what the mistakes or holes in the case might have been,\u201d Marris said. \u201cAnd it does give the defense that advantage, because they know now, especially when you\u2019re able to speak to the jurors after the fact, you learn a lot. You learn a lot about what motivated them.\u201d How the trial went The heart of the trial stemmed from what happened on one wintry evening in Canton, Massachusetts, more than two years ago. On the night of January 28, 2022, Read and O\u2019Keefe went out drinking at two bars with friends. Shortly after midnight, the couple climbed into Read\u2019s SUV and drove to the Canton home of one of O\u2019Keefe\u2019s fellow Boston police officers for an after-party, court documents show. In the morning, O\u2019Keefe\u2019s body was found bruised and battered in the snow outside the home, authorities said. Prosecutors have alleged Read and O\u2019Keefe, who had an at-times tumultuous relationship, got into an argument that night, and that she drunkenly backed into him with a vehicle and fled the scene, leaving him to die in the cold. \u201cWhat the constellation of the facts and the evidence ineluctably demonstrate here is that the defendant drove her vehicle in reverse at 24.2 miles per hour for 62.5 feet, struck Mr. O\u2019Keefe, causing those catastrophic head injuries, leaving him incapacitated and freezing him to death,\u201d prosecutor Lally said in closing arguments Tuesday. In contrast, Read\u2019s defense has accused off-duty police inside the Canton home of fatally beating O\u2019Keefe, dumping his body on the lawn and then conspiring through fabricated evidence and false testimony to frame Read. \u201cLadies and gentlemen, there was a cover-up in this case, plain and simple,\u201d defense attorney Jackson said. \u201cYou\u2019ll surely say to yourself, \u2018I don\u2019t want to believe it, I don\u2019t want to believe that could happen in our community,\u2019 but sadly over these past eight weeks you\u2019ve seen it right before your eyes.\u201d The closing arguments represented the end of a murder trial that has garnered interest both local and widespread, including accusations of witness tampering, a federal probe into the investigation, and groups of pink-wearing supporters chanting to \u201cFree Karen Read.\u201d Lead investigator is relieved of duty after mistrial The prosecution\u2019s case has also been hampered by a series of missteps and unusual investigative practices. Most notably, a lead investigator in the case, Massachusetts State Police Trooper Michael Proctor, admitted he sent a series of sexist and offensive texts about Read in a private group chat, calling her a \u201cwhack job,\u201d mocking her medical issues and commenting to coworkers he had found \u201cno nudes\u201d while searching her phone for evidence, WCVB reported. Proctor was relieved of duty Monday after the state police learned of the mistrial, state police Col. John Mawn said in an online post Monday evening. \u201cThis follows our previous decision to open an internal affairs investigation after information about serious misconduct emerged in testimony at the trial.\u00a0This investigation is ongoing,\u201d Mawn\u2019s post reads. CNN has sought comment from the State Police Association of Massachusetts. Proctor apologized for the \u201cunprofessional\u201d comments on the stand, but the vulgar texts were sharply criticized in and out of court, including from the governor. \u201cIt\u2019s completely unprofessional,\u201d Gov. Maura Healey told WCVB of the texts. \u201cIt does harm, frankly, to the dignity and the integrity of the work of men and women across the state police and law enforcement. So as a former attorney general and as governor, I am disgusted by that.\u201d CNN\u2019s Artemis Moshtaghian, Jennifer Henderson and Zoe Sottile contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/01/us/karen-read-murder-trial-deliberations/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/05/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_07_04_economy_us-jobs-report-june-preview", "text": "The US labor market has held its own despite swirling forces \u2014 high inflation, an aggressive interest-rate-hiking campaign, pandemic aftershocks and geopolitical uncertainty \u2014 that seemed all but certain to trigger a recession. Monthly job gains have frequently come in stronger than expected, and unemployment has held at or below 4% for 30 consecutive months. That said, the job market of today is far different than it was 30 months ago. \u201cThe labor market has normalized,\u201d Luke Tilley, Wilmington Trust\u2019s chief economist, told CNN in an interview. But, he cautioned, \u201cthe concern would be if it worsened from here.\u201d Economists don\u2019t believe job gains will fall off a cliff when the Bureau of Labor Statistics releases employment data for June on Friday morning. In fact, the monthly payroll gains should remain strong and steady, but gradually cooling: Economists expect the US added 190,000 jobs last month, a pullback from the stronger-than-expected 272,000 gain in May, and for unemployment to hold steady at 4%, according to FactSet consensus estimates. Still, there\u2019s a growing chorus of data that shows the economy is slowing, consumer spending is letting up and workers are feeling less secure. As such, Friday\u2019s report could provide a crucial signal as to whether the jobs market is at a stable or even pre-pandemic state \u2014 or is perhaps weaker than advertised. \u201cI think as long as the job gains continue to show a gradual cooling, this economy is in good shape,\u201d said Nela Richardson, ADP\u2019s chief economist, during a call with reporters on Wednesday following the payroll processor\u2019s latest report showing job and wage gains slowed in the private sector. ADP estimated that private employers added 150,000 jobs last month, down from 157,000 in May. \u201cIf we see the cooldown go from gradual to steep, I think that\u2019s a warning,\u201d she said. Whether the two surveys will still tell different tales In May, the two surveys that feed into the monthly jobs report appeared to be telling different stories: The business survey showed employers adding jobs at a still-robust pace, and the household survey showed a 408,000 drop in employment. While the establishment survey is considered the \u201cgold standard\u201d by economists, the household survey, which provides greater detail on demographics and feeds into the unemployment rate, is viewed as more volatile because of its smaller sample size and declining response rates. \u201cThe establishment and household surveys are continuing to show diametrically opposed pictures of the labor market,\u201d Dean Baker, economist and co-founder of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, wrote in a note issued earlier this week. \u201cThe persistence of this large divergence is disconcerting,\u201d he added. \u201cMost other data seem to fit better with the establishment survey, although we are seeing evidence of a weakening labor market.\u201d Notably, there are fewer job openings, hiring has pulled back, people aren\u2019t as willing to test the waters and are staying put in their current jobs; and, perhaps most importantly, layoff activity has been climbing steadily higher in recent weeks. Are permanent job losers on the rise? Last week, there were an estimated 238,000 first-time claims filed for unemployment benefits, an increase of 4,000 from the week before, according to Department of Labor data released Wednesday. The latest uptick brought the four-week average of initial claims to its highest level since August 2023. Also, Americans are staying unemployed for longer: Continuing claims, which are filed by people who have received benefits for at least a week or more, rose to their highest level since November 2021. The continued upswing in claims has Tilley closely watching an underlying datapoint of the monthly jobs report: Unemployed persons by reason for unemployment. \u201cOn a three-month average basis, it\u2019s up about 200,000 people from last year,\u201d Tilley said. \u201cAnd that metric of permanent job losers, year-over-year, is almost never positive in an expansion. It was never positive between 2010 and 2019; it was not positive in between the tech crash recession of 2001 and then 2008.\u201d He added: \u201cSo when you sort of peel back the onion from what looks like very strong job growth in a raw number count and look at it a little closer \u2026 that paints a labor market that has normalized and is at risk of slipping.\u201d Still, other measures of layoff activity haven\u2019t shown a worrisome spike. US-based employers announced fewer job cuts last month than they did in May; however, those layoff reports are trending well above last year\u2019s, according to data released Wednesday by Challenger, Gray & Christmas. The outplacement and workplace research firm counted 48,786 cuts announced in June. That\u2019s down nearly 24% from the 63,618 cuts announced in May, but 19.8% higher than the 40,709 cuts announced in June last year. How immigrants contribute to the labor market Since August 2022, monthly payroll gains have averaged 250,000 per month, which is much faster than the 2019 average of 164,000, noted Julia Pollak, chief economist at ZipRecruiter. \u201cIn other words, we\u2019re achieving much higher job growth with about the same unemployment rate, at a time when the native-born population is stagnant,\u201d Pollak told CNN via email. \u201cOne key reason is\u00a0immigration\u00a0and its effect on labor supply.\u201d Immigrants accounted for 43% of the labor force gain in 2024, Rachel Sederberg, senior economist at labor market research firm Lightcast, told CNN Business. In May, that share skyrocketed to 280%, as the immigrant gains more than made up for the native-born workers who left the labor force, she said. The job gains made by immigrants have become another flashpoint in an already heavily contentious presidential election. During the CNN debate last week between President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump, the latter falsely claimed that all job gains since Biden took office were made by illegal immigrants and \u201cbounce-back jobs.\u201d \u201cMost research does not find that\u00a0immigration\u00a0harms employment outcomes for native-born Americans because immigrants are both consumers and producers of goods and services, so they may increase job competition in some areas but they also increase demand for goods and services, which creates jobs,\u201d Pollak noted. Other indicators to watch Average hourly earnings: Workers\u2019 pay gains have been slowing, and that\u2019s expected to continue in June. Economists expect that the month-on-month gains should come in around 0.3%, from 0.4% in May, and for annual gains to cool to 3.9% from 4.1%. This is an indicator that Federal Reserve officials have watched closely as a potential inflationary pressure. Fed Chair Jerome Powell on Tuesday said the labor market has seen a \u201cpretty substantial move\u201d toward getting back into a better balance. While speaking at the ECB\u2019s annual conference in Portugal, Powell noted the unemployment rate was moving up toward \u201ca more sustainable level,\u201d as were wage increases. \u201cWage increases are still a bit above where they would wind up in equilibrium; but nonetheless, you can see the labor market is cooling off appropriately,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re watching it very carefully, but it doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s heating up or presenting a big problem for inflation.\u201d Labor force participation rates: While prime working-age women have experienced record-high employment in recent months, other measures of labor force participation continue to remain below pre-pandemic levels. The overall labor force participation rate dipped in May to 62.5% from 62.7%, reversing progress made earlier this year. Part-time workers: New data from employment site Indeed indicated that employers are looking to hire more part-time workers. The number of involuntary part-time workers has increased in recent months. \u201cThey\u2019d like full-time hours but can\u2019t get them, which is potentially an indicator of a softening labor market,\u201d according to Lightcast\u2019s Sederberg. \u201cThat said, the number of people who are involuntarily part time are still very, very low.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/04/economy/us-jobs-report-june-preview/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/05/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_07_03_us_parades-independence-day-july-4-ijdgi-cec", "text": "I\u2019ve always questioned Ferris Bueller\u2019s judgment. Not because he skipped school, deceived his parents, and broke countless laws while playing hooky. I question him because he had such a good time at that damn parade. Before the first note of \u201cTwist and Shout\u201d even played, I wondered why he would bother hijacking a parade float to lip synch a few songs. By the time the scene was over, the movie had nearly lost me completely. Admittedly, \u201cFerris Bueller\u2019s Day Off\u201d is, well, a movie. But there was one nitpick I could not look past: no one has EVER had that much fun at a parade. If it sounds like I\u2019m being a party pooper, it\u2019s because I am: I just don\u2019t understand parades. I don\u2019t get why people bother organizing them. I don\u2019t get why you\u2019d want to march in one. And I certainly don\u2019t get why anyone would want to attend one. To be fair, there is a rich history of parades in America. When the Allies won World War II, there was a ticker tape parade down New York City streets to commemorate victory. The Macy\u2019s Thanksgiving Day Parade is an annual holiday tradition and appointment TV viewing for many families. When a pro sports team wins a championship, thousands of fans turn out to revel in the glory. All that cheering and smiling and flag-waving suggests fun is being had. I\u2019m just not buying that it actually is. Think about all you must do if you want to go see one of these things in person. You need to schlep your things downtown so you can stake out a spot, sometimes many hours before the parade even starts. You may end up walking miles down the route for a good view, so you\u2019ve already made a parade of it by the time you get there. Then if you have kids, you need to make sure they can see by either shoving people out of the way to get to the front or putting them on your shoulders. (The people standing behind you definitely love their newly obstructed view.) When the parade actually starts, you may wait for over an hour for the action to arrive at your spot. And then, when it finally does, you see the float or the marching band for a few minutes \u2014 or maybe even just seconds \u2014 and then they just \u2026 keep walking. Talk about a letdown. For those marching in the parade, it can mean hours of walking on hot concrete while wearing uncomfortable uniforms or costumes. Then there\u2019s the inconvenience it causes for everyone else in town who are just trying to go about their day \u2014 they have to navigate blocked roads, detours and general overcrowding. Security \u2014 and crowds \u2014 can be tight along the parade route. For the claustrophobic among us, standing shoulder to shoulder with a bunch of strangers with limited exit opportunities isn\u2019t exactly a festive feeling. But as I mentioned, parades do have a place in this country\u2019s history \u2014 and I think that\u2019s part of the problem. We continue to do them because we\u2019ve always done them, and it plays into our nostalgia for a simpler time. Today\u2019s times are anything but simple though, and I think we can come together and celebrate in a way that doesn\u2019t amount to standing along the side of the road. According to historians, one of the first documented \u201cparades\u201d held after the US Constitution was ratified in 1788 was more akin to a communal meal than a processional. We could try that. What\u2019s more American than a cookout? Or how about a concert? Some of the same\u00a0gripes may exist, but at least the music lasts more than five minutes. Now, I can be realistic about this. I don\u2019t think parades are going away any time soon. I just want people to stop pretending they actually enjoy them as much as they seem to.

{"id": "2024_07_04_politics_trump-campaign-plans-biden-debate", "text": "For much of the past year, Donald Trump\u00a0and his allies have speculated\u00a0that Joe Biden would not end up as the Democratic presidential nominee \u2013 suggesting without evidence that he would step down before the convention and be replaced by another candidate. Now, with Biden facing an increasingly uncertain political future amid the fallout from his shaky debate performance, Republicans are trying to determine\u00a0what the Democratic incumbent stepping aside would actually mean\u00a0for the Trump campaign. And some believe the path back to the White House would likely be easier\u00a0with Biden at the top of the ticket. Trump and his allies have relished the extended spotlight on\u00a0Biden this week, with the former president making the rare decision to lay low at his New Jersey club and allow Biden to be the story. Trump has no public events on his schedule, and his campaign surprised some aides and advisers by telling\u00a0them to enjoy the Fourth of July holiday. \u201cChaos is our friend,\u201d a person close to Trump said. Meanwhile, campaign advisers and key allies have been calling reporters and friendly Democrats, hunting for any clues into what might happen next should Biden ultimately walk\u00a0away from his reelection bid. Until now, the campaign and its allies have largely ignored\u00a0Vice President Kamala Harris in waging their attacks against the Biden administration. But there are signs that posture is changing. On Wednesday, a\u00a0super PAC aligned with Trump, MAGA, Inc.,\u00a0launched its opening salvo against Harris by attacking her oversight of Biden\u2019s border policies in\u00a0an email. It asked\u00a0if Harris is \u201cThe Best They Got?\u201d Trump\u2019s campaign insists that nothing will change in its calculations, whether Biden is at the top of the Democratic ticket or not. \u201cPresident Trump will beat any Democrat on November 5th because he has a proven record and an agenda to Make America Great Again,\u201d\u00a0co-campaign managers Chris LaCivita\u00a0and Susie Wiles said in a statement. Even if Biden is not the Democratic nominee, the Trump campaign believes the issues likely to decide the election will remain the same. \u201cThe issues are the issues, and that\u2019s what people care about,\u201d one adviser told CNN. However, the reality may not be so clear-cut. Polling has shown\u00a0a lack of enthusiasm around both the major\u00a0parties\u2019 presumptive nominees for president, and it\u2019s\u00a0unknown how a change could alter Democratic turnout or affect the opinions of swing voters. And while Democrats face a time crunch to make a decision\u00a0before their August convention, so\u00a0do Republicans, who have spent months building out a carefully crafted\u00a0data operation, attack ads and general campaign infrastructure focused specifically on beating Biden. As one Republican pollster put it, Trump would\u00a0\u201crather go with the devil he knows than the devil he doesn\u2019t know.\u201d Behind the scenes, the Republican National Committee already had \u201crolling books\u201d of opposition research on prominent Democrats who could succeed Biden in 2028, Trump advisers told CNN, including Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro\u00a0and California Gov. Gavin Newsom, among others. The books \u201care constantly being updated, because, you know, they\u2019re\u00a0perpetual candidates, and they\u2019re\u00a0always running for something,\u201d one senior Trump adviser told CNN. Still, two\u00a0advisers\u00a0to Trump said they would not be changing strategy or shifting research and plans until the situation with Biden had played out. \u201cWe just don\u2019t know what this looks like at the\u00a0end of all of it,\u201d one of the advisers said. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to change anything until we know.\u201d Some Republicans had publicly floated, if not anticipated,\u00a0a Biden exit from the race as the president\u2019s physical decline became increasingly apparent. During the GOP presidential primaries, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley made it a focal point of their campaigns, arguing that Democrats would replace Biden and Republicans couldn\u2019t\u00a0risk putting Trump up against a more youthful and energetic challenger. Trump himself had broached the prospect, saying repeatedly that he didn\u2019t\u00a0think Biden \u201cmakes it.\u201d\u00a0In an interview nearly a\u00a0year ago, Trump and conservative commentator Tucker Carlson opined on what would happen if Biden left the race. After Carlson suggested Harris would replace Biden on the Democratic ticket, Trump predicted: \u201cNot really. I mean, I guess they\u2019d\u00a0have maybe a free-for-all. A lot of people say she has to remain for certain reasons. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s true actually.\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I don\u2019t\u00a0think other people would stand for it.\u201d But in the aftermath of the debate, Trump\u2019s team did not anticipate\u00a0such lasting\u00a0Democratic panic surrounding the viability of Biden to continue as the party\u2019s presidential nominee.\u00a0One Trump adviser told CNN the Democratic handwringing had been expected to blow over within a week. Now, Trump\u2019s team is scrambling to prepare for any outcome, including whether it may need to mount a new campaign focused on a different opponent. \u201cEvery Democrat who is calling on Crooked Joe Biden to quit was once a supporter of Biden and his failed policies that lead to extreme inflation, an open border, and chaos at home and abroad,\u201d LaCivita\u00a0and Wiles said in their statement. \u201cMake no mistake that Democrats, the main stream\u00a0media, and the swamp colluded to hide the truth from the American public.\u201d Republicans are now plotting how to hit Harris, with early discussions focused on her past statements defending Biden\u2019s fitness to serve. \u201cShe going to constantly be forced to answer a very simple question: Why were you hiding Joe Biden\u2019s lack of mental acuity from the American people?\u201d a person close to Trump said. Most people close to Trump continue to believe that a change is unlikely, citing the relative\u00a0low name recognition of the prospective Biden replacements and the legal challenges of moving the president\u2019s campaign war chest to a new candidate. Biden, too, continues to insist he isn\u2019t\u00a0going anywhere.\u00a0In a defiant campaign call Wednesday, he told staff, \u201cNo one is pushing me out\u201d and vowed to stay in the race. \u201cI\u2019m not leaving,\u201d he said, sources familiar with the call told CNN. Efforts to keep Biden on the ballot may come from the right as well. The Heritage Foundation, a Trump-aligned conservative organization, has been readying for this moment since the spring and recently revealed a playbook to challenge attempts by Democrats to remove Biden from the ballot in certain states with statutory deadlines for naming nominees. In a memo released last month somewhat presciently\u00a0titled \u201cCan they replace Biden if he freezes at debate,\u201d the organization singled out three swing states \u2013 Georgia, Nevada\u00a0and Wisconsin \u2013 where Republicans could file lawsuits to challenge efforts by Democrats to change course. Mike Howell, executive director of Heritage\u2019s election oversight project, acknowledged that any winning case would heavily depend on the circumstances of a Biden departure. \u201cThe timing is so key,\u201d Howell said. Rick Hasen, an election law expert at UCLA, rejected the idea that Democrats would have any legal trouble putting forward a new name before Biden is even officially nominated. \u201cI don\u2019t put any credence into it,\u201d Hasen wrote on his website. \u201cJoe Biden is not the party\u2019s nominee now, and states generally point to the major party\u2019s nominee as the one whose name is on the ballot.\u201d CNN\u2019s Betsy Klein and Kate Sullivan contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/04/politics/trump-campaign-plans-biden-debate/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/05/2024", "section": "us"}}

The advisory was issued Wednesday by the District of Columbia Water and Sewer Authority\u00a0and Arlington County due to an increase in algae blooms in the Potomac River, as the nation\u2019s capital prepared for its annual Fourth of July celebrations. Affected areas included Washington, DC, Arlington County, the Pentagon, Arlington National Cemetery and Reagan National Airport.

The warnings were lifted as the area readied for an influx of visitors for the Fourth of July, including the annual fireworks display on the National Mall. The Army Corps of Engineers said the advisory was prompted by elevated cloudiness in the water supply caused by increases in algae blooms in the Potomac River. \u201cUpon observing the increase in algae and resulting turbidity today, Washington Aqueduct staff implemented additional mechanical and chemical treatment solutions to help meet system water supply demands and (Environmental Protection Agency) standards,\u201d the Army Corps said in a statement. Turbidity is a measure of cloudiness in water the EPA says can be used to assess water quality and filtration effectiveness to indicate whether disease-causing organisms could be present. Turbidity can indicate the presence of organisms including bacteria, viruses and parasites that can cause nausea, cramps, diarrhea and headaches. Infants, young children, older adults and people with compromised immune systems may be at greater risk, DC Water said. Atlanta was under a state of emergency last month, after disruptions to its water service left a large swath of the city under boil-water advisories. Some summer school programs and hospital operations in the area were paused as a result.

{"id": "2024_07_04_politics_paul-whelan-holiday-russian-detention", "text": "Paul Whelan on Thursday called for President Joe Biden to handle his case as \u201che would do if his own son were being held hostage\u201d as he marked another holiday in Russian detention. \u201cI would hope that the president truly makes my case truly a top priority and leverages the resources available to him as he would do if his own son were being held hostage,\u201d he said in a phone call to CNN on Thursday. \u201cAs the United States celebrates another year of independence, America should not forget that several of its citizens are being held hostage around the world by rogue regimes intent on exacting some form of ransom from the US government. These wrongful detentions undermine our concepts of rights and freedoms. They should not be tolerated, tacitly nor otherwise,\u201d Whelan said. \u201cMy detention at the hands of the Russian government over more than five and a half years, for a charge of espionage that never occurred, subjects me to slave labor six days a week, and living conditions that defy human rights.\u201d Whelan, who has been declared as wrongfully detained by the US State Department, was arrested in Moscow in December 2018 and sentenced to 16 years in prison in 2020 on espionage charges he consistently and vehemently denies. Whelan told CNN that \u201cit\u2019s surreal\u201d to spend another Fourth of July in Russian detention. \u201cYou kind of get used to these holidays going by and you try not to mark every holiday that you miss. But it\u2019s difficult because this would be a day that there would be parades, there would be firecrackers, there would be music on the White House lawn, there are concerts.

{"id": "2024_07_04_food_gen-z-drinking-trends-alcohol", "text": "Beer and hot dogs are as patriotic as it gets. But cracking open the cooler at your July 4th barbecue, you could be seeing fewer brews, with alternatives like spiked seltzers, canned cocktail and hard teas stealing their real estate. And you can blame the youngs for that: The youngest cohort of legal-aged drinkers from Gen Z, which encompass the ages from 21 to 26, are \u201cdrinking completely different than any other generation we\u2019ve seen before,\u201d according to NIQ\u2019s Kaleigh Theriault. \u201cThey\u2019re relatively new to their drinking and when they are choosing alcohol they are leaning toward those flavor-forward categories,\u201d Theriault, an associate director of beverage alcohol thought leadership at the consumer intelligence company, told CNN. Beverages created by smaller companies are controlling the landscape. E. & J. Gallo Winery\u2019s High Noon dominates the spirit-based cocktail category; White Claw from Mark Anthony Brands remains the top-selling spiked seltzer; and newer entrants, including punchier drinks that mix liquor with an iced tea or lemonade such as Surfside, a two-year-old brand, are rapidly gaining ground. That\u2019s a problem for Big Beer, which is dealing with flat sales, declining volume and a fickle generation of younger drinkers who are completely ditching the bottle or preferring anything but a regular beer. In response, Miller Lite-maker Molson Coors Beverage Company, Modelo-brewer Constellation Brands and heavyweight Anheuser-Busch InBev are among the larger brewers expanding beyond beer and diversifying their portfolio with flavorful concoctions. Fruit, in particular, has been a focus area because \u201cit\u2019s something that the consumer seems to be drawn to right now and they want to drink something really good,\u201d Theriault said. \u201cThose flavors offer that.\u201d Inspiration from TikTok Constellation turned to TikTok for inspiration for its newest beer, which is lightly based on the \u201cCorona Sunrise\u201d cocktail \u2014 a mixture of tequila, a Corona, orange juice, grenadine, plus a splash of lime juice. It has taken off on the video-sharing app, with the most-watched tutorial racking up nearly 14 million views. Since it\u2019s unlawful to sell a beer mixed with a spirit, Corona spun up its own version to hopefully appeal to younger drinkers: the \u201cSunbrew\u00a0Citrus Cerveza,\u201d which is brewed with orange and lime peels and blended with the same\u00a0juices and mixed with a Corona Extra to mirror the sweet flavor of the cocktail counterpart. \u201cThis new brew was created with the flavor-seeking Gen Z audience in mind, a group of drinkers known for their experimentation and mixing,\u201d noted Sa\u00fal Trejo, director of brand marketing at Corona, in a press release. For now, the drink is only available in the northeastern US before possibly expanding nationwide depending on sales. Sunbrew fits into Constellation\u2019s portfolio with a few other Gen Z-angled beverages like Fresca Mixed and its malt-based beverages, Corona Refresca and Modelo Spiked Aguas Frescas, both of which also have fruity flavors and are selling well for the company. TikTok has also influenced Molson Coors for one of its newest boozy beverages called \u201cHappy Thursday.\u201d The shtick? It\u2019s a non-carbonated drink because \u201cbloating that may come from carbonation is considered a top barrier\u201d for younger drinkers and the trend of \u201cdecarbonizing\u201d drinks is blowing up on the app. The \u201csmooth, bubble-free\u201d drink comes in four fruit flavors, including strawberry and black cherry, and also meets another need for Gen Z since it\u2019s low in alcohol content at 4.4% by volume. It also has bright packaging designed to \u201cpop on social media,\u201d the brewer notes. Launched less than three months ago, sales and distribution are both growing and feedback has been \u201cextremely positive\u201d for Happy Thursday, the company said on its blog. The company could shed more light on its sales during its next earnings report in August. Happy Thursday fits into the company\u2019s strategy that began in 2019 when Molson Coors tweaked its name to encompass its growing portfolio of beverages besides beer. That now includes hard iced tea, energy drinks and its Simply Spiked lineup. Last year, it acquired Blue Run Spirits, a cult favorite high-end bourbon and rye whiskey brand, in light of US spirit sales\u00a0surpassing beer sales. \u201cSuppliers, in order to stay relevant, have to evolve and follow where the consumer is trending \u2014 and right now the consumer wants flavor,\u201d NIQ\u2019s Theriault said about their pivots. \u201cInnovation is really important in the alcohol industry and ensuring that innovation is tied to the consumer trends is what\u2019s right for business.\u201d Building \u2018beyond beer\u2019 Canned cocktails and spirits-based beverages have also helped Anheuser-Busch\u2019s bottom line in the US, especially in light of the collapsing sales of Bud Light. Its aptly titled \u201cBeyond Beer\u201d category is currently a $1.5 billion part of its global business and is helping attract younger, legally aged drinkers. N\u00dcTRL, a flavorful lineup of vodka seltzers, and Cutwater Spirits canned cocktails are two standouts. An Anheuser-Busch spokesperson told CNN that Cutwater, which has a collection of canned rum mai tais, vodka mules and tequila palomas, has \u201csteadily grown dollar sales double digits for five consecutive years\u201d and jumped an additional 23% in sales this year. Still, it\u2019s not all rosy for Anheuser-Busch, especially if a drink has the Bud Light name attached. Bud Light Seltzer sales are down 50%, according to trade publication Brewbound, outpacing a larger decline in malt-based seltzers as drinkers shift toward spirit-based drinks. The company launched a new advertising campaign in 2023 just a few weeks before the Dylan Mulvaney controversy derailed its parent brand\u2019s sales. Despite younger drinkers\u2019 hesitance with buying beer and flat sales, Big Beer companies aren\u2019t facing an existential threat. In fact, it\u2019s the exact opposite, according to one expert. \u201cYoung drinkers can now find just about any kind of drink in just about any kind of flavor practically whenever they want, and they get to choose from the most diverse collection of beverages that has ever existed \u2014 with and without alcohol,\u201d Bryan Roth, an analyst for Feel Goods Company and editor of the alcohol beverage newsletter, Sightlines+, told\u00a0CNN. \u201cThese long-tenured and often historic companies are adapting to the market. What makes it particularly exciting is that consumers are more often leading the way,\u201d he added.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/04/food/gen-z-drinking-trends-alcohol/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/05/2024", "section": "us"}}

{"id": "2024_07_03_business_former-boeing-inspector-scrap-parts-assembly-lines", "text": "A former Boeing quality-control manager alleges that for years workers at its 787 Dreamliner factory in Everett, Washington, routinely took parts that were deemed unsuitable to fly out of an internal scrap yard and put them back on factory assembly lines\u00a0. In his first network TV interview, Merle Meyers, a 30-year veteran of Boeing, described to CNN what he says was an elaborate off-the-books practice that Boeing managers at the Everett factory used to meet production deadlines, including taking\u00a0damaged and improper parts from the company\u2019s scrapyard, storehouses and loading docks. A string of whistleblowers this year has raised allegations about Boeing factory lapses, including an official federal complaint\u00a0from a current employee\u00a0that Boeing hid potentially defective parts from Federal Aviation Administration inspectors, and that some of those parts likely ended up in planes. This all comes in the wake of a series of highly public safety issues that have rocked the company. Meyers\u2019 claims that lapses he witnessed\u00a0were intentional, organized efforts designed to thwart quality control processes in an effort to keep\u00a0up with demanding production schedules. Beginning in the early 2000s, Meyers says that for more than a decade, he estimates that about 50,000 parts \u201cescaped\u201d quality control\u00a0and were used to build aircraft. Those parts include everything from small items like screws to more complex assemblies like wing flaps. A single Boeing 787 Dreamliner, for example, has approximately 2.3 million parts. Most of the parts that were meant to be scrapped were often painted red to signify they were unsuitable for assembly lines, Meyers said. Yet, in some cases, that didn\u2019t stop them\u00a0 from being put into planes being assembled, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge problem,\u201d Meyers told CNN. \u201cA core requirement of a quality system is to keep bad parts and good parts apart.\u201d Airplanes are highly specified machines with much stricter safety standards than trains and cars. Their parts, materials and manufacturing processes are highly regulated. Meyers, whose job was to find quality problems at Boeing, says he believes he was forced out last year and says he was given a severance package that he is unable to discuss due to a privacy agreement he signed with Boeing. Based on conversations Meyers says he had with current Boeing workers in the time since he left the company, he believes that while employees no longer remove parts from the scrapyard, the practice of using other unapproved\u00a0parts in assembly lines continues. \u201cNow they\u2019re back to taking parts of body sections \u2013 everything \u2013 right when it arrives at the Everett site, bypassing quality, going right to the airplane,\u201d Meyers said. Company emails going back years show that Meyers repeatedly flagged the issue to Boeing\u2019s corporate investigations team, pointing out what he says were blatant violations of Boeing\u2019s safety rules. But investigators\u00a0routinely failed to enforce those rules, Meyers says, even ignoring \u201ceye witness observations\u00a0and the hard work done to ensure the safety of future passengers and crew,\u201d he wrote in an internal 2022 email provided to CNN. Meyers has also described his concerns about Boeing\u2019s quality issues to federal investigators, a Senate panel and the New York Times. In a statement to CNN, Boeing did not dispute Meyers\u2019 allegations. The company said it investigates \u201call allegations of improper behavior, such as unauthorized movement of parts or mishandling of documents,\u201d and makes improvements when appropriate. Swirl of controversy Meyers\u2019 allegations come as Boeing faces a swirl of controversy over its safety culture, including a criminal investigation into whether it misled the FAA over its 2017 certification of the 737 Max. A total of 346 people were killed in two 737 Max crashes in 2018 and 2019. As CNN reported over the weekend, the Justice Department is nearing an agreement with Boeing which would resolve potential criminal liability. In January, a door plug blew off of a 737 Max mid-flight, prompting a wave of intense scrutiny of the airplane manufacturer, including federal and congressional investigations. Boeing\u2019s CEO Dave Calhoun has announced he will step down by the end of this year. To address its safety issues, Boeing recently agreed to purchase supplier Spirit AeroSystems. Since January a number of whistleblowers have come forward with fresh allegations against Boeing. A current Boeing quality investigator, Sam Mohawk, also filed an official complaint last month reporting \u201ca number of non-compliant parts making their way back to the airplanes for installation.\u201d His complaint with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration was publicly released by a Senate subcommittee investigating Boeing. Mohawk\u2019s complaint said the issue of disappearing nonconforming parts continues.\u00a0\u201cBoeing is still losing parts to this day,\u201d his official complaint reads. A separate whistleblower, Richard Cuevas, last week made public his concerns that Boeing and its key supplier Spirit Aerosystems used compromised parts and made changes to \u201creduce bottlenecks in production and speed up production and delivery.\u201d Pulled from the scrapyard The pressure from Boeing management to keep assembly lines moving is no secret.\u00a0The 245-page House investigative report after the 737 Max fatal crashes dedicates an entire chapter to \u201cProduction Pressure.\u201d\u00a0After the January 5 door plug blowout on a 737 Max, the FAA capped\u00a0Boeing\u2019s production line speed. Meyers describes a pressure-packed environment at the Everett factory, where assembly teams competed with each other to find the parts they needed. Meyers alleges that after hours, workers would ask security guards to unlock doors and sneak parts out of supply rooms, or remove newly arrived components awaiting quality inspections by Meyers\u2019 team.\u00a0Similar parts destined for a different airplane model were ripe for the taking. At some point in the early 2000s, Boeing employees began also pulling parts from the company\u2019s scrapyard in Auburn, Washington, located about an hour south\u00a0of the nearly 100-acre factory building\u00a0where Dreamliners were assembled,\u00a0according to documentation\u00a0Meyers shared with CNN. Nonconforming parts end up in the reclamation yard, Meyers says, only after being\u00a0rejected by three departments:\u00a0Engineering, procurement, and quality. Meyers claims that by around 2002, employees at the reclamation yard became concerned that they would be considered responsible when scrap parts were later found on an aircraft.\u00a0So, they asked employees to sign for the removals \u2013 but their homemade form wasn\u2019t an official Boeing document, which meant the removal was never recorded in the company\u2019s quality management database. \u201cThese are bootleg forms that are not Boeing authorized,\u201d Meyers said.\u00a0\u201cThe procurement organization would go down to our scrap reclamation yard and intimidate the employees there and say we need these parts bad.\u201d Lack of enforcement Meyers says he repeatedly referred violations for investigation but found the company\u2019s efforts to look into them lacking. \u201cTheir investigations are about analyzing excuses by process violators, and not taking action against those committing compliance violations,\u201d Meyers wrote in a 2002 email to corporate HR at Boeing\u00a0. In its statement, Boeing said the quality team Meyers worked on \u201cplays an important role in identifying issues, improving processes, and strengthening compliance in our factories.\u201d \u201cWe appreciate employees who raise their voice and we have systems in place to encourage them to speak up confidentially or anonymously,\u201d the statement said. Meyers says his Boeing managers did not know how to handle employees who raised concerns, and said that after decades at the company he was ultimately given\u00a0a list of management grievances with his work, and offered a vague opportunity to improve \u2013 or take a cash payout and leave. \u201cI was given a list of things to correct \u2013 it was my behaviors and my practices as a manager,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cSo it looked like a personal improvement program \u2026 but it had a financial incentive with it \u2013 or you can take this money and quit.\u201d Meyers said he never intended to become a whistleblower but is now speaking with those who ask \u2013 including a Senate subcommittee probing Boeing \u2013 to generate momentum for change. \u201cHopefully we can get this company to heal and be what it was,\u201d he said.

{"id": "2024_07_03_us_navajo-nation-power-grid-connection", "text": "Katherine Benally\u00a0sat between two open windows in her small home and looked out over a\u00a0sun-baked field in the Chuska Mountain foothills of the vast Navajo Nation. As she waited for the cooling cross breeze, the 74-year-old recalled fondly the days when her family grew squash, corn and pumpkin on this property. They sought shade under its trees and had no need for electricity or other modern conveniences. \u201cThe weather,\u201d she said, \u201cit wasn\u2019t that hot.\u201d But that\u2019s all changed: The Navajo Nation last year declared an extreme heat emergency as temperatures hit well above 110 degrees in parts of the region. And the heat just keeps coming. These days, Benally barely steps outside her home. What she wants is to go outdoors more often, then return to the cool kiss of air conditioning. \u201cThat would be perfect,\u201d she said, smiling. But Benally \u2013 like 13,000 families in roughly a third of Navajo Nation households \u2013 is still off the electrical grid. Like many here, she uses solar panels to power essentials, such as a small refrigerator and a couple of light bulbs. But the power doesn\u2019t last all day. Now, as global temperatures keep rising, the rush to fully electrify one of the poorest regions in the United States is more urgent than ever. To that end, several power poles laid flat this month on Benally\u2019s land, waiting to be installed so she can connect to the power grid for the first time.\u00a0Thanks to a non-profit initiative called Light Up Navajo, 46 utility companies from 16 states are partnering this year with the Navajo Nation\u2019s utility authority to build dozens of miles of power lines under the same kind of mutual aid pacts that help restore power after natural disasters. It\u2019s no easy task in an area known for its\u00a0rugged terrain and arid climate.\u00a0But it\u2019s ever more critical to the health and safety of a community that traces its roots in the American Southwest back at least 800 years. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy that this still happens in America,\u201d said Bryan English, a crew foreman with Trico Electric Cooperative in Arizona who\u2019s working his second year in a row on the project. Connecting a home a mile from Benally\u2019s, English wiped sweat from his brow: \u201cI don\u2019t think any part of America shouldn\u2019t have electricity in 2024.\u201d Business and political factors pose obstacles Roughly the size of West Virginia, the Navajo Nation long has been rich with energy sources and production. But while private companies tapped those resources in the 20th\u00a0century to help electrify areas around the Southwest, the Navajo Nation reaped few benefits. \u201cIt\u2019s a fairly unique rural situation,\u201d said Dave Lock with the Grand Canyon State Electric Cooperative Association. \u201cA hundred years ago, when the rural electrification effort came into focus, a lot of rural areas across the country were like Navajo Nation: It wasn\u2019t profitable for the for-profit utilities to go out and bring them power because of the long distances.\u201d That changed under President Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s administration in the 1930s, when farmers banded together to create rural co-ops to power remote parts of the country, using federal loans under the Rural Electrification Act. But many Native American nations at the time were still trying to assimilate and fell behind in the electrification efforts, according to a 2023 US Energy Department report to Congress. The non-profit Navajo Tribal Utility Authority started up in 1959 to help rectify the issue, but a complex myriad of political and geographical obstacles have made it more difficult to get the nation fully on the grid. Among the hurdles, the federal government put a 40-year development ban \u2013 known as the Bennett Freeze \u2013 across roughly 1.5 million acres of Navajo land to settle a dispute between the Navajo Nation and the Hopi Tribe. The ban, lifted in 2009, barred installation of electricity and other key infrastructure. The slow, steady slog to connect households to the power grid is expensive. Today, it costs the Navajo Nation $40,000 per family, largely due to the remote, desert land. It\u2019s a massive financial challenge in an area where the average annual household income is just over $30,000, less than half the national rate. Without help from projects like Light Up Navajo,\u00a0it could cost close to $1 billion to extend electricity to all 13,000 families, tribal utility authorities estimate.\u00a0That astronomical sum \u2013 including hundreds of millions of dollars for transmission lines, electric substations and house wiring \u2013 is a huge reason other cooperatives have decided to help, their representatives said. In 2019, the Navajo Tribal Utility Authority partnered with the American Public Power Association, a non-profit industry lobbying group, to create Light Up Navajo, which so far has connected almost 850 families. But even with help from utilities across the country and groups like the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association, another trade group, it could take three more decades to run power to every household. The partnership relies on a mix of private and federal funding. Workers come out for a 13-week stretch each spring and summer to set up the connections, while the tribal utility authority works year-round to get the homes shovel-ready. The task is \u201cfar from over,\u201d said Deenise Becenti, the tribal utility authority\u2019s government and public affairs manager. But when companies volunteer manpower and services, it makes the overall mission feel within reach. \u201cIf it weren\u2019t for Light Up Navajo,\u201d she said, \u201csome of the families who\u2019ve already received electricity would still be on the waiting list for years to come.\u201d Using cars to charge phones and feel cool air Living without connected electricity had been a way of life for so many in the Navajo Nation. But with the climate changing and technology advancing, many families are signing up to get on the Light Up Navajo waiting list. Without a grid connection, residents use their vehicles to charge cell phones or get a brief taste of air conditioning. One young family in Crystal, New Mexico, with a 2-year-old and a baby on the way picks up fresh produce and meat daily from a store 45 minutes away, then cooks dinner over a campfire before the sun goes down, they said. They don\u2019t have a working refrigerator. Many families use camp-style coolers to store food, but those need constant supplies of ice, which quickly melts. Thirty miles south, Arlene Henry,\u00a056, lives on a small compound with her sisters, children and grandchildren. She planted a tree, hoping to land at least a sliver of shade on their property, but insects thwarted its potential. \u201cWe\u2019re looking for shade all the time,\u201d Henry said. Her family sits outside in the afternoons and seeks relief in the shadow of her home, moving seats around the house to hide from the roving sun. \u201cWe sometimes bring ice, but it just melts right then and there.\u201d Solar panels power the family\u2019s refrigerator, two light bulbs and the flashlights they use to get to their outhouse at night. More than anything, Henry worries about her adult son, who relies on supplemental oxygen and has trouble keeping the tank powered full-time, she said. In 90-degree heat, she recently eyed her 2-year-old granddaughter riding around on a red tricycle. The little girl enjoyed an ice pop. But after a few minutes, Henry urged her to come back to the shade. \u201cCome this way, baby, come this way,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s too hot over there.\u201d Henry clutched some framed photos of her parents and grandparents who grew up on this land and passed it down to her and her sisters. But now, the lack of electricity scares her \u2013 though she also doesn\u2019t want to leave this place that means so much. \u201cI thought it was normal,\u201d she said of growing up without electricity. \u201cBut now it\u2019s getting to me.\u201d A single bulb \u2013 and a face \u2013 light up So far this summer, Light Up Navajo has connected\u00a0125 homes with 38 miles of power lines built and a goal of connecting\u00a025 more homes by the end of July, when the rainy season starts. William Lee Tom Jr.,\u00a056, benefited from one of those new connections this summer. He\u2019s lived the past 15 years without electricity near Window Rock, Arizona, and didn\u2019t want to leave because he can afford this house and it\u2019s close to his family. Before the power hookup, Tom and his son often slept outside in his truck or in a wooden, tent-like structure when it got too hot. Once, while out on errands, his son had to go to the hospital due to dehydration, Tom said. \u201cA lot of times, it\u2019s just unbearable,\u201d he said. Power line workers with Light Up Navajo recently installed poles at Tom\u2019s property, and on June 13, they strung up the final wires to electrify his house.\u00a0The crew wore long-sleeved work shirts and white hard hats, with cloth covers draping from the back to protect their necks from the scorching sun. After a lineman flipped a few switches on a new breaker box, Tom walked inside and turned on his only light bulb \u2013 one he\u2019d just bought and installed an hour earlier. The dark room now had light, but it was the normally reserved mechanic\u2019s face that lit up even more. Surprised it actually worked, Tom let out a triumphant \u201cAlriiiiight!\u201d He paused to look around the room, joking he could now see its messy contents. \u201cWow, that\u2019s neat,\u201d Tom added. \u201cI\u2019ve seen electricity before but not in my own property.\u201d Now, he looks forward to installing an air conditioning unit.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/03/us/navajo-nation-power-grid-connection/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/05/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_07_02_us_leonard-peltier-denied-parole-fbi-killings", "text": "Leonard Peltier, the Indigenous activist convicted of the 1975 murders of two FBI agents, has been denied parole from federal prison, his attorney told CNN on Tuesday. Peltier, 79, has long maintained his innocence in the shooting deaths of agents Ronald A. Williams and Jack R. Coler. Peltier\u2019s legal team says they plan to appeal the parole board\u2019s decision. Coler and Williams were killed in a shootout June 26, 1975, while searching for a robbery suspect on the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota. In 1977, Peltier was found guilty of first-degree murder and sentenced to two consecutive life terms, though he denied shooting Coler and Williams. \u201cI didn\u2019t kill those agents, I didn\u2019t see who killed those agents, and if I did know, I\u2019m not telling. But I don\u2019t know. That\u2019s the point,\u201d Peltier told CNN correspondent Mark Potter in 1999. Peltier said he fired shots during the gunbattle but \u201cI know I didn\u2019t hit them. I know I didn\u2019t.\u201d The government built its case on ballistics evidence and witness accounts from people who were on the periphery of the shootout, including Native Americans, but no one actually saw the killings. As a leader of the American Indian Movement in the 70s, Peltier\u2019s conviction has long been polarizing. He has been denied parole before \u2013 in 2009, according to The Associated Press, and in 2017, President Barack Obama denied his clemency request. During Peltier\u2019s parole hearing last month, his failing health, age and nonviolent record during his nearly 50 years in prison were all highlighted. Peltier won\u2019t be eligible for another parole hearing until June 2026, a US Parole Commission spokesperson said. \u201cToday\u2019s announcement continues the injustice of this long ordeal for Leonard Peltier,\u201d Peltier\u2019s attorney, Kevin Sharp, said in a statement. \u201cThis decision is a missed opportunity for the United States to finally recognize the misconduct of the FBI and send a message to Indian Country regarding the impacts of the federal government\u2019s actions and policies of the 1970\u2019s.\u201d FBI Director Christopher Wray said the bureau is pleased the US Parole Commission \u201ccontinued to side with the facts.\u201d \u201cNo amount of prison time will ever change the facts\u00a0surrounding the murders of FBI Special Agents Coler and Williams,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cMr. Peltier has been afforded his rights and due process time and again, and repeatedly, the weight of the evidence has supported his conviction and his life sentence.\u201d Supporters of Peltier have said the evidence, including ballistics, produced at trial was unreliable; the FBI has categorically denied it fabricated evidence or coerced witnesses. Lynn Crooks, a prosecutor at Peltier\u2019s 1977 double-murder trial, told CNN in 1999 that they proved Peltier was a participant in the killings. \u201cWhoever was down there was essentially down there under the influence of Leonard\u00a0Peltier,\u201d he said. \u201cThey aren\u2019t down there to give aid and comfort to these two injured, dying men. They\u2019re down there to execute them, and that\u2019s exactly what they did.\u201d Peltier told CNN he was in bed at camp when he heard gunshots. \u201cAll of a sudden everybody said, \u2018Man, we\u2019re being attacked. We\u2019re being attacked,\u2019\u201d he said in 1999. \u201cI says, \u2018Oh, my God.\u2019 So I grabbed an old rifle and started running up to the house.\u201d He said he fired his gun after being fired upon. The FBI has said the agents were shot without provocation. The FBI Agents Association applauded the parole board\u2019s decision Tuesday, saying it \u201cupholds justice for our fallen colleagues and their families.\u201d \u201cThe FBIAA reaffirms its commitment to honoring the memory of Agents Coler and Williams, and Peltier\u2019s continued incarceration is necessary to ensure public safety and respect for the law,\u201d the association said in the statement. Nick Tilsen, president of Indigenous activist group NDN Collective, said, \u201cToday is a sad day for Indigenous Peoples and justice everywhere. The U.S. Parole Commission\u2019s denial of parole for Leonard Peltier, America\u2019s longest serving Indigenous political prisoner, is a travesty.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/02/us/leonard-peltier-denied-parole-fbi-killings/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/05/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_07_04_us_fireworks-july-4-essay-cec", "text": "My pregnant mom was certain she knew how things would go that night. It was late afternoon, but she already had movie tickets in her pocket. I wasn\u2019t due for another month. And my parents were excited to see \u201cStar Trek II: The Wrath of Khan\u201d in a few hours. But I surprised my family with a different sort of spectacle. My mom\u2019s water broke while she was washing the dishes that day. And I made my entrance on July 4, just after 10 p.m., when surely a few fireworks were still lighting up the Chicago sky. The idea that I burst into the world during the event\u2019s finale is a bit of family lore I\u2019ve always loved retelling. For decades, the beauty and fun of fireworks were deeply intertwined with the way I saw my country and myself. To me, these were facts as indisputable as the wetness of water or the blueness of the sky. But I see things differently now. And that\u2019s something I never expected. Fireworks were a huge part of my \u20184th of July Baby\u2019 identity Growing up, it\u2019s not an overstatement to say no one loved going to see July 4 fireworks more than I did. Yes, it was a bit of a blow to my only-child, millennial mentality to learn at a young age that all the festivities that day weren\u2019t just for me. But I quickly learned to love sharing my 4th of July birthday with America. It\u2019s amazing for most of your loved ones to have the day off on your birthday, and for everyone around you to be celebrating. Gifts emblazoned with American flags became a beloved part of my birthday repertoire, from earrings to T-shirts to teddy bears. I loved flaunting my patriotism. As a toddler, I learned to belt out \u201cGod Bless America,\u201d \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner\u201d and, of course, \u201cI\u2019m a Yankee Doodle Dandy.\u201d More than anything, I loved going with my family to watch the fireworks. There was nothing like the feeling of seeing colors burst into the sky as the symphony played the triumphant finale of the 1812 Overture. The boom of the cannons was thrilling. And the way those extra sparkly golden fireworks crackled gave me the good kind of goosebumps. Even when it was clear the show had ended, I\u2019d look upward toward the wisps of smoke in the atmosphere and hope there might still be more. As I grew older and life got busier, my birthday celebrations became more muted. Sometimes I\u2019d have to work. Sometimes there wasn\u2019t time to plan a party. But no matter, what, I\u2019d have one requirement. \u201cAll I want is to see at least one firework in the sky,\u201d was a refrain I repeated many times when asked how I planned to celebrate. On my 35th birthday, that\u2019s just what I said. And my boyfriend granted that wish, taking me to see a lovely firework display in a town square outside Atlanta. We watched children playing with sparklers and listened to a concert band play as dusk fell. It was as idyllic an American night as anyone could have imagined. But the next day I\u2019d learn that a family I knew had a very different experience that night, only a few miles away. It was their first July 4 in America I first met Abdalla Munye and his family in January 2017, days after the Trump administration\u2019s travel ban went into effect. Abdalla, his wife Habibo and seven children who made the journey with them had only been living in the US for a few days. These Somali refugees were supposed to be starting their new lives, but instead found themselves at a press conference, sobbing in front of strangers. Because of the travel ban, they feared they might never see their daughter, Batulo, again. Officials had booked her on a separate flight a few days after theirs, and the surprise travel ban left her stranded in a refugee camp in Kenya. I spent weeks alongside the family, chronicling how the travel ban affected them. When courts blocked the policy and Batulo finally made it to the US nearly a month later, I was with them at the Atlanta airport and was able to share the story of their reunion with millions of people. Knowing that moment would mark the end of one journey and the beginning of another, we stayed in touch, and I kept visiting them for months so I could tell the story of their first year in America. That\u2019s when an unexpected conversation we had opened my eyes to a reality I\u2019d never considered. I visited Abdalla and his family the day after my birthday, on July 5, 2017, and I still remember how struck I was by what he said. I\u2019d expected him to tell me his family had spent their first Independence Day in America having a cookout, or maybe watching a parade, or gazing in wonder as beautiful fireworks illuminated the sky. But when I asked how their July 4 had been, Abdalla said they\u2019d spent the night hiding in the dark in their apartment, afraid to go outside. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d I asked, naively. Abdalla told me the sounds they\u2019d heard outside made them think of the night when their oldest daughter had been raped and murdered. Memories of war and bloodshed and tragedy raced through his mind. He\u2019d been taught in his refugee orientation that July 4 was a time for celebration in the United States, but he couldn\u2019t believe that\u2019s what was unfolding around them. For Abdalla, there was only one possibility. The dangers they\u2019d fled had found them here, too. In my steno pad, I jotted down Abdalla\u2019s description of the experience. \u201cIt sounded,\u201d he said, \u201clike Somalia.\u201d What a series of panicked text messages reminded me Six months later, on New Year\u2019s Eve, I got a series of frantic WhatsApp message from Abdalla that I\u2019ll never forget. Hello! This is Abdalla how are you doing I hope u doing good, how is the weather today does it change like Somalia we had some booms in our area what is going on we almost to run, don\u2019t forget when u are running tell us too to run on our side. At first, I was puzzled by what he\u2019d written. Then I thought back to our conversation in July. New Year\u2019s revelry was frightening his family the same way Independence Day festivities had. He was asking me what I was hearing on the other side of town. And he wanted me to alert him if I was fleeing, so his family would be able to escape in time, too. I tried writing a brief explanation to reassure him. And I sent a photo of fireworks, too. Abdalla\u2019s English had improved so much since his arrival, but he was still learning. I hoped the image would calm his fears and clarify any confusion in case something had gotten lost in translation. \u201cHere people sometimes celebrate the New Year with fireworks\u2026you don\u2019t need to run! How are you doing?\u201d His response made it clear he was unconvinced. Am fine but u say that it sounds like booms it\u2019s not the way u think. And it is night and why are they booming night time. \u201cIt is just a tradition for some people. \u2026 I know it is scary to hear,\u201d I wrote. \u201cHopefully it will stop soon and you can get some rest.\u201d Ok let us pray to God in the morning to wake up peacefully with kids. The idea that fireworks had inspired this exchange was a sobering reminder that\u2019s stuck with me ever since. By the time my next birthday rolled around, so much had changed in my life. I\u2019d moved to the Washington, DC area, and it had been months since I\u2019d spoken with Abdalla and his family. I watched fireworks with my fianc\u00e9 from an apartment rooftop, and I laughed as I heard my friend\u2019s son gleefully shouting, \u201cHi, fireworks!\u201d as they lit up the horizon. But in my mind, I heard Abdalla\u2019s voice, too, even though he was hundreds of miles away. The way I celebrate July 4 has changed I have thought about my conversations with Abdalla and his family many times over the years. The visual beauty of fireworks still wows me. But every July 4, I now find myself closing my eyes for a few moments, and hearing how those same sounds could so easily be a very different kind of explosion. I think about how lucky I have been to live my whole life without a shred of doubt that the boom of a firework was a sound of celebration. And I think about how so many others have stories like Abdalla\u2019s. The UN refugee agency estimates there are now more 117 million forcibly displaced people in the world \u2014 roughly equal to a third of the entire US population. I think back on my mom, washing the dishes 42 years ago, with movie tickets in her pocket and no doubt in her mind about what that July 4 had in store. Until everything changed in an instant. So many times, we are so certain about our futures, only to find out something unexpected awaits us. That\u2019s the beauty and the terror of living. Abdalla never expected people in his own family to be killed as armed groups ravaged the Somali countryside. He never expected to be forced by war to flee his home. He never expected a US president\u2019s decision would throw his life into chaos. He never expected to end up on the other side of the world, hiding in his apartment with the lights off in the place where he thought he\u2019d be safe. I don\u2019t speak with Abdalla as regularly as I once did when writing about his family. But I try to stay in touch with people who\u2019ve trusted me to help share their stories. It\u2019s been more than seven years since we first met, and Abdalla and I still exchange text messages every so often. He sent me photos of Batulo\u2019s wedding. After my own daughter was born a few years ago, I sent him pictures of our family, too. He wrote to me recently to ask how my daughter was doing. And I asked him about his family and their plans for July 4 this year. They now live in Kentucky, where Abdalla works for Amazon sorting clothing returns. These days, Abdalla says his family is more prepared for July 4. \u201cWe are used to it,\u201d he says. \u201cIn America we see people celebrating it. And we also changed.\u201d America is their country now, too. And Abdalla says his family has grown accustomed to watching their neighbors lighting fireworks. \u201cThat is how we celebrate with them,\u201d he says. But still, his family stays inside to be safe, watching from behind the windows of their home. I haven\u2019t had a chance to make plans for my birthday this year. But I\u2019m hoping to see at least one firework in the sky. When I do, I\u2019ll think of Abdalla and his family, and I\u2019ll think of this country \u2014 our country \u2014 and how lucky we are to share it.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/04/us/fireworks-july-4-essay-cec/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/05/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_07_03_us_kansas-school-district-justice-department-settlement", "text": "The largest public school district in Kansas has agreed to revise its disciplinary practices as part of a settlement with the US Justice Department, resolving a federal civil rights investigation that determined its educators engaged in a pattern of discrimination against Black and disabled students. As part of the settlement agreement, which the Justice Department announced Tuesday, the Wichita Public Schools district will implement changes to end its use of seclusion, reform its restraint practices and refrain from referring students to law enforcement while dealing with routine school discipline matters, the department said in a news release. Black students in the district faced harsher, more severe disciplinary action than White students who engaged in \u201csimilar conduct and had similar backgrounds and disciplinary histories,\u201d the agency found. Insubordination was the most common offense for which the district disciplined Black students at a higher rate. The agency called the pattern \u201cespecially stark\u201d when it came to disciplining Black girls, whose behavior was \u201crepeatedly characterized using stereotypical terms like \u2018attitude\u2019 or \u2018drama,\u2019\u201d the release said. Black girls were also frequently and unnecessarily excluded from the school environment for \u201cperceived insubordination\u201d as well as dress code violations at some middle schools, the agreement said. During the period covered by the investigation, students with disabilities were subjected to 98% of the district\u2019s roughly 3,000 restraints and seclusions, and at least 44 students received 20 or more, the release said; one student was restrained or secluded at least 144 times, including 99 seclusions that lasted over 15 hours. Investigators visited the district\u2019s special schools for students with behavioral disabilities and discovered \u201cinferior facilities devoid of furniture, educational equipment and the kinds of decor commonly found in schools, and staff who could not meet the needs of students,\u201d the release stated. By the start of the next school year this fall, the district is required to create an Office of Behavior Management Support and Oversight to monitor restraint practices, ensuring compliance with the agreement, the settlement document says. As part of the new policy, educators can only restrain students when they pose an imminent danger of serious physical harm to themselves or others, it said. The district must also write a new code of conduct policy that will \u201cstandardize dress code policies and create a behavior intervention protocol\u201d to prevent discrimination in disciplining students, among other measures, the department said. It will provide counseling, as well as compensatory education to students who experienced repeated seclusion, according to the agreement. Nationally, Black students experience more restraints and seclusions At a Tuesday news conference, Kelly Bielefeld, the school district\u2019s superintendent, said the investigation started in spring 2022, adding: \u201cWe don\u2019t know what may have prompted the initial inquiry, but I can tell you that we can, and we must create a more equitable school district.\u201d The Justice Department has conducted similar investigations into school districts across the nation, including one completed in 2021 that revealed Black and Asian American Students at the Davis School District in Utah were harassed for years and officials deliberately ignored complaints from parents and students. The department\u2019s Educational Opportunities Section, part of its civil rights division, has been investigating and resolving complaints of improper seclusion of students with disabilities in public schools. According to a 2023\u00a0report\u00a0from the US Department of Education\u2019s Office for Civil Rights, \u201capproximately 52,800 K-12 students were physically restrained, mechanically restrained, and/or placed in seclusion at schools,\u201d during the 2020-2021 school year. While Black students made up 15% of K-12 public school enrollment during the same year, the report found they accounted for 21% of students physically restrained, 42% of the students restrained using a device or equipment, and 19% of students secluded. Boys, Black students, students of two or more races and students with disabilities were also more likely to be restrained,\u00a0the report said. \u201cBlack students inside our nation\u2019s public schools should not have to face discipline or a referral to law enforcement because of their race. And students with disabilities should not have to experience the trauma of seclusion or improper restraint,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights Kristen Clarke. \u201cSchools in our communities should not be a place of fear or mistrust.\u201d CNN\u2019s Chandelis Duster and Nia Mclean contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/03/us/kansas-school-district-justice-department-settlement/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/05/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_30_us_missouri-prison-guards-othel-moore-death", "text": "Five former corrections officers are facing\u00a0a combination of assault, manslaughter and murder charges\u00a0over the December 8 death of Othel Moore Jr., a former inmate at a maximum security prison in Jefferson City, Missouri,\u00a0according to newly released indictments. The officers were part of a Corrections Emergency Response Team (CERT), which are specially trained units designed to deal with violent prison situations, at the Jefferson City Correctional Center. A former inmate at the correctional center tells CNN he witnessed\u00a0officers create\u00a0the violent circumstances that killed the 39-year-old Moore, whose 2023 death forms part of an especially deadly year in Missouri prisons. \u201cI never watched anybody die before,\u201d Jordan Seller, 27, told CNN, as he explained the events leading to Moore\u2019s death began with what was supposed to be a routine search of the cells on the maximum-security prison block he shared with Moore. \u201cThey come in like a hundred deep, you know, and that\u2019s barely an exaggeration, you know, they try to come in and pull everybody out as fast as they can, search cells fast as they can and get out,\u201d Seller said. He and his cellmate had already been pulled out and put back in their cell when they noticed the commotion building around Moore\u2019s cell, Seller says. \u201cThe cell was surrounded by CO\u2019s,\u201d or corrections officers, Seller said and that Moore was pleading with them he had a medical lay-in and needed to be put in two pairs of handcuffs, essentially latched together with the outside rings on the wrist to ease tension on the shoulders being pulled back. Seller said they\u2019re commonly used for bigger inmates or those who may have trouble putting their hands behind their backs. Seller says the correctional officers refused to listen to Moore and began treating him as if he was non-compliant. The officers proceeded to pepper spray Moore, slam him to the ground and force him into a single pair of handcuffs, he says. \u201cHe can\u2019t see. He\u2019s spitting out mace, he\u2019s coughing, he can\u2019t breathe and he\u2019s telling them \u2018I\u2019m allergic to mace, you need to hurry up and get medical here,\u2019\u201d Seller said. Seller says he was looking up at the commotion from his cell on the lower floor of the prison block before Moore was brought down the stairs closer to him in a \u201creal aggressive\u201d manner. The correctional officers placed Moore\u00a0in \u201csome kind of chair-like contraption,\u201d according to Seller,\u00a0which the county prosecuting attorney has said was a restraint chair, sometimes used in corrections facilities. Seller says the prison guards began to place a spit mask on Moore, but Seller maintained he was only spitting out mace. \u201cOf course, he\u2019s refusing this because there\u2019s no reason for them to put a spit mask on,\u201d said Seller, who also says he witnessed this a few feet from his cell door. \u201cHe don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on. He can\u2019t see, you know, so they\u2019re grabbing on him trying to put something on his head. He\u2019s fighting it. Well, then they started shocking him with the shock glove.\u201d Seller then recounted what he believes were Moore\u2019s final moments, when the officers pulled out what appeared to be \u201can all-black motorcycle helmet, you know, darkened mask, all that,\u201d and put it on Moore\u2019s head. \u201cImmediately he\u2019s jumping, hopping, and you can hear him screaming, you know, \u2018Help! I can\u2019t breathe. I can\u2019t breathe, take it off. I can\u2019t breathe. I\u2019m, I\u2019m allergic to mace. I need help.\u2019 And then it gets worse and worse,\u201d Seller said. \u201cHe\u2019s jumping up and down shaking. And, you know, slowly, his screams are getting weaker and weaker,\u201d Seller said. \u201cI believe I watched him die before they even took him out the wing,\u201d he said. \u201cI watched the people that are supposed to be protecting me, kill somebody, literally killed them, you know? And that brought on such a fear, you know? The realization that these people can kill me and there\u2019s nothing I can do about it,\u201d said Seller. Moore was declared dead that day. What the indictment says When the arrests were made Friday, Cole County Prosecuting Attorney Locke Thompson largely corroborated to CNN Seller\u2019s eyewitness account of what happened to Moore, including the use of a \u201cspit mask and padded helmet.\u201d During a contraband sweep of the prison, Moore \u201cwas pepper sprayed twice during the operation before being placed in a spit hood, leg wrap, and restraint chair and transferred to a separate housing unit, where he was left in the hood, wrap, and restraint chair for approximately thirty minutes,\u201d the prosecutor said in a statement. \u201cMultiple witnesses heard Moore pleading with the corrections staff and telling them that he could not breathe\u201d before he was transferred to the prison hospital wing and pronounced dead, Thompson said. A statement of probable cause against the charged officers describing the incident said Moore \u201cshowed no aggression to any members of the CERT team during this process and was on video being compliant,\u201d and that Moore \u201cmade no threats to anyone.\u201d The use of a \u201cshock glove\u201d on Moore, as Seller described to CNN, was not mentioned by the prosecutor. Former corrections officers Justin Leggins, Jacob Case, Aaron Brown, Gregory Varner and Bryanne Bradshaw were all charged in this case. Leggins and Case were charged with second-degree murder and second-degree assault, in part for \u201crecklessly\u201d causing physical injury to Moore by pepper-spraying him in the face, according to court documents. Brown was charged with second-degree murder, and assault in the second degree, for \u201crecklessly\u201d causing serious physical injury to Moore by \u201cplacing a mask\u201d over Moore\u2019s face, which \u201cinhibited\u201d his ability to breathe, according to a joint felony complaint against the officers. Varner was charged with second-degree murder and assault in the second degree for \u201crecklessly\u201d causing \u201cserious physical injury\u201d to Moore by leaving him \u201cin a position which caused his asphyxiation,\u201d the complaint said. Bradshaw was charged with involuntary manslaughter in the second degree and is accused of negligently causing Moore\u2019s death by leaving him in a position that caused \u201casphyxiation,\u201d the complaint alleges. CNN has attempted to identify attorneys for each of the former officers arrested but has not been able to make contact. Leggins, Case and Brown had their charges read to them during arraignments in court Monday, Thompson told CNN. A judge refused to allow bond for those three defendants, The Associated Press reported Monday. Varner is scheduled to be arraigned Wednesday, Thompson told CNN. Bradshaw has been released from jail after paying bond, and has a court hearing scheduled for the end of July, Thompson told CNN on Monday. In response to the murder charges, the Missouri Department of Corrections said in a statement it \u201chas discontinued use of the restraint system in which Moore was held.\u201d Additionally, the statement said the department has begun using body-worn cameras in maximum-security prisons, starting with Jefferson City Correctional Center, to \u201cbolster both security and accountability.\u201d It also said 10 people involved in the incident have been terminated following internal and independent law enforcement investigations, including the five officers charged. The corrections department previously confirmed that the warden of the prison at the time of Moore\u2019s killing, Doris Falkenrath, was no longer with the department. Falkenrath was not among those arrested and not listed on the indictments filed Friday. Following the indictment, Othel Moore\u2019s family filed a federal civil lawsuit against the officers, the prison warden at the time of the killing and the previous director of the Missouri Department of Corrections, alleging, in part, that Moore is dead \u201cbecause of the actions, inactions, conscious disregard, willful and wanton, and depraved behavior\u201d of the then corrections officers. The suit also alleges the \u201cattack\u201d was not an isolated incident but the \u201cmanifestation of a barbarous pattern and practice, fostered by the highest-ranking members of the Missouri Department of Corrections.\u201d A spokesperson for the Missouri Department of Corrections told CNN the department won\u2019t comment on pending litigation. Attorneys Andrew M. Stroth and Steven Hart are among those representing Moore\u2019s family. In remarks to the press Friday following the announcement of the charges, Stroth said, \u201cThese charges are historic. These charges are unprecedented. When you hear about what happened, witnesses saw what happened, video evidence shows what happened. It\u2019s George Floyd 3.0 in a prison. Othel Moore, like George Floyd, was beaten. Othel was actually pepper sprayed, they put a spit mask on his face, they put him in the prone position face down. They shocked him with shock gloves. The entire time before his death was screaming. \u2018I can\u2019t breathe.\u2019\u201d Stroth told CNN: \u201cI\u2019ve reviewed hundreds of police cases, prison cases, this is one of the most egregious cases I have ever seen.\u201d \u2018We want transparency and accountability\u2019 It\u2019s also part of a worsening trend in the Missouri prison system. From 2012 to 2019, the average number of deaths, which includes natural deaths, hovered around 99 per year, according to state data obtained by CNN through a Missouri Sunshine Law request. From 2020 to 2023, the average number of deaths then climbed to 128 per year, a near 30 percent jump. There were fewer people incarcerated in Missouri in 2023 than at any time since at least 2012, according to state data. However, it was the prison system\u2019s deadliest year over that time period. Last year saw 137 prison deaths, with Othel Moore among them. Lori Curry, founder and executive director of the non-profit advocacy group Missouri Prison Reform, told CNN her group is regularly in touch with around 900 inmates, or \u201cresidents of prisons,\u201d as Curry described them, to use more humanizing language. Her organization also tracks deaths reported in prisons and based on the data they provided to CNN, \u201cwhat (the state) refer to as natural deaths\u201d was the most frequent listing as manner of death in their numbers over 2022 and 2023. However, Curry cast doubt on the state listings and attributes the rise in the number of deaths in recent years to \u201cdeclining healthcare, an increase in drugs and overdoses, and an increase of staffing shortages,\u201d she told CNN. She said her advocacy group quickly learned about the disturbing circumstances around Moore\u2019s killing. \u201cPeople in prisons notified us about the situation immediately,\u201d Curry said. She also believes\u00a0\u201cthe Department of Corrections needs to be more forthcoming\u201d about the information around this and that if lawyers, family and others were not so vocal about the case it would not have stayed in the spotlight. Curry founded Missouri Prison Reform in 2019 after launching an anonymous Twitter account where she reported stories relayed to her by inmates. Many years and many stories later, \u201cI\u2019ve been appalled at the things that have gone on in [Missouri] prisons,\u201d she told CNN. \u201cWe want transparency and accountability from our department of corrections,\u201d she added. Seller, who has seen the dynamic between guards and inmates up close, says he wants the same thing. \u201cI see police officers out here wearing body cameras all the time, you know, and it\u2019s required for their stops, arrests, all that. And I believe that\u2019s the only solution for the way that inmates are getting treated is that the CO\u2019s are required to wear body cameras,\u201d Seller told CNN. \u201cYou can\u2019t trust the people that are supposed to protect you,\u201d he said. \u201cThis has become such a big pandemic. I mean, I\u2019m calling it a pandemic, you know, and it\u2019s severe and it\u2019s a big problem.\u201d Seller was serving a six-year sentence after pleading guilty to second-degree rape in 2018, according to court records. State registry records also show the victim in that case was a minor. Seller did his time at a few prisons before being released from the Jefferson City Correctional Center in March. \u201cI did a lot of good for myself in there, a lot of soul searching,\u201d Seller said. He told CNN his reason for coming forward was simple: \u201cIt\u2019s something that\u2019s wrong, that needs to be addressed. Something needs to change,\u201d he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/30/us/missouri-prison-guards-othel-moore-death/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/05/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_07_02_us_salman-rushdie-stabbing-suspect-plea-deal-reject", "text": "The man accused of stabbing author Salman\u00a0Rushdie, leaving him blind in one eye, rejected a plea deal Tuesday that would have tied in a federal terrorism-related charge but reduced his state prison sentence, according to the suspect\u2019s lawyer. The 75-year-old famed author\u00a0\u2013 who has for decades lived under threat because of his writings \u2013\u00a0was stabbed multiple times onstage as he prepared to give a lecture at the\u00a0Chautauqua Institution\u00a0in western New York on August 12, 2022. The suspect, Hadi Matar, has pleaded not guilty to state charges of second-degree attempted murder and second-degree assault. Under the conditions of the proposed plea deal, Matar would have received a 20-year sentence for the top state charge, which has a maximum sentence of 25 years, according to the Chautauqua County District Attorney\u2019s Office. The proposed agreement was made with the understanding that Matar would also plead guilty to a federal charge, for which he could receive additional prison time, said his defense attorney, Nathaniel Barone. That charge alleges Matar attempted to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization, Barone said. Matar\u2019s total prison time under the agreement likely would have been between 30 and 40 years, with lifetime supervision upon release, according to the DA\u2019s office. \u201cAt this point now, we need to change our direction a little bit and start focusing on actual trial preparation,\u201d Barone told CNN.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s going to take us the full next several months leading up to jury selection in order to properly and adequately prepare.\u201d Matar\u2019s trial is scheduled to begin on September 9, according to his attorney and the prosecutor\u2019s office. The trial was initially set for January 8 this year, but the court granted a request for a delay earlier that month, his attorney previously told CNN. Barone said Rushdie\u2019s then-upcoming memoir about the 2022 attack and his recovery for it, titled \u201cKnife: Meditations After an Attempted Murder,\u201d was not the reason for the delay in the trial. But he went on to say, \u201cpursuant to the New York State Criminal Procedure Law, the defense is entitled to any and all information associated with the drafting and publication of the book.\u201d Rushdie and another man who was injured in the attack, Henry Reese, are both expected to testify in the upcoming trial, the DA\u2019s office previously told CNN. In a phone call with CNN last month, Barone expressed concern about the ability to seat an impartial jury. \u201cThe scene of the incident is literally just five minutes away, it\u2019s right down the road,\u201d he said, adding he plans to request a change of venue for the trial. Barone said federal officials have also been conducting a \u201cworldwide investigation\u201d into Matar, who is now 26, but there has not yet been a federal indictment. One of the world\u2019s most celebrated writers, Rushdie endured death threats after his 1988 novel \u201cThe Satanic Verses\u201d angered many Muslims, who considered it sacrilegious. The late Iranian leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini called for his death and Rushdie spent a decade under British protection. In the August 2022 attack, the author suffered three stab wounds to his neck, four to his stomach, puncture wounds to his right eye and chest, and a cut on his right thigh, Chautauqua County District Attorney Jason Schmidt has said. Rushdie was blinded in the eye and the attack also affected the use of one of his hands. Barone has previously said Matar \u201cmaintained his innocence on the matter.\u201d \u201cThe one thing I\u2019ve stressed throughout this is, everyone is entitled to their day in court, and there\u2019s the presumption of innocence that\u2019s the most important constitutional right that we can have, any one of us,\u201d Barone told CNN.

{"id": "2024_07_02_us_taylor-casey-missing-bahamas-mother", "text": "The mother of a Chicago woman who has been missing in the Bahamas for nearly two weeks is pleading with the US government to intervene in the case and help find her daughter. Forty-one-year-old\u00a0Taylor Casey\u00a0was last seen on June 19 around Paradise Island, a small resort enclave just off the shore of the island of New Providence, where she was attending a yoga retreat, according to the Royal Bahamas Police Force. Casey\u2019s mother, Colette\u00a0Seymore, returned to the United States after spending three days in the Bahamas meeting with US Embassy leadership, organizers of the Sivananda Ashram Yoga Retreat where Casey was reported missing and members of the Royal Bahamas Police Force. \u201cI had to return home without her. This is every mother\u2019s worst nightmare,\u201d Seymore said in a\u00a0news release\u00a0shared by a family representative. \u201cI felt an urgent need to return because without U.S. government support, we may never find out what happened to my Taylor.\u201d The family is now calling for the FBI to take over the investigation into Casey\u2019s disappearance. \u201cLet me make this clear to the U.S. media, the public, and our government officials: We are not satisfied with how this investigation has been handled thus far. And what we learned and observed during our time meeting with the authorities and Ashram leaders is disturbing and infuriating,\u201d Emily Williams, a friend of Casey who accompanied Seymore on the trip,\u00a0said\u00a0in the release. Casey\u2019s family and friends have spoken to FBI officials on the phone since returning, but those calls have not led to the agency\u00a0intervening\u00a0in the case, according to the release. A State Department spokesperson told CNN the department is aware of reports of a US citizen missing in Bahamas, but declined to comment on Casey\u2019s case specifically, citing privacy concerns. When a US citizen is missing, the department works with local authorities and communicates with families openly, the spokesperson said. When asked for comment, the FBI referred CNN to the Royal Bahamas Police Force. An \u2018unsettling\u2019 visit to the Sivananda Ashram Yoga Retreat The release also outlines what it calls Seymore\u2019s \u201cdeeply unsettling\u201d visit to the Sivananda Ashram Yoga Retreat on June 27, which left her team concerned for their own safety. The organizers of the retreat asked Bahamian police to investigate Casey\u2019s disappearance, according to a statement from the\u00a0Sivananda Ashram Yoga Retreat\u00a0obtained by CNN last week. The retreat learned of Casey\u2019s disappearance when she failed to attend morning classes\u00a0on June 20,\u00a0according to the statement. She was last seen late in the evening of June 19 and the \u201corganization has also advised the US Embassy as well as Taylor Casey\u2019s family,\u201d the statement said. When Seymore arrived at the retreat with her team, the scene appeared largely unprocessed by authorities, the release states.\u00a0Among Casey\u2019s belongings were a\u00a0Bible\u00a0and other books, a sketchpad with paintings, affirmation cards, clothes and toiletries. \u201cIt became apparent to us when we met with the Sivananda Ashram leaders that they were struggling to keep a linear and cohesive narrative regarding Taylor\u2019s disappearance,\u201d Williams said. Ram Soskin, the lead manager of the Sivananda Ashram Yoga Retreat, told Casey\u2019s family that on the Monday before her disappearance, an unidentified man with a walkie-talkie was seen walking the same platform where Casey\u2019s tent was, the release states. On the day Casey was last seen, one of the retreat participants was approached by a stranger while sitting alone at the beach, the participant told Seymore\u2019s team, according to the release. \u201cThe unidentified man was wearing a Celtics baseball cap and dressed in all black. He claimed he was from Chicago and was interested in taking a yoga class. He proceeded to follow her onto the property,\u201d the release states. Seymore said police advised her not to speak to guests at the retreat\u00a0and authorities noted\u00a0not all of them were aware of\u00a0Casey\u2019s disappearance. Seymore described the retreat as \u201ccultish,\u201d\u00a0and claimed\u00a0students\u00a0were\u00a0being \u201ccoerced to obey\u201d retreat leaders, \u201ceven if that meant holding back information about my child,\u201d according to the release. Staff met with Taylor\u2019s mother and friends once at police headquarters and once at the retreat, Jonathan Goldbloom, a representative for the ashram, told CNN in a statement. \u201cTo be clear, the police advised us that while we can encourage community members to speak with them, it must be their choice. So, we announced their presence to Taylor\u2019s classmates and teachers and invited anyone wanting to meet with them to come forward,\u201d Goldbloom said.\u00a0\u201cMany of our community members chose to speak with them and the ashram did not intervene in terms of what individuals said.\u00a0They were encouraged to speak freely.\u00a0Any perceived hesitancy could have been due to their own grieving processes.\u201d The retreat has been asking across multiple channels for people to come forward with information and providing guests with regular updates, Goldbloom said. \u201cAll of us are distraught over Taylor\u2019s disappearance, and our hearts go out to her family and friends,\u201d Goldbloom said. \u201cWhen Ms. Seymore\u2019s team observed the conditions and narrative control at the Ashram, they became concerned for their own safety and changed their flights to come home early,\u201d according to the release. Some retreat participants reached out to Seymore to say the retreat never told them about the investigation of Casey\u2019s disappearance, the release states, adding those\u00a0participants\u00a0left the retreat due to safety concerns. \u201cThe police requested Ashram Yoga Retreat participants to submit statements regarding Taylor, but would not specify whether any were interrogated,\u201d the release states. \u201cThe police also refused to inform the family\u2019s team how many statements they had collected and the names of those participants.\u201d Missing cell phone found Casey\u2019s cell phone was found in the water, authorities said, but it\u2019s unclear\u00a0how\u00a0far\u00a0it was from the yoga retreat. \u201cWe have conducted extensive investigation into the matter,\u201d Royal Bahamas Police Force Chief Superintendent Chrislyn Skippings said in a news conference last week. \u201cOur priority is to find Taylor and to find Taylor in good health.\u201d Police refused to give Casey\u2019s phone to Casey\u2019s mother, who said, \u201cI believe that phone may have information we need on there,\u201d the family\u2019s news release states. When asked for comment, the Royal Bahamas Police Force provided CNN with a news release, noting that Casey\u2019s cell phone and journal were found, but police have yet to find Casey\u2019s passport. Police have used drones, search-and-rescue dogs and divers in the investigation and are working with Casey\u2019s family, checking CCTV cameras and interviewing retreat attendees, Skippings said last week. Casey\u2019s family said the police told them they searched only the area between the Ashram Yoga Retreat and the nearby Atlantis\u00a0resort. CNN has reached out to the Atlantis\u00a0resort\u00a0for more information. \u201cWe were told that a description of Taylor was provided to the Atlantis security and that they were the ones who reviewed CCTV footage,\u201d Williams said in the release. \u201cWhat we took this to mean is that the detectives themselves did not review this footage.\u201d Retreat leaders and local police also failed to post missing person posters of Casey in the area, according to the release. A\u00a0missing person flyer\u00a0released by police did not provide details of the circumstances of her disappearance or say whether foul play is suspected.
