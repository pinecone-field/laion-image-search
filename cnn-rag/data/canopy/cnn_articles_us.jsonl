Bryan Maclean Howard, 41, faces eight charges of DUI manslaughter stemming from Tuesday\u2019s fatal crash, in which authorities said the 2001 Ford Ranger he was driving traveled toward the center line along Highway 40 west of Ocala and struck a bus carrying more than 50 farm workers. The bus left the roadway, went through a fence and overturned, according to the Florida Highway Patrol. In addition to the eight dead, at least 40 people were injured. Howard pleaded not guilty on Wednesday, online records show. He has been denied bond. CNN has reached out to the public defender\u2019s office for comment. The six\u00a0victims identified\u00a0in\u00a0the arrest\u00a0report were Evarado Ventura Hern\u00e1ndez, 30; Cristian Salazar Villeda, 24; Alfredo Tovar S\u00e1nchez, 20; Isa\u00edas Miranda Pascal, 21; Jos\u00e9 Heriberto Fraga Acosta, 27, and Manuel Perez R\u00edos, 46. Howard told authorities he\u00a0smoked\u00a0marijuana\u00a0oil\u00a0with a friend\u00a0the\u00a0night\u00a0before\u00a0the\u00a0crash, according to\u00a0the report, and also told police he took three prescribed medications\u00a0before\u00a0going to bed around 11:30 p.m. Citing Howard\u2019s involvement in a car accident \u201cat least three days prior\u201d to the bus crash, a state judge Wednesday also stipulated he is not allowed to operate a motor vehicle while the case is pending, nor may he consume or possess alcohol, a controlled substance or a drug without a prescription. Howard said he did not remember how\u00a0the\u00a0accident\u00a0happened and he was \u201cdriving very carefully\u201d because he was\u00a0involved\u00a0in\u00a0the car\u00a0accident days\u00a0before,\u00a0the\u00a0report says.

She listed\u00a0a litany of convictions, many stemming from driving-related infractions and all confirmed by state court records, including that Howard was: \u2022 Found guilty in 2019 of leaving the scene of an accident with property damage \u2022 Twice convicted \u2013 in 2013 and 2018 \u2013 of driving while his license was suspended, canceled or revoked \u2022 Convicted of grand theft in 2013 \u2022 Convicted of leaving the scene of an accident in 2006 CNN has reached out for comment to the public defender\u2019s office.

The first outage was reported by the department at 2:17 p.m. Just after 2:30 p.m., residents received a public safety alert message on their phones saying 911 services are down statewide and delays in public safety response may occur. \u201cCALL local Public Safety business line directly if you or others are having an emergency. More information will be provided when available,\u201d the alert read. \u201cThe current 911 system is down statewide, if you have an emergency and need assistance pull your nearest Fire Box, or call the Boston Fire Department at 617-343-2880. You can also get assistance by going to your nearest Firehouse,\u201d the post read. Police Commissioner and Boston Police Chief\u00a0Michael Cox\u00a0said earlier Tuesday that residents looking to contact officials while the 911 system was down could call local police departments for assistance, and pull the local red call box on streets and corners to alert fire/EMS.

{"id": "2024_06_18_us_lausd-cell-phone-ban-students", "text": "Students in the nation\u2019s second-largest school district will no longer be able to use cell phones during the school day after the Los Angeles Unified School District\u2019s board voted 5-2 in favor of the ban Tuesday. The move highlights a frustration shared by educators across the country. In the United States, 72% of high school teachers said cell phone distraction \u201cis a major problem in the classroom,\u201d according to a report last week by the Pew Research Center. The Los Angeles ban, which will take effect by the spring 2025 semester, goes beyond the school district\u2019s existing policy, which bans students from using cell phones during class instruction and limits social media use at school to \u201ceducational purposes.\u201d That policy took effect in 2011. Since then, smartphone use has exploded \u2013 both inside and outside the classroom. And students\u2019 addiction to their phones has hurt their socialization, their mental health and their academic success, board member\u00a0Nick Melvoin said. \u201cOur students are glued to their cell phones \u2013 not unlike adults,\u201d said Melvoin, a sponsor of the new ban. \u201cThey\u2019re surreptitiously scrolling in school, in class time. They have their head in their hands walking down the hallways. They\u2019re not talking to each other or playing at lunch or recess because they have their AirPods in.\u201d Research suggests \u201cexcessive cell phone use impacts adolescents mental health and well-being and is associated with increased stress, anxiety, depression, sleep issues, feelings of aggression, and suicidal thoughts,\u201d board members supporting the ban wrote. In addition, \u201cResearch indicates that limiting cell phone usage and social media access during the school day increases academic performance and has positive effects on student mental health,\u201d the proponents said. Questions remain before the ban takes effect\n                   But even board members who voted for the cell phone ban expressed concerns and the need for more answers. Among the concerns: how students would be able to communicate with parents in the event of an emergency, such as a mass shooting. \u201cI think in emergencies and with parent communication, this is definitely where a lot of parents have expressed their concerns to me,\u201d Melvoin said. \u201cI think it\u2019s such a tragic sign of the times, that that is what we initially think of. And we all need to do better in this country when it comes to gun violence prevention and keeping our students safe.\u201d The school board intends to seek input from students, parents, staff and experts on the best ways to implement the ban in all LAUSD schools by the spring semester of the 2024-25 school year. Board member\u00a0Rocio Rivas said \u201cthere are strong arguments on both sides\u201d of the debate. As a mother, Rivas said she was relieved to hear from her son after his school went on lockdown. As a board member who supported the cell phone ban, Rivas said the school district must find ways to make sure parents can be adequately informed in case of an emergency. Failing to notify parents could lead to unintended consequences, she said. \u201cIf there\u2019s an emergency \u2013 parents, if they cannot reach you on the phone \u2013 they\u2019re going to be right there at the school,\u201d Rivas said. And that could put \u201cthemselves in danger\u201d or create other problems. Board members also amended the proposed ban to consider the needs of students who are not fluent in English and might need access to a smartphone if that\u2019s the only way they can get adequate translations. Melvoin said the ban could be implemented in various ways. For example, some schools could ban students\u2019 cell phones from even entering the school, while other schools might require cell phones to be stored in lockers or magnetic pouches. \u201cThere will be differences between schools,\u201d LAUSD School Board President Jackie Goldberg said. \u201cBut the idea is very simple: If you bring your phone to school at all, you park it at the beginning,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019ll put it in a locker or a pouch \u2026 and you\u2019ll pick it up on your way home.\u201d The school board has 120 days to update the district\u2019s existing cell phone policy. After the policy has been updated, it will be presented to the public at a future board meeting, Melvoin\u2019s communication director Ally\u00a0Salvaria said. More states clamp down on students\u2019 cell phones at school California\u2019s state legislature passed a law in 2019 allowing \u2013 but not requiring \u2013 school districts to limit student smartphone use at school. A new bill making its way through the state legislature would require limiting or banning cell phone use by students in the public schools statewide by July 1, 2026, according to the most recent version of\u00a0the bill. Both of the California measures are referenced in the LAUSD proposal. Supporters of LAUSD\u2019s ban cited Oklahoma, Kansas, Vermont, Ohio, Louisiana and Pennsylvania as states that have introduced similar legislation. Board members also noted Florida has blocked access to social media on school district Wi-Fi. While the LAUSD vote happened at a regularly scheduled board meeting, it coincidently followed an topical essay by US Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy. The op-ed, published Monday in The New York Times, called for warning labels on social media apps based on what\u2019s known about the harm they pose to adolescents.

{"id": "2024_06_19_us_eji-enslaved-last-name-memorial-park-reaj", "text": "A new sculpture\u00a0park that memorializes African Americans\u2019 centuries-long fight for freedom \u2013 from slavery to modern day \u2013 has opened in Montgomery, Alabama,\u00a0the original capital of the Confederacy. The Freedom Monument Sculpture Park\u00a0honors the millions of people who were enslaved in the United States and their descendants\u2019\u00a0ongoing\u00a0fight for equality.\u00a0The 17-acre park features sculptures hewed\u00a0by a mix of world-renowned and emerging artists chosen by Bryan Stevenson, the Executive Director of the Equal Justice Initiative. Stevenson, 64, is an acclaimed Harvard educated lawyer, author and social justice activist. His work has led to \u201creversals, relief, or release\u00a0from prison for over\u00a0140 wrongly condemned prisoners on death\u00a0row,\u201d\u00a0according to the EJI. And in recent years he\u2019s\u00a0worked to memorialize the legacy of\u00a0enslaved people, Jim Crow\u00a0and racial injustice in America through\u00a0the EJI\u2019s\u00a0Legacy Sites in Montgomery. \u201cWe wanted to create a space that could talk honestly about the lives of enslaved people,\u201d Stevenson said of the sites. \u201cWe want to document it all.\u201d\u00a0 At the heart of the park is the National Monument to Freedom, a 43-foot-tall terracotta-colored wall that displays the more than 122,000\u00a0last\u00a0names\u00a0of the newly-freed Black Americans recorded in the 1870 US Census. That census was the first to list the\u00a0surnames of the formerly enslaved following the ratification of the Emancipation Proclamation\u00a0in 1865. \u201cA surname\u00a0reflects legacy,\u201d he said. \u201cIt reflects status.\u00a0 It reflects that you are someone capable of creating your own space in the world, leaving your own mark on the world, something that was denied to enslaved people.\u201d Stevenson says he designed the 155-foot-long wall to look like an open book. Before emancipation, enslaved people were recorded as\u00a0property.\u00a0In most cases, those records did not include\u00a0last\u00a0names; instead,\u00a0they included first\u00a0names and monikers given to enslaved people by their enslavers. When the formerly enslaved were legally permitted to choose their\u00a0last\u00a0names, only 40% chose the\u00a0last\u00a0names of their former enslavers - possibly to maintain familial connections, according to Stevenson. Others chose\u00a0names connected to historical figures, acquaintances, or people in their lives, according to researchers.\u00a0The most common\u00a0last\u00a0names chosen in the\u00a01870\u00a0census were \u2013 Johnson, Smith, Williams, Jones & Brown, according to EJI\u2019s analysis of Census records. A winding path leads visitors though a garden of artifacts.\u00a0Life-sized sculptures of a woman and children in a\u00a0cotton field\u00a0are paired with a sculpture of a chromed arm holding a police baton.\u00a0Stevenson says the park is designed to tell a continuous story, instead of detached installations.\u00a0He added the park is part of a \u201cpath to something better.\u201d \u201cWhat sculptors and artists have helped us do is to depict the brutality of slavery, but the humanity of the enslaved,\u201d\u00a0Stevenson said. The EJI\u2019s National Memorial for Peace and Justice opened in 2018.\u00a0It captures the brutality and the scale of lynchings throughout the American South.\u00a0More than 4,000\u00a0Black men, women and children were killed by\u00a0White mobs between 1877 and 1950. Most were in response to perceived infractions \u2013 walking behind a\u00a0White woman, attempting to quit a job, reporting a crime or organizing sharecroppers,\u00a0CNN previously reported. In 2021, the Legacy Museum\u00a0expanded and opened a new space to tell the story of racial injustice from enslavement to mass incarceration.\u00a0 Visitors can listen to first person accounts of both. \u201cI think to know that you are the heir of people who found a way to survive, who found a way to overcome all of the hardship who found a way \u2026. to love in the midst of all of this is something that, that should generate pride,\u201d Stevenson said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/19/us/eji-enslaved-last-name-memorial-park-reaj/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/21/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_19_media_disney-employee-lawsuit", "text": "Two employees are suing the Walt Disney Company, saying the company\u00a0moved their jobs from California to Florida, only for Disney to cancel the project and move them back, hurting them financially and emotionally. They\u2019re proposing a class action, alleging there are many others in a similar situation. In 2021, then-Disney CEO Bob Chapek announced a move of 2,000 positions from California\u00a0to Florida. But in May 2023, after CEO Bob Iger returned, the company\u00a0canceled the $1 billion Lake Nona office complex\u00a0amid a legal and political battle with Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis that has\u00a0since been settled. The plaintiffs, Maria De La Cruz and George Fong, both work for Disney\u2019s product design division. De La Cruz is vice president of product design, and Fong is a creative director, according to the complaint filed by\u00a0Lohr Ripamonti LLP on Tuesday. The lawsuit, which seeks an unspecified amount in damages, has not yet been processed by the Superior Court of Los Angeles. The complaint alleges that Disney misrepresented and concealed\u00a0its\u00a0true plans for the Lake Nona project,\u00a0hurting\u00a0\u2013 financially\u00a0and otherwise \u2013 at least\u00a0250 employees who had made the move from California to Florida. The complaint states employees were informed about the project to relocate 2,000 roles\u00a0to Florida in July of 2021 and that Disney \u201cmade it clear that employees who declined relocation would lose their jobs.\u201d The complaint\u00a0described\u00a0how De La Cruz and Fong sold their homes in Southern California and purchased homes in Central Florida. For Fong, that meant selling\u00a0the\u00a0childhood home that he inherited from his family. After the Lake Nona office project was canceled, De La Cruz\u00a0emailed human\u00a0resources about the future for those who might choose to stay in Florida,\u00a0writing: \u201cAfter all of this, will there be any security in our positions? My fear would be that we decide to stay in Florida, only to be laid off in the next year or so. I don\u2019t want to be punished for being put into a situation my company put me in,\u201d\u00a0the complaint says. The complaint says\u00a0De La Cruz and Fong decided\u00a0to move back to California to keep their jobs, but housing prices in the Lake Nona vicinity had dropped significantly after Disney\u2019s announcement. Fong\u00a0said\u00a0he\u00a0had trouble selling his Florida home, and when he managed to move back to California, mortgage rates and home prices had climbed so rapidly that he was only able to afford a smaller home than he previously had. \u201cMs. De La Cruz, Mr. Fong\u00a0and many others dutifully moved to Florida because they love their jobs, they love the people they work with, and they love Disney,\u201d Attorney Jason Lohr said. Disney has not replied to a request for comment. The company developing land in Lake Nona has confirmed with CNN that Disney still owns the 60 acres it had purchased for the new corporate campus. Disney has not said what will happen to this property.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/19/media/disney-employee-lawsuit/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/21/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_18_us_club-q-shooter-hate-crime-sentencing", "text": "The shooter who opened fire in a Colorado LGBTQ+ nightclub in 2022, killing five people and injuring 19, was sentenced in federal court Tuesday to life in prison without the possibility of parole plus 190 years. The sentence came after Anderson Lee Aldrich pleaded guilty to 74 federal hate crime charges and gun charges in connection with the shooting. Prosecutors chose not to pursue the death penalty in the case, and the US Department of Justice announced in January it had reached a plea agreement with Aldrich. US District Judge Charlotte Sweeney handed down the sentence after hearing from the victims\u2019 families and survivors of the shooting, many of whom were disappointed Aldrich would not face a capital sentence. \u201cFueled by hate, the defendant targeted members of the LGBTQIA+ community at a place that represented belonging, safety, and acceptance \u2013 stealing five people from their loved ones, injuring 19 others, and striking fear across the country,\u201d said Attorney General Merrick B. Garland in a statement after the sentencing. Sweeney, the first LGBTQ+ federal judge to serve in Colorado, did not have the discretion to impose a different sentence, she told them, citing the plea agreement. But she emphasized the importance of Aldrich\u2019s decision to plead guilty: In doing so, she said, Aldrich admitted to carrying out the attack because of the victims\u2019 \u201cactual or perceived gender identity or sexual orientation.\u201d \u201cThis community is stronger than your armor, stronger than your weapons and stronger than your hatred,\u201d she told Aldrich, noting she was sentencing him during Pride Month. Aldrich, 24, is already serving five consecutive life terms and an additional 2,212 years without the possibility of parole at the Wyoming State Penitentiary after pleading guilty in 2023 to state charges for the attack, which targeted one of the few LGBTQ+ spaces in Colorado Springs, fostering a safe and inclusive atmosphere in a conservative community. \u201cI loved that place,\u201d Ashtin Gamblin, who was shot nine times and survived, said during her victim impact statement prior to sentencing. While she is not a member of the LGBTQ+ community, Gamblin said, she is an ally. \u201cI loved everybody there,\u201d she said, crediting Club Q\u2019s bar supervisor, Daniel Aston, with saving her life before he was killed. Aside from Aston, Derrick Rump, another Club Q employee, was also killed, as well as Ashley Paugh, Kelly Loving and Raymond Green Vance. Many of those who testified Tuesday expressed anger for the shooter, and the pain Aldrich caused them or their families. Aldrich \u2013 who appeared in court in an orange prison uniform \u2013 was largely expressionless, or nodded while listening to the statements. \u201cYou took my only sibling,\u201d said Stephanie Clark, Paugh\u2019s sister, who also testified at Aldrich\u2019s state sentencing. \u201cBut I wanted to look you in the eye one more time and tell you I will never forgive you, nor will my family,\u201d Clark said. \u201cYou don\u2019t deserve that.\u201d Wyatt Kent, who performed as a drag queen the night of the shooting, said it was difficult to prepare this statement during Pride Month, but pointed to the resilience of the LGBTQ+ community. \u201cI forgive you,\u201d Kent said. \u201cWe, the queer community, we are the resilient ones. We continue to hold that beauty within each other. We continue to find joy in the trauma and in the pain.\u201d \u201cUnfortunately,\u201d Kent said, \u201cthose are things you will never experience for the rest of your life.\u201d A \u2018brazen and calculated\u2019 attack In a sentencing statement submitted to the court prior to Tuesday\u2019s hearing, the Justice Department called the shooting a \u201cbrazen and calculated\u201d attack on the club\u2019s employees and patrons, describing it as a \u201cbias-motivated, premeditated, mass-casualty attack.\u201d Aldrich began the massacre at the club as patrons were gathering for Transgender Day of Remembrance, for which Club Q had scheduled a weekend of events, including a drag show. The shooter spent more than $9,000 buying weapons and visited the club several times before, becoming familiar with the layout, according to the sentencing document. Aldrich had expressed an open hatred for the LGBTQ+ community and had indicated an interest in mass shootings before, the document said. Then, in the late hours of November 19, 2022, the then-22-year-old entered the club carrying an AR-15 style assault rifle and began \u201cfiring at everyone in sight,\u201d according to the sentencing document. Some patrons hid or played dead as Aldrich moved though the club, shooting indiscriminately. The violence came to an end when an army veteran took down the shooter, aided by a Navy petty officer and a drag performer at the club. The shooting provided an echo of the devastating 2016 shooting at Pulse, an LGBTQ+ nightclub in Orlando, Florida, which left 49 people dead. Several victims who were shot but survived have required surgery for their injuries and continue to face medical challenges, including loss of mobility and post-traumatic stress disorder.

{"id": "2024_06_20_politics_debate-biden-trump-preparations-president", "text": "One is secluding himself at a mountainside retreat with a tight circle of advisers, poring over briefing binders, honing attack lines and bracing for personal smears. The other is workshopping responses and retorts with vice presidential hopefuls, sharpening policy lines while working to rein in his bombastic rhetoric. In some ways, aides to President Joe Biden and former President Donald\u00a0Trump describe similar goals heading into next Thursday\u2019s presidential debate: painting their opponent as presiding over disorder and wholly unfit for office. For two men who have been circling each other rhetorically for the past four years, the debate hosted by CNN\u00a0in Atlanta amounts to a moment of\u00a0high consequence. Both candidates are aware of the stakes, officials in both campaigns say, as they huddle with their teams to prepare attacks, form rebuttals and frame the\u00a0choice\u00a0of November\u2019s election. Both teams have spent the past weeks working to fine-tune their message on a wide array of issues, from the economy to foreign affairs to their rival\u2019s fitness for office. And each has found themselves distracted in some way: Trump by the criminal trial that consumed his spring\u00a0and Biden by a stretch of intensive overseas travel and a painful legal saga for his family. Yet the similarities mostly end there. How each man is preparing for the debate is ultimately a microcosm of their differences as candidates, and each will enter the CNN studio with divergent objectives. In prep sessions that have already started, Biden has been focused on ways to hold Trump accountable on the debate stage \u2013 mirroring the broader political strategy that his White House and campaign have been deploying for months. \u201cThe president has gotten increasingly punchier in recent remarks about Trump and plans to carry that theme through to the\u00a0debate,\u201d one Biden campaign official said. After months of suggesting that the American electorate was tuned out of the 2024 race, the Biden camp sees the debate as a starting block of sorts, and a chance to present its study of candidate contrasts in front of a new and engaged audience. Trump, meanwhile, is aiming to assure voters he can be a steadier and more effective leader than his successor, despite the legal issues swirling around him and a deeply divisive approach to politics. Some of his debate prep has focused less on policy, but on rhetoric. Trump has previously struggled with policy debates, instead preferring to meander and generalize \u2013\u00a0especially without a teleprompter. He\u2019s also been quick to show aggression in past debates, including speaking over his opponents and attacking the moderators, moves that stuck with viewers in the months that followed. \u201cI\u2019ll probably be negotiating with three people, but that\u2019s OK.\u00a0I\u2019ve done that before,\u201d Trump told his supporters Tuesday\u00a0at a rally in Racine, Wisconsin, referring to Biden and CNN\u2019s moderators. \u201cI\u2019ll be debating three people instead of one, instead of one half of a person.\u201d Debate camp To get ready, Biden is gathering trusted aides this week and next at Camp David, the mountainside presidential retreat, for several days of intensive discussion and preparation. The secluded complex of rustic lodges in Maryland has, in the past, helped focus Biden and his team ahead of important moments such as State of the Union speeches. The preparations are expected to progress over a series of days, evolving from informal discussions about topics, questions\u00a0and potential responses and culminating in more formal 90-minute mock debates.\u00a0The president will likely be fueled by his favorite drink of orange\u00a0Gatorade.\u00a0(CNN debate rules stipulate that each candidate will have a pen, writing pad and a bottle\u00a0of\u00a0water at the podium.) The White House is preserving the possibility that the president\u00a0and his team could travel to Atlanta directly from Camp David, depending on how much practice remains. Aides have been compiling binders of questions \u2013 with possible answers to each of them \u2013 on a wide range of topics for the president to peruse. Four years ago, Biden is said to have offered detailed feedback on every anticipated topic, sometimes rejecting certain suggestions altogether. At other points, he pushed aides to home in deeper on one subject matter or frame a response in a different way. Biden\u2019s former chief of staff, Ron Klain, is taking the lead to help the president get ready to debate Trump, a Biden campaign official told CNN. Beyond knowing and working for Biden for decades, Klain is the party\u2019s most seasoned debate coach, having worked with Democratic candidates in nearly every presidential race over the past three decades. Bruce Reed, another longtime aide who currently serves as Biden\u2019s deputy chief of staff, has been charged with sifting through reams of material and hours of prior Trump appearances to inform the practice sessions. Earlier this year, Reed led the process to compile the policy substance and rhetorical flair that became Biden\u2019s hourlong State of the Union address. Biden\u2019s personal lawyer, Bob Bauer, is likely to reprise his role as a stand-in for Trump in mock debate sessions, two sources said. Bauer, once a top attorney for Barack Obama\u2019s presidential campaigns and administration, wrote in a new book that he emulated his \u201cTrump-worst\u201d to help Biden anticipate his opponent\u2019s antics and attacks in 2020. While the president sees the team\u2019s deep knowledge of him as a candidate and its record as an asset, one adviser says there may also be a bit of superstition at play. \u201cHe won with that team four years ago, so he\u2019s going to stick with them now,\u201d a Biden adviser said. Other close senior advisers to the president, including chief of staff Jeff Zients and senior White House advisers Anita Dunn, Mike Donilon and Cedric Richmond\u00a0are also involved in preparations. The Biden team has long argued that once voters begin paying attention to the race, they will see the choice as the study in contrasts the president has promoted endlessly, but which has failed to move the needle in polling. With tens of millions of Americans expected to watch the debate \u2013 aides point to recent polling that shows most likely voters plan to tune in \u2013 that theory will be tested. The\u00a0Biden camp plans to lean heavily on prior Trump comments that \u2013 while widely covered by the political media \u2013 may not have registered on the radars of the average voter, according to sources involved in the discussions. Klain, according to a confidante, has quipped that preparing to debate Trump should be straightforward because \u201che only ever says eight things,\u201d referring to the former president\u2019s tendency to hash out familiar grievances on social media. While the list of those Trumpisms \u2013 and rebukes \u2013 is still being tailored, there\u2019s one that is sure to come up, according to one source involved: Trump\u2019s December 2023 suggestion that he would not rule like a dictator \u201cother than Day One.\u201d \u2018Policy sessions\u2019 Trump, meanwhile, has deployed the help of some of his top contenders for vice president, as well as senators, policy experts and outside allies,\u00a0to help brief him ahead of next week\u2019s debate. In recent weeks, Trump has participated in roughly a dozen of these private meetings, dubbed as informal \u201cpolicy discussions\u201d by his campaign, sources familiar with the sessions told CNN. The subjects of the meetings have ranged from sharpening his messaging on the economy, the border and crime, to his views on abortion, the wars in the Middle East and Ukraine and how to best frame his May 30 conviction on 34 counts of business fraud, the sources said. Earlier this month, Trump huddled with Ohio Sen. JD Vance and members of the former president\u2019s staff at Mar-a-Lago for one such briefing, according to two sources with direct knowledge of the meeting. The informal session focused on messaging around the economy, including how to best hammer Biden on inflation \u2013\u00a0an issue Trump\u2019s campaign argues is the top concern for voters this fall. Trump engaged in a similar policy discussion with Sens. Marco Rubio of Florida and Eric Schmitt of Missouri at the Republican National Committee headquarters in Washington, DC, last week, following his meeting with House and Senate Republicans on Capitol Hill, CNN previously reported. Among the topics discussed were democracy and how to respond to the inevitable questions regarding the January 6, 2021, attack\u00a0on the US Capitol, including Trump\u2019s response to the riot incited by his supporters that day. Trump\u2019s\u00a0co-campaign managers,\u00a0Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita,\u00a0also attended the meeting and offered advice on how to most effectively address the issue. Other meetings have taken place with senior advisers Kellyanne Conway and Stephen Miller, as well as his former acting Director\u00a0of National Intelligence Richard\u00a0Grenell. Mock debates None of Trump\u2019s sessions so far have included mock debates or role-playing, sources said, something the Trump campaign currently has no plans for the former president to engage in \u2013\u00a0a departure from 2020 when Trump faced off behind closed\u00a0doors with former New Jersey Gov.\u00a0Chris Christie standing in for Biden. On the Biden side, casting for a Trump stand-in this year remains open, with an expectation that Biden\u2019s personal lawyer, Bauer \u2013 who stood in for Trump four years ago \u2013 could easily reprise his role. \u201cWe set aside special sessions during which I was expected to be at my Trump-worst\u00a0\u2013 as personally insulting and unhinged as Trump can be,\u201d Bauer recalled\u00a0in his book released this week, describing his practice of \u201clying and blustering and bullying my way through the mock sessions.\u201d In fact, trying to prepare for a wide range of unpredictable scenarios that Biden might be confronted with when standing a handful of yards away from Trump was one of the most important goals of the mock debates in the fall of 2020, according to those who were in the room. Those scenarios included everything from long-winded answers to the possibility of Trump hurling personal insults. In the last cycle, Biden aides were particularly sensitive to Trump attacking members of Biden\u2019s family on the debate stage. \u201cPart of the aim of the prep process was to really acclimate Biden to the idea that Trump was potentially going to say really horrible things about his own family, his kids, so that Biden would be prepared and would not feel caught off guard by Trump\u2019s style,\u201d former White House communications director Kate Bedingfield said. Biden\u2019s son, Hunter, was recently convicted on three felony gun charges \u2013 a development that the president and his aides are certain to be bracing for as a potential attack line. Expectations game Trump\u2019s advisers, who are wary of using the words \u201cdebate prep\u201d when it comes to the former president,\u00a0have consistently downplayed the notion that he requires the type of preparation that other candidates \u2013\u00a0and specifically, Biden \u2013\u00a0need for such a high-stakes debate. Instead, they have pointed to Trump\u2019s rallies and media interviews as examples of how Trump is gearing up to take Biden on, including taking questions from friendly audience members at recent events. \u201cPresident Trump takes on numerous tough interviews every single week and delivers lengthy rally speeches while standing, demonstrating elite stamina,\u201d senior Trump adviser Jason Miller, who is running point on Trump\u2019s efforts in advance of the debate, said in a statement. Ahead of the Atlanta debate, Trump plans to hold a campaign rally in Philadelphia, a city Biden has already visited several times this year as he works to replicate his 2020 victory in Pennsylvania. The former president\u2019s allies and advisers point out that Trump has not only appeared on several presidential debate stages over the past\u00a0decade, but he has also debated Biden before \u2013 a key reason, they say,\u00a0for the less conventional approach to the preparations. But while the Trump campaign\u2019s version of debate prep is unlike the traditional planning most past candidates \u2013\u00a0and even Trump himself \u2013\u00a0have engaged in, people close to the former president told CNN his team acknowledges there is still work to do before he takes the stage in Atlanta. \u201cThere\u2019s no question the debate will show Trump is the stronger candidate and the better choice, especially when you see the stark contrast with Biden, physically, mentally and so on. But that doesn\u2019t mean Trump shouldn\u2019t, or isn\u2019t preparing,\u201d said a person close to Trump, who requested anonymity to speak candidly. \u201cHe isn\u2019t going into this without doing his homework,\u201d the person added.

{"id": "2024_06_20_us_shenandoah-hikers-killings-solved", "text": "Almost 30 years after the brutal killings of two women in Virginia\u2019s Shenandoah National Park, the FBI says it now knows who was responsible. DNA evidence and a methodical case review helped identify a suspect in the killings, the FBI\u2019s Richmond Field Office said in a news release Thursday. Laura \u201cLollie\u201d Winans, 26, and Julianne \u201cJulie\u201d Williams, 24, were killed at their campsite near the Skyland Resort on May 24, 1996, according to the release. Family members called the National Park Service when the women did not return home. Their bodies were found about a week later after \u201can extensive search\u201d by National Park Service rangers. After all these years, DNA evidence positively matched Walter \u201cLeo\u201d Jackson Sr., a convicted serial rapist from Cleveland, Ohio, the news release said. \u201cEven though we had this DNA match, we took additional steps and compared evidence from Lollie and Julie\u2019s murders directly to a buccal swab containing Jackson\u2019s DNA. Those results confirmed we had the right man and finally could tell the victim\u2019s families we know who is responsible for this heinous crime,\u201d\u00a0FBI Richmond Special Agent in Charge Stanley Meador said in the news release. The case picked up momentum in 2021 when a new FBI Richmond investigative team conducted a methodical review of the case, taking another look at hundreds of leads and interviews, according to the release. Evidence from the crime scene was sent to a private lab, which successfully pulled DNA from some of the items. Jackson, the man whose DNA matched, had a criminal history \u201cincluding kidnapping, rapes, and assaults,\u201d the release said. He died in prison in March 2018 in Cuyahoga County, Ohio, authorities said. Jackson was a residential painter and an avid hiker who was known to visit Shenandoah National Park. But decades ago, in 2002, a different man was at the center of the case. A federal grand jury in April 2002 indicted Darryl David Rice, a Maryland man incarcerated for other crimes, on charges of capital murder and a hate crime in their slayings. At that point, it was nearly six years after the women\u2019s bodies were found with their throats slashed. Rice, who appears to still be alive, was released from prison in 2011 after some probation violations, according to public and court records. However, the US Attorney\u2019s office made it clear in a public filing 22 years ago that the forensic evidence did not implicate Rice and the DNA materials located on crime scene evidence excluded him, US Attorney for the Western District of Virginia Christopher Kavanaugh said Thursday at the news conference. \u201cIt was in a retesting of the crime scene evidence that developed a profile that was uploaded into the national database that led us to Walter Leo Jackson Sr., ultimately resulting in a finding that there was a one out of 2.6 trillion chance that had originated from someone other than Walter Leo Jackson, Sr.,\u201d Kavanaugh said. \u201cI prosecuted many homicides and cold cases and I have never witnessed statistics that high.\u201d Winans and Williams were members of the LGBTQIA+ community, Kavanaugh said, and although their murders were originally believed to be hate crimes, he has found no evidence of that. The case was eventually dismissed due to the lack of forensic evidence. \u201cMake no mistake, this crime was brutal. This crime was definitionally hateful,\u201d Kavanaugh said. \u201cNevertheless, we do not have any evidence that the victims were selected for or that Jackson had any knowledge of or was otherwise motivated by their membership in a protected class. And if the evidence showed otherwise, I would say it,\u201d he said. Kavanaugh was confident in the strength of the evidence and if the suspect were alive, he\u2019d act on the new information, he said. The families of the victims were not at the news conference. \u201cI want to again extend my condolences to the Winans and Williams families and hope today\u2019s announcement provides some small measure of solace,\u201d Kavanaugh said in a news release.

{"id": "2024_06_18_us_justin-harris-georgia-hot-car-prison-release", "text": "Justin Ross Harris, a Georgia father whose murder\u00a0conviction\u00a0for the hot-car death of his 22-month-old son was\u00a0overturned\u00a0by the state\u2019s Supreme Court in 2022, has been released from prison, according to prison records. Harris was released from Macon State Prison on Father\u2019s Day \u2013 nearly 10 years to the day since his son, Cooper, died after his father left him strapped inside a car for seven hours on a hot day while he went to work \u2013 according to the Georgia Department of Corrections website. The father was convicted of Cooper\u2019s murder in 2016 after prosecutors convinced a jury Harris killed his son to escape the burdens of his marriage and fatherhood. But the life sentence was overturned in 2022 by the Georgia Supreme Court, which ruled 6-3 that evidence submitted by prosecutors of Harris\u2019 extramarital relationships \u2013 which the state had portrayed as the motivation behind his alleged decision to kill his son \u2013 had an unfair prejudicial impact on the jury. Though the murder charges were nullified, the court left in place three other counts relating to his electronic exchanges of lewd material\u00a0with an underage girl. Harris was sentenced to a total of 12 years on those three charges: 10 years for one count of attempt to commit sexual exploitation of a child, and one year each for two counts of dissemination of harmful material to a minor, according to the ruling. Prison records state his maximum release date as June 18, 2024, on the sexual exploitation charge and marks his confinement status as \u201cinactive.\u201d After his release from prison Sunday, he was transferred to the Cobb County Adult Detention Center to serve the two additional years on the other charges, according to the Office of the Cobb County District Attorney. Cooper\u2019s death and his father\u2019s trial captivated the nation, in part because hot-car death cases rarely lead to murder charges against grieving parents who insist leaving their child in a hot car was nothing more than a tragic accident. After prosecutors announced last year they would not retry the murder case against Harris, his attorney said Harris was relieved and \u201cthankful that today\u2019s dismissal may begin to restore Cooper\u2019s legacy as a child much loved by his parents.\u201d \u201cRoss has always accepted the moral responsibility for Cooper\u2019s death. But after all these years of investigation and review, this dismissal of charges confirms that Cooper\u2019s death was unintentional and therefore not a crime,\u201d attorney Carlos Rodriguez said in May 2023. \u201cThroughout the course of representing Ross, we have learned that these tragic accidents often happen while the child is in the care of a loving parent. Ross was no different,\u201d Rodriguez said. Cooper\u2019s mother, Leanna Taylor, has stood by her belief that Harris did not intend to kill their child that sweltering day. She said after the Georgia Supreme Court ruling that she hoped it would change how their son is remembered. \u201cThat he was wanted, that he was loved and that he is missed every single day,\u201d she said in a statement released by her attorney. While the trial revealed that on the day their son died, Harris exchanged sexual messages and photos with five women and a 16-year-old minor, Taylor maintained that Harris remained a loving father despite failing their marriage. The couple has since divorced. \u201cRoss was a loving and proud father to Cooper. At the same time Ross was being a terrible husband. These two things can and did exist at the same time.\u201d CNN\u2019s Ray Sanchez contributed to this report. Clarification: After Justin Ross Harris was released from prison, he was transferred to the Cobb County Adult Detention Center to serve his remaining two years for the dissemination of harmful material to a minor.

{"id": "2024_06_20_tech_tiktok-court-filing-biden-administration", "text": "TikTok ramped up its attacks on the Biden administration Thursday over a law that could ban the popular app from the United States, arguing in a court filing that US TikTok users could be forced to live on an \u201cisland\u201d of content disconnected from the rest of the world if the platform is forced to find a new owner. The legal filing also publicizes, for the first time, the text of a draft agreement between TikTok and the US government that the company claims would have addressed national security concerns linked to the app but that was allegedly discarded in favor of legislation that TikTok argues violates the First Amendment. Thursday\u2019s filing marks TikTok\u2019s opening salvo in a pivotal case that could not only determine the fate of an app used by 170 million Americans but also how courts interpret the First Amendment and its relationship to all online speech. The Justice Department declined to comment. TikTok has insisted it is not possible for its Chinese parent ByteDance to divest from the app \u2013 \u201cnot possible technologically, commercially, or legally\u201d \u2013 and not by the January 2025 deadline laid out by the law that President Joe Biden signed in April. \u201cEven if divestiture were feasible, TikTok in the United States would still be reduced to a shell of its former self, stripped of the innovative and expressive technology that tailors content to each user,\u201d the company wrote in its brief. \u201cIt also would become an island, preventing Americans from exchanging views with the global TikTok community.\u201d That is because the law TikTok is challenging prohibits the type of data-sharing agreements that would be necessary to display international TikTok content to US TikTok users, the company claimed in its filing. That dire warning echoed claims in a related legal brief filed by TikTok content creators Thursday. The group of creators, which includes a football coach, a sexual assault survivor advocate and a US Air Force veteran, argued that the challenged law would prevent them from choosing where and how to express themselves, as well as their First Amendment right to receive others\u2019 speech. Meanwhile, TikTok\u2019s focus on the draft agreement with the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), a multi-agency panel charged with reviewing the national security implications of foreign investment deals, could prove central to the company\u2019s case. The proposed deal\u2019s existence, TikTok said, is evidence of a lighter-touch option that could have achieved the government\u2019s goals without a potential divestiture or app ban. Whether the Biden administration overlooked a less restrictive alternative could become a factor in a potential test of the law\u2019s constitutionality. In Thursday\u2019s filing, TikTok said the agreement was never signed despite years of negotiations and dozens of meetings and phone calls with US government officials. And after months of radio silence beginning in September 2022, CFIUS allegedly told TikTok in March 2023 that \u201c\u2018senior government officials\u2019 demanded divestment without explaining why the Agreement was insufficient.\u201d TikTok added that it then requested meetings with senior US officials but \u201creceived no meaningful responses.\u201d For years, US officials have warned of the possibility that the Chinese government could gain access to TikTok\u2019s user data through its influence over ByteDance. The Trump administration tried to ban TikTok by executive action, but that was quickly stymied by legal challenges. As Biden signed April\u2019s legislation, Trump reversed himself, saying a ban would only help TikTok\u2019s rival, Meta. Independent cybersecurity experts say the potential exists based on how China\u2019s laws are written, but that it so far remains a hypothetical and that there are many other sources of sensitive data China can freely obtain, for example by buying it on the open market. US officials have not publicly presented evidence that China has accessed US users\u2019 TikTok data. But they warn that information could be used to target propaganda or to identify intelligence targets, and they have given members of Congress classified briefings about the app\u2019s potential risks. TikTok, for its part, has denied ever giving the Chinese government access to its data and has blasted the confidential congressional briefings as part of a flawed, rushed and secretive legislative process. Attached to the company\u2019s brief on Thursday was an appendix containing the entire 103-page draft agreement. Outlining what has come to be known as Project Texas, TikTok\u2019s plan for segregating US user data from its global operation, the draft document also shows a provision that would entitle the US government to temporarily stop or even shut down TikTok\u2019s app if TikTok fails to comply with any of a dozen requirements, such as allowing qualified inspectors to review the company\u2019s source code. On Thursday, TikTok\u2019s filing said the company has so far spent $2 billion voluntarily implementing Project Texas. Also included with TikTok\u2019s detailed filing was a signed declaration from a third-party expert and former CFIUS official, Christopher Simkins, who said the proposal as written was as robust as any they had seen in two decades of experience. If implemented, Simkins said,\u00a0TikTok\u2019s national security risks \u201cwould be reduced to a LOW level.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/20/tech/tiktok-court-filing-biden-administration/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/21/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_20_us_columbia-university-protesters-trespass-dismissed", "text": "A New York judge on Thursday dismissed trespassing cases against 30 individuals who were among the\u00a0dozens arrested\u00a0inside Columbia University\u2019s Hamilton Hall during a pro-Palestinian protest in April, with prosecutors citing a lack of evidence. Of the 46 initially arrested, 15 defendants still face charges, the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office said. Dozens of pro-Palestinian protesters were accused of unlawfully entering the university\u2019s Hamilton Hall on April 30 and barricading themselves inside before the university asked for assistance from the New York Police Department. After being removed from the building, many were charged with criminal trespass in the third degree, a class B misdemeanor. Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg said at the time he intended to look at each case and make decisions based on facts and the law. In the past, the Manhattan DA\u2019s office has declined to prosecute or deferred prosecution cases where large numbers of people were arrested as part of civil disobedience. During Thursday\u2019s court hearing, Judge Kevin McGrath dismissed 30 cases of trespass against those who have no criminal history. One other defendant previously had their case dismissed, for a total of 31 individuals no longer facing charges. \u201cAt the time of the charged conduct, the defendants were either staff employed by, or students enrolled in, Columbia University, and are now subject to student or staff disciplinary proceedings,\u201d according to the Manhattan DA\u2019s news release. In calling for the dismissal of charges Thursday, Assistant District Attorney Stephen Millan cited what he called \u201cextremely limited video,\u201d adding that \u201cthe security cameras were immediately covered by certain defendants,\u201d who prosecutors have been unable to identify. The available video evidence \u201cfails to establish or prove\u201d the 31 people participated in damaging university property or causing harm to anyone, making it difficult for prosecutors to prove anything other than trespassing at trial, the DA\u2019s office said. Columbia University on Thursday declined to comment on the court proceedings when contacted by CNN. Protesters \u2018unanimously\u2019 reject deals Fourteen of the defendants still facing charges \u2013 12 of whom were neither staff nor students at Columbia \u2013 have been offered Adjournments in Contemplation of Dismissal (ACD), the Manhattan DA\u2019s office said. An ACD allows a court to defer a defendant\u2019s case \u2013 with the potential that the defendant\u2019s charge will be dismissed \u2013 if the defendant does not engage in additional criminal conduct. But those defendants have refused the offer, they said at a news conference held outside the courtroom after Thursday\u2019s hearing, speaking to demonstrators wearing keffiyehs, a traditional Palestinian scarf. \u201cWe stand here today united by our action and the Palestinian cause,\u201d one of the protesters said. \u201cThe state has attempted, once again, to divide us \u2013 dismissing some of our cases and offering others deals in accordance with their outside agitator narrative,\u201d adding they reject the division they say is intended to \u201cpreserve the sanctity of Columbia University, not an institution in the city of New York but always above and apart from it.\u201d \u201cAll of us who took part in the liberation of Hind\u2019s Hall were driven by the same necessity to escalate, to escalate for Gaza, to resist the savage genocide of our siblings in Palestine,\u201d the protester continued, referring to Hamilton Hall by another name bestowed on it by protesters. \u201cWe exercised our shared right to oppose the US war machine by putting our bodies upon the years of Columbia, one of its most well-oiled domestic components.\u201d The protester said the defendants unanimously rejected deals to present a \u201cunited front against state repression.\u201d The 14 defendants are scheduled to appear back in court on July 25. \u201cThe only allegation that\u2019s different is they weren\u2019t currently enrolled as a student or weren\u2019t employed by the university,\u201d said public defender Matthew Daloisio, who is representing 43 defendants. Daloisio argued those defendants experienced the same police raid and got the same injuries as anyone else during the NYPD raid. A 15th defendant, James Carlson, 40, was arrested on burglary charges at Columbia University, is facing a charge of criminal trespass in the third degree from the Manhattan DA, according to court records. He is also facing an arson charge from a separate incident. He\u2019s pleaded not guilty in both cases, court records show. On Thursday, Carlson went before the judge, where the prosecutor recounted how he is being accused of involvement in the Hamilton Hall protest. Carlson is accused of damaging a NYPD camera and being involved in burning an Israeli flag. When the prosecutor described the flag burning in court, some supporters in the courtroom snickered, prompting the court officer to reprimand them, telling them to be quiet. The district attorney said there are ongoing school disciplinary proceedings for the students who had their case dismissed.

{"id": "2023_06_19_us_juneteenth-federal-holiday-explained-cec", "text": "Despite Juneteenth\u2019s storied history, the holiday was largely overlooked by non-Black Americans until recent years. The momentum of the\u00a0Black Lives Matter\u00a0movement propelled Juneteenth into the national spotlight, building on a decades-long push by activists and leaders to get recognition for the landmark occasion. In 2021, Juneteenth became the\u00a0latest federal holiday\u00a0in the US \u2014 the\u00a0first to be approved\u00a0since Martin Luther King Jr. Day in 1983. With Juneteenth now a national holiday, many public and private sector employees enjoy an extra day off from work while brands and corporations capitalize on the event with celebratory marketing campaigns. But there\u2019s much more to Juneteenth than a long weekend and\u00a0branded products. As Black Americans continue to face the same challenges and inequities that inspired so many to take to the streets in 2020, it\u2019s worth reflecting on the history behind the holiday. Juneteenth marks the end of slavery Juneteenth \u2013 also known as Juneteenth Independence Day, Freedom Day and Emancipation Day \u2013 commemorates the end of slavery in the United States. A blend of the words June and nineteenth, it marks June 19, 1865: the day that Union Army Maj. Gen. Gordon Granger rode into Galveston, Texas, and issued\u00a0General Order No. 3,\u00a0proclaiming that the enslaved African Americans there were free. \u201cThe people of Texas are informed that, in accordance with a proclamation from the Executive of the United States, all slaves are free,\u201d the order read. \u201cThis involves an absolute equality of personal rights and rights of property between former masters and slaves, and the connection heretofore existing between them becomes that between employer and hired labor.\u201d Freedom for the enslaved people of Galveston, Texas, came two-and-a-half years after President Abraham Lincoln issued the\u00a0Emancipation Proclamation, which couldn\u2019t be enforced in areas under Confederate control. It also came about two months after Confederate General Robert E. Lee surrendered to the Union Army at Appomattox Court House, Virginia \u2014 an event generally considered to be the end of the Civil War. How Juneteenth is celebrated What began as an informal celebration of freedom by locals in Galveston eventually grew into a wider commemoration of the end of slavery as African Americans in Texas moved to other parts of the country. Today, many African Americans mark Juneteenth with parties, parades and gatherings with family and friends. Texas became the first state to make Juneteenth a state holiday in 1980. In addition to it being a federal holiday, at least 28 states and Washington, DC, will recognize it as a public holiday this year, according to the Pew Research Center. Other states may commemorate Juneteenth as a day of observance or in some other form. With Juneteenth now part of the mainstream, some activists and\u00a0leaders\u00a0point to the systemic inequities that Black Americans continue to face, such as the racial wealth gap, disproportionate incarceration and longstanding health disparities. One coalition of groups that represent the interests of Black communities, in particular, is acknowledging the holiday by drawing attention to the fight for reparations. As many of those calling for widespread changes suggest, observing Juneteenth might then be an opportunity to reflect on how far the nation has come \u2013 and how much further there is to go.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/06/19/us/juneteenth-federal-holiday-explained-cec/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/21/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_20_us_baltimore-bridge-collapse-ship-crew-deal", "text": "Twelve weeks after the Dali cargo ship lost power and crashed into a famed Baltimore bridge, the mammoth vessel will soon leave for repairs \u2013 with only a handful of crew on board. The 20 Indians and one Sri Lankan on board have been stuck on the ship since March 26, when the 984-foot ship lost propulsion, veered off course and destroyed the Francis Scott Key Bridge \u2013 killing six construction workers. They\u2019ve been unable to leave for a variety of reasons. But at a Thursday court hearing, a judge approved a deal that would allow eight of the crew members to fly home as early as this week. As for the 213-million-pound ship, the Dali is tentatively scheduled to leave Friday evening for Norfolk, Virginia, according to Baltimore Maritime Exchange. The Dali will undergo repairs in Norfolk, according to Synergy Marine, the company that manages the Dali and employs the crew. Four crew members will stay on board for the journey, said the Rev. Joshua Messick, director of the Baltimore International Seafarers\u2019 Center and chaplain for the Port of Baltimore. Eight crew are expected to fly back home in the coming days. The remaining crew members \u2013 including all of the ship\u2019s officers \u2013 will be required to stay in the United States until litigation involving the crash is finished, which could take more than a year, Messick said. Darrell Wilson, a spokesperson for Synergy Marine, could not confirm whether the 13 crew members will be forced to stay in the US until the end of litigation. But he told CNN they will remain in the US for now \u201cbecause they are participating in the investigation.\u201d The 13 crew members who will stay indefinitely in the US will be moved to hotels or apartments, Messick said. \u201cThey\u2019re anxious, under considerable stress considering they don\u2019t know what the future holds,\u201d Messick said Thursday. \u201cThey don\u2019t know when they\u2019ll see their family again or how they\u2019ll be treated here.\u201d The drama over 8 crew members\u2019 fate While none of the crew members have been charged in connection with the disaster, investigations are underway to determine who might be responsible. Baltimore\u2019s mayor has announced legal action, vowing to \u201chold the wrongdoers responsible.\u201d Attorneys for the city and for a bridge inspector who nearly died in the disaster want to depose the crew members, according to filings in the US District Court of Maryland. But legal technicalities have prevented them from doing so, said Jason Foster, an attorney representing the bridge inspector. The attorneys expressed shock in court documents this week after receiving an email from William Bennett, an attorney representing the ship\u2019s owner and manager, saying eight crew members might soon be able to fly home. \u201cOur clients are in the process of arranging for replacement crew for the DALI,\u201d Bennett wrote in an email to dozens of recipients Tuesday. \u201cWe have been advised that the U.S. Coast Guard will permit certain crew members to return to their home countries but has requested that other crew members remain in the United States.\u201d The eight eligible crew members do not include any officers, Wilson said. They include a cook, a fitter, an oiler and several able-bodied seamen. \u201cAll of these crew members have been interviewed by DOJ and DOJ does not object to their departure from the United States,\u201d Bennett wrote in his email, which was attached to court filings. CNN has reached out to the Department of Justice and the US Coast Guard for comment. Attorneys for the city and the bridge inspector filed emergency motions this week, asking a judge to temporarily ban any crew members from leaving the US because they hadn\u2019t been deposed. But opposing sides reached an agreement late Wednesday that would protect attorneys\u2019 ability to get sworn statements from the crew while allowing some of the seamen to go home. Their depositions \u201cwill be taken in London or elsewhere by written agreement of all parties to the Litigation,\u201d according to terms of the agreement filed in court. The depositions will take place \u201cno sooner than November 2024,\u201d the document states. Synergy Marine and Grace Ocean must make the crew members available for depositions in the months ahead and provide documents including personnel files, employment contracts and training files, according to the terms of the deal. A judge approved the agreement Thursday. But it\u2019s still unclear exactly when those eight seamen will get to leave, Wilson said. Why the crew wasn\u2019t deposed earlier No civil lawsuits can get underway because of a pending request by the ship\u2019s owner and manager to limit their financial liability, said Foster, one of the attorneys representing the bridge inspector. Foster said his client narrowly escaped and lost six friends in the bridge collapse. Six days after the catastrophe, Grace Ocean and Synergy Marine filed a petition in federal court\u00a0asking for a $43.6 million cap\u00a0on potential liability payouts. But a decision on that request probably won\u2019t happen anytime soon, since potential claimants have until September 24 to come forward, Foster told CNN Wednesday. And due to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Foster and other attorneys weren\u2019t able to depose the crew members until all of the potential claimants had come forward \u2013 in other words, possibly September or later. But with the new agreement approved Thursday, the eight crew members\u00a0can leave the country before they\u2019re deposed. And if the ship\u2019s owner or manager violates any terms of the agreement, they could face sanctions by the court. How the crew is faring now Despite months-long separation from their families, the seafarers are in good spirits, said Wilson, the Synergy Marine spokesperson. He said the company \u201clooks after them on a daily basis,\u201d helping make sure they have the supplies they need. And local seafarers\u2019 organizations have \u201cbeen tremendous in helping to look after the crew,\u201d Wilson told CNN on Wednesday. The seamen have had pizza and catered foods delivered as well as access to cricket matches broadcast from their home countries \u2013 \u201cyou know, small touches that mean a lot to the crew,\u201d Wilson said. But it\u2019s not clear exactly when the eight crew members \u2013 and the rest of their colleagues \u2013 will be able to leave. CNN has reached out to the Singapore-based unions representing the seafarers for comment. CNN\u2019s  Mary Kay Mallonee and Jeff Winter contributed to this report.

Whitehead was found guilty in March of two counts of wire fraud, as well as one count each of attempted wire fraud, attempted extortion and making false statements to federal law enforcement agents. The convictions are from three separate schemes. In addition to his prison sentence, the 45-year-old New Jersey man\u00a0\u201cwas sentenced to three years of supervised release and ordered to pay $85,000 in restitution and forfeit $95,000,\u201d\u00a0according to a news release from the US attorney\u2019s office and court documents. \u201cLamor Whitehead is a con man who stole millions of dollars in a string of financial frauds and even stole from one of his own parishioners.\u00a0He lied to federal agents, and again to the Court at his trial.\u00a0Today\u2019s\u00a0sentence puts an end to Whitehead\u2019s various schemes and reflects this Office\u2019s commitment to bring accountability to those who abuse their positions of trust,\u201d US Attorney\u00a0for the Southern District of New York Damian Williams said in the news release. One of Whitehead\u2019s attorneys has previously said they plan to appeal. CNN has reached out to Whitehead\u2019s lawyer for comment. Known for his Louis Vuitton suits and extravagant jewelry, Whitehead was a pastor at the Leaders of\u00a0Tomorrow International Ministries in Brooklyn. He made headlines in 2022 after he said he and his wife were\u00a0robbed of $1 million\u00a0worth of jewelry at their church. Prosecutors said Whitehead defrauded one of his parishioners by convincing her to invest approximately $90,000 of her retirement savings with him so he could help her buy a home; however, he ended up spending the money on luxury goods and personal expenses instead,\u00a0according to\u00a0an indictment. Whitehead also extorted a businessman for $5,000 and then attempted to convince the man to loan him $500,000 and grant him a stake\u00a0in real estate transactions in exchange for obtaining\u00a0\u201cfavorable actions by the New York City government\u201d\u00a0that he knew he could not provide, the indictment said. Whitehead used his ties to New York City Mayor Eric Adams to try to make the deal, the US attorney\u2019s office said in a\u00a0March news release. He also submitted a fraudulent application for a $250,000 business loan that included doctored bank statements, which falsely claimed he had millions of dollars in the bank and hundreds of thousands of dollars in monthly revenue,\u00a0according\u00a0to the US attorney\u2019s office news release. Whitehead\u00a0had \u201csubmitted similar fraudulent applications to various other financial institutions, stealing millions of dollars in the process,\u201d the release\u00a0said.

{"id": "2024_06_18_us_usa-swimming-coach-abuse-lawsuit", "text": "A former high-level swimmer accused her Hall of Fame coach of sexually abusing her about 15 years ago when she was a minor  and alleged USA Swimming and other organizations and individuals knew about the abuse and did nothing to stop it, according to a federal lawsuit. The suit from Amanda Le was filed against\u00a0\u201cthe individuals and corporate entities who let a known child rapist work as a youth swim coach, who supported him with infrastructure, position, and prestige for decades, and who allowed him full access to a never-ending cycle of young girls to prey upon,\u201d the suit states. \u201cAmanda Le was one of those girls.\u201d Filed in US District Court in Massachusetts on Friday, the 33-page lawsuit alleges sexual abuse on the part of Joseph Bernal, the former Fordham and Harvard swim coach who served on the US coaching staff at the 1984 and 1988 Olympics. He coached multiple Olympic medalists and world record holders and was inducted into the American Swim Coaches Hall of Fame in 2015, the lawsuit states. He also founded the Bernal\u2019s Gator Swim Club, an amateur swim club, and coached Le from 2006 to 2010. Bernal sexually abused Le from about 2008 to 2014, the lawsuit states. In February 2016, USA Swimming permanently banned Bernal for his abuse of an unnamed \u201cAthlete A,\u201d the lawsuit states. That athlete was Le, the suit states. Bernal is named on a USA Swimming website listing individuals permanently suspended or ineligible for membership, due to \u201csexual misconduct.\u201d \u201cUSA Swimming is deeply committed to the safety and welfare of all its members,\u201d the organization\u2019s then-spokesman Scott Leightman said in 2016 in a statement to The Boston Globe. \u201cThe Safe Sport program\u2019s mission is to increase awareness to reduce the risk for abuse in sport and our organization has no tolerance for violations of our code of conduct.\u2019\u2019 CNN reached out to USA Swimming for comment on the lawsuit. CNN has also reached out to an attorney for Bernal\u2019s estate and other defendants named in the lawsuits for comment. Bernal died in October 2022, according to an obituary. The lawsuit comes amid a series of allegations of abuse and wrongdoing in the national governing bodies that oversee elite-level youth sports like USA Swimming. In 2021, for example, USA Gymnastics, the US Olympic and Paralympic Committee and their insurers agreed to pay $380 million in a settlement with the victims of Larry Nassar, the former Olympic doctor who sexually abused girls for decades. Jon Little, Le\u2019s attorney, told CNN there is a culture that allows this abuse to happen. \u201cWhile what happened to her is sad, it\u2019s far from uncommon,\u201d Little said. \u201cPeople like Larry Nassar and Bernal, that produce Olympic medalists \u2013 as long as these guys produce medals and money, they can literally rape children. The system is designed to protect the producers. Getting rid of Nassar and Bernal does not change the problem.\u201d The attorney said Le filed the lawsuit to let kids know they are not alone. \u201cShe felt alone back then, but she doesn\u2019t now,\u201d Little said. What the lawsuit alleges According to the lawsuit, Le trained and competed with Bernal\u2019s Gator Swim Club of New England, known as BGSC-NE, from 13 to 18 years old. When she was 15 and Bernal was in his mid-60s, he kissed her after practice, and the sexual contact escalated over the next few years, the lawsuit states. \u201cWhile she was in high school, Amanda started to have panic attacks, which she believed at the time were due solely to the stress of swimming; she knew that (she) was afraid of performing poorly because she would be punished,\u201d the suit states. \u201cAmanda was also suffering the consequences of the sexual abuse, although she did not realize it at the time.\u201d On several overnight team trips, Le slept in Bernal\u2019s hotel room, the lawsuit states. From her junior year of high school into her senior year, she would skip school and the coach would pick her up and take her to his house for sex, according to the lawsuit. Le went to college from 2011 to 2014, and as a junior, Bernal impregnated Le and then paid for an abortion, the lawsuit states. The abuse continued even though some adults knew about it, according to the lawsuit. In one instance, Le\u2019s mother found her diary, which detailed her relationship with Bernal, and Le\u2019s parents then showed it to another coach for Bernal\u2019s Gator Swim Club, the lawsuit states. That coach did not contact law enforcement and \u201cdid nothing to protect Amanda,\u201d the suit states. In addition, USA Swimming \u201cwas aware of complaints about Bernal\u2019s inappropriate behavior with minor female swimmers\u201d before Le began the sport, the suit alleges. The suit accuses Bernal, USA Swimming and other defendants of violating the Trafficking Victims Protection Act. Further, the lawsuit accuses Bernal of sexual abuse and the others of negligence. Bernal was previously named in an August 2021 lawsuit in which Kimberly Stines accused him of a \u201cfive-year campaign of systemic emotional and sexual abuse\u201d beginning in 1976. USA Swimming is not a defendant in the lawsuit. Little, who also represents Stines, said the litigation is ongoing and a trial is expected sometime in late 2025 or early 2026. He said the system failed to protect Stines. \u201cThe system failed her and now she feels guilty that there is an Amanda Le,\u201d he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/18/us/usa-swimming-coach-abuse-lawsuit/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/21/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_18_us_ruidoso-new-mexico-south-fork-fire-evacuations", "text": "At least one person has been reported dead as a result of the fast-growing wildfires still burning in New Mexico, officials said Tuesday. The state Department of Homeland Security and Emergency Management told CNN they have received reports of one fatality, but had no additional information. The wildfires have been tearing across Lincoln County and the Mescalero Apache Reservation, converging on the village of Ruidoso \u201clike a pair of tongs\u201d and prompting thousands of residents to evacuate, officials say. The neighboring community of Ruidoso Downs also came under an evacuation order Tuesday. At least two individuals were injured during the wildfires, New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham said during a Tuesday evening news conference. They were treated for non-life threatening injuries. The governor earlier declared a\u00a0state of emergency\u00a0in the county and reservation. Approximately 1,400 structures have been lost in the flames and an estimated 8,000 people have been evacuated, New Mexico fire officials said in a Tuesday update. The South Fork Fire started Monday morning on Mescalero Apache tribal land and had spread to at least 3,000 acres by nightfall, officials said. It has since exploded in size to more than 15,000 acres as of Tuesday. A second blaze, the Salt Fire, is also burning on tribal land south of Ruidoso and had scorched more than 5,500 acres as of Tuesday, officials said. Both fires are acting like \u201ca pair of tongs, and Ruidoso is in the middle,\u201d New Mexico Forestry spokesperson George Ducker said. Eric Moro and his family were among those forced to flee their home in Ruidoso on Monday. The evacuation was sudden and his family had little time to prepare. He described the sky as orange and said they could barely breathe due to the smoke. \u201cThere\u2019s no going back right now. They are trying to get everybody out and we are not expecting any rain until Friday,\u201d Moro told CNN. \u201cWe\u2019re pretty high risk of losing our home.\u201d Moro\u2019s family had just moved into their home in March, and he said he\u2019s unsure of what they will do now. As of Tuesday evening,\u00a0Ruidoso Downs \u2013\u00a0a city of\u00a0about 2,600 people\u00a0directly east of\u00a0the\u00a0village\u00a0of Ruidoso \u2013\u00a0also\u00a0was\u00a0under an evacuation order due to the Salt Fire, according to\u00a0a post on the city\u2019s Facebook page. \u201cIf you are in Ruidoso Downs, please evacuate immediately. Do not try to gather belongings or save your property,\u201d the post reads. CNN has\u00a0sought more information from city and Lincoln County officials. Evacuation orders are also in place in parts of the Mescalero Apache Indian Reservation, which sits just south of Ruidoso, including the areas of Snow Springs, Fence Canyon, Whitetail, Chihuahua Well, Fantasy Lane, the Summit area, and Botella Road, the tribe said. Concerns over weather conditions State Forester Laura McCarthy, with the New Mexico Forestry Division, expressed concern Tuesday over the change in weather conditions. \u201cThe wind is in the process of shifting. Since the fire started, it had been a steady southwest wind and now we\u2019re seeing a shift with the wind coming from the west,\u201d McCarthy said. \u201cThere is potential with this wind coming in from the west to have additional homes impacted.\u201d Conditions are expected to become more favorable for firefighters over the South Fork fire as the chances of rain increase beginning Wednesday afternoon. More significant rainfall is expected on Thursday and Friday. The area around Ruidoso could see rainfall totals of 1 to 3 inches and rainfall rates of over an inch per hour, according to the National Weather Service, which could help with fire relief, though heavy rains can also cause flash flooding and debris flows over recent burn scars. The wildfires\u2019 explosive growth has been fed by very dry air and high temperatures. The conditions prompted the Storm Prediction Center to issue an elevated fire risk warning across most of New Mexico, meaning the wind and low humidity could lead to increased fire threats. Much of the area has been in extreme drought for nearly a year and southeast New Mexico is the only part of the US considered to be in \u201cexceptional drought.\u201d Few paths out of Ruidoso Though Ruidoso is home to only about 8,000 permanent residents, the area attracts a flow of recreational tourists with winding trails, vast parks and wilderness. The village estimates about 60% of its houses are vacation homes. Rebecca Dennis, who was vacationing in Ruidoso with her family, could smell the smoke Monday morning and proactively packed the family\u2019s bags as the fire seemed to grow closer. When the village was ordered to evacuate, the family jumped in the car to drive back to their home in Oklahoma. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine the chaos had we not been prepared. I truly feel awful for those residents & everyone. But it was \u2026 horrible to see the fires all around us,\u201d Dennis wrote on Facebook. Few paths out of Ruidoso remained Monday evening after both Highway 48 and Highway 70 at Apache Summit were closed due to the South Fork Fire, the village advised on Facebook: \u201cThe only route for evacuation is on Sudderth to Highway 70 and out to Roswell.\u201d The city of Roswell \u2013 about 70 miles east of Ruidoso \u2013 raced to accommodate evacuees on Monday, including by clearing hospital space for patients who are being relocated from the Ruidoso hospital and setting up emergency shelters for people and livestock. A shelter is open at Eastern New Mexico University and evacuees with RVs or large animals can also park and board their animals at the Eastern New Mexico State Fairgrounds, the city of Roswell announced. People from all over New Mexico and even Texas were also helping get horses to safety at the Ruidoso Downs Race Track and Casino on Tuesday. Justyn Brynn, who runs a racehorse rehabilitation center and an equestrian vacation business, said she helped rescue three trailers of horses after the evacuation alert was issued. \u201cWe hope we can go back and get more. We were only able to get 10 out,\u201d Brynn told CNN. \u201cThe barn we were working with had 40 or so horses to move.\u201d Power has been shut off in portions of Ruidoso at the request of first responders, electricity utility PNM said. \u201cPublic safety is a top priority and we do not take this decision lightly but are doing all we can to work in lockstep with our first responders who are helping the communities who are impacted,\u201d PNM said in a Facebook post. Fires blazing across the Western US There are 29 active large fires burning across the US, according to the National Interagency Fire Center, with 10 of those reported in California. The Post Fire in Los Angeles County has burned more than 15,600 acres and is about 31% contained, with more than 1,600 personnel assigned to fight the fire. Farther north in the state, the Sites Fire in Colusa County has grown to 10,000 acres and is zero percent contained and the Point Fire in Sonoma County has burned more than 1,200 acres and is about 20% contained.  The Aero Fire has\u00a0grown to\u00a05,249 acres in Calaveras County, with 20% containment and 3,690 structures threatened. The fires have forced evacuations in some surrounding areas. Cal Fire Capt. Marco Rodriguez said firefighters are facing winds of 50 to 60 mph, and the fire threat may get worse with expected weekend heat. So far this year, nearly 19,000 wildfires have burned almost 2,100,000 acres nationwide, according to the National Interagency Fire Center. That\u2019s well more than the 10-year annual average of acres burned to date \u2013 which is around 1,400,000. This is a developing story and will be updated.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/18/us/ruidoso-new-mexico-south-fork-fire-evacuations/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/21/2024", "section": "us"}}

The Post Fire had burned 15,611 acres and was 20% contained as of Monday evening,\u00a0according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, also known as Cal Fire. More than 1,000 firefighters were on scene, with more on their way, Los Angeles County Fire Department Section Chief Kenichi Ballew-Haskett told CNN Monday morning. \u201cWe\u2019re getting people on notice that if we have to issue a mandatory evacuation order that they need to leave,\u201d Ballew-Haskett said, advising people residents to have their bags packed, a full tank of gas and cell phones ready. \u201cOnce the sheriffs come by or law enforcement asks you to leave, it means the danger is imminent.\u201d The wildfire began Saturday afternoon in Gorman, an unincorporated community in northwestern Los Angeles County. The cause of the blaze is still under investigation, according to Cal Fire. California State Park Services evacuated 1,200 people from Hungry Valley Park, Cal Fire said. The fire had destroyed one commercial property by Monday evening, according to the Los Angeles County Fire Department. Evacuation orders are in place for areas west of Interstate 5 between Pyramid Lake and Gorman, and evacuation warnings are in place for areas south of Pyramid Lake between Old Ridge Route and the Los Angeles County line. Additional evacuation orders were issued Monday afternoon for the area south of Pyramid Lake, west of I-5, east of the County line and just north of the Templin Highway, the Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department said. As of Monday afternoon, the blaze was not spreading outside its current perimeter, but crews are still concerned about high winds that are supposed to continue through Tuesday afternoon, Fire Public Information Officer Flemming Bertelsen with the Los Padres National Forest\u00a0told CNN. Crews have been maintaining the perimeter of the fire by patrolling the line and looking for spot fires, Bertelsen\u00a0said. \u201cThe fire is not spreading in any significant manner right now, our lines are holding, but we have like 24 hours more of this wind,\u201d Bertelsen said, adding winds have been reaching 50 to 60 mph at the ridge tops. Low humidity is also a major concern, he said. \u201cWe are going to be tested, especially tonight,\u201d he said. The most active part of the fire is close to Piru Creek \u2013 and if it crosses the creek, the wildfire will enter heavy mountain terrain, he said. The National Weather Service in Los Angeles warned Sunday of wind gusts up to 60 to 70 mph, creating conditions that could potentially fuel the flames. A red flag warning was issued for the I-5 corridor in Los Angeles County and the Ventura County mountains until 5 p.m. Monday. Two adults and a child were taken to a hospital with minor injuries, CNN affiliate KABC reported, citing a spokesperson for the Los Angeles County Fire Department. Crews are working to contain the fire and \u201caircraft are working to stop forward progress but have limited visibility,\u201d according to the fire department. Pyramid Lake is also closed because of the threat posed by the fire, the fire department said. Meanwhile in Northern California, the Point Fire had burned about 1,190 acres in Sonoma County and destroyed at least two structures as of Monday evening, according to Cal Fire. Evacuation orders were issued Sunday for some residents, with first responders going door to door to assist, the Sonoma County Sheriff\u2019s Office said. Officials have deployed 36 fire engines, three helicopters, seven dozers, six hand crews and three water tenders to fight the fire, which was about 20% contained by Monday evening, Cal Fire reported. Another wildfire, the Aero Fire, started southeast of Sacramento Monday afternoon and grew with dangerous speed, consuming over 900 acres within just an hour and a half, Cal Fire said in\u00a0a post on Facebook. By Monday evening, it had grown to 1,500 acres. Strong winds are impacting firefighters\u2019 ability to establish a containment line, the post added. Evacuation orders and warnings were in place, according to the post, but aerials from CNN affiliate KCRA show the area is not densely populated. It\u2019s not immediately clear how many structures are threatened in the area. Further north, the Sites Fire in Colusa County had burned more than 4,400 acres and had no containment as of Monday evening, according to Cal Fire.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/16/us/los-angeles-post-fire/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/21/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_20_politics_aileen-cannon-trump-new-york-times", "text": "Two federal judges in south Florida urged District Judge Aileen Cannon to forgo overseeing the criminal prosecution of former President Donald Trump when she was first assigned the classified documents case in 2023, according to a\u00a0report from The New York Times. The judges, one of whom was the district\u2019s chief judge Cecilia M. Altonaga, suggested that Cannon decline to oversee the case brought by special counsel Jack Smith and allow another judge to govern the case instead, the Times wrote, citing two people briefed on the conversations. Cannon is still overseeing the case, which has seen a multitude of delays and is not yet scheduled to go to trial. Altonaga\u2019s chambers declined to comment on the report to CNN. The Times did not identify the second judge who reportedly contacted Cannon. At the time Cannon was assigned the high-profile criminal case, she had already\u00a0faced public backlash\u00a0\u2013 and a major reversal by an appeals court \u2013 over her handling of the lawsuit Trump brought challenging the FBI\u2019s search of his Mar-a-Lago residence in August 2022, when agents found hundreds of classified documents scattered about the property. Since then, Cannon has repeatedly raised eyebrows among legal scholars for her approach. Critics of the judge say that she has slowed the pace of the case to a near standstill, making a pre-election trial essentially out of reach. Attorneys who have practiced in front of Cannon\u00a0have told CNN that she tends to allow irrelevant legal questions distract from core issues \u2013 including a longshot motion from the former president to invalidate Jack Smith\u2019s appointment as special counsel that she\u2019s scheduled to hear extensive arguments on in the coming days. The attorneys who spoke to CNN also reported a zero-tolerance approach to any technical defects in filings, and a struggle with docket management that allows the type of pretrial disputes that other judges would decide in weeks go unresolved for months.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/20/politics/aileen-cannon-trump-new-york-times/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/21/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_20_cars_bugatti-horsepower-hybrid", "text": "Bugatti has unveiled its new model, the Bugatti Tourbillon, a massively powerful hybrid with an equally impressive price tag. The car will replace the $3.3 million, 1,500 horsepower Bugatti Chiron. You might have expected Bugatti\u2019s new model to be all-electric. Not only is the industry headed in that direction, but in 2021 Bugatti was spun off from Volkswagen Group and merged with Rimac, the Croatian company that makes the all-electric Rimac Nevera supercar. But Mate Rimac, the chief executive of the new company, now called Bugatti Rimac, said he never had any intention of making an all-electric Bugatti. As gasoline-powered cars gradually fade from the world\u2019s roads, Bugatti Rimac\u2019s engineers and designers wanted to create something that retained the spirit of mechanically powered Bugatti cars, just better: An insanely powerful plug-in hybrid. Like the Bugatti Chiron and Veyron models before it, the new Bugatti Tourbillon will have a huge, 16-cylinder gas engine. The engine, which was designed in cooperation with the British race car engineering firm Cosworth, will be assisted by three powerful electric motors. One motor in the back of the car and two more in the front will be capable of producing at least 800 horsepower on their own. In total, the Bugatti Tourbillon will be able to put out at least 1,800 horsepower, according to Bugatti Rimac. The electric motors will help make up for the new gas engine\u2019s lack of turbochargers. The Chiron\u2019s gas engine had four turbochargers that pushed air into the engine to help it produce more power. Mate Rimac said they wanted this new engine to be \u201cnaturally aspirated,\u201d meaning there would be no turbochargers. \u201cWe wanted to make the most exciting, most emotional combustion engine possible,\u201d Rimac said, \u201cand that is high revving, naturally aspirated.\u201d The car\u2019s interior is, likewise, an homage to old-fashioned machinery. The Tourbillon is named after a set of gears that helps maintain accuracy in a mechanical watch. The Bugatti\u2019s instrument display is modeled on mechanical watch dials. \u201cOne of the first things we did when the new company was formed, I took the whole team to Switzerland and we visited a few watchmakers,\u201d Rimac told CNN. The central speedometer display even has two needles like the hands of a clock. The long hand shows the car\u2019s speed while the short hand registers the revolutions per minute of the high-revving 16-cylinder engine. With a fully charged battery, the car will be able to travel about 37 miles on purely electric power before the gas engine needs to turn on, but the driver will have the option to run the gas engine continuously, if they wish. Unlike past Bugattis, though, the Tourbillon does have a reasonably large display screen with Apple CarPlay available. The screen will only come out and become visible when the driver requests it, though. In general, Bugatti designers have avoided putting screens in the cars in the belief that computer displays look outmoded quickly. \u201cWe think, really, how will this product look in 50 years, 100 years,\u201d said Rimac. \u201cAnd it\u2019s clear that, if you have a screen, it won\u2019t look that great.\u201d The cars will still be assembled one at a time at Bugatti\u2019s small factory in Molsheim, France. A total of only 250 Tourbillons will be built, Mate Rimac said, at a starting price of roughly $4 million each.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/20/cars/bugatti-horsepower-hybrid/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/21/2024", "section": "us"}}

{"id": "2024_06_20_politics_biden-administration-bans-kaspersky-software", "text": "The Biden administration is taking the unprecedented step of\u00a0banning\u00a0US companies and citizens from using software made by a major Russian cybersecurity firm because of national security concerns, Commerce Department Secretary Gina announced Thursday. The move uses relatively new Commerce Department authorities built on executive orders signed by Presidents\u00a0Joe Biden and Donald Trump to ban the use of software products by\u00a0Russian\u00a0firm,\u00a0Kaspersky\u00a0Lab,\u00a0inside the US. Thursday\u2019s announcement comes after CNN reported in April that the Biden administration was preparing to issue an order that would\u202fprevent US companies and citizens from using Kaspersky software. \u201cWe are announcing that after an extremely thorough investigation, we are taking action \u2026 which will prohibit Kaspersky Lab and all of its affiliates, subsidiaries and parent company from providing cyber security and anti-virus software anywhere in the United States,\u201d Raimondo told reporters. \u201cWe\u2019re also adding three Kaspersky entities to the Entity List, which means that they won\u2019t be able to sell or update software in the US,\u201d she added.\u00a0\u201cRussia has shown it has the capacity and even more than that, the intent, to exploit Russian companies like\u00a0Kaspersky\u00a0to collect and weaponize the personal information of Americans\u00a0and that\u2019s why we are compelled to take the action that we\u2019re taking today.\u201d It\u2019s the latest move by the US government to block Americans from using popular technology that it considers a national security risk. CNN has reached out to Kaspersky for comment. US government agencies are already banned from using Kaspersky\u00a0Lab software,\u00a0but action to prevent private companies from using the software is unprecedented. US officials have for years alleged that the Russian government could force Kaspersky Lab to hand over data or use its anti-virus software\u202fto attempt to carry out\u202fhacking or surveillance of Americans \u2014\u202faccusations that Kaspersky Lab strenuously denies. Raimondo reiterated that concern during Thursday\u2019s announcement. \u201cWhile we\u2019ve been exploring every option at our disposal, we ultimately decided that given the Russian government\u2019s continued offensive cyber capabilities and capacity to influence\u00a0Kaspersky\u2019s\u00a0operations, that we have to take the significant measure of a full prohibition, if we\u2019re going to protect Americans and their personal data,\u201d she told reporters. A Commerce Department official said Thursday that the agency\u2019s final determination implementing the ban does not identify any specific instances in which the Russian government has attempted to exploit Kaspersky or used the company\u2019s software for data collection. \u201cBut we certainly believe that it is more than just a theoretical threat,\u201d the official added, noting the Commerce\u00a0Department\u2019s\u00a0new authorities allow it to act proactively, even in the absence of concrete examples. Founded in Moscow in 1997, Kaspersky Lab grew into one of the world\u2019s most successful anti-virus software companies alongside American rivals like McAfee and Symantec. Kaspersky Lab\u2019s researchers, recognized as top-tier in the cybersecurity industry, are known for analyzing hacking operations suspected of being carried out by a variety of governments including Russia, the US and Israel, but also cybercriminal threats that affect everyday users. Some of the speculation and suspicion from US officials about the Russian company centers around Eugene Kaspersky, a charismatic computer expert who co-founded Kaspersky Lab in Moscow in 1997. Eugene Kaspersky studied cryptography at a KGB-sponsored university\u202f\u2014 a fact that some\u202fUS lawmakers\u202flike to mention when trying to tie the company to Russian government. Kaspersky Lab has denied having \u201cany unethical ties or affiliations with any government, including Russia.\u201d Kaspersky served as a software engineer at a Russian Ministry of Defense institute after graduation, and that is \u201cthe extent of his military experience,\u201d the\u202fcompany says. Kaspersky has\u202flamented\u202fthat his company is the victim of geopolitical tensions between the West and Russia \u2014\u202ftensions that have only grown sharper since the Kremlin\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/20/politics/biden-administration-bans-kaspersky-software/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/21/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_20_us_donkey-elk-herd-california-cec", "text": "When Diesel the donkey ran away on a hike near his home outside Sacramento, California, five years ago, his owners assumed the worst. \u201cHe\u2019s not aggressive, he\u2019s a lover,\u201d Terrie Drewry told CNN affiliate KOVR in 2019, days after Diesel\u2019s great escape. \u201cBut right now, he\u2019s scared.\u201d Years passed without a sign of life from Diesel \u2014\u00a0until earlier this year, when a hunter spotted and filmed a herd of at least a dozen elk in the northern California wilderness. Among them, strangely, was a wild burro. Drewry is positive that the donkey in the hunter\u2019s video is her Diesel. \u201cFinally we saw him,\u201d Drewry told KOVR this month after the Instagram video began making headlines. \u201cFinally, we know he\u2019s good. He\u2019s living his best life. He\u2019s happy. He\u2019s healthy, and it was just a relief.\u201d The Drewry family adopted Diesel from the Bureau of Land Management, and he lived on their ranch in peace for the first few years of his life alongside chickens, a llama and a miniature donkey. But on a fateful hike in April 2019, Diesel noticed something that spooked him and took off running, dragging Drewry\u2019s husband Dave through the bushes behind him, she told KOVR at the time. For weeks they searched for Diesel in the Cache Creek Wilderness, a rugged area northwest of Sacramento made up of nearly 30,000 acres. They thought they spotted him on a trail camera and once found some tracks that may have matched his hooves, but they never found him. Enter Max Fennell, a professional triathlete who occasionally hunts in wild California with a bow and arrow. On a hunting trip in March, Fennell stumbled upon the elk herd \u2014 and was stunned to see a donkey among them. In a video shot by Fennell, which Drewry said was taken mere miles from where Diesel bolted in 2019, the herd is seen moving in unison. When Fennell spots them, they stop to stare at him. The animals don\u2019t move again until the donkey apparently gives the all-clear: After sizing up a disbelieving Fennell, the burro turns its head and trots off. The elk quickly follow. \u201cProbably one of my wildest hunting trips to date,\u201d Fennell wrote in the caption of the video on Instagram. \u201cI can\u2019t get over seeing it and I\u2019m amazed that the donkey looks happy and healthy!\u201d In addition to clearing land, pulling wagons and providing general cuteness, donkeys can protect livestock on farms. The pack animals fiercely defend their flocks by braying, kicking wildly and charging, teeth bared, at potential predators. Drewry suspects that, if the donkey Fennell spotted is indeed Diesel, he\u2019s merely doing his donkey duty and protecting his deer friends. \u201cThey learned to get along and be each other\u2019s family,\u201d she told KOVR. A video shared in September last year also purported to show Diesel with his elk kin. The donkey in that clip looked utterly content, trotting through tall yellow grass in the dappled sunlight. Though she misses him, Drewry said she won\u2019t try to catch Diesel and bring him back. As grazing animals, donkeys in the wild can usually find plenty to eat. And the donkey in Fennell\u2019s video appears to be thriving in the wilderness, with friends by his side. \u201cHe\u2019s truly a wild burro now,\u201d she said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/20/us/donkey-elk-herd-california-cec/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/21/2024", "section": "us"}}

Strain\u2019s body was found in the Cumberland River in West Nashville on the morning of March 22, several miles from where he had gone missing. The 22-year-old University of Missouri student had been in town on a weekend trip two weeks earlier when he was kicked out of a bar, authorities said. The Metropolitan Nashville Police Department said the autopsy, released Tuesday, corroborates the findings of their missing person detectives, and the department is now officially classifying Strain\u2019s death as accidental. The autopsy report said Strain\u2019s blood alcohol level was 0.228, which is almost three times the legal driving limit. The cannabis compound Delta-9 THC was also found in his system, the report said. Police found Strain had consumed \u201cmultiple alcoholic drinks\u201d at different establishments in Nashville, became separated from his friends and was \u201cnoticeably impaired\u201d as he walked onto Gay Street, adjacent to the Cumberland River on the night of March 8.

After dozens of reports of lacerations from exposed blades, Vitamix announced a recall of about 569,000 blending containers and blade bases for its high-powered blenders. It expands on an extensive recall already issued in 2018 for some of the most expensive and well-known blenders on the market. The recall said that the container can separate from the blade base and can expose the blades. Twenty-seven people have reported lacerations to Vitamix, which includes 11 reports from a 2018 recall that affected more than 100,000 units. Vitamix is not offering replacements or a refund. All affected customers should immediately stop using the recalled parts, the company said, and contact Vitamix for a repair kit. The repair kit includes a protective plastic shroud to put over the blade base as well as additional instructions. The company said it worked with Health Canada and the US Consumer Product Safety Commission to evaluate the potential remedies, and all three agreed on the repair kit. \u201cVitamix\u2019s top priority is the safety of its customers. To ensure Vitamix has a well-built product, Vitamix products undergo extensive testing, leveraging the 130+ test procedures in Vitamix\u2019s catalog to assess every component for quality and durability,\u201d Vitamix said in a statement. Vitamix instructed customers who repaired their blenders in the 2018 recall to stop using those blender parts as well. The recall affects all Ascent and Venturist Series 8-ounce blending containers, 20-ounce blending containers, and blade bases. Faulty blade bases and blending containers may have been sold separately, according to the recall posted on the CPSC website. \u201cThe clear containers and black blade bases are included with certain Vitamix Venturist and Ascent Series blenders, such as the Venturist V1200, Ascent A2300, Ascent A2500, Ascent A3300, and Ascent A3500 blenders; and also sold separately, as sets, or bundles in various configurations,\u201d the recall said.

{"id": "2024_06_20_tech_new-york-hochul-social-media-algorithms-children", "text": "Big changes are coming for New York\u2019s youngest social media users after Gov. Kathy Hochul signed two bills into law Thursday clamping down on digital platforms\u2019 algorithms and use of children\u2019s data. The unprecedented move makes New York the first state to pass a law regulating social media algorithms amid nationwide allegations that apps such as Instagram or TikTok have hooked users with addictive features. Hochul\u2019s signature comes days after US Surgeon General Vivek Murthy called for warning labels to be applied to social media platforms, fueling a debate about social media\u2019s potential impact on the mental health of users, particularly teens. Under New York\u2019s SAFE For Kids Act, social media platforms will be required to display content chronologically by default for kids under 18, while the New York Child Data Protection Act will restrict websites from collecting or sharing the personal data of users under 18 without consent \u2014 expanding on existing federal privacy protections for children under 13. The SAFE For Kids Act also requires platforms to limit late-night app notifications that state lawmakers say are engineered to drive user engagement and that risk hindering sleep. Both pieces of legislation were introduced last fall and cleared the state legislature in early June. New York officials hailed the legislation as a critical check on social media platforms\u2019 influence over teens. \u201cToday, we save our children,\u201d Hochul said Thursday at a press conference. \u201cWe have heard their cries for help, reminding us as adults that we have a moral responsibility to protect young New Yorkers from harm and from addictive forces.\u201d In a statement Thursday afternoon, a Meta spokesperson said, \u201cWhile we don\u2019t agree with every aspect of these bills, we welcome New York becoming the first state to pass legislation recognizing the responsibility of app stores.\u201d \u201cAccording to research, the vast majority of parents support legislation requiring app stores to obtain parental approval to download apps, and we will continue to work with policymakers in New York and elsewhere to advance this approach,\u201d the spokesperson said. CNN has reached out to Google, Snap and TikTok for comment. Some academics have said that while studies highlight associations between specific types of social media activities and negative mental health outcomes \u2013 such as engaging in social comparison \u2013 a causal link between those harms and general social media use is less clear. Still, numerous states and federal lawmakers have pushed for legislation clamping down on social media platforms, arguing that tech companies\u2019 products are to blame for eating disorders, sleeplessness, distraction and, in some cases, self-harm and suicide. \u201cWe will save lives with this, my friends,\u201d Hochul said at Thursday\u2019s press conference. New York Attorney General Letitia James added Thursday that the legislation would take on \u201cthe most dangerous aspects of social media, the addictive algorithm feeds that exploit impressionable minds.\u201d \u201cThese bills will empower my office to set rules and ensure companies are following them,\u201d James said. Opponents of the social media algorithm bill \u2014 including but not limited to the tech industry \u2014 have said the legislation is likely unconstitutional because it infringes on children\u2019s First Amendment rights and raises other questions about how social media can function in practice across state lines. \u201cIt\u2019s a well-intentioned effort, but it\u2019s aimed at the wrong target,\u201d said Adam Kovacevich, CEO of the tech industry advocacy group Chamber of Progress. \u201cAlgorithmic curation makes teenagers\u2019 feeds healthier, and banning algorithms is going to make social media worse for teens.\u201d The legislation\u2019s signing sets the stage for another in a long string of court battles over state social media laws. States such as Arkansas, Florida, Louisiana and many others have passed laws clamping down on social media companies\u2019 approach to teens. Industry groups have challenged some of that legislation, and courts have largely viewed the laws with skepticism. In Ohio this year, for example, a federal judge temporarily blocked a law prohibiting online platforms from creating accounts for users under 16 unless they obtain parental consent, saying the legislation likely violates the First Amendment. Two states, Texas and Florida, have passed laws that would restrict online platforms from moderating their sites; legal challenges reached the Supreme Court this term and a decision is expected within weeks.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/20/tech/new-york-hochul-social-media-algorithms-children/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/21/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_20_politics_trump-engoron-new-york-civil-fraud", "text": "Lawyers for Donald Trump asked the New York judge who ordered the former president to pay nearly half a billion dollars to recuse himself from the case alleging the judge engaged in \u201cprohibited communications\u201d with a real estate lawyer about the case before issuing his decision. Trump\u2019s attorneys said if Judge Arthur Engoron would not recuse from the case they are seeking an evidentiary hearing to delve into the judge\u2019s reported conversation with New York real estate lawyer Adam Bailey. In a\u00a0series of filings with the court on Thursday, Trump\u2019s attorneys\u00a0cite an interview Bailey gave to NBC New York the day the verdict was rendered, in which Bailey said, he \u201chad the ability to speak to [this Court] three weeks ago \u2026 I saw him in the corner [at the courthouse] and I told my client, \u2018I need to go.\u2019 And I walked over and we started talking \u2026 I wanted him to know what I think [about the case] and why \u2026 I really want him to get it right.\u201d Trump\u2019s lawyers say that is a reason why the judge should recuse himself from the case, which has since been appealed. The judge is still overseeing a monitor who he put in place to oversee the Trump Organization\u2019s finances. \u201cSpecifically, this Court has been publicly accused of engaging in prohibited communications regarding the merits of this case, in clear violation of the Code and this Court\u2019s solemn oath,\u201d Trump\u2019s lawyers wrote, adding, \u201cWhere, as here, this Court\u2019s impartiality might reasonably be questioned under the circumstances, it must recuse. Indeed, there is no other means of dispelling the shadow that now looms over this Court\u2019s impartiality, fairness, and ability to adhere to the Code.\u201d \u201cAccording to Mr. Bailey, this Court was an active participant in a conversation concerning the merits of the case, wherein this Court asked Mr. Bailey a \u2018lot of questions,\u2019\u201d Trump\u2019s lawyers, who also\u00a0subpoenaed the real estate lawyer, wrote. Bailey told CNN that he only spoke with Engoron about his September summary judgment decision \u201cbecause that\u2019s the only thing I discussed with reporters.\u201d Bailey said they \u201cwere discussing the law and how he got the law wrong,\u201d adding: \u201cI didn\u2019t even follow the trial.\u201d He went on to say he didn\u2019t think speaking with Engoron about his personal views on the judge\u2019s published decision \u201cwas wrong in any way.\u201d \u201cI was tricked, I was duped and I\u2019m devastated that any of this is happening, it\u2019s just wrong,\u201d Bailey said.\u00a0\u201cI am devastated and I am hurt that even though Judge Engoron is retiring very soon that he still has to deal with this, because of a statement I gave off-the-record.\u201d CNN has reached out to NBC New York. Bailey declined to comment on whether he would move to quash the subpoena. The NBC New York article was published in May, months after Engoron issued his $454 million judgement against Trump in February. Bailey told NBC New York he spoke with Engoron before the judge issued his decision in the case. A spokesman for the court told NBC New York at the time, \u201cNo ex parte conversaion concerning this matter occurred between Justice Engoron and Mr. Bailey or any other person. The decision Justice Engoron issued February 16 was his alone, was deeply considered, and was wholly uninfluenced by this individual.\u201d Al Baker, spokesman for the Office of Court Administration, said Thursday,\u00a0\u201cWe have no further comment on this matter.\u201d The New York Attorney General\u2019s office declined to comment.

{"id": "2022_06_17_us_juneteenth-flag-meaning-explainer-cec", "text": "On this holiday you might see another red, white and blue flag flying over state capitols and city buildings. That banner with a bursting star in the middle is the Juneteenth Flag, a symbolic representation of the end of slavery in the United States. The flag is the brainchild of activist Ben Haith, founder of the National Juneteenth Celebration Foundation (NJCF). Haith created the flag in 1997 with the help of collaborators, and Boston-based illustrator Lisa Jeanne Graf brought their vision to life. The flag was revised in 2000 into the version we know today, according to the National Juneteenth Observation Foundation. Seven years later, the date \u201cJune 19, 1865\u201d was added, commemorating the day that Union Army Maj. Gen. Gordon Granger rode into Galveston, Texas, and told enslaved African Americans of their emancipation. For more than two decades, communities around the country have held flag-raising ceremonies on Juneteenth in celebration of their freedom. \u201cThis country has so many aspects to it that are spiritual, and I believe this flag is of that nature,\u201d Haith said. \u201cIt (the idea for the design) just came through me.\u201d Designing the flag and its symbols was a deliberate process, Haith said. Here\u2019s what each element of the flag represents. The star  The white star in the center of the flag has a dual meaning, Haith said. For one, it represents Texas, the Lone Star State. It was in Galveston in 1865 where Union soldiers informed the country\u2019s  last remaining enslaved people that, under the Emancipation Proclamation issued two years earlier, they were free. But the star also goes beyond Texas, representing the freedom of African Americans in all 50 states. The burst  The bursting outline around the star is inspired by a nova, a term that astronomers use to mean a new star. On the Juneteenth flag, this represents a new beginning for the African Americans of Galveston and throughout the land. The arc  The curve that extends across the width of the flag represents a new horizon: the opportunities and promise that lay ahead for Black Americans. The colors  The red, white and blue represents the American flag, a reminder that slaves and their descendants were and are Americans.  June 19, 1865, represents the day that enslaved Black people in Galveston, Texas, became Americans under the law. And while African Americans today are still fighting for equality and justice, Haith said those colors symbolize the continuous commitment of people in the United States to do better \u2013 and to live up to the American ideal of liberty and justice for all.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2022/06/17/us/juneteenth-flag-meaning-explainer-cec/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/21/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_19_us_undocumented-spouses-biden-immigration-policy-cec", "text": "In love, married and pregnant, Ashley DeAzevedo faced an impossible choice she never expected. If her husband, an undocumented immigrant from Brazil, wanted to become a US citizen, he\u2019d have to leave the country for a decade. It\u2019s been more than 11 years since an immigration attorney delivered the devastating news, but she can still feel its sting. \u201cI just remember the conversation feeling like somebody took the air out of my lungs. Because I was not expecting that. And neither was he,\u201d DeAzevedo says. On Tuesday, the 38-year-old New Jersey hair salon owner was starting to feel like she could breathe again. DeAzevedo sat in the second row of an event at the White House and cheered as President Biden announced a new policy that aims to help her family and about a half million others in a similar situation. The measure allows certain undocumented spouses and children of US citizens to apply for lawful permanent residency without leaving the country. \u201cThis is really significant,\u201d said Julia Gelatt, associate director of the US program at the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute. \u201cIt\u2019s removing a barrier that\u2019s prevented hundreds of thousands of unauthorized immigrants from obtaining that green card that they\u2019re otherwise eligible for.\u201d The election-year announcement is already drawing high praise from Democrats and fierce criticism from Republicans. DeAzevedo, president of American Families United, an organization that advocates for mixed-status families, says it shouldn\u2019t be about politics, but about doing what\u2019s right. She spoke with CNN this week before and after Biden\u2019s announcement, sharing how living in the shadows has affected her, her husband and their 11-year-old son, and what this new policy could mean for them and many others. Excerpts from those conversations have been edited for length and clarity. How are you feeling? Wow, like my feet have not hit the ground yet. Today was just one of the wildest in my life, to go to the White House for the first time, and to be there when the president made such a historic announcement. I mean, I\u2019m not an emotional person generally. I don\u2019t cry a lot. But it was very hard for me to hold my emotions. I was a sobbing, crying mess listening to him speak, because he was telling my story. He was speaking about my family and all the families of the people that I love and care about. I think a lot of people assume that when an undocumented immigrant marries a US citizen, there\u2019s an easy path to legalize their status. Yeah. That is not the case. When did you first realize that? We were newly married at the time. I was pregnant. I knew my husband didn\u2019t have status in the United States. But I figured, let me just find a lawyer. So we met with her. And she said, \u201cWell, here comes the bad news. I can\u2019t do anything to help you guys. Your husband would have to leave the country for 10 years.\u201d (After meeting with the attorney), we were like, well, what are we going to do? I can\u2019t move to Brazil. I have my business here. I have my family here. And I obviously didn\u2019t want to raise a child without my husband. So, we made the decision to stay here in the shadows, hoping that something would change. It\u2019s not an easy lifestyle. It\u2019s not for the faint of heart. How have your daily lives been shaped by this situation? It\u2019s frustrating because my husband can\u2019t ever work to his full ability. It\u2019s all just side jobs and whatever. We had to not really live up to what we could potentially. I had to qualify for a mortgage all by myself because he couldn\u2019t be on it with me. He can\u2019t get life insurance. He can\u2019t get health insurance. There\u2019s just so many different, nuanced, stupid, stupid things that he\u2019s excluded from. It feels like being a second-class citizen. It\u2019s like you live here and you pay taxes, but you can\u2019t be treated like a human being like everyone else around you. It just feels so cruel. He hasn\u2019t seen his parents in 18 years. His dad passed away, and he was never able to go back and see him. I think people forget the human toll. You\u2019re never going to be able to get that moment back. He\u2019s never going to be able to give his dad one last hug. Before you met your husband and went through all of this alongside him, was this something that was on your radar at all? Not really. I had some friends in the Brazilian community, so I kind of had an idea, but I never really understood. For me, it just wasn\u2019t really important, because on one side of my family, we\u2019ve been here since the Revolutionary War. And on the other side, my mom\u2019s side of the family, I\u2019m a third-generation American with ancestors from Italy who came over through Ellis Island. The immigrant story is something that\u2019s very rich in my family. It just never crossed my mind that there would be this ridiculous hurdle for somebody if they\u2019re married to an American. Do you find yourself often meeting people that don\u2019t realize that this is the reality that a lot of families are living in? What do you tell them? It\u2019s not something I share regularly. It\u2019s not like I wear a badge that\u2019s like, \u201cmy husband\u2019s, undocumented.\u201d But if I hear people speaking disparagingly about immigrants, I can\u2019t help myself but say, \u201cyou don\u2019t know the whole story. Don\u2019t \u2018good immigrant, bad immigrant\u2019 with me. Because my husband, who you love spending time with and you think is such a great human, is part of this group of people.\u201d When I explain it to people, it blows their mind. What is the significance of this new measure for you and your family? I think the devil is in the details, and it\u2019s really going to matter exactly how they implement the policy. What was announced today was the nuts and bolts, you know, the intention, the directive, and the basic framework, but no real, significant details on implementation. For my husband, it really could be the piece that unlocks his green card pathway that he does have, it just is only available to him after 10 years outside the country. If that were the case, then he could move forward onto his green card and eventually one day become a citizen. That would give him the ability to see his mom again for the first time in 18 years. It would give my son the ability to travel with his dad, to go meet his grandma. He\u2019s never met her before. It would just mean a lot of things \u2014 peace of mind, never worrying after my husband gets pulled over. It\u2019s just terrifying. If he\u2019s late or he doesn\u2019t answer his phone, your mind automatically goes to the worst place. And it sounds like having a work permit would be a game changer? Yeah, a total game changer. You first became more politically involved in the time of family separations during the Trump administration. Do you worry that, as significant as a policy like this is, it\u2019s something that a future administration could undo? I\u2019m kind of conflicted with that, because there are always concerns. I\u2019m sure there are going to be legal challenges. But during the pandemic when the initial CARES Act funding excluded mixed-status families, Republican senators like Marco Rubio and John Cornyn really came to our aid and fought for that to be made right and retroactive, so that when the next round of funding came out, it covered our families as well, not our spouses, but it made sure US citizens and their children were able to collect those funds. So knowing that Republicans fought through this before, and Donald Trump actually is the one who agreed and signed it into law, leads me to believe that maybe the \u201cparty of family values\u201d might see that this isn\u2019t a fair situation. And Donald Trump\u2019s wife is an immigrant. He knows the process. He gets it. He\u2019s fallen in love with somebody from a different country as well. So he knows better than anybody that our families should be treated the same as everyone else. Already Republican leadership is slamming this new policy as a \u201cmass amnesty scheme.\u201d What\u2019s your response to that? It\u2019s disappointing. I hope they\u2019ll reconsider their position on that. Not only because their candidate for president is married to an immigrant who was able to benefit from the spousal green card pathway, but also, you know, have a little compassion and see that we\u2019re American families. My family goes back to the Revolutionary War here, and the thought that my husband wouldn\u2019t be welcome in this country is just outrageous. Are there any questions that you have right now about what\u2019s next? What\u2019s on your mind right now as you think of the months to come? Well, all of the partners we\u2019ve been advocating with and the people we\u2019ve been working with inside government, we have a lot of conversations coming up. I want to make sure that my members are covered \u2014 not only those that are here in the US. I think a really important piece to tell of this story is the Americans that went through the process, found themselves outside of the country for an interview and were barred from returning if they got bad legal advice or something like that. There are families that are separated right now that are really, really suffering. And we need to make sure that there is relief for them as well. Today was one step in the right direction, like a down payment on a promise,\u00a0and there\u2019s a lot of work ahead. Did your husband and your son come with you to the White House? My son and my mom came with me. My husband, because of policy, wasn\u2019t able to come to the White House. He is here in DC, though, and he was able to celebrate. He was watching it live. For him, it\u2019s surreal. You know, he\u2019s lived this reality where again, he hasn\u2019t seen his mom for 18 years. His dad passed away since he left Brazil. If he ever gets to return, he\u2019s going to be there and his dad won\u2019t be there. So today was the first time that he really felt like there was a glimmer of hope for some sense of normalcy for him.

The Board of Elders of Gateway Church said in a statement Tuesday that prior to June 14, they didn\u2019t have all the facts of the abuse. \u201cThe elders\u2019 prior understanding was that Morris\u2019s extramarital relationship, which he discussed many times throughout his ministry, was with \u2018a young lady\u2019 and not abuse of a 12-year-old child,\u201d the statement reads. \u201cEven though it occurred many years before Gateway was established, as leaders of the church, we regret that we did not have the information that we now have.\u201d The elders said they were \u201cheartbroken and appalled\u201d and expressed sympathy to the victim and her family. \u201cWhen I was in my early twenties, I was involved in inappropriate sexual behavior with a young lady in a home where I was staying. It was kissing and petting and not intercourse, but it was wrong. This behavior happened on several occasions over the next few years,\u201d the pastor said in a statement. The woman, Cindy Clemishire, told WFAA the abuse started on Christmas Day in 1982 and continued until 1987, when she told her parents.

I submitted myself to the Elders of Shady Grove Church and the young lady\u2019s father. They asked me to step out of ministry and receive counseling and freedom ministry, which I did. Since that time, I have walked in purity and accountability in this area,\u201d Morris said in his statement, adding he and his wife met with the survivor and her family in 1989. \u201cI asked their forgiveness, and they graciously forgave me,\u201d he said. Clemishire told WFAA that though her family forgave him, they never supported Morris returning to the ministry. \u201cI think leaders can get caught up and think it\u2019s our responsibility to protect God and it\u2019s not.
