The man \u201csustained multiple bites\u201d in Del Mar, California Sunday morning, Jon Edelbrock,\u00a0community services director and\u00a0chief lifeguard for the city, told CNN. The incident occurred just before 9 a.m. about 100 yards off the Del Mar shore in front of lifeguard headquarters, Edelbrock said. The victim was among a group of experienced swimmers who routinely swim in the area when he was bitten in the mid-section of his body and suffered arm and hand injuries, Edelbrock said. He was able to get to shore with help from his friends. Lifeguards provided pre-hospital care and he was quickly transported to a trauma center. \u201cHe had obvious\u00a0injuries\u00a0from the incident that required surgery, mostly large lacerations,\u201d Edelbrock said. As a result, a two-mile stretch of the beach will be closed for 48 hours, Edelbrock said. After the attack, researchers from California State University Long Beach\u2019s\u00a0Shark Lab\u00a0responded to take water samples and analyze the victim\u2019s wet suit for possible DNA to try to determine the size and type of shark involved. Most likely it was a juvenile white shark, Shark Lab Director Chris Lowe told CNN. Researchers will try a new scientific tool to hopefully one day be able to determine if the shark involved in Sunday\u2019s incident can be detected in the area at another time. \u201cWe hope to use it in the future to monitor and help lifeguards manage beaches,\u201d Lowe said. Although sharks are abundant in the area, shark bites are rare, Lowe said. \u201cWhat\u2019s interesting is that we\u2019ve been monitoring that site because it\u2019s known as a juvenile aggregation site,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve tagged over 60 sharks there over the years and they\u2019re detected routinely. We detected four today.\u201d A drone study conducted by the lab and published\u00a0last year\u00a0found that across California,\u00a0young white sharks swam very close to people without swimmers even noticing. And there is a lower probability of being bitten at a shark aggregation site than at a non-aggregation site, Lowe said. \u201cSharks are known to avoid people, but every once in a while, they make mistakes,\u201d Lowe said. \u201cIt\u2019s possible the shark involved this incident was literally just passing through and hadn\u2019t had a chance to encounter people.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/02/us/del-mar-california-shark-attack/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/03/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_02_us_grass-fire-evacuation-san-joaquin-tracy-california", "text": "A growing grass fire that began Saturday afternoon in\u00a0San Joaquin County, California, has consumed 14,000 acres, forcing residents in its path to evacuate the area, officials say. The Corral Fire began in the City of Tracy around 2:30 p.m., according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. By Sunday afternoon, the flames were 30% contained, the department said on X. The cause of the fire is under investigation, according to the department. Area officials had recently warned that gusty winds, hotter temperatures and dried out grass could create dangerous fire conducive conditions. \u201cAreas west of the California Aqueduct, South of Corral Hollow Creek, West to Alameda County and South to Stanislaus County should leave now,\u201d the county said Saturday. Earlier Saturday night, San Joaquin County officials instructed Tracy residents nearest to the Corral Fire to flee and told others nearby that they \u201cshould be ready to leave.\u201d A temporary evacuation site has been set up at Larch Clover Community Center for impacted residents. Two Alameda County firefighters were injured while responding to the\u00a0fire,\u00a0Cal Fire Battalion Chief Josh Silveira told CNN early Sunday morning. They had minor to moderate injuries and were transported to a local hospital for evaluation and treatment, Silveira said. \u201cPraying for our Tracy neighbors and first responders,\u201d Mayor Kevin J Lincoln, of the neighboring City of Stockton, said on social media late Saturday night. A section of I-580 is closed in both directions due to the \u201cmajor grass fire, smoke, and zero visibility,\u201d according to the\u00a0California Department of Transportation. The fire could spread farther with gusty winds expected to continue overnight in the area with speeds up to 40 mph, according to the National Weather Service in Sacramento. Sweltering heat into the upcoming week could multiply dangerous fire conditions. \u201cAn Excessive Heat Watch across the Valley and adjacent foothills for Tuesday into Thursday continues with afternoon highs of 95-107\u02daF forecasted,\u201d the weather service said. The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection recently suspended all residential outdoor burning of landscape debris such as branches and leaves in Alameda, Contra Costa, Santa Clara and western San Joaquin and Stanislaus counties. The department said the suspension was due to increasing fire danger posed by the hot, dry conditions in the region. Also contributing are warming temperatures and winds that make for a high volume of dead grass. Firefighters have responded to over 1,200 wildfires across the state so far this year, the department said Friday. \u201cAs the summer heat intensifies, CAL FIRE Santa Clara Unit\u2019s commitment and unwavering e\ufb00orts remain steadfast in safeguarding California\u2019s communities from wildfires. By staying vigilant and following fire safety and prevention guidelines, we can work together to mitigate the risk and protect our communities,\u201d Santa Clara Unit Chief Baraka Carter said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/02/us/grass-fire-evacuation-san-joaquin-tracy-california/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/03/2024", "section": "us"}}

{"id": "2024_06_02_business_spicy-snack-foods-drinks-trend-swicy", "text": "Americans should prepare for a sizzling hot summer, and not just because of rising temperatures. Consumers are bravely opening their palette to bolder, spicier, more fiery flavors and the marketplace for foods and drinks is happily obliging them. Walk into a Walmart, Target, a corner 7-Eleven, pretty much any food store lately that sells packaged food and it\u2019s hard to miss. The snack aisle has gotten spicier. \u201cThe spicy trend is here to stay,\u201d Sally Lyons Wyatt, packaged goods and foodservice industry\u00a0advisor with market research firm Circana, said in an interview with CNN. From chips, popcorn, burgers to ice cream, frozen pizza, alcohol, Starbucks drinks to Coca-Cola, a growing variety of foods and beverage brands are punching up their offerings by adding the spice, bold \u201cswicy\u201d flavor or outright heat. \u201cMy whole motto for a couple of years has been, \u2018The hotter the better,\u2019 because consumers gravitate to it. Traditionally it was younger consumers that were driving this but now we\u2019ve seen bold flavors being embraced by most age groups but the dominant are still younger consumers,\u201d Lyons Wyatt said. The segment of the population firing up demand for fiery flavors, she said, includes younger Millennials, Gen Z and the youngest cohort, Gen Alpha. While it might seem as though we\u2019re surrounded by spiciness in every grocery aisle lately, the start of this trend goes back at least a decade and is well established with spicy flavors in snacking, she said. \u201cBut the proliferation of spiciness across different categories, like beverages, that part is relatively new,\u201d Lyons said. To her point, Coca-Cola in February launched its first new permanent soda flavor addition in years. The flavor it chose: Coca-Cola Spiced. The company told CNN that its own research had surfaced an \u201cincrease in consumer willingness to try a spiced beverage\u201d and \u201cmore bold flavors and more complex flavor profiles\u201d both in food and beverages. The soda giant described the new drink as a blend of the traditional Coke flavor with raspberry and spiced flavors and said it would be available in both full sugar and zero-sugar varieties. First comes spice, then comes \u201cswicy\u201d Starbucks in April came out with a new limited-time spiced up line of its spring lemonade drinks in three flavors \u2014 Spicy Dragonfruit, Spicy Pineapple and Spicy Strawberry, which it said are inspired by the \u201cswicy\u201d trend of creatively combining sweet and spicy flavors. Spicy plus sweet give you \u201cSwicy.\u201d And yes, brands are trying to make it a thing as they look for ways to stretch out the spicy trend. It said the refreshers, targeting Gen Z and Millennials, are punched up by adding Starbucks\u2019 spicy chili powder blend to the concoctions. Starbucks in the spring also introduced limited-time hot honey drinks, made with wildflower honey infused with chili peppers, such as Hot Honey Affogato and Hot Honey Espresso Martini to the menu at its Starbucks Reserve roasteries and select US stores. \u201cI think we are going to see a lot more of this,\u201d said Lyons Wyatt. \u201cThere is a push now and we do see both unit and dollar growth of spicy and swicy products.\u201d Younger, diverse America is spicier According to Circana, dollar sales for food and beverages with \u201cspicy\u201d in the description\u00a0has increased 9% year-over-year. Circana\u2019s latest data also found that 11% of 25 to 34-year-olds enjoy bold and unexpected flavors, up 7 percentage points from 2019 and that 11% of 18 to 34-year-olds enjoy bold and unexpected flavors, up 4.7 percentage points from 2019. Shifting demographics is a big driver for bolder flavor experimentation, industry experts said. The United States has become more racially and ethnically diverse, and as such, sees widening access to more global ingredients and dishes, Jennifer Creevy, director of food and drink at trend forecasting and analytics firm WGSN, said in an interview with CNN. \u201cThe younger generations, Gen Z and Gen Alpha, are also much more global in their outlook than previous generations. To them a chilli crisp or a salsa macha is as much a regular condiment as say a mayo or ketchup,\u201d Creevy said. Increased globalization has also led to more culturally-diverse music, entertainment and gaming become the norm, which in turn influences our food decisions, she said. \u201cTake the rise of K-Drama and K-Pop as an example. Fans of this entertainment want to consume the media but also want to taste the flavors of Korea, hence the rise of spicy Gochujang, which is now in everything from dishes to snacks, drinks and desserts,\u201d she said. Gochujang, a red chili paste, is a popular Korean condiment. Interest is also growing for Vietnamese and African cuisine over the last four years, according to global market research firm Mintel. The pandemic, too, has been an important accelerator of the popularity of spice. \u201cDuring the pandemic and subsequent lockdowns, consumers could not travel and so yearned to taste the cuisines of faraway places,\u201d Creevy said. \u201cThis, coupled with consumers becoming more confident in the kitchen has led to more adventurous tastes. Can our taste buds handle spice as we age? The longevity of spicy and swicy will depend on how committed consumers are to sticking with these flavors as they grow older. \u201cOur tastebuds change as we age. So I\u2019m hesitant to say that it is for everyone all through your life,\u201d said Lyons Wyatt. \u201cIt is being fueled by the younger generation, and enjoyed by all generations, just not at the same degree.\u201d Expect spiciness to expand to other food categories, too. \u201cMore sweet and spicy in confections, in frozen goods, in deli products and more in pizza varieties through the sauces,\u201d she said. Pepsico, which owns the spicy Flamin\u2019 Hot snack and beverage brand, told CNN that in 2023, shoppers in North America made nearly 400 million trips to stores to purchase Flamin\u2019 Hot products, up 31% from the previous year. \u201cFlamin\u2019 Hot is especially popular among younger, more adventurous consumers, who want that hit of intense experience with every bite,\u201d said Mustafa Shamseldin, category growth officer and CMO, International Foods at Pepsico. \u201cWe\u2019ve continued to cultivate the brand to satisfy the expectations of this group and consistently work to bring forward flavors that resonate \u2014 whether they\u2019re looking big flavors with a hint of spice or a full blast of heat.\u201d Nestl\u00e9 USA, which owns the DiGiorno frozen pizza brand, told CNN it\u2019s leaning into the trend with product innovations. Nestl\u00e9 in the spring launched its DiGiorno Thin & Crispy Stuffed Crust Pepperoni Pizza with Mike\u2019s Hot Honey. Nestl\u00e9 also introduced the Tombstone taverrn-style pizza called \u201cthe Primo,\u201d with\u00a0pepperoni, sausage, banana peppers and red onion. Nestl\u00e9 has also trotted out recent spicy innovations such as California Pizza Kitchen\u2019s Hot Honey Croissant Crust Pizza, Stouffer\u2019s Spicy Nacho Mac and Hot Pockets x Hot Ones. \u201cI\u2019d like to challenge the perception that the American palate was ever bland to begin with: red pepper flakes have always been a core part of the pizza experience,\u201d said Varchasvi Singh, food service analyst with Mintel. \u201cAmericans have made cult-favorites out of condiments like Sriracha and hot honey. But there certainly is an expanded appetite for spicy foods and flavors, one that is driven by wanting to explore unfamiliar ingredients and cuisines,\u201d Singh said. \u201cThis enthusiasm isn\u2019t a fad, it is here to stay.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/02/business/spicy-snack-foods-drinks-trend-swicy/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/03/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_01_us_minneapolis-shooting-officer-killed-investigation", "text": "Minneapolis police are searching for motive as they investigate a pair of shootings Thursday night that left two people dead \u2013 including an officer\u00a0hailed as a hero \u2013 and also wounded four others. Minneapolis Officer Jamal Mitchell, 36, was one of two people killed by a gunman who ambushed the officer as he attempted to provide medical assistance to people who were injured, authorities said. The suspect was also killed. Another officer was injured, and authorities later found three other civilians who had been shot, one of whom died at the scene. \u201cThere are not words to appropriately describe this tragedy,\u201d Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O\u2019Hara said Friday morning. \u201cIt\u2019s the worst call a police chief can receive.\u201d A Minneapolis police officer and a firefighter suffered non-life-threatening injuries and have since been treated and released, police said. The other two victims include a person who was shot in his vehicle outside of an apartment and another who was found in an apartment, Minneapolis police said. They were still in the hospital Friday afternoon. Across the country, the US has suffered at least 180 mass shootings in just the first five months of this year, according to the\u00a0Gun Violence Archive. Like CNN, the archive defines a mass shooting as one in which four or more people are shot, not including the shooter. And in the first four months of this year, at least 136 officers have been shot in the line of duty \u2013 including 20 who were killed, according to the National Fraternal Order of Police. \u201cThis cannot be the norm,\u201d Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said Thursday night. Here\u2019s what we know about the killings and the investigation so far: How police say the shootings unfolded Police initially responded to a call about two people shot at an apartment building in Minneapolis\u2019 Whittier neighborhood around 5:15 p.m. Thursday. When officers arrived, someone shot at them immediately, and the officers returned fire, Assistant Police Chief Katie Blackwell said. As Mitchell neared the scene of the double shooting, he spotted injured individuals nearby who were in need of medical assistance, Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension Superintendent Drew Evans said at a press conference Thursday night. While aiding the injured male suspect, the suspect pulled out a gun and continued to shoot Mitchell after he fell to the ground, police said in a news release Friday. The officer was shot about a block and a half to two blocks away from the apartment, authorities said Thursday night. Mitchell was taken to a local hospital where he later died. Witness Reuben Molina was watching TV with his girlfriend in a third-floor apartment when he heard a \u201cbang.\u201d \u201cThen we heard it again and again and again in rapid succession, and then me and her were like, \u2018Oh, that\u2019s gunshots,\u2019\u201d Molina told CNN affiliate WCCO. He said he thought the sounds came from the floor below them. Molina said they left the apartment to see what was happening. He told WCCO he kept hearing gunshots and saw \u201cpeople shooting,\u201d but couldn\u2019t tell whether those opening fire were officers or civilians. It\u2019s still unclear exactly how many officers exchanged fire with the suspect, as authorities have given differing accounts. \u201cWhen officers arrived, they received gunfire immediately and they exchanged gunfire,\u201d Blackwell said. In a news release Friday, the department likewise said: \u201cResponding officers exchanged gunfire with that gunman.\u201d But Evans said only one officer exchanged gunfire with the suspect. \u201cA second officer, I should note, arrived shortly after officer Mitchell was injured and shot and exchanged gunfire with the subject at that time,\u201d Evans said Thursday night. \u201cHe was injured in that gunfire exchange.\u201d CNN has reached out to the Minneapolis Police Department and the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension for more information. Officer was ambushed trying to help suspect In his final moments Thursday, Mitchell was trying to render first aid to those who had been injured, authorities said. One of the people he was trying to help turned out to be the gunman who would kill him, authorities said. \u201cMitchell was attempting to assist the individual that shot him,\u201d Evans said. \u201cIt happened very fast \u2026 he ambushed him.\u201d Mitchell, who was engaged to be married, is now being remembered for his courage and love for the job. Just three days after he was sworn in to the police department in 2023, Mitchell rushed into a burning, smoke-filled house with another officer to rescue an elderly couple. The rookie Minneapolis cop told CNN he didn\u2019t hesitate to go in. \u201cWe\u2019re not trained to run into fires, but we are trained to put others\u2019 lives in front of ours,\u201d Mitchell told CNN last year. \u201cSo when we found out possibly that someone was in that house, we didn\u2019t second guess running in.\u201d Mitchell \u201cwas a hero, a son, a father, a fianc\u00e9 and an officer who is so deeply committed to protecting and serving,\u201d Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said at a press conference Thursday night. \u201cHe would run towards danger when the rest of us would run in the other direction,\u201d the mayor added. Even though he was a Minneapolis officer for less than two years, Mitchell made a profound impact on the department. \u201cI\u2019ve never met an officer that received an award on the third day on the job,\u201d Blackwell said. \u201cWe will honor his sacrifice. We will remember his name,\u201d the mayor said. \u201cWe will never forget what he did for the people of our city.\u201d Police now looking for more information While police said they believe they know who the suspect was, homicide detectives are trying to determine the motive as it remains unclear what prompted the gunfire. Forensic scientists are collecting evidence, and the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension is working with Minneapolis police to help determine the circumstances surrounding the shooting deaths. Authorities said Friday they are still working on piecing together a timeline for the incident that unfolded. Investigators are working to determine the exact circumstances of how Mitchell was killed, O\u2019Hara said Friday. The Hennepin County Medical Examiner will release the names of the deceased suspect and civilian, and the cause and nature of their deaths. \u201cMore details will emerge in the coming days and weeks,\u201d police said in a news release Friday. \u201cWe have crime scene investigators out at the different locations right now,\u201d Evans said at a press conference Thursday night. \u201cAnd we have dozens of agents out working to meet with witnesses, canvass the area, gather additional information.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/01/us/minneapolis-shooting-officer-killed-investigation/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/03/2024", "section": "us"}}

{"id": "2024_06_02_politics_senate-democrats-reelection-biden-ads", "text": "Democrats locked in competitive Senate races are leaning into their party\u2019s legislative accomplishments in ads touting investments in infrastructure and manufacturing, as well as the lowering the cost of some prescription drugs, such as insulin. The senators, whose votes sent the bills to the White House, are front and center. But one name is often missing: President Joe Biden, who signed the bills into law. In an election in which most Democrats will be running on reproductive rights and contrasts with Republican leadership, senators such as Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin and Bob Casey of Pennsylvania are emphasizing their roles in advancing key parts of the Biden agenda without mentioning the president. For incumbents, these recent ads are an opportunity to remind voters of their track records. But the spots also highlight the balancing act they\u2019ll have to perform to win crossover votes from independents and Republicans who won\u2019t back Biden. \u201cThey\u2019re following the opinion of their voters,\u201d said Ron Bonjean, a Republican strategist. \u201cThese are Democrats who are in swing states where they need to appeal to voters that don\u2019t like Biden, that are maybe pro-Trump voters.\u201d Democrats will need to defend seven competitive seats \u2013 including five in presidential battlegrounds \u2013 and win the White House to maintain the majority in the Senate. Sen. Joe Manchin\u2019s announced retirement has likely taken West Virginia out of contention for Democrats, and Sens. Sherrod Brown of Ohio and Jon Tester of Montana are seeking reelection in states Trump won by 8 and 16 points, respectively. In the Blue Wall states \u2013 considered must-wins for Biden \u2013 Democrats are defending Baldwin and Casey and an open seat in Michigan. Part of Democrats\u2019 challenge will be defining their record before Republicans can. GOP groups plan to blame inflation on the American Rescue Plan \u2013 Biden\u2019s Covid-19 economic recovery package \u2013 and argue the Inflation Reduction Act, which provided millions in funding for health care and climate change initiatives, didn\u2019t live up to its name. Republicans will also, of course, seek to tie Senate candidates to Biden. \u201cAll of these Senate Democrats endorsed Joe Biden and voted for his agenda more than 90% of the time \u2013 so they\u2019ll be appearing with Biden in campaign ads whether they like it or not,\u201d Mike Berg, spokesperson for the National Republican Senatorial Committee, said in a statement. Polls show Senate Democratic candidates running ahead of Biden, who has been plagued by low approval ratings and who trails or ties Trump in key states. For months, Democrats have argued the president\u2019s support will grow as voters tune in closer to the election and learn more about his agenda. The Biden campaign pointed to the midterm elections in 2022, when Democrats fought off an expected red wave, as evidence that the president\u2019s agenda is a boon to down-ballot candidates. \u201cFrom lowering drug prices to defending our reproductive rights, President Biden\u2019s record won at the ballot box in 2022 and it will win again in 2024,\u201d Biden campaign spokesperson Seth Schuster said in a statement. There are signs that voters aren\u2019t broadly aware of Democrats\u2019 record. A KFF poll from May found that 52% of registered voters older than 65 were aware the Inflation Reduction Act capped the cost of insulin for Medicare recipients at $35 per month. An AP-NORC poll from April found that about a third of voters didn\u2019t know enough about the Inflation Reduction Act to say whether it had made a difference on climate change, the economy or inflation. \u201cWhether it\u2019s Sen. Casey or any other senator running \u2013 or, quite frankly, Joe Biden \u2013 they should be talking about these major pieces of legislation that they pass,\u201d said Mike Mikus, a Pennsylvania-based Democratic strategist. \u201cOne, because it\u2019s good for this country. But two, and more importantly, voters agree with what they did.\u201d Millions in ads In a recent ad dubbed \u201cEngine,\u201d Casey highlights the CHIPS and Science Act, one of Biden\u2019s biggest legislative wins. The measure, which passed Congress with bipartisan support in the summer of 2022, is aimed at boosting semiconductor manufacturing in the US. \u201cNinety percent of our advanced semiconductor chips were being made in Asia, creating havoc in our supply chains and raising costs,\u201d Casey says in the spot. \u201cThat\u2019s why I worked with Republicans and Democrats to pass the CHIPS and Science Act to produce our own chips right here in America.\u201d Casey, along with Tester and Brown, has also aired ads on his work to pass legislation to help veterans affected by burn pits. \u201cBy highlighting Pennsylvanians\u2019 shared core values, Senator Casey will continue to earn every vote and support Democrats up and down the ballot,\u201d Maddy McDaniel, a spokesperson for Casey, said in a statement. Baldwin, meanwhile, went up with an ad promoting another major piece of Biden record, the Inflation Reduction Act\u2019s insulin cost cap. The ad says that Baldwin \u201cstood up to the drug companies and wrote a law capping the cost of insulin\u201d and that \u201cthanks to Tammy, now it just costs $35 a month.\u201d Andrew Mamo, a spokesperson for Baldwin\u2019s campaign, said the campaign\u2019s ads were meant to highlight the work the senator has\u00a0done over the years. Her first reelection ad spotlighted her proposals to promote American manufacturing, which the ad notes were signing into law by both Trump and Biden. Others have focused on a bill to crack down on illicit fentanyl entering the US that she co-sponsored. \u201cVoters aren\u2019t looking for you to change the world, but they\u2019re looking for you to make their lives better. \u2026 And that\u2019s what our ads show that Tammy\u2019s doing,\u201d Mamo said. Ben Wikler, the chair of the Wisconsin Democratic Party, said he believes Democrats\u2019 unified messaging on abortion, democracy and the contrast with Trump will help all party candidates on the ballot in the state. In addition to reelecting Biden and Baldwin, Wisconsin Democrats hope to gain ground in the state Legislature. \u201cHaving multiple Democrats communicating in multiple ways in multiple places at any given moment about that same vision, agenda and set of values \u2013 that\u2019s what creates the harmony\u00a0you need to make sure that the tune carries,\u201d Wikler said. At times, the candidates communicate the message on the same stage. In January, Baldwin appeared with Biden in her home state at an official event highlighting infrastructure bill funding that will replace a bridge connecting Wisconsin to Minnesota. Last week, after Casey appeared with Biden in Philadelphia as the president visited the state to appeal to Black voters, the senator\u2019s GOP opponent, Dave McCormick, knocked Casey for voting with Biden 98.5% of the time. The ad wars in both states are just getting started. Keystone Renewal, a super PAC supporting McCormick, announced Thursday that it plans to spend an additional $30 million on the race. The group has already spent $3.6 million on ads boosting McCormick\u2019s profile and slamming the Biden administration\u2019s management of the southern border. And as Baldwin went on the air with her insulin ad, her likely Republican opponent, businessman Eric Hovde, released an ad focused on inflation and high prices. \u201cCareer politicians like Biden and Baldwin just don\u2019t get it,\u201d Hovde says as he walks down a grocery store aisle lined with condiments and canned goods. \u201cThey\u2019re making things harder for folks here in Wisconsin.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/02/politics/senate-democrats-reelection-biden-ads/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/03/2024", "section": "us"}}

Companies that offer bargains and staples are reaping the rewards. Just ask Ross Stores: America\u2019s largest off-price retailer reported earnings and revenue that beat analysts\u2019 forecasts last week. Company executives said they\u2019re planning on opening about 90 new stores this year. \u201cThere\u2019s clearly a lot of uncertainty in the macroeconomy,\u201d Adam Orvos, executive vice president and chief financial officer at Ross Stores, said in an earnings call. \u201cThe silver lining for our business is the customer is seeking value more than ever, and we\u2019re in a position to deliver that.\u201d TJX,\u00a0the parent of TJ Maxx, Marshalls and HomeGoods stores, has also benefited. The company recently reported strong revenue in its latest quarter and is also planning to expand its physical footprint \u2014 by more than 1,300 stores in North America, Europe and Australia. And Dollar General last week beat Wall Street\u2019s estimates for sales and reported increased foot traffic in the first quarter. In contrast, high-end retailers such as Burberry have been sounding the alarm of a broad slowdown in luxury spending. The British luxury chain reported last month that its profits plummeted by 40% in the budget year ending in late March, with comparable store sales in the Americas declining 12% over the year. LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton has reported that demand for expensive liquors is down sharply in the US. \u201cYou\u2019re seeing a pullback from consumers on the more discretionary-spending side of things,\u201d Clayton Allison, portfolio manager at\u00a0Prime Capital Investment Advisors, told CNN. Allison said US consumers\u2019 more cautious stance will be a boon for retailers that sell essentials such as groceries. For example, Walmart posted higher-than-expected revenue for the first three months of the year. The country\u2019s biggest retailer said that higher-income consumers are flocking to its store in search of bargains. \u201cCustomers are now making sure they buckle down where they\u2019re spending their money, so that will be a tailwind for those more staple-oriented retailers,\u201d Allison added. Fast food deals were off the table. Now they\u2019re roaring back For years, restaurant executives had a confident message for investors: We\u2019re raising prices, and customers don\u2019t care. Well, now diners do \u2014 and fast food chains, especially, are rapidly changing course.Frustrated diners are\u00a0complaining online about how expensive\u00a0fast food has become. Low-income consumers in particular are dining out less often, and\u00a0spending less when they do. For some fast food restaurants, that means slowing sales and less foot traffic. To win people back, these chains are returning to a strategy they tried to leave behind: Discounts. Read more here. Up Next Monday:\u00a0Earnings from GitLab.

{"id": "2024_06_02_us_world-war-two-remains-dna-research-identify", "text": "Minutes before plunging to their deaths, five airmen successfully dropped 14 paratroopers from the 82nd Airborne near their landing mark over Normandy, France from their C-47. It was just after 2:44 a.m. on June 6, 1944. The airmen completed their mission but lost their lives. The remains of the pilot and crew chief were recovered days later but the co-pilot, navigator and radio operator were never found \u2013 possibly until now. Eighty years after the Normandy Invasion known as D-Day, the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency, operating under the Department of Defense, is looking for the three missing airmen with the hope of finally bringing them home. They have found what is believed to be the crash site of the downed C-47, along with the possible remains of the co-pilot, 2nd Lieutenant William Donohue; the radio operator, Staff Sergeant David Madson and the navigator, 2nd Lieutenant Albert Brooks. The remaining three airmen from the 304th Troop Carrier Squadron, 442nd Troop Carrier Group, 50th Troop Carrier Wing were never accounted for but never forgotten. Crew flies mission over France D-Day was the pivotal moment of the war in Europe to tip the balance in favor of the Allied Forces. Commonly referred to as \u201cthe beginning of the end\u201d of World War II, Dr. Eric Klinek, a historian with the agency, said it was the first major attack to move American forces into German-held territory following years of pressure from President Franklin D. Roosevelt to do so. The 101st and 82nd Airborne Divisions led the airborne assault in the earliest stages of Operation Overlord, which included more than 160,000 Allied troops landing along the beaches of Normandy to fight Nazi Germany. Paratroopers were instrumental in getting behind enemy lines to cut off German supply routes and expand Allied capability to take over terrestrial targets. If they survived their jump, they would fight on the ground as infantrymen for as long as it took to complete the mission. Their mode of transportation was the C-47, a military version of the civilian DC-3 airplane. Taking off from England at 11 p.m. on June 5 and crossing the English Channel, the 101st and 82nd Airborne Divisions were to be dropped behind Utah Beach a few hours before the naval invasion, Dr. Klinek said. On the morning of D-Day, there were 821 C-47s carrying more than 13,000 soldiers from the 101st and 82nd Airborne Divisions. Eighteen of them were shot down. Due to poor weather, communication interference and unexpected enemy fire, many of the troop drops were scattered. \u201cSome landed in their drop zones and others landed miles away. If a plane got hit, the best option was for the paratroopers to jump wherever they could,\u201d Dr. Klinek said. Faced with German anti-aircraft fire from an altitude of less than 1,200 feet, Donohue, Madson and Brooks, along with their fellow airmen: the crew chief, Major McKinley McCanless; and the pilot, 1st Lieutenant Samuel Williams Jr., did not have enough time to bail out or maneuver a successful crash landing after dropping their paratroopers. French eyewitnesses say their C-47 \u201cstruck the ground and burst into flames,\u201d killing all five men, according to agency records. A crash site rediscovered In 2016, the agency received a tip the crash site had been rediscovered on farmland in Normandy. They sent a team in 2019 to evaluate the site and what they found was \u201cpart of an air speed indicator and part of a C-47 load adjuster,\u201d Dr. Klinek said, who was part of the initial evaluation on the ground. \u201cWe knew based on all the evidence from the French researchers to all the documents we had that this was the plane,\u201d he said. Dr. Klinek said the agency only pursues crash sites where missing soldiers could be found, so they launched an excavation site on April 12 with the goal of retrieving every possible piece of wreckage or evidence of human remains. At the excavation site, a team of 25 people conducted labor-intensive work every day for six weeks straight. Using an excavator and shovels to create dozens of grids, they swept the area for high concentrations of metal, then pressure washed and sifted every square inch of soil capable of containing even the smallest piece of evidence. \u201cWe actually hit the ground running with findings,\u201d Capt. Brian Foxworth, the search team leader, said. From potential life support items such as \u201cparachute buckles, fragments of headsets, and standard issue flashlights that every service member would be issued and carry on their person,\u201d Foxworth explained, to \u201cpossible osseous material.\u201d Osseous material includes anything related to human remains, Foxworth explained. \u201cWhether it\u2019s bone fragment to teeth, anything that you could potentially link to a person that could provide a DNA sample or provide what\u2019s needed to match up dental records, all of those things, that\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to pull back with us to the lab.\u201d Foxworth and the agency emphasize the word \u201cpossible\u201d with everything they find to maintain extreme precision and a cautious respect for families who have waited for decades to learn about the whereabouts of their loved ones\u2019 remains. Even when excavators are certain about specific items, everything must be sent to an agency lab for proper forensic testing before anything can be verified or concluded. \u201cEverything is possible,\u201d Master Sergeant Raul Castillo, the team\u2019s life support investigator, said. Holding a shining key-shaped metal object on a cloth next to five small items caked with dirt, Castillo said, \u201cWe found this on the surface and it\u2019s in a pretty good state, it\u2019s part of a headset \u2026 it\u2019s all possible from aircrew members \u2026 we won\u2019t know until we get back.\u201d Castillo\u2019s role is to identify each object being pulled from the ground, some of which may have been life support equipment assigned to the flight crew or paratroopers on the C-47. He was able to confirm each item uncovered so far had been from the 1940s. Searching wreckage for a link The excavation team wrapped up their work at the dig site at the end of May. All uncovered items are being transferred to an agency laboratory at Offutt Air Force Base in Nebraska, where they will be cataloged and tested by a team of forensic scientists led by Carrie Brown, lab manager and forensic anthropologist. \u201cA lot of times with these recoveries from Europe \u2026 especially if they have been in the ground for 80 years, you\u2019re getting fragments of bone,\u201d Brown said. She said bones found in Europe are generally well-preserved. \u201cNon-biological items such as watches, boots, ID tags, jewelry, those types of things, would get an analyst,\u201d Brown said, explaining items such as teeth and skeletal material would be separated, inventoried and assigned to analysts as well. To test for DNA samples, Brown said a minimum of one gram of dense bone is needed. The results are then compared to a DNA sample from the missing service member\u2019s medical file. \u201cIn order to make that identification, you have to get both sides to match up. If I don\u2019t have any dental records or medical records or a DNA sample \u2013 it doesn\u2019t matter how much really great data I can collect from what I have in the lab \u2013 I can never match those up,\u201d Brown said. The agency is responsible for doing background research, getting excavation teams out to the field, and conducting lab analysis. The best quality DNA samples are sent to the Armed Forces Medical Examiner System\u2019s DNA identification lab at Dover Air Force Base in Delaware to confirm the identification. Once confirmed, the Army Past Conflict Repatriation Branch connects with family members to collect reference samples to potentially match the DNA. It can take up to a year and a half from conducting the field recovery to making a positive identification. Brown described herself and her team as civil servants dedicated to returning their nation\u2019s fallen. Though the processes can be grueling, and each case may have its own obstacles along the way, \u201cYou can\u2019t get past that human component,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019ve put all these pieces together and now it links up with a person with a story.\u201d Brown said the first thing guests see when they enter the DPAA lab is the part of the Soldier\u2019s Creed, which says, \u201cI will never leave a fallen comrade.\u201d \u201cIt says everything about us as a nation, it says we are not going to give up. And if you\u2019ve fallen overseas, we are going to keep searching for you no matter what it takes,\u201d she said. Reconnecting across generations The families of Donohue, Madson and Brooks have been notified by the agency they are currently looking for their loved ones\u2019 remains, and the process may take time. The agency meets with families of missing service members throughout the year at Family Member Updates to brief relatives about their specific cases and answer any questions people may have about recovery efforts. Paul Stouffer knows firsthand the impact the agency has on families of fallen soldiers who are searching for answers about their loved ones. He is the nephew of a World War II fighter pilot named Lieutenant William McGowan, who was shot down on D-Day in a P-47 single-engine fighter aircraft. McGowan was only 23 years old when he died, and Stouffer spent his whole life watching his mother and grandparents pursue details about his death, and where his remains could have possibly ended up. After the war, the American Graves Registration Service located the P-47 crash site but did not find McGowan\u2019s remains at the time. His name was engraved on the Wall of the Missing at the Normandy American cemetery. In 2009, Stouffer heard about other missing service members being accounted for and reached out to the agency to offer his DNA samples for analysis. In 2018, the agency excavated his uncle\u2019s crash site and recovered human remains, which were identified the following year as McGowan. Stouffer attended his burial service at the American Cemetery in Normandy in 2022 and gave the eulogy for an uncle he had always dreamed about, but never met. \u201cIt was the phone call that I wish my grandparents had got, or even later, I wish my mom had been alive for that moment as well,\u201d Stouffer said. \u201cOne of the things that really stuck with me is knowing that after my mother was gone, that he would not be forgotten.\u201d Stouffer watched during the burial ceremony in Normandy as a rosette was placed on the Wall of the Missing next to McGowan\u2019s name, signifying that he had been found. If ye break faith with us who die, we shall not sleep World War II still has 72,000 American soldiers who are unaccounted for, according to the agency. It\u2019s conducting operations year-round in 45 countries, working to recover the remains of fallen U.S. soldiers and uphold the promise of the United States Military to \u201cleave no man behind.\u201d The agency handles each case of a missing person with dignity and respect for those who gave their lives for their country. They work under strict protocols and protective processes to ensure they get every detail correct, leaving no grain of sand unsifted. When missing service members are identified, the agency gives family members the option to have the remains buried with full military honors back home, or to receive the same honors in a burial abroad where they died. Photos of the three missing airmen were stationed at the dig site, providing what the team calls intrinsic motivation along their search. Foxworth said after 17 years in the Air Force, this was one of his most important missions. He has been on other recovery efforts with the agency, but says this operation hits a little closer to home. \u201cWe sign the dotted line knowing what that means. It may require us sacrificing our own lives. One of the mottoes we have is we\u2019ll never leave an airman behind, so this is us fulfilling that obligation. And it\u2019s an obligation that I\u2019m extremely lucky to be a part of,\u201d Foxworth said. \u201cNo matter how long it takes\u2026 we won\u2019t stop. We\u2019ll keep searching.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/02/us/world-war-two-remains-dna-research-identify/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/03/2024", "section": "us"}}

Search and rescue crews continue to search for the second\u00a0canoeist, Reis Grams, 40, of Lino Lakes, Minnesota. He has been missing for nearly two weeks. The St. Louis County Sheriff\u2019s Office was first dispatched to Iron Lake near the border of Canada at 7:21 p.m. on May 18, according to a news release. Two canoes had gone over Curtain Falls in the Boundary Waters Canoe Area, the sheriff\u2019s office said. One canoeist was badly injured and two were missing. Shortly after midnight, a helicopter was used to rescue one injured person and one uninjured person, according to the sheriff\u2019s office. The injured person was flown to a hospital with \u201cserious but not life-threatening injuries,\u201d the sheriff\u2019s office said. \u201cFriends, two families and a wide circle of friends are devastated tonight by the events at Curtain Falls,\u201d the St. Louis County Rescue Squad said in a Facebook post Sunday evening. Search efforts have been hampered by \u201cmany challenges and setbacks,\u201d including \u201csketchy and unreliable\u201d cell phone and radio communication, according to the Facebook post. Rescuers worked all evening \u201cuntil it was too dark to see, and are sleeping on the ground tonight\u201d to continue searching first thing in the morning, the post said. The search effort includes remotely-operated vehicles and drones, according to the sheriff\u2019s office. \u201cCurtain Falls is extremely difficult to access, and we are depending heavily on our aviation partners to transport equipment, supplies, and personnel in and out of the backcountry,\u201d added the rescue group. Earlier this month, another canoeist was found dead in Lake Agnes in the Boundary Waters Canoe Area, according to a news release from the St. Louis County Sheriff\u2019s Office. St. Louis is located on Minnesota\u2019s border with Ontario, Canada.

{"id": "2024_06_02_business_opec-oil-production-cuts-2025", "text": "The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies \u2014\u202fa group of leading oil producers known as OPEC+ \u2014 agreed Sunday to extend a voluntary production cut of 2.2 million barrels of crude oil a day into 2025. The cuts, first agreed in December, were due to expire at the end of this month. They came on top of previously agreed reductions of 3.66 million barrels per day announced in 2022 and 2023 as the group \u2014 led by Saudi Arabia and Russia \u2014 tried to counter slowing demand and rising output from the United States. The group also released its 2025 production requirements for member and nonmember countries, which were essentially the same as this year\u2019s. The United Arab Emirates\u2019 production quota increased by 300,000 barrels per day. The uptick \u201cwill be phased in gradually\u201d from January through September 2025, the group said. Despite the OPEC+ cuts, equivalent to about 5.7% of global crude supply, and ongoing tensions in the Middle East, global oil prices have fallen by about 10% since hitting a five-month high in early April. The price of Brent crude, the global oil benchmark, traded at $82 a barrel on Friday, down from $91 in early April when a suspected Israeli airstrike on Iran\u2019s embassy in Syria sent jitters through oil markets. The price of West Texas Intermediate crude, the US benchmark, has dropped from nearly $87 per barrel to $78. Saudi Arabia needs Brent crude to trade at around $81 a barrel in order to balance its budget, according to the International Monetary Fund. Subdued prices have partly been the result of record US oil output, which has bumped up global supply, and concerns about sluggish demand in China \u2014\u202fthe world\u2019s biggest importer of oil \u2014\u202fand other major economies. In its most recent monthly report, the International Energy Agency cut its forecast for the growth in global oil demand this year by 140,000 barrels per day to 1.1 million barrels per day, citing weak demand in developed economies, particularly in Europe. Despite the weaker growth forecast, a supply crunch could develop. The IEA expects global supply to increase by just 580,000 barrels per day this year. In March, the Paris-based agency said it expected there to be a deficit in supply in 2024 if OPEC+ extended its output cuts through the rest of the year. Sunday\u2019s OPEC+ decision coincides with Saudi Arabia selling some more shares in its oil company Aramco. The government is selling less than 1% of the Riyadh-listed company in a deal that could raise $13 billion for economic diversification projects.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/02/business/opec-oil-production-cuts-2025/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/03/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_05_31_us_jennifer-dulos-murder-michelle-troconis-sentencing", "text": "Five years after Connecticut mother of five Jennifer Dulos went missing, her husband\u2019s ex-girlfriend was sentenced to 14-and-a-half years in prison Friday for conspiring to murder her. Michelle Troconis, the ex-girlfriend of Fotis Dulos, who was charged with his wife\u2019s\u00a0murder\u00a0but\u00a0died by an apparent suicide\u00a0in January 2020 before he went to trial, was also sentenced to five years of probation for her involvement in the disappearance and murder of Jennifer Dulos. Troconis was found guilty in March of one count of conspiracy to commit murder, one count of hindering prosecution, two counts of conspiracy to commit tampering with physical evidence and two counts of tampering with physical evidence. She had pleaded not guilty. After Troconis received her sentence, her attorney told the court they intended to appeal. Troconis had dated Fotis Dulos, who was charged with murder, felony murder and kidnapping before he was found dead in January 2020. Jennifer Dulos\u00a0was last seen in May 2019\u00a0after dropping her children off at school. Friends reported her missing after she failed to show up for appointments and had no communication with them for 10 hours.\u00a0She was in the middle of a contentious divorce and custody battle with Fotis Dulos at the time of her disappearance, CNN has previously reported. Despite her body never being found, Dulos was officially pronounced dead through a declaration of death by a Connecticut judge in October 2023, a court document shows. She likely suffered a combination of\u00a0\u201ctraumatic, blunt-force injuries,\u201d\u00a0according to the state\u2019s chief medical examiner. Authorities found a bloodlike stain in three places on her vehicle, which was parked in her garage in New Canaan. Her DNA was found in the stains and on the garage wall and door. Both Fotis Dulos and Troconis were previously arrested on suspicion of evidence tampering in the disappearance. They pleaded not guilty to evidence tampering after investigators found a \u201cbloodlike substance\u201d with Jennifer Dulos\u2019 DNA in a truck he had access to the day she disappeared. Jennifer Dulos had told officials she was afraid of him before her disappearance, according to court documents obtained by CNN. \u201cI know that filing for divorce and filing this motion will enrage him,\u201d she said, according to the documents. \u201cI know he will retaliate by trying to harm me in some way.\u201d \u2018She was the best mom\u2019 During Troconis\u2019 sentencing Friday, Dulos\u2019 loved ones were present in court and gave emotional victim impact statements. \u201cThe day Jennifer disappeared, I knew something terrible had happened,\u201d Gloria Farber, Jennifer\u00a0Dulos\u2019 mother, said during her victim impact statement. \u201cI loved Jennifer since the day she was born,\u201d Melissa Farber, Jennifer\u00a0Dulos\u2019 sister, said during her victim impact statement. \u201cI miss Jennifer\u2019s intelligence, her soft, sweet voice, and the sound of her laughter. There are really no words to adequately express what losing my sister, Jennifer, has meant to me.\u201d Troconis\u00a0appeared to be upset during several of the victim impact statements. \u201cMy mother was the best mom I could ever ask for. She loved me and my\u00a0siblings\u00a0unconditionally,\u201d Theodore\u00a0Dulos, Jennifer\u00a0Dulos\u2019\u00a0son, said during his\u00a0victim impact statement. \u201cI no longer have my mother, my hero. I\u2019ll never talk to her again\u2026 I\u2019ll never ask her for advice again.\u201d \u201cShe will never see me graduate high school. She will never see me graduate college. She\u2019ll never see me get married,\u201d Theodore said. \u201cThese are just a few things, and they go for my four siblings as well.\u201d Before her sentencing,\u00a0Troconis\u00a0stood up and addressed the court. \u201cI am deeply saddened by this tragedy that has affected so many lives. I found out things before and during the trial about a man, Fotis\u00a0Dulos, I thought I knew and loved.\u201d \u201cI deeply regret ever being in a relationship with Fotis\u00a0Dulos\u00a0and bringing my daughter, my family and myself into our lives, into this life,\u201d\u00a0Troconis\u00a0said.

{"id": "2024_06_02_politics_hunter-biden-trial-preview", "text": "Hunter Biden is set to stand trial Monday on felony gun charges in a historic case that could impact President Joe Biden\u2019s reelection campaign. This is the first time in American history that the child of the sitting president is going on trial. The indictment was brought by the Justice Department, specifically by David Weiss, the special counsel appointed last year to oversee the Hunter Biden probes. Hunter Biden, 54, is accused of illegally purchasing and possessing a gun while abusing or being addicted to drugs, a violation of federal law. He pleaded not guilty to the three charges, though he has been open about\u00a0his struggles\u00a0with alcohol and crack cocaine addiction. The trial could last one to two weeks and is taking place in Wilmington, Delaware. What are the charges? The first two charges in the\u00a0three-count indictment\u00a0are tied to the gun purchase itself. When a person buys a gun, they must fill out a form with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and affirm that they are legally allowed to buy the weapon. Hunter Biden has been charged with lying on those forms. These questions include: Have you been convicted of a felony? Are you a fugitive? Are you in the country unlawfully? And, importantly for this case, are you an \u201cunlawful user of, or addicted to\u201d illegal drugs? Hunter Biden allegedly\u00a0checked the box\u00a0that said, \u201cNo.\u201d Count 3 relates to the possession of the gun. It\u2019s also against federal law to possess a gun if you are abusing drugs. Hunter Biden had the gun for 11 days in October 2018, before his girlfriend threw it in a dumpster because she was worried about his mental health, according to the indictment and texts made public in recent court filings. \u201cGuns present a danger if they get in the wrong hands, and that\u2019s the impetus behind these laws,\u201d Nabeel Kibria, a Washington, DC-based defense attorney who has handled hundreds of gun cases, told CNN. \u201cThe evidence seems pretty stacked against Hunter \u2026 but who determines who is an addict? What are the bright-line rules that must be followed?\u201d Who are the witnesses? Prosecutors have said they plan to call about a dozen witnesses for their case. Most notably, they\u2019ve\u00a0lined up testimony\u00a0from three of Hunter Biden\u2019s former romantic partners to testify about his drug use around the time he bought the gun. This includes his ex-wife,\u00a0Kathleen Buhle; his late brother\u2019s widow,\u00a0Hallie Biden, whom Hunter Biden later dated; and\u00a0Lunden Roberts, the mother of one of his children. Their testimony could bring to life a period that Hunter Biden has described as his rock bottom, during which he was almost always on drugs or trying to get drugs. At his attempted plea hearing last year, Hunter Biden testified that he has been sober since May 2019. \u201cHe\u2019s going to experience stress and shame at the trial,\u201d said Valerie Earnshaw, a social psychology professor at the University of Delaware who researches the stigmas surrounding addiction. \u201cIt depends on his own recovery journey, but there could be days where he experiences a lot of shame. It\u2019s a toxic emotion that eats you up. It does not motivate healthy behaviors.\u201d Hunter Biden\u2019s lawyers said they might call an expert who can tell the jury about how people with addictions understand their own struggles. His team also has a forensic chemist who could testify about a white residue on his gun pouch that prosecutors say testified positive for cocaine when it was analyzed by the FBI in 2023. Who are the prosecutors? The case was initiated by Weiss, the former Donald Trump-appointed US attorney in Delaware. Attorney General Merrick Garland\u00a0elevated\u00a0Weiss to special counsel status last year, after a proposed plea deal with Hunter Biden\u00a0blew up\u00a0in spectacular fashion. Hunter Biden\u2019s lawyers claimed Weiss only sought the indictment because he caved to a relentless pressure campaign from Republican lawmakers and the former president. Weiss\u00a0panned\u00a0this theory as a \u201cfiction designed for a Hollywood script,\u201d and the judge overseeing the gun case\u00a0concluded the allegations were \u201cnonsensical under the facts here.\u201d But many Republicans have criticized Weiss, claiming he offered Hunter Biden a \u201csweetheart deal\u201d last year that would have\u00a0resolved\u00a0the gun matter and ended a tax probe with a misdemeanor-only plea. (Legal experts\u00a0told CNN at the time that the proposed deal was reasonable.) Who is the judge? District Judge Maryellen Noreika is presiding over the case. A former patent lawyer, she had the support of Delaware\u2019s two Democratic senators when she was appointed by Trump. The Senate\u00a0confirmed her nomination\u00a0with a unanimous voice vote in 2018. She oversaw last summer\u2019s dramatic hearing during which both sides asked her to approve a plea deal. But she balked and uncovered through tough questioning that there were grave differences between the parties about the scope of the deal. That hearing ended without a resolution, and the plea discussions later collapsed. That\u2019s when Garland named Weiss as special counsel. Noreika\u2019s no-nonsense approach has kept the proceedings moving in a steady fashion. She rejected Hunter Biden\u2019s attempts to toss the case or derail the prosecution but has sided with him on several key\u00a0evidentiary questions. Could Hunter Biden go to prison? If convicted on all three counts, the president\u2019s son could face up to 25 years in prison. However, he doesn\u2019t have a prior criminal record, and first-time offenders often get much lower sentences than the maximum. His punishment would be solely up to Noreika. These are federal charges, so Joe Biden has the power to pardon his son at any time. If his son is convicted, the president could also commute the sentence, sparing him from the levied punishment. The White House has\u00a0explicitly ruled out\u00a0the possibility of a pardon, but that political calculus could change after the November election. Has this ever happened before? This is a historic moment for the United States and the history of the presidency. No president has ever tried to run the country while watching his own child go on trial. Over the decades, there are plenty of examples of presidential family members getting in trouble. George H. W. Bush\u2019s son\u00a0faced civil penalties\u00a0for violating banking laws while his father was serving in the White House. \u00a0Jimmy Carter\u2019s\u00a0brother\u00a0was scrutinized for his foreign lobbying. But nothing has sunk to the level of a criminal trial. CNN presidential historian Douglas Brinkley said that \u201cthere\u2019s always somebody considered a black sheep in the presidential family\u201d but that Hunter Biden\u2019s sprawling legal issues \u201ccut unusually close to the bone because it\u2019s the president\u2019s son.\u201d \u201cThis trial is an albatross around President Biden\u2019s neck and weighs very heavily on his psyche,\u201d Brinkley said. \u201cFor any parent to watch their child go through addiction, and now face possible jail time, it\u2019s harrowing. You would hope that family would be his comfort zone. But in this case, family is probably his biggest worry of the moment.\u201d The family ties have also led to some intriguing divergences between father and son. There is a\u00a0separate court battle\u00a0over the constitutionality of the law that makes it illegal for drug users to own a gun. The Biden administration is defending the law and wants the Supreme Court to take up the matter. But Hunter Biden\u2019s team argued in his case \u2013\u00a0unsuccessfully\u00a0\u2013 that the law violates the Second Amendment. The jury pool Approximately 250 Delaware residents have been summoned for jury service, according to the judge. They\u2019ll be whittled down to a panel of 12 seated jurors and four alternates. Delaware is one of the smallest states in the country, and the Biden family looms large. As part of the selection process \u2013 called voir dire \u2013 prospective jurors\u00a0will be asked\u00a0whether they can stay impartial regardless of their views about the 2024 election. They\u2019ll also be asked whether they can keep an open mind about Hunter Biden and even whether they\u2019ve been eligible to vote in past elections for Joe Biden, who has held public office in Delaware since 1971. Other questions touch on the highly politicized atmosphere surrounding the case, including, \u201cDo you believe Hunter Biden is being prosecuted in this case because his father is the President of the United States?\u201d or, coming from the other side, whether they think he \u201cis not being prosecuted for other crimes because his father is the President.\u201d What has Hunter Biden said? Since his indictments last year, Hunter Biden hasn\u2019t said much about his legal cases. He\u00a0spoke out in December\u00a0amid his fight with the House Republicans who are probing his business dealings and took responsibility for having \u201cmade mistakes in my life and wasted opportunities and privileges that I was afforded.\u201d But he slammed the \u201cMAGA right\u201d lawmakers who \u201cridiculed my struggle with addiction\u201d and \u201cbelittled my recovery.\u201d \u201cThey have tried to dehumanize me, all to embarrass and damage my father,\u201d he said. Previously, Hunter Biden shared intensely personal details about his addiction in his\u00a02021 memoir, which prosecutors plan to use against him at trial. He described his stints in rehab, his relapses, how he bought drugs near the White House, and the stretches of time when he \u201chad no plan beyond the moment-to-moment demands of the crack pipe.\u201d The laptop, texts and emails One of the most notable pieces of evidence in the case will be messages from Hunter Biden\u2019s\u00a0infamous laptop, which has been at the center of a yearslong political saga. Weiss said the material \u201cis real\u201d and will be an important part of his case, rebutting past claims from the president\u2019s son that the laptop might be fake or even Russian disinformation. Republican officials\u00a0and\u00a0right-wing outlets\u00a0have seized on the laptop\u2019s embarrassing emails and sexually explicit images to attack Hunter Biden, while his lawyers say the files\u00a0were manipulated and\u00a0sued a repair-shop owner\u00a0who helped make the materials public. Many on the right celebrated this move by Weiss, even if he hasn\u2019t verified their loftier anti-Biden allegations. The New York Post, the conservative tabloid that was first to publish messages from the laptop in 2020, recently\u00a0took a victory lap\u00a0on its front cover. In a ruling last month, Noreika said she\u2019ll let Hunter Biden challenge the authenticity of any messages introduced at trial. Some of the texts contain gut-wrenching arguments between Hunter Biden and his loved ones about his sobriety. Others show him meeting up with drug dealers, including some just a few blocks from the Wilmington federal courthouse. \u201cI\u2019m a liar and a thief and a blamer and a user and I\u2019m delusional and an addict unlike beyond and above all other addicts that you know and I\u2019ve ruined every relationship I\u2019ve ever cherished,\u201d he texted Hallie Biden in October 2018, according to Weiss\u2019 filings. Prosecutors plan to use the laptop to\u00a0specifically support their claim that he was using illegal drugs when he bought the gun in 2018. Weiss\u00a0has not addressed \u2013 and the case is not about \u2013 Republicans\u2019\u00a0unproven allegation\u00a0that emails from the laptop prove that Hunter Biden and his father were involved in corrupt foreign business deals. What about the tax charges? This is just one of two trials Hunter Biden faces this year. The second case is scheduled for September in Los Angeles and revolves around Hunter Biden\u2019s\u00a0troubled finances. He has\u00a0pleaded not guilty\u00a0to tax evasion, filing false tax returns and failing to file his taxes on time. Originally, the trials were both scheduled for June, but Hunter Biden got a reprieve from the California federal judge, who\u00a0agreed to postpone\u00a0that trial. But the September trial date means that case will coincide with the final stretch of the presidential campaign.

{"id": "2024_05_30_us_jury-deliberations-murder-trial-chad-daybell", "text": "Chad Daybell was found guilty Thursday of\u00a0first-degree murder and conspiracy charges in the deaths of his first wife and two children of his second wife in a case Idaho prosecutors claim was fueled by power, sex, money and apocalyptic spiritual beliefs. Daybell could face the death penalty. Daybell had pleaded not guilty to the charges in the\u00a0deaths of his first wife, Tammy Daybell, and the children of his second wife, Lori Vallow Daybell -\u2013 16-year-old Tylee Ryan and 7-year-old Joshua \u201cJJ\u201d Vallow. Wearing a light blue shirt and yellow tie, Daybell showed no emotion as the verdict was read just after 2 p.m. local time. Authorities have said they\u00a0believe Tylee and JJ were killed in September 2019\u00a0\u2013 the month they were last reported to have been seen \u2013 and that Tammy Daybell was\u00a0found dead\u00a0in her Idaho home on October 19, 2019, a\u00a0few weeks before Chad Daybell married Lori Vallow Daybell. Tammy Daybell was initially believed to have died in her sleep. Law enforcement found the remains of Tylee and JJ on Chad Daybell\u2019s Fremont County property\u00a0in June 2020, authorities said. The state is seeking the death penalty. That phase of the case began Thursday afternoon, with Judge Steven Boyce giving jurors preliminary instructions. Proceedings were to resume Friday morning. After the verdict, JJ\u2019s grandfather, Larry Woodcock, told reporters, \u201cIt\u2019s a sad day. JJ would have been 12 years old, guys. For what?\u201d Woodcock remembered the victims, and asked the same question, over and over. \u201cWhat did they accomplish? Nothing. What did they do? They destroyed families,\u201d Woodcock said of Daybell and Lori Vallow Daybell. But the defendants, Woodcock said, could not destroy the memories relatives have of the victims. \u201cThey can\u2019t take that,\u201d he added, growing emotional at one point. When he heard the jury verdict in court, he said, he felt like he couldn\u2019t breathe. Deliberations began Wednesday and lasted for a little more than two hours. Deliberations resumed just after 8 a.m. local time on Thursday. After deliberating about two hours, the jury asked the court for a missing instruction related to the first-degree murder count in the death of Tammy Daybell. They resumed deliberations shortly after receiving the instruction from the court. Idaho prosecutors claim the killings were fueled by power, sex, money and apocalyptic spiritual beliefs. The prosecutors wrote in a court document that each homicide was \u201cespecially heinous, atrocious or cruel, manifesting exceptional depravity.\u201d Defense attorney John Prior in closing arguments Wednesday said there wasn\u2019t enough direct evidence against Daybell and others were responsible for the deaths. His wife, Vallow Daybell, was\u00a0convicted by a jury\u00a0in May 2023 of the murder of her children and was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. She also was convicted of conspiring to kill his former wife, Tammy Daybell. Vallow Daybell has\u00a0appealed her convictions\u00a0to the state Supreme Court, with her legal team raising the issue of whether she was mentally competent to stand trial. \u2018Sex, money and power\u2019 were key focuses in the trial During opening statements, the prosecutor and defense attorney painted contrasting portraits of the defendant. The state described him as a power-hungry and grandiose man who would stop at nothing for \u201cwhat he considered his rightful destiny.\u201d His defense lawyer portrayed Daybell as a religious man driven into an unfortunate relationship by a \u201cbeautiful, vivacious woman\u201d who knew \u201chow to get what she wants.\u201d \u201cTwo dead children buried in the defendant Chad Daybell\u2019s backyard,\u201d prosecutor Rob Wood said in his first words to the jury. \u201cThe next month his wife is found dead in their marital bed. Seventeen days after the death of his wife, Tammy Daybell, this defendant is\u00a0photographed laughing and dancing on a beach in Hawaii at his wedding to Lori Vallow, a woman who was his mistress and the mother of the children buried\u00a0in the graves on his property. Three dead bodies.\u201d When Daybell \u201chad a chance at what he considered his rightful destiny,\u201d Wood said, he \u201cmade sure that no person and no law would stand in his way.\u201d \u201cHis desire for sex, money and power led him to pursue those ambitions,\u201d the prosecutor added. \u201cAnd this pursuit\u00a0led to the deaths of his wife and Lori\u2019s two innocent children.\u201d Tammy Daybell was initially believed to have died in her sleep, and Chad Daybell remarried less than three weeks after her death in 2019. Prior, the defense attorney, said Daybell\u2019s life began to change after he met Vallow Daybell, a \u201cbeautifully stunning woman\u201d who \u201cstarts giving him a lot of attention\u201d and eventually lured him into an \u201cinappropriate\u201d and \u201cunfortunate\u201d extramarital relationship. Vallow Daybell\u2019s two children from a previous marriage were last seen on different days in September 2019. Tylee Ryan was a \u201cnormal, vibrant teenage girl\u201d who loved her friends and her little brother JJ, who was on the autism spectrum and required special care, according to Wood. In late November 2019, relatives asked police in Rexburg, Idaho,\u00a0to do a welfare check on JJ because they hadn\u2019t talked to him recently. Police didn\u2019t find him at the family\u2019s house but did see Vallow Daybell and Daybell, who said JJ was staying with a family friend in Arizona, according to authorities. When police returned with a search warrant the next day, the couple was gone. They were ultimately found in Hawaii in January 2020. In June 2020, law enforcement officials found the remains of Tylee and JJ on Daybell\u2019s property in Fremont County, Idaho. Vallow Daybell and Daybell were indicted on murder charges in May 2021. Tylee was believed to have been killed between September 8 and 9, 2019, and JJ between September 22 and 23, according to prosecutors. \u201cWe are filled with unfathomable sadness that these two bright stars were stolen from us, and only hope that they died without pain or suffering,\u201d the families of the children said in a statement after the remains were found. During the preliminary hearing, Wood said Daybell helped hide evidence. \u201cThose bodies were concealed, one of them was destroyed, they were located on Chad Daybell\u2019s property,\u201d Wood said. Prior, however, argued the state didn\u2019t \u201ccome close\u201d to having enough evidence to prove Daybell concealed the bodies of JJ or Tylee. \u201cThere\u2019s been no indication of any evidence that this act took place on the night of the 22nd or 23rd, or whatever day it was,\u201d Prior said. Couple believed they were religious figures During opening statements, Wood\u00a0described Chad Daybell as a \u201cseemingly ordinary man\u201d who wrote books about the apocalypse, a person who \u201ccraves significance\u201d and worked as a sexton in a graveyard. In October 2018, Chad Daybell and Vallow Daybell met at a religious conference in Utah and he began to craft an alternate reality where his \u201cobsession for glory was rooted in her adoration for him,\u201d Wood told jurors. Soon, Wood said, they viewed their spouses and even their children as \u201cobstacles\u201d that stood in their way. \u201cAnyone who opposed them were labeled sometimes as dark spirits or even zombies,\u201d the prosecutor said. During opening statements, Prior described his client as a religious man who wrote books about his faith, premonitions, good and evil, and the \u201ccoming of the end of things when his savior, in his mind, is going to come back.\u201d  Chad Daybell and Vallow Daybell called themselves \u201cJames and Elaina\u201d and believed they were religious figures and had a system of rating people as \u201clight\u201d or \u201cdark,\u201d a prosecutor told jurors during Vallow Daybell\u2019s trial. The state accused the couple of using their \u201cdoomsday\u201d religious beliefs to justify the killings. In particular, Daybell and Vallow Daybell\u00a0exchanged texts about Tammy Daybell \u201cbeing in limbo\u201d and \u201cbeing possessed by a spirit named Viola,\u201d according to the indictment. People close to the couple\u00a0said they had been involved in strong religious ideologies. In addition, Daybell was connected to a religious\u00a0doomsday prepper website\u00a0called \u201cPreparing a People,\u201d which described itself as a \u201cseries of lecture events focusing on self-reliance and personal preparation.\u201d The publishers of the site said they decided to pull content featuring either Daybell or Vallow Daybell after the children\u2019s disappearance. Defense points to Vallow Daybell\u2019s brother Prior told the jury about Vallow Daybell\u2019s now-deceased brother, Alex Cox, who\u00a0died in December 2019, and his history of violence \u2013 including the shooting and killing of Vallow Daybell\u2019s former husband, Charles Vallow, in July\u00a02019. The Maricopa County medical examiner in Arizona said Cox died of natural causes,\u00a0CNN affiliate KPHO/KTVK\u00a0reported. \u201cAlex Cox was Lori\u2019s protector,\u201d Prior said. \u201cAlex Cox would do anything and everything to protect, aid and assist Lori Vallow \u2026 Whenever there was a problem or a threat to Lori Vallow, you will hear testimony that Alex Cox came to the rescue.\u201d DNA and forensics experts suggested Cox\u2019s fingerprint was found on plastic wrapped around JJ\u2019s body, Daybell\u2019s defense attorney said.  No DNA or hair belonging to Chad Daybell was found with the children\u2019s bodies, and the exact cause of Tammy Daybell\u2019s death could not be determined, Prior said. How it compares to Vallow Daybell\u2019s trial After Vallow Daybell\u2019s indictment and not guilty plea in 2021, a judge ruled she was incompetent to stand trial, but she was deemed fit to proceed with trial after spending nearly a year in a mental hospital. Vallow Daybell has maintained her innocence. When\u00a0Vallow Daybell was sentenced last year, she denied having killed her children and cited religious texts and beliefs. She said she had spoken to Jesus, her children and her husband\u2019s wife after their deaths and said they were \u201chappy and extremely busy\u201d in heaven. \u201cJesus Christ knows that no one was murdered in this case,\u201d Vallow Daybell said. \u201cAccidental deaths happen, suicides happen, fatal side effects from medications happen.\u201d Judge Steven W. Boyce said at the sentencing hearing: \u201cI don\u2019t believe that any God in any religion would want to have this happen.\u201d The judge said she justified the killings \u201cby going down a bizarre, religious rabbit hole. And clearly you are still down there.\u201d Vallow Daybell has\u00a0appealed her convictions\u00a0to the state Supreme Court, with her legal team raising the issue of whether Vallow Daybell was mentally competent to stand trial.

{"id": "2024_06_01_us_university-of-virginia-mass-shooting-settlement-families", "text": "The University of Virginia has reached a $9 million settlement with the families of three college football players who were killed in a 2022 mass shooting after a school field trip, school officials and attorneys for the families and victims announced Friday. Attorneys told CNN in statements on behalf of the victims\u2019 families the settlement does not bring them any closure and strongly urged for the results of the attorney general\u2019s independent review of the shooting to be released. University spokesperson Brian Coy said a judge in the Albemarle County Circuit Court approved settlement agreements between the university and the estates of football players Devin Chandler, Lavel Davis Jr. and D\u2019Sean Perry. The three men were killed on November 13, 2022, when a fellow student opened fire on a bus returning to the Charlottesville campus from a class field trip to Washington, D.C. where the class had seen a play. Two other people, Marlee Morgan and Michael Hollins, were injured by the gunfire. Suspect Christopher Darnell Jones Jr., a former football player, faces three counts of second-degree murder and three counts of using a handgun in the commission of a felony, UVA Police Chief Tim Longo said. He also faces two counts of malicious wounding, each accompanied by a firearm charge, said Albemarle County prosecutor James Hingeley. The motive behind the killing of three UVA Cavaliers remains a mystery, the university\u2019s president said. An attorney for the Perry family, Elliott Buckner, told CNN the settlement will be paid by the Commonwealth of Virginia \u201cpursuant to its Division of Risk Management Plan.\u201d The families of Chandler, Davis and Perry will each receive $2 million and $3 million will go to Morgan and Hollins, Buckner said. In an email to CNN, Coy said both parties reached an agreement \u201cin principle on the terms of the settlement\u201d and said it was approved by Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin and Attorney General Jason Miyares before the court\u2019s approval. University President Jim Ryan and Rector Robert Hardie said in a statement: \u201cSince November 13, 2022, the families of Devin Chandler, Lavel Davis Jr., and D\u2019Sean Perry\u2014whose lives were tragically cut short\u2014have been ever present in our minds.\u201d \u201cWe will forever remember the impact that Devin, Lavel, and D\u2019Sean had on our community, and we are grateful for the moments they spent in our presence uplifting UVA through their time in the classroom and on the football field,\u201d they said. CNN reached out to the attorney general and the governor for comment. Kimberly Wald, a lawyer for The Perry, Hollins and Morgan families, told CNN the court finalized the $9 million \u201cglobal settlement in this case\u201d with the families of the three students who were killed and the two who were injured. Wald said the results of the independent investigation into the shooting, launched by Miyares, have not been released. Families demand release of external probe Miyares announced days after the tragedy he would begin an independent review at the request of Ryan and then-rector Whitt Clement of the university\u2019s response to the shooting, as well as the efforts it undertook in the period before it. The attorney for the victims\u2019 families said they are \u201cdemanding the release of the information to understand what happened and why it happened and then initiate reforms across the U.S. at college campuses to save lives.\u201d Victoria LaCivita, Miyares\u2019 spokesperson, previously said the AG\u2019s office will enlist special counsel to assist in completing the work. \u201cA public report will be shared with students, families, the larger UVA community, and government officials at the appropriate time,\u201d LaCivita said. \u201cThe Attorney General will work with deliberate speed while ensuring that all necessary resources remain devoted to the criminal investigation being conducted by state and local authorities.\u201d Perry attorney Buckner echoed Wald regarding the independent review, telling CNN the settlements approved by the court \u201cdo not bring the families any closure.\u201d \u201cThe families still do not have all of the facts about what happened to their sons. It is time for UVA and the Commonwealth to release the Report. The families deserve to know what happened,\u201d Buckner said. The suspect was denied bail during a hearing in a few days after the shooting that revealed he was charged and convicted of a reckless driving and hit-and-run in 2021 and had a concealed weapons charge the same year. He received suspended sentences for all the offenses. Jones bought two guns, a semiautomatic rifle and a pistol, in separate purchases in 2022, according to the owner of Dance\u2019s Sporting Goods in Colonial Heights, CNN previously reported. But Jones also had twice unsuccessfully to buy a firearm there, Marlon Dance told CNN in an email. In 2018, he was younger than the legal age of 21 to buy a handgun and was denied a purchase. Three years later he tried to buy a rifle, but failed a background check, according to Dance. In an email to CNN, Virginia State Police Spokesperson Corinne Geller said an investigation into the attempted purchase on July 8, 2021, revealed the state police firearms transaction center denied Jones\u2019 request based on an ongoing legal matter.

{"id": "2024_06_01_us_bald-eagles-nick-nora-texas", "text": "The squawking cries from a pair of bald eagles pierce the treetops of an urban jungle on the edge of a popular lake in Dallas. The beloved eagles are perched 75 feet high over their nest, damaged by a violent storm system that ripped through North Texas on Tuesday. Inside the nest were the bald eagle\u2019s two 9-week-old eaglets, thrown from their sanctuary by hurricane-strength winds. The mother and father have spent the days since the storm circling and searching for their offspring on the ground below. The scene has been heartbreaking to watch for Chris Giblin, an amateur photographer who has spent three years documenting the eagles. \u201cIt hurts,\u201d said Giblin. \u201cIt hurts to see them hurting. Nothing is promised when these storms come through.\u201d This bald eagle family has developed a legion of followers and admirers since they made this spot around White Rock Lake in East Dallas their home nearly three years ago. They came to be known as \u201cNick\u201d and \u201cNora\u201d after the husband-and-wife detective characters in the 1930s film \u201cThe Thin Man.\u201d Their every move has been documented in neighborhood Facebook groups and by a devoted and highly protective contingent of photographers. The eagles have so intensely captured the imagination of the neighbors below them that residents speak of these raptors in mystical terms and their presence as \u201cdivine intervention.\u201d The eagle\u2019s nest sits in a sycamore tree at the end of Krista de la Harpe\u2019s street. She describes the relationship between the birds and the neighborhood as a \u201cthree-year love story.\u201d As the storm hit the city, she could only think about the eagles and their babies surviving the fierce winds and falling trees. \u201cI was in my closet all through the storm, just praying for them,\u201d de la Harpe said as she watched the eagles sitting in the trees this week. \u201cIt\u2019s so heartbreaking.\u201d \u2018I found one\u2019 After the storm passed, neighbors raced out to check on the nest and the eagles. Water was rushing over the banks of the creek below the nest. The fierce winds toppled a mix of large oak, cedar and American elm trees, and the eaglets were nowhere to be seen. Brett Johnson, an urban biologist and conservation manager for the City of Dallas, raced to the park after the storm. He saw half the nest was gone and that the two eaglets were missing. Later that morning, Bryna Thomson searched the creek area with neighbors when she heard her friend shouting, \u201cI found one. I found one. I found one.\u201d The video she captured shows an eaglet shivering and soaked in rain but seemingly not severely injured, even eating a fish it had caught in the floodwaters. \u201cThey were healthy babies,\u201d Thomson said. The neighbor called in to report what they had found. Johnson says he collaborated with state game wardens and US Fish and Wildlife Services to get permission to handle the federally protected bird and move it to a rehabilitation facility that specializes in treating bald eagles. The facility did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for an interview. Sunday morning, specialists with the Blackland Prairie Raptor Center brought the surviving eaglet back to its nesting area around White Rock Lake in hopes it will quickly reunite with its parents. Nick and Nora were seen flying around the area and specialists say they hope the parents will hear the eaglet squawking and return to care for it. The second eaglet has not been found and officials say it\u2019s likely the bird did not survive. Downed trees have made it impossible for searchers to safely access the spots where the eaglet might have fallen. The area is also home to bald eagle predators like coyotes and bobcats. The raptor specialists brought the recovered eaglet to the wooded area in a large crate. The bird\u2019s face was covered in a hood to keep it from seeing and experiencing this confusing environment. Hailey Lebaron, a rehab specialist with the Blackland Prairie Raptor Center, secured the eagle and carried it up the stairs and placed it in a makeshift nest that was made just for this moment. Lebaron removed the hood from the eagle\u2019s head and the bird immediately extended its wings and rustled around the nest. It reacted just the way the specialists wanted it to when the bird realized there was a strange creature \u2013 a human \u2013 so close to it. \u201cLuckily, it was not happy,\u201d Lebaron said. \u201cThe feathers raised up, which is their, \u2018Look at how scary I am.\u2019 It\u2019s a great sign for us.\u201d After the eaglet was recovered Tuesday, rehab specialists gave the raptor a full exam which included x-rays and blood work. The bird was deemed healthy enough to return to the wild after it was monitored for several days. By Friday afternoon, the rehab team knew it was racing against the clock. After a week of separation, it\u2019s more likely the parent eagles would abandon their offspring. \u201cWe had to jump into action,\u201d Lebaron said. \u201cIt\u2019s really, really time sensitive if we wanted it to work. Otherwise, the baby would be rejected by the parents.\u201d Rehab facility volunteers will now work in two-hour shifts until Monday evening to monitor the eaglet from about 100 yards away. If the parents do not return to the eaglet by then, officials say the bird will likely be brought back to the Blackland Prairie Raptor Center. If that happens, facility officials say they will then protect the bird until it can properly fly and learn how to hunt and take care of itself. At that point, the bald eagle would be released into the wild but in a different location, away from its territorial parents. Earlier in the week, Scott Meril, a retired medical doctor, came to the nesting area to capture photographs of the mourning eagle parents. The images show one of the eagles squawking into the sky with its head tilted back in a pose that seemed to capture the bird\u2019s desperation. Meril said he was struck by the eagle\u2019s majestic and powerful stare as they scanned the urban landscape looking for the eaglets. \u201cTo see them in Texas, it\u2019s wild,\u201d Meril said. \u2018You can\u2019t fight this stupid Texas weather\u2019 This isn\u2019t the first time tragedy has struck Nick and Nora\u2019s quest to bring a successful clutch of eggs into the world. In February 2022, the mating bald eagles built a nest in the same area near White Rock Lake. Residents came from across the city to catch a glimpse of the new stars of the neighborhood, waiting for the babies to hatch. But a severe storm with fierce winds ripped the nest and the tree branches apart. The eggs fell to the ground. \u201cThey have been through a lot,\u201d said Johnson. In 2023, Nick and Nora built a second nest around White Rock Lake but abandoned it and never laid eggs. Johnson says the nest was built in an area that was probably too close to the crowds of people who use the lake for recreation. This year, residents thought the eagles had finally succeeded. The eaglets were just a week or two away from being able to fly on their own. At that point, Nick and Nora would teach them how to hunt for their own food. The day before the storm Giblin captured stunning images of the small birds \u201cbranching\u201d out of their nests \u2013 the first attempts to jump from their nests onto nearby tree branches. The cycle of natural life seemed so close to becoming complete, but again nature intervened in a tragic way. \u201cThey just can\u2019t catch a break,\u201d Thomson said. \u201cThey were good parents, and it\u2019s just that you can\u2019t fight this stupid Texas weather.\u201d Yellowstone comes to Dallas While bald eagles can often be found near large cities, it remains rare for eagles to nest and mate in busy urban areas. This is why Giblin and a group of photographers have spent countless hours documenting the couple. Giblin, who works for a merchandising company, estimates he has snapped more than 20,000 pictures of the eagles since they started appearing regularly here three years ago. He\u2019s so dedicated, he once spent 7 hours waiting to capture a single shot of the eagles flying from their nest. He equates the bald eagles\u2019 presence in Dallas to having Yellowstone National Park in the city \u201cIn this metropolis, they chose to nest right here. It\u2019s absolutely crazy,\u201d Giblin said.\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m down here every weekend. I don\u2019t take it for granted.\u201d Thomson, a middle school science teacher, says the bald eagles have brought her neighborhood closer together. She often sets up a spotting scope connected to an iPad, which she calls \u201cEagle TV,\u201d so children can watch the eagles up-close. \u201cThey\u2019re the coolest birds ever,\u201d Thomson said. \u201cI\u2019m not really a bird person, but apparently I am. Because I sure do like the bald eagle.\u201d These Dallas eagle lovers worry years of disappointment might convince Nick and Nora to abandon their lives around their neighborhood lake and look to build a nest elsewhere. The majestic birds don\u2019t realize they\u2019re the main characters in a love story their neighbors don\u2019t want to end.

{"id": "2024_05_31_us_chad-daybell-sentencing-death-penalty-decision", "text": "A day after delivering a\u00a0guilty verdict\u00a0in Chad Daybell\u2019s murder trial, an Idaho jury on Friday deliberated for six hours whether he will face the death penalty for killing his first wife and two of his second wife\u2019s children. Daybell was convicted Thursday of first-degree murder and conspiracy charges in the deaths of his first wife, Tammy Daybell, and two of his second wife\u2019s children \u2013 16-year-old Tylee Ryan and 7-year-old Joshua \u201cJJ\u201d Vallow \u2013 in a case prosecutors claim was fueled by power, sex, money and apocalyptic spiritual beliefs. The sentencing phase of Daybell\u2019s trial began shortly after the guilty verdict was delivered, with state Judge Steven Boyce giving jurors preliminary instructions. Jurors began deliberating his fate Friday afternoon after hearing victim impact statements and contrasting portraits of the man from lawyers before going home for the night shortly before 8 p.m. MT. Jurors will continue deliberations Saturday at 9 a.m. MT, according to the Ada County Courthouse. In his opening statement to the jury on Friday, prosecutor Rob Wood asked them to consider aggravating factors that would make Daybell eligible for the death penalty. First, the three murders, he said, were committed for remuneration. Daybell was also convicted of insurance fraud stemming from life insurance policies that allegedly paid him money after his first wife\u2019s death. His second wife, as well as Daybell, also were convicted of grand theft because she continued to draw Social Security benefits for her children after their deaths. Additionally, Wood told the jury, the murders of the three victims were \u201cespecially heinous, atrocious or cruel, manifesting exceptional depravity.\u201d \u201cThis defendant exhibited utter disregard for human life,\u201d Wood added. \u201cThe defendant, by his conduct, whether such conduct was before, during or after the commission of the murders at hand, has exhibited a propensity to commit murder, which will probably constitute a continuing threat to society.\u201d The prosecutor concluded, \u201cIt is your decision whether one or more of these aggravators has been proven. And if it has been, you must decide if, under these circumstances, imposition of the death penalty would be just or unjust.\u201d The verdict came about a year after Daybell\u2019s second wife, Lori Vallow Daybell, was also convicted of the murder of her children and sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. She was also convicted of conspiring to kill Tammy Daybell. Vallow Daybell has\u00a0appealed her convictions\u00a0to the state Supreme Court, with her legal team raising the issue of whether she was mentally competent to stand trial. Authorities have said they\u00a0believe Tylee and JJ were killed in September 2019\u00a0\u2013 the month they were last reported to have been seen \u2013 and that Tammy Daybell was\u00a0found dead\u00a0in her Idaho home on October 19, 2019, a\u00a0few weeks before Chad Daybell married Vallow Daybell. Addressing the jury Friday, defense lawyer John Prior portrayed Daybell as a once \u201cquiet, reserved, shy young man\u201d who grew up in Springville, Utah, a small, tight knit \u201ctown of faith.\u201d Daybell, his lawyer said, met his first wife, Tammy, and they were married for 29 years, raising five \u201cwonderful\u201d children \u201cvery deep in their faith, very deep in their commitment to family.\u201d But Daybell\u2019s life changed in late 2018, Prior said, when he met Vallow Daybell, who had already been married multiple times. \u201cEverything that glitters is not gold,\u201d he told jurors. \u201cLori Vallow glittered. She was not gold. She was the trajectory that changed the plan\u2026 Chaos hits and all of these things start cascading and this thing becomes very complicated and difficult.\u201d Prior said the new relationship with Vallow was like \u201cthis bomb dropped\u201d on the life of \u201cthe small town boy from Springville.\u201d \u201cWe have to look back at that,\u201d he said. \u201cYou examine what Chad Daybell\u2019s past was prior to the bomb being dropped, the Lori Vallow bomb being dropped\u2026 If it wasn\u2019t for that trajectory coming in and changing the path, is this where we would be going? It\u2019s not where we\u2019d be going.\u201d \u2018There\u2019s a hole in my heart\u2019 Jurors also heard from relatives of the victims on Friday. \u201cIt makes me angry and it destroys me to know Tammy was treated how she was,\u201d Tammy Daybell\u2019s father, Ron Douglas, told jurors. \u201cI find it comforting to know that Tammy is resting peacefully in Utah, buried alone and near her beloved mother.\u201d Kay Woodcock spoke about her grandson JJ and her step niece Tylee. \u201cI sit here today and try and explain the immense pain that me and everyone in my family continues to endure daily,\u201d she said. \u201cBut how do I do that?\u201d \u201cI can tell you there have been too many situations in the past few years where we were slammed with the fact that JJ won\u2019t hit another milestone,\u201d she said of her grandson. \u201cThe constant question remains: Who would he have become? What kind of man would he have been?\u201d Woodcock remembered Tylee as \u201cthe most precious, blond-haired, blue-eyed little girl\u201d and an \u201cabsolute mama\u2019s girl.\u201d Woodcock added, breaking into tears: \u201cThere\u2019s a hole in my heart, in the hearts of every member of my family, that can never be filled and will remain for the rest of my life.\u201d Tylee\u2019s aunt, Annie Cushing, remembered her walking around the house singing with \u201cthe voice of an angel.\u201d \u201cTylee had her whole life ahead of her. She had dignity, she had dreams, she had goals. This defendant stole all of that,\u201d Cushing said. Kelsee Douglas, Tammy\u2019s sister-in-law, told jurors that \u201cpain, fractured relationships and unhealed wounds are all part of the aftermath\u201d of the murders. \u201cThis is the legacy of anguish and sorrow that will haunt our family for generations,\u201d she added. Tammy\u2019s brother, Michael Douglas, lamented that \u201cthe nightmare fodder I have been provided will last me a lifetime.\u201d Daybell declined to address the court after the victim impact statements. Law enforcement found the remains of Tylee and JJ on Chad Daybell\u2019s Fremont County property\u00a0in June 2020, authorities said. \u201cIt\u2019s a sad day. JJ would have been 12 years old,\u201d JJ\u2019s grandfather, Larry Woodcock, said after the verdict Thursday. Woodcock remembered the victims, and asked the same question, over and over. \u201cWhat did they accomplish? Nothing. What did they do? They destroyed families,\u201d Woodcock said of Daybell and Lori Vallow Daybell. But the defendants, Larry Woodcock said, could not destroy the memories relatives have of the victims. \u201cThey can\u2019t take that,\u201d he added, growing emotional at one point. When he heard the jury verdict in court, he said, he felt like he couldn\u2019t breathe. \u2018Sex, money and power\u2019 were key focuses in the trial During opening statements, the prosecutor and defense attorney painted contrasting portraits of the defendant. The state described him as a power-hungry and grandiose man who would stop at nothing for \u201cwhat he considered his rightful destiny.\u201d His defense lawyer portrayed Daybell as a religious man driven into an unfortunate relationship by a \u201cbeautiful, vivacious woman\u201d who knew \u201chow to get what she wants.\u201d \u201cTwo dead children buried in the defendant Chad Daybell\u2019s backyard,\u201d Wood said in his first words to the jury at the start of trial. \u201cThe next month his wife is found dead in their marital bed. Seventeen days after the death of his wife, Tammy Daybell, this defendant is\u00a0photographed laughing and dancing on a beach in Hawaii at his wedding to Lori Vallow, a woman who was his mistress and the mother of the children buried\u00a0in the graves on his property. Three dead bodies.\u201d When Daybell \u201chad a chance at what he considered his rightful destiny,\u201d Wood said, he \u201cmade sure that no person and no law would stand in his way.\u201d \u201cHis desire for sex, money and power led him to pursue those ambitions,\u201d the prosecutor added. \u201cAnd this pursuit\u00a0led to the deaths of his wife and Lori\u2019s two innocent children.\u201d Tammy Daybell was initially believed to have died in her sleep, and Chad Daybell remarried less than three weeks after her death in 2019. Prior said Daybell\u2019s life began to change after he met Vallow Daybell, a \u201cbeautifully stunning woman\u201d who \u201cstarts giving him a lot of attention\u201d and eventually lured him into an \u201cinappropriate\u201d and \u201cunfortunate\u201d extramarital relationship. Vallow Daybell\u2019s two children from a previous marriage were last seen on different days in September 2019. Tylee Ryan was a \u201cnormal, vibrant teenage girl\u201d who loved her friends and her little brother, JJ, was on the autism spectrum and required special care, according to Wood. In late November 2019, relatives asked police in Rexburg, Idaho,\u00a0to do a welfare check on JJ because they hadn\u2019t talked to him recently. Police didn\u2019t find him at the family\u2019s house but did see Vallow Daybell and Daybell, who said JJ was staying with a family friend in Arizona, according to authorities. When police returned with a search warrant the next day, the couple was gone. They were ultimately found in Hawaii in January 2020. In June 2020, law enforcement officials found the remains of Tylee and JJ on Daybell\u2019s property in Fremont County, Idaho. Vallow Daybell and Daybell were indicted on murder charges in May 2021. Tylee was believed to have been killed between September 8 and 9, 2019, and JJ between September 22 and 23, according to prosecutors. \u201cWe are filled with unfathomable sadness that these two bright stars were stolen from us, and only hope that they died without pain or suffering,\u201d the families of the children said in a statement after the remains were found.

{"id": "2024_05_31_us_roger-forston-florida-airman-shot-deputy-fired", "text": "The Florida sheriff\u2019s deputy who fatally shot a Black airman in his home has been fired, the sheriff\u2019s office announced Friday. The decision followed an internal investigation into the former deputy, Eddie Duran. This is the first time Duran\u2019s identity has been publicly disclosed since the shooting earlier this month. A separate criminal investigation into the deputy\u2019s actions is ongoing with the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. \u201cThe administrative investigation determined the deputy\u2019s use of deadly force was not objectively reasonable and therefore violated agency policy,\u201d a news release from the Okaloosa County Sheriff\u2019s Office stated. Deputies responded May 3 to an apartment after receiving a call for \u201ca disturbance in progress,\u201d Okaloosa Sheriff Eric Aden said in a previous statement. According to the internal investigation, a woman at the complex told the deputy about a disturbance in apartment 1401 she said was \u201cgetting out of hand.\u201d Body camera footage shows shortly after Roger Fortson opened the door of the apartment, the deputy in the video says \u201cstep back\u201d before firing his weapon. Fortson was standing in the doorway with his hands down and a firearm in his right hand. Five shots can be heard on the footage. Fortson was pronounced dead at a hospital. In an interview with investigators, Duran claimed Fortson\u2019s arm was \u201cslightly canted, meaning not straight down.\u201d He described it as being \u201cin a manner so that his arm is slightly up.\u201d But the investigation determined otherwise. According to the statement released with the internal affairs investigation, \u201cthe firearm was pointed at the ground sufficiently enough for the former deputy to clearly see the rear face of the rear sight,\u201d and \u201cthe investigation concluded that Mr. Fortson did not point the gun in the former deputy\u2019s direction.\u201d \u201cThis tragic incident should have never occurred,\u201d Aden said in a Friday release. \u201cThe objective facts do not support the use of deadly force as an appropriate response to Mr. Fortson\u2019s actions. Mr. Fortson did not commit any crime. By all accounts, he was an exceptional airman and individual.\u201d The attorney for Roger Fortson\u2019s family\u00a0said\u00a0while they are pleased with\u00a0the\u00a0firing of the deputy, they are calling for more to be done. In a statement to CNN\u00a0on Friday,\u00a0attorney Ben Crump said, \u201cThe actions of this deputy were not just negligent, they were criminal.\u201d \u201cWhile the criminal investigation is still ongoing, we fully anticipate charges to be filed against this officer. The video footage provides damning proof that this was a brutal and senseless killing of a young man who was simply enjoying time alone with his dog while video chatting with his girlfriend,\u201d the statement\u00a0concluded. Crump and Fortson\u2019s family believe law enforcement responded to the wrong apartment. Fortson was on the phone with his girlfriend leading up to the shooting and was alone. There was no physical altercation happening within his apartment. The internal investigation appeared to show Duran was told to go to Fortson\u2019s apartment by someone from the apartment complex. Duran was hired by the sheriff\u2019s office in July 2019 and resigned in November 2021 to relocate out of state with his spouse, the\u00a0investigation stated. He joined the sheriff\u2019s office again in June 2023. He was up-to-date with his response to resistance, firearms, active assailant, active shooter and domestic violence training sessions. His most recent firearm training was in September 2023, according to the investigation. CNN has reached out to Duran\u2019s attorney for comment.

{"id": "2024_06_01_us_atlanta-ga-water-main-breaks", "text": "Atlanta\u2019s mayor has declared a state of emergency following a massive water main break that left parts of the city\u2019s downtown district without water and prompted a major hospital to transfer patients elsewhere. The\u00a0significant disruption\u00a0to water service in Georgia\u2019s capital is the latest dramatic example of how aging infrastructure throughout the United States has impacted electrical grids, bridges and roadways, dams and other vital systems, inconveniencing millions of Americans or placing them in danger. Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens on Saturday declared a state of emergency just a few hours after crews repaired one of two major water main breaks in the city\u2019s downtown area. The other, in the Midtown neighborhood, is still undergoing services with no estimate on when it will be repaired. Repair crews have made \u201csignificant progress in localizing the repairs\u201d as they continue to address the broken water main at the intersection of West Peachtree Street and 11th Street in Midtown, Atlanta\u2019s Department of Watershed Management said early Sunday. Video from CNN affiliate WANF showed water gushing from a pipe onto a blocked-off portion of West Peachtree Street as crews worked to address it. Atlanta Watershed reported another possible water main break in the city earlier Sunday and announced emergency repairs on a 6-inch water main near the Candler Park neighborhood were complete by late Sunday afternoon. Water service was restored to 35 nearby homes and four hydrants, the city agency said. The issues began Friday after breaks on a 48-inch and 36-inch transmission line \u201cthat carries large volumes of water to the metropolitan area,\u201d according to Atlanta Watershed. The water main breaks left parts of downtown Atlanta without water and under boil water advisories, shuttering tourist attractions and forcing events to be postponed. After repairs to the initial water main break downtown were completed, crews fully restored water service to Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, the Fulton County Jail, Atlanta City Detention Center and other facilities, the city agency said. On Sunday, the city distributed water at two city fire stations, limiting cases to one per resident amid ongoing water issues. \u201cWe are currently working on getting more water delivered to all stations,\u201d the City of Atlanta said in a post on X. Meanwhile, the city\u2019s Emory University Hospital Midtown and its ambulances resumed normal operations Sunday after the hospital experienced water pressure issues due to the water main breaks on Saturday, according to Janet Christenbury, director of media relations. The disruptions prompted the hospital on Saturday to transfer dialysis patients to other hospitals and divert ambulances from its emergency department, except for people with urgent heart concerns, a hospital spokesperson told CNN in a statement. \u201cTomorrow, we will operate on regular schedules for outpatient doctor\u2019s appointments, procedures and surgeries,\u201d Christenbury said in a statement. The hospital said it brought in around 58,000 gallons of water in six tanker trucks to use in chillers and cooling towers on Saturday and distributed bottled water to patients for drinking and personal care needs. \u201cWe will continue to provide bottled water to patients, visitors and staff while the hospital remains under a boil water advisory, like many of the affected areas in Atlanta,\u201d Christenbury said. Urgent surgeries were not affected on Saturday, the hospital said. Boil water advisory in still effect Dickens apologized on Saturday for the city\u2019s response to the water main break that began creating concerns Friday morning. \u201cI know it has been a tough and frustrating day for many of you,\u201d Dickens said. \u201cWe all take\u00a0this matter very seriously.\u201d The issues prompted the closure of tourist attractions and the rescheduling of events including Megan Thee Stallion concerts Friday and Saturday. The incident also left many without water or with inadequate water pressure. The Georgia Aquarium and the World of Coca-Cola, two of downtown\u2019s biggest attractions, remained closed Saturday. Atlanta United, the city\u2019s soccer team, said it planned to play its match against Charlotte FC on Sunday at Mercedes-Benz Stadium, but there would be \u201climited food and beverage options\u201d due to the city\u2019s boil water advisory, which remained in effect. \u201cWe ask all fans to utilize hand sanitizing stations around the stadium as an added precaution for health and safety,\u201d the team said in a statement on X. Officials say a decaying pipe that collapsed due to water pressure was the main cause of the break downtown. \u201cWe were actually able to repair the fitting that was leaking,\u201d said Al Wiggins Jr., Commissioner for the Department of Public Works, during a news conference on Saturday. \u201cWe spent a significant amount of time removing pressure from the system in order for us to be able to conduct the necessary repairs,\u201d he said. Crews are slowly pressurizing water flow to ensure no additional damage is done to the water network. Atlanta\u2019s Grady Memorial Hospital, which reported low water pressure on Saturday, is expected to return to normal operations Monday after water service was restored and water pressure has \u201csignificantly increased,\u201d Grady\u2019s administration announced Sunday. The hospital, which said it remained fully operational on Saturday, said it would also continue providing patients and staff with bottled water Sunday amid the ongoing boil water advisory. Water issues have impacted Atlanta before. In June 2020, a water main break on the Georgia Institute of Technology\u2019s campus led to outages and a boil water advisory in the city. Emory University Hospital Midtown used bottled water then. Patient care was not affected. Atlanta\u2019s woes are part of a larger issue of aging infrastructure throughout the US. Here and in Canada, around 260,000 water main breaks cost $2.6 billion each year, according to a December 2023 study from Utah State University. The study noted the average age of failing water mains is around 53 years and that 33% of US and Canadian water mains are over 50 years old.

Trump, who\u00a0faces the possibility of a prison sentence\u00a0after he was convicted last week on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records, was asked\u00a0in an interview aired Sunday\u00a0on Fox News about how he had \u201cfamously said\u2026\u00a0\u2018lock her up\u2019\u201d in relation to Clinton but did not jail her when he was president. During his answer, Trump said he had decided that imprisoning Clinton \u201cwould have been a terrible thing.\u201d Then he added: \u201cI didn\u2019t say \u2018lock her up,\u2019 but the people would all say \u2018lock her up, lock her up.\u2019\u201d Facts First:\u00a0Trump\u2019s claim that \u201cI didn\u2019t say \u2018lock her up\u2019\u201d is false. He called for Clinton\u2019s imprisonment on multiple occasions, including by\u00a0using the phrase \u201clock her up.\u201d Trump often used such rhetoric while criticizing Clinton\u2019s email practices as secretary of state during the Obama administration, which prompted a federal investigation. She was never charged with a crime. During campaign rallies in 2016, Trump sometimes\u00a0paused\u00a0his remarks as his supporters engaged in chants of \u201clock her up,\u201d giving the chants time to continue. On other occasions, he explicitly repeated those words himself. \u201cFor what she\u2019s done, they should lock her up,\u201d Trump\u00a0said\u00a0after the crowd chanted \u201clock her up\u201d at an October 2016 rally in North Carolina. \u201c\u2018Lock her up\u2019 is right,\u201d he\u00a0said\u00a0at an October 2016 rally in Pennsylvania. Trump also explicitly called for Clinton\u2019s imprisonment using different phrasing. \u201cHillary Clinton has to go to jail, OK? She has to go to jail,\u201d he\u00a0said\u00a0in a June 2016 speech in California. \u201cShe has to go to jail,\u201d he\u00a0repeated\u00a0in an October 2016 speech in Florida.\u00a0And at a presidential debate in October 2016, after Clinton\u00a0said,\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s just awfully good that someone with the temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of the law in our country,\u201d Trump responded, \u201cBecause you\u2019d be in jail.\u201d Trump\u00a0softened his rhetoric\u00a0shortly after he defeated Clinton in the election, saying he didn\u2019t want to hurt her and didn\u2019t feel strongly about prosecuting her.

{"id": "2024_05_31_politics_fact-check-trump-post-conviction-speech", "text": "Former President Donald Trump said he was going to hold a \u201cpress conference\u201d on Friday in the wake of his Thursday conviction in Manhattan on felony charges of falsifying business records. Instead, Trump delivered a rambling monologue that was filled with false claims on subjects ranging from the Manhattan trial to immigration to tax policy. Here is a fact check of some of the inaccurate or unsubstantiated claims he made. Crime in New York City Trump repeated his familiar claim that, while Manhattan prosecutors have been focusing on him, New York City has been experiencing record-high violent crime. He said this time that \u201cyou have violent crime all over this city at levels that nobody\u2019s ever seen before.\u201d Facts First: Trump\u2019s claim is not even close to true. Violent crime in New York City \u2013 and violent crime in Manhattan in particular \u2013 has plummeted since the early 1990s and is today nowhere near record levels. New York City recorded 391 murders in 2023, down about 83% from the 2,262 in 1990; 1,455 rapes in 2023, down about 53% from the 3,126 in 1990; and 16,910 robberies in 2023, down about 83% from the 100,280 in 1990. Michael Cohen\u2019s crimes Criticizing key prosecution witness Michael Cohen, Trump repeated a claim he made during the trial in April. He asserted that Cohen, his former lawyer and fixer, \u201cgot into trouble not because of me\u201d but because of \u201coutside deals\u201d and \u201csomething to do with taxicabs and medallions, and he borrowed money, and that\u2019s why he went.\u201d He added that Cohen pleaded guilty to campaign finance violations to try to get himself a lighter penalty. Trump continued: \u201cHe got in trouble for a very simple reason: because he was involved with borrowing a lot of money and he did something with the banks \u2013 I don\u2019t know, defrauded the banks, but something happened.\u201d Facts First:\u00a0Trump\u2019s claim that Cohen got into trouble simply because of his non-Trump-related activities, such as those related to taxis and loans, is not true. First, Cohen\u2019s case was referred to federal prosecutors in New York by the special counsel, Robert Mueller, who was appointed to investigate any connections between the Trump campaign and Russia. Second, Cohen\u2019s three-year prison sentence in 2018 was for\u00a0multiple\u00a0crimes, some of which were directly related to Trump.\u00a0 Most notably, Cohen was sentenced for\u00a0campaign finance offenses\u00a0connected to a hush money scheme\u00a0during the 2016 presidential campaign to conceal Trump\u2019s alleged extramarital relationships \u2013 the same hush money scheme that was central to this prosecution against Trump. Cohen was\u00a0also sentenced to two months in prison, to run concurrently with the three-year sentence, for\u00a0lying to Congress in 2017 in relation to previous talks about the possibility of building a Trump Tower in Moscow, Russia, including about the\u00a0extent of Trump\u2019s involvement in the aborted Moscow initiative\u00a0and about when in 2016 the discussions ended.\u00a0(The discussions continued into June 2016, the month after Trump\u00a0became the presumptive Republican nominee, and did not conclude in January 2016 before the first votes were cast, as Cohen had claimed.) Referring to Trump as \u201cIndividual-1,\u201d Cohen\u00a0said\u00a0at the time of his 2018 guilty plea for making false statements to the US\u00a0Senate Select Committee on Intelligence: \u201cI made these statements to be consistent with Individual-1\u2019s political messaging and out of loyalty to Individual-1.\u201d When Cohen pleaded guilty in 2018 to the campaign finance violations, he\u00a0said\u00a0he broke the law \u201cin coordination and at the direction of a candidate for federal office,\u201d\u00a0Trump. Biden and the case Trump repeated his frequent claim that the Manhattan case in which Trump was convicted \u201cis all done by Biden and his people\u201d and \u201cin total conjunction with white house and the DOJ,\u201d the federal Department of Justice. Facts First:\u00a0There is no basis for Trump\u2019s claim. There is no evidence that President Joe Biden, his White House aides or the federal Justice Department had any role in launching or running Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg\u2019s prosecution\u00a0\u2013\u00a0and Bragg, a Democrat, is a locally elected official who does not report to the federal government. The\u00a0indictment\u00a0in the case was approved by a grand jury of ordinary citizens. Trump has\u00a0repeatedly invoked\u00a0a lawyer on Bragg\u2019s team, Matthew Colangelo, while making such claims; Colangelo left the Justice Department in 2022\u00a0to join the district attorney\u2019s office\u00a0as\u00a0senior counsel to Bragg. But there is no evidence that Biden had anything to do with Colangelo\u2019s employment decision. Colangelo and Bragg had been colleagues before Bragg was elected Manhattan district attorney in 2021. Before Colangelo worked at the Justice Department, he and Bragg worked at the same time in the office of New York\u2019s state attorney general, where Colangelo\u00a0investigated Trump\u2019s charity\u00a0and Trump\u2019s financial practices and was\u00a0involved in bringing various lawsuits\u00a0against the Trump administration. The judge and an expert in election law Trump claimed that, because of Judge Juan Merchan, \u201cwe weren\u2019t allowed to use our election expert under any circumstances.\u201d He claimed that this expert on election law was ready to testify \u201cand the judge knocked him out, said you can\u2019t testify.\u201d Facts First:\u00a0Trump\u2019s claim that Merchan refused to allow Trump\u2019s team to use this witness \u201cunder any circumstances\u201d is false. Merchan did not prohibit the potential witness, former\u00a0Federal Election Commission\u00a0chairman Bradley Smith, from testifying. Rather, Merchan\u00a0limited what Smith was allowed to testify about. Merchan\u00a0decided\u00a0in March that Smith could provide background information about the FEC and define certain terms relevant to this case but could not opine on whether Trump broke federal election laws or offer opinions about how to interpret or apply those laws. After Merchan\u00a0refused last week to change his mind, Trump\u2019s defense decided not to call Smith as a witness.\u00a0 Smith\u00a0wrote\u00a0on social media last week: \u201cJudge Merchan has so restricted my testimony that defense has decided not to call me.\u201d Trump, offering a hint of a clarification, did proceed to say on Friday that Smith \u201cessentially\u201d was not able to testify. But his earlier comments made it sound like Merchan had imposed a total ban on Smith\u2019s testimony. Immigration and \u2018the Congo\u2019 Trump repeated a claim he has made before about \u201cthe Congo\u201d and migration, again without specifying whether he was referring to the Democratic Republic of Congo or the neighboring Republic of Congo. He said: \u201cThe Congo has just released a lot of people from jail \u2013 Congo, Africa \u2013 just released a lot of people, a lot of people, from their prisons and jails, and brought them into the United States of America.\u201d Facts First:\u00a0Trump\u2019s claim is baseless. Experts on the Democratic Republic of Congo and the Republic of Congo, plus both pro-immigration and anti-immigration organizations in the US, told CNN they have not seen any evidence of Congolese prisons being emptied, let alone evidence of either country somehow having \u201cbrought\u201d ex-prisoners into the US. Trump\u2019s presidential campaign and an allied super PAC did not respond to requests to provide any evidence. A CNN search of two media databases turned up no evidence. And federal figures show that there is no \u201cvery big\u201d influx of Congolese migrants of any kind, let alone former prisoners in particular. \u201cEverything he is saying isn\u2019t true,\u201d Democratic Republic of Congo spokesperson Patrick Muyaya Katembwe told CNN in a text message in March. Asked specifically about Trump\u2019s claims about Congolese prisons being emptied of violent criminals, he said, \u201cNever ever, it\u2019s not true.\u201d And, he said, \u201cwe want him to stop\u201d telling these stories, since \u201cit\u2019s very bad for the country.\u201d Serge Mombouli, the Republic of Congo\u2019s ambassador to the US, said in an email to CNN in March:\u00a0\u201cThere is no truth or any sign nor a single fact supporting such a claim or statement.\u201d You can read more\u00a0here. Trump and Nord Stream 2 Trump repeated his claim that he had ended a key Russian project \u2013 the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline to Germany. He said: \u201cYou know, I ended the Russian pipeline. It was dead.\u201d Facts First:\u00a0Trump\u2019s claim is false. He did not \u201cend\u201d Nord Stream nor render it \u201cdead.\u201d While he did\u00a0approve sanctions\u00a0on companies working on the project, that move came nearly three years into his presidency, when the pipeline was already\u00a0around 90% complete\u00a0\u2013 and the state-owned Russian gas company behind the project\u00a0said\u00a0shortly after the sanctions that it would complete the pipeline itself. The company\u00a0announced\u00a0in December 2020 that construction was resuming. And with days left in Trump\u2019s term in January 2021, Germany\u00a0announced\u00a0that it had renewed permission for construction in its waters. The pipeline never began operations; Germany ended up\u00a0halting the project\u00a0as Russia was about to invade Ukraine in early 2022. The pipeline was damaged later that year in what has been\u00a0described as a likely act of sabotage. Biden\u2019s tax policy Trump claimed while denouncing the Biden administration: \u201cThey want to raise your taxes by four times.\u201d Facts First: This is false, just as it was when Trump made the same claim during the 2020 election campaign and in early 2024. Biden has not proposed to quadruple Americans\u2019 taxes, and there has never been any indication that he is seeking to do so. The nonpartisan Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center think tank, which analyzed Biden\u2019s never-implemented budget proposals for fiscal 2024, found this: \u201cHis plan would raise average after-tax incomes for low-income households in 2024, leave them effectively unchanged for middle-income households, and lower after-tax incomes significantly for the highest-income taxpayers.\u201d The Tax Policy Center found that Biden\u2019s proposal would, on average, have raised taxes by about $2,300 \u2013 but that\u2019s about a 2.3% decline in after-tax income, not the massive reduction Trump is suggesting Biden wants. And critically, Tax Policy Center senior fellow Howard Gleckman noted to CNN on Friday that 95% of the tax hike would have been covered by the highest-income 5% of households. The very biggest burden under the Biden plan would have been carried by the very richest households; the Tax Policy Center found that households in the top 0.1% would have seen their after-tax incomes decline by more than 20%. That\u2019s \u201ca lot,\u201d Gleckman noted, but it\u2019s still nowhere near the quadrupling Trump claims Biden is looking for. And again, even this increase would have been only for a tiny subset of the population. Biden has promised not to raise taxes by even a cent for anyone making under $400,000 per year.

{"id": "2024_05_30_us_minneapolis-incident-officers-injured", "text": "A Minneapolis officer hailed as a hero last year was killed by a gunman who ambushed the officer as he responded to the scene of another shooting, police said. Officer Jamal Mitchell, 36, was one of two people killed Thursday in a pair of shootings that also left four people wounded, authorities said. The gunman, who Minnesota authorities identified on Sunday as Mustafa Ahmed Mohamed, 35, was also killed. Police initially responded to a call about two people shot at an apartment building in Minneapolis\u2019 Whittier neighborhood around 5:15 p.m. Thursday. When officers arrived, someone shot at them immediately, and the officers returned fire, Assistant Police Chief Katie Blackwell said. Mitchell and the suspect were killed and another officer was injured, Blackwell said. She said authorities later found three other civilians who had been shot, one of whom died at the scene. The suspect and the other victim killed, identified as Osman Said Jimale, 32, both died of \u201cmultiple gunshot wounds,\u201d according to the Hennepin County Medical Examiner\u2019s Office. Among the four surviving injured, a Minneapolis police officer and a firefighter suffered non-life-threatening injuries, Blackwell said. They have since been treated and released. The other two suffered life-threatening injuries, including a person who was shot in his vehicle and another who was found in an apartment, Minneapolis police said. They were still in the hospital as of Friday afternoon. \u2018A hero, a son, a father, a fianc\u00e9\u2019 was killed Just three days after he was sworn in to the police department in 2023, Mitchell rushed into a burning, smoke-filled house with another officer to rescue an elderly couple. The rookie Minneapolis cop told CNN he didn\u2019t hesitate to go in. \u201cWe\u2019re not trained to run into fires, but we are trained to put others\u2019 lives in front of ours,\u201d Mitchell told CNN last year. \u201cSo when we found out possibly that someone was in that house, we didn\u2019t second guess running in.\u201d In his final moments Thursday, the young officer responded to a shooting and tried to render first aid to those who had been injured, authorities said. One of the people he was trying to help turned out to be the gunman who would kill him, authorities said. \u201cMitchell was attempting to assist the individual that shot him,\u201d Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension Superintendent Drew Evans said. \u201cIt happened very fast \u2026 he ambushed him.\u201d Mitchell \u201cwas a hero, a son, a father, a fianc\u00e9 and an officer who is so deeply committed to protecting and serving,\u201d Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said. \u201cHe would run towards danger when the rest of us would run in the other direction,\u201d the mayor added. Even though he was a Minneapolis officer for less than two years, Mitchell made a profound impact on the department. \u201cI\u2019ve never met an officer that received an award on the third day on the job,\u201d Blackwell said. And the officer \u201cgave the ultimate sacrifice to protect and save the lives of others,\u201d Frey said. \u201cWe will honor his sacrifice. We will remember his name,\u201d the mayor said. \u201cWe will never forget what he did for the people of our city.\u201d Speaking early Friday morning, Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O\u2019Hara said, \u201cThere are not words to appropriately describe this tragedy.\u00a0It\u2019s the worst call a police chief can receive.\u201d O\u2019Hara says that he had known Mitchell personally. \u201cHe died a hero,\u201d the chief said. \u201cHe died doing what we asked him to do for the rest of us.\u201d The motive remains a mystery It\u2019s still unclear what prompted the gunfire that led to a shootout and two victims killed. Authorities say homicide detectives were trying to determine the motive. Witness Reuben Molina was watching TV with his girlfriend in a third-floor apartment when he heard a \u201cbang.\u201d \u201cThen we heard it again and again and again in rapid succession, and then me and her were like, \u2018Oh, that\u2019s gunshots,\u2019\u201d Molina told CNN affiliate WCCO. He said he thought the sounds came from the floor below them. Molina said they left the apartment to see what was happening. He told WCCO he kept hearing gunshots and saw \u201cpeople shooting,\u201d but couldn\u2019t tell whether those opening fire were officers or civilians. \u201cWhen officers arrived, they received gunfire immediately and they exchanged gunfire,\u201d Blackwell said. Two officers \u2013 Nick Kapinos and Luke Kittock \u2013\u00a0who shot at the suspect are on critical incident leave, according to a Sunday news release from the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension. Kapinos has 10 years of law enforcement experience and Kittock has nine. Kittock was injured during the exchange of gunfire but was later treated and released from the hospital, authorities said. Forensic scientists are collecting evidence, and the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension is working with Minneapolis police to help determine the circumstances surrounding the shooting deaths. Authorities said Friday they are still working on gathering a timeline for the incident that unfolded. \u201cThere is both body-worn and squad car camera video of this incident,\u201d the bureau said in the news release Sunday. \u201cAgents are reviewing all available video as part of their active investigation.\u201d CNN has reached out to the Minneapolis Police Department for more information. \u2018This cannot be the norm\u2019 Across the country, the US has suffered at least 180 mass shootings in just the first five months of this year, according to the\u00a0Gun Violence Archive. Like CNN, the archive defines a mass shooting as one in which four or more people are shot, not including the shooter. And in the first four months of this year, at least 136 officers have been shot in the line of duty \u2013 including 20 who were killed, according to the National Fraternal Order of Police. \u201cThis cannot be the norm,\u201d Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said Thursday night. \u201cIt\u2019s now happened four times in the last couple of months where we\u2019ve had public safety officers responding to the call that people make to 911, rushing into that situation, and in this case being ambushed and a loss of life for Officer Mitchell.\u201d And even though Minneapolis is \u201cstrong\u201d and \u201cresilient,\u201d the mayor said, \u201cWe got to do everything possible to make sure that these tragic events, this epidemic of gun violence, this kind of stuff never happens again.\u201d This is a developing story and will be updated.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/30/us/minneapolis-incident-officers-injured/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/03/2024", "section": "us"}}
