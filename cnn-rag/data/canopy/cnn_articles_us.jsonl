{"id": "2024_06_27_us_bryan-kohberger-idaho-murder-trial-date", "text": "The murder trial of Bryan Kohberger, the criminology grad student accused of fatally stabbing four University of Idaho students in 2022, is set to begin June 2, 2025, according to a scheduling order filed in court. In a court hearing Thursday, Latah County Judge John Judge proposed the trial date as well as deadlines for other legal filings in the case. Both the prosecution and defense said the deadlines were \u201creasonable\u201d and agreed, although the defense added things could change depending on how the case progresses. Judge set aside about three months for the trial, including two weeks for jury selection, eight weeks for the trial, and two weeks for potential post-conviction death penalty hearings and sentencing. \u201cThis is a great step to set these deadlines and hearings so that we can move through this,\u201d Judge said. The order also indicates any motions challenging the death penalty are to be filed by September 5, with responses due by October 10. If a motion to change the venue is granted, \u201cthe Court anticipates that the trial dates will not change,\u201d the ruling states. Thursday\u2019s scheduling hearing was part of the long and winding road since\u00a0four University of Idaho\u00a0students \u2013 Kaylee Goncalves, Ethan Chapin, Xana Kernodle and Madison Mogen \u2013 were fatally stabbed in the overnight hours of November 13, 2022, at a home just off the school\u2019s main campus in Moscow. Kohberger, a Washington State University graduate student in criminology, was arrested in the killings on December 30, 2022, in his home state of Pennsylvania. A\u00a0not guilty plea was entered\u00a0on his behalf last year, and his\u00a0attorneys have indicated the 29-year-old intends to present an alibi as part of his defense. Prosecutors have said they will seek the death penalty. The\u00a0progression of the case\u00a0has been slowed by a series of pre-trial motions and hearings related to the death penalty, a gag order, the use of investigative genetic genealogy and Kohberger\u2019s proposed alibi. Several of the issues have still not been resolved. Judge\u00a0said in April\u00a0he wants a \u201chearing at least every month,\u201d noting the importance of \u201ccleaning up\u201d the legal proceedings. Last month, Goncalves\u2019 family expressed their frustration at the pace of the pre-trial hearings. \u201cThis case is turning into a hamster wheel of motions, hearings, and delayed decisions,\u201d the family said in a statement in May. \u201cCan we all just agree that this case needs to move forward and the judge needs to start setting hard deadlines in this case?\u201d In court Thursday, Judge expressed similar views. \u201cIn my opinion, we\u2019re getting to a point of diminishing returns,\u201d he said. The defense noted that some of the deadlines may need to be amended or extended as new information comes into the case, and Judge said he understood. \u201cI just don\u2019t want to be scrambling around a month before the trial. We\u2019re all going to be very, very busy, and the more we can resolve certain motions, supplements, whatever we need to do,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m trying to do this sooner than later.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/27/us/bryan-kohberger-idaho-murder-trial-date/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/29/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_26_business_economy-election-presidential-debate", "text": "Bill Clinton\u2019s campaign was right on the money when it coined the famous \u201cIt\u2019s the economy, stupid\u201d phrase in 1992. That\u2019s because the economy has consistently ranked among the top \u2014 if not the very top \u2014 voter issues in presidential election after presidential election. The current contest is far from an exception, with close to 90% of respondents in a May ABC News/Ipsos poll indicating that the economy is the most important issue in determining who gets their vote in November. That means it\u2019s all but guaranteed to be a major talking point during Thursday night\u2019s debate, which kicks off at 9 pm ET on CNN. President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump have polar opposite views on the economy \u2014 and both undoubtedly will try to sell you on their visions, policies and records. To make heads or tails of what they say (or if you\u2019re trying to impress anyone you might be watching the debate with), it\u2019s good to make sure you understand the economy we\u2019re in right now. Disclaimer: The topics below are in no way an exhaustive list of everything going on in the US economy, plus, everyone experiences it differently. Unemployment: Low, but with warning signs ahead The nation\u2019s unemployment rate stayed below 4% for 27 months, its longest such streak and a match for a period in the 1960s. That streak ended last month, when the unemployment rate rose to 4% from 3.9%. At the same time, the number of job openings in the US recently fell to a new three-year low, another sign of cooling in the labor market. That means job seekers might find it harder to get hired. In particular, the job market for recent college graduates has weakened. The unemployment rate for bachelor\u2019s degree recipients aged 20 to 29 is above 12%, an almost four-percentage-point increase from a year ago, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data. Inflation: Elevated, but cooling Inflation slowed more than expected last month, falling to 3.3% from 3.4% in April. By comparison, at this time last year it was 4%, and two years ago it was 9%. But there\u2019s a reason why you\u2019re probably feeling like everything is still really expensive. While discounts are starting to appear more at big-box retailers like Target and Walmart and fast-food giants like McDonald\u2019s and Wendy\u2019s, price cuts aren\u2019t occurring across the board. That\u2019s because when inflation cools off, it simply means that the pace of price increases is slowing. However, it does not mean that the actual prices we pay for goods and services are lower than they were a year ago. Housing: Still unaffordable Home prices are at a record high and have been climbing for 11 straight months as housing shortages persist. That\u2019s partly because many homeowners who locked in ultra-low mortgages during the pandemic don\u2019t want to move and risk having to pay a much higher mortgage rate. Average 30-year fixed-rate mortgages recently hit the highest level of the year. While they\u2019ve started to fall, mortgage rates are still higher than anything seen in the decade before 2022. Mortgage rates are so high in part because inflation is above the Fed\u2019s 2% target. As a result, the central bank has held off cutting interest rates, which would otherwise make it cheaper to get a mortgage. In turn, many would-be homebuyers are renting for longer than they otherwise may have, which is driving rents higher, too.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/26/business/economy-election-presidential-debate/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/29/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_26_us_robert-crimo-july-fourth-shooting-plea", "text": "Robert Crimo III, the man accused of opening fire from a rooftop onto Fourth of July parade revelers in Highland Park, Illinois, two years ago,\u00a0killing seven people\u00a0and injuring dozens, backed out of a proposed plea deal in a dramatic court hearing Wednesday. In court, prosecutors said they and Crimo had agreed to a deal in which Crimo would plead guilty to seven murder counts and 48 counts of aggravated battery, one for each named victim in the indictment. In exchange, he agreed to be sentenced to natural life in prison, and the rest of the charges would be dismissed. The judge then asked Crimo, who was brought into the room in a wheelchair, whether he accepted the plea deal, but he did not respond. His attorneys asked the court for a recess to discuss the deal with him further, and they then left the courtroom. When they returned, the judge again asked Crimo whether he wished to go forward with the plea deal, and he said \u201cNo.\u201d The judge then tentatively set a trial for February 25, 2025. Victims\u2019 family members and attorneys expressed their frustrations outside court Wednesday. \u201cWe came to court today in hopes that we could put this out of our minds,\u201d said Leah Sundheim, the daughter of victim Jacquelyn Sundheim. \u201cWe have the 4th of July coming up, and it will be two years, and all I wanted was to be able to fully grieve my mom without the looming trial, knowing he was going to spend the rest of his life in jail, and instead we were yet again shown his complete and blatant disregard for humans, for anyone, for all of us, in that courtroom.\u201d Crimo previously pleaded not guilty to 21 counts of first-degree murder \u2013 three for each deceased victim \u2013 as well as 48 counts of attempted murder and 48 counts of aggravated battery with a firearm for each victim struck by a bullet, bullet fragment or shrapnel, the prosecutor\u2019s office said. If convicted, he faces a maximum sentence of life in prison, as Illinois does not have the death penalty. The charges stem from the mass shooting in Highland Park, a wealthy suburb north of Chicago, at an Independence Day parade just after 10 a.m. The shooter was perched on a rooftop overlooking the parade route and used a high-powered rifle \u201csimilar to an AR-15\u201d to fire more than 70 rounds into the crowd, sending hundreds of attendees fleeing in terror, authorities said. Crimo, 21 at the time, dressed in women\u2019s clothing\u00a0to conceal his identity and used makeup to cover his tattoos during the shooting, according to investigators. Afterward, he allegedly left the roof and blended in with the fleeing crowd, sparking a regional hunt for his whereabouts. He was arrested after a brief car chase in nearby Lake Forest later that day. He admitted he carried out the attack and said he emptied two 30-round magazines before loading the weapon with a third and continuing to fire, authorities said in court. The attack left seven people dead, including five people over the age of 60. The victims were Katherine Goldstein, 64; Irina McCarthy, 35; Kevin McCarthy, 37; Jacquelyn Sundheim, 63; Stephen Straus, 88; Nicolas Toledo-Zaragoza, 78; and Eduardo Uvaldo, 69. Another 48 people were injured, including an 8-year-old boy who was paralyzed by a shot to the back. Attorneys and victims\u2019 families slam hearing This is not the first time Crimo has reversed himself on a key courtroom issue. In December, he asked to represent himself at trial, but then backed off that request and asked for a public defender less than a month later, according to CNN affiliate WLS. Outside court after Wednesday\u2019s hearing, several victims\u2019 families and their attorneys criticized Crimo and suggested he knew beforehand he would back out of the deal. \u201cHe is evil and manipulative and brought us here today probably knowing what he was going to do,\u201d Leah Sundheim said. Karina Mendez, the daughter of victim Eduardo Uvaldo, said she had been hoping for the best but knew it was not a done deal. \u201cI knew that could happen,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s been playing a lot of games.\u201d Antonio Romanucci, an attorney who represents several victims\u2019 families in civil suits, said Crimo was continuing to carry out a \u201creign of terror.\u201d \u201cThis was a calculated effort on his part to continue the suffering that our clients are going through,\u201d he said. He also acknowledged that those in court Wednesday had some skepticism about the plea deal. \u201cI know that there was a lot of disappointment and shock in the room when he said the word, \u2018No,\u2019 but to say that we were all entirely surprised by him, I think that would not be true, because we\u2019ve seen him do these things before,\u201d he said. \u201cThat was his opportunity to put his thumb in everyone\u2019s eye that was in that courtroom because he brought them in there.\u201d Lake County State\u2019s Attorney Eric Rinehart told reporters his team had been working with the victims and survivors to prepare for the hearing. \u201cWe are available for them not only throughout the rest of the day, but until this goes to trial,\u201d Rinehart said. \u201cWe will continue to support them. We will be ready for trial.\u201d Shooter legally purchased weapons despite run-ins with police The shooter legally purchased multiple weapons, including the one used in the attack, even though he had two encounters with police in 2019 related to threats to himself and others, according to authorities. Officers performed a welfare check on Crimo III in April 2019, after he \u201cattempted to commit suicide by machete,\u201d a police report states. An attorney for his parents has disputed details of the incidents described in police reports. Police returned to the home in September 2019 after a family member reported Crimo III said he was going to kill everyone, directing the threat at those in his home, according to a police report. Officers confiscated several knives from Crimo III\u2019s closet, but his\u00a0father retrieved them from the police station\u00a0later that day, per the report. Still, Crimo III bought five guns, including two rifles, in the years after the September 2019 visit from police, according to Chris Covelli, a spokesperson for the Lake County Major Crimes Task Force. The shooter\u2019s father, Robert Crimo Jr., pleaded guilty last November to seven counts of misdemeanor reckless conduct for signing his son\u2019s application\u00a0for an\u00a0Illinois Firearm Owners Identification card\u00a0in 2019, months after the police reports about his concerning behavior. The card is required for gun purchases in Illinois, and people under 21 need a guardian to sign the application. As part of the plea deal, Crimo Jr. was sentenced to 60 days in jail and two years of probation, and he agreed to testify against his son if called. Prior to the shooting, Crimo III posted music on several major streaming platforms under the pseudonym Awake the Rapper, and he apparently made and posted music videos online featuring ominous lyrics and animated scenes of gun violence. In one video entitled \u201cAre you Awake,\u201d a cartoon animation of a stick-figure shooter resembling the suspect\u2019s appearance is seen wearing tactical gear and carrying out an attack with a rifle. Crimo, seen with multicolored hair and face tattoos, narrates, \u201cI need to just do it. It is my destiny.\u201d In January 2023, Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker signed into law legislation that bans the sale of assault-style rifles and high-capacity magazines. The law also requires people who already own semi-automatic rifles to register their ownership. In November 2023, the Illinois Supreme Court upheld the law in a 4-3 ruling after\u00a0months of legal challenges, during which the Supreme Court had declined to intervene. This story has been updated with additional information. Correction:\u00a0An earlier version of this story understated the number of people injured in the shooting. It was 48.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/26/us/robert-crimo-july-fourth-shooting-plea/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/29/2024", "section": "us"}}

The lawsuit\u00a0was filed in 2021 by the ACLU of Vermont on behalf of Gregory Bombard, of St. Albans. It says Bombard\u2019s First Amendment rights were violated after an unnecessary traffic stop and retaliatory arrest in 2018. Trooper Jay Riggen stopped Bombard\u2019s vehicle in St. Albans on February 9, 2018, because he believed Bombard had shown him the middle finger, according to the lawsuit. Bombard denied that but says he did curse and display the middle finger once the initial stop was concluded. Bombard was stopped again and arrested on a charge of disorderly conduct, and his car was towed. He was jailed for over an hour and cited to criminal court, according to the ACLU. The charge was eventually dismissed.

{"id": "2024_06_27_us_uvalde-grand-jury-indictments-police-chief-officer", "text": "A grand jury has indicted two former Uvalde school police officers in the botched law enforcement response to the 2022 mass shooting at Robb Elementary school that left 19 children and two teachers dead, two Texas state government sources with knowledge of the indictment told CNN Thursday. Former Uvalde Consolidated Independent School District Police Chief Pete Arredondo and former school police officer Adrian Gonzales were named in the indictments, which represent the first criminal charges filed in the school massacre. Arredondo surrendered himself to the custody of the Texas Rangers in Uvalde on Thursday, an official with the Texas Department of Public Safety told CNN. The former chief was booked on 10 counts of child endangerment and known criminal negligence, according to the indictment. Arredondo was then released\u00a0on bond, according to the Uvalde County Jail. Gonzales was booked into the Uvalde County Jail early Friday afternoon, the Uvalde Leader-News reported, citing Uvalde County Sheriff\u2019s Office Chief Deputy Brandon McCutchen. Gonzales was waiting to be processed, McCutchen told the paper. Earlier in the day, Gonzales\u2019 attorney Nico LaHood told CNN in a statement the former school police officer was planning to self-surrender \u201cso the judicial process can move forward.\u201d \u201cIt is very early on in our representation, so we will be working to acquire the evidence, the government is relying on, in this accusation,\u201d LaHood said. \u201cMr. Gonzales\u2019 position is he did not violate school district policy or state law. The application of this statute, to law enforcement, under these circumstances is unprecedented in the state of Texas. It will take time to evaluate these allegations and the underlying facts,\u201d LaHood continued. CNN has reached out to the Uvalde County Jail for more information. The indictment against Gonzales was not immediately available from the Uvalde County District Court clerk\u2019s office. \u201cOur administration has not been contacted by the District Attorney\u2019s Office regarding any of our staff and we don\u2019t have any comment at this time regarding the matter,\u201d the Uvalde Police Department said in a statement on Facebook Thursday night. The Uvalde County District Attorney\u2019s office is not planning to file any more indictments in the botched response to the shooting, according to family members who have spoken to District Attorney Christina Mitchell. Kimberly Mata-Rubio, the mother of 10-year-old victim Lexi Rubio, and Brett Cross, the guardian of 10-year-old victim Uziyah Garcia, told CNN they were informed by Mitchell there would be no further indictments coming out of the grand jury. \u201cI\u2019m glad two people are indicted,\u201d Mata-Rubio told CNN Friday. \u201cIt\u2019s not justice until there are convictions. But I am also aware that there were others at fault that day, and it\u2019s hard to accept that they will not face any consequences.\u201d \u201cI would be lying if I didn\u2019t say I feel like that\u2019s not enough,\u201d Cross told CNN. Arredondo faces 10 felony charges of child endangerment for failing to recognize the incident as an active shooting and for failing to take proper action to intervene, the indictment says, and these behaviors placed each child in \u201cimminent danger of bodily injury, death, physical impairment and mental impairment.\u201d Gonzales also faces felony charges of abandoning and endangering a child, Mitchell, the Uvalde district attorney, told the Uvalde Leader-News. The district attorney\u2019s office declined to comment to CNN Friday. Family members of the victims have been meeting with the DA\u2019s office to discuss the results of the months-long grand jury investigation, according to Brett Cross, the guardian of 10-year-old Uziyah Garcia, one of the fourth graders killed in the shooting rampage. Jesse Rizo, the uncle of one of the students killed, Jacklyn Cazares, said he was pleasantly surprised to learn about two officers\u2019 indictments, but had hoped more people were faced with criminal charges, he told CNN\u2019s Kate Bolduan Friday. \u201cIt\u2019s the beginning of something, right?\u201d Rizo said. \u201cBut in order to bring closure, you would want all the officers that didn\u2019t do their job that day, that failed to respond appropriately, you would want them to be held accountable in an equal way.\u201d Rizo hopes the DA will explain her intentions in public and indicate if any more indictments can be expected, he said. \u201cA lot of us are not exposed to the daily legalities of all these things, so we get a little confused with the technical things that go on,\u201d Rizo said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of questions that need to be answered as well.\u201d The Uvalde Consolidated Independent School District offered its condolences to the families of the victims Friday, saying it had no further information to add. \u201cAs with the rest of the Uvalde community, we have only just learned about the grand jury decision regarding two indictments being issued,\u201d school district spokeswoman Anne Marie Espinoza said in a statement. How the fallout unfolded Earlier this year, the\u00a0US Justice Department\u00a0released a damning report that concluded law enforcement officers had\u00a0many opportunities to reassess their flawed response\u00a0to the May 24, 2022, shooting at Robb Elementary School. Bursts of gunfire, reports a teacher had been shot and then a desperate call from a student trapped with the gunman could \u2013 and should \u2013 all have prompted a drive to stop the bloodshed far sooner, said the report. Instead, it took 77 minutes from when the 18-year-old shooter walked into Robb Elementary School until he was stopped. The carnage remains among the\u00a0deadliest\u00a0episodes in America\u2019s\u00a0ongoing scourge\u00a0of campus shootings. Critical failures in leadership\u00a0among specific law enforcement officers who rushed to Robb Elementary are cited by the Justice Department, whose\u00a0575-page report\u00a0was released nearly 20 months after the massacre. Arredondo was fired\u00a0in August 2022 for his role in the failed response. In May, his replacement, Joshua Gutierrez, submitted his\u00a0resignation and his last day on the job was Wednesday, according to a school official\u2019s statement. Gonzales, who had been with school district police since July 2021 and previously with Uvalde police since 2009, told investigators he was at the high school when he heard a report of a vehicle accident by Robb Elementary and went to check. Gonzales, who said he was one of the first officers to arrive, heard shots and entered the south hallway along with Arredondo. Gonzales said he tried to call for the SWAT team on his radio but could not transmit inside the school building so he left. \u201cOnce I got out to get radio reception, I never went back in,\u201d he told investigators. While the gunman was unchallenged inside the school, Gonzales said he spent much of the time waiting with emergency medics outside the west door. He also found a set of keys and a plan of the school, he said, that had been requested by a Texas Ranger on scene. State Sen. Roland Gutierrez told CNN Thursday he believes the Texas Department of Public Safety also bears substantial responsibility for the failed law enforcement response and should have been included in the indictments. \u201cThis is nothing but a whitewash of the most tragic mass shooting in our nation\u2019s history \u2013 one of them at least \u2013 and certainly the worst officer-involved response to a mass shooting in our nation\u2019s history. And all\u00a0of it falls in the hands of the Department of Public Safety and (its director) Steve McCraw.\u201d During the fallout following the massacre, DPS Director Steven McCraw repeatedly called the law enforcement response to the shooting an \u201cabject failure\u201d and said each of its officers\u2019 actions would be internally investigated and scrutinized by the district attorney. \u201cIt was more than an abject failure and it\u2019s a crime not to indict those officers,\u201d Gutierrez said. CNN has sought comment from the state\u2019s Department of Public Safety. Officers, school employees and shooting victims testified before grand jury Multiple law enforcement officers who responded to the shooting, including members of the Texas Department of Public Safety, were ordered to testify before the grand jury, CNN previously reported. School employees and victims of the shooting began their testimony before the grand jury in March \u2013 shortly after the Uvalde City Council\u00a0released an independent report clearing all local officers of wrongdoing. The independent investigator hired by the city\u00a0reported his findings at a packed city council meeting, saying all the officers who responded to the school from the Uvalde Police Department acted in good faith and should be exonerated. The findings sparked the fury of many victims\u2019 parents and community members who have\u00a0said for nearly two years that some should not be absolved. Less than a week after the release of the report, Uvalde Police Chief Daniel Rodriguez abruptly announced he would resign, effective April 6, saying it was time for \u201ca new chapter\u201d in his career. Federal report describes failed police response The Justice Department report dismissed the early official narrative of brave first responders saving lives that day and said \u201cmany victims shared that it added to their pain during a challenging time.\u201d The report found ample problems also emerged after the gunman was killed \u2013 from getting students away from the school and reunited with families to how bereaved parents were told their children were dead, the release of information about what happened, and the provision of therapy services. The report describes the quick arrival of law enforcement officers who ran toward the sound of gunfire, then almost immediately stopped once they got near the classrooms where the gunman was killing fourth graders and educators. That decision ran counter to\u00a0widely established active shooter response protocol, which instructs law enforcement to move toward and eliminate any threat. Instead, the intensity level dropped as responders began to treat the situation as a \u201cbarricaded suspect\u201d operation that did not need immediate action, even as more officers arrived and the signals of ongoing danger multiplied. That was the \u201csingle most critical tactical failure,\u201d the team from the Justice Department\u2019s Office of Community Oriented Policing Services found. In May, 19 families of the students and teachers killed or injured in the mass shooting said they settled a lawsuit with the city for $2 million and announced they are suing 92 officers with Texas Department of Public Safety, the school district and individual employees. The city confirmed the settlement in a statement. \u201cIt has been an unbearable two years,\u201d Javier Cazares, the father of 9-year-old victim Jacklyn Cazares, said at a May news conference. \u201cWe all know who took our children\u2019s lives, but there was an obvious systemic failure out there on May 24.

{"id": "2024_06_28_us_parkland-school-shooting-nikolas-cruz-anthony-borges", "text": "A survivor of the 2018 shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, now owns the rights to the gunman\u2019s name, according to a new settlement agreement that also stipulates the shooter must donate his brain for scientific study. As part of the settlement, the shooter agreed to transfer the rights to his name, Nikolas Cruz, for use in any production, movie, book, television, cable TV, or other media. The gunman,\u00a0who is serving a life sentence\u00a0without the possibility of parole, is barred from giving any interviews without the express written consent of shooting survivor Anthony Borges, according to the settlement. The gunman, who no longer has legal representation, declined to have an attorney review the settlement, Borges\u2019 attorney Alex Arreaza said. Borges was shot five times during the February 14, 2018, massacre that left 17 students and staff members dead. At 15 years old, he was the most gravely wounded of the 17 shooting survivors. Borges,\u00a0who barricaded a door with his body, suffered extensive injuries to his legs and torso, including the removal of a third of his lung. He spent weeks in the hospital recovering. Borges settled his civil lawsuit with the shooter weeks before the case was scheduled for trial next month. \u201cWe wanted complete accountability,\u201d Arreaza told CNN. \u201cPeople sit in prison and don\u2019t have things to do. They get bored. We wanted to shut him down completely. His story will be told by the victims, not by him.\u201d The settlement prevents the gunman from talking to the media or making money by telling his story. \u201cIt took a lot to coordinate all that,\u201d Arreaza said. \u201cOur objective was to get closure for Anthony and his family.\u201d The settlement is similar to the \u201cSon of Sam\u00a0law\u201d passed in New York in the 1970s after the conviction of serial killer David Berkowitz. The law prevents criminals from profiting from books or shows about their crimes by allowing states to seize any proceeds and use them to compensate victims\u2019 families. Similar laws have been invoked many times, but in 1991 the US Supreme Court ruled that they infringed on First Amendment rights. \u201cAnthony doesn\u2019t want to walk in his house one day and see a Netflix special that (the gunman) was talking about his thoughts on what he did,\u201d Arreaza said. \u201cThis was a way we could shut it down. Anthony ultimately has control.\u201d Arreaza said he is not worried about enforcing the settlement, now or in the future. \u201cIf (the shooter) goes to give an interview now, he might be able to slip one under the wire,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we\u2019re going to have the power to go back into court and shut him down. He will be more trouble ten years from now when he starts getting bored.\u201d The settlement also requires the gunman to donate his body, including his brain, to science. According to court documents, \u201c(the shooter) agrees to participate in any scientific, physiological, psychological and/or anthropological study and upon death agrees that his physical body, including all organs and brain, will be donated to an institution of Anthony Borges\u2019 choosing for scientific study in an effort to help prevent such tragic events from ever happening again.\u201d \u201cHopefully, you can find something from that and prevent future incidents,\u201d Arreaza said. \u201cMaybe something can help, but it won\u2019t happen unless it\u2019s studied.\u201d The gunman agreed to the settlement terms during a Zoom call. Borges did not participate, but his father did. Court documents show the gunman also agreed to assign any financial interest in any insurance policies he stands to benefit from to Borges. The shooter was named as the beneficiary in at least one insurance policy from his adoptive mother, estimated at\u00a0$430,000. This is not the first civil settlement reached in the Marjory Stoneman Douglas shooting. In 2021, the Broward County Public School District paid\u00a0more than $26 million\u00a0to the shooting victims and families of the 17 people killed. Borges received $1.25 million. There are still pending civil lawsuits against former School Resource Officer Scot Peterson and the Broward County Sheriff\u2019s Office. More than six years after the shooting, Borges, now 21, is working to move on with his life. He still lives in South Florida and testified in the shooter\u2019s trial in 2022 and Peterson\u2019s criminal trial last year. Peterson was acquitted of criminal charges for failing to confront the gunman. Borges\u2019 family did not want him to endure another trial, so they sought a settlement. \u201cHe\u2019s healed physically, but the PTSD is still a real problem,\u201d Arreaza said. \u201cWe were concerned that the trial and everything that comes with it would push him back further.\u201d Before the shooting, Borges planned to play soccer professionally in Brazil. That won\u2019t happen now due to the severity of his injuries. He moved to a new city in South Florida, and Arreaza said he was glad that the 1200 Building on the high school\u2019s campus was being demolished. \u201cEvery time he drove by there, it brought back memories,\u201d Arreaza said. \u201cHe could just hear things in his head. He\u2019s very glad to see it torn down.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/28/us/parkland-school-shooting-nikolas-cruz-anthony-borges/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/29/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_05_30_us_kohberger-idaho-killings-pretrial-hearings", "text": "After yet another pre-trial hearing in Bryan Kohberger\u2019s quadruple murder trial in early May, the family of one of the victims openly criticized the slow pace of the proceedings. \u201cThis case is turning into a hamster wheel of motions, hearings, and delayed decisions,\u201d the \u201cincredibly frustrated\u201d family of slain University of Idaho student Kaylee Goncalves said in a statement. The criticism stemmed from the long and winding road that\u2019s unfolded since four University of Idaho students \u2013 Goncalves, Ethan Chapin, Xana Kernodle and Madison Mogen \u2013 were fatally stabbed in the overnight hours of November 13, 2022, at a home just off the school\u2019s main campus in Moscow. Kohberger, a Washington State University graduate student in criminology, was arrested in the killings on December 30, 2022, in his home state of Pennsylvania. A\u00a0not guilty plea was entered on his behalf in May 2023, and his\u00a0attorneys have indicated the 29-year-old intends to present an alibi as part of his defense. Prosecutors have said they will seek the death penalty. The trial is set to begin June 2, 2025, according to a scheduling order filed in court. Still, the progression of the case has been slowed by a series of pre-trial motions and hearings. Latah County Judge John Judge said in April he wants a \u201chearing at least every month,\u201d noting the importance of \u201ccleaning up\u201d the legal proceedings. The hearings largely fall into a few different buckets. One relates to the defense attorneys\u2019 access to evidence, particularly how the prosecution used investigative genetic genealogy in building the case. A second set of hearings concerns Kohberger\u2019s proposed alibi for his innocence. Third, there have be a number of hearings related to a gag order that restricts what the parties can publicly say about the case. Here\u2019s a timeline of some of the notable pre-trial hearings and decisions so far: June 9, 2023: A coalition of media organizations and the family of a murder victim came to court to challenge the gag order placed on the parties in the case. June 23, 2023: The judge denied both requests but issued a revised gag order that allows the parties to discuss topics that do not have a \u201csubstantial likelihood of materially prejudicing or otherwise influencing the outcome of the case.\u201d August 2, 2023: Kohberger\u2019s attorneys said they would\u00a0use an alibi defense but couldn\u2019t pin down their client\u2019s specific location on the night of the killings because he was \u201cdriving during the late night and early morning hours.\u201d \u201cMr.\u00a0Kohberger\u00a0is not claiming to be at a specific location at a specific time; at this time there is not a specific witness to say precisely where Mr.\u00a0Kohberger\u00a0was at each moment of the hours\u201d of the attacks, his attorneys said in a court filing. October 26, 2023: The judge denied a\u00a0request to dismiss the grand jury indictment after the defense argued there was an error in the grand jury instructions. December 18, 2023: The judge denied a second motion to dismiss the indictment after the defense argued prosecutors failed to comply fully with state rules on jury selection and the jury questionnaire. February 28, 2024: Defense attorney Anne C. Taylor asked the court to allow three defense experts and others to view the investigative genetic genealogy evidence, which has been sealed, to understand the full timeline of how police began to focus on Kohberger. Genetic genealogy is a practice that blends DNA analysis in the lab with genealogical research, such as tracing a person\u2019s family tree. In this case, investigators found a single source of male DNA on the button snap of a leather knife sheath left at the crime scene,\u00a0according to a probable cause affidavit. FBI investigators loaded the DNA profile to public genealogy sites to search for a match and then sent a tip to investigate Kohberger, according to a prosecution court filing. The judge initially declined to give the defense investigators extended access to the investigative genetic genealogy, saying he would rather the experts already approved to view the material give justification for digging deeper. April 4, 2024: The judge criticized Kohberger\u2019s defense attorney, saying she commissioned phone surveys to potential jurors that could hinder Kohberger\u2019s ability to get a fair trial. However, Taylor said the judge violated her client\u2019s right to due process by ordering a stop to the anonymous survey without hearing the defense\u2019s side first. April 17, 2024: Kohberger\u2019s defense lawyers filed a court document saying they plan\u00a0to offer a cell phone tower and radio frequency expert to partially corroborate\u00a0his proposed alibi that he was out driving west of Moscow\u00a0on the night of the slayings. April 19, 2024: The judge allowed surveys conducted with potential jurors to continue \u201cwithout modification\u201d after temporarily pausing them. April 29, 2024: The prosecution asked the court to deny Kohberger the opportunity to add to his alibi and to preclude anyone other than the defendant to testify as to his whereabouts on the night of the murders. May 2, 2024: Kohberger\u2019s defense had asked for an upcoming evidentiary hearing with witnesses be made public, while the prosecution asked that it be sealed. The judge ruled that it will be closed to the public. May 23, 2024: Taylor, the defense attorney, questioned a Moscow police detective about the preparation of visual cell phone logs and methods for searching for certain videos. The testimony was related to two motions to compel prosecutors to share discovery with the defense, but the contents of the motions are sealed, so it was not clear what they were requesting. May 30, 2024: The Moscow police detective leading the investigation and a defense expert in cell phone location data testified that the defense has not received some key evidence in the case. Cpl. Brett Payne, the lead investigator on the case, testified he and other investigators collected thousands of hours of video surveillance as they tried to locate a white Hyundai Elantra connected to the suspect. The videos are saved on various thumb drives, but there is no central inventory of the videos, he testified. He also said investigators did not see on any of the videos the Elantra going south from Moscow toward Pullman, Washington, in the early morning hours after the killings. The probable cause affidavit used in the case alleges Kohberger drove south toward Pullman after he committed the four killings. Sy Ray, an expert on cell phone geolocation data, testified that he has not been provided the underlying AT&T source data and list of nearby cell towers that was used by detectives to create a map of Kohberger\u2019s movements with his cell phone. Based on the data he had received, he believed some statements in the records were not accurate, and he said the missing data could be helpful to the defense. \u201cBecause of the piecemealing of the data, because of the missing data, because of data that I\u2019m reviewing that is incredibly inaccurate, everything that is missing is absolutely to the benefit of the defense right now,\u201d he said. June 7, 2024: After previously restricting who had access to the investigative genetic genealogy evidence, the judge ruled to allow unnamed \u201cdefense investigators\u201d to view the material. June 27, 2024: The parties agreed to go to trial around this time next year, with a scheduling order filed in court establishing the start date as June 2, 2025. Judge set aside about three months for the trial, including two weeks for jury selection, eight weeks for the trial and two weeks for potential post-conviction hearings and sentencing. \u201cThis is a great step to set these deadlines and hearings so that we can move through this,\u201d he said. The scheduling order also indicates any motions challenging the death penalty are to be filed by September 5, with responses due by October 10. If a motion to change the venue is granted, \u201cthe Court anticipates that the trial dates will not change,\u201d the ruling states.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/30/us/kohberger-idaho-killings-pretrial-hearings/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/29/2024", "section": "us"}}

Controllers and pilots warned the crew of\u00a0Southwest\u00a04805 several times that the runway was closed, the recordings made by LiveATC.net show.\u00a0The incident is now under investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board and Federal Aviation Administration, and\u00a0Southwest\u00a0says it is engaged with both regulators. For the last several months the runway has been closed overnight for a taxiway construction project, and it reopens each morning at 5:45 a.m., according to the Portland International Jetport. A controller said on the recordings that the tower is also closed overnight. \u201cThere\u2019s an airport vehicle,\u201d one voice warned over the radio. Said another:\u00a0 \u201cThe\u00a0Southwest\u00a0pulling on to 29, just so you know there is a vehicle on the runway and it is still closed.\u201d But the\u00a0Southwest\u00a0pilots apparently never heard the warnings.\u00a0 They were recorded communicating on a different radio frequency with regional air traffic controllers near Boston. The Boston controller later told\u00a0Southwest\u00a0they departed three minutes before the runway reopened. Boston controller:\u00a0\u201cThat runway was closed.\u201d Southwest\u00a0pilot:\u00a0\u201cI thought it opened at :45.\u00a0 There was no markings or anywhere.\u201d Controller:\u00a0\u201cIt did open at :45, but you departed at :42.\u201d Pilot:\u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s not what we\u2019re showing, but ok.\u201d The FAA told CNN the runway was indeed closed at the time, and that the \u201cairport vehicle exited the runway before the plane began its takeoff roll.\u201d It is unclear how close the plane came to colliding with the runway crew.\u00a0 The tower controller told the workers over the radio that he knew \u201cyou were on the runway and had to exit\u201d because of the takeoff.

The body of 52-year-old Kyle Kreykes was discovered on Monday after he was reported missing by his family on June 21, Rock Valley Police Chief Monte Warburton told CNN on Friday. Kreykes had drowned in the flooded basement of his home where he lived alone, Warburton said. Officials could not search Kreykes\u2019s home for several days due to the high water levels, Warburton said. Large pumps were brought in to remove the floodwaters. President Joe Biden issued a disaster declaration for several Iowa counties Monday, including Clay County. At least two other deaths have been reported due to the flooding, officials in Iowa and South Dakota said. In Clay County, a man died after attempting to drive a pickup truck across rapid floodwaters on Saturday in the city of Spencer, according to a news release from the Clay County Sheriff\u2019s Office on Tuesday. The man, who was from Elburn, Illinois, was swept away and found floating in the Little Sioux River, officials said. At the time, \u201crecovery efforts were not attempted due to the very dangerous situations,\u201d the release said. Officials recovered the man\u2019s body Tuesday morning.

{"id": "2024_06_27_us_minneapolis-juror-bribery-indictment", "text": "Federal charges have been filed against five people linked to a recent attempt to\u00a0bribe a juror\u00a0to help secure a not guilty verdict in a trial over a $250 million fraud scheme that exploited a federally funded child nutrition program, the US attorney in Minnesota announced in a news conference Wednesday. The juror, identified only as \u201cJuror 52,\u201d immediately called 911 to report the attempt after a gift bag containing $120,000 in cash was dropped off at her front door earlier this month, FBI Special Agent\u00a0Travis Wilmer said in an affidavit filed June 3 in federal court. Three of those charged this week, Abdimajid Nur, Abdiaziz Farah and Said Farah, were defendants in the fraud trial connected to Feeding Our Future, a nonprofit organization prosecutors say was used to skim nearly $250 million from federal child nutrition programs. Juror 52, who is not accused of any wrongdoing, was dismissed from the case and replaced with an alternate. Nur and Abdiaziz Farah were convicted of wire fraud, bribery, money laundering, conspriacy and other crimes, while Said Farah was acquitted, according to a Justice Department news release and agency spokesperson Tasha Zerna. Court documents state Juror 52 was targeted \u201cbecause she was the youngest juror and they believed her to be the only juror of color.\u201d Included with the alleged bribery money was a document described by US Attorney Andrew Luger as \u201cchilling.\u201d The document laid out instructions for the juror to follow with arguments for her to use to sway other jurors, the indictment states. Those arguments focus on an assertion of prejudice by the government based on the defendants\u2019 immigration status and race, according to the indictment. Luger said the note inside the gift bag also included a clear message to the juror that read, \u201cYou alone can end this case.\u201d Nur recruited Ladan Ali, a woman who \u201cattempted to follow\u201d the juror home after the first day of closing arguments and two days later dropped off the gift bag containing the bribery money at the juror\u2019s house and gave it to a relative, the indictment says. Said Farah allegedly provided the funds. Another defendant, Abdulkarim Farah, accompanied Ali and videotaped her dropping off the money, according to the indictment.\u00a0Abdiaziz Farah, Said Farah and Abdulkarim Farah are brothers. CNN has reached out to attorneys for all five defendants for comment. The\u00a0charges they face\u00a0include bribery of a juror, conspiracy to bribe a juror and corruptly influencing a juror. When the\u00a0alleged\u00a0bribery attempt was announced in court, all defendants in the trial were ordered to turn their phones in to authorities. Abdiaziz Farah engaged a factory reset\u00a0in an attempt to wipe\u00a0all the data from his device, according to court documents.\u00a0He also faces a count of obstruction of justice connected to that allegation. Recovered videos from the phones of the defendants include recordings of the bribe money being dropped off at Juror 52\u2019s home, according to the indictment. \u201cThey took the video to ensure that the money was delivered and as evidence to show Juror 52\u2019s complicity if she accepted the bribe but did not follow through with a not guilty verdict,\u201d the indictment states. Days later, a search warrant was served at Abdiaziz Farah\u2019s home, and among the items found by investigators was a list of all the jurors\u2019\u00a0names hidden inside a water bottle,\u00a0a DOJ warrant shows. Fingerprints from the bag of money led investigators to Ladan\u00a0Ali,\u00a0Luger said.\u00a0During Wednesday\u2019s news conference, Luger shared surveillance images he says show Ali in a rental car following\u00a0Juror\u00a052 home from court. \u201cThis is more than just a mob movie. This is a chilling attack on our system of justice,\u201d he added. \u201cThey studied her, followed her and determined that she would succumb to their scheme. The fact that they failed does not lessen the magnitude of what they tried to do,\u201d said Luger. \u201cFortunately for all of us, Juror 52 could not be bought, and she terminated their scheme.\u201d \u201cThe sophistication and intentionality of this plot cannot be overstated,\u201d said Luger, adding Juror 52\u2019s movements were tracked night and day. The three Farah brothers are scheduled to make their initial appearances on the charges in federal court Thursday afternoon. Ladan Ali is expected to turn herself in later this week, and Abdimajid Nur is set to appear in court next week, according to Zerna.

You can also follow\u00a0CNN\u2019s live debate coverage on\u00a0CNN.com, which will include analysis and fact checking. What were the qualifications? Biden and Trump will be the only presidential candidates participating in the debate. In order to qualify, candidates had to satisfy the requirements outlined in Article II, Section 1 of the US Constitution to serve as president, as well as file a formal statement of candidacy with the Federal Election Commission. According to parameters set by CNN in May, all participating debaters had to appear on a sufficient number of state ballots to reach the 270 electoral vote threshold to win the presidency and receive at least 15% in four separate national polls of registered or likely voters that meet CNN\u2019s standards for reporting. Polls that meet those standards are those sponsored by CNN, ABC News, CBS News, Fox News, Marquette University Law School, Monmouth University, NBC News, The New York Times/Siena College, NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist College, Quinnipiac University, The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post. Biden and Trump were the only candidates to meet those requirements. The pair has also agreed to participate in another debate hosted by ABC on September 10. What are the rules of the debate? The debate will include two commercial breaks, according to the network, and campaign staff may not interact with their candidate during that time. The candidates agreed to appear at a uniform podium. Microphones will be muted throughout the debate except for the candidate whose turn it is to speak. While no props or pre-written notes will be allowed on the stage, candidates will be given a pen, a pad of paper and a bottle of water. The event will not feature a studio audience. Catch up on CNN\u2019s recent campaign coverage What to watch: Abortion, the economy and the Israel-Hamas war are sure to be among the most important issues discussed at Thursday night\u2019s debate.

{"id": "2024_06_26_us_nyc-public-schools-cell-phone-ban", "text": "Adding to a growing list of school districts banning cell phones, the nation\u2019s largest could be moving to do the same as early as January. Phone usage during the school day has not only become a distraction, but an addiction, David Banks, the chancellor of New York City Public Schools, said during an on-camera interview with WNYW. \u201cWe recognize the problem and that it is a major issue,\u201d Banks said. The chancellor said he expects a formal announcement to be made as soon as he\u00a0fine-tunes how to implement a plan that would impact more than 1 million students across nearly 2,000 public schools in the city. Wednesday is the last day of school for the system before the summer break. New York\u2019s decision comes on the heels of the Los Angeles Unified School District moving to ban cell phones in schools just last week. The moves from two of the country\u2019s largest school districts highlight a frustration shared by educators from coast to coast. In the United States, 72% of high school teachers said cell phone distraction is \u201ca major problem in the classroom,\u201d according to a report last week by the\u00a0Pew Research Center. \u201cIn about two weeks, you\u2019re going to hear a big announcement from us,\u201d Banks told CNN affiliate, NY1 on Wednesday, adding the change could go into effect as early as January 2025. \u201cWe\u2019re still looking at the logistics of how you would actually roll it out in a system this large,\u201d Banks told WNYW. \u201cWe\u2019ll have those kinks worked out in the next couple weeks.\u201d CNN reached out to the chancellor\u2019s office which deferred to his interviews, offering no further comment. Meanwhile, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul is considering state-level action on the issue of smartphones in schools, according to a spokesperson. States including Oklahoma, Kansas, Vermont, Ohio, Louisiana and Pennsylvania have all introduced similar legislation. Hundreds of principals have told Banks to\u00a0\u201ctake\u00a0the phones,\u201d according to local interviews he\u2019s done with local media. Some parents, though, aren\u2019t sold on the idea. Banks has heard parents\u2019 concerns that a ban would prevent them from staying in touch with their children during an emergency, he said. \u201cWe want you to be able to bring your phone to school because the minute that school is over you need to be in communication with your family,\u201d Banks told NY1. \u201cWe can\u2019t control what happens once they\u2019re home,\u201d he said, \u201cbut maybe six to eight hours out of the day, we might have a little bit more control.\u201d Former New York Mayor\u00a0Bill de Blasio allowed phones back into schools in 2015 after they were barred by his City Hall predecessor Mike Bloomberg. Bloomberg penned\u00a0an op-ed\u00a0Tuesday headlined,\u00a0\u201cAdams must reinstate NYC schools\u2019 former cellphone ban \u2013 for our kids\u2019 sake.\u201d New York Mayor Eric Adams supports the move. \u201cThe distractions that come from cell phones is serious and we can\u2019t ignore that,\u201d Adams said during a news conference Tuesday. City Hall is looking for a \u201csweet spot\u201d to \u201cget parents in a comfortable place,\u201d he said. Adams did not respond to requests for further comment.

{"id": "2024_06_28_us_karen-read-murder-trial-jury", "text": "The Massachusetts judge presiding over the Karen Read murder trial ordered the jury to continue deliberations after the jurors sent a note Friday saying they could not reach a unanimous verdict. The six man and six woman jury in the trial of Read, who is accused of drunkenly driving into her police officer boyfriend and leaving him to die in January 2022, informed the court shortly after midday, saying, \u201cDespite our exhaustive review of the evidence and our diligent consideration of all disputed evidence, we have been unable to reach unanimous verdict.\u201d After hearing arguments from the prosecution and defense, Norfolk County Superior Court Judge Beverly Cannone asked the jury to continue to deliberate. \u201cLunch will be arriving shortly, when it comes, I\u2019d ask you to clear your heads, have lunch and begin your deliberations again,\u201d Cannone told the jurors. After the judge\u2019s order, the jury continued deliberating until shortly after 4 p.m. local time. Deliberations will resume Monday morning at 9 a.m., the judge announced. The jury has been deliberating Read\u2019s fate since midday Tuesday. The case has featured accusations of a vast police cover-up as well as allegations of improper conduct and sexist text messages from a lead investigator. The prosecution and defense both weighed in on the jury\u2019s note, asking the judge to consider different outcomes in her decision on what to tell the jury. \u201cIt is far, far, far too early in their deliberative process to even consider giving them any kind of Tuey-Rodriguez instruction or anything close to that,\u201d Norfolk County Assistant District Attorney Adam Lally said, referring to a special set of Massachusetts instructions that are read to a jury when jurors are unable to agree on a verdict. \u201cThe note doesn\u2019t really indicate affirmatively that they can\u2019t come to a conclusion, it just says they haven\u2019t come to a conclusion through their deliberative process at this time.\u201d Alternately, defense attorney David Yanetti argued the jury should be read the Tuey-Rodriguez criminal model instructions, indicating that they would like the court to proceed toward having a hung jury. \u201cThe word exhaustive is the word I think that\u2019s operative here,\u201d he told the judge. \u201cThey are communicating to the court that they\u2019ve exhausted all manner of compromise, all manner of persuasion, and they\u2019re at an impasse.\u201d The judge said she weighed both counsel\u2019s views in deciding to send the jury back to deliberate a verdict in the controversial case. The Tuey-Rodriguez instructions were not read to the jury. Case law cautions against reading the instruction prematurely. Read, 45, pleaded not guilty to charges of second-degree murder, vehicular manslaughter while intoxicated and leaving the scene of a collision resulting in death. If found guilty of second-degree murder, Read faces a maximum sentence of life in prison, according to\u00a0Massachusetts law. The body of her boyfriend, Boston Police Officer John O\u2019Keefe, was found bruised and battered in the snow on January 29, 2022, outside the home of a fellow Boston police officer in Canton, Massachusetts. Prosecutors have alleged Read and O\u2019Keefe, who had an at-times tumultuous relationship, got into an argument that night, and that she drunkenly backed into him and fled the scene, leaving him to die in the cold. \u201cWhat the constellation of the facts and the evidence ineluctably demonstrate here is that the defendant drove her vehicle in reverse at 24.2 miles per hour for 62.5 feet, struck Mr. O\u2019Keefe, causing those catastrophic head injuries, leaving him incapacitated and freezing him to death,\u201d prosecutor Adam Lally said in closing arguments Tuesday. In contrast, Read\u2019s defense has accused off-duty police inside that Canton home of fatally beating O\u2019Keefe, dumping his body on the lawn and then conspiring through fabricated evidence and false testimony to frame Read. \u201cLadies and gentlemen, there was a cover-up in this case, plain and simple,\u201d defense attorney Alan Jackson said. \u201cYou\u2019ll surely say to yourself, \u2018I don\u2019t want to believe it, I don\u2019t want to believe that could happen in our community,\u2019 but sadly over these past eight weeks you\u2019ve seen it right before your eyes.\u201d The closing arguments represented the end of a murder trial that has garnered interest both local and widespread, including accusations of witness tampering, a federal probe into the investigation, and groups of pink-wearing supporters chanting to \u201cFree Karen Read.\u201d The prosecution\u2019s case also has been hampered by a series of missteps and unusual investigative practices. Most notably, a lead investigator in the case, Massachusetts State Police Trooper Michael Proctor, admitted that he sent a series of sexist and offensive texts about Read in a private group chat, calling her a \u201cwhack job,\u201d mocking her medical issues and commenting to coworkers that he had found \u201cno nudes\u201d while searching her phone for evidence, CNN affiliate WCVB reported. Proctor apologized for the \u201cunprofessional\u201d comments on the stand, but the vulgar texts have been sharply criticized in and out of court, including from the governor. \u201cIt\u2019s completely unprofessional,\u201d Gov. Maura Healey told WCVB of the texts. \u201cIt does harm, frankly, to the dignity and the integrity of the work of men and women across the state police and law enforcement. So as a former attorney general and as governor, I am disgusted by that.\u201d This story has been updated with additional information.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/28/us/karen-read-murder-trial-jury/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/29/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_27_us_health-care-fraud-crackdown", "text": "The Justice Department announced a sweeping series of charges Thursday against nearly 200 people accused of participating in health care fraud schemes\u00a0with false claims topping $2.7 billion. More than 190 defendants, including 76 doctors, nurse practitioners and other licensed medical professionals, were charged over two weeks in federal courts across the country, according to the Justice Department, and the government has seized more than $231 million in cash, luxury vehicles, gold and other assets. \u201cIt does not matter if you are a trafficker in a drug cartel or a corporate executive or medical professional employed by a health care company, if you profit from the unlawful distribution of controlled substances, you will be held accountable,\u201d Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a news conference Thursday. In one of the alleged schemes, the Justice Department alleges two wound care company owners and two nurse practitioners caused unnecessary and\u00a0costly wound grafts to elderly Medicare patients \u2013 many of whom were terminally ill \u2013 as part of an effort to submit fraudulent claims to Medicare, the federal health insurance program for Americans age 65 and over. In a second case, three owners and executives of a wholesale distributor of medications were accused of selling adulterated and misbranded HIV drugs. The drugs were bought through \u201cbuyback\u201d schemes, prosecutors allege, in which the defendants bought previously dispensed prescription drugs from patients and then resold them to pharmacies around the country. Prosecutors say that because of the scheme some patients received mislabeled prescriptions, including one person who passed out and remained unconscious for 24 hours after taking an anti-psychotic drug thinking it was his prescribed HIV medication. Other cases announced by the Justice Department Thursday accused defendants of unlawfully distributing millions of Adderall pills\u00a0that weren\u2019t medically necessary, establishing phony sober living homes that claimed to provide addiction treatment and other support to Native Americans, and illegally prescribing or distributing opioids.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/27/us/health-care-fraud-crackdown/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/29/2024", "section": "us"}}

He struggled to explain what he would accomplish in a second term. He struggled to respond to Mr. Trump\u2019s provocations. He struggled to hold Mr. Trump accountable for his lies, his failures and his chilling plans. More than once, he struggled to make it to the end of a sentence,\u201d the board wrote in an opinion piece published Friday. \u201cThe greatest public service Mr. Biden can now perform is to announce that he will not continue to run for re-election. As it stands, the president is engaged in a reckless gamble. There are Democratic leaders better equipped to present clear, compelling and energetic alternatives to a second Trump presidency. There is no reason for the party to risk the stability and security of the country by forcing voters to choose between Mr. Trump\u2019s deficiencies and those of Mr. Biden. It\u2019s too big a bet to simply hope Americans will overlook or discount Mr. Biden\u2019s age and infirmity that they see with their own eyes,\u201d the Times also said. The board went on to say it would still support Biden as its \u201cunequivocal pick\u201d if the choice remains between him and former President Donald Trump. The Biden campaign hit back at the editorial board\u2019s critique on Friday evening. \u201cThe last time Joe Biden lost the New York Times editorial board\u2019s endorsement, it turned out pretty well for him,\u201d Biden campaign co-chair Cedric Richmond told CNN. The Times\u00a0endorsed\u00a0two Democratic presidential candidates in 2020: Sens. Amy Klobuchar and Elizabeth Warren. The New York Times is the latest to critique Biden\u2019s\u00a0debate\u00a0performance, which has set off alarm bells among top Democrats \u2014 leaving some to openly question whether Biden can stay atop of the Democratic ticket. \u201cHe seemed a little disoriented. He did get stronger as the debate went on. But by that time, I think the panic had set in,\u201d longtime Democratic operative and CNN senior political commentator David Axelrod said. Axelrod also gave voice to a conversation happening among many Democrats on Thursday night: \u201cThere are going to be discussions about whether he should continue.\u201d On MSNBC, the cable news channel\u00a0that\u2019s seen as the\u00a0home to the country\u2019s progressive political wing, anchor Alex Wagner said Thursday immediately following the debate that there had \u201cbeen a uniformly negative reaction to Biden\u2019s performance tonight.\u201d \u201cThis was about revealing who Donald Trump was, but it was also Joe Biden battling a caricature of himself as an enfeebled person,\u201d Wagner said of the debate. \u201cAnd he did nothing to disabuse, I think, the country of the notion that he is very old and was lost frequently in that debate.\u201d - CNN\u2019s Betsy Klein, Kasie Hunt, MJ Lee, Lauren Fox, Kayla Tausche, Arlette Saenz and Hadas Gold contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/28/media/nyt-editorial-board-biden-2024-presidential-race/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/29/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_28_us_dolphins-stranded-cape-cod-massachusetts", "text": "More than 100 dolphins were stranded off Cape Cod, Massachusetts, on Friday, in what the International Fund for Animal Welfare described as possibly \u201cthe largest single mass stranding event\u201d in the organization\u2019s 25-year history. The dolphins were found Friday in Wellfleet in an area called the \u201cGut\u201d or Great Island at the Herring River, which Stacey Hedman, the fund\u2019s communications director, described as a \u201cvery difficult location with dangerous mud.\u201d The town of Wellfleet is a little over 100 miles southeast of Boston. The non-profit, which rescues, rehabilitates and releases animals, described the Herring River Gut as \u201cthe epicenter of our mass strandings\u201d in a Facebook post. \u201cWe had 125 Atlantic white-sided dolphins strand and 10 died before we arrived,\u201d Hedman said in an email to CNN on Friday. \u201cThe plan, given the number, is to triage and aim to support animals, refloat and herd as many as possible,\u201d Hedman said. \u201cLuckily, it is cooler today, but these animals will risk sunburn and overheating until the tide rises, and then we have the challenge of herding them into deeper water.\u201d The rescue operation, in which at least 25 fund workers and 100 volunteers assisted, was ongoing by early Friday evening an hour after high tide, according to Hedman. The Whale and Dolphin Conservation, the Center for Coastal Studies, AmeriCorps of Cape Cod and the New England Aquarium are also supporting the operation. \u201cWe estimate 115 live dolphins, and we\u2019re continuing to encourage them further out of the shallow mud flats,\u201d Hedman told CNN Friday evening. \u201cThe tide in this area can be 10-11 feet, and can make a dramatic difference in just a few hours.\u201d During the earlier low tide shortly before 11:30 a.m., the marine mammal rescue team, while on foot, attempted to herd the dolphins out of the estuary and into the deeper waters offshore, according to the fund. The high tide just before 5 p.m. worked in rescuers\u2019 favor as they used the rising tide to refloat the animals, Hedman said. There are three small vessels in the water \u201cto continue herding and using underwater pingers (noise) to urge the dolphins in the right direction,\u201d according to Hedman. She noted there is no set explanation for why dolphins strand. \u201cCape Cod is a global stranding hotspot due to the curvature of our shores and the fluctuation of our tides,\u201d Hedman said. More dolphins get stranded along Cape Cod\u2019s 12-mile stretch of shoreline than any other place globally, according to the fund. CNN\u2019s Ashley R.

{"id": "2024_06_26_us_texas-death-row-ramiro-gonzales", "text": "Texas executed\u00a0Ramiro Gonzales\u00a0by lethal injection on Wednesday for a 2001 murder, the state Department of Criminal Justice said, following unsuccessful appeals to the US Supreme Court that argued, in part, he should have been ineligible for the death penalty under state law because he was no longer dangerous. Gonzales, 41, was convicted and sentenced to death in 2006 for the sexual assault and killing of 18-year-old Bridget Townsend, court records show. His execution was the first of two \u2013 the other in Oklahoma \u2013 carried out this week in the United States. Gonzales was pronounced dead at 6:50 p.m., the state criminal justice department said. The department provided Gonzales\u2019 last statement before he was executed, in which he repeatedly apologized to the Townsend family and said he \u201cnever stopped praying\u201d for their forgiveness: \u201cI can\u2019t put into words the pain I have caused y\u2019all, the hurt what I took away that I cannot give back.\u201d \u201cI hope this apology is enough. I lived the rest of this life for you guys to the best of my ability for restitution, restoration, taking responsibility,\u201d Gonzales said. \u201cI never stopped praying that you would forgive me and that one day I would have this opportunity to apologize.\u201d During the penalty phase of Gonzales\u2019 trial, jurors were required to find, as they are in all capital cases in Texas, a \u201cprobability\u201d Gonzales would continue to \u201ccommit criminal acts of violence.\u201d Without this determination, capital defendants in the Lone Star State are not eligible for the death penalty, per state law. In their appeals to the Supreme Court, Gonzales\u2019 attorneys said his track record these last 18 years shows he was not dangerous, pointing to his commitment to his Christian faith, ministry to others behind bars and his unsuccessful attempts to donate a kidney to a stranger in need. Additionally, they said the evidence relied upon to make the finding of future dangerousness was false: An expert witness who diagnosed the inmate with antisocial personality disorder relied on recidivism data later found to be incorrect, and he later evaluated Gonzales and walked back his testimony. In a pair of brief orders Wednesday, the US Supreme Court gave no comment in its denial of Gonzales\u2019 requests. There were no noted dissents. \u201cWe have finally witnessed justice being served,\u201d Townsend\u2019s brother, David, said Wednesday after witnessing Gonzales\u2019 execution, according to the Associated Press. \u201cThis day marks the end of a long and painful journey for our family. For over two decades we have endured unimaginable pain and heartache.\u201d Gonzales\u2019 death \u201cprovides us a little bit of peace,\u201d he said. \u201cI do want to say we are not joyous. We are not happy. This is a very, very sad day for everyone all the way around.\u201d Gonzales had grieved for Townsend and her family, as well as another woman he kidnapped and raped before confessing to Townsend\u2019s killing, his attorneys said Wednesday night in a statement. \u201cRamiro knew he took something from this world he could never give back. He lived with that shame every day, and it shaped the person he worked so hard to become,\u201d said the attorneys, Thea Posel and Raoul Schonemann. \u201cIf this country\u2019s legal system was intended to encourage rehabilitation, he would be an exemplar.\u201d In his final statement before execution, Gonzales also thanked his family and friends, along with two officials with the Texas Department of Criminal Justice for \u201cthe opportunity to become responsible, to learn accountability and to make good.\u201d The state of Texas had also opposed Gonzales\u2019 appeals, arguing in part his team had misconstrued the eligibility requirement and contending the question of whether Gonzales would continue to be a threat was not limited to the inmate\u2019s behavior on death row. Even taking into account his behavior post-conviction, \u201cthere\u2019s undoubtedly sufficient evidence to uphold the finding of future dangerousness,\u201d attorneys for the state wrote, pointing to the subsequent kidnapping and rape of another woman and a litany of transgressions he committed while in jail. \u201cEven if a jury could somehow consider events that had not happened yet, i.e., Gonzales\u2019s behavior on death row, the jury could still have rationally believed Gonzales would be a danger in the future,\u201d they said. On Monday, the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles declined to recommend clemency in a 7-0 vote. Without that recommendation, Republican Gov. Greg Abbott only could have given Gonzales a one-time 30-day reprieve. In a statement, the Medina County Criminal District Attorney\u2019s Office, which prosecuted the case, said the death penalty is never \u201ctaken lightly\u201d in Texas. \u201cNothing about an execution is easy. Nothing about losing a loved one to murder is easy,\u201d District Attorney Mark Haby said. \u201cHowever, it seems to be a fitting end that the defendant was executed on the birthday of the person he killed, Bridget Townsend. May both their souls find peace.\u201d CNN has reached out to members of Townsend\u2019s family for comment. 18 months passed before key confession Gonzales murdered Townsend in January 2001, after he called the home of his drug supplier, her boyfriend, in search of drugs, according to a 2009 Texas appeals court opinion affirming the inmate\u2019s conviction and death sentence. When Townsend told Gonzales her boyfriend wasn\u2019t home, he went to the house in search of drugs. He stole money, then kidnapped Townsend, tying her hands and feet before driving her to a location near his family\u2019s ranch, the opinion states. There, he raped and fatally shot her, it says. The case went unsolved for 18 months. Then, while sitting in jail after pleading guilty to the rape of another woman, Gonzales confessed to Townsend\u2019s killing and led authorities to her body. Gonzales\u2019 execution was the nation\u2019s eighth this year, according to data from the Death Penalty Information Center, a non-profit organization that tracks capital punishment in the US and has in the past been critical of the way it\u2019s administered. It was followed by the ninth Thursday in Oklahoma, which executed Richard Rojem for the 1984 kidnapping, rape and murder of his 7-year-old stepdaughter, Layla Cummings. Rojem was pronounced dead at 10:16 a.m., the director of the state Department of Corrections confirmed in a statement. The state\u2019s parole board voted last week against recommending clemency for Rojem, who had claimed he was innocent, according to CNN affiliate KOCO. Rojem, like Gonzales, was the second person executed in his respective state so far in 2024, according to the center\u2019s data. By this time last year, 13 inmates had been put to death in the US, the data shows.

{"id": "2024_06_27_politics_presidential-debate-trump-biden", "text": "The confrontation in Atlanta between Joe Biden and Donald Trump Thursday night has a good chance of becoming the most fateful presidential debate in US history. For the first time, a sitting president and an ex-president will lock horns before millions of viewers, in an encounter taking place far earlier than normal \u2014 even before the party conventions. The CNN-hosted showdown is the most pivotal moment yet in a neck-and-neck election, and it\u2019s Biden\u2019s best chance to shake up a reelection bid that he is in deep danger of losing as he struggles to convince voters that he\u2019s delivered the political and economic normality he promised in 2020. The debate comes at a moment when many Americans are seeking relief from high prices that have made it harder to feed their families and afford rents, mortgages, and new cars. It is unfolding amid an intense national debate over access to abortion that was unleashed by the conservative Supreme Court majority built by Trump. Deep divides over immigration and foreign policy in a world filled with new challenges to US power will form a contentious backdrop to a clash between two candidates who openly disdain one another. The debate in that sense personifies an election race that has left millions of Americans unsatisfied with the choice offered by two elderly candidates who alienate more voters than they attract. But the momentous circumstances of the occasion can only be fully understood alongside the context of the unprecedented politics of the times. Since Sen. John F. Kennedy and Vice President Richard Nixon staged\u00a0the first televised debate\u00a0in the 1960 campaign, there have been agonizingly close elections that have set the country on a sharply different course. But the stakes in 2024 are greater than ever because of Trump\u2019s attempt to disrupt the peaceful transfer of power based on false claims of fraud in the 2020 election and his promise to wage a never-before-seen presidency of personal vengeance if he wins in November. Biden plans to frame what he sees as Trump\u2019s threat to the rule of law and democracy in the starkest terms, sources familiar with the matter told CNN\u2019s Kayla Tausche. He will describe the mob attack by Trump\u2019s supporters on the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, as a \u201cseismic,\u201d era-defining moment that must be a watershed for voters. \u201cThe embodiment of the threat is returning,\u201d said one Biden source. That backdrop means this presidential debate has a different cast than all its predecessors. Had Sen. John Kerry beaten President George W. Bush in 2004 or ex-Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney made President Barack Obama a one-term president in 2012, there would have been significant political change. But the character of the republic and its global posture would not have fundamentally altered. That assurance cannot be applied with any confidence to the current election. Trump\u2019s strongman impulse \u2013 epitomized by his claim before the Supreme Court that presidents have almost limitless power, as well as a blueprint for hardline new policies on immigration, the economy and foreign policy \u2013 means a second term could bring massive disruption. \u201c(It is) unbelievably historic. You cannot (over) hype up the importance of this,\u201d presidential historian Douglas Brinkley told CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer on Wednesday. Democrats are desperate for the 81-year-old Biden to put on a show of vitality and sharpness amid concerns about his age. Seventy-eight-year-old Trump\u2019s biggest liability might be himself and the possibility of a performance that could validate Biden\u2019s warnings that he\u2019s too \u201cunhinged\u201d to be president. Biden is expected to hammer Trump over abortion \u2014 one of the few policy areas where he outpolls the former president \u2014 and his admiration of foreign dictators. Trump is already signaling he\u2019ll portray Biden\u2019s America in dystopian terms, beset by uncontrolled immigration, rampant crime and searing economic pain. The most extraordinary aspect of the debate is that it takes place less than a month after Trump was convicted in a criminal hush money case in New York. Biden has already highlighted the guilty verdict in campaign events, but Trump insists that he\u2019s the victim of an attempt to weaponize the legal system to interfere in the election. Both candidates are facing extreme pressure Both men will hope to avoid the kind of debate night gaffes or odd personal quirks that have often gone viral and dominated critical post-debate media coverage that helps cement the perception of who won and who lost in voters\u2019 minds. Vice President Al Gore\u2019s theatrical sighs in 2000 and President George H.W. Bush\u2019s unwise glance at his watch in 1992 both became emblems of losing campaigns. The risks are now much higher because of social media. Presidential debates don\u2019t always decide who wins in November. But the tension surrounding this year\u2019s first debate in June, rather than in September or October as usual, is palpable. \u201cThe closer the election, the greater the chance that a debate could influence it,\u201d said Aaron Kall, director of debate at the University of Michigan, who has conducted an in-depth study of every presidential debate. \u201cA lot of times these mistakes reaffirm a caricature of one of the particular candidates that existed before it happened.\u201d For Biden, that means no senior moments, and Trump would be advised to avoid outbursts that confirm Biden\u2019s characterization of a tyrant in waiting. Neither Trump nor Biden has debated since their final clash in the pandemic-disrupted 2020 campaign. And their preparation for one of the most important nights of their lives has reflected their character and political personas. The president has been out of sight for days, huddled below the oaks, poplars and maple trees at the Camp David retreat with advisers, strategizing how to handle the most challenging debate foe in history. Fueled by lasagna and tacos, he\u2019s taken part in mock debates, immersed himself in briefing binders and tried to anticipate Trump\u2019s wild twists and diversions. It\u2019s a debate camp in keeping with Biden\u2019s view that he\u2019s locked in an existential election duel with the soul of the nation on the line. The former president hates mock debates and has instead honed his preparation at rallies and events, trusting his instincts and intuition and a feral sense of an opponent\u2019s political weakness. He has, however, had policy refresher sessions with aides and some potential vice-presidential picks including Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio. Biden has raised the stakes for himself heading into the debate higher than those any modern president faced. He argues Trump is a criminal in whom something has \u201csnapped\u201d and who is too dangerous and reckless to be let back into the White House. He\u2019s also rebuked Trump for using Nazi-style language and warned democracy and freedom are on the ballot along with the capacity of \u2018We the People\u2019 to shape America\u2019s destiny. Preparing for anything at Camp David Biden\u2019s debate team is led by former White House chief of staff Ron Klain, who has been prepping Democrats for presidential debates for a generation. One of Klain\u2019s mantras is \u201cwhile you can lose a debate any time, you can only win it in the first 30 minutes.\u201d Biden is therefore expected to front-load the most important points to appeal to the likely highest rated part of the primetime event. The Biden team has been poring over Trump\u2019s recent public interviews and speeches while workshopping responses to whatever he and the moderators may throw Biden\u2019s way. The president will be ready for whichever version of Trump shows up \u2013 whether it\u2019s the bombastic opponent who talked over and insulted him in their first clash in 2020, or a more restrained challenger seeking to project stability. If Trump aims for a presidential bearing, Biden has a locker full of practiced attacks and rebuttals designed to provoke him into making the outbursts that could turn voters off. A Biden adviser told CNN that debate preparations have included getting the president ready to respond should Trump get personal\u00a0 \u2014 weeks after his son Hunter was convicted of felony gun charges. Biden\u2019s love and protective instinct for his family is always close to the surface, and he reacted furiously when the then-president brought up Hunter during their first debate in 2020. Biden has been running through his paces inside a large hangar at the Maryland retreat, where there\u2019s a mock debate stage complete with bright television lights. His personal attorney, Bob Bauer, is playing Trump and other aides have sat in as CNN moderators Dana Bash and Jake Tapper. But sources told CNN that the debate practice was about more than feeling comfortable. It\u2019s also about answering the age question. Aides and allies of the president alike have frequently pointed to his State of the Union address in March as a model example of Biden at his best. He was energetic, focused and nimble, they\u2019ve argued, over the course of his 67-minute prime-time speech. Trump\u2019s debate prep is as unorthodox as he is Sitting presidents often have a rude awakening at first presidential debates, since they are unused to anyone getting in their grill and contradicting them. But Trump\u2019s advantage on this score may be compromised since he refused to debate any of his GOP primary rivals this year. Still, his aggressive debate style isn\u2019t much different from the belligerent, spiky attitude he displays in most public events. Trump has warmed up for the debate by suggesting that Biden will be \u201cjacked up\u201d on drugs, as his aides frantically have tried to dismantle the expectations trap that the ex-president constructed for himself by suggesting that Biden is so mentally diminished that he can barely stand up or finish a sentence. In any other era, the idea of a candidate accusing an opponent of doping would be unthinkable. But Trump\u2019s tactic is a reminder of a presidency and a political style that has shattered all previous norms. In a new memo on Wednesday, Trump\u2019s campaign signaled that the ex-president would assail Biden over immigration and the economy. It boasted about polling averages that his team says show the former president up in all the key states. And Trump, whose administration created a gale of daily falsehoods, characteristically worked to accuse Biden of the very transgression that is most associated with him \u2014 lying. \u201cThe man is a walking lying machine and a fact-checker\u2019s dream,\u201d Trump wrote on Truth Social, while accusing Biden, one of the best presidential golfers, of being unable to hit a ball 10 yards. Trump\u2019s unorthodox approach means that the country may get another reminder of the chaos, discord and cacophony that it experienced in his four years in office \u2014 and that his supporters love and want to restore. But it\u2019s also a risk that could play into Biden\u2019s desire to get voters to see the contrast between the 45th and 46th presidents that he believes could deliver him the election. Former Obama speechwriter Terry Szuplat said successful debate performances tell a coherent story of where the country is and where it is going. \u201cIt\u2019s a story about yourself. Why you\u2019re the right candidate. Why the other candidate is the wrong candidate.\u00a0And it\u2019s a story about the future. Every election is about the future. It\u2019s a choice about the future,\u201d Szuplat told CNN\u2019s Kasie Hunt. Neither Trump nor Biden has so far fulfilled that goal. Thursday is the best chance to do so.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/27/politics/presidential-debate-trump-biden/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/29/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_28_media_ratings-debate-trump-biden-cnn", "text": "CNN\u2019s\u00a0Thursday night\u00a0debate between President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump was watched by 51.27 million viewers on television, according to Nielsen data. The 90-minute debate, which\u00a0sent shockwaves\u00a0through the political world, was simulcast across 22 networks. CNN, which hosted the debate from its Atlanta studios, offered a live feed of the telecast to any network free of charge but with strict conditions over its presentation and branding. On television, CNN drew the highest single audience with 9.53 million viewers on its flagship channel, including\u00a03.379 million in the advertiser coveted 25-54 demographic,\u00a0the network said\u00a0Friday. The right-wing talk channel Fox News drew 9.276 million\u00a0viewers, ABC News saw 9.21 million viewers and MSNBC drew 4.122 million viewers. \u201cMore people watched the CNN Presidential Debate than any other CNN program in history,\u201d the network said. The debate was also the most watched non-sports program of the year so far on television. The telecast also drew the largest audience on record for CNN on the\u00a0Max\u00a0streaming service,\u00a0though the network did not disclose audience figures. While the debate drew the largest television audience of the year,\u00a0it represents over a 30% drop in\u00a0audience from 2020,\u00a0when more than 73 million people\u00a0watched the\u00a0first debate\u00a0between Trump and Biden across all television networks. In 2016,\u00a0a record 84 million\u00a0tuned in\u00a0to the first debate matchup between Hillary Clinton and Trump. While fewer Americans watched the debate on television than in previous election years, millions more watched on digital platforms. CNN said the event generated more than 30 million views on its digital properties and on YouTube. The debate was CNN\u2019s biggest event ever on its digital platforms, the network said, and was its most live-streamed event with 2.5 million streams. For CNN,\u00a0Thursday night\u2019s debate was a marketing coup, coming at a pivotal moment for the network as it works to reverse declining ratings and embarks on a strategy to revolutionize the four-decade-old network in the digital era. The previous most-watched program in CNN\u2019s history occurred in 2015, when a GOP debate featuring Trump and a slew of Republican rivals\u00a0averaged 23.1 million viewers. Thursday\u2019s\u00a0primetime matchup\u00a0was a break from\u00a0general election\u00a0debate tradition, which has long been hosted by the\u00a0nonpartisan\u00a0Commission on Presidential Debates and shared with\u00a0television\u00a0networks. While primary debates have traditionally been hosted by\u00a0individual\u00a0networks, the candidates and CNN bucked tradition by completely removing the commission from the equation, holding the debate before the candidates were even officially their party\u2019s nominees. The debate represents a much-needed shot in the arm for CNN, which has seen its ratings fall after changes to its on-air lineup and as traditional television viewers increasingly cut the cord in favor of streaming services. Presidential\u00a0election cycles typically result in a ratings bonanza for news networks as audiences tune in to watch the unfolding\u00a0race \u2014 but\u00a02024 has thus far proven to be the exception, with virtually all news outlets seeing a decline in audience since 2020. While much of the attention in the aftermath of the debate was on Biden\u2019s performance, CNN\u2019s hands-off approach to fact checking during the debate\u00a0elicited some criticism. \u201cI wish the CNN moderators did more fact-checking, letting the audience know when things are said that are flatly false,\u201d wrote New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof. \u201cNot sure how it helps for a platform to transmit falsehoods disguised as facts.\u201d Ahead of the event, CNN political director David Chalian said the network would limit fact checking from the stage, aiming to let the candidates grapple with the issues and \u201cnot become participants in that debate.\u201d Moderators Jake Tapper and Dana Bash took a deliberate approach to questioning, repeatedly following up when the candidates failed to answer questions and policing their allotted speaking time. At one point, Bash pressed Trump three times on whether he\u2019d accept the outcome of the 2024 election. \u201cWe are very proud of Jake and Dana,\u201d a CNN spokesperson said.\u00a0\u201cOur job was to make sure candidates were heard so voters can make informed decisions and we are pleased we were able to do that.\u201d This story has been updated with additional developments and context.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/28/media/ratings-debate-trump-biden-cnn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/29/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_25_us_las-vegas-shootings", "text": "An overnight manhunt for a gunman sought in the deaths of five people in North Las Vegas ended Tuesday morning after police located him just before he killed himself. Eric Adams, 47, was identified by police as a suspect in two shootings on Monday night, according to a news release from the North Las Vegas Police Department. Five people were killed and a 13-year-old girl was hospitalized in critical condition with a gunshot wound after the shooting spree at two apartments. The shooting started when an argument broke out between the suspect and his ex-girlfriend while he was visiting her apartment, police said Thursday in an updated news release. Around 10 p.m. on Monday, police received reports of a shooting at an apartment complex on Casa Norte Drive, the release said. When they arrived, police located two adult females \u2013 one in her early 40s and another in her late 50s \u2013 with gunshot wounds. They were later pronounced dead by medical personnel, according to police. \u201cThe two got into a domestic-related argument, during which Adams armed himself with a gun and shot two other women in the apartment,\u201d the Thursday news release said. Police later located a third victim, a 13-year-old female, who also had a gunshot wound and remains in critical condition at UMC Trauma Center as of Thursday, police told CNN in an email. Three more victims were with gunshot wounds were found at another apartment in the same complex, police said Thursday \u2013 Adams\u2019 ex-girlfriend\u2019s 24-year-old daughter and her 22-year-old friend, along with a 20-year-old man. All three were pronounced dead at the scene, police said. The 20-year-old victim, who was an upstairs neighbor, heard the commotion and decided to check on the women to see if he could help, police said. Adams then shot him when he arrived at the apartment, police said. At that point, the suspect went upstairs and shot three people who were inside that apartment, including a 59-year-old woman, a 40-year-old woman and the teenage girl, police said. Two other people were inside the apartment but were left unharmed. Police then identified Adams as a suspect and the manhunt began overnight. After the shootings, Adams took his ex-girlfriend hostage and fled the area, police said. At some point in the early hours of Tuesday morning, the ex-girlfriend escaped unharmed and found a nearby Las Vegas Metropolitan Police officer to ask for help. Police searched throughout the night for Adams until around 10 a.m. on Tuesday, when they received a tip that he was at a business on East Lake Mead Boulevard. When police arrived at that area, Adams fled to the backyard of a nearby residence. \u201cOfficers began giving Adams verbal commands to drop the firearm, however, Adams ignored those commands and died by suicide,\u201d the release says. Police are continuing their investigation into the incident. \u201cThe surviving victims and their families are being assisted by the North Las Vegas Police Department, victim advocates and detectives, to help them through this difficult time,\u201d police said Thursday.

{"id": "2024_06_28_business_nyc-libraries-funding-restored", "text": "New York City officials have agreed to restore more than $111 million in funding to libraries and cultural institutions, the City Council announced Thursday. The agreement is a victory for residents and organizations who had been pushing back for months against budget cuts in the nation\u2019s largest city and one of the world\u2019s foremost cultural capitals. In November, the city announced it would cut the budget of the New York Public libraries by $58.3 million in fiscal year 2025, and slash the budget for other cultural institutions, including the Bronx Zoo and Carnegie Hall, by $53 million. The new deal reverses those cuts, and is set to be finalized in a City Council vote Sunday. \u201cWe are proud to announce a full restoration of funds to both our libraries and cultural institutions in the upcoming budget,\u201d said New York City Mayor Eric Adams in a statement Thursday. \u201cThese institutions are a critical part of New York City\u2019s social fabric, which New Yorkers depend on for their children\u2019s growth and the vibrancy of our city.\u201d Adams\u2019 office unveiled additional cultural sector cuts of $7.6 million in January, before reversing those cuts in May. \u201cOur arts and cultural institutions and libraries are foundational pillars of our city, and New Yorkers depend on their services every day,\u201d said New York City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams, thanking the mayor\u2019s administration for reaching the deal. \u201cThe Council has consistently championed funding restorations for these institutions as a top priority, and we\u2019re proud to reach an agreement with Mayor Adams and the administration to successfully secure these critical investments for them in the city budget.\u201d The news was received with collective approval from New York institutions that had been forced to cut hours and public access due to lack of funding. \u201cThe Museum of the City of New York is delighted to learn of the restoration of cuts to the cultural sector,\u201d the museum\u2019s president Stephanie Hill Wilchfort told CNN in a statement. \u201cThis support makes it possible for MCNY to be open seven days a week, starting on July 1,\u201d said Wilchfort, who serves as Executive Vice Chair of the Cultural Institutions Group, a coalition of 34 non-profit organizations such as the city\u2019s museums, gardens, and arts centers. \u201cAs such, the Museum\u2019s exhibitions exploring history, popular culture, and art will be open to the public on Tuesdays and Wednesdays for the first time since the pandemic. City support also allows the Museum to operate as a cooling center, open at no charge to anyone who seeks relief from warm weather.\u201d The city\u2019s three public library systems \u2014 New York, Queens, and Brooklyn \u2014 issued a joint statement thanking the administration, the city council and New York residents, who overwhelmingly supported the campaign to restore library budgets. More than 174,000 people sent letters to City Hall in support of the \u201cNo Cuts to Libraries!\u201d campaign since the cuts were announced in November. \u201cThis funding will allow us to resume seven-day service, a priority for many New Yorkers,\u201d the libraries said in a statement shared with CNN. \u201cWe expect that service to begin in the coming weeks, bringing our branches back to the same hours of operation prior to the November 2023 cuts. The funding also allows us to continue universal six-day service, which New Yorkers have enjoyed for nearly a decade.\u201d Not all library locations are open seven days a week, but those who did offer the service were forced to close on Sundays following the budget cuts. A flat budget amid rising costs But the budget restoration may not be enough for the libraries, which operate as publicly owned community spaces and provide residents with social services like English classes, career hubs, tax preparation centers and after school programs. While the proposed 2025 budget doesn\u2019t catastrophically gut the city\u2019s libraries, they are still facing a nominally flat budget that does not account for inflation or rising costs. Last month, the presidents of the three library systems testified before the City Council on increasing costs, including maintaining library infrastructure, providing staff with equitable wages and ensuring that there are enough physical, audio and downloadable books for the city\u2019s roughly 9 million residents. \u201cWe are running a library system today on a pre-pandemic funding level that has not kept pace with inflation,\u201d Linda Johnson, president and CEO of Brooklyn Public Library said at the time. \u201cRestoration alone will not solve our operating budget needs.\u201d Tony Marx, president of the New York Public Library reiterated those sentiments, stating that library operation costs are increasing across the board for wages, health insurance, library materials, maintaining collections and technology. \u201cWe estimate that unreimbursed cost growth next year may be more than $9 million,\u201d he added.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/28/business/nyc-libraries-funding-restored/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/29/2024", "section": "us"}}

So how did we get here? Read, 45, has pleaded not guilty to charges of second-degree murder, vehicular manslaughter while intoxicated, and leaving the scene of a collision resulting in death. The case stems from the death of her boyfriend, Boston Police Officer John O\u2019Keefe, whose body was found bruised and battered in the snow on January 29, 2022, outside the home of a fellow Boston police officer in the suburb of Canton. The trial began in April and has garnered interest as it featured accusations of a police cover-up, sexist and offensive texts from the lead investigator, a federal probe into the investigation, and groups of pink-wearing supporters chanting to \u201cFree Karen Read.\u201d Here\u2019s a review of what we know about the case. The death of John O\u2019Keefe The heart of the trial stems from what happened on one wintry evening in Canton over two years ago. On the night of January 28, 2022, Read and O\u2019Keefe went out drinking at two bars with friends. Shortly after midnight, the couple climbed into Read\u2019s SUV and drove to the home of O\u2019Keefe\u2019s colleague on Fairview Road for an after-party, court documents show. O\u2019Keefe got out of the vehicle, and Read drove home. Early the next morning, she drove around in a snowstorm to look for him and found his body in the front yard of the Canton house, according to court documents. What exactly happened to O\u2019Keefe between getting out of the vehicle and when he was found the next morning? The prosecution has alleged the couple got into an argument that led O\u2019Keefe to get out of the vehicle, but he never made it inside the house. A drunken Read allegedly struck him with the vehicle while driving in reverse and then fled, leaving him to die in the snowy cold, prosecutors say. Firefighters who responded to the scene that morning asked about his injuries, and Read told them, \u201cI hit him, I hit him,\u201d according to their testimony. People at the house that night testified O\u2019Keefe never came inside. In addition, Read\u2019s vehicle had a broken taillight, and pieces of the taillight were found outside the Canton home, prosecutors said. Data from the vehicle\u2019s internal system also indicated she reversed at a rapid speed, according to testimony. \u201cWhat the constellation of the facts and the evidence ineluctably demonstrate here is that the defendant drove her vehicle in reverse at 24.2 miles per hour for 62.5 feet, struck Mr. O\u2019Keefe, causing those catastrophic head injuries, leaving him incapacitated and freezing him to death,\u201d prosecutor Adam Lally said in closing arguments Tuesday. However, Read has said she dropped off O\u2019Keefe at the house and then drove to his home because she wasn\u2019t feeling well, according to court documents. Her defense has accused\u00a0off-duty police inside that Canton home of killing O\u2019Keefe and framing Read. The defense has theorized O\u2019Keefe was beaten in the home and mauled by the homeowners\u2019 German shepherd, Chloe, and then tossed out in the snow to die. The police then conspired to fabricate evidence and lie under oath to protect their own, the defense alleged. \u201cLadies and gentlemen, there was a cover-up in this case, plain and simple,\u201d defense attorney Alan Jackson said. \u201cYou\u2019ll surely say to yourself, \u2018I don\u2019t want to believe it, I don\u2019t want to believe that could happen in our community,\u2019 but sadly over these past eight weeks you\u2019ve seen it right before your eyes.\u201d Lead investigator apologizes for offensive texts The prosecution\u2019s case also has been hampered by a series of missteps and unusual investigative practices. Most notably, a lead investigator in the case, Massachusetts State Police Trooper Michael Proctor, admitted that he sent a series of sexist and offensive texts about Read in a private group chat, calling her a \u201cwhack job,\u201d mocking her medical issues and commenting to coworkers that he had found \u201cno nudes\u201d while searching her phone for evidence,\u00a0CNN affiliate WCVB reported. Proctor apologized on the stand for the \u201cunprofessional\u201d comments, but the vulgar texts have been sharply criticized in and out of court, including from the governor. \u201cIt\u2019s completely unprofessional,\u201d Gov.\u00a0Maura Healey told WCVB of the texts. \u201cIt does harm, frankly, to the dignity and the integrity of the work of men and women across the state police and law enforcement. So as a former attorney general and as governor, I am disgusted by that.\u201d At closing arguments, the prosecution condemned the texts as \u201cunprofessional, indefensible, (and) inexcusable\u201d but said they had no impact on the integrity of the investigation. The defense disagreed. \u201cThey cannot distance themselves from the stench of him on this case and this investigation. Those secret group chats illustrate the quality and care of this investigation,\u201d Jackson said. The US Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of Massachusetts has launched a federal probe into Read\u2019s arrest and prosecution. And in March, the Massachusetts State Police announced an\u00a0investigation into Proctor for potential policy violations. The prosecution has presented evidence that Read and O\u2019Keefe had a volatile relationship. O\u2019Keefe\u2019s niece and nephew said they heard the couple yelling in arguments prior to his death, and an ATF agent testified about his romantic kiss and text messages with Read, according to\u00a0WCVB. Further, in the minutes after prosecutors say she hit him with the SUV, she called his phone and left a voicemail yelling, \u201cJohn, I f**king hate you!\u201d The defense has sharply questioned witnesses about whether Read truly confessed to hitting him with her vehicle and has challenged investigators about the quality of their work. For example, investigators used red plastic cups to collect evidence from the scene, and surveillance video of Read\u2019s vehicle was inexplicably flipped to a mirror image, WCVB reported. \u201cLie, obfuscate, manipulate, alter, and when they\u2019re caught, they just excuse it away,\u201d Jackson said in closing arguments. \u201cThat\u2019s not sloppiness,\u201d he added. \u201cThat\u2019s evidence manipulation.\u201d But prosecutors have rejected those theories as nothing more than speculation. \u201cThere is no conspiracy, there is no cover-up, there is no evidence of any of that beyond speculation, rampant speculation and conjecture on behalf of the defense,\u201d Lally said in closing arguments. The case has divided a small town The accusations of a cover-up and high stakes of the trial have spilled over to local residents and divided the town. Aidan Kearney, a Massachusetts blogger nicknamed Turtleboy, has fed the ongoing debate with numerous posts alleging a cover-up by law enforcement and local politicians. In October, he pleaded not guilty to charges of witness intimidation and conspiracy, CNN affiliate WBZ reported, after he allegedly called and sent messages to witnesses and investigators in Read\u2019s case. Near the courthouse, dozens of people have gathered daily to support Read and offered their approval of her defense\u2019s accusations that she was framed. Wearing pink in solidarity, they have held signs reading \u201cFree Karen Read\u201d and waved American flags. Police have set up a buffer zone to keep them from being too close to the courthouse. Rita Lombardi, a local Read supporter outside the court, told CNN on Thursday she got into the case by following Turtleboy\u2019s work. \u201cThe information in the court filings didn\u2019t add up,\u201d she said. \u201cThis woman was framed, and there is overwhelming evidence, overwhelming scientific evidence that she was framed for murder by the very people we trust to protect us.\u201d \u201cWe are not protesters, we are supporters,\u201d she added. \u201cWe bring love, we bring joy, we bring hope, compassion.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/27/us/karen-read-john-okeefe-what-we-know/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/29/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_26_us_minnesota-house-river-rapidan-dam", "text": "Part of a house perched on the edge of the Blue Earth River in Minnesota collapsed into raging waters as deadly flooding that hit the Midwest threatened the nearby Rapidan Dam, which was built in the early 1900s. \u201cA portion of the house on the property closest to the Rapidan Dam has been undercut enough to have fallen into the river,\u201d Blue Earth County authorities said in a Facebook post Tuesday night. At least two people are dead after days of severe storms and catastrophic flooding in the Upper Midwest inundated homes and forced evacuations. The Rapidan\u00a0Dam,\u00a0near the city of Mankato, was in \u201cimminent failure condition,\u201d the Blue Earth County government said Monday. The dam was still standing Wednesday morning. Assessment and response efforts are underway as the area has seen significant damage and loss of infrastructure and property, authorities said Wednesday. As a result of the partial failure and raging waters, the river has swallowed a home, a power substation and power poles, a steel shipping container, county equipment and more, said Blue Earth County Administrator Robert Meyer. Officials are monitoring activity downstream to ensure that there\u2019s no further damage, Meyer said Wednesday. They\u2019re concerned that erosion could impact the pier supporting the County Road 9 bridge, affecting the structural integrity of the bridge. The county will \u201cexplore mitigation options to ensure that the bridge remains as well as the dam,\u201d Meyer said. \u201cAs we watch the house that was on that cliffside and the erosion of the hillside there, I think it just goes to show how incredibly powerful that water is,\u201d John Cunningham, assistant commissioner for the Department of Public Safety, said Wednesday at a news conference. \u201cIt\u2019s a reminder of how important it is to stay away from any moving water.\u201d The stricken home at the river\u2019s edge is owned by the family of Jenny Barnes, which has also owned the nearby Dam Store for 50 years, CNN affiliate WCCO reported. \u201cIt\u2019s very close to the house. We had to evacuate this morning, get as much as we could out. All the freezers and such,\u201d Barnes told WCCO Monday. \u201cIt\u2019s my childhood. I grew up in the house, I grew up in the Dam Store. I\u2019ve been there all my life.\u201d It was \u201cinevitable\u201d that the family would lose the house to the dangerous flooding, Barnes told CNN affiliate KARE. The family has experienced \u201ctremendous loss and devastation,\u201d said family spokesperson Louise Henderson at a news conference Wednesday. The Dam Store, known for its homemade pies, has been in business since 1910 and owned by Barnes\u2019 family since 1972. \u201cThat\u2019s our life, as well. That\u2019s our business; that\u2019s our livelihood. It\u2019s everything to us,\u201d Barnes told KARE. \u201cThere\u2019s no stopping it. It\u2019s going to go where it wants to go. It\u2019s going to take what it wants to take. And everybody pray that it doesn\u2019t take the Dam Store.\u201d As of Wednesday, there was no flow of water going over the dam as the bulk of the water went around the west side of the dam, Meyer said at a news conference. Minnesota officials urged people to stay away from the water. \u201cHaving been in water rescue my entire life, these are some of the most difficult conditions I have ever seen,\u201d Cunningham said. Water levels peaked at 29.7 feet and have been holding steady for about 24 hours, Mankato City Manager Susan Arntz said Wednesday. Officials expect the river to recede to about 25.5 feet by Friday. \u201cWater is a powerful force,\u201d Minnesota Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan said. \u201cI think climate change is real, and we are experiencing the impacts of it here in Minnesota, all across the state.\u201d Flanagan said policy makers in the region need to focus on building climate resilient communities. Rapidan Dam in a \u2018state of disrepair\u2019 The Rapidan Dam has been in a \u201cstate of disrepair\u201d for years, according to a 2021 study. \u201cWe do not know if it will totally fail or if it will remain in place, however, we determined it was necessary to issue this notification to advise downstream residents and the correct regulatory agencies and other local agencies,\u201d the county said Monday. There were no plans for mass evacuations, authorities said Tuesday. The Blue Earth River has cut around the west side of the\u00a0dam, carrying debris and causing power outages, the county said Monday, noting that there was a \u201cpartial failure on the west abutment.\u201d  The water flow rate at the dam peaked Monday and decreased slightly Tuesday, according to a news release from Blue Earth County emergency management officials. Authorities are continuing to monitor the dam and downstream impacts. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said dozens of homes in the town of Waterville, in Le Sueur County,\u00a0were flooded up to the second floor. The\u00a0Rapidan Dam, which was\u00a0completed in 1910, is owned by the county and is capable of generating 6 million watts of hydroelectric power. It\u2019s about 70 miles southwest of Minneapolis. Dams can break for a number of reasons, including overtopping due to flooding and structural failure, according to\u00a0FEMA. A\u00a02021 report\u00a0from Blue Earth County noted that regular flooding over the years, along with the \u201ctoll of time,\u201d has caused significant damage to the dam. The report identified two solutions: repair or remove the dam. The county noted that both options have significant costs. Deadly flooding in the Midwest While authorities continue to monitor the dam in Minnesota, communities around the Midwest are dealing with the impacts of devastating flooding. A man in his mid-70s died in Clay County, Iowa, while trying to drive across rapid floodwaters on Saturday, according to a spokesperson from the county sheriff\u2019s office. The same day, an 87-year-old man died in a flood-related crash in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, according to the state highway patrol. President Joe Biden approved a disaster declaration for some parts of Iowa, where a levee failure Tuesday morning on the Little Sioux River prompted the evacuation of communities. The city of Rodney was evacuated, and the city of Correctionville was closed to non-residents, according to officials. A flash flood warning was issued for Rodney, the nearby city of Smithland and other rural areas near the river, officials said Tuesday. In South Dakota, water rescue efforts were underway Tuesday afternoon in Sioux City, where the Big Sioux River crested at 45 feet \u2013 7.3 feet above record levels \u2013 prompting homes along the river to be evacuated Monday. South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem said one neighborhood in particular, McCook Lake, was in a \u201cvery dangerous situation. Whole homes have fallen\u201d into McCook Lake, Noem said. The neighborhood has uprooted trees, live power lines across roads and 100-foot drop-offs in places where roads were washed out, the governor said, urging residents to stay away from the area. The intense rainfall that led to the flooding in the Midwest has stopped, though light rainfall is expected to return to some areas Thursday.

{"id": "2024_06_28_politics_joe-biden-debate-performance-fallout", "text": "President Joe Biden\u2019s campaign insisted Friday he will not drop out of the 2024 race, but fractures between those in the president\u2019s orbit insisting on trudging forward and the broader Democratic world seeking a last-minute change were growing after Biden\u2019s disastrous debate performance. Biden acknowledged the weak performance while giving a much more animated speech in North Carolina on Friday, saying, \u201cI know I\u2019m not a young man. I don\u2019t walk as easily as I used to. I don\u2019t talk as smoothly as I used to. I don\u2019t debate as well as I used to, but i know what I do know: I know how to tell the truth. I know right from wrong. And I know how to do this job, I know how to get things done. And I know what millions of Americans know: When you get knocked down, you get back up.\u201d From the West Wing to Wilmington, Biden advisers spent Friday morning calling Democratic members of Congress, donors and other key supporters in hopes of allaying some of the widespread panic about the debate with former President Donald Trump on CNN Thursday night. Biden\u2019s performance \u2014 rife with a raspy voice, an often mouth-agape facial expression and one painful moment in which the president lost his train of thought and suddenly stopped speaking \u2014 laid bare the potential political costs of nominating the oldest-ever president for a second term. Asked whether Biden would exit the race, Biden campaign spokesperson Seth Schuster responded: \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s no basis for that,\u201d one Biden adviser also told CNN Friday morning. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing that voters have indicated that they agree with that.\u201d Despite anxiety from some donors, campaign sources highlighted a record $14 million 24-hour fundraising haul on Thursday, which comes amid signs that Biden\u2019s fundraising edge is slipping. The campaign set its new hourly fundraising record during the 11 p.m. to 12 a.m. hour Thursday following the debate, but a campaign official declined to provide a dollar amount. Biden\u2019s advisers also spent part of the day making calls to ease concerns among some Democratic donors as the campaign prepares for a long-planned fundraising push this weekend. The projections of confidence coming from Biden\u2019s White House and reelection campaign come amid questions even Biden allies are raising over whether anyone with the president\u2019s ear will seek to convince him to suspend his campaign. Democratic congressional leaders are not planning a direct intervention with Biden, according to multiple Democratic sources. Instead, they plan to focus on House and Senate races as they let the debate\u2019s dust settle with the public, and then assess the strength of Biden\u2019s campaign in the weeks ahead. House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries said Friday morning he is standing by Biden \u2014 but he added that he is waiting to hear from Biden at a North Carolina campaign rally later Friday. \u201cI\u2019m going to reserve comment about anything relative to where we are at this moment, other than to say I stand behind the ticket,\u201d Jeffries said. Even as calls for Biden to consider dropping out of the race grew on Friday, Democratic operatives and elected officials alike appeared largely resigned to the reality that him doing so was, at best, a remote possibility \u2014 and most likely a delusional fantasy. One significant reason: the unequivocal support from Biden\u2019s famously impenetrable innermost circle of advisers. One Biden aide argued that while the president is deeply insulated by the tight circle of aides who prepped him at Camp David, the buck ultimately stops with him. \u201cThe people around him aren\u2019t yes-men. All of them know how to tell him no. But once he makes a decision, they are really good at staying united,\u201d the aide said. For instance, there wasn\u2019t agreement on Biden\u2019s decision to seek a second term, \u201cbut once he decides, he decides,\u201d and the wagons are circled. \u201cThe most likely scenario is that nothing f**king changes, right? Because why would it?\u201d said one Democratic operative. The operative pointed the finger at the president\u2019s top advisers for allowing Biden to take the debate stage while knowing what they must have known. \u201cIt\u2019s not like Biden\u2019s inner circle didn\u2019t know this before last night. It\u2019s not like all of a sudden, they\u2019re like, \u2018Oh, wow. He\u2019s showing some signs of age,\u2019\u201d the operative said. One persistent gripe among Biden supporters was why his advisers did not think to preemptively share the fact that the president had been battling a cold, leading to Biden sounding raspy and soft-spoken \u2014 and as a result, at times unintelligible \u2014 on the debate stage. One Democratic congressman said \u201ceveryone\u201d in the party was privately buzzing about whether to try to convince the president to drop out, despite party leaders publicly standing by Biden. But the \u201cquestion is \u2014 who will do something about it?\u201d they said. The New York Times Editorial Board on Friday called for Biden to withdraw from the race, writing, \u201cThe greatest public service Mr. Biden can now perform is to announce that he will not continue to run for re-election.\u201d The board said in part that \u201cthere is no reason for the party to risk the stability and security of the country by forcing voters to choose between Mr. Trump\u2019s deficiencies and those of Mr. Biden.\u201d The board, though, wrote that it would still support Biden as its \u201cunequivocal pick\u201d if he remains in the race and against his predecessor. Biden campaign co-chair Cedric Richmond\u00a0pushed back later Friday, saying, \u201cThe last time Joe Biden lost the New York Times editorial board\u2019s endorsement, it turned out pretty well for him.\u201d Frustration within Biden\u2019s White House, campaign For years at the White House, and for months in Biden\u2019s Wilmington headquarters, anyone but the president\u2019s inner circle has been resigned to the fact that only that insular circle has any real power in the White House. Some aides who traveled to Camp David for debate prep sessions went there knowing they wouldn\u2019t be included in many of the key discussions. It has led to rising stars leaving the administration and strong recruits passing on jobs. But multiple junior and mid-level aides told CNN they were willing to deal with that and the professional frustration that comes with it as long as they could get Biden to deliver. Faith in that group has also been dashed by Biden\u2019s performance, quickly turning into fear that the only people who have the power to change up a campaign aren\u2019t up to it themselves. The frustration with the inner circle was growing on Friday after morning calls were led by more junior staffers on the campaign, giving the impression that those in Biden\u2019s inner circle were either failing to come up with clear talking points or distancing themselves from the president\u2019s performance. A White House official said group text threads were \u201cabysmal\u201d on Friday, with jokes about updating resumes. \u201cEveryone is deflated,\u201d the official said. One source of frustration, the official said, is that neither chief of staff Jeff Zients nor senior adviser Anita Dunn addressed the staff after Biden\u2019s poor debate showing. Zients and Dunn participated in a morning call with the top 40 division managers in the West Wing and Old Executive Office Building, an official said. Their message was one of staying the course \u2013 and they instructed the managers to pass that on to staffers. Many did not. \u201cThe inner circle is used to not having to say anything,\u201d the official said, but \u201cwe cannot pretend like yesterday didn\u2019t happen.\u201d CNN has reached out to the White House for comment about the official\u2019s statement. The Biden campaign will hold an all-staff meeting Friday afternoon, two Biden campaign officials told CNN, part of what they said is a routine pattern of Friday meetings. Many White House staffers were working from home Friday. \u201cWe\u2019re all already commiserating. No reason to do it at a desk,\u201d the official said. \u2018It\u2019s hard to debate a liar\u2019 Biden still plans to participate in a second presidential debate in September, an adviser told CNN. That adviser acknowledged the president\u2019s performance in Atlanta was lackluster but said the campaign is committed to highlighting the moments it believes worked for their candidate \u2014 and then moving on. Many Biden campaign and White House staffers, the adviser said, worked for former President Barack Obama\u2019s reelection campaign, in which Obama turned in a first debate performance that even he described as a \u201cstinker\u201d \u2014 and Obama still won reelection. Obama said Thursday night\u2019s debate didn\u2019t change the fundamentals of the race \u2013 even if it was a rough night. \u201cBad debate nights happen. Trust me, I know,\u201d Obama said in\u00a0a post on X. \u201cBut this election is still a choice between someone who has fought for ordinary folks his entire life and someone who only cares about himself. Between someone who tells the truth; who knows right from wrong and will give it to the American people straight \u2014 and someone who lies through his teeth for his own benefit. Last night didn\u2019t change that, and it\u2019s why so much is at stake in November.\u201d Biden did not plan to dwell on his own performance, one adviser told CNN, but rather will devote more time to pushing back on Trump\u2019s \u201cextreme positions and series of lies\u201d \u2014 work that he struggled to do on stage Thursday night. \u201cThere\u2019s one conversation happening on cable television,\u201d the adviser said, striking a defensive tone when discussing Biden\u2019s shaky debate showing. \u201cThere\u2019s another conversation happening with voters in the country.\u201d A separate adviser said: \u201cVoters are our north star,\u201d pointing to pointing to focus groups and overnight campaign research that found voters in Midwestern battlegrounds responding favorably to some substantive portions of the debate. But from the White House to campaign headquarters, Biden aides on Friday sent signals of defensive frustration \u2014 some directed at their candidate, but most reserved for jittery Democrats and commentators \u2014 over the president\u2019s failure to take command of the stage in his first debate with Trump. A half-dozen aides all dismissed suggestions that Biden was reconsidering seeking a second term. They pointed to a robust travel schedule in the weeks ahead and strong fundraising in the wake of the debate. Still, one adviser conceded: \u201cWe are in a dark place, but we\u2019re moving forward.\u201d Meanwhile, multiple Biden advisers complained that they were frustrated by the falsehoods Trump promoted during the debate, including the former president\u2019s attempt to discredit the Charlottesville White nationalist rally and the January 6, 2021, storming of the Capitol. That dynamic, they say, thrust Biden into a fact-checking role and required him, in their view, to spend much of his time on stage on the defensive \u2014 rather than employing the attack messaging they spent recent days developing. Near the end of the debate, one Biden adviser said he was frustrated \u201cthat Donald Trump is just making stuff up. Almost everything.\u201d And another expressed worry that voters would take Trump\u2019s versions of events at face value, acknowledging that Biden was attempting to correct the record in real-time. But Biden still struggled with his performance in those moments. Biden himself alluded to the challenge following the debate. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to debate a liar,\u201d Biden told patrons at an Atlanta-area Waffle House following the debate. \u201cThe New York Times said he lied 26 times. Big lies.\u201d Pro-Biden political world frets In the broader pro-Biden and anti-Trump political universe, the panic over Biden\u2019s debate performance was much clearer on Friday morning. On Wednesday, Republican Adam Kinzinger \u2014 the former Illinois congressman and Trump critic who did not seek reelection in 2022 after it became clear his role on the House panel that investigated the January 6, 2021, insurrection would cost him his primary race \u2014 made headlines by endorsing Biden. On Friday morning, Kinzinger retweeted a video of MSNBC\u2019s Joe Scarborough \u2014 whose show Axios reported Biden regularly watches \u2014 suggesting Democrats should consider asking Biden to step aside. \u201cI think we have to ask the same questions of him that we have asked of Donald Trump since 2016. And that is, if he were CEO and he turned in a performance like that, would any corporation in America, any Fortune 500 corporation in America, keep him on as CEO?\u201d Scarborough said. Kinzinger also retweeted \u201cThe Daily Show\u2019s\u201d Jon Stewart fuming over the debate. \u201cThis cannot be real life. It just can\u2019t,\u201d Stewart said. \u201cWe\u2019re America. God.\u201d The veterans of Obama\u2019s administration who launched the \u201cPod Save America\u201d series of podcasts popular with liberal listeners also lamented Biden\u2019s performance. \u201cWe have to beat Donald Trump. We have to have a nominee who can do that,\u201d former Obama speechwriter Jon Favreau said on X. \u201cAnd since we haven\u2019t had the convention yet, it would be absurd if Democrats didn\u2019t at least have a serious discussion about whether Joe Biden \u2014 who\u2019s a wonderful human being and has been a great president \u2014 is up for the job.\u201d Ben Rhodes, the former Obama deputy national security adviser, said: \u201cTelling people they didn\u2019t see what they saw is not the way to respond to this.\u201d Hill Democrats split on Biden\u2019s path forward On Capitol Hill, some Democrats expressed alarm about Biden\u2019s struggle to deliver clear answers in the debate. \u201cJoe Biden couldn\u2019t communicate, and Donald Trump lied every time he opened his mouth,\u201d Minnesota Rep. Angie Craig said. Illinois Rep. Brad Schneider said \u201cyeah\u201d when asked if he was keeping the door open to replacing Biden as the Democratic nominee. California Rep. Scott Peters called conversations about replacing Biden \u201cpremature,\u201d but said he is \u201copen to a conversation about how to win this election.\u201d \u201cI think everyone is concerned about last night,\u201d Peters told CNN. \u201cSo the campaign has got to convince a lot of people that this is a campaign we win.\u201d However, senior Democrats rallied to Biden\u2019s defense. Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said that \u201cfrom a performance standpoint, it wasn\u2019t great. \u00a0But from a values standpoint, it far outshined\u201d Trump. \u201cI think that on his worst night his presentation of integrity was \u00a0better than the other guy\u2019s dishonesty. To see the Republicans embrace that dishonesty is just stunning. So, no, I have no problems,\u201d she said. South Carolina Rep. Jim Clyburn, a close Biden ally whose endorsement in 2020 was crucial to the president claiming the Democratic nomination, didn\u2019t defend Biden\u2019s showing Thursday night, saying \u201cit was a poor performance,\u201d but argued that in baseball, batters get three strikes. \u201cThat was strike one,\u201d he said, insisting there is no one better to carry the Democratic message this fall. Retiring Democratic Sen. Ben Cardin of Maryland said he is \u201cvery confident\u201d in Biden\u2019s abilities. \u201cBiden might have had a bad evening, but we don\u2019t want four bad years under Donald Trump. So, on the issues, I thought Joe Biden handled them well. Obviously, we were all looking forward to a more, I guess, energetic approach,\u201d Cardin told reporters in the Capitol. \u2018We\u2019ve got a long way to go until the election\u2019 The more practical problem Democrats face is that even if Biden were to suspend his campaign, the primaries are long over, Biden\u2019s nominal challengers dispatched and the party\u2019s convention in Chicago next month could quickly turn chaotic. Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, the popular Democratic executive of perhaps the most important swing state, conceded on CNN Friday that Biden\u2019s debate performance \u201cwas not a good look.\u201d But Shapiro said the debate \u201cdoesn\u2019t change the fact that there are very stark, competing differences in this race, and I think what the American people have to do right now is make a decision.\u201d \u201cThe Biden campaign should speak for themselves. You know, no question the president was not his best last night, but we\u2019ve got a long way to go until the election,\u201d Shapiro said. Another popular Democratic swing-state governor, Michigan\u2019s Gretchen Whitmer, in a statement Friday morning did not directly mention Biden\u2019s debate performance \u2014 instead seeking to draw a contrast between Biden and Trump on abortion rights, health care policy and more. \u201cJoe Biden is running to serve the American people. Donald Trump is running to serve Donald Trump,\u201d Whitmer said. \u201cThe difference between Joe Biden\u2019s vision for making sure everyone in America has a fair shot and Donald Trump\u2019s dangerous, self-serving plans will only get sharper as we head toward November.\u201d CNN\u2019s Betsy Klein, Haley Talbot, Manu Raju, Veronica Stracqualursi, Andrew Millman, Ted Barrett, Lauren Fox, Annie Grayer, Priscilla Alvarez and Brian Rokus contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/28/politics/joe-biden-debate-performance-fallout/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/29/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_28_politics_texas-gender-affirming-care-ban", "text": "The Texas Supreme Court ruled Friday to allow the state\u2019s ban on nearly all gender-affirming care for minors to remain in effect. In an 8-1 decision, the all-Republican court overturned a lower court\u2019s order that blocked implementation of the law, known as\u00a0Senate Bill 14, while a challenge to its constitutionality was heard. The ruling marks the court\u2019s second opinion in favor of the same law in a year after it allowed the ban to take effect as scheduled in September. The law bars Texas health care providers from providing gender transition surgeries, puberty-blocking medication or hormone therapies to those under 18, although exceptions are provided for intersex patients. The ban was passed by the state\u2019s Republican-controlled legislature in May 2023 after days of protest and procedural delays by Democrats, which led to a provision that allowed those who had started receiving treatment to \u201cwean off.\u201d Under the law, which was signed last June, health care providers who offer such care would have their license revoked. Texas\u2019 ban is similar to restrictions in nationwide as GOP-led states have moved to curb gender-affirming care for minors, expressing concerns over the long-term effects of such treatment \u2014 though major medical associations have deemed it clinically appropriate. More than 20 states have enacted restrictions on gender-affirming care for minors. LGBTQ advocacy groups slammed the ruling Friday, with Lambda Legal \u2014 one of the parties involved in the original lawsuit against the bill \u2014 saying, \u201cIt is impossible to overstate the devastating impact of this ruling.\u201d \u201cInstead of leaving medical decisions concerning minor children where they belong, with their parents and their doctors, the Court here has elected to let politicians \u2014 in blatant disregard for the overwhelming medical consensus \u2014 determine the allowed course of treatment, threatening the health and the very lives of Texas transgender youth,\u201d Karen Loewy, senior counsel for Lambda Legal, said in a statement, vowing to \u201ccontinue to fight\u201d against such measures. Texas GOP Gov. Greg Abbott\u2019s office celebrated the decision, arguing that the ban \u201cprotects children from making permanent, life-altering decisions before they have the mental capacity to do so.\u201d \u201cPassed by a bipartisan majority in the Texas Legislature, this law ensures access to appropriate and medically necessary services,\u201d Abbott\u2019s press secretary Andrew Mahaleris said in a statement shared with CNN. \u201cGovernor Abbott will continue to work with the legislature to do everything possible to protect Texas children and their bright futures.\u201d Gender-affirming care for minors has become a political flashpoint, with Democrats criticizing Republicans for introducing record number of anti-LGBTQ bills and arguing that medical decisions regarding minors should be left to their parents. The Biden administration directly challenged Tennessee\u2019s ban on gender-affirming care for minors, and the US Supreme Court announced this week that it will hear the appeal, which will determine whether states can restrict such care.
