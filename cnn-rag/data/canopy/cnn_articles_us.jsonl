Trump\u2019s lawyers argued in a 55-page filing that the jury\u2019s guilty verdict should be vacated because the district attorney\u2019s office relied on evidence at trial related to Trump\u2019s official acts as president, which Trump\u2019s lawyers asserted should not have been permitted in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s recent immunity decision. \u201cIn order to vindicate the Presidential immunity doctrine, and protect the interests implicated by its underpinnings, the jury\u2019s verdicts must be vacated and the Indictment dismissed,\u201d Trump\u2019s attorneys wrote to Judge Juan Merchan. The Manhattan district attorney \u201cviolated the Presidential immunity doctrine and the Supremacy Clause by relying on evidence relating to President Trump\u2019s official acts in 2017 and 2018 to unfairly prejudice President Trump in this unprecedented and unfounded prosecution relating to purported business records,\u201d Trump\u2019s attorneys wrote. \u201cMuch of the unconstitutional official-acts evidence concerned actions taken pursuant to \u2018core\u2019 Executive power for which \u2018absolute\u2019 immunity applies.\u201d The district attorney\u2019s office declined to comment for this story. Last week, Merchan postponed Trump\u2019s sentencing to allow Trump to file his motion to dismiss the guilty verdict. The district attorney\u2019s office will respond later this month, and Merchan said he will decide the matter in September, with a potential sentencing scheduled on September 18, if necessary. Merchan had initially set Thursday as the day that Trump would be sentenced following his May conviction on 34 counts of falsifying business records, when Trump became the first former US president to be convicted of a felony. But that schedule was scrapped after the Supreme Court ruling on presidential immunity last month, in which the court\u2019s conservative wing found that\u00a0presidents have absolute immunity\u00a0for core official acts. In their filing, Trump\u2019s lawyers pointed to testimony at trial \u2013 including from White House officials Hope Hicks and Madeleine Westerhout\u2013 they argued should not have come before the jury, as well as tweets he sent while president. All of Hicks\u2019s testimony concerning events in 2018, when she was serving as the White House Communications Director, concerned official acts based on core Article II authority for which President Trump is entitled to absolute immunity,\u201d Trump\u2019s attorneys argued. \u201cTrump specifically forbids prosecutors from offering \u2018testimony\u2019 from a President\u2019s \u2018advisers\u2019 for the purpose of \u2018probing the official act.\u2019\u201d The filing says Westerhout was forced to testify about national security matters and her work for Trump, calling prosecutors\u2019 questioning \u201cinvasive.\u201d \u201cThis invasive compelled testimony included information regarding President Trump\u2019s official-capacity \u2018work habits,\u2019 \u2018preferences,\u2019 \u2018relationships and contacts,\u2019 and \u2018social media\u2019 practices at the White House,\u201d Trump\u2019s lawyers argued. Trump\u2019s attorneys pointed to a March 2018 text message that Westerhout sent Hicks while they were White House advisers working on Trump\u2019s behalf: \u201cHey- the president wants to know if you called David pecker again.\u201d In addition, Trump\u2019s lawyers wrote that Trump, while president, used his Twitter account as \u201cone of the White House\u2019s main vehicles for conducting official business.\u201d \u201cMore broadly, permitting prosecutors to use a President\u2019s public statements on matters of public concern in criminal proceedings would chill the President\u2019s willingness and ability to communicate with the public,\u201d they wrote. \u201cThat would result in an impermissible \u2018intrusion on the authority and functions of the Executive Branch\u2019 and the \u2018enfeebling of the Presidency.\u2019\u201d Trump\u2019s attorneys also criticized the district attorney\u2019s office for not waiting for the Supreme Court before taking the case to trial. \u201cAt bottom, the \u2018pressure campaign\u2019 theory turned on DANY\u2019s efforts to assign a criminal motive to actions that President Trump took in 2018 as the Commander in Chief responsible for the entire Executive Branch,\u201d his lawyers wrote. The Manhattan district attorney \u201curged this Court to front-run the Supreme Court on a federal constitutional issue with grave implications for the operation of the federal government and the relationships between state and federal officials. The record is clear: DANY was wrong, very wrong.\u201d Following the Supreme Court ruling, Trump\u2019s lawyers filed a letter earlier this month to the judge asking permission to file the motion to set aside the verdict. Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg\u2019s team responded earlier this month by asserting that Trump\u2019s argument was \u201cwithout merit,\u201d but also that they did not oppose postponing the sentencing while Merchan decided Trump\u2019s motion. The judge announced that same day that he would allow the two sides to file briefs this month and that he would rule on the matter on September 6. Trump\u2019s sentencing would be postponed until September 18, Merchan wrote \u2013 \u201cif such is still necessary.\u201d The district attorney\u2019s reply to Trump is due on July 24.

{"id": "2024_07_10_us_alabama-death-row-inmate-autopsy-lawsuit", "text": "An Alabama death row inmate who is set to be executed by lethal injection next week has asked the state to forgo an autopsy of his body after he is put to death, saying it would violate his religious beliefs as a practicing Muslim, a lawsuit says. Keith Gavin, who is set to be executed next Thursday or Friday, says his body will be subjected to an \u201cinvasive autopsy\u201d that would violate his \u201csincerely held religious beliefs,\u201d as well as Alabama state law, according to the complaint filed by his attorneys last month. Among those named as defendants in the lawsuit are Escambia County District Attorney Steve Billy, Alabama Department of Corrections Commissioner John Hamm and Terry Raybon, warden of the William C. Holman Correctional Facility where Gavin is on death row. \u201cWe are working on a resolution,\u201d the office of Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall told CNN. CNN has reached out to the Alabama Department of Corrections for comment on the lawsuit. The complaint is seeking a judicial order preventing the defendants from performing the autopsy and requiring them \u201cto respect Mr. Gavin\u2019s constitutional rights and sincerely held religious beliefs.\u201d Gavin is a devout Muslim, the complaint says, and his religion \u201cteaches that the human body is a sacred temple, which must be kept whole.\u201d An autopsy, he says, would desecrate his body and \u201cviolate the sanctity of keeping his human body intact\u201d along with his right to the free exercise of his religion. The lawsuit claims Gavin\u2019s attorneys have repeatedly attempted to reach state officials in charge of the autopsy process regarding his request for his \u201cearthly remains to be handled consistent with his faith,\u201d but have received no response. Immediately after Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey signed Gavin\u2019s April 25 letter setting his execution date, the lawsuit says the defendants failed to respond to phone calls, emails and in-person visits or have declined to speak with Gavin\u2019s attorneys. Under Alabama law, a medical examiner is required to investigate any death that takes place in any penal institution in the state, and the law gives discretion to state officials to order a postmortem autopsy if the death is \u201cunlawful, suspicious or unnatural.\u201d \u201cThis law is intended to establish with certainty the cause of death in any such event. After Mr. Gavin\u2019s execution, there will be no question as to who or what caused Mr. Gavin\u2019s death. The State will execute him by lethal injection,\u201d the lawsuit argues. On Thursday, the Council on American-Islamic Relations \u2013 the largest Muslim civil rights and advocacy organization in the country \u2013 called on Alabama officials to accept Gavin\u2019s request. \u201cIn Islamic beliefs, autopsies are generally viewed as impermissible mutilation of the deceased but are permissible in cases of necessity and only to the extent required,\u201d CAIR said in a statement. \u201cThe religious freedom guaranteed to every American in our founding documents does not cease to apply behind bars,\u201d CAIR Research and Advocacy Director Corey Saylor said. \u201cWe urge Alabama state officials to accept Mr. Gavin\u2019s request that his body not be autopsied after execution.\u201d Alabama has faced scrutiny over its executions after multiple failed lethal injections prompted an internal review of the state\u2019s capital punishment system in 2022. Ivey asked the state Department of Corrections to conduct a \u201ctop-to-bottom review of the state\u2019s execution process\u201d after the problems came into the national spotlight, CNN previously reported. The state resumed executions last spring after the review was completed.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/10/us/alabama-death-row-inmate-autopsy-lawsuit/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/12/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_07_11_us_dvontaye-mitchell-death-milwaukee", "text": "Hotel employees have been fired following the death last month of a Black man after he was pinned down by hotel security guards outside a Hyatt Regency in Milwaukee in an incident partially captured by witness video. \ufeff\u201cThe conduct we saw from several associates on June 30 violated our policies and procedures, and does not reflect our values as an organization or the behaviors we expect from our associates,\u201d Aimbridge Hospitality, which operates the downtown hotel, said Thursday in a statement about the death of Dvontaye Mitchell. \u201cFollowing review of their actions, their employment has been terminated,\u201d the statement added. \u201cWe will continue our independent investigation and do everything we can to support law enforcement with their investigation into this tragic incident.\u201d It\u2019s unclear how many \u201chotel associates\u201d were fired and if they include the security guards involved in the Mitchell incident. Those security guards initially were suspended as Aimbridge Hospitality completed its investigation, a Hyatt spokesperson told CNN on Monday. Mitchell, 43, was at the Hyatt Regency on June 30, when police allege he \u201ccaused a disturbance,\u201d prompting security guards to escort him out of the hotel,\u00a0according to a statement\u00a0from civil rights attorney Ben Crump, who represents the Mitchell family. Security guards and others then pinned Mitchell to the ground, part of a video posted on social media shows. Mitchell grunts and pleads with the guards, repeatedly saying \u201cplease\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d it shows. One guard, who appears to be White, can be heard saying, \u201cStay down,\u201d and \u201cStop fighting,\u201d as the others, who appear to be people of color, hold Mitchell down, the video shows. The same guard calls out to witnesses, \u201cThis is what happens when you go into the ladies room.\u201d When police arrived, Mitchell was unresponsive and pronounced dead despite lifesaving measures, Milwaukee Police told CNN on Tuesday without mentioning Mitchell by name. It\u2019s unclear what led up to Mitchell\u2019s encounter with the security guards, how long it took officers to arrive on the scene, and what Mitchell was doing at the hotel. The encounter comes as the\u00a0use of force\u00a0\u2013 particularly\u00a0against people of color\u00a0\u2013\u00a0by police and others in authority roles remains under scrutiny nearly four years after\u00a0protests flared nationwide\u00a0following the murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer. \u201cThe decision to fire the Hyatt security personnel highlights how unjustified Dvontaye\u2019s death truly was,\u201d Crump said Thursday in a statement. \u201cAfter viewing the video from inside the hotel with the DA\u2019s office, it is completely understandable and appropriate that these personnel have been fired for their assault, battery, and excessive force on Dvontaye, which led to his death.\u201d \u2018Your daddy was somebody,\u2019 Sharpton says in eulogy During Mitchell\u2019s funeral Thursday, family members approached the lectern to honor his life while reminiscing on shared memories and what they loved about him \u2013 while continuing to push for justice in his name. \u201cToday, Dvontaye\u2019s family will bury him with a heavy heart, and while his family will never be able to bring him back, today is about honoring and remembering the man he was,\u201d Crump said in a statement prior to the funeral. Mitchell was known for his creativity in the kitchen and was a lover of anything artistic, according to his obituary, which was read during Thursday\u2019s funeral. \u201cDvontaye was an avid family man who filled his time visiting his kids and family, and he lit up every face with joy when he entered the room,\u201d it continued. The Rev. Al Sharpton delivered a eulogy in which he offered to pay for Mitchell\u2019s funeral before pledging $5,000 to each of Mitchell\u2019s children for their education. \u201cI want them (Mitchell\u2019s children) to know I, and people, will tell you later in life about your daddy, but I want you to know your daddy was somebody,\u201d Sharpton said. While Sharpton said the firing of hotel employees was a good move, it\u2019s not enough to bring justice for Mitchell\u2019s loved ones. \u201cI thought after George Floyd and we fought till three cops went to jail, I thought y\u2019all learned you can\u2019t put your knees on our necks,\u201d Sharpton said. A homicide investigation is underway Hyatt has joined Mitchell\u2019s family \u201cin their calls for transparency, accountability and justice for this senseless tragedy,\u201d the hotel chain said Wednesday, adding criminal charges should be filed against the Aimbridge Hospitality employees involved. The local prosecutor is investigating Mitchell\u2019s death as a homicide, he said Wednesday, but Milwaukee Police are not considering the incident as a criminal investigation because there isn\u2019t any evidence of \u201cblunt force,\u201d Crump has said. The Milwaukee County District Attorney\u2019s office is awaiting the full results of Mitchell\u2019s autopsy, which \u201cwill inform the ongoing police investigation into\u201d his death and \u201callow our office to comprehensively evaluate the actions leading up to\u201d his death \u201cfrom the perspective of potential criminal liability,\u201d District Attorney John Chisholm said Wednesday in a statement. Crump\u2019s office obtained an affidavit from an unidentified hotel employee who claimed he reluctantly helped hold down Mitchell after being ordered to do so by a security guard, the attorney said. Crump said he would turn the document over to prosecutors but did not release it publicly.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/11/us/dvontaye-mitchell-death-milwaukee/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/12/2024", "section": "us"}}

The fighting in Concord on April 19, 1775, was immortalized by legendary essayist and poet Ralph Waldo Emerson as \u201cThe Shot Heard Round the World.\u201d National Park Service archaeologists recently found five musket balls fired that day by colonial militia members, according to a news release from the federal agency. \u201cIt\u2019s incredible that we can stand here and hold what amounts to just a few seconds of history that changed the world almost 250 years ago,\u201d Jarrad Fuoss, a ranger at Minute Man National Historical Park and a historic weapons specialist, said in the release. \u201cThese musket balls can be considered collectively as \u2018The Shot Heard Round the World,\u2019 and it is incredible that they have survived this long.\u201d The projectiles were found near the site of the North Bridge where British soldiers faced off against the militia members in the famed three-minute battle in Concord, the park service said. \u201cFurther analysis of the musket balls indicates that each one was fired from the opposite side of the river and not dropped during the process of reloading,\u201d park service officials said. The recently discovered five musket balls will be on display at the park Saturday.

The British continued to move to Concord to search a home for military supplies, leaving a contingent of about 100 soldiers at the North Bridge. As militia members approached, shots were fired by the British troops. Historians say 18 men were killed or wounded in the battle at the bridge.

A new Massachusetts policy goes into effect today, banning overnight stays at Logan International Airport.  Some eligible families on a waiting list will be taken to new shelters, officials said, including a former prison in Norfolk, Massachusetts, that was recently converted into an emergency shelter. The move comes as state officials say they\u2019ve run out of shelter space. \u201cWe\u2019ve never thought that Logan was an appropriate place for people to be staying overnight,\u201d Gov. Maura Healey told CNN affiliate WBZ after announcing the policy. Officials converted a former prison into a shelter. It\u2019s controversial For months, officials in Massachusetts have warned they were overwhelmed by the number of migrants arriving. Healey said last year that the state\u2019s emergency shelter system for families had reached capacity with 7,500 families. At one point last year, the state\u2019s lieutenant governor called on residents to consider housing migrants in their homes due to the lack of shelter space. And recently a delegation from the state traveled to the US Southern border to spread the word \u201cabout how Massachusetts is out of shelter space,\u201d officials said. In May officials announced that the Bay State Correctional Center in Norfolk, which shut down in 2015, was being converted into an emergency shelter that could house 140 families. The controversial announcement sparked protests outside the facility some 25 miles southwest of Boston, WBZ reported. Footage from the CNN affiliate showed protesters waving signs that said, \u201cNo kids in prisons\u201d and \u201cNorfolk Prison-Shelter Not Safe for Anyone!\u201d And at a heated community meeting last month, tensions flared as Norfolk residents expressed concerns about possible impacts on schools, medical services and public safety, according to WBZ. Police and social workers escorted families out Migrants have been sleeping in a corner of the Boston airport\u2019s international arrivals terminal for months. Footage from CNN affiliates showed people lining up sleeping bags, blankets and pillows in rows along the walls of the terminal. At one point, hundreds of migrant families were staying there, CNN affiliate WCVB reported. On June 25, officials said 288 people had slept there overnight. By Tuesday morning, only a few families remained. After sunrise, WBZ reported that state police, social workers and airport staff led those migrants to taxis, which took migrants to welcome centers in Allston and Quincy. \u201cThis is in the best interest of families and travelers and staff at Logan, as the airport is not an appropriate place for people to seek shelter,\u201d state Emergency Assistance Director Scott Rice said in a press release last month. \u201cWe are going to continue to spread the word that Massachusetts is out of shelter space and that, if families are travelling to Massachusetts, they need to be prepared with a plan for housing that does not include Logan Airport or our Emergency Assistance shelters.\u201d CNN\u2019s Braden Walker contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/09/us/boston-logan-airport-migrants-cec/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/12/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_07_11_us_taylor-casey-birthday-missing-bahamas-reaj", "text": "The family of Taylor Casey, a Chicago woman who has been missing in the Bahamas for nearly a month, gathered Thursday to mark her birthday and to plead with authorities to continue searching for her. \u201cThe pain I felt 42 years ago while birthing you doesn\u2019t compare to the pain I feel on today with you missing out of our lives,\u201d Colette Seymore, Casey\u2019s mother, said during a news conference in downtown Chicago livestreamed by CNN affiliate WLS. \u201cThe pain, the hurt (and) the agony is practically killing me.\u201d In June, Casey, then 41, traveled to the Bahamas to attend a retreat at Sivananda Ashram Yoga. She was last seen the evening of June 19 around Paradise Island, a small resort enclave just off the shore of the island of New Providence, the most populous island in the Bahamas, the Royal Bahamas Police Force said. Casey\u2019s friends and family described her as a \u201cfixture of Chicago\u2019s transgender community,\u201d in a news release that was shared Wednesday on a social media account dedicated to her disappearance. \u201cTaylor\u2019s disappearance has sent shockwaves through Chicago\u2019s LGBTQ+ community,\u201d the release read. \u201cTaylor\u2019s family and friends are pleading for elected officials, LGBTQ+ leaders and media to elevate her story and pressure elected officials to leverage the federal resources needed to investigate her disappearance.\u201d During the news conference Thursday, Channyn Lynne Parker, CEO of the Brave Space Alliance \u2013 a \u201cBlack-led, trans-led LGBTQ+ center\u201d in Chicago \u2013 said she believes Casey\u2019s identity as a transgender Black woman is stalling the investigation into her disappearance. \u201c(We have) trans women whose lives are being discarded, who are being thought of as nothing but an afterthought. And again, here we are \u2013 having to apply pressure when it should come as second nature and instinct to do what you know to be right,\u201d Parker said. \u201cWe\u2019re here to say right now, emphatically, resoundingly and loudly that we reject that. Black women matter (and) \u2026 Black trans women matter.\u201d Casey was first reported missing on June 20 when she failed to attend morning yoga classes, CNN previously reported. Family and friends have been critical of the way police and the retreat center have handled the investigation into her disappearance. On Thursday, Seymore noted missing person flyers of Casey were not displayed at the Royal Bahamas Police Force Department or at the retreat center. \u201cHow are you looking for my child?,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople have to see that somebody is missing and they never put up posters or anything.\u201d Authorities said Casey\u2019s cell phone had been found in the water on June 24, but it was unclear how far the location was from the retreat. \u201cWe have conducted extensive investigation into the matter,\u201d Royal Bahamas Police Force Chief Superintendent Chrislyn Skippings said during a news conference at the time of the discovery. \u201cOur priority is to find Taylor and to find Taylor in good health.\u201d Police have utilized drones, search-and-rescue dogs and divers in the investigation, Skippings said. Amid the investigation into Casey\u2019s disappearance, Michael Johnson, the Royal Bahamas Police Force superintendent in charge of the criminal investigation department, was put on \u201cgarden leave,\u201d pending an investigation, according to a July 5 statement from the police force. It is not immediately clear if there is a connection between Johnson\u2019s leave and the case. CNN has reached out to the police force for comment. Emily Williams, a long-time friend of Casey\u2019s, said she traveled to the Bahamas with Casey\u2019s mother to learn more. But upon arriving on the island, Williams said, she knew something was off. \u201cWe weren\u2019t met with caring detectives who wanted to give us an update on where our loved one was. They couldn\u2019t keep details straight, they gave us misinformation and then they tried to push us out,\u201d Williams said during the news conference, adding she and Seymore left early due to feeling \u201cunsafe.\u201d \u201cThey found the phone, but they only found the phone because Taylor\u2019s niece pinged it and gave them the location. They said that they sent out scent dogs, but it came up with nothing. They said that they sent divers and came up with nothing. And what have they done since? We haven\u2019t seen it. They haven\u2019t even reviewed the CCTV footage from the neighboring Atlantis hotel,\u201d Williams continued. Williams and Seymore say they had to \u201cpress\u201d those at the ashram in order to get more information and were not allowed to take pictures or \u201cdisturb\u201d guests. When asked if everyone at the ashram knew of Casey\u2019s disappearance, Williams said the \u201ccolonel overseeing the investigation\u201d told them \u201cmost, but not all\u201d were aware. Jonathan Goldbloom, a representative for the ashram, told CNN Thursday they \u201chave been collaborating fully with the police since we reported that Taylor is missing.\u201d In addition to holding group prayers for Casey, Goldbloom maintained the ashram has provided guests with \u201cregular updates orally and in writing.\u201d Casey\u2019s missing person flyer is posted on their bulletin board, Goldbloom added. \u201cTaylor\u2019s family and friends visit(ed) (sic) the ashram on June 26 for approximately six hours, meeting initially with representatives of the Royal Bahamian police, the US Embassy and the ashram,\u201d Goldbloom wrote to CNN. \u201cDuring Taylor\u2019s friends and family visit, they were asked to not randomly approach guests. The police were clear with their instruction that all guests must consent to speak with them on their own accord.\u00a0We announced their presence to Taylor\u2019s classmates and teachers and invited anyone wanting to meet with them to come forward. Many did, and no one intervened in terms of what individuals are to say.\u201d Casey, who has been practicing yoga for 15 years, went to the yoga retreat \u201cto fulfill a long-term goal of deepening her practice. Eager to return to Chicago, she looked forward to sharing her newfound knowledge and experience with others,\u201d a June 24 release said. A 2023 report on human rights practices in the Bahamas conducted by the US Department of State\u2019s Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor found \u201cLGBTQI+ individuals faced social stigma and discrimination and did not believe they were adequately protected by authorities.\u201d The study also found there was \u201cgenerally low social tolerance for same-sex relationships,\u201d \u201chomophobic epithets were common and socially acceptable,\u201d and a lack of an alternative reporting mechanism of incidents to police and government agents. Williams mentioned in the news conference that the Royal Bahamian Police Force said they will have an update for Casey\u2019s family and friends by Friday. \u201cWe want that update. It\u2019s been three weeks \u2013 we want an update,\u201d she said. Following the news conference a birthday party was held for Casey, that included balloons, snacks and games. \u201cToday is your birthday and we all just want to say happy birthday,\u201d Seymore said to her daughter at the start of Thursday\u2019s news conference. \u201cAlthough, it\u2019s not so happy because you are not here with us.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/11/us/taylor-casey-birthday-missing-bahamas-reaj/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/12/2024", "section": "us"}}

{"id": "2024_07_11_business_uaw-biden-fain", "text": "United Auto Workers President Shawn Fain and other members of the union\u2019s board have expressed concerns about President Joe Biden\u2019s ability to beat Donald Trump in November, a source close to the union says. The union is discussing the way forward on how to beat Trump in November, but the group is not considering rescinding its endorsement of Biden at this time, the source added. The doubts come as Biden is facing growing worries about his ability to beat his predecessor in the presidential election, after a disastrous performance at last month\u2019s CNN presidential debate raised fresh questions about his age and his mental acuity. Reuters was first to report Fain\u2019s concerns. When a reporter at a Thursday press conference raised the UAW\u2019s concerns, the president responded, \u201cThe UAW just endorsed me.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a long way to go this campaign,\u201d the president later added. \u201cI\u2019m just gonna keep moving.\u201d Biden now is working to shore up support within the labor community.\u00a0The president spent about 30 minutes at the AFL-CIO headquarters in Washington, DC, on Wednesday, describing the group of union leaders as his \u201cdomestic NATO.\u201d After Biden\u2019s drop-by, the group met privately for some time, including hearing from campaign officials. Fain, a vocal Trump critic, is a member of the AFL-CIO\u2019s executive council, which on Wednesday announced it \u201cunanimously\u00a0voted\u00a0to reaffirm its commitment to re-electing President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, the leadership of the most pro-union administration in our lifetimes.\u201d The UAW formally endorsed Biden in January after months of White House overtures to the union chief. The endorsement was seen as a major boon for Biden as he looked to court working class voters in swing states like Michigan and Wisconsin. The president is set to visit Michigan on Friday as he pushes forward with his campaign in the face of deep reservations within his party over his ability to win in November. A union spokesperson declined to comment on the Reuters report. A growing list of prominent Democrats, including sitting senators and members of Congress as well as actor and fundraiser George Clooney, have called for Biden to step aside for a new party nominee for November. In a statement Wednesday, the day Biden visited the group, the AFL-CIO executive council said in a statement: \u201cThe labor movement understands, as Joe Biden does, that solidarity is how we win. The message from today\u2019s meeting couldn\u2019t have been clearer: Right now, it\u2019s time to come together around a vision of a country where everyone has a fair shot with a living wage, affordable health care, retirement security, and time to do the things we love like spending time with family and friends and pursuing our interests and passions.\u201d AFL-CIO President Liz Shuler sought to show a united front after the president\u2019s drop-by, posting a photo on X and writing \u201cHe believes in unions \u2013 and we believe in him.\u201d Biden arrived at the AFL-CIO headquarters shortly after actor George Clooney called for the president to step aside in the 2024 race in a New York Times op-ed. While meeting with the new British Prime Minister Keir Starmer in the Oval Office hours later, the president was peppered with questions from reporters about Clooney\u2019s statement, to which he raised his arms and replied \u201cAFL-CIO! Go, go go!\u201d The president has won the backing of most of the country\u2019s largest union groups at a time when Trump has also sought to make inroads with rank-and-file members. \u201cI said I was going to be the most pro union president in American history, well guess what I am,\u201d Biden said Wednesday. \u201cAnd I\u2019m staying there.\u201d CNN\u2019s Chris Isidore contributed reporting.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/11/business/uaw-biden-fain/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/12/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_07_11_media_white-house-press-corps-biden", "text": "For weeks,\u00a0the White House press corps has been boiling \u2013 and not from the Washington, DC, heat. They\u2019re frustrated. Some feel the White House misled the press before President Joe Biden\u2019s stumbling performance at last month\u2019s CNN presidential debate. Others have been exasperated by the White House\u2019s response since then to questions about the president\u2019s health, often leading to follow-ups and clarifications from the administration on otherwise straightforward questions. And nearly all of the White House correspondents who spoke to CNN for this report felt the president should have held a press conference with reporters in the immediate aftermath of the debate. Now, two weeks after Biden\u2019s eye-opening debate performance, journalists from the nation\u2019s biggest news outlets will finally get their chance to question the president directly when Biden takes questions Thursday evening during the NATO summit. Expect fireworks. Since the debate, the journalists tasked with covering the White House have been imploring the president\u2019s communications team \u2013 who said the debate was just a \u201cbad night\u201d \u2013 to prove it, allowing him to take questions directly from the press. \u201cThis is a period of time here where the public is trying to understand what happened,\u201d NBC\u2019s Kelly O\u2019Donnell said on July 2. \u201cAnd the president could help to answer that by engaging with us in an unscripted way right now.\u201d In the weeks since the debate, a media frenzy has erupted around Biden, with the White House and Biden campaign\u00a0coming under intense scrutiny for any sign that aides are attempting to shield the president or potentially cover up any of his missteps that might show a decline. The\u00a0discontent has been on full display in the White House briefing room, where reporters have openly sparred with press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre, particularly over the president\u2019s medical history. Amid pushback from the press, the White House has been forced to revisit answers to some questions. CBS News senior White House correspondent\u00a0Ed O\u2019Keefe laid it all out during a dust-up with Jean-Pierre on Monday. \u201cWell, we\u2019re a little miffed around here about how information has been shared with the press corps,\u201d he\u00a0said.\u00a0\u201cYou answer it incorrectly and then have to come back and clean it up a few days later.\u201d \u201cNo, wait a minute,\u201d Jean-Pierre replied. \u201cCalm \u2014 Ed, please.\u00a0A little respect here, please.\u201d Jean-Pierre said she and the White House communications staff have been doing \u201cour best in this briefing to provide the information that we have.\u201d \u201cI will be the first one to admit: Sometimes I get it wrong. At least I admit that,\u201d she added. But the exchange was symbolic of the growing distrust between the White House communications team and the press corps, which has bristled over\u00a0what they perceive to be\u00a0a lack of transparency and access to Biden, who has conducted fewer press conferences than his recent predecessors. The following day, Jean-Pierre was asked about a neurologist\u2019s visit to the White House earlier this year, which she denied had been related to the president. But later that evening, Jean-Pierre\u00a0issued a statement\u00a0correcting her comments. \u201cThis is the second time in less than a week where the briefing had prompted a need for later clarification on questions about the president\u2019s health,\u201d Associated Press White House reporter Seung Min Kim said in the briefing room Tuesday. It turned out the neurologists\u2019 visits were not all related to the president, after a breathless news cycle that, at times, implied the president was being treated for Parkinson\u2019s (the White House says he is not).\u00a0But while the tense moments in the briefing room may seem to focus on small details and semantics, for the press it\u2019s about credibility. \u201cI think this is a credibility crisis writ large for the White House, and certainly as a spokesperson for the White House, this is a credibility crisis for her,\u201d one White House reporter told CNN, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the situation. \u201cIf they were answering truthfully, with a sense of fidelity to the question in a well-meaning way, you wouldn\u2019t necessarily see (those blow-ups in the briefing room),\u201d the reporter added. The reporter said the press corps has not suddenly decided \u201cto get tough\u201d on the White House in wake of the debate, noting that reporters have been frustrated with how Jean-Pierre has answered from the podium for more than a year and a half. \u201cWe saw the debate. We asked questions. The answers that we got in response to those questions were unsatisfactory,\u201d the reporter said. \u201cAnd so we\u2019re reporters, looking, probing when given unsatisfactory answers.\u201d In a statement to CNN, White House spokesman Andrew Bates defended Jean-Pierre, saying she \u201ctakes hard questions every day, providing thorough answers\u201d and represents President Biden \u201cwith grace and integrity.\u201d \u201cAnd she does that with respect, knowing it\u2019s the obligation of journalists to constantly ask for more information; and that if any White House press corps, in any administration, were ever satisfied they would not be doing their jobs,\u201d Bates said. \u201cWhatever disagreements she may have with reporters, she never gives anonymous quotes criticizing any of them. Instead, she keeps her office door open.\u201d Even before the debate, Biden has held fewer press conferences than his most recent predecessors. Biden has held 36 press conferences thus far in his presidency, fewer than former presidents Donald Trump, Barack Obama and George W. Bush at the same point in their presidencies. While the White House has countered that\u00a0Biden has held\u00a0more\u00a0off-the-cuff interactions with the press than his predecessors while traveling to events and meetings, reporters say those are nowhere near the same as an open format press conference. Bates said Biden has \u201cproudly fought for the rights of journalists in the world and spoken forcefully about the \u2018critical\u2019 role of the press in American democracy \u2013 rather than slander them as \u2018enemies of the people.\u2019 In line with those values, his team reinstated daily press briefings and works hard to be informative and factual, including by releasing more documentation on policy than at any time in American history.\u201d But a former White House staffer under President Bill Clinton told CNN that Biden\u2019s team had deployed an astute strategy to not put the president in front of the media\u00a0as often because they have to \u201cplay to his strengths, which is not a news conference.\u201d \u201cThe media\u2019s game is,\u00a0\u2018let\u2019s do a press conference, because that\u2019s the only way you can demonstrate to us.\u2019 Well, guess what? They don\u2019t need to demonstrate to the media. They need to demonstrate to the country,\u201d the former staffer said. \u201cAnd if I were advising them, I would say, play to his strengths. And if that means fixed events, that means, you know, less formal interviews, whatever it is, that\u2019s what I tell them to do.\u201d But as questions continue to swirl around Biden\u2019s mental fitness, a mounting challenge for the White House and Biden\u2019s campaign is the growing belief that the White House and campaign have not been transparent about his condition. \u201cWe are in the midst of a full-blown feeding frenzy,\u201d former CNN White House correspondent and Washington bureau chief Frank Sesno said. Sesno and former White House correspondents and officials told CNN that questions surrounding Biden\u2019s age and performance, along with how the White House is handling the issue, are legitimate and warrant scrutiny. But they cautioned that the emphasis of the reporting needs to be on how Biden has fundamentally changed over time. \u201cIf a subtext takes hold in the press corps, it\u2019s very, very difficult for a president to break out of that, and Biden is dealing with that today \u2014 that he\u2019s too old,\u201d said Kenneth Walsh, the author of \u201cThe Architects of Toxic Politics in America\u201d and a former White House correspondent for U.S. News & World Report. \u201cThat\u2019s the story that we\u2019re all focused on now, because we see evidence of it, and so it\u2019s a rather easy story to do, and it\u2019s a dramatic story, and it\u2019s valuable to keep people focused on it because we think it\u2019s important to understanding this president.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/11/media/white-house-press-corps-biden/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/12/2024", "section": "us"}}

{"id": "2024_06_08_us_rust-shooting-timeline-alec-baldwin", "text": "The actor Alec Baldwin and several crew members gathered in a church at a New Mexico ranch on October 21, 2021, to rehearse a scene from their upcoming Western film \u201cRust.\u201d Then came the unexpected gunshot. A promising cinematographer was killed, a director was wounded and a film production was left in shambles. Since that day\u2019s fatal shooting of 42-year-old Halyna Hutchins, the film\u2019s armorer and its assistant director have been convicted of criminal charges. And after nearly three years of back-and-forth legal arguments, Baldwin\u2019s trial on the involuntary manslaughter charge began on July 10 with opening statements. The details of what happened that day have been made public in affidavits, probable cause statements, interviews with the main participants and testimony at criminal trials. Here\u2019s a timeline of the on-set shooting and the resulting legal cases. The shooting May 29, 2020: Baldwin, the three-time Emmy winner for his roles on \u201c30 Rock\u201d and \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d was announced as producer and star of the Western feature film \u201cRust,\u201d based on a story by Baldwin and Joel Souza, Deadline reported. In the film, Baldwin plays a grizzled outlaw on the run from authorities with his 13-year-old grandson. October 6, 2021: Filming of \u201cRust\u201d began at Bonanza Creek Ranch, a movie set outside Santa Fe, New Mexico. October 20, 2021: Several crew members walked off set, citing safety concerns. One crew member stated there had been two accidental weapons discharges and a special effects mess-up that set off explosives around the crew between takes. October 21, 2021: Hannah Gutierrez Reed, the armorer for \u201cRust,\u201d loaded a prop six-shot revolver with what she believed were \u201cdummy\u201d rounds, a term for ammo that contains no explosive elements but appear to be real, according to investigators and her defense attorney. Baldwin and several crew members began rehearsing a scene in a rustic church on set before breaking for lunch. After the break, Baldwin, Souza, Hutchins and a few others returned to the church for rehearsal. Assistant director Dave Halls fetched a prop gun from a cart outside the church and yelled \u201ccold gun,\u201d indicating it was unloaded. He then handed the gun to Baldwin. Baldwin practiced a \u201ccross draw\u201d \u2013 pulling a gun from a holster on the opposite side of his body from his draw hand. The scene required him to point the gun toward the camera, helmed by Hutchins, Souza and a camera operator. Suddenly, they heard a loud bang. Hutchins stumbled backward, slumped to the floor clutching her stomach and said she couldn\u2019t feel her legs. Souza, who had been standing beside her, noticed blood on his shoulder. At 1:48 p.m., the crew reported the shooting to emergency responders. Hutchins was transported by air helicopter to the hospital and was pronounced dead at 3:37 p.m. Souza was treated at the hospital, and a projectile from a live round was removed from his back. Sheriff\u2019s deputies arrived to the scene and began investigating the series of events leading to the shooting. October 22, 2021: Baldwin released a statement calling the death a \u201ctragic accident\u201d and said he is fully cooperating with the police investigation. December 2, 2021: In an interview with ABC, Baldwin said he cocked the gun and let go of the hammer, and the gun then fired. He said he was aiming the gun just to the side of the camera toward Hutchins, as she instructed him to do. \u201cI would never point a gun at anyone and then pull the trigger, never,\u201d he said. The investigations August 14, 2022: FBI testing of the firearm found it could not be fired without pulling the trigger while the gun was cocked, according to a forensics report. The report noted the gun eventually malfunctioned during FBI testing after internal parts fractured, causing the gun to go off in the cocked position without pulling the trigger. August 20, 2022: In an interview with CNN, Baldwin\u00a0placed responsibility\u00a0for Hutchins\u2019 death on Gutierrez Reed, the film armorer and props assistant, and on assistant director Halls, who handed him the gun. October 5, 2022: The family of Hutchins and Baldwin reached an undisclosed settlement in a wrongful death lawsuit filed against the actor and others. As part of the settlement, Matthew Hutchins, the cinematographer\u2019s widower, was named an executive producer on \u201cRust.\u201d January 19, 2023: Prosecutors announced Baldwin and Gutierrez Reed will be charged with involuntary manslaughter in Hutchins\u2019 death. Halls, the assistant director, agreed to plead no contest to negligent use of a deadly weapon, the district attorney\u2019s office announced. The terms of that deal include six months of probation\u00a0and a suspended sentence, prosecutors said. January 31, 2023: Baldwin and Gutierrez Reed were formally charged with involuntary manslaughter. February 23, 2023: Baldwin pleaded not guilty to manslaughter charges and was released on personal recognizance. April 20, 2023: New Mexico special prosecutors dismissed the charges against Baldwin, citing \u201cnew facts\u201d in the case. \u201cThis decision does not absolve Mr. Baldwin of criminal culpability and charges may be refiled,\u201d they said. August 9, 2023: Gutierrez Reed pleaded not guilty to involuntary manslaughter and tampering with evidence. January 19: Baldwin was indicted by a grand jury on charges of involuntary manslaughter. January 31: Baldwin pleaded not guilty to involuntary manslaughter charges for the second time. The trials February 22: The trial of film armorer Gutierrez Reed began. Prosecutors alleged her failures allowed six live bullets to make their way on set, and she did not make vital safety checks that would have caught the problem. Her defense blamed Baldwin for failing to follow common-sense gun safety rules and on the film\u2019s production team for creating a chaotic and unsafe environment. March 1: Souza, the director and screenwriter, testified about the moment he was shot on set while standing behind Hutchins. March 6: Gutierrez Reed was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter after jurors deliberated for nearly three hours. She was acquitted of a charge of evidence tampering. April 15: At her sentencing hearing, Gutierrez Reed said, \u201cMy heart aches\u201d for Hutchins\u2019 family and friends, and she asked the judge to sentence her to probation. The judge criticized her statement and sentenced her to a maximum of 18 months in prison, saying, \u201cYou alone turned a safe weapon into a lethal weapon.\u201d May 24: A New Mexico judge denied Baldwin\u2019s motion to dismiss the involuntary manslaughter indictment. Baldwin\u2019s attorneys had accused prosecutors of misconduct during the grand jury process. June 3: New Mexico prosecutors asked the court to grant use immunity to Gutierrez Reed and compel her to testify at Baldwin\u2019s trial, according to court documents. Gutierrez Reed invoked her Fifth Amendment right to silence in a pre-trial interview, and prosecutors said if she is not granted immunity then she would not be able to testify in the trial. Gutierrez Reed\u2019s attorney, Jason Bowles, told CNN he will oppose the motion. June 17: Prosecutors signaled their intention to portray Baldwin as repeatedly flouting safety protocols on the movie set in the days before the fatal shooting, according to\u00a0a court filing. June 21: Judge Mary Marlowe Sommer denied a defense motion asking the court to dismiss the involuntary manslaughter indictment. The defense had argued the shooting death was an accident and Baldwin was \u201cnot criminally liable,\u201d but the prosecution countered Baldwin was experienced in the movie business and knew he was handling a real gun. The judge also denied the prosecution\u2019s motion to grant use immunity to Gutierrez Reed to compel her to testify at Baldwin\u2019s trial. June 28: The court denied a motion to dismiss the charges related to the gun that was damaged during forensic testing. Separately, attorneys for Gutierrez Reed in a court filing on June 27 accused prosecutors of withholding evidence that would have favored the defendant during her manslaughter trial and requested she be released from prison,\u00a0Reuters\u00a0reported. According to the filing obtained by Reuters, prosecutors had a report from their own weapons experts that the gun used on set had \u201cunexplained toolmarks on critical surfaces of the trigger and sear.\u201d July 3: Judge Marlowe Sommer denied two motions filed by Baldwin\u2019s legal team alleging prosecutors had improperly handled evidence, paving the way for Baldwin\u2019s trial to start. July 8: The judge ruled Baldwin\u2019s role as a producer on the film \u201cRust\u201d would not be considered at trial. The prosecution had sought to show Baldwin had more responsibility and influence on the set than just as an actor, but the judge said the evidence was prejudicial and confusing to the jury. July 9: Twelve jurors and four alternates were empaneled in Santa Fe for Baldwin\u2019s trial. July 10: The trial of Baldwin on a charge of involuntary manslaughter began with opening statements. Prosecutors alleged Baldwin was reckless with firearms on set and violated the \u201ccardinal rules of firearm safety.\u201d \u201cHe pointed the gun at another human being, cocked the hammer and pulled that trigger, in reckless disregard for Ms. Hutchins\u2019 safety,\u201d prosecutor Erlinda Johnson said. The defense blamed the film\u2019s armorer and the first assistant director for allowing a live round to be loaded into the prop gun. \u201cThis was an unspeakable tragedy, but Alec Baldwin committed no crime. He was an actor, acting, playing the role of Harlan Rust. An actor playing a character can do things that are lethal,\u201d attorney Alex Spiro said. \u201cThese \u2018cardinal rules\u2019 are not cardinal rules on a movie set.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/08/us/rust-shooting-timeline-alec-baldwin/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/12/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_07_09_us_missouri-sandra-hemme-release", "text": "Kansas City, Missouri (AP) \u2014 An appellate court has ordered the release of a Missouri woman whose murder conviction was overturned after she served 43 years in prison, but the state attorney general is still trying to keep her behind bars as the case is reviewed. Monday\u2019s ruling by a panel of appeals court judges comes after a judge\u00a0ruled that Sandra Hemme\u2019s\u00a0attorneys had established \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d of \u201cactual innocence.\u201d Judge Ryan Horsman said on June 14 that she must be freed within 30 days\u00a0unless prosecutors decide to retry her. The appeals court granted Republican Attorney General Andrew Bailey\u2019s request to review Horsman\u2019s decision, but told Horsman meanwhile to establish her bail terms and set her free. The attorney general\u2019s office, which almost always objects to wrongful conviction claims, then asked the appellate court to reconsider, saying the court didn\u2019t give them enough time to argue against her release. Bailey\u2019s office also argued that Hemme was sentenced decades ago to 12 years for violence in prison, and she would start serving that penalty now. Her attorneys responded Tuesday that keeping her incarcerated any longer would be a \u201cdraconian outcome.\u201d Hemme, now 64, has been serving a life sentence at a prison northeast of Kansas City after she was twice convicted of murder in the death of library worker Patricia Jeschke. She\u2019s now the longest-held wrongly incarcerated woman known in the US, according to her legal team at the Innocence Project. After an extensive review,\u00a0Horsman found that Hemme was heavily sedated and in a \u201cmalleable mental state\u201d when investigators repeatedly questioned her in a psychiatric hospital. Police ignored evidence pointing to a discredited fellow officer who died in 2015, and the prosecution wasn\u2019t told about FBI results that could have cleared her, so it was never disclosed before her trials. The prosecutor at her trial agreed, four decades later, that nothing linked her to the crime other than her confession, which followed multiple contradictory statements, the judge noted. Her attorneys described her ultimate confession in a court filing as \u201coften monosyllabic responses to leading questions.\u201d \u201cShe is the victim of a manifest injustice,\u201d Horsman concluded in his 118-page ruling. \u201cThis Court finds that the totality of the evidence supports a finding of actual innocence.\u201d But Bailey then sought a\u00a0delay\u00a0in Hemme\u2019s release to allow an appellate court review, saying she represents a safety risk to herself or others, citing a 1990s attack on a prison worker and statements she made decades ago about enjoying violence, and arguing that the evidence she presented is not \u201cnewly discovered,\u201d so \u201cHemme did not meet the actual innocence standard as a matter of law.\u201d The Buchanan County prosecutor\u2019s office, which tried the case, didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment. Hemme was arrested weeks after the death of Jeschke, a 31-year-old library worker who lived in St. Joseph, Missouri. After Jeschke missed work on November 13, 1980, her worried mother climbed through an apartment window and discovered her daughter\u2019s nude body on the floor, surrounded by blood, with her hands tied behind her back and a telephone cord and a pair of pantyhose wrapped around her throat. A knife was under her head. These and other details were released to the media by the St. Joseph police chief, Robert Hayes, as the crime prompted a massive investigation. Meanwhile, the department took only a cursory look at Michael Holman, a since discredited St. Joseph police officer who was being investigated for insurance fraud and burglaries, and ended that investigation after evidence cast doubt on his alibi. Holman\u2019s plea deal included a promise not to prosecute him for any other \u201ccriminal matters now under investigation.\u201d He died in 2015, according to the judge\u2019s finding of facts. Hemme wasn\u2019t on anyone\u2019s radar until she showed up more than two weeks after the killing at the home of a nurse who once treated her, carrying a knife and refusing to leave. Police took her back to St. Joseph\u2019s Hospital, the latest in a string of hospitalizations that began when she started hearing voices at the age of 12, and she was heavily sedated. It turned out that Hemme had been discharged from the hospital and hitchhiked out of town hours before Jeschke was last seen alive. She showed up that evening at her parents\u2019 home, more than 100 miles (160 kilometers) to the east. Police interviewed the initial driver who provided her alibi, but this wasn\u2019t shared with the jury, the judge found. Investigators began interrogating her as the psychiatric hospital treated her with antipsychotic drugs that triggered involuntary muscle spasms. She complained that her eyes were rolling back in her head. Detectives said Hemme seemed \u201cmentally confused\u201d and not fully able to comprehend their questions, her attorneys argued. Hemme ultimately pleaded guilty to murder to avoid the death penalty, and after her plea was thrown out on appeal, she was convicted again in 1985 after a one-day trial. The prosecutor told Horsman that police never shared exculpatory evidence, including FBI tests that ruled out any connection between Hemme and crime scene evidence. Police also didn\u2019t share key evidence pointing to their fellow officer, even though his pickup truck was seen outside the victim\u2019s apartment, he tried to use her credit card and her earrings were found in his home. When Holman couldn\u2019t be ruled out as the source of a palm print detected on a TV antenna cable found next to the victim\u2019s body, the FBI asked for clearer prints. Police, however, didn\u2019t follow up. An FBI report also found that a hair found on the victim\u2019s bedsheet had \u201cmicroscopic characteristics similar to Holman\u2019s head hair samples and he could not be eliminated as the source.\u201d Jurors never heard these details because the police never shared them with prosecutors, the judge found. \u201cThis Court finds that the evidence shows that Ms. Hemme\u2019s statements to police are so unreliable and that the evidence pointing to Michael Holman as the perpetrator of the crime (is) so objective and probative that no reasonable juror would find Ms. Hemme guilty,\u201d Horsman concluded. The judge also noted how police had showed Hemme crime scene photos and other details that a prosecutor later falsely told jurors only the killer would know. Chief Hayes \u2014 who died in 2010 after serving time for involuntary manslaughter \u2014 also was unusually involved, the judge noted, participating in questioning the victim\u2019s father as he described buying his daughter a pair of gold horseshoe-shaped earrings. That those earrings were found in Holman\u2019s home is another fact the jury never heard.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/09/us/missouri-sandra-hemme-release/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/12/2024", "section": "us"}}

Biden\u2019s health President Joe Biden will face a major test today when he holds an unscripted news conference at the NATO summit in Washington, DC. It comes after his poor debate performance left an indelible impression on many voters who are seriously questioning the president\u2019s mental fitness for another term. Some Democratic donors are also holding back big checks as the party continues to wrestle with the path forward. On Wednesday, actor George Clooney, who had been among Biden\u2019s biggest supporters and donors in Hollywood, took the step of publicly calling for him to bow out of the race. \u201cWe are not going to win in November with this president,\u201d Clooney wrote in a New York Times opinion piece, adding that some lawmakers he has spoken with privately shared this view. Clooney said the country deserves to hear from other politicians who could potentially replace Biden at the top of the ticket. 2. Power outages More than 1.3 million homes and businesses across southeast Texas are still without power after Beryl slammed into the Gulf Coast as a Category 1 hurricane on Monday. Countless families have lost food in their warming fridges while many stores are still closed, leaving local authorities scrambling to distribute food to underserved areas. Heat-related medical emergencies are also spiking in Houston as 90-degree temperatures blanket parts of the state, city fire chief Samuel Pe\u00f1a said. Senior care facilities and residents who rely on electric medical devices are particularly at risk as power outages stretch through at least the end of the week. 3. Gaza The Israeli military has expanded its evacuation order to the whole of Gaza City after sending tens of thousands of Palestinians fleeing from several of the city\u2019s neighborhoods earlier this week. Israel\u2019s latest directive threatens to intensify the plight of already displaced communities after more than 250,000 residents were urged to head to \u201csafe zones\u201d further south since Sunday, a UN office said. Meanwhile, the Biden administration is allowing a shipment of 500-pound bombs to be sent to Israel after it was paused more than two months ago. The initial decision to halt a shipment of both 2,000-pound and 500-pound bombs was due to US concerns about Israel using the heavy munitions \u2014 specifically the larger 2,000-pound bombs \u2014 in their Rafah operation. One shipment of the 2,000-pound bombs remains on hold. 4. \u2018Rust\u2019 movie shooting Opening statements in the involuntary manslaughter trial of actor Alec Baldwin began Wednesday, nearly three years after cinematographer Halyna Hutchins was fatally shot on the New Mexico set of the Western film \u201cRust.\u201d Prosecutors accused Baldwin of violating the \u201ccardinal rules of firearm safety\u201d by pointing a gun at a person and pulling the trigger. The defense team, on the other hand, said the gun was deemed \u201ccold,\u201d meaning it had been checked and was safe. Baldwin has pleaded not guilty and has maintained he did not pull the trigger after the prop gun that discharged was later found to be loaded with a live bullet. If convicted, the actor could face up to 18 months in prison and a $5,000 fine. 5. NASA The two NASA astronauts piloting the historic Starliner mission spoke favorably Wednesday about the vehicle that carried them to the International Space Station \u2014 despite a string of issues that have delayed its return indefinitely. The crew has been in space for more than a month, much longer than the weeklong stay initially expected. NASA and Boeing have said that the fresh wave of issues affecting this flight should not prevent the spacecraft from ultimately bringing astronauts Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore safely home. NASA has not named an expected time frame for their return to Earth but insists the crew is not \u201cstuck\u201d in space.

The shooter, identified as 28-year-old Samson Lucas Bariah Fussner, died after an exchange of gunfire with law enforcement, the US National Park Service said in a news release Tuesday. The injured park ranger was flown to a nearby regional hospital in stable condition and has since been released, according to the agency. The shooting happened at Canyon Village, a cluster of lodges and cabins inside the park, north of Yellowstone Lake and away from the park\u2019s busiest tourist areas. Yellowstone\u2019s 911 dispatch center received a call just after midnight on July 4 reporting that a woman had been held against her will by an armed man in a residence at the village, the park service said. The woman also told law enforcement rangers Fussner \u201cthreatened to kill her and others, including plans to allegedly carry out a mass shooting(s) at July 4th\u00a0events outside the park,\u201d according to the release. Rangers found the suspect\u2019s vehicle unoccupied in the Canyon area and determined he was likely armed and dangerous, the release said. \u201cWith the individual\u202fat large,\u202flaw enforcement rangers were strategically deployed to protect areas with park visitors and employees while searching for Fussner, and the park\u2019s 911 dispatch center notified surrounding jurisdictions,\u201d according to the National Park Service. By the early morning hours that day, more than 20 rangers were searching for Fussner and working to protect people in the park, the agency said. At around 8 a.m., rangers stationed near the Canyon Lodge dining facility located Fussner as he walked toward the service entrance while firing a semi-automatic rifle, according to the release. Roughly 200 people were inside the building as several rangers exchanged gunfire with Fussner, who was shot and died at the scene, authorities said. Fussner \u2013 of Milton, Florida \u2013 was employed by Xanterra Parks and Resorts, a private business authorized to operate in Yellowstone, the release stated. The FBI is leading the investigation into the incident, the park service said, and will be reviewed by the United States Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of Wyoming. The park service is also working with the FBI to offer victim and witness support. The law enforcement rangers who were involved in the shooting have been placed on paid administrative leave while the incident is investigated, in accordance with park service policy, the agency said. Body-worn camera footage of the shooting will also be released within 30 days, it said. \u201cThanks to the heroic actions of our law enforcement rangers, many lives were saved here last Thursday,\u201d said Yellowstone National Park Superintendent Cam Sholly. \u201cThese rangers immediately confronted this shooter and took decisive action to ensure he was no longer a threat to public safety. \u201cWe are working now to provide maximum support to those involved and their families.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/09/us/yellowstone-national-park-gunman-threats/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/12/2024", "section": "us"}}

Pilots of an Allegiant flight bound for Tulsa, Oklahoma, were the first to be heard on\u00a0LiveATC.net\u00a0reporting the wayward wheel as it bounced across runways and taxiways at LAX and radioed in their report to air traffic control. \u201cA tire came off that 75 that took off, we saw it rolling down past bravo seven, bravo eight,\u201d said the crew of Allegiant 2388. Other pilots chimed into air traffic control in real-time, with the crew of another flight saying the tire crossed a parallel runway. Another pilot radioed the wheel\u00a0had finally stopped near the airport\u2019s southwest corner, about three-quarters of a mile from where it was first seen rolling away. There were 174 customers and seven crewmembers on board, the airline said. \u201cThe wheel has been recovered in Los Angeles, and we are investigating what caused this event,\u201d the airline said in a statement. The Federal Aviation Administration is also investigating. The incident comes months after another United Airlines flight lost a wheel while taking off from San Francisco International Airport, damaging several cars in a parking lot. That plane, which was headed for Osaka, Japan, landed safely in Los Angeles, officials said at the time. No injuries were reported. The incident was one of at least a dozen involving United Airlines flights in March, according to a CNN analysis, prompting CEO Scott Kirby to send a\u00a0safety message to customers. At the time, he said the incidents were \u201cunrelated,\u201d but \u201chave our attention and have sharpened our focus.\u201d That same month, the FAA began a safety review of the airline, according to a memo from United. \u201cOver the next several weeks, we will begin to see more of an FAA presence in our operation as they begin to review some of our work processes, manuals and facilities,\u201d United said in a memo to employees obtained by CNN.

Alvin Bragg\u2019s\u00a0office is working with alleged victims whose claims of forcible rape and sexual abuse against the 72-year-old\u00a0disgraced\u00a0former Hollywood producer still fall within the statute of limitations, prosecutor Nicole Blumberg told the court. Blumberg said prosecutors could realistically go to trial in November against Weinstein,\u00a0whose downfall over similar claims became a symbol of the #MeToo movement. Some of the alleged victims had been not willing to participate in the legal process at the time of Weinstein\u2019s first trial, the prosecutor said. \u201cAs we said in 2020, some women were not ready. These women are now ready,\u201d Blumberg said The New York Court of Appeals\u00a0ruled this year\u00a0that the testimony of \u201cprior bad acts\u201d witnesses should not have been allowed in the trial that led to Weinstein\u2019s 2020 conviction of first-degree criminal sexual act and third-degree rape because it \u201cwas unnecessary to establish defendant\u2019s intent and served only to establish defendant\u2019s propensity to commit the crimes charged.\u201d He was sentenced to\u00a023 years in prison\u00a0and has maintained his innocence and denied any nonconsensual sexual activity. Prosecutors in New York had in May indicated their plans to seek a new indictment but said Tuesday they have yet to do so. Weinstein\u2019s lawyers must be notified when that happens because the defense team plans to present a case to the grand jury that might include testimony from Weinstein himself. Defense attorney Arthur Aidala accused the DA\u2019s office of delaying tactics at the hearing, telling state Judge Curtis Farber, \u201cThey have a defendant and they\u2019re out there looking for a crime.\u201d Aidala said Weinstein is \u201cbegging\u201d his attorneys to get this matter done quickly and wants to go to trial in September as initially discussed at the first hearing after Weinstein\u2019s 2020 conviction was vacated by New York\u2019s highest court. He\u00a0has remained behind bars because he was sentenced last year in Los Angeles to\u00a016 years in prison on charges\u00a0of rape and sexual assault \u2013 a trial that similarly used \u201cprior bad acts\u201d witnesses and has also been appealed. The defense attorney said Tuesday that Weinstein is suffering in solitary confinement at Rikers Island after being removed from a hospital setting. According to his lawyer, Weinstein is not getting any treatment for his health issues, including fluid in his heart and his lungs, Spinal Stenosis, macular degeneration in his eyes and diabetes. CNN has reached out to Rikers and the Bureau of Prisons on his claims. Weinstein\u2019s attorneys have consented to Weinstein remaining in custody in New York pending the retrial despite his vacated conviction because he could alternatively be transferred to California to serve a prison sentence for his rape conviction there.

{"id": "2024_07_11_business_cdk-hack-ransom-tweny-five-million-dollars", "text": "CDK Global, a software firm serving car dealerships across the US that was roiled by a cyberattack last month, appears to have paid a $25 million ransom to the hackers, multiple sources familiar with the matter told CNN. The company has declined to discuss the matter. Pinpointing exactly who sends a cryptocurrency payment can be complicated by the relative anonymity that some crypto services offer. But data on the blockchain that underpins cryptocurrency payments also tells its own story. On June 21, about 387 bitcoin \u2014\u00a0then the equivalent of roughly $25 million \u2014\u00a0was sent to a cryptocurrency account controlled by hackers affiliated with a type of ransomware called BlackSuit, Chris Janczewski, head of global investigations at crypto-tracking firm TRM Labs, told CNN. A week after the payment was made, CDK said that it was bringing car dealers back online to its software platform. Cryptocurrency allows for the exchange of digital assets outside of the traditional banking system, but a record of those transactions is accessible on the blockchain. Janczewski did not identify who sent the payment, but three\u00a0other sources closely tracking the incident confirmed that a roughly $25 million payment had been made to BlackSuit affiliates and that CDK was very likely the source of that payment.\u00a0Those sources spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the investigation. The cryptocurrency account that sent the ransom payment is affiliated with a firm that helps victims respond to ransom attacks, one of the sources said, declining to identify the firm. CDK spokesperson Lisa Finney did not respond to multiple requests for comment on Wednesday and Thursday on the apparent payment. Finney  previously declined to answer questions on the subject.\u00a0CDK CEO Brian MacDonald did not respond to email and LinkedIn messages seeking comment. The ransom payment of $25 million hasn\u2019t been previously reported. Bloomberg\u00a0reported that the hackers had made a multimillion-dollar ransom demand and that the company planned to pay. The ransomware attack that hit CDK in mid-June disrupted thousands of auto dealerships that use the company\u2019s software to manage everything from scheduling to sales and orders.\u00a0CDK\u00a0referred to it as a \u201ccyber incident\u201d in statements to reporters. In a note to clients cited by\u00a0CBS, CDK referred to it as a \u201ccyber ransom event.\u201d CDK said last week that \u201csubstantially all\u201d of the nearly 15,000 car dealerships that use its software across North America were back online to its core management system. Federal officials generally discourage paying a ransom to cybercriminals because payments can fuel future attacks. But some companies feel they have no choice but to pay off hackers to try to recover sensitive customer data or get their systems back online. The payment would be a windfall for a\u00a0relatively new brand\u00a0of ransomware criminals that emerged last year and has claimed numerous victims in the education and construction sectors, among others. BlackSuit\u2019s malicious software is similar to that previously used by other Russian-speaking criminal groups,\u00a0according\u00a0to the US Department of Health and Human Services. \u201cThe gang\u2019s leadership has been conducting ransomware extortion operations since 2019 under other ransomware brand names,\u201d said Jon DiMaggio, chief security strategist at cybersecurity firm Analyst1 who closely studies ransomware gangs. \u201cThis is one of many examples I have seen over the years where a group is either shut down by law enforcement or decides to terminate its operation to rebrand under a new name and continue attacking and extorting organizations,\u201d DiMaggio told CNN, adding that most of BlackSuit\u2019s victims have been in the US. Cybercriminals, in general, extorted a record $1.1 billion in ransom payments from victim organizations around the world last year despite US government efforts to cut off their money flows, Chainalysis, another crypto-tracking firm,\u00a0said in a report\u00a0in February. A $25 million ransom payment is certainly large but not unheard of in the lucrative ransomware economy. UnitedHealth Group, the health care conglomerate whose subsidiary suffered a ransomware attack in February that hobbled pharmacies across the US, paid a $22 million ransom to a different criminal group. But the average ransom payment in the fourth quarter of 2023 was significantly lower: $568,705,\u00a0according\u00a0to cybersecurity firm Coveware.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/11/business/cdk-hack-ransom-tweny-five-million-dollars/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/12/2024", "section": "us"}}

Dozens of Dollar General workers and customers have been killed at stores over the past decade, and the company has faced worker protests and millions in fines from regulators for unsafe store conditions. The Labor Department said Dollar General agreed to hire new safety managers, provide safety and health training to workers and develop a safety and health committee. Dollar General will also reduce merchandise levels in stores to prevent blocked fire exits. The agreement also requires Dollar General to correct any safety violations related to blocked exits or access to fire extinguishers and electrical panels within 48 hours. Dollar General could face fines up to $500,000 per violation. \u201cThese changes help give peace of mind to thousands of workers, knowing that they are not risking their safety in their workplaces and that they will come home healthy at the end of each day,\u201d Douglas Parker, the head of the Department of Labor\u2019s Occupational Safety and Health division, said in a statement. This settlement resolves existing contested inspections as well as open federal inspections involving alleged violations. Dollar General did not immediately respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment. Last year, the Labor Department agreed to a settlement with Dollar Tree to improve worker safety in stores. Both chains have a low-cost business model, allowing them to keep their prices down and open in areas competitors like Walmart and Target have bypassed. But this model often means only one or two workers making the minimum wage oversee stores at a time, making it nearly impossible for employees to stock shelves and keep stores well maintained. Dollar General is the fastest-growing retailer in the United States, with more than 19,000 small stores.

{"id": "2024_07_11_politics_takeaways-biden-nato-news-conference", "text": "President Joe Biden on Thursday participated in the most high-stakes news conference of his political career on the sidelines of the NATO summit, aiming to convince his detractors and supporters that he is able to serve another four years in office. Biden spoke for just under an hour, calling on 11 reporters and answering 19 questions. Here are some takeaways from the news conference. Performance serves as a Rorschach test for nervous Democrats Biden\u2019s performance likely won\u2019t change many minds \u2013 Democrats who want Biden to step down are able to jump on a notable verbal gaffe he made at the beginning of the news conference, while Biden\u2019s supporters will point toward the time he spent deftly answering a variety of questions on foreign policy. Toward the beginning of the question-and-answer, Biden mistakenly referred to Vice President Kamala Harris as former President Donald Trump. It was exactly the type of slip-up the White House and Biden\u2019s campaign presumably would have feared amid mounting questions surrounding his mental acuity. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have picked Vice President Trump to be vice president did I think she was not qualified to be president,\u201d he said. The president did not correct himself. He made a similar mistake earlier in the day, accidentally calling Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky \u201cPresident Putin\u201d while introducing him during a NATO event. But Biden quickly moved on, and he spent the rest of the news conference lobbing in-depth answers about questions including Russia, Israel and his economy, offering deep answers on dealing with China and US policy around Ukraine\u2019s fight. Biden brushes off concerns about his campaign: \u2018I\u2019m just gonna keep moving\u2019 Biden frequently brushed aside concerns about his candidacy by telling reporters he\u2019s the most qualified person to run for president. \u201cI think I\u2019m the\u00a0most\u00a0qualified\u00a0person to run for president. I beat him once and I will beat him again,\u201d Biden said, referring to Trump. He continued, \u201cThere\u2019s a long way to go this campaign and so I \u2013 I\u2019m just gonna keep moving.\u201d The length of Biden\u2019s resume has never been in doubt. The president has had more political experience than any one who has ever held or ran for the office. But what\u2019s of concern to those calling for him to step aside is not his qualifications, but his ability to govern for another term. Fifteen House Democrats have called on Biden to step aside - four of them on Thursday alone. But that still only represents less than 10% of the House Democratic caucus. This is a breaking story and will be updated.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/11/politics/takeaways-biden-nato-news-conference/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/12/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_07_11_politics_obama-pelosi-biden-democrats-2024", "text": "Barack Obama and Nancy Pelosi have spoken privately about Joe Biden and the future of his\u00a02024\u00a0campaign. Both\u00a0the former president and ex-speaker expressed concerns about how much harder they think it\u2019s become for the president to beat Donald Trump.\u00a0Neither is quite sure what to do. Democrats are desperate for the dispiriting infighting to end so they can get back to trying to beat\u00a0the former president.\u00a0And they\u2019re begging\u00a0either Obama or Pelosi\u00a0to help them get there, aware that Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer\u00a0doesn\u2019t have\u00a0the trust of Biden\u00a0and\u00a0that House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries doesn\u2019t have the depth of relationship to deliver the message. CNN spoke with\u00a0more than\u00a0a dozen members of Congress, operatives and multiple people in touch with both Obama and Pelosi, many of whom say that the end\u00a0for Biden\u2019s candidacy\u00a0feels clear and at this point it\u2019s just a matter of how it plays out, even after Thursday night\u2019s news conference. And if those two feel otherwise, several leading Democrats say, they need to say that clearly as soon as possible before even more damage is done\u00a0less than four months before the election. Many of Pelosi\u2019s colleagues are hoping that she can bring an end to the turmoil that has engulfed Democrats for the last two weeks.\u00a0And\u00a0to a good chunk of them,\u00a0that end\u00a0can come if and when she tells Biden that he has to drop out. Pelosi has spoken to Biden since the debate, but in the time since, the California Democrat\u00a0has made clear that she does not see Biden\u2019s decision to stay in\u00a0the race\u00a0as final.\u00a0But she, through an aide, declined to comment further. Obama\u2019s\u00a0decision not to make any public comment for two weeks has left a number of leading Democrats feeling like he has left them flailing by holding to the same posture that has largely defined his post-presidency. After the debate, he posted on X,\u00a0\u201cBad debate nights happen. Trust me, I know,\u201d reiterating that sentiment at a fundraiser in New York for House Democrats the night after Biden\u2019s performance. The former president\u00a0hadn\u2019t even planned to make any public statement, but Biden and Obama aides coordinated to get that\u00a0post\u00a0out in a way that reflected Biden campaign talking points that Obama\u2019s first reelection debate in 2012 went badly, too, and it didn\u2019t end up ending his campaign. But Obama\u2019s deepening skepticism about his friend\u2019s ability to\u00a0win reelection is one of the worst kept secrets in Washington. When the history of this extraordinary two-week period of American politics is written, the fingerprints of Obama and Pelosi will be far more apparent than currently known, people familiar with the matter tell CNN, as the Democratic elders have served as a guidepost for a party in panic. \u201cThey are watching and waiting for President Biden to reach a decision on his own,\u201d one longtime Democrat close to all of them told CNN, speaking on condition of anonymity to avoid being seen as disrespectful to Biden. The Biden campaign declined to comment. Obama has been fielding more calls than he\u2019s making, people who have spoken to him say. When he does talk to anxious Democratic donors and officials, he\u2019s been listening more than talking, carefully avoiding taking positions that he assumes would quickly leak. That was also Obama\u2019s approach to the call he had\u00a0with Biden\u00a0after the debate, which the current president has suggested to others included the former president being supportive of\u00a0him\u00a0riding out the turmoil. According to others familiar with the call, though, Obama stuck to his posture of being a \u201csounding board and private counselor.\u201d He prodded. He played devil\u2019s advocate. But he did not take a position. In conversations with some Democrats over the past two weeks,\u00a0Obama has swatted away the notion that he could push Biden one direction or the other even if he wanted to, which underscores their long-running complicated, yet loyal, relationship. And it\u2019s been complicated even further during their time apart: since leaving office behind \u2013 and their weekly lunches at the White House for eight years \u2013 the two have spoken far less than some of their advisers have often intimated. If the former president did try to steer Biden to get out, people who know Obama\u00a0say,\u00a0he is aware the prism through which it could be seen. Biden has written that he felt Obama was not encouraging of his jumping in late to the Democratic primaries in the months after his son Beau died in 2015. Though Obama believes that he was trying to help his then-vice president focus on his grief and not wade into what would have been an incredibly hard\u00a0primary campaign against Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders,\u00a0that may not be how another conversation would go. \u201cBiden would say, \u2018Well, Mr. President, you already used that chip in 2015 and it got us Donald Trump,\u2019\u201d speculated a longtime 2020 campaign aide. \u201cI think it would harden him more.\u201d Obama is also loathe to give Trump, who is forever triggered by him, any new material by getting actively involved. In the past \u2014 including during the 2020 Democratic primaries \u2014 Obama has seen his role as being the unifier who can help validate\u00a0the direction of the party\u00a0to whichever parts of the party remain skeptical. So far, he has not committed to having that role in the turmoil over whether Biden should remain the nominee, what happens if he stays, or what happens if he changes course and decides to go. \u201cWell he\u2019s known as no-drama Obama,\u201d said Rep. Emanuel Cleaver, a Missouri Democrat. \u201cSo if there\u2019s drama, then he\u2019s the one to deal with it.\u201d Obama\u2019s hands-off approach \u2014 at least publicly \u2014 has been seen by some close to him as a way to keep his powder dry in case he needs to have a blunt, difficult conversation with Biden. \u201cHe is going to be all in for the Democratic ticket. No matter who our nominee is, he will be busting his a** helping to make sure that person wins in November,\u201d said one person who speaks with Obama regularly. Obama has been at Biden\u2019s side during two fundraising events this year, including\u00a0at the\u00a0Los Angeles\u00a0event\u00a0last month at which George Clooney would later acknowledge he was alarmed by how Biden carried himself. Biden woke up the day before the\u00a0fundraiser \u2014\u00a0after several days of G-7 meetings\u00a0\u2014\u00a0and had to fly overnight across five time zones to get there, because campaign co-chair Jeffrey Katzenberg was eager to do the Hollywood-themed event, and Clooney told the campaign there was only one day he was available, given his shooting schedule. Even on the way there, Obama questioned the thinking of putting any presidential candidate through the wringer of that kind of scheduling. \u201cHe was the same man we all witnessed at the debate,\u201d Clooney wrote in an essay in The New York Times\u00a0this week,\u00a0imploring Biden to step aside. It was those words that infuriated some Biden loyalists, who suggested that Obama was behind Clooney\u2019s op-ed. The former president, who is friendly with the actor, was aware that it was coming but did not try to stop it.\u00a0To some Obama defenders, that was\u00a0a way of preserving his neutrality, but to some Biden loyalists, it was\u00a0a mark of deep betrayal. Obama was backstage and on stage with Biden for much longer than Clooney was. Others around at the time chalked up the shape the president was in to jet lag. The infamous video\u00a0of Obama\u00a0leading Biden off stage, people familiar say, was more a function of the former president wanting to leave. An Obama aide declined to comment and also declined to say whether his own assessment of Biden\u2019s condition remained that it was about jet lag. Pelosi re-broke the dam As House Democrats left their private caucus meeting on Tuesday morning, many felt the worst might be over for the president. Most of the anti-Biden remarks at the meeting had come from members who had already called for him to go. Then Pelosi went on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe\u201d on Wednesday morning for a long-scheduled appearance and took advantage of being on a show the president is known to watch to cast major doubt on his candidacy. Privately, she was telling colleagues to hold off on embarrassing Biden while the NATO leaders were in town. But even more Democrats took her comments as an open pass to issue their statements calling on Biden to step aside. Pelosi has known Biden for decades. She is older than him by three years. She has been one of his staunchest defenders, including through the 2020 primaries. She\u2019s finished as speaker and has nothing to lose. \u201cI think at this moment, if Biden ends up stepping down as the nominee, she will prove to be the most important Democratic leader,\u201d said one House Democrat. \u201cShe\u2019s the one in a situation like this, especially generationally, who has the credibility to weigh in on something that is so sensitive and important.\u201d Pelosi plans to fly back home to San Francisco on Friday.

{"id": "2024_07_08_us_college-value-cost-americans-skeptical-poll", "text": "Americans are increasingly skeptical about the value and cost of college, with most saying they feel the US higher education system is headed in the \u201cwrong direction,\u201d according to a new poll. Overall, only 36% of adults say they have a \u201cgreat deal\u201d or \u201cquite a lot\u201d of confidence in higher education, according to the report released Monday by Gallup and the Lumina Foundation. That confidence level has declined steadily from 57% in 2015. Some of the same opinions have been reflected in\u00a0declining enrollment\u00a0as colleges contend with the effects of the\u00a0student debt crisis, concerns about the high cost of tuition and\u00a0political debates\u00a0over how they teach about race and other topics. The dimming view of whether college is worth the time and money cuts across all demographics \u2014 including gender, age and political affiliation. Among Republicans, the number of respondents with high confidence in higher education has dropped 36 percentage points over the last decade \u2014 far more than it dropped for Democrats or independents. \u201cIt\u2019s so expensive, and I don\u2019t think colleges are teaching people what they need to get a job,\u201d says Randy Hill, 59, a registered Republican in Connecticut and a driver for a car service. His nephew plans to do a welding apprenticeship after graduating high school. \u201cYou graduate out of college, you\u2019re up to eyeballs in debt, you can\u2019t get a job, then you can\u2019t pay it off. What\u2019s the point?\u201d The June 2024 survey\u2019s overall finding \u2014 that 36% of adults feel strong confidence in higher education \u2014 is unchanged from the year before. But what concerns researchers is shifting opinion on the bottom end, with fewer Americans saying they have \u201csome\u201d confidence and more reporting \u201cvery little\u201d and \u201cnone.\u201d This year\u2019s findings show almost as many people have little or no confidence, 32%, as those with high confidence. Experts say fewer college graduates could worsen labor shortages in fields from health care to information technology. For those who forgo college, it often means lower lifetime earnings \u2014 75% less compared with those who get bachelor\u2019s degrees, according to Georgetown University\u2019s Center on Education and the Workforce. And during an economic downturn, those without degrees are more likely to lose jobs. \u201cIt is sad to see that confidence hasn\u2019t grown at all,\u201d says Courtney Brown, vice president at Lumina, an education nonprofit focused on increasing the numbers of students who seek education beyond high school. \u201cWhat\u2019s shocking to me is that the people who have low or no confidence is actually increasing.\u201d This year\u2019s survey added new, detailed questions in an effort to understand why confidence is shrinking. Almost one-third of respondents say college is \u201ctoo expensive,\u201d while 24% feel students are not being properly educated or taught what they need to succeed. The survey did not specifically touch on the\u00a0protests this year against the war in Gaza\u00a0that divided many college campuses, but political views weighed heavily on the findings. Respondents voiced concerns about indoctrination, political bias and that colleges today are too liberal. Among the respondents who lack confidence, 41% cite political agendas as a reason. Among other findings: More than two-thirds, or 67%, of respondents say college is headed in the \u201cwrong direction,\u201d compared with just 31% who feel it\u2019s going in the right direction. Generally when people express confidence in higher education, they are thinking of four-year institutions, according to Gallup. But the survey found that more people have confidence in two-year institutions. Forty-nine percent of adults say they have \u201ca great deal\u201d or \u201cquite a lot\u201d of confidence in two-year programs, compared with 33% of Americans who feel that way about four-year colleges. California college student Kristen Freeman understands why. \u201cIt\u2019s about saving money. That\u2019s why I went to a two-year. It\u2019s more bang for your buck,\u201d says Freeman, 22, a sociology major at Diablo Valley Community College with plans to transfer to San Jose State University for the final two years of college. Freeman understands the concerns about indoctrination and whether college prepares students for life and work but also feels the only way to change structural problems is from the inside. \u201cI am learning about the world around me and developing useful skills in critical thinking,\u201d Freeman says. \u201cI think higher education can give students the spark to want to change the system.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/08/us/college-value-cost-americans-skeptical-poll/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/12/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_07_11_media_milwaukee-radio-station-biden", "text": "A Milwaukee radio station agreed to make two edits to an\u00a0interview it recorded with President Joe Biden earlier this month at the request of his campaign,\u00a0the station\u2019s owner,\u00a0Civic Media, said Thursday. The July 3 interview\u00a0with\u00a0WAUK-AM\u00a0host Earl Ingram\u00a0was one of Biden\u2019s first media engagements following his poor performance at the\u00a0June 27\u00a0CNN Presidential Debate. The revelations of the requested edits come as the press corps, frustrated by how the White House has handled their questions about Biden\u2019s health and acuity, is about to face Biden for the first time since the debate at a press conference Thursday during the NATO summit. On Thursday, Civic Media, a Wisconsin-based radio network, posted the edited clips and the entire unedited interview on its website. The edited clips, it said, included Biden saying: \u201c\u2026and in addition to that, I have more Blacks in my administration than any other president, all other presidents combined, and in major positions, cabinet positions.\u201d Another clip included the removal of a reference to former President Donald Trump\u2019s call for the death penalty for the so-called Central Park Five. \u201cI don\u2019t know if they even call for their hanging or not, but he\u2013but they said (\u2026) convicted of murder,\u201d Biden said. A Biden campaign spokesperson acknowledged it had asked the station to edit the interview. \u201cHosts have always been free to ask the questions and air the segments they think will best inform their listeners,\u201d the spokesperson said. Civic Media CEO Sage Weil\u00a0said in a statement that\u00a0the station was made aware on Monday that \u201cimmediately after the phone interview was recorded, the Biden campaign called and asked for two edits to the recording before it aired.\u201d \u201cGiven the gravity of the current political moment, the stakes in this election, and the importance of public scrutiny of public officials in the highest office, we believe it is important to share this information,\u201d Weil said. Weil said management determined that \u201cthe production team at the time viewed the edits as non-substantive and broadcast and published the interview with two short segments removed.\u201d He added that \u201cCivic Media disagrees with the team\u2019s judgments in the moment\u201d and that they are clarifying their internal polices \u201cto ensure that everyone in the organization understands the standards we expect for live and pre-recorded interviews.\u201d Despite the edits, Civic Media \u201cunequivocally stands by Earl Ingram and his team,\u201d saying that the edits were made in \u201cgood faith\u201d even if leadership at Civic Media \u201cdisagree with the decision.\u201d Earlier this week, another radio host, Andrea Lawful-Sanders,\u00a0resigned\u00a0from the Philadelphia station WURD after she told CNN that her\u00a0post-debate interview with President Joe Biden\u00a0included questions that were pre-selected by Biden\u2019s campaign team. WURD later said they had parted ways with Lawful-Sanders over the incident.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/11/media/milwaukee-radio-station-biden/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/12/2024", "section": "us"}}
