Ultimately, they charged the former president in Florida, a decision that has proven to be a fateful one \u2014 underscored by the vastly different approaches taken by DC judges as compared to the federal judge now presiding over the criminal case in Florida. Those approaches became apparent in the past week as opinions were unsealed\u00a0from two DC federal judges indicating how much more quickly and harshly for Trump the case might have played out had it remained in Washington. And over the long weekend, the federal judge overseeing Trump\u2019s case now in Florida has been thrust into a new debate about a gag order for the former president \u2014 an issue judges in DC already tackled. In the recently unsealed opinions, DC District Court Chief Judge James \u201cJeb\u201d Boasberg and his predecessor, Judge Beryl Howell, demonstrate a deep skepticism to arguments by Trump and his co-defendants on questions of attorney-client privilege and grand jury secrecy that Judge Aileen Cannon\u00a0has spent months deliberating over in Florida. Though it\u2019s been nearly a year since special counsel Jack Smith indicted Trump for mishandling classified documents, the case remains stalled amid\u00a0Cannon\u2019s reluctance to rule\u00a0on issues before her and appears unlikely to go to trial before the November election. Cannon\u00a0now is being asked\u00a0to respond to a new request from prosecutors to curtail Trump\u2019s ability to comment about law enforcement and witnesses involved in the documents case, because he keeps suggesting misleadingly the FBI was prepared to use deadly force against him during the search of Mar-a-Lago in 2022. A federal judge in DC, Tanya Chutkan, who\u2019s handling a separate criminal case against the former president related to the 2020 election, placed a gag order on Trump months ago preventing him from commenting about witnesses and others in that case in a way that could intimidate them or hurt the proceedings. Cannon hasn\u2019t yet responded to prosecutors imploring her to limit Trump\u2019s speech in a filing Friday night. Investigation moved to Miami in final weeks The bulk of evidence against Trump in the documents case was taken in through a DC federal grand jury that continued to hear testimony months after the FBI seized hundreds of classified documents from Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago residence in August 2022.\u00a0But the Justice Department moved the investigation to a Miami grand jury in its final few weeks before charging Trump in South Florida\u2019s federal court because much of Trump\u2019s allegedly criminal actions took place at Mar-a-Lago, in Palm Beach, Florida. Prosecutors have publicly disclosed little about the choice to move the case to Florida, though it has become a topic of discussion in the fights with the defense teams over secrecy, especially at a recent hearing before Cannon. \u201cI can say that the investigation that was ongoing before the DC grand jury had \u2013 had adequate nexus to continue in Washington. I\u2019m not prepared to comment on the date on which a decision to charge in Florida was made or what the internal deliberations were on that subject,\u201d special counsel\u2019s office prosecutor David Harbach told Cannon at a hearing last week. Trump and his co-defendants\u2019 attorneys have spent months trying to exploit that move, with the hopes that Cannon may think differently from Howell and Boasberg and want to scrutinize the prosecutors\u2019 choices. Cannon is now being asked to re-examine fundamental portions of the case that Howell and Boasberg had already ruled on, including prosecutors\u2019 ability to secure testimony in the DC grand jury from Trump\u2019s former attorney Evan Corcoran. Trump\u2019s team is seeking to cut that testimony out of the prosecutors\u2019 case entirely \u2014 an approach that might have been\u00a0harder for\u00a0the defense if the case had stayed in DC. Last year, Howell ordered Corcoran to testify in front of the grand jury after finding that his conversations with Trump were not protected by attorney-client privilege because they were in furtherance of a crime. Corcoran\u2019s testimony ended up informing key portions of the indictment against Trump and included detailed accounts of Trump\u2019s alleged efforts to keep the classified materials hidden from federal authorities. Bradley Moss, a DC-based lawyer with extensive national security experience, said that the ruling from Howell provided Cannon a \u201cclear road map\u201d to consider the attorney-client privilege issues. But Cannon hasn\u2019t even scheduled a hearing on the topic, which the parties began arguing over in court papers in February. \u201cThat she continues to sit on the matter is inexcusable,\u201d Moss said. Compared\u00a0to the DC judges, Cannon has been more reluctant to rule on issues\u00a0before her, often giving wide latitude for defendants\u2019 claims to be argued over several rounds in court and has entertained attempts to pull the case away from its central issues and into arguments viewed as fringe by a broad spectrum of legal scholars. \u2018Strong evidence\u2019 Trump hid documents Howell, in a pre-indictment ruling that let investigators obtain details of conversations\u00a0Trump\u00a0had with\u00a0his attorney that otherwise would have been protected by privilege, said that there was \u201cstrong evidence\u201d that Trump \u201cintended\u201d to hide the classified documents. Howell\u2019s 84-page opinion last March\u00a0agreed with prosecutors\u2019\u00a0arguments of potentially criminal obstructive behavior by Trump that is now central to the criminal case. Howell analyzed much of the same Trump conduct that girded charges that were filed roughly three months later, and the judge found that prosecutors had put forward \u201csufficient\u201d evidence of a crime to allow for the privilege to be breached. That is a lower bar than what an eventual jury will have to grapple with in the case. But the exercise required Howell to confront some of the very same Trump defenses that his lawyers are now putting before Cannon. For instance, Howell made the point that even if Trump, as a former president, had the authority to keep the classified materials, he was required by a relevant law to \u201csafeguard\u201d the information, and in this case the \u201cclassified documents were stored in unauthorized and unsecured locations,\u201d she said. A similar argument Trump made\u00a0in his trial court\u00a0has tied Cannon up in knots.\u00a0While she ultimately rejected\u00a0a Trump bid to dismiss the case on the grounds he could have kept them post-presidency, she did so after hours of oral arguments, an additional round of written arguments and with a ruling that sidestepped the legal merits of the argument. A \u2018fishing expedition\u2019 The\u00a0newly unsealed ruling from\u00a0Boasberg, meanwhile, rejected a request this month from Trump and his co-defendants that the DC-based judge hand over to Cannon several records of confidential grand jury proceedings. The effort to transfer the records is being spearheaded by Trump\u2019s valet and co-defendant Walt Nauta, who is seeking to bring scrutiny to a 2022 interaction his attorney had with prosecutors after Nauta stopped cooperating against Trump. Boasberg\u2019s ruling included a word of caution \u2014 perhaps an implicit jab at Cannon \u2014 about the possibility that the confidentiality of the grand jury would be hurt if its records were handed over to another court that is not fully steeped in\u00a0that\u00a0grand jury\u2019s\u00a0history. It was an apparent dead end with the DC-based judge. \u201cSuch a court, venturing beyond its expertise, may disclose more material than warranted,\u201d Boasberg wrote. Boasberg, an Obama appointee, cited extensive case law and even prior decisions in DC. He has also sent a \u201crecommendation\u201d to Cannon on how to handle secrecy of\u00a0other grand jury records more relevant to the case,\u00a0which\u00a0Boasberg\u2019s court has provided to the Florida court. Boasberg\u2019s ruling called out\u00a0Nauta\u2019s lawyers\u00a0for trying to game the system with Cannon in Florida in a search for past secret courts records that they think could help him. Boasberg deemed it, bitingly, a \u201cfishing expedition.\u201d \u201cHis request extends to matters he knows nothing about,\u201d Boasberg wrote. \u201cHe imagines that upon transfer to Florida, the court presiding over his criminal case would sift through the records docket by docket and entry by entry, plucking out whatever material it deems relevant to his defense.\u201d Still, Nauta\u2019s attorney continued to argue to Cannon last week that even without the older records from DC, she could reopen the dispute Boasberg previously handled in her court. High-stakes implications Cannon, a Trump appointee confirmed to the bench in late 2020, has far less experience than the DC court handling cases where high-stakes political implications intersect with national security interests. For instance, Boasberg previously served as the chief judge on another powerful judicial bench that works almost solely in the national security space, the\u00a0Foreign\u00a0Intelligence Surveillance Court. The court looks at surveillance warrants related to\u00a0national security intelligence matters, and it handles extensive classified issues from its base\u00a0out of Washington. And Howell, also an Obama appointee, is one of the most seasoned judges in the country on the sort of attorney-client privilege disputes\u00a0that occurred during the Trump grand jury investigations,\u00a0with more public opinions on the topic in politically charged investigations than perhaps any other judge in the country. Cannon, conversely, has presided over only four criminal trials since Trump appointed her to the bench in 2020, in a courthouse\u00a0\u200bso sleepy it didn\u2019t have a secured facility to look at classified records until months after Trump\u2019s case landed on her docket last June. She is taking months to work through classified records issues in the case, and hasn\u2019t even scheduled hearings on a major set of disputes to come over the national security records the defense lawyers may want to use at trial. \u201cSimply greater exposure to this litigation process alone speaks to the speed and detail with which these two DC judges handled these matters in comparison to Judge Cannon,\u201d\u00a0Moss said.

According to the DOJ, in March of 2023, Arthur Grand Technologies Inc., an information technology services firm based in Ashburn, Virginia, posted a job advertisement for a business analyst position. The posting was shared on a public online hiring website and read \u201cOnly US Born Citizens [white] who are local within 60 miles from Dallas, TX [Don\u2019t share with candidates].\u201d The post prompted the DOJ and Labor Department to launched investigations. The Department of Labor\u2019s Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) launched theirs in April 2023, and the DOJ\u2019s Civil Rights Division\u2019s Immigrant and Employee Rights Section (IER) in May of 2023. \u201cArthur Grand Technologies vehemently denies any guilt or wrongdoing in relation to the discriminatory job posting that appeared in March 2023,\u201d said Arthur Grand Technologies CEO Sheik Rahmathullah in an email to CNN. \u201cThis unauthorized posting was made by an upset employee on a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP) from their personal email address and account. Upon discovering this, we took immediate and decisive action to ensure that this type of incident will never happen again, including the immediate termination of the responsible employee.\u201d Thursday, the Justice Department announced separate\u00a0agreements\u00a0with the DOJ and Labor Department. The DOJ\u2019s agreement with the company resolves the agency\u2019s determination that Arthur Grand violated the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) by posting a discriminatory job advertisement. In a DOJ\u00a0press release, Assistant Attorney General of the DOJ\u2019s Civil Rights Division Kristin Clarke said, \u201cIt is shameful that in the 21st\u00a0century, we continue to see employers using \u2018Whites only\u2019 and \u2018only US born\u2019 job postings to lock out otherwise eligible job candidates of color.\u201d \u201cThe Justice Department, working with other government agencies, will continue to hold employers accountable when they violate our nation\u2019s federal civil rights laws,\u201d Clarke added.

{"id": "2024_05_23_us_katrina-twins-graduate-honore", "text": "The milestone unfolding here this week would have seemed unfathomable in the chaos nearly 19 years ago, when the US Army lieutenant general with the booming voice first met the twin babies. The infant boys were starving and dehydrated, nearly limp in the suffocating heat in the days after Hurricane Katrina defeated New Orleans\u2019 levee system, flooded its streets and killed many of the 1,392 people across the region who\u2019d ultimately succumb to its horrors. Their mom, Alexandria Wheeler, had run out of formula to feed them and so decided finally to venture out for help that by then clearly wasn\u2019t coming for her. \u201cIt was like being in a third world country on United States soil,\u201d she recalled to CNN. She walked a long time to get to dry land. Then, she saw him: combat uniform, black beret, aviator glasses. \u201cThis man comes around the corner to our rescue,\u201d Wheeler said of a moment that soon would become an icon of the Crescent City\u2019s freshly ravaged streets. \u201cIt was like God just coming in, stepping in out of nowhere.\u201d Lt. Gen. Russel Honor\u00e9 and his crew quickly scooped up A\u2019Mari and J\u2019Mari Reynolds, each in nothing but a diaper and a tiny navy baseball cap. The encounter didn\u2019t last long, but it would prove momentous: a young family\u2019s first step toward a future that would include another flood but also many bright twists before the latest chapter came into focus hundreds of miles away with the Reynolds twins again poised to meet Honor\u00e9. This time they wore navy mortarboards and matching gowns as they got ready to line up for their graduation from Eagle\u2019s Landing High School near Atlanta. But first, they had to take a video call, one almost two decades in the making. Before they walked across the stage Wednesday to collect their diplomas, they had to deliver a message to a certain Bronze Star recipient \u2013 now 76 and retired \u2013 about how grateful they were to him. They had to tell him how his legacy was now wrapped up in the plans they had for their own futures. Their mom wanted to see his face when they told him. A\u2019Mari and J\u2019Mari stared at the laptop on a picnic table near the commencement venue when his image blinked onto the screen from Louisiana: open collar, dark suspenders, a few more creases around his brown eyes. \u201cWow! Nineteen years ago, boys! Now, look at you two young men,\u201d Honor\u00e9 said before diving right back to the moment they met: \u201cYou were toddlers on Poydras and Convention street when your mom was walking down the street with you, one in each arm. \u201cAnd as we walked up toward her, myself and two soldiers, she started to lower her arms,\u201d he told them. \u201cShe had become exhausted from carrying you.\u201d \u2018Put those weapons down, dammit!\u2019 In those desperate, sweltering, early days of New Orleans\u2019 great flood of 2005, Wheeler \u2013 like so many survivors \u2013 had been far more concerned for her children than herself. \u201cWe hadn\u2019t eaten in maybe six days\u201d when the mother started making her way to the makeshift shelter at the Superdome \u2013 one 6 \u00bd-month-old strapped to her chest, the other on her back. Wheeler waded through murky water that hid horrors, including one she bumped under the surface: \u201cIt was two bodies, collided,\u201d she told CNN a few years later. \u201cTheir arms were stretched out. They were full of water, and they raised up to the top from me lifting my leg up.\u201d When mom and boys finally made it to the stadium, though, supplies were scant. So, a desperate Wheeler headed to Harrah\u2019s casino a couple blocks away. But military personnel with guns drawn stopped them. Terror and confusion hit Wheeler. \u201cWe\u2019re the victims,\u201d she recalled thinking. \u201cWhat are you pulling guns on us for?\u201d That\u2019s when she first heard his voice: \u201cPut those weapons down, dammit!\u201d It was Honor\u00e9, the Louisiana native dispatched to lead the Defense Department\u2019s response to Hurricanes Katrina and soon Rita; CNN cameras captured the moment. \u201cHe was like God\u2019s angel,\u201d Wheeler said. Firearm barrels lowered. Then, Honor\u00e9 saw the mom with her tiny sons: \u201cMe and my team, I knew we had to reach out and help these babies.\u201d \u2018There\u2019s no question. We would have died\u2019 Their rescue, in Honor\u00e9\u2019s view, had been fate: In a city without drinkable water or electricity, a US Coast Guard vessel had docked just two blocks away; a medevac aircraft was available; and a system was in place to spirit the most dire patients to Louisiana\u2019s capital, then on to Texas, for aid. \u201cThis was meant to happen,\u201d he said, hesitating even to imagine an alternative too \u201cunconscionable to think about.\u201d The lieutenant general then spent about four hours with Wheeler and her twins, cradling A\u2019Mari and J\u2019Mari before the family was en route to San Antonio, she said. \u201cThey were completely dehydrated. Their veins \u2013 everything \u2013 it was really hard for them to put in IVs,\u201d Wheeler recalled, adding her sons were in the hospital for a week and a half. \u201cA\u2019Mari actually coded blue, and then J\u2019Mari went directly after him.\u201d Honor\u00e9 is the only reason they made it, Wheeler said. She is sure of it. \u201cWe would have died,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s no question. We would have died.\u201d Meanwhile, Honor\u00e9\u2019s encounter with the Reynolds twins left him \u201cinspired \u2026 to move faster,\u201d he said this week. \u201cWe had to do this quicker, faster, better \u2026 because I knew that there would be other babies out there that were not as lucky as us to have this moment where all things came together.\u201d \u2018You guys grew up in 12 years!\u2019 A\u2019Mari and J\u2019Mari grew up recounting the story of their deliverance, telling and retelling it with their mom and watching and rewatching the video of their tiny selves getting handed to Honor\u00e9 and his team before their flight to safety. But it would take another dozen years \u2013 and another monster storm \u2013 to give the boys and their mother the chance to thank Honor\u00e9 for all he\u2019d done to help them. Hurricane Harvey threatened the family\u2019s Houston apartment in 2017 as it directly killed 68 people in Texas and did more than $150 billion in damage. The storm\u2019s aftermath also drew a certain lieutenant general, by then retired but still vocal about how best to respond to the changing climate\u2019s power to destroy \u2013 and still known for leading with his heart. Thankfully, Harvey\u2019s water didn\u2019t enter Wheeler\u2019s home. But when she heard Honor\u00e9 was in Texas, she sent him a message on social media. He responded. The four of them reunited, with the twins rushing to the military man to thank him \u201cfor saving our lives.\u201d Honor\u00e9 put his arms around them all. \u201cBoy, you guys grew up in 12 years!\u201d he said. Then, the decorated soldier \u2013 with degrees from Southern University and A&M College and Troy State University \u2013 quizzed the twins in a key category for middle school students, cultivating a seed already taking root in their young minds: Where did they plan to go to college? Though the boys and Honor\u00e9 stayed in touch from then on, it would be another seven years before they could give him answers to that critical question. \u2018Why I\u2019m still standing here today\u2019 Sitting at the picnic table outside Atlanta in their graduation gowns, the Reynolds twins leaned into the laptop screen Wednesday to speak directly to the man whose lessons they\u2019d begun to learn long before either could remember. A\u2019Mari spoke to Honor\u00e9 first: \u201cI would like to take a moment to give you my deepest gratitudes because your kindness, commitment and bravery during Hurricane Katrina is the reason why I\u2019m still standing here today. \u201cThanks to you, it inspired me,\u201d he said, \u201cand you played a pivotal role in my life, and thanks to you, I\u2019ll be a future addition to the United States Marine Corps.\u201d \u201cOoh-rah!\u201d the career Army man responded with the other branch\u2019s battle cry. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna learn how to say that word: Ooh-rah. \u201cCongratulations,\u201d he continued. \u201cThat\u2019s a great move. Best marines in the world. You\u2019re going to a great outfit, and you\u2019ll come out stronger than you went in.\u201d Next up was J\u2019Mari: \u201cI would also like to \u2026 thank you so much for your bravery and your help that I was able to survive. You gave me at least a bunch of hope that there\u2019s still good in the world, and it gave me a chance to change mentally and physically, where I would be nice to other people, I would help others in need of help. \u201cI\u2019m going to college to do automotive engineering,\u201d he declared. \u201cI want to help other people and make sure everything is safe for them.\u201d Honor\u00e9 retook the floor \u2013 and again raised the stakes: \u201cWell, thank you and good luck. I look forward to you inventing things that will make the world safer from climate change \u2026 because the opportunities are there to change the world with the education you\u2019re gonna get and help save the planet.\u201d Wheeler, for her part, watched it all unfold, including the look on the retired lieutenant general\u2019s face. He also had a message for her: \u201cYou done good!\u201d he told A\u2019Mari\u2019s and J\u2019Mari\u2019s mom. \u201cThey\u2019re here today because of you and your tenacity and your willingness to fight for them. \u201cWhen we saw you on the streets of New Orleans, you motivated the entire United States military to do more and do it quicker and do it better. We are here with admiration today because you inspired us.\u201d Wheeler thanked him, too \u2013 for insisting those soldiers put down their guns, for affirming their survival in Houston, for \u201cchanging our lives forever.\u201d They could never find words enough to thank him, she said, or do enough to repay him. The score, however, didn\u2019t seem like one that needed settling. The first steps of the paths the Reynolds twins now had chosen might well have been lain right there at the corner of Poydras Street, when their exhausted mom happened upon an angel in fatigues. \u201cI feel so gratified,\u201d Honor\u00e9 said. \u201cThe engineer \u2026 can have the capability to change the world, and the Marine that\u2019s going into national service to help protect our freedom and our democracy. \u201cThese young men,\u201d the retired Army man said of the babies he once saved from the teeth of a deadly flood, \u201cwill be game changers.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/23/us/katrina-twins-graduate-honore/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/28/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_05_24_us_alec-baldwin-rust-shooting-case", "text": "A judge in New Mexico denied Alec Baldwin\u2019s motion to dismiss the involuntary manslaughter indictment against him in the \u201cRust\u201d fatal shooting case, connected to the 2021 death of the film\u2019s cinematographer, Halyna Hutchins. Baldwin\u2019s attorneys had accused prosecutors of misconduct during the grand jury process and sought to have the case dismissed. In January, Baldwin pleaded not guilty to involuntary manslaughter in the shooting. Hutchins was fatally shot and director Joel Souza was injured after a gun Baldwin was holding discharged a live round during a scene rehearsal on the New Mexico set of the western movie. It was the second time the actor pleaded not guilty to charges related to the shooting. Involuntary manslaughter charges were dropped against Baldwin in 2023, with prosecutors saying in a statement at the time that they could not \u201cproceed under the current time constraints and on the facts and evidence turned over by law enforcement in its existing form\u201d due to \u201cnew facts\u201d in the case. He was charged for a second time and indicted in January. Baldwin\u2019s lawyers filed a motion to dismiss the indictment in March. They accused prosecutors of engaging in misconduct and said prosecutors \u201cpublicly dragged Baldwin through the cesspool created by their improprieties \u2013 without any regard for the fact that serious criminal charges have been hanging over his head for two and a half years.\u201d Baldwin\u2019s lawyers claimed the prosecution presented false and inaccurate testimony to the grand jury, withheld exculpatory evidence from the grand jury, and gave them improper and prejudicial instructions. In response to Baldwin\u2019s team\u2019s March motion to dismiss the indictment, special prosecutors in New Mexico defended their case, saying Baldwin\u2019s behavior on the \u201cRust\u201d movie set contributed to \u201csafety compromises\u201d that led to the fatal shooting. In the order to deny Baldwin\u2019s motion to dismiss, the judge said despite the defense\u2019s claims,there was no prosecutorial bad faith, as Baldwin\u2019s legal team had claimed, and proper procedures were followed in the grand jury process. In the ruling, the judge said \u201cafter review of transcripts from the January 18, 2024 and January 19, 2024 grand jury presentations, the Court does not find that the \u2018prosecuting attorney assisting the grand jury\u2019 engaged in \u2018intentional misconduct\u2019 reflecting \u2018dishonesty of belief, purpose, or motive\u2019 in the course of the attorney\u2019s \u2018presentation of evidence to the grand jury.\u2019\u201d The film\u2019s armorer, Hannah Gutierrez Reed, who was responsible for firearm safety and storage on the movie\u2019s set, was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter in March. She was sentenced in April to 18 months in prison and is appealing. In a short statement to CNN following a judge\u2019s refusal to dismiss charges against Baldwin, Luke Nikas and Alex Spiro from the actor\u2019s legal team said: \u201cWe look forward to our day in court.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/24/us/alec-baldwin-rust-shooting-case/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/28/2024", "section": "us"}}

{"id": "2024_05_27_business_summer-box-office-memorial-day", "text": "The summer movie season typically starts with a bang during the month of May and, particularly, during Memorial Day weekend. This year, it\u2019s a whimper. Memorial Day weekend (Friday through Monday) movie ticket sales are estimated at $128.3 million, according to Comscore data provided to CNN. That\u2019s down from last year\u2019s Memorial Day weekend, which recorded just shy of $205 million gross revenue, and it lands well under the record holiday in 2013, when \u201cFast & Furious 6\u201d drove the weekend to $314.3 million in revenue. In fact, the US box office is on track to have its lowest-grossing Memorial Day weekend since the $117.1 million seen in 1995, when \u201cCasper\u201d haunted the screens \u2014 and that\u2019s not even adjusting for inflation. \u201cThere\u2019s no way to sugarcoat it, the numbers that are coming out this weekend are nothing to write home about,\u201d Paul Degarabedian, senior media analyst with Comscore, told CNN in an interview. \u201cFuriosa: A Mad Max Saga\u201d was estimated to be the No. 1 movie with $32 million in sales for the weekend. The tepid Memorial Day weekend continues what\u2019s been a lukewarm start to the summer box office, a movie-going season that\u2019s still reeling from the effects of last year\u2019s Hollywood strikes. Coupled with production delays \u2014 the aftershocks of the multi-month-long Writers Guild and SAG-AFTRA strikes that are still reverberating across studios \u2014 the season that has historically drawn the biggest movie theater audiences is off to a rocky start, potentially hurting the yearly box office totals for 2024. \u201cSummer is the most important moviegoing season of the year, accounting on average for nearly 40% of the total domestic annual revenue, so as goes the summer so goes the year,\u201d Dergarabedian said. Last\u00a0summer, blockbusters \u201cBarbie\u201d and \u201cOppenheimer\u201d\u00a0combined added nearly a billion dollars to the domestic box office, according to Comscore data. But this year, studios are betting on a large slate of mid-range sequels and prequels, as well as family-focused animated films to fill the Barbenheimer-shaped hole, including \u201cFuriosa: A Mad Max Saga,\u201d \u201cBad Boys: Ride or Die\u201d and \u201cInside Out 2.\u201d \u201cBarring some major overperformances, this summer looks like it\u2019ll be down 20% to 25% in box office grosses between May and August from last year,\u201d said analyst Shawn Robbins, founder and owner of Box Office Theory. While there was no Marvel movie to kick off this May and no mega-blockbuster for Memorial Day, there\u2019s still potentially a solid pipeline of movies to come this year, Degarabarian said. \u201cWe just now have to count on the films coming out in June and July to really perform \u2014 and there\u2019s some big ones on the horizon,\u201d he said, noting \u201cDespicable Me 4,\u201d \u201cInside-Out 2,\u201d and \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine.\u201d The elusive $100-million opening weekend Until 2020, the period between Memorial Day weekend and Labor Day Monday could be counted on to bring in upwards of $4 billion in domestic revenue, according to Comscore data. Summer 2023 saw the first post-pandemic $4-billion summer. Propelled by the success of \u201cSound of Freedom,\u201d \u201cOppenheimer,\u201d and the record-breaking $155 million \u201cBarbie\u201d opening weekend, summer 2023 grossed $4.09 billion, a 19.2% jump from the year prior. \u201cBarbie\u201d was distributed by Warner Bros., which is owned by CNN\u2019s parent company Warner Bros. Discovery. An opening weekend north of $100 million is typically only seen in intellectual property-driven action films like Star Wars movies and superhero flicks, as well as animated family fare like \u201cThe Incredibles 2\u201d and \u201cFinding Dory.\u201d So far this year, no movie has crossed that threshold. \u201cSans a Marvel movie to provide a $100-million-plus opening weekend to get the momentum going, this summer will have to make up ground in June and July,\u201d said Dergarabedian, adding that this summer has so far been a \u201clate bloomer.\u201d Disney offerings could make or break the summer box office Two movies that analysts say could cross the $100 million threshold this summer are \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine\u201d and \u201cInside Out 2,\u201d both of which are distributed by Walt Disney Studios. The studio\u2019s first wide release of 2024 under its flagship \u201cDisney\u201d banner is set to be \u201cInside Out 2,\u201d an anomaly for the company and the movie business, according to Daniel Loria, editorial director at Box Office Pro, which collects sales and showtimes data from thousands of movie theaters across the United States. (Disney-owned 20th Century Entertainment released its first movie of the year, \u201cThe First Omen,\u201d in April.) \u201cI can\u2019t think of any other year where a studio as vital to this industry sits out the entire first half of the year,\u201d Loria told CNN, adding that this is in large part due to production delays and schedule shifts caused by months of back and forth between studios, the Writers Guild of America and SAG-AFTRA, the actors\u2019 union. \u201cWe tend to overemphasize the effect of Hollywood\u2019s 2023 labor strikes at the box office, but it\u2019s hard not to cite it when you look at the number of releases to have hit theaters from major studios in the first half of the year.\u201d Disney has not responded to CNN\u2019s request for comment. Loria also emphasized that Disney\u2019s summer offerings, both from its Pixar and Marvel divisions, will be critical to how the 2024 box office performs overall. \u201cInside Out 2\u201d is forecast to open anywhere between $80 million and $100 million, according to Box Office Pro pre-sales data. Pixar\u2019s offerings in recent years have fallen flat; 2022\u2019s \u201cLightyear\u201d debuted at $50.5 million domestically, while 2023\u2019s \u201cElemental\u201d made $29.6 million its opening weekend. Meanwhile, \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine,\u201d the only Marvel property release this summer, is expected to reinvigorate audience enthusiasm after \u201cThe Marvels\u201d disappointed last November with a $47 million opening weekend. Last week, ticket seller Fandango announced that \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine\u201d had broken the company\u2019s 2024 record for best first-day ticket presales, beating out \u201cDune: Part Two.\u201d The film also had the best first day of ticket sales for an R-rated film in Fandango\u2019s 24-year history, the company told CNN. \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine has the potential to be the second movie (after 2021\u2019s \u201cSpiderman: No Way Home\u201d) to earn a $200 million opening weekend of the post-pandemic era,\u201d said Loria. \u201cWe are still two months out, but if pre-sales and awareness continue at this pace, we believe the film can open between $170 million and $210 million.\u201d \u201cDespicable Me 4\u201d and \u201cInside Out 2\u201d \u201clook particularly strong, and \u2018Deadpool & Wolverine\u2019 will hands down be the top film of the summer,\u201d said Dergarabedian. Studios still trying to find their footing Industry experts agree that the 2024 box office has been sluggish so far, but remain hopeful that the box office can rebound by the end of the year and beyond. \u201cBox office earnings have been down largely because of staggered gaps between widely appealing releases in the first half of the year,\u201d said Robbins. \u201cThat\u2019s been the status quo in the post-pandemic era for many reasons, mostly outside the control of theatrical exhibition. The industry had only a brief period between the impact of COVID production delays followed by the writers\u2019 and actors\u2019 strikes last year.\u201d Robbins added that there\u2019s still time for strong titles in the second half of the year to fill the gap, including September\u2019s \u201cBeetlejuice Beetlejuice\u201d and \u201cTransformers One,\u201d and October\u2019s \u201cJoker: Folie \u00e0 Deux.\u201d \u201cMoviegoing habits have changed drastically since the\u00a0pandemic, but we continue to see significant enthusiasm when it comes to the theatrical experience,\u201d said Loria. \u201cThe data clearly shows that audiences can still support the studio tentpole model \u2014 but identifying the movies that will become those blockbuster hits continues to be as difficult to predict as ever before.\u201d Box Office Pro projects that the 2024 box office will gross $8.2 billion, about 10% lower than last year\u2019s $9 billion. The domestic earnings for 2023 were the highest since the pandemic, but still fell roughly $2 billion short of pre-pandemic yearly sales, according to Comscore.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/27/business/summer-box-office-memorial-day/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/28/2024", "section": "us"}}

The Colleton County Sheriff\u2019s Office had advised residents in a Facebook post Friday a primate was loose somewhere in the Walterboro area, 48 miles west of Charleston. The sheriff\u2019s office said the animal\u2019s owner was attempting to capture it and called in assistance. It is unclear right now how the monkey was captured or where it was found. \u201cThe outpouring of concern and information from Colleton County residents has been overwhelming and we are thankful for the public\u2019s support in helping to locate Bradley,\u201d the animal services news release read. \u201cWe so appreciate the community\u2019s support for animal welfare.\u201d The monkey, named Bradley, is a 15-year-old macaque who has lived in Walterboro for the past six years, according to animal services. \u201cAnimal Control and the Sheriff\u2019s Office have received numerous tips as to Bradley\u2019s location but because of the attention this situation has caused on social media and news channels, people who are trying to get a look at Bradley are sadly hampering the owner\u2019s efforts to catch him,\u201d animal services Director Laura Clark said. Professionals were hired to help reunite Bradley with his owner, Clark added. An image taken by Walterboro resident Tiffany Edenfield seems to show the primate standing in the grass. It has a red face, similar to some species of baboon and macaque monkeys. One Walterboro resident, Kordell Brabham, didn\u2019t believe his grandmother at first when she said she had spotted a \u201cmonkey\u201d in the yard. \u201cNana, I think you need to go inside, it may be a little too hot out here for you,\u201d Brabham said he told her. But soon after, he spotted the animal his grandmother was talking about. In a video shared with CNN, the escapee can be seen walking on top of a shed. Brabham was shocked and said the first thought running through his mind was, \u201cdon\u2019t get too close, that\u2019s a monkey.\u201d The animal eventually climbed down from the shed and went into a nearby yard, Brabham said. Residents had been advised not to approach the primate, which the sheriff\u2019s office said, \u201ccould be stressed,\u201d and only to report sightings. \u201cPlease monitor your pets while they are outside as a precaution,\u201d the sheriff\u2019s office added. The sheriff\u2019s office had received a report of the primate \u201cattempting to attack a resident\u2019s dog in a yard,\u201d according to South Carolina news station WLTX. It\u2019s unclear how the animal got loose or came to live in Walterboro, a city of over 5,000 people. South Carolina law says it\u2019s illegal to purchase or possess great apes \u2013 chimpanzees, gorillas and orangutans. But it is legal to keep other wild animals as pets, according to the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control. Smaller primates like monkeys and baboons seem to fall outside the state\u2019s law on possessing wildlife.

The legislation passed in the then-Democratically controlled House in June 2020. But it stalled in the Senate. Democratic Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee reintroduced the bill on Thursday, days before the fourth anniversary of Floyd\u2019s murder.\u00a0It calls for law enforcement to be held\u00a0\u201caccountable for misconduct in court,\u201d and police training and policy reforms. \u201cWe have the opportunity to enact bold, comprehensive reform to policing practices, to correct and prevent unnecessary deaths. Congress must pass the George Floyd #JusticeInPolicingAct of 2024,\u201d\u00a0Rep. Jackson Lee wrote in a\u00a0Facebook post. Philonise Floyd agreed. \u201cIn their mind they (police) are looking at you as a target just because you\u2019re somebody of color,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the end of the day, if they can make federal laws to protect the bird, which is the bald eagle, then they can make federal laws to protect people of color.\u201d George Floyd,\u00a0a 46-year-old Black man, was killed on May 25, 2020, while in police custody. Derek Chauvin, a White police officer, was\u00a0filmed\u00a0kneeling on Floyd\u2019s neck and back for\u00a0nearly\u00a0nine minutes\u00a0as Floyd pleaded for help and said he couldn\u2019t breathe. The following year, Chauvin was\u00a0convicted\u00a0of murder and manslaughter in a state trial and sentenced to\u00a0more than 22 years\u00a0in prison. He later\u00a0pleaded guilty\u00a0in federal court of depriving Floyd of his civil rights. Three other former Minneapolis police officers also faced state and federal charges and were sentenced to prison time for their role in Floyd\u2019s murder. Speaking at Thursday\u2019s press conference,\u00a0Democratic Rep. Ilhan\u00a0Omar, who represents Minneapolis,\u00a0called on her fellow lawmakers to\u00a0\u201cthink of the lives that could have been spared if we had the courage to act.\u201d \u201cWe need a clear national standard to uphold the promise of equal protection under the law,\u201d she said. George\u00a0Floyd\u2019s murder sparked a wave of protests against racial injustice and police brutality around the world.\u00a0Four years later, Floyd\u2019s death still feels raw to his family, who were inclined to joined the ranks of Black Americans spurred to action after their loved ones were killed by police. \u201cI promised myself as I\u2019m watching that video (of his death) that I got to do something. And I have not stopped doing something,\u201d\u00a0Floyd\u2019s uncle\u00a0Selwyn Jones told CNN. This spring,\u00a0Jones\u00a0joined Gwen Carr,\u00a0the mother of\u00a0Eric Garner,\u00a0an unarmed Black man who was also killed by police in 2014, to talk about how they\u2019ve turned their pain into purposeful activism at Harvard University. Jones\u00a0said he\u00a0co-founded\u00a0Hope929.org, a charity dedicated to empowering people marginalized by society,\u00a0to bring about change in honor of his nephew. \u201cWhat I can do is I can take the atrocity that he was dealt that day and make a difference,\u201d he said.

Passenger traffic at US airports is on pace to make this Memorial Day weekend the busiest on record, according to Transportation Security Administration screening data. Following record-setting traveler data for Friday (2.951 million, No. 1 screening day in TSA history) and Thursday (2.897 million, No. 3 ever), more than 2.4 million people passed through TSA checkpoints on each day this weekend. What\u2019s amounting to be a blockbuster Memorial Day weekend could be a precursor to a chart-busting summer of travel. It\u2019s also amounting to a frustrating weekend for many travelers. There have been more than 5,000 flight delays and more than 430 cancelations within, into or out of the United States so far on Monday, according to FlightAware data. The number of flight cancellations is now tracking above the average for last year. Five of the top 10 busiest travel days in the TSA\u2019s 22-year history have occurred in the past two weeks alone. \u201cDuring the\u00a0four-day Memorial Day weekend in 2019, approximately 9.5 million passengers were screened; In 2023, that number rose just above 9.8 million,\u201d Regina Boateng, a TSA spokesperson, told CNN via email. \u201cThis year, we expect the four-day\u00a0figure to rise well above 10 million.\u201d She added: \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to compare holidays, as some fall on varying days of the week.\u00a0However, TSA expects this summer to also be the busiest in the agency\u2019s history.\u201d Three-plus years of high inflation have\u00a0taken their toll\u00a0on Americans\u2019\u00a0budgets and, especially, their mindsets. But even though people may be\u00a0feeling pinched, some are still willing to spend \u2014 if not splurge \u2014 on travel and leisure. And there is some good news on the inflation front in that regard: Airline fares dropped in April from March and are actually down a little more than 1% from February 2020, Consumer Price Index data shows. Americans aren\u2019t just taking to the slightly cheaper skies: AAA projected that a record 38.4 million people will take road trips over the long weekend. Gas prices rose sharply to start the year but have held fairly steady in recent weeks. On Monday, the national average for a gallon of regular gasoline was $3.59, a penny higher than this time last year, according to AAA. However, the prices at the pump on Monday were cheaper than last Memorial Day as well as the 10-year average for the holiday, according to GasBuddy data. US gasoline demand breached the 9 million barrels for the week ended May 25, according to GasBuddy data. Demand was up just 0.3% from the comparable pre-Memorial Day week last year, Patrick De Haan, GasBuddy spokesman, told CNN on Monday. \u201cIt was a weak start to the week but roared back on [Thursday through Saturday],\u201d he said via email. \u201cStill well below record gasoline demand, however.\u201d Gas Buddy modeled the current demand at just 9.03 million barrels per day. In the late 2010s, specifically 2019, that figure would likely be 9.5 million barrels per day to 9.8 million barrels per day, De Haan said.

{"id": "2024_05_24_us_american-missionary-couple-haiti", "text": "Three missionaries, including a married couple from the US, were killed in Haiti\u2019s capital, Port-au-Prince, on\u00a0Thursday evening. Davy and Natalie Lloyd \u201cwere attacked by gangs this evening and were both killed,\u201d\u00a0Natalie Lloyd\u2019s father, Missouri state Rep. Ben Baker, said in a Facebook post. \u201cThey went to Heaven together.\u201d \u201cPlease pray for my family we desperately need strength. And please pray for the Lloyd family as well,\u201d Baker said. Mission director Jude Montis, 45, was also killed. All three worked for Missions in Haiti, Inc., which has been operated by Davy Lloyd\u2019s parents for more than\u00a0two decades, according to\u00a0the group\u2019s website. Davy Lloyd, 23, had a \u201clove for Haiti,\u201d his father David Lloyd told CNN. \u201cHis first language was Creole. He used to tell us when he was little that someday he was going to be a missionary in Haiti.\u201d He and Natalie Lloyd, 21, were ambushed as they left church in Port-au-Prince on Thursday evening, according to David Lloyd. \u201cDavy was taken to the house tied up and beat. The gang then took our trucks and loaded everything up they wanted and left,\u201d a post on Missions in Haiti\u2019s\u00a0Facebook page said. Three hours later, the organization\u00a0posted\u00a0that the three missionaries \u201cwere shot and killed by the gang about 9 o\u2019clock this evening. We all are\u00a0devastated.\u201d It\u2019s still unclear how exactly the missionaries were killed. The investigation into the killings is ongoing, and Haitian police have not yet released any details on them. Local emergency response service Haitian Emergency Response Operations (HERO) assisted in coordinating and managing the operation to retrieve the bodies and transport the remains of the American couple to a hospital morgue. \u201cCurrently, we are working to retrieve the bodies of Natalie and Davy,\u201d Baker said on social media Friday night, adding that the effort will involve obtaining a waiver. \u201cAfter that, we have to find an airline that will be willing to do the transport. Prayers that this will all go smoothly.\u201d He remembered the couple as people who put others before themselves, telling CNN Friday evening that he commends their bravery. \u201cI don\u2019t think you can find a better example of people who truly had a deep love for the people of Haiti and had a vision to help them in anyway that they could and made such an impact there among the different ministries they were involved in,\u201d Baker told CNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins on \u201cThe Source.\u201d \u2018Our last call\u2019 David Lloyd told CNN that he was on the phone with his son during the attacks. The mission and church across the street have two security guards, but when the 23-year-old came out of the church around 6 p.m., \u201cthree pick-up trucks full of guys with guns overwhelmed them immediately,\u201d he said. The armed men dragged Davy Lloyd to the house, tied him up, and started looting the compound, according to his father, who said children from the orphanage were in the compound at the time. After the gang left with its haul, Davy Lloyd called his father. \u201cHe was injured, and he was hurt. He was nervous, and very very scared,\u201d David Lloyd said. \u201cHe was begging me to find someone to get in there and help him, and I did all I could but I couldn\u2019t locate anybody.\u201d Then more armed men arrived, he said. \u201cHe told me, \u2018I have to go down, something else is going down. I gotta go see what it is,\u2019\u201d David Lloyd recalled. \u201cThat was basically our last call.\u201d Around that time, someone shot one of the newly arrived gang members, sparking a violent backlash, he said. \u201cDavy went in and barricaded himself in my personal home with his wife and (mission director) Jude Montis. The gang shot that place up until they got the door busted down and shot them, and set Davy and Jude on fire.\u201d HERO, the ambulance service, confirmed to CNN that Davy Lloyd\u2019s body was found burned at the scene. Haitian police will work with international law enforcement to investigate the killings, police spokesperson Gary Desrosiers told CNN on Friday. \u201cThis is an open investigation but we are sure we will arrest those involved. For now, we\u2019re working on protecting the public and the community while actively searching for the perpetrators,\u201d he said. On Missions in Haiti\u2019s website, Davy Lloyd can be seen talking about growing up in the Caribbean nation and doing manual labor on the mission compound. He previously survived a kidnapping in Port-au-Prince in 2005, when he was just 5 years old, his father said. According to a report that year by the Tulsa World newspaper, Davy Lloyd, his sister and foster sister were abducted in a carjacking on their way home from school. But police were able to locate the kidnappers, rescue the children and quickly return them to their parents, according to the report. \u201cWe got them back 21 hours later,\u201d David Lloyd recalled. \u2018The security situation in Haiti cannot wait\u2019 In a statement to CNN Friday, the White House said it was aware of the reports and expressed condolences while urging for the expedited deployment of UN Security Council-approved international police force to the region. \u201cWe are aware of the reports of the deaths of U.S. citizens in Haiti.\u00a0Our hearts go out to the families of those killed as they experience unimaginable grief,\u201d a national security spokesperson told CNN. \u201cThe security situation in Haiti cannot wait. That is why yesterday, President Biden reiterated our commitment to support the expedited the deployment of the Multinational Security Support (MSS) Mission to bolster the Haitian National Police\u2019s capabilities to protect civilians, restore the rule of law, and pave the way to democratic governance.\u201d Missouri Republican Gov. Mike Parson also mourned the couple\u2019s loss on X Friday morning, calling it \u201cabsolutely heartbreaking news.\u201d Until now, the area around the Missions in Haiti compound had felt largely safe despite the violence in the rest of the city, according to David Lloyd, who was in the country until a few days ago. \u201cWe haven\u2019t really heard any gunshots in any of this. Our school\u2019s been open, the church has been functioning, the bakery\u2019s been selling bread every day,\u201d he said. When flights resumed last week to Port-au-Prince\u2019s Toussaint Louverture International Airport, Lloyd said he asked his son and daughter-in-law if they would like to leave Haiti, but they declined. \u201cWe know Haiti is a very volatile situation, we know that it\u2019s dangerous,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we had a good rapport with the groups in our area, and they\u2019d left us alone. But from what I understand this was an outside group that came in initially from about a mile away, that started it all.\u201d Natalie Lloyd\u2019s father told CNN the couple didn\u2019t leave even when they had the opportunity to do so because of the children they were taking care of. \u201cThey made the decision to remain even when it got worse because they felt like if they left, then those kids would have no where to go,\u201d Baker said on \u201cThe Source.\u201d He believes the initial gang attack was just intended as a robbery, with the gangs trying to take what they can before the UN\u2019s Multinational Security Support mission arrives. \u201cWe have a pretty large mission compound, lots of stuff. With the international military force that\u2019s supposed to be coming in any day, I think the gangs are trying to get all they can get because they realize their times may be coming to an end,\u201d he said. In a joint news conference with Kenyan President William Ruto on Thursday, Biden defended the decision not to deploy US troops to Haiti, telling reporters doing so\u00a0could raise \u201call kinds of questions that can be easily misrepresented by what we\u2019re trying to do, and be able to be used by those who disagree with us and against the interests of Haiti and the United States,\u201d while pointing to material support, including equipment and training, the US has already provided to address the crisis. The Facebook feed of\u00a0Missions in Haiti\u00a0has told the story of the increasing dire conditions in the country this year. \u201cThe gangs are still fighting for more control and chaos rules,\u201d the organization\u00a0posted\u00a0April 23. \u201cIt seems the world has turned their backs on Haiti and it is going to be left in complete gang control.\u201d This story and headline have been updated with additional details.

The priest, identified as Father Fidel Rodriguez, initially refused to give the woman Communion bread on May 19 and told her \u201cshe did not do the prior steps necessary\u201d to receive the bread when he encountered her at a Mass held earlier that day at St. Thomas Aquinas Catholic Church, according to police. A statement provided by the Diocese of Orlando states Rodriguez gave the woman a blessing at the 10 a.m. Mass and \u201cadvised her to receive the Sacrament of Penance (Confession) before coming back to receive Holy Communion (Eucharist).\u201d The woman told police she returned to the church for the noon Mass and informed the priest she had in fact done the necessary steps and \u201cis now accepted by God, thus, granting her the ability to participate in communion,\u201d the affidavit states. The priest asked the woman if she \u201chad been to the Sacrament of Penance (Confession), to which she stated it was not his business,\u201d according to the statement from the Diocese. The woman told police Rodriguez allegedly \u201cbecame upset and tried to ram the \u2018cookie\u2019 in her mouth,\u201d according to the affidavit. She said she then attempted to grab another Communion bread, which the priest was holding, when he grabbed and bit her arm, the affidavit states. \u201cFather Rodriguez offered the woman Holy Communion on the tongue. At that point, the woman forcefully placed her hand in the vessel and grabbed some sacred Communion hosts, crushing them,\u201d according to the Diocese\u2019s statement on the incident. \u201cHaving only one hand free, Father Rodriguez struggled to restrain the woman as she refused to let go of the hosts. When the woman pushed him and reacting to a perceived act of aggression, Father Rodriguez bit her hand so she would let go of the hosts she grabbed,\u201d the statement continued. The woman was asked to leave, according to the Diocese, which added the priest had not met her before. When interviewed by police, the priest told the investigating officer the woman had pushed him and \u201cwould not let go of the communion tray and the only way he thought to extract her from it was to bite her arm,\u201d according to the affidavit. \u201cIn the Catholic Tradition, the Eucharist is considered \u2018the source and summit\u2019 of worship and faith. The act of participation in Holy Communion therefore calls for a proper understanding, reverence, and devotion,\u201d the statement from the Diocese reads. \u201cIt is not something a person can arbitrarily demand and is certainly not a mere \u2018cookie\u2019 as the complainant called it,\u201d the statement adds. The woman refused medical attention and police photographed the bite mark, according to the affidavit. St. Cloud Police have forwarded the affidavit summary of events to the State Attorney\u2019s Office for review.

Her family alleges discrimination and negligence contributed to her death. The family of Sahana Ramesh filed a lawsuit\u00a0in Washington\u2019s King County Superior Court against Seattle Children\u2019s hospital, Children\u2019s University Medical Group and\u00a0several unnamed healthcare workers. Sahana\u00a0died from eosinophilic\u00a0myocarditis, an inflammation of the heart muscle,\u00a0in February 2021, according to the complaint. The lawsuit was first filed in 2022 by Sahana\u2019s parents Nalini and Anapathur Ramesh and their son,\u00a0Karthik,\u00a0and alleged negligence but was amended to include racial discrimination allegations,\u00a0according to court documents. Last week, King County Superior Court Judge Elizabeth Berns declined a motion brought by the hospital to dismiss the discrimination claim, court documents show. In her order, Berns wrote the family have \u201cplausibly alleged harm, including dignitary harm, resulting from unlawful discrimination \u2013 not from healthcare.\u201d In August\u00a02020, the family of South Asian descent sought medical treatment at Seattle Children\u2019s\u00a0because Sahana had recurring seizures, which led to a hospital neurologist\u00a0prescribing her lamotrigine, a drug used to prevent or control seizures, the suit says. Sahana\u2019s dosage was doubled shortly after she began taking it and increased by 50 percent that November. She then developed a\u00a0rash on several parts of her body including her hands, stomach, feet and face, the suit says. Within days, the rash worsened, and she was taken to the emergency department of Seattle Children\u2019s,\u00a0where she was diagnosed with a syndrome known as Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms or DRESS, according to the lawsuit. DRESS is a drug allergy that causes fever, rash, facial swelling, enlarged lymph nodes, kidney or liver injury, and in some cases inflammation of organs, according to the\u00a0American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology. Sahana was discharged after the diagnosis, but her symptoms didn\u2019t improve, her family claims in the suit. Over nearly three months, the family sought medical care from the defendants more than a dozen\u00a0times. During that time, her lab results also showed issues with her liver and organ function, the lawsuit says. But\u00a0the \u201cdefendants assured plaintiffs that Sahana could safely be cared for at home,\u201d according to the lawsuit. A spokesperson for Seattle Children\u2019s told CNN, \u201cOur hearts go out to any family mourning the loss of a child and we take our responsibility to provide equitable, high-quality care seriously, but cannot comment on this specific case due to pending litigation.\u201d CNN has reached out to Children\u2019s University Medical Group for comment. Steve Berman, an attorney for the Ramesh family, described Sahana\u2019s death as her family\u2019s \u201cultimate loss\u201d that could have been avoided. \u201cWe believe this was an avoidable tragedy that evidence shows was directly caused by negligence and lack of informed consent, rooted in widespread racism at the hospital,\u201d Berman said in a statement. The lawsuit points to several racial discrimination allegations made against the hospital, including claims that led to\u00a0a 2021 independent review\u00a0of equity, diversity and inclusion policies and practices. The review\u00a0concluded that allegations that a physician called another physician a racist epithet in 2009\u00a0were not adequately investigated by the hospital, and that there was a lack of action to minimize racial disparities in security calls, among other findings, according to a\u00a0summary made public by the hospital. In the lawsuit, attorneys for the family said their clients felt\u00a0ignored and dismissed during their interactions with medical staff and felt \u201cthat they were not welcome, accepted, desired, or solicited at SCH.\u201d The family also alleges in the lawsuit that hospital staff didn\u2019t monitor Sahana\u2019s heart and failed to inform them of the risk of cardiac failure related to DRESS. The Ramesh family requests an unspecified amount of damages.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/24/us/sahana-ramesh-lawsuit-seattle-reaj/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/28/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_05_27_us_bill-walton-death", "text": "Bill Walton, the basketball Hall of Fame center who won two national titles at UCLA, two NBA championships in Portland and Boston and later put the \u201ccolor\u201d in color commentator, died Monday following a prolonged battle with cancer, the NBA announced. Walton was 71. He was surrounded by his family, according to the NBA. \u201cBill Walton was truly one of a kind,\u201d NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said in a statement. \u201cAs a Hall of Fame player, he redefined the center position. His unique all-around skills made him a dominant force at UCLA and led to an NBA regular-season and Finals MVP, two NBA championships and a spot on the NBA\u2019s 50th and 75th Anniversary Teams. \u201cBill then translated his infectious enthusiasm and love for the game to broadcasting, where he delivered insightful and colorful commentary which entertained generations of basketball fans. \u201cBut what I will remember most about him was his zest for life. He was a regular presence at league events \u2013 always upbeat, smiling ear to ear and looking to share his wisdom and warmth. I treasured our close friendship, envied his boundless energy and admired the time he took with every person he encountered.\u201d Walton\u2019s basketball journey began at UCLA, where the 6-foot-11, red-headed center starred under legendary coach John Wooden and led the Bruins to national championships in 1972 and 1973, both in perfect 30-0 seasons. In the \u201973 title game, Walton took 22 shots and missed only one, scoring a championship contest-record 44 points. The team at one point won 88 straight games, a men\u2019s record that still stands. In each of his three varsity seasons, Walton was the national college player of the year and an All-American. Still, Walton and Wooden repeatedly clashed over cultural and political issues, including over Walton\u2019s long hair and his protests against the Vietnam War. In May 1972, Walton was arrested at an antiwar demonstration in the Los Angeles campus. According to a post on the UCLA Library Facebook page, it was Wooden who bailed him out. The big man with the nifty hook shot was the No. 1 pick in the 1974 NBA Draft by the Portland Trail Blazers and led the team to its only NBA championship in 1977. He was named the NBA Finals Most Valuable Player in that playoffs, and the next season he was named the NBA\u2019s regular season MVP. His political remarks made him a controversial figure. In April 1975, Walton called for the rejection of the US government and referred to the FBI, who once questioned him, as \u201cthe enemy,\u201d according to coverage in the New York Times. Hundreds of fans called for him to be traded and team management denounced his statement but kept him on the roster. Walton\u2019s career was derailed due to a series of injuries. He left Portland to play for the San Diego/Los Angeles Clippers from 1979 to 1985 but never reached the heights of those earlier seasons and struggled through foot and knee injuries, which led to almost 40 orthopedic surgeries in his life by his count. He then joined the Boston Celtics, where he rejuvenated his career and in 1986 won the NBA Sixth Man of the Year award as a reliable backup to stars Robert Parish and Kevin McHale. Together, the group won the NBA title in 1986 over the Houston Rockets, the second of Walton\u2019s career. UCLA legend and NBA rival Kareem Abdul-Jabbar said Monday the world feels much heavier with the death of his \u201cgreat friend.\u201d \u201cOn the court, Bill was a fierce player, but off the court he wasn\u2019t happy unless he did everything he could to make everyone around him happy,\u201d he said. \u201cHe was the best of us.\u201d Walton was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1993. From playing to broadcasting Despite growing up with a stutter, Walton went on to a successful broadcasting career as a sometimes outlandish commentator for both NBA and NCAA basketball games, most recently working for ESPN. He was known for bringing a sense of joy, wonder and wackiness to his coverage of the game. A well-known fan of the Grateful Dead, he was often seen wearing tie-dye shirts and sprinkled references to the band in his coverage. He once said on a broadcast, \u201cCome on, that was no foul! It may be a violation of all the basic rules of human decency, but it\u2019s not a foul.\u201d On another: \u201cA lot of people understand what not saying anything means, so, in effect, not saying anything is really saying a lot.\u201d He also liked to flash his intelligence. According to Awful Announcing, one of his best quotes was: \u201cYesterday we celebrated Sir Isaac Newton\u2019s discovery of gravity. Today, Fabricio Oberto is defying it.\u201d He struggled with the consequences of all those injuries, and in 2016 told David Axelrod on the CNN podcast \u201cThe Axe Files\u201d that back pain nearly drove him to suicide in 2008. \u201cWhen you\u2019re in that space, more people commit suicide from back pain than from any other malady. It\u2019s just overwhelming. It destroys every aspect of your life. It destroys every aspect of all the people around you,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd here\u2019s this situation where I had nothing, but then I had this surgery and I\u2019m all better. I take no medication. I have no pain. I go full speed ahead now. I\u2019ve never been busier. I\u2019ve never been happier. I haven\u2019t been this healthy since I was 13 years old. In all these years I never thought that I\u2019d be free of pain, I never thought that I\u2019d be happy in love, and I have both of those today. I am the luckiest guy on earth.\u201d He also told Axelrod how he dealt with his stutter. \u201cI could not say hello. I could not say thank you. I could not say a single word without just, the stammer, the stutter, the hesitation, and I just could not express myself,\u201d he said. \u201cI express myself through\u00a0sports.\u00a0I express myself to reading. I express myself through just being a part of a bigger world that I only dreamed I could ever be a part of.\u201d Famed announced and former track star Marty Glickman helped Walton work through his speech impediment when Walton was 28. \u201cHe took me over in the corner. We stood behind a potted plant and in five minutes, he just laid it out. Bam! Bam! Bam! This is how you learn how to talk,\u201d he said. In the wake of Walton\u2019s death, Axelrod praised Walton was more than a basketball player. \u201cHe was an all-world human being, with a huge heart and infectious enthusiasm for life. He lived through intolerable pain and yet, as an announcer, managed to lift our burdens and make us smile,\u201d he posted on X. UCLA men\u2019s basketball coach Mick Cronin offered his condolences and praised Walton\u2019s legacy in a statement. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to put into words what he has meant to UCLA\u2019s program, as well as his tremendous impact on college basketball,\u201d he said. \u201cBeyond his remarkable accomplishments as a player, it\u2019s his relentless energy, enthusiasm for the game and unwavering candor that have been the hallmarks of his larger than life personality.\u201d Walton is survived by his wife, Lori, and four boys, all of whom played college basketball. Luke Walton won two NBA titles with the Los Angeles Lakers, meaning he and his dad were the first father-son combination with multiple NBA rings. Bill Walton\u2019s brother Bruce, who died in 2019, played in the Super Bowl with the Dallas Cowboys in January 1976, and they were the first siblings to play in NFL and NBA championship games.

Massachusetts police are also investigating whether the assailant at the McDonald\u2019s in Plymouth also stabbed four girls between ages 9 and 17 about an hour earlier at a movie theater in Braintree. Jared Ravizza, 26, is the suspect in \u201cmultiple South Shore stabbing incidents,\u201d the Plymouth County District Attorney\u2019s Office said, though no details were given for the other incidents. Braintree police have said it \u201cappears as though\u201d the attacks at the movie theater and the McDonald\u2019s are related. Ravizza was arrested and faces charges of assault with intent to murder and two counts of assault and battery with a dangerous weapon in connection with the attack at McDonald\u2019s. The suspect is expected to appear in\u00a0court Tuesday, and it was not immediately clear Monday whether Ravizza had an attorney. Last month, Ravizza was arrested on Martha\u2019s Vineyard, accused of assault and battery of a family member and vandalism, according to records at Edgartown District Court. Records show that case has not been adjudicated. Ravizza\u2019s father told officers Jared \u201chad just had a mental break and attacked him\u201d inside his home, The Boston Globe reported, citing a police report on file with the court. The report also said Ravizza allegedly wrecked the father\u2019s home office, according to The Boston Globe. Ravizza was sent to Martha\u2019s Vineyard Hospital for a mental health evaluation, but \u201cdid not meet their standards to be held,\u201d the Boston Globe reported, citing the report. How the weekend stabbings unfolded The first attack happened around 6 p.m. Saturday at an AMC movie theater in Braintree. \u201cWithout saying anything and without any warning, (the assailant) suddenly attacked and stabbed the four young females,\u201d police said. \u201cThe attack appeared to be unprovoked. After the attack, the (suspect) ran out of the theater and left in a vehicle.\u201d The girls were taken to Boston hospitals with non-life-threatening injuries, Braintree police said. The theater was put on lockdown shortly after the incident, an AMC employee told CNN. The suspect fled the theater in what appeared to be a black SUV, and video footage allowed authorities to capture its license plate, authorities said. A vehicle matching the description was \u201creportedly involved in (a) similar assault in Plymouth,\u201d about 25 miles southeast of Braintree, police said. About an hour after the movie theater stabbings, a 21-year-old woman and a 29-year-old man were stabbed at the McDonald\u2019s in Plymouth. Ravizza allegedly arrived at the scene of the Plymouth McDonald\u2019s in a black Porsche Macan SUV, prosecutors said. Surveillance footage from the McDonald\u2019s appears to show Ravizza reach through the drive-through window and stab the male victim with a large knife, prosecutors said. Video then shows the suspect park the car, enter the restaurant and stab the female victim before fleeing in the car, the district attorney\u2019s office said. Both victims from the McDonald\u2019s attack were taken to hospitals with non-life-threatening injuries, officials said. Minutes after the McDonald\u2019s stabbings, state troopers located the suspect\u2019s car and tried to pull it over, authorities said. But the driver failed to stop, and a chase ensued. The suspect\u2019s vehicle eventually crashed in Sandwich, about a 25-minute drive south of Plymouth, police said. Ravizza was being treated for non-life-threatening injuries at a hospital Sunday, the prosecutor\u2019s office said. While Ravizza faces assault charges in connection with the McDonald\u2019s attack, \u201cPreliminary investigation suggests a likely connection to an earlier incident at a movie theater in Braintree resulting in non-life threatening injuries to four juveniles,\u201d state police said. It was not immediately clear whether Ravizza has an attorney. CNN has sought more information from Massachusetts State Police,\u00a0the Plymouth County District Attorney\u2019s Office and the Braintree Police Department. Massachusetts State Police said the investigation is ongoing. Investigators probe another possible link Aside from the Massachusetts stabbings, Connecticut State Police said a suspect linked to a death in the town of Deep River had been taken into custody in Massachusetts. But police in neither state have confirmed whether the Connecticut case is connected to the stabbings in Massachusetts. Connecticut State Police said they responded Saturday afternoon to a \u201cdisturbance\u201d at an address in Deep River. There, police found a \u201cdeceased individual\u201d whose identity has not been confirmed, Connecticut State Police said. \u201cA suspect in this investigation has been taken into custody in the State of Massachusetts and there is no active threat to the public,\u201d Connecticut police said. Authorities did not name that suspect. CNN\u2019s Celina Tebor, Paradise Afshar, Samantha Beech, Artemis Moshtaghian, Caroll Alvarado and Kristina Sgueglia contributed to this report.

The four inmates, all being held in connection with violent crimes, escaped from the Tangipahoa Parish Jail north of New Orleans, according to a Facebook post from Sheriff Daniel Edwards. Two were taken into custody Sunday morning, and authorities are searching for the other two. Authorities believe two inmates left the facility Saturday afternoon and the other two left Sunday afternoon, Jimmy Travis, chief of operations for the Tangipahoa Parish Sheriff\u2019s Office, said at a Monday news conference. The sheriff\u2019s office did not learn the inmates had escaped until Sunday afternoon, when a \u201cconcerned citizen\u201d contacted the warden and reported two of the escapees had come to a relative\u2019s house looking for a \u201cplace to stay,\u201d Jail administrators then realized a total of four inmates were missing. \u201cThe four inmates were able to escape the perimeter fence of the Parish Jail while participating in their recreation time on the yard,\u201d the sheriff said. According to the Facebook post, a section of the fence was found in an inspection to be \u201cvulnerable and easily maneuvered\u201d\u00a0as to allow \u201ca small statured body\u201d to slide through, the social media post said. The sheriff\u2019s office identified the two inmates still at large as Omarion Hookfin, 19, and Jamarcus Cyprian, 20. \u201cWe feel that they\u2019re no longer in Tangipahoa Parish,\u201d Travis said Monday. He added anyone who assisted the escapees in leaving the area would also face charges. The other two, Avery Guidry, 19, and Travon Johnson, 21, were found hiding in the dumpster Sunday morning, the sheriff\u2019s office reported. They were unarmed when found, Travis said. Hookfin, Guidry and Johnson were charged in connection to a 2022 home invasion that left a man dead and his 12-year-old daughter injured, CNN affiliate\u00a0WDSU reported. They were awaiting trial. The fourth escapee, Cyprian, was \u201cserving time for armed robbery and weapon charges,\u201d the sheriff said. It is \u201cvery concerning\u201d authorities did not realize the inmates were missing until someone reached out, Travis said. \u201cIf the proper headcounts had been conducted, we would have known about it immediately.\u201d Travis said \u201clack of correctional supervision\u201d as well as corroded wire in a perimeter fence made the escapes possible. \u201cWe\u2019re short-staffed \u2013 it\u2019s no excuse \u2013 but we\u2019re short-staffed,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s a failure.

{"id": "2024_05_27_economy_more-americans-are-retiring-abroad-heres-why", "text": "Laura Barnett has always had a bit of wanderlust. When she was a kid, her father took a job as a teacher with the US Department of Defense and moved his family from rural Kentucky to Poitiers, France, which is when the travel bug hit. She\u2019s been to over 38 countries in her 54 years. But during the pandemic, something changed. Travel was impossible, and her life in Fayetteville, North Carolina, started to feel small. \u201cI just got sick of living in suburbia. It felt like the world was potentially going to end, and I [said to my husband], \u2018dude, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve done everything we want to do.\u2019\u201d She brought up the idea of moving to Portugal. As America\u2019s retirement crisis grows, so too does the dream of retiring abroad where cities are walkable, social services plentiful and the cost of living affordable: Gelato in the piazza, white sand and year-round sun, little villages tucked into ocean coves and cheap health care all sound pretty good. But while retirees might imagine spending their golden years full of pasta and palazzos, the realities of moving abroad are much less romantic. There\u2019s often more bureaucracy than bruschetta. Laura\u2019s husband, Chris, was initially skeptical about the move. He didn\u2019t think retiring abroad was feasible. Plus, they\u2019d be leaving behind their two sons and two grandsons. But Laura persisted. \u201cWe\u2019ve done everything they told us to do. We\u2019ve saved our money. We\u2019ve worked for the same company for decades. We\u2019ve done everything, and I keep looking to the future \u2014 and I can\u2019t stomach having to work until I\u2019m 65 years old just because we can\u2019t afford health care otherwise,\u201d she said. \u201c[The US] has set up a system where even if we have the money to cover our day-to-day expenses \u2014 rent, food, travel \u2014 all of a sudden there\u2019s this other line item called health care. That\u2019s about $1,500 a month, more than our house payment.\u201d Chris and Laura have traveled to Portugal three times to look for places to settle and have a three-year plan set in place to move there permanently. There are a lot of upsides: The weather is favorable year-round, it\u2019s affordable, private health insurance costs about $300 per month for couples and there\u2019s a better sense of work-life balance. (CNN converted prices throughout this story into US dollars from local currencies.) But there are also some downsides. Leaving behind family is a big one. Until the Barnetts receive their residency card, they\u2019ll only be allowed to leave and enter Portugal twice, and their initial arrival into the country counts. \u201cWe have aging parents in their late 80s.\u00a0Not having the freedom to easily respond if we are needed until we have that card is very concerning. Being lonely and not having friends and having to start from scratch with that is also in this mix,\u201d said Laura. Portuguese is not an easy language to learn, and adapting to a new culture late in life won\u2019t be easy. Recent revisions to Portuguese immigration programs also make the tax situation much less favorable for Americans. But in the end, the finances won out. \u201cOur goal, which is very doable based on research, is to live on less than $3,500 per month in Portugal while still being able to afford travel in Europe,\u201d said Laura. Their financial adviser told them that to comfortably retire in the US, they\u2019d need to have about double that amount \u2014 $7,000 per month. Packing up shop As America\u2019s retirement crisis grows, so too does the dream of retiring abroad. It\u2019s becoming increasingly expensive to retire in the US. Just 43% of non-retired adults in the US think they will have enough money to live comfortably when they retire, according to Gallup in 2023. That\u2019s the lowest level for that metric since 2012. At the same time, the number of Americans looking to settle outside of the country has tripled over the past 30 years, according to a 2024 Monmouth poll. The number of Social Security recipients living outside the US increased from 307,000 in 2008 to more than 450,000 in 2022. Some countries are even taking advantage of this boom and have eased their visa requirements to attract older US expats. But packing up a life and moving it abroad is not a simple task, and retirees often find themselves in over their heads. \u201cPeople need to think about estate planning, which is often different abroad,\u201d said Brett Spencer, the founder of Impact Financial, a financial advisory firm that specializes in Americans living abroad. \u201cThey need to think about currency, complicated taxes and their investments. Even opening a bank account abroad can be complicated.\u201d Spencer says he\u2019s had clients who have had their bank accounts closed with no warning, leaving them working through nuanced protocol in another language and without access to any funds. These types of complications aren\u2019t uncommon. Escape to Italy Patience Dunbar, who will be 63 next month, and her husband, Charles Ippoliti, 69, have been living full time in Arona, a lakeside town in northern Italy, since 2022. Their typical day consists of coffee and the crossword, a leisurely stroll around the lake, stops at the local outdoor market for fresh fruit and vegetables and a lunch in the town square. Occasionally, they\u2019ll take the train into Milan, about 40 minutes away. \u201cIt\u2019s a very leisurely pace,\u201d said Charles. They feel healthier than they did back home, they\u2019ve lost weight and they are exercising more. That\u2019s part of the reason they decided to look abroad in the first place. In 2020, when the couple was living in Oregon, Charles suffered from severe Covid complications. He was hospitalized for a few weeks and then put on oxygen at home for a few more. \u201cWe thought \u2018well this is silly, why are we wasting our time?\u2019 As soon as we could we decided to make the most of this,\u201d said Patience. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to wait five more years until Charles was in his late 70s to retire. What if he\u2019s not able to enjoy those years?\u201d The pair applied for their codice fiscale, similar to a Social Security number, and purchased their apartment in Arona. They paid about $72,000 for their first apartment there and later sold it and upgraded to a larger home for $160,000. The food is less expensive and a fancy dinner with wine runs them about $55. Most importantly, they pay $2,200 a year for their health care. That includes visits with specialists for Charles, who has a heart condition. But it\u2019s hard to be away from family, and they have struggled to learn Italian. They thought the language would come more easily. Dealing with the government can be troubling at times, and filing paperwork has become a full-time job for them. Plus, they\u2019re starting to worry about the political landscape. Giorgia Meloni, a far-right leader, is the current Italian premier and has anti-immigration views. They worry that policy could change and they might have to go back to the States. We\u2019re not in Kansas anymore \u201cI would say that, without a doubt, whatever lifestyle you want, you\u2019ll be able to find it at a lower cost than you could in the United States,\u201d said Kathleen Peddicord, the founder and CEO of advisory firm Live and Invest Overseas. \u201cUnless the lifestyle you want is living in a small town in the Midwest,\u201d she added. \u201cIf what you want in retirement is to live in a small town, surrounded by your family and your grandkids, that\u2019s great.\u201d Living abroad isn\u2019t for everyone. It probably won\u2019t work for those who seek out creature comforts in their retirement. \u201cIt\u2019s hard work. I think that\u2019s the reality that a lot of people probably aren\u2019t prepared for,\u201d said Peddicord, who splits her time with her husband between Paris and Panama City, Panama. Some people Peddicord advises don\u2019t make it to another country because they get burned out by the loads of administrative work involved. \u201cYou have to create a whole new life for yourself in a very short space of time, in another culture, in another language,\u201d she said. \u201cAll of the things that you do to create your life in the States: You got a driver\u2019s license at 15 or 16, you opened a bank account, you got your first credit card, you bought a car, you rented a house, you paid utilities, you did all that over time. Now you have to do it at once and without the support of friends and family.\u201d Many people who make the move end up feeling isolated and lonely. Still, Peddicord says her business has exploded as more Americans retire abroad, and a cottage industry to help people navigate the nuances of the task has quickly sprung up. South of the border As retirement decisions loomed for Bill and Jacki Dahl, now 69 and 75, respectively, they were forced to confront the fact that their retirement income would not continue to support the same lifestyle they had enjoyed in the US while working. They decided that moving to a less expensive country was a good way to stretch their dollar and keep their lifestyle the same. After four years of research and four exploratory trips, they made the move to Quer\u00e9taro, a city in the center of Mexico. In 2019, the Dahls sold nearly everything they had accumulated during 30 years of marriage \u2014 including their home in Oregon \u2014 to fund the trip, said goodbye to their four children and grandchildren, and drove to Mexico. Upon arriving, they finalized their official immigration documents \u2014 they\u2019re both \u201cresidente-permanente,\u201d permanent residents, meaning they\u2019re still US citizens. They rent a three-bedroom, two-story home with a large garden for about $940 a month. Food is cheap, and they have Medicare so that they can return to the United States for any serious medical care. But for smaller things, they remain local \u2014 it costs about $35 to visit the dentist, for example. \u201cWe live on a fixed monthly income,\u201d said Bill. \u201cWe do not have a bunch of savings. We do not have a bunch of investments,\u201d but they\u2019re able to get by and still have money left over for travel and adventure. \u201cWe both adore people, art, food, travel and cultural diversity,\u201d said Bill. \u201cWe love it here.\u201d Still, it hasn\u2019t been smooth sailing. \u201cRelocation to Mexico is not for everyone,\u201d he warned. Climate change means that there are more droughts in Mexico and more pollution, water can be scarce, and sometimes the power goes out, said Bill. Another surprise for the Dahls has been the rising strength of the peso against the US dollar. Bill estimates that his purchasing power is now worth about 30% less than it was before the pandemic. The financial requirements for legal, permanent residency in Mexico have also increased substantially, and immigration services are \u201ccumbersome and inefficient,\u201d said Bill. Violence is on the rise ahead of national elections later this year, he added. It\u2019s not for the faint of heart, or people who want a carefree retirement, he said. But, he added, \u201cwe have no desire whatsoever to return to live in the US\u2026we are deeply grateful to be resident-guests of such a marvelous place to live during the retirement season of our life.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/27/economy/more-americans-are-retiring-abroad-heres-why/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/28/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_05_26_politics_rfk-jr-nominated-libertarian-party", "text": "Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was eliminated from contention for the Libertarian Party\u2019s presidential nomination during the party\u2019s convention Sunday. In a surprise move earlier Sunday, Kennedy was put up for consideration as a nominee to represent the party in 2024. But he received support from just 19 delegates, or 2.07%, in the first round of voting and was eliminated. Political activist Chase Oliver ultimately won the Libertarian presidential nomination Sunday night at the convention in Washington, DC, after seven rounds of voting. Kennedy, who spoke at the convention on Friday, was nominated by a delegate Sunday on the convention floor, where his candidacy was met with boos from other delegates. Donald Trump was also nominated on the convention floor Sunday, but Libertarian Party Chair Angela McArdle ruled that the former president did not qualify because he did not submit nominating papers. Trump spoke Saturday at the convention, where he was loudly and consistently booed, particularly when he asked attendees to \u201cnominate me or at least vote for me.\u201d Trump received votes from six delegates as a write-in candidate. In a rebuke of the former president, adult film actress Stormy Daniels \u2013 whose alleged affair with Trump is at the center of his hush money trial in New York \u2013 received a vote from one delegate. (Trump has denied the affair and pleaded not guilty in the case.) Candidates who received less than 5% of the vote were eliminated in the first round. In each subsequent round, the candidate with the lowest vote total was eliminated. After Kennedy\u2019s elimination, he urged Libertarians to back his campaign even though \u201cwe may not agree on every downstream issue.\u201d The independent hopeful said in a social media post Sunday that addressing the convention was \u201ca high point of my campaign.\u201d \u201cWhat an unexpected honor to wake up this morning to a groundswell in the Libertarian Party seeking to nominate me. I would have accepted the nomination if offered because independents and third parties need to unite right now to reclaim our country from the corrupt two-party system,\u201d Kennedy said. Kennedy told CNN last week that he did not intend to seek the party\u2019s nomination at the convention this weekend. Tim O\u2019Brien, a Libertarian delegate from New Jersey, said he felt Kennedy was trying to use the party for his own gain without respecting its values. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a lot of people come into the party, they\u2019ll run, they\u2019ll make a big stink and then leave. And I guarantee you, he may come here; he\u2019s not going to be here after the election,\u201d O\u2019Brien said. \u201cWe want people that are willing to say, full force, \u2018We\u2019re Libertarians, we\u2019re staying with you guys,\u2019\u201d he added. \u201cHe has no need for us. He wants to get ballot access.\u201d Kennedy, a onetime Democrat, began courting Libertarian officials even before he left the Democratic presidential primary last fall to run as an independent. He met with McArdle in July and February to discuss their shared beliefs. The Libertarian ticket was seen as a possible pathway for Kennedy to circumvent ballot access hurdles and take advantage of the party\u2019s access to ballots in dozens of states. Kennedy is on the ballot in six states so far, compared with 38 states for the Libertarians. Kennedy\u2019s running mate, Nicole Shanahan, told CNN on Sunday that the Libertarian Party was \u201cmore relevant than ever\u201d and that \u201cthere\u2019s a great deal of possibility of success of us working together.\u201d The Silicon Valley attorney and entrepreneur\u2019s comments marked the first time she has taken questions from a major news outlet since she joined Kennedy\u2019s campaign in March. Shanahan had been expected to make remarks at the convention Sunday but said she ultimately did not as party votes were running behind schedule. On Monday, she shared on social media the text of the speech she had expected to give. Her planned remarks included telling the audience that Covid-19 vaccines were \u201cunsafe\u201d and \u201cineffective\u201d and pledging to protect civil liberties from government and corporate overreach. \u201cThe reason why a candidate like Bobby Kennedy can win this next election is because he is the only candidate who has successfully fought the institutions and corporations that have stolen our right to health and liberty. He understands the deeply troubling, almost demonic forces that have overtaken our agencies, and our culture,\u201d the prepared remarks read. \u201cThe vaccine mandates that spread across the globe in 2021 were wrong, not only because the vaccines were unsafe, and not only because they were ineffective. They were wrong because they deprived us of the most basic liberty there is,\u201d the prepared remarks continued. Covid-19 vaccines have proved to be safe and effective. Shanahan\u2019s planned speech also made multiple references to former Texas Rep. Ron Paul, who previously ran for president as both a Libertarian and a Republican. Kennedy told CNN last week following a rally in Colorado that his views on the environment, foreign policy and Covid-19 would appeal to Libertarian voters. \u201cMy approach is a free-market approach, which appeals to Libertarians,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m against war, which I think is another important issue for Libertarians. I support constitutional rights. President Trump dismantled our constitutional rights during Covid. So I think Libertarians are probably more inclined to support me if they follow their philosophies.\u201d Trump and Kennedy in recent weeks have ramped up their attacks on each other, as the former president\u2019s advisers increasingly come to see the independent\u2019s bid as a potential problem in an election expected to be decided by a narrow margin in a handful of states. Kennedy\u2019s support in national surveys has reached double digits \u2013 at 16% in a\u00a0CNN poll conducted last month by SSRS\u00a0\u2013 with strong indications that he is siphoning support from both Trump and President Joe Biden. As the threat has crystalized, so have Trump\u2019s attacks on Kennedy. The former president now regularly attacks Kennedy in public remarks and on social media. Earlier this month, Trump released a lengthy video that labeled Kennedy a \u201cDemocrat plant.\u201d This story and headline have been updated with additional developments.

{"id": "2024_05_23_us_scottie-scheffler-arrest-update-louisville", "text": "Louisville police released two videos Thursday showing some of the arrest of star golfer Scottie Scheffler last week and announced the detective who arrested him was disciplined for not turning on his body-worn camera at the time. One video from a fixed pole camera positioned across the street shows portions of the interaction between Scheffler and police. In the video, a vehicle turns left and an officer wearing reflective gear runs toward the vehicle, which then stops. Police then take the driver out of the car and a group of three people walk across the street. A second video from a police vehicle\u2019s dashcam shows two officers walking with a handcuffed Scheffler. The videos were released a week after Scheffler was arrested, charged with felony assault, released from jail and then made his tee time in a whirlwind few hours at the PGA Championship, one of golf\u2019s four major tournaments. The world no. 1 golfer was attempting to drive to the Valhalla Golf Club in Louisville for the second round of the tournament at about 6 a.m. when he came to the scene of a fatal crash. He allegedly injured a police officer who was directing traffic and was arrested, according to police. Scheffler, 27, a new father with a sterling reputation, was charged with felony second-degree assault on a police officer, along with lesser charges of third-degree criminal mischief, reckless driving and disregarding signals from officers directing traffic, according to Jefferson County court records. After taking a mug shot and warming up in a jail cell, he was released and made it to his tee time at the golf club. He then shot 5-under that day on his way to finishing the tournament in a tie for 8th place. Scheffler described the incident as a \u201cbig misunderstanding\u201d during a \u201cchaotic situation.\u201d After the news conference Thursday, Scheffler\u2019s attorney, Steve Romines, reiterated the golfer still plans to plead not guilty to the charges. \u201cIt won\u2019t impact my case at all. Our position is the same as it was last Friday: Scottie Scheffler didn\u2019t do anything wrong. We\u2019re not interested in settling the case. We will either try it or it\u2019ll be dismissed. It\u2019s very simple,\u201d he said. \u201cAll the evidence that continues to come out just continues to support what Scottie said all along, this was a chaotic situation and a miscommunication and he didn\u2019t do anything wrong.\u201d High-ranking police officials in Louisville have privately voiced concerns a felony charge against Scheffler is excessive, a source familiar with the discussions told CNN. Prosecutors said Thursday they continue to investigate the case. \u201cThe Jefferson County Attorney\u2019s office has continued to receive evidence and has yet to conduct final interviews with investigators regarding the charges filed by LMPD against Mr. Scheffler,\u201d said Josh Abner, a spokesman for the office. \u201cAs we have stated previously, no decisions have been made and our review continues.\u201d Scheffler, meanwhile, teed off for his first round at the Charles Schwab Challenge in Fort Worth, Texas, on Thursday afternoon. Police discipline detective for not activating body-worn camera At a news conference Thursday, Louisville\u2019s mayor and police chief announced an internal investigation of the case led to discipline for the arresting officer, Detective Bryan Gillis. \u201cDetective Gillis should have turned on his body-worn camera, but did not,\u201d Police Chief Jacquelyn Gwinn-Villaroel said. \u201cHis failure to do so is a violation of the LMPD policy on uniforms and equipment, subject category body-worn camera.\u201d The police chief said Gillis did not have his body-worn camera \u201coperationally ready\u201d as required. The detective has received \u201ccorrective action,\u201d said the chief, who did not provide specifics about the discipline at the news conference. A Louisville police memo the department subsequently released Thursday said the detective \u201cwas counseled by a member of his command on May 22, 2024, and a performance observation was completed.\u201d The memo was among documents released related to the detective\u2019s failure to activate his body-worn camera. In one, Gillis explained he \u201cnever powered up\u201d the camera and described his own version of what happened. \u201cWhile directing traffic in front of Gate 1 the PGA personnel stopped a bus from entering Gate 1,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI observed a vehicle traveling in the opposing lanes coming at me. I stopped the driver and advised him he could not proceed because of the bus. He demanded to be let in, and proceeded forward against my directions. I was dragged/knocked down by the driver. I then proceeded to arrest the driver.\u201d Neither Mayor Craig Greenberg nor the police chief took questions from the media at Thursday\u2019s news conference. \u201cActivating body-worn cameras is critically important for our police department to have evidence, to maintain community trust, to be transparent,\u201d Greenberg said. Documents obtained by CNN show Gillis has a history of both reprimands and suspensions within the police department. Gillis, who began his service in 2007,\u00a0has received six reprimands throughout his time with Louisville police, a disciplinary history report shows.\u00a0He has also been suspended on five separate occasions. None of Gillis\u2019 prior suspensions involved failing to turn on his body-worn camera. Records also show Gillis has received several commendations during his career, including back-to-back Meritorious Unit Citations in 2019. The detective\u2019s longest suspension at five days stems from a 2012 incident in which\u00a0Gillis allegedly drove an \u201cintoxicated civilian\u201d in his police vehicle while doing \u201cdonuts\u201d in a business parking lot while his emergency lights were illuminated, according to a 2013 LMPD document. More recently, in 2021, Gillis received a written reprimand for pursuing \u201ca vehicle that did not commit a violent felony or wanted on a warrant,\u201d\u00a0documents show. Additionally, Gillis did not tell dispatchers he was engaging in a vehicle pursuit at the time, according to LMPD documents. The year prior, in 2012, he faced a four-day suspension for failing to appear in court on multiple occasions between 2010 and 2011. Documents show Gillis was also found \u201cat fault\u201d for three crashes, for which he received reprimands and mandatory driver\u2019s training. CNN has reached out to the Louisville Police Department for comment and was told \u201cas this matter is before the courts, commenting further on the participants (defendants, witnesses, and victims alike) is not appropriate for us to do.\u201d Gillis did not immediately respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment Friday. CNN has also reached out to\u00a0the River City Fraternal Order of Police Lodge 614, the union representing LMPD detectives, for comment on Gillis\u2019 past conduct. What we know about the arrest According to a Louisville Metro Police report, Scheffler was trying to drive into the golf course when he was stopped by an officer wearing a full police uniform and a yellow reflective rain jacket. The officer, identified as Gillis, stopped Scheffler and \u201cattempted to give instructions,\u201d the report states. \u201cSubject refused to comply and accelerated forward, dragging Detective Gillis to the ground,\u201d according to the report. The detective suffered pain, swelling and abrasions to his left wrist and knee and was taken to the hospital for further treatment, the report states. His uniform pants, valued at about $80, \u201cwere damaged beyond repair,\u201d the report adds. Romines, Scheffler\u2019s attorney, said the golfer was headed to the course early to prepare to play. \u201cDue to the combination of event traffic and a traffic fatality in the area, it was a very chaotic situation. He was proceeding as directed by another traffic officer and driving a marked player\u2019s vehicle with credentials visible,\u201d Romines said in a statement. \u201cIn the confusion, Scottie is alleged to have disregarded a different officer\u2019s traffic signals resulting in these charges.\u201d Multiple eyewitnesses have said Scheffler \u201cdid not do anything wrong\u201d but drove as directed, according to Romines. \u201cHe stopped immediately upon being directed to and never at any point assaulted any officer with his vehicle,\u201d the statement reads. ESPN\u2019s Jeff Darlington witnessed the encounter and filmed part of it. When Scheffler arrived in a marked player courtesy vehicle, he tried to drive around the crash scene on a median, according to ESPN. Darlington wrote on social media Scheffler \u201ccontinued to drive about 10 to 20 yards toward the entrance\u201d before stopping. \u201cThe police officer attempted to attach himself to Scheffler\u2019s car, and Scheffler then stopped his vehicle at the entrance to Valhalla,\u201d Darlington\u00a0wrote on X. \u201cThe police officer then began to scream at Scheffler to get out of the car. When Scheffler exited the vehicle, the officer shoved Scheffler against the car and immediately placed him in handcuffs.\u201d Police escorted a handcuffed Scheffler into a police vehicle, Darlington\u2019s video shows. \u201cRight now he\u2019s going to jail,\u201d an officer at the scene says in the video. Scheffler\u2019s arraignment was originally scheduled for Tuesday but was delayed to June due to his attorney\u2019s scheduling issue.

The Legal Aid Society, which represents Taylor, declined to comment. The incident happened about 2:45 p.m. Saturday as a train was pulling up to Manhattan\u2019s Houston Street station. According to the complaint, Taylor threw a burning object at two people, causing a male victim\u2019s body to catch fire and causing \u201csignificant burns\u201d to his head, neck, arm and chest.

{"id": "2024_05_27_politics_biden-memorial-day-address-arlington-national-cemetery", "text": "President Joe Biden on Monday commemorated Memorial Day during remarks at Arlington National Cemetery, where he marked the solemn and personal occasion by thanking those killed while serving their country in the name of democracy around the world. \u201cFreedom has never been guaranteed \u2013 every generation has to earn it, fight for it, defend it in battle between autocracy and democracy, between the greed of a few and the rights of many. It matters, our democracy is more than just a system of government. It\u2019s the very soul of America,\u201d Biden told the crowd gathered for his annual Memorial Day Address. The president took the opportunity to honor those killed while serving their country and also thanked veterans, survivors and family members in the audience on Memorial Day. \u201cWe gather at this sacred place, at this solemn moment, to remember, to honor \u2013honor the sacrifice of the hundreds of thousands of women and men who have given their lives to this nation,\u201d he said. \u201cEach one, literally \u2026 a link in the chain of honor stretching back to our founding days, each one bound by common commitment; not to a place, not to a person, not to a president, but to an idea unlike any idea in human history: the idea of the United States of America. Today, we bear witness to the price they paid.\u201d The day is also personal for the president. Biden spoke about the death of his son, Beau Biden, from brain cancer that he believes was linked to the toxic burn pits Beau Biden was exposed to during his tour in Iraq. Thursday will mark the ninth anniversary of Beau Biden\u2019s death. \u201cOur losses are not the same: He didn\u2019t perish in the battlefield, he was a cancer victim from a consequence of being in the Army in Iraq for a year next to a burn pit,\u201d Biden said. \u201cA major in the US Army National Guard living and working, like too many, besides that toxic burn pit. And as it is for so many of you, the pain of his loss is with me every day, as it is with you, still sharp, still clear. But so is the pride I feel at his service, as if I can still hear him saying, \u2018It\u2019s my duty, Dad, it\u2019s my duty.\u2019 Duty \u2013 that was the code my son lived by, the creed all of you live by.\u201d He then pointed to his signing of the 2022 bipartisan PACT Act, which expanded health care benefits to millions of veterans who were exposed to burn pits, which were used to burn waste \u2014 including trash, munitions, hazardous material and chemical compounds \u2014 at military sites throughout Iraq and Afghanistan until about 2010. These massive open-air burn pits often operated at or near military bases and released dangerous toxins into the air that, upon exposure, may have caused short- and long-term health conditions, according to the Department of Veterans Affairs. \u201cI\u2019ve long said we have many obligations as a nation. But we only have one truly sacred obligation: To prepare those we send in to battle, to prepare and take care of them and their families when they come home, and when they don\u2019t,\u201d Biden said, before touting other bills helping veterans and their families signed by his administration. Biden was introduced by Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, who told the audience that while, \u201cOur arms and technology are the envy of the world \u2026 in the end, America\u2019s greatest strategic asset will always be our people.\u201d \u201cSo, let us always remember our fallen heroes \u2013 let us always strive to defend the democracy for which they fought and died. They did their duty, and we must too,\u201d Austin said. Before giving his annual Memorial Day Address, Biden participated in a wreath laying at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier and in the morning\u00a0hosted a breakfast in honor of Memorial Day with administration officials, military leadership, veterans and Gold Star family members. The president\u2019s remarks come just two days after he delivered the commencement address at West Point, where he pointed to the United States\u2019 role \u201cas the indispensable nation, the world\u2019s only superpower, and the leading democracy in the world.\u201d \u201cFrom the very beginning, nothing is guaranteed about our democracy in America,\u201d Biden told the graduating cadets. \u201cEvery generation has an obligation to defend it, to protect it, to preserve it, to choose it.\u00a0Now, it\u2019s your turn.\u201d It also comes as Biden prepares to travel to Normandy, France, in two weeks, where he\u2019s slated to mark the 80th\u00a0anniversary of D-Day where service members \u201cstormed the beaches of Normandy and liberated a continent and literally saved the world,\u201d he said Monday. The speech comes at the beginning of what is expected to be a busy period of campaigning ahead of the November election. Biden\u2019s opponent in that race, former President Donald Trump, marked Memorial Day in a Truth Social post in which he attacked E. Jean Carroll and the judges who have presided over his defamation, civil fraud and criminal hush money trials. \u201cHappy Memorial Day to All, including the Human Scum that is working so hard to destroy our Once Great Country,\u201d Trump said in the lengthy social media rant.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/27/politics/biden-memorial-day-address-arlington-national-cemetery/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/28/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_05_27_politics_trump-response-classified-documents-gag-order", "text": "Former President Donald Trump\u2019s attorneys asked a federal judge Monday to reject special counsel Jack Smith\u2019s request for a gag order in the classified documents case and to find the federal prosecutors who wrote the request in contempt. Smith\u2019s office\u00a0has requested\u00a0that the Florida judge overseeing the classified documents case, Aileen Cannon, place a gag order on the former president that would limit his ability to publicly talk about law enforcement that searched his Mar-a-Lago estate in 2022. Trump, the presumptive GOP nominee, has repeatedly and misleadingly criticized the FBI for having a policy in place around the use of deadly force during the search \u2013 as the bureau does with every warrant it executes. In a blistering court filing late on Memorial Day, attorneys for Trump said that the gag order request was an \u201cextraordinary, unprecedented, and unconstitutional censorship application\u201d to target Trump\u2019s speech as he runs for president. The special counsel \u201cimproperly asks the Court to impose an unconstitutional gag order on President Trump \u2026 based on vague and unsupported assertions about threats to law enforcement personnel whose names have been redacted from public filings and whose identities are already subject to a protective order,\u201d defense attorneys wrote. The attorneys also said that prosecutors, whome they referred to as \u201cself-appointed Thought Police,\u201d were \u201cseeking to condition President Trump\u2019s liberty on his compliance\u201d with their own views. Among the parts of the proposed gag order that Trump\u2019s attorneys most fiercely contested was Smith\u2019s request to incorporate the gag order into the former president\u2019s conditions of pre-trial release \u2013 meaning that a probation officer, not the judge, would decide whether Trump\u2019s comments constituted a violation. That structure would\u00a0\u201crequire the Probation Office and the Court to mediate disputes against a backdrop of potentially imprisoning a political opponent who is successfully defeating Smith\u2019s boss and preferred candidate,\u201d they wrote. Beyond rejecting the gag order request, Cannon should impose sanctions on \u201call government attorneys who participated in the decision to file the Motion,\u201d Trump\u2019s team said. The former president is separately under a gag order in the Washington, DC, federal election interference case and in his ongoinng hush money trial in New York state court. The special counsel said Friday that Trump\u2019s false claims had endangered law enforcement officers \u2013 some of whom could testify in the classified documents case.\u00a0His comments, prosecutors wrote, \u201cinvite the sort of threats and harassment that have occurred when other participants in legal proceedings against Trump have been targeted by his invective.\u201d Both the FBI and Attorney General Merrick Garland have rejected claims that the operation\u2019s plan to search Mar-a-Lago was somehow unique and that Trump\u2019s life, as the former president has claimed, was in danger. Garland last week called the allegation \u201cfalse\u201d and \u201cextremely dangerous,\u201d while the FBI said in a statement that \u201cno one ordered additional steps to be taken and there was no departure from the norm in this matter.\u201d Garland and the FBI have also noted that the same deadly force policy was included in plans before a search of President Joe Biden\u2019s Delaware home during a separate investigation into his own handling of classified documents.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/27/politics/trump-response-classified-documents-gag-order/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/28/2024", "section": "us"}}

They\u2019re going to come and massacre us.\u2019 We had nothing, no weapons, nothing to defend ourselves. That\u2019s the day we became refugees.\u201d On Wednesday, Zarqa joins millions of Palestinians across the world to mark Nakba Day with protests and community events intended to honor the memory of the Palestinians killed and displaced in 1948 and the brutal war unfolding today in Gaza. Part of that commemoration includes a commitment to storytelling, Zarqa says, whereby survivors of the Nakba generation continue to share their experiences with younger Palestinians so the dream of liberation and return never dies. He believes it\u2019s the only way to understand the current war and work toward a just and lasting peace in the region. \u201cMy heart is bleeding,\u201d he says softly. \u201cAt my age, I\u2019m still dreaming of going back home. Palestine is something that is still implanted in my heart and my body. It\u2019s where I was born. It\u2019s where I have my memories. It\u2019s my country.\u201d Yearning for home Zarqa, along with his parents and six siblings, fled Ein Karem on foot, taking very little with them. They walked from village to village, searching for food and sheltering in the homes and garages of kind strangers. The atrocities he witnessed along the way are seared in his memory. \u201cI saw the most horrific things in my life: women coming in with torn clothes and uncovered heads crying, screaming, saying that the Jews \u2013 they weren\u2019t called Israelis at the time \u2013 attacked their village and massacred everybody,\u201d Zarqa says. More than 15,000 Palestinians were killed and 531 towns and villages destroyed during al-Nakba, according to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics, an institute of the Palestinian Authority. Jewish leaders declared independence and the creation of the state of Israel on May 14, sparking a military response from Egypt, Syria and Jordan. The family hoped the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, as it would come to be known, would end in a swift victory for the Arabs. After several weeks, Zarqa\u2019s family returned to Ein Karem. But when they entered the village, they found it had been ransacked and its residents cast out by Jewish militias, Zarqa says. With nothing left to salvage, they fled to Jordan to wait out the war, he recalls. The family initially lived in squalor, surviving off the generosity of strangers and local mosques. They shared a home with other Palestinian refugees in Jabal Al Weibdeh, a neighborhood in Amman, Zarqa says. It had a dirt floor and there were no windows, doors or bathrooms. They often couldn\u2019t shower for months at a time. By March 1949, Israel had won the war and forbidden the hundreds of thousands of Palestinian refugees who had fled or were expelled from returning to their homes and ancestral lands. Zarqa\u2019s family was among them. The family began to build a new life in Jordan, one marked by struggle and poverty, as they patiently waited for permission to return to Ein Karem. But it never came, and decades later Zarqa found himself living in the United States \u2013 even further from his homeland \u2013 trying to raise a small family of his own. \u201cWe made a life in the US, but this still isn\u2019t home. You never forget that you had a house and somebody kicked you out of it,\u201d Zarqa says. \u201cWe will never stop wanting to return.\u201d A responsibility to teach Neither time nor distance has blurred Zarqa\u2019s memories of Palestine. He has passed onto his four children and eight grandchildren every bittersweet memory of Ein Karem, from its acres of orchards to the hilltop where he could see the mountains and Mediterranean sea in the distance. Zarqa remembers Ein Karem so vividly that despite his decades of absence, he was able to give his grandson, Zach Matari, who visited the village in 2019, directions over FaceTime to his old home, now in present-day Israel. An Israeli family is living there. \u201cI remember every inch of my village. If you go there I can tell you there was this apricot tree here, and there was a fig tree there, and that\u2019s the stairs we used to climb,\u201d he says. Jenan Matari, another one of his grandchildren, is a writer and social media influencer who uses her platform to educate followers about Palestinian history, culture and current events, including the war in Gaza. She loves listening to her grandfather\u2019s stories and says her work, which is rooted in his Nakba experience, is a form of resistance. All Palestinians in the diaspora, she says, should use their voices too. \u201cI get really sad for my grandfather, because if I\u2019m feeling triggered by the things that are happening in Gaza, and I\u2019m feeling this depleted and in so much pain watching this, I can only imagine what it\u2019s doing to him and his generation to watch what they lived through happening again, but on an even greater scale,\u201d Matari, 33, tells CNN. Talking about al-Nakba isn\u2019t easy, Zarqa confesses. He often pauses mid-sentence or changes the subject when it hurts a bit too much. But he refuses to be silenced by his grief and even invites other Nakba survivors to his home to share their experiences with family, friends and the wider community Dawud Assad, one of those survivors, lives just 10 miles away. He narrowly survived the Deir Yassin massacre, which he says claimed the lives of 47 family members, including his grandmother and 2-year-old brother. \u201cI was supposed to be dead,\u201d says Assad, who is now 92 and nicknamed Al-shaheed Al-hay, or \u201cthe living martyr.\u201d Assad survived by hiding in a shallow trench near his home, crouching and quietly praying for mercy as bullets grazed his hair. \u201cIt did not begin on October 7. What we went through is exactly what we\u2019re seeing now in Gaza and Rafah,\u201d Assad says, referring to Israel\u2019s ongoing war there. Videos of dead children are especially triggering because they remind him of his slain brother. Israel launched its war in Gaza after Hamas\u2019 brutal attack in Israel on October 7, in which 1,200 people were killed and hundreds of others taken hostage, Israeli officials say. In the seven months since that attack, Israel\u2019s bombing campaign and ground offensive in Gaza has killed more than 35,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health. It also has imposed a siege and razed entire communities, rendering nearly 90% of the population displaced and everyone food insecure. Israel says its military tactics are necessary to defeat Hamas and return the hostages. But in a March report for the United Nations\u2019 Human Rights Council, the UN Special Rapporteur on human rights in the Palestinian territories, Francesca Albanese, said there are \u201creasonable grounds\u201d to believe Israel is committing the crime of genocide against Palestinians in Gaza. Israel said it \u201cutterly rejects\u201d the report, which it said \u201cbrings shame\u201d on the council. For Zarqa and Assad, the war is reminiscent of the horrors they endured during al-Nakba, and it\u2019s important for them to draw that parallel for young Palestinians in the diaspora, as well as anyone else trying to make sense of the violence. \u201cAl-Nakba never ended,\u201d Zarqa says. They point to recent statements from Israeli officials that have alluded to another Nakba through suggestions of mass killing and displacement, or outright calling for it. In a November interview with Israel\u2019s Channel 12 news, Minister of Agriculture Avi Dichter described the war as \u201cthe Nakba of Gaza 2023.\u201d Following Dichter\u2019s comments, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reportedly urged ministers to choose their words more carefully. \u201cWe must be sensitive,\u201d he said, according to The Times of Israel. Hope for the future Zarqa\u2019s heart remains torn between nostalgia and grief as he concedes he may never again see his beloved Palestine, stroll through the quiet streets of Ein Karem or taste its delicious apricots. But he\u2019s sure his descendants will. There are some 5.9 million Palestinian refugees worldwide, most of them descendants of that 1948 generation of exiles, according to the United Nations. It is \u201cthe world\u2019s longest-standing protracted refugee crisis,\u201d the UN said at a 2023 event marking the 75th anniversary of al-Nakba as it urged a solution grounded in international law. While some countries, including the United States and United Kingdom, skipped the commemoration after Israel called for a boycott, Zarqa elsewhere sees hope: The anti-war protests taking over city streets and college campuses across the world. \u201cI am so proud of them,\u201d Zarqa says. \u201cYou pass on your stories to your children and then they carry the banner and continue to teach their children, and eventually their own grandchildren.\u201d \u201cPalestinians will never forget.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/us/nakba-day-anniversary-palestinians/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/28/2024", "section": "us"}}
