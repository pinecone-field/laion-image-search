{"id": "2024_06_06_us_near-collision-airport-runway-austin", "text": "A FedEx cargo plane trying to land and a Southwest Airlines jet trying to take off nearly collided on an airport runway last year because of an air traffic controller\u2019s faulty assumptions amid heavy fog, investigators with the National Transportation Safety Board said in a hearing Thursday. \u201cIt is an error.\u00a0We\u2019re all human,\u201d said NTSB chairwoman Jennifer Homendy.\u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s why you have technology to provide that extra layer of protection, not just in the tower but also in the cockpit of the airplane.\u201d The hearing concerned one of the country\u2019s closest near-collisions in years as heavy fog enveloped Austin-Bergstrom International Airport in February 2023. Air traffic controllers cleared the FedEx Boeing 767 to land on Runway 18 Left and had also approved the Southwest Airlines Boeing 737 jet to take off using the same runway, the NTSB said. The FedEx crew realized they were about to land on top of the Southwest plane and called for the Southwest crew to abort the takeoff. The FedEx crew then aborted their landing \u2013 averting what could have been a mass disaster. The incident came amid a sharp rise in \u201crunway incursions\u201d last year. The NTSB on Wednesday said that a near-collision between two planes at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York in January 2023 was caused by pilots who were repeatedly distracted in the cockpit. The Federal Aviation Administration responded to the string of incidents with additional controller training and a rare national safety summit.\u00a0There have been at least seven in that top category so far this year \u2013 classified in FAA nomenclature as level A or B. Of the 23 near-collisions last year, Austin was the closest. \u201cThis really could have ended up in catastrophe and the death of 133 people,\u201d Homendy told CNN after the board meeting. Air traffic controller had \u2018inaccurate mental model\u2019 The hearing on Thursday offered further details on the near-collision and recommendations for how to prevent such an incident going forward. The air traffic controller who had cleared both flights, Damian Campbell, later told NTSB investigators that he \u201ccouldn\u2019t see anything\u201d\u00a0on\u00a0the ground through the fog. The NTSB\u2019s new findings show that when the Southwest pilot radioed the tower, the controller \u201cnever determined the accurate position of the airplane\u201d prior to clearing\u00a0its\u00a0takeoff. His incorrect assumption was the Southwest plane could take off before an incoming FedEx jet landed on the same runway. However, taxiing and takeoff take longer in poor weather, and the Southwest plane sat on the runway for 19 seconds performing a procedure\u00a0that is\u00a0required under the weather conditions, the board said. The board concluded\u00a0the controller\u00a0used an \u201cinaccurate mental model\u201d and was biased in his past experience of Southwest pilots promptly departing when he assumed the Southwest jet could make it in time. Ultimately, the FedEx plane was between 150 and 175 feet away from landing atop the Southwest plane before anyone spotted potential disaster. A FedEx pilot said in an NTSB interview he saw the silhouette of the Southwest wing appear through the clouds and quickly pulled away. The weather in Austin that day was so foggy that the controller later told investigators he was listening for the Southwest plane\u2019s engines to know whether it had taken off.\u00a0After the FedEx pilot averted the collision, the controller issued instructions that suggested he believed the Southwest jet was still on the ground, a board member said. \u201cThat is not indicative of a safe aviation system,\u201d Homendy said. \u201cThat\u2019s not safety.\u201d The NTSB issued seven recommendations Thursday based on the Austin incident, including installing technology at all commercial airports to detect movement of planes and vehicles on the ground.\u00a0The technology is currently only in use at a few dozen airports. The NTSB called on the FAA to require pilots to report their position frequently when taxiing in limited visibility conditions. The board also revealed alarming conditions for the weather office at the Austin airport, although the members did not fault the observer on duty. The windowless weather office has no internet access and no cell phone service. And the office has an FAA-issued computer but no password to log on.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/06/us/near-collision-airport-runway-austin/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_07_business_senators-unitedhealth-patient-data-hack", "text": "A bipartisan pair of senators is accusing a major health care firm that suffered a crippling cyberattack in February of not complying with federal law that requires patients be notified when their data is stolen. In a letter sent to\u00a0UnitedHealth Group CEO Andrew Witty this week, New Hampshire Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan and Tennessee Republican Sen. Marsha Blackburn demanded that the health care giant \u201cassume full and immediate responsibility\u201d for giving patients and health providers information on the breach. Federal law known as the\u00a0Health Information Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) generally requires health care providers to notify people within 60 days of discovering a breach affecting their personal health data. The Department of Health and Human Services is already investigating whether UnitedHealth is compliant with HIPAA obligations to protect patient data. The department can\u2019t discuss ongoing investigations, an HHS spokesperson told CNN. HHS can use HIPAA to fine companies for failing to protect patient data. The department announced a $4.75 million settlement in February with a nonprofit hospital system in New York for \u201cdata security failures\u201d that the department said resulted in an employee stealing and selling patient data. But the cleanup from the ransomware attack on Change Healthcare, a UnitedHealth subsidiary, has been unusually messy and complicated compared to other ransomware attacks on the health sector. The hack paralyzed computers that Change Healthcare uses to process medical claims across the country. Health care providers were cut off from billions of dollars in payments, according to one hospital association, and some health clinics\u00a0were on the brink of bankruptcy\u00a0because they couldn\u2019t get paid. Witty told Congress last month that a third of Americans may have had their personal data stolen in the hack and that it would likely take \u201cseveral months\u201d before the company is able to identify and notify Americans who were affected. One reason for the lengthy notification process, he said, was that files on patients were compromised in the ransomware attack. In the aftermath of the hack, some health care providers were confused whether they or Change Healthcare were responsible for notifying patients that their data had been breached. On May 31, the HHS Office for Civil Rights clarified that health care providers can delegate that obligation to Change Healthcare. \u201cWe appreciate OCR\u2019s recent clarification that providers and other HIPAA covered entities can delegate their notice obligations to Change, which reiterated our previously stated preference to ease the reporting obligations of our customers,\u201d UnitedHealth spokesperson Eric Hausman\u00a0said in an emailed statement to CNN on Friday. \u201cAs a result, we are working with our customers to ensure the notification process meets their needs and satisfies legal obligations.\u201d The hack cast a spotlight on UnitedHealth\u2019s powerful role in the health care market. The company reported $371 billion in revenue last year. Change Healthcare handles one in three American patient records,\u00a0according\u00a0to the American Hospital Association. Optum, another UnitedHealth subsidiary, employs about 90,000 physicians. The UnitedHealth subsidiary hack, and\u00a0another\u00a0ransomware attack on one of the country\u2019s biggest hospital chains, has also increased pressure on Capitol Hill and in the White House to produce new regulations that require health care companies meet minimum cybersecurity standards. The Hassan-Blackburn letter is not the only inquiry that UnitedHealth faces in the Senate. Sen. Ron Wyden, the Oregon Democrat who chairs the finance committee, has called on the Federal Trade Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission to investigate UnitedHealth\u2019s cybersecurity practices. The FTC declined to comment, while an SEC spokesperson told CNN that the agency would respond directly to Wyden.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/07/business/senators-unitedhealth-patient-data-hack/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_01_15_us_gilgo-beach-murder-case-timeline", "text": "For more than a decade, a string of unsolved killings known as the Gilgo Beach murders terrorized residents and confounded authorities on Long Island\u2019s South Shore after a woman\u2019s 2010 disappearance led investigators to find 10\u00a0sets of human remains in addition to hers and launched\u00a0the hunt for a possible serial killer. Authorities announced a major breakthrough in the case last summer when they charged\u00a0New York architect Rex Heuermann with murder in the killings of three of the four women who became known as the \u201cGilgo Four.\u201d In January, Heuermann was charged with second-degree murder in the fourth killing, that of Maureen Brainard-Barnes, according to an indictment. Brainard-Barnes was 25 years old when she was last seen in July 2007. Her remains were found along the Long Island shoreline in 2010. Five months later, on Thursday, Heuermann, 60, was charged with second-degree murder in the 2003 death of Jessica Taylor and the 1993 death of Sandra Costilla, according to a bail application. Heuermann was taken into custody in July and indicted on one count of first-degree murder and one count of second-degree murder in each of the three killings of\u00a0Melissa Barthelemy in 2009, and Megan Waterman and Amber Costello in 2010, according to the Suffolk County District Attorney. Heuermann has pleaded not guilty to all charges and \u201chas maintained his innocence since day one,\u201d his attorney, Michael Brown, told reporters after the fourth charge was announced. Once Heuermann was identified as a suspect in early 2022, authorities said, they watched him and his family \u2013 getting DNA samples from items in their trash as they built a case. Here is a timeline of the Gilgo Beach killings, how the investigation unfolded and what ultimately led to Heuermann\u2019s arrest. 2010: Authorities find first remains in Gilgo Beach murders Police discovered the first set of female remains in bushes along an isolated strip of waterfront property on Gilgo Beach while searching for another missing woman: Shannan Gilbert, a 23-year-old from Jersey City, New Jersey who hadn\u2019t been seen since May 2010. The remains of Melissa Barthelemy, 24, were the first to be discovered in the case during the search on December 11, 2010, according to Suffolk County officials. Two days later, investigators discovered the remains of three additional victims \u2013 Maureen Brainard-Barnes, Amber Costello and Megan Waterman \u2013 strewn across a half-mile stretch on Gilgo Beach. The four women, who were wrapped in camouflaged burlap, worked as escorts who advertised on Craigslist and were last seen between July 2007 and September 2010, officials said. After Barthelemy\u2019s disappearance, authorities say her family received multiple taunting calls. In one of the calls, the suspect \u201cadmitted killing and sexually assaulting Ms. Barthelemy,\u201d according to a bail application filed by the Suffolk County district attorney after Heuermann\u2019s arrest. Those calls, authorities say, would later help unravel the case. 2011: More remains found, including a toddler and her mother Police said in January 2011 calls from Barthelemy\u2019s cell phone had been traced to midtown Manhattan, with the two last calls made from around Madison Square Garden and Times Square. The caller hung up too quickly for authorities to pinpoint the exact locations of the calls, police said. On March 29, 2011, the partial skeletal remains of another woman were found several miles east of where the bodies of the \u201cGilgo Four\u201d were discovered. The woman was first known as Jane Doe #5\u00a0before investigators identified her as Jessica Taylor, another escort whose partial remains were previously discovered in Manorville in 2003, police said. The following month, on April 4, 2011, three more sets of remains were found on a stretch of Ocean Parkway in Suffolk County near the beach. They included a female toddler, an unidentified Asian male and a woman initially referred to as Jane Doe #6, investigators said. One week later, two additional sets of human remains were found in Nassau County, about 40 miles east of New York City, one of which was identified as the mother of the toddler through DNA analysis. The mother\u2019s partial remains were first discovered in 1997, officials said. The other set of remains \u201cgenetically matched\u201d with remains found in 1996 on Fire Island, \u201csignificantly expanding the timeline and geographic reach\u201d of the investigation, officials said. In mid-April of the same year, Steve Cohen, an attorney for Barthelemy\u2019s mother, said a man using the victim\u2019s cell phone made taunting calls and claimed he killed Barthelemy,\u00a0CNN reported. \u201cDo you think you\u2019ll ever see her again?,\u201d the unidentified male caller asked Barthelemy\u2019s sister on August 26, 2009, according to Cohen. \u201cYou won\u2019t. I killed her,\u201d he added and hung up. The phone call ended after less than a minute, CNN reported at the time. Another phone call was placed in July 2009 just days after Barthelemy disappeared. It was the first of seven calls he made from Barthelemy\u2019s cell phone. Cohen said in the phone call, the unidentified male caller referred to Barthelemy as a \u201cwhore\u201d in a short conversation with her then-15-year-old sister, Cohen told CNN at the time. In the final call, the man described in graphic detail to the victim\u2019s sister what he had done sexually to Barthelemy, Cohen said. In December 2011, Gilbert\u2019s body\u00a0was found in the wooded marshes\u00a0of Suffolk County\u2019s Oak Beach. The beach is about 9 miles from where the 10 other sets of human remains were found. Authorities later said they believed Gilbert\u2019s death may have been accidental and not related to the Gilgo Beach slayings. 2020: Police release photos of a key clue and ID a victim In January 2020, Suffolk County police released photos of what it said could be a significant piece of evidence: a black leather belt embossed with the letters \u201cWH\u201d or \u201cHM.\u201d The department also launched a website to collect new tips in the investigation. \u201cWe believe the belt was handled by the suspect and did not belong to any of the victims,\u201d former Suffolk County Police Commissioner Geraldine Hart told reporters at the time. On May 28, 2020, New York\u2019s Suffolk County Police Department identified \u201cJane Doe #6\u201d as Valerie Mack, a 24-year-old Philadelphia mother who went missing two decades earlier. The FBI helped identify Mack\u2019s remains using advanced forensic DNA technology, officials said. Using samples from her remains, Suffolk County investigators were able to find Mack\u2019s biological relatives through genetic genealogy, which ultimately led to her adoptive family and son, Hart said to reporters at the time. 2022: Police form task force to find killer In February 2022, Suffolk County Police Commissioner Rodney Harrison formed a multiagency task force to investigate the Gilgo Beach killings. The task force included the Suffolk County Police Department, the Suffolk County Sheriff\u2019s Office, the New York State Police and the FBI. On March 14, 2022, Heuermann was first mentioned as a possible suspect in the Gilgo Beach murder case after a New York state investigator identified him in a database, according to Suffolk County District Attorney Ray Tierney. Investigators then started surveilling him and his family and took pieces of garbage to obtain DNA samples \u2013 even discarded pizza crust. As they closed in on Heuermann, investigators used cell tower records from thousands of possible individuals down to hundreds and then to a handful of people. Next, authorities focused on residents who also matched a physical description provided by a witness who had seen the suspected killer. Authorities zeroed in on anyone with a connection to a green pickup truck a witness had seen the suspect driving, according to two law enforcement sources with knowledge of the case. Later, authorities learned Heuermann drove a green pickup truck registered to his brother, CNN reported. Heuermann matched a witness\u2019s physical description, lived close to the Long Island cell site and worked near the New York City cell sites where other calls were captured. Personal cell phone and credit card billing records revealed numerous instances where Heuermann was in the general locations as burner phones, which authorities say he had with him at the killings. He used the phones to call the three victims and also used \u201cBrainard-Barnes and Barthelemy\u2019s cellphones when they were used to check voicemail and make taunting phone calls after the women disappeared,\u201d Suffolk County prosecutors allege. Authorities said a search of Heuermann\u2019s computer revealed he had scoured the internet at least 200 times for details about the status of the investigation, Tierney said. Heuermann was also compulsively searching for photos of the victims and their relatives, and he was trying to track down relatives, the district attorney said. In late 2022, detectives recovered a cup believed to have been discarded by Heuermann, but they could not get a good DNA sample from it, a law enforcement source close to the investigation told CNN. 2023: Rex Heuermann arrested in some of the killings In January 2023, investigators got a complete sample of Heuermann\u2019s DNA from leftover crust in a pizza box he threw in the trash, a law enforcement source close to the investigation told CNN. During the initial examination of one of the victims\u2019 skeletal remains and materials discovered in the grave, the Suffolk County Crime Laboratory recovered a male hair from the \u201cbottom of the burlap\u201d the killer used to wrap her body, according to prosecutors. Analysis of the DNA found on the victim and the pizza thrown out by Heuermann showed the samples matched. Additionally, hair believed to be from Heuermann\u2019s wife was found on or near three of the murder victims, prosecutors allege in the bail application, citing DNA testing. The DNA came from 11 bottles inside a garbage can outside the Heuermann home, the court document says. On July 13, 2023, a suspect connected to some of the Gilgo Beach murders was taken into custody in New York City, marking the first arrest in the case, according to Harrison. He was transported back to Suffolk County Police headquarters in the hamlet of Yaphank on Long Island, the police commissioner said. A day later, authorities identified the suspect as Heuermann, a registered architect who has owned the New York City-based architecture and consulting firm, RH Consultants & Associates, since 1994, according to his company\u2019s website. The case against Heuermann came together over two years with the restart of the investigation, in which investigators used \u201cthe power of the grand jury,\u201d including more than 300 subpoenas and search warrants, to collect evidence and tie Heuermann conclusively to the murders, Tierney said during a news conference. 2024: Charged in 6 deaths over 3 decades Huermann is indicted on two new murder charges on Thursday, with authorities saying their investigation is far from over. He pleaded not guilty. Taylor\u2019s remains were discovered in Manorville in 2003 and then additional remains along Ocean Parkway on Gilgo Beach in 2011. A hair found underneath Taylor\u2019s remains was linked to Heuermann, according to the bail application. Costilla\u2019s remains were found in North Sea in 1993 by two hunters who were in the woods, according to the bail application. \u201cDefendant Heuermann is the individual who murdered, stripped, restrained, and transported the remains of Jessica Taylor and Sandra Costilla, as well as the Gilgo Four, until they were each discovered in 1993, 2003, 2010, and 2011,\u201d the bail application reads.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/01/15/us/gilgo-beach-murder-case-timeline/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "us"}}

Mark Walztoni tells CNN his 17-year-old daughter Cobalt Sovereign, a junior at Hopkins High School in Minnetonka, was in the school bathroom last\u00a0Thursday\u00a0when\u00a0a student started calling her\u00a0transphobic slurs. While she was leaving the bathroom, Walztoni says his daughter\u00a0said\u00a0that she was surrounded by\u00a0that student and two others, who began following Sovereign down the hall, and when she turned around to ask them to stop, she was\u00a0punched in the mouth. During the attack, according to Walztoni, Sovereign\u2019s jaw was broken in two places. She had a compound fracture and lost teeth, leading to reconstructive surgery. Walztoni says the students\u00a0responsible\u00a0should face criminal charges. \u201cThere has to be repercussions for their actions. And if they are not charged for some reason, which is our fear, then that is just going to further escalate their behavior because when you get away with stuff, you continue to do stuff,\u201d he said. \u201cThere needs to be some kind of punishment and there needs to be some serious discussion as to whether those kids should be able to come back to the same school.\u201d He also says\u00a0he\u00a0was notified about the incident from a social worker at the school and was told by school officials to notify the police, adding that he was displeased the incident \u201cwasn\u2019t treated as an emergency.\u201d The Minnetonka Police Department said in a statement to CNN\u00a0that it is investigating an\u00a0attack\u00a0that day at Hopkins High School as \u201ca possible hate\u00a0crime,\u201d but said \u201cdetails remain limited as the case was reported to police after school had ended for the day.\u201d\u00a0Hopkins High School\u00a0said it is investigating \u201can act of violence\u201d\u00a0that \u201cinvolved a student who identifies as part of the LGBTQ+ community.\u201d  \u201cWe will address any issues that compromise the safety and inclusivity of our school environment,\u201d the school told CNN in a statement. \u201cWe support and stand by any group that is marginalized, including our LGBTQ+ scholars and staff.\u201d Minnetonka Police Chief Scott Boerboom tells CNN Sovereign\u2019s mother reported the incident to the police department\u00a0the day it happened\u00a0and he was not made aware of it until the following Monday. Boerboom says he would have preferred the school notify the police as soon as the incident occurred. \u201cWe would arrive at the school, we would meet with the victim, Cobalt, we would talk to the suspects, identify the suspects, get their side of the story, talk to the victim. And then we are required to notify parents at that time,\u201d he said. \u201cBy having us contacted at the onset, we can assess it as first responders and we have access to EMS or medical services.\u201d Boerboom also says that a video of the assault exists, and he has seen it. He says his department filed a subpoena for the video from the school, in line with policy. In the video, he says, one boy is seen assaulting Sovereign in the hallway. There were two other boys nearby, Boerboom says, who were not involved in the physical assault. The\u00a0attack comes amid a rise in\u00a0anti-LGBTQ\u00a0legislation\u00a0and as advocates say LGBTQ students have faced an uptick in threats and violence. It also comes nearly four months after the\u00a0death of Nex Benedict, a nonbinary\u00a010th grader in Oklahoma who told\u00a0police about being beaten to the point of blacking out during a confrontation in the school bathroom.\u00a0 Melanie Willingham-Jaggers, executive director of GLSEN, a non-profit\u00a0group that works to end intolerance and homophobia in\u00a0K-12\u00a0schools, said the\u00a0attack is \u201ca heartbreaking reminder of the violence and discrimination that trans youth face daily.\u201d \u201cGLSEN\u00a0stands in solidarity with Cobalt and their family, and we call on their school officials to take immediate, concrete steps to ensure the safety and dignity of all students,\u201d Willingham-Jaggers told CNN in a statement. \u201cHate has no place in our schools, and it\u2019s our collective responsibility to create systems where every student can thrive without fear.\u201d Minnesota state Rep. Leigh Finke, a Democrat and the first\u00a0out\u00a0transgender lawmaker in the state\u2019s legislature, condemned the school and police\u00a0for their\u00a0responses\u00a0to the incident. Finke said violence\u00a0against transgender youth like Benedict and Sovereign will \u201ccontinue unabated until accountability and responsibility is accepted.\u201d \u201cThe response of Hopkins High School and the Minnetonka Police so far sends the same transphobic message to\u00a0(\u2026)\u00a0the world: do as you will and if no one decides to take it public, you\u2019ll get away with it. Is that the message that we want to send?\u201d Finke said in a statement. \u201cWe want to see Hopkins High School and Minnetonka Police, and every school and police department in the future to do what is right and take immediate action, not because people are looking, but because transgender folks everywhere are entitled to live a life free of fear, and violence,\u201d Finke added.

The case regarding Google\u2019s advertising technology is the first antitrust suit against a Big Tech company brought by the Biden administration. US District Judge Leonie Brinkema\u2019s decision on Friday is a setback for the Justice Department, which sought a jury trial for the case. The DOJ and multiple states have alleged in the ad-tech case that Google bulldozed rivals through anticompetitive mergers and bullied publishers and advertisers into using the company\u2019s proprietary ad technology products. Brinkema ruled in Google\u2019s favor after the tech company argued that the check \u2014 for $2.3 million, according to a Google spokesperson \u2014 settled the government\u2019s claim for damages and that a jury was no longer needed to try the case.

{"id": "2024_06_07_us_california-confirms-woman-killed-last-winter-was-states-first-fatal-black-bear-attack", "text": "A woman\u2019s death in Sierra County has been confirmed as the first documented fatal attack by a black bear on a human in California history, according to officials. Patrice Miller, 71, was found dead in her Downieville home last November, but a recently released autopsy report by California\u2019s Department of Fish and Wildlife has verified she was killed by a bear, the Sierra County Sheriff\u2019s department said. A sheriff\u2019s deputy discovered Miller deceased in her home while conducting a welfare check after a grocery store employee reported that she had not been seen or heard from for several days, according to Sheriff Michael Fisher. The sheriff\u2019s office said when they found Miller, there were clear signs a bear had been inside the house. But officials believed Miller had died of natural causes and the bear broke into the house after her death and had been feeding on her remains. The bear was eventually trapped and euthanized, the sheriff said. However, a recently released autopsy revealed that Miller did not die of natural causes but had in fact been killed by the bear, the sheriff said. \u201cPost investigation, we found out that she had been having some bear issues at the house. And after we concluded our coroner\u2019s investigation and removed her remains from the house, the bear continued to break into the house over and over again over the next several days,\u201d Fisher added. The sheriff said further investigation revealed bears had been prowling around Miller\u2019s house for some time because she would leave cat food on the front porch for her cats and there was garbage around the home as well. Miller\u2019s daughter also told authorities that one particular bear would come to the house quite often and her mother had put bars on the windows to keep the bear away. \u201cIt\u2019s a big deal. That doesn\u2019t happen in California. Normally a bear is going to stay away from you, a bear that hasn\u2019t been normalized to human behavior,\u201d Steve Gonzalez with the fish and wildlife department told CNN affiliate KCRA. Last month, there had been reports of another bear breaking into homes in the mountain community. That bear has also been euthanized, the sheriff said. Fisher said that bears are seen around the area regularly, but usually they\u2019re rummaging through garbage or breaking into cars for food, and flee when they see a human. \u201cWe deal with bears on a weekly basis through spring, summer and fall and 99.9% of those animals are not a public safety (issue).

{"id": "2023_07_16_us_rex-heuermann-gilgo-beach-murders-capture", "text": "Rex Heuermann left his office near the Empire State Building and strolled down a still-bustling Fifth Avenue as the sun set on a hot Thursday evening in Manhattan. The architect, whose customers included Catholic Charities, American Airlines and other tenants at John F. Kennedy International Airport, is seen in video obtained by CNN affiliate WABC walking calmly at the end of a work day.  A bag was slung over his shoulder, his left hand in his pocket, when he\u2019s approached last July 13 by several men in dark suits and ties.  Tall and heavyset, Heuermann towered over the law enforcement officers who now surrounded him. As passersby strolled leisurely along the avenue, he was taken into custody without incident in connection with a 13-year homicide investigation involving young female victims on the South Shore of Long Island who worked as escorts. \u201cYes, the day has finally come when someone so \u2026 depraved of heart who would kill individuals, innocent individuals in the prime of their lives, their young lives, is finally brought to justice,\u201d New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said. \u201cWe are hoping that this will bring justice to this individual but also peace to the families.\u201d That day came \u2013 finally \u2013 years after a bestselling nonfiction book, a Netflix drama, and a podcast about a long-running murder mystery that made national headlines and become known as the Gilgo Beach killings.  Heuermann was initially charged with three counts of first-degree murder for the killings of Melissa Barthelemy in 2009, and Megan Waterman and Amber Costello the following year, according to the Suffolk County District Attorney. The alleged killer had been living a double life in a Long Island village a short drive from where their remains were found, prosecutors said. Heuermann, who told his attorney he\u2019s not the killer, was also the prime suspect in the 2007 disappearance and death of a fourth woman, Maureen Brainard-Barnes, according to a bail application from Suffolk County prosecutors. In January, he was charged with the murder of Brainard-Barnes, who was 25 years when she was last seen. He pleaded not guilty in that case.  Heuermann, 60, was indicted on two new murder charges Thursday: second-degree murder in the 2003 death of Jessica Taylor and the 1993 death of Sandra Costilla, according to a bail application. Taylor\u2019s remains were discovered in Manorville in 2003 and then additional remains along Ocean Parkway on Gilgo Beach in 2011. Costilla\u2019s remains were found in North Sea in 1993 by two hunters who were in the woods, according to the bail application. The four victims whose remains were found along Ocean Parkway from 2007 to 2010 became known as the \u201cGilgo Four.\u201d The day after his arrest, July 14, Heuermann was ordered held without bail after pleading not guilty during a first court appearance. Heuermann was in tears following his arrest. \u201cI did not do this,\u201d his court appointed attorney, Michael Brown, said his client told him.  A crucial break in the case came in January when investigators took a swab from leftover pizza crust Heuermann discarded in the trash outside his Manhattan office, according to the bail application. DNA evidence linked him to a hair found on the burlap sack where Waterman\u2019s remains were found. Living a double life The son of an aerospace engineer, Heuermann lived with his spouse and children in the homey village of Massapequa Park, across the bay from where the remains were found, on the southeastern edge of Nassau County. In a video interview posted online by Bonjour Realty in 2022, as police in Suffolk County formed a multiagency task force to investigate the long-dormant cases, Heuermann said he was born and raised on Long Island. He had been working as an architectural consultant in Manhattan since 1987. \u201cI do troubleshooting, architectural troubleshooting, and negotiations with the building department,\u201d Heuermann said.  \u201cWhen a job that should have been routine suddenly becomes not routine, I get the phone call,\u201d he added. His father had built satellites for a living, Heuermann told the interviewer. His dad also built furniture in a workshop in the house Heuermann grew up in and still lived with his family. Asked what his job taught him about himself, Heuermann said: \u201cI think it\u2019s taught me more about how to understand people. Dealing with the technical aspects is something a person can learn \u2026 But it\u2019s the people, how they\u2019re all so different and how you deal with the people, I think, is one of the more interesting aspects that has come out of this.\u201d  RH Consultants & Associates was founded by Heuermann and incorporated in 1994, according to the company website. At the end of his online video, Heuermann put on a pair of sunglasses and posed for a selfie with his interviewer. \u201cCan you smile?\u201d Heuermann was asked. \u201cThat is,\u201d he replied, indicating he was smiling. Piecing together a complex puzzle It took investigators nearly 15 years to track down Heuermann. They first connected him to the killings in 2022 while conducting a review of evidence under a newly formed task force, which included the Suffolk County Police Department, the Suffolk County Sheriff\u2019s Office, the New York State Police and the FBI. In March 2022, investigators found a first-generation Chevrolet Avalanche \u2013 the same type of truck a witness believed to have been driven by Costello\u2019s killer \u2013 registered to Heuermann at the time of the murders, according to the bail application. Armed with more than 300 subpoenas and search warrants, investigators began to close in on their suspect.  Evidence revealed the killer had used burner phones to contact victims. Investigators found calls to the victims originated from locations connected to Heuermann.  Investigators said they narrowed cell tower records from thousands of possible individuals down to hundreds and then to a handful of people. They focused on residents who matched a physical description provided by a witness who had seen the killer. Task force members also learned Heuermann lived close to one Long Island cell site and worked near New York City cell sites where other calls originated. A series of \u201ctaunting\u201d calls in which a male caller admitted killing and sexually assaulting Barthelemy were made from her phone to her family members from the vicinity of Heuermann\u2019s midtown Manhattan office during the summer of 2009, according to the bail application. Heuermann also used burner phones to contact sex workers or massage parlors, the bail application said. And he created false names for an email account used to search for \u201csex workers, sadistic, torture-related pornography and child pornography,\u201d the bail application said.  One fictitious email account was used to send selfies \u201cto solicit and arrange for sexual activity.\u201d Another was used to search for podcasts and documentaries about the investigation, as well as \u201cimages depicting the murdered victims and members of their immediate families,\u201d according to the bail application. Between March 2022 and June 2023, Heuermann used the same account to conduct more than 200 searches about serial killers and articles about the task force investigating the Gilgo Beach killings, the bail application said. A rag a bone and a hank of hair A key break in the case came when investigators recovered Heuermann\u2019s DNA from pizza crust in a crumpled box he discarded in a Manhattan trash can in January 2023. The initial examination of Waterman\u2019s skeletal remains turned up a male hair from the \u201cbottom of the burlap\u201d the killer used to wrap her body, according to prosecutors. Analysis of DNA found on the victim and the pizza showed the samples matched. Additionally, hair believed to be from Heuermann\u2019s wife was found on or near three of the murder victims, according to the bail application. The DNA was collected from bottles inside a garbage can outside the Heuermann home.  The hairs were found in 2010 and had degraded. DNA testing at the time yielded no results but recent mitochondrial DNA testing allowed investigators to make the connection, according to Tierney. Heuermann\u2019s wife and children were out of the state when the three women are believed to have been killed, Tierney said. Investigators said his wife\u2019s hair may have been transferred to the victims from his clothing. His wife, Asa Ellerup, likely did not know about his life as an alleged killer, said Suffolk County Police Commissioner Rodney Harrison. \u201cIf you ask me, I don\u2019t believe that they knew about this double life that Mr. Heuermann was living,\u201d Harrison said of the suspect\u2019s family. But authorities were not ruling anything out and were continuing to collect information on what the family might have known, Harrison said after the arrest. Ellerup had filed for divorce from her husband of 27 years, her attorney Robert Macedonio told CNN last year. Authorities, fearing the Heuermann might be tipped off they were closing in, moved to arrest him. \u201cWe were playing before a party of one,\u201d Tierney told reporters. \u201cWe knew the person responsible for these murders would be looking at us.\u201d Seeking closure The case started with the search for a missing woman in 2010, leading to the discovery of multiple sets of human remains at Gilgo Beach. By the time the remains of the missing woman, Shannan Gilbert, were found one year later, at least 10 sets of human remains had been recovered across two Long Island counties.  Tierney had said last year the work of the task force was not over. \u201cThere are a lot of other victims, you know, in that area,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cThere are a lot of victim\u2019s families that want closure. So that\u2019s what you work towards.\u201d Authorities believe the death of Gilbert, whose disappearance sparked discovery of the other victims, may have been accidental and not related to the other killings. The remains of the Gilgo Four were found in bushes along a quarter-mile stretch of Ocean Parkway over a two-day period in 2010. The skeletal remains of Barthelemy were discovered near Gilgo Beach on December 11. Barthelemy, who was a sex worker, was last seen July 12, 2009, at her apartment when she told a friend she was going to see a man, according to a Suffolk County website about the killings. The remains of three other women were found on December 13, 2010: Brainard-Barnes, who advertised escort services on Craigslist and was last seen in early June 2007 in New York City; Amber Lynn Costello, who also advertised escort services and was last seen leaving her North Babylon home in early September 2010; and Waterman, who also advertised as an escort and was last seen in early June 2010 at a Holiday Inn Express in Hauppauge. Heuermann was surprised when he was surrounded by officers and taken into custody near his office on the evening of July 13, according to Tierney. When Heuermann was being processed at the jail, he had just one question about his arrest. According to a source, he said, \u201cIs it in the news?\u201d Speaking of the arrest, Harrison said last year: \u201cRex Heuermann is a demon that walks among us. A predator that ruined families. If not for the members of this task force, he would still be on the streets today.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/07/16/us/rex-heuermann-gilgo-beach-murders-capture/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_07_politics_us-pier-gaza-resume-operations", "text": "The US military\u2019s temporary pier off the coast of Gaza\u00a0was\u00a0repaired and\u00a0reattached to the beach on Friday morning, after\u00a0breaking apart and\u00a0sustaining damage\u00a0in heavy seas\u00a0last week, the deputy commander of US Central Command said on Friday. \u201cI\u2019m very pleased to announce that earlier this morning, in Gaza, US forces successfully attached the temporary pier to the Gaza beach. Israeli Defense Force engineers provided all the necessary support to ensure the safe emplacement of the pier to the beach,\u201d Vice Adm. Brad Cooper told reporters on Friday. \u201cThe policy of no US boots on the ground does remain in effect. We expect to resume delivery of humanitarian assistance from the sea in the coming days.\u201d Earlier on Friday, a US defense official said the pier,\u00a0which was constructed by the US military\u00a0to transport aid\u00a0into Gaza,\u00a0is expected to resume\u00a0operations as soon as Friday with aid distribution resuming within the next day assuming all goes to plan. \u201cWe anticipate that our goal will be to deliver 500,000 pounds over the beach initially and then ramp that up soon thereafter,\u201d Cooper added. A USAID spokesperson said Friday that the agency \u201cremains in close contact with our colleagues from across the US government and humanitarian partners on the ground to ensure that aid can safely and effectively resume movement, which we expect in the coming days.\u201d The pier broke apart and sustained damage in heavy seas\u00a0last week in a major blow to the American-led effort to create a maritime corridor for humanitarian supplies into the war-torn enclave. The pier\u00a0is the result of\u00a0months of work by US officials trying to come up with a way to get aid into Gaza in addition to\u00a0dropping it out of planes or trucking it through border checkpoints Even\u00a0though\u00a0it was operational for only about a week, the pier helped deliver some 1,000 metric tons of aid into Gaza before breaking apart. The temporary pier, called the Joint Logistics Over the Shore (JLOTS), requires very good sea\u00a0conditions\u00a0to operate. It was anticipated to cost roughly $320 million and had only begun operating on May 17; officials have since said the cost is now closer to $230 million. Cooper emphasized Friday that the damage to the pier stemmed \u201csolely from unanticipated weather,\u201d and that the military will continue to look at the weather closely going forward. The JLOTS system consists of two parts: the floating pier where shipments will be offloaded and the causeway to transfer the shipments to the distribution point in Gaza. The damage last week came after significant obstacles on distribution routes including Hamas drones and looting that delayed the deliveries. As a result, the US\u00a0military\u00a0had to help USAID come up with alternative, safer routes for trucks leaving the marshaling area on the beach near the pier and traveling to the warehouses. Before then, the US had faced\u00a0a number of challenges\u00a0with the pier, including planning around Israel\u2019s operations in Rafah; establishing who would transport the aid from the pier into Gaza; and logistical challenges such as sea and weather conditions. The pier\u2019s construction came as the humanitarian situation in Gaza deteriorates and the death toll from Israel\u2019s bombardment climbs. In Gaza, the entire population has faced food insecurity. The US has made a number of air drops of humanitarian aid into Gaza in partnership with the Royal Jordanian Air Force, though they were suspended in recent weeks due to military operations in the north of Gaza, Cooper said Friday. Air drops are expected to resume \u201cin the coming days,\u201d he said. The USAID spokesperson said the maritime corridor is \u201cjust one of several entry points for life-saving aid arriving into Gaza, including critical land crossings.\u201d \u201cWe continue to push for all entry points into Gaza to remain predictably functional at maximum capacity, and that internal access be improved so that aid can reach people in desperate need,\u201d the spokesperson said. Along with food, Chris Mewett, the\u00a0deputy assistant secretary of defense for global partnerships,\u00a0told reporters Friday that there are other forms of aid being delivered over the pier. \u201cI think everyone recognizes that food is just one component \u2014 shelter, medical care, etc.,\u201d Mewett said. US officials previously told CNN the US military is likely to operate the pier for at least three months, but the ultimate goal is to turn it into a full-time commercial operation that can be used by other countries and non-governmental organizations.

{"id": "2024_06_07_us_south-carolina-cold-case-charges-dismissed", "text": "Murder charges against Victor Lee Turner and Megan Renee Turner,\u00a0who were arrested in January\u00a0and charged in the 1989 cold case death of Justin Lee Turner, Victor\u2019s son, were dropped Friday by a South Carolina judge who questioned the viability of evidence in the case. The  father and stepmother were charged roughly 35 years after the body of the 5-year-old boy was found near his family\u2019s residence, CNN previously reported. Circuit Judge Roger Young ruled the original detective in the case changed his interpretations of the evidence, and with more than 20 witnesses either dead or unable to testify, the couple couldn\u2019t put up a fair defense and question witnesses who claimed they made incriminating statements, The Associated Press reported. The judge barred prosecutors from ever charging the couple again, according to the AP. Speaking outside court following the dismissal of charges, the Turners professed their innocence. \u201cI\u2019m glad it\u2019s over with,\u201d Victor Turner said. \u201cI\u2019m still sad about it. That\u2019s all I can say about it right now, but I can hold my head up a little bit.\u201d \u201cWe didn\u2019t do it,\u201d Megan Turner said. Young, in his ruling, said, \u201cThis is a circumstantial evidence (case) which depends on part on supposedly incriminating statements made to third persons. Unavailability of those witnesses for cross examination would be highly prejudicial to the defense,\u201d according to the AP.  The detective who investigated the case in 1989 was rehired by the Berkeley County Sheriff\u2019s Office in 2021 to review cold cases. \u201cJudge Young has upheld the oath of his office by following the law,\u201d the Ninth Circuit Solicitor\u2019s Office said in a statement. \u201cAs the testimony at the motions hearing revealed, the time that has passed since this despicable crime has resulted in witness testimony and evidence that is now unavailable. Furthermore, mistakes that were made 35 years ago could not be remedied.\u201d An affidavit provided to CNN by the Berkeley County Sheriff\u2019s\u00a0Office in January said the Turners, of Cross Hill, falsely reported their son missing on March 3, claiming he never got off the school bus. Witnesses, however, confirmed the child was never on the bus, nor was he in attendance at school that day, their affidavits show. Ultimately, the investigation determined the Turners were the \u201clast and only persons\u201d to have seen their son alive and interact with him before his death, the documents released earlier this year said. \u201cThis is not the outcome we were seeking; however, we understand the technicality of prosecuting cases from crimes that occurred years ago,\u201d Berkeley County Sheriff Duane Lewis said Friday in a statement. The family of Justin Turner, while asking for privacy, said the justice system failed. \u201cBased off the overwhelming evidence, the ones responsible for Justin\u2019s death had the chance to face justice here, but instead chose to stay silent and face the final justice handed out by God for eternity!

Over the course of his career, he hit 660 home runs and had 3,283 hits in 23 MLB seasons, mostly with the New York Giants. He\u2019s also remembered for making \u201cThe Catch,\u201d an over-the-shoulder grab in Game 1 of the 1954 World Series \u2013 one of the best defensive plays of all time. \u201cThe Say Hey Kid\u201d had something to say about his experience as a teenager with the Negro American League\u2019s Birmingham Black Barons. His 10 hits with the Barons now count, bumping his career hit total to 3,293 \u2013 good for 12th on the all-time hits list. \u201cI was still in high school,\u201d when he joined the team in 1948, Mays told CNN. \u201cOur school did not have a baseball team. I played football and basketball, but I loved baseball.\u00a0So my dad let me to play \u2026 but ONLY if I stayed in school. He wanted me to graduate. I played with the team on weekends until school was out for the summer.\u201d \u201cI thought that was IT; that was the top of the world. Man, I was so proud to play with those guys,\u201d Mays said in the statement. The New York Giants purchased Mays\u2019 contract in 1950 \u2013 three years after Jackie Robinson broke baseball\u2019s color barrier \u2013 and the next season his stellar MLB career began. As a result of the MLB incorporating the statistics of former\u00a0Negro Leagues players into its historical records on its website, legendary leaders in some categories like Babe Ruth and Ty Cobb have now been replaced in the record books by players who were not allowed to play on the same fields as them during segregation. Josh Gibson, one of the greatest sluggers in the history of the Negro Leagues, is now listed as MLB\u2019s all-time career leader in batting average at .372, moving ahead of Cobb at .367. The MLB website shows Gibson also overtaking Ruth in career slugging percentage. The MLB\u2019s action added over 2,300 Negro League players from 1920-1948 to its database. \u201cI\u2019m glad that all the guys who played are getting credit for their hits, because those pitchers were good,\u201d Mays said, mentioning Satchel Paige, considered one of baseball\u2019s greatest pitchers and who is now ranked third place all-time for earned run average in a single season with his performance in 1944 for the Kansas City Monarchs of the Negro American League.

Menendez and his wife, Nadine, along with New Jersey businessmen Wael Hana and Fred Daibes, are accused of engaging in a bribery scheme and acting as foreign agents for the Egyptian government. All four have pleaded not guilty. Nadine Menendez will be tried separately this summer. Uribe said Friday that he bribed the senator \u201cwith other people\u201d before identifying Hana in the courtroom. Uribe said he \u201cprovided\u201d a car for Nadine Menendez in order to use \u201cthe power and influence\u201d of her husband to help him get a \u201cbetter resolution\u201d for one of his associates, who was being charged in a criminal matter.\u00a0That associate was Elvis Parra, who had been indicted on insurance fraud charges. Prosecutors allege that in exchange for that car, Bob Menendez agreed to attempt to influence\u00a0the\u00a0New Jersey state criminal prosecution and another related investigation. Former New Jersey Attorney General\u00a0Gurbir Grewal testified earlier this week about a phone call and a meeting with the senator, who, he said, brought up the case against Parra. But Grewal said he was not directly asked to get involved.\u00a0He also said the senator never explicitly named any defendants in the case he expressed concern about.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/07/politics/bob-menendez-bribery-trial/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_07_us_911-dispatcher-pennsylvania", "text": "Prosecutors this week dropped an involuntary manslaughter case against a 911 dispatcher in Pennsylvania who had been accused of failing to send an ambulance to the rural home of a woman who was found dead a day later of internal bleeding. Greene County District Attorney Brianna Vanata said she acted to end the\u00a0case against Leon \u201cLee\u201d Price\u00a0after reviewing an investigator\u2019s report that said he felt charges were not justified in the July 2020 death of 54-year-old Diania Kronk. \u201cThere was just no criminal culpability here,\u201d Vanata said in a phone interview Thursday. She said the decision to pursue charges two years after Kronk died \u2014 and shortly after her family filed a lawsuit over it \u2014 was a mistake by the then-district attorney, Dave Russo. \u201cI\u2019m not sure what the previous district attorney was thinking,\u201d Vanata said. \u201cThat\u2019s where I\u2019m at.\u201d Price\u2019s defense lawyer, Timothy Ross, said Thursday the charges had been a stressful ordeal for his client, who he described as an upstanding employee who had consistently maintained he was innocent of the allegations. In the wake of Kronk\u2019s death, Ross said, an investigator had told Price he would not be charged. Ross said Price is \u201cmoving forward, rebuilding his reputation in this community and just happy to put these charges behind him.\u201d Investigators had said Price was reluctant to dispatch help without getting more assurances Kronk would actually go to the hospital. Vanata said she based her decision on an August 2020 memo by Greene County Regional Police Chief Zachary Sams that said Price may not have been trained properly and the investigator felt Price\u2019s actions did not \u201crise to the levels necessary to facilitate a criminal charge.\u201d On a recording, Price was heard questioning Kronk\u2019s daughter, Kelly Titchenell, for about four minutes. As Titchenell described her mother\u2019s condition, Price asked if Kronk was \u201cwilling to go\u201d to the hospital about a half-hour away from her home in Sycamore. Titchenell assured him she would and said she was concerned her mother might die. Titchenell told the dispatcher Kronk had been drinking heavily for some weeks, she had been losing weight and appeared to be turning yellow. Price said he would send an ambulance but then added that \u201cwe really need to make sure she\u2019s willing to go.\u201d Price asked Titchenell to call once she got to Kronk\u2019s home, but Titchenell said she could not find her mother\u2019s landline and there was no cell service. Titchenell said that when she got to Kronk\u2019s home, her mother was nude on the porch and talking incoherently, telling her repeatedly she was OK. Titchenell said an autopsy attributed Kronk\u2019s death to internal bleeding. Titchenell did not call 911 again on her way home, believing that her uncle would soon check on her mother. The uncle discovered the next day that Kronk had died. Russo defended the charges on Thursday, saying there was ample evidence and called Vanata\u2019s move to drop the case a political decision. Russo said the involuntary manslaughter charge had survived previous efforts by the defense to have it dismissed. At Vanata\u2019s request, a judge withdrew the charges on Monday. Jury selection and trial had been scheduled for next week. Vanata said she approached Price about a potential plea bargain to a lesser charge but he did not take the deal. Titchenell questions the decision to drop charges. \u201cI feel that there was too much for the new district attorney to go through,\u201d Titchenell said in a phone interview Wednesday. \u201cShe would have had to put in a lot of time and work to understand this case, to go over everything. I feel there was too much for her, so she was trying to basically get away without going to trial.\u201d Vanata, who beat Russo in the\u00a02023 GOP\u00a0primary by 44 percentage points, said she spent \u201cmany, many hours\u201d going through the evidence since taking office in January. \u201cIt definitely was not an easy decision to come to.\u201d Price is no longer a dispatcher and now works for Greene County in maintenance. \u201cMr. Price did lose his job and this, I\u2019m sure, has been an ordeal for him,\u201d Vanata said. \u201cBut also I feel so horrible for the family that had to go through this as well. It dragged them along for four years also.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/07/us/911-dispatcher-pennsylvania/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_07_us_philadelphia-drag-story-time-world-record", "text": "An LGBTQ+ publication in Philadelphia has claimed the record for the largest attendance at a drag queen story time reading, according to Guinness World Records. Drag queens read books to\u00a0263 people at the city\u2019s National Constitution Center last Saturday during an event hosted by the Philadelphia Gay News and sponsored by tourism agency Visit Philadelphia, according to Guinness and the organizers. \u201cConsidering  the fact that there are so many negative pieces of legislation in  various states, primarily against the trans community and drag  community, we thought it was very important that Philadelphia  showed\u00a0(it) is quite different than all those other places,\u201d said Mark  Segal, founder and publisher of the Philadelphia Gay News. \u201cI was thinking all the time, \u2018Here we are, doing this incredible record-breaking act and is exactly what America is all about: the pursuit of happiness,\u2019\u201d added Segal, an activist for LGBTQ+ rights who participated in the 1969 Stonewall riots. Adults  and children who gathered on the first day of Pride Month at the event  listened to several performers who read \u201c\u2019Twas the Night Before Pride\u201d  by Joanna McClintick, \u201cElmer\u201d by David McKee, \u201cThe Family Book\u201d by Todd  Parr and \u201cKevin the Unicorn: It\u2019s Not All Rainbows\u201d by Jessika von  Innerebner, organizers said. Brittany  Lynn,\u00a0an activist and performer who has led and organized\u00a0a drag queen  story time program in the city for nearly a decade, read \u201cHello,  Philadelphia!\u201d by\u00a0Martha Day Zschock. Lynn said the books were curated  to center around themes of love, diversity and acceptance. \u201cOur  goal is to give the kids the fun of learning to read and make literacy  fun. That\u2019s our mission. People get it all twisted when they see drag  queens reading (to) the kids but if they actually came to drag queen  story time and saw what we were all about, I feel like there wouldn\u2019t be  any animosity,\u201d Lynn said. A  spokesperson for Visit Philadelphia said the event warranted additional  safety precautions due to the event\u2019s nature and the warnings issued by  the federal government about LGBTQ+ events. Those precautions included  \u201ccareful consideration\u201d for when and how to promote the event, they  said. Last month,\u00a0the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security\u00a0issued a warning foreign terrorist organizations and their supporters may target LGBTQ+ events and venues as Pride Month approached, CNN previously reported. As  hundreds of people waited for the drag performers to start reading,  Lynn said it appeared they were 10 people short of the record and went  through the story time not knowing what would happen. The confirmation  didn\u2019t come until the last performer was reading their story. \u201cI think that the audience was just as excited as we were. You could hear the children clapping, and everybody was so proud that we did this, not just the girls that were in the show, not just us as performers but the entire audience. Everybody that worked so hard to make this happen. It was a shared moment that we all had collectively together,\u201d said Lynn of the moment when the performers stood on stage holding the Guinness certificate. For Segal, one of the organizers, the record proved to the world nothing can stop their pride. \u201cWe  came together anyway. We said in the face of adversity, we are here, we  are visible, and that made me very, very proud. Now, my community, I  would say, we stand against any type of violence, and we will be  visible. You can\u2019t bully us,\u201d Segal said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/07/us/philadelphia-drag-story-time-world-record/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_07_politics_ketanji-brown-jackson-beyonce-concert-tickets", "text": "Beyonc\u00e9 gave Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson four tickets to her concert last year, the justice disclosed in financial disclosure forms published Friday that also revealed that Jackson and other justices received six-figure payments in 2023 for book deals. Jackson, who reported an eye-popping $893,750 payment from a book publisher, was joined by Justices Brett Kavanaugh, Neil Gorsuch and Sonia Sotomayor in reporting income from books that they have published or have coming out in the future. The book deals have at times been controversial. Supreme Court justices and other government officials are capped on receiving more than about $30,000 in outside income, but book income doesn\u2019t count toward that cap. Jackson, a member of the court\u2019s liberal wing, was paid by Penguin Random House, the book publisher that is publishing her upcoming memoir. Kavanaugh, a conservative who recently disclosed he is writing a memoir, listed a $340,000 payment from the Javelin Group agency. Gorsuch, who is also publishing a book this year, reported royalty income of $250,000. Book deals are typically paid in installments, so the full financial windfall justices receive from their books will not be known for several more years. Justice Amy Coney Barrett in 2022 reported receiving a $425,000 advance on her book, a figure that drew some criticism. In this most recent report, however, she didn\u2019t list any additional income from that deal. Sotomayor, who has written a series of children\u2019s books, reported receiving two installments of royalty payments from Random House \u2014 a $47,704.63 payment in May 2023, and a $39,079.59 payment in December. Gifts and travel revealed on disclosures Jackson reported the Beyonc\u00e9 concert tickets \u2014 worth a total $3,711.84 \u2014 as part of a disclosure mandate for gifts worth $480 or more. The artist Lonnie Holley, meanwhile, gifted Jackson artwork for her chambers valued at $10,000. The justice also received artwork worth $2,5000 from Dr. Kathi Earles-Ross and others. Justice Clarence Thomas said he received two photo albums worth a total $2,000 from Terrence and Barbara Giroux. Terrence Giroux is the executive director emeritus of the Horatio Alger Association, an elite philanthropic organization of which Thomas is a member. The annual disclosures, which are required by law, provide only a rough sketch of the finances of the justices and lower court judges. But the reports have drawn considerable attention in recent years amid a series of ethics scandals involving private jet travel and luxury vacations accepted by some of the justices. Several justices reported foreign and domestic travel paid for by law schools and outside legal groups. Gorsuch, for instance, reported traveling to Lisbon, Portugal, last summer with George Mason University for an \u201ceducation program\u201d and to London months earlier for a Federalist Society program. Kavanaugh and Barrett also both traveled to London last year, both with the University of Notre Dame. Others listed domestic trips, including Justice Elena Kagan, who was reimbursed for travel to Notre Dame in Indiana for a speech in September. Sotomayor was reimbursed for a trip to Los Angeles last summer for an award ceremony and to Harvard University in November to sit on a moot court. The new disclosures also revealed income justices received from various side gigs.\u00a0Multiple justices received income for teaching and for rental properties, while Sotomayor was paid for a voice-acting role on an animated show. Gorsuch received $29,798.20 last year for teaching at George Mason University, while Kavanaugh\u2019s gig teaching at Notre Dame Law school brought him $25,000. Barrett was paid $14,947.50 last year by Notre Dame, where she is an adjunct professor. That is significantly less than the nearly $30,000 in 2022 teaching income from Notre Dame that she reported on her annual disclosures last year. For a voice performance on the animated television show \u201cAlma\u2019s Way,\u201d Sotomayor received $1,879.16. Sotomayor also reported rental income from a property in New York and a property in Florida, while Chief Justice John Roberts disclosed rental income from a cottage in Maine\u00a0and from a cottage he partially owns in Ireland. Thomas listed rental income received through an LLC called \u201cGinger Holdings\u201d for a property in Nebraska, his wife\u2019s home state. Kagan, meanwhile, said she made somewhere between $15,001 to $50,000 last year renting out a parking space in Washington, DC.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/07/politics/ketanji-brown-jackson-beyonce-concert-tickets/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_06_us_gilgo-beach-killings-rex-heuermann-indictment", "text": "Gilgo Beach serial killings suspect\u00a0Rex Heuermann\u00a0now faces charges in the deaths of six women spanning three decades and multiple Long Island communities after he was indicted on two new murder charges Thursday \u2014 the latest development in an investigation authorities in New York say is far from over. Heuermann pleaded not guilty to charges of second-degree murder in the 2003 death of Jessica Taylor and the 1993 death of Sandra Costilla. The 60-year-old architect was taken by surprise by Thursday\u2019s charges, and he is \u201cin a bad place in terms of the new charges,\u201d his attorney Michael Brown said after his client appeared in an eastern Long Island courtroom. Heuermann was remanded without bail and is expected in court July 30. \u201cOne murder is obviously horrific, and it\u2019s a difficult thing to defend,\u201d Brown said. \u201cAnd now we\u2019re at six,\u201d Brown said. Gasps were heard in the courtroom as Suffolk County prosecutor Nicholas Santomartino described the disturbing content he said authorities discovered on Heuermann\u2019s devices, including a planning document outlining a strategy for future killings. A Word document Heuermann allegedly created on a laptop in 2000 and modified over several years outlines how to dispose of a body, avoid apprehension and not leave DNA evidence, along with what supplies may be needed to carry out serial murder, according to the bail application. A section called \u201cbody prep\u201d detailed steps to clean, dismember and transport bodies, while a \u201cpost event\u201d section of the document appeared to be a checklist of tasks to avoid apprehension, including having a story set, according to the bail application. \u201cThis was a planning document used by Heuermann to methodically blueprint and plan out his kills with excruciating detail. His intent was specifically to locate these victims, hunt them down to bring them under his control and to kill them,\u201d Suffolk County District Attorney Raymond Tierney\u00a0said in a news conference after the court appearance. Other evidence \u201crevealed Heuermann\u2019s significant collection of violent, bondage, and torture pornography, currently dating back to 1994,\u201d the bail application reads. Taylor\u2019s remains were discovered in part in Manorville in 2003, with more found along Ocean Parkway on Gilgo Beach in 2011. Manorville is around 45 miles northeast of Gilgo and about 40 miles east of Massapequa Park, Heuermann\u2019s hometown. Her remains were found face up, decapitated, with her hands and arms severed below the elbows. A tattoo had been obliterated with a sharp object, Tierney said. Taylor was working as a sex worker in New York City when she went missing, and officials know Heuermann was in the city the last day Taylor was seen there, he added. When Taylor failed to return home for her mom\u2019s birthday, her family alerted law enforcement and some of her body was recovered the next day. Witnesses said they saw a dark-colored pickup near where her body was eventually recovered, according to the bail application. Costilla\u2019s remains were found in North Sea in 1993 by two hunters in the woods, according to the bail application. She was found on her back, with 25 sharp force injuries believed to have been imposed post-mortem, Tierney said. Forensic testing performed on strands of hair found on or near both Taylor and Costilla\u2019s remains found that the 99.96% of the North American population could be excluded as the source of the hairs \u2013\u00a0but Heuermann could not. The bail application highlights that two different forensic laboratories determined hairs recovered on five of the six charged victims were tied to Heuermann, members of his immediate family or to people he lived with, according to the document. \u201cDefendant Heuermann is the individual who murdered, stripped, restrained, and transported the remains of Jessica Taylor and Sandra Costilla, as well as the Gilgo Four, until they were each discovered in 1993, 2003, 2010, and 2011,\u201d the bail application reads. Heuermann was initially arrested in July 2023 and was charged with murder in the killings of four women whose bodies were discovered bound with belts or tape and wrapped in burlap along a stretch of Long Island\u2019s Gilgo Beach in 2010. Those victims \u2013 Melissa Barthelemy, Megan Waterman, Amber Costello and Maureen Brainard-Barnes \u2013 became known as the \u201cGilgo Four.\u201d Heuermann pleaded not guilty to the charges related to all four. The women were among at least 11 sets of remains discovered near the waterfront in Long Island\u2019s Suffolk County since 2010. Authorities have accused Heuermann of leading a double life, with his wife and children away for most of the alleged murders. That allegedly allowed Heuermann \u201cunfettered time to execute his plans for each victim without any fear that his family would uncover or learn of his involvement in these crimes,\u201d prosecutors previously said in an indictment. Less than a week after Heuermann\u2019s arrest, his wife filed for divorce. But she has since said she does not believe Heuermann is capable of the alleged crimes. In January, Brown told reporters the former New York architect claimed he\u2019s \u201cnot guilty of these charges\u201d and looks forward to fighting the charges in court. \u2018We are not near the end of this investigation,\u2019 law enforcement source says Tierney announced Thursday that investigators have discovered a plethora of new evidence at Heuermann\u2019s Massapequa Park house, including cameras, computers, hard drives, cell phones and other devices. Detectives believe, based on \u201coffender characteristics\u201d of serial killers, there may be more alleged killings, according to officials briefed on the investigation. \u201cIn most of these cases, a serial killer does not start killing in his 40s,\u201d said a law enforcement official familiar with the case. That belief spurred investigators to not only expand their attempts to identify unidentified victims, re-examine dump sites and conduct additional searches of Heuermann\u2019s home, but to also begin reexamining unsolved missing persons cases. Investigators are also looking at seemingly unrelated unsolved homicides where there may be similarities among the victims, the crime scenes or condition of the bodies. \u201cWe are not near the end of this investigation,\u201d\u00a0one law enforcement official involved in the sweeping case said. \u201cWe are very much at the beginning.\u201d CNN\u2019s John Miller, Emma Tucker and Ray Sanchez contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/06/us/gilgo-beach-killings-rex-heuermann-indictment/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_07_business_adults-preschoolers-toy-buying", "text": "Adults bought more toys for themselves than for any other age group last quarter for the first time ever, surpassing toys for even the historically-dominant preschooler market.  Consumers 18 years of age and up spent $1.5 billion in toy-related purchases in the period from January through April, overtaking the three-to five-year-old demographic as the most important age group for the toy industry, according to a new report from market research firm Circana. Looking back over a longer period, the report said as many as 43% of adults purchased a toy for themselves in the past year, with the top reasons being for personal fun, socialization and for collecting. Trading cards, Squishmallows (which are a rage across age groups), Lego sets and sports toys were among the most sought-after toy products in the period, the report said. As adults play with toys more and more, the trend bodes well to counter the decline in overall toy sales. Circana said toy industry dollar sales declined by 1% through April, versus the same period a year ago but are still up 38% compared to 2019. \u201cTailwinds, like the growing adult toy market and spending power of higher income households and grandparents, drive positive trends,\u201d Juli Lennett, vice president and toy industry advisor at Circana, said in the report. \u201cHowever, headwinds like rising household debt, slowing GDP growth, and fluctuating consumer confidence indicate potential challenges. \u201c Key part of \u2018adulting\u2019 involves toys While adults have always bought toys for themselves, fueled by the collector market for brands like Barbie and Hot Wheels, that niche market, industry experts said, has gone mainstream in the last five years. The pandemic was an important catalyst for it. \u201cDuring the pandemic, when people were flush with cash and had time to spend at home whether with their families or alone, they wanted to reconnect with the toys that made them happy as kids,\u201d said James Zahn, Editor in Chief of industry trade publication The Toy Book, in an interview with CNN. But people who were already toy collectors by that point ramped up their interest. \u201cWe\u2019re talking everything, dolls, action figures and diecast vehicles,\u201d he said. \u201cOutside of collectibles, boardgames, Lego building sets, trading cards, which are extraordinarily hot again, are also firing up adult interest.\u201d Some toymakers, he said, are now introducing new products straight for the adult population. \u201cJanuary Through April, in the actions figure category, the top two new items that came out were both items that kids are not going to buy,\u201d Zahn said. \u201cThe No. 1 item is the X-Men 97 Marvel Legends action figure collection from Hasbro, inspired by an animated series geared towards an adult audience.\u201d The second buzziest new item in the period is a Star Wars The Black Series Clone Caption Rex role play helmet from Hasbro. \u201cIt is a $130 collectible that essentially looks like a movie prop,\u201d he said. Meanwhile, old-fashioned modeling kits that were once popular with older shoppers have been replaced by Lego sets. \u201cThat very therapeutic idea of sitting down to create something of your own as an adult has a new format from a traditional model kit to a building set,\u201d Zahn set. \u201cLego gets a ton of that 18 and older market.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/07/business/adults-preschoolers-toy-buying/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "us"}}

Is it someone else?\u2019 I mean, can you tell it\u2019s me now?\u201d Gill confirmed that he is behind the posts on his X and Reddit accounts, and that the screenshots he has uploaded on the latter platform are of his own portfolio. \u201cThese are my positions. I\u2019m not working with anyone else. I\u2019m not working with hedge funds,\u201d he said. Gill had communicated exclusively by posting memes, gifs, short video clips and screenshots of his portfolio until the livestream, leaving it unclear if it even was Gill behind the social media posts. GameStop shares slid during his livestream and were halted several times for volatility. The livestream lasted roughly 50 minutes, much shorter than his previous livestreams that typically went on for several hours. \u201cWhat can I say about GameStop? I mean, the funny thing is that I have a lot of the same feelings about everything,\u201d said Gill. \u201cThey\u2019re in the transformation stage here. \u2026 I feel like I see enough. I believe (CEO Ryan Cohen) might be able to do it.\u201d In a surprise move, GameStop brought forward its first quarter earnings to Friday from next Tuesday. The video game retailer recorded a loss of $32.3 million, slightly better than the $50.5 million loss the prior year. First quarter sales slipped to $0.9 billion, from $1.2 billion the year before. Gill cautioned that while he has faith in Cohen, traders should reach their own conclusions. \u201cIt remains to be seen. You should keep your eye on stuff, too, reserve the right to change your mind just like I do. Don\u2019t follow anyone blindly,\u201d Gill said. Shares of GameStop slid more than 39% on Friday, notching its worst day since February 2021. The video game stock has seen wild swings in recent weeks reminiscent of the meme stock craze after Gill\u2019s return to social media in May. Gill also acknowledged reports that E*Trade is considering removing him from its platform and said that he logs on every morning wondering if he\u2019ll be able to access his account. He shared another update on his portfolio, which showed he has not sold any of his 5 million shares or exercised his 120,000 call options after his last update on Thursday. His total GameStop holdings were worth more than $300 million as of mid-day Friday, down roughly $200 million after the stock\u2019s steep losses during the trading session.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/07/investing/roaring-kitty-keith-gill-gamestop/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_05_us_baltimore-port-reopen-bridge-removal", "text": "The Port of Baltimore channel could fully reopen this weekend after nearly 11 weeks of painstaking operations to remove colossal pieces of the collapsed Francis Scott Key Bridge that had been blocking much of the crucial shipping artery. The entire 700-foot wide channel is expected to reopen between Saturday and Monday \u2013 a milestone made possible now that the last piece of steel bridge blocking the channel has been removed, according to Unified Command, a group of agencies that responded to the disaster on March 26, after a 213-million pound cargo ship lost power and crashed into one of the bridge\u2019s support columns. Six construction workers were killed. Clearing the final piece of bridge truss \u2013 a structure of interconnected concrete, cables and steel rebar \u2013 was completed earlier this week using concrete breakers, torches and underwater surveys, Unified Command said. Though crews were able to clear a limited, 400-foot avenue for vessels to pass through last month, the complete reopening of the channel will usher a return to full operations at the port \u2013 an essential international cargo destination and employer of thousands of local workers. The vessel remained stuck in the waterway for nearly two months as crews worked to remove a piece of the bridge pinning down its bow, finally hauling the ship away on May 20.

{"id": "2024_06_07_us_louisville-police-body-camera-scheffler", "text": "Three Louisville Metro police officers failed to activate their body cameras, in violation of policy, during the arrest of golfer Scottie Scheffler near Valhalla Golf Club in Louisville, Kentucky, on May 17, an investigation found. Scheffler was arrested for allegedly refusing to stop while on his way to a golf tournament and dragging a police officer, according to an internal investigation released by the department Friday. According to the documents, Detectives Bryan Gillis, Kelvin Watkins and Officer Javar Downs did not turn on their bodycam, which is a violation of police procedures. Scheffler, 27, was attempting to drive to the Valhalla Golf Club in Louisville, Kentucky for a tournament when he came to the scene of a fatal crash around 6 a.m., CNN previously reported. He allegedly injured a police officer who was directing traffic and was then detained and arrested. According to a statement given to police, Gillis said while directing traffic, he observed a vehicle traveling in the opposing lanes toward him. \u201cI  stopped the driver and advised him he could not proceed because of the  bus. He demanded to be let in, proceeded forward against my directions. I  was dragged/knocked down by the driver,\u201d the statement said. \u201cI then  proceeded to arrest the driver.\u201d According to the police\u2019s internal investigation, no other police department members witnessed the initial incident, due to a shuttle bus blocking their view. All charges against Scheffler were dismissed less than two weeks after his arrest, CNN previously reported. According to Gillis\u2019 statement, he never powered up his body cam because when he arrived on the scene, he \u201cimmediately started directing traffic.\u201d \u201cDetective Gillis should have had his issued BWC powered on and at least in standby mode,\u201d the Body-Worn Camera Failure to Record Form stated. It later added, \u201che failed to comply with powering it on.\u201d Detective Watkins said in a statement he \u201cdid not catch\u201d the initial confrontation with Gillis and Scheffler. \u201cMy  bodycam was activated after I realized that this was a potential  problem,\u201d he said in the statement. \u201cMy view was blocked by a bus,\u201d he  said. Officer Downs also failed to activate his bodycam because he said he was \u201ctasked with alleviating traffic,\u201d the document said. According  to the documents, Gillis was counseled by a member of his command on  May 22, and a performance observation was completed. In addition to being documented for failing to turn on his bodycam, Gillis was also cited for reaching into a vehicle while it was running. \u201cNot a violation of policy, but tactically poor decision making by Det. Gillis regarding reaching into a vehicle that is running, is in drive, and the operator has the ability to pull away/accelerate,\u201d the summary said. \u201cWhether Gillis grabbed Mr. Scheffler\u2019s arm, or Mr. Scheffler pinned Gillis\u2019s arm with his knee is immaterial had Gillis not crossed the plain into the vehicle\u2019s passenger compartment.\u201d The summary said \u201cthe charges at the time\u201d were only traffic offenses and Gillis \u201chas been verbally counseled regarding risk versus reward in response to this incident.\u201d The investigation findings did support Gillis\u2019s actions by saying \u201cEvery other driver did as directed throughout the abnormal operations outside Valhalla.\u201d This story has been updated with additional details.

{"id": "2024_06_06_us_colorado-elk-attacks", "text": "A 4-year-old boy and an 8-year-old girl were attacked and injured by elk four days apart in a Colorado town. The boy was at a playground near Stanley Park in Estes Park, Colorado, around 1:30 p.m. Monday when a cow (female) elk \u201csuddenly charged and stomped on him multiple times,\u201d a Colorado Parks and Wildlife news release said Tuesday. Two elk calves were hiding\u00a0near where the boy was playing, the release said. While the cow elk was scared off by a family member, the boy was taken to a hospital and later released. An officer with Colorado Parks and Wildlife came onto the scene and hazed multiple cow elk in the area with \u201cnon-lethal bean bag rounds\u201d so they would move away from the park, according to the release. Kara Van Hoose, a spokesperson for Colorado Parks and Wildlife, told CNN Thursday the elk have left the area and the agency has no further reports on their location. Colorado Parks and Wildlife \u201cmanages 42 state parks, all of Colorado\u2019s wildlife, more than 300 state wildlife areas and a host of recreational programs.\u201d Stanley Park\u2019s playground has closed indefinitely since the incident and parts of the Lake Estes Loop trail are closed. Signs warning patrons of aggressive cow elk have been posted in the area, the\u00a0agency\u00a0said. Four days earlier, an 8-year-old girl riding her bike in Estes Park\u00a0around 1 p.m. was charged at and stomped on multiple times by a cow elk, Colorado Parks and Wildlife said in a release at the time.\u00a0She was also taken to a hospital and released the same day. A Colorado Parks and Wildlife officer later found a cow elk and a calf in the area. The cow elk became aggressive toward the officer who then fired non-lethal bean bag rounds to calm it down. The calf in question was requested for study by the agency\u2019s health lab, Van Hoose said. She noted the adult cow elk had not been euthanized and the bean bag rounds did not injure the elk. Neither child had been bothering the elk, according to the agency. Van Hoose told CNN the agency doesn\u2019t believe the same cow elk was involved in both attacks. \u201cCalves are often hidden to protect them from predators, but that means they are hidden to us as well, which is what happened in these cases as the kids were not aware the calves were nearby,\u201d Van Hoose told CNN. Both attacks prompted Estes Park to\u00a0post a warning to their Facebook page Monday saying: \u201cThough they may look harmless, like the bull (male) elk during the rut, cows are extremely dangerous during calving season \u2026 The bird sanctuary along the Lake Estes Trail and the Stanley Park area are common places for the elk to give birth, however births can take place in any area. For safety, it is important to obey the \u201ctrail closed\u201d signs and take a different route. Be watchful in residential neighborhoods, as people have been injured at their homes by walking out the door and unknowingly getting between a cow elk and her calf,\u201d the\u00a0town posted. Colorado Parks and Wildlife warns\u00a0calving season for elk\u00a0starts late spring and runs through early summer, so it\u2019s\u00a0best to leave the animals alone. Elk are known to be aggressive towards what they perceive as threats to their immobile young. \u201cThis is something that\u2019s innate to them. That\u2019s just biology. So they (the elk) just react. They can\u2019t think logically through situations. They don\u2019t really have emotions at that point,\u201d Van Hoose told CNN affiliate KCNC-TV. \u201cThis is just a sense of \u2018something is threatening my child, I am going to protect them.\u2019\u201d However, it is common for calves to be found alone as their mothers often leave to find food. The young are not \u201cabandoned\u201d and \u201cthe best bet is to leave newborn wildlife where their mother left them until she returns,\u201d the agency\u00a0cautions.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/06/us/colorado-elk-attacks/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "us"}}

{"id": "2024_06_07_us_food-fraud-scheme-convicted", "text": "A jury convicted five Minnesota residents but acquitted two others on Friday for their roles in a scheme to steal more than $40 million that was supposed to feed children during the coronavirus pandemic. The case received widespread attention after someone tried to bribe a juror with a bag of $120,000 in cash. That juror was dismissed before deliberations began, and a second juror who was told about the bribe attempt was also dismissed. An FBI investigation of the attempted bribe continues, with no arrests announced. The seven defendants are the first of 70 to stand trial in what federal prosecutors have called one of the nation\u2019s largest COVID-19-related frauds, exploiting rules that were kept lax so that the economy wouldn\u2019t crash during the pandemic. More than $250 million in federal funds was taken in the Minnesota scheme overall, with only about $50 million of it recovered, authorities said. The defendants faced a mix of multiple counts including conspiracy, wire fraud, money laundering and federal programs bribery. It ended with a split verdict. Abdiaziz Shafii Farah, Mohamed Jama Ismail, Abdimajid Mohamed Nur, Mukhtar Mohamed Shariff and Hayat Mohamed Nur were found guilty on most of the counts against them. Said Shafii Farah and Abdiwahab Maalim Aftin were acquitted on all counts they faced. Defense attorneys argued that the defendants provided real meals to real people. An Associated Press analysis published last June documented how thieves across the country plundered billions in federal COVID-19 relief dollars. Fraudsters potentially stole more than $280 billion, while another $123 billion was wasted or misspent. Combined, the loss represented 10% of the $4.3 trillion the government disbursed by last fall. Nearly 3,200 defendants have been charged and about $1.4 billion in stolen pandemic aid has been seized, according to the U.S. Justice Department. The Minnesota case drew attention after the judge and attorneys for both sides learned about the bribe attempt. The judge ordered all seven defendants to surrender their cellphones so that investigators could look for evidence. She also ordered all seven taken into custody, and sequestered the jury. According to an FBI agent\u2019s affidavit, a woman rang the doorbell at the home of \u201cJuror #52\u201d in the Minneapolis suburb of Spring Lake Park the night before the case went to the jury. The juror wasn\u2019t home, but a relative answered the door. The woman handed the relative a gift bag with a curly ribbon and images of flowers and butterflies and said it was a \u201cpresent\u201d for the juror. \u201cThe woman told the relative to tell Juror #52 to say not guilty tomorrow and there would be more of that present tomorrow,\u201d the agent wrote. \u201cAfter the woman left, the relative looked in the gift bag and saw it contained a substantial amount of cash.\u201d The juror called police right after she got home and gave them the bag, which held stacks of $100, $50 and $20 bills totaling around $120,000. The woman who left the bag knew the juror\u2019s first name, the agent said. Names of the jurors have not been made public, but the list of people with access to it included prosecutors, defense lawyers \u2014 and the seven defendants. \u201cIt is highly likely that someone with access to the juror\u2019s personal information was conspiring with, at a minimum, the woman who delivered the $120,000 bribe,\u201d the FBI agent wrote, noting that the alleged fraud conspiracy at the heart of the trial involved electronic communications, including text messages and emails. Federal charges of bribery of a juror and influencing a juror carry a maximum potential penalty of 15 years in prison. The food aid came from the U.S. Department of Agriculture and was administered by the state, which funneled the meal money through nonprofit organizations and other partners. As rules were eased to speed support to the needy, the defendants allegedly produced invoices for meals never served, ran shell companies, laundered money, indulged in passport fraud and accepted kickbacks. Federal prosecutors said just a fraction of the money the defendants received through the Feeding our Future nonprofit went to feed low-income kids, while the rest was spent on luxury cars, jewelry, travel and property. The seven collectively stole more than $40 million, they said. The common thread in the defense arguments was that investigators failed to dig deep enough to see they served real meals to real kids. Eighteen other defendants pleaded guilty. Among those awaiting trial is Aimee Bock, the founder of Feeding our Future. She has maintained her innocence, saying she never stole and saw no evidence of fraud among her subcontractors.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/07/us/food-fraud-scheme-convicted/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_07_politics_takeaways-from-day-5-of-hunter-bidens-gun-trial", "text": "Special counsel prosecutors rested their case against Hunter Biden on Friday, and his lawyers said they\u2019ll decide over the weekend whether he testifies in his own defense. That would be a bold and risky move for President Joe Biden\u2019s son, who could face prison time if he is convicted of the felony gun charges that he\u2019s currently facing. He has pleaded not guilty to lying on federal background check forms about his drug use and to possessing a gun while addicted to drugs. The defense began presenting its case as well on Friday, calling Biden\u2019s daughter Naomi Biden. She said she was \u201cnervous\u201d and appeared uncomfortable at times, including when confronted by prosecutors about some difficult texts with her father \u2013 texts which could lead to questions about Hunter Biden\u2019s state of mind that October. Here\u2019s what to know about Day 5 of the trial: Daughter \u2018was hopeful\u2019 about Hunter\u2019s recovery Hunter Biden\u2019s attorneys said earlier on that his daughter Naomi and his uncle James could tell the jury about how the defendant was moving away from drugs and toward recovery around when he bought the gun. Naomi Biden described visiting her father in summer 2018, while he was in rehab in Los Angeles and working with a sober companion. \u201cHe seemed like the clearest that I had seen him since my uncle died,\u201d she said, referring to her uncle Beau Biden, who died from brain cancer in 2015, later adding, \u201cI told him that I was so proud of him.\u201d Moving forward to October 2018 \u2013 the month Hunter Biden bought the gun \u2013 he was in New York and Naomi saw him briefly to give him back his truck. \u201cWe exchanged the car with my dad and he still seemed good, and I was hopeful,\u201d she said. Naomi didn\u2019t see\u00a0drug remnants in Hunter\u2019s car During cross-examination by the prosecutors, Naomi Biden testified that she never used drugs and did not bring any drugs or paraphernalia into the truck before returning the vehicle to her father on October 19. Within the week, Hunter went back down to Delaware. Earlier this week Beau\u2019s widow Hallie Biden, who later dated Hunter, testified that she found remnants of crack cocaine in the car when she searched it on October 23, the same day she discovered the gun. Naomi Biden later, however, seemed a little confused and reticent when confronted with texts appearing to show her father to be somewhat erratic and non-communicative while they tried to arrange the car handoff. As she left the stand, Naomi Biden gave her dad an embrace, a kiss on the cheek, and was seen trembling and wiping away tears as she exited the courtroom. \u2018Down to that last decision\u2019 After the lunch break. Hunter\u2019s lawyer Abbe Lowell announced that the defense would not ask James Biden to testify and court adjourned early. Biden\u2019s team said they want to take the weekend to decide whether the defendant takes the stand in his own defense. At least one witnesses previously described him as \u201cextremely charming,\u201d and he is known to share some of the same folksy affability as his father. He is from Delaware, and his family is a fixture in this state, where all of the jurors are from. \u201cWe are down to that last decision,\u201d Lowell told the judge. It would be a risky move. In pretrial filings, prosecutors said there was a host of thorny and potentially damaging matters that they\u2019d want to bring up if he took the stand. Prosecutors rest their case As is true in all criminal trials, the burden is on the prosecutors to prove their case beyond a reasonable doubt to a unanimous jury. Nobody is contesting that Hunter Biden was a longtime drug abuser. His own memoir is filled with tales of his many crack cocaine binges and relapses. And the jury heard Hunter\u2019s story from his own perspective early on, when prosecutors played portions of his audiobook, where he described trolling homeless encampments for dealers and smoking crack nearly nonstop at the peak of his addiction. Prosecutors hope the jury will connect the dots between that vast evidence of his addiction and the gun that he bought on October 12, 2018, and possessed for less than two weeks. His ex-girlfriend Zoe Kestan testified Wednesday that she watched Biden smoke crack in September, and Hallie Biden, said he appeared to be \u201cunder the influence\u201d when occasionally she saw him in October 2018. During opening statements, prosecutors promised to present \u201coverwhelming evidence that he knew he was a drug addict and a drug user.\u201d That gets to one of the most difficult elements they\u2019ll need to prove, because it\u2019s about Hunter\u2019s state of mind. And that burden might be his best shot at an acquittal.

{"id": "2024_06_07_us_death-row-visitors-executions-cec", "text": "On August 9, 2018, Steven Hale stood outside a Tennessee prison as a convicted murderer inside awaited a lethal dose of a three-drug cocktail. It was the first execution of a death row inmate in the state in nearly a decade. Hale was one of seven reporters selected by a grim lottery to witness Billy Ray Irick\u2019s execution at the Riverbend Maximum Security Institution in Nashville. He\u2019d written stories about Irick\u2019s horrific rape and murder of a 7-year-old girl more than three decades earlier. But nothing prepared him for that night in 2018. Not far away, in an area reserved for death penalty supporters, a man blared AC/DC\u2019s \u201cHells Bells\u201d from a loudspeaker. And as a chaperone led Hale and other journalists to the execution chamber, Hale saw another small group of people huddled in a field outside the prison. They were there to show their love for Irick. One man told Hale he had called the prison earlier and pleaded with officials to let him sit in the death chamber so Irick would see a friendly face just before he died. The man sobbed when a prison official said no, Hale says. That night, as Irick took his last breath in the execution chamber, the group held a vigil outside the prison, hoping to claim his body for a memorial. Their stories lingered with Hale long after the execution. He soon became fascinated with the commitment shown by these supporters. They were not relatives of the prisoners, or death row groupies. Nor were they anti-death penalty activists \u2014 at least, not at the beginning. They were strangers united in one mission: visiting, befriending and comforting death row inmates in what might be their final months. \u201cI didn\u2019t know these people existed,\u201d Hale told CNN. \u201cI didn\u2019t know anyone was going out there to just visit people on death row, not as attorneys, not even family members, just as regular folks.\u201d He began to join their weekly trips to Riverbend, where they sat with death row prisoners and talked about everything from football to their families. For Tennesseeans on both sides of the death penalty issue, it was a turbulent time. In a span of less than two years after Irick was put to death, Tennessee held six more executions, a string unlike any other seen in the state since the 1940s. Hale witnessed two of those executions, in addition to Irick\u2019s. He chronicles his experiences in a new book, \u201cDeath Row Welcomes You: Visiting Hours in the Shadow of the Execution Chamber,\u201d which explores the complexities of Tennessee\u2019s capital punishment system and the unique friendships that develop between condemned murderers and the strangers who visit them. The book documents the prisoners\u2019 troubled pasts and examines their perspective after decades in prison, away from the public. \u00a0Hale said he was struck by the normalcy of the conversations he and others had with prisoners during their many visits. \u201cThese gatherings are so ordinary as to be extraordinary and so life-giving as to feel defiant,\u201d Hale writes in the book. He told CNN that during one of his visits, a death row inmate learned he had gone to Auburn University and began needling him. \u201cHe was teasing me about Auburn and saying it was overrated that year \u2026 it almost felt like I could be in a bar somewhere.\u201d \u201cIn that visitation room, everything felt normal,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then when we walked out, and there was a barbed wire and armed guard, you kind of remember, \u2018Oh, yeah, I\u2019m in a maximum-security prison.\u2019 \u201c Hale, 36, is a reporter for the Nashville Banner. CNN talked to him about his personal encounters with death row prisoners and the unique community of visitors \u2014 in the tradition of \u201cDead Man Walking\u201d\u2018s Sister Helen Prejean \u2014 who show them love in their final months. His answers have been edited for length and clarity. How did you go from writing about death row inmates to immersing yourself into their world? I was covering criminal justice in Tennessee and had an interest in the death penalty. But when I moved to Tennessee in 2010, there were no executions going on. It was that way until around 2014, when the state started scheduling some executions. I volunteered to witness one of those executions as a reporter, and was gearing up for that when it got called off because of litigation over lethal injection drugs. And then in 2018, the state scheduled a number of executions after the lethal injection litigation was completed and I started covering those cases. I was trying to interview him (Irick) or any of the men on death row.\u00a0 And here in Tennessee, it\u2019s very difficult to get access to incarcerated people as a as a reporter, particularly on death row. And during that process, I met a couple of people \u2013 just regular civilians \u2013 who went out to the prison to visit death row inmates. I was just so taken by this community. I started feeling like there was a bigger story there. When was your first visit with the death row inmates and what was that like? Not long after the first execution. I visited death row with this community of people and sat in that room with them.\u00a0 I was just so moved by that experience. It was unlike anything I\u2019d ever been around. And that\u2019s when I thought, I think I might have a book to write here. Just because there were all these people coming from different places who were together in this room. And it was so different than I had imagined. What stood out to you about that first visit? The visitors\u2019 wide demographic. There are some young folks who go out there to visit, and then there are some older folks who go there either through a church or community organization. The first night I went out to death row for these visitations, I was sitting there \u2026 and there was an older woman next to me.\u00a0 I can\u2019t say exactly how old she was, but she looked older than my parents. There was an older White woman sitting with a Black man on death row. So the ages and demographics are all kind of mixed up in there, and it was fascinating to see that. The people in this community are really not activists. Maybe they see themselves that way now. But when they got into this, they were not. Why do these people visit death row and attend executions? Many of the visitors I met and wrote about in the book started visiting death row through a church or because another visitor invited them. Their reasons vary. In many cases, I think they see it as an expression of their Christian faith. For others, what started out as a sort of personal journey turned into something else. What do the death row inmates think about their visits?\u00a0 I think the visits are very important to them because of the normal social needs we all have \u2026 these relationships represent an acceptance of who they are today. The courts and the prison and much of society have locked them in as the person they were 30 or 40 years ago, a person who did horrible things. But the friendships they\u2019ve developed with regular visitors aren\u2019t defined by that. How did you reconcile death row inmates\u2019 crimes with who they are now?\u00a0 That\u2019s a good question and something I asked some of those visitors myself. I asked them, how much research did you do on some of these guys? Did you feel that you need to know what they were on death row for before you met them? One of the visitors told me, \u2018I didn\u2019t. I don\u2019t\u00a0 Google people when I meet them in regular life.\u2019 And so I decided not to, because I knew the person that I would find online wasn\u2019t gonna be the person that I would meet. But there\u2019s one \u2026 (inmate) \u2026 in the book in particular that I became quite close with. His name\u2019s Terry Lynn King, and I did not look up a lot about his case. (King was convicted of first-degree murder and has been on Tennessee\u2019s death row since 1985). One thing I\u2019ve always said, and that other visitors have said to me, is you know enough just by the fact that the person\u2019s on death row. You know you only get there because you were convicted of killing someone, or more than one person. So for a lot of the visitors and for myself, that was kind of enough. I knew as a journalist \u2013 and for the book \u2013 that I was gonna have to get very deep into their past and the crimes they\u2019d committed. But as far as meeting them in the present, I wanted to just meet the person who was there then and take them on those terms. What kind of preparation did you have to make for visits with death row inmates? I tried not to think too much about it. The first time I went to Riverbend Maximum Security Institution for an execution, it felt very heavy psychologically.\u00a0 But the next time I went was to visit death row. So in some way, that was a much lighter evening because I knew I wasn\u2019t there for an execution. I was there with people who had been there before, and they were excited to see their friends on death row. As a reporter, I just wanted to soak as much of it in as as I could. I was in this atmosphere and environment that most people never get to see. How does the visitation process work? Tennessee\u2019s death row has a sort of unique setup in that it has a tiered system with levels. So when people first get there, they\u2019re very much kind of locked down in the more traditional way, and then based on time and behavior, they can get more privileges (such as visits). They are out of their cells most of the day and are able to do arts and crafts and buy food from the commissary and that kind of thing. In the book, I mention how Terry came with a bag of microwave popcorn, and was like, \u201cdo you want some popcorn?\u201d And went over to the corner and popped it.\u00a0It\u2019s such a surreal experience to go into the visitation gallery on death row. How big is the community of people who visit these inmates? It\u2019s hard to say, because there are consistently regular visitors and then there are others like me. But the community I talk about in the book has probably a dozen people. The first time I went there, there were about 12 visitors from the outside and that many men on death row in the room.\u00a0 It\u2019s a pretty small community. But one of the fascinating things about it is that the people have made it their mission to make it a bigger community by inviting more people to go out there. I was one of those people. Has this experience changed your views on the death penalty? I\u2019ve grown up believing that grace and redemption were good things, and that killing people, even if they had killed other people, was wrong. And so I came into this as someone who was opposed to the death penalty. And the more I reported on it as a journalist, I became more aware of the way the death penalty system in America does not uphold its own standards. It\u2019s become arbitrary in the sense that there are some states where you can commit a crime, and you\u2019ll get sentenced to death. And in another state, you could commit the same crime, and you wouldn\u2019t. Even within states, there may be one county where you\u2019ll get sentenced to death for a crime but not in other counties. But the more I witnessed these executions, I became more convinced that the distance that we keep between ourselves as a society and this issue is a big part of what allows it (the death penalty) to persist. If more people spent time with people on death row, if they witnessed these executions, they may feel differently about them. In the history of the death penalty, we\u2019ve made a lot of changes in how we do it \u2014 you know \u2026 hanging people to electrocuting people to lethal injection. Now we\u2019ve got states trying gas, and other ways. But in my experience, seeing lethal injection and two electrocutions, no matter how you do it \u2014 it looks very clearly like killing a person.\u00a0 Once you see it up close, it\u2019s very obvious.\u00a0 In the book, I describe it as barbarism dressed as bureaucracy and armed with legal jargon. There\u2019s also a racial disparity in that the race of the victim has a very strong correlation with the sentence. People who kill white people have been more likely to be sentenced to death that people who kill black people. It\u2019s just not a fair way to handle those crimes. What executions did you witness, and did those inmates have any notable last words? I witnessed the lethal injection of Billy Ray Irick and the electrocutions of David Earl Miller and Stephen West.\u00a0Irick initially declined to make a final statement\u00a0before suddenly saying he was sorry. Miller just said, \u201cbeats being on death row.\u201d But the one that comes to my mind most often is West weeping in the electric chair. I don\u2019t know and can\u2019t really imagine everything that was going through his mind then. But I often see in my mind the image of him strapped in the electric chair with tears running down his face. What do you hope people take away from your book? I hope it challenges people\u2019s preconceived notions about both the men on death row and the kind of visitors they get. One thing that\u2019s core to the theme of the book is the premise of the death penalty \u2026 that there are some people who are so terrible that they cannot come back from it. They cannot be rehabilitated or changed. And I have seen that is not true. Because I have met some of the people on Tennessee\u2019s death row who I would let in my house with my children. And that is not to diminish the crimes they committed. But it\u2019s because they\u2019re nothing like the person who committed that crime for a variety of reasons, whether it\u2019s mental health, whether it\u2019s substance abuse, whether it\u2019s the childhood they had. Some of the people I met have been on death row longer than I have been alive. They are not the same people anymore.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/07/us/death-row-visitors-executions-cec/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2023_07_21_us_gilgo-beach-four-killings-victims", "text": "Of the six women Rex Heuermann is accused of killing on Long Island, four of them were discovered bound with belts or tape and wrapped in burlap along a stretch of Gilgo Beach in 2010. A married father accused by authorities of leading a double life, Heuermann initially faced three counts of first-degree murder for the killings of Melissa Barthelemy in 2009, and Megan Waterman and Amber Costello the following year, according to the Suffolk County district attorney.  The 60-year-old New York architect was later charged in the disappearance and killing of a fourth woman, Maureen Brainard-Barnes, whose remains were found near the same spot, prosecutors said earlier this year. He had been identified as a prime suspect in the killing since his arrest in July. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges and is being held without bail.  On Thursday, Heuermann was indicted on two new murder charges to which he pleaded not guilty: second-degree murder in the 2003 death of Jessica Taylor and the 1993 death of Sandra Costilla, according to court documents.  Heuermann in January pleaded not guilty to the superseding indictment charging him with murder in the second degree in the death of Brainard-Barnes.  Heuermann \u201chas maintained his innocence from day one,\u201d his defense attorney said after he was charged in the fourth killing. \u201cHe said, \u2018I\u2019m not guilty of these charges,\u2019\u201d defense attorney Michael Brown said. \u201cHe\u2019s looking forward to fight these charges and we\u2019re doing that. We\u2019re going to continue to prepare.\u201d Heuermann was first identified as a potential suspect in early 2022, shortly after a multi-agency task force was formed to examine cold cases involving nearly a dozen sets of human remains found along Long Island\u2019s South Shore between 2010 and 2011, including the \u201cGilgo Four.\u201d \u201cThe grand jury investigation of the so-called Gilgo Four is over. It has been concluded,\u201d Suffolk County District Attorney Ray Tierney said in January, noting the same panel was looking into other murder cases.  Gloria Allred, a victims\u2019 rights attorney representing Barthelemy, Brainard-Barnes and Waterman family members, said it is \u201clong overdue to provide justice for vulnerable women who are missing and murdered.\u201d Allred said it\u2019s up to a jury \u201cto decide if this defendant will be found guilty of the murder of Maureen and the murder of other women for whom the defendant has been indicted.\u201d Here\u2019s what we know about the deaths of those four women: Maureen Brainard-Barnes    Brainard-Barnes was 25 years old and believed to be a sex worker when she was last seen on July 9, 2007. She had called a friend in Connecticut, where she lived, and said she had an \u201cout call,\u201d according to Suffolk County police. The young woman was reported missing by a friend to the Norwich Police Department in Connecticut on July 14.  Her remains were found on December 13, 2010, on the north side of Ocean Parkway, near Gilgo Beach.  She is believed to be the first Gilgo Four victim. Authorities identified Heuermann as a suspect in early 2022 using cell phone data, witness descriptions and other information, and obtained a sample of his DNA from leftover crust in a pizza box he threw out.  Investigators found the DNA of Heuermann\u2019s wife on a leather belt that was used to restrain Brainard-Barnes, according to an indictment.  She had been restrained by three leather belts, one of which was used to tie her feet and ankle legs together, the indictment states. Heuermann\u2019s wife and her two children were in Atlantic City at the time of the killing of Brainard-Barnes, according to a bail application. Tierney described victim Brainard-Barnes as an \u201cintellectual\u201d and \u201cartistic.\u201d \u201cShe was a devoted sister, a devoted mother, a devoted daughter, and she\u2019s sorely missed by those that loved her,\u201d Tierney said. Brainard-Barnes\u2019s family called the latest indictment \u201can important chapter in the long pursuit of justice.\u201d \u201cIt has been 16 years since the last time I saw my sister, 16 years since I heard her voice, because 16 years ago, she was silenced,\u201d Melissa Cann said in January. Cann described her sister as a loving mother, sister and friend. \u201cMaureen would never get the chance to show the world how talented she was,\u201d her sister said, choking up. \u201cMy family will never get the chance to know who Maureen would be today because her life was tragically taken.\u201d Nicolette Brainard-Barnes was only 7 years old when her mother was killed. She said the loss changed the trajectory of her life. \u201cWhile the loss of my mom has been extremely painful for me, the indictment by the grand jury has brought hope for justice for my mom and my family,\u201d said Nicolette Brainard-Barnes. Cann told CNN in 2011 that she desperately tried to solve the mystery of her sibling\u2019s disappearance, scouring her emails and phone records, and staying in touch with families of the other victims.  Cann said her sister worked a seasonal telemarketing job and turned to escort services in desperation when left unemployed and facing eviction.  Melissa Barthelemy   Barthelemy was 24 years old when she was last seen on July 12, 2009, in the basement apartment where she lived in the Bronx, according to the Suffolk County police website on the Gilgo killings.  On the night she was last seen, Barthelemy, a sex worker, told a friend she was meeting a man and would be back in the morning, according to the police website.  Barthelemy\u2019s mother reported her missing on July 18. Records for her cellphone showed activity in Manhattan as well as Freeport, Massapequa and Lindenhurst on Long Island.   In July and August 2009, according to a bail application for Heuermann, Barthelemy\u2019s phone was used by a man to make taunting calls to the victim\u2019s family.  Steve Cohen, who was an attorney for Barthelemy\u2019s mother at the time, told CNN the caller said he killed her daughter. \u201cDo you think you\u2019ll ever see her again?\u201d the unidentified male caller asked Barthelemy\u2019s sister on August 26, 2009, according to Cohen. \u201cYou won\u2019t. I killed her,\u201d he said and hung up. In another phone call, just days after Barthelemy disappeared, Cohen said the unidentified male caller referred to the victim as a \u201cwhore\u201d in a short conversation with her then-15-year-old sister. In one call, the man described in graphic detail to the victim\u2019s sister what he had done sexually to Barthelemy, according to Cohen.  Barthelemy\u2019s remains were the first set of female remains found in bushes along an isolated strip of waterfront property. At the time, authorities were searching for another missing woman, Shannan Gilbert, a 23-year-old from Jersey City, New Jersey, who hadn\u2019t been seen since May 2010. \u201cI still don\u2019t sleep through the night thinking about all of it,\u201d Lynn Barthelemy, the victim\u2019s mother, told CNN in 2011.  She said she jotted down everything she learned about the case in a notebook and spoke regularly with families of other victims.  Investigators believe Barthelemy was the second of the women to be killed.  Megan Waterman  Waterman was 22 years old when she was last seen on June 6, 2010. A resident of Maine, Waterman was last seen by her family boarding a Concord Trailways bus heading from Maine to New York, according to Suffolk County police.  She was a sex worker, police said. At 1:30 a.m. on June 6, she left the Holiday Inn Express on Long Island to meet a client, according to police.  Waterman was reported missing in Maine on June 8. Family members said it was unusual for her not to check on the daughter Waterman had left in their care.   Her body was found on December 13, 2010, near Gilgo Beach. Waterman\u2019s family at one time used funding from a nonprofit human rights organization to hire a team of private investigators to help search for her.  Dottie Laster, a member of that team, told CNN in 2011 Waterman sounded starstruck when she called her mother to boast that her clients included doctors, lawyers and law enforcement officers.  Amber Lynn Costello  Costello was 27 years old and living on Long Island when she was last seen. She struggled with a heroin addiction and worked as an escort to help support her habit, according to Suffolk County police. She was was last seen leaving her home on September 2, 2010, to meet a client. Her remains were found on December 13, 2010, near Gilgo Beach. She is believed to be the fourth victim.   Witnesses told investigators that the client she met the day she went missing had been at her home previously. They described the man as \u201ca large, white male, approximately 6\u20194\u201d to 6\u20196\u201d in height\u201d with \u201cbig oval style\u201d glasses. A witness also said the man resembled an \u201cogre.\u201d Heuermann\u2019s bail application noted the description from these witnesses in 2010 matched Heuermann. Costello\u2019s sister, Kim Overstreet, told CNN in 2011 that she took out an ad hoping to catch the killer. The ad implored other women who work as escorts to call Overstreet. She wanted them to tell her if they ever encountered a client who was threatening or just didn\u2019t feel right. \u201cWhat happened to Amber eats at me every day,\u201d Overstreet said at the time. \u201cFinding out who did this consumes me. I stay up all night doing research and trying to re-trace her last steps.\u201d Witnesses also said the man drove a first-generation Chevrolet Avalanche \u2013 a key clue that prosecutors said helped lead them to Heuermann.

Persichitti\u00a0was\u00a0a \u201cwonderful, pleasant, humble\u00a0guy,\u201d who was \u201ceasy know, easy to talk to,\u201d\u00a0said\u00a0Honor Flight Rochester President and CEO\u00a0Richard Stewart, who told CNN he learned of his friend\u2019s death last Friday. \u201cWe miss him,\u201d said Stewart. While Persichitti passed away bound for Normandy \u2014 where the Allied forces\u2019 landing on June 6, 1944, laid the foundation for the defeat of Nazi Germany \u2014 he served in the Pacific as a radioman aboard the USS Eldorado, Stewart said. His tour of duty included Iwo Jima, Okinawa and Guam, according to Stewart and the New York State Senate Veterans Hall of Fame, into which Persichitti was inducted in 2020. Persichitti fell ill\u00a0last week\u00a0during a stop in Germany while headed for Normandy,\u00a0Al DeCarlo, a friend who was traveling with Persichitti, told\u00a0CNN affiliate WHAM.\u00a0Persichitti was airlifted to the hospital\u00a0and\u00a0died soon after, DeCarlo said. \u201cThe doctor was with him. He was not alone, he was at peace and he was comfortable,\u201d DeCarlo said. \u201cShe put his favorite singer, Frank Sinatra, on her phone and he peacefully left us.\u201d Persichitti had heart problems in the past, \u201cbut for 102, I would say he was in superb health,\u201d\u00a0Stewart told CNN. Persichitti was born in a coal mining town outside Pittsburgh, Stewart said, describing his friend Bob\u2019s \u201chumble, poor beginnings.\u201d After the war, Persichitti worked as a carpentry teacher in Rochester, New York, according to the Veterans Hall of Fame, and in 1972 received a degree from SUNY Buffalo. Persichitti enjoyed traveling and speaking with younger generations about his experiences, often visiting schools to talk with students about World War II, his friend, Pastor William Leone, told WHAM. \u201cIt was a privilege to know him, and I will miss him,\u201d Leone told the station. Persichitti was one of the few surviving Americans who served in World War II, a population that is rapidly waning. As of 2023, just 119,550 of the 16.4 million who served \u2013 less than one percent \u2013 were still alive, according to the National WWII Museum in New Orleans. At that time, about 131 World War II veterans were dying each day, the museum said. US President Joe Biden underscored this point Thursday, telling those gathered at this year\u2019s D-Day commemoration in Normandy that it may be the last to involve living veterans. That fact, he said, should push Americans to continue the fight against tyranny. \u201cWe\u2019re not far off from the time when the last living voices of those who fought and bled on D-Day will no longer be with us,\u201d Biden said. \u201cSo we have a special obligation.

{"id": "2024_06_07_business_kia-recalling-463000-telluride-suvs", "text": "Kia is warning owners of almost 463,000 of its popular Telluride SUVs in the United States to keep them parked outside and away from buildings because the front seats could start burning. Seat control switches on the front power seats of the SUVs can become misaligned and stuck if they\u2019re hit hard by something, according to recall documents filed with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. If that happens, a small electric motor that moves the seat can run continuously and overheat. The recall involves 2020 through 2024 Kia Telluride models. The Telluride, a roomy SUV with three rows of seats, has been an extremely popular model for the Korean automaker. Designed in California and built in Georgia, the Telluride was created specifically to appeal to Americans. When it first came out, dealers were unable to keep enough in stock for customers. The problem was first noticed by Kia in 2022 when a customer reported smoke coming from under their Telluride\u2019s driver seat, according to a timeline Kia provided NHTSA. In 2023, another customer complained of a smoke smell from the passenger-side power seat, which wasn\u2019t working. Other similar cases were reported later that year. In 2024, at least one Kia owner reported that the driver\u2019s seat caught fire while they were driving. There have been no accidents or injuries as a result of the problem, according to Kia. An investigation by Kia concluded that the problem was with the power seat switches that could be damaged in a way that causes its motor to overheat. Kia will send recalled vehicle owners letters, starting at the end of July, asking them to bring their SUVs to a Kia dealership for repairs \u2014 at no cost. Service technicians at the dealers will install reinforcements and improved switches to prevent the seats from burning. Owners who suspect their Telluride might be involved can also call Kia customer service at 1-800-333-4542. Kia recalled more than 400,000 Tellurides earlier this year for a separate problem that could allow them to roll away while in park.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/07/business/kia-recalling-463000-telluride-suvs/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_05_us_brooklyn-man-arrested-illegal-betting-scheme-jontay-porter", "text": "A Brooklyn man was charged with conspiring with three others to defraud a sports betting company by using inside information from an NBA player to successfully bet on the performance of that player, who was later banned from the league, according to a federal complaint filed this week. Long Phi Pham is accused of conspiring with others who bet the player would underperform in a January 26 game and a March 20 game, the document signed by an FBI agent says. Pham and the others knew the player planned to withdraw from those games for purported health reasons, thus rendering those \u201cunder\u201d proposition bets successful, the criminal complaint says. The complaint refers to the player as \u201cPlayer 1,\u201d though after a review of court documents, CNN has determined the player is former Toronto Raptors big man\u00a0Jontay Porter, who two months ago was banned for life from the NBA. Proposition bets, also known as prop bets, can refer to wagers on individual statistics, and betting the \u201cunder\u201d means someone bet that the stat in question would be less than a figure proposed ahead of time by a sports betting company. Pham \u2013 who had been arrested Monday at an New York airport where he authorities say he was about to take a flight to Australia \u2013 appeared in court Tuesday. He initially was ordered detained pending trial, prosecutors in the Eastern District of New York said in a news release, noting that three co-conspirators charged in the scheme remain at large. The names of those three people were redacted in the complaint. In a bail hearing Wednesday, a judge said Pham could be released on a $750,000 bond with home detention and electronic monitoring, once surety for the bond is secured, US attorney\u2019s office spokesperson Danielle Hass said. CNN has sought comment from Pham\u2019s attorney, Michael Soshnick. CNN also has sought comment from a representative for Porter. \u201cWhether on the court or in the casino, every point matters. As alleged, the defendant and his co-conspirators, as well as an NBA player, participated in a brazen, illegal betting scheme that had a corrupting influence on two games and numerous bets,\u201d US Attorney Breon Peace said. \u201cThis prosecution serves as a warning that fraud and dishonesty in professional sports will not be tolerated and those who engage in this flagrant flouting of the law will be prosecuted.\u201d Complaint alleges player told gamblers he would come out of games early The player had significant gambling debts, the court document says, citing text messages, cell phone records and wire transfer evidence. To clear those debts, Pham and others encouraged him to withdraw early from certain games so certain bets on game activities like how many points he scored would be successful, authorities allege. Shortly before the January 26 game, the player told the defendants through a Telegram group chat he would remove himself early from the contest, claiming he was injured, according to the court document. He played just over four minutes in that contest, the court document reads. \u201cAfter playing just four minutes \u2026 and recording zero points, three rebounds and one assist, Player 1 removed himself from the game after he complained to team officials that he had reaggravated\u201d a previous eye injury, prosecutors said. The player communicated a similar message to the defendants before the March 20 game, telling them he would claim to be ill, according to the complaint. The documents say he played three minutes in that game. On April 4, in a group chat with the player, Pham and other defendants, the player wrote the group \u201cmight just get hit w a rico\u201d and asked whether the group had \u201cdelete(d) all the stuff\u201d from their personal cell phones, according to the complaint. The FBI agent believed \u201cthese messages refer to Player 1\u2019s concerns that he and certain of the co-conspirators would be criminally investigated for, among other things, violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act,\u201d known as RICO, \u201cand needed to delete any evidence on their personal cell phones,\u201d the agent wrote in the court document. Porter was banned by the NBA in mid-April, with the league saying an investigation found Porter had violated betting rules. NBA said it investigated unusual betting patterns around Porter The NBA announced in March it had opened an investigation into anomalies involving bets pertaining to Porter after unusual betting patterns around the player emerged. Porter had \u201cviolated league rules by disclosing confidential information to sports bettors, limiting his own participation in one or more games for betting purposes, and betting on NBA games,\u201d NBA officials said. When Porter\u2019s ban was announced, NBA commissioner Adam Silver said Porter was receiving the \u201cmost severe punishment.\u201d \u201cThere is nothing more important than protecting the integrity of NBA competition for our fans, our teams and everyone associated with our sport, which is why Jontay Porter\u2019s blatant violations of our gaming rules are being met with the most severe punishment,\u201d Silver said in a release.
