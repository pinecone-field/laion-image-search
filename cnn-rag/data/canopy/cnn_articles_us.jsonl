{"id": "2024_07_15_us_california-schools-parents-pronouns", "text": "Sacramento, California (AP) \u2014 California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a first-in-the-nation law Monday barring school districts from passing policies that require schools to notify parents if their child asks to change their gender identification. The law bans rules requiring school staff to disclose a student\u2019s gender identity or sexual orientation to any other person without the child\u2019s permission. Proponents of the legislation say it will help protect LGBTQ+ students who live in unwelcoming households. But opponents say it will hinder schools\u2019 ability to be more transparent with parents. The law comes amid a broader debate over local school districts and the rights of parents and LGBTQ+ students. \u201cPolitically motivated attacks on the rights, safety, and dignity of transgender, nonbinary, and other LGBTQ+ youth are on the rise nationwide, including in California,\u201d Democratic Assemblymember Chris Ward, who authored the law, said in a statement. \u201cWhile some school districts have adopted policies to forcibly out students, the SAFETY Act ensures that discussions about gender identity remain a private matter within the family.\u201d The new law comes after several school districts in California passed policies requiring that parents be notified if a child requests to change their gender identification. That led to\u00a0pushback by Democratic state officials, who say students have a right to privacy. But Jonathan Zachreson, an advocate in California who supports the so-called parental notification policies, opposes the law and said telling parents about a student\u2019s request to change their gender identification is \u201ccritical to the well-being of children and for maintaining that trust between schools and parents.\u201d States across the country have sought to\u00a0impose bans on gender-affirming care, bar\u00a0transgender athletes\u00a0from girls\u2019 and women\u2019s sports, and require schools to out trans and nonbinary students to their parents. Some lawmakers in other states have introduced bills with\u00a0broad language requiring that parents be notified\u00a0of any changes to their child\u2019s emotional health or well-being. The California law led to heated debate in the state legislature. LGBTQ+ lawmakers have shared stories about how it was difficult for them to decide when to come out to their families, arguing that transgender students should be able to share that part of their identity on their own terms. State Assemblymember Bill Essayli, a Republican representing part of Riverside County, is an outspoken opponent of the law. He has criticized Democratic leaders for preventing a bill he introduced last year \u2014 that would have required parents to be notified of their child\u2019s gender identification change \u2014 from receiving a hearing. In Northern California, the Anderson Union High School District board approved a parental notification policy last year. But the teachers union recommended that teachers not enforce the rule while the union is involved in a labor dispute with the district over the policy, said Shaye Stephens, an English teacher and president of the teachers association at the district. The notification policies put teachers in an unfair position, Stephens said. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of a lose-lose situation for teachers and administrators or anybody that\u2019s being asked to do this. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s safe for students,\u201d she said. \u201cI do not think that we are the right people to be having those conversations with a parent or a guardian.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/15/us/california-schools-parents-pronouns/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/16/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_07_14_us_trump-shooting-thomas-matthew-crooks-intl-hnk", "text": "Authorities have identified the gunman involved\u00a0in the attack against former US President Donald Trump on Saturday as 20-year-old\u00a0Thomas Matthew Crooks, who was killed by Secret Service agents at the scene after the shooting. The FBI named Crooks in a statement early Sunday morning, identifying him as a resident of\u00a0Bethel Park, Pennsylvania \u2013 about 35 miles south of Butler, where Trump was holding his rally. Crooks fired on Trump while perched on a nearby building rooftop outside the rally\u2019s security perimeter, before being killed by the Secret Service, according to law enforcement officials. Witnesses at the rally described a \u201cbloody\u201d and chaotic scene, with people trying to administer first aid to those hit by the gunfire and struggling with the dense crowd. The shooting left one rally attendee dead and two others in critical condition, authorities said. Trump was injured, writing on social media that he\u2019d been hit by a bullet in the upper part of his ear \u2013 though his campaign said he was otherwise fine. Trump flew back to Newark, New Jersey, late Saturday night. Now attention turns to the active and ongoing investigation, which involves multiple federal and state bodies. The FBI has urged members of the public to submit any information they have through a tip line or the agency website, including photos or videos of the shooting. Crooks graduated from Bethel Park High School in 2022, according to a local media\u00a0report\u00a0and a\u00a0video\u00a0of the school\u2019s commencement. He was registered to vote as a Republican,\u00a0according to a listing in Pennsylvania\u2019s voter database that matched his name, age, and a Bethel Park address that law enforcement was searching Saturday night and is linked to Crooks in public records. This year\u2019s presidential election would have been the first he was old enough to vote in. Federal Election Commission records show that a donor listed as Thomas Crooks with the same address gave $15 to a Democratic-aligned political action committee called the Progressive Turnout Project in January 2021. When reached by CNN late Saturday night, Crooks\u2019 father, Matthew Crooks, said he was trying to figure out \u201cwhat the hell is going on\u201d but would \u201cwait until I talk to law enforcement\u201d before speaking about his son. After being killed at the scene, Crooks didn\u2019t have any identification on his body, so agents\u00a0had to\u00a0\u201crun his DNA and get biometric confirmation,\u201d Kevin Rojek, the\u00a0special\u00a0agent in charge of the\u00a0FBI\u2019s\u00a0Pittsburgh\u00a0field\u00a0office, said at a press conference Saturday night\u00a0before the gunman was named.

The group also stated that it wants to\u00a0protect artists\u2019 rights and compensation for their work, especially in the age of artificial intelligence. \u201cDisney was our target due to how it handles artist contracts, its approach to AI, and its pretty blatant disregard for the consumer,\u201d the hacking group said over email.

For example, in June the group posted on X what appears to be visitor, booking and revenue data at Disneyland Paris. Artificial intelligence was a major sticking point in negotiations during\u00a0Screen Actors Guild and the Writers Guild of America strikes.

{"id": "2024_07_15_media_social-media-assassination-conspiracy-theories", "text": "Saturday\u2019s shooting at a Donald Trump rally was the first assassination attempt of a US presidential candidate in the age of social media \u2013 and\u00a0the former president had barely been hit before the internet was abuzz with all sorts of unsubstantiated explanations for what had, or had not, occurred. The moments of uncertainty created an information void that was quickly filled by speculation, misinformation and conspiracy theories. At the same time, the social media industry has broadly retreated from efforts to clamp down on misinformation. That retrenchment left the door wide open for false and misleading claims by both Trump supporters and opponents. The ease at which false rumors and conspiracy theories rapidly spread on social media threatens the public\u2019s ability to sort truth from fiction. It sometimes influences their behavior and further divides an already fractured America. The deluge of disinformation surrounding the Trump shooting shows, once again, that this problem isn\u2019t going away anytime soon. With less than four months until Election Day, the leading social media platforms appear resigned to let the status quo fester. Conspiracy theories spread wildly Almost immediately after Trump was injured during a shooting at a Butler, Pennsylvania, rally Saturday evening, a conspiracy theory emerged that the assassination attempt had been \u201cstaged\u201d \u2013 that Trump and his campaign had set it up to orchestrate the iconic photos of a resolute Trump surviving an attempt on his life. The term \u201cstaged\u201d began trending on X as soon as an hour after the shooting. The incident was not staged. The US Secret Service has now described it as an assassination attempt and the Department of Homeland Security has acknowledged it as a \u201cfailure\u201d of security. Still, on Monday, the false claim continued to circulate. \u201cI mean it\u2019s a little weird that this is America, and shooters don\u2019t miss unless they are hired to,\u201d a TikTok user with almost 4 million followers said in a video posted over the weekend, before going on to falsely suggest the Secret Service were involved in staging the shooting. By Monday the video had been viewed more than 8 million times, and \u201cliked\u201d more than 1.2 million times. To bolster the \u201cstaged\u201d conspiracy theory, an image began to circulate that had been altered to make it look like one of the Secret Service agents who rushed to Trump\u2019s aid was smiling during the incident. An influential anti-Trump X user who has almost 250,000 followers on the platform shared the image with the message, \u201cEveryone here seems to be having a good time, laughing and smiling for the cameras.\u201d The image was soon debunked by the fact-checking organization Lead Stories, which said it was a digitally manipulated version of an Associated Press image. \u201cThe officers cannot be seen smiling with their teeth as seen in the original, nor in any other news outlets photos of the event,\u201d Lead Stories explained in a blog post. Some prominent Trump supporters, meanwhile, posted their own conspiracy theories. Some suggested, without evidence, that the shooting had occurred because of deliberate negligence on the part of the Secret Service. Others, including elected Republican lawmakers, falsely tried to suggest President Joe Biden or his administration had some role in the attempted assassination. One X user with almost 3 million followers posted a video of the deceased shooter and wrote, \u201cRough day for this CIA officer\u201d \u2013 a baseless insinuation that the intelligence agency had a role in the attempted assassination. Biden has ordered a review of the Secret Service\u2019s\u00a0security protocols in light of the assassination attempt, and the agency has pledged to cooperate with all investigations. Consequences for inaction The reasons people share conspiracy theories are varied. Some do so in a cynical attempt to undermine or attack people who do not share their political point of view. Others get in on the act for social media clout \u2013 viral posts can translate into dollars for some online influencers. Social media companies including Meta, YouTube, TikTok and X didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment. The enormous temptation to share false claims is being actively rewarded by platforms such as X, formerly Twitter, where owner Elon Musk has made multiple interlocking decisions around account verification, payments to creators, and whom to allow on the platform that have facilitated a noisier and less trustworthy information ecosystem, misinformation researchers have long said. Musk partook in the proliferation of misleading material, sharing a post Sunday that claimed mainstream media outlets were peddling \u201cpure propaganda\u201d about the shooting. As evidence of supposedly biased coverage, Musk cherry-picked some of the earliest press reports about the incident, which referred to \u201cloud noises\u201d and \u201cpopping noises\u201d at the rally. Those were carefully worded initial bulletins that were later updated to reflect that a \u201cshooting\u201d had indeed taken place. But the Trump shooting and its aftermath may be an even bigger indictment of Meta\u2019s decision this year to stop promoting news, politics and social issues in its curated content feeds. At the time, the move was seen as potentially helpful for preventing users from going down algorithmically recommended rabbit holes, but it also triggered predictions that the policy could pose problems during an election year. Saturday\u2019s shooting has vividly illustrated the consequences of that decision, as users expressed frustration that mentions of the incident could not immediately be found on Threads, in direct contrast to X where conspiratorial thinking was flowing freely. The Verge reported Saturday that Meta did appear to be surfacing news reports about the shooting in Facebook search results, and that it inconsistently showed conspiracy-related content at the top of its trending topic on Threads for the incident. Meta\u2019s move to stop amplifying news in user feeds may be the right one for shareholders as executives have come to view moderating that type of content as an unsustainable business cost, said Laura Edelson, an assistant professor of computer science at Northeastern University and the co-director of Cybersecurity for Democracy, a research group focused on digital misinformation. But it may have come at the cost of society writ large. \u201cWhat this leads to is, on Threads, there\u2019s just not very much of either authoritative news or non-authoritative news compared to other platforms because of the nature of the algorithm,\u201d Edelson said. \u201cAnd then people just switch over to other platforms where they can get stuff, and so like on Twitter, there\u2019s a bunch of crazy conspiracy theories getting actively recommended by the Twitter algorithm.\u201d TikTok is also currently a major vector for misinformation about the shooting, Edelson added, because the app\u2019s algorithm promotes content \u201cabout the things that people are asking about, even if they do it in a really irresponsible way.\u201d Meta\u2019s decision to pull back from promoting credible news content in feeds, along with the constant press of unverified and misleading claims on other social media platforms and the comparatively slow drip of confirmed reporting from major news outlets, all appear to have combined to create the perfect conditions for a misinformation maelstrom. The situation calls for more rigorous regulation of social media, Edelson said, but it also offers a lesson for mainstream journalists: Don\u2019t just report what we do know, but also report the outstanding unanswered questions so that the public won\u2019t fill in the gaps with junk information. News outlets \u201cshould be running stories about, \u2018Here are the questions people have, and here\u2019s how we\u2019re trying to find out about them.\u2019 \u2026. Maybe people don\u2019t like to read those stories, but if you don\u2019t write those stories, then what people will do is they will just scroll down one more video to someone who\u2019s going to speculate about how this guy was probably, like, fed information by the FBI.\u201d CNN\u2019s Sean Lyngaas contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/15/media/social-media-assassination-conspiracy-theories/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/16/2024", "section": "us"}}

{"id": "2024_06_08_us_rust-shooting-timeline-alec-baldwin", "text": "Actor Alec Baldwin and several crew members gathered in a church at a New Mexico ranch on October 21, 2021, to rehearse a scene from their upcoming Western film \u201cRust.\u201d Then came the unexpected gunshot. A promising cinematographer was killed, a director was wounded and a film production was left in shambles. Since that day\u2019s fatal shooting of 42-year-old Halyna Hutchins, the film\u2019s armorer and its assistant director have been convicted of criminal charges. After nearly three years of back-and-forth legal arguments, Baldwin\u2019s trial on the involuntary manslaughter charge began on July 10 with opening statements but ended abruptly on July 12, when the judge ruled prosecutors did not properly turn over evidence to the defense, and dismissed the charges. The details of what happened the day of the shooting have been made public in affidavits, probable cause statements, interviews with the main participants and testimony at criminal trials. Here\u2019s a timeline of the on-set shooting and the resulting legal cases. The shooting May 29, 2020: Baldwin, the three-time Emmy winner for his roles on \u201c30 Rock\u201d and \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d was announced as producer and star of the Western feature film \u201cRust,\u201d based on a story by Baldwin and Joel Souza, Deadline reported. In the film, Baldwin plays a grizzled outlaw on the run from authorities with his 13-year-old grandson. October 6, 2021: Filming of \u201cRust\u201d began at Bonanza Creek Ranch, a movie set outside Santa Fe, New Mexico. October 20, 2021: Several crew members walked off set, citing safety concerns. One crew member stated there had been two accidental weapons discharges and a special effects mess-up that set off explosives around the crew between takes. October 21, 2021: Hannah Gutierrez Reed, the armorer for \u201cRust,\u201d loaded a prop six-shot revolver with what she believed were \u201cdummy\u201d rounds, a term for ammo that contains no explosive elements but appear to be real, according to investigators and her defense attorney. Baldwin and several crew members began rehearsing a scene in a rustic church on set before breaking for lunch. After the break, Baldwin, Souza, Hutchins and a few others returned to the church for rehearsal. Assistant director Dave Halls fetched a prop gun from a cart outside the church and yelled \u201ccold gun,\u201d indicating it was unloaded. He then handed the gun to Baldwin. Baldwin practiced a \u201ccross draw\u201d \u2013 pulling a gun from a holster on the opposite side of his body from his draw hand. The scene required him to point the gun toward the camera, helmed by Hutchins, Souza and a camera operator. Suddenly, they heard a loud bang. Hutchins stumbled backward, slumped to the floor clutching her stomach and said she couldn\u2019t feel her legs. Souza, who had been standing beside her, noticed blood on his shoulder. At 1:48 p.m., the crew reported the shooting to emergency responders. Hutchins was transported by air helicopter to the hospital and was pronounced dead at 3:37 p.m. Souza was treated at the hospital, and a projectile from a live round was removed from his back. Sheriff\u2019s deputies arrived to the scene and began investigating the series of events leading to the shooting. October 22, 2021: Baldwin released a statement calling the death a \u201ctragic accident\u201d and said he is fully cooperating with the police investigation. December 2, 2021: In an interview with ABC, Baldwin said he cocked the gun and let go of the hammer, and the gun then fired. He said he was aiming the gun just to the side of the camera toward Hutchins, as she instructed him to do. \u201cI would never point a gun at anyone and then pull the trigger, never,\u201d he said. The investigations August 14, 2022: FBI testing of the firearm found it could not be fired without pulling the trigger while the gun was cocked, according to a forensics report. The report noted the gun eventually malfunctioned during FBI testing after internal parts fractured, causing the gun to go off in the cocked position without pulling the trigger. August 20, 2022: In an interview with CNN, Baldwin\u00a0placed responsibility\u00a0for Hutchins\u2019 death on Gutierrez Reed, the film armorer and props assistant, and on assistant director Halls, who handed him the gun. October 5, 2022: The family of Hutchins and Baldwin reached an undisclosed settlement in a wrongful death lawsuit filed against the actor and others. As part of the settlement, Matthew Hutchins, the cinematographer\u2019s widower, was named an executive producer on \u201cRust.\u201d January 19, 2023: Prosecutors announced Baldwin and Gutierrez Reed will be charged with involuntary manslaughter in Hutchins\u2019 death. Halls, the assistant director, agreed to plead no contest to negligent use of a deadly weapon, the district attorney\u2019s office announced. The terms of that deal include six months of probation\u00a0and a suspended sentence, prosecutors said. January 31, 2023: Baldwin and Gutierrez Reed were formally charged with involuntary manslaughter. February 23, 2023: Baldwin pleaded not guilty to manslaughter charges and was released on personal recognizance. April 20, 2023: New Mexico special prosecutors dismissed the charges against Baldwin, citing \u201cnew facts\u201d in the case. \u201cThis decision does not absolve Mr. Baldwin of criminal culpability and charges may be refiled,\u201d they said. August 9, 2023: Gutierrez Reed pleaded not guilty to involuntary manslaughter and tampering with evidence. January 19: Baldwin was indicted by a grand jury on charges of involuntary manslaughter. January 31: Baldwin pleaded not guilty to involuntary manslaughter charges for the second time. The trials February 22: The trial of film armorer Gutierrez Reed began. Prosecutors alleged her failures allowed six live bullets to make their way on set, and she did not make vital safety checks that would have caught the problem. Her defense blamed Baldwin for failing to follow common-sense gun safety rules and on the film\u2019s production team for creating a chaotic and unsafe environment. March 1: Souza, the director and screenwriter, testified about the moment he was shot on set while standing behind Hutchins. March 6: Gutierrez Reed was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter after jurors deliberated for nearly three hours. She was acquitted of a charge of evidence tampering. April 15: At her sentencing hearing, Gutierrez Reed said, \u201cMy heart aches\u201d for Hutchins\u2019 family and friends, and she asked the judge to sentence her to probation. The judge criticized her statement and sentenced her to a maximum of 18 months in prison, saying, \u201cYou alone turned a safe weapon into a lethal weapon.\u201d May 24: A New Mexico judge denied Baldwin\u2019s motion to dismiss the involuntary manslaughter indictment. Baldwin\u2019s attorneys had accused prosecutors of misconduct during the grand jury process. June 3: New Mexico prosecutors asked the court to grant use immunity to Gutierrez Reed and compel her to testify at Baldwin\u2019s trial, according to court documents. Gutierrez Reed invoked her Fifth Amendment right to silence in a pre-trial interview, and prosecutors said if she is not granted immunity then she would not be able to testify in the trial. Gutierrez Reed\u2019s attorney, Jason Bowles, told CNN he will oppose the motion. June 17: Prosecutors signaled their intention to portray Baldwin as repeatedly flouting safety protocols on the movie set in the days before the fatal shooting, according to\u00a0a court filing. June 21: Judge Mary Marlowe Sommer denied a defense motion asking the court to dismiss the involuntary manslaughter indictment. The defense had argued the shooting death was an accident and Baldwin was \u201cnot criminally liable,\u201d but the prosecution countered Baldwin was experienced in the movie business and knew he was handling a real gun. The judge also denied the prosecution\u2019s motion to grant use immunity to Gutierrez Reed to compel her to testify at Baldwin\u2019s trial. June 28: The court denied a motion to dismiss the charges related to the gun that was damaged during forensic testing. Separately, attorneys for Gutierrez Reed in a court filing on June 27 accused prosecutors of withholding evidence that would have favored the defendant during her manslaughter trial and requested she be released from prison,\u00a0Reuters\u00a0reported. According to the filing obtained by Reuters, prosecutors had a report from their own weapons experts that the gun used on set had \u201cunexplained toolmarks on critical surfaces of the trigger and sear.\u201d July 3: Judge Sommer denied two motions filed by Baldwin\u2019s legal team alleging prosecutors had improperly handled evidence, paving the way for Baldwin\u2019s trial to start. July 8: The judge ruled Baldwin\u2019s role as a producer on the film \u201cRust\u201d would not be considered at trial. The prosecution had sought to show Baldwin had more responsibility and influence on the set than just as an actor, but the judge said the evidence was prejudicial and confusing to the jury. July 9: Twelve jurors and four alternates were empaneled in Santa Fe for Baldwin\u2019s trial. July 10: The trial of Baldwin on a charge of involuntary manslaughter began with opening statements. Prosecutors alleged Baldwin was reckless with firearms on set and violated the \u201ccardinal rules of firearm safety.\u201d \u201cHe pointed the gun at another human being, cocked the hammer and pulled that trigger, in reckless disregard for Ms. Hutchins\u2019 safety,\u201d prosecutor Erlinda Johnson said. The defense blamed the film\u2019s armorer and the first assistant director for allowing a live round to be loaded into the prop gun. \u201cThis was an unspeakable tragedy, but Alec Baldwin committed no crime. He was an actor, acting, playing the role of Harlan Rust. An actor playing a character can do things that are lethal,\u201d attorney Alex Spiro said. \u201cThese \u2018cardinal rules\u2019 are not cardinal rules on a movie set.\u201d July 12: The involuntary manslaughter case against Baldwin was dismissed in dramatic fashion after the judge overseeing the case ruled prosecutors did not properly turn over evidence to the defense. Sommer sided with the defense and dismissed the case with prejudice, meaning it cannot be brought again. \u201cThe state\u2019s discovery violation has injected a needless, incurable delay into the jury trial,\u201d she said. \u201cDismissal with prejudice is warranted to ensure the integrity of the judicial system and the efficient administration of justice. Your motion to dismiss with prejudice is granted.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/08/us/rust-shooting-timeline-alec-baldwin/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/16/2024", "section": "us"}}

Bettors raised their wagers that Trump will win the November election against President Joe Biden: A contract betting that Trump will win went for 68 cents on Monday, implying a 67% chance of the former president winning the election, according to election prediction market platform PredictIt.

Trump on Monday named US Ohio Sen. JD Vance as his running mate. A Trump win in November likely means the\u00a0preservation or expansion of tax cuts\u00a0and increased tariffs. During last month\u2019s presidential debate hosted by CNN, the former president reiterated his desire to impose a 10% tariff on all imports, which would likely increase inflation and cast doubt on interest rate cuts. Morgan Stanley research estimates that an expansion of the 2017 tax cuts would boost deficits sharply. While economic growth sounds positive for the US, some investors worry that it could reaccelerate inflation. The Federal Reserve has hiked interest rates to a painful 23-year high to tame wayward inflation, driving up borrowing costs for everything from mortgages to student loans to auto payments. While the central bank has signaled one rate cut for 2024, rates have yet to budge, as policymakers look for more signs that inflation is cooling. Economic expansion runs the risk of derailing the central bank\u2019s hard-fought progress. \u201cA second\u00a0Trump\u00a0presidency would mean expansionary economic stimulus in general, lower income taxes, less regulation, and increased tariffs,\u201d wrote Mark Malek, chief investment officer at Siebert Financial, in a Monday note. \u201cWith painful inflation still high but possibly on its way out, the economy is in a tender state in which too much growth too fast could lead to the re-igniting of 2022-like price growth spikes.\u201d As stocks settle after the trading day, levels might change slightly.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/15/markets/us-markets-trump/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/16/2024", "section": "us"}}

It\u2019s unclear what account posted the initial images. \u201cSince 2001 we take our shoes off in every airport because a terrorist attack in US soil. Now imagine getting into a @Delta flight and seeing workers with Hamas badges in the air. What do you do?\u201d the post read, falsely equating the Palestinian flag to the one flown by the militant group. Screenshots show that Delta\u2019s official account replied on Wednesday, writing, \u201cI hear you as I\u2019d be terrified as well, personally. Our employees reflect our culture and we do not take it lightly when our policy is not being followed.\u201d\u00a0That post has since been deleted, and it wasn\u2019t clear what policy the post was referencing. The reply sparked a swift backlash from Delta employees and leaders in Palestinian and Muslim communities. Azka Mahmood, executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations chapter in Georgia, where the airline is based, said in a statement that conflating the Palestinian national symbol to Hamas \u201cerases the existence and legitimacy of the entirety of Palestine.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cThe Palestinian flag represents a country and national aspirations of over 7 million Palestinians,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is clear that some groups want to delegitimize the flag of Palestine entirely, suppress any expression of the existence of Palestine, and discourage open support for Palestinian rights.\u201d\u00a0  A Delta spokesperson said the flight attendants pictured were compliant with the company\u2019s current uniform guidelines and the company has contacted them to offer support. Both flight attendants remain employed by the company, the spokesperson said.\u00a0  However, effective Monday, the company will only allow US flag pins to be worn, Delta told CNN. The move is a departure from previous policies that allowed pins representing countries and nationalities from around the world to be displayed, according to the spokesperson. Mahmood criticized the change to the uniform policy, noting that it \u201cerodes (Delta employees\u2019) freedom of expression.\u201d \u201cWe should be concerned that this policy change has come about in response to negative attention related to Palestine in particular. It speaks volumes that in the past flight attendants have been able to sport pins showing solidarity with Ukraine, for instance, without any issue,\u201d she said. \u201cDelta should stand by its employees\u2019 right to free speech and expression rather than caving to pressure.\u201d On Thursday, a group of Delta employees working to unionize\u00a0posted an open letter\u00a0they sent\u00a0to the company\u2019s CEO, demanding a public apology for the post. \u201cFor decades, it has been common practice for crew members to wear pins reflecting their heritage. The strength of diversity at network airlines is celebrated as a reflection of the places and people we connect around the world,\u201d the\u00a0group\u00a0said in its letter.\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cEveryone should be able to freely express their pride and support for their heritage without encountering hostility or discrimination from employers or customers.\u201d Following the incident, civil rights activist and American Islamic scholar Omar Suleiman \u2013 who has about 8 million followers across social media platforms \u2013 urged his followers to boycott Delta. In 2023, CAIR said it received the highest number of complaints of anti-Muslim bias in the organization\u2019s 30-year history, CNN previously reported. The civil rights group said nearly half of the complaints it has received occurred in the final three months of the year, after the October 7 Hamas attack on Israel. Mahmood maintains the numbers likely \u201cunderrepresent the true extent of anti-Muslim activity in the U.S.\u201d due to lack of knowledge on how to report incidents as well as some citizens \u201csimply accept[ing] it as part of life in the U.S.\u201d\u00a0 ", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/12/us/delta-employee-social-post-palestinian-reaj/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/16/2024", "section": "us"}}

Second Lt. John E. McLauchlen Jr., of Detroit, was killed during World War II in 1943 while flying during a bombing mission from Panagarh, India, to a railyard near Rangoon, Myanmar \u2013 then known as Burma, according to the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency. McLauchlen was officially accounted for on January 25, 2024, the agency said. He was buried at Fort Leavenworth National Cemetery on July 8 and honored with a B-1 bomber flyover, according to Fort Leavenworth. On December 1, 1943, McLauchlen\u2019s B-24J Liberator bomber plane reached the intended target but was struck by \u201canti-aircraft fire, causing the left wing to burst into flames,\u201d according to the accounting agency. \u201cMy uncle was in charge of the mission that day, so his plane was right in the front, right in the center,\u201d McLauchlen\u2019s nephew, Richard McLauchlen Jr., said in an interview with the US Army published Thursday. \u201cOnce they started taking fire, and with that smoking wing, my uncle decided to drop out of the formation so that his plane wouldn\u2019t cause anyone else to be shot down,\u201d Richard McLauchlen Jr., who is a Vietnam veteran, said. Witnesses from another plane said they saw the one flown by McLauchlen fall into a steep dive before disappearing beneath clouds, officials reported. \u201cIt was noted that (three) enemy aircraft were also seen following the crippled plane into the clouds, and no further contact was made with the Liberator,\u201d the agency said. \u201cThe remains of the crew were not recovered or identified after the war, and they were all later declared Missing In Action.\u201d McLauchlen served as a member of the 436th Bombardment Squadron, Seventh Bombardment Group in the Army Air Forces at the time of his disappearance. Four years later, the American Graves Registration Service found the remains of what were thought to be eight people involved in a potential B-24 Liberator crash near Yodayadet, Burma, according to the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency. The remains couldn\u2019t be identified scientifically at the time and were sent to Honolulu\u2019s National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific. The accounting agency said it received a family disinterment request in early 2019 for one of the unidentified people \u201cbased on past attempts to associate the remains with other unresolved losses from southern Burma,\u201d according to the release. The remains were exhumed in October 2020 and taken to a Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency laboratory for analysis, the agency said. Scientists used anthropological analysis and circumstantial and material evidence to identify McLauchlen, and the Armed Forces Medical Examiner System used mitochondrial DNA analysis. His nephew\u2019s DNA helped identify him, the US Army reported. \u201cHe was unknown for 80 years, and now he\u2019s here, he\u2019s home, and he\u2019ll never be lost again,\u201d Richard McLauchlen Jr. said of his uncle in the US Army interview. Genetic genealogy blends DNA analysis in the lab with genealogical research, such as tracing a person\u2019s family tree. Lauded as a way to explore personal history and connect with previously unknown kin, such DNA matching also has been used to link victims to criminals such as the Happy Face Killer, who murdered at least eight women, and to identify other long-missing military service members.

The shutdown of Kaspersky Lab\u2019s US operations will start on July 20, ending nearly two decades of the company operating in the country, according to the company\u2019s statement. \u201cThe company has carefully examined and evaluated the impact of the US legal requirements and made this sad and difficult decision as business opportunities in the country are no longer viable,\u201d Kaspersky Lab said. Independent journalist Kim Zetter first\u00a0reported\u00a0the news of the company\u2019s shutdown. The Commerce Department last month\u00a0announced\u00a0the ban of the sale and provision of Kaspersky software in the United States, citing national security concerns. US officials have claimed that the Russian government could use Kaspersky\u2019s popular anti-virus software to surveil Americans through hacking or data collection. Kaspersky has strenuously denied those claims. More than 400 million people and 240,000 companies worldwide use Kaspersky Lab\u2019s software products, according to the company. Just how many of those people and companies are in the United States is not clear. US government agencies were already banned from using Kaspersky\u00a0Lab software but the Commerce Department\u2019s move to prevent the sale of the software in the United States was unprecedented. The legal authorities cited by the Commerce Department are relatively new and derived in part from a 2021 executive order that President Joe Biden signed in the name of protecting Americans\u2019 personal data from \u201cforeign adversaries\u201d and a related order signed by then-President Donald Trump in 2019. CNN\u00a0reported\u00a0in April that the Commerce Department was taking action against Kaspersky Lab.

Kaspersky Lab\u2019s researchers, recognized as top-tier in the cybersecurity industry, are known for analyzing hacking operations suspected of being carried out by a variety of governments including Russia, the United States and Israel, but also cybercriminal threats that affect everyday users.

{"id": "2024_07_14_us_texas-houston-hurricane-beryl-damage", "text": "Texas Gov. Greg Abbott threatened to issue an executive order forcing electricity provider CenterPoint Energy to improve the reliability of its equipment and its level of storm preparedness if the company fails to address his concerns in the wake of deadly Hurricane Beryl. If CenterPoint does not comply with his request or provide sufficient information by July 31, the governor would \u201cimpose my own requirements on CenterPoint that are geared to keep power on through hurricane season until the next legislative session,\u201d Abbott said at a Sunday news conference. Power was knocked out in Houston and areas along the Texas Gulf Coast last Monday after the Category 1 hurricane, which left at least 10 dead. A week later, thousands are still waiting for power to be restored. People in southeast Texas have endured several days of hot weather without air conditioning as many look for safe drinking water, food and cool shelters. A 71-year-old woman near Crystal Beach died after her oxygen machine ran out of battery power and her generator shut down. Two deaths in the Houston area were attributed to carbon monoxide poisoning, and fire departments received more than 200 carbon monoxide poisoning calls, local officials said, warning residents to use generators safely amid the outages. The Public Utilities Commission of Texas will investigate CenterPoint Energy\u2019s response to the power outages, according to Chairman Thomas Gleeson. The power company\u2019s ability to maintain its infrastructure and its communication with customers has been called into question, Gleeson said at a Monday news conference. \u201cI\u2019ve also committed that we will bring to the legislature and the governor more long-term fixes to address these issues that will probably need statutory change,\u201d he said. CNN has reached out to CenterPoint officials for comment on the governor\u2019s statement and the new state investigation. Hundreds of thousands still without power As of Monday afternoon, more than 238,000 homes and businesses were without power across Texas, and more than 214,000 of those are CenterPoint customers, according to PowerOutage.us. CenterPoint has restored power to 1.9 million customers since Beryl hit, it said in a statement Sunday. The company expects to have electricity back on for 98% of affected customers by the end of the day Wednesday, it said in a Monday update. The governor called power companies\u2019 failure to provide their customers with power \u201ccompletely unacceptable.\u201d The governor singled out CenterPoint as having \u201crepeatedly failed to deliver power to customers for extended periods.\u201d \u201cI will work with legislators to craft laws to improve power reliability, but, and here\u2019s the important part, we are still in hurricane season right now, and solutions cannot wait until the next session,\u201d Abbott said. \u201cThey are needed now to minimize power disruptions as we respond to tropical weather for the remainder of the summer and this fall, to help avoid more power outages during the remainder of hurricane season.\u201d \u201cAlso, if CenterPoint does not comply, I will demand that the Public Utilities Commission reject CenterPoint\u2019s request to recover a profit and pending request before the public utilities commission,\u201d the governor added. Abbott also noted the utility admitted many of the outages caused by the hurricane were related to trees falling on power lines. \u201cCenterPoint is responsible for eliminating the vegetation before a hurricane hits,\u201d Abbott said. \u201cSome reports show that CenterPoint spends far less per customer on vegetation removal than some other power providers.\u201d The governor demanded the utility company eliminate all vegetation issues by the end of August. Abbott also noted the company claimed to have assembled thousands of additional lineman and other personnel to speed up the recovery process. However, he said some reports said many of those workers were slow to respond for various reasons. \u201cOne was training workers after the hurricane hit, rather than training those workers before the hurricane hit,\u201d Abbott said. \u201cAnother was positioning workers days after the hurricane was gone, rather than positioning those workers immediately after the hurricane left.\u201d He said the commission could reconsider the size of CenterPoint\u2019s territorial region if the company can\u2019t fix its ongoing issues. \u201cMaybe they have too large of an area for them to be able to manage adequately. It\u2019s time to reevaluate whether or not CenterPoint should have such a large territory,\u201d Abbott said. Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick also criticized the utility company at Sunday\u2019s news conference, saying the jobs of any CenterPoint employee, \u201cwhether you\u2019re at the top or any part of management who oversaw this response or preparation,\u201d would be on the line. \u201cI know everyone at CenterPoint who\u2019s in an air-conditioned office is watching; a freight train\u2019s coming. You just heard it. You better be prepared,\u201d Patrick said.\u00a0\u201cWe will not and cannot tolerate this.\u201d In its statement, CenterPoint said, \u201cOur top priority is restoring power to the remaining impacted customers as safely and quickly as possible. Dedicated restoration crews have continued working around-the-clock through the weekend, restoring power at the fastest rate in the company\u2019s history.\u201d The utility acknowledged customers\u2019 growing frustrations and committed to a review of its response for customers without power. \u201cWe have heard and understand our customers\u2019 frustrations, and we are committed to working together with the State, local government, regulators, and community leaders both to help the Greater Houston area recover from Hurricane Beryl and to improve for the future,\u201d the utility said. The Texas power grid was also a focal point in February 2021, after a massive statewide outage during a deep freeze left more than 200 people dead and millions without heat and power for days. The state\u2019s government has worked with local officials over the last week to provide ready-to-eat meals for people who have lost electricity in their homes, Abbott said. Officials are also working to ensure people have adequate water supplies and ice, and are addressing the ongoing medical needs at hospitals and health care facilities, according to the governor. \u201cMeals have been lost because people have not had the power on in their house or apartment, and as a result, their food has spoiled \u2026 because of lack of power,\u201d he said. \u201cThe lack of power is because of CenterPoint.\u201d CNN\u2019s Amy Simonson, Steve Almasy, Dalia Faheid\u00a0and\u00a0Taylor Galgano contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/14/us/texas-houston-hurricane-beryl-damage/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/16/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_07_10_us_dwight-jackson-employment-discrimination-lawsuit-reaj", "text": "A Black man has filed an employment discrimination lawsuit against a hotel in Detroit, Michigan, alleging the hotel only offered him a job interview after he changed the name on his resume, according to a copy of the lawsuit obtained by CNN. Dwight Jackson filed the lawsuit against the Shinola Hotel on July 3, alleging he was denied a job when he applied as \u201cDwight Jackson,\u201d but later offered an interview when he changed his name to \u201cJohn Jebrowski.\u201d The lawsuit alleges Jackson was denied a job in \u201cviolation of Michigan Elliott Larsen Civil Rights Act.\u201d Between January and April 2024, Jackson, a 27-year-old Black man, applied to multiple positions at the Shinola Hotel in downtown Detroit, including a role in reception, according to the lawsuit. On its website, Shinola Hotel says it is a \u201cluxury\u201d hotel. Jackson\u2019s attorney, Jon Marko, provided CNN with a copy of Jackson\u2019s resume, which details consistent employment, including previous roles as a \u201cFront Desk Agent\u201d at Detroit\u2019s Marriott Westin Book Cadillac and David Whitney Hotel, which use the words luxury and luxurious to describe their respective hotels. \u201cMr. Jackson had applied for a job that he was eminently qualified for,\u201d Marko, a civil rights attorney, told CNN. However, Shinola Hotel did not offer Jackson an interview. After getting no response to his initial job applications, in April 2024 Jackson applied again, making one significant change to his application \u2014 his name. According to the lawsuit, Jackson applied to Shinola Hotel \u201ctwice for similar positions under a more readily apparent Caucasian name, with the alias \u2018John Jebrowski,\u2019\u201d using nearly identical resumes. The resumes have different dates of previous employment. He was offered multiple interviews within the same week, the lawsuit claims. The lawsuit alleges that \u201cJackson established that the Defendant\u2019s consideration of candidates was based on the racial appearance of the applicant\u2019s name.\u201d \u201cTo be denied a job in 2024 in your hometown, for the color of your skin, goes beyond dollars and cents. It goes into the psyche of a person,\u201d Marko said. Sage Hospitality Group is Shinola Hotel\u2019s operating partner. Anna Stancioff, Sage Hospitality\u2019s Senior Corporate Director of PR & Brand Communications and spokesperson for the hotel said in an email Tuesday, \u201cWe take this allegation very seriously and do not tolerate discrimination of any kind. We are committed to fostering an inclusive workplace where everyone has the opportunity to succeed and are dedicated to building a diverse workforce that reflects the community.\u201d According to Marko, Jackson attended the job interview and confronted the interviewer at Shinola Hotel. He revealed his real identity and expressed his belief that he was not given an interview initially because his name appeared more traditionally African American. \u201cShortly after Jackson underwent the interview process, he was informed that he was no longer a viable candidate for the position,\u201d the lawsuit states. Marko said employment discrimination is not unusual. He added, as a civil rights attorney, \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a lot of discrimination in hiring, especially when it comes to the exclusion of minorities and individuals who have minority-sounding names.\u201d A recent\u00a0study published by the National Bureau of Economic Research\u00a0found that name bias is a prevalent issue in the hiring process. Researchers sent out identical resumes to 108 U.S. employers to analyze whether race and gender affected callback rates for job applications. Resumes with Black male and Black female names received the fewest callbacks. But, Marko said, proving cases of name bias is extremely challenging and most of these cases never get off the ground due to a lack of evidence. Jackson\u2019s case is different, he said, because he applied twice for similar positions with nearly the exact same resume and it yielded different results when he used the alias. Marko said Jackson \u201cwants to shed light on this problem that\u2019s not just isolated at the Shinola Hotel, not just isolated in Detroit or Michigan, but across the country. He wants to make sure that it doesn\u2019t happen to anyone else.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/10/us/dwight-jackson-employment-discrimination-lawsuit-reaj/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/16/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_07_12_us_louisiana-truck-driver-baby-rescue-beryl", "text": "A truck driver found a 1-year-old alive in a ditch off an interstate highway in Louisiana this week, a day after the boy\u2019s 4-year-old brother was found dead near the same freeway in what investigators think was a case of abandonment around the time tropical storm conditions hit the area, authorities said. The boys\u2019 mother, a Louisiana resident, has been arrested in Mississippi and faces murder and other charges, accused of abandoning the children in Louisiana, authorities said Thursday. A Louisiana sheriff, who says he believes the 1-year-old spent two days along Interstate 10, including while Hurricane Beryl or its weaker iterations battered the western Gulf Coast region with rain and strong wind \u2013 is praising the truck driver for seeing the child and stopping to pick up him up Tuesday. \u201cWe look at this 1-year-old as our miracle baby, (because) he was still alive,\u201d Calcasieu Parish Sheriff Stitch Guillory said this week. \u201cThis kid spent two days out in the weather on the side of the highway. \u2026 Thank God that trucker (saw) him.\u201d An investigation began Monday afternoon, when the 4-year-old boy\u2019s body was found floating in water behind a rest stop off I-10 in western Louisiana\u2019s Calcasieu Parish, just across the Texas state line, the sheriff\u2019s office said. No cause of death was immediately announced. That day, Beryl made landfall in Texas as a hurricane and weakened to a tropical storm and tropical depression as it impacted Louisiana, dropping rain and delivering wind gusts of up to 60 mph to the parish, CNN meteorologists say. Detectives eventually learned the 4-year-old had last been seen on Saturday with his mother, Aaliyah Jack, 25, of Lake Charles, and his 1-year-old brother, the sheriff\u2019s office said. Police in Meridian, Mississippi, then found Jack without the 1-year-old, and she was arrested there initially on suspicion of failing to report a missing child, authorities said. And on Tuesday morning, the 1-year-old turned up \u2013 alive \u2013 along I-10 back in Louisiana, authorities said. \u2018That looks like a baby\u2019 Truck driver Reginald Walton was driving on I-10 when he saw something \u201cto the right, over in the \u2026 embankment,\u201d he told CNN affiliate KADN, adding that he assumed it was a doll that someone had tossed out of a vehicle. \u201cBut as I was passing by, I saw it move, and I say, \u2018Hey, that looks like a baby,\u2019\u201d Walton, of Texas, told KADN. Walton was traveling 60-75 mph, and it took him about a quarter of a mile to stop the truck, he said. He called 911, stopped the truck and ran back, he told KADN. \u201cSure enough, there was a little boy sitting down the embankment there. As I approached him, he smiled at me, and then he stood up and started crying and walked toward me,\u201d Walton said. The 1-year-old was found near mile marker 10 \u2013 about 9 miles from the rest stop where his brother had been found dead the day before, the sheriff\u2019s office said. Deputies identified the boy as Jack\u2019s 1-year-old son. He was taken to a hospital and later released to the state Department of Children and Family Services, Calcasieu Parish Sheriff\u2019s Office spokesperson Kayla Vincent told CNN. On Thursday, Jack \u2013 still in custody in Mississippi \u2013 was charged in Louisiana with second-degree murder, cruelty to a juvenile and two counts of failure to report a missing child, the sheriff\u2019s department said. It is unknown if she has an attorney. Though Guillory said he believed the 1-year-old spent two days along I-10 \u2013 which would have included Monday, as Beryl swept through the area \u2013\u00a0the sheriff\u2019s office has not said whether investigators know precisely when the siblings were left. Walton, meanwhile, told KADN he didn\u2019t feel like he was a hero. \u201cI just feel it was God\u2019s will for me to be in the right place at the right time,\u201d he told KADN. Grandmother: \u2018I just want my grandbaby back\u2019 Conswella Jack, Aaliyah Jack\u2019s mother and a grandmother to the children, told CNN the last time she saw the kids was Saturday at her mother\u2019s funeral, after which her daughter took them. Conswella Jack said she and her daughter had an agreement in which the grandmother would generally take care of the two boys, but Aaliyah Jack was free to see them whenever she wanted. Conswella Jack learned of her 4-year-old grandson\u2019s death on Tuesday after his paternal grandmother called to tell her, she said. Shortly after, a detective called her to confirm the death. She does not know what led up to the boy\u2019s death or how her 1-year-old grandson ended up on the side of the road, she told CNN. \u201cI don\u2019t know how anything like this occurred. \u2026 I know at this moment, I just want my grandbaby back,\u201d the grandmother said. Conswella was living in Houston when she heard the news, and has since relocated to Lake Charles, she said. She has been calling child protective services daily to receive updates on her surviving grandson, she said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to think. I buried my mother on Saturday, and now I learn this,\u201d Conswella Jack said. She described her 4-year-old grandson as \u201can awesome kid.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m sorry baby \u2026 that (you\u2019re) gone. So sorry,\u201d she said. The grandmother said Thursday she still had not spoken with her daughter to learn what happened and hoped to reunite with her surviving grandson soon.

{"id": "2024_07_14_politics_corey-comperatore-trump-shooting-victim", "text": "Friends and neighbors are remembering firefighter Corey Comperatore \u2013 the man shot and killed during the attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump \u2013 as a family man who served his community and was quick to help friends in need. Comperatore was one of the thousands of people who attended the rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, part of Trump\u2019s 2024 reelection effort. He died trying to protect his family, according to Gov. Josh Shapiro. Pennsylvania State Police confirmed his identity on Sunday. Authorities have\u00a0identified the gunman\u00a0in Saturday\u2019s\u00a0attack\u00a0as 20-year-old\u00a0Thomas Matthew Crooks, who was killed by Secret Service agents at the scene after the shooting. The FBI is investigating the attack as an assassination attempt, the agency said. Shapiro, who directed flags to be flown at half-staff in Comperatore\u2019s memory, said he spoke to Comperatore\u2019s wife and two daughters Sunday. An avid Trump supporter who was excited to be at the rally, Comperatore dove on his family to protect them from the gunfire, Shapiro said. \u201cCorey was a girl dad. Corey was a firefighter. Corey went to church every Sunday. Corey loved his community. Most especially, Corey loved his family,\u201d said Shapiro. In an interview with the New York Post on Monday, Helen Comperatore, the widow of Corey Comperatore, shared her husband\u2019s last words, spoken as he shielded his family from bullets that ultimately took his life. \u201cHe\u2019s my hero,\u201d Helen Comperatore said. \u201cHe just said, \u2018Get down!\u2019 That was the last thing he said.\u201d Mike Morehouse, who lived next to Comperatore for years, told the Associated Press he counts Comperatore as a hero and intends to vote in the upcoming election in his memory. \u201cAs soon as I heard what happened and then learned that it was to Corey, I went upstairs as soon as I got home and I registered to vote,\u201d Morehouse told the AP. \u201cThis is the first time I\u2019ve ever voted and I think it will be in his memory.\u201d In addition to Comperatore, two people were critically injured in the incident, according to Pennsylvania State Police. David Dutch, 57, of New Kensington, Pennsylvania, and James Copenhaver, 74, of Moon Township, Pennsylvania, are in stable condition, state police said Sunday in a news release. Dutch and Copenhaver are recovering at Allegheny General Hospital, according to hospital officials. The Marine Corps League of Pennsylvania, Inc. identified Dutch as a commandant in their organization\u2019s location in Westmoreland County. Vice Commandant Matt Popovich said on Facebook Dutch underwent two surgeries after being \u201cshot in the liver and chest.\u201d \u201cThese victims and their families are certainly in our thoughts today,\u201d said state police commissioner Col. Christopher Paris. \u201cThe Pennsylvania State Police continue to work tirelessly alongside our federal, state and local partners as this investigation continues.\u201d The former president was shot in his right ear, he said on social media, leaving his face covered in blood. A GoFundMe campaign for the victims\u2019 families, verified by the fundraising platform, had raised more than $4.5 million by Monday evening, more than triple its initial goal. More than 59,000 donations have poured in, according to the website. A separate GoFundMe campaign for Comperatore\u2019s family, also verified by the platform, collected more than $1 million by Monday evening. That campaign, organized by a man who described himself as a neighbor and friend, had an initial goal of $7,000. Helen Comperatore told the New York Post she and Corey were childhood sweethearts and about to celebrate their 29th\u00a0wedding anniversary when the family headed to the rally to support Trump. \u201cMe and the kids were all there as a family,\u201d she said. \u201cHe was just excited. It was going to be a nice day with the family.\u201d Describing her late husband to the newspaper as a \u201csimple man,\u201d Helen Comperatore said he put \u201chis wife and kids first all the time.\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t lift a finger,\u201d she said. \u201cHe did everything.\u201d She also told the New York Post President Joe Biden did try to call, but she doesn\u2019t want to speak to him. \u201cMy husband was a devout Republican, and he would not have wanted me to talk to him.\u201d However, Helen Comperatore added she does not hold the current president responsible for what happened to her family. \u201cI don\u2019t have any ill-will towards Joe Biden,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not one of those people that gets involved in politics. I support Trump, that\u2019s who I\u2019m voting for, but I don\u2019t have ill-will towards Biden.\u201d \u201cHe didn\u2019t do anything to my husband. A 20-year-old despicable kid did,\u201d she continued. The family has not heard from the former president, she added. Speaking Sunday afternoon, Biden expressed his condolences to Comperatore\u2019s family. \u201cWe also extend our deepest condolences to the family of the victim who was killed,\u201d the president said. \u201cHe was a father; he was protecting his family from the bullets being fired when he lost his life. God love him. We are also praying for the full recovery of those who were injured.\u201d A community in mourning The Buffalo Township Volunteer Fire Company hung Comperatore\u2019s uniform outside the fire station Sunday in a memorial to his life. \u201cOur company is dealing with a tragic loss that not only is affecting our members, but this community and Corey\u2019s family and friends,\u201d the fire company said on Facebook, also calling Comperatore \u201ca brother, son, husband, father and friend.\u201d Matthew Achilles, who lived near Comperatore, told CNN affiliate WTAE, \u201cHe was a real good guy. He really was. You hear stories all the time that it\u2019s always the good ones that end up getting taken out, and unfortunately, that\u2019s what happened.\u201d \u201cHe helped us out when I was real sick a couple years ago. I was in the hospital and almost died. Corey was one of the first people to message me and say \u2018Hey, how can I help you,\u2019\u201d Achilles said. Bishop David Zubik of the Catholic Diocese of Pittsburgh said in a statement, \u201cComperatore\u2019s selfless act in the face of danger speaks to his strength of character, deep faith, and dedication to serving others.\u201d \u201cLet us also take this moment to pray for unity and an end to violence and inflammatory rhetoric in our community and across our nation,\u201d he said. In the outpouring of sympathy, many have highlighted Comperatore\u2019s dedication to the community he served. \u201cCorey Comperatore died a hero, the way he lived, shielding his family from gunfire. He was a former\u00a0fire\u00a0chief, a proud father and loving husband.\u00a0We will pray for his family.\u00a0May he rest in peace,\u201d Robert\u00a0Brooks, president of the Pennsylvania Professional Fire Fighters Association, told CNN in a statement Sunday. The Buffalo Township Board of Supervisors condemned political violence in a statement to CNN Sunday. \u201cCorey was a dedicated husband, father, friend, and volunteer to the community, and will be sorely missed,\u201d the statement said. Shots fired, then \u2018a bloody scene\u2019 Witnesses have described a wave of chaos and terror that unfolded after the shooter, perched on a rooftop just outside the venue, fired several shots from an AR-style weapon. As shots rang out and the former president ducked below the podium, swarmed by Secret Service agents, attendees screamed and crouched toward the ground, video from the scene shows. \u201cIt was just the scariest thing, there was not a lot of places you could hide there,\u201d witness Amber DiFrischia told CNN. DiFrischia and her husband, Mike captured video of the moment the shooter fired his gun. The video shows the gunman laying on the rooftop with his weapon drawn, and eventually shows the gunman deceased. When the couple realized he had a gun, Amber said she immediately began yelling at officers and pointing to where he was located. The couple said many of the officers were too close to the building to see the gunman on the roof. Mike saw one officer attempt to climb onto the roof, but the officer eventually fell back to the ground. GOP Congressman Dan Meuser told CNN he was sitting in the front row of the rally with Pennsylvania Senate candidate Dave McCormick and Republican Rep. Mike Kelly. He saw a man fatally shot \u201cno more than 20 feet behind\u201d them, he said. Joseph Meyn, a surgeon from Grove City, Pennsylvania, told CNN he helped carry a man\u2019s body out of the stadium. \u201cEverybody started, certainly, screaming, asking for a medic, and honestly, it was a bloody scene,\u201d Meuser said. He was to the far right of the podium, filming Trump\u2019s speech, when he heard the gunshots. \u201cJust as I was panning back, I heard seven gunshots in rapid succession, in under two or three seconds. I am familiar with guns, I knew immediately it was gunfire,\u201d Meyn told CNN. \u201cI saw him get hit.\u201d Meyn said he looked back in the direction the gunshots had come from. \u201cI saw a man in the bleachers was hit directly in the head \u2026 there was a woman who was hit in the hand and forearm, a noncritical wound.\u201d He said he went over to see if he could render any aid, but another doctor was already tending to the woman who\u2019d been shot. \u201cI helped carry the body of the man out of the stands,\u201d he said. \u201cThey took the body to the tent behind the bleachers.\u201d Dr. Jim Sweetland,\u00a0a retired emergency room doctor, attempted to administer CPR on Comperatore. Sweetland told CNN he heard shots ring out and then \u201ca woman\u2019s voice cry out \u2018he\u2019s been shot. He\u2019s down.\u2019\u201d After performing CPR with the help of some bystanders, Sweetland looked up to see Comperatore\u2019s family and said the look on their faces \u201cis something I\u2019ll never forget.\u201d Sweetland said he wants to tell Comperatore\u2019s family, \u201cYour father died a hero.\u201d As he was leaving the rally, a combat vet stopped Sweetland and said, \u201cBrother, there\u2019s blood on your face, here\u2019s some water, you can wash your face off with it,\u201d the doctor recalled. \u201cThat was another American reaching out to help me after I tried to help Corey and to me that\u2019s what America is all about,\u201d he said. Republican Rep. Ronny Jackson of Texas said his nephew was also injured in the shooting. In an interview with Fox News, Jackson said his nephew \u201cwas grazed in the neck, a bullet crossed his neck, cut his neck and he was bleeding.\u201d The congressman called it a \u201chorrific, horrific experience.\u201d Another attendee who witnessed the shooting described an atmosphere of \u201ccomplete shock.\u201d \u201cIt was too close for comfort,\u201d Donna Hutz told CNN. She and her son were just a few rows in front of the attendees who were shot. She looked up and saw the injured attendees with lots of blood covering the bleachers, she said. The shooting created shockwaves around the world, with international leaders including Biden, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and the Vatican condemning the attack and political violence more broadly. Authorities are still investigating both the shooter\u2019s possible motives and how he was able to access the area with a weapon. \u201cIt is surprising, but all the details of that will come out in the investigation,\u201d FBI Special Agent in Charge Kevin Rojek said in a news conference when asked how the shooter was able to fire several shots.

{"id": "2024_07_13_us_cape-cod-dolphin-stranding-largest-us-history", "text": "The stranding of more than 140 dolphins off Cape Cod last month has been confirmed as the largest mass stranding of the mammals in United States history, animal rescuers say. A final review of data and aerial imagery of the mass stranding event near Wellfleet, Massachusetts, believed to have begun June 28, revealed 146 dolphins were involved, the International Fund for Animal Welfare announced Thursday. Wellfleet is located on Cape Cod\u2019s northeastern arm. The dolphins were found stranded in the shallow mud flats of Wellfleet in an area called the \u201cGut,\u201d or Great Island at the Herring River. \u201cWe believe 102 survived the multi-day event, which is (about) a 70% survival rate,\u201d according to Stacey Hedman, communications director for the global animal welfare and conservation non-profit, which rescues, rehabilitates and releases animals. Seven of the dolphins were euthanized and 37 died naturally, according to Hedman. The organization said last month the stranding of what was initially said to be around 125 Atlantic white-sided dolphins in the area could possibly be \u201cthe largest single mass stranding event\u201d in the organization\u2019s history, CNN previously reported. Dolphins, whales or porpoises are considered stranded \u201cwhen they are found dead, either on the beach or floating in the water, or alive on the beach and unable to return to the water,\u201d according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. \u201cThis rescue had many challenges due to the number of dolphins, the large size of many of the animals, how spread out they were over a large area, the difficult mud conditions and the complicated locations from which we could reach them,\u201d said Misty Niemeyer, stranding coordinator for the organization, in a statement last month. The organization said the mass stranding event was \u201cconsidered closed\u201d by July 8, by which time more than 100 dolphins had been returned to their homes in deeper waters. The satellite tracking tags attached to the dolphins showed they were swimming a safe distance away offshore, according to Hedman. \u201cWe have been receiving reports from whale watch vessels that have seen some of the dolphins \u2013 identified with temporary markings \u2013 now swimming among other groups of hundreds of other dolphins that had not been part of the stranding \u2013 a happy image!\u201d Hedman said. Although two prior events in Hawaii and Florida Keys show dolphin species circling in shallow water, the most recent occurrence marks the highest number of dolphins beached in a single stranding event, according to the organization. More dolphins get stranded along Cape Cod\u2019s 12-mile stretch of shoreline than any other location worldwide, according to the organization.

{"id": "2024_07_15_politics_private-efforts-biden-step-aside", "text": "The public calls from Democrats asking President Joe Biden to bow out of the presidential race have quieted in recent days, but private efforts to nudge the president and his top aides continue, several Democratic sources told CNN. Among the efforts, these sources say, are repeated memos from a seasoned and respected Democratic pollster, Stanley Greenberg, sharing his take that Biden is on track to lose the election \u2013 and in a way that does deep damage to other Democratic candidates. \u201cLose everything,\u201d is how one Democrat described a polling memo Greenberg sent to Biden\u2019s inner circle in recent days. \u201cDevastating,\u201d was the one word answer of a second Democrat close to the White House who is familiar with the Greenberg memos. These sources said Greenberg has sent several memos over the past two weeks since the president\u2019s devastating debate performance, analyzing internal polling he asserts shows the president\u2019s position continues to deteriorate because Americans overwhelmingly do not see him as up to serving four more years. Greenberg has been a leading Democratic pollster for decades and his work includes advising Bill Clinton\u2019s two winning presidential campaigns. He declined to comment when contacted Monday evening. Several Democratic members of Congress also have continued to lobby privately, these sources said, urging top Biden advisers to consider the damage to Biden\u2019s legacy if the president not only loses the White House but Republicans hold the House and capture the Senate majority. One Democratic lawmaker told CNN some top Biden aides get \u201cthe depth of this\u201d but believe it can be turned around and in any event describe the president as adamant in the belief he can win. In his NBC News interview Monday, for example, the president again made clear he has no intention of stepping aside. The lawmaker\u2019s view was that it was counterproductive to make additional public calls for Biden to step aside right now, because of the imperative of a unified party response to this week\u2019s Republican convention and because of the president\u2019s repeated public statements about staying in the race. But this Democrat predicted that approach would change if the polling and other data after the GOP convention showed the president\u2019s standing deteriorating more.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/15/politics/private-efforts-biden-step-aside/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/16/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_07_12_us_unchained-nonprofit-dogs-california-cnnheroes", "text": "Melissa Wolf\u2019s clients come in all shapes and sizes. Some have two legs, some have four. All of them need a second chance. Wolf is the founder of UnChained, a nonprofit in northern California that pairs vulnerable young people, often living in juvenile correction facilities, with abandoned or abused dogs that have been rescued from shelters. The youth learn to train the dogs in basic skills and better prepare them for adoption. The program\u2019s goal is twofold: decrease juvenile recidivism and save animals\u2019 lives. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of reciprocity between dogs and humans,\u201d Wolf said. \u201cThey experience joy and anger and fear and loneliness. Our kids often share very similar stories to the dogs, and we bring that into our classes.\u201d Wolf, who worked in social services for decades, noticed a trend in juvenile recidivism where rearrest rates among incarcerated youth can be as high as 75 percent within three years of release. At the same time, she was volunteering with local animal shelters and rescue groups, trying to keep adoptable animals from being euthanized. \u201cMany of our kids have experienced risk factors that have led them to the lives where they are,\u201d Wolf said. \u201cA lot of our kids come from maybe childhood trauma, it could be poverty, addiction, incarceration of parents or caregivers.\u201d Wolf says that when\u00a0young people in her program\u00a0can understand that they may share a similar story with a dog in need, and help that dog on a path to success, it can transform how they see themselves and their future. \u201cMost of the dogs didn\u2019t really catch my attention until I\u2019d seen this boxer named Quincy,\u201d one UnChained participant recounted. \u201cI learned a lot of social skills and how to control my emotions a lot. To be more focused, more attentive. \u2026 Working with Quincy, obviously seeing him get a second shot, actually gave me a little bit of hope.\u201d The power of the human-animal bond The eight-week program takes place in juvenile detention centers and schools. The students work alongside coaches, a professional dog trainer, and volunteer classroom assistants. A licensed mental health professional is on hand as well. The program fosters empathy, compassion, and responsibility as students train and build trust with their designated dog. At the end of the eight weeks, there is a graduation ceremony where adopters, parents, teachers, and even probation officers gather to celebrate the young people and canines alike. And students get to show guests what they\u2019ve taught their dog. \u201cYou\u2019ve got kids who have experienced a lot of trauma in their lives,\u201d Wolf said. \u201cAnd we get to go in with a blank slate. We just see these kids for who they are.\u201d UnChained, founded in 2011, was born from Wolf\u2019s own passion and personal experiences. When she was in her early 20s and working for a nonprofit in Texas, she was shocked by the animal neglect she witnessed in some areas. \u201cI saw dogs that were tied to trees and left outside with no water available,\u201d Wolf said. \u201cI saw a mother dog with five little puppies covered in mud, emaciated.\u201d Often, she tried to reason with the owner but was repeatedly met with resistance and even violence, she said. And when she called animal control, she was often told there were no legal actions she could take. She says that experience was the motivator to do something to help pets and people. By establishing an emotional connection and teaching young people about a dog\u2019s needs, Wolf says her team sees a change occur. It\u2019s a win-win for both the young person and the animal. \u201cThere is a lighting up of that child\u2019s eyes and face, and we start to see the magic that happens and the understanding by our kids that dogs experience feelings very similar to humans,\u201d she said. Futures filled with hope and possibility For Wolf, positive reinforcement is the key. Students learn from professional dog trainers and implement a clicker method where a dog is praised and rewarded for good behavior with a treat. Wolf says the program also helps its students learn to communicate in a positive way and develop leadership skills. \u201cIt\u2019s starting to shift this young person\u2019s way of thinking and believing and hopefully behaving.\u201d Wolf said. \u201cWhen we put a little bobble-headed chihuahua in the arms of a young man that may weigh 250 pounds, and see his body soften, that\u2019s when we know the work is being done. There\u2019s a vulnerability that the dogs allow the kids to open up with.\u201d The dogs in the program are rescued from shelters and are vetted by a professional dog trainer before they join the program. \u201cThe dogs that we take into the program can be shy. They can be insecure. But they can\u2019t show any signs of aggression,\u201d Wolf said. The dogs live in foster homes while they are in the program so their routine is consistent and stable. Wolf says the foster families are a crucial part of the program. \u201cIf you can commit to 10 to 12 weeks of fostering, this could change the life of not only a dog, but of a student in need as well.\u201d To date, UnChained has worked with more than 450 young people who have helped 220 dogs find forever homes. And while Wolf says she\u2019ll always be a \u201ccrazy dog lady,\u201d she says she\u2019s all in it for the kids. \u201cWe serve kids that have great intellect, great creativity, great compassion,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are our leaders. And we need to take care of them.\u201d Want to get involved? Check out the UnChained website and see how to help.

{"id": "2024_07_15_us_thomas-crooks-trump-rally-shooting-invs", "text": "In the 48 hours before he opened fire on former President Donald Trump, 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks made a series of stops in and around his suburban Pittsburgh hometown. On Friday, he went to a shooting range where he was a member, and practiced firing, a law enforcement official told CNN. The next morning, Crooks went to a Home Depot, where he bought a five-foot ladder, and a gun store, where he purchased 50 rounds of ammunition, the official said. Then, Crooks drove his Hyundai Sonata about an hour north, joining thousands of people from around the region who flocked to Trump\u2019s rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. He parked the car outside the rally, with an improvised explosive device hidden in the trunk that was wired to a transmitter he carried, the official said. Then, investigators believe, he used his newly-bought ladder to scale a nearby building, and opened fire on the former president. As investigators continue to search for a motive behind the attempted assassination, they are scrutinizing Crooks\u2019 movements before the attack and trying to piece together a timeline of his actions leading up to it. Yet nearly 48 hours after the shooting, investigators are struck by the lack of leads they\u2019re finding about Crooks\u2019 mindset\u00a0and possible motives. Even after successfully breaking into his phone and\u00a0searching\u00a0his computer, scouring his search history and bedroom, and interviewing his family and friends, agents still haven\u2019t found\u00a0evidence\u00a0that would suggest\u00a0political or ideological\u00a0impetus for the shooting, law enforcement sources told CNN. Instead, the evidence they have found appears\u00a0to\u00a0show typical online activities including an interest in computer coding and gaming, the sources said\u00a0\u2014 and\u00a0that\u00a0has raised more questions. In a sign that his attack could have been even more destructive, Crooks had a remote control detonator on his body, and his car\u2019s trunk contained a metal box of explosives that was connected with wires to a receiver, the law enforcement source said. That suggests the gunman may have been planning to set off an explosion remotely, and investigators are considering the theory that he may have been planning a distraction during the shooting. It\u2019s unclear how Crooks assembled the explosive\u00a0devices found\u00a0in his car. Investigators parsing through his online search history haven\u2019t found any indication of him researching how to make home-made explosives, law enforcement officials said. The AR-style rifle Crooks used to fire on Trump was legally purchased by his father, Matthew Crooks. It was one of more than 20 firearms registered to the elder Crooks, which were kept at the family\u2019s home, according to Pennsylvania State Police records reviewed by investigators, the official said. All of the guns were legally purchased. The gunman and his father were members of Clairton Sportsmen\u2019s Club, a gun club about a 25-minute drive from his house, and enjoyed going shooting there together, according to law enforcement officials. Rob Bootay, a lawyer for the club, confirmed in a statement that the younger Crooks was a member. The club, which has about 2,000 members, features a rifle shooting range that is roughly 200 yards long, according to a CNN analysis of satellite images \u2013 longer than the distance between Crooks and Trump when he fired at the former president while perched on a nearby rooftop. The range is tucked into 180 acres of woodlands in the hills south of Pittsburgh. \u201cThe Club fully admonishes the senseless act of violence that occurred,\u201d Bootay said, adding that he could not \u201cmake any additional commentary in relation to this matter in light of pending law enforcement investigations.\u201d Crooks purchased the 50 rounds of ammunition on the morning of the attack at Allegheny Arms and Gun Works, a local gun store in his hometown of Bethel Park, a senior law enforcement official told CNN. Bruce Piendl, the store\u2019s owner, said in a statement that \u201cwe are thankful that President Trump was not assassinated and our hearts and prayers go out to all victims of this horrible incident.\u201d A spokesperson for Home Depot, where Crooks bought the ladder, said in a statement that \u201cwe condemn the violence against former President Trump, and our thoughts are with him, the other victims of Saturday\u2019s horrific events, and their families.\u201d It\u2019s not clear whether Crooks used the ammunition or the ladder that he bought on Saturday during his attack later that day. Matthew Crooks did not respond to requests for comment from CNN on Sunday and Monday. On Saturday evening, before officials had publicly confirmed his son\u2019s role in the attack, he told CNN that he was trying to figure out \u201cwhat the hell is going on\u201d but would \u201cwait until I talk to law enforcement\u201d before speaking about his son. FBI investigators succeeded in accessing the younger Crooks\u2019 cell phone, the agency said Monday afternoon. While investigators had hoped that breakthough would help them understand what drove him to attempt to assassinate Trump, they\u2019re still struggling to make sense of it, law enforcement officials said. The shooter\u2019s parents, who have been cooperating with law enforcement since the shooting, have told investigators that Crooks did not appear to have friends and did not appear to have any political leanings, a law enforcement official told CNN. But they didn\u2019t seem to know much about what was going on in his life recently, law enforcement sources said.

A law enforcement official told CNN that one of the times was when Crooks was at an ammo store and the other was during the assassination attempt. Demolition Ranch is a popular YouTube channel for gun enthusiasts with more than 11 million subscribers. Its founder, Texas-based Matt Carriker, distanced the brand from the shooter in an almost six-minute-long video posted Monday on the channel. \u201cWe were shocked and confused to find this out: The shooter who tried to assassinate Trump was wearing merch from my channel, wearing a Demolition Ranch t-shirt. And that sucked to see that. Yeah, that was rough,\u201d he said. The video racked up more than 520,000 views within two hours of publishing. Demolition Ranch usually posts a variety of videos relating to guns with titles such as \u201cEating A Meal Cooked ONLY With A GUN!!!\u201d and \u201cHow Lethal is The TINIEST Gun I Own???\u201d \u201cNo matter what side you\u2019re on politically, none of us want violence. This channel was never meant to incite violence or hate,\u201d Carriker said in the video. The shirts are printed in Carriker\u2019s hometown and sold and shipped all over the world, he said in the video. Carriker said Demolition Ranch cannot vet everyone who buys its products. T-shirts are sold online for about $30, and the online store also sells hoodies, hats, stickers and other accessories. \u201cTo see my name next to the shooter\u2019s name sucks. And I wish, I wish we could keep that from happening,\u201d Carriker said. Crooks\u2019 attack killed one and critically injured two others. Crooks had been perched on a nearby building rooftop outside the rally\u2019s security perimeter, and was shot and killed by Secret Service agents, according to law enforcement officials. On Friday before the attack, he went to a shooting range where he was a member, and practiced firing, a law enforcement official told CNN. The next morning, Crooks went to a hardware store, where he bought a five-foot ladder, and also went to a gun store, where he purchased 50 rounds of ammunition, the official said. He lived in the Pittsburgh suburb of Bethel Park and graduated from Bethel Park High School in 2022, according to a local media\u00a0report\u00a0and a video of the school\u2019s graduation ceremony.

{"id": "2024_07_12_us_van-epps-plane-crash-ny-georgia-cec", "text": "A few days after the plane crash, Ansley Van Epps visited the house where her brother and his family once lived. There was food in the refrigerator, dishes in the sink. She walked through her nephews\u2019 rooms and looked at their medals, their sports jerseys, their school uniforms. Elsewhere she found items laid out for a beach vacation the family would never take. \u201cIt was heartbreaking,\u201d she said. Her brother, Ryan Van Epps, had gone to upstate New York for a youth baseball tournament with his wife, Laura, and their two sons, Harrison, 10; and James Ryan, 12. They were returning June 30 in a small plane piloted by the boys\u2019 grandfather, Roger Beggs. The plane crashed in the Catskill Mountains, not long after takeoff, for unknown reasons that may have been related to bad weather. All five people were killed. The Van Epps family left behind two dogs, a stunned and grieving community, and an untold number of priceless memories. Regan Burr was a friend of the family. She remembered Laura\u2019s flower arrangements. They often featured blue hydrangeas and magnolia leaves. Laura brought flowers in a vase to Burr\u2019s house for a cookout on Memorial Day weekend. Burr washed the vase and stored it away. When she heard about the plane crash, she found the vase, cut some hydrangeas from her own yard, put them in the vase, and brought it back to Laura\u2019s house. No one was home to receive them, so she left the vase on the front porch. \u201cA whole family was taken away in an instant,\u201d she said. The Van Epps family was well-known and beloved in Atlanta\u2019s northern suburbs On Monday, Ryan\u2019s sister Ansley was at Perimeter Mall with her husband and daughters. They were buying clothes for the funeral, scheduled for Friday afternoon at Roswell United Methodist Church, the same church that hosted Ryan and Laura\u2019s wedding 15 years and one day earlier. At the mall on Monday, Ansley sat down at a table under a skylight and thought about her brother, her nephews, and the challenge of planning a service for five people all at once. Ryan was the oldest of four Van Epps siblings. Ansley reminisced about the giant forts he built in the backyard. He and his father would collect discarded lumber from construction sites. One treehouse was multiple stories high and had a crow\u2019s nest like you\u2019d see on a pirate ship. Ryan played baseball, football and lacrosse. He graduated from Roswell High School a year ahead of Laura, who also played lacrosse. Ryan got a college degree in business administration; Laura in special education. They started dating after college, got married and had two sons who attended King\u2019s Ridge Christian School in Alpharetta. \u201cHarrison cared about doing well in school and had a great attitude about working hard to improve his skills,\u201d wrote Stefanie Gammage, head of the lower school. \u201cHe was well-liked by classmates and was a good friend.\u201d Harrison played quarterback and linebacker in the North Atlanta Football Club. \u201cHe was incredibly smart, incredibly driven,\u201d said his coach, Rich Dennis. \u201cHe was loved by every kid on the team.\u201d James Ryan, his older brother, also played football. His team in the Milton High feeder program won a state championship, said his coach, Brent Bechard. James Ryan played tight end, receiver and middle linebacker, or \u201cmic linebacker,\u201d where he led the defense. The coach recalled a goal-line stand at the end of a playoff game. James Ryan and his teammates stopped the running back at the 1-yard line to preserve the victory. The coach also remembered how James Ryan\u2019s mother, Laura, went out of her way to celebrate the other boys on the team. \u201cShe always had a hug for everybody,\u201d he said. A trip to Cooperstown, and a memorable home run James Ryan also played on an elite travel-ball team called the Ninth Inning Blue Jays. They\u2019d been together since the previous August and had looked forward to the tournament in Cooperstown, home to the Baseball Hall of Fame. Each family was responsible for its own travel arrangements. The head coach, Chase Timms, rented an SUV, packed it with baseball equipment, and drove up to New York. The Van Epps family took a different route. Laura\u2019s father, Roger Beggs, was a licensed pilot with a six-seat, single-engine Piper Malibu Mirage. Ansley remembered flying with him when Roger delivered her to Savannah for her bachelorette party. She said he was a meticulous pilot who took every precaution, and the plane had recently undergone its annual maintenance. James Ryan joined the other Blue Jays on one of the many fields at Cooperstown Dreams Park. Their first game was Wednesday night, June 26. The bases were loaded when James Ryan walked to the plate through heavy rain. Coach Timms watched from his place near third base. He could see the batter\u2019s box turning to mud. The pitcher aimed and fired. James Ryan swung. The ball sailed into the night, over the outfield, over the fence. James Ryan ran the bases carefully after his grand slam. He didn\u2019t want to fall in the mud. The coach saw him rounding third with a big smile on his face. That was the first of many home runs for the Blue Jays in Cooperstown. They went 3-2 in pool play before heading into the single-elimination bracket, where they won two more games. On Sunday morning, James Ryan was the starting pitcher against Team Elite National, another Georgia squad, the top-seeded team in the tournament. \u201cFor the majority of the game, we were winning,\u201d Timms said. The Blue Jays scored several runs in the first inning, and James Ryan was pitching well. But Team Elite came back, took the lead, and won the game. The Blue Jays were eliminated. James Ryan put on a brave face. \u201cHe always took a loss with as much grace as you could want from a 12-year-old,\u201d Timms said. The coach gathered the players and congratulated them on a wonderful season. The families pressed in together for a picture. Then they prepared to go their separate ways. Coach Timms gave James Ryan one last fist-bump. \u201cI told him I was proud of him,\u201d Timms said. \u201cI told Laura, \u2018We\u2019ll see you guys soon. Safe travels.\u2019\u201d \u2018Storm activity along the flight path\u2019 Oneonta Municipal Airport is about 15 miles from the baseball park. According to the National Transportation Safety Board, the Piper carrying Roger Beggs and his four passengers took off from Oneonta at 1:40 p.m. They were headed for Charleston, West Virginia, about 560 miles southwest, to refuel before heading on to suburban Atlanta. It\u2019s not clear what the pilot knew or believed about the weather when he first ascended. Investigators are still working on their preliminary report, which is expected later this month. According to an NTSB statement, \u201cFlight tracking data was lost about 12 minutes after departure.\u201d It also said, \u201cMeteorological data shows storm activity along the flight path.\u201d The single-engine Piper did not get very far. It crashed in unknown circumstances along the wooded hills near Lake Cecil Road in the town of Masonville, New York, about 30 miles from the Oneonta airport. The NTSB said the plane left a trail of debris almost a mile long. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of questions about what happened,\u201d Ansley Van Epps said, beneath the skylight at Perimeter Mall, in a conversation with a reporter on Monday. It had been more than a week since the crash, and she did not expect to understand it anytime soon. \u201cWe will be asking why for the rest of our lives,\u201d she said. Meanwhile, she and others who loved the Van Epps family took care of other priorities. The dogs, a young black lab named Gunner and an old golden retriever named Walker, were in the care of Laura\u2019s stepmother. Friends were helping each other choose colorful outfits for the funeral, because they were sure Laura wouldn\u2019t have wanted anyone to wear black. James Ryan\u2019s football teammates were adding their signatures to his helmet. Someone was organizing an unusually long list of pallbearers. There was something else, too. A terrible errand to run. On Tuesday morning, Ansley, her husband, D.J., her parents, and her younger brother, Jason, flew to JFK airport in New York. A man who worked for Delta Air Lines drove them onto the tarmac to see the remains of their loved ones loaded into the cargo hold of a plane. The driver was nearly overcome with emotion. Ansley started crying. The survivors boarded the plane to escort their loved ones back to Atlanta. On that flight, Ansley reached a state of emotional exhaustion. She was thinking about Walker, the family\u2019s old golden retriever, who\u2019d been with Ryan and Laura since before they were married. Now Walker was about 15 years old, blind and deaf, living his last days. Ansley was crying and laughing, loudly enough that she worried other people might think she was crazy. She thought about her nephews, and their old dog, and she said something like, \u201cJames Ryan and Harrison will be so happy to see Walker soon.\u201d The plane continued southwest, descending steadily, bringing the Van Epps family closer and closer to their final destination.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/12/us/van-epps-plane-crash-ny-georgia-cec/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/16/2024", "section": "us"}}

Nine were on college campuses, and 26 were on K-12 school grounds. The incidents left 17 people dead and at least 39 other victims injured, according to CNN\u2019s analysis of events reported by the Gun Violence Archive, Education Week and Everytown for Gun Safety. CNN cross checks these reports of school shootings against school and police accounts and media reports. All incidents of gun violence are included if they occurred on school property, from kindergartens through colleges/universities, and at least one person was shot, not including the shooter. School property includes but is not limited to, buildings, fields, parking lots, stadiums and buses. Accidental discharges of firearms are included, as long as at least one person is shot, but not if the sole shooter is law enforcement or school security. In the first year of the pandemic, when schools were closed, there was a major decline in gun violence incidents on school grounds. Since then, recent years saw a stark increase in school shootings, with 2021, 2022 and 2023 all setting records since at least 2008. There were at least 82 incidents in 2023, but 2022 was one of the deadliest years, with 46 fatalities, according to CNN\u2019s analysis. That year saw the shooting at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, where 19 students and two educators were killed and more than a dozen others were injured. Students and educators have engaged in activism around the issue of gun violence, and some educators have quit the profession. Some states in the south have seen the highest rate of school shootings relative to their populations since 2008, according to CNN\u2019s analysis. Washington, DC had the highest rate \u2014 6 total shootings, more than 0.8 per 100,000 people \u2014 while Texas had the most overall with 60 school shootings.

He was \u201cfunny and energetic\u201d and deeply loved his children, Harmon said. But her husband, D\u2019Vontaye Mitchell, will never see his children again: The 43-year-old died on June 30 after he was\u00a0pinned down by hotel security guards\u00a0outside a Hyatt Regency hotel in Milwaukee in an incident partially captured on video. \u201cI\u2019m angry about it,\u201d Harmon said of her husband\u2019s death. \u201cI\u2019m broken, empty, honestly.\u201d Police have referred four charges of felony murder in Mitchell\u2019s death to the district attorney\u2019s office, Milwaukee Police told CNN in a statement Friday. A homicide investigation is underway and the full results of Mitchell\u2019s autopsy are pending. William F. Sulton, an attorney for the Mitchell family, told CNN he is confident that the Milwaukee County District Attorney\u2019s office \u201cwill make the right decision\u201d and charge the hotel employees involved. \u201cI do believe criminal charges will be issued in this case,\u201d Sulton said, adding, \u201cI want to be very clear that this involves more than just four persons.\u201d \u201cMr. Mitchell was beaten with a broom by a front desk manager, who you see on camera,\u201d he said. \u201cYou see a third security official who could have intervened and stopped this.\u201d \u201cThere were so many opportunities, and at every turn, Hyatt staff attacked him,\u201d Sulton said. Sulton said that while Wisconsin does have a citizen\u2019s arrest law, it requires observation of an ongoing felony. \u201cThere was no crime committed by Mr. Mitchell at all. And in fact, we know that Mr. Mitchell was running away from a security officer who had attacked him, and that he was retreating the entire time,\u201d the attorney said. \u201cAnd despite Mr. Mitchell trying to retreat, which included leaving the hotel after seeking refuge there, that he was repeatedly beaten to the point in which he was killed.\u201d Sulton said he met with the Milwaukee County District Attorney\u2019s Office for several hours Wednesday and two hours Thursday morning to discuss the case. Aimbridge Hospitality, which operates the downtown hotel, has said that they suspended and then fired the \u201chotel associates\u201d involved in the incident. It\u2019s unclear how many employees were fired and if they include the security guards seen pinning Mitchell down. \u201cThe conduct we saw from several associates on June 30 violated our policies and procedures, and does not reflect our values as an organization or the behaviors we expect from our associates,\u201d Aimbridge Hospitality said in a Thursday statement about Mitchell\u2019s death. The case has sparked criticism and accusations of racism, particularly given the parallels between Mitchel\u2019s death and other instances in which Black men have died at the hands of police and other authority figures. May 25 marked the 4-year anniversary of George Floyd\u2019s murder by White police officer Derek Chauvin, igniting widespread protests across the country. What we know about Mitchell\u2019s death Many of the circumstances surrounding Mitchell\u2019s death remain unclear, including what led to his encounter with the security guards, how long it took officers to arrive on the scene, and what Mitchell was doing at the hotel. Police allege Mitchell \u201ccaused a disturbance,\u201d prompting security guards to escort him out of the hotel,\u00a0according to\u00a0a statement\u00a0from civil rights attorney Ben Crump, who is also representing the Mitchell family. Security guards and others then pinned Mitchell to the ground. Part of a video posted on social media shows Mitchell grunting and pleading with the guards, repeatedly saying \u201cplease\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d One guard, who appears to be White, can be heard saying \u201cstay down\u201d and \u201cstop fighting,\u201d as the others, who appear to be people of color, hold Mitchell down, the video shows. The same guard calls out to witnesses, \u201cThis is what happens when you go into the ladies room.\u201d The district attorney\u2019s office is awaiting the full results of Mitchell\u2019s autopsy, which will help inform the police investigation into his death and allow the office to evaluate what happened before his death \u201cfrom the perspective of potential criminal liability,\u201d District Attorney John Chisholm said Wednesday in a statement. Crump, in a statement posted on X last week, said: \u201cIt is deeply troubling that we have lost another Black man in an encounter with security personnel, raising serious concerns about the use of force, lack of accountability, and absence of mental health considerations.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/13/us/dvontaye-mitchell-milwaukee-wisconsin-death/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/16/2024", "section": "us"}}

The crash happened around 1:20 p.m. Thursday near the Hanakoa Valley along the Na Pali Coast, according to a\u00a0news release\u00a0from the\u00a0Kaua\u2018i Police Department. Police were alerted to the crash by hikers who reported seeing the helicopter go into the water, the release said. One person was found dead around 2:25 p.m., police said. A multiagency search was still underway Friday for the two people who are missing. The pilot of the helicopter was local and the two passengers are believed to be \u201cvisitors from the mainland,\u201d Kaua\u2019i Police Chief Todd Raybuck said. County search and rescue crews resumed search efforts Friday after pausing at sundown Thursday, while the US Coast Guard continued searching throughout the evening, police said. \u201cOur hearts go out to the families impacted by this tragedy,\u201d Raybuck said in the release. \u201cWe will continue working with our partners to locate the missing individuals and provide support during this difficult time.\u201d Fire Chief Michael Gibson said sharks have been a consideration in the search. \u201cWe are focusing all of our efforts on the surface water for any survivors right now,\u201d Gibson said. \u201cWe\u2019re utilizing our assets in the air from the Air National Guard and from Coast Guard to help keep an eye above things. But currently, our first responders are keeping safety in mind and we\u2019re doing our search from personal rescue watercraft and other vessels.\u201d The helicopter, which the FAA identified as a Robinson R44, was operated by Ali\u2019i Kauai Air Tours and Charters, police said. CNN has reached out to the company for comment. Helicopter tours are popular in Hawaii as visitors seek to view the archipelago\u2019s lush landscape by air, but safety concerns have been raised following other fatal crashes. Seven people were killed when a tour helicopter crashed in a remote area of a state park on Kauai in December 2019. And earlier that year, three people were killed when a tour helicopter crashed and caught fire on a street in Kailua on the island of Oahu, officials said. Overall, Hawaii has the highest number of deaths from air tour crashes in the nation, with more than 85 killed since the NTSB began keeping records, Hawaii Senator Brian Schatz said in a news release in May announcing new safety provisions for the air tour industry included in the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2024.

{"id": "2024_07_15_us_brian-steven-smith-alaska-murders", "text": "Anchorage, Alaska (AP) \u2014 A\u00a0man who killed two Alaska Native women\u00a0and was heard while videotaping the torture death of one say that in his movies \u201ceverybody always dies\u201d was sentenced Friday to 226 years in prison. Brian Steven Smith received 99-year sentences each for the deaths of Kathleen Henry, 30, and Veronica Abouchuk, who was 52 when her family reported her missing in February 2019, seven months after they last saw her. \u201cBoth were treated about as horribly as a person can be treated,\u201d Alaska Superior Court Judge Kevin Saxby said when imposing the sentence. \u201cIt\u2019s the stuff of nightmares,\u201d Saxby said. The remaining 28 years were for other charges, including sexual assault and tampering with evidence. Alaska does not have the death penalty. Smith, a native of South Africa who became a naturalized US citizen shortly before torturing and killing Henry at an Anchorage hotel in September 2019, showed no emotion during sentencing. He also displayed no emotion when\u00a0a jury deliberated for less than two hours\u00a0and found him guilty after a three-week trial in February. During the trial, the victims were not identified by name, only initials. Saxby said during sentencing that their names would be used in order to restore their personhood. Smith was arrested in 2019\u00a0when a sex worker stole his cellphone from his truck and found the gruesome footage of Henry\u2019s torture and murder. The images were eventually copied onto a memory card, and she turned it over to police. Smith eventually confessed to killing Henry and Abouchuk, whose body had been found earlier but was misidentified. Both Alaska Native women were from small villages in western Alaska and experienced homelessness when living in Anchorage. Authorities identified Henry as the victim whose death was recorded at TownePlace Suites by Marriott in midtown Anchorage. Smith, who worked at the hotel, was registered to stay there from September 2-4, 2019. The first images from the card showed Henry\u2019s body and were time-stamped about 1 a.m. September 4, police said. The last image, dated early September 6, showed Henry\u2019s body in the back of a black pickup. Charging documents said location data showed Smith\u2019s phone in the same rural area south of Anchorage where Henry\u2019s body was found a few weeks later. Videos from the memory card were shown during the trial to the jury but hidden from the gallery. Smith\u2019s face was never seen in the videos, but his distinctive South African accent \u2014 which police eventually recognized from previous encounters \u2014 was heard narrating as if there were an audience. On the tape, he repeatedly urged Henry to die as he beat and strangled her. \u201cIn my movies, everybody always dies,\u201d the voice says on one video. \u201cWhat are my followers going to think of me? People need to know when they are being serial-killed.\u201d During the eight-hour videotaped police interrogation, Smith confessed to killing Abouchuk after picking her up in Anchorage when his wife was out of town. He took her to his home, and she refused when he asked her to shower because of an odor. Smith said he became upset, retrieved a pistol from the garage and shot her in the head, dumping her body north of Anchorage. He told police the location, where authorities later found a skull with a bullet wound in it.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/15/us/brian-steven-smith-alaska-murders/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/16/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_07_11_us_taylor-casey-birthday-missing-bahamas-reaj", "text": "The family of Taylor Casey, a Chicago woman who has been missing in the Bahamas for nearly a month, gathered Thursday to mark her birthday and to plead with authorities to continue searching for her. \u201cThe pain I felt 42 years ago while birthing you doesn\u2019t compare to the pain I feel on today with you missing out of our lives,\u201d Colette Seymore, Casey\u2019s mother, said during a news conference in downtown Chicago livestreamed by CNN affiliate WLS. \u201cThe pain, the hurt (and) the agony is practically killing me.\u201d In June, Casey, then 41, traveled to the Bahamas to attend a retreat at Sivananda Ashram Yoga. She was last seen the evening of June 19 around Paradise Island, a small resort enclave just off the shore of the island of New Providence, the most populous island in the Bahamas, the Royal Bahamas Police Force said. Casey\u2019s friends and family described her as a \u201cfixture of Chicago\u2019s transgender community,\u201d in a news release that was shared Wednesday on a social media account dedicated to her disappearance. \u201cTaylor\u2019s disappearance has sent shockwaves through Chicago\u2019s LGBTQ+ community,\u201d the release read. \u201cTaylor\u2019s family and friends are pleading for elected officials, LGBTQ+ leaders and media to elevate her story and pressure elected officials to leverage the federal resources needed to investigate her disappearance.\u201d During the news conference Thursday, Channyn Lynne Parker, CEO of the Brave Space Alliance \u2013 a \u201cBlack-led, trans-led LGBTQ+ center\u201d in Chicago \u2013 said she believes Casey\u2019s identity as a transgender Black woman is stalling the investigation into her disappearance. \u201c(We have) trans women whose lives are being discarded, who are being thought of as nothing but an afterthought. And again, here we are \u2013 having to apply pressure when it should come as second nature and instinct to do what you know to be right,\u201d Parker said. \u201cWe\u2019re here to say right now, emphatically, resoundingly and loudly that we reject that. Black women matter (and) \u2026 Black trans women matter.\u201d Casey was first reported missing on June 20 when she failed to attend morning yoga classes, CNN previously reported. Family and friends have been critical of the way police and the retreat center have handled the investigation into her disappearance. On Thursday, Seymore noted missing person flyers of Casey were not displayed at the Royal Bahamas Police Force Department or at the retreat center. \u201cHow are you looking for my child?\u201d she said. \u201cPeople have to see that somebody is missing and they never put up posters or anything.\u201d Authorities said Casey\u2019s cell phone had been found in the water on June 24, but it was unclear how far the location was from the retreat. \u201cWe have conducted extensive investigation into the matter,\u201d Royal Bahamas Police Force Chief Superintendent Chrislyn Skippings said during a news conference at the time of the discovery. \u201cOur priority is to find Taylor and to find Taylor in good health.\u201d Police have utilized drones, search-and-rescue dogs and divers in the investigation, Skippings said. Amid the investigation into Casey\u2019s disappearance, Michael Johnson, the Royal Bahamas Police Force superintendent in charge of the criminal investigation department, was put on leave pending an investigation, according to a July 5 statement from the police force. CNN reached out to the police force for comment. The Royal Bahamas Police Force posted a release Thursday saying they \u201care aware of an article and video circulating on social media which seeks to imply a correlation between the suspension of (Johnson) and investigations into the missing person, Taylor Casey,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThe information is erroneous and unequivocally unrelated to the investigations.\u201d Emily Williams, a long-time friend of Casey\u2019s, said she traveled to the Bahamas with Casey\u2019s mother to learn more. But upon arriving on the island, Williams said, she knew something was off. \u201cWe weren\u2019t met with caring detectives who wanted to give us an update on where our loved one was. They couldn\u2019t keep details straight, they gave us misinformation and then they tried to push us out,\u201d Williams said during the news conference, adding she and Seymore left early due to feeling \u201cunsafe.\u201d \u201cThey found the phone, but they only found the phone because Taylor\u2019s niece pinged it and gave them the location. They said that they sent out scent dogs, but it came up with nothing. They said that they sent divers and came up with nothing. And what have they done since? We haven\u2019t seen it. They haven\u2019t even reviewed the CCTV footage from the neighboring Atlantis hotel,\u201d Williams continued. Williams and Seymore say they had to \u201cpress\u201d those at the ashram in order to get more information and were not allowed to take pictures or \u201cdisturb\u201d guests. When asked if everyone at the ashram knew of Casey\u2019s disappearance, Williams said the \u201ccolonel overseeing the investigation\u201d told them \u201cmost, but not all\u201d were aware. Jonathan Goldbloom, a representative for the ashram, told CNN Thursday they \u201chave been collaborating fully with the police since we reported that Taylor is missing.\u201d In addition to holding group prayers for Casey, Goldbloom maintained the ashram has provided guests with \u201cregular updates orally and in writing.\u201d Casey\u2019s missing person flyer is posted on their bulletin board, Goldbloom added. \u201cTaylor\u2019s family and friends visit(ed) (sic) the ashram on June 26 for approximately six hours, meeting initially with representatives of the Royal Bahamian police, the US Embassy and the ashram,\u201d Goldbloom wrote to CNN. \u201cDuring Taylor\u2019s friends and family visit, they were asked to not randomly approach guests. The police were clear with their instruction that all guests must consent to speak with them on their own accord.\u00a0We announced their presence to Taylor\u2019s classmates and teachers and invited anyone wanting to meet with them to come forward. Many did, and no one intervened in terms of what individuals are to say.\u201d Casey, who has been practicing yoga for 15 years, went to the yoga retreat \u201cto fulfill a long-term goal of deepening her practice. Eager to return to Chicago, she looked forward to sharing her newfound knowledge and experience with others,\u201d a June 24 release said. A 2023 report on human rights practices in the Bahamas conducted by the US Department of State\u2019s Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor found \u201cLGBTQI+ individuals faced social stigma and discrimination and did not believe they were adequately protected by authorities.\u201d The study also found there was \u201cgenerally low social tolerance for same-sex relationships,\u201d \u201chomophobic epithets were common and socially acceptable,\u201d and a lack of an alternative reporting mechanism of incidents to police and government agents. Williams mentioned in the news conference that the Royal Bahamian Police Force said they will have an update for Casey\u2019s family and friends by Friday. \u201cWe want that update. It\u2019s been three weeks \u2013 we want an update,\u201d she said. Following the news conference a birthday party was held for Casey, that included balloons, snacks and games. \u201cToday is your birthday and we all just want to say happy birthday,\u201d Seymore said to her daughter at the start of Thursday\u2019s news conference. \u201cAlthough, it\u2019s not so happy because you are not here with us.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/11/us/taylor-casey-birthday-missing-bahamas-reaj/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/16/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_07_15_politics_fact-check-night-one-republican-national-convention", "text": "CNN\u2019s team is fact-checking the first night of the Republican National Convention. We will continue to update this list throughout the night. North Carolina gubernatorial candidate\u2019s economic claims Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson of North Carolina, now running for governor, made a series of economic claims in his speech at the Republican National Convention on Monday. One about the Biden era was misleading, while another about the Trump era touted pre-pandemic statistics without acknowledging that when Trump left office the economy was in much worse shape. Robinson said that under President Joe Biden\u2019s administration, \u201cgrocery prices have skyrocketed, and gas has nearly doubled.\u201d Facts First: It is true that grocery prices have jumped by over 20% since Biden was sworn in, but gas prices aren\u2019t double what they were when he took office.  The national average price for a gallon of regular gasoline was about $3.52 on Monday, according to AAA. When Biden was inaugurated, the national average was $2.39. Robinson also claimed that under former President Donald Trump, unemployment was \u201cat a historic low.\u201d That was certainly true prior to the pandemic. For instance, in February 2020, the nation\u2019s unemployment rate was at 3.5%, the lowest since the late 1960s.By comparison, the average monthly unemployment rate over the past decade was 4.8%.But when Trump left office, it was at 6.4%, far from historic lows. From CNN\u2019s Elisabeth Buchwald\u00a0 Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene\u2019s misleading claim about Biden-era job growth In her speech at the Republican National Convention, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia claimed of Democrats: \u201cThey claim that our economy is thriving, yet hundreds of thousands of American-born workers lost their jobs these past few years.\u201d Facts First:\u00a0This is misleading at best.\u00a0Bureau of Labor Statistics figures\u00a0show\u00a0that the number of American-born workers with jobs has grown significantly during President Joe Biden\u2019s administration. About 130.9 million American-born workers were employed in June, an increase of nearly 4.7 million since June 2021, shortly after Biden took office. (This data is not seasonally adjusted, so we have to look at the same month in each year for an accurate comparison. In January 2021, the month Biden was sworn in, about 123 million American-born workers were employed.) There is always churn in the labor market, so it\u2019s certainly possible that hundreds of thousands of individual American-born workers lost their jobs during this period \u2013 but contrary to Greene\u2019s insinuation, there have been far greater gains than losses under Biden for American-born workers as a group. From CNN\u2019s Daniel Dale and Tami Luhby\u00a0 Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene on Transgender Day of Visibility Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene said while attacking Democrats in her convention speech Monday that\u00a0\u201cthe establishment in Washington\u201d held Transgender Day of Visibility on Easter this year. \u201cThey promised normalcy and gave us Transgender Visibility Day on Easter Sunday,\u201d the Georgia Republican said. Facts first: This claim needs context. Transgender Day of Visibility has been held annually on March 31 since it was started in 2009 as a day of awareness to celebrate the successes of transgender and gender-nonconforming people. Easter is celebrated on the first Sunday after the first full moon following the first day of spring and can change year to year. The holiday happened to fall on March 31 in 2024. Responding to Republicans criticizing President Joe Biden, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre in an April 1 briefing said she was \u201csurprised by the misinformation\u201d surrounding Easter and Transgender Day of Visibility falling on the same day. \u201cEvery year, for the past several years, on March 31, Transgender Day of Visibility is marked.\u00a0And as we know \u2014 for folks who understand the calendar and how it works, Easter falls on different Sundays every year. And this year, it happened to coincide with Transgender Visibility Day.\u00a0 And so, that is the simple fact,\u201d she said. From CNN\u2019s Jack Forrest\u00a0 RNC video falsely claims Trump signed largest tax cuts ever A video played at the Republican National Convention featured a narrator making the claim that former President Donald Trump \u201cgave us the largest tax cuts in history.\u201d Facts First:\u00a0This is false. Analyses have found that Trump\u2019s\u00a02017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\u00a0was not the largest in history, either in percentage of gross domestic product or inflation-adjusted dollars. The act made numerous permanent and temporary changes to the tax code, including reducing both corporate and individual income tax rates. In a report released in June, the\u00a0federal government\u2019s nonpartisan\u00a0Congressional Budget Office\u00a0looked at the size of past tax cuts enacted between 1981 and 2023. It found that two other tax cut bills have been bigger \u2013 former President Ronald Reagan\u2019s 1981 package and legislation signed by former President Barack Obama that extended earlier tax cuts enacted during former President George W. Bush\u2019s administration. The CBO measured the sizes of tax cuts by looking at the revenue effects of the bills as a percentage of gross domestic product \u2013 in other words, how much federal revenue the bill cuts as a portion of the economy \u2013 over five years. Reagan\u2019s 1981 tax cut and Obama\u2019s 2012 tax cut extension were 3.5% and 1.7% of GDP, respectively. Trump\u2019s 2017 tax cut, by contrast, was estimated to be about 1% of GDP. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a nonprofit, found in 2017 that the framework for the Trump tax cuts would be the fourth largest since 1940 in inflation-adjusted dollars and the\u00a0eighth largest\u00a0since 1918 as a percentage of gross domestic product. From CNN\u2019s Tami Luhby Republican chair falsely claims Middle East was \u2018at peace\u2019 four years ago Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Whatley said in his speech at the party\u2019s convention on Monday: \u201cFour years ago, Europe and the Middle East were at peace.\u201d Facts First:\u00a0Whatley\u2019s claim is false. Whatever the merits of the Abraham Accords that Trump\u2019s administration helped to negotiate, in which Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates\u00a0agreed in 2020 to normalize relations with Israel\u00a0(Morocco and Sudan followed), there was still lots of unresolved armed conflict around the Middle East four years ago in mid-2020 and when Trump left office in early 2021. The list notably included\u00a0the civil war in Yemen;\u00a0the civil war in Syria; and the conflicts between Israel and Palestinians in\u00a0Gaza\u00a0and\u00a0the West Bank, between Israel and\u00a0Hezbollah on its border with Lebanon,\u00a0between Israel and Syria, and what former State Department official\u00a0Aaron David Millercalled \u201cthe war between the wars\u00a0between Israel and Iran on air, land and sea.\u201d\u00a0Also,\u00a0the US, its allies and civilians\u00a0continued to be attacked\u00a0in an unstable Iraq. \u201cIt\u2019s a highly inaccurate statement,\u201d Miller, who worked on Mideast peace negotiations while in government and is now a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said last fall, when Trump himself made a similar claim about having achieved peace in the Middle East. Dana El Kurd, senior nonresident fellow at the Arab Center Washington DC think tank, also called that claim \u201cfalse\u201d when Trump made it. She said in a November email: \u201cThe Abraham Accords did not achieve peace in the Middle East. In fact, violence escalated in Israel-Palestine in the aftermath of the Accords (using any metric you can think of \u2013 death tolls, settlement violence, etc).\u201d From CNN\u2019s Daniel Dale RNC video attacks Biden with two-year-old gas price figure The Republican National Convention featured a video attacking President Joe Biden over the price of gas. But the video misleadingly deployed out-of-date figures as if they were current. A narrator claimed:\u00a0\u201cWhen President Trump left office, gas cost only $2.20. Under Biden and Harris, gas skyrocketed to the highest price in history, over five bucks a gallon.\u201d Later in the video, a young man said, \u201cWithin my first year of driving, I\u2019m having to deal with an average of $5.03 across the nation,\u201d and a woman said, \u201cIt\u2019s impossible to pay $5.03. We need to care about our people better than that.\u201d Facts First:\u00a0These claims about Biden-era gas prices are two years out of date. The national average for a gallon of regular gasoline was about $3.52 on Monday,\u00a0according to the AAA.\u00a0The national average did, under Biden,\u00a0hit a record high of more than $5 per gallon \u2013 about $5.02,\u00a0according to AAA data\u00a0\u2013 but that happened in June 2022, after the Russian invasion of Ukraine\u00a0triggered a global spike in oil prices. The RNC videos offered no indication that the national average has since fallen substantially. Also, the national average on the day Trump left office in January 2021\u00a0was about $2.39 per gallon, not $2.20, though it was lower than $2.20 in some states. From CNN\u2019s Daniel Dale RNC video doesn\u2019t mention Trump was president during one of the years Americans\u2019 incomes dropped A video played during the Republican National Convention, which attacked President Joe Biden\u2019s handling of the economy, featured a narrator saying, \u201cThe Wall Street Journal has reported today that Americans\u2019 incomes have gone down three straight years.\u201d Facts First: This needs context. The RNC video left out an inconvenient fact from the Wall Street Journal report that was published in 2023: one of the three straight years in which inflation-adjusted median household income went down was 2020, when Donald Trump was president. The Covid-19 pandemic played a major role in the decline, but the ad failed to explain that not all of the three years were under Biden. Real median household income fell from $78,250 in 2019 to $76,660 in 2020 (all under Trump), then edged down to $76,330 in 2021 (mostly under Biden) and fell more substantially to $74,580 in 2022 (all under Biden). Figures for 2023 and 2024-to-date are not available. From CNN\u2019s Daniel Dale RNC video cites outdated inflation figure Attacking President Joe Biden\u2019s handling of the economy, the Republican National Convention featured a video in which a narrator said, \u201cAmerica has reached the highest inflation in 40 years.\u201d Facts First:\u00a0This claim is two years out of date. The year-over-year inflation rate in June 2022,\u00a0about 9.1%, was indeed the highest since late 1981, between 40 and 41 years prior. But inflation has\u00a0declined sharply\u00a0since that Biden-era peak, and the most recent available rate,\u00a0for June 2024, was\u00a0about\u00a03.0%\u00a0\u2013 a rate that, the Biden presidency aside, was\u00a0exceeded as recently as 2011.

{"id": "2024_07_15_politics_vance-trump-political-heir-analysis", "text": "JD Vance is the embodiment of the populist, nationalist and blue-collar transformation of the old establishment Republican Party. That\u2019s why ex-President Donald Trump \u2014 who never forgets the enthusiasms of his base \u2014 picked the Ohio senator as his vice-presidential running mate and effectively named him as a political heir who is now the best positioned Republican to inherit the keys to the MAGA kingdom whenever Trump exits. Trump rarely comes across as someone preoccupied with posterity \u2014 he lives in the present. But the selection of Vance is a nod to his legacy and anoints a leader of the \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d movement who could be active long after its author has left the scene. Perhaps it\u2019s no coincidence that Trump chose an heir apparent a few days after surviving an assassination attempt \u2014 a horrific event that underscored the constitutional duty of vice presidents to secure the chain of power and assume the presidency themselves if the worst happens. The Ohio senator, who is only 39, injects a dash of youth into an election season dominated by two elderly men who have both been elected president. His selection caps a stunning political rise \u2014 he\u2019s been in the Senate for less than two years. And if Trump wins the election in November, a millennial will be a heartbeat away from the presidency. Vance made his name by explaining the political forces behind the rise of Trumpism before most people were paying attention to them in his book \u201cHillbilly Elegy\u201d about growing up poor in Appalachia. The memoir describes human blight, economic pain and drug addiction sown by deindustrialization and globalization in Kentucky and Ohio. Eight years ago, he was often sought out by liberal commentators looking to understand Trumpism\u2019s populist appeal. In many ways, his quintessential American story is the antidote to Trump\u2019s biography. Unlike his new boss, he didn\u2019t come from wealth \u2014 he\u2019s a self-made man who rose from the lowliest of circumstances, heading to the Ohio State University, to service with the Marine Corps in Iraq and graduating with top honors from Yale Law School. Vance is exceedingly smart and eloquent and makes a case for Trumpism and his party\u2019s revolutionary departure from its internationalist, corporate roots in a way that Trump, who operates on emotion and feral political instincts, embodies but rarely intellectualizes. From Never Trumper to true believer But Vance was not always on the Trump train. He was an early, self-declared \u201cNever Trumper\u201d who once called the ex-president \u201cnoxious.\u201d Critics, therefore, accuse him of opportunism and of trashing his beliefs to become one of Trump\u2019s most vocal sycophants in the pursuit of power. The Ohio Republican has turned on the establishment and elite academe that helped make his name with the vehemence that only a defector can muster. But he has explained that he was wrong about Trump and now believes that he was a great president. Since Trump left the White House, Vance has emerged as one of his most vehement defenders and has enthusiastically embraced the idea that the ex-president is the victim of weaponized justice. He has also downplayed the assault on the US Capitol by a mob of Trump supporters on January 6, 2021, and in an interview with CNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins earlier this year, cast doubt on the facts of the most flagrant attack on American democracy of the modern age. \u201cI\u2019m extremely skeptical that Mike Pence\u2019s life was ever in danger. I think \u2026\u00a0in politics, people like to really exaggerate things, from time to time,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of folks, in the Democratic Party act as if January the 6 was the scariest moment of their lives.\u201d Vance went on: \u201cJanuary 6 was a bad day. It was a riot. But the idea that Donald Trump endangered anyone\u2019s lives, when he told them to protest peacefully, it\u2019s just absurd.\u201d But while Vance may juice MAGA turnout, he could alienate the critical suburban voters in swing states, especially women, who usually decide US elections, especially with his hardline position on abortion. Trump critics are also seizing on the pick to question Trump\u2019s commitment to his new unity message after he escaped the assassination attempt. Vance responded with the most searing reaction of any Republican. He claimed that President Joe Biden\u2019s arguments that Trump was an \u201cauthoritarian fascist\u201d led to the attempt to kill him, despite the motive of the gunman being unclear. There is always intense debate about how much a vice-presidential nominee really matters in an electoral context and whether such picks really help put a ticket over the top. But the Vance move makes a lot of sense when Biden\u2019s own team has said his best path to a second term runs through the Blue Wall states. Most assessments of the electoral map suggest Biden must at a minimum win those states \u2013 Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin \u2013 and add a single electoral vote in the Omaha, Nebraska, area to get to the 270 electoral votes needed to win the presidency. Vance has a particular talent for talking to voters in the post-industrial Midwest. He won his Senate seat by more than 6 points in 2022 and he is an avatar for the political forces that turned the Buckeye State into a Republican bastion after years as a political bellwether. Why European allies won\u2019t relish the Vance pick The new Republican vice-presidential pick is also the embodiment of Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d policies abroad and augurs another rocky period between the US and its European allies if the ex-president reclaims the Oval Office. He is in the vanguard of a new generation of pro-Trump lawmakers who reject the traditional US foreign policy consensus. He traveled to the belly of the internationalist beast at the Munich Security Conference earlier this year to rebuke America\u2019s European allies. And at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in the US, he explained why he thinks America should no longer finance Ukraine\u2019s fight for its freedom. \u201cI have \u2026 Republican colleagues, who are much more emotionally invested in what\u2019s going on 6,000 miles away than they are in their own country,\u201d Vance said at the conference. He backs Trump\u2019s position that the war in Ukraine should end and the killing should stop. \u201cIt\u2019s good for the country to have somebody saying, \u2018How long does this go on? How much money are we supposed to funnel into this country?\u2019\u201d said Vance, who has also argued the US lacks the manufacturing capacity or sufficient military reserves to send more ammunition to Ukraine. \u201cIf you care about Ukraine, but most importantly, if you care about America, you should be wanting this thing to come to some diplomatic resolution.\u201d Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky rebuked Vance\u2019s criticism of the war in an interview with CNN\u2019s Collins in February. \u201cTo understand it is to come to the front line to see what\u2019s going on, to speak with the people, then to go to civilians to understand \u2026 what will (happen to) them without this support. And he will understand that millions \u2026 will be killed. It\u2019s a fact,\u201d Zelensky said. \u201cOf course, he doesn\u2019t understand. God bless you don\u2019t have the war on your territory,\u201d he said. But Vance is listening to Trump, not Zelensky or the foreign policy establishment. It\u2019s not hard to imagine him deep in the West Wing as vice president implementing the hardline \u201cAmerica First\u201d agenda at home and abroad, almost like a modern day \u2014 and far more populist \u2014 version of former Vice President Dick Cheney in the Bush administration. Ultimately, Trump is clearly comfortable with Vance, a favorite of his firebrand son Donald Trump Jr. They are cut from the same ideological and temperamental cloth \u2014 unlike the ex-president and his first vice presidential pick, the pious Mike Pence, who eventually broke with Trump on January 6 after concluding he lacked the constitutional power to throw the 2020 election to his boss. \u201cI think he was a good president. And I think that he made the country more prosperous. And I think he made the world more peaceful,\u201d Vance said of his future ticket mate in his interview with Collins, saying,\u00a0 \u201cWhat gives me pause is another four years of Biden\u2019s administration, where he\u2019s opened the borders, and where you have, effectively a conflict, a major world conflict in nearly every continent in the world.\u201d There is little distance between Vance and Trump. The Ohio senator made sure of that and it\u2019s made him one of the most significant rising powers in American politics.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/15/politics/vance-trump-political-heir-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/16/2024", "section": "us"}}
