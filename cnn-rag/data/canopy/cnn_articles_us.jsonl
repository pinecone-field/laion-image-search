{"id": "2024_05_12_us_general-william-sherman-civil-war-auction", "text": "At first,\u00a0it was the rare binding that caught the eye of Danielle Linn, a senior book specialist with Fleischer\u2019s Auctions. While cataloging items once owned by the Union Army General, William Tecumseh Sherman, she came across a copy of a memoir written by Ulysses S. Grant. The book had been made with rare \u201ctree calf\u201d binding \u2013 leather chemically treated to create the likeness of a tree on the cover. Linn set it aside, but later picked it up to check the publication date. The specialist opened the back cover accidentally, she said, and that\u2019s where she found Sherman\u2019s handwriting. Not only was it a first edition of the 1885 memoir, it was full of Sherman\u2019s personal notes and recollections. The Civil War general, who would go down in history for his \u201cMarch to the Sea,\u201d became close friends with the future President Grant during the war, writing,\u00a0\u201cFrom the day I reported to him from Paducah till his death our relations were as brothers rather than as commander and commanded.\u201d The historical find is significant because it contains Sherman\u2019s annotations, including a recollection of his first meeting with President Abraham Lincoln, in a book that\u2019s considered one of the finest memoirs by a president or general. Born in Lancaster, Ohio, Sherman played a key role in the Civil War. His\u00a0\u201chard war\u201d military strategy for the Union\u00a0included the destruction of infrastructure and some personal property through the South in his famous march. Sherman is also known for his Special Field Order 15, often referred to as \u201c40 acres and a mule\u201d \u2013 an initial attempt at reparations for newly freed slaves. But the auction, which will take place on Tuesday, isn\u2019t without controversy. One official at a museum dedicated to the Sherman family worries the items will land in private hands, and out of the view of the public. Nonetheless, the find has been personally satisfying to Linn, who, upon her discovery, shouted for the auction house\u2019s founder, Adam Fleischer. He, too, was surprised. \u201cThis is probably the most important offering of Civil War antiques that have been sold in recent memory,\u201d Fleischer said, noting the major general was \u201cone of the most significant figures of the Civil War in American history.\u201d Fleischer and Linn also found more notes, ranging from corrections to Sherman\u2019s own opinions on\u00a0events in other books. \u201cBeing able to open up these books and seeing that he had inscribed and signed his name on so many of them was a real moment of discovery,\u201d Linn told CNN. The collection belonging to Sherman\u2019s descendants, which has never been offered for sale before, was valuable even before Linn\u2019s accidental discovery. It includes the general\u2019s wartime sword, the rank insignia from his uniform during the war and his family Bible. Sherman\u2019s descendants said they are offering the relics \u201cwith great pride and anticipation.\u201d \u201cWe are confident they will be cherished and preserved by new custodians, who will continue to honor the remarkable contributions of General William Tecumseh Sherman for years to come,\u201d they said in a statement. Fleischer said he\u2019s already seen a great deal of enthusiasm from museums and institutions, and the auction house estimates the entire collection could sell for over $100,000 \u2013 or a great deal more. Online bidding has begun, and the sword alone has an estimate of between $40,000 and $60,000. The\u00a0Sherman House Museum in Lancaster, Ohio, is watching the auction closely. In a March 21 statement, the museum\u2019s director, Michael Johnson, said winning bids by private collectors might mean the items would no longer be available for public view. \u201cThe thought of these amazing pieces of history being stored away in a collector\u2019s basement is disheartening,\u201d the statement read. Johnson told CNN many people have said they\u2019re hoping the museum will get a hold of the items.\u00a0In an effort to do so, the museum began accepting pledges and over the past month, they\u2019ve raised around $90,000, Johnson said. \u201cAs the only museum in the country dedicated to the Sherman family, we would love to see as many of these as possible displayed in our museum,\u201d he said. If the museum isn\u2019t able to acquire the relics, Johnson said he hopes a private buyer would be willing to loan the items to the museum \u2013 especially Sherman\u2019s sword. After some criticism from private collectors, Johnson apologized for the initial statement, noting, \u201cWe have had amazing collectors in the museum presenting their items for our round tables and I greatly appreciate their efforts.\u201d Fleischer said the auction house \u201ccan\u2019t give any preference to private or public buyers, but we hope that everything will go in the hands of responsible custodians.\u201d Still flush from the historical find, Fleisher and Lin are expecting a large crowd for the auction. \u201cI don\u2019t know if there\u2019s anything quite so significant in my career,\u201d Linn said. \u201cIt was a real privilege to feel like a detective finding these clues and opening up and finding an American treasure.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/12/us/general-william-sherman-civil-war-auction/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/13/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_05_12_us_win-rozario-nypd-killing", "text": "\u201cPlease don\u2019t shoot,\u201d Notan Eva Costa, a 48-year-old Bangladeshi immigrant living in Queens, begged the two New York City police officers who entered her home after her teenage son called 911. Lying on the floor, the mother of two stretched her hand out to the officers, terror and distress audible in her voice. It was too late. One of the police officers fired his gun at least four times, fatally wounding 19-year-old Win Rozario. Less than two minutes had passed since police entered the family\u2019s home. The officers \u201ckilled my son in minutes,\u201d Costa said through an interpreter at a Wednesday news conference. \u201cBefore they came, everything was calm. Then they came and created chaos and murdered him in front of me.\u201d In the weeks since Rozario\u2019s death, the shooting has attracted scrutiny from social justice and mental health advocates, particularly after the state attorney general\u2019s office released footage from body cameras worn by the two responding officers and announced it is investigating the case. Critics say the police\u2019s use of lethal force was unnecessary and reflects a pattern of violence against people with mental illness. In a news release, the NYPD said it is \u201cfully cooperating\u201d with the investigation as well as conducting its own probe, adding, \u201cWe continually seek to improve how we respond to requests for assistance, and we acknowledge that there is much work to be done. New Yorkers expect and deserve nothing less.\u201d The two officers are on \u201cmodified assignment,\u201d meaning they\u2019re still working but not carrying firearms or shields. Rozario\u2019s family, as well as local organizations like the Justice Committee and Desis Rising Up and Moving, have called for the officers to be fired and prosecuted. They also have goals far beyond penalizing the officers who killed Rozario. They\u2019re calling for New York City to radically shift its approach to responding to people in crisis. Rather than sending armed police officers to respond to every 911 call, they envision a world where trained mental health responders could respond to people experiencing crises, helping to deescalate tense situations and connect patients with health care. Mental health crisis intervention programs have already been implemented in cities like Eugene, Oregon, and Denver, Colorado, as well as across 23 counties in South Dakota and elsewhere across the country. In New York, a similar but limited pilot program called \u201cB-Heard\u201d dispatches EMTs and trained mental health responders to some emergency calls. Speaking through a translator in front of dozens of supporters holding images of Rozario, his mother described her son as a \u201cquiet and polite\u201d teenager who dreamed of one day joining the military \u201cbecause he wanted to do something for this country.\u201d He loved to cook for his mother and help her with her beading handicrafts, she recalled. \u201cThat is who the police stole from us,\u201d she said, tearing up at times as she described her son. \u201cI tried to protect my son. I begged the police not to shoot, but the police still killed him.\u201d \u201cWin Rozario would be alive today if the NYPD had already been removed from mental health,\u201d said Loyda Col\u00f3n, executive director of the Justice Committee, at a Wednesday news conference. 2 minutes, 4 gunshots, and a young life cut short Rozario was in the throes of an apparent mental health crisis when he called 911 on March 27. \u201cHe\u2019s having an episode,\u201d his younger brother, Utsho, told the two police officers who arrived. \u201cHe don\u2019t even know what he\u2019s doing, to be honest.\u201d In the apartment, the officers found Rozario standing in the kitchen with his mother nearby. When an officer moved toward the kitchen, Rozario seemed to become distressed and picked up a pair of kitchen scissors, which his mother tried to take from his hand. Rozario moved toward the officers again with the scissors, prompting one officer to fire a taser at him and the other to draw his gun. Rozario\u2019s mother clutched him as an officer shouted, \u201clet go of him and back up,\u201d and appeared to fire a taser again at the teenager, who collapsed to the floor. Rozario\u2019s mother then moved away from him and toward officers, holding the scissors. She walked back to Rozario, seemingly trying to comfort him, prompting an officer to yell, \u201cTell her to get the f**k out of the way!\u201d  \u201cDon\u2019t shoot,\u201d she said to the officers. An officer again fired a taser at Rozario, who grabbed the scissors and again moved toward the officers. Utsho moved in and all three family members held each other as the officers continued to shout for them to get out of the way. Rozario\u2019s mother and brother both fell to the floor. Rozario was standing and holding the scissors, seemingly several feet away from the officers, when one officer appeared to begin shooting at him. He fell to the floor after multiple shots. Col\u00f3n said the footage shows the responding officers \u201crecklessly escalated the situation multiple times,\u201d endangering Rozario\u2019s mother and brother as well. \u201cThey had multiple opportunities to de-escalate, to detain, and they did not do that,\u201d Col\u00f3n said. Officers shouted \u201cput it down\u201d multiple times at Rozario but did not otherwise talk to him during the body camera footage. \u201cThere was no danger happening at all, until those officers arrived with their guns,\u201d the family\u2019s attorney said at the news conference. Michael Alcazar, a retired NYPD detective and adjunct professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, told CNN he saw multiple ways the officers could have possibly avoided shooting Rozario. Before entering the home or when Rozario\u2019s mother took the scissors from him, they could have asked his mother and brother to leave the apartment, leaving just Rozario inside, and then called emergency services. This is consistent with the \u201cisolate and contain\u201d protocol NYPD advises officers to use when dealing with \u201cmentally ill or emotionally disturbed persons.\u201d Additionally, the officers could have used nonlethal weapons, like nightsticks, to gain control of Rozario and take the scissors away, according to Alcazar. Another vision for crisis intervention Rozario wasn\u2019t the first New Yorker to die at the hands of police while experiencing a mental health crisis. Community Access, a non-profit supporting people with mental health concerns in New York, says at least 26 New Yorkers experiencing mental health crises have been shot and killed by police since 2007. Situations involving \u201cemotionally disturbed persons\u201d are the second most common situation in which police officers use force, according to the NYPD\u2019s 2022 use of force report. Officers used force in 1,740 encounters with emotionally disturbed persons in 2022, the report showed. The report does not include data on lethal force used against emotionally disturbed persons. The NYPD told CNN they respond to approximately 155,000 \u201cemergency calls involving people in the throes of an emotional or mental health crisis\u201d each year. Fewer than 1% of those calls result in police using any form of force and fewer involve deadly force, the NYPD reports. Although they are uncommon, deaths like those of Rozario, Kawaski Trawick, Deborah Danner, and Mohamed Bah have drawn scrutiny to the dangers of using police to respond to people experiencing acute crisis, and what an alternative system of support might look like. In Eugene and Springfield, Oregon, for instance, specialized crisis responders and medics have responded to crisis calls for more than 30 years through a mobile intervention program called CAHOOTS, an acronym for \u201cCrisis Assistance Helping Out On The Streets.\u201d The program diverts between 3% and 8% of calls which would otherwise be handled by police, according to the Eugene Police Department, including providing care for people who are \u201cintoxicated, mentally ill, or disoriented.\u201d Jeremy Gates, the executive director of the White Bird Clinic, which runs CAHOOTS, told CNN part of the program\u2019s success lies in the trust its responders have built with clients over the years. \u201cPeople will call and say, I don\u2019t want the police, I want CAHOOTS,\u201d he said. And in Colorado, one former deputy was convicted of reckless endangerment, another pleaded guilty to two misdemeanors and six other officers are currently facing charges for shooting and killing a man experiencing a mental health crisis, a similar program called Support Team Assisted Response, known as STAR, operates in Denver. \u201cWe respond in a trauma-informed and empathetic manner,\u201d STAR Program Specialist Evan Thompkins told CNN in an interview. \u201cWe come in a kind and caring way, where we can kind of meet people where they\u2019re at, really get down on their level and provide more of a non-authoritarian approach.\u201d He noted for some people and communities, just the presence of uniformed police members can cause a situation to \u201cescalate.\u201d Some \u201ccommunities are afraid of the police and don\u2019t want to interact with the police,\u201d he said. Fountain House, a non-profit providing support for people living with serious mental illness in New York, has also highlighted Rozario\u2019s death to call for a vast expansion of the city\u2019s mental health intervention programs. Mental illness is primarily \u201ca public health issue, not a public safety issue,\u201d Arvind Sooknanan, a member of the board of directors at Fountain House, told CNN. The organization has laid out a plan for New York to \u201cmove as many mental health crisis calls as possible out of the 911 system\u201d and integrate the existing 988 mental health hotline \u201cwith the social service system to help people address root cause stressors.\u201d For Sooknanan, Rozario\u2019s case hits particularly close to home: Sooknanan has been living with serious mental illness since he was 15 and also comes from a South Asian background, like Rozario. The case \u201chas eaten away at me the past few weeks,\u201d he said. \u201cHe was only 19 years old. There was no reason for him to die.\u201d \u201cI want other people to have the same opportunities I did, to move forward with their lives, to find meaning, to find community,\u201d said Sooknanan, who is also working to help develop crisis intervention programs in other states. Ken Zimmerman, Fountain House\u2019s CEO, told CNN he envisions a future in which \u201cthe knowledge and awareness of what serious mental health conditions are is so much more widespread, that the kind of stigma and fear that drives so much is hugely diminished.\u201d Additionally, he emphasized the importance of expanding the city\u2019s resources and infrastructure for mental health care \u2013 a process that might take years. And those resources and planning need to take into account the lived experience of people living with serious mental illnesses themselves, he said. For the Rozario family, the fight to provide an alternative to police response for people in mental health crisis is powered by a dream that no other family should have to experience the anguish they\u2019ve felt. \u201cNo mother should have to go through the pain I\u2019m going through,\u201d Rozario\u2019s mother said. \u201cI hope no other mothers go through this in the future.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/12/us/win-rozario-nypd-killing/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/13/2024", "section": "us"}}

You can sign up\u00a0right here. You can listen to an audio version of the newsletter by clicking the same link. Like it or not, most business leaders, analysts and economists agree that artificial intelligence will play an outsized role in shaping the future of the US economy. The next few years will be critical in defining the shape of the AI revolution, and economist and former dean of Columbia Business School Glenn Hubbard is worried the United States isn\u2019t ready to accept the disruptions that come along with it. Before the Bell spoke with Hubbard about what he sees as an increasingly dangerous problem that could stifle growth for years to come. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. Why is this the right time to refocus on AI and economic growth? Growth is always the right answer. Anything we want to do as a society \u2014 if we want to fight climate change, if we want to rebuild our military, want to educate and train people \u2014 it\u2019s all about economic growth. So how come politicians aren\u2019t talking about this? Imagine I have a coin in my hand. The head side is growth, and we all think that\u2019s great. But the tail side is disruption. Economists believe that you can\u2019t have growth without disruption. And since our political class doesn\u2019t know how to handle disruption, they\u2019ve stopped talking about growth. A better idea might be to handle disruption \u2014 actually help people get trained, get educated, help communities, and yet that\u2019s disappeared off the radar screen. The fact that we are interested in growth is hardly a surprise. The big surprise is why we don\u2019t talk about it. I think the answer is that it\u2019s just hard for politicians. When you talk about disruption, are you talking about the job losses that will come with greater use of artificial intelligence? Think of two waves. Over the past three or four decades, technological change and some globalization has caused a slow-mo disruption of the job market and communities around the country. Now look at AI, we\u2019re going to have that same disruption except it\u2019s going to be much faster. We\u2019re talking about five years, not 30. And if we couldn\u2019t even handle the slow-mo, 30-year process, how are we going to do it in five? We really need to rethink how we manage change. Because of course we want the change from AI. The question is, how do you help people cope? Major CEOs are already talking about how they\u2019re implementing AI in their own businesses. Do we really need government help and intervention? I think it does require some government help because companies will certainly do what\u2019s in their own interest, which would be to become more efficient or use AI to revolutionize processes, but it\u2019s not up to me as a company to prepare my workers for another kind of job. That\u2019s just not my interest. So you do need public policy. I do think it\u2019s simple and we kind of know how to do this. It\u2019s arming community colleges, it\u2019s public-private partnerships between businesses and community colleges. It\u2019s not that we don\u2019t know what to do, but we need to do it. And of course, it\u2019s not going to be free either, the government would have to spend some money. A lot of people would argue that the Biden administration\u2019s CHIPS Act and Inflation Reduction Act have done a lot to increase spending and stimulate growth\u2026\u00a0 I would have gone higher and lower. The real role for government is massive support for basic research that could lead to the next generation of chips. The question is not about today, it\u2019s really about tomorrow. We\u2019re way underspending on R&D, and research is a lot better than writing checks to companies that already have a lot of money. We also need to target things we think are critical for national defense and protect those things. But we don\u2019t have a checkbook big enough to subsidize everything, that\u2019s not going to be the road to recovery. So we either need to go up and support research or go down and try to find narrow pockets to subsidize. Both the CHIPS Act and the Inflation Reduction Act have good headings and leads, but below that there\u2019s a lot of waste. Inflation is still above the Federal Reserve\u2019s 2% target. Wouldn\u2019t prioritizing economic growth exacerbate the problem? Most of what I\u2019m suggesting isn\u2019t going to be a huge demand stimulus. It\u2019s more about supply side productivity, so a little bit less of a concern. But it is still the case that you don\u2019t want to keep expanding the deficit. Policymakers would need to make choices: You could raise some taxes or you cut some other spending. A massive tax hike isn\u2019t likely to happen during an election year\u2026 Yeah, I\u2019m not expecting any candidate to suggest that right now. But it\u2019s really an arithmetic problem. Payments on the national debt, which were essentially zero a couple of years ago, are now as big as defense spending. And so we really have to think this through and the next president is going to have to deal with it. He may not be campaigning on it, but whoever he is, he\u2019s going to have to do something about it. How does moving the focus away from growth hurt Americans\u2019 economic prospects?\u00a0 It will slow down productivity growth. Generative AI will probably be the biggest driver of productivity growth in the next decade or two, not so much because it\u2019s replacing jobs but it\u2019s adding to the productivity of a person. But it also means that we have to be willing to tolerate the fact that some firms will go out of business, some people will lose their jobs and other firms will get very big. Are we willing to do all those things? I would say fine, but I\u2019m not sure our political process is willing to do that. What will the long-term consequences be if the current trend continues?\u00a0 Social support for our system is unraveling and it\u2019s been unraveling for a while. There are many communities and many groups of individuals who don\u2019t really feel like contemporary capitalism is serving them well. And the longer we let that go, we\u2019re really running the risk of killing the golden goose. I don\u2019t even see why this would be unpopular. If I said, \u201cI\u2019m going to have a block grant for communities. I\u2019m going to boost community colleges,\u201d why is that bad? If I\u2019m a governor, I love it. If I\u2019m a mayor, I\u2019m loving it. I can\u2019t quite figure out why we can\u2019t get it done.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/13/investing/premarket-stocks-trading/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/13/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_05_09_us_shenandoah-county-confederate-school-names-reaj", "text": "School board members in Virginia\u2019s Shenandoah County voted early Friday to restore the names of two schools that previously honored Confederate leaders \u2013 nearly four years after a decision was made to change them. The 5-1 vote the school board decided to reinstate the names Stonewall Jackson High School and Ashby Lee Elementary School. The names honor Confederate Gens. Thomas \u201cStonewall\u201d Jackson, Robert E. Lee and Turner Ashby. The schools have been called Mountain View High School and Honey Run Elementary School since July 2021, according to\u00a0board documents.  Prior to the\u00a0vote, several board members criticized how the names were previously changed. Board member Thomas Streett, who voted in favor of restoring the names, described it as a \u201cknee-jerk reaction\u201d that had a lack of involvement from the community.\u00a0 Board member Gloria E. Carlineo told CNN on Friday that she hopes it was clear that their decision had nothing to do with\u00a0race. It was based on doing things the right way, she said, and shows that \u201cwrongful actions by governmental systems can and should be rectified\u201d to restore citizens\u2019 trust in authorities. \u201cThe same system of government, rules, and policies that rectified the evils of slavery and segregation through legal means, is the same system of government that we should rely on without cutting corners and ignoring the people,\u201d Carlineo said. But for Sarah Kohrs, a mother of two\u00a0students attending schools in the district, the decision is sending \u201ca terrible message\u201d to the world.  \u201cWe deplore the board\u2019s decision to regress and \u2018honor\u2019 Civil War figures that consciously betrayed the United States\u00a0and were proponents of slavery and segregation. This decision seems more about vengeance, control, and hatred than heritage or due process,\u201d said Kohrs, who is also part of local group opposed to the change called Claim the Names.  In the years since the 2020 killing of George Floyd, the names of Confederate leaders, Confederate monuments and symbols have been removed from numerous schools, universities, military facilities and even the Washington National Cathedral\u2019s windows. The district in Virginia could be the first school district in the country to reverse course, according to an analysis by Education Week. In the hours of public comment\u00a0that began\u00a0Thursday evening,\u00a0students, parents and county residents spoke on both sides of the issue. \u201cI ask that when you cast your vote, you remember that Stonewall Jackson and others fighting on the side of the Confederacy in this area were intent on protecting the land, the buildings and the lives of those under attack,\u201d said a woman urging the board to restore the Confederate names. \u201cPreservation is the focus of those wishing to restore the names.\u201d Gene Kilby, the last surviving son of James Wilson Kilby, a Virginia civil rights activist who helped desegregate schools in Virginia, criticized the move to keep the names. \u201cWhy are\u00a0we\u00a0here\u00a0tonight\u00a0to\u00a0go\u00a0back\u00a0to\u00a0a\u00a0time\u00a0in\u00a0history that\u00a0was\u00a0very\u00a0cruel, where\u00a0hatred\u00a0and\u00a0racism\u00a0continued\u00a0throughout\u00a0this\u00a0county\u00a0and\u00a0throughout\u00a0the\u00a0 United States?\u201d Kilby said. \u201cIs this the type of legacy that you want to put in Shenandoah County\u2019s public school buildings?\u201d Changes could be a six-figure expense Nearly four years ago, the Shenandoah County School Board moved to rename the schools\u00a0as part of a resolution condemning racism and affirming the district\u2019s \u201ccommitment to an inclusive school environment,\u201d \u00a0according to\u00a0school board documents. But the composition of the school board is different now than it was during the 2020 decision \u2013 all six seats are held by different people. The current board took the first steps to restore the Confederate-tied names last month\u00a0after a group of residents\u00a0named\u00a0The Coalition for Better Schools\u00a0asked\u00a0them\u00a0to consider restoring the original school names.\u00a0Since then,\u00a0members discussed the issue in a work session, heard public comments and scheduled this week\u2019s vote. In an\u00a0April 22 work session meeting, the six board members criticized how the names were changed in 2020, saying it was wrongly done, was rushed and lacked public input. Board member Carlineo said in the work session that it also \u201ceroded\u201d confidence in the school board. Carlineo told CNN her vote\u00a0would be based on how the names were changed in 2020. \u00a0A decision that, she said, took place within days and with Covid-19 restrictions that limited the community\u2019s input. \u201cSo, for me, the main consideration is whether we, as a democratic nation of laws, will choose to ignore a decision made by a governmental body that exploited the tragedy of COVID or will rectify a wrongful action that has deeply divided our community.\u00a0I choose the latter,\u201d Carlineo told CNN before Thursday\u2019s meeting. CNN reached out to the other five board members for comment ahead of Thursday\u2019s meeting. Jessica Sager, a spokeswoman for Shenandoah County Public Schools, had said the district has not yet obtained quotes on the estimated cost of a\u00a0name change. In 2021, the district estimated it would spend more than $304,000 in costs related to\u00a0changing the two school names and a middle school mascot,\u00a0according to district documents. Those costs\u00a0were related to\u00a0uniforms and equipment for athletic teams,\u00a0resurfacing of a gym floor, signage in buildings and scoreboards, among other items, former Shenandoah County Public Schools Superintendent Mark Johnston told board members during a meeting last year. The motion approved Thursday says private donations would be used for the restoration of the school names and not by \u201cthe school system or government tax funds, though the SCPS will oversee disbursements relating to restoration costs,\u201d according to the meeting\u2019s agenda. Some residents refuse to move on, parent says Parents and residents expressed their opposition and support to restoring the school names. In an April 3 letter to the school board, the Coalition for Better Schools said it\u00a0believed \u201cthat revisiting this decision is essential to honor our community\u2019s heritage and respect the wishes of the majority.\u201d The group told CNN before the vote took place that it \u201chas full confidence in our current school board to listen to the voice of its constituents and follow the wishes of the majority in the county. Unfortunately, the previous school board did not take those things into consideration. We believe that \u2018We the People\u2019 is an important part of our Constitution and should be upheld at every level of our government.\u201d Sarah Kohrs, the mother of two\u00a0students attending schools in the district, is among several parents and residents who\u00a0said ahead of the vote that they were opposed to restoring the Confederacy-tied names and were frustrated\u00a0it was being considered. \u201cIt\u2019s very frustrating to know that here we are four years after that, and we still have a small portion of the community that just refuses to move on,\u201d Kohrs told CNN. She said attention should be focused on what students want and need to succeed, like repairing leaking roofs, a sound system for track meets, or having enough varsity letters with the current school names. \u201cWe still don\u2019t even have all of\u00a0our athletic equipment from the name change in 2020. We\u2019re still utilizing old hurdles, sometimes that have the name of Stonewall on them,\u201d Kohrs told CNN. Shenandoah County Public Schools serves more than 5,600 students, and about 75% are White, 18% Hispanic and 3% Black, data from the state\u2019s department education shows.

{"id": "2024_05_11_us_tara-louise-baker-georgia-murder-arrest", "text": "More than two decades after authorities discovered a University of Georgia law student\u2019s body at her apartment, where they say a fire was set intentionally, a man has been arrested and charged in connection with the cold case. Tara Louise Baker was found dead in her Athens, Georgia, home by Athens-Clarke County firefighters on January 19, 2001, a day before her 24th birthday, according to a news release from the Georgia Bureau of Investigation. On Thursday, state and county investigators said Edrick Lamont Faust, 48, was arrested and faced several charges in connection with Baker\u2019s death, including felony murder, aggravated assault, arson and aggravated sodomy, the news release says. Faust, a resident of Athens, remains in jail on a $15,000 bond, according to Clarke County Sheriff\u2019s Office jail records. CNN could not determine whether Faust has an attorney. \u201cTara Louise Baker was a hardworking student with a bright future ahead of her,\u201d GBI director Chris Hosey said in a statement. \u201cTara\u2019s life was stolen from her in a horrific act of violence.\u201d Baker, a first-year law student from East Point, Georgia, was last seen alive by a friend at the UGA Law School Library on January 18, 2001, around 7:30 p.m., according to GBI\u2019s unsolved homicide webpage on the case. Authorities say Baker, while still at the library, called the same friend around 9:46 p.m. to make sure they had arrived home safely. Baker told her friend she planned to leave the library around 10 p.m. The homicide investigation into Baker\u2019s death ran cold for 23 years. The GBI\u2019s Cold Case Unit partnered with the Athens-Clarke County Police Department in September 2023 \u201cto conduct an in-depth review and analysis of the ongoing investigation into Baker\u2019s death,\u201d according to the news release. Athens-Clarke County police chief Jerry Saulters, who was an officer at the crime scene in January 2001, said in a statement that he\u2019d hoped for years Baker\u2019s family would find justice. \u201cI remember being there during that horrific time,\u201d Saulters said. \u201cSeeing this case now full circle, I appreciate the hard work of the detectives, from then and now. Knowing that the evidence collected at that time contributed to the arrest today gives me tremendous pride in all the officers who worked this case over the years.\u201d 2023 act named for Baker helps her case The Baker family says they have long waited for an arrest announcement, but \u201cit is not a day without grief and unanswered questions,\u201d they said in a statement provided by Athens true crime podcast host Cameron Jay Harrelson, who covered the student\u2019s story in a series on the Classic City Crime podcast. \u201cOur family is eternally grateful to the Cold Case Unit with the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, the Athens-Clarke County Police Department and Federal Bureau of Investigation for their dedication and diligence in bringing us closer to the truth that has eluded us for 23 years,\u201d the family\u2019s statement read. Harrelson, who connected with Baker\u2019s family four years ago through a mutual friend with Baker\u2019s sister, said the family has long advocated for progress in the cold case. \u201cA mother\u2019s heart never gives up, she never gave up on seeking the truth,\u201d Harrelson told CNN of Virginia Baker, Tara Louise Baker\u2019s mother. The late law student, who in May 2003 was posthumously awarded her law degree from UGA\u2019s School of Law, is remembered by family, friends, colleagues and classmates as a \u201cchampion of justice\u201d who was \u201cfiercely loyal,\u201d according to Harrelson, who said he interviewed hundreds of those who knew Baker for the podcast series. \u201cShe believed in the application of the law. She believed in fighting for people that were less fortunate or whose society might consider to be underdogs, or the left behind and forgotten,\u201d Harrelson said. \u201cI\u2019ve heard many stories of how she was never afraid to say what she felt, but always with kindness,\u201d he added. Georgia\u2019s Coleman-Baker Act, which established a new cold case unit within the GBI, according to CNN affiliate WRDW, was passed last year and named in honor of Baker and Rhonda Sue Coleman, an 18-year-old high school student who was killed in Jeff Davis County, Georgia, in 1990. The arrest of Faust in Baker\u2019s case makes it the first case solved by the GBI\u2019s new cold case unit, a GBI spokesperson told CNN on Saturday. Harrelson says he along with the Baker and Coleman families advocated for the law. \u201cWe did not have any knowledge that this bill would ever affect change for the Baker family themselves,\u201d Harrelson said. \u201cThe way we spoke about it often was that even if this doesn\u2019t help Tara\u2019s case, there are countless families out there that with a second look, (the bill) could help.\u201d He added: \u201cI could not have thought of a better way to honor Tara Baker\u2019s life and legacy, a legacy of fighting for justice and believing in the law, than for this bill to have not only been named after her but to have brought about justice for her.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/11/us/tara-louise-baker-georgia-murder-arrest/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/13/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "us_beach-read-summer-books-cec", "text": "Summer is almost here, and you\u2019re looking forward to that long-awaited vacation. You can even picture it: \ufeffThe sun is shining, the waves are rolling gently and you\u2019re curling up with a book. Perhaps you\u2019re diving into a steamy romance novel or losing yourself in a page-turning thriller. Maybe a work of romantasy is captivating you instead. Whatever your flavor of escapism, it\u2019s likely that it could be classified as a \u201cbeach read\u201d \u2014 that oft-dismissed, unofficial category of books that readers gravitate toward in the warmer months. But what exactly constitutes a beach read? And where did that idea come from? Here\u2019s what to know about the popular term. What makes a \u2018beach read\u2019 A beach read is, naturally, the sort of book one might read at the beach \u2014 or at a lake, a resort or another typical summer destination. The books populating \u201cbeach read\u201d round-ups from booksellers, publishers and periodicals generally fall into the category of commercial fiction, designed to lure in readers with their saturated covers and playful illustrations. They\u2019re also almost always marketed to women. Amanda Bergeron, who acquires contemporary and historical book club fiction for Penguin Random House\u2019s imprint Berkley, has published several authors whose books frequently appear on \u201cbeach read\u201d lists: Carley Fortune, Jasmine Guillory and Emily Henry, to name a few. When looking for the next big summer read, Bergeron says she\u2019s drawn to fast-paced stories with compelling characters. If it transports the reader to another location, all the better. \u201cIt\u2019s something that you\u2019re excited to spend time with and you can\u2019t put down \u2014 something that you\u2019re just so eager to get back to that it will go with you wherever you go, whether that\u2019s the park, the pool, the couch, your yard or even the beach,\u201d she says. Some books just scream summer, presenting an obvious opportunity to be marketed as a beach read, according to Bergeron. If it takes place in the summer, perhaps on an island or another breezy locale, there\u2019s a good chance it could be a beach read. Sometimes, the \u201cbeach read\u201d designation is so fitting that it announces itself in the title, like Fortune\u2019s 2022 romance novel \u201cEvery Summer After,\u201d Jenn McKinlay\u2019s 2023 rom-com \u201cSummer Reading\u201d or Henry\u2019s aptly named 2020 \u201cBeach Read.\u201d While the romance genre tends to dominate the \u201cbeach read\u201d landscape, the label isn\u2019t limited to romance, says Bergeron. A beach read can just as easily be a suspenseful thriller or a puzzle-box mystery novel \u2014 at least for Bergeron, it\u2019s a book that readers will want to discuss with others and bring along with them on vacation. In other words, a beach read doesn\u2019t ask the reader to ponder the grim realities of the modern world or plunge into the depths of the human experience. Rather, it offers a break from the slog of daily life and the constant drumbeat of depressing news stories. \u201cFor God\u2019s sake, I do not want to be challenged,\u201d Celeste Ballard declared in a 2014 humor column for The New Yorker about how to pick a summer read. \u201cNo \u2018hard\u2019 literature that I have to slog through to discover a deep and twisted meaning.\u201d Why some dislike the term \u2018beach read\u2019 Even though the \u201cbeach read\u201d designation can go hand in hand with commercial success (books labeled as such frequently make bestseller lists), it\u2019s also a loaded term. Author Jennifer Weiner, whose books are often categorized as beach reads, rejected the label for years before eventually embracing it \u2014 an internal conflict she examined in a 2020 essay for Goodreads. \u201cIt\u2019s not hard to discern a whiff of Coppertone-scented sexism in the label,\u201d she wrote. \u201cFast-paced, diverting books that are by or for men are called thrillers or mysteries or sometimes just plain old books, while the ladies get every kind of label, from chick lit to women\u2019s fiction to upmarket women\u2019s fiction to domestic fiction to, well, beach books.\u201d Books labeled as beach reads tend to emphasize plot and characters over elegant prose and heavier themes. To some, the implication is that the book is less serious or less worthy of one\u2019s time. Dakota Johnson, who launched a book club earlier this year, seemed to echo that assumption in an interview with Bustle: \u201cOur book club is literary fiction. It\u2019s not beach reads. It\u2019s not silly,\u201d she said. Though the term \u201cbeach read\u201d is commonly associated with frothy romance novels, Bergeron says that notion can be reductive. Beach reads can absolutely be frivolous \u2014 sometimes, that\u2019s exactly what you need \u2014 but some of the most celebrated beach reads of the past few years explore weightier topics all while delivering on the promise of fun. For instance, Fortune\u2019s 2023 bestseller \u201cMeet Me at the Lake\u201d depicted postpartum anxiety and the loss of a family member, while Kiley Reid\u2019s buzzy 2019 debut \u201cSuch A Fun Age\u201d dealt with race and privilege. \u201cA Love Like the Sun,\u201d a forthcoming novel from Riss M. Neilson, includes representation of chronic illness. \u201cThe fact that writers are able to do all that and offer readers an escape or a big heart hug is just really exciting,\u201d Bergeron says. The \u2018summer read\u2019 is a 19th century invention The term \u201cbeach read\u201d first appeared in literary periodicals around 1990, according to an article by the Los Angeles Public Library \u2014 though it\u2019s unclear who coined it. The concept of the summer read goes back much further, says Donna Harrington-Lueker, a professor of English and communications at Salve Regina University and author of Books for Idle Hours: Nineteenth-Century Publishing and the Rise of Summer Reading. Though now ingrained in our culture, the notion of summer reading was actually a 19th century invention of the publishing industry that sprung up in response to the creation of the summer vacation. Summer reading was initially a ritual enjoyed by rich men, who could afford to engage in leisure travel and unwind with poetry and literature, according to Harrington-Lueker. That changed in the mid-to-late 19th century as the US rapidly industrialized after the Civil War. The construction of railroads and grand hotels made summer vacations more accessible for the middle classes, giving rise to what Harrington-Lueker calls the \u201csummer novel.\u201d The summer novel was specifically geared toward women, Harrington-Lueker explains. The books generally took place over the summer at a resort and tended to follow the rhythms of the season: There might be scenes anchored around a picnic or a fireworks display, with detailed descriptions of what the female characters were wearing. Typically, the books ended with the heroine getting engaged. \u201cThese become lessons in how you practice summer leisure, and they become very popular,\u201d Harrington-Lueker says. The proliferation of the summer novel also generated backlash from some religious leaders who considered them a temptation and devoid of morality. The Reverend T. De Witt Talmage notably declared in an 1876 sermon that \u201cthere is more pestiferous trash read among the intelligent classes in July and August than in all the other ten months of the year.\u201d \u201cWould it not be an awful thing for you to be struck with lightning some day when you had in your hand one of these paper-covered romances\u2014the hero a Parisian rou\u00e9, the heroine an unprincipled flirt \u2026 ?\u201d he chided at the time. But throughout the late 1800s, the publishing industry worked to counter such notions and present summer reading as something desirable, Harrington-Lueker says. Magazines such as The Atlantic Monthly or Harper\u2019s ran advertisements with women clad in muslin dresses, novel in hand, while literary critics extolled the benefits of lighter reading. \u201cThe cakes and ale of literature have their legitimate time and place after the more solid intellectual dishes of the past season have been digested,\u201d an 1887 editorial in the literary review Book Buyer reads. Much like today, summer reads at the time were seen as an escape from the turmoil of the real world. One 1885 magazine column Harrington-Lueker encountered in her research called that summer\u2019s novels \u201cpeculiarly trivial\u201d and hypothesized that publishers were responding to the cholera epidemic, believing \u201cthat the general mind will be so far distraught by anxiety as to have no attention to spare for being critical.\u201d Reading for escape vs reading for enrichment As publishers solidified the association between summer and light reading, some institutions promoted more serious reading during the season, Harrington-Lueker said. One notable example is the Chautauqua movement, a late 19th and early 20th century educational program that sought to help Americans improve themselves through reading. From schools requiring students to read so-called classics in the summer to the anti-racist reading lists that were ubiquitous in 2020, the idea of summer as a time for personal enrichment persists today. Indeed, some people reach for heftier titles during vacation precisely because they finally have the time to dig into them. \u201cSummer reading becomes a point where people automatically begin to think, \u2018How should we be spending our summer? Should we be spending it with escapist fiction that\u2019s going to renew us, that\u2019s going to give us this time apart from a more difficult world? Or should we be using it to engage with topics of more consequence?\u2019\u201d Harrington-Lueker says. That push and pull between reading as escapism and reading as enrichment has long been a part of American culture, Harrington-Lueker adds. In recent years, she says she\u2019s observed that the titles appearing on summer reading lists from The New York Times, Oprah\u2019s Book Club and other cultural tastemakers seem less escapist than they were in previous years. But from Bergeron\u2019s perspective, plenty of readers are still looking for a respite \u2014 and this year\u2019s offerings (she name-checked Ashley Poston\u2019s \u201cA Novel Love Story,\u201d Kirsty Greenwood\u2019s \u201cThe Love of My Afterlife\u201d and Tia Williams\u2019 \u201cA Love Song for Ricki Wilde\u201d) give them plenty of opportunities to do so. \u201cReaders want to be transported,\u201d she says. \u201c(When you think of an) escape often you think light, but I think it\u2019s the ability to inhabit another world or another set of shoes and just spend time in those pages.\u201d At a time when the world feels uncertain and overwhelming, Bergeron says, the beach read beckons.", "source": "http://cnn.com/us/beach-read-summer-books-cec/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/13/2024", "section": "us"}}

This week, authorities identified those remains as a woman who was last seen by her family in 1968. Mary Alice Pultz was 25 at the time. She had been raised in Rockville, Maryland, and had two children. She became estranged from her family then and left with the man who was her boyfriend, John Thomas Fugitt, according to a news release\u00a0from the St. Johns County Sheriff\u2019s Office. Fast-forward to 1985 when human remains were found by construction workers who were digging for a walkover on Crescent Beach. The manner of death was determined to be a homicide, the sheriff\u2019s office said. An initial investigation determined the remains belonged to a white female between the ages of 30 and 50. The case went cold over the years and the remains were left unidentified. A facial reconstruction created in 2011 gave officials a few leads, but ultimately left the case unresolved. That was until 2023 when a big break was discovered after the remains were sent to Othram, a lab in Texas specializing in forensic genetic genealogy. With the help of advanced technology at the lab, potential relatives of the victim were identified, the sheriff\u2019s office said. Sgt. Gene Tolbert traveled to meet with those relatives and after more DNA samples and testing, authorities were able to positively identify the remains. Officials identified Pultz as the victim in January 2024, but her homicide remains unsolved. Fugitt, who went by Tommy, also had an alias: Billy Joe Wallace. \u201cWe don\u2019t know if Tommy had anything to do with Mary Alice\u2019s appearance but he is certainly at the top of our list in terms of persons of interest,\u201d Tolbert said in a video posted to Facebook that the sheriff\u2019s office made about the case. In the course of the investigation, officials learned Fugitt died while on death row after he had been convicted and sentenced to death for the murder of his roommate in 1981. \u201cAlthough a significant amount of time has passed, detectives are hopeful that the information developed so far will result in a lead(s) that brings final closure to the family,\u201d the sheriff\u2019s office said. St. Johns County is located on the northeast coast of Florida. Police say they don\u2019t know if Pultz moved to Florida with her boyfriend.

{"id": "2024_05_12_us_civil-war-movie-democracy-blake-cec", "text": "A month after Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, the historian Yuval Noah Harari made a bold claim that seemed delusional. Harari made his claim in an essay on the heroism of the Ukrainian people. He praised embattled Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky, who refused to flee his country when death seemed certain, telling his would-be rescuers that he needed ammunition, not a ride. He marveled at the outnumbered Ukrainian soldiers on Snake Island who told a Russian warship to \u201cgo f**k yourself,\u201d and the civilians blocking Russian tanks with their bodies. \u201cNations are ultimately built on stories,\u201d said Harari, author of \u201cSapiens: A Brief History of Humankind.\u201d \u201cEach passing day adds more stories that Ukrainians will not only tell in the dark days ahead, but in the decades and generations to come \u2026 This is the stuff nations are built from. In the long run, these stories count for more than tanks.\u201d But there\u2019s another type of story that\u2019s gained traction in the US \u2014 the kind that can cause a nation to unravel. The new hit movie, \u201cCivil War,\u201d which has earned more than $100 million worldwide at the box office, is the latest example of a disturbing trend: We no longer seem to know how to tell well-crafted stories that counter those that depict American democracy as doomed. In \u201cCivil War,\u201d tanks trample democracy. The film depicts a near-future America that has been torn apart by seceding regions and militia violence. It features a fascist leader in the White House, an attempted coup and Americans casually killing one another in the streets. One critic called it writer-director Alex Garland\u2019s \u201cvery in-your-face attempt to imagine the unimaginable in America.\u201d It\u2019s hard to imagine any other future for the United States when you consider the popularity of movies like \u201cCivil War.\u201d Most of the stories about the state of America that gain traction in popular culture are the ones that end in its failure. They\u2019re the opposite of the hopeful, unifying stories any country needs to overcome tough times. \u201cCivil War\u201d is part of a growing entertainment genre that, to borrow a phrase from former President Donald Trump, could be called\u00a0\u201cAmerican carnage.\u201d Dystopian movies and TV shows like \u201cThe Walking Dead,\u201d \u201cThe Purge,\u201d \u201cThe Hunger Games,\u201d \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d and \u201cThe Last of Us\u201d all imagine a hellish future in America triggered by an environmental, political or civic collapse. There\u2019s nothing wrong with dystopian thrillers. They serve as cautionary tales and are as old as the book of Revelation. But the messages they send may be more dangerous than the violence depicted onscreen: The collapse of democracy is inevitable. Americans can never transcend their tribalism. Resistance is futile. There\u2019s something wrong when we churn out stories about superheroes in spandex banding together from different galaxies to save the universe, but we can\u2019t tell a popular story that shows Americans coming together to save our country. \u2018Casablanca\u2019 offers a lesson for today\u2019s Americans It didn\u2019t used to be this way. There was another time when democracy in America was under threat, and filmmakers responded by making stirring movies aimed at lifting Americans\u2019 spirit and equipping them for the battles ahead. Consider \u201cCasablanca,\u201d the classic 1942 film. It proves that you can tell a gripping story about patriotism without being sappy or boring. In the film, Humphrey Bogart plays Rick, the cynical owner of a Moroccan nightclub at the onset of World War II. The movie is remembered today for its classic lines (\u201cHere\u2019s looking at you kid\u201d; \u201cWe\u2019ll always have Paris\u201d; \u201cRound up the usual suspects\u201d). Yet there\u2019s another classic line uttered by Rick \u2014 \u201cI stick my neck out for nobody\u201d \u2014 that hints at deeper reasons why \u201cCasablanca\u201d was made. The film is set before Pearl Harbor, when many Americans didn\u2019t want to get involved in a European conflict. Adolf Hitler\u2019s Nazi war machine seemed unstoppable. Fascism was on a global march. Democracy\u2019s future seemed grim. Rick responds to the impending crisis with apathy and cynicism. But when his old flame, played by actress Ingrid Bergman, walks into his club one night, she not only rekindles their romance but his idealism. \u201cThe movie was a patriotic rallying cry that affirmed a sense of national purpose,\u201d wrote Cristo\u0301bal S. Berry-Caba\u0301n in an essay. \u201cThe film emphasized group effort and the value of individual sacrifices for a larger cause. It portrayed World War II as a peoples\u2019 war, typically featuring a diverse group of people and ethnic backgrounds who are thrown together, tested, and molded into a dedicated (force) fighting fascism.\u201d Other films of that era made similar storytelling choices. Legendary Hollywood director Frank Capra made a series of seven patriotic films during World War II called \u201cWhy We Fight\u201d that rallied Americans in the fight against fascism. The entertainer Frank Sinatra,\u00a0a paragon of mid-20th century American masculinity, starred in a short film called \u201cThe House We Live In.\u201d It would be labeled \u201cwoke\u201d today. In the film, Sinatra intervenes when he sees a group of youths chasing a Jewish boy. He tells them that \u201creligion makes no difference, except to a Nazi or someone who\u2019s stupid.\u201d The film was eventually selected by the Library of Congress as being \u201cculturally and historically\u201d significant. Sinatra would later record a song with the same title as the film, which he would perform throughout his career. It included lines like, \u201cThe faces that I see. All races and religions. That\u2019s America to me.\u201d Other World War II-era films like \u201cDon\u2019t be a Sucker,\u201d which emphasized racial and religious tolerance in America, emphasized the same message. It went viral after the 2017 neo-Nazi rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. Those black-and-white films may seem dated and idealistic in an America that has been through the Vietnam War, Watergate, 9/11 and January 6.\u00a0But a country needs a unifying story like a human being needs oxygen. \u201cStories are essential to holding a nation together,\u201d says Kermit Roosevelt III, a historian and author of \u201cThe Nation That Never Was: Reconstructing America\u2019s Story.\u201d \u201cYou have to have something that motivates people to make sacrifices for the nation. If you\u2019re going to fight a war, you have to have people who are willing to lay down their lives. But we more often call on people to make sacrifices for others, to bear burdens, promote justice and help out the less fortunate.\u201d That doesn\u2019t mean we return to the days of making clumsy propaganda films. But Roosevelt says we should keep in mind that most stories contain some elements of propaganda. \u201cWe have this idea that propaganda is bad or ideology is bad,\u201d Roosevelt says. \u201cBut I think that history and education are inherently ideological, and there\u2019s a perspective there and you\u2019re trying to impart lessons.\u201d What united Reagan and Obama Some of America\u2019s most gifted political leaders knew that lesson well. Two of the most consequential presidents in recent memory \u2014 Ronald Reagan and Barack Obama \u2014 were master storytellers. They told stories that made Americans believe in democracy, in one another and in their country\u2019s future. Reagan\u2019s skills were on display when he told a story about American vitality in his farewell speech that echoed Sinatra\u2019s \u201cThe House We Live In.\u201d He said the source of America\u2019s greatness was immigrants. \u201cWhile other countries cling to the stale past, here in America we breathe life into dreams,\u201d Reagan said. \u201cThanks to each wave of new arrivals to this land of opportunity, we\u2019re a nation forever young, forever bursting with energy and new ideas, and always on the cutting edge, always leading the world to the world to the next frontier. This quality is vital to our future as a nation.\u201d Former President Obama cited his personal story as a reason to believe in America, despite the country\u2019s history of not living up to its ideals. The son of a White mother from Kansas and a Black father from Kenya, Obama said his journey to national prominence was proof that the American dream was possible. \u201cI stand here knowing that my story is part of the larger American story, that I owe a debt to all of those who came before me, and that, in no other country on Earth is my story even possible,\u201d he during his speech at the\u00a0 2004 Democratic National Convention, which would eventually catapult him to the White House. It\u2019s easy to dismiss Reagan\u2019s and Obama\u2019s storytelling as the product of clever speechwriters. What candidate doesn\u2019t call America great, or vow that anything is possible in the land of the free and home of the brave? But the dominant American political figure of recent years does not typically tell such unifying stories about his country. Former President Trump coined the term \u201cAmerican carnage\u201d during his 2017 inaugural address. He routinely describes an America that more resembles the failed state depicted in the \u201cCivil War\u201d movie, with his declaration in January that \u201cWe are a nation in decline, we are a failing nation.\u201d Telling that kind of story hasn\u2019t appeared to hurt Trump any more than it hurt the makers of \u201cCivil War.\u201d And, truth be told, stories of American greatness can ring hollow to the descendants of enslaved Americans, the Japanese Americans interned during World War II and those dismayed today by politicians and judges who disregard democratic norms. How can we tell a story today that doesn\u2019t ignore the brutality of American history but still inspires hope for the future? There\u2019s another figure from the past who may help us. Making the \u2018emotional case for democracy\u2019 Walt Whitman, the 19th century writer dubbed \u201cthe poet of democracy,\u201d said that America was his greatest poem. Through poetry, Whitman did what so many seem incapable of today \u2014 he made a multiracial, multireligious democracy in America visceral and exciting, not a civics lesson. In \u201cSongs of Myself,\u201d Whitman vividly described America as \u201cthe Nation of many nations,\u201d and said of himself and his country,\u201d \u201cOf every hue and caste am I, of every rank and religion.\u201d Read Whitman today and one is struck by his expansive definition of what it means to be an American. No one is excluded \u2014 he treats the \u201cboatman and clam-diggers, the farmer, the deacon, the runaway slave, the prostitute and the president with equal reverence, \u201cFor every atom belonging to me as good belongs to you.\u201d The historian Ian Beacock said Whitman offers an answer for those who wonder how they can defend democracy against stories that predict its demise. He suggests they take Whitman\u2019s approach: \u201cState an emotional case for democracy that appeals as much to those who already possess power as to those yet without it.\u201d It starts with being honest about the appeal of other modes of government, like fascism, he says. \u201cIt\u2019s obvious that being free and equal is better than being dominated,\u201d Beacock wrote.\u201d But is it better than dominating? Exerting power over others is a seductive feeling, too, if a dark and dangerous one.\u201d Many democracies simply \u201cunravel\u201d because their citizens get complacent, Beacock says. Democracy is hard to sustain because of its constant demands for compromise. People often go shopping for alternatives that seem like less work, he says. Whitman told stories about democracy that engaged people\u2019s feelings, not just their intellect, Beacock says. \u201cThis is perhaps\u00a0Whitman\u2019s core contribution to democratic thought and practice: the reminder that democracy\u2019s defenders mustn\u2019t neglect political feelings (\u201cLogic and sermons never convince\u201d) and that self-government must appeal to the human heart if it is to last long.\u00a0\u201c We need a new way to tell the American story The Austrian philosopher Ivan Illich was once asked about the most revolutionary way to change a society. He said: \u201cNeither revolution nor reformation can ultimately change a society, rather you must tell a new powerful tale, one so persuasive that it sweeps away the old myths and becomes the preferred story, one so inclusive that it gathers all the bits of our past and our present into a coherent whole, one that even shines some light into our future so that we can take the next step\u2026\u201d How Americans in 2024 decide to tell their national story is up for debate. What shouldn\u2019t be up for discussion, though, is the need for such stories. Isn\u2019t it time we tell a new story of a future America where the White House isn\u2019t going up in flames and citizens aren\u2019t murdering one another? The box office success of \u201cCivil War\u201d ensures, though, that more \u201cAmerican carnage\u201d stories are likely headed our way. Though the film doesn\u2019t take any political sides, it amplifies the same message that autocrats in Russia and China are making through their propaganda: America is hopelessly divided and degenerate, and democracy is doomed. \u00a0 Maybe it\u2019s time to rediscover what Americans of another era knew. Those old black-and-white films about what makes America special may seem corny now. But they understood that you must defend democracy not only with tanks, but with stirring tales that reverberate for generations to come. If you believe democracy is under threat in America, find a \u201cnew powerful tale\u201d that inspires us to believe it has a future. But don\u2019t dispense platitudes or give us a civics lesson. Tell us a story.

{"id": "2024_05_13_investing_gamestop-roaring-kitty", "text": "The surprise social media return of the trader who helped ignite the meme stock frenzy in 2021 sent GameStop shares skyrocketing Monday. The surge had nothing to do with the troubled company\u2019s fundamentals \u2014 and everything to do with a cartoon of a gamer that the trader, nicknamed Roaring Kitty, shared on X. GameStop shares surged 77% on Monday after the account run by Keith Gill shared a meme on X, marking its first post in three years. The shares skyrocketed by more than 110% earlier and were halted for volatility several times on Monday morning. Short sellers have seen $1 billion in mark-to-market losses betting against GameStop on Monday, according to data company S3 Partners. Short sellers aim to turn profits on a stock by borrowing shares, selling them and returning them after purchasing them at a lower price. Shares of AMC Entertainment, another meme stock, popped 84%. Reddit shares climbed 9%. Shares of trading platform Robinhood, which suspended purchases\u00a0of\u00a0GameStop,\u00a0AMC and other meme stocks during the frenzy in 2021, rose 4%. The image Gill posted depicts a man leaning forward in a chair with a video game console in hand. GameStop had posted the same cartoon in February, but with a blue arrow and chair. In Gill\u2019s cartoon, they are red. The meme is interpreted to convey, \u201cwhen things get serious,\u201d according to Know Your Meme. Gill did not immediately respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment. GameStop shares tripped multiple circuit breakers \u2014 a temporary and mandated halt in trading to let investors cool off for a bit. Robinhood denied claims on social media on Monday that it had once again halted GameStop stock purchases on its platform. \u201cThis is incorrect. Robinhood has not shut down the purchase of Gamestop shares,\u201d Robinhood spokesperson Anupriya Ghate said in a statement to CNN. \u201cGME is seeing elevated volatility and movement, which triggers market-wide exchange trading limits and halts. These are market-wide and not specific to Robinhood.\u201d Who is Roaring Kitty? Gill, who goes by \u201cDeepf\u2014-ingvalue\u201d on Reddit, was one of the leading forces on the WallStreetBets subreddit that drove eye-popping returns in GameStop\u2019s stock. The traders bid up shares of the retailer, targeting short sellers. The retail investors sent other stocks soaring in 2021, including AMC Entertainment and Bed Bath & Beyond. They are now collectively known as meme stocks, or shares of companies with a cult following that see wide swings based on their popularity among trader communities on social media rather than their fundamentals. Gill described himself as a casual daytime trader in testimony during a 2021 Congressional hearing on the GameStop mania. He has said he did not set out to help stoke the GameStop frenzy and instead believed that the stock was an attractive opportunity for investors. \u201cThe idea that I used social media to promote GameStop stock to unwitting investors is preposterous,\u201d Gill said in written testimony.\u00a0\u201cI was abundantly clear that my channel was for educational purposes only. \u2026 Whether other individual investors bought the stock was irrelevant to my thesis.\u201d Gill also said that he first purchased GameStop stock, and later call options, in the summer of 2019, when the stock was trading around $5 apiece. He added to his position through the rest of the year and 2020, and testified that he believed \u201cthe market remains oblivious to GameStop\u2019s unique opportunity.\u201d But even he didn\u2019t believe it would hit a high of $483 a share in 2021. \u201cAt the time I thought it was possible but a very low probability,\u201d Gill testified. Gill was a main character in the 2023 movie \u201cDumb Money\u201d (played by actor Paul Dano), which portrays the events leading up to and during the GameStop short squeeze.

The suspect, identified by the Euclid Police Department as 24-year-old Deshawn Anthony Vaughn, was found dead inside a residence in Shaker Heights, Ohio, US Marshals spokesperson Peter J. Elliott said during a Sunday evening news conference. Shaker Heights is about 9 miles south of the city of Euclid, where the officer was killed. \u201cThe manhunt is now over,\u201d Elliott said. The suspect, who was considered \u201chighly armed,\u201d had fled on foot to Shaker Heights after the ambush on Saturday, authorities said. Officials did not confirm the manner of Vaughn\u2019s death during Sunday\u2019s news conference. Euclid police officer Jacob Derbin, 23, was shot Saturday as officers responded to a disturbance call at a home shortly before 10 p.m. in Euclid \u2013 about 12 miles north of Cleveland \u2013 the Euclid Police Department said in a news release. \u201cThe complainant stated that her child\u2019s father threatened to harm her and her mother,\u201d Euclid Police Chief Scott Meyer said during Sunday\u2019s news conference. The woman told responding officers the suspect was on foot and possibly nearby, according to Meyer. \u201cOfficers went to check the backyard and were ambushed by gunfire from the suspect,\u201d Meyer said. Derbin was shot and taken to the hospital but died of his injuries, authorities said. No other officers were injured. \u201cHis kind heart and enormous smile were infectious,\u201d Meyer said of Derbin, speaking with emotion. \u201cThe world was a better place with him in it and he will be desperately missed by all who knew him.\u201d Derbin, who was engaged and set to be married in July, was sworn into the department in last July. His father is also a Euclid police officer, according to Meyer. Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine ordered flags to be flown at half-staff to honor Derbin\u2019s life and service on Sunday. The United States and State of Ohio flags will remain in that position until sunset on the day of Derbin\u2019s funeral, according to an announcement from DeWine. \u201cThe Euclid Police Department asks that you keep the fallen officer, his family, loved ones and our agency in your thoughts and prayers,\u201d police said in a statement.

{"id": "2024_05_11_us_columbia-commencement-protests-1968-reaj", "text": "Columbia University\u2019s graduating class of 1968 was no stranger to protests. The college years of its student body were marked by\u00a0the anti-Vietnam War movement and the fight for civil rights. In the spring of that year, a series of events \u2013 including the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. \u2013 inflamed long-simmering tensions between students and school administrators and in April, the campus erupted as students\u00a0occupied buildings during a \u201cstrike\u201d\u00a0that lasted more than a week. In the fallout of the strikes, then-university president Grayson Kirk moved the 1968 commencement ceremony from its traditional location on campus to the Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine, a few blocks away. It is spring once more, 56 years later, and Columbia finds itself at a similar crossroads now that the administration canceled the class of 2024\u2019s university-wide graduation ceremony in response to student protests over Israel\u2019s against Hamas in Gaza. Where Columbia goes from here could depend on whether it hears the echoes of past protests. When movements collide Columbia University\u2019s library details the events that led to 1968\u2019s controversial commencement in an online exhibit called \u201c1968: Columbia in Crisis.\u201d In the months leading up to graduation, protests roiled the university\u2019s campus as students from various groups led demonstrations against what they perceived to be the administration\u2019s racist policies and pro-war stance. In April 1967, a dispute at a US Marine Corps recruitment event sparked an \u201chour-long melee of fist fights and name-calling,\u201d according to the Columbia Spectator. The brawl led\u00a0Kirk to ban all demonstrations and protests within campus buildings. Students who violated the ban faced \u201cdisciplinary action and possibly dismissal,\u201d according to the Spectator, but it didn\u2019t stem the growing tide of disillusionment and frustration among Columbia\u2019s student body. Throughout 1968, students and members of the surrounding Harlem community protested the university\u2019s plans to build a gym in nearby Morningside Park, decrying the racism they saw in the separate and unequal access to the facilities, according to the university archive. Students and faculty also continued to oppose the university\u2019s involvement with the military, including Kirk\u2019s seat on the board of the Institute for Defense Analyses, a coalition of universities and government agencies conducting military research that\u2019s\u00a0still in operation today. Then on April 4, 1968, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated. As the nation reeled from Dr. King\u2019s murder, the university held a memorial in his honor. During the service, the chairman of Students for a Democratic Society, a progressive student group,\u00a0 accused administrators of upholding \u201ca policy of racism\u201d and committing a \u201cmoral outrage against Dr. King\u2019s memory,\u201d according to the Spectator. He then led dozens of students in a walk out, the Spectator reported. Campus implodes as students strike In the weeks after Dr. King\u2019s assassination, students from various on-campus groups united around the opposition to the Morningside gym. On April 23, organizers held a \u201cSun Dial Rally\u201d that featured a demonstration and march to the gymnasium site.\u00a0Students then staged a sit-in at Hamilton Hall \u2013 the same university building protesters occupied this year \u2013 and made their demands known. They included ending construction of the gym and demanding President Kirk sever ties with the Institute for Defense Analyses. Word of the demonstration spread like wildfire through Columbia\u2019s student body and students began to occupy other buildings across campus. The occupation would last for more than a week, as administrators tried in vain to negotiate with the student groups to find a resolution. Then, in the early hours of April 30, 1968, the administration sent the New York City Police Department to remove students from the buildings on campus. More than 700 students were arrested and nearly 150 were injured as police cleared the campus, according to the university\u2019s archive. The arrests only enflamed tensions between students and the Columbia administration. The strike continued through the remainder of the semester as students called for the resignation of President Kirk and the university\u2019s provost. Commencement becomes chaotic Columbia\u2019s class of 1968 graduated on June 4 and in a departure from tradition \u2013 and perhaps in acknowledgement of the tensions between students and his administration \u2013 Kirk did not deliver the commencement address. Instead, Richard Hofstadter, a history professor, spoke at a ceremony a few blocks from campus. As Hofstadter began to speak, about 300 members of the graduating class silently walked out. They marched to the university\u2019s Low Plaza, where nearly 2,000 people participated in a counter-commencement, according to the university archive. Those who remained to hear Hofstadter\u2019s speech that day were presented with a question: What kind of university do we want to be? \u201cHere at Columbia, we have suffered a disaster whose precise dimensions it is impossible to state, because the story is not yet finished, and the measure of our loss still depends upon what we do,\u201d Hofstadter said. \u201cHow can Columbia go on after this terrible wound? I can only answer: How can it not go on? The question is not whether it will continue but in what form,\u201d he said. Although it took Columbia University years to recover and reestablish trust between the administration and the student body, several key changes emerged after the 1968 protests. In March the following year, after working with Black student-leaders, Kirk agreed to suspend construction on the Morningside Gymnasium, according to the university\u2019s archive. Students and faculty also overwhelmingly approved the creation of a University Senate that spring. The senate, according to the university\u2019s archives, was composed of faculty, students and administrators and is an outlet to address \u201call matters of University-wide concern.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/11/us/columbia-commencement-protests-1968-reaj/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/13/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_05_13_us_baltimore-bridge-collapse-demolition-monday", "text": "The planned demolition of a key portion of the collapsed Francis Scott Key Bridge is set to begin Monday after inclement weather, including lightning, forced the operation to be postponed over the weekend. The demolition, which includes using small explosives to break apart a massive chunk of the\u00a0Baltimore bridge\u00a0that collapsed on a cargo ship nearly seven weeks ago, was originally set for Saturday, but bad weather forced officials to push the operation to Sunday before it was eventually rescheduled for 5 p.m. Monday, the Coast Guard said. The planned demolition will help officials remove debris and ultimately free the 213-million-pound Dali cargo ship, which veered off course March 26 and struck a pillar of the Francis Scott Key Bridge, causing it to fall into the Patapsco River below. The collapse killed\u00a0six construction workers\u00a0and destroyed a key thoroughfare, threatening the economy at the Port of Baltimore. It also sparked multiple investigations into what went wrong and who is responsible. Monday\u2019s planned demolition comes days ahead of a Wednesday hearing scheduled by the\u00a0House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, with\u00a0testimony expected\u00a0from the chair of the National Transportation Safety Board and officials from the Coast Guard, Army Corps of Engineers and the US Department of Transportation. \u201cWe will absolutely not sacrifice safety for speed,\u201d the Coast Guard\u2019s Nick Ameen said Sunday of the weather delay. \u201cWhenever there\u2019s a lightning strike in the area, that pushes the clock back, and so that clock just kept getting pushed back and pushed back.\u201d Officials began moving forward with the demolition process after the body of the sixth and final victim was recovered from the water last week. The 21 members of the ship\u2019s crew \u2013 who have not left the ship since it struck the bridge \u2013 will remain onboard during the operation, according to Darrel Wilson, a spokesperson for Synergy Marine Group, which manages the Dali. If the operation succeeds, the ship could be refloated and returned to the Port of Baltimore as soon as this week,\u00a0The Baltimore Sun\u00a0and CNN affiliate\u00a0WBAL\u00a0previously reported. Demolition will sound like fireworks \u201cThe safest and swiftest method to remove the bridge piece from on top of the M/V Dali is by precision cuts made with small charges,\u201d the Key Bridge Response Unified Command said in\u00a0a news release last week. \u201cThis is an industry-standard tool in controlled demolition that will break the span into smaller pieces,\u201d it added, \u201cwhich will allow the work of refloating the vessel and removing it from the federal channel.\u201d The demolition process will \u201clook like multiple puffs of smoke and sound like fireworks,\u201d according to an infographic from the US Army and the US Army Corps of Engineers. Nearby communities should receive a \u201ccellular notification\u201d beforehand, according to\u00a0Unified Command, which includes\u00a0state and federal authorities, the US Coast Guard and Army Corps of Engineers among them. Ship\u2019s crew have not left since collision While engineers tackle the logistics of clearing a tangled mess of metal to free the Dali, members of Baltimore\u2019s seafaring community remain concerned for the crew\u2019s well-being given the length of time they\u2019ve been aboard the ship. \u201cThey will have a safe place on the vessel where they can shelter during the controlled explosion,\u201d Wilson, with Synergy Marine Group, said, adding the crew was \u201cholding up well\u201d despite the stress of recent weeks. \u201cEven though they are not sailing, they are still performing\u00a0their normal crew duties,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cThis is still a large, complicated piece of equipment and there is a lot they have to look after.\u201d The Singapore Maritime Officers\u2019 Union and the Singapore Organization of Seamen issued a joint statement over the weekend saying they are concerned about \u201cthe potential criminalization\u201d of seafarers aboard the ship as the investigation unfolds. The crew is well taken care of but feels disconnected from the rest of the world, Rev. Josh Messick, executive director of the Baltimore International Seafarers\u2019 Center, told CNN. They have internet access, thanks to hotspots Messick\u2019s group helped deliver, but they do not have their cell phones. CNN previously\u00a0reported\u00a0the FBI confiscated the crew\u2019s cellphones as part of the investigation, a move the unions say have kept them disconnected from their families and unable to access critical resources. \u201cThey are a little anxious because of the phone situation. We are trying to get their cell phones back to them,\u201d Messick said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just a phone, they can\u2019t access their online banking, their finances, their contacts, they can\u2019t look at photos of their loved ones before they go to sleep at night. It\u2019s a lot more than just a phone.\u201d According to the unions, their representatives were aboard the Dali in April to ensure the crew\u2019s well-being. They are requesting the crew\u2019s visas be extended or renewed to allow for shore leave. The unions are also requesting expedited repatriation for crew members not required for further investigation and the return of their electronics. \u201cHowever long the investigation takes, the crew\u2019s rights and welfare should not be infringed upon during its course,\u201d said Dave Heindel, president of the Seafarers International Union.

The resulting smoke could last for the next two days \u2014 leading to poor air quality and reduced visibility in US states such as Minnesota. Here\u2019s what else you need to know to Get Up to Speed and on With Your Day. 1. Trump Trial Donald Trump\u2019s former lawyer is expected to take the stand today as a key witness in the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s case against the former president. Michael Cohen will testify about his role in negotiating the $130,000 hush money payment to adult film actress Stormy Daniels before the 2016 election, as well as how he was reimbursed through retainer payments in 2017. Those allegations are at the heart of the charges against Trump. With Cohen\u2019s testimony, however, comes all of the baggage that accompanies the former president\u2019s longtime fixer. Cohen himself was federally charged with campaign finance violations, tax crimes and lying to Congress in previous testimony. He\u2019s changed his story as he turned from loyal Trump defender to chief antagonist after pleading guilty to federal charges in 2018. 2. Gaza Top US officials offered stark warnings Sunday against an Israeli invasion of Rafah, predicting that a major ground offensive in the southern Gaza city would lead to widespread civilian casualties, spark a Hamas insurgency and create a power vacuum the terror group would later seek to fill. The alarm bells from Secretary of State Antony Blinken and White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan came after President Joe Biden delivered an ultimatum last week that an Israeli invasion of Rafah would cause him to pause certain weapons transfers. Blinken and Sullivan both said Biden made the determination because he didn\u2019t want American weapons used in what he estimated would be a bloody, ill-advised operation. At least 360,000 people have fled Rafah ahead of Israel\u2019s planned invasion, the UN says. 3. Ukraine The situation in the northern Kharkiv region of Ukraine has \u201csignificantly worsened,\u201d according to Ukraine\u2019s top general, after Russia claimed to have captured additional villages \u2014 expanding its surprise cross-border offensive. The precise goal of Russia\u2019s new push, which began late last week,\u00a0is unclear. It may be to create a buffer zone designed to reduce Ukrainian attacks on Russian territory, or possibly even a renewed assault on the city of Kharkiv, less than 20 miles to the south. According to information from the Defense Ministry in Moscow, Russia now claims control over nine Ukrainian border villages northeast of Kharkiv. 4. Severe weather Flash flooding could strike across the US South this week as yet another round of severe storms drench already saturated ground \u2014 including parts of Texas, where hundreds of people were rescued during torrential downpours last week. More than 13 million people are under flood watches today into Tuesday in an expanse stretching from Central Texas to the Florida Panhandle, including rain-weary areas just north of Houston. The South has been battered by several rounds of rain in recent days, including severe storms that moved through Texas and into Louisiana on Sunday, bringing some tennis ball-sized hail and prompting the National Weather Service to issue tornado watches and flash flood warnings. 5. Bob Menendez Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez of New Jersey faces his second, distinct bribery and corruption trial in seven years \u2014 with jury selection expected to start today. The trial involves gold bars, envelopes of cash, a Mercedes and more that, prosecutors say, Menendez received in exchange for granting favors for people from Egypt and Qatar and trying to influence a New Jersey prosecution. Menendez, the former chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, will be tried alongside two New Jersey businessmen who are co-defendants. His wife, Nadine, also has been charged but will be tried separately. All four have pleaded not guilty.

{"id": "2024_05_13_economy_mortgage-company-risk-regulation-fsoc", "text": "US officials worry the next recession could be intensified by a cascading series of failures in the mortgage industry caused by crashing home prices, frozen financial markets and soaring delinquencies. The US Financial Stability Oversight Council, a SWAT team of financial regulators formed after the 2008 crisis, sounded the alarm on Friday about an increasingly influential corner of the industry that has largely escaped scrutiny: nonbank mortgage companies. Unlike traditional banks, nonbank mortgage companies like Rocket Mortgage are heavily exposed to swings in the mortgage market, depend on funding that can dry up during times of stress and don\u2019t have stable deposits to rely on as a safety net. And, unlike banks, these companies are lightly regulated at the national level. FSOC warned that these unique vulnerabilities risk a domino effect in a future crisis where multiple mortgage companies fail, borrowers are locked out of the mortgage market and the federal government is left holding the bag. \u201cPut simply, the vulnerabilities of nonbank mortgage companies can amplify shocks in the mortgage market and undermine financial stability,\u201d Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, who chairs FSOC, said in the report. Federal regulators are calling for states and Congress to take action to address the risks posed here, including creating an industry-funded backstop to ease turmoil caused when a mortgage company goes under. Despite the wonky term, nonbank mortgage companies have become vital players that make most home mortgages in the United States today. They include major brands such as Rocket Mortgage, PennyMac and Mr. Cooper. As of 2022, nonbank mortgage companies originated about two-thirds of US mortgages and owned the servicing rights on 54% of mortgage balances, according to FSOC. That\u2019s up significantly from 2008. In fact, nonbank mortgage servicers hold the servicing rights on nearly $6.3 trillion in unpaid balances on agency-backed mortgages \u2014 representing 70% of the total. Nonbank mortgage companies have \u201cvulnerabilities\u201d that could cause them to \u201camplify and transmit the effect of a shock to the mortgage market and broader financial system,\u201d FSOC said. For example, if home prices crash in a future crisis, mortgage companies could simultaneously lose money and face cash crunches that would make it hard for them to make required payments to investors on behalf of struggling borrowers, FSOC said. These challenges would be exacerbated by the relatively high amounts of debt these companies have. This pressure on nonbank mortgage companies would then hurt borrowers seeking mortgages and could force the federal government to assume the obligations, according to regulators. Plea for action Yellen and her colleagues on Friday called for state regulators to enhance requirements and standards on nonbank mortgage companies, including requiring them to map out how they could be safely wound down in a crisis. To address liquidity pressure during a time of stress, regulators called for Congress to consider legislation to provide new authorities to Ginnie Mae to expand an assistance backdrop program. Additionally, regulators said Congress should consider establishing a fund \u2014 financed by nonbank mortgage companies \u2014 to \u201cprovide liquidity to nonbank mortgage servicers that are in bankruptcy or have reached the point of failure.\u201d In response, the Mortgage Bankers Association, an industry trade group, said it supports FSOC\u2019s goals of a \u201csafe, stable and sustainable financial services marketplace\u201d but described some of the recommendations as \u201cunnecessary.\u201d \u201cYears of punitive regulatory capital treatment have already limited the willingness and ability of depository institutions to participate in the mortgage lending and servicing markets,\u201d Bob Broeksmit, president and CEO of the MBA, said in a statement on Friday. \u201cWhile we support national standards for capital and liquidity requirements, layering duplicative supervision requirements or supervisory entities onto a heavily regulated market will add significant cost and complexity.\u201d The ABA warned that managing these changes could reduce competition and raise borrowing costs. Scott Olsen, executive director of Community Home Lenders of America, another trade group, said the FSOC report does not indicate significant taxpayer risk and only limited risk to the financial system as a whole. \u201cGiven the current homeownership affordability challenges, CHLA hopes regulators do not overreact to this limited risk with regulations and fees that restrict mortgage access to credit,\u201d Olsen said in a statement. Even some regulators have concerns about the new FSOC plan. Brandon Milhorn, president and CEO of the Conference of State Bank Supervisors, cautioned in a statement on Friday that the recommendation to establish a new liquidity fund is \u201cpremature at best.\u201d \u201cBefore considering any such proposal, Congress should require substantially more research and analysis regarding the potentially dramatic, unintended consequences of this recommendation,\u201d Milhorn said. \u201cI am concerned that this recommendation could negatively impact the nonbank mortgage market, particularly for low- and moderate-income borrowers, communities of color, first-time homebuyers, and veterans.\u201d However, Patricia McCoy, a professor at Boston College Law School, cautioned that nonbank mortgage companies\u2019 reliance on short-term loans for financing \u201cmakes them vulnerable to collapse\u201d if borrowing rates spike or lending dries up. \u201cNonbank mortgage firms are thinly capitalized, which makes them vulnerable to failure if they lose financing or mortgage defaults spike,\u201d said McCoy, a former mortgage regulator. \u201cStarting in early 2007, we saw a tsunami of nonbank mortgage firms fail precisely for these reasons.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/13/economy/mortgage-company-risk-regulation-fsoc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/13/2024", "section": "us"}}

{"id": "2024_05_13_politics_bob-menendez-what-to-know-trial", "text": "A sitting US senator faces a weekslong trial over charges of taking bribes including gold bars, cash and a luxury car to, among other things, help push US aid and weapons to a foreign government and stop a federal case against one of his co-defendants. Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez of New Jersey, who faces 16 charges including conspiracy to commit bribery and conspiracy to obstruct justice, has rejected calls to resign and, while he won\u2019t run in the state\u2019s primary for his seat, has left open the possibility for an independent run following his trial. The senator told CNN\u2019s Manu Raju on Capitol Hill last week, \u201cI am\u00a0looking forward to proving my innocence,\u201d when asked repeatedly whether he would resign in the face of a potential conviction. Prosecutors say Menendez and his wife, Nadine, helped several New Jersey businessmen \u2013 all of whom were charged in the conspiracy \u2013 obtain lucrative contracts with Egyptian and Qatari officials and attempted to pressure authorities to stop investigations into the businessmen and their associates. Jury selection in the case began Monday. The jury will be chosen from more than 100 potential jurors in federal court in New York City. The presiding judge has not yet ruled on proposed jury questionnaires. Defense attorneys have suggested asking the jury pool a myriad of questions, including whether they think someone from New Jersey is \u201cmore likely to break the law.\u201d Menendez will be tried with two of his co-defendants, Wael Hana, an Egyptian American businessman, and Fred Daibes, a New Jersey real estate developer. His wife faces trial in July. Here\u2019s what to know: Foreign entanglements According to the indictment, Hana and Nadine Menendez \u2013 who were friends for years before she started dating the senator in 2018 \u2013 worked together to connect the senator with several Egyptian officials to help secure US military aid as well as an exclusive contract with Hana\u2019s company. The contract, prosecutors say, made Hana\u2019s company the only business able to certify US food exports to Egypt as compliant with halal standards. Menendez, who at the time held senior positions on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, a post with power over foreign military sales, met several times with Hana\u2019s contacts in the Egyptian military and helped steer US military sales and aid to the country, according to prosecutors. The indictment also alleges Menendez ghostwrote a letter on behalf of the Egyptian government attempting to persuade other senators to lift a hold on $300 million in aid. In addition to his alleged agreement to use his position to facilitate military sales and financing to Egypt, Menendez also passed along sensitive information to his wife about who was serving at the US Embassy in Cairo, prosecutors say. His wife, in turn, sent the information to Hana, who forwarded it to an Egyptian government official. The senator also allegedly pressured an official at the Department of Agriculture to protect the halal certification monopoly Hana had secured with Egypt for his company, through which his wife was allegedly being paid for Menendez\u2019s efforts. Menendez\u2019s entanglements with foreign governments extended to Qatari officials, prosecutors say. In exchange for gold bars, whose price Menendez searched online several times, and other items, Menendez helped his co-defendant Daibes secure a multimillion-dollar investment from Qatari officials in a real estate project, according to prosecutors. New Jersey investigations Using his power as senator, prosecutors say Menendez attempted to influence several cases in New Jersey involving his co-defendants, including by talking with a top prosecutor on one case and by working to recommend a candidate for the job of New Jersey\u2019s US attorney, who Menendez believed would help quash a case against Daibes. For Menendez\u2019s efforts in pressuring an official in one case, New Jersey businessman Jose Uribe and Hana bought Nadine a luxury car, prosecutors say. In May, Uribe pleaded guilty to seven counts related to the bribery scheme involving Menendez and his co-defendants and agreed to cooperate with federal prosecutors in the case, including by testifying at the trial. Ultimately, according to the indictment, Menendez\u2019s influence campaigns were unsuccessful. The New Jersey case against Daibes is ongoing. Alleged cover-up According to prosecutors, after search warrants were executed on the Menendezes\u2019 home \u2013 where gold bars and hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash were found \u2013 and elsewhere, the senator and his wife attempted to cover up the bribes by paying back the businessmen for the mortgage and luxury car, claiming they were merely loans. The indictment states that lawyers for the two told prosecutors \u2013 relying on statements from the married couple \u2013 that the bribe payments were actually loans. Menendez allegedly had his attorney at the time say he was originally unaware of the mortgage and car payments, which prosecutors say is false. The couple has been charged with obstructing justice. Menendez\u2019s defense Attorneys for Menendez have hinted at several possible defenses they may bring during trial, including that the 13 gold bars and $480,000 in cash investigators found in his home could be explained by intergenerational family trauma as well as a psychological disorder stemming in part from his father\u2019s suicide. Shortly after he was indicted on bribery charges last year, Menendez told reporters he had withdrawn thousands of dollars in cash over the course of 30 years, citing \u201cthe history of my family facing confiscation in Cuba.\u201d The family trauma and death of his father, defense attorneys say, led to a fear of scarcity through which Menendez developed \u201cseemingly unusual\u201d coping mechanisms. Menendez may also attempt to lay the blame for the alleged conspiracy on his wife, Nadine, whose trial was delayed due to a medical issue. \u201cSenator Menendez intends to present a defense arguing (in part) that he lacked the requisite knowledge of much of the conduct and statements of his wife, Nadine, and thus lacks scienter and did not agree to join any of the charged conspiracies,\u201d attorneys for Menendez wrote in a court filing.

{"id": "2024_05_12_us_wildfire-smoke-from-british-columbia-causing-dangerous-air-quality", "text": "An out-of-control fire exhibiting \u201cextreme fire behavior\u201d is threatening to overrun a small Canadian community as the country\u2019s wildfire season explodes to early life for the second consecutive year. The Parker Lake Fire in northeastern British Columbia more than tripled in size over the weekend to 13,000 acres and is now on the doorstep of the small community of Fort Nelson. Gusty winds are expected to push the fire toward the community through the day Monday. \u201cOur current fire behavior projections show the community of Fort Nelson may be impacted during the morning of May 13,\u201d Ben Boghean, Fire Behavior Specialist for the BC Wildfire Service, said in a Sunday Facebook update. It\u2019s unclear how far the fire has advanced since the update. Some 3,200 residents in northeastern British Columbia were under an evacuation order Saturday afternoon as the Parker Lake fire raged on. About 2,800 residents from the Northern Rockies Regional Municipality and about 450 residents from the Fort Nelson First Nation were asked to evacuate. \u201cIf you are still in Fort Nelson, or anywhere in the evacuation order of the Parker Lake wildfire, I encourage you to leave,\u201d Cliff Chapman, BC Wildfire service director of provincial operations, said in the Sunday update. \u201cThe fuels are as dry as we have ever seen. The wind is going to be sustained and it is going to push the fire toward the community. Escape routes may be compromised and visibility will be poor as the fire continues to grow.\u201d Jaylene MacIver, Northern Rockies regional municipality information officer, told CNN \u201cthere has generally been good compliance,\u201d though some residents chose to remain in place. More than 90% of the approximately 450 residents of Fort Nelson First Nation evacuated the area, the emergency operations director Terry Cavaliere told CNN. Extremely dry conditions and winds gusting up to 25 mph are driving the fire Monday, but the seeds of fire activity were sown over the winter and in past years as the world continues to warm because of human-driven climate change. \u201cThis region has experienced multiple years of drought, with a below normal snowpack this past winter,\u201d Boghean said. \u201cAs a result of this, our forests in the Fort Nelson zone are very receptive\u00a0to new fire ignitions and rapid rates of spread.\u201d Declining snow, increasing temperatures and worsening droughts are all hallmarks of climate change and are projected to keep driving larger and more intense fires across Canada, according to Environment Canada. Last year was Canada\u2019s most devastating fire season on record, including in British Columbia, where fires burned through hundreds of homes and an area the size of Maryland, according to the BC Wildfire Service. The Parker Lake Fire is not alone. There are more than 100 fires burning across Canada, 39 of which are considered out of control, according to the Canadian Interagency Fire Centre. Evacuation alerts are also in place for parts of Alberta as the MWF-017 wildfire burns out of control near Fort McMurray in the northeastern area of the province, officials said. The fire had burned about 16,000 acres as of Sunday morning. Hazardous smoke creeps into the US Smoke from the infernos has caused Environment Canada\u00a0to issue a special air quality statement extending from British Columbia to Saskatchewan. It has also caused smoke to waft down into the northern tier of the US for the first time this year, and for air quality alerts to be issued for Wisconsin, Minnesota and Iowa. Air quality reached \u201cunhealthy\u201d levels in all three states Monday, including Minneapolis-St. Paul, according to AirNow.gov. On Monday afternoon, the Twin Cities had the eighth-worst air quality of 119 major cities tracked by IQAIR, a company tracking air quality worldwide. Particulate matter levels this high can cause issues for sensitive groups or anyone spending prolonged time outdoors, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. Wildfire smoke has been linked to increases in certain cancers and heart-related issues, among other ailments. Just last year, smoke from Canadian\u00a0wildfires made its way to parts of the United States and caused dangerous air conditions across the country. In 2023, 19 counties in 11 states had days with \u201cvery unhealthy\u201d and \u201chazardous\u201d air quality \u2014 given at least a \u201ccode purple\u201d alert on the US Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s Air Quality Index. Poor air quality conditions are expected to linger in the US through Monday, and likely longer in parts of Canada closer to the fires, including Alberta and British Columbia.  Canadian officials warned those at higher risk of experiencing health effects from\u00a0wildfire\u00a0smoke include people with lung disease such as asthma, people with heart disease, along with older adults, children, those who are pregnant and people who work outdoors. They also recommended those who spend time outdoors wear a mask to help reduce exposure to fine particles of smoke. Residents in Alberta prepare to evacuate Evacuation alerts are also in effect for parts of Alberta as\u00a0wildfire\u00a0MWF-017 burns about 10 miles southwest of Fort McMurray, according to a statement from the\u00a0Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo. The alerts were active in Fort McMurray, Saprae Creek Estates, Gregoire Lake Estates, Fort McMurray First Nation #468, Anzac and Rickards Landing Industrial Park. \u201cAlthough there is no immediate risk to these communities, the alert ensures residents are prepared to evacuate if conditions change,\u201d the statement said. Light rain showers were expected overnight Sunday with more rain forecast Monday, \u201cwhich will help lower fire activity,\u201d a Sunday update from Alberta Wildfire said. \u201cThis will give firefighters a good window to continue making progress on containing the fire,\u201d it said. \u201cTwo night vision helicopters will work overnight to drop water on the fire with their buckets,\u201d the update said. Crews made progress in establishing a fireguard on the northeast side of the fire Sunday, officials said. Fire restrictions will remain in effect in the area until conditions improve, according to\u00a0Alberta\u00a0Wildfire.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/12/us/wildfire-smoke-from-british-columbia-causing-dangerous-air-quality/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/13/2024", "section": "us"}}

Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Joy Campbell is asking a judge to conclude that drivers for\u00a0Uber\u00a0and Lyft are employees under state law and therefore entitled to benefits such as a minimum wage, overtime and earned sick time. Her office claims the companies for years misclassified thousands of Massachusetts drivers and cannot meet a three-part test under the state\u2019s worker-friendly laws that would allow them to be deemed independent contractors. Studies have shown that using contractors can cost companies\u00a0as much as 30% less\u00a0than using employees. Uber (UBER)\u00a0and Lyft (LYFT) argue that they properly classified the drivers, saying they are not transportation companies that employ drivers but technology companies whose apps facilitate connections between drivers and potential riders. The companies warn\u00a0that, should Suffolk County Superior Court Judge Peter Krupp rule against them, they would be unable to maintain\u00a0their\u00a0flexible business model in the state and may be forced to cut or cease operations in Massachusetts. Rohit Singla, a lawyer for Lyft, during a Thursday pre-trial hearing said his client\u2019s \u201ccurrent business cannot support drivers as employees, is not set up for that and wouldn\u2019t work that way.\u201d The case is going to trial a week after Massachusetts\u2019 highest court\u00a0heard arguments\u00a0over whether to allow an industry-backed ballot measure to go before voters in November that defines the drivers as contractors but entitles them to some new benefits. The court appeared open to allowing some version of that proposal to go on the ballot along with a rival, labor-backed ballot measure that seeks to allow the drivers to unionize. The lawsuit going to trial was filed in 2020 by Campbell\u2019s predecessor, Maura Healey, now the state\u2019s Democratic governor. Should the state prevail, it has said the companies could face large penalties for not properly classifying their drivers. By not classifying their Massachusetts drivers as employees,\u00a0Uber\u00a0and Lyft avoided paying $266.4 million into workers\u2019 compensation, unemployment insurance and paid family medical leave over 10 years, according to a report by the state auditor.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/13/tech/uber-lyft-massachusetts-trial/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/13/2024", "section": "us"}}

{"id": "2024_05_13_politics_michael-cohen-donald-trump-analysis", "text": "Michael Cohen once described himself as Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cspokesman, thug, pit bull and lawless lawyer.\u201d But this week, he has a new role. He will be the star witness for prosecutors trying to prove Trump illegally falsified business records after paying off adult film actress Stormy Daniels as part of an alleged election interference scheme in 2016. Cohen\u2019s testimony is set to be the critical moment of the hush money trial that could make Trump the first ex-president to be convicted of a crime. His appearance will mark the zenith of a bitter personal feud between two brash New Yorkers obsessed with betrayal and revenge. And it marks one of the most lurid twists yet in the presumptive Republican nominee\u2019s legal morass that is entwined with the 2024 election. Trump\u2019s former fixer wrote in his autobiography that he craved reflected influence and notoriety from Trump, so he adopted the real estate magnate\u2019s methods \u2014 including bullying, lying and mocking the rule of law \u2014 to serve him. He once vowed to take a bullet for his boss. But his testimony will be his latest attempt to atone for this Faustian pact after he paid the price, including with a spell in prison, for his years as a kingpin in Trump\u2019s orbit. In many ways, Cohen is the mirror image of Trump \u2014 a colorful braggart and social media provocateur who craved power and riches and was prepared to pay any price and to intimidate anyone to get them. Cohen, who worked for the Trump Organization cleaning up the mess from the family\u2019s personal scandals and busted business deals, facilitated the $130,000 hush money payment to Daniels, he says, on the orders of his boss. Trump has denied having an affair with Daniels, whose testimony last week about their alleged liaison at Lake Tahoe in 2006 seemed excruciating for the ex-president. He has pleaded not guilty in this case and to three other criminal indictments. Cohen\u2019s value as a witness is that he was involved in every aspect of Trump\u2019s business and personal life, knew all his secrets, and was allegedly an accessory in his efforts to break the law and thwart accountability. In his book \u201cDisloyal,\u201d Cohen wrote, \u201cI know where the skeletons are buried because I was the one who buried them.\u201d Prosecutor Matthew Colangelo said in his opening statement that \u201cCohen made that payment at the defendant\u2019s direction, and he did it to influence the presidential election.\u201d After the election, Trump is accused of working out a scheme in the Oval Office to reimburse Cohen for the hush money payment in installments disguised as billing for legal services. \u201cThe defendant falsified those business records because he wanted to conceal his and others\u2019 criminal conduct,\u201d Colangelo said, adding that both Cohen and the prosecution will be up-front about mistakes Cohen has made in the past. Cohen\u2019s friend and fellow former Trump acolyte Anthony Scaramucci, who briefly served as the ex-president\u2019s White House communications director, said the former fixer will be able to prove the criminality of campaign interference. \u201cI think unfortunately for Donald Trump, Michael Cohen has the receipts for everything that went on,\u201d he told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper  on Friday. \u201cThey\u2019re smoking gun receipts, and he\u2019s going to provide very compelling, very honest, very direct testimony.\u201d How Trump\u2019s legal team will seek to discredit Cohen But like Trump, Cohen has a long history of trashing the truth, and since turning on his onetime mentor, he has sought to monetize his campaign against him with books \u2013 including one called \u201cRevenge\u201d \u2013 podcasts and television appearances. He is, therefore, vulnerable to a savage cross-examination by Trump\u2019s attorneys, who will lambast him as an unreliable witness on a quest for payback as they seek to sow reasonable doubt over Trump\u2019s culpability in the mind of at least one juror. Trump\u2019s attorneys will argue that his payments to Cohen were a legal retainer and that paying someone to stop what they say are unfounded rumors about the ex-president is not illegal. In his opening statement, Trump lawyer Todd Blanche suggested Cohen sought revenge because he was not given a job in the new president\u2019s administration in 2017. He also accused Cohen of an unhealthy obsession with Trump. \u201cHe criticizes President Trump. He has talked extensively about his desire to see President Trump go to prison. He has talked extensively about his desire to see President Trump\u2019s family go to prison. He has talked extensively about President Trump getting convicted in this case,\u201d Blanche said. Trump\u2019s former fixer was sent to prison after pleading guilty to lying to Congress about a possible Trump business project in Russia, for orchestrating illegal campaign contributions in the form of hush money payments and on various tax evasion charges. How prosecutors built a foundation under Cohen\u2019s testimony This issue of credibility is why prosecutors have spent days building a foundation for Cohen\u2019s testimony, taking jurors through inner workings of the Trump Organization including with bank records, text messages and evidence from the firm\u2019s former employees as they seek to prove 34 counts that allege Trump falsified financial records to hide the hush money payments. The testimony from Daniels was designed to illustrate the incident Trump allegedly tried to keep from voters in his successful White House campaign eight years ago. Former Nixon White House counsel John Dean said on \u201cCNN Newsroom\u201d on Saturday that the government case against Trump was \u201cvery powerful\u201d and that \u201cthey have built such a structure that Michael Cohen can come in and testify and he is largely corroborated already.\u201d Cohen has tried to counter defense claims that he has ulterior motives for seeking vengeance against Trump by styling his decision to flip on the former president as a quest for redemption and an attempt to warn the public about the danger Trump poses if he is elected in November. At a dramatic congressional hearing in 2019, Cohen painted a stunning portrait of the mob-like world in which his former boss did business and said that \u201cmy loyalty to Mr. Trump has cost me everything.\u201d He testified that everything he did \u2014 from organizing the suppression of tabloid news stories unflattering to Trump, to bullying business rivals and closing deals \u2014 was in the service of one thing: \u201cEverybody\u2019s job at the Trump Organization is to protect Mr. Trump,\u201d he said, adding that he had been directed by his boss to threaten people more than 500 times. \u201cI am ashamed because I know what Mr. Trump is. He is a racist. He is a conman. He is a cheat,\u201d Cohen said. The Trump worshipper-turned-enemy was a small-time lawyer and businessman who made his fortune in New York taxi medallions before he came to the future president\u2019s attention when he was looking for an enforcer along the lines of the late and notorious New York lawyer Roy Cohn. Trump, who will sit just feet away from his former henchman in the courtroom this week, has been equally unflattering about Cohen. He\u2019s spent months lacerating his former lawyer\u2019s character on social media. And Cohen\u2019s appearance on the witness stand will likely prove one of the biggest tests of Trump\u2019s capacity to avoid infringing the gag order protecting key witnesses and court staff that he has already been fined $10,000 for violating 10 times. Last week, Judge Juan Merchan directly warned Trump that future violations could force him to impose jail time. It will not be the first time the two former partners meet in court. Cohen was a key witness in Trump\u2019s civil fraud trial in New York last fall that resulted in a near half-billion-dollar judgment against the ex-president, his adult sons and the Trump Organization. In what Cohen described as a \u201check of a reunion,\u201d he testified that he manipulated Trump\u2019s financial statements to \u201creverse-engineer\u201d them to hit an arbitrary net wealth figure in a key moment in the prosecution case. He also sparred heatedly with Trump\u2019s lawyers, who tried to discredit him in cross-examination in a way that underscores the risk prosecutors will take putting him on the stand in the hush money trial \u2014 which, unlike the civil fraud case, is being heard by a jury. It is becoming clearer that this trial \u2014 seen by legal experts as the weakest criminal threat facing the former president \u2014 may be the only one to go to a jury before November\u2019s election. The three other cases are all effectively on hold. The Supreme Court is deliberating the former president\u2019s sweeping immunity claims arising from his federal election interference indictment, and a Trump-appointed judge in Florida has postponed his classified documents trial after dragging her feet on adjudicating pretrial motions and disputes. The election interference case in Florida has become mired in a controversy over whether Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis should be disqualified from the case. While the hush money trial harks back to the 2016 election, its end game could play a significant role in the destiny of the White House eight years later. There is no clear sign yet that proceedings have had any impact on Trump\u2019s standing in the race after he brandished his indictments to bolster his claims that he\u2019s the victim of election interference himself. This helped him crush the GOP primary field, and some polls suggest that some Republicans could think twice about voting for him in a neck-and-neck race with President Joe Biden if he\u2019s a convicted felon. But the ex-president would be sure to use any acquittal to argue that all of the cases against him are equally meritless. Cohen\u2019s testimony, therefore, may have consequences far beyond the courtroom.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/13/politics/michael-cohen-donald-trump-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/13/2024", "section": "us"}}

The ads from American Bridge 21st Century mark the first wave of a larger, planned $140 million campaign by the group to persuade swing voters in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin to reject Trump\u2019s bid to return to the White House. President Joe Biden flipped all three states in 2020. The ads, which the group says will target women voters living in rural and exurban areas of the three states, represent the latest effort by Democrats to use emotional, straight-to-the-camera stories to sway election outcomes since the US Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022. American Bridge co-founder Bradley Beychok said the group has recruited hundreds of voters \u201cwilling to share their stories about why another Trump White House would be so devastating for them.\u201d Trump\u2019s nomination of three conservatives to the high court paved the way for the Dobbs decision overturning the federal right to abortion, which has emerged as one of the most contentious issues in politics. Biden\u2019s campaign has sought to make it the defining issue of the 2024 election. While Trump has said he was \u201cproudly the person responsible\u201d for the court\u2019s action, the former president has said decisions on limits to abortion should be left up to the states. He also has declined to say how he would vote on an abortion access measure on the ballot this fall in Florida, where he resides. In some cases, the American Bridge ads juxtapose Trump\u2019s words with those voters. In one, a Wisconsin woman named Anna \u2013 described as an OB-GYN and mother of two \u2013 tearfully describes having to terminate a wanted pregnancy because the baby she was carrying would not survive. \u201cThat\u2019s not a decision for any politician, including Donald Trump,\u201d she says. In another commercial, Lori \u2013 who has worked as a nurse in central Pennsylvania \u2013 frets about the impact of Dobbs on her daughter and granddaughter. \u201cWe\u2019re already moving backwards,\u201d she says. \u201cIf we reelect Trump, what are women going to lose next?\u201d American Bridge officials say the ads are aimed at four kinds of voters: moderates, those who swing between Democrats and Republicans, conservatives who dislike the hard-right rhetoric espoused by some Republicans, and a group they call \u201cdouble doubters,\u201d which they define as voters who aren\u2019t excited about either Trump or Biden. In all, the group has a $200 million budget for its anti-Trump efforts in the 2024 election, including its previously announced $140 million advertising campaign.

{"id": "2024_05_13_business_shein-75-hour-weeks-investigation", "text": "More than a year after Shein promised to tackle excessive working hours in its supply chain, a new report suggests the Chinese fast-fashion company still has a problem. Workers in some factories supplying Shein are still working 75-hour weeks,\u00a0according to an investigation by Public Eye, a Swiss human rights advocacy group that first highlighted the alleged abuse back in 2021. \u201cThe 75-hour weeks that we found out about two years ago still seem to be common at Shein,\u201d the Swiss organization said. Public Eye interviewed 13 textile workers employed at six factories in Guangzhou, a region in southern China, last summer. It found that staff worked an average of 12 hours a day, excluding lunch and dinner breaks, and usually for six or seven days a week. Shein does not reveal the identity of its suppliers, Public Eye said in its report. The group said it established that the factories were Shein suppliers through interviewees\u2019 responses as well as the presence of Shein products. Public Eye also claimed that workers\u2019 wages had hardly changed since its 2021 report. They fluctuated between 6,000 and 10,000 yuan per month ($829 and $1,382). However, after deducting pay for overtime, wages fell to about 2,400 ($332) a month. That\u2019s\u00a0well below the 6,512 yuan ($900) Public Eye says is a living wage in China, citing calculations by campaign group the Asia Floor Wage Alliance. \u201cI work every day from 8 in the morning to 10.30 at night and take one day off each month. I can\u2019t afford any more days off because it costs too much,\u201d Public Eye cited one worker as saying. Shein is\u00a0an online shopping retailer\u00a0founded in 2008 that sells its cut-price fast fashion apparel all over the world. In a statement to CNN the company said that it does \u201cnot recognize many of the allegations in (Public Eye\u2019s) report.\u201d \u201cThe Public Eye report is based on a sample of 13 interviewees and, though all voices in our supply chain are important, this small sample size should be seen in the context of our comprehensive ongoing process to continually improve our supply chain, which involves engaging with thousands of suppliers and workers within the supply chain,\u201d it added. In December 2022, Shein\u00a0announced plans\u00a0to invest $15 million to upgrade hundreds of factories belonging to its suppliers. That announcement followed a documentary\u00a0broadcast by the UK\u2019s Channel 4 that made allegations of labor exploitation against two of Shein\u2019s suppliers in China, with factory staff allegedly working\u00a018 hours a day and making pennies per item. On Monday, it said it continued to make substantial investments to strengthen governance and compliance among its suppliers. \u201cThese efforts are already delivering results, with our regular supplier audits showing a consistent improvement in performance and compliance by our supplier partners,\u201d Shein said in its statement. A spokesperson for Shein told CNN that the company requires its suppliers to cap workers schedules at 60 hours per week, including overtime, and to give workers at least one day off a week. Staff also have the right to refuse to work overtime. Third-party audits carried out between April 2022 and June 2023 showed that workers at its suppliers earned basic salaries that were, on average, more than double the local minimum wage, and \u201cmuch higher\u201d than the living wage in Shenzhen, about 81 miles south of Guangzhou, the spokesperson added. Public Eye said it did not return to Nancun, near Guangzhou \u2014 where Shein has its headquarters \u2014 to interview workers as it had done in 2021, because an increase in media scrutiny in the area made \u201cthe atmosphere too risky.\u201d Some workers also told investigators that they had noticed an rise in the number of surveillance cameras in the factories, and believed that the recordings were sent to Shein in real time to help the firm enforce its rules. Shein\u2019s suppliers \u201cmake their own decision to install cameras in their facilities\u201d to enhance security, but that it \u201cdoes not have access to suppliers\u2019 security camera feeds or footage,\u201d the company spokesperson told CNN. Public Eye\u2019s investigators also observed young people, judged to be about 14 or 15 years old, performing simple tasks, such as packaging, in some of the factories. \u201cWe strictly do not tolerate child labor. We treat any violations with utmost severity,\u201d the spokesperson said, adding that \u201cany such violations found would result in the immediate termination of (the firm\u2019s) business relationship with the supplier.\u201d This article has been updated with additional information.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/13/business/shein-75-hour-weeks-investigation/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/13/2024", "section": "us"}}

Crews were expected Sunday evening to use small explosives to break apart a massive chunk of the Baltimore bridge that collapsed on a cargo ship six weeks ago after the US Coast Guard previously pushed back the controlled demolition by an hour. The operation was originally to take place Saturday, but officials on Friday announced it would be postponed due to an adverse weather forecast. The explosion is now slated to take place at 5 p.m. ET on Monday, according to the Coast Guard. The planned demolition is aimed at helping officials remove debris and ultimately free the 213-million-pound Dali cargo ship, which veered off course March 26 and struck a pillar of the Francis Scott Key Bridge, causing it to fall into the water below. The collapse killed six construction workers and destroyed a key thoroughfare, threatening the economy at the Port of Baltimore. Sunday\u2019s weather in the Baltimore area \u2013 which included lightning strikes \u2013 is what led officials to hold off on the demolition. \u201cWe were all set to do the precision cuts \u2026 today,\u201d Nick Ameen with the US Coast Guard told reporters Sunday. \u201cThere\u2019s several factors, environmental factors among them, that have unfortunately pushed that event until tomorrow.\u201d Ameen called the process a \u201cdynamic\u201d one and said, \u201cWe will absolutely not sacrifice safety for speed.\u201d He added: \u201cWhenever there\u2019s a lightning strike in the area, that pushes the clock back, and so that clock just kept getting pushed back and pushed back.\u201d Officials last week recovered the sixth and final body, allowing them to proceed with the plan to free the Dali. If the operation succeeds this weekend, the ship could be refloated and returned to the Port of Baltimore as soon as this week, The Baltimore Sun\u00a0and CNN affiliate\u00a0WBAL\u00a0previously reported. \u201cThe safest and swiftest method to remove the bridge piece from on top of the M/V Dali is by precision cuts made with small charges,\u201d the Key Bridge Response Unified Command said in a news release last week. \u201cThis is an industry-standard tool in controlled demolition that will break the span into smaller pieces,\u201d it added, \u201cwhich will allow the work of refloating the vessel and removing it from the federal channel.\u201d According to an infographic from the US Army and the US Army Corps of Engineers, the process will \u201clook like multiple puffs of smoke and sound like fireworks.\u201d Nearby communities should receive a \u201ccellular notification\u201d beforehand, according to\u00a0Unified Command, which includes\u00a0state and federal authorities, the US Coast Guard and Army Corps of Engineers among them. The 21 members of the ship\u2019s crew \u2013 who have not left the ship since it struck the bridge in late March \u2013 will remain onboard during the operation, according to Darrel Wilson, a spokesperson for Synergy Marine Group, which manages the Dali. \u201cThey will have a safe place on the vessel where they can shelter during the controlled explosion,\u201d Wilson said, adding that the crew was \u201cholding up well\u201d despite the stress of recent weeks. \u201cEven though they are not sailing, they are still performing\u00a0their normal crew duties,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cThis is still a large, complicated piece of equipment and there is a lot they have to look after.\u201d While the Dali\u2019s management company has tried to support the crew on board, members of Baltimore\u2019s seafaring community remain concerned for their wellbeing given the length of time they\u2019ve been aboard the ship. Rev. Josh Messick, executive director of the Baltimore International Seafarers\u2019 Center, told CNN the crew is well taken care of but feels disconnected from the rest of the world. They have internet access, thanks to hotspots Messick\u2019s group helped deliver, but they do not have their cellphones, which were confiscated by authorities as part of the investigation. \u201cThey are a little anxious because of the phone situation. We are trying to get their cellphones back to them,\u201d Messick said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just a phone, they can\u2019t access their online banking, their finances, their contacts, they can\u2019t look at photos of their loved ones before they go to sleep at night. It\u2019s a lot more than just a phone.\u201d In the meantime, several investigations continue into the cause of the disaster and who is responsible. The House Committee on Transportation & Infrastructure\u00a0plans to hold a hearing Wednesday\u00a0on the catastrophe, with testimony expected from the chair of the National Transportation Safety Board and officials from the Coast Guard, Army Corps of Engineers and the US Department of Transportation.

No one was injured during the incident in Abbeville at the St. Mary Magdalen Church, during which a \u201csuspicious person\u201d opened the back door of the building while Mass was underway, the church said in a statement. Parishioners immediately confronted the person, took him outside and called the police, the church said in a message to its community. Authorities, responding to a call about a suspicious person with a gun, arrived at the church and took the teen into custody, according to the Abbeville Police Department. After being questioned at the police station with a parent present, the suspect was taken to a hospital behavioral unit to be medically evaluated, police said. The teen has been charged with \u201cterrorizing\u201d and two counts of possession of a firearm by a juvenile, police said. The potentially dangerous encounter comes just a week after a man walked into Pennsylvania church service, pointed a gun at the pastor and pulled the trigger. The pastor was spared injury when the gun jammed, and the man was restrained until police arrived and placed him under arrest. In Louisiana, video of the church service streamed online shows associate pastor\u00a0Father Nicholas DuPr\u00e9 leading Mass when someone approached the altar and interrupted him mid-prayer to\u00a0whisper in his ear. Some parishioners in the front pews\u00a0appeared\u00a0concerned and turned around to look\u00a0toward the back of the church, the video shows. DuPr\u00e9\u00a0asked the congregation to sit and join him in repeating the Hail Mary prayer several times as a group of male parishioners moved along the center and front aisles of the church, frequently glancing toward the back of the room, the video shows. Once the suspect was apprehended, \u201claw enforcement entered the church to make sure there was no additional danger,\u201d the church\u2019s message said. \u201cThis understandably caused panic.\u201d The video shows parishioners began to get out of their seats, and the priest, still praying, could no longer be heard over the sound of the crowd. An armed law enforcement officer in a bulletproof vest entered the back of the sanctuary as the priest and deacon ducked behind the altar.\u00a0Altar\u00a0boys ran across the sanctuary one after the other. As panic began to take hold of the crowd, someone announced over a PA system, \u201cJust get a hold of your child.\u00a0Go slowly. We did apprehend a young man. He\u2019s in custody. \u2026 Calm down and just get next to your child and go slowly.\u201d \u201cWhile we realize this was a frightening experience for those in attendance, we are incredibly grateful to both parishioners and police officers for acting quickly to ensure the safety of all,\u201d the church statement said. The church said it will have uniformed officers at all upcoming Masses \u201cout of an abundance of cautious,\u201d the statement said. Abbeville Police Chief Mike Hardy extended thanks to the clergy and parishioners \u201cfor their quick response and remaining calm\u201d throughout the ordeal. The church said investigators are receiving assistance from the FBI. CNN has sought more information from police and the FBI. CNN also reached out to\u00a0St. Mary Magdalen\u00a0Church for more information. A\u00a0prayer was posted\u00a0on the church\u2019s Facebook page early Sunday morning. \u201cHoly Spirit, comforter of hearts, heal your people\u2019s wounds and transform brokenness into wholeness,\u201d\u00a0the\u00a0post\u00a0said. \u201cGrant us courage and wisdom, humility and grace, to act with justice.

{"id": "2024_05_11_us_missing-korean-war-soldier-identified", "text": "Sub-zero temperatures. Frigid winds. Snow falling across a \u201ctundra-like\u201d plain. These were the conditions soldiers faced in the Battle of the Chosin Reservoir. For some 17 days in late 1950, they fought through blistering cold in the North Korean mountains. With limited logistics and no hope of reinforcement, 30,000 UN soldiers faced over 120,000 Chinese troops in a battle considered one of the most brutal of the Korean War. There among the Americans was 19-year-old Cpl. John Albert Spruell, a son and brother from Cortez, Colorado. His unit \u2013 Battery B, 57th Field Artillery Battalion, 7th Infantry Division \u2013 went into combat near\u00a0the village of Hagaru-ri at the reservoir\u2019s edge. The fighting and the cold killed hundreds. Many others \u2013 as after US military clashes across the world for centuries \u2013 were deemed unaccounted for. When the horrors at the Chosin Reservoir had waned, the teenage warrior from Colorado was not recorded among the fallen. But nor was there evidence Spruell been taken prisoner, the Army said. So, on December 6, 1950, the branch issued its finding: \u201cMissing In Action.\u201d Back home in Cortez, Spruell\u2019s family was left to wonder what had happened to their soldier. His mother, Pauline Sleeper, probably didn\u2019t want to admit what her relatives decades later would say she almost certainly knew even then: Her child was dead. Still, though, she and her family had nothing to bury. A lack of proof and a mother\u2019s faith Soon after the war, the opposing nations embarked on Operation Glory, a 1954 exchange of thousands of sets of remains of Korean War dead. Among those recovered was one reportedly found near where the 57th\u00a0Field Artillery had fought at the Chosin Reservoir. A \u201ctentative association\u201d was made between the set and Spruell, the US Defense Department\u2019s Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency said. But there was no definitive proof. So, like all the others, the set of remains was given a code \u2013 Unknown X-15754 \u2013 sent to Honolulu and buried at the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific, often called the Punchbowl because it lies in an extinct volcano, the agency said. Spruell\u2019s name also was recorded, it said, at the cemetery\u2019s Courts of the Missing, where the names of 8,210 Americans lost in the Korean War were listed when it was dedicated in 1966. In time, the lost corporal\u2019s family moved forward. His eldest brother had a family of his own, naming one of his sons after his sibling who never came home from Korea. But the brother rarely spoke of the young man last seen halfway around the world near the Chosin Reservoir, said another one of his children, Dennis Spruell. \u201cI didn\u2019t hardly know anything about my uncle,\u201d Dennis Spruell said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t talk about it.\u201d But Sleeper never gave up on the hope her son lost in the war would return, said Dennis\u2019 cousin, Donna Lee Bailey, who was born after John Spruell last was seen on the battlefield. \u201cHis mother,\u201d she told CNN, \u201calways said he would come home.\u201d A DNA specimen and a fated phone call The Army, all the while, had Spruell listed as missing. And in its ongoing effort to close such cases, it had reached out to Dennis Spruell, he told CNN, for a sample of his DNA, which thanks to developments in science had become key to unlocking all kinds of mysteries long gone cold. Meantime, the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency in the summer of 2018 proposed disinterring 652 Korean War Unknowns buried at the Punchbowl to try again to identify them and return them to their families. The agency since 1982 has identified over 450 Americans killed in the Korean War, along with the initial 2,000 whose remains were returned at the war\u2019s close, it said, as over 7,500 US soldiers from the conflict remain unaccounted for. Three years passed before the agency could unearth the remains designated X-15754 and send them\u00a0to a laboratory for analysis. Nearly 70 years after they were sent back from the Chosin Reservoir zone, scientists used dental, anthropological, chest radiographs/x-rays \u2013 and DNA \u2013 to test the Unknown X-15754\u00a0specimens. Then last August, the agency made a positive ID. More recently, it called Dennis Spruell with the news. The remains known for decades only as X-15754 were what the tentative link had suggested: those of his uncle, Cpl. John A. Spruell. And now, Bailey said, \u201che\u2019s coming home.\u201d While most of Spruell\u2019s closest relatives have passed away, his childhood friend, Charles Haley, is still alive. He recalls Spruell didn\u2019t enroll for their senior year in high school. \u201cEverybody said, \u2018Well, he joined the Army\u2019 and that was kind of the end of it because we never heard any more,\u201d said Haley, who later joined the Army as well and was stationed in Japan. He remembers being silly with his friend as a kid, often playing pranks. Haley has also always made sure there was a flag on the headstone honoring Spruell in Cortez cemetery, switching them out when one got tattered or disappeared. \u201cTo suddenly find out that they identified the body and that they\u2019re going to be able to have a service. I know his folks are both gone,\u201d he said. \u201cI think is a real great relief to know that they know what happened to him.\u201d The makings of a mother and child reunion \u201cWhat the Army has done is gone above and beyond anything I could have ever imagined to honor a (lost) soldier,\u201d Dennis Spruell told CNN. Spruell\u2019s remains soon will be buried in Cortez, Colorado, the MIA/POW agency and his family said. A rosette will be placed next to his name at the Courts of the Missing to show he has been accounted for. And he finally will get the military decorations he\u2019s due, including the Purple Heart, US Army Mortuary Affairs Officer James Bell told CNN. The confirmation of John Spruell\u2019s remains, of course, is also bittersweet: \u201cI am sad that (his) siblings, which were my aunts and uncles and dad, did not survive long enough to know his history,\u201d Bailey said. Though Sleeper has died, a relative has her ashes. And with her warrior son\u2019s remains finally headed back home, the stage is set for the reunion his mother always knew would come. \u201cThey\u2019re hoping,\u201d Bailey said, \u201cto be able to bury them together.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/11/us/missing-korean-war-soldier-identified/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/13/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_05_11_us_northern-lights-how-to-watch", "text": "In case you missed the stunning nighttime spectacle of multicolored auroras dancing in the skies across the Northern Hemisphere, there is still a chance Sunday evening to catch a glimpse \u2013 but not for everyone. The auroras that have been visible starting Friday are a result of increased solar activity, including a series of solar flares and coronal mass projections from the sun, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\u2019s Space Weather Prediction Center. The dazzling curtains of green, red and purple lights were spotted from Maine to California and as far south as Alabama, Georgia and Florida on Friday and Saturday. However, people hoping for another sighting in the South and portions of the central United States may be out of luck. \u201cNo more vibrant aurora for Florida or any other \u2018unusual\u2019 places,\u201d said CNN meteorologist Allison Chinchar. \u201cToday is when we see the big shift back to the north for the lights,\u201d Chinchar said. \u201cSo all the usual places you would see the aurora, like Iceland, Canada, Scandinavian countries, etc. \u2026. that\u2019s where the focus will be going forward.\u201d In general, it\u2019s good to start looking during the time right after sunset. Weather, of course, is key, as cloud cover may limit the visibility of the aurora. Mostly clear conditions are expected in the northern portion of the US including Minneapolis and Fargo, North Dakota \u2013 some of the locations with the greatest chance of seeing the auroras on Sunday evening, according to Chinchar. But thicker cloud cover may inhibit viewing opportunities in a few spots in the Pacific Northwest and around the Great Lakes region. Green Bay, Wisconsin, is included in the area with the best viewing opportunities but those may be hampered by a chance of clouds and rain Sunday night, Chinchar said. New York City; Seattle, Washington; and Chicago are among locations where the auroras will possibly be visible on Sunday. The Space Weather Prediction Center, a division of the National Weather Service, observed conditions of an extreme geomagnetic storm at 6:54 p.m. ET on Friday evening, reaching a level 5 out of 5 severity. The last time a solar storm of this magnitude reached Earth was in October 2003, resulting in power outages in Sweden and damaged power transformers in South Africa, according to the center. Signs of a severe geomagnetic storm, or level 4, were first observed by scientists at the center at 12:37 p.m. ET, when a major disturbance was detected in Earth\u2019s magnetic field. Previously, the center issued a geomagnetic storm watch on Thursday evening, the first such watch issued since January 2005. But the forecast was upgraded after scientists observed G5, or extreme geomagnetic storm, conditions Friday evening. As the sun nears the peak of activity in its 11-year cycle, known as\u00a0solar maximum, later this year, researchers have observed increasingly intense solar flares erupting from the fiery orb. Increased solar activity causes auroras that dance around Earth\u2019s poles, known as the northern lights, or aurora borealis, and southern lights, or aurora australis. When the energized particles from coronal mass ejections reach Earth\u2019s magnetic field, they interact with gases in the atmosphere to create different colored light in the sky. The extreme geomagnetic storm will continue and persist through at least Sunday, according to the Space Weather Prediction Center. \u201cThe aurora will be more widespread and seen at lower latitudes\u201d during periods of stronger geomagnetic storm conditions, the center said Sunday. \u201cWe are less certain about how much of an Earth-directed impact we will have with the next pending (coronal mass ejection\u2019s) arrival as compared to our high level of certainty with the previous (coronal mass ejections) and extreme geomagnetic storms,\u201d said Shawn Dahl, a service coordinator with the Space Weather Prediction Center, on Sunday. \u201cTherefore, people wanting to see the aurora should keep checking our webpage and social media presence for news/updates of a new CME arrival,\u201d Dahl said in a statement to CNN. \u201cThe solar wind environment remains highly disturbed as passing CME influences continue, but gradually weaken,\u201d Dahl said. \u201cStill, it will not take much of any new CME arrival for geomagnetic storm levels to reach G3-G4 levels tonight.\u201d The storm\u00a0could affect the power grid\u00a0as well as satellite and high-frequency radio communications. The Biden administration\u00a0said it is monitoring the possibility of impacts. Bill Nye the Science Guy, an educator and engineer, said the massive solar storm could cause problems in a world that relies so much on electricity. Nye noted that a solar storm in 1859, known as the Carrington Event, lasted a week and severely affected telegraph communications, which at the time were state of the art. \u201cThe other thing, everybody, that is a real danger to our technological society, different from 1859, is how much we depend on electricity and our electronics and so on,\u201d Nye said. \u201cNone of\u00a0us really in the developed\u00a0world could go very long without electricity.\u201d There are systems in place to minimize the impact but \u201cstuff might go wrong,\u201d said Nye, noting not all transformers are equipped to withstand a massive solar event. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s just like the April 8th total solar eclipse. It really brings the fact that we live on a planet that\u2019s orbiting a star that\u2019s in a galaxy to our front door. It brings it down to earth,\u201d Dr. Hakeem Oluseyi, an astrophysicist, told CNN. \u201cIf you ask me, I\u2019d say a total solar eclipse is clearly number one. But next to a bright comet, aurorae are pretty amazing to see. And if you\u2019re near the northern extremes or the southern extremes, we cannot just get the colors in the sky, but the actual undulating curtains of nebulosity. That\u2019s pretty awesome. So the fact that that\u2019s going to extend to more people around the world, that\u2019s pretty cool.\u201d Nye added, \u201cLet\u2019s celebrate this.\u201d This story has been updated with additional information.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/11/us/northern-lights-how-to-watch/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/13/2024", "section": "us"}}
