Citing photographs and interviews with neighbors, the Times reports that the \u201cAppeal to Heaven\u201d flag was seen on display at his property last summer. The flag, which has a history dating to the Revolutionary War, has also become a symbol for supporters of former President Donald Trump. The flag is white and includes a green evergreen tree and the words \u201cAn Appeal to Heaven\u201d at the top. Alito and the Supreme Court did not immediately respond to a request for comment. It\u2019s the second revelation in as many weeks about a controversial display outside Alito\u2019s property. The New York Times last week published a photograph of an inverted American flag raised at Alito\u2019s home in Virginia in 2021.\u00a0Alito said the upside-down US flag was raised by his wife and was a response to a spat with neighbors. The episode has drawn fire from critics, including\u00a0Democrats and\u00a0key GOP senators,\u00a0who have called on the justice to recuse himself from cases involving Trump and the 2021 attack on the Capitol. Like the inverted US flag, the Appeal to Heaven flag \u2013 also known as the Pine Tree flag \u2013 was seen during the attack on the Capitol. House Speaker Mike Johnson faced blowback for displaying the same flag outside his office last year before assuming the leadership post. The Appeal to Heaven flag remains outside his office as of Wednesday. Johnson told CNN on Wednesday that \u201cit\u2019s George Washington\u2019s flag.\u00a0It goes back to the founder\u2019s era. I\u2019ve always flown that flag.\u201d \u201cIt has nothing to do with that,\u201d Johnson said, referring to \u201cstop the steal\u201d protests. The Alitos\u2019 choice of flags are gaining attention in part because several high-profile cases are currently pending before the high court involving the election and subsequent attack on the US Capitol, including the blockbuster question of whether Trump may claim immunity from federal election subversion charges. Another case deals with a January 6 defendant who is challenging an obstruction charge filed by federal prosecutors for his role in the attack.

{"id": "2024_05_20_us_baltimore-bridge-collapse-ship-relocation", "text": "After 55 days stuck in the Patapsco River, the Dali cargo ship was hauled away from the site of\u00a0its catastrophic crash into the Francis Scott Key Bridge \u2013 a crucial step toward fully reopening the busy Port of Baltimore. The ship\u2019s removal will now allow for \u201call pre-collapse deep-draft commercial vessels to enter and exit the Port of Baltimore,\u201d according to a Monday afternoon news release from the Unified Command, a joint task force composed of multiple government agencies responding to the disaster. The temporary federal channel will \u201csoon be\u201d 400 feet wide and 50 feet deep, the news release said. Officials have said they plan to open the permanent 700-foot-wide by 50-foot-deep federal navigation channel by the end of this month. \u201cThis marks the resumption of commercial vessel transits in and out of the Port of Baltimore,\u201d the task force said in a Monday statement. \u201cThis truly signifies the next chapter in restoring the waterway commerce in this region, which also serves as the economic engine for thousands of workers and their families who depend on commerce traveling through the Port of Baltimore.\u201d Several tugboats started pulling the 106,000-ton vessel at around 7 a.m. Monday, officials said. The ship traveled about 1 mph to the\u00a0Seagirt Marine Terminal in Baltimore. By late Monday morning, the Dali was docked at the terminal \u2013 the same spot it departed from on its ill-fated voyage almost eight weeks ago. There, the ship will undergo any necessary, temporary fixes before more permanent repairs can be made, officials have said. In the meantime, crews will remove any remaining bridge wreckage from the crash site until the channel can be fully reopened, Unified Command said. \u201cWe have refloated and moved the Dali \u2013 achieving in weeks what many thought would take months,\u201d Maryland Gov. Wes Moore said Monday on X. \u201cBut our work isn\u2019t done. We must continue to clear the full 700 foot federal channel, support the workers, businesses, and families affected by the collapse, and rebuild the Key Bridge.\u201d President Joe Biden called the removal a \u201cmark of progress and a promise kept.\u201d Authorities probe the cause of the calamity Federal authorities are still investigating why the cargo ship lost power, veered off course and smashed into the Key Bridge on March 26 \u2013 killing six construction workers. Multiple investigations are underway to try to determine who might be responsible. Last month, Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott announced a probe \u201cto hold the wrongdoers responsible and to mitigate the immediate and long-term harm\u201d to residents. The ship\u2019s Singaporean owner, Grace Ocean Private Limited, and manager, Synergy Marine PTE LTD, filed a petition in federal court last month asking for a $43.6 million limit on potential liability payouts. The city of Baltimore has asked the court to deny that request. The FBI, the US Coast Guard and the National Transportation Safety Board are also investigating.  Last week, the NTSB released a preliminary report saying the Dali had a pair of electrical failures minutes before the collision, as well as two blackouts while the ship was in port one day earlier. One of those in-port blackouts was caused by a crew error, the report said. The FBI and Coast Guard are looking into\u00a0whether the crew failed to report the\u00a0in-port power outage, according to a US official familiar with the matter. The crew has been stuck for nearly 2 months The Dali\u2019s 21-member crew has been confined to the ship since March 26 and will likely have to stay on board \u201cfor the foreseeable future,\u201d the ship\u2019s management company said. There is no immediate plan for what the 20 Indian and one Sri Lankan crew members will do after the Dali is relocated Monday, said Barbara Shipley, mid-Atlantic labor representative for the International Transport Workers\u2019 Federation. The seamen\u2019s one-month visas expired during the nearly two months they\u2019ve been trapped on board, according to one of the unions representing the crew members. The seafarers have been without their cell phones for more than a month because the FBI confiscated the devices as part of their ongoing investigation, Shipley said. \u201cIt\u2019s important to get these gentlemen back home to their families,\u201d she said. But international maritime regulations require the vessel to have some staff on board. Shipley hopes officials will prioritize deciding which of the men can go home and which need to stay behind. Though the seafarers have been stuck on board, they have not remained idle. They\u2019ve played a critical role in maintaining the ship\u2019s functioning and helping salvage crews navigate the boat, said Darrell Wilson, spokesperson for Synergy Marine Group \u2013 the company that manages the Dali vessel. Synergy has provided mental health services for the seamen, who have been grappling with the deaths of the six construction workers killed in the crash. \u201cIt has been tough for the seafarers, primarily (because) they know that there\u2019s been loss of life,\u201d said Gwee Guo Duan, assistant general secretary of the Singapore Maritime Officers\u2019 Union \u2013 one of the unions representing crew members on the Singaporean-flagged ship. \u201cIt is tough for them, being on board and having to look at the accident site every single day.\u201d This story has been updated with additional information.

{"id": "2024_05_22_us_uvalde-shooting-victims-lawsuit", "text": "Nineteen families of the students and teachers killed or injured at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, announced Wednesday they have settled a lawsuit with the city for $2 million, and announced they are suing 92 officers with Texas Department of Public Safety, the school district and individual employees. \u201cIt has been an unbearable two years,\u201d Javier Cazares, the father of 9-year-old victim Jacklyn Cazares, said at a news conference. \u201cWe all know who took our children\u2019s lives, but there was an obvious systemic failure out there on May 24. The whole world saw that. \u201cNo amount of money is worth the lives of our children. Justice and accountability has always been my main concern. We\u2019ve been let down so many times, that time has come to do the right thing,\u201d he said. The city confirmed the settlement in a statement. \u201cToday, we are thankful to join the victims\u2019 families in arriving at an agreement that will allow us to remember the Robb Elementary tragedy while moving forward together as a community to bring healing and restoration to all those affected,\u201d the city said. \u201cWe will forever be grateful to the victims\u2019 families for working with us over the past year to cultivate an environment of community-wide healing that honors the lives and memories of those we tragically lost. May 24th is our community\u2019s greatest tragedy.\u201d The announcement of the settlement and the latest legal action come just before the two-year anniversary of\u00a0the mass shooting in which an 18-year-old stormed into the elementary school, killed 19 children and two teachers and barricaded himself in a classroom. A total of 376 law enforcement officers from across the region rushed to the school to respond, but ultimately none of them breached the door to the classroom to confront the shooter for 77 minutes. The slow response was at odds with law enforcement active shooter protocols, widely accepted after the Columbine school shooting in 1999, to stop the threat immediately. As part of the settlement, Uvalde will pay the families a total of $2 million from its insurance coverage, according to a statement from attorneys Josh Koskoff and Erin Rogiers. In addition, the city pledged to institute several policy changes to the police department, such as a new \u201cfitness for duty\u201d standard for police officers. The city will also establish May 24 as an annual Day of Remembrance, will create a committee to coordinate designing a permanent memorial and will support mental health services for the families, survivors and community, the attorneys said. The terms of the settlement were reached through a \u201crestorative justice process\u201d between impacted families and the city, the attorneys said. Pursuing further legal action against Uvalde could have bankrupted the city, a result that none of the families wanted, they added. In a statement, Koskoff called the settlement a step in the healing process, and the mother of a student who was killed said it reflected a \u201cgood faith effort.\u201d \u201cFor two long years, we have languished in pain and without any accountability from the law enforcement agencies and officers who allowed our families to be destroyed that day. This settlement reflects a first good faith effort by the City of Uvalde to begin rebuilding trust in the systems that failed to protect us,\u201d Veronica Luevanos, whose daughter\u00a0Jailah and nephew Jayce were killed, said in a statement. \u201cBut it wasn\u2019t just Uvalde officers who failed us that day. Nearly 100 officers from the Texas Department of Public Safety have yet to face a shred of accountability for cowering in fear while my daughter and nephew bled to death in their classroom.\u201d Delayed law enforcement response widely criticized Also Wednesday, the attorneys announced they are suing 92 individual Texas DPS officers, the school district and several employees for their alleged failures responding to the shooting. \u201cLaw enforcement\u2019s inaction that day was a complete and absolute betrayal of these families and the sons, daughters and mothers they lost,\u201d Rogiers said in the statement. \u201cTXDPS had the resources, training and firepower to respond appropriately, and they ignored all of it and failed on every level. These families have not only the right but also the responsibility to demand justice, both for their own loss and to prevent other families from suffering the same fate.\u201d A spokesperson for the Uvalde Consolidated Independent School District said the district \u201cremains committed to supporting our community throughout this process\u201d but declined to comment on the specifics of the case, citing the ongoing litigation. \u201cThe District continues to be open to exploring a resolution involving all the families and individuals impacted by this tragedy,\u201d said Anne Marie Espinoza, the district\u2019s executive director of communications and marketing. CNN has reached out to the Texas Department of Public Safety and the DPS Officers Association for a response. The disastrous police response has been criticized in a series of government investigative reports, although no one has faced criminal repercussions. A scathing US Department of Justice report in January blamed the failed response on \u201ccascading failures of leadership, decision-making, tactics, policy, and training\u201d on the part of law enforcement officials and said lives would have been saved if police had followed generally accepted practices. Uvalde school district police chief Pete Arredondo was fired in August 2022 for his role in the failed response to the mass shooting. His replacement, Joshua Gutierrez, has submitted his resignation and his last day on the job is set for June, according to a school official\u2019s statement. The lawsuit announced Wednesday is just the latest civil action related to the mass shooting. Previously, the family of Eliahna Torres, a 10-year-old victim, filed a lawsuit in November 2022 against nearly two dozen people and entities, including the gun manufacturer and store that provided the rifle used in the attack and law enforcement officials who responded to the scene. In addition, survivors of the shooting filed a $27 billion class action lawsuit in federal court in December 2022 against multiple Texas law enforcement agencies. A trial date has not been set in either lawsuit. Officials have said the shooter legally purchased the guns in the days after his 18th birthday. The carnage remains among the deadliest episodes in America\u2019s ongoing scourge of school shootings.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/us/uvalde-shooting-victims-lawsuit/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/23/2024", "section": "us"}}

But more pandas are set to arrive in different parts of the United States. In April, it was announced China would send giant\u00a0pandas to live at San Francisco\u2019s zoo for the first time. And the San Diego Zoo announced in February it would receive two giant pandas from China, marking the first time the country has granted new\u00a0panda\u00a0loans in the US in two decades. Pandas have served as something of an unofficial barometer of China-US relations since 1972, when Beijing gifted a pair of the bears to the Smithsonian National Zoo, following US President Richard Nixon\u2019s historic ice-breaking trip to China. Chinese leader Xi Jinping said in 2023 the bamboo-eating bears serve as \u201cenvoys of friendship between the Chinese and American peoples.\u201d Just over 1,800 giant pandas remain in the wild, according to the World Wildlife Fund, which lists the species as vulnerable and describes them as the world\u2019s rarest bear.

{"id": "2024_05_22_us_ethan-crumbleys-parents-refuse-help-appeal", "text": "A Michigan judge on Wednesday denied Ethan Crumbley\u2019s request for his parents\u2019 pre-sentence investigation reports to help him appeal his life without parole sentence. Ethan was sentenced in December after pleading guilty to gunning down four classmates and wounding six others and a teacher at Michigan\u2019s Oxford High School in 2021. He was 15 at the time. His parents, James and Jennifer Crumbley, were each sentenced to 10 to 15 years in prison earlier this year following manslaughter convictions. As part of the appeal of his sentence, Ethan asked a state court for the confidential pre-sentence reports used in the trial of his parents, arguing his family and home environment are relevant to his appeal. On Wednesday, Oakland County Circuit Judge Cheryl Matthews sided with the parents and denied the request for the pre-sentence reports, according to Ashley Williams, a member of Matthews\u2019 legal staff. The sentencing court was required to consider his family background, including his home environment, because he was under the age of 18 at the time of the offenses, Ethan\u2019s attorneys wrote in a motion earlier this month. In response, prosecutors did not take a position on the matter and noted the parents\u2019 pre-sentence reports were not created until months after Ethan was sentenced. Alona Sharon, an attorney for Ethan\u2019s father, wrote in response to the motion that Ethan is \u201cable bodied\u201d and \u201ccapable of advising his counsel about his childhood, his parents and his home environment. Counsel has failed to explain to this Honorable Court why they cannot learn this evidence from Ethan directly.\u201d An attorney for Ethan\u2019s mother wrote in a court filing that the documents are \u201cprivileged and confidential\u201d and she had \u201cnot waived her statutory privilege allowing the disclosure of her pre-sentence report.\u201d Jennifer Crumbley\u2019s attorney wrote that in a bid to show that her son\u2019s trial counsel was ineffective, Ethan \u201cis simply attempting to engage in a fishing expedition for information that (he) hopes will prove helpful.\u201d Her attorney wrote Ethan should be able to provide his attorney with any information about his \u201cfamily and home environment\u201d that may be relevant under the law. The Crumbleys are the first parents to be held criminally responsible for a mass school shooting committed by their children\u00a0as the nation continues to grapple with\u00a0the scourge of gunfire on campuses. Attorneys for Ethan and his parents did not immediately respond to CNN requests for comment. Ethan was sentenced last year after pleading guilty to\u00a0terrorism\u00a0causing death, four counts of murder and 19 other related charges. He\u00a0did not testify in his parents\u2019 trials. Ethan admitted in court that on November 30, 2021, he took a gun from an unlocked container in his home, hid it in his backpack and took it out in a bathroom before opening fire on his schoolmates. He killed Madisyn Baldwin, 17; Justin Shilling, 17; Hana St. Juliana, 14; and Tate Myre, 16. At the parents\u2019 trials, prosecutors used testimony from shooting survivors, police investigators and school employees to show James and Jennifer Crumbley were \u201cgrossly negligent\u201d in allowing their teenage son to have access to the gun and ignoring signs of his spiraling mental health. In pre-sentence investigation reports included in the prosecution\u2019s sentencing memos, the parents continued to defend their actions. \u201cI am wrongly accused, and now wrongly convicted of Involuntary Manslaughter. My actions were that of any other parent,\u201d James Crumbley wrote. He also said he \u201chad no knowledge of what (my son) was going to do, or presented with ANY warning signs,\u201d and he defended his gun safety efforts. \u201cI followed the law and took gun safety to the point as needed.\u201d In her report, Jennifer Crumbley sought to clarify her testimony, saying she would not have done anything differently. \u201cWith the information I have now, of course my answer would be hugely different. There are so many things that I would change if I could go back in time,\u201d she said. \u201cI never imagined he would hurt other people in the way that he did.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/us/ethan-crumbleys-parents-refuse-help-appeal/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/23/2024", "section": "us"}}

But last week, her message to her\u00a0more than\u00a06.5 million combined followers on Instagram and TikTok was anything but. Instead of her usual smiling, clapping and cheering, the popular social media creator, whose full name is Rachel Griffin Accurso, was in tears. \u201cThe bullying is so bad. It\u2019s so bad. But I can handle this,\u201d she said in\u00a0a video\u00a0posted to her accounts last\u00a0Thursday. It showed a closeup of an emotional Accurso in a dark room, wiping her eyes. \u201cThat is who I am. I love my neighbor. I love every child,\u201d she added. \u201cImagining for one second what a mom is going through unable to feed her child or give her child clean water or keep her child safe.\u201d The backlash had started\u00a0four\u00a0days earlier, after Accurso announced a campaign to raise money for children in several war-torn parts of the world, including Gaza.\u00a0She began receiving\u00a0angry comments on her posts, asking why she wasn\u2019t also trying to help victims of Hamas\u2019 deadly October 7 attack on Israel. \u201cYou should be for all children not just the children in gaza. Do you not care what hamas did to all the innocent jewish children october 7th???\u201d\u00a0one Instagram\u00a0comment said. \u201cYou mention the children of Gaza in your video \u2026 how about the children held hostage? Do you care about all children?\u201d another commenter posted on TikTok. In the caption on her tearful May 16 video, Accurso reiterated her concern for all the world\u2019s children. \u201cPalestinian children, Israeli children, children in the US \u2013 Muslim, Jewish, Christian children \u2013 all children, in every country,\u201d\u00a0she wrote. \u201cNot one is excluded.\u201d Her clarification was not enough to quell backlash from commenters who accused her of disregarding the pain of Israeli children. CNN has reached out to Accurso for comment. Between the polarizing Israel-Hamas war and fiery recent protests on US college campuses, some social media influencers have felt pressure to speak up. But the Ms Rachel episode is a reminder that even the most innocuous influencers can\u00a0face pushback\u00a0when they wade into a thorny issue like the Middle East. She raised $50,000 within hours for children affected by war Accurso is an educator who uses videos filled with songs and games to help toddlers and parents navigate the early childhood years. Her series, \u201cSongs for Littles,\u201d features catchy, educational tunes that are popular with both parents and young children. Her videos are a hit with 9.8 million subscribers\u00a0on YouTube, and span a myriad of topics, including learning how to talk and read. She announced her fundraising campaign\u00a0in a video\u00a0posted May 12 to her TikTok and Instagram accounts, offering to make Cameos \u2014 paid personalized video messages that a celebrity can film on request. Accurso said her earnings from the videos will go to Save the Children\u2019s emergency fund for kids affected by war and mentioned Gaza along with Sudan, Ukraine, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. \u201cHopefully I can make little ones smile by giving them a personal video and then the money will go to help more children living in unimaginable circumstances,\u201d she said in the video. \u201cChildren should never experience the horrors of war. These are grave violations of their human rights. Children should be protected.\u201d A day later, she posted another message on the horrifying effects of war. \u201cWe should be ashamed of how children around the world are suffering,\u201d she wrote. Cameo requests and money flooded in. Within hours, she\u2019d raised\u00a0$50,000 from 500 requests\u00a0for personal videos, she said. \u201cEvery penny on my end will go to [Save the Children] to help children facing unimaginable circumstances,\u201d she wrote.\u00a0CNN has reached out to Save the Children for comment. Accurso then paused the\u00a0Cameo requests,\u00a0saying she needed time to film the 500 personalized videos before she could accept\u00a0any\u00a0more. Then came the backlash. A few days later, she posted the tearful video, with the comments turned off\u00a0on Instagram. Instead of her trademark pink T-shirt and denim dungarees, she was barely visible in dim lighting and clutching what appeared to be a blanket. She did not go into details about the bullying she said she\u2019s received and has disabled comments on YouTube and\u00a0some\u00a0Instagram posts. She also received supportive messages. \u201cThis is a moral litmus test and you\u2019re on the right side,\u201d one commenter posted on her TikTok. \u201cStay strong.\u201d Another added: \u201cYou are the Mr. Rogers to our babies\u2019 generation. Thank you for using your platform in such an influential way.\u201d Divisive issues can be tricky for social media influencers, expert says Hamas-led militants killed about 1,200 people in southern Israel on October 7 and took some 250 hostages into Gaza. In response, Israel launched a war on Hamas in Gaza that continues seven months later. More than 14,000 children have been killed in Gaza since the war started in October,\u00a0according to the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund. About 12,000 more children have been wounded and thousands remain missing, it says. \u201cRafah is a city of children,\u201d UNICEF\u00a0spokesperson James Elder said\u00a0this month, referring to the Palestinian city in southern Gaza. \u201cIf we define safety \u2014 as international humanitarian law says we must \u2014 as freedom from bombardment, as well as access to safe water, sufficient food, shelter and medicine \u2014 then there is nowhere safe on the Gaza Strip to go to.\u201d Accurso is one of a number of\u00a0social media influencers\u00a0who have used their platforms to raise funds as the humanitarian crisis unfolds in Gaza.\u00a0She describes herself as an ambassador for\u00a0Save the Children. Giselle Ugarte, an online performance and personal branding coach, says joining conversations on such a divisive issue can be tricky for a social media influencer like Accurso, whose brand is built around kids. \u201cMs Rachel is someone who is looked at as an educational resource for young children, a neutral force and a safe place, separated from any of the dangers of the outside world,\u201d she said. \u201cParents want to feel that they can step away from the screen and not have to worry about their children consuming content outside of her traditional programming.\u201d Ugarte said she advises influencers to assess whether wading into a polarizing issue aligns with their mission and brand, and to first \u201crecognize the potential backlash, consequences or perhaps even physical dangers.\u201d Accurso\u00a0has\u00a0said she plans to resume\u00a0her Cameo fundraising campaign.\u00a0And she\u2019s back to pleading for help for the children of Gaza. \u201cI saw a picture of two babies in Gaza and their thighs are like this small,\u201d she said in\u00a0a post Tuesday, choking back tears and making a circle with her thumb and forefinger. \u201cWe can\u2019t let children starve.

{"id": "2024_05_22_business_dupont-de-nemours-company-split", "text": "DuPont de Nemours, the American multinational chemical company that traces its history back to 1802, announced plans to split into three publicly traded companies on Wednesday. The company plans to spin off its electronics and water businesses into their own yet-to-be-named companies in a transaction that is tax-free to shareholders. DuPont said it expects to complete the breakup transactions within the next 18 to 24 months, and it is subject to final approval by DuPont\u2019s board of directors. The announcement also included a shakeup in leadership: Effective June 1, DuPont\u2019s chief financial officer, Lori Koch, will step into the CEO role. DuPont\u2019s current CEO, Ed Breen, will stay on as executive chairman. Koch will remain CEO of the new, slimmed-down DuPont once the spin-offs are complete, according to the company. DuPont\u2019s breakup comes amid other large, multi-national companies announcing breakups in recent years, with many CEOs and corporate boards touting the agility of smaller companies. In a statement, Breen echoed a similar refrain, saying the three smaller companies would have greater flexibility after the spin-off. \u201cThe three-way separation will unlock incremental value for shareholders and customers and also create new opportunities for employees,\u201d he said. \u201cCritically, each company will have greater flexibility to pursue their own focused growth strategies, including portfolio enhancing M&A (mergers and acquisitions).\u201d In the last several years, major American companies like J&J, Kellogg and General Electric announced company break-ups and spin-offs, signaling a preference for smaller, more nimble companies over the conglomerates that gained prominence in previous decades. This is the second DuPont breakup in half a decade. In 2019, DowDuPont, which was created in a DuPont merger with Dow Chemical, broke apart into three separate entities: DuPont, Dow Chemical and Corteva, the company\u2019s agriculture business. On Wednesday, DuPont said the newly formed electronics company would focus on \u201csemiconductor solutions and advanced electronics products,\u201d while the new water company would be \u201ca comprehensive water solutions provider.\u201d The leftover divisions will remain as part of DuPont.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/business/dupont-de-nemours-company-split/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/23/2024", "section": "us"}}

{"id": "2024_05_18_us_baltimore-bridge-dali-ship-crew", "text": "When the Rev. Mark Nestlehutt boarded the Dali cargo ship a week after it crashed into a Baltimore bridge, anxious questions emerged among the 21 crew members: \u201cWhen will I get off the ship? When will I be able to get home?\u201d More than a month later, crew members still don\u2019t know the answers. They\u2019ve been confined to the ill-fated Dali ever since it lost power, veered off course and crushed the Francis Scott Key Bridge on March 26, killing six construction workers. Since then, the 20 Indians and one Sri Lankan on board have mourned the deaths of those lives lost, had their cell phones confiscated by the FBI and endured a series of controlled explosions to break apart a massive piece of bridge stuck atop the ship\u2019s bow. \u201cIt has been tough for the seafarers, primarily (because) they know that there\u2019s been loss of life,\u201d said Gwee Guo Duan, assistant general secretary of the Singapore Maritime Officers\u2019 Union, one of the unions representing crew members on the Singaporean-flagged ship. \u201cIt is tough for them, being on board and having to look at the accident site every single day.\u201d But it could be weeks or even months before they can leave, due to an array of complications \u2013 including US visas that expired while they\u2019ve been trapped. Here\u2019s why they\u2019re still stuck on board \u2013 and how they\u2019re coping with unimaginable stressors: Maritime rules say the ship must be staffed A massive vessel like the 984-foot, 106,000-ton Dali requires constant care \u2013 even if it\u2019s not moving. And a ship stuck on a river still faces a host of potential hazards, said Philip C. Schifflin Jr., director of the Center for Mariner Advocacy. \u201cYou can take on water. There\u2019s machinery running \u2026 anytime machinery is running, there\u2019s a particular risk of something failing and causing a fire or something like that,\u201d Schifflin said. \u201cSo seafarers need to be on board ready to respond to those various hazards. And that\u2019s by law.\u201d The United States has \u201cminimum requirements for the manning of vessels,\u201d according to the Office of the Federal Register, and similar international regulations have been widely adopted. \u201cBy international maritime regulations, there has to be some crew left on the vessel,\u201d said Nestlehutt, president and executive director of The Seamen\u2019s Church Institute, which promotes the safety and welfare of mariners. The nonprofit responds to seamen in distress around the world, including those afflicted by hurricanes, pirate incidents or deaths at sea. When Nestlehutt visited the Dali crew on April 1, he immediately noticed their \u201csense of great loss and sadness\u201d about the construction workers killed, and the seamen \u201cwanted to let their own family members know that they were safe,\u201d he said. But days later, the crew lost contact with their families when the FBI seized the crew\u2019s cell phones on April 15 as part of its ongoing investigation into the crash. \u2018Unfounded fear\u2019 among the crew members After the FBI boarded the Dali and seized the seamen\u2019s cell phones, a wave of anxiety permeated the ship, according to a joint statement from the Singapore Maritime Officers\u2019 Union, which represents the ship\u2019s officers, and the Singapore Organisation of Seamen, which represents the other crew members. The seafarers have since received new cell phones, Duan told CNN Thursday. But the FBI has only returned some of the crew members\u2019 SIM cards, he said. Although investigators have not blamed any individual for the power outages that led up to the fatal crash, seamen have felt an \u201cUnfounded fear of personal criminal liability,\u201d the two unions representing the crew members said. \u201cHowever long the investigation takes, the crew\u2019s rights and welfare should not be infringed upon during its course,\u201d\u00a0Dave Heindel, president of the Seafarers International Union, said in a statement. \u201cWe call on the authorities to be mindful that seafarers utilize mobile devices to conduct personal business for bill payments and more importantly, transfer money to their home country to sustain families,\u201d he said. \u201cCrew members are becoming demoralized without the basic tools we all take for granted.\u201d \u201cThe prolonged detention of MV Dali seafarers aboard their vessel and the failure by authorities to return their personal communication devices are unjust,\u201d Don Marcus, president of the International Organization of Masters, Mates & Pilots, said in a statement. \u201cOur hearts go out to the Master, Officers and Crew of the M/V Dali, who not only suffered a mortifying and tragic experience resulting in the loss of six lives, but who continue to remain in isolation from their loved ones.\u201d Stationary, but not sedentary While they await news about their fates, the crew members are staying busy \u2013 not just with their ship duties but also by helping investigators and salvage crews. \u201cObviously, this is not a normal environment for them. But they\u2019re all professional seafarers, so they\u2019re doing what they need to do,\u201d said Darrell Wilson, spokesperson for Synergy Marine Group \u2013 the company that manages the Dali. \u201cTheir days are full. They have normal duties on board. They need to look after the ship, look after equipment, make sure everything is working and functioning that needs to. They\u2019re also assisting with the salvors.\u201d The seafarers play a critical role in helping the salvage crews because \u201cthey know all the\u00a0passageways. They know where everything is on the ship,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cSo if somebody has a question about where can we hook up to get running water,\u201d the seafarers can help, Wilson said. \u201cThe crew is essentially just assisting in any way possible.\u201d As for who\u2019s helping the crew members with food, toiletries and other day-to-day necessities, Synergy Marine \u201cdispatched reps here immediately \u2026 making sure they have everything they need, helping bring extra supplies on board or arranging for extra supplies to be brought on board,\u201d Wilson said. In addition, \u201cthey have coordinated to have visits by some of the seafarers\u2019 organizations. Some of the seafarers\u2019 ministries have been on. The two respective embassies have been in contact with the crew and even made a visit to the ship,\u201d he said. Synergy has also provided mental health services for the crew, which Duan\u00a0\u2013 the Singapore Maritime Officers\u2019 Union official \u2013\u00a0credits for helping a seaman who was traumatized after he frantically tried to search for survivors the night of the deadly crash. \u201cOne of them actually ran to the front of the vessel, which is the bow, to actually try to look for survivors from the accident\u201d \u2013 despite the heaps of debris from the bridge that could fall at any moment, Duan said. On May 13, after six weeks atop the bow of the Dali, a massive piece of the Key Bridge was blown apart in a series of controlled explosions \u2013 with the crew still on board. Many hoped the removal would mean the crew might be able to set sail or at least get off the ship soon. But more hurdles loom. Their visas expired while they\u2019ve been stuck In addition to the staffing regulations, the ongoing investigations and questions about whether the Dali is fit to sail, the crew members can\u2019t even set foot on US soil. Their one-month visas expired during the nearly two months they\u2019ve been trapped on the Dali, Duan said. Even the ship\u2019s management company doesn\u2019t know when the crew can leave. \u201cThey\u2019re going to be on for the foreseeable future,\u201d Wilson told CNN Wednesday. \u201cWe\u2019re working to refloat the vessel in a few days and move it to a local terminal here. And then at some point in the future \u2013 and I don\u2019t have that date \u2013 the company will look for guidance from the authorities on the next steps with the crew.\u201d Duan,\u00a0who visited the crew April 24 and communicates with the captain regularly, said he doesn\u2019t expect the ship to leave the Baltimore area until authorities have completed their investigation. The National Transportation Safety Board\u2019s preliminary report about the crash did not include a probable cause, which will be part of a final report that could take investigators up to two years to complete. \u201cWithout the final report, I don\u2019t think the vessel is going anywhere\u201d far from Baltimore, Duan said. On Monday, several tugboats towed the vessel to the Port of Baltimore\u2019s Seagirt Marine Terminal \u2013 the same spot the Dali departed from on its ill-fated voyage almost eight weeks ago. There, the ship will undergo\u00a0any necessary, temporary fixes\u00a0before more permanent repairs can be made, officials have said. In the meantime, Duan hopes nonessential crew members will be allowed to get off the ship and stay temporarily on dry land to \u201cease their mental stress.\u201d The crew members\u2019 unions have publicly called for the extension or renewal of the seamen\u2019s visas. Duan also hopes US authorities will re-evaluate who must stay on the ship, and who might be able to fly home. \u2018We take their sacrifices for granted\u2019 The plight of the Dali\u2019s crew highlights the personal sacrifices made by workers who often leave their families for months at a time to provide goods that many consumers use every day. \u201cI think most of us think of the items that we use on a daily basis show up on Amazon or \u2026 Walmart, etc. The reality is 90% of the cargo in the world is carried on vessels,\u201d said Schifflin, the director of the Center for Mariner Advocacy. \u201cVessels are manned by seafarers. And to most of us \u2013 the vast majority of us \u2013 they\u2019re invisible. We don\u2019t even know they\u2019re there. And I think a lot of times, we take their sacrifices for granted.\u201d CNN\u2019s Gloria Pazmino contributed to this report.

{"id": "2024_05_22_business_nvidias-stock-split-earnings-results", "text": "Nvidia announced a 10-for-1 stock split on Wednesday, making buying shares in the red-hot semiconductor company more accessible for individual investors. Five years ago, an investor could have purchased Nvidia stock for less than $50 a share. But since then, the stock has exploded more than 2,500%. A single share in the company was worth $949.50 as of Wednesday\u2019s close. Nvidia\u2019s (NVDA) announcement, which came in its quarterly earnings report, means that each common share will be split into 10 smaller shares, effectively cutting the price of investing in the company. The company posted yet another quarter of strong financial results on Wednesday, as well. Nvidia reported a 262% increase in revenue and a 462% increase in profits year-over-year. Nvidia\u2019s post-split shares will begin trading at the market open on June 10, coming at a time when Nvidia\u2019s stock has been on a tear, fueled by investor enthusiasm about the company\u2019s role in artificial intelligence. Nvidia shares rose as much as 4% in after-hours trading following the report. Nvidia is crucial to the burgeoning AI space. The American chipmaker is unmatched in producing processors that power artificial intelligence systems, including for generative AI, the buzzy new technology that can create text, images and other media.  And the company\u2019s soaring stock price over the past year means Nvidia is now deeply important to the broader market, too. The company has become something of a bellwether for the larger AI boom that has been driving the recent market rally. That the company was again able to exceed Wall Street\u2019s predications for its booming sales growth on Wednesday isn\u2019t entirely surprising. Many of the major tech giants, including Microsoft, Meta, Alphabet and others, have announced in recent weeks that they\u2019re continuing to pour billions of dollars into building AI infrastructure, and no company is better poised to be the beneficiary of that investment than Nvidia. Still, some investors had raised questions ahead of Wednesday\u2019s report about just how long Nvidia could keep the rally going. The company faces growing competition from in-house AI chips from Amazon and Alphabet, and it has had to contend with US restrictions on exports of advanced AI chips to China. \u201cThere was no secret around Wall Street that Nvidia\u2019s earnings would come in hot once again,\u201d Investing.com senior analyst Thomas Monteiro said in a statement following the report. \u201cWhile the company didn\u2019t repeat the same total blowout from the last few quarters in any specific area, today\u2019s numbers remain incredibly strong, leaving no doubt that the company\u2019s leadership in the AI revolution remains unchallenged for now.\u201d Nvidia said it expects revenue for the current quarter to grow approximately 107% year-over-year, a slight slowdown from the meteoric sales growth the company has posted over the past few quarters as it hits the one-year mark from when the AI boom began to take off.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/business/nvidias-stock-split-earnings-results/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/23/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_05_22_politics_nikki-haley-donald-trump", "text": "Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley plans to vote for Donald Trump, she said Wednesday in her first public remarks since exiting the Republican presidential primary more than two months ago. Haley said Trump \u201chas not been perfect\u201d on policies important to her, including foreign policy, immigration and the economy, but President Joe Biden \u201chas been a catastrophe.\u201d \u201cSo I will be voting for Trump,\u201d said Haley, who served as US ambassador to the United Nations under the former president. Haley\u2019s remarks about the 2024 race came during a Q&A session following a speech at the conservative Hudson Institute in Washington, DC, where she now serves as the Walter P. Stern chair. Haley said she has \u201cno regrets\u201d about her GOP primary bid: \u201cWe left it all on the field.\u201d She also thanked the primary voters who have continued to back her even after her departure from the race \u2014 a potential warning sign for Trump. And she reiterated the call she\u2019d made when exiting the race in March for the former president to reach out to those voters. \u201cTrump would be smart to reach out to the millions of people who voted for me and continue to support me, and not assume that they\u2019re just going to be with him. And I genuinely hope he does that,\u201d Haley said. Earlier this year, Haley and Trump were engaged in what had become a bitter primary feud.  Haley, at one point, questioned the former president\u2019s mental fitness. She told CNN in January that Trump and Biden were \u201cequally bad.\u201d Her critiques of Trump during the primary grew even sharper after the former president mocked the absence of her deployed husband and called for all of her donors to be \u201cpermanently barred from the MAGA camp.\u201d \u201cIn that moment, he showed that with that kind of disrespect for the military, he\u2019s not qualified to be the president of the United States, because I don\u2019t trust him to protect them,\u201d Haley said in February. Then, days before dropping out, she said she no longer believed she was bound by the Republican National Committee pledge to support the party\u2019s eventual presidential nominee. \u2018Dangerous worldview\u2019 As she ventured back onto the political stage Wednesday, after two months out of public view, Haley didn\u2019t mention Trump in her Hudson Institute speech \u2014 only addressing the former president when asked about him afterward. \u201cA dangerous worldview has risen on both sides of the aisle,\u201d she said in her remarks. \u201cOnce again, it threatens our prosperity and security. We need to take this seriously.\u201d She offered full support for Israel\u2019s war with Hamas and strongly criticized Biden for placing conditions on military aid to the country. \u201cBiden thinks he\u2019s stopping a war,\u201d Haley said. \u201cIn fact, he\u2019s dragging out a war, emboldening terrorists and making other wars more likely.\u201d She was also critical of her fellow Republicans, urging the party to support military aid for Ukraine and Israel. But she did not criticize GOP members by name and praised House Speaker Mike Johnson for the recent passage of a military aid package. \u201cSending weapons to Ukraine and Israel isn\u2019t foreign aid,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s an investment in a world in which authoritarian dictators cannot run roughshod over free countries.\u201d Since leaving the race in March, the former South Carolina governor has spent time reconnecting with her family, aides say, including her husband, Michael, who returned from a yearlong overseas deployment. Yet even in her absence, she\u2019s been winning votes in one Republican primary after another. Her lingering support has exposed a potential challenge Trump faces to unifty the party in suburban areas of swing states \u2013 such as outside Philadelphia, where Haley received nearly 25% of the vote in both Chester and Montgomery counties. While Trump has not extended an olive branch to Haley or her supporters, the Biden campaign has closely studied the Republican primary results, aides say, even in deep-red states such as Indiana, where Haley received about 22% of the vote earlier this month. The Biden campaign has sought to reach Haley\u2019s supporters through television and digital ads in hopes of reminding them of Trump\u2019s insults aimed at their candidate. \u201cThe campaign has the opportunity to target and engage high-information Republican voters like Nikki Haley supporters or other voters who voted for Donald Trump in \u201920, but voted for Democratic candidates in \u201822 across battleground states,\u201d a top Biden adviser told CNN. The Biden campaign argued Wednesday that Haley\u2019s backing of Trump doesn\u2019t change the choice before voters. \u201cNothing has changed for the millions of Republican voters who continue to cast their ballots against Donald Trump in the primaries and care deeply about the future of our democracy, standing strong with our allies against foreign adversaries, and working across the aisle to get things done for the American people \u2013 while also rejecting the chaos, division and violence that Donald Trump embodies,\u201d campaign communications director Michael Tyler said in a statement. \u201cOnly one candidate shares those values, and only one campaign is working hard every day to earn their support \u2013 and that\u2019s President Biden\u2019s.\u201d It\u2019s an open question how many of those voters backing Haley in primary contests are lodging a temporary protest against Trump or actually open to supporting Biden. Republican Rep. Ralph Norman of South Carolina, who endorsed Haley in the primary before switching his support to Trump, said he believes she should be on the GOP ticket. \u201cFor Nikki Haley, in Indiana, to pull over 20% and not be on the ballot is amazing,\u201d Norman told CNN. \u201cThat\u2019s why she would make a great VP candidate. And I made that pitch to President Trump and also to Nikki Haley.\u201d Norman said that while Haley has not expressed interest in joining Trump\u2019s ticket, he believes she would be interested. \u201cPolitics is an interesting game. People can forget the past and look forward to the future,\u201d Norman said. For his part, Trump has said Haley \u201cis not under consideration\u201d but said he wished her well.

{"id": "2024_05_20_us_family-heirloom-reunited-social-media", "text": "When her mother died two years ago, Celia Bashaw began dreaming about art, and not just any art. Her thoughts were fixed on an heirloom her great uncle, Chuck Perkins, had carved. Her mother and grandmother had loved it. But Bashaw couldn\u2019t find it. She knew it had been picked up after her grandmother\u2019s death when the family was going through her belongings, 15 years ago. And she knew her great uncle, who lived in Vermont, had given it away there, hoping the new owners would hold on to it. As it turned out, they sold it. So she decided to make a Facebook post in a group for Vermonters, hoping she could track down the buyers and get the piece back. \u201c(My mom) had a whole chest of photos. A bunch of photographs of everybody in the family and all the things that were really special to her.\u201d Bashaw told CNN. \u201cIn those photos, there were very good, prominent photos of the family heirloom that I was looking for. Before, I hadn\u2019t had any good photos of it. I just had a description.\u201d Bashaw attached three photos of the engraving, which portrayed a leopard lounging in a tree. The post was shared about 600 times, according to CNN affiliate WCAX. Some commenters noted the piece looked different from the one Bashaw had originally posted. Bashaw replied while it had been through some wear and tear, she was able to confirm it was the same work from her great uncle\u2019s woodburned signature on the back. \u201cIt\u2019s really a one-of-a-kind engraving, so when this man sent me a picture of it, I was like, \u2018There\u2019s no way somebody did something so identical to my uncle\u2019s carving,\u2019\u201d Bashaw said. \u201cIt\u2019s got to be the one, like there\u2019s no way I can let this go.\u201d Then, in Rutland, Vermont, Chris McKirryher and her partner, Phil Matte, saw the Facebook post and realized they had the solution to Bashaw\u2019s long-shot quest. At a yard sale in Pittsford, Vermont, the couple had bought the carving. They arranged a meeting and Bashaw made the two-and-a-half hour drive from Plattsburgh, New York, to Vermont. She told CNN McKirryher and Matte were \u201cjust so darling\u201d and she \u201cloved them immediately.\u201d Despite being nervous about meeting strangers from the internet, Bashaw found the duo were \u201cso nice and such great people.\u201d \u201cWith all the bad news and everything going around, it\u2019s good to see something really nice,\u201d Matte told WCAX, who agreed to sell it back to Bashaw. In an updated post to the Facebook group, Bashaw shared her excitement at being reunited with her great uncle\u2019s artwork, thanking her friends, family and community for sharing and helping her find the piece. \u201cI\u2019m over the moon happy (and) lucky.\u201d she wrote. Now, Bashaw feels like a piece of her mother and grandmother has come back home. \u201cIt\u2019s really nice because I don\u2019t have very many things of my mother or my grandmother and actually, it\u2019s been extremely hard for me to even find a picture of me and my grandmother together. We were so close, and it just makes me so sad.\u201d she said. \u201cHaving a piece of art that was so important to them finally be back and in my grasp\u2026 I wish I could tell my mom about it because she would just scream, just like I did \u2026 I hope she can see it now that I have it back because she was looking for it too,\u201d she added. Bashaw, an artist herself, plans to put the carving back in her grandfather\u2019s house instead of in her own. \u201cHe has the wall still where there\u2019s like, almost a frame outline of where it used to be, so it\u2019s like as soon, I put it there, it\u2019s just supposed to be there. So, I think it\u2019ll bring some solace to my grandpa, too.\u201d she said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/20/us/family-heirloom-reunited-social-media/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/23/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_05_19_us_pennsylvania-pastor-glenn-germany-church-safety", "text": "In the years Pastor Glenn Germany has been leading the small congregation at Jesus\u2019 Dwelling Place, keeping the Pennsylvania church\u2019s doors open has been a struggle. Germany, a full-time bus driver and full-time pastor, knows how important this church is to its community. In addition to religious services, the church \u2013 in the North Braddock borough southeast of Pittsburgh \u2013 provides its primarily low and fixed-income congregants with housing advice, domestic violence and mental health awareness programs, and seminars on everything from improving health to credit scores. To keep it all running, Germany and his family give more than $1,000 out of pocket every month. And now, it seems there\u2019s another critical expense, though one this small church hardly could afford: security. It\u2019s been exactly two weeks since an armed intruder walked into Jesus\u2019 Dwelling Place, pointed a gun at Germany\u2019s head and pulled the trigger, the horrific scene captured via a livestream of the Sunday service. When the gunman tried to fire, though, his weapon jammed, giving the pastor and a cameraman enough time to rush and subdue the suspect until authorities came. Police have not shared what may have motivated the gunman to target the pastor. Germany has said the shooter told him \u201cspirits\u201d got into his head. Then less than a week later, parishioners in south Louisiana helped remove a 16-year-old boy who walked into a Catholic church armed with a gun. The two incidents came roughly three months after law enforcement killed a woman who opened fire inside Lakewood Church in Houston; a 57-year-old man and the shooter\u2019s 7-year-old son were wounded. Now, Germany wants to hire security experts to assess his church\u2019s vulnerability and see how they can secure it. But in the two weeks since the thwarted attack, the church has only been able to raise just over $1,000 in donations, the pastor said. Experts told CNN safety additions such as vulnerability assessments, training, cameras and security personnel can cost several thousand dollars. \u201cIt costs money to hire people, and we don\u2019t have the money,\u201d Germany said. It\u2019s a challenge for religious communities across the US as churches, synagogues, mosques and other places of worship face threats or come under attack in a nation with more guns than people and where shots often explode in places that should be safe. US Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer this month announced an additional $400 million in federal money to help boost security at places of worship. Many places of worship have struggled to balance security while maintaining a warm, welcoming feeling for their attendees. And Germany\u2019s challenges highlight just how much harder conversations around security can be for smaller congregations. \u2018Nothing is sacred, secure or safe\u2019 In San Antonio, the faithful at Pastor Kevin Nelson\u2019s Calvary Baptist Church began new conversations around security after the attack on Lakewood Church, the megachurch of famed televangelist Joel Osteen. Nelson\u2019s church already has cameras and an alarm system \u2013 but those were primarily installed to thwart car break-ins, he said. Calvary Baptist, with roughly 300 regular service attendees, also enlists deacons and other church members who carry concealed weapons to monitor the single entrance it keeps open during services, Nelson said. And it hosts active shooter trainings led by the local sheriff\u2019s office. But now, all that doesn\u2019t feel like enough. \u201cI don\u2019t want our church to become almost like a bank, to where you pull up and you see the police, so I\u2019m really wrestling,\u201d Nelson, a former deputy with the sheriff\u2019s department, told CNN. \u201cBut in the same sense, God\u2019s people and God\u2019s house have to be protected.\u201d Not too far away is an ever-persistent reminder of the threat: Calvary Baptist is just about a 40-minute drive from Sutherland Springs, where a shooter killed 26 people inside a community church in 2017.\u00a0It remains the state\u2019s deadliest mass shooting. Nelson\u2019s church is now considering hiring armed guards, he said. Its leaders are also looking into the federal grant money Schumer announced, though it is a new process requiring time and research, Nelson said. And since the Lakewood Church shooting, during which the attacker walked in with her young son and a rifle, churchgoers at Calvary Baptist have been instructed to be watchful of families entering services, he said. \u201cWhat we\u2019re discovering,\u201d Nelson said, \u201cis nothing is sacred, secure or safe.\u201d Donell Trusty Jr., who provides security and firearms training for places of worship in Maryland through his company Trusty Training Solutions, has seen an uptick in phone calls from churches\u00a0since the attempted shooting in Pennsylvania two weeks ago, he said. Trusty, who is also an elder in his Baltimore church, said he also helps churches contract security officers. He also helps train church volunteers who are licensed to carry weapons in firearm safety, self-defense and situational awareness, he told CNN. Typically, Trusty said, hiring security personnel can cost between $35 and $50 per person hourly. Training courses usually cost $250 to $300 per person, he said. To help out local congregations, Trusty\u2019s company has begun offering free active shooter training to places of worship. \u201cIt is our way of giving back to the local assemblies because it\u2019s what\u2019s needed,\u201d he said. \u201cWe understand the financial crises of the pandemic, membership has been low in a lot of churches \u2026 (and) they don\u2019t really have the finances to put out for some expensive training program.\u201d And active shooter training can help save lives. Rabbi Charlie Cytron-Walker has credited his training in this arena for helping him make a daring escape in 2022 after a hostage-taker joined a worship service at Congregation Beth Israel in Texas. As the attack approached its 11th hour, the rabbi spotted a key moment when the gunman\u2019s guard was down \u2013 just as he had learned in training \u2013 and told others to run, then grabbed a chair and threw it at the assailant, giving the hostages enough time to escape with their lives. Churches now should take an opportunity to renew conversations around safety, conduct risk assessments and reevaluate their security procedures, said Bishop Vashti Murphy McKenzie, president and general secretary of the National Council of the Churches of Christ in the USA, which represents more than 100,000 congregations. Among factors to consider are identifying church members with a background in law enforcement, the military or security, McKenzie said. Other key steps include conducting drills, ensuring all church members know where the nearest exit is or where to go during an emergency, and knowing who would contact authorities if needed, McKenzie said. \u201cSurely, we would all love to believe that it\u2019s not going to happen here, it\u2019s not going to be us. But why take the chance? Let\u2019s prepare,\u201d she said. Every year, the Churches of Christ council hosts discussions \u2013 including about security \u2013 for leaders of Jewish, Muslim, Hindu, Christian and other faiths, McKenzie said. In those spaces, she added, religious leaders have an opportunity to \u201ccompare notes\u201d and learn from each other. A difficult balance for many pastors Nelson, in San Antonio, often thinks about nearby smaller congregations that typically don\u2019t have the financial or human resources to bolster security measures in the same way his church can, he said. He encourages churches to station at least one person to monitor each entrance, and he has tried to spread the word about the federal grant program. Schumer, too, noted the additional challenges smaller congregations face. \u201cFEMA has people who will help if you\u2019re a small synagogue or a small church or a small mosque and you don\u2019t have a grant writer, you don\u2019t know what to do,\u201d he said. Schumer\u2019s May 5 news conference followed a series of hoax bomb threats the prior day against New York synagogues, he said. Places of worship that apply for federal money for bolstered security, such as guards and fences, may be able to get those resources within \u201cmonths,\u201d Schumer said, pointing potential grant recipients to the agency\u2019s website and urging them to apply by Tuesday. Florida-based security company SecureTek Service Group Inc. has been helping low-resource places of worship, including Germany\u2019s church, navigate applications for grants and other types of funding, its founder Rico Reed told CNN. Often, churches with little funding don\u2019t know what kinds of resources are available, and security additions can be costly, with vulnerability assessments in some cases reaching up to $2,000, while camera systems can cost several thousand dollars, he said. \u201cA House of Worship is supposed to be a safe place,\u201d Reed said. \u201cBut it\u2019s actually a soft target. And it takes a while for people that are part of the congregation to understand that times have changed. And it\u2019s really dangerous.\u201d In Tennessee, Lori Morrison has long been talking about the importance of church security, on both her website and her podcast. A former private investigator and now a volunteer on her own church\u2019s security team, Morrison said there\u2019s a tough balance between keeping a church secure and welcoming. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to lock the doors and issue passes,\u201d she said. \u201cBut you can take those common sense precautions.\u201d At her church, team members observe people as they arrive, while others check badges in sensitive areas, like the children\u2019s section, to ensure only approved members enter. There are also trainings throughout the year on safety and preparation for medical emergencies, Morrison said. \u201cWe are supposed to look out for (congregants\u2019) well-being, and so we have to make sure that we\u2019re doing that at the same time that we\u2019re maintaining that openness,\u201d she said. In Pennsylvania, Germany admits he worried before the attempted shooting some parishioners would feel uncomfortable with officers around, or added security could make the church less welcoming. But two weeks ago, someone tried to kill him, he said. And he worries it may happen again. Now, his focus is to make his church safe. He hopes to raise more money, get help to apply for grants, and take all the measures necessary to ensure his community can practice its faith in peace. He hopes other churches \u2013 big and small \u2013 do the same. \u201cI would encourage other churches to use our video as just a springboard to start having thoughts about church security,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause you never think it\u2019s going to happen to you \u2013 until it happens to you.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/19/us/pennsylvania-pastor-glenn-germany-church-safety/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/23/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_05_22_economy_fed-minutes-wall-street-inflation", "text": "Earlier this week, some officials at the Federal Reserve said they\u2019re no longer worried about inflation reaccelerating, after data showed that progress stalled in the first quarter. Optimism spurred by the latest inflation data pushed all three major stock indexes to new record highs. But now Wall Street, eager for rate cuts, is on edge again. That\u2019s because minutes from the central bank\u2019s latest policy meeting released Wednesday showed that \u201cvarious\u201d officials said they would be willing to raise interest rates if necessary and that there were doubts as to whether financial conditions are restrictive enough to keep inflation from resurging. It spooked investors: The Dow slid more than 300 points following the release of the minutes. Moreover, the Fed minutes seemed to outweigh comments from Fed Governor Christopher Waller, a key messenger of monetary policy moves, who told CNBC in an interview Tuesday that the Fed could cut rates by the \u201cend of the year.\u201d In a separate speech earlier that day, he said \u201cthe data suggests that inflation isn\u2019t accelerating.\u201d \u201cMore recent data on the economy indicate that restrictive monetary policy is helping to cool off aggregate demand and the inflation data for April suggests that progress toward 2% has likely resumed,\u201d Waller said at an event hosted by the Peterson Institute for International Economics. He pointed to recent figures on employment and retail spending coming in weaker than expected, both of which should help take some steam out of inflation. But some financial leaders remain doubtful that the Fed is feeling confident enough to cut rates soon. Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon said Wednesday at an event hosted by Boston College that the Fed probably won\u2019t begin to cut rates this year. \u201cI\u2019m still at zero cuts,\u201d he said. \u201cI think we\u2019re set up for stickier inflation.\u201d Some Fed officials say another rate hike isn\u2019t likely Fed officials have mostly sounded a little more optimistic about inflation recently, after the Consumer Price Index for April finally provided some welcome news. The inflation report was mostly in line with expectations, which was an improvement from the disappointing figures for the first three months of the year. \u201cIt\u2019s important not to focus too much on just one data point,\u201d said Fed Vice Chair Philip Jefferson at an event hosted by the Mortgage Bankers Association on Monday. However, he noted that the April CPI data was nonetheless \u201ca good sign for us.\u201d San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly told Axios in an interview that published Monday that she doesn\u2019t \u201csee any evidence right now that we need to adjust upwards.\u201d Fed Chair Jerome Powell said earlier this month that it may just be a matter of giving high interest rates some time to kick in. \u201cWhat that has told us is that we\u2019ll need to be patient and let restrictive policy do its work,\u201d he said during a moderated discussion with European Central Bank Governing Council member Klaas Knot. Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester told Bloomberg on Monday that she also thinks interest rates are high enough to deal with inflation. But despite the hopeful Fedspeak on inflation, there is still an uneasiness in the air about what\u2019s really happening and what the central bank will do. \u201cFor now, the Fed says it wants to see more evidence that inflation is easing, which implies higher-for-longer rates until that data materializes,\u201d wrote Chris Larkin, managing director of trading and investing for E*TRADE in a note Wednesday. \u201cTraders will have to wait until next week\u2019s PCE price index to get another read on inflation and update their expectations for rate cuts,\u201d he said. The April Personal Consumption Expenditures price index, the Fed\u2019s preferred inflation gauge, is due next Friday at 8:30 am ET, along with data on household incomes and spending.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/economy/fed-minutes-wall-street-inflation/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/23/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_05_18_us_dali-ship-baltimore-bridge-refloats", "text": "Almost two months after its devastating collision with a Baltimore bridge, the trapped cargo ship Dali will refloat and travel to the Baltimore marine terminal on Monday morning, officials said. After weeks of salvage operations, the Dali can finally be relocated thanks to a\u00a0series of controlled explosions\u00a0which broke apart a massive piece of the Francis Scott Bridge that had been stuck atop the ship\u2019s bow, officials said. An estimated 500-foot section of the bridge weighing 8-12 million pounds was removed from the ship. \u201cThe\u00a0refloat\u00a0and transit sequence is deliberately designed to ensure all response personnel around the M/V Dali maintain control of the vessel, from\u00a0refloat, transit to, and berthing at a local marine terminal,\u201d Unified Command said in a\u00a0news release\u00a0Saturday. Conditions permitting, the massive ship\u2019s journey will begin around 5 a.m. on Monday during peak high tide, according to Unified Command. Crews will begin prepping the ship about 18 hours before \u2013 about midday on Sunday \u2013 to take full advantage of the high tide, officials added. Up to five tugboats will then tow and push the Dali about two and a half miles to the\u00a0Seagirt Marine Terminal in Baltimore, the release said. It will take an estimated three hours to transport the 984-foot, 106,000-ton ship. Maryland Gov. Wes Moore said Sunday he expects to have the channel reopened by the end of the month. \u201cI\u2019m proud that we\u2019re on track that by the end of May we\u2019ll have that federal channel reopened,\u201d Moore said on NBC\u2019s Meet the Press. \u201cAnd within days, we\u2019re going to have that massive vessel, the\u00a0Dali, out of that federal channel.\u201d The cargo ship collided with the bridge in the early hours of March 26, killing six maintenance workers and causing most of the structure to collapse into the Patapsco River. The disaster shut down most shipping to and from the Port of Baltimore. The crash has prompted multiple investigations, including by the FBI and the US Coast Guard. The ship\u2019s 21-member crew has remained onboard since the collapse, including during the planned explosions on May 13. The ship\u2019s management company told CNN this week the crew will remain on the vessel for \u201cthe foreseeable future.\u201d According to Barbara Shipley, mid-Atlantic labor representative for the International Transport Workers\u2019 Federation, there is no plan for what the crew will do once the Dali is escorted back to port on Monday. She said the crew\u2019s visas have all expired and the union is waiting for direction from immigration authorities to figure out next steps. She told CNN the crew members are trying to keep their spirits high despite being disconnected from their friends and families. The FBI confiscated the men\u2019s cell phones as part of their ongoing investigation. \u201cIt\u2019s been since April 15, they still haven\u2019t received their cell phones,\u201d Shipley said. \u201cNo one has received their cell phones, they did receive some SIM cards, but not all.\u201d Shipley said her priority \u201cwould be to have the decisions made quickly, which crew members will need to stay behind, and\u00a0which crew members can go home, and it\u2019s important to get these gentlemen back home to their families,\u201d Shipley said. \u201cAs far as I know, no one\u2019s been charged with anything and we\u2019re holding them. They can\u2019t go home because they\u2019re still under investigation.

Union City Police arrested Atlanta police officer Koby Minor Wednesday, according to a news release from the Atlanta Police Department. Minor resigned from the department later that day. Minor was charged with murder and aggravated assault after shooting his Lyft driver, a release from the Union City Police Department said. The Lyft driver was identified by authorities as Reginald Folks and was pronounced dead at the scene. The affidavit said he was shot in the head. \u201cOur hearts are with Mr. Folks\u2019 loved ones as they confront this unspeakable tragedy, and we have reached out to offer our support during this difficult time,\u201d Lyft said in a statement shared with CNN. \u201cWe stand ready to assist law enforcement with any investigation and have permanently banned the rider\u2019s account from the Lyft community.\u201d A passerby who saw Minor waving his hand on the side of Stonewall Tell Road in Union City called police, the affidavit said. Minor told the passerby he believed he was getting kidnapped by Folks, according to the affidavit. Minor recounted to police he had gotten in the Lyft after leaving another police officer\u2019s home that evening. He told officers Folks was talking on the phone through his car\u2019s Bluetooth in an unknown language and Minor said he \u201cheard what he thought was another voice in his ear talking to him but did not say what the voice said.\u201d Minor told police he then asked Folks to stop the car but he continued to drive. When they came to a red light, Minor tried to unlock and open the door but he could not get the door open. He then added Folks turned around and attempted to reach in the back seat, which is when Minor shot him. He fired approximately three shots, broke the window of the vehicle, and exited. Minor is being held in Fulton County Jail. CNN has been unable to determine if Minor has obtained legal representation. The Atlanta Police Department hired Minor in 2018 and was on unpaid administrative leave during the time of his arrest this week, the department statement said.

A successful antritrust case could potentially lead to sweeping changes in the market for live events \u2013 an industry that came under intense scrutiny in 2022 after glitches at Ticketmaster blocked millions from purchasing tickets for Taylor Swift\u2019s \u201cEras\u201d tour. For many critics of Live Nation, the Swift debacle revealed how a lack of competition has led to harms ranging from poor customer service to confusing pricing to expensive ticketing fees to restrictions on ticket resales \u2014 amounting to what many consumers complain of as death by a thousand cuts. The fiasco led lawmakers to grill a top executive of Ticketmaster\u2019s parent company, Live Nation Entertainment, in January last year over the company\u2019s practices. During the three-hour hearing, senators pressed Live Nation president and CFO Joe Berchtold and some other witnesses on whether his company was too dominant in the industry, thereby harming rivals, musicians and fans. \u201cI want to congratulate and thank you for an absolutely stunning achievement,\u201d Sen. Richard Blumenthal said to Berchtold. \u201cYou have brought together Republicans and Democrats in an absolutely unified cause.\u201d Nor are music fans and lawmakers the only ones to criticize Live Nation over the years \u2013 plenty of musicians and other pop culture figures have as well. Country star Zach Bryan dropped a surprise album at the end of 2022 titled, \u201cAll My Homies Hate Ticketmaster (Live at Red Rocks).\u201d In the\u00a0social media post\u00a0announcing the album on Christmas Eve, Bryan wrote that it \u201cseems there is a massive issue with fair ticket prices to live shows lately.\u201d Even the long-running animated show \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d has piled on, with rapacious capitalist Mr. Burns sneering in one episode to his lackey Mr. Smithers: \u201cYou laughed when I bought Ticketmaster. \u2018No one\u2019s going to pay a hundred percent service charge.\u2019\u201d This article has been updated with additional context.

Severe turbulence One person was killed and at least 71 others were injured on board a Singapore Airlines plane that encountered severe turbulence on a flight from London to Singapore. The flight carrying 229 people was cruising at 37,000 feet when flight tracking data shows the plane rapidly plunged before climbing several hundred feet, then repeated the dip and ascent, for about 90 seconds. Images from the aircraft afterward show the cabin in disarray, with papers, cups, and pitchers scattered on the floor and ceiling panels hanging loose. Meteorologists say the plane likely encountered rapidly developing thunderstorms over Myanmar when the extreme turbulence was reported. 2. Middle East Norway, Spain and Ireland announced plans to formally recognize a Palestinian state, calling the move an \u201cimportant step\u201d toward \u201cpeace\u201d in the region. \u201cIn the midst of a war, with tens of thousands killed and injured, we must keep alive the only alternative that offers a political solution for Israelis and Palestinians alike: Two states, living side by side, in peace and security,\u201d Norway\u2019s Prime Minister Jonas Gahr St\u00f8re said. The landmark decision by three key European players sparked swift condemnation from Israel, with a senior lawmaker ordering the immediate recall of Israeli ambassadors to Ireland and Norway. Meanwhile, in Iran, funeral ceremonies continue today for the late President Ebrahim Raisi after he died in a helicopter crash. 3. Tornadoes Powerful tornadoes tracked across western Iowa on Tuesday, causing multiple fatalities and major damage in the small city of Greenfield \u2014 about 50 miles southwest of Des Moines. \u201cThere is basically nothing left,\u201d Clel Baudler, a former Iowa state representative who lives near Greenfield, told CNN. Around 20 tornado reports were generated in Iowa in the last 24 hours \u2014 part of a parade of storms marching across the US that left nearly 200,000 homes and businesses in the dark as of Tuesday night. Even more outages are anticipated as the storm system rolls through a 1,500-mile expanse from Texas to western Vermont today. 4. Georgia elections Fani Willis, the Fulton County district attorney who is prosecuting former President Donald Trump, is projected to win her election in Georgia. The 2020 election interference case in the state was sidetracked for months over whether Willis should be disqualified following revelations that she had a romantic relationship with her lead prosecutor, Nathan Wade. Also in Georgia, Judge Scott McAfee \u2014 who is overseeing the former president\u2019s case \u2014 is projected to win his nonpartisan election for Fulton County Superior Court. McAfee has recently faced criticism from conservatives over his handling of the decision not to remove Willis from the prosecution when details of her romantic relationship with Wade emerged. 5. Space weapons The US has assessed that Russia likely launched a counter space weapon last week that is close to, and capable of attacking, a US government satellite orbiting nearby. It is not the first time Russia has launched a counter space weapon, which is designed to incapacitate or destroy satellites. But the last time it did so was in 2022, US Ambassador Robert Wood said. The launch comes at a time when the US and its allies are increasingly concerned about Russia\u2019s efforts to develop a nuclear space weapon. If deployed, such a weapon could potentially cripple a vast swath of the commercial and government satellites that the world below depends on to make cell phone calls, pay bills, and surf the internet.

{"id": "2024_05_22_politics_trump-documents-case-judge-cannon-hearing", "text": "During a marathon day of proceedings in the Mar-a-Lago classified documents case, a morning hearing in front of Judge Aileen Cannon devolved into a shouting match amongst the attorneys, and the afternoon series of arguments prompted the judge to wonder if the legal nuances of the case may be too difficult for jurors to understand. The heated arguments played out in a morning proceeding in Fort Pierce, Florida, that had been scheduled for Walt Nauta, one of former President Donald Trump\u2019s co-defendants, to present arguments that special counsel Jack Smith\u2019s team had selectively and vindictively brought charges against him. But the hearing quickly diverted into a longstanding disagreement over an August 2022 meeting between prosecutor Jay Bratt and Nauta\u2019s defense attorney, Stanley Woodward. Woodward has claimed in court proceedings and filings that Bratt attempted to pressure him into convincing Nauta to cooperate against Trump by threatening to affect a potential judgeship nomination. Cannon did not issue a ruling from the bench on Nauta\u2019s motion that the case be dismissed on those grounds. Nor did Cannon rule on a motion she heard during an afternoon session Wednesday, brought by all three of the case\u2019s defendants, who claimed that the indictment suffers technical flaws that required the dismissal of the charges. Cannon seemed skeptical of those arguments, while also expressing concern about a jury\u2019s ability to understand legal nuances in the case at a future trial. \u201cReal people have to decide these issues,\u201d Cannon said. Prosecutor says defense attorney was making \u2018garbage argument\u2019 Nauta claims that he was criminally charged in the case as retaliation for declining to cooperate with the Justice Department\u2019s investigation into the former president\u2019s retention of classified documents at his estate. \u201cI had been recommended for a judgeship, that\u2019s beyond dispute,\u201d Woodward said Wednesday. \u201cThere was a folder about defense counsel on the table\u201d during that meeting, he said, claiming Bratt referenced that judgeship recommendation. \u201cI think the implication was that I was to travel and convince Mr. Nauta to cooperate with the investigation, and if I didn\u2019t that, there would be consequences,\u201d Woodward said. Prosecutor David Harbach then rose and accused Woodward of engaging in \u201cprocedural gamesmanship\u201d by making a \u201cgarbage argument\u201d about the meeting. \u201cMr. Woodward\u2019s story of what happened at that meeting is a fantasy,\u201d Harbach shouted, banging his hand on the lectern in front of him. \u201cIt did not happen.\u201d The heated proceedings Wednesday come as the Manhattan\u00a0hush money case\u00a0against Trump nears its conclusion and a new phase of pretrial activity gets underway in the\u00a0federal classified documents prosecution in Florida. The hearing was the first before Cannon since she indefinitely delayed the start of the trial, which had been scheduled to begin as early as this week. It has been more than a month since the judge last held a public, in-person hearing in the case \u2013 though she has held at least one sealed proceeding since then. Trump is charged with taking classified national defense documents from the White House after he left office and of resisting the government\u2019s attempts to retrieve the materials. Trump, Nauta and Mar-a-Lago property manager Carlos De Oliveira have all pleaded\u00a0not guilty. During Wednesday\u2019s hearing, Harbach slammed Woodward, saying he chose not to report the alleged incident until months later and has repeatedly changed his recollection of the conversation. \u201cThis is a lawyer whose allegations amount basically to him being extorted,\u201d Harbach said of Woodward, waving his arms. Woodward sat behind the prosecutor with his hands clasped and his head down. The judge quickly scolded Harbach, telling the attorney to \u201ccalm down.\u201d Cannon questioned why there was no evidence gathered of what happened in the 2022 conversation, saying, \u201cWhy do those comments [about Woodward] have to be made?\u201d \u201cThat is not true, and I didn\u2019t say that,\u201d Harbach shouted back. The prosecutor said that that there was no recording of the conversation between Bratt and Woodward, but that Smith\u2019s team has preserved any record they have of the meeting. Woodward shot back up to the lectern, saying that \u201cI\u2019m here\u201d and offering to testify under oath to what he remembered of the meeting. Nauta\u2019s request to dismiss the case was the first of two issues before Cannon on Wednesday. An afternoon hearing will center on co-defendants\u2019\u00a0argument the indictment suffers technical flaws requiring its dismissal. Trump had obtained permission from the judge\u00a0to skip Wednesday\u2019s proceedings. Cannon says that jury may struggle to understand charges When postponing the trial,\u00a0Cannon pointed to the mountain of unresolved pretrial issues for not putting a new date on the calendar. Wednesday kicks off a stretch of hearings scheduled through late July that will get the case through some \u2013 but not all \u2013 of the pretrial issues. During the afternoon portion of Wednesday\u2019s arguments, the defense lawyers raised concerns about how prosecutors structured the indictment, claiming that the wording for different charges within the same indictment sometimes sounded the same. Prosecutor Jay Bratt said the charges reference different parts of the obstruction statute used to charge Trump and two of his employees. Bratt also pointed out that jurors would be given clear instructions about the charges during a trial. Cannon said that while \u201cit\u2019s going to be hard for someone to detect what\u2019s different in these counts,\u201d\u00a0she noted \u201cthat will be a project\u201d down the road. Cannon has not yet set a trial date in the case after indefinitely postponing it in an order earlier this month. The Florida judge spent hours Wednesday entertaining theories from defense attorneys about what they say were problems in the investigation and prosecution of the former president, Nauta and the third co-defendant, Carlos De Oliveira. The defense theories\u00a0ranged from allegations that prosecutors tried to extort Nauta\u2019s attorney to claims prosecutors used inappropriate and\u00a0\u201cattention-grabbing\u201d descriptions of Mar-a-Lago in the indictment. Cannon ultimately suggested that the \u201cpotpourri of criticisms\u201d from the three defense teams may be best suited for a jury to decide at an eventual trial. Several legal issues have still gone unresolved, including at least five motions to dismiss the criminal case. Cannon has repeatedly suggested that\u00a0various legal issues could be punted down the road and handled closer to trial. Cannon\u2019s slow pace in the case\u00a0has attracted criticisms from outside legal experts, who have accused the Trump-appointed\u00a0judge of playing into delay tactics by the GOP\u2019s presumptive\u00a0White House nominee. Unless Cannon picks up her momentum considerably, it appears unlikely the charges will go before a jury before the 2024 election. If Trump wins the White House, it is expected he will make the charges against him go\u00a0away. Newly unsealed filings give more details about the investigation Until recent days, several major motions from Trump attacking the prosecution were not even publicly docketed. The proceedings have become mired in disputes over what should be redacted in public filings. On Tuesday, hundreds of pages of previously sealed court filings were posted publicly as part of efforts by the former president to have the charges against him thrown out. Those filings included a previously sealed March 2023 ruling by a federal judge in Washington, DC, finding there was \u201csufficient\u201d evidence that Trump committed crimes, allowing investigators to obtain information from his former lawyer that would normally be protected by attorney-client privilege. Trump is seeking to throw out that evidence, as well as the evidence obtained in the FBI\u2019s search of Mar-a-Lago in August 2022, from which investigators obtained many of the documents underlying several of the charges against Trump. Those motions are not scheduled for argument on Wednesday, and Cannon has not yet set a hearing on them. In her order Sunday allowing for the filings to be made public, Cannon took a shot at prosecutors \u2013 one of several swipes she\u2019s made at Smith\u2019s office. She expressed \u201cconcern\u201d the special counsel\u2019s office had sought redactions of information in the newly unsealed filings after previously giving its OK for that information to be published in full in earlier court filings. \u201cThe Court is disappointed in these developments. The sealing and redaction rules should be applied consistently and fairly upon a sufficient factual and legal showing,\u201d Cannon wrote. \u201cAnd parties should not make requests that undermine any prior representations or positions except upon full disclosure to the Court and appropriate briefing.\u201d This headline and story have been updated with additional developments.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/politics/trump-documents-case-judge-cannon-hearing/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/23/2024", "section": "us"}}

Rick Scott\u00a0announced\u00a0his bid to be the next Senate GOP leader on Wednesday, putting him in a three-way secret ballot race that will be decided after the November elections. Scott has been a longtime supporter of former President Donald Trump and has maintained an icy relationship with GOP leadership in the Senate, including with outgoing Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell, whose leadership position he is again gunning for after losing a long-shot bid to replace the Kentucky Republican in 2022. Scott, a first-term senator, would be considered an underdog in the race, which includes GOP Sens. John Thune, the minority whip, and John Cornyn, a former whip.

On Wednesday night, Scott told Fox News host Laura Ingraham that he had spoken to Trump earlier in the day about the need for change in the chamber, adding that the former president was \u201cexcited I\u2019m\u00a0getting into the race.\u201d \u201cI am a change agent.\u00a0I was a change agent in\u00a0business.\u00a0I did turn arounds.\u00a0I changed Florida,\u201d Scott said.\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019re going to change the\u00a0Senate.\u00a0We\u2019re going to be the Senate\u00a0that helps Donald Trump get his\u00a0conservative agenda done.\u201d Scott has long been a close Trump ally and quickly endorsed the former president over his home-state governor, Ron DeSantis, for president last year. He was one of several Republican senators who objected to the certification of 2020 election results and has been a constant defender of Trump in the face of his legal troubles. A former CEO of an embattled health care company, Scott has used his wealth to help fund his campaigns, serving two terms as the governor of Florida before his election to the Senate in 2018. He\u2019s facing reelection this year in a red-trending state that Democrats hope to put in play. Scott, then the chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, became a pariah to some in his own party in 2022, when he released a proposal that would have sunset all federal programs in five years unless Congress extended them. Even McConnell quickly disavowed the plan, while Democrats pounced on it as a way to accuse Republicans of attempting to undercut popular programs like Social Security and Medicare. Months later, Scott walked back major sections of that plan to shield many of those popular programs \u2014 like Social Security and Medicare \u2014 from being sunset. Though, Democrats looking to turn his Senate seat blue in 2024 have continued to hit Scott on that unpopular proposal. This story has been updated with additional details.

{"id": "2024_05_22_us_uvalde-school-district-police-chief-resignation", "text": "The chief of police for Uvalde schools has submitted his resignation more than a year after he replaced the man who held the position during the 2022 school massacre in the Texas city, according to a school official\u2019s statement obtained by CNN affiliate KSAT Tuesday. The resignation of Joshua Gutierrez, chief of police for the Uvalde Consolidated Independent School District, will be presented for approval at a June 17 school board meeting, according to district spokesperson Anne Marie Espinoza. If approved, his last day will be June 26, according to the KSAT report. Details about the reasons for the resignation weren\u2019t immediately available. CNN has sought comment from Gutierrez and the school district. \u201cWe thank Chief Gutierrez for his dedicated leadership and guidance in reestablishing the Uvalde CISD Police Department,\u201d Espinoza said in the statement. \u201cHis contributions have been instrumental in enhancing the safety and well-being of our students, staff, and school community.\u201d Gutierrez replaced Pete Arredondo, who was fired in August 2022 following scrutiny of his actions during the May 2022 shooting in which 19 students and two teachers were killed at Robb Elementary School. Law enforcement officers waited more than an hour before entering adjoining classrooms where the gunman was and killing him. A US Department of Justice report said officers had many opportunities to intervene to stop the bloodshed far earlier. Arredondo was\u00a0seen on police body-worn cameras\u00a0giving orders and receiving information during the response, but he has said he did not see himself as the incident commander. Gutierrez was approved unanimously as the interim police chief in November 2022, and was named\u00a0permanent\u00a0chief in March 2023. \u201cThis is our first step (we are) taking to rebuild our school district police force,\u201d Gary Patterson, then the interim superintendent, said when Gutierrez was named interim chief. As interim police chief, Gutierrez focused on hiring qualified officers, conducting tactical cross-training with local law enforcement and engaging students and the community, according to KSAT, which reported he\u2019d previously worked at several other school districts. \u201cI have the ability to come out here and help the community heal, help our community heal, and the abilities to reestablish a good foundation for our police department,\u201d Gutierrez said in December 2022, according to KSAT. The district has begun a search to replace Gutierrez and has posted the job on its website. \u201cUnder general supervision, this officer performs tasks related to ensuring the safety of UCISD students, staff, and visitors,\u201d the posting says. \u201cAdditionally, the officer provides classroom presentations, counsels students and parents, engages students through mentoring, and serves as a positive role model to help promote healthy relationships between youth and law enforcement.\u201d Among the requirements for the position, the district is looking for someone with a minimum of five years of senior level experience directing law enforcement operations, according to the posting. A candidate should have the \u201cability to effectively deal with personal danger which may include sudden exposure to armed persons,\u201d the posting says. \u201cWe are committed to finding a successor who will continue to uphold the standards of safety and security that our school community deserves,\u201d Espinoza said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/us/uvalde-school-district-police-chief-resignation/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/23/2024", "section": "us"}}
