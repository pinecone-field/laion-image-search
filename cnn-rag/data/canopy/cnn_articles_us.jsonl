{"id": "2024_07_10_us_dwight-jackson-employment-discrimination-lawsuit-reaj", "text": "A Black man has filed an employment discrimination lawsuit against a hotel in Detroit, Michigan, alleging the hotel only offered him a job interview after he changed the name on his resume, according to a copy of the lawsuit obtained by CNN. Dwight Jackson filed the lawsuit against the Shinola Hotel on July 3, alleging he was denied a job when he applied as \u201cDwight Jackson,\u201d but later offered an interview when he changed his name to \u201cJohn Jebrowski.\u201d The lawsuit alleges Jackson was denied a job in \u201cviolation of Michigan Elliott Larsen Civil Rights Act.\u201d Between January and April 2024, Jackson, a 27-year-old Black man, applied to multiple positions at the Shinola Hotel in downtown Detroit, including a role in reception, according to the lawsuit. On its website, Shinola Hotel says it is a \u201cluxury\u201d hotel. Jackson\u2019s attorney, Jon Marko, provided CNN with a copy of Jackson\u2019s resume, which details consistent employment, including previous roles as a \u201cFront Desk Agent\u201d at Detroit\u2019s Marriott Westin Book Cadillac and David Whitney Hotel, which use the words luxury and luxurious to describe their respective hotels. \u201cMr. Jackson had applied for a job that he was eminently qualified for,\u201d Marko, a civil rights attorney, told CNN. However, Shinola Hotel did not offer Jackson an interview. After getting no response to his initial job applications, in April 2024 Jackson applied again, making one significant change to his application \u2014 his name. According to the lawsuit, Jackson applied to Shinola Hotel \u201ctwice for similar positions under a more readily apparent Caucasian name, with the alias \u2018John Jebrowski,\u2019\u201d using nearly identical resumes. The resumes have different dates of previous employment. He was offered multiple interviews within the same week, the lawsuit claims. The lawsuit alleges that \u201cJackson established that the Defendant\u2019s consideration of candidates was based on the racial appearance of the applicant\u2019s name.\u201d \u201cTo be denied a job in 2024 in your hometown, for the color of your skin, goes beyond dollars and cents. It goes into the psyche of a person,\u201d Marko said. Sage Hospitality Group is Shinola Hotel\u2019s operating partner. Anna Stancioff, Sage Hospitality\u2019s Senior Corporate Director of PR & Brand Communications and spokesperson for the hotel said in an email Tuesday, \u201cWe take this allegation very seriously and do not tolerate discrimination of any kind. We are committed to fostering an inclusive workplace where everyone has the opportunity to succeed and are dedicated to building a diverse workforce that reflects the community.\u201d According to Marko, Jackson attended the job interview and confronted the interviewer at Shinola Hotel. He revealed his real identity and expressed his belief that he was not given an interview initially because his name appeared more traditionally African American. \u201cShortly after Jackson underwent the interview process, he was informed that he was no longer a viable candidate for the position,\u201d the lawsuit states. Marko said employment discrimination is not unusual. He added, as a civil rights attorney, \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a lot of discrimination in hiring, especially when it comes to the exclusion of minorities and individuals who have minority-sounding names.\u201d A recent\u00a0study published by the National Bureau of Economic Research\u00a0found that name bias is a prevalent issue in the hiring process. Researchers sent out identical resumes to 108 U.S. employers to analyze whether race and gender affected callback rates for job applications. Resumes with Black male and Black female names received the fewest callbacks. But, Marko said, proving cases of name bias is extremely challenging and most of these cases never get off the ground due to a lack of evidence. Jackson\u2019s case is different, he said, because he applied twice for similar positions with nearly the exact same resume and it yielded different results when he used the alias. Marko said Jackson \u201cwants to shed light on this problem that\u2019s not just isolated at the Shinola Hotel, not just isolated in Detroit or Michigan, but across the country. He wants to make sure that it doesn\u2019t happen to anyone else.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/10/us/dwight-jackson-employment-discrimination-lawsuit-reaj/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/15/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_07_14_us_texas-houston-hurricane-beryl-damage", "text": "Texas Gov. Greg Abbott threatened to issue an executive order forcing electricity provider CenterPoint Energy to improve the reliability of its equipment and its level of storm preparedness if the company fails to address his concerns in the wake of Hurricane Beryl. If CenterPoint does not comply with his request or provide sufficient information by July 31, he would \u201cimpose my own requirements on CenterPoint that are geared to keep power on through hurricane season until the next legislative session,\u201d Abbott said at a Sunday news conference. Power was knocked out in Houston and areas along the Texas Gulf Coast in the wake of Category 1 Hurricane Beryl last Monday and thousands are still waiting for power to be restored nearly a week later. People in southeast Texas have endured several days of hot weather without air conditioning as many look for safe drinking water, food and cool shelters, CNN previously reported. The governor called power companies\u2019 failure to provide their customers with power \u201ccompletely unacceptable.\u201d The governor singled out CenterPoint as having \u201crepeatedly failed to deliver power to customers for extended periods,\u201d and said he planned to send a letter to Public Utilities Commission chairman Thomas Gleason requiring the commission to investigate the reasons for CenterPoint\u2019s failures and how to fix the issues. \u201cI will work with legislators to craft laws to improve power reliability, but, and here\u2019s the important part, we are still in hurricane season right now, and solutions cannot wait until the next session,\u201d Abbott said. \u201cThey are needed now to minimize power disruptions as we respond to tropical weather for the remainder of the summer and this fall, to help avoid more power outages during the remainder of hurricane season.\u201d \u201cAlso, if CenterPoint does not comply, I will demand that the Public Utilities Commission reject CenterPoint\u2019s request to recover a profit and pending request before the public utilities commission,\u201d the governor added. Abbott also noted the utility admitted many of the outages caused by the hurricane were related to trees falling on power lines. \u201cCenterPoint is responsible for eliminating the vegetation before a hurricane hits,\u201d Abbott said. \u201cSome reports show that CenterPoint spends far less per customer on vegetation removal than some other power providers.\u201d The governor demanded the utility company eliminate all vegetation issues by the end of August. Abbott also noted the company claimed to have assembled thousands of additional lineman and other personnel to speed up the recovery process. However, he said some reports said many of those workers were slow to respond for various reasons. \u201cOne was training workers after the hurricane hit, rather than training those workers before the hurricane hit,\u201d Abbott said. \u201cAnother was positioning workers days after the hurricane was gone, rather than positioning those workers immediately after the hurricane left.\u201d He said the commission could reconsider the size of CenterPoint\u2019s territorial region if the company can\u2019t fix its ongoing issues. \u201cMaybe they have too large of an area for them to be able to manage adequately. It\u2019s time to reevaluate whether or not CenterPoint should have such a large territory,\u201d Abbott said. Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick also criticized the utility company at Sunday\u2019s news conference, saying the jobs of any CenterPoint employee, \u201cwhether you\u2019re at the top or any part of management who oversaw this response or preparation,\u201d would be on the line. \u201cI know everyone at CenterPoint who\u2019s in an air-conditioned office is watching; a freight train\u2019s coming. You just heard it. You better be prepared,\u201d Patrick said.\u00a0\u201cWe will not and cannot tolerate this.\u201d The utility company had more than 383,000 customers without electricity and more than 433,000 in total without power across Texas on Sunday, according to PowerOutage.us. In a statement on Sunday, CenterPoint Energy said it had restored power for more than 1.8 million customers impacted by Beryl and expected to have electricity back on for 90% of impacted customers by the end of the day Monday. The Texas power grid was also a focal point in February 2021, after a massive statewide outage during a deep freeze left more than 200 people dead and millions without heat and power for days. The state\u2019s government has worked with local officials over the last week to provide ready-to-eat meals for people who have lost electricity in their homes, Abbott said. Officials are also working to ensure people have adequate water supplies and ice, and are addressing the ongoing medical needs at hospitals and health care facilities, according to the governor. \u201cMeals have been lost because people have not had the power on in their house or apartment, and as a result, their food has spoiled \u2026 because of lack of power,\u201d he said. \u201cThe lack of power is because of CenterPoint.\u201d CNN\u2019s Dalia Faheid\u00a0and\u00a0Taylor Galgano contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/14/us/texas-houston-hurricane-beryl-damage/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/15/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_07_09_us_dvontaye-mitchell-milwaukee-death", "text": "The death of a Black man after he was pinned to the ground by security guards at a Wisconsin hotel last month\u00a0is being investigated as a homicide, as members of his family\u00a0and their attorneys on Wednesday called for criminal charges and marched to the hotel in protest of the fatal encounter that was partly captured on video. D\u2019Vontaye Mitchell, 43, was at the downtown Hyatt Regency in Milwaukee on June 30, when police allege he \u201ccaused a disturbance,\u201d prompting security guards to escort him out of the hotel, a statement from Mitchell family attorney Ben Crump said. Part of a video posted on social media shows security guards and others pinning Mitchell to the ground. Mitchell can be heard grunting and pleading with the guards, repeatedly saying \u201cplease\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d One of the guards, who appears to be White, can be heard saying \u201cstay down,\u201d and \u201cstop fighting,\u201d as the others, who appear to be people of color, hold Mitchell down, the video shows. The same guard is heard calling out to witnesses, \u201cThis is what happens when you go into the ladies room.\u201d At a news conference Wednesday, Crump and other attorneys for Mitchell\u2019s family described what they said were portions of bystander and hotel security footage that showed Mitchell running away from security, later being shoved to the ground outside, where he was held down, beaten and kicked. CNN has not seen the footage. \u201cThis was outrageous and one of the most disgusting things that I\u2019ve seen in 15 years of practice as an attorney,\u201d said William Sulton, who is also representing the family. Mitchell\u2019s family planned to hold a candlelight vigil outside the hotel Wednesday evening. \u201cTo see him go out this world the way he did, that was devastating. That would never leave my mind, that\u2019s going to live with me for the rest of my life,\u201d Mitchell\u2019s mother, Brenda Giles, told reporters Wednesday. It\u2019s unclear what led up to Mitchell\u2019s encounter with the security guards, how long it took police officers to arrive on the scene, and what Mitchell was doing at the hotel. When officers arrived, Mitchell was unresponsive and pronounced dead despite lifesaving measures, Milwaukee Police told CNN on Tuesday without mentioning Mitchell by name. Crump said his office had obtained an affidavit from an unidentified hotel employee who claimed he reluctantly helped hold down Mitchell after being ordered to do so by a security guard. Crump said he would turn the document over to prosecutors but did not release it publicly. The local prosecutor is investigating Mitchell\u2019s death as a homicide, he said. \u201cMr. Mitchell\u2019s death is a tragedy, and we extend our deepest condolences to his family,\u201d said Milwaukee County District Attorney John Chisholm said in a statement Wednesday. Prosecutors met and briefed an attorney for Mitchell\u2019s family on the investigation and shared video footage and other evidence,\u00a0Chisholm said. Prosecutors were awaiting full autopsy results that Chisholm said will \u201callow our office to comprehensively evaluate the actions leading up to Mr. Mitchell\u2019s death from the perspective of potential criminal liability.\u201d \u201cAll aspects of these actions, including Mr. Mitchell\u2019s death and the use of force by hotel personnel, will be closely examined,\u201d Chisholm said. The preliminary manner of death for Mitchell is homicide, Karen Domagalski from the Milwaukee County Medical Examiner\u2019s Office told CNN on Tuesday, but the final manner is yet to be determined. \u201cThe cause and manner of death is pending toxicology and further investigation, Domagalski said. \u201cWe do not have a timeline for when this case will be finalized.\u201d The encounter comes as the use of force\u00a0\u2013 particularly\u00a0against people of color\u00a0\u2013\u00a0by police and others in authority roles remains under scrutiny nearly four years after protests flared nationwide following the murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer. Now, every time Mitchell\u2019s children turn on the TV, they are reminded of how their father died, DeAsia Harmon, Mitchell\u2019s widow, told CNN affiliate WTMJ on Monday. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t even go into the grocery store with my daughter without her being afraid of the security standing at the door,\u201d Harmon said. \u201cShe said, \u2018is all security bad or just the ones who murdered my dad.\u2019\u201d The security guards involved in the incident have been suspended. Aimbridge Hospitality, which operates the downtown Hyatt Regency Milwaukee, is still completing its investigation, a Hyatt spokesperson told CNN on Monday. \u201cWe extend our heartfelt condolences to D\u2019Vontaye Mitchell\u2019s family, all those who knew and loved him, and the Milwaukee community in light of this tragedy,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cAs the investigation continues, Hyatt is fully committed to supporting efforts to help ensure accountability for the circumstances that led to the death of D\u2019Vontaye Mitchell.\u201d In a statement Wednesday, Hyatt said it joined Mitchell\u2019s family \u201cin their calls for transparency, accountability and justice for this senseless tragedy.\u201d \u201cWe believe that the employees of Aimbridge Hospitality who were involved should be terminated and that criminal charges should be filed,\u201d the company said. Milwaukee Police are not considering the incident as a criminal investigation because there isn\u2019t any evidence of \u201cblunt force,\u201d according to Crump. \u201cIt is unacceptable that this case is not being considered a criminal investigation despite the fatal outcome, which the medical examiner considers a homicide,\u201d Crump said in a statement Wednesday. There\u2019s no timeline for a charging decision at the moment, the Milwaukee\u00a0County\u00a0District Attorney\u2019s office told CNN on Tuesday. \u2018To know him is to love him\u2019 Giles said her eldest son was a jolly and outgoing brother, uncle and father who loved his family, she told WTMJ. \u201cEverybody that knows him, to know him is to love him, they know,\u201d his sister, Nayisha Mitchell, told the station. \u201cThey knew he was a good person.\u201d Mitchell loved music and art, his mother told reporters Wednesday. He loved walking and cooking. \u201cHe loved to dance, and he was harmless. I always called him my big teddy bear,\u201d Giles said. When Mitchell\u2019s father passed away in 2016, Mitchell fell into depression, his family told WTMJ. Giles believes her son was suffering from a mental health episode at the time of the incident, according to Crump. Shawn Moore, a witness who recorded parts of the interaction, told WTMJ he wishes he had done more. \u201cWhat I ended up capturing was another Black man in Milwaukee dealing with mental issues losing his life over nothing,\u201d he said. Family and friends held a vigil for Mitchell over the weekend outside the downtown Hyatt Regency echoing similar sentiments of calls for justice.

Those security guards initially were suspended as Aimbridge Hospitality completed its investigation, a Hyatt spokesperson told CNN on Monday. Police have referred four charges of felony murder in Mitchell\u2019s death, a police spokesperson told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. Police have been in consultation with the Milwaukee County District Attorney\u2019s Office since July 5 and have subsequently referred the charges but the DA\u2019s office has not yet made a decision, Sgt. Efrain Cornejo told the Journal Sentinel. CNN has reached out to the Milwaukee Police\u00a0Department and the DA\u2019s office for additional information. Mitchell, 43, was at the Hyatt Regency on June 30, when police allege he \u201ccaused a disturbance,\u201d prompting security guards to escort him out of the hotel,\u00a0according to a statement\u00a0from civil rights attorney Ben Crump, who represents the Mitchell family.

During Mitchell\u2019s funeral Thursday, family members approached the lectern to honor his life while reminiscing on shared memories and what they loved about him \u2013 while continuing to push for justice in his name. Mitchell was known for his creativity in the kitchen and was a lover of anything artistic, according to his obituary, which was read during Thursday\u2019s funeral. \u201cD\u2019Vontaye was an avid family man who filled his time visiting his kids and family, and he lit up every face with joy when he entered the room,\u201d it continued. The Rev. Al Sharpton delivered a eulogy in which he offered to pay for Mitchell\u2019s funeral before pledging $5,000 to each of Mitchell\u2019s children for their education. \u201cI want them (Mitchell\u2019s children) to know I, and people, will tell you later in life about your daddy, but I want you to know your daddy was somebody,\u201d Sharpton said. While Sharpton said the firing of hotel employees was a good move, it\u2019s not enough to bring justice for Mitchell\u2019s loved ones. \u201cI thought after George Floyd and we fought till three cops went to jail, I thought y\u2019all learned you can\u2019t put your knees on our necks,\u201d Sharpton said. A homicide investigation is underway Hyatt has joined Mitchell\u2019s family \u201cin their calls for transparency, accountability and justice for this senseless tragedy,\u201d the hotel chain said Wednesday, adding criminal charges should be filed against the Aimbridge Hospitality employees involved.

The FBI named Crooks in a statement early Sunday morning, identifying him as a resident of\u00a0Bethel Park, Pennsylvania \u2013 about 35 miles south of Butler, where Trump was holding his rally. Crooks fired on Trump while perched on a nearby building rooftop outside the rally\u2019s security perimeter, before being killed by the Secret Service, according to law enforcement officials. Witnesses at the rally described a \u201cbloody\u201d and chaotic scene, with people trying to administer first aid to those hit by the gunfire and struggling with the dense crowd. The shooting left one rally attendee dead and two others in critical condition, authorities said. Trump was injured, writing on social media that he\u2019d been hit by a bullet in the upper part of his ear \u2013 though his campaign said he was otherwise fine. Trump flew back to Newark, New Jersey, late Saturday night. Now attention turns to the active and ongoing investigation, which involves multiple federal and state bodies. The FBI has urged members of the public to submit any information they have through a tip line or the agency website, including photos or videos of the shooting. Crooks graduated from Bethel Park High School in 2022, according to a local media\u00a0report\u00a0and a\u00a0video\u00a0of the school\u2019s commencement. He was registered to vote as a Republican,\u00a0according to a listing in Pennsylvania\u2019s voter database that matched his name, age, and a Bethel Park address that law enforcement was searching Saturday night and is linked to Crooks in public records. This year\u2019s presidential election would have been the first he was old enough to vote in. Federal Election Commission records show that a donor listed as Thomas Crooks with the same address gave $15 to a Democratic-aligned political action committee called the Progressive Turnout Project in January 2021. When reached by CNN late Saturday night, Crooks\u2019 father, Matthew Crooks, said he was trying to figure out \u201cwhat the hell is going on\u201d but would \u201cwait until I talk to law enforcement\u201d before speaking about his son. After being killed at the scene, Crooks didn\u2019t have any identification on his body, so agents\u00a0had to\u00a0\u201crun his DNA and get biometric confirmation,\u201d Kevin Rojek, the\u00a0special\u00a0agent in charge of the\u00a0FBI\u2019s\u00a0Pittsburgh\u00a0field\u00a0office, said at a press conference Saturday night\u00a0before the gunman was named.

{"id": "2024_07_13_us_cape-cod-dolphin-stranding-largest-us-history", "text": "The stranding of more than 140 dolphins off Cape Cod last month has been confirmed as the largest mass stranding of the mammals in United States history, animal rescuers say. A final review of data and aerial imagery of the mass stranding event near Wellfleet, Massachusetts, believed to have begun June 28, revealed 146 dolphins were involved, the International Fund for Animal Welfare announced Thursday. Wellfleet is located on Cape Cod\u2019s northeastern arm. The dolphins were found stranded in the shallow mud flats of Wellfleet in an area called the \u201cGut,\u201d or Great Island at the Herring River. \u201cWe believe 102 survived the multi-day event, which is (about) a 70% survival rate,\u201d according to Stacey Hedman, communications director for the global animal welfare and conservation non-profit, which rescues, rehabilitates and releases animals. Seven of the dolphins were euthanized and 37 died naturally, according to Hedman. The organization said last month the stranding of what was initially said to be around 125 Atlantic white-sided dolphins in the area could possibly be \u201cthe largest single mass stranding event\u201d in the organization\u2019s history, CNN previously reported. Dolphins, whales or porpoises are considered stranded \u201cwhen they are found dead, either on the beach or floating in the water, or alive on the beach and unable to return to the water,\u201d according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. \u201cThis rescue had many challenges due to the number of dolphins, the large size of many of the animals, how spread out they were over a large area, the difficult mud conditions and the complicated locations from which we could reach them,\u201d said Misty Niemeyer, stranding coordinator for the organization, in a statement last month. The organization said the mass stranding event was \u201cconsidered closed\u201d by July 8, by which time more than 100 dolphins had been returned to their homes in deeper waters. The satellite tracking tags attached to the dolphins showed they were swimming a safe distance away offshore, according to Hedman. \u201cWe have been receiving reports from whale watch vessels that have seen some of the dolphins \u2013 identified with temporary markings \u2013 now swimming among other groups of hundreds of other dolphins that had not been part of the stranding \u2013 a happy image!\u201d Hedman said. Although two prior events in Hawaii and Florida Keys show dolphin species circling in shallow water, the most recent occurrence marks the highest number of dolphins beached in a single stranding event, according to the organization. More dolphins get stranded along Cape Cod\u2019s 12-mile stretch of shoreline than any other location worldwide, according to the organization.

{"id": "trump-supporters-blame-media", "text": "Moments after\u00a0Donald Trump\u00a0was rushed to safety following a failed assassination attempt at a Saturday night rally, some of his supporters turned toward the press pen with obscenities as they fingered reporters for blame. \u201cThis is your fault!\u201d one attendee emphatically yelled, pointing at individual journalists as he approached the fence line separating them from attendees. \u201cThis is your fault!\u201d \u201cIt is your fault!\u201d exclaimed another. Axios\u00a0reporter\u00a0Sophia\u00a0Cai, who quoted some in the crowd warning the press, \u201cyou\u2019re next\u201d and that their \u201ctime is coming,\u201d\u00a0even reported that\u00a0a few rally goers tried to breach the barriers establishing the press pen, but that they were stopped by security personnel. In the immediate wake of the horrific shooting attempt on Trump\u2019s life, which resulted in the tragic death of one rally attendee and the severe wounding of two others, the news media has quickly emerged among some Trump supporters as a body to assign blame. While the Trump campaign urged its staff to \u201ccondemn all forms of violence\u201d and said it \u201cwill not tolerate dangerous rhetoric on social media,\u201d some of the former president\u2019s supporters in\u00a0MAGA Media\u00a0vehemently assailed the press for its hard-knuckled reporting on Trump, which has sounded the alarm on what four more years under the former president would look like. Over the course of the campaign cycle, news organizations have, among other things, reported at length on Trump\u2019s plans to warp the federal government for his own ends, including to seek vengeance against his political opponents. That reporting is now facing scrutiny, with some Trump supporters blaming it for producing a charged atmosphere that gave way to the assassination attempt, while mostly looking past the incendiary rhetoric of the former president himself. Immediately after the attack, top figures across the news media condemned the shooting, underscoring that violence against a political candidate is an attack on democracy itself. Top liberal commentators also expressed their disgust in strong terms.\u00a0MSNBC\u2019s\u00a0Rachel Maddow, the country\u2019s most recognized liberal personality, said she did not \u201chave adequate words to describe how disgusted and horrified\u201d she was. \u201cThere is no *no* *no* *no* violent solution to any American political conflict,\u201d Maddow\u00a0wrote on Threads. \u201cI am grateful the former president is going to be ok, and miserably sad and angry about the other people hurt and killed. This is a very dark day.\u201d The reaction from the press and liberal media figures stood in stark contrast to how right-wing media personalities have responded in the aftermath of attacks on Democrats. Instead of raising the volume or fanning the flames of false flag conspiracy theories, which top figures on the right have done after attacks on\u00a0Paul Pelosi\u00a0and\u00a0Gabrielle Giffords, they urged for calm. Nevertheless, the anti-press attitude in MAGA circles has unquestionably increased. Despite the accuracy of the news media\u2019s reporting on Trump, supporters of the former president have moved to vilify and scapegoat journalists for the heinous attack, sending anti-media attitudes to alarming heights. \u201cOn a daily basis, MSNBC tells its audience that Trump is a threat to democracy, an authoritarian in waiting, and a would-be dictator if no one stops him,\u201d conservative radio host\u00a0Erick Erickson\u00a0wrote on X. \u201cWhat did they think would happen?\u201d Donald Trump Jr.\u00a0blasted\u00a0CNN,\u00a0The Washington Post, and the press at large for recent coverage of his father. \u201cDems and their friends in the media knew exactly what they were doing with the \u2018literally Hitler\u2019 bullshit!,\u201d he wrote on X. With just over 100 days until the November elections, the inflamed disposition toward the press has prompted cause for concern among news executives and spurred discussion inside newsrooms about safety and security precautions \u2014 especially with the\u00a0Republican National Convention\u00a0set to start on Monday. That four-day event, which was already a security concern prior to the assassination attempt, will bring together scores of journalists, alongside thousands of Trump supporters. \u201cJournalists are always among the very first to run towards a crisis, and we collectively are working in overdrive to keep everyone safe,\u201d one news executive told me. \u201cThat is the absolute top priority.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/trump-supporters-blame-media/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/15/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_07_10_us_alabama-death-row-inmate-autopsy-lawsuit", "text": "Alabama will forgo an autopsy on a Muslim death row inmate who sued the state, saying the procedure following his execution by lethal injection next week would violate his religious beliefs. Keith Gavin, who is set to be executed next Thursday or Friday, said in the lawsuit an \u201cinvasive autopsy\u201d violated his \u201csincerely held religious beliefs,\u201d as well as Alabama state law, according to the complaint filed by his attorneys last month. Gavin is a devout Muslim, the complaint said, and his religion \u201cteaches that the human body is a sacred temple, which must be kept whole.\u201d An autopsy, he argued, would desecrate his body and \u201cviolate the sanctity of keeping his human body intact\u201d along with his right to the free exercise of his religion. On Friday, Alabama Department of Corrections spokesperson Kelly Windham Betts told CNN: \u201cNo autopsy will be performed on Keith Edmund Gavin. His remains will be picked up by the attending funeral home.\u201d CNN has reached out to Gavin\u2019s attorneys for comment. Among those named in the lawsuit were Escambia County District Attorney Steve Billy, Alabama Department of Corrections Commissioner John Hamm and Terry Raybon, warden of the William C. Holman Correctional Facility where Gavin is on death row. \u201cWe are working on a resolution,\u201d the office of Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall told CNN this week.  The complaint had sought a judicial order preventing the defendants from performing the autopsy and requiring them \u201cto respect Mr. Gavin\u2019s constitutional rights and sincerely held religious beliefs.\u201d The lawsuit claimed Gavin\u2019s attorneys had repeatedly attempted to reach state officials in charge of the autopsy process regarding his request for his \u201cearthly remains to be handled consistent with his faith,\u201d but had received no response. Immediately after Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey signed Gavin\u2019s April 25 letter setting his execution date, the lawsuit said the defendants failed to respond to phone calls, emails and in-person visits or have declined to speak with Gavin\u2019s attorneys. Under Alabama law, a medical examiner is required to investigate any death that takes place in any penal institution in the state, and the law gives discretion to state officials to order a postmortem autopsy if the death is \u201cunlawful, suspicious or unnatural.\u201d \u201cThis law is intended to establish with certainty the cause of death in any such event. After Mr. Gavin\u2019s execution, there will be no question as to who or what caused Mr. Gavin\u2019s death. The State will execute him by lethal injection,\u201d the lawsuit argued. On Thursday, the Council on American-Islamic Relations \u2013 the largest Muslim civil rights and advocacy organization in the country \u2013 called on Alabama officials to accept Gavin\u2019s request. \u201cIn Islamic beliefs, autopsies are generally viewed as impermissible mutilation of the deceased but are permissible in cases of necessity and only to the extent required,\u201d CAIR said in a statement. \u201cThe religious freedom guaranteed to every American in our founding documents does not cease to apply behind bars,\u201d CAIR Research and Advocacy Director Corey Saylor said. \u201cWe urge Alabama state officials to accept Mr. Gavin\u2019s request that his body not be autopsied after execution.\u201d Alabama has faced scrutiny over its executions after multiple failed lethal injections prompted an internal review of the state\u2019s capital punishment system in 2022. Ivey asked the state Department of Corrections to conduct a \u201ctop-to-bottom review of the state\u2019s execution process\u201d after the problems came into the national spotlight, CNN previously reported. The state resumed executions last spring after the review was completed.

American Rounds, the distributor of the machines, uses AI technology to scan the customers\u2019 identification as well as facial recognition software to verify a customer\u2019s identity, according to the company\u2019s website. The software works together to verify the buyer\u2019s age and that the person using the machine matches the identification scanned. Each machine sells ammunition\u00a0for various firearm calibers, including rifles, shotguns and handguns, according to American Rounds. Grant Magers, CEO of American Rounds, said local grocery stores approached him\u00a0in the spring of 2023 about utilizing his technology to sell ammunition. The company rolled out its\u00a0first dispenser in Alabama last November. \u201cIt\u2019s not much different than setting up any other business,\u201d Magers said. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) has\u00a0allowed the machines, telling CNN in a statement: \u201cA federal license is not required to sell ammunition. However, commercial sales of ammunition must comply with state laws as well as any applicable federal laws.\u201d The Office of the Oklahoma Attorney General tells CNN a \u201creview of state statutes indicates these vending machines appear to be lawful.\u201d CNN has reached out to the Alabama and Texas attorneys general to confirm the legality of the dispensers in their respective states. Earlier this month, the ammunition dispenser in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, was taken down and relocated by American Rounds. \u201cWe as a business \u2026 made the decision to relocate that machine because we weren\u2019t having the sales that we wanted to at that location compared to our other spots,\u201d Magers said. Kip Tyner, a member of Tuscaloosa city council, told CNN: \u201cIt may be getting in the hands of people who are not that responsible. I just don\u2019t see it as a necessity.\u201d \u201cThere could be a dispute, and someone got upset with someone else and instead of cooling off and having to go to the store the next day they could go to the grocery store to get ammunition and use it for the wrong reasons,\u201d Tyner said.

{"id": "2024_07_14_politics_what-happened-trump-assassination-attempt", "text": "Former President\u00a0Donald Trump\u2019s rally speech in Butler, Pennsylvania, Saturday evening began just as it had at dozens of rallies previously \u2013 his attendees chanted \u201cUSA! USA!\u201d and Trump clapped and pointed to faces in the crowd before taking the lectern. About 150 yards to the north of the former president, a gunman was climbing onto the roof of a building\u00a0outside the rally security perimeter. He had an AR-style weapon with him. Six minutes into the former president\u2019s speech, the gunman took aim at Trump and squeezed the trigger. What happened next was as miraculous as it was historic. The gunman, later identified by the FBI as 20-year-old\u00a0Thomas Matthew Crooks, fired multiple shots, including one that Trump said skimmed his ear. Trump ducked to the ground. Five Secret Service agents rushed to the stage and covered the former president, as the pop-pop from another two additional bursts of gunfire rang out across the Butler Farm Show grounds. Forty-three seconds after the first shot was fired, a Secret Service agent said the shooter was down. Trump, his ear and face bloodied, was brought to his feet. He raised his fist in a defiant and iconic pose to his supporters to let them know he was OK before agents took him off the stage and into his SUV. At least three rally attendees were shot, one of whom was killed. The incident is being investigated as an assassination attempt. It is the first time since 1981, when John Hinckley Jr. tried to assassinate Ronald Reagan,\u00a0that a current or former president has been shot at. It\u2019s still too soon to determine what security failures may have occurred, such as how the shooter was able to get a clear line of sight to Trump. Attendees have helped to fill in some details, including chaos in the immediate aftermath of the gunfire and suspicions about the gunman before he scaled the roof of the building just outside the rally site \u2013 transforming an ordinary political event into both an extraordinary moment in American politics and a deadly crime scene. \u2018Security seemed tight\u2019 Large crowds had flocked to the show grounds in the small city of Butler, some 30 miles north of Pittsburgh, to glimpse the former president at his final campaign rally before the Republican National Convention begins\u00a0on Monday. For weeks, the nation had been fixated on Trump\u2019s opponent, and whether President Joe Biden\u2019s candidacy\u00a0could withstand\u00a0the defections by members of his own party after a poor showing at the CNN presidential debate in June. But by the time Trump arrived in Butler, attention was turning toward\u00a0the convention in Milwaukee. Interest was high in his imminent announcement of a running mate, and he was less than a week from accepting his party\u2019s nomination for president for the third consecutive election cycle. Trump\u2019s fans and voters in Butler \u2013 many of them donning\u00a0the familiar red \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hats \u2013 were looking forward to hearing from the man himself, braving the mid-July sun to wait for hours on a day with highs around 90 degrees Fahrenheit. Two and a half hours before Trump took the stage, the rally attendees watched a typical rally pre-show: There was a prayer, the Pledge of Allegiance, and the national anthem, sung by a 16-year-old teenager. Then a raft of the former president\u2019s supporters \u2013 including two congressmen and a Senate candidate \u2013\u00a0spoke to warm up the crowd ahead of the rally headliner. \u201cHe was very upbeat and excited about the rally because it was such a great turnout,\u201d said Dave McCormick, the Republican Senate candidate in Pennsylvania who saw Trump\u00a0before the shooting. McCormick was whisked\u00a0into the venue through a private entrance manned by members of the Secret Service. There, someone waved a security wand around him to ensure he was not carrying a weapon. \u201cSecurity,\u201d\u00a0he said Sunday, \u201cseemed tight.\u201d Other attendees had to go through magnetometers, or walk-through metal detectors, to get into the rally. It was there that one person caught the attention of authorities: Crooks was spotted by local law enforcement, who thought he\u00a0was\u00a0acting suspiciously near the magnetometers, according to a senior law enforcement official. They put it out over their radio to keep an eye on him \u2013 and that information was passed to the Secret Service as well, according to the source. Indeed, a local officer\u00a0spotted Crooks before he began shooting\u00a0but could not engage him, Butler County Sheriff Michael T. Slupe told CNN. The officer was searching the area after Butler Township officers received calls about a suspicious person outside the rally perimeter, Slupe said. Officers eventually discovered Crook was on the roof, and one local officer hoisted another up to peer over the ledge. The shooter turned around, saw the officer and pointed his gun at him, Slupe said. The officer let go to \u201ctake cover\u201d and save his own life. \u2018This is a big, big, beautiful crowd\u2019 Trump was initially scheduled to go on stage about 5 p.m.\u00a0ET, but he was running late. It wasn\u2019t until 6:02 p.m.\u00a0that Lee Greenwood\u2019s \u201cGod Bless the USA\u201d began blaring on the venue\u2019s speakers and the former president walked up the short staircase on the left side of the makeshift rally stage. Trump was wearing a white shirt without a tie, a dark navy suit and his signature red \u201cMake American Great Again\u201d hat. As Greenwood\u2019s \u201cI\u2019m proud to be an American\u201d chorus played in the background, Trump circled the stage, clapping to the audience and pointing at various attendees seated both in front of him as well as in the grandstands behind him. Trump\u2019s supporters waved \u201cTrump 2024\u201d signs that read \u201cCrooked Joe You\u2019re Fired!\u201d on the back. At 6:05 p.m., the song finished and Trump took to the lectern at the center of the stage. \u201cUSA! USA!\u201d the attendees chanted. \u201cThis is a big crowd\u00a0\u2014 this is a big, big, beautiful crowd,\u201d Trump said at the start of his speech. As he did at every rally, Trump quickly began\u00a0by\u00a0criticizing Biden, warning about immigrants coming across US borders, and vowing to win Pennsylvania and \u201ctake back our country.\u201d He noted McCormick, the GOP Pennsylvania Senate candidate, seated in front of him. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna get a good senator,\u201d Trump told the crowd, pointing to McCormick and saying he would bring him up on stage a little bit\u00a0later. Trump continued with his speech. \u201cYou don\u2019t mind if I go off teleprompter, do you?\u201d he asked the crowd to cheers at 6:10 p.m., exactly 60 seconds before the shots began. The former president turned his attention to a chart with border statistics displayed on a massive screen over his right shoulder offstage. \u201cTake a look at that chart,\u201d Trump said and pointed to his right \u2013 turning in the direction of the building north of him, where Crooks was preparing to take aim at the former president. Crooks had climbed onto\u00a0the flat rooftop of a light beige, single-story commercial building roughly 150 yards to the north of the rally stage. The open grass area where the rally was being held was encircled with a low chain-link fence. The building was just outside that fenced perimeter. An eyewitness described\u00a0being\u00a0on a fence line and seeing a gunman moving \u201cfrom roof to roof\u201d just before the shooting. There were several buildings in the complex. The witness, Ben Macer, told\u00a0CNN affiliate KDKA\u00a0that he went to tell an officer just moments before the shooting began. \u201cWhen I turned around to go back to where I was, it was when the gunshots started, and then it was just chaos, and we all came running away, and that was that,\u201d Macer said. \u2018Get down, get down, get down!\u2019 At 6:11 p.m., Trump was six minutes into his speech, looking to his right and looking at the jumbotron displaying immigration statistics.\u00a0\u201cYou know that\u2019s a little bit old \u2014\u00a0that chart, that chart\u2019s a couple of months old,\u201d Trump told the crowd. \u201cAnd if you want to really see something this sad,\u201d Trump continued, \u201ctake a look at what happened\u2026\u201d \u201cPop pop. Pop pop. Pop pop.\u201d Trump didn\u2019t finish his sentence. The sounds of several rounds of gunfire rang out across the rally site. Trump grabbed his ear and took a step backward before ducking to the ground. \u201cGet down! Get down! Get down!\u201d a male agent yelled at the former president. Five agents swarmed the stage and surrounded Trump on the floor. \u201cPop, pop, pop, pop.\u201d\u00a0 There was another round of gunshots, this time in staccato-like succession, five seconds after the first. \u201cWhat\u2019re we doing, what\u2019re we doing?\u201d a female agent said, in audio that was picked up by Trump\u2019s microphone. Twelve seconds later, a third round of gunshots echoed through the show grounds. \u201cReady.\u201d \u201cMove!\u201d \u201cUp!\u201d \u201cGo, go, go.\u201d Several agents shouted short commands in succession while they remained on top of Trump. Agents in combat gear with long rifles walked onto the stage. Forty-three seconds after the first shots were fired, the agents said the shooter was down. \u201cShooter\u2019s down. Shooter\u2019s down. Are we good to move?\u201d several agents said. \u201cAre we clear?\u201d asked a female agent. \u201cWe\u2019re clear, we\u2019re clear, we\u2019re clear,\u201d agents said. \u201cLet\u2019s move, let\u2019s move,\u201d said a male agent. \u2018Wait, wait, wait\u2019 Trump was then lifted to his feet by the agents around him. \u201cLet me get my shoes on,\u201d Trump said once he was standing. \u201cHold on, your head is bloody,\u201d one of the agents told him. \u201cSir, we\u2019ve got to move to the car, sir,\u201d another agent said. \u201cLet me get my shoes,\u201d Trump said again. The agents prepared to move Trump offstage when he stopped them once more. \u201cWait, wait, wait,\u201d the former president told them. Trump lifted his head above the agents surrounding him and raised his fist in the air. \u201cFight!\u201d Trump mouthed to the crowd three times, sparking loud cheers from attendees as they rose to their feet upon seeing that Trump was OK. Trump and\u00a0the\u00a0five agents surrounding him\u00a0walked in unison to the stairs at the left of the stage. Trump stopped once more to raise his fist, pumping it three times before he was carried down the stairs and into his SUV several feet away. Trump raised his fist one last time as he got into the backseat of the vehicle. \u2018It was all of a sudden just chaos\u2019 As the first gunshots echoed across the show grounds, rallygoers cried out. Members of the crowd in the bleachers behind Trump ducked, mirroring the former president, their faces a mix of confusion and fear. When one final gunshot rang out, a loud scream pierced the air. \u201cIt was all of a sudden just chaos,\u201d said McCormick, an Army combat veteran, describing the moment the Secret Service converged on the former president, shielding Trump with their own bodies. Behind him, people were gathered around \u00a0a victim, trying to administer first aid until medical assistance could make its way through the dense crowd. Adding to the chaos and confusion, a tractor parked on the other side of the stage let out a massive cloud of steam, apparently having been hit by a stray bullet. Joseph Meyn, a surgeon from nearby Grove City, was filming Trump\u2019s speech on his phone \u2014 it was his first Trump rally, he said \u2014 when he heard the gunshots and saw the former president get hit. He said that when he looked to see where the gunshots originated, he saw a man who had been shot in the head. Meyn was sure the sound was gunfire, but many other attendees thought they were hearing fireworks. \u201cHalf the crowd was in shock, and the other half thought it was some type of weird joke,\u201d Meyn said. Rico Elmore,\u00a0a former Pennsylvania legislative candidate\u00a0who had spoken at the rally earlier, vaulted over a barrier to reach a wounded attendee, he later told CNN. \u201cAll we know is shots were fired, and then I jumped over the barrier and put my hand on the guy\u2019s head that was profusely bleeding,\u201d he said, visibly shaken, his own white button-down shirt by that time stained with blood. Elmore didn\u2019t know the man. \u201cJust a stranger,\u201d he said. Meyn said he \u201chelped carry the body of the man out of the stands.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThey took the body to the tent behind the bleachers,\u201d he said later, while waiting to provide a witness statement to the FBI. Investigators wanted access to data on his phone, he said. One rally attendee was killed by the shots, and another two were critically injured, law enforcement\u00a0said\u00a0later that evening. The victim was identified on Sunday as Corey Comperatore. Democratic Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro said Comperatore was an \u201cavid supporter of the former president\u201d and was excited to be there with him in the community. \u201cCorey was a girl dad. Corey was a firefighter. Corey went to church every Sunday. Cory loved his community. Most especially, Cory loved his family,\u201d Shapiro said. \u2018I was shot with a bullet\u2019 Trump was taken to a local hospital from the rally site, with the world watching on to learn whether he had been seriously hurt. Thirty minutes after he was shot, the Secret Service communications chief posted on X that Trump was \u201csafe,\u201d and that the incident was under investigation. Soon after, Trump\u2019s spokesman released a statement that the former president was \u201cfine\u201d and being checked out at a local medical facility. As he so often does, Trump would fill in more details about what happened through his own social media. \u201cI was shot with a bullet that pierced the upper part of my right ear. I knew immediately that something was wrong in that I heard a whizzing sound, shots, and immediately felt the bullet ripping through the skin. Much bleeding took place, so I realized then what was happening,\u201d Trump posted on Truth Social at 8:42 p.m., thanking law enforcement for their quick response and expressing condolences for the attendee\u00a0who was killed. Biden was attending church in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, when the shooting occurred. After leaving church, the president was briefed on the\u00a0attack on his predecessor.

A promising cinematographer was killed, a director was wounded and a film production was left in shambles. Since that day\u2019s fatal shooting of 42-year-old Halyna Hutchins, the film\u2019s armorer and its assistant director have been convicted of criminal charges. After nearly three years of back-and-forth legal arguments, Baldwin\u2019s trial on the involuntary manslaughter charge began on July 10 with opening statements but ended abruptly on July 12, when the judge ruled prosecutors did not properly turn over evidence to the defense, and dismissed the charges. The details of what happened the day of the shooting have been made public in affidavits, probable cause statements, interviews with the main participants and testimony at criminal trials. Here\u2019s a timeline of the on-set shooting and the resulting legal cases. The shooting May 29, 2020: Baldwin, the three-time Emmy winner for his roles on \u201c30 Rock\u201d and \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d was announced as producer and star of the Western feature film \u201cRust,\u201d based on a story by Baldwin and Joel Souza, Deadline reported. In the film, Baldwin plays a grizzled outlaw on the run from authorities with his 13-year-old grandson. October 6, 2021: Filming of \u201cRust\u201d began at Bonanza Creek Ranch, a movie set outside Santa Fe, New Mexico. October 20, 2021: Several crew members walked off set, citing safety concerns. One crew member stated there had been two accidental weapons discharges and a special effects mess-up that set off explosives around the crew between takes. October 21, 2021: Hannah Gutierrez Reed, the armorer for \u201cRust,\u201d loaded a prop six-shot revolver with what she believed were \u201cdummy\u201d rounds, a term for ammo that contains no explosive elements but appear to be real, according to investigators and her defense attorney. Baldwin and several crew members began rehearsing a scene in a rustic church on set before breaking for lunch. After the break, Baldwin, Souza, Hutchins and a few others returned to the church for rehearsal. Assistant director Dave Halls fetched a prop gun from a cart outside the church and yelled \u201ccold gun,\u201d indicating it was unloaded. He then handed the gun to Baldwin. Baldwin practiced a \u201ccross draw\u201d \u2013 pulling a gun from a holster on the opposite side of his body from his draw hand. The scene required him to point the gun toward the camera, helmed by Hutchins, Souza and a camera operator. Suddenly, they heard a loud bang. Hutchins stumbled backward, slumped to the floor clutching her stomach and said she couldn\u2019t feel her legs. Souza, who had been standing beside her, noticed blood on his shoulder. At 1:48 p.m., the crew reported the shooting to emergency responders. Hutchins was transported by air helicopter to the hospital and was pronounced dead at 3:37 p.m. Souza was treated at the hospital, and a projectile from a live round was removed from his back. Sheriff\u2019s deputies arrived to the scene and began investigating the series of events leading to the shooting. October 22, 2021: Baldwin released a statement calling the death a \u201ctragic accident\u201d and said he is fully cooperating with the police investigation. December 2, 2021: In an interview with ABC, Baldwin said he cocked the gun and let go of the hammer, and the gun then fired. He said he was aiming the gun just to the side of the camera toward Hutchins, as she instructed him to do. \u201cI would never point a gun at anyone and then pull the trigger, never,\u201d he said. The investigations August 14, 2022: FBI testing of the firearm found it could not be fired without pulling the trigger while the gun was cocked, according to a forensics report. The report noted the gun eventually malfunctioned during FBI testing after internal parts fractured, causing the gun to go off in the cocked position without pulling the trigger. August 20, 2022: In an interview with CNN, Baldwin\u00a0placed responsibility\u00a0for Hutchins\u2019 death on Gutierrez Reed, the film armorer and props assistant, and on assistant director Halls, who handed him the gun. October 5, 2022: The family of Hutchins and Baldwin reached an undisclosed settlement in a wrongful death lawsuit filed against the actor and others. As part of the settlement, Matthew Hutchins, the cinematographer\u2019s widower, was named an executive producer on \u201cRust.\u201d January 19, 2023: Prosecutors announced Baldwin and Gutierrez Reed will be charged with involuntary manslaughter in Hutchins\u2019 death. Halls, the assistant director, agreed to plead no contest to negligent use of a deadly weapon, the district attorney\u2019s office announced. The terms of that deal include six months of probation\u00a0and a suspended sentence, prosecutors said. January 31, 2023: Baldwin and Gutierrez Reed were formally charged with involuntary manslaughter. February 23, 2023: Baldwin pleaded not guilty to manslaughter charges and was released on personal recognizance. April 20, 2023: New Mexico special prosecutors dismissed the charges against Baldwin, citing \u201cnew facts\u201d in the case. \u201cThis decision does not absolve Mr. Baldwin of criminal culpability and charges may be refiled,\u201d they said. August 9, 2023: Gutierrez Reed pleaded not guilty to involuntary manslaughter and tampering with evidence. January 19: Baldwin was indicted by a grand jury on charges of involuntary manslaughter. January 31: Baldwin pleaded not guilty to involuntary manslaughter charges for the second time. The trials February 22: The trial of film armorer Gutierrez Reed began. Prosecutors alleged her failures allowed six live bullets to make their way on set, and she did not make vital safety checks that would have caught the problem. Her defense blamed Baldwin for failing to follow common-sense gun safety rules and on the film\u2019s production team for creating a chaotic and unsafe environment. March 1: Souza, the director and screenwriter, testified about the moment he was shot on set while standing behind Hutchins. March 6: Gutierrez Reed was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter after jurors deliberated for nearly three hours. She was acquitted of a charge of evidence tampering. April 15: At her sentencing hearing, Gutierrez Reed said, \u201cMy heart aches\u201d for Hutchins\u2019 family and friends, and she asked the judge to sentence her to probation. The judge criticized her statement and sentenced her to a maximum of 18 months in prison, saying, \u201cYou alone turned a safe weapon into a lethal weapon.\u201d May 24: A New Mexico judge denied Baldwin\u2019s motion to dismiss the involuntary manslaughter indictment. Baldwin\u2019s attorneys had accused prosecutors of misconduct during the grand jury process. June 3: New Mexico prosecutors asked the court to grant use immunity to Gutierrez Reed and compel her to testify at Baldwin\u2019s trial, according to court documents. Gutierrez Reed invoked her Fifth Amendment right to silence in a pre-trial interview, and prosecutors said if she is not granted immunity then she would not be able to testify in the trial. Gutierrez Reed\u2019s attorney, Jason Bowles, told CNN he will oppose the motion. June 17: Prosecutors signaled their intention to portray Baldwin as repeatedly flouting safety protocols on the movie set in the days before the fatal shooting, according to\u00a0a court filing. June 21: Judge Mary Marlowe Sommer denied a defense motion asking the court to dismiss the involuntary manslaughter indictment. The defense had argued the shooting death was an accident and Baldwin was \u201cnot criminally liable,\u201d but the prosecution countered Baldwin was experienced in the movie business and knew he was handling a real gun. The judge also denied the prosecution\u2019s motion to grant use immunity to Gutierrez Reed to compel her to testify at Baldwin\u2019s trial. June 28: The court denied a motion to dismiss the charges related to the gun that was damaged during forensic testing. Separately, attorneys for Gutierrez Reed in a court filing on June 27 accused prosecutors of withholding evidence that would have favored the defendant during her manslaughter trial and requested she be released from prison,\u00a0Reuters\u00a0reported. According to the filing obtained by Reuters, prosecutors had a report from their own weapons experts that the gun used on set had \u201cunexplained toolmarks on critical surfaces of the trigger and sear.\u201d July 3: Judge Sommer denied two motions filed by Baldwin\u2019s legal team alleging prosecutors had improperly handled evidence, paving the way for Baldwin\u2019s trial to start. July 8: The judge ruled Baldwin\u2019s role as a producer on the film \u201cRust\u201d would not be considered at trial. The prosecution had sought to show Baldwin had more responsibility and influence on the set than just as an actor, but the judge said the evidence was prejudicial and confusing to the jury. July 9: Twelve jurors and four alternates were empaneled in Santa Fe for Baldwin\u2019s trial. July 10: The trial of Baldwin on a charge of involuntary manslaughter began with opening statements. Prosecutors alleged Baldwin was reckless with firearms on set and violated the \u201ccardinal rules of firearm safety.\u201d \u201cHe pointed the gun at another human being, cocked the hammer and pulled that trigger, in reckless disregard for Ms. Hutchins\u2019 safety,\u201d prosecutor Erlinda Johnson said. The defense blamed the film\u2019s armorer and the first assistant director for allowing a live round to be loaded into the prop gun. \u201cThis was an unspeakable tragedy, but Alec Baldwin committed no crime. He was an actor, acting, playing the role of Harlan Rust. An actor playing a character can do things that are lethal,\u201d attorney Alex Spiro said. \u201cThese \u2018cardinal rules\u2019 are not cardinal rules on a movie set.\u201d July 12: The involuntary manslaughter case against Baldwin was dismissed in dramatic fashion after the judge overseeing the case ruled prosecutors did not properly turn over evidence to the defense. Sommer sided with the defense and dismissed the case with prejudice, meaning it cannot be brought again. \u201cThe state\u2019s discovery violation has injected a needless, incurable delay into the jury trial,\u201d she said. \u201cDismissal with prejudice is warranted to ensure the integrity of the judicial system and the efficient administration of justice. Your motion to dismiss with prejudice is granted.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/08/us/rust-shooting-timeline-alec-baldwin/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/15/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_07_14_markets_premarket-stock-trading-trump-assassination", "text": "US stock futures barely budged after an assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump on Saturday, signaling calm in the markets as Trump survived the incident. Dow futures rose 65 points, or 0.2%,\u00a0while S&P 500 futures rose 0.1% and Nasdaq Composite futures were unchanged. On Saturday, the former president\u00a0was shot in the ear during his rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, in what the\u00a0FBI says was an assassination attempt. The Trump campaign was he was doing \u201cfine\u201d after the shooting. The shooter was killed, as well as one attendee, according to authorities. Two spectators were critically injured. President Joe Biden said he\u00a0spoke with Trump\u00a0after the shooting and denounced the violence in remarks shortly after. The Republican National Convention kicks off Monday in\u00a0Milwaukee, where\u00a0the GOP is expected to officially nominate\u00a0Trump as the Republican candidate for the 2024 presidential election. Trump is also expected to announce his\u00a0running mate\u00a0during the convention. Markets crave stability, and an assassination attempt against the presumptive nominee might have\u00a0thrown that into chaos. But Trump appears to have escaped with mostly superficial injuries, and the market\u2019s thesis of the race hasn\u2019t changed: Trump remains the frontrunner to become the next president. A Trump win in November likely means the\u00a0preservation or expansion of tax cuts\u00a0and increased tariffs. During last month\u2019s presidential debate hosted by CNN, he reiterated his desire to impose a 10% tariff on all imports, which would likely increase inflation and cast doubt on interest rate cuts. Morgan Stanley research estimates that an expansion of the 2017 tax cuts would boost deficits sharply, sending the US dollar, which is already trading high, even higher. But it could also exacerbate America\u2019s inflation crisis, which has begun to show signs that it is ending.

{"id": "2024_07_14_business_kei-trucks-japan-tiny-movement", "text": "Measuring about half the length of a Ford F-150, Kei trucks look almost like toys in comparison to your standard pickup truck. But for a car so tiny, you might be surprised at the massive following that they command. Kei trucks, built to satisfy Japanese light automobile regulations and known as \u201ckeitora\u201d (meaning \u201clight truck\u201d) in Japan, are vehicles that have been enjoying a surge in popularity in the automobile market. Sales of Kei trucks tripled in the last five years, with around 7,500 total imported just last year, according to data from Japan Used Motor Vehicle. Meanwhile, auto experts see the Kei truck craze as a pushback against big trucks by cash-strapped Americans as the average pickup size and average price tag skyrocketed post-pandemic, according to data from Cars.com. But the cult following of these mini trucks might be better measured by the ubiquity of online spaces that owners and enthusiasts have carved out for themselves. Instagram page Kei Trucks Appreciation Society (@keitrucksas) sells Kei truck-themed merchandise from hoodies to stickers and posts memes for its more than 95,000 followers. On X, Kei truck fans share pictures of mini trucks they spot in the wild. There is even a dedicated Reddit forum where over 23,000 members trade tips on truck maintenance and their experiences importing from Japan. But also common are discussions on the ever-changing legality of Kei trucks by state. While federal regulation allows the import of mini trucks so long as they are 25 years or older, state laws surrounding on-road use and registration are spotty. Most states lack Kei-specific regulation entirely, and so far, only 19 states allow Kei trucks on public roads. In New York, where laws are stricter, they can\u2019t be registered or titled. But despite limitations, demand for Kei trucks continues to grow. Here\u2019s what makes them so popular. Tiny but mighty On the practical end, Kei trucks combine utility and affordability. \u201cPeople want the functionality of a truck, but they don\u2019t want the size of it or to spend $60,000 on it,\u201d said George Zotos, owner and CEO of Kei truck brokerage company OIWA.co. Prices for the Ford F-150 Raptor, one of the line\u2019s higher-power models, start at $78,440. And the high-end 2024 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 High Country starts at $68,495. According to Zotos, the sticker price for Kei trucks sold in the can range anywhere from $500 to $6,000. Research by CNN shows that they can go for even more than that in good condition. Tetsu Ichino, owner of Japanese grocery store Maruichi in Rockville, Maryland, told CNN that he bought his Kei truck for $5,000. Adding shipping and taxes, his total came to $8,100. \u201cI was able to buy it with my credit card. I\u2019ve never bought a car with a credit card, so that was a first for me,\u201d he said. Ichino, a lifelong truck enthusiast, sold his full-size pickup Toyota Tundra in March because he didn\u2019t use it often enough but later missed the utility it provided. He told CNN that while he originally planned to buy another similarly sized truck, he found himself caught up in the Kei truck hype. The engine on Ichino\u2019s 1998 Honda Acty is smaller than that of a motorcycle, but he says it\u2019s still one of the most practical trucks out there. And in Maryland, where there are no Kei-specific rules, he mainly uses it for transporting supplies to his store. \u201cFor the majority of what I do, I will be able to do with the Kei truck,\u201d he said. According to Andrew O\u2019Bright, managing member of Japanese auto import company JDM Imports CT, most mini trucks have the same roughly 6-foot bed size as the F-150, Ford\u2019s full-size pickup truck line known for its towing capacity and powerful engine.   \u201cThey have the utility of an F-150 while getting 30 to 50 miles to the gallon on top of cheaper insurance, cheaper gas,\u201d he said. \u201cEverything about them tells consumers this is the way to go.\u201d Novelty factor But efficiency isn\u2019t the Kei truck\u2019s only point of appeal. Their unique, toy-like image also lends them a sense of novelty. \u201cIt is hard to quantify other than people just have a fascination with this micro vehicle,\u201d Zotos said. He also points to the truck\u2019s versatility as another reason why they appeal to such a wide demographic. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about people who are just turning 16 and getting their driver\u2019s license,\u201d he said. \u201cI had another customer in Chicago who got a truck just to wrap it for advertising.\u201d The cuteness factor of the Kei truck has proved advantageous for Melissa Torre, founder of Philadelphia-based soap and skincare company Vellum Street. As a small business owner, Torre is a regular at farmers markets where vendors are usually allotted a 10x10 space. To avoid the hassle of carting her merchandise back and forth between the parking area and the market lot, she began looking into trucks she could operate her business out of. But the milk vans and box trucks she originally considered were much longer, and she would need to buy two spaces to set up shop. In her research process, Torre came across Kei trucks, which run less than 11 feet in length. \u201cThey would fit exactly in the allotted space that I had been using. It was just a perfect transition without having to increase my cost,\u201d she said. \u201cI get to just pull up and set right up in the back of my truck. So it\u2019s made life a lot easier.\u201d She told CNN that she even spray-painted bubbles on her 1996 Daihatsu Hijet to match her company\u2019s branding. \u201cPeople who may not have stopped before to talk to me at markets will stop and talk about the truck. It\u2019s a driving billboard, but in a fun way,\u201d she said. \u201cKids love it. Adults love it. People are always surprised that I actually drove it there.\u201d Smaller and simpler But for all their popularity, auto experts don\u2019t see Kei trucks becoming mainstream. \u201cIt\u2019d be hard to imagine,\u201d said Mark Schirmer, director of corporate communications at Cox Automotive. He pointed to the failure of Mercedes\u2019 Smart brand in the US but their success in Japan as an example of smaller vehicles performing better in countries with smaller roads. Smart cars, small vehicles built with only two seats and minimal trunk space by Mercedes-Benz, were introduced in 2008 but exited the U.S. market in 2019 due to weak sales. \u201cI think Americans are just used to space,\u201d Schirmer added. And non-profit organizations like the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety have been vocal about their opposition to on-road use of mini trucks, citing concerns about the safety of low-speed vehicles. Still, he sees the popularity of more compact \u2013 if not quite small \u2013 truck models like the Ford Maverick and Hyundai Santa Cruz as a sign of Americans\u2019 appetite for a smaller truck segment. Whereas the Ford F-150 offers 5.5-foot, 6.5-foot and 8-foot bed options, the Maverick is only available in a 4.5-foot bed. But sales numbers hit 40,420 through the first half of 2024, according to data from Ford. And data from Edmunds showed that Americans were trading in more midsize and large pickup trucks for compact trucks than vice versa. Ivan Drury, Edmunds\u2019 director of Insights, says climbing costs for trucks, coupled with high interest rates, are at the heart of this shifting preference toward smaller trucks. \u201cI think people have always liked the utility of trucks, but unfortunately, when they found out that they liked trucks 10 years ago, the price just started going through the roof,\u201d he said. \u201cWith all the features and add-ons, you look at how much a truck has changed over the last 10 years, they\u2019re nothing like what they used to be.\u201d As competition within the auto industry heats up and automakers race to put out more advanced features, Drury says the popularity of smaller vehicles signals a desire for a return to simpler car models. \u201cThere\u2019s tons of technology,\u201d he said. \u201cAt some point, it\u2019s going to be too much and you turn away from it. You\u2019re like, \u201c\u2019I don\u2019t need all that.\u2019\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/14/business/kei-trucks-japan-tiny-movement/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/15/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_07_12_us_what-we-know-dvontaye-mitchell-death", "text": "D\u2019Vontaye Mitchell was his mother\u2019s \u201cbig teddy bear,\u201d who enjoyed music, cooking and art, and was a beloved brother, uncle and father of two. Mitchell, 43, died on June 30, after he was pinned down by hotel security guards outside a Hyatt Regency in Milwaukee in an incident partially captured on video. Hotel employees have been fired since the incident, and police have referred four charges of felony murder in Mitchell\u2019s death, Milwaukee Police said in a statement to CNN Friday, while an ongoing homicide investigation is underway and the full results of the autopsy are pending. The encounter comes as the\u00a0use of force\u00a0\u2013 particularly\u00a0against people of color\u00a0\u2013\u00a0by police and others in authority roles remains under scrutiny nearly four years after\u00a0protests flared nationwide\u00a0following the murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer. It\u2019s unclear what led up to Mitchell\u2019s encounter with the security guards, how long it took officers to arrive on the scene and what Mitchell was doing at the hotel. Here\u2019s what we know about Mitchell, the incident and what witness video shows: What witness video shows (and doesn\u2019t show) Police allege Mitchell \u201ccaused a disturbance,\u201d prompting security guards to escort him out of the hotel,\u00a0according to\u00a0a statement\u00a0from civil rights attorney Ben Crump, who represents the Mitchell family. Security guards and others then pinned Mitchell to the ground, part of a video posted on social media shows Mitchell grunting and pleading with the guards, repeatedly saying \u201cplease\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d It\u2019s unclear what part of the incident witness video captured, what led up to this moment and what happened in the moments after. One guard, who appears to be White, can be heard saying, \u201cStay down,\u201d and \u201cStop fighting,\u201d as the others, who appear to be people of color, hold Mitchell down, the video shows. The same guard calls out to witnesses, \u201cThis is what happens when you go into the ladies room.\u201d Hotel operator fires \u2018hotel associates\u2019 involved It\u2019s unclear how many \u201chotel associates\u201d were fired and if they include the security guards involved in the Mitchell incident. Those security guards initially were suspended as Aimbridge Hospitality, which operates the downtown hotel, completed its investigation, a Hyatt spokesperson told CNN on Monday. \u201cThe conduct we saw from several associates on June 30 violated our policies and procedures, and does not reflect our values as an organization or the behaviors we expect from our associates,\u201d Aimbridge Hospitality, said Thursday in a statement about the death of D\u2019Vontaye Mitchell. \u201cFollowing review of their actions, their employment has been terminated,\u201d the statement added. \u201cWe will continue our independent investigation and do everything we can to support law enforcement with their investigation into this tragic incident.\u201d A homicide investigation is underway The local prosecutor is investigating Mitchell\u2019s death as a homicide, he said Wednesday. The district attorney\u2019s office is awaiting the full results of Mitchell\u2019s autopsy, which will help inform the police investigation into his death and allow the office to evaluate what happened before his death \u201cfrom the perspective of potential criminal liability,\u201d District Attorney John Chisholm said Wednesday in a statement. CNN has reached out to the Milwaukee County Medical Examiner\u2019s office. Police have been in consultation with the Milwaukee County District Attorney\u2019s Office since July 5 and have subsequently referred the charges to the DA, who is reviewing them, Milwaukee Police said in a Friday statement. It\u2019s unclear who those four felony charges are for and how they came to be. Crump said\u00a0the charges\u00a0would be\u00a0a \u201csignificant step toward justice\u201d that \u201cunderscore the severity of the actions that led to\u00a0D\u2019Vontaye\u2019s\u00a0sudden and untimely death.\u201d \u201cWe must now press for these charges to be formally filed by the District Attorney\u2019s Office in order for these officers to truly be held accountable,\u201d he said in a Friday statement to CNN. Crump had originally said Milwaukee Police were not considering the incident as a criminal investigation because there wasn\u2019t any evidence of \u201cblunt force.\u201d CNN has reached out to Crump\u2019s team for more information. Crump\u2019s office obtained an affidavit from an unidentified hotel employee who claimed he reluctantly helped hold down Mitchell after being ordered to do so by a security guard, the attorney said. Crump said he would turn the document over to prosecutors but did not release it publicly. How loved ones remember his big heart Mitchell\u2019s mother, Brenda Giles, said her eldest son was a jolly and outgoing brother, uncle and father who loved his family, she told\u00a0WTMJ. \u201cEverybody that knows him, to know him is to love him, they know,\u201d his sister, Nayisha Mitchell, told the station. \u201cThey knew he was a good person.\u201d Mitchell was known for his creativity in the kitchen, according to his obituary, which was read during Thursday\u2019s funeral. \u201cThe man could turn a can of ravioli into a gourmet meal,\u201d the obituary said. \u201cHe loved to dance, and he was harmless,\u201d Giles told reporters Wednesday. \u201cI always called him my big teddy bear.\u201d Mitchell enjoyed expressing himself through art and music. He had a love for drawing, singing, gospel music, dancing and writing original rap lyrics, his obituary read. \u201cHe also had an insatiable love of knowledge, which he fed through his love of documentaries,\u201d it continued. \u201cD\u2019Vontaye was an avid family man who filled his time visiting his kids and family and he lit up every face with joy when he entered the room.\u201d \u201cHe was known as the person to go to for help, because his big heart would seldom allow him to say no.\u201d When Mitchell\u2019s father passed away in 2016, Mitchell fell into depression, his family told WTMJ. Giles believes her son was suffering from a mental health episode at the time of the incident,\u00a0according to Crump. \u201cTo see him go out this world the way he did, that was devastating.

He had a gun,\u201d Mike DiFrischia said of the shooter. \u201cAnd then when he said that, I moved over a couple of feet, and I was able to get a perfect, I was able to see him perfectly,\u201d he continued. Then he began to record. \u201cMy wife ran up to law enforcement \u2014 was trying to tell them, you know, where he was, but they couldn\u2019t seem to see him because they weren\u2019t in the right spot to see him on the roof. They were too close to the building. So it just got very hectic, very fast,\u201d DiFrischia said. Law enforcement officials asked the DiFrischias, \u201cWhere\u2019s he at?\u201d and they pointed toward the shooter\u2019s location, they told Burnett. Shortly after attempting to alert authorities to the shooter\u2019s position, Amber DiFrischia said people began to run. And then they began to hear gunshots. \u201cIt was just chaotic. It was so fast. First thing is, find coverage. And it was just the scariest thing, you know, there\u2019s not a lot of places you can hide there,\u201d she said, adding they tried \u201cto hide behind two trees just to make sure we weren\u2019t going to be, you know, hit by the bullets.\u201d Mike DiFrischia described how he watched one officer try to climb the building but not make it to the shooter\u2019s location, explaining, \u201cI don\u2019t know if the guy startled him, or what exactly happened.\u201d Though the DiFrischias could not immediately identify that officer, CNN has reported a local officer saw the gunman and was hoisted by another to get up to the ledge. The shooter turned around, saw the officer peering over and pointed his gun at him. The officer let go of the ledge to \u201ctake cover\u201d and save his own life. The gunman then started firing from the rooftop. Trump, who says he was shot in the ear, was rushed offstage with blood on his face. As CNN has reported, widespread concerns and questions have surfaced about how a sniper was able to obtain rooftop access roughly 150 meters from the former president\u2019s position at the podium at an outdoor rally. Sources have described the shooting as coming from the \u201cthree o\u2019clock\u201d position of Trump\u2019s\u00a0podium location,\u00a0with shots coming from his right side.\u00a0Seconds after gunfire rang out, Secret Service counter-assault snipers began shooting the suspect, who was found deceased on top of the roof. Mike DiFrischia, who said his recording also captured the gunman lifeless atop the building, recounted how he first thought the shooter was facing the crowd and had told people around him to get down. \u201cWhen I first seen him looking our way, I thought that he was actually, you know, maybe gonna start shooting this way. I did not realize he had already been shot,\u201d he said.

Mayor G.T. Bynum announced at\u00a0a news conference Friday the victim\u2019s identity as C.L. Daniel, a veteran who served in World War I. \u201cHis family did not know where he had been buried for the last 103 years until this week,\u201d Bynum said. Officials say Daniel was identified \u201cusing data submitted through GEDmatch and Family Tree DNA\u201d and with the assistance of Intermountain Forensics, a laboratory that conducts genealogy work,\u00a0according to a news release. The dig is part of the 1921 Graves Investigation, an effort to identify currently unknown victims of the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre,\u00a0CNN previously reported. Alison Wilde, the\u00a0genealogy\u00a0case manager for the 1921 Graves Investigation, said that they compared\u00a0the DNA profiles and the GEDmatch in the family tree databases. People who have taken DNA tests to create family tree databases \u201chave contributed so much to this research,\u201d she said. Then, they contacted individuals who had matching DNA relatives to see who was buried at Oaklawn Cemetery, according to the news release. Daniel, born in Newnan, Georgia, was one of seven sons to Thomas and Amanda Merriweather. \u201cIt was only through those additional DNA comparisons that we were able to narrow our focus down to a set of brothers and begin requesting records of their lives which led to the records from the National Archive,\u201d Wilde said. A letter obtained from the National Archives also contributed to Daniel\u2019s identification, the release states. \u201cContained in the records (from the National Archives) was the most convincing piece of evidence tying him to the Tulsa Race Massacre \u2013 a letter from C. L.\u2019s family attorney written to the US Veterans Administration on behalf of C. L.\u2019s mother regarding C. L.\u2019s survivor benefits,\u201d according to the release. With the help of the National Archives, officials found records showing Daniel was drafted into the US Army in 1918, was stationed at Camp Gordon and then honorably discharged in December 1919, the news release said. Another\u00a0letter, written by Daniel in February 1921, showed that he was in Ogden, Utah, and was trying to make his way back home to his mother in Georgia, officials said at the news conference. Wilde said that this letter came from the same records request, which was written to the Veterans Administration and the War Risk Insurance Department. There was no mention of Tulsa in the 1921 letter, Wilde said. Officials said they could only assume that in his efforts to travel back to Georgia, he went through Tulsa, since his remains were found in the city. The circumstances of the veteran\u2019s death are unknown, officials say. His remains showed no signs of gunshot wounds, according to Bynum. Bynum said Friday Daniel\u2019s identification offers \u201chope that other remains found in similar circumstances\u201d can also be identified. Bynum said on\u00a0Facebook\u00a0Monday officials \u201chave written documentation that 18 unidentified victims were buried.\u201d He reiterated that fact at Friday\u2019s news conference. \u201cThis identification affirms our need to continue this search with the knowledge that identification and reunification is possible,\u201d he said. Tulsa is working to solidify the next steps in organizing Daniel\u2019s proper burial, which \u201cwill depend entirely on the wishes of C.

The crash happened around 1:20 p.m. Thursday near the Hanakoa Valley along the Na Pali Coast, according to a\u00a0news release\u00a0from the\u00a0Kaua\u2018i Police Department. Police were alerted to the crash by hikers who reported seeing the helicopter go into the water, the release said. One person was found dead around 2:25 p.m., police said. A multiagency search was still underway Friday for the two people who are missing. The pilot of the helicopter was local and the two passengers are believed to be \u201cvisitors from the mainland,\u201d Kaua\u2019i Police Chief Todd Raybuck said. County search and rescue crews resumed search efforts Friday after pausing at sundown Thursday, while the US Coast Guard continued searching throughout the evening, police said. \u201cOur hearts go out to the families impacted by this tragedy,\u201d Raybuck said in the release. \u201cWe will continue working with our partners to locate the missing individuals and provide support during this difficult time.\u201d Fire Chief Michael Gibson said sharks have been a consideration in the search. \u201cWe are focusing all of our efforts on the surface water for any survivors right now,\u201d Gibson said. \u201cWe\u2019re utilizing our assets in the air from the Air National Guard and from Coast Guard to help keep an eye above things. But currently, our first responders are keeping safety in mind and we\u2019re doing our search from personal rescue watercraft and other vessels.\u201d The helicopter, which the FAA identified as a Robinson R44, was operated by Ali\u2019i Kauai Air Tours and Charters, police said. CNN has reached out to the company for comment. Helicopter tours are popular in Hawaii as visitors seek to view the archipelago\u2019s lush landscape by air, but safety concerns have been raised following other fatal crashes. Seven people were killed when a tour helicopter crashed in a remote area of a state park on Kauai in December 2019. And earlier that year, three people were killed when a tour helicopter crashed and caught fire on a street in Kailua on the island of Oahu, officials said. Overall, Hawaii has the highest number of deaths from air tour crashes in the nation, with more than 85 killed since the NTSB began keeping records, Hawaii Senator Brian Schatz said in a news release in May announcing new safety provisions for the air tour industry included in the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2024. Following Thursday\u2019s crash, the FAA enacted a temporary flight restriction in the area as the search is ongoing.

{"id": "2024_07_14_politics_joe-biden-trump-campaign", "text": "President Joe Biden and his campaign are facing an abrupt pivot point: After spending the last two weeks trying to salvage the president\u2019s reelection bid, they are now grappling with a delicate national moment following the attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump. The Biden campaign and Democrats across the party scrambled Sunday to determine how to adjust their plans to counter messaging at the Republican National Convention, which had been in the works for some time. \u201cThe big issue is how to campaign against him or attack him,\u201d a senior Democratic adviser told CNN. \u201cCan we even do that this week?\u201d The adviser said discussions were underway to calibrate jabs and criticism aimed at Trump to focus on policy differences, rather than personal attacks. Plans that had been underway for weeks to respond to the GOP convention are being reviewed and potentially adjusted. In the hours following the attempted assassination, which killed one spectator and injured two others, both Biden and Trump called for unity. In a rare Oval Office address Sunday night, Biden called on the country to \u201clower the temperature in our politics.\u201d \u201cWhile we disagree,\u201d Biden said, \u201cwe are not enemies. We\u2019re neighbors.\u201d Hours before the shooting at the Trump rally, Biden had been trying to assuage concerns among members of his own party by participating in calls with key groups of lawmakers \u2013 some of whom were still unconvinced about his viability as a candidate. But the campaign\u2019s focus took a sudden turn as news of the shooting in Butler, Pennsylvania, took hold. Stunned Biden campaign officials huddled\u00a0and decided to pause all outbound\u00a0communications and pull\u00a0down TV\u00a0ads. The campaign urged\u00a0staff in a memo to\u00a0\u201crefrain from issuing any comments on social media or in public.\u201d Sources described the mood within the White House and the Biden campaign as \u201cshock\u201d as they put their response into motion. The president was attending mass in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware \u2013 where he has a residence \u2013 at the time the shots rang out. He briefly addressed the nation hours after \u2013 a choice he made shortly after being briefed on the incident, according to a source familiar with the matter. \u201cWe cannot allow for this to be happening. We cannot be like this,\u201d he said. Biden then returned to the White House late Saturday, ditching plans to remain in Rehoboth for the weekend. The Biden campaign has yet to decide when to resume its advertising campaign against Trump after pulling the ads on Saturday. But that, a separate Democratic strategist said, was the easy decision. A harder question is how and when to resume, with 114 days until the election. Chief among the difficulties for the Biden camp will be recalibrating a message that\u2019s appropriate for the moment after a month when the team directed more forceful rhetoric against Biden\u2019s predecessor, especially on his criminal conviction. Sen. Chris\u00a0Coons, a close Biden ally and co-chair of the Biden reelection campaign, called for a lowering of the political temperature. \u201cWe have to reduce the rhetoric and the tone. I\u2019d urge folks to turn off their phones and get off of social media today. And take some time with your family and reflect on who we are as a nation and who we want to be,\u201d the Delaware senator said Sunday on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d The president briefly addressed reporters Sunday afternoon, his second time appearing in front of cameras since the shooting, and announced he would be speaking a third time later in the evening from the Oval Office. The president urged people not to make assumptions and to \u201clet the FBI do their job,\u201d stressing that the shooter\u2019s motivations were still being investigated. He emphasized that Trump \u201calready received a heightened level of security\u201d in his capacity as both a former president and the presumptive Republican Party nominee, and noted that he has \u201cbeen consistent in my direction to the Secret Service to provide him with every resource, capability, protective measure necessary to ensure his continued safety.\u201d Biden added that he has ordered the Secret Service to review its plans for the Republican National Convention that begins on Monday. He\u2019s also ordered an independent review of the security at Saturday\u2019s rally to discover how the attempted assassination was able to take place. \u201cThere is no place in America for this kind of violence or any violence for that matter. An assassination attempt is contrary to everything we stand for as a nation,\u201d Biden said, sending his condolences to the family of the man who was killed at the rally and his well wishes to Trump. \u201cUnity is the most elusive goal of all, but nothing is important as that right now. We\u2019ll debate and we\u2019ll disagree. That\u2019s not going to change. But it\u2019s going \u2013 we\u2019re not going to lose sight of the fact who we are as Americans.\u201d In the Oval Office later Sunday, Biden reiterated his belief that the stakes in the upcoming election \u201care incredibly high.\u201d But the president added: \u201cPolitics must never be a literal battlefield, and God forbid, a killing field.\u201d The attempted assassination of Biden\u2019s opponent also challenges two central\u00a0goals\u00a0of his presidency and candidacy:\u00a0To heal a politically fraught nation and to restore faith in America\u2019s democracy. Around the world,\u00a0condemnation of the shooting came from Canada to China to the Kremlin, as allies and adversaries alike watched the US\u2019 deep divisions on display. Biden has pitched the race as the decision between the continuation and possible destruction of democracy in the United States. That rhetoric will now be closely examined in the aftermath of the attack, including comments that the president made in a call with donors on July 8, during which he said, \u201cIt\u2019s time to put Trump in the bullseye,\u201d according to a summary of the call provided by his campaign. While public calls for Biden to step aside following his poor debate performance two weeks ago have cooled in the immediate aftermath of the attack, the concerns voiced directly to the president in calls on Saturday have hardly gone away. A White House official said Sunday the president would continue his outreach to lawmakers and supporters but would turn his immediate focus to his presidential duties of directing the government\u2019s response to the first assassination attempt of a former president or presidential candidate in more than four decades. Over the course of Sunday morning, the president and Vice President Kamala Harris were briefed by senior homeland security and local law enforcement officials, including Attorney General Merrick Garland and Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. As Biden\u2019s top advisers briefed him in the Situation Room on the shooting, the president\u2019s political team was grappling with whether planned travel to Nevada should proceed, according to an official. The White House announced Biden was postponing a planned trip to Texas on Monday. Biden is also set to be interviewed by NBC\u2019s Lester Holt for a primetime special airing Monday evening. Harris has already postponed a planned trip to Florida in response to the assassination attempt, according to a Biden-Harris campaign official. She originally planned on traveling to Palm Beach, Florida, on Tuesday for a moderated conversation alongside Republican women to discuss Trump\u2019s stance on women\u2019s reproductive rights. After being briefed on the incident on Saturday, the vice president denounced the \u201csenseless\u201d shooting and said she is relieved Trump was not seriously injured.

The 4-year-old girl was found dead and the 6-year-old suffered injuries.

Both Callihan and Cox, who were arrested on June 13 and June 14, were also indicted by a grand jury in Louisiana in the case last month. An attorney representing Callihan on the charges in Louisiana told CNN he could not comment on the indictment in Mississippi. CNN could not locate legal representation for Callihan in Mississippi.

An initial investigation indicates the toddler\u2019s father arrived home while she was asleep in the car, and he left her there with the vehicle running and the air conditioner on while he went inside his home, according to police in Marana, located just outside Tucson. Her mother eventually arrived home, and shortly afterward the child was discovered unresponsive inside the car, which was no longer running and had the air conditioning off, police said. Someone called 911, and firefighters and Marana police arrived shortly after 4 p.m., police said. The girl was left in the car for about 30 minutes to an hour before she was found, police told CNN affiliate KNXV. Resuscitation efforts were done on the child and she was transported to a hospital, where she was pronounced dead, according to police. Marana police detectives were granted a search warrant Tuesday night and an investigation into the death is ongoing, police said. \u201cWe are doing our interviews with the dad, any witnesses, neighbors, to determine if the car was still running, if the AC was still operational,\u201d Marana police Capt. Tim Brunenkant told CNN affiliate KPNX. \u201cAll we know is it was a hot car and the child was unresponsive, it was very hot, and it\u2019s very tragic.\u201d Afternoon air temperatures in the Marana area on Tuesday ranged from 102 to 108 degrees, according to\u00a0the National Weather Service. Much of the western and southern US has been experiencing a long-lasting heat wave that has led to numerous daily high temperature records and\u00a0caused deaths. In Omaha, Nebraska, police say they are investigating the death of a 5-year-old boy after they found the child Wednesday unresponsive inside of a vehicle. It appeared he had been left there for an extended period of time, police said. The area\u2019s high temperature that day was 89 degrees, according to the National Weather Service. Ten children have died as a result of being in a hot vehicle in the US this year, according to\u00a0NoHeatStroke.org, a website that tracks hot car deaths and is run by a San Jose State University lecturer. Since 1998, 44 children have died from vehicular heatstroke in Arizona, according to the National Safety Council. On average, 37 children under the age of 15 die each year from heatstroke after being left in a hot vehicle, the council says. In 2023, 29 child hot car deaths were reported in the US, according to the council. Since 1998, the highest annual number of children known to have died after being left in a hot vehicle was 53, recorded in both 2018 and 2019, according to the council. A child\u2019s body temperature rises three to five times faster than an adult\u2019s, and children can die when their body temperature reaches 107 degrees, according to the\u00a0National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.

She was 96. The diminutive, grandmotherly Westheimer was a leading advocate of sexual education for decades, dispensing colorful, witty advice in her distinctive German accent. \u201cDr. Ruth\u201d \u2013 as she was more commonly known \u2013 died while her two children sat alongside at her home Friday around 11:30 p.m., Lehu said. Westheimer\u2019s first radio call-in show, \u201cSexually Speaking,\u201d debuted in New York in 1980 and proved so popular that it quickly became syndicated around the country. It also catapulted her to TV fame in the mid-1980s with her eponymous \u201cThe \u201cDr. Ruth Show,\u201d on the Lifetime network. Over the next several decades, she hosted a handful of other TV shows in which Westheimer took calls from fans around the country and spoke candidly about a wide range of taboo sexual topics. She ended many of her shows by urging her audience to \u201chave good sex!\u201d Westheimer appeared on programs aimed at the general education of children and teens and became a cultural figure, authoring more than 37 books and becoming a regular guest on late-night talk shows. She continued to joyfully dole out sex advice to the public well into her 90s. The therapist was appointed in 2023 as New York state\u2019s honorary ambassador to loneliness, a role that was the first of its kind in the nation. Westheimer wrote a book on loneliness, outlining 100 ways to beat loneliness and live a happier and more meaningful life, that will be released posthumously in September, according to the book publisher\u2019s\u00a0website. Westheimer, who was Jewish, was born in Germany in 1928. When she was 10, on the eve of World War II, Westheimer was sent to Switzerland by her parents. Her mother and father perished during the Holocaust, and Westheimer has said she believed they were killed at Auschwitz. As a teenager, Westheimer lived in Jerusalem and trained as a sniper with the Haganah, a\u00a0controversial\u00a0Zionist\u00a0militant\u00a0group which later became\u00a0part of\u00a0the\u00a0Israel Defense Forces. In her 20s, Westheimer studied in Paris and then immigrated to New York City, where she attended graduate school, eventually earning a degree from Teachers College at Columbia University. Westheimer was a member of the Museum of Jewish Heritage and regularly funded and attended events related to Holocaust remembrance. \u201cTo allow the joy to come front and center in your life, you also have to feel your emotions, even the sad ones,\u201d she wrote in her 2015 book, \u201cThe Doctor Is In: Dr. Ruth on Love, Life, and Joie de Vivre.\u201d \u201cYou have to mourn, let the tears pour out.

However, investigators are also not ruling out the possibility, and if anyone has evidence that would suggest this is a hate crime, he said, authorities will investigate it. Likens\u2019\u00a0relatives had been searching for the teen for several days when police began finding dismembered human remains in and near the Shenango River Lake in Mercer County, the criminal complaint said. Mercer County Coroner John A. Libonati said in a July 3 statement the remains belonged to\u00a0Likens. The cause of death was determined to be sharp force trauma to the head and the manner was ruled as homicide, Libonati said. Pamela Ladner, president of\u00a0LGBTQIA+ Alliance Shenango Valley who spoke on behalf of\u00a0the teen\u2019s\u00a0family, told CNN\u00a0Likens \u201cwas a selfless, loving child who loved nature, getting her nails done, and shopping.\u201d \u201cShe aspired to be a\u00a0park\u00a0ranger like her Aunt Liz,\u201d\u00a0Ladner said.\u00a0\u201cOur community is mourning with Pauly\u2019s family at this tragic loss of young life. We are hoping justice is served.\u201d Likens\u00a0was last seen walking home on June 22 after leaving a friend\u2019s house, police said in the complaint.\u00a0In the early hours of June 23, the teenager posted on Snapchat that she had gone on a late-night walk. She replied\u00a0initially\u00a0when her friend asked if she was OK but did not reply to further messages, the complaint said. Video surveillance from\u00a0nearby\u00a0businesses and homes showed a person that appeared to be Likens\u00a0walking near a canoe launch along the Shenango River in Sharon, as well as a vehicle arriving and leaving the area around the same time on June 23, according to the complaint. Police said Watkins, the suspect, was seen in video footage leaving a nearby apartment complex with a large duffel bag that appeared empty and returning about 20 to 25 minutes later with the bag looking \u201cheavy and awkward,\u201d the complaint says.\u00a0Video shows a vehicle leaving the apartment complex, arriving to the canoe launch area and returning to the complex during the same time frame,\u00a0the complaint states. The footage shows Watkins struggling to carry the duffle bag and placing it on the floor\u00a0of a hallway in the building, and then again\u00a0before entering an apartment, the complaint said. He\u2019s also seen coming to the apartment later that day with a shopping bag and leaving with multiple bags\u00a0and garbage bags\u00a0the next day. When officers went to the building, they saw what appeared to be blood stains in the places where Watkins rested the bag on the floor, the complaint said. When Watkins was detained by police on July 2, he told authorities that he recently met with a person he had met on Grindr,\u00a0who\u00a0police said matched\u00a0Likens\u2019\u00a0description, according to the complaint. Watkins claimed his memory was poor when asked about where they met or where he had gone, the complaint said. He said the person did not come to his apartment and noted that he brought in a large rolling luggage\u00a0bag\u00a0that he had left in his car from a recent vacation, the complaint said.\u00a0When police searched Watkins\u2019\u00a0apartment, they found\u00a0traces of\u00a0blood,\u00a0a saw, and a receipt for the purchase of the tool, the complaint said. \u00a0 A candlelight vigil for\u00a0Likens\u00a0will be held in Sharon on Saturday.\u00a0The teenager is being remembered for her will to help others, her love of animals and her \u201ccontagious laughter,\u201d according to her obituary. \u201cPauly lit up every room she entered, always making people smile and passing around her contagious laughter.

{"id": "2024_07_14_us_trump-rally-gunman-thomas-crooks-invs", "text": "This November, Thomas Matthew Crooks was set to reach a political milestone: The first presidential election he was old enough to vote in. A 20-year-old living in a crucial swing state, Crooks had already shown potential signs of interest in politics, making a small political donation as a teenager and registering to vote just a week after he turned 18. But instead of casting his ballot this year, according to law enforcement, Crooks traveled an hour north of his home, climbed to the roof of a building, and opened fire on former President Donald Trump during a campaign rally \u2014 leaving him bloodied and coming inches away from killing him. Crooks\u2019 attack, which killed one spectator and critically injured two others, rocked American politics to its core, with elected officials from both sides of the aisle condemning the violence and warning of the dangers of the country\u2019s deep polarization. So far, investigators haven\u2019t found any evidence on social media or other writings by Crooks that might help identify his motive for the attempted assassination, law enforcement officials say. But CNN interviews with more than a half-dozen former classmates and neighbors of Crooks painted him as quiet and aloof, with classmates remembering him as a misfit in high school. And a review of public records suggests he may have had divergent political leanings, with Crooks registering to vote as a Republican but making a small donation to a Democratic-leaning group. Crooks lived in the Pittsburgh suburb of Bethel Park, about an hour\u2019s drive south of the Trump rally where law enforcement officials say he fired at the former president. Crooks graduated from Bethel Park High School in 2022, according to a local media report and a video of the school\u2019s graduation ceremony. Jason Kohler, 21, who went to the same high school, told CNN that Crooks was bullied by other students and seemed to be a loner. Crooks had \u201cno facial expression\u201d when he walked through the school hallways, Kohler said. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t, like, with the clique, so he always had, I guess, a target on his back.\u201d Another former student at the school, Sarah D\u2019Angelo, remembered Crooks as \u201ca quiet kid, not obviously political or violent in any way.\u201d She said the only time he spoke with her was when their class was waiting for their graduation ceremony to start. A third classmate, who asked not to be named, said that Crooks was very smart, took honors classes, and was shy. She said that he had a group of friends who were fairly conservative, some of whom would wear Trump hats. \u201cThere was definitely chatter about him just looking a little different,\u201d the classmate said of Crooks. \u201cAlmost a retro nerd vibe.\u201d Crooks\u2019 high school experience was interrupted by the pandemic, with students being out of school for months in 2020 and allowed to study remotely after that, the classmate said \u2013 and she added that she didn\u2019t recall seeing him much during their sophomore or junior years. When she heard that Crooks was identified as the Trump rally shooter, the classmate said, \u201cI was just, like, shocked \u2014 I just couldn\u2019t believe he did something that bold, considering he was such a quiet and kept-to-himself kind of person.\u201d The gun Crooks used in the shooting was an AR-style weapon, according to a person familiar with the investigation. According to law enforcement officials, the gun was traced to Crooks\u2019 father, which helped to determine the gunman\u2019s identity because he was not carrying identification. When reached by CNN late Saturday night, Crooks\u2019 father, Matthew Crooks, said he was trying to figure out \u201cwhat the hell is going on\u201d but would \u201cwait until I talk to law enforcement\u201d before speaking about his son. He could not be reached again on Sunday. Federal Election Commission records show that a donor listed as Thomas Crooks with the gunman\u2019s street address gave $15 to Progressive Turnout Project, a Democratic-aligned political action committee, on Inauguration Day in January 2021, when Crooks was 17. A spokesperson for Progressive Turnout Project said in an email that the group had received the donation \u201cin response to an email about tuning into the inauguration\u201d and that \u201cthe email address associated with the contribution only made the one contribution and was unsubscribed from our lists 2 years ago.\u201d \u201cWe unequivocally condemn political violence in all of its forms, and we denounce anyone who chooses violence over peaceful political action,\u201d the spokesperson wrote. Later that year, a week after turning 18, Crooks registered to vote as a Republican, according to a listing in Pennsylvania\u2019s voter database that matched his name, age and address. Crooks only cast a ballot once, in the 2022 midterm general election, an Allegheny County spokesperson told CNN. Both of Crooks\u2019 parents worked as social workers, according to state license records. His father is registered to vote as a Libertarian and his mother is registered as a Democrat, state voter records show. Crooks fired on Trump while perched on a nearby building rooftop outside the rally\u2019s security perimeter, before being killed by Secret Service agents, according to law enforcement officials. Law enforcement descended on Crooks\u2019 family home on a quiet street in Bethel Park on Saturday night. Explosive material was found in his residence, as well as in his car, law enforcement officials familiar with the investigation told CNN. A brief video posted on Facebook by Crooks\u2019 school district in 2022 showed Crooks participating in a computer coding course and explaining a coding concept to a fellow student. Crooks can also be spotted sitting at the front of an economics class in a TV ad for the investment firm BlackRock that was filmed at his high school. The teachers featured in both the videos declined to comment. A spokesperson for the social media platform Discord said in a statement that it had identified an account that appears to be linked to Crooks. The account \u201cwas rarely utilized and we have found no evidence that it was used to plan this incident or discuss his political views,\u201d the spokesperson wrote. Crooks worked\u00a0as a dietary aide at\u00a0Bethel Park Skilled Nursing and Rehabilitation Center, a nursing home less than a mile from his family\u2019s home,\u00a0according to Marcie Grimm, the center\u2019s administrator. \u201cWe are shocked and saddened to learn of his involvement as Thomas Matthew Crooks performed his job without concern and his background check was clean,\u201d Grimm said in a statement. A colleague who worked with Crooks at the nursing home and who asked not to be named described him in an interview as \u201cthe sweetest guy.\u201d Just this week, the colleague said, the two of them worked together to find an easier way for nursing home residents to open ranch dressing packets, an act the colleague said was indicative of how caring Crooks was. \u201cThese stupid ranch packets in the kitchen \u2014 no one can ever open them,\u201d said the colleague, who also went to high school with Crooks. \u201cEarlier this week he was helping me with a bunch of sick old ladies (to) put ranch on their salads.\u201d Crooks, the colleague said, never expressed political views at work and wasn\u2019t \u201ca radical.\u201d They added: \u201cIt\u2019s hard seeing everything that\u2019s going on online because he was a really, really good person that did a really bad thing, and I just wish I knew why.\u201d Bethel Park is a predominantly white suburb that is wealthier than the surrounding Pittsburgh metro area. Dan Grzybek, a county council representative whose district includes Bethel Park, described it as politically mixed \u2014 according to county election records, President Joe Biden won the precinct that includes the Crooks\u2019 house with just 52% of the vote. Grzybek, who lives nearby, said he had had a \u201cvery pleasant\u201d conversation with the gunman\u2019s parents while canvassing for votes before he was elected last year. He described the community as \u201cincredibly safe\u201d and \u201cclose-knit,\u201d and said he hoped that the shooting was not \u201cwhat Bethel Park is remembered for.\u201d \u201cAll things like this do is increase the already extreme political polarization we experience, and increase the risk of future violence in retaliation,\u201d Grzybek said. Andrew Bianco, who lives two houses down the street from the Crooks family, agreed that the area was politically diverse, with some residents flying Trump flags and others displaying Biden ones. But he said he doesn\u2019t remember ever seeing political signage outside the Crooks\u2019 residence, and only saw the gunman\u2019s father when he stepped outside to mow the lawn. \u201cIf anything, you\u2019d be like, \u2018Does someone live there?\u2019\u201d Bianco said.

Alexa Stakely, 29, was picking up her 6-year-old child from her babysitter\u2019s apartment just before 1:30 a.m. ET on Thursday when she realized she needed to go back inside to get an item \u201cfrom the babysitter who she met just inside the front door,\u201d the police report stated. As she returned to her vehicle, authorities say Stakely saw someone starting to back her Honda SUV out of the driveway with her sleeping child still inside the vehicle.

{"id": "2024_07_13_us_john-e-mclauchlen-wwii-pilot-buried-trnd", "text": "A 25-year-old World War II pilot who went missing in action 80 years ago during a mission in southeast Asia was given full honors and laid to rest in Kansas earlier this week. Second Lt. John E. McLauchlen Jr., of Detroit, was killed during World War II in 1943 while flying during a bombing mission from Panagarh, India, to a railyard near Rangoon, Myanmar \u2013 then known as Burma, according to the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency. McLauchlen was officially accounted for on January 25, 2024, the agency said. He was buried at Fort Leavenworth National Cemetery on July 8 and honored with a B-1 bomber flyover, according to Fort Leavenworth. On December 1, 1943, McLauchlen\u2019s B-24J Liberator bomber plane reached the intended target but was struck by \u201canti-aircraft fire, causing the left wing to burst into flames,\u201d according to the accounting agency. \u201cMy uncle was in charge of the mission that day, so his plane was right in the front, right in the center,\u201d McLauchlen\u2019s nephew, Richard McLauchlen Jr., said in an interview with the US Army published Thursday. \u201cOnce they started taking fire, and with that smoking wing, my uncle decided to drop out of the formation so that his plane wouldn\u2019t cause anyone else to be shot down,\u201d Richard McLauchlen Jr., who is a Vietnam veteran, said. Witnesses from another plane said they saw the one flown by McLauchlen fall into a steep dive before disappearing beneath clouds, officials reported. \u201cIt was noted that (three) enemy aircraft were also seen following the crippled plane into the clouds, and no further contact was made with the Liberator,\u201d the agency said. \u201cThe remains of the crew were not recovered or identified after the war, and they were all later declared Missing In Action.\u201d McLauchlen served as a member of the 436th Bombardment Squadron, Seventh Bombardment Group in the Army Air Forces at the time of his disappearance. Four years later, the American Graves Registration Service found the remains of what were thought to be eight people involved in a potential B-24 Liberator crash near Yodayadet, Burma, according to the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency. The remains couldn\u2019t be identified scientifically at the time and were sent to Honolulu\u2019s National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific. The accounting agency said it received a family disinterment request in early 2019 for one of the unidentified people \u201cbased on past attempts to associate the remains with other unresolved losses from southern Burma,\u201d according to the release. The remains were exhumed in October 2020 and taken to a Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency laboratory for analysis, the agency said. Scientists used anthropological analysis and circumstantial and material evidence to identify McLauchlen, and the Armed Forces Medical Examiner System used mitochondrial DNA analysis. His nephew\u2019s DNA helped identify him, the US Army reported. \u201cHe was unknown for 80 years, and now he\u2019s here, he\u2019s home, and he\u2019ll never be lost again,\u201d Richard McLauchlen Jr. said of his uncle in the US Army interview. Genetic genealogy blends DNA analysis in the lab with genealogical research, such as tracing a person\u2019s family tree. Lauded as a way to explore personal history and connect with previously unknown kin, such DNA matching also has been used to link victims to criminals such as the Happy Face Killer, who murdered at least eight women, and to identify other long-missing military service members.

{"id": "2024_07_14_business_stocks-week-ahead-businesses-failing-bankruptcies", "text": "Small and mid-sized businesses are struggling to survive. Many have already gone under water this year. There were 346 companies that filed to either liquidate or re-organize through bankruptcy in the first six months of 2024, the highest half-year level since 2010 when 467 filed, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. Just last month, 75 companies filed for bankruptcy, which was the biggest monthly total since early 2020. The majority of businesses that have gone belly up are considered \u201cconsumer discretionary,\u201d a broad category of firms that sell goods or services that people don\u2019t need every day, such as restaurants, clothing stores and car dealerships. Most of the businesses are also considered small or mid-sized, economists and investors tell CNN. Interest rates are at their highest level in nearly a quarter century, which is squeezing not just for consumers, but also businesses that rely heavily on borrowing to purchase equipment, replenish inventory, meet payroll and/or expand operations, to name a few key reasons. Access to credit is especially crucial for small, private businesses that aren\u2019t able raise money through financial markets. It\u2019s also gotten harder for them to even take out a business loan to begin with these days. A recent Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City survey of 170 small businesses showed that \u201ccredit standards tightened for the tenth consecutive quarter and credit quality decreased.\u201d \u201cSmall companies are more at risk and more sensitive to higher borrowing costs,\u201d\u00a0Matt Rowe, head of portfolio management and cross asset strategies at\u00a0Nomura Capital Management, told CNN. \u201cThe increase in implied and actual defaults that the S&P report is referencing is largely coming from the smaller cap part of the world.\u201d Consumer demand has also been underwhelming so far this summer, according to the Institute for Supply Management\u2019s latest survey of businesses that sell any kind of service. The latest spending data and comments from retailers in recent months have also demonstrated that US consumers aren\u2019t splurging this summer, unlike last year, and are instead spending more cautiously. That\u2019s troubling because the summertime is a crucial season for many kinds of service-providing businesses. Last month, an arcade and a hotel management company filed for bankruptcy, according to the S&P Global report, also citing \u201csupply-chain issues\u201d as another possible reason behind the run-up in business bankruptcies. But this might not be an omen for future economic pain, it could just be an unwinding of pandemic-related distortions in the economy. \u201cThis is probably more a story of normalization than anything,\u201d Josh Jamner, investment strategy analyst at ClearBridge Investments, told CNN. \u201cThere were a number of programs out there to support small businesses during the depths of the pandemic, and there were relatively fewer filings than usual in 2021 and 2022.\u201d Rising corporate bankruptcies could just reflect a lot of churn occurring in Corporate America, Jamner said. New business applications took off in 2020 and have remained elevated ever since, he said. Last year, there were a record 5.5 million applications to start a new business, though that pace has slowed so far in 2024, according to government statistics. \u201cAs businesses are closing, we\u2019re still also seeing plenty of new ones being formed,\u201d he added. The Federal Reserve has kept interest rates at a 23-year high for about a year now in a bid to stamp out inflation. In good news for borrowers, inflation resumed a downward trend in the spring after stalling early this year, which is widening the path for the Fed to finally begin lowering borrowing costs sometime this year. Fed officials expect to cut interest rates at least once this year, which wouldn\u2019t provide huge immediate relief, but it would still be significant. \u201cStarting to cut rates is just as important for businesses and consumers as how much rates will ultimately be cut because it is setting in motion rate cuts, which is a good thing,\u201d\u00a0Reena Aggarwal, director of the\u00a0Georgetown University Psaros Center for Financial Markets and Policy, told CNN. \u201cThere\u2019s an important psychological impact of that because businesses won\u2019t have to worry about rates going up.\u201d Small-cap stocks gained ground last week after the latest Consumer Price Index came in weaker than expected, bolstering rate-cut prospects. Banks are threatening to end free checking. Don\u2019t panic Most banks offer free checking if, for instance, customers have their paycheck direct deposited or they maintain an average minimum balance, reports my colleague Jeanne Sahadi. The majority of people with checking accounts (73%) take advantage of the option, according to a 2023\u00a0Bankrate.com\u00a0survey. But if regulatory costs go up for banks, free services like checking may go away, at least if they follow Chase\u2019s lead. Marianne Lake, the head of Chase Bank, told the\u00a0Wall Street Journal\u00a0last week that Chase might stop offering free checking and other free banking services. \u201cConsumer banking is predicated on banks providing services for free to consumers such as checking accounts, debit cards and electronic bill paying. The model then relied on banks being able to recoup those costs elsewhere in the consumer banking business, such as with debit interchange fees, overdraft fees, late fees and higher interest rates,\u201d Jaret Seiberg, financial services analyst at TD Securities, wrote in an analysis of Lake\u2019s comments.

{"id": "2024_07_12_us_on-nyc-beaches-angry-birds-fight-drones-patrolling-for-sharks-and-struggling-swimmers-ap", "text": "A fleet of drones patrolling New York City\u2019s beaches for signs of sharks and struggling swimmers is drawing backlash from an aggressive group of seaside residents: local shorebirds. Since the drones began flying in May, flocks of birds have repeatedly swarmed the devices, forcing the police department and other city agencies to adjust their flight plans. While the attacks have slowed, they have not stopped completely, fueling concern from wildlife experts about the impact on threatened species nesting along the coast. Veronica  Welsh, a wildlife coordinator at the Parks Department, said the birds  were \u201cvery annoyed by the drones\u201d from the moment they arrived on the  beach. \u201cThey will fly at it, they\u2019ll swoop at it, they\u2019ll be  vocalizing,\u201d Welsh said. \u201cThey think they\u2019re defending their chicks from  a predator.\u201d No birds have been harmed, but officials say there have been several close calls. The drones, which come equipped with inflatable life rafts that can be dropped on distressed swimmers, have yet to conduct any rescues. They spotted their first shark on Thursday, resulting in a closure of most of the beach. City officials said the \u201cswarming incidents\u201d have been primarily carried out by American oystercatchers. The shorebird, known for its striking orange bill, lays its eggs this time of year in the sand on Rockaway Beach. While its population has improved in recent decades, federal authorities consider the species a \u201chigh conservation concern.\u201d The birds eventually may grow habituated to the devices, which can stretch over 3 feet (nearly a meter) long and emit a loud hum as they take flight, said David Bird, a professor of wildlife biology at McGill University. But he was quick to raise a far more dire possibility: that the  drones could prompt a stress response in some birds that causes them to  flee the beach and abandon their eggs, as several thousand elegant terns  did following a recent drone crash in San Diego. \u201cWe don\u2019t know a lot about what sort of distance is required to protect the birds,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we do know there are birds on this beach that are highly endangered. If they abandon their nests because of the drones, that would be a disaster.\u201d On Rockaway Beach, a popular summertime destination for New Yorkers, American oystercatchers share their habitat with multiple tern species of water birds, as well as piping plovers, a small, sand-colored bird that is the city\u2019s only federally designated endangered species. Local officials closely monitor the plovers each summer, barring beachgoers \u2014 and drones \u2014 from the stretches of sand where they primarily nest. The city\u2019s Emergency  Management Department, which also flies drones over the beach, flagged  the coastal conflict last month to other drone operators in the police  and fire department, who agreed to launch the devices further from  oystercatcher nesting areas. \u201cWe pointed out that there\u2019s a nest  here and there\u2019s two angry parents who don\u2019t want you anywhere near  their eggs or their babies,\u201d said Natalie Grybauskas, the agency\u2019s  assistant commissioner. Since then, agencies have been holding briefings on the issue, a departure from their usual work on disasters like fires and building collapses. \u201cIt\u2019s rare that you have to learn about the life cycles of baby birds,\u201d Grybauskas said. But even after the city adjusted its flight range, beachgoers said they witnessed groups of birds rushing at the drones. New York City is not alone turning to drones to patrol its waters. Following a spate of shark bites last summer, a similar effort  was launched by officials on Long Island. Those devices are smaller and  quieter and do not have flotation devices. In recent years, lifeguards  in Australia also have used drones to monitor sharks and to conduct  rescue operations. New York City Mayor Eric Adams, a devoted drone enthusiast,  has touted the new drone program as a \u201cgreat addition to saving the  lives of those that we lose over the summer,\u201d especially as the city  struggles to hire lifeguards to staff its beaches. Four people have drowned off city beaches this summer, matching the total number of swimming deaths from last year. After two teenagers disappeared while swimming off a beach adjacent to Rockaway, the NYPD flew its drones as part of the search mission. Both bodies eventually washed up on the shoreline. The fire department\u2019s drones also have captured footage of lifeguards assisting swimmers on Rockaway Beach struggling in a rip tide. Christopher  Allieri, founder of the NYC Plover Project, a bird protection group,  praised the city for taking an innovative approach to water safety. But  he stressed additional precautions were necessary to ensure the drones  weren\u2019t harming the shorebird population. \u201cWildlife in New York  is often an afterthought,\u201d he said. \u201cWe should be asking ourselves how  we can use this technology in a way that works for all New Yorkers, and  that includes those with feathers.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/12/us/on-nyc-beaches-angry-birds-fight-drones-patrolling-for-sharks-and-struggling-swimmers-ap/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/15/2024", "section": "us"}}

Investigators believe at least one person fired shots from the street into the nightclub on 27th Street North, where responding officers found multiple gunshot victims around 11 p.m. local time, Birmingham Officer Truman Fitzgerald said in a\u00a0video statement. Two women inside the nightclub and a man who was found on a sidewalk near the venue were pronounced dead at the scene, police said. Another man died at a hospital, according to Fitzgerald.

He was \u201cfunny and energetic\u201d and deeply loved his children, Harmon said. But her husband, D\u2019Vontaye Mitchell, will never see his children again: The 43-year-old died on June 30 after he was\u00a0pinned down by hotel security guards\u00a0outside a Hyatt Regency hotel in Milwaukee in an incident partially captured on video. \u201cI\u2019m angry about it,\u201d Harmon said of her husband\u2019s death. \u201cI\u2019m broken, empty, honestly.\u201d Police have referred four charges of felony murder in Mitchell\u2019s death to the district attorney\u2019s office, Milwaukee Police told CNN in a statement Friday. A homicide investigation is underway and the full results of Mitchell\u2019s autopsy are pending. William F. Sulton, an attorney for the Mitchell family, told CNN he is confident that the Milwaukee County District Attorney\u2019s office \u201cwill make the right decision\u201d and charge the hotel employees involved. \u201cI do believe criminal charges will be issued in this case,\u201d Sulton said, adding, \u201cI want to be very clear that this involves more than just four persons.\u201d \u201cMr. Mitchell was beaten with a broom by a front desk manager, who you see on camera,\u201d he said. \u201cYou see a third security official who could have intervened and stopped this.\u201d \u201cThere were so many opportunities, and at every turn, Hyatt staff attacked him,\u201d Sulton said. Sulton said that while Wisconsin does have a citizen\u2019s arrest law, it requires observation of an ongoing felony. \u201cThere was no crime committed by Mr. Mitchell at all. And in fact, we know that Mr. Mitchell was running away from a security officer who had attacked him, and that he was retreating the entire time,\u201d the attorney said. \u201cAnd despite Mr. Mitchell trying to retreat, which included leaving the hotel after seeking refuge there, that he was repeatedly beaten to the point in which he was killed.\u201d Sulton said he met with the Milwaukee County District Attorney\u2019s Office for several hours Wednesday and two hours Thursday morning to discuss the case. Aimbridge Hospitality, which operates the downtown hotel, has said that they suspended and then fired the \u201chotel associates\u201d involved in the incident. It\u2019s unclear how many employees were fired and if they include the security guards seen pinning Mitchell down. \u201cThe conduct we saw from several associates on June 30 violated our policies and procedures, and does not reflect our values as an organization or the behaviors we expect from our associates,\u201d Aimbridge Hospitality said in a Thursday statement about Mitchell\u2019s death. The case has sparked criticism and accusations of racism, particularly given the parallels between Mitchel\u2019s death and other instances in which Black men have died at the hands of police and other authority figures. May 25 marked the 4-year anniversary of George Floyd\u2019s murder by White police officer Derek Chauvin, igniting widespread protests across the country. What we know about Mitchell\u2019s death Many of the circumstances surrounding Mitchell\u2019s death remain unclear, including what led to his encounter with the security guards, how long it took officers to arrive on the scene, and what Mitchell was doing at the hotel. Police allege Mitchell \u201ccaused a disturbance,\u201d prompting security guards to escort him out of the hotel,\u00a0according to\u00a0a statement\u00a0from civil rights attorney Ben Crump, who is also representing the Mitchell family. Security guards and others then pinned Mitchell to the ground. Part of a video posted on social media shows Mitchell grunting and pleading with the guards, repeatedly saying \u201cplease\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d One guard, who appears to be White, can be heard saying \u201cstay down\u201d and \u201cstop fighting,\u201d as the others, who appear to be people of color, hold Mitchell down, the video shows. The same guard calls out to witnesses, \u201cThis is what happens when you go into the ladies room.\u201d The district attorney\u2019s office is awaiting the full results of Mitchell\u2019s autopsy, which will help inform the police investigation into his death and allow the office to evaluate what happened before his death \u201cfrom the perspective of potential criminal liability,\u201d District Attorney John Chisholm said Wednesday in a statement. Crump, in a statement posted on X last week, said: \u201cIt is deeply troubling that we have lost another Black man in an encounter with security personnel, raising serious concerns about the use of force, lack of accountability, and absence of mental health considerations.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/13/us/dvontaye-mitchell-milwaukee-wisconsin-death/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/15/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "business_economy_transgender-americans-economy", "text": "Quinn Merriss, an 18-year-old who identifies as transgender and non-binary, barely makes ends meet. Merriss was kicked out of their home after years of tension and arguments with their parents over being transgender. They now live independently without any financial support from relatives, working as a server earning $5.50 an hour plus tips. \u201cI\u2019m living paycheck to paycheck,\u201d Merriss, who lives in an apartment in Cincinnati, told CNN. They manage to scrape by thanks to a housing assistance program, Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Merriss\u2019 plight illustrates the harsh economic realities of millions of Americans who identify as transgender and/or non-binary. The evidence from research and surveys is unmistakable: People whose gender identity does not match their sex at birth are more likely to experience financial hardships than the general population. (Some transgender people identify as \u201cnon-binary,\u201d which means they don\u2019t conform to one particular gender.) They deal with \u201clower employment rates, lower household incomes, higher rates of poverty, greater public assistance use, and increased likelihood of food insecurity,\u201d a 2022 study found. There are at least 5.3 million individuals who identify as transgender and/or non-binary in the United States, about the size of the Phoenix metropolitan area, according to the Pew Research Center. In interviews with CNN, economists, researchers and transgender people themselves say \u201ctransphobia,\u201d or negative beliefs and attitudes about trans people, is to blame. Transitioning genders can also cost tens of thousands of dollars, and being in the closet is well documented to take a toll on mental health. What the statistics show The dire economic straits of transgender and non-binary people hasn\u2019t been explored for very long, though much has been uncovered in recent decades. \u201cWe know that transgender people have been experiencing so many economic disparities ever since there has been data collected on them, going back 30 or 40 years,\u201d said Kevin Nadal, a distinguished professor of psychology at City University of New York\u2019s Graduate Center. \u201cIf you see a trans person and they make you feel uncomfortable, that\u2019s because you either haven\u2019t been exposed to them much before or because you have very rigid ideas about gender,\u201d Nadal said. Pew has also found that most Americans believe that a person\u2019s gender is determined by their sex at birth, but favor protecting them from discrimination. The United States Transgender Survey, conducted by the National Center for Transgender Equality, is releasing full results from \u201can unprecedented\u201d 92,329 respondents later this year, its latest iteration since the previous survey in 2015. A preliminary analysis showed that living and working conditions remain as tough as ever. More than a third of transgender people surveyed (34%) said they were experiencing poverty, and 30% said they\u2019ve been homeless at least once in their lives. The unemployment rate among the transgender people surveyed was 18%, more than four times the current national rate. The Census Bureau puts the poverty line for a single person at $14,880 in 2022, the year of the survey. The pivotal role of family support A person\u2019s family plays a crucial role in their financial health, economists say, even with something as simple as providing shelter in adolescence or early adulthood. That safety net is often non-existent for transgender people. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot about how you start out in life,\u201d said Jody Herman, senior scholar of public policy at the Williams Institute at the University of California, Los Angeles. \u201cWe\u2019ve found that trans people who had been kicked out of their homes or had family rejection experiences were more likely to be in an unstable economic position.\u201d Jay Woodman, a 29-year-old transgender man, fled his immediate family in Greenville, South Carolina, about six years ago with his partner, Alexander Taylor. The couple is currently living with Taylor\u2019s parents in southern Maryland. Woodman said he has \u201cno contact\u201d with any of his relatives after it became clear they don\u2019t support his gender identity. \u201cUnless you have financial help in some way from parents, grandparents or friends, forget about buying a house in this area,\u201d Woodman said. \u201c(Alexander) and I were even priced out of a trailer community with how bad our financial situation was a few short years ago, when he was a full time office assistant and music instructor and I worked a part-time minimum wage food service job because it was all I could get at the time.\u201d The US housing market has been notoriously tough for years, with rents rising faster than incomes and home prices recently soaring to a record high as mortgage rates remain painfully elevated. First-time buyers often receive financial assistance from family to purchase a home, according to a realtor.com survey. Many parents also help pay for higher education. Research shows that\u2019s simply not the case for most transgender and non-binary people. Merriss said they dream of attending college but have put that on hold to work full time. Disrespect while on the job is par for the course Sarah Elizabeth Isbell, 62, began to transition from male to female in 2000, eventually getting gender reassignment surgery in 2008. Isbell currently works in an administrative support role at a nonprofit organization, but she holds a law degree from the University of Oklahoma. Isbell said she worked at a civil rights law firm in the late 2000s, after she already began to transition, but got fired shortly after a humiliating incident at the workplace. \u201cI showed up to work one day wearing sandals with my toes painted red and I got ridiculed by the boss, a female boss, in front of the whole office at lunch,\u201d Isbell said. \u201cShe said \u2018Would you go to court that way?\u2019 and when I said that I don\u2019t see an issue\u2026 She just let into me relentlessly about how men can\u2019t dress like that.\u201d \u201cThat was really mortifying,\u201d she added. Isbell said she has struggled to find another job as a lawyer. \u201cI did civil rights law. But after my transition, even my civll rights lawyer friends didn\u2019t want to hire me. I kept being told that juries and clients with cases in front of juries won\u2019t accept a transgender trial lawyer,\u201d she said. in 2020, the Supreme Court ruled in a landmark civil rights case that employers are prohibited from discriminating against LGBTQ employees. The case before the nation\u2019s highest court, Bostock v. Clayton County, was a consolidation of three similar cases around the country. One of them was brought by Aimee Stephens, who came out as a transgender woman in 2013 while working as a funeral director in a suburb near Detroit. She informed her employer in a letter that she would be coming in dressed as a woman and was fired shortly after, which led to Stephens\u2019 lawsuit. Stephens passed away a month before the Supreme Court\u2019s decision. \u201cTrans folks have been protected (at the workplace) under federal law for four years now, but it\u2019s not clear how well that\u2019s working,\u201d Michael Martell, an economics professor at Bard College, told CNN. \u201cTrans people face stigma throughout their lives, so it\u2019s certainly fair to say that labor market discrimination is a contributing factor to their disadvantages in life.\u201d The early report of the US Transgender Survey showed that 11% of respondents said they had been fired, forced to resign or been laid off because of their gender identity or expression. And transgender people say they still deal with disrespect while on the job. A common issue for transgender people is being misgendered, or referred to with terms that don\u2019t reflect their chosen gender identity, which is sometimes done by accident and other times purposefully. Merriss, Woodman and Isbell all said they\u2019ve been misgendered at the workplace. A wave of anti-transgender bills across states A historic wave of bills in state legislatures across the nation aims to ban access to gender-affirming health care for transgender youth and regulate curricula in public schools, including discussions on gender identity. Last year, there were at least 510 anti-LGBTQ bills introduced by lawmakers in various states, most of them controlled by Republicans, according to American Civil Liberties Union data. That set a record and was nearly three times the number of similar bills introduced in 2022. More than two-thirds of the 167 anti-LGBTQ bills introduced last year related to health care were aimed at blocking trans minors from getting gender-affirming care. According to Trans Legislation Tracker, 40 anti-trans state bills have so far been signed into law this year, in addition to eight that have been passed by lawmakers but haven\u2019t been approved or vetoed by a governor yet. Despite the economic struggles and hostile political landscape across the country, researchers and transgender people say that being your authentic self is invaluable. An overwhelming 94% of respondents in the latest US Transgender Survey said they \u201creported that they were either \u2018a lot more satisfied\u2019 or \u2018a little more satisfied\u2019 with their life\u201d after transitioning genders. \u201cIt\u2019s awful some days, but I would not give up being this way,\u201d Merriss said. \u201cI\u2019ve gotten away from the family toxic environment, and it\u2019s been so helpful seeing celebrities and characters in media being portrayed positively as a trans person.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/business/economy/transgender-americans-economy/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/15/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_07_14_politics_corey-comperatore-trump-shooting-victim", "text": "Firefighter Corey Comperatore was killed during the attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro said Sunday. Comperatore was one of the thousands of people who attended the rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, part of Trump\u2019s 2024 reelection effort. He died trying to protect his family, according to the governor. Pennsylvania State Police confirmed his identity on Sunday. \u201cCorey was a husband, a father, a volunteer firefighter, a hero sheltering his family from those bullets. We should all hold his family and all those injured in our prayers,\u201d President Joe Biden said in an address from the Oval Office on Sunday night. Authorities have\u00a0identified the gunman\u00a0in Saturday\u2019s\u00a0attack\u00a0as 20-year-old\u00a0Thomas Matthew Crooks, who was killed by Secret Service agents at the scene after the shooting. The FBI is investigating the attack as an assassination attempt, the agency said. \u201cI just spoke to Corey\u2019s wife and Corey\u2019s two daughters,\u201d Shapiro said Sunday. \u201cCorey was an avid supporter of the former president and was so excited to be there last night with him in the community,\u201d the governor said. \u201cI asked Corey\u2019s wife if it would be okay for me to share that we spoke. She said \u2018yes.\u2019 She also asked that I share with all of you that Corey died a hero,\u201d Shapiro added. \u201cCorey dove on his family to protect them last night at this rally.\u201d \u201cCorey was a girl dad. Corey was a firefighter. Corey went to church every Sunday. Corey loved his community. Most especially, Corey loved his family,\u201d said Shapiro. Shapiro said he has directed flags be flown at half-staff in Comperatore\u2019s memory. In addition to Comperatore, two people were critically injured in the incident, according to Pennsylvania State Police. David Dutch, 57, of New Kensington, Pennsylvania, and James Copenhaver, 74, of Moon Township, Pennsylvania, are in stable condition, state police said in a press release. The Marine Corps League of Pennsylvania, Inc. identified Dutch as a commandant in their organization\u2019s location in Westmoreland County. Vice Commandant Matt Popovich said on Facebook that Dutch underwent two surgeries after being \u201cshot in the liver and chest.\u201d \u201cThese victims and their families are certainly in our thoughts today,\u201d said state police commissioner Col. Christopher Paris. \u201cThe Pennsylvania State Police continue to work tirelessly alongside our federal, state and local partners as this investigation continues.\u201d The former president was shot in his right ear, he said on social media, leaving his face covered in blood. A GoFundMe campaign for the victims\u2019 families, verified by the fundraising platform, had raised over $3 million by Sunday afternoon, more than triple its initial goal. More than 42,000 donations have poured in, according to the website. Speaking Sunday afternoon, President Joe Biden expressed his condolences to the Comperatore\u2019s family. \u201cWe also extend our deepest condolences to the family of the victim who was killed,\u201d the president said. \u201cHe was a father; he was protecting his family from the bullets being fired when he lost his life. God love him. We are also praying for the full recovery of those who were injured.\u201d Shots fired, then \u2018a bloody scene\u2019 Witnesses have described a wave of chaos and terror that unfolded after the shooter, perched on a rooftop just outside the venue, fired several shots from an AR-style weapon. As shots rang out and the former president ducked below the podium, swarmed by Secret Service agents, attendees screamed and crouched toward the ground, video from the scene shows. \u201cIt was just the scariest thing, there was not a lot of places you could hide there,\u201d witness Amber DiFrischia told CNN. DiFrischia and her husband, Mike captured video of the moment the shooter fired his gun. The video shows the gunman laying on the rooftop with his weapon drawn, and eventually shows the gunman deceased. When the couple realized he had a gun, Amber said she immediately began yelling at officers and pointing to where he was located. The couple said that many of the officers were too close to the building to see the gunman on the roof. Mike saw one officer attempt to climb onto the roof, but the officer eventually fell back to the ground. GOP Congressman Dan Meuser told CNN he was sitting in the front row of the rally with Pennsylvania Senate candidate Dave McCormick and Republican Rep. Mike Kelly. He saw a man fatally shot \u201cno more than 20 feet behind\u201d them, he said. Joseph Meyn, a surgeon from Grove City, Pennsylvania, told CNN that he helped carry a man\u2019s body out of the stadium. \u201cEverybody started, certainly, screaming, asking for a medic, and honestly, it was a bloody scene,\u201d Meuser said. He was to the far right of the podium, filming Trump\u2019s speech, when he heard the gunshots. \u201cJust as I was panning back, I heard seven gunshots in rapid succession, in under two or three seconds. I am familiar with guns, I knew immediately it was gunfire,\u201d Meyn told CNN. \u201cI saw him get hit.\u201d Meyn said he looked back in the direction the gunshots had come from. \u201cI saw a man in the bleachers was hit directly in the head \u2026 there was a woman who was hit in the hand and forearm, a noncritical wound.\u201d He said he went over to see if he could render any aid, but another doctor was already tending to the woman who\u2019d been shot. \u201cI helped carry the body of the man out of the stands,\u201d he said. \u201cThey took the body to the tent behind the bleachers.\u201d Republican Rep. Ronny Jackson of Texas said that his nephew was also injured in the shooting. In an interview with Fox News, Jackson said his nephew \u201cwas grazed in the neck, a bullet crossed his neck, cut his neck and he was bleeding.\u201d The congressman called it a \u201chorrific, horrific experience.\u201d Another attendee who witnessed the shooting described an atmosphere of \u201ccomplete shock.\u201d \u201cIt was too close for comfort,\u201d Donna Hutz told CNN. She and her son were just a few rows in front of the attendees who were shot. She looked up and saw the injured attendees with lots of blood covering the bleachers, she said. The shooting created shockwaves around the world, with international leaders including Biden, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and the Vatican condemning the attack and political violence more broadly. Authorities are still investigating both the shooter\u2019s possible motives and how he was able to access the area with a weapon. \u201cIt is surprising, but all the details of that will come out in the investigation,\u201d FBI Special Agent in Charge Kevin Rojek said in a news conference when asked how the shooter was able to fire several shots.
