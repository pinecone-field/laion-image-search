But halfway through the ride, the mood changes and they reveal their identity. \u201cPull over here. It\u2019s you. You are in trouble for driving an Uber,\u201d the passenger tells his driver, during one of a few recent encounters captured in video and circulated online in Hong Kong. The passengers aren\u2019t traffic cops. They are vigilante taxi drivers taking direct action, having become increasingly frustrated about Hong Kong authorities\u2019 failure to regulate the ride-hailing platform. After the car pulls over, they hand over the driver, often still reeling in shock, to the police officers they have called. \u201cYou may say this is provocative. But without these videos, people may think we inflate the numbers of \u2018white-plate vehicles\u2019 out there,\u201d one of the taxi drivers who took part in a sting operation, and asked to be only identified as Ka Chun, told CNN. \u201cWhite-plate vehicles\u201d is how taxi drivers colloquially refer to Uber. \u201cWe just want the government to enforce the law.\u201d Uber (UBER) remains technically illegal in Hong Kong, which it entered in 2014. But it has thrived under the ambiguous approach of officials keen to project an image of technological modernity. \u201cUber is often framed as innovation, which seems to contribute to the \u2018smart city\u2019 vision \u2013 something that the Hong Kong government has strived to be,\u201d said Oliver Chan, an assistant communications studies professor who specializes in the gig economy at Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK). Ads for the US-headquartered company are widespread, and its drivers are highly unlikely to face problems with the authorities. Taxi drivers have for years complained about how Uber has flouted local laws, upended the market, and chipped away their already modest earnings. But their recent acts of vigilantism appear to have backfired. Instead of rallying public support, the cabbies were on the receiving end of a backlash, with passengers taking to social media to share their bad experiences of rude taxi drivers, ride rejections and opportunistic charging during heavy rains and the city\u2019s regular summer typhoons. \u201cThey charge arbitrarily and refuse to take passengers. And yet, they have the audacity to go on sting operations,\u201d one person wrote on LIHKG, a popular local internet forum, adding: \u201cShameless people know no bounds.\u201d Others have retaliated by reporting law-breaking taxi drivers to police. Pictures of taxis parking in restricted areas flooded the internet in posts calling for people to report them. WhatsApp groups set up by Uber drivers also discuss how to retaliate, one driver told CNN. So tense is the backlash that Hong Kong leader John Lee, when asked about the furor by reporters last week, acknowledged the \u201cfierce public debate\u201d and appealed for calm. He urged taxi drivers to stay away from any vigilante acts. As with New York\u2019s amber-painted medallion taxis and London\u2019s black hackney cabs, Hong Kong\u2019s 15,000 red urban taxis are emblematic of the city. But they are not exactly known for their friendliness or reliable service. Passenger Lau Chi-tim recalled being charged double during a typhoon a few years ago. Drivers often charge a little more because their insurance does not cover extreme weather conditions. But Lau said: \u201cThe trip lasted only 15 minutes and most of the journey was inside a tunnel anyway. Where is the risk?\u201d Another passenger lamented how selective taxi drivers can be. \u201cPeople with pets, a pram, wanting to cross the harbor, or going anywhere that may be crowded\u2026 they just reject you,\u201d Jason Chan said. Similar complaints abound, despite refusal to take passengers being an offense under the Hong Kong law. Those who prefer Uber see it as an alternative to the poor service they have long tolerated and would rather pay a little more for a smoother ride. An Uber driver, who gave only his name Mo for fear of being identified by authorities, said passengers told him they preferred Uber drivers\u2019 manners, and quality of driving. \u201cWe don\u2019t dare swerve around on the road because it\u2019s our own vehicle,\u201d he said. But for Ka Chun, the driver who went undercover, it\u2019s about defending their interest and an institution that he and his fellow cabbies invested time and money to be part of. \u201cThey have an impact on us because these white-plate vehicles can take passengers without a taxi license,\u201d he said, speaking of a permit that can cost a fortune in the city where properties, and even parking spaces, are traded as speculative commodities. Hong Kong\u2019s transport authority has issued some 18,000 taxi licenses \u2013 including for non-urban blue and green cabs - and they are currently traded for up to $400,000 (HK$3.2 million) in a free market. Annual insurance for a taxi also costs up to 10 times that for private vehicles. Drivers who don\u2019t own a taxi pay rental of 550 Hong Kong dollars (about $70) for a 12-hour shift, almost a third of what they make on an average day, according to Ka Chun. \u201cUber drivers don\u2019t need any capital whatsoever as they are using their own car to take passengers,\u201d he said. Patrick Tam, secretary general of the Hong Kong Taxi & Public Light Bus Association, acknowledged the complaints against some unruly taxi drivers, and said he supported the police going after them. \u201cThese taxi drivers should face tough punishment. But it doesn\u2019t make vehicles operating without a proper license less of a problem,\u201d he said. \u201cWe just want fair treatment.\u201d So far, Hong Kong police have said they had not arrested any Uber drivers ensnared in the amateur sting operations. Estyn Chung, general manager of Uber in Hong Kong, noted that the company launched its Uber Taxi service in 2020 to give riders the option to get a taxi on its app. \u201cWe know from elsewhere around the world that taxi and ride-sharing services can thrive alongside each other. Hong Kong is not an exception,\u201d he said. Creating harmony between traditional cabbies and gig-economy drivers can be tricky. And CUHK\u2019s Chan said that, after years of ambiguity, Hong Kong is already playing catch-up. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to say the extent to which the government wants to promote Uber, and more broadly, ride-hailing platforms at this point,\u201d he said. \u201cBut Hong Kong\u2019s ride-hailing regulations lag behind, for example, Singapore.\u201d The city government is expected to unveil a study on online ride-hailing services in July. A spokesman said it is \u201copen-minded\u201d on the apps, though \u201cthey must be in compliance with the relevant law and regulations.\u201d \u201cThe government should require them to get a different driver permit and insurance even if it legalizes their operation,\u201d said Ka Chun. \u201cOtherwise, why should I get a taxi license? I could drive white-plate vehicles.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/08/tech/hong-kong-uber-taxis-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/10/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_08_us_florida-shark-attacks-walton-county", "text": "Florida fire officials are still asking beachgoers to exercise caution Sunday after three people were injured Friday in two separate shark attacks within just 90 minutes of each other at neighboring Walton County beaches. The attacks happened about four miles apart and left two people in critical condition and a third in stable condition, South Walton Fire District Fire Chief Ryan Crawford said in a news conference Friday. \u201cWe encourage all of our beach patrons to be situationally aware in the water today, swim near a lifeguard, stay hydrated, and look out for each other,\u201d the South Walton Fire District said in an update on its Facebook page Sunday. The post continued: \u201cPlease do not underestimate the open water and any of the marine life that could be present.\u201d The department said yellow and purple flags are being used Sunday to warn people of moderate surf hazards and the dangers of marine life. Just after 1:15 p.m. on Friday, authorities responded to a report of a woman being injured by a shark in the water near Watersound Way and Coopersmith Lane, according to the\u00a0Walton County Sheriff\u2019s Office. A 45-year-old woman was \u201creportedly swimming just past the first sandbar with her husband\u201d near WaterSound Beach, Crawford said at the news conference. The woman suffered significant trauma to the midsection and pelvic area, and her left lower arm was amputated, according to Crawford. She was airlifted to a trauma facility for treatment. The second attack took place at the Sandy Shores Court area of Seacrest Beach at approximately 2:55 p.m., four miles east of the first incident. Two girls approximately 15 to 17 years old were in waist-deep water with a group of friends just inside the first sandbar when the incident occurred, according to the fire district. One of the teenagers had significant injuries to the upper leg and one hand, and the other had minor injuries on one foot, according to the fire district. On Saturday, Beach Safety Director for the South Walton Fire District David Vaughn told CNN the person who suffered minor injuries had been discharged from the hospital. The other two attack victims remained hospitalized in stable condition, he said. CNN has contacted officials for an update on their condition but has not heard back. Vaughn added officials do not know for sure if the same shark was behind the separate attacks or what species was involved. \u201cIt would make more sense that with the nature and severity of the injuries, that it was the same large shark,\u201d Vaughn noted. Following the incidents, beach flags were changed to double red Friday to indicate the water was closed for swimming. The father of a 17-year-old girl who witnessed the teenagers being attacked from her hotel balcony said his daughter was distraught. \u201cShe felt helpless that she couldn\u2019t help,\u201d Brian Erbesfield said of his daughter Hanna. Video provided by the family shows a shark in breakers meters offshore as beachgoers gather at the water\u2019s edge. \u201cOh my God, Oh my God \u2026 They need to get out,\u201d a voice said. Walton County Sheriff Michael Adkinson said during Friday\u2019s news conference, authorities are speaking with experts to see if there is \u201csomething anomalous.\u201d \u201cWe don\u2019t think there is, but we certainly want to be diligent,\u201d he said. \u201cWe know we share the water with sharks, we understand that as tragic as this is, there are always sharks.\u201d The last two shark incidents in the area were reported in 2021 and 2005, according to the Walton County Sheriff\u2019s Office. During the most recent attack, in June 2021, a 14-year-old boy survived after being bitten in the chest area while swimming near a fishing line 40 yards from the shore in Grayton State Park. Another attack was fatal \u2013 in June 2005, a 14-year-old girl from Louisiana was on a boogie board 250 yards from shore when she was pulled under by the shark and bitten in the legs. While the risk of being bitten by a shark is extremely low, Florida tops global charts for the number of shark bites, according to the Florida Museum of Natural History\u2019s annual shark attack report. In 2023, Florida had 16 unprovoked shark bite incidents reported, which represents 44% of the United States total and 23% worldwide. Volusia County had the most shark bites, and the others were reported in Brevard, St. Lucie, Miami-Dade, Palm Beach, Escambia and Pinellas counties. There were no fatalities reported last year in the state as a result of the attacks.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/08/us/florida-shark-attacks-walton-county/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/10/2024", "section": "us"}}

Wyoming Gov. Mark Gordon said in a\u00a0post\u00a0on Facebook there is no estimated timeline for reopening Teton Pass, which links Victor, Idaho, and Jackson, Wyoming. The initial crack appeared Thursday morning across both lanes of travel, the Wyoming Department of Transportation (WYDOT) said\u00a0in a\u00a0post\u00a0on Facebook at the time. The crack across lanes dropped vertically roughly 8 inches in some places, causing unsafe driving conditions.\u00a0A patch was put in place and traffic resumed until a mudslide in a different location on Friday closed the road.

{"id": "2024_06_07_us_food-fraud-scheme-convicted", "text": "A jury convicted five Minnesota residents but acquitted two others on Friday for their roles in a scheme to steal more than $40 million that was supposed to feed children during the coronavirus pandemic. The case received widespread attention after someone tried to bribe a juror with a bag of $120,000 in cash. That juror was dismissed before deliberations began, and a second juror who was told about the bribe attempt was also dismissed. An FBI investigation of the attempted bribe continues, with no arrests announced. The seven defendants are the first of 70 to stand trial in what federal prosecutors have called one of the nation\u2019s largest COVID-19-related frauds, exploiting rules that were kept lax so that the economy wouldn\u2019t crash during the pandemic. More than $250 million in federal funds was taken in the Minnesota scheme overall, with only about $50 million of it recovered, authorities said. The defendants faced a mix of multiple counts including conspiracy, wire fraud, money laundering and federal programs bribery. It ended with a split verdict. Abdiaziz Shafii Farah, Mohamed Jama Ismail, Abdimajid Mohamed Nur, Mukhtar Mohamed Shariff and Hayat Mohamed Nur were found guilty on most of the counts against them. Said Shafii Farah and Abdiwahab Maalim Aftin were acquitted on all counts they faced. Defense attorneys argued that the defendants provided real meals to real people. An Associated Press analysis published last June documented how thieves across the country plundered billions in federal COVID-19 relief dollars. Fraudsters potentially stole more than $280 billion, while another $123 billion was wasted or misspent. Combined, the loss represented 10% of the $4.3 trillion the government disbursed by last fall. Nearly 3,200 defendants have been charged and about $1.4 billion in stolen pandemic aid has been seized, according to the U.S. Justice Department. The Minnesota case drew attention after the judge and attorneys for both sides learned about the bribe attempt. The judge ordered all seven defendants to surrender their cellphones so that investigators could look for evidence. She also ordered all seven taken into custody, and sequestered the jury. According to an FBI agent\u2019s affidavit, a woman rang the doorbell at the home of \u201cJuror #52\u201d in the Minneapolis suburb of Spring Lake Park the night before the case went to the jury. The juror wasn\u2019t home, but a relative answered the door. The woman handed the relative a gift bag with a curly ribbon and images of flowers and butterflies and said it was a \u201cpresent\u201d for the juror. \u201cThe woman told the relative to tell Juror #52 to say not guilty tomorrow and there would be more of that present tomorrow,\u201d the agent wrote. \u201cAfter the woman left, the relative looked in the gift bag and saw it contained a substantial amount of cash.\u201d The juror called police right after she got home and gave them the bag, which held stacks of $100, $50 and $20 bills totaling around $120,000. The woman who left the bag knew the juror\u2019s first name, the agent said. Names of the jurors have not been made public, but the list of people with access to it included prosecutors, defense lawyers \u2014 and the seven defendants. \u201cIt is highly likely that someone with access to the juror\u2019s personal information was conspiring with, at a minimum, the woman who delivered the $120,000 bribe,\u201d the FBI agent wrote, noting that the alleged fraud conspiracy at the heart of the trial involved electronic communications, including text messages and emails. Federal charges of bribery of a juror and influencing a juror carry a maximum potential penalty of 15 years in prison. The food aid came from the U.S. Department of Agriculture and was administered by the state, which funneled the meal money through nonprofit organizations and other partners. As rules were eased to speed support to the needy, the defendants allegedly produced invoices for meals never served, ran shell companies, laundered money, indulged in passport fraud and accepted kickbacks. Federal prosecutors said just a fraction of the money the defendants received through the Feeding our Future nonprofit went to feed low-income kids, while the rest was spent on luxury cars, jewelry, travel and property. The seven collectively stole more than $40 million, they said. The common thread in the defense arguments was that investigators failed to dig deep enough to see they served real meals to real kids. Eighteen other defendants pleaded guilty. Among those awaiting trial is Aimee Bock, the founder of Feeding our Future. She has maintained her innocence, saying she never stole and saw no evidence of fraud among her subcontractors.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/07/us/food-fraud-scheme-convicted/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/10/2024", "section": "us"}}

During the visit, three Burlington\u00a0Police Department personnel simulated a robbery scenario that was not directed at students or faculty, the department said in a release. Police said they had communicated with school staff last month about the details of the demonstration, \u201cincluding saying that the training incident would involve \u2018using fake firearms in a mock shooting.\u2019\u201d It\u2019s unclear whether teachers were told the simulation would occur without warning. One 15-year-old in the class said students\u00a0were listening to a presentation when he suddenly heard people enter the room screaming. \u201cThere\u2019s like three people fighting. The fake gun, that we didn\u2019t know was fake at the time, got pulled out and shot what I think were blanks. They left shells. And it was still like loud,\u201d the sophomore, who asked not to be named,\u00a0told CNN. \u201cMe and almost the whole class dove to the floor to hide under the tables because we didn\u2019t know what was going on.\u201d CNN has reached out to the Burlington\u00a0Police Department about the weapon used in\u00a0the simulation. The student said the person holding the gun was wearing a mask and they heard someone scream \u201cget down.\u201d He said that he was shaking, and that some kids were getting their phones out to text family members. The email from school officials\u00a0to families\u00a0said,\u00a0\u201cWhile the gun was fake,\u00a0the reenactment involved screaming and fake\u00a0gun shot\u00a0sounds.\u201d \u201cIf these are the people quote-unquote\u00a0\u2018protecting\u2019\u00a0us, why did they make such a stupid decision without really thinking.\u00a0\u2026 Especially with school shootings and stuff, we\u2019re all already on edge,\u201d the student said. Police said they asked school staff whether the demonstration would be suitable for the student group, saying \u201cIt is about as real life as you can get, and is certainly exactly the sort of thing we deal with most frequently.\u201d \u201cYES Program staff responded, \u2018I think these students will be fine with this simulation. We will give a heads up to parents and students,\u2019\u201d according to the police release. But in an email sent to families of the students after the incident, school officials wrote the simulation \u201cwas startling for many students and may have left some feeling confused and frightened as a result,\u201d the VTDigger reported.  Burlington School District Superintendent Tom Flanagan and Burlington Police Chief Jon Murad released a joint statement apologizing to students Friday. \u201cIt is clear to us that this week\u2019s events resulted from a breakdown in communication between two groups trying to work together to create a meaningful experience for students,\u201d the statement read, in part. \u201cBoth BSD and the BPD are committed to doing a better job of clearly laying out descriptions, expectations, and agendas and seeking clarification when working together in the future. Neither of us want any repeat of anything like this moving forward.\u201d Students \u2018literally thought they were being shot at\u2019 The sophomore student and his parent said they had no knowledge that there was going to be a shooting demonstration during the field trip. \ufeffA grandparent who is guardian to one of the students likewise said\u00a0the school did not inform them of the\u00a0planned\u00a0mock shooting. CNN has been unable to independently confirm what parents and students were told before the trip. \u201cIf I had known that was going to happen, I would\u2019ve never put him through that,\u201d\u00a0said the grandparent, who has asked to remain anonymous to protect\u00a0the grandchild\u2019s\u00a0privacy. The grandparent said the students \u201cliterally thought they were being shot at,\u201d adding that their\u00a0grandchild didn\u2019t know what to do or how to react. The grandparent told CNN their\u00a0child \u201cfroze up\u201d during the demonstration. \u201cOther kids were diving on the floor, trying to get under furniture, whatever they could do to get out of the situation,\u201d the grandparent said the student told them. The\u00a0Burlington\u00a0Police Department said it \u201capologizes to any students in attendance who were upset by the specific scenario and crime scene portion of the presentation.\u201d A representative for Burlington Mayor Emma Mulvaney-Stanak also told CNN that parents and students were upset following the demonstration. Mayor Mulvaney-Stanak said in a statement to CNN that she apologizes \u201cfor the harm and distress this incident caused\u00a0Burlington\u00a0High School students \u2013 students who have tragically grown up in a society where gun violence, including in school settings, has become commonplace.\u201d The mayor said she hopes the school district and police department \u201cwill take responsibility for the harm caused and be self-reflective about all the ways this should have been handled differently and will not be repeated in the future.\u201d School officials hosted a \u201crestorative circle\u201d on Friday for students\u00a0and teachers\u00a0to share their thoughts about the incident, according to\u00a0an\u00a0email sent to parents and students. The 15-year-old student told CNN that teachers and police officers were present, but that he felt like police \u201cweren\u2019t directly holding themselves accountable.\u201d CNN\u2019s Elizabeth Wolfe contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/07/us/burlington-vermont-police-school-mock-shooting/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/10/2024", "section": "us"}}

The  father and stepmother were charged roughly 35 years after the body of the 5-year-old boy was found near his family\u2019s residence, CNN previously reported. Circuit Judge Roger Young ruled the original detective in the case changed his interpretations of the evidence, and with more than 20 witnesses either dead or unable to testify, the couple couldn\u2019t put up a fair defense and question witnesses who claimed they made incriminating statements, The Associated Press reported. The judge barred prosecutors from ever charging the couple again, according to the AP. Speaking outside court following the dismissal of charges, the Turners professed their innocence. \u201cI\u2019m glad it\u2019s over with,\u201d Victor Turner said. \u201cI\u2019m still sad about it. That\u2019s all I can say about it right now, but I can hold my head up a little bit.\u201d \u201cWe didn\u2019t do it,\u201d Megan Turner said. Young, in his ruling, said, \u201cThis is a circumstantial evidence (case) which depends on part on supposedly incriminating statements made to third persons. Unavailability of those witnesses for cross examination would be highly prejudicial to the defense,\u201d according to the AP.  The detective who investigated the case in 1989 was rehired by the Berkeley County Sheriff\u2019s Office in 2021 to review cold cases. \u201cJudge Young has upheld the oath of his office by following the law,\u201d the Ninth Circuit Solicitor\u2019s Office said in a statement. \u201cAs the testimony at the motions hearing revealed, the time that has passed since this despicable crime has resulted in witness testimony and evidence that is now unavailable. Furthermore, mistakes that were made 35 years ago could not be remedied.\u201d An affidavit provided to CNN by the Berkeley County Sheriff\u2019s\u00a0Office in January said the Turners, of Cross Hill, falsely reported their son missing on March 3, claiming he never got off the school bus. Witnesses, however, confirmed the child was never on the bus, nor was he in attendance at school that day, their affidavits show. Ultimately, the investigation determined the Turners were the \u201clast and only persons\u201d to have seen their son alive and interact with him before his death, the documents released earlier this year said. \u201cThis is not the outcome we were seeking; however, we understand the technicality of prosecuting cases from crimes that occurred years ago,\u201d Berkeley County Sheriff Duane Lewis said Friday in a statement. The family of Justin Turner, while asking for privacy, said the justice system failed. \u201cBased off the overwhelming evidence, the ones responsible for Justin\u2019s death had the chance to face justice here, but instead chose to stay silent and face the final justice handed out by God for eternity!

The Biden administration has been leading a campaign to persuade leaders of the fellow G7 nations \u2013 the UK, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan \u2013 to sign off on a plan that it views as vital to giving Ukraine a shot at turning around its prospects on the battlefield as it continues to fend off the Russian assault. The ultimate goal, sources said, is to iron out some of the thorniest financing details in the coming days so that an agreement can be announced as part of the G7 leaders\u2019 communiqu\u00e9 this week. But questions about the modalities of such a program \u2013 including the precise form of disbursement and repayment assurances, among others \u2013 are still in the process of being worked out. US officials argue that the dire situation for Ukraine makes the approval of such a loan deeply urgent. Even if the details behind what officials hope could amount to up to a $50 billion loan package have not yet been finalized, the G7 nations are in agreement on the urgency of the moment \u2013 and Ukraine\u2019s desperate need for a lifeline. The world\u2019s richest economies coming together behind such a plan would send a stark message to Russian leader Vladimir Putin, US officials say, that Russia will not outlast the US and its allies\u2019 continued support for Ukraine. \u201cThis is a priority for the United States. We believe it\u2019s a priority for the entire G7,\u201d Biden\u2019s national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters last week. \u201cWe want to see every country come on board with a method by which we can mobilize resources for\u00a0Ukraine\u00a0at scale so that they are able to have what they need to be able to succeed in this war.\u201d Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky will be present at the G7 gathering to once again press for more assistance on the global stage. Biden\u2019s upcoming trip to Italy will come on the heels of his multi-day visit to France, where the US\u2019 support for Ukraine\u2019s war efforts emerged as a major theme.

{"id": "2024_06_09_tech_ai-iphone-cool-apple-wwdc", "text": "Apple hasn\u2019t given users a significant reason to buy an upgraded iPhone for four years, since it rolled out 5G connectivity with the iPhone 12 \u2014 a worrying trend for the tech giant\u2019s core business. That could change this week. The iPhone brought in more than half of the company\u2019s total revenue last year, but sales growth has lagged as customers have been slower to upgrade to new models. Longer upgrade cycles \u2014 the time between users\u2019 new phone purchases \u2014 currently plague many device companies. But they\u2019ve been especially painful for Apple as it grapples with compounding challenges that also include steep competition in the key China market and a landmark antitrust lawsuit. Apple is expected to announce new artificial intelligence features at its annual Worldwide Developer Conference on Monday, which could supercharge its products and bring Apple back into competition with much of the rest of the tech world that has already gone full steam ahead on AI. And no product is more important to Apple than the iPhone. New AI features that provide a compelling reason to upgrade when Apple rolls out the iPhone 16 in the fall could boost the company at a crucial time. Here\u2019s the thing: No matter how Monday goes, Apple isn\u2019t losing its status as a tech powerhouse anytime soon. The company earned more than $200 billion from iPhone sales alone last year, its stock (AAPL) is up 9% over the past year and it has a healthy services business that helps to balance some of the seasonality of hardware sales. But analysts say that reinvigorating iPhone sales is key to Apple\u2019s continued growth. \u201cThis can\u2019t be another, \u2018Oh, we\u2019ll do something cool later on,\u2019 kind of presentation. They know that,\u201d D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria told CNN ahead of WWDC. \u201cFor Apple\u2019s stock to work, for the business to grow, we need to hear from them why we should buy iPhone 16.\u201d Investors are also counting on Apple to prove it can hold its own in the intensely competitive AI arms race at a time when many of its peers have much more clearly articulated a strategy for the next major wave of tech development. \u201cThe timing is critical for\u00a0Apple. Nvidia just leapfrogged it as the second most valuable technology company behind Microsoft,\u201d which is also seeking to more directly compete with Apple\u2019s device business with new AI-powered PCs, eMarketer senior analyst Gadjo Sevilla said in emailed commentary. \u201cAny misstep by\u00a0Apple\u00a0at this juncture could see it lose its traction as a technology leader. \u201c Awaiting the AI iPhone Apple has for years included AI in its products in small, often invisible ways that nonetheless make life easier for its fans. But now, Apple is set to introduce its most consumer-facing AI updates yet. The company is widely expected to announce on Monday new generative AI capabilities for iOS, which could especially benefit its Siri personal assistant. An AI-powered Siri could potentially perform specific tasks such as recalling a picture taken years ago on the device or answering detailed questions about the weather, the news or trivia. Over time, it could learn the user\u2019s preferences and even personality, and respond accordingly. Based on how competitors have already begun to integrate generative AI into their devices, Apple could also introduce other tools, such as the ability to summarize or draft emails. Historically, Apple is often not the first to introduce new technology, but rather rolls out a premium experience more slowly. Now, the pressure is on for the iPhone giant to wow people with features that go beyond what competitors like Samsung and Microsoft have already introduced for their smartphones and computers. But beyond the features themselves, perhaps the biggest question going into WWDC is which Apple device owners will be able to use them: Will the new AI tools be accessible on older iPhones or will they be functional only on forthcoming devices set to launch in the fall, perhaps because of the need for powerful new chips or faster processors? The latter scenario \u2014 assuming the features are compelling \u2014 could spur the next major iPhone upgrade cycle and have ripple effects for the entire company. Luria said that boring new features or AI capability that is available to anyone with an older iPhone could cause the company\u2019s stock to drop as low as $160 per share. But exciting new technology that encourages users to upgrade in the fall could boost shares to $240 each. (Apple shares closed the day just shy of $197 on Friday.) \u201cThat\u2019s the key: if it\u2019s compelling and not backward-compatible, Apple will have the first upgrade cycle in four years,\u201d Luria said. \u201cAnd that will mean a lot for the stock because that was the last time they had a big jump.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/09/tech/ai-iphone-cool-apple-wwdc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/10/2024", "section": "us"}}

The company said the issue stems from a defective anti-lock braking system, which in turn deactivates the stability control system. The system is a critical safety feature in many vehicles which prevents a loss of steering capabilities in emergency situations when the driver loses control of the vehicle, like on icy or flooded roads. Using a vehicle with a disabled stability system could increase the likelihood of a crash, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said Thursday. Multiple studies have found electronic stability control systems tend to reduce fatal collisions, particularly single-vehicle and rollover crashes. Since 2012, the NHTSA has mandated that all new passenger cars include an ESC system. The models being recalled are the 2022 Dodge Durango, and 2022 Ram 2500 and 3500. The Ram 2500 is the most affected, with nearly 158,000 pickups recalled. A little over 53,000 Durangos and 524 Ram 3500s are involved in the recall. Stellantis said it will begin notifying affected vehicle owners in late July. The company said customers will be able to bring their cars in to the dealers to update their vehicle\u2019s anti-lock braking systems for free.

{"id": "2024_06_07_us_philadelphia-drag-story-time-world-record", "text": "An LGBTQ+ publication in Philadelphia has claimed the record for the largest attendance at a drag queen story time reading, according to Guinness World Records. Drag queens read books to\u00a0263 people at the city\u2019s National Constitution Center last Saturday during an event hosted by the Philadelphia Gay News and sponsored by tourism agency Visit Philadelphia, according to Guinness and the organizers. \u201cConsidering  the fact that there are so many negative pieces of legislation in  various states, primarily against the trans community and drag  community, we thought it was very important that Philadelphia  showed\u00a0(it) is quite different than all those other places,\u201d said Mark  Segal, founder and publisher of the Philadelphia Gay News. \u201cI was thinking all the time, \u2018Here we are, doing this incredible record-breaking act and is exactly what America is all about: the pursuit of happiness,\u2019\u201d added Segal, an activist for LGBTQ+ rights who participated in the 1969 Stonewall riots. Adults  and children who gathered on the first day of Pride Month at the event  listened to several performers who read \u201c\u2019Twas the Night Before Pride\u201d  by Joanna McClintick, \u201cElmer\u201d by David McKee, \u201cThe Family Book\u201d by Todd  Parr and \u201cKevin the Unicorn: It\u2019s Not All Rainbows\u201d by Jessika von  Innerebner, organizers said. Brittany  Lynn,\u00a0an activist and performer who has led and organized\u00a0a drag queen  story time program in the city for nearly a decade, read \u201cHello,  Philadelphia!\u201d by\u00a0Martha Day Zschock. Lynn said the books were curated  to center around themes of love, diversity and acceptance. \u201cOur  goal is to give the kids the fun of learning to read and make literacy  fun. That\u2019s our mission. People get it all twisted when they see drag  queens reading (to) the kids but if they actually came to drag queen  story time and saw what we were all about, I feel like there wouldn\u2019t be  any animosity,\u201d Lynn said. A  spokesperson for Visit Philadelphia said the event warranted additional  safety precautions due to the event\u2019s nature and the warnings issued by  the federal government about LGBTQ+ events. Those precautions included  \u201ccareful consideration\u201d for when and how to promote the event, they  said. Last month,\u00a0the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security\u00a0issued a warning foreign terrorist organizations and their supporters may target LGBTQ+ events and venues as Pride Month approached, CNN previously reported. As  hundreds of people waited for the drag performers to start reading,  Lynn said it appeared they were 10 people short of the record and went  through the story time not knowing what would happen. The confirmation  didn\u2019t come until the last performer was reading their story. \u201cI think that the audience was just as excited as we were. You could hear the children clapping, and everybody was so proud that we did this, not just the girls that were in the show, not just us as performers but the entire audience. Everybody that worked so hard to make this happen. It was a shared moment that we all had collectively together,\u201d said Lynn of the moment when the performers stood on stage holding the Guinness certificate. For Segal, one of the organizers, the record proved to the world nothing can stop their pride. \u201cWe  came together anyway. We said in the face of adversity, we are here, we  are visible, and that made me very, very proud. Now, my community, I  would say, we stand against any type of violence, and we will be  visible.

{"id": "2024_06_09_business_elon-musk-pay-package-shareholder-vote", "text": "Tesla\u2019s controversial CEO Elon Musk, and his massive wealth, are front and center in a shareholder vote this coming week. Five months ago, a Delaware judge threw out the largest pay package in history, then worth more than $50 billion, that Telsa\u2019s very friendly board had given Musk in 2018. Now, Musk and the board want Tesla shareholders not only to vote again to give him back those stock options, but to relocate Tesla away from the judge\u2019s state entirely. And his board is threatening if they don\u2019t do so, they won\u2019t get the attention they need from Musk to turn around a company facing its greatest trouble in several years. Tesla\u2019s stock price slid by more than half from its peak as a trillion-dollar company in late 2021. Its sales fell short of forecasts and promises. Its profits are squeezed by a global price war for EVs that it started itself. The answer will come Thursday, when Tesla holds its annual shareholders meeting and announces results of shareholder votes on two proposals. One would once again approve the package of 303 million split-adjusted stock options, worth $46.9 billion as of Friday\u2019s closing price. That\u2019s down from the $51 billion those options were worth at the time of the decision. The shareholders approved the package back in 2018, with 73% voting in favor of it. But Delaware Chancery Court Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick in January ruled in favor of shareholders who challenged the package. She wrote that the company\u2019s board \u201cbore the burden of proving that the compensation plan was fair, and they failed to meet their burden.\u201d McCormick said that process the Tesla board used to create the pay package was \u201cdeeply flawed\u201d and criticized the board for being to close to the famous CEO to represent the interests of the shareholders. \u201cMusk launched a self-driving process, recalibrating the speed and direction along the way as he saw fit,\u201d she wrote. Musk and Tesla reacted by appealing the ruling, and by seeking permission from shareholders to move the company\u2019s state of incorporation from Delaware to Texas, where its headquarters is located. Many major companies are incorporated in a different state from where their main offices are located, often in Delaware, which has a reputation for being business friendly. It was because of Tesla\u2019s incorporation in Delaware that McCormick was able to rule on the fairness of the pay package. Despite the widespread support among shareholders back in 2018 for Musk\u2019s pay package, the Tesla board seems to be scrambling to shore-up support for this month\u2019s vote. It has filed with the SEC more than two dozen communications with shareholders advocating for a yes vote, far more active than most companies are when seeking shareholder approval of their proxy items. It has even opened a lottery in which the winning shareholder who casts a vote gets a tour of Tesla\u2019s Texas factory conducted personally by Musk. Holding Musk\u2019s focus Tesla\u2019s filings to shareholders argue it must keep the pay package in place to keep Musk fully engaged running Tesla and not one of his other companies. \u201cThis is obviously not about the money,\u201d Tesla Chair Robyn Denholm wrote in a letter to shareholders. \u201cWe all know Elon is one of the wealthiest people on the planet, and he would remain so even if Tesla were to renege on the commitment we made in 2018. Elon is not a typical executive, and Tesla is not a typical company.\u201d Rather, she continued, it\u2019s about \u201cwhat will motivate him to continue to create value for stockholders,\u201d she wrote. \u201cWhat we recognized in 2018 and continue to recognize today is that one thing Elon most certainly does not have is unlimited time,\u201d Denholm wrote. \u201cNor does he face any shortage of ideas and other places he can make an incredible difference in the world. We want those ideas, that energy and that time to be at Tesla, for the benefit of you, our owners. But that requires reciprocal respect.\u201d But part of the problem with winning support is that Musk is far more controversial than he was in 2018, and appears to be far less focused on simply running Tesla. He famously bought social media platform Twitter for $44 billion in 2022, selling $22.9 billion of his Tesla shares to help fund that purchase. He has even been accused of improperly selling $7.5 billon of those shares late that year knowing that Tesla was due to soon report disappointing sales that would reduce Tesla\u2019s price. Under his management of Twitter, since rebranded X, he\u2019s restored accounts for users who had been banned for hate speech, advocacy of violence or misinformation. Meanwhile, allegations about widespread antisemitism on the platform, and Musk\u2019s own endorsement of antisemitic tweets, has driven away many advertisers and caused widespread losses. But perhaps a more serious concern among Tesla shareholders is problems faced by the electric car pioneer itself. While shares shot up more than 1,700% between when the original package was approved in 2018 and its high point in November 2021, making Musk the richest person in the world at that time, it has lost more than half of that value since, including a 30% drop this year. Tesla has been forced to cut prices in the face of weaker than forecast demand for sales, and increased competition from other automakers offering their own EVs. \u201cThis shareholder vote is happening at the most tenuous time for Musk,\u201d said Dan Ives, tech analyst with Wedbush Securities and an analyst who is still bullish on Tesla shares. \u201cAfter Tesla went through a Cinderella ride, it\u2019s become a horror show. There\u2019s a group of shareholders who are frustrated. And this is a shot across the bow for them to show they\u2019re not satisfied.\u201d While Ives thinks that the pay package will again be approved by shareholders in the current vote, he said it will be a much closer vote this time. He said despite Tesla\u2019s problems and the controversy swirling around Musk, many shareholders believe keeping him at the company, and focused on Tesla more than SpaceX, his new artificial intelligence company xAI, The Boring Company, Neuralink and his rebranded social media company X, or his other ventures, is crucial for the company\u2019s future. Musk has even said he would not want to grow Tesla to become a leader in artificial intelligence and robotics, as he has promised, without a compensation plan that would give him ownership of around 25% of the company\u2019s stock. That would be about double the roughly 13% stake he currently owns. \u201cIt comes down to Musk,\u201d Ives said. \u201cMusk is still the hearts and lungs of the Tesla growth story.\u201d Supporters, opponents to Musk options Some high profile shareholders have spoken out in favor of Musk ahead of the vote, including Ron Baron, CEO of Baron Capital, which has Tesla as one of its top holdings with  a stake worth more than $2 billion in the company. \u201cElon\u2019s compensation contract contained aggressive performance metrics that few in 2018 believed could be achieved. If these aggressive performance metrics had not been achieved, Elon would have received\u00a0nothing,\u201d Baron said in a recent statement. \u201cWhen Tesla achieved targeted earnings, revenues, and market cap metrics, Tesla\u2019s shareholders benefitted greatly. He performed under his compensation contract. He earned his pay. Elon is the ultimate \u2018key man.\u2019\u00a0Without his relentless drive and uncompromising standards, there would be no Tesla.\u201d But there are also high profile opponents of the deal including Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis, two firms that advise investors on how to vote on proxy proposals. Both are urging no votes on Musk\u2019s package. \u201cThe award value was considered outsized from the start,\u201d wrote ISS. \u201cSome investors may find the board\u2019s argument compelling, that it would be unfair for CEO Musk not to receive the award. However, the concerns raised, both back in 2018 and in the interim, have not been sufficiently mitigated.\u201d In her decision throwing out the original package, McCormick rejected the argument that Musk would be uncompensated if the package was thrown out, writing, \u201cMusk\u2019s preexisting equity stake provided him tens of billions of dollars for his efforts.\u201d And it could continue to be up to the courts in Delaware to decide if Musk gets the options restored, no matter how the shareholders vote this month, and whether or not they approve incorporating in Texas. The attorneys for Tesla have told the court in Delaware that the companies\u2019 desire to move its incorporation to Texas is not an effort to evade jurisdiction from the original court order in Delaware as that case is appealed. But the outcome of the vote could decide how much Musk wants to continue to be involved with Tesla, the company that made him so rich and so famous before he became so controversial.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/09/business/elon-musk-pay-package-shareholder-vote/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/10/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_09_us_rex-heuermann-gilgo-beach-murders-document", "text": "An architect by trade, Gilgo Beach killings suspect\u00a0Rex Heuermann allegedly kept a chilling \u201cplanning document\u201d to \u201cmethodically blueprint\u201d \u2013 in the words of prosecutors \u2013 how to select, kill and dispose of his victims. Investigators recovered the Word document Heuermann allegedly created in 2000 and modified over several years on a hard drive in the basement of his suburban New York home, where he lived with his wife and children. In capital letters, the file outlined the \u201cpackaging\u201d of bodies for transport, steps to avoid apprehension and the removal of trace DNA evidence, according to a bail application released Thursday, when Long Island prosecutors brought charges against Heuermann in two additional killings. \u201cHis being an architect is totally consistent with the hyper attention to detail that is manifested in his murders,\u201d criminologist and author Scott Bonn told CNN via email. He now faces charges in the deaths of six women across three decades and multiple communities. On the day Heuermann pleaded not guilty to the latest charges of second-degree murder in the 2003 death of Jessica Taylor and the 1993 death of Sandra Costilla, prosecutors revealed the content of the manual they said he used to \u201cplan out his kills\u201d with scrupulous and fanatical attention to detail. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen a written document such as this,\u201d Suffolk County District Attorney Raymond Tierney told CNN. The manual contained headings such as \u201cSupplies\u201d and \u201cProblems,\u201d with \u201cDNA\u201d listed as the top item under the latter. The DNA evidence \u2013 and \u201cblueprint\u201d document \u2013 will underpin the case against him at his eventual trial. \u201cThe fact that he tried to get rid of these documents and that they were still found on the computer memory is really going to be \u2013 in connection with the DNA \u2013 a kind of nail in the coffin,\u201d said Casey Jordan, a criminologist, behavioral analyst and attorney. \u201cThese two things combined are going to be very difficult for the defense to overcome.\u201d A section titled \u201cbody prep\u201d detailed steps to clean, dismember and move bodies, while another called \u201cpost event\u201d appeared to list tasks to avoid apprehension, including having a story set, according to the bail application. Details of the content of the document come from the latest bail application from prosecutors. CNN has not seen the document independently for verification. \u201cThe thing about his blueprint for murder that stood out to me immediately is his need to document his killings which demonstrates his grandiosity and desire to bask in the glory of his work,\u201d said Bonn, author of \u201cWhy we love serial killers: The curious appeal of the world\u2019s most savage murderers.\u201d \u201cHeuermann\u2019s egotistical documentation of his work definitely led to his undoing and also strengthened the case against him.\u201d \u2018Self-education and homework\u2019 on killing Heuermann was arrested in July 2023 near his midtown Manhattan office and eventually charged with the murders of three women, whose bodies were discovered bound with belts or tape and wrapped in burlap along a stretch of Long Island\u2019s Gilgo Beach in 2010. He was later charged in January 2024 in the death of a fourth woman. Those victims \u2013 Melissa Barthelemy, Megan Waterman, Amber Costello and Maureen Brainard-Barnes \u2013 became known as the \u201cGilgo Four.\u201d Heuermann pleaded not guilty to the charges related to all four. A big break in the case came in January 2023 when investigators took a swab from leftover pizza crust Heuermann discarded in the trash outside his Manhattan office, according to court documents. DNA evidence initially linked him to a hair found on the burlap sack where Waterman\u2019s remains were found. \u201cI think the key evidence is DNA,\u201d Tierney told CNN Friday. Forensic testing performed on strands of hair on or near both Taylor and Costilla\u2019s remains found 99.96% of the North American population could be excluded as the source of the hairs \u2013\u00a0but Heuermann could not. The latest bail application said two forensic laboratories determined hairs recovered on five of the six victims were tied to Heuermann, members of his immediate family or people who lived with him. \u201cDefendant Heuermann is the individual who murdered, stripped, restrained, and transported the remains of Jessica Taylor and Sandra Costilla, as well as the Gilgo Four, until they were each discovered in 1993, 2003, 2010, and 2011,\u201d according to a new bail application released Thursday. The 60-year-old architect was surprised by the latest charges, Heuermann attorney Michael Brown said after the defendant appeared in an eastern Long Island courtroom. Heuermann was remanded without bail and is expected in court July 30. \u201cOne murder is obviously horrific, and it\u2019s a difficult thing to defend,\u201d said Brown. \u201cAnd now we\u2019re at six.\u201d Brown told reporters Thursday he needed more time to review new evidence before commenting further. In January, Brown told reporters his client claimed he is \u201cnot guilty of these charges\u201d and looked forward to fighting the charges in court. The \u201cblueprint\u201d document was discovered after investigators mined more than 350 electronic devices seized from Heuermann\u2019s home, according to Tierney. \u201cIt had been erased and we used forensic tools to recover it,\u201d the district attorney said. The bail application said the Gilgo Homicide Task Force \u201cbelieve that the totality of circumstances surrounding the \u2026 Planning Document, including Heuermann\u2019s attempt to delete its existence, points to it as Heuermann\u2019s self-education and \u2018homework\u2019 on the topic of carrying out serial, sexual murder.\u201d Tierney added, \u201cHis intent was specifically to locate these victims, hunt them down to bring them under his control and to kill them \u2026 His intent was nothing short but to murder these victims.\u201d \u2018Thing to remember\u2019 list of lessons learned The \u201cblueprint\u201d document included a \u201cpre-prep\u201d section on steps to take before a killing, such as checking an area for surveillance cameras. A \u201cprep\u201d section appeared to outline what needed to be done closer to the time of the homicides, such as building a table with a \u201ccross bar\u201d underneath to support heavier objects, according to the bail application. \u201cThis really kind of lays out for us how these women may have died,\u201d Jordan said. A \u201cpost event\u201d section in the document listed ways to avoid detection by changing car tires and creating an alibi or story in case of an inquiry. The document is riddled with typos and misspellings. It also had sections about sites for the disposal of physical evidence. There were notes on removing tattoos and other identifying marks. The bail application said a tattoo on Taylor\u2019s torso had been mutilated with a sharp object. A \u201cthings to remember\u201d section appeared to show lessons learned from previous killings. It recommended the use of heavier rope since lighter types \u201cbroke under the stress of being tightend,\u201d the bail application said. \u201cHeuermann falls into a category\u00a0of serial killer known as a power/control killer,\u201d said Bonn, who has closely examined the lives of serial killers such as Dennis Rader, known as BTK for his preferred \u201cbind, torture, kill\u201d method. \u201cThey are psychopathic and obsessed with detail and planning; covering all contingencies.\u201d Bonn noted similarities between the alleged Gilgo Beach killer and BTK, who was a churchgoer, Cub Scout leader and married father of two before advancements in science and technology ultimately led to his arrest in February 2005. Rader was fastidious in the way\u00a0he approached his killings and kept meticulous records of his fantasies and crimes in folders and binders. Rader pleaded guilty to 10 murders and was sentenced in 2005 to 10 consecutive life terms. Tierney, the Suffolk County district attorney, said the investigation is far from over and Heuermann could be tied to other killings. \u201cWe\u2019re going to continue. We\u2019re not going to stop,\u201d he said. Said Jordan, the criminologist and behavioral analyst: \u201cThere could be more murders out there \u2026 We may never know the answer to that and they may never be charged.\u201d CNN\u2019s Mark Morales, Brynn Gingras,\u00a0Carolyn Sung and Samantha Beech contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/09/us/rex-heuermann-gilgo-beach-murders-document/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/10/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_07_us_southern-baptists-women-pastors", "text": "From its towering white steeple and red-brick facade to its Sunday services filled with rousing gospel hymns and evangelistic sermons, First Baptist Church of Alexandria, Virginia, bears many of the classic hallmarks of a\u00a0Southern Baptist church. On a recent Sunday, its pastor for women and children, Kim Eskridge, urged members to invite friends and neighbors to an upcoming vacation Bible school \u2014 a perennial Baptist activity \u2014 to help \u201creach families in the community with the gospel.\u201d But because that\u00a0pastor is a woman, First Baptist\u2019s days in the Southern Baptist Convention may be numbered. At the SBC\u2019s annual meeting June 11-12 in Indianapolis, representatives will vote on whether to amend the denomination\u2019s constitution to essentially ban churches with any women pastors \u2014 and not just in the top job. That measure received overwhelming approval in a preliminary vote last year. Leaders of First Baptist \u2013 which has given millions of dollars to Southern Baptist causes and has been involved with the convention since its 19th century founding \u2014 are bracing for a possible expulsion. \u201cWe are grieved at the direction the SBC has taken,\u201d the church said in a statement. And it\u2019s not alone. By some estimates, the proposed ban could affect hundreds of congregations and have a disproportionate impact on predominantly Black churches. The vote is partly the culmination of events set in motion two years ago. That\u2019s when a Virginia pastor contacted SBC officials to contend that First Baptist and four nearby churches were \u201cout of step\u201d with denominational doctrine that says only men can be pastors. The SBC Credentials Committee launched a formal inquiry in April. Southern Baptists disagree on which ministry jobs this doctrine refers to. Some say it\u2019s just the senior pastor, others that a pastor is anyone who preaches and exercises spiritual authority. And in a Baptist tradition that prizes local church autonomy, critics say the convention shouldn\u2019t enshrine a constitutional rule based on one interpretation of its non-binding doctrinal statement. By some estimates, women are working in pastoral roles in hundreds of SBC-linked churches, a fraction of the nearly 47,000 across the denomination. But critics say the amendment would amount to a further narrowing in numbers and mindset for the nation\u2019s largest Protestant denomination, which has moved steadily rightward in recent decades. They also wonder if the SBC has better things to do. It has struggled to respond to sexual abuse cases in its churches. A former professor at a Southern Baptist seminary in Texas was indicted in May on a charge of falsifying a record about alleged sexual abuse by a student in order to obstruct a\u00a0federal investigation\u00a0into sexual misconduct in the convention. SBC membership has dipped below 13 million, nearly a half-century low. Baptismal rates are in long-term decline. The amendment, if passed, wouldn\u2019t prompt an immediate purge. But it could keep the denomination\u2019s leaders busy for years, investigating and ousting churches. Many predominantly Black churches have men as lead pastors but assign pastor titles to women in other areas, such as worship and children\u2019s ministries. \u201cTo disfellowship like-minded churches \u2026 based on a local-church governance decision dishonors the spirit of cooperation and the guiding tenets of our denomination,\u201d wrote Pastor Gregory Perkins, president of the SBC\u2019s National African American Fellowship, to denominational officials. The controversy complicates the\u00a0already-choppy efforts\u00a0by the mostly white denomination to diversify and overcome its legacy of slavery and segregation. Amendment proponents say the convention needs to reinforce its doctrinal statement, the Baptist Faith and Message, which says the office of pastor is \u201climited to men as qualified by Scripture.\u201d \u201cIf we won\u2019t stand on this issue and be unapologetically biblical, then we won\u2019t stand on anything,\u201d said amendment proponent Mike Law, pastor of Arlington Baptist Church in Virginia. Since Baptist churches are independent, the convention can\u2019t tell them what to do or whom to appoint as a pastor. But the convention can decide which churches are in and which are out. And even without a formal amendment, its Executive Committee has begun telling churches with women pastors that\u00a0they\u2019re out. That included one of its largest, Saddleback Church of California. When Saddleback and a\u00a0small Kentucky church\u00a0appealed to the\u00a0annual meeting in 2023,\u00a0delegates overwhelmingly refused to take them back. The amendment would give such enforcement actions more teeth. Some churches with women pastors quit on their own in the past year. They range from Elevation Church, a North Carolina megachurch, to First Baptist of Richmond, Virginia, which had close SBC ties from the convention\u2019s founding. Law contended the issue has been a \u201ccanary in the coalmine\u201d for liberal denominations, several of which began ordaining women and later LGBTQ+ people. \u201cSouthern Baptists are facing a decisive moment,\u201d he said in a video on a pro-amendment website. \u201cHere\u2019s the trajectory of doing nothing: Soon Southern Baptist churches will start openly supporting homosexual clergy, same-sex marriage and eventually transgenderism.\u201d Others point out that Pentecostal and other denominations have had women pastors for generations and remain theologically conservative. Some SBC churches with women pastors are heavily involved with the convention, while others have minimal connections and identify more closely with historically Black or other progressive denominations. Also, some SBC churches interpret the 2000 faith statement as only applying to senior pastors. As long as a the church leader is male, women can serve other pastoral roles, they say. Such churches may leave if SBC leaders interfere with congregations following \u201ctheir conscience, biblical convictions, and values by recognizing women can receive a pastoral gift from God in partnership with male leadership,\u201d said Dwight McKissic, a pastor from Arlington, Texas, on the social media platform X. Other churches say women can be in any role, including senior pastor, and churches can agree to disagree if they embrace most of the SBC faith statement. That category includes First Baptist of Alexandria. Though its current senior pastor is male, it recognizes \u201cGod\u2019s calling to ordain any qualified individual, male or female, for pastoral ministry,\u201d the church said in a statement. First Baptist leaders declined interview requests, but it has posted extensively about the issue on its website. It said while it plans to send representatives to the SBC annual meeting, it was warned to expect a motion to deny them voting privileges. \u201cI do believe we need to be heard and represented,\u201d Senior Pastor Robert Stephens told members in a video-recorded meeting. The SBC\u2019s top administrative body opposes the amendment. Investigating churches\u2019 compliance would consume an unsustainable amount of time and energy over something that shouldn\u2019t be a litmus test for fellowship, wrote Jeff Iorg, president of the SBC Executive Committee, in a Baptist Press commentary. Baptist Women in Ministry, which began within the SBC in the 1980s but now works in multiple Baptist denominations, has taken note. The Rev. Meredith Stone, its executive director, said some women pastors within the SBC have reached out for support. The group plans to release a documentary, \u201cMidwives of a Movement,\u201d about 20th century trailblazers for women in Baptist ministry, on the eve of the SBC meeting. \u201cAs they are saying women have less value to God than men in the church, we want to make sure that women know they do have equal value and that there are no limits to how they follow Christ in the work of the church,\u201d Stone said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/07/us/southern-baptists-women-pastors/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/10/2024", "section": "us"}}

Persichitti\u00a0was\u00a0a \u201cwonderful, pleasant, humble\u00a0guy,\u201d who was \u201ceasy know, easy to talk to,\u201d\u00a0said\u00a0Honor Flight Rochester President and CEO\u00a0Richard Stewart, who told CNN he learned of his friend\u2019s death last Friday. \u201cWe miss him,\u201d said Stewart. While Persichitti passed away bound for Normandy \u2014 where the Allied forces\u2019 landing on June 6, 1944, laid the foundation for the defeat of Nazi Germany \u2014 he served in the Pacific as a radioman aboard the USS Eldorado, Stewart said. His tour of duty included Iwo Jima, Okinawa and Guam, according to Stewart and the New York State Senate Veterans Hall of Fame, into which Persichitti was inducted in 2020. Persichitti fell ill\u00a0last week\u00a0during a stop in Germany while headed for Normandy,\u00a0Al DeCarlo, a friend who was traveling with Persichitti, told\u00a0CNN affiliate WHAM.\u00a0Persichitti was airlifted to the hospital\u00a0and\u00a0died soon after, DeCarlo said. \u201cThe doctor was with him. He was not alone, he was at peace and he was comfortable,\u201d DeCarlo said. \u201cShe put his favorite singer, Frank Sinatra, on her phone and he peacefully left us.\u201d Persichitti had heart problems in the past, \u201cbut for 102, I would say he was in superb health,\u201d\u00a0Stewart told CNN. Persichitti was born in a coal mining town outside Pittsburgh, Stewart said, describing his friend Bob\u2019s \u201chumble, poor beginnings.\u201d After the war, Persichitti worked as a carpentry teacher in Rochester, New York, according to the Veterans Hall of Fame, and in 1972 received a degree from SUNY Buffalo. Persichitti enjoyed traveling and speaking with younger generations about his experiences, often visiting schools to talk with students about World War II, his friend, Pastor William Leone, told WHAM. \u201cIt was a privilege to know him, and I will miss him,\u201d Leone told the station. Persichitti was one of the few surviving Americans who served in World War II, a population that is rapidly waning. As of 2023, just 119,550 of the 16.4 million who served \u2013 less than one percent \u2013 were still alive, according to the National WWII Museum in New Orleans. At that time, about 131 World War II veterans were dying each day, the museum said. US President Joe Biden underscored this point Thursday, telling those gathered at this year\u2019s D-Day commemoration in Normandy that it may be the last to involve living veterans. That fact, he said, should push Americans to continue the fight against tyranny. \u201cWe\u2019re not far off from the time when the last living voices of those who fought and bled on D-Day will no longer be with us,\u201d Biden said. \u201cSo we have a special obligation.

{"id": "2024_06_09_us_tren-de-aragua-venezuela-gang", "text": "An alleged multistate human trafficking ring forcing immigrant women into prostitution. The mysterious killing of a former police officer in South Florida.\u00a0Attacks against police officers in New York.\u00a0The arrest of a drug dealer in Chicago. Local and federal officials say these apparently unrelated crimes have a common denominator:\u00a0Tren de Aragua, a transnational criminal gang that originated in a Venezuela prison and has slowly made its way south and north in recent years. They say it\u2019s now operating in the United States.\u00a0The scale of its operations is unknown, but crimes attributed to alleged members of the gang have worried elected officials and some Republican members of Congress have asked the Biden administration \u201cto formally designate the vicious Tren de Aragua as a Transnational Criminal Organization.\u201d For several years, the criminal group has terrorized South American countries, including Venezuela, its country of origin, as well as Bolivia, Colombia, Chile and Peru.\u00a0Retired general \u00d3scar Naranjo, a former vice president of Colombia and chief of the Colombian National Police, told CNN Tren de Aragua is \u201cthe most disruptive criminal organization operating nowadays in Latin America, a true challenge for the region.\u201d \u2018Watch out for this gang\u2019 Tren de Aragua adopted its name between 2013 and 2015 but begun operations years before, according to a report by Transparency Venezuela. \u201cIt has its origin in the unions of workers who worked on the construction of a railway project that would connect the center-west of the country and that was never completed\u201d in both Aragua and Carabobo states. The group\u2019s leadership, according to the report, operated out of the notorious Tocor\u00f3n prison, which they controlled. When Venezuelan officials raided it last September, they found a swimming pool and several restaurants inside the prison walls, in addition to weapons seized from inmates, including automatic rifles, machine guns and thousands of rounds of ammunition. By 2015, a former Venezuelan law enforcement official told CNN, \u201cThey were already in their prime.\u201d That year they forged an alliance with Primeiro Comando da Capital, a Brazilian criminal organization. It was only a matter of time before they would extend their tentacles throughout South America. In Colombia, Tren de Aragua, and a rival guerrilla group known as the National Liberation Army, \u201coperate sex trafficking networks in the border town of Villa del Rosario in the Norte de Santander department.\u00a0These groups exploit Venezuelan migrants and internally displaced Colombians in sex trafficking and take advantage of economic vulnerabilities and subject them to debt bondage,\u201d\u00a0according to the US State Department 2023 Trafficking in Persons Report about Colombia. Police in the region say the organization has victimized thousands through extorsion, drug and human trafficking, kidnapping and murder. Now, US Customs and Border Protection and the FBI say the gang is established in the US. \u201cThey have followed the migration paths across South America to other countries and have set up criminal groups throughout South America as they follow those paths, and that they appear to follow the migration north to the United States,\u201d Britton Boyd, an FBI special agent in El Paso, Texas, told CNN said. US Border Patrol chief Jason Owens, who has confirmed multiple arrests at the southern border of alleged Tren de Aragua members over the last year, issued a warning in early April.\u00a0\u201cWatch out for this gang.\u00a0It is the most powerful in Venezuela, known for murder, drug trafficking, sex crimes, extortion, & other violent acts,\u201d Owens said on X. There are more than 70 cases in which Tren de Aragua is mentioned in law enforcement documents or prosecutors\u2019 complaints. From that total, the Customs and Border Patrol in Texas has identified 58 as gang members between the fiscal year 2023 and last May. The rest appear in complaints made by victims or arrest reports that point to the possible involvement of the suspects with this organized crime group. \u2018If left unchecked\u2019 In New York, police say Bernardo Raul Castro-Mata, a 19-year-old from Venezuela, shot two police officers last week. Castro-Mata entered the country illegally last July, a member of Immigration and Customs Enforcement told CNN. The Venezuelan has tattoos associated with Tren de Aragua \u2013 which court documents for a suspected gang member in Georgia describe as five-pointed crowns, five-pointed stars and teardrops \u2013 the New York Police Department told CNN. Castro-Mata had no prior arrests but is a suspect in several robberies in Queens. Castro-Mata remains in custody and has pleaded not guilty to charges. When contacted by CNN, his attorneys declined to comment. But of all the crimes attributed to the gang, including the kidnapping and murder of a former Venezuelan police officer in South Florida in November 2023, one stands out.\u00a0In late April, the East Baton Rouge Sheriff\u2019s Department received a 911 call from a Spanish-speaking woman saying she was being held against her will at a residence and \u201cforced to have sexual intercourse with unknown males for money.\u201d\u00a0The woman later told investigators that she was forced to have sex with strangers \u201cto pay off a $30,000 USD debt to a trafficker for bringing her to the United States.\u201d Officials arrested two suspects \u2013 both Venezuelan nationals \u2013 at the location, Allbert Herrera Machado, 23, and Osleidy Vanesa Chourio-Diaz, 26. Agents later arrested another Venezuelan, Josmar Jesus Zambrano-Chirinos, 23, identified in the complaint as a leader of the sex trafficking operation being conducted by the Tren de Aragua in the US. Zambrano was \u201coperating \u2018stash houses\u2019 used for human trafficking in Louisiana, Texas, Virginia, New Jersey, and Florida,\u201d according to the criminal complaint reviewed by CNN. Herrera Machado and Chourio-Diaz were not linked to Tren de Aragua in the complaint. If the allegations against the suspects are true, it would mean that the gang already has the ability to operate trafficking rings in the US the same way it has done in several South American countries. The challenge for law enforcement officials is that it\u2019s very difficult to know how many members of Tren de Aragua are already in the country, in spite of the arrests. What some Venezuelan immigrants in Florida and other states have told CNN is that they are already beginning to see in their communities the same type of criminal activity they fled from in Venezuela. \u00c1lvaro Boza, a former Venezuelan police officer now living in Florida, says he fled his country in large part because the gang had become so powerful. He says they could kill law enforcement like him with impunity. A fellow police officer who refused to cooperate with the gang in his native Aragua state was shot 50 times, Boza says.\u00a0\u201cHe refused and was murdered.\u00a0They tied his body to a motorcycle and dragged it throughout the San Vicente neighborhood to demonstrate the power of the Tren de Aragua,\u201d Boza said. In March, a group of Republican members of Congress led by Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and his fellow Republican Representative Ana Mar\u00eda Salazar sent a letter to President Joe Biden urging him to take action by designating the gang as a \u201ctransnational criminal organization.\u201d In the letter, the legislators said \u201cIf left unchecked, they will unleash an unprecedented reign of terror, mirroring the devastation it has already inflicted in communities throughout Central and South America, most prominently in Colombia, Chile, Ecuador, and Peru.\u201d CNN\u2019s Jaide Timm-Garcia contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/09/us/tren-de-aragua-venezuela-gang/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/10/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_09_politics_donald-trump-nevada-rally", "text": "Donald Trump proposed eliminating taxes on tips at a Sunday campaign rally in Las Vegas as he looks to win over voters in a critical swing state that has a sizable number of service\u00a0industry\u00a0workers. The proposal \u2014 which came at the presumptive GOP nominee\u2019s first campaign rally since his historic conviction in his New York hush money trial last month \u2014 was immediately slammed by the state\u2019s powerful Culinary Union as \u201cwild campaign promises from a convicted felon.\u201d The former president\u2019s Las Vegas visit follows a flurry of stops that included high-dollar fundraisers in California and a campaign town hall in Arizona.\u00a0On Saturday night, he attended a fundraiser in Las Vegas hosted by construction equipment tycoon Don Ahern, a longtime ally. Trump co-campaign manager Chris LaCivita said Sunday the campaign and the Republican National Committee raised a total of $27.5 million from the four fundraisers Trump attended in recent days in California and Nevada. Trump\u2019s excursion out West comes at a critical juncture for his campaign as it looks to shift the narrative to his general election message after a seven-week criminal trial that culminated in his conviction on 34 felony counts related to a hush money scheme to pay off a porn star ahead of the 2016 election. During his visit to Las Vegas, the Trump campaign also launched\u00a0a new \u201cLatino Americans for Trump\u201d coalition, as it looks to increase its outreach to Hispanic voters ahead of November\u2019s election.\u00a0The decision to launch the new program in Nevada was no coincidence. Recent polling has indicated a noticeable shift toward Trump among Hispanic voters, who have traditionally voted Democratic. In a state like Nevada, where Latino voters make up a sizable portion of the electorate, siphoning away some of them could help deliver Trump the critical battleground state, and potentially the White House. Nevada has backed the Democratic nominee for president in four consecutive elections \u2013 but Joe Biden carried it by just 2 points in 2020. \u201cSome of us believe that we might be better positioned in Nevada [this cycle] than we are even in Georgia,\u201d one source close to Trump told CNN ahead of the rally. Trump campaign sources pointed specifically to the Covid-19 pandemic as a reason for their optimism. Nevada was particularly hard hit by the pandemic, given its dependence on tourism and hospitality. One senior adviser said ahead of the event that there are also plans to try to work with the state\u2019s Culinary Workers Union, which has traditionally worked closely with Democrats as part of a massive get-out-the-vote operation crafted by late Nevada Sen. Harry Reid. Last month, the union unendorsed several Democratic state lawmakers over their votes to remove Covid-era cleaning requirements placed on the casino industry. \u201cWhen I get to office, we are going to not charge taxes on tips,\u201d Trump said at his rally. \u201cWe\u2019re going to do that right away, first thing in office because it\u2019s been a point of contention for years and years and years and you do a great job of service \u2014 you take care of people.\u201d The Culinary Workers Union Local 226 pushed back on Trump\u2019s promise, which would need congressional approval, on Sunday. \u201cFor decades, the Culinary Union has fought for tipped workers\u2019 rights and against unfair taxation,\u201d Secretary-Treasurer Ted Pappageorge said in a statement. \u201cRelief is definitely needed for tip earners, but Nevada workers are smart enough to know the difference between real solutions and wild campaign promises from a convicted felon.\u201d A critical moment As he did at his Phoenix town hall last week hosted by conservative group Turning Point Action, Trump on Sunday also railed against his conviction and touted the fundraising boon it\u2019s been for his campaign. In a series of interviews over the past week, Trump has refused to back away from his threats to seek retaliation against his political opponents if he wins the presidency. \u201cWell, revenge does take time. I will say that,\u201d Trump said in an interview with psychologist Phil McGraw, better known as Dr. Phil. \u201cAnd sometimes revenge can be justified. Phil, I have to be honest. You know, sometimes it can.\u201d And while he called the people in prison for breaking into the Capitol on January 6, 2021, \u201cwarriors\u201d and continued to falsely claim that the rioters were invited into the Capitol by police, Trump on Sunday also focused on immigration, which his team views as a core vulnerability for Biden ahead of November. In a potential attempt to address that vulnerability, Biden announced an executive action last week giving him the authority to effectively shut down the US-Mexico border to asylum seekers entering illegally when a daily threshold of crossings is exceeded. Trump bashed Biden repeatedly over the move during his Phoenix speech, calling it \u201cbullsh*t\u201d and vowing to revoke the new asylum restrictions if reelected. The Senate factor In addition to a marquee presidential race, Nevada is also playing host this year to what is expected to be one of the country\u2019s most competitive Senate contests as Democratic incumbent Jacky Rosen seeks a second term. Trump \u2014 who has faced pressure to back Sam Brown, a retired Army captain who was severely burned by a roadside bomb in Afghanistan \u2014 has yet to endorse in the state\u2019s increasingly ugly GOP Senate primary. \u201cYou have a good man named Brown right here, you know, very good,\u201d Trump said at his Las Vegas rally while attacking Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown. Even Trump\u2019s advisers were uncertain of whether he would ultimately endorse a candidate. However, despite the brief compliment of Sam Brown, who was at the rally handing out water, Trump did not offer an endorsement for Tuesday\u2019s primary. Asked by CNN about whether he expected an endorsement, Brown said, \u201cI\u2019m just focused on getting through Tuesday. President Trump\u2019s got a lot on his plate too. I just know that coming through Tuesday, we\u2019re all going to be focused on November 5.\u201d In April, Trump posted on social media that Brown and the former president were the \u201cClear Choices of Nevada\u2019s Republican Voters and Donors.\u201d But Trump loyalists have bashed Brown for his ties to mainstream Republicans \u2013 he was personally recruited to run by Montana Sen. Steve Daines, the head of the Senate GOP campaign arm. Instead, they have encouraged the former president to back Jeff Gunter, Trump\u2019s former ambassador to Iceland. Ahern, who hosted the event at his luxury boutique hotel, backed Brown when he unsuccessfully sought the GOP nomination for the state\u2019s other Senate seat in 2022. But Ahern has thrown his support behind Gunter this cycle and has encouraged Trump to do the same. Dangerous conditions Trump\u2019s campaign, which has been holding outdoor rallies more frequently in recent months, was bracing for extreme heat on Sunday as temperatures were expected to reach 104 degrees Fahrenheit. In preparation, the Trump campaign doubled the amount of emergency medical staff on site for the rally, added new misting fans and significantly increased the amount of water available to attendees, according to a Trump campaign official. The official said the campaign would provide more than 38,000 bottles of water, 20 Power Breezer misting fans throughout the venue in Sunset Park in Las Vegas, at least one cooling tent with air conditioning and pop-up umbrella tents throughout the space. More metal detectors were also expected to be added to help expedite security lines. The new precautions came after 12 people were transported to the hospital from Trump\u2019s campaign event in Phoenix due to heat-related illness, a spokeswoman for the Phoenix Fire Department told CNN.

Patrice Miller, 71, was found dead in her Downieville home last November, but a recently released autopsy report by California\u2019s Department of Fish and Wildlife has verified she was killed by a bear, the Sierra County Sheriff\u2019s department said. A sheriff\u2019s deputy discovered Miller deceased in her home while conducting a welfare check after a grocery store employee reported that she had not been seen or heard from for several days, according to Sheriff Michael Fisher. The sheriff\u2019s office said when they found Miller, there were clear signs a bear had been inside the house. But officials believed Miller had died of natural causes and the bear broke into the house after her death and had been feeding on her remains. The bear was eventually trapped and euthanized, the sheriff said. However, a recently released autopsy revealed that Miller did not die of natural causes but had in fact been killed by the bear, the sheriff said. \u201cPost investigation, we found out that she had been having some bear issues at the house. And after we concluded our coroner\u2019s investigation and removed her remains from the house, the bear continued to break into the house over and over again over the next several days,\u201d Fisher added. The sheriff said further investigation revealed bears had been prowling around Miller\u2019s house for some time because she would leave cat food on the front porch for her cats and there was garbage around the home as well. Miller\u2019s daughter also told authorities that one particular bear would come to the house quite often and her mother had put bars on the windows to keep the bear away. \u201cIt\u2019s a big deal. That doesn\u2019t happen in California. Normally a bear is going to stay away from you, a bear that hasn\u2019t been normalized to human behavior,\u201d Steve Gonzalez with the fish and wildlife department told CNN affiliate KCRA. Last month, there had been reports of another bear breaking into homes in the mountain community. That bear has also been euthanized, the sheriff said. Fisher said that bears are seen around the area regularly, but usually they\u2019re rummaging through garbage or breaking into cars for food, and flee when they see a human. \u201cWe deal with bears on a weekly basis through spring, summer and fall and 99.9% of those animals are not a public safety (issue). They\u2019re a nuisance, but they\u2019re not a public safety (issue),\u201d the sheriff said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/07/us/california-confirms-woman-killed-last-winter-was-states-first-fatal-black-bear-attack/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/10/2024", "section": "us"}}

Mark Walztoni tells CNN his 17-year-old daughter Cobalt Sovereign, a junior at Hopkins High School in Minnetonka, was in the school bathroom last\u00a0Thursday\u00a0when\u00a0a student started calling her\u00a0transphobic slurs. While she was leaving the bathroom, Walztoni says his daughter\u00a0said\u00a0she was surrounded by\u00a0that student and two others, who began following Sovereign down the hall, and when she turned around to ask them to stop, she was\u00a0punched in the mouth. During the attack, according to Walztoni, Sovereign\u2019s jaw was broken in two places. She had a compound fracture and lost teeth, leading to reconstructive surgery. Walztoni says the students\u00a0responsible\u00a0should face criminal charges. \u201cThere has to be repercussions for their actions. And if they are not charged for some reason, which is our fear, then that is just going to further escalate their behavior because when you get away with stuff, you continue to do stuff,\u201d he said. \u201cThere needs to be some kind of punishment and there needs to be some serious discussion as to whether those kids should be able to come back to the same school.\u201d He also says\u00a0he\u00a0was notified about the incident from a social worker at the school and was told by school officials to notify the police, adding he was displeased the incident \u201cwasn\u2019t treated as an emergency.\u201d Walztoni also tells CNN he is unsure if his daughter will be safe going back to school and wants to see changes. \u201cIt\u2019s unacceptable. The whole transphobia and homophobia thing is, in my opinion, so 20th century, or it should be a thing of the past. And it\u2019s clear that the climate is getting worse in this regard,\u201d he told CNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins on \u201cThe Source.\u201d \u201cWe have a tremendous amount of community support here and Cobalt feeling very loved but it\u2019s you know it\u2019s the kids that are there today aren\u2019t safe.\u201d Sovereign tells CNN she has never met or seen the students who attacked and harassed her prior to the incident. She said she has faced harassment in the past but \u201cnothing even close to this extent\u201d. Sovereign also said using the restroom as someone who identifies as non-binary has always been an issue for her. \u201cI try to use any general neutral or family restroom options if they\u2019re available but when I\u2019m not given that option I \u2026 use the men\u2019s restroom because it\u2019s what makes everybody around me the least amount of uncomfortable and making other people uncomfortable is something that I tried not to do. It\u2019s from one of my worst fears,\u201d Sovereign told Collins. The Minnetonka Police Department said in a statement to CNN\u00a0it is investigating an\u00a0attack\u00a0that day at Hopkins High School as \u201ca possible hate\u00a0crime,\u201d but said \u201cdetails remain limited as the case was reported to police after school had ended for the day.\u201d\u00a0Hopkins High School\u00a0said it is investigating \u201can act of violence\u201d\u00a0that \u201cinvolved a student who identifies as part of the LGBTQ+ community.\u201d  \u201cWe will address any issues that compromise the safety and inclusivity of our school environment,\u201d the school told CNN in a statement. \u201cWe support and stand by any group that is marginalized, including our LGBTQ+ scholars and staff.\u201d Minnetonka Police Chief Scott Boerboom tells CNN Sovereign\u2019s mother reported the incident to the police department\u00a0the day it happened\u00a0and he was not made aware of it until the following Monday. Boerboom says he would have preferred the school notify the police as soon as the incident occurred. \u201cWe would arrive at the school, we would meet with the victim, Cobalt, we would talk to the suspects, identify the suspects, get their side of the story, talk to the victim. And then we are required to notify parents at that time,\u201d he said. \u201cBy having us contacted at the onset, we can assess it as first responders and we have access to EMS or medical services.\u201d Boerboom also says a video of the assault exists, and he has seen it. He says his department filed a subpoena for the video from the school, in line with policy. In the video, he says, one boy is seen assaulting Sovereign in the hallway. There were two other boys nearby, Boerboom says, who were not involved in the physical assault. The\u00a0attack comes amid a rise in\u00a0anti-LGBTQ\u00a0legislation\u00a0and as advocates say LGBTQ students have faced an uptick in threats and violence. It also comes nearly four months after the\u00a0death of Nex Benedict, a nonbinary\u00a010th grader in Oklahoma who told\u00a0police about being beaten to the point of blacking out during a confrontation in the school bathroom.\u00a0 Melanie Willingham-Jaggers, executive director of GLSEN, a non-profit\u00a0group working to end intolerance and homophobia in\u00a0K-12\u00a0schools, said the\u00a0attack is \u201ca heartbreaking reminder of the violence and discrimination that trans youth face daily.\u201d \u201cGLSEN\u00a0stands in solidarity with Cobalt and their family, and we call on their school officials to take immediate, concrete steps to ensure the safety and dignity of all students,\u201d Willingham-Jaggers told CNN in a statement. \u201cHate has no place in our schools, and it\u2019s our collective responsibility to create systems where every student can thrive without fear.\u201d Minnesota state Rep. Leigh Finke, a Democrat and the first\u00a0out\u00a0transgender lawmaker in the state\u2019s legislature, condemned the school and police\u00a0for their\u00a0responses\u00a0to the incident. Finke said violence\u00a0against transgender youth like Benedict and Sovereign will \u201ccontinue unabated until accountability and responsibility is accepted.\u201d \u201cThe response of Hopkins High School and the Minnetonka Police so far sends the same transphobic message to\u00a0(\u2026)\u00a0the world: do as you will and if no one decides to take it public, you\u2019ll get away with it. Is that the message that we want to send?\u201d Finke said in a statement. \u201cWe want to see Hopkins High School and Minnetonka Police, and every school and police department in the future to do what is right and take immediate action, not because people are looking, but because transgender folks everywhere are entitled to live a life free of fear, and violence,\u201d Finke added.

Nassau County Police Commissioner Patrick Ryder previously said the event received an ISIS-K-linked threat in April, followed by more specific threats against Sunday\u2019s highly anticipated matchup at Nassau County International Cricket Stadium on Long Island.

{"id": "2024_06_07_us_911-dispatcher-pennsylvania", "text": "Prosecutors this week dropped an involuntary manslaughter case against a 911 dispatcher in Pennsylvania who had been accused of failing to send an ambulance to the rural home of a woman who was found dead a day later of internal bleeding. Greene County District Attorney Brianna Vanata said she acted to end the\u00a0case against Leon \u201cLee\u201d Price\u00a0after reviewing an investigator\u2019s report that said he felt charges were not justified in the July 2020 death of 54-year-old Diania Kronk. \u201cThere was just no criminal culpability here,\u201d Vanata said in a phone interview Thursday. She said the decision to pursue charges two years after Kronk died \u2014 and shortly after her family filed a lawsuit over it \u2014 was a mistake by the then-district attorney, Dave Russo. \u201cI\u2019m not sure what the previous district attorney was thinking,\u201d Vanata said. \u201cThat\u2019s where I\u2019m at.\u201d Price\u2019s defense lawyer, Timothy Ross, said Thursday the charges had been a stressful ordeal for his client, who he described as an upstanding employee who had consistently maintained he was innocent of the allegations. In the wake of Kronk\u2019s death, Ross said, an investigator had told Price he would not be charged. Ross said Price is \u201cmoving forward, rebuilding his reputation in this community and just happy to put these charges behind him.\u201d Investigators had said Price was reluctant to dispatch help without getting more assurances Kronk would actually go to the hospital. Vanata said she based her decision on an August 2020 memo by Greene County Regional Police Chief Zachary Sams that said Price may not have been trained properly and the investigator felt Price\u2019s actions did not \u201crise to the levels necessary to facilitate a criminal charge.\u201d On a recording, Price was heard questioning Kronk\u2019s daughter, Kelly Titchenell, for about four minutes. As Titchenell described her mother\u2019s condition, Price asked if Kronk was \u201cwilling to go\u201d to the hospital about a half-hour away from her home in Sycamore. Titchenell assured him she would and said she was concerned her mother might die. Titchenell told the dispatcher Kronk had been drinking heavily for some weeks, she had been losing weight and appeared to be turning yellow. Price said he would send an ambulance but then added that \u201cwe really need to make sure she\u2019s willing to go.\u201d Price asked Titchenell to call once she got to Kronk\u2019s home, but Titchenell said she could not find her mother\u2019s landline and there was no cell service. Titchenell said that when she got to Kronk\u2019s home, her mother was nude on the porch and talking incoherently, telling her repeatedly she was OK. Titchenell said an autopsy attributed Kronk\u2019s death to internal bleeding. Titchenell did not call 911 again on her way home, believing that her uncle would soon check on her mother. The uncle discovered the next day that Kronk had died. Russo defended the charges on Thursday, saying there was ample evidence and called Vanata\u2019s move to drop the case a political decision. Russo said the involuntary manslaughter charge had survived previous efforts by the defense to have it dismissed. At Vanata\u2019s request, a judge withdrew the charges on Monday. Jury selection and trial had been scheduled for next week. Vanata said she approached Price about a potential plea bargain to a lesser charge but he did not take the deal. Titchenell questions the decision to drop charges. \u201cI feel that there was too much for the new district attorney to go through,\u201d Titchenell said in a phone interview Wednesday. \u201cShe would have had to put in a lot of time and work to understand this case, to go over everything. I feel there was too much for her, so she was trying to basically get away without going to trial.\u201d Vanata, who beat Russo in the\u00a02023 GOP\u00a0primary by 44 percentage points, said she spent \u201cmany, many hours\u201d going through the evidence since taking office in January. \u201cIt definitely was not an easy decision to come to.\u201d Price is no longer a dispatcher and now works for Greene County in maintenance. \u201cMr. Price did lose his job and this, I\u2019m sure, has been an ordeal for him,\u201d Vanata said. \u201cBut also I feel so horrible for the family that had to go through this as well.

{"id": "2024_06_09_politics_mayorkas-biden-asylum-action", "text": "Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas on Sunday pushed back on criticism of President Joe Biden\u2019s new executive action restricting asylum while calling on Congress to take action on the border. \u201cIt\u2019s early, the signs are positive. Our personnel have done an extraordinary job in implementing a very big shift in how we operate on the southern border,\u201d Mayorkas said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week,\u201d noting that implementation of the new policy \u2014 announced last Tuesday \u2014 has only just begun. The executive action \u2014 which bars migrants crossing the border illegally from seeking asylum, with some limited exceptions, once an average daily threshold is met \u2014 marked the administration\u2019s most dramatic move on the US southern border, which former President Donald Trump has made a central focus of his 2024 campaign. But the attacks on the new policy from both Republicans and progressive Democrats have underscored the precarious position Biden is in on immigration ahead of the November election. Republican Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas, for example, accused Biden of \u201cgaslighting\u201d Americans on Sunday. \u201cPeople need to understand that what Biden has done, he\u2019s not doing anything to actually secure the border, in fact it\u2019s the opposite,\u201d Abbott said on Fox\u2019s \u201cSunday Morning Futures\u201d \u201cWhen he stops the asylum process, there\u2019s nothing that Biden is doing that actually is preventing anybody else from crossing the border. There\u2019s no type of enforcement mechanism in place.\u201d While the number of encounters between ports of entry is still high, it\u2019s too early to know the policy\u2019s impact. Still, Mayorkas insisted the restrictions on asylum would reduce the number of people who try to cross the border. \u201cOur intent is to really change the risk calculus of individuals before they leave their countries of origin and incentivize them to use the lawful pathways that we have made available to them and keep them out of the hands of exploitative smugglers,\u201d Mayorkas told ABC\u2019s Martha Raddatz. The new policy would have been in effect for at least the last three years because of a surge in migrant encounters, a CNN data analysis shows. Pressed on why the administration did not act sooner once the bipartisan immigration deal fell apart\u00a0in February, Mayorkas pointed to the second attempt to advance the measure, which failed last month because of GOP opposition and Democratic divisions. \u201cThe bipartisan deal was rejected once, we pressed forward again. It was rejected a second time and then we developed this and have implemented it,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we\u2019re at an early stage, and let\u2019s not minimize the significance of this move and the significance of operationalizing it. And it requires the cooperation of other countries which we have secured.\u201d But Mayorkas again called on Congress to do more. \u201cWhat we need is congressional action. We cannot resource the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of State, the Department of Justice with additional personnel. We need Congress to legislate.\u201d In February, Senate Republicans blocked the\u00a0major bipartisan border deal and foreign aid package\u00a0amid a torrent of attacks on it from Trump and top House Republicans. Democrats revived the border measure in May in an effort to put pressure on Republicans and shift the narrative on border security, but the bill ended up exposing divides among Democrats and threatening to undermine the party\u2019s messaging effort. Biden\u2019s new measure has further exposed that division, with some progressives coming out against it and comparing it to Trump administration policies. Democratic Sen.

{"id": "2024_06_07_us_louisville-police-body-camera-scheffler", "text": "Three Louisville Metro police officers failed to activate their body cameras, in violation of policy, during the arrest of golfer Scottie Scheffler near Valhalla Golf Club in Louisville, Kentucky, on May 17, an investigation found. Scheffler was arrested for allegedly refusing to stop while on his way to a golf tournament and dragging a police officer, according to an internal investigation released by the department Friday. According to the documents, Detectives Bryan Gillis, Kelvin Watkins and Officer Javar Downs did not turn on their bodycam, which is a violation of police procedures. Scheffler, 27, was attempting to drive to the Valhalla Golf Club in Louisville, Kentucky for a tournament when he came to the scene of a fatal crash around 6 a.m., CNN previously reported. He allegedly injured a police officer who was directing traffic and was then detained and arrested. According to a statement given to police, Gillis said while directing traffic, he observed a vehicle traveling in the opposing lanes toward him. \u201cI  stopped the driver and advised him he could not proceed because of the  bus. He demanded to be let in, proceeded forward against my directions. I  was dragged/knocked down by the driver,\u201d the statement said. \u201cI then  proceeded to arrest the driver.\u201d According to the police\u2019s internal investigation, no other police department members witnessed the initial incident, due to a shuttle bus blocking their view. All charges against Scheffler were dismissed less than two weeks after his arrest, CNN previously reported. According to Gillis\u2019 statement, he never powered up his body cam because when he arrived on the scene, he \u201cimmediately started directing traffic.\u201d \u201cDetective Gillis should have had his issued BWC powered on and at least in standby mode,\u201d the Body-Worn Camera Failure to Record Form stated. It later added, \u201che failed to comply with powering it on.\u201d Detective Watkins said in a statement he \u201cdid not catch\u201d the initial confrontation with Gillis and Scheffler. \u201cMy  bodycam was activated after I realized that this was a potential  problem,\u201d he said in the statement. \u201cMy view was blocked by a bus,\u201d he  said. Officer Downs also failed to activate his bodycam because he said he was \u201ctasked with alleviating traffic,\u201d the document said. According  to the documents, Gillis was counseled by a member of his command on  May 22, and a performance observation was completed. In addition to being documented for failing to turn on his bodycam, Gillis was also cited for reaching into a vehicle while it was running. \u201cNot a violation of policy, but tactically poor decision making by Det. Gillis regarding reaching into a vehicle that is running, is in drive, and the operator has the ability to pull away/accelerate,\u201d the summary said. \u201cWhether Gillis grabbed Mr. Scheffler\u2019s arm, or Mr. Scheffler pinned Gillis\u2019s arm with his knee is immaterial had Gillis not crossed the plain into the vehicle\u2019s passenger compartment.\u201d The summary said \u201cthe charges at the time\u201d were only traffic offenses and Gillis \u201chas been verbally counseled regarding risk versus reward in response to this incident.\u201d The investigation findings did support Gillis\u2019s actions by saying \u201cEvery other driver did as directed throughout the abnormal operations outside Valhalla.\u201d This story has been updated with additional details.

{"id": "2024_06_07_us_death-row-visitors-executions-cec", "text": "On August 9, 2018, Steven Hale stood outside a Tennessee prison as a convicted murderer inside awaited a lethal dose of a three-drug cocktail. It was the first execution of a death row inmate in the state in nearly a decade. Hale was one of seven reporters selected by a grim lottery to witness Billy Ray Irick\u2019s execution at the Riverbend Maximum Security Institution in Nashville. He\u2019d written stories about Irick\u2019s horrific rape and murder of a 7-year-old girl more than three decades earlier. But nothing prepared him for that night in 2018. Not far away, in an area reserved for death penalty supporters, a man blared AC/DC\u2019s \u201cHells Bells\u201d from a loudspeaker. And as a chaperone led Hale and other journalists to the execution chamber, Hale saw another small group of people huddled in a field outside the prison. They were there to show their love for Irick. One man told Hale he had called the prison earlier and pleaded with officials to let him sit in the death chamber so Irick would see a friendly face just before he died. The man sobbed when a prison official said no, Hale says. That night, as Irick took his last breath in the execution chamber, the group held a vigil outside the prison, hoping to claim his body for a memorial. Their stories lingered with Hale long after the execution. He soon became fascinated with the commitment shown by these supporters. They were not relatives of the prisoners, or death row groupies. Nor were they anti-death penalty activists \u2014 at least, not at the beginning. They were strangers united in one mission: visiting, befriending and comforting death row inmates in what might be their final months. \u201cI didn\u2019t know these people existed,\u201d Hale told CNN. \u201cI didn\u2019t know anyone was going out there to just visit people on death row, not as attorneys, not even family members, just as regular folks.\u201d He began to join their weekly trips to Riverbend, where they sat with death row prisoners and talked about everything from football to their families. For Tennesseeans on both sides of the death penalty issue, it was a turbulent time. In a span of less than two years after Irick was put to death, Tennessee held six more executions, a string unlike any other seen in the state since the 1940s. Hale witnessed two of those executions, in addition to Irick\u2019s. He chronicles his experiences in a new book, \u201cDeath Row Welcomes You: Visiting Hours in the Shadow of the Execution Chamber,\u201d which explores the complexities of Tennessee\u2019s capital punishment system and the unique friendships that develop between condemned murderers and the strangers who visit them. The book documents the prisoners\u2019 troubled pasts and examines their perspective after decades in prison, away from the public. \u00a0Hale said he was struck by the normalcy of the conversations he and others had with prisoners during their many visits. \u201cThese gatherings are so ordinary as to be extraordinary and so life-giving as to feel defiant,\u201d Hale writes in the book. He told CNN that during one of his visits, a death row inmate learned he had gone to Auburn University and began needling him. \u201cHe was teasing me about Auburn and saying it was overrated that year \u2026 it almost felt like I could be in a bar somewhere.\u201d \u201cIn that visitation room, everything felt normal,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then when we walked out, and there was a barbed wire and armed guard, you kind of remember, \u2018Oh, yeah, I\u2019m in a maximum-security prison.\u2019 \u201c Hale, 36, is a reporter for the Nashville Banner. CNN talked to him about his personal encounters with death row prisoners and the unique community of visitors \u2014 in the tradition of \u201cDead Man Walking\u201d\u2018s Sister Helen Prejean \u2014 who show them love in their final months. His answers have been edited for length and clarity. How did you go from writing about death row inmates to immersing yourself into their world? I was covering criminal justice in Tennessee and had an interest in the death penalty. But when I moved to Tennessee in 2010, there were no executions going on. It was that way until around 2014, when the state started scheduling some executions. I volunteered to witness one of those executions as a reporter, and was gearing up for that when it got called off because of litigation over lethal injection drugs. And then in 2018, the state scheduled a number of executions after the lethal injection litigation was completed and I started covering those cases. I was trying to interview him (Irick) or any of the men on death row.\u00a0 And here in Tennessee, it\u2019s very difficult to get access to incarcerated people as a as a reporter, particularly on death row. And during that process, I met a couple of people \u2013 just regular civilians \u2013 who went out to the prison to visit death row inmates. I was just so taken by this community. I started feeling like there was a bigger story there. When was your first visit with the death row inmates and what was that like? Not long after the first execution. I visited death row with this community of people and sat in that room with them.\u00a0 I was just so moved by that experience. It was unlike anything I\u2019d ever been around. And that\u2019s when I thought, I think I might have a book to write here. Just because there were all these people coming from different places who were together in this room. And it was so different than I had imagined. What stood out to you about that first visit? The visitors\u2019 wide demographic. There are some young folks who go out there to visit, and then there are some older folks who go there either through a church or community organization. The first night I went out to death row for these visitations, I was sitting there \u2026 and there was an older woman next to me.\u00a0 I can\u2019t say exactly how old she was, but she looked older than my parents. There was an older White woman sitting with a Black man on death row. So the ages and demographics are all kind of mixed up in there, and it was fascinating to see that. The people in this community are really not activists. Maybe they see themselves that way now. But when they got into this, they were not. Why do these people visit death row and attend executions? Many of the visitors I met and wrote about in the book started visiting death row through a church or because another visitor invited them. Their reasons vary. In many cases, I think they see it as an expression of their Christian faith. For others, what started out as a sort of personal journey turned into something else. What do the death row inmates think about their visits?\u00a0 I think the visits are very important to them because of the normal social needs we all have \u2026 these relationships represent an acceptance of who they are today. The courts and the prison and much of society have locked them in as the person they were 30 or 40 years ago, a person who did horrible things. But the friendships they\u2019ve developed with regular visitors aren\u2019t defined by that. How did you reconcile death row inmates\u2019 crimes with who they are now?\u00a0 That\u2019s a good question and something I asked some of those visitors myself. I asked them, how much research did you do on some of these guys? Did you feel that you need to know what they were on death row for before you met them? One of the visitors told me, \u2018I didn\u2019t. I don\u2019t\u00a0 Google people when I meet them in regular life.\u2019 And so I decided not to, because I knew the person that I would find online wasn\u2019t gonna be the person that I would meet. But there\u2019s one \u2026 (inmate) \u2026 in the book in particular that I became quite close with. His name\u2019s Terry Lynn King, and I did not look up a lot about his case. (King was convicted of first-degree murder and has been on Tennessee\u2019s death row since 1985). One thing I\u2019ve always said, and that other visitors have said to me, is you know enough just by the fact that the person\u2019s on death row. You know you only get there because you were convicted of killing someone, or more than one person. So for a lot of the visitors and for myself, that was kind of enough. I knew as a journalist \u2013 and for the book \u2013 that I was gonna have to get very deep into their past and the crimes they\u2019d committed. But as far as meeting them in the present, I wanted to just meet the person who was there then and take them on those terms. What kind of preparation did you have to make for visits with death row inmates? I tried not to think too much about it. The first time I went to Riverbend Maximum Security Institution for an execution, it felt very heavy psychologically.\u00a0 But the next time I went was to visit death row. So in some way, that was a much lighter evening because I knew I wasn\u2019t there for an execution. I was there with people who had been there before, and they were excited to see their friends on death row. As a reporter, I just wanted to soak as much of it in as as I could. I was in this atmosphere and environment that most people never get to see. How does the visitation process work? Tennessee\u2019s death row has a sort of unique setup in that it has a tiered system with levels. So when people first get there, they\u2019re very much kind of locked down in the more traditional way, and then based on time and behavior, they can get more privileges (such as visits). They are out of their cells most of the day and are able to do arts and crafts and buy food from the commissary and that kind of thing. In the book, I mention how Terry came with a bag of microwave popcorn, and was like, \u201cdo you want some popcorn?\u201d And went over to the corner and popped it.\u00a0It\u2019s such a surreal experience to go into the visitation gallery on death row. How big is the community of people who visit these inmates? It\u2019s hard to say, because there are consistently regular visitors and then there are others like me. But the community I talk about in the book has probably a dozen people. The first time I went there, there were about 12 visitors from the outside and that many men on death row in the room.\u00a0 It\u2019s a pretty small community. But one of the fascinating things about it is that the people have made it their mission to make it a bigger community by inviting more people to go out there. I was one of those people. Has this experience changed your views on the death penalty? I\u2019ve grown up believing that grace and redemption were good things, and that killing people, even if they had killed other people, was wrong. And so I came into this as someone who was opposed to the death penalty. And the more I reported on it as a journalist, I became more aware of the way the death penalty system in America does not uphold its own standards. It\u2019s become arbitrary in the sense that there are some states where you can commit a crime, and you\u2019ll get sentenced to death. And in another state, you could commit the same crime, and you wouldn\u2019t. Even within states, there may be one county where you\u2019ll get sentenced to death for a crime but not in other counties. But the more I witnessed these executions, I became more convinced that the distance that we keep between ourselves as a society and this issue is a big part of what allows it (the death penalty) to persist. If more people spent time with people on death row, if they witnessed these executions, they may feel differently about them. In the history of the death penalty, we\u2019ve made a lot of changes in how we do it \u2014 you know \u2026 hanging people to electrocuting people to lethal injection. Now we\u2019ve got states trying gas, and other ways. But in my experience, seeing lethal injection and two electrocutions, no matter how you do it \u2014 it looks very clearly like killing a person.\u00a0 Once you see it up close, it\u2019s very obvious.\u00a0 In the book, I describe it as barbarism dressed as bureaucracy and armed with legal jargon. There\u2019s also a racial disparity in that the race of the victim has a very strong correlation with the sentence. People who kill white people have been more likely to be sentenced to death that people who kill black people. It\u2019s just not a fair way to handle those crimes. What executions did you witness, and did those inmates have any notable last words? I witnessed the lethal injection of Billy Ray Irick and the electrocutions of David Earl Miller and Stephen West.\u00a0Irick initially declined to make a final statement\u00a0before suddenly saying he was sorry. Miller just said, \u201cbeats being on death row.\u201d But the one that comes to my mind most often is West weeping in the electric chair. I don\u2019t know and can\u2019t really imagine everything that was going through his mind then. But I often see in my mind the image of him strapped in the electric chair with tears running down his face. What do you hope people take away from your book? I hope it challenges people\u2019s preconceived notions about both the men on death row and the kind of visitors they get. One thing that\u2019s core to the theme of the book is the premise of the death penalty \u2026 that there are some people who are so terrible that they cannot come back from it. They cannot be rehabilitated or changed. And I have seen that is not true. Because I have met some of the people on Tennessee\u2019s death row who I would let in my house with my children. And that is not to diminish the crimes they committed. But it\u2019s because they\u2019re nothing like the person who committed that crime for a variety of reasons, whether it\u2019s mental health, whether it\u2019s substance abuse, whether it\u2019s the childhood they had. Some of the people I met have been on death row longer than I have been alive. They are not the same people anymore.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/07/us/death-row-visitors-executions-cec/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/10/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_09_politics_trump-probation-interview-hush-money", "text": "Former President Donald Trump is scheduled for a pre-sentencing interview with a probation officer Monday after his hush money trial conviction last month, according to a Trump campaign official and two sources familiar with the matter. The interview will be virtual and, as CNN previously reported, Trump attorney Todd Blanche will be present. Typically, a convicted defendant meets with a probation officer without an attorney. Monday\u2019s routine pre-sentencing interview, which was first reported by NBC News, will form part of the report the probation department will submit to Judge Juan Merchan to help decide Trump\u2019s punishment ahead of his sentencing, set for July 11. Last month, a Manhattan jury found Trump \u2013 the presumptive GOP presidential nominee \u2013 guilty of all 34 charges in his hush money trial, making him the first former president to be convicted of a felony. Trump does not have to cooperate with the routine pre-sentencing investigation, but a judge can take a negative inference from a defendant\u2019s lack of cooperation with the process. In the pre-sentencing interview, a defendant is typically asked about their conviction and other basic background information such as their employment and criminal history. As part of the process, Trump\u2019s legal team can submit letters of support from his friends and family to Merchan. The former president\u2019s team is scheduled to submit its sentencing recommendation Thursday, according to a source familiar with the plan. \u201cPresident Trump and his legal team are already taking necessary steps to challenge and defeat the lawless Manhattan DA case,\u201d Trump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung said in a statement Saturday. The Manhattan District Attorney\u2019s Office will also submit a memo telling the judge what sentence it sees fit for Trump. Merchan could sentence Trump to probation or up to four years in state prison on each count, with a maximum of 20 years. Prosecutors have never sought to remand Trump into custody, so the former president is free as he awaits sentencing.

You can sign up\u00a0right here. You can listen to an audio version of the newsletter by clicking the same link. How do we know if the economy is in decline? The answer might be on our lips. Estee Lauder chairman Leonard Lauder created the lipstick index during the economic downturn following September 11, 2001. He noticed that the purchase of cosmetics, lipsticks in particular, tend to be inversely related to the economy because women replace more expensive purchases with small pick-me-ups. In fall 2001, US lipstick sales increased by 11%. And back during the Great Depression, cosmetics sales overall increased by 25%. In 2020, at the height of the Covid economic downturn, Estee Lauder\u2019s CEO Fabrizio Freda said that the lipstick index had been replaced by a skincare item as customers donned masks and worked from home. \u201cThe lipstick index has been substituted with the moisturizing index,\u201d said Freda. \u201cBut the concept of the index is still there.\u201d Now we may be seeing that phenomenon rear its head once more. Sephora recently announced a record sales year and data from consumer research group Circana shows that prestige beauty growth has outpaced mass beauty sales, growing 9% and 2%, respectively in the first quarter of the year. Of course, the so-called lipstick index is a less technical \u2014 and more fun \u2014 measure of\u00a0economic downturn and isn\u2019t always entirely accurate. But as the free-spending post-pandemic\u00a0party comes to an end in the US, it\u2019s something worth exploring. Before the Bell spoke with Neela Montgomery, CEO of Overeon (a collective of premium cosmetics brands including BareMinerals, Laura Mercier, and Buxom) about the outlook for beauty in an uncertain economic climate. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. Before the Bell: We\u2019ve been writing a lot at CNN about how Americans are beginning to rein in their spending. Consumers seem to be taking a hit right now. But data shows that more expensive prestige beauty sales are outpacing mass, lower-priced beauty sales. How do you explain that? Neela Montgomery: Beauty shifted a bit during the Covid times because it became self-care purchase orientated. I do think that\u2019s making it more resilient to broader economic trends. As people are thinking about where to reduce spending, it\u2019s more likely to be in fashion and very high-priced discretionary goods than beauty. What\u2019s very interesting about beauty and one of the things I really like about the industry is that we continue to innovate, it\u2019s fast-paced and there are new trends all the time for people to keep up with. So Bare Minerals Lip Gloss Balm is a huge new product for us\u2026it\u2019s like a micro-moment of pleasure that people can treat themselves to. I think that is still very appealing and seems relatively easy to access for $24. So I think that is why it\u2019s more resilient. It\u2019s more about the comparative nature of prices and what customers are using products for. Do you think the industry has been just resilient or have you seen a boost? I think if you look at the broader prestige market, it\u2019s been enormously resilient across all demographics including age and income. Skincare drove a lot of that for a while and now fragrance and makeup are dominating again. The category remains way, way higher than one would expect. It\u2019s a considered purchase, but it\u2019s not so discretionary that it\u2019s unobtainable. You mentioned that trends move quickly in the beauty industry, are TikTok and other social platforms driving sales and have you adjusted your products based on influencer trends?\u00a0 Well, Laura Mercier is very much about a flawless face and what makes you unique makes you beautiful so we recognize that a trend like glassy skin is not for that brand. But the latte look could be, so we think about it more in terms of palette trends. For example, we\u2019re about to launch a caviar matte lipstick, and matte lipstick has definitely made a huge comeback \u2013 it\u2019s also super popular in Asia, which is a very high growth part of our business. So we think about overall trends and then TikTok trends specifically where they\u2019re relevant. We can\u2019t respond to every microtrend, we\u2019re not in that kind of development cycle, but if it relates to our brand, how we then go to market and talk about it very much resonates on TikTok. And then the other thing I would say about TikTok that I think is fascinating is the role of these communities. Social selling has become almost 20% of our brand .com sales. That\u2019s a really interesting and important trend because what matters these days for a brand is what people say about you to each other rather than what you say about yourself. What do you see dominating the beauty market in the second half of the year?\u00a0 Clean has become a real buzzword in this industry, but this whole idea of no-tox (anti-botox), remains a really important thing\u2026 The market is bifurcating between this very authentic, real look and people who are getting more cosmetic work done. What we see is a need for more of these kinds of efficacious products for people who don\u2019t want to go down the cosmetic procedure route or injectables route. And then we continue to see that sort of clean girl with a pop of color look. So you know, we have this sort of red lip\u2026We continue to see that grow and expand. I think what\u2019s fascinating is how informed people are about ingredients \u2013 whether it\u2019s a sesame seed extract in the lip gloss, or using sea buckthorn or just being educated around some of these unique natural ingredients that have, probably not the same efficacy, but have efficacy as well compared to more more obvious things like retinol. As AI booms, Microsoft\u2019s deal with a startup comes under federal investigation The Federal Trade Commission is investigating a recent Microsoft deal with artificial intelligence startup Inflection, according to a person familiar with the matter, as US antitrust regulators ramp up scrutiny of the red-hot AI industry. Microsoft announced in March that it had\u00a0hired Inflection\u2019s co-founders\u00a0and a number of its staff to lead its Copilot program, and Inflection said its AI model\u00a0would be hosted\u00a0on Microsoft\u2019s cloud platform. As part of that deal, Microsoft was\u00a0said to have paid Inflection $650 million. In its announcement at the time, Microsoft described the move\u00a0as merely a hiring decision, not as an acquisition. The FTC probe into Microsoft concerns whether the company\u2019s investment in Inflection constituted an acquisition that Microsoft failed to disclose to the government, one of the people said. The investigation comes as antitrust officials at the FTC and the Justice Department are nearing a final agreement this week on how to jointly oversee AI giants such as Microsoft, Google, Nvidia, OpenAI and others, two people familiar with the matter told CNN. That agreement, which could be finalized within days, would appoint the DOJ as the lead investigator of Nvidia, while the FTC would take responsibility for investigating Microsoft and OpenAI, the people said. DOJ will likely continue its role in overseeing Google, one of the people indicated. Any investigations would focus on whether the companies have used their dominant positions in the AI industry to harm competition through abusive and illegal behavior. The agreement shows enforcers are poised for a broad crackdown on some of the most well-known players in the AI sector, said Sarah Myers West, managing director of the AI Now Institute and a former AI advisor to the FTC. \u201cClearance processes like this are usually a key step before advancing an investigation,\u201d West said. \u201cThis is a clear sign they\u2019re moving quickly here.\u201d Microsoft declined to comment on the DOJ-FTC agreement but, in a statement, defended its partnership with Inflection.

As the victims, some as young as 14 years old, recover from their injuries \u2013\u00a0none life-threatening \u2013 police are asking the public for any information or videos to help lead them to a suspect. \u201cIt is truly a miracle that no one is dead,\u201d Madison Police Chief Shon Barnes said at a news conference Sunday morning. Emergency personnel responded to what police believe may have been a high school graduation party when the shooting started, just before 1 a.m. Sunday. Police found one teen who suffered multiple gunshot wounds bleeding in the street, and rushed in to the apartment building on Johnson Street, Barnes said. \u201cOfficers watched as dozens of people rushed out of the building, running in panic and tripping over one another, simply trying to find safety,\u201d he said. After running up 12 flights of stairs to reach those at the party, police said they found a chaotic scene. Authorities estimated there were several hundred people on the rooftop. Police said victims range in age between 14 and 23 years old, with some victims still in high school. Nine people suffered gunshot wounds or bullet grazes and one person was injured by broken glass at the scene, Barnes said. \u201cThese students should have been celebrating summer vacation and not receiving medical treatment,\u201d he told reporters. The Madison Fire Department said it took five people with gunshot wounds to the hospital by ambulance, while other victims reported to the hospital on their own. Four ambulances and two engine companies helped triage, treat and transport patients at the scene, the department said in a statement. \u201cSome people on scene suffered minor injuries while attempting to run away from the scene but did not request EMS,\u201d the statement added. Authorities recovered approximately 10 shell casings at the scene and are going through apartment and public cameras to try to piece together what happened, Barnes said. With no reported motive or suspects, police are asking anyone video taken at the event to come forward. \u201cWhenever there\u2019s someone who\u2019s fired a gun indiscriminately like this, there\u2019s always a threat to the community,\u201d Barnes said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to work to ensure that whoever is responsible for this is brought to justice, but we can only do that with the help of our community.\u201d Earlier this year, the Madison police and fire departments teamed up to train for how to respond to a situation like this one, Barnes said, \u201chowever, we didn\u2019t expect to put it into practice so soon.\u201d Alder Mike Verveer, who represents downtown in\u00a0Madison\u2019s Common Council, said multiple law enforcement agencies were at the scene when he arrived. \u201cI was lying in bed at my house \u2026 and heard siren after siren roll by and roll through the neighborhood, and I never would have guessed that it was something as horrific as what I heard was potentially the case, which was a mass shooting,\u201d Verveer said. \u201cI was absolutely horrified. I was absolutely horrified and the sirens didn\u2019t stop.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/09/us/madison-wisconsin-shooting-multiple-injuries/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/10/2024", "section": "us"}}
