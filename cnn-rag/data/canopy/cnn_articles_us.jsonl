{"id": "2024_06_23_us_kerry-max-cook-exonerated-texas", "text": "After nearly 47 years, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals this week exonerated Kerry Max Cook for the 1977 murder of Linda Jo Edwards, declaring him innocent of a crime for which he spent nearly 20 years on death row. \u201cThis case is riddled\u00a0with allegations of State misconduct that warrant setting aside Applicant\u2019s conviction,\u201d\u00a0Judge Bert Richardson\u00a0wrote in the court\u2019s opinion delivered Wednesday, which said evidence favorable to Cook was withheld and that some of the evidence presented in his first trial in 1978 was later revealed to be false. \u201cAnd\u00a0when\u00a0it\u00a0comes\u00a0to\u00a0solid\u00a0support\u00a0for\u00a0actual\u00a0innocence,\u00a0this\u00a0case\u00a0contains\u00a0it\u00a0all \u2014 uncontroverted Brady violations, proof of false testimony, admissions of perjury, and new\u00a0scientific evidence.\u201d The case encompasses three trials and multiple appeals, including to the US Supreme Court. Cook was accused of the 1977 rape, murder and mutilation of 21-year-old Edwards in Tyler,\u00a0Texas. She was found in her bedroom by her roommate, Paula Rudolph. Cook lived in the same apartment complex as the victim, leading to him becoming a suspect. A set of fingerprints on Edwards\u2019 sliding patio door\u00a0matched Cook. Scientific analysis and expert testimony debunked the claim the fingerprints found on the patio door were \u201cfresh.\u201d Cook was sentenced to death at his first trial in 1979, but his conviction was later overturned on appeal.\u00a0The second trial in 1992 ended in a mistrial with the jury unable to meet a unanimous verdict.\u00a0A third trial in 1994\u00a0ended with a new conviction and death sentence.\u00a0The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals reversed the second verdict in 1996, stating misconduct by police and prosecutors. In 1999, the results of DNA testing on Edwards\u2019 underwear did not match Cook. Edward Scott Jackson, an inmate at Smith County Jail and the star witness in Cook\u2019s first trial testified Cook told him he had killed Edwards. He later recanted his testimony, saying, \u201cI lied on him to save myself.\u201d Jackson admitted he lied in exchange for a reduced sentence. Before a fourth trial in 1999, the state offered Cook a \u201cno contest\u201d plea deal for murder.\u00a0He was sentenced to 20 years and given credit for time served, leading to his release. However,\u00a0his conviction stood. Kerry Cook maintained his innocence through it all and has now been formally found innocent of Edwards\u2019\u00a0murder. \u201cKerry suffered immensely for nearly 50 years, and nothing can give him his life back,\u201d one of Cook\u2019s attorneys, Glenn Garber of the Exoneration Initiative, said in a statement to CNN. \u201cThe decision finally and forcefully clears his name, and at the same time chronicles the State\u2019s outrageous and unrelenting misconduct,\u201d Garber said. \u201cIt is important for the people of Tyler, Smith County, and the world to understand this travesty of justice and see it for what it was all along \u2013 a disturbing witch hunt by state actors.\u201d CNN has reached out to the office of Smith County District Attorney Jacob Putman for comment, who took office in 2019. The appeals court ruling this week noted it did not hold current prosecutors \u201cin any way responsible for the past events in this case.\u201d Now 68 years old, Cook is one of at least 199 people who were wrongly convicted and sentenced to death\u00a0to\u00a0have been exonerated since 1973, according to the Death Penalty Information Center.

{"id": "2024_06_25_business_federal-judge-denies-30-billion-settlement-visa-mastercard", "text": "A federal judge overseeing a $30 billion preliminary swipe-fees settlement between Mastercard, Visa and retailers formally rejected the deal Tuesday. The ruling likely means the credit card processors will have to make more concessions to resolve their long-standing dispute with merchants. Mastercard and Visa, two of the world\u2019s largest credit card networks, reached their proposed multi-billion antitrust settlement with US merchants in March. The settlement would lower swipe fees, or interchange fees, that a retailer must pay when a customer makes a purchase using their card. The details of Tuesday\u2019s ruling made by Judge Margo Brodie of the US District Court of the Eastern District of New York have not been made public. But a memo released by the court on Tuesday said that she was \u201cnot likely to grant final approval\u201d to the preliminary settlement absent any changes. Retailers typically are charged 2% of the total customer transaction in swipe fees \u2014\u202fbut they can be as much as 4% for some premium rewards cards, according to industry estimates. The proposed settlement would have lowered those fees by at least 0.04% percentage points for a minimum of three years. What the preliminary settlement entailed The proposed settlement, which hinged on final approval from the Eastern District of New York, resulted from a longstanding antitrust class-action lawsuit in 2005. In the suit, merchants alleged that the card companies and the banks that issue cards with them colluded to charge businesses inflated swipe fees and prevented them from directing their customers to other, cheaper payment options. Under the preliminary settlement, the card companies denied any wrongdoing and agreed to maintain the swipe fee rates that existed as of December 31, 2023, for a period of five years. Visa and Mastercard also agreed to remove anti-competitive restrictions so that merchants could suggest other preferred card options to customers going forward. For one thing, the proposed settlement gave merchants the ability to impose surcharges on customers depending on what kind of Visa or Mastercard card they use. Those surcharges would likely hit cardholders who get rewards such as cash back and airline miles, since those can carry higher swipe fees. Big retailers at odds with small businesses Over 90% of the merchants who agreed to the preliminary settlement with Visa and Mastercard were small businesses, according to Visa. Still, the National Federation of Independent Business viewed it as \u201ctemporary relief\u201d for small businesses and not a long-term solution, Jeff Brabant, vice president of federal government relations at NFIB, told CNN in a statement. Trade groups representing big retailers have been even more outspoken critics. The Merchants Payments Coalition (MPC) \u2014 whose members include supermarkets, retail chains, restaurants, drug stores, convenience stores, gas stations and online merchants focused on payments system reform \u2014 blasted the preliminary settlement as being insufficient. Christopher Jones, an executive committee member of the Merchants Payments Coalition, said it would have enabled the credit card companies to \u201ckeep price-fixing swipe fees and blocking competition.\u201d \u201cThankfully, the judge made the right call in recognizing what a bad deal this would have been for Main Street merchants and their customers,\u201d Jones said in a statement on Tuesday. The Retail Industry Leaders Association, a trade group representing a slew of large retailers including Target, CVS, Dollar General, similarly applauded Tuesday\u2019s ruling. \u201cLeading retailers are grateful that Judge Brodie saw through the fa\u00e7ade of the proposed settlement and understood that it would not provide the meaningful change that is needed to correct the competitive imbalance in the interchange ecosystem,\u201d RILA said in a statement. A Mastercard spokesperson told CNN in an emailed statement they were \u201cdisappointed\u201d by the ruling. \u201cWe believe the settlement presented a fair resolution of this long-standing dispute, most notably by giving business owners more flexibility in how they manage their card acceptance activities. We will pursue our options to ensure a proper resolution of this matter.\u201d Visa did not immediately respond to CNN\u2019s request for a comment. Glenn Licht, owner of Pescatore Seafood Company in New York, had been anxiously awaiting the final ruling on the settlement. Licht\u2019s business operates two seafood stores in New York City\u2019s iconic Grand Central Terminal market. One sells prepared seafood for takeaway, and the other is a grab-and-go sushi store. Pre-Covid, Licht said the businesses were 80% cash and 20% credit card payments. \u201cThat\u2019s totally flipped. Now it\u2019s a minimum of 80% credit cards and the rest is cash,\u201d he said. That means with his significant exposure to swipe fees, those extra charges can add up and can affect profitability. \u201cAs a small retailer, you feel the effects of that,\u201d he said. And separate to his two seafood shops, the company also has an online seafood business. \u201cWe also ship seafood nationwide. However, that business is 100% credit cards,\u201d Licht said. Licht said he never believed that the $30 billion settlement would \u201ctrickle down\u201d to him as a small merchant in a way that \u201cwould have been a gamechanger.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think the ruling will move the needle much on our financial statement,\u201d he said.

{"id": "2024_06_24_us_los-angeles-synagogue-palestinian-israeli-protest-violence", "text": "A pro-Palestinian protest held outside a Los Angeles synagogue devolved into chaotic street violence with pro-Israel counterprotesters on Sunday in an incident that several officials, including President Joe Biden, criticized as antisemitic. The Los Angeles Police Department said it responded to two protests Sunday in the predominantly Jewish neighborhood of Pico-Robertson, just south of Beverly Hills. Videos taken at the scene show police pushing pro-Palestinian protesters away from the entrance of the Adas Torah temple, an Orthodox synagogue. Chants of \u201cFree, free Palestine - from the river to the sea,\u201d and \u201clong live intifada,\u201d could be heard from among the pro-Palestinian protesters.\u00a0Participants blocked traffic, and video from the scene shows multiple altercations broke out in the middle of the street and on sidewalks. Officers arrested a person with a \u201cspiked flag,\u201d the police department told CNN. The person was issued a citation for possessing a prohibited item during a protest and released from custody. At a Monday news conference, Los Angeles Police Department Interim Chief\u00a0Dominic Choi said detectives are investigating \u201call acts of violence.\u201d He added that while residents are \u201cOK\u201d to protest peacefully, \u201cviolence\u00a0will not be tolerated.\u201d At the news conference, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said she plans on meeting with the city attorney\u2019s office to talk about the potential for permits for protests, people wearing masks at protests and \u201cestablishing\u00a0clear lines of demarcation between what is legal and what is not.\u201d Bass said she will also convene a meeting of leaders of houses of worship and cultural centers to discuss how to protect sacred spaces and keep congregants safe. Police will enhance their partnership with Jewish public safety organizations to review threats to the community, the mayor said. Protests around the Israel-Gaza war have become common across the United States since October, but Democratic officials sharply criticized Sunday\u2019s event for its violence and for taking place at a Jewish institution. \u201cI\u2019m appalled by the scenes outside of Adas Torah synagogue in Los Angeles. Intimidating Jewish congregants is dangerous, unconscionable, antisemitic, and un-American,\u201d Biden said on X. \u201cAmericans have a right to peaceful protest. But blocking access to a house of worship \u2013 and engaging in violence \u2013 is never acceptable.\u201d \u201cThe violent clashes outside the Adas Torah synagogue in Los Angeles are appalling,\u201d California Gov. Gavin Newsom said on X. \u201cThere is no excuse for targeting a house of worship. Such antisemitic hatred has no place in California.\u201d \u201cTargeting a synagogue, or targeting the members of a synagogue, is anti-Semitic,\u201d US Rep. Ted Lieu of California said on X. \u201cI strongly condemn the Pro-Palestinian demonstrators who engaged in anti-Semitism by targeting Adas Torah Synagogue and/or its congregants. Anyone who engaged in violence should be prosecuted.\u201d Jewish and Muslim advocacy groups say the war has led to skyrocketing hate crimes and bias incidents. The Anti-Defamation League reports that antisemitic incidents were up 140% in 2023 compared to the prior year. And the Council on American-Islamic Relations said last year marked the highest number of anti-Muslim bias reports it has received in nearly three decades. On Sunday, Bass said in a statement, \u201cI want to be clear that Los Angeles will not be a harbor for antisemitism and violence. Those responsible for either will be found and held accountable.\u201d Synagogue hosted Israel real estate event The protest stemmed from an Israel real estate event on Sunday at the Adas Torah synagogue, according to the synagogue\u2019s security director and social media posts from organizers. The event at the synagogue was promoted by a firm called My Home in Israel Real Estate, a group that has helped to facilitate marketing events for potential property sales in Israel and the West Bank to Jewish Americans. CNN has reached out to the group for comment. In response, pro-Palestinian groups announced plans to protest the event in a Friday Instagram post from the Palestinian Youth Movement and an LA-based chapter of the group. \u201cOur land is not for sale,\u201d the post stated. \u201cStand against settler expansion at Sunday\u2019s real estate event selling homes to build \u2018Anglo neighborhoods\u2019 in Palestine.\u201d The post then listed the synagogue\u2019s Los Angeles address. \u201cRacist settler expansionists are not welcome in Los Angeles!\u201d the account wrote in the caption. \u201cThis blatant example of land theft is operating in our own backyard. The Nakba is ongoing and must be confronted!\u201d Dan Braum, the volunteer security director for the temple, said the protesters blocked the entrance to the synagogue until police arrived and pushed them away. It\u2019s unclear how the chaos escalated, but videos shared on social media shows both groups taunting, shoving and grabbing each other outside the synagogue. The groups of demonstrators eventually began flowing down nearby streets, where more scuffles broke out, the videos show. In one video,\u00a0two\u00a0men appear to be wrestling on the ground as\u00a0others\u00a0kick\u00a0at them. Later, one of the men\u00a0\u2013\u00a0holding\u00a0an\u00a0Israeli\u00a0flag \u2013\u00a0appears\u00a0to have a bloodied face and mouth. Additional video showed an egg thrown at a pro-Palestinian activist and a man wearing a keffiyeh, a traditional Palestinian scarf, chased and punched on the ground by a man wearing a Jewish yarmulke or kippah. During many of the altercations, bystanders worked to pull and hold people apart. Los Angeles police began monitoring the situation around 10:30 a.m., Officer Tony Im told CNN. The crowd was ordered to disperse at some point, Im said, though no exact time was provided. He added that the situation appeared \u201cpretty calm\u201d hours later, but that police were closely monitoring the area. \u2018They came looking to escalate\u2019 Braum said the pro-Palestinian protesters had their faces covered, said \u201cvile, disgusting things\u201d and were \u201cready for a fight.\u201d \u201cThey come looking to escalate,\u201d he said. \u201cNot every single one of them, that would be unfair of me to say. But there are certain ones who come looking for violence and they get violence and they want the cameras recording.\u201d One man wearing a red keffiyeh over his face spoke to CNN affiliate KCAL as a counter-protester badgered him to \u201cshow your face.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not meant to be intimidating. Yeah, disruptive, for sure,\u201d the keffiyeh-wearing man said. \u201cThis is intimidating,\u201d he added, pointing at the counter-protester. \u201cWe didn\u2019t get in anyone\u2019s faces.\u201d However, resident Josh Golcheh disagreed. \u201cThey\u2019ve come to our home. They come and are attacking us. They bear-sprayed my friend who\u2019s standing right over here,\u201d he told KCAL. He said people he knew had been attacked. \u201cIt\u2019s just terrible.\u201d Rabbi Hertzel Illulian of the nearby JEM Community Center in Beverly Hills told KCAL violence \u201cdoesn\u2019t belong here\u201d and lamented what he saw as a double standard. \u201cI don\u2019t think the Jewish people would go in front of a mosque or the Christian people would go in front of a mosque to do such a thing,\u201d he said. \u201cNobody would accept this, but here, when it comes to Jews and Israel, everything is kosher, everything is okay.\u201d In a statement, the Jewish Federation Los Angeles nonprofit thanked Biden and other officials for their support. \u201cYesterday\u2019s abhorrent violence in the Pico-Robertson neighborhood of Los Angeles, the most densely populated Jewish area on the West Coast, is yet another example of the rising antisemitism and violence targeting Jews. Harassment, intimidation, and physical attacks against our Jewish community cannot be tolerated or normalized,\u201d the organization said. \u201cJews, like everyone else, have the right to live, pray, and gather in peace. We respect the constitutional freedom to protest. However, what we saw yesterday and are witnessing time and again across the nation, are protests that devolve into excuses to target and harm Jews.\u201d CNN\u2019s Elizabeth Wolfe, Amanda Jackson, Sarah Moon, Camila Bernal, Andy Rose, DJ Judd, and Paradise Afshar\u00a0contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/24/us/los-angeles-synagogue-palestinian-israeli-protest-violence/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/26/2024", "section": "us"}}

Debate countdown The Biden and Trump campaigns are making their final preparations for CNN\u2019s presidential debate on Thursday. Both teams have spent weeks honing their messages on an array of issues, from the economy to foreign affairs to abortion. President Joe Biden has sought to rally potential voters around reproductive rights, especially young female blocs that are crucial to his reelection chances. His campaign is hosting dozens of events across the country today to mark two years since the Supreme Court\u2019s Dobbs decision, which overturned Roe v. Wade and the federal legal right to an abortion. Meanwhile, former President Donald Trump praised Supreme Court justices over the weekend for their role in tightening state-level restrictions on abortion and limiting access to the procedure. 2. Dagestan attacks Three days of mourning have been declared in Russia\u2019s Dagestan province after at least 19 people were killed Sunday in what appeared to be coordinated attacks against churches, synagogues and police posts. Dagestan is home to a small Christian minority and even smaller Jewish population that appeared to be among the targets. The victims include 15 police officers, an Orthodox priest and four civilians, according to local authorities. No group has yet claimed responsibility. The attacks come three months after ISIS affiliate ISIS-K said it carried out an assault at the Crocus City Hall in Moscow that claimed more than 140 lives in one of Russia\u2019s deadliest terrorist atrocities in years. Russian law enforcement agencies told state-run news agency TASS on Sunday that the gunmen in Dagestan were \u201cadherents of an international terrorist organization.\u201d 3. Middle East Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Sunday that the \u201cintense phase of the war with Hamas (in Gaza) is about to end,\u201d and the military\u2019s focus could then shift to Israel\u2019s northern border with Lebanon. On the ground, around 800,000 people have been displaced from the southern Gaza city of Rafah, where conditions have been described by the United Nations food agency as \u201capocalyptic.\u201d Netanyahu has come under increasing pressure from members of his government and Israel\u2019s allies, including the US, to minimize civilian casualties and allow for more humanitarian aid to reach the Gaza Strip. 4. Hajj heat wave More than 1,300 people died on this year\u2019s Hajj pilgrimage with numerous cases due to heat stress as temperatures exceeded 125 degrees Fahrenheit in Saudi Arabia. More than 1.8 million worshipers took part in the pilgrimage despite the dangerous heat, according to Saudi Arabian authorities. Performing Hajj is one of the five pillars of Islam, which requires every Muslim who is physically and financially able to make the journey to the holy city of Mecca at least once in their life. Many Muslims save for years and complete the pilgrimage in their old age, leaving them especially susceptible to the heat. The Saudi government said a majority of the dead were \u201cunauthorized to perform Hajj\u201d and \u201cwalked long distances under direct sunlight, without adequate shelter or comfort.\u201d 5. Starliner Boeing and NASA have once again delayed the Boeing Starliner capsule\u2019s return to Earth from the International Space Station. Officials have pushed back Starliner\u2019s departure date several times after the vehicle, which launched astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams to the space station on June 5, experienced helium leaks en route. NASA has indicated the return of Starliner\u2019s inaugural crew won\u2019t come until July. \u201cWe are taking our time and following our standard mission management team process,\u201d said Steve Stich, NASA\u2019s Commercial Crew Program manager, in a Friday statement.

In contrast, her defense has accused off-duty police inside that Canton home of fatally beating O\u2019Keefe, dumping his body on the lawn and then conspiring through fabricated evidence and false testimony to frame Read. \u201cLadies and gentlemen, there was a cover-up in this case, plain and simple,\u201d defense attorney Alan Jackson said. \u201cYou\u2019ll surely say to yourself, \u2018I don\u2019t want to believe it, I don\u2019t want to believe that could happen in our community,\u2019 but sadly over these past eight weeks you\u2019ve seen it right before your eyes.\u201d Read, 45, has pleaded not guilty to charges of second-degree murder, vehicular manslaughter while intoxicated and leaving the scene of a collision. After closing arguments Tuesday morning, the jury began deliberations at about 1:30 p.m. and continued for about three hours. They will return on Wednesday morning. The closing arguments represent the end of a murder trial that has garnered interest both local and widespread, including accusations of witness tampering, a federal probe into the investigation, and groups of pink-wearing supporters chanting to \u201cFree Karen Read.\u201d The prosecution\u2019s case also has been hampered by a series of missteps and unusual investigative practices. Most notably, a lead investigator in the case, Massachusetts State Police Trooper Michael Proctor, admitted that he sent a series of sexist and offensive texts about Read in a private group chat, calling her a \u201cwhack job,\u201d mocking her medical issues and commenting to coworkers that he had found \u201cno nudes\u201d while searching her phone for evidence, CNN affiliate WCVB reported. Proctor apologized for the \u201cunprofessional\u201d comments on the stand, but the vulgar texts have been sharply criticized in and out of court, including from the governor. \u201cIt\u2019s completely unprofessional,\u201d Gov. Maura Healey told WCVB of the texts. \u201cIt does harm, frankly, to the dignity and the integrity of the work of men and women across the state police and law enforcement. So as a former attorney general and as governor, I am disgusted by that.\u201d At closing arguments, the prosecution condemned the texts as \u201cunprofessional, indefensible, (and) inexcusable\u201d but said they had no impact on the integrity of the investigation. The defense disagreed. \u201cThey cannot distance themselves from the stench of him on this case and this investigation. Those secret group chats illustrate the quality and care of this investigation,\u201d Jackson said. How the trial has gone The heart of the trial stems from what happened on one wintry evening in Canton over two years ago. On the night of January 28, 2022, Read and O\u2019Keefe went out drinking at two bars with friends. Shortly after midnight, the couple climbed into Read\u2019s SUV and drove to the home of O\u2019Keefe\u2019s colleague on Fairview Road for an after-party, court documents show. The prosecution alleged that the couple got into an argument that led to O\u2019Keefe getting out of the vehicle. A drunken Read then struck him with the vehicle and fled, leaving him to die in the snowy cold, prosecutors say. However, Read has said she dropped off O\u2019Keefe at the house and then drove to his home because she wasn\u2019t feeling well, according to court documents. The next morning, when she realized he was still not home, she drove in a snowstorm to look for him, and finally found his body in the front yard of the Canton house. Read and her legal team have alleged O\u2019Keefe was injured in a fight inside the house \u2013 including being mauled by the homeowners\u2019 German shepherd, Chloe \u2013 and then tossed out in the snow. They argued that Read was framed for his death and alleged a vast cop conspiracy and a corrupt investigation. Prosecutors have rejected that theory. Firefighters who responded to the scene that morning asked about his injuries, and Read told them, \u201cI hit him, I hit him,\u201d according to their testimony. In addition, Read\u2019s vehicle had a broken taillight, and pieces of the taillight were found outside the Canton home, prosecutors said. \u201cFrom all of those people within that house that evening, none of them at any point in time observed John O\u2019Keefe come into that house,\u201d Lally said in opening statements. \u201cThey saw the vehicle pull away and they just assumed that they (O\u2019Keefe and Read) left and that no one was coming.\u201d The trial began in April and featured testimony from several law enforcement officers, with some as witnesses and others as investigators. The prosecution has presented evidence that Read and O\u2019Keefe had a volatile relationship. O\u2019Keefe\u2019s niece and nephew said they heard the couple yelling in arguments prior to his death, and an ATF agent testified about his romantic kiss and text messages with Read, according to WCVB. Further, in the minutes after prosecutors say she hit him with the SUV, she called his phone and left a voicemail yelling, \u201cJohn, I f**king hate you!\u201d The defense has sharply questioned witnesses about whether Read truly confessed to hitting him with her vehicle and have challenged investigators about the quality of their work. For example, investigators used red plastic cups to collect evidence from the scene, and surveillance video of Read\u2019s vehicle was inexplicably flipped to a mirror image, WCVB reported. \u201cLie, obfuscate, manipulate, alter, and when they\u2019re caught, they just excuse it away,\u201d Jackson said in closing arguments. \u201cThat\u2019s not sloppiness,\u201d he added. \u201cThat\u2019s evidence manipulation.\u201d Aidan Kearney, a Massachusetts blogger nicknamed Turtleboy, has fed the ongoing debate with numerous posts alleging a murder coverup by law enforcement and local politicians. In October, Kearney pleaded not guilty to charges of\u00a0witness intimidation and conspiracy, CNN affiliate WBZ reported, after he allegedly called and sent messages to witnesses and investigators in Read\u2019s case.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/25/us/karen-read-murder-trial-closings/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/26/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_24_us_rapidan-dam-collapse-risk-minnesota", "text": "At least two people are dead after severe storms and major flooding hit the Midwest, according to officials, and a dam in southern Minnesota built in the early 1900s is at risk of failing. Rapidan\u00a0Dam\u00a0near Mankato was in \u201cimminent failure condition,\u201d The Blue Earth County government announced in a Monday Facebook post. \u201cWe do not know if it will totally fail or if it will remain in place, however, we determined it was necessary to issue this notification to advise downstream residents and the correct regulatory agencies and other local agencies,\u201d the county said. The dam \u2013 which has been in a \u201cstate of disrepair,\u201d according to a 2021 study \u2013 was still standing Tuesday afternoon, and the county said there are no current plans for mass evacuations. During a news conference, Gov. Tim Walz cautioned: \u201cWe are not out of the woods yet.\u201d Some communities have not reached peak water levels, he said. The water flow rate peaked Monday and has slightly decreased Tuesday, according to a news release from Blue Earth County emergency management officials. Authorities are continuing to monitor the dam. The flooding in Blue Earth County is threatening the family home of resident Jenny Barnes and their nearby business The Dam Store, CNN affiliate KARE reported. \u201cIt\u2019ll happen. We don\u2019t know when but it\u2019s going to be inevitable that the house is going to go,\u201d Barnes told KARE. The Dam Store, known for its homemade pies, has been in business since 1910 and owned by Barnes\u2019 family since 1972. \u201cThat\u2019s our life, as well. That\u2019s our business; that\u2019s our livelihood. It\u2019s everything to us,\u201d Barnes told KARE. \u201cThere\u2019s no stopping it. It\u2019s going to go where it wants to go. It\u2019s going to take what it wants to take. And everybody pray that it doesn\u2019t take The Dam Store.\u201d During the Tuesday news conference, Minnesota Department of Agriculture Commissioner Thom Petersen highlighted the concerns for farmers. While crops don\u2019t look damaged from a road perspective, Petersen said, the aerials show \u201cthe widespread difficulties our farmers face.\u201d Walz said the town of Waterville, in nearby Le Sueur County, also saw a \u201ccertainly dramatic\u201d impact from the flooding, with dozens of homes flooded up to the second floor. More than 40 National Guard soldiers were deployed to Waterville pump stations to ensure they operate around the clock, protecting critical infrastructure and homes, Minnesota National Guard Maj. Gen. Shawn Manke said during the news conference. Severe flooding has wreaked havoc across the Midwest for several days, leaving at least two people dead. A man in his mid-70s died in Clay County, Iowa, while trying to drive across rapid floodwaters on Saturday, according to a spokesperson from the county sheriff\u2019s office. The same day, an 87-year-old man died in a flood-related crash in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, according to the state highway patrol. In Iowa, days of catastrophic flooding and severe storms prompted President Joe Biden to approve a disaster declaration for some areas, freeing up federal funding for relief efforts. A levee failure Tuesday morning on the Little Sioux River prompted the evacuation of several Iowa communities. The city of Rodney in northern Monona County has been evacuated, with roads closed off to the public, the sheriff\u2019s office said in a Facebook\u00a0post\u00a0Tuesday morning, noting water had breached the levee in several spots. Authorities reported the levee failure just south of the city of Smithland at about 5 a.m. Tuesday, the National Weather Service said. A flash flood warning was issued for Rodney, the nearby city of Smithland and other rural areas near the river, officials said. About 30 miles north, significant flooding left the city of Correctionville closed to non-residents, according to\u00a0Woodbury County Emergency Management. Further north in Sioux City, the Big Sioux River crested at 45 feet, which is 7.3 feet above historic levels, prompting homes along the river to be evacuated Monday, officials said. Water rescue efforts continued on Tuesday afternoon, said South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem. The governor said one neighborhood in North Sioux City \u2013 McCook Lake \u2013 was in a \u201cvery dangerous situation\u201d with residents attempting to re-enter the area. \u201cWhole homes have fallen\u201d into McCook Lake, which is separated from Big Sioux River by Interstate 29, Noem said. The neighborhood has uprooted trees, live power lines across roads and 100-foot drop-offs in places where roads were washed out, along with other debris, the governor said. Officials don\u2019t expect the water levels to rise any further, Noem said, but she urged residents to stay away from the area as water levels recede \u201cslowly.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be safe for several days,\u201d said Noem. \u201cIf there\u2019s water, don\u2019t drive through it. If there\u2019s a barricade, don\u2019t drive around it.\u201d In Minnesota, Blue Earth County officials were first notified Sunday of \u201caccumulating debris\u201d at the Rapidan Dam. Workers from Blue Earth County Public Works, the emergency management agency and the sheriff\u2019s office are actively monitoring the dam, according to the Facebook post. The Blue Earth River has cut around the west side of the\u00a0dam, emergency management said, carrying\u00a0damaging debris and causing power outages. In a Monday evening update, the county noted that although there was a \u201cpartial failure on the west abutment,\u201d the \u201cdam is still intact.\u201d \u201cOur agencies are in close contact with Blue Earth County and other local officials regarding the Rapidan Dam near Mankato,\u201d Gov. Walz said in a statement Monday. \u201cEmergency management is on the ground and acting quickly to ensure the safety of Minnesotans as the situation develops.\u201d The\u00a0dam, which was\u00a0completed in 1910, is owned by the county and is capable of generating 6 million watts of hydroelectric power. It\u2019s about 70 miles southwest of Minneapolis. Dams can break for a number of reasons, including overtopping due to flooding and structural failure, according to FEMA. A 2021 report from Blue Earth County noted that regular flooding over the years, along with the \u201ctoll of time,\u201d have caused significant damage to the dam. The report identified two solutions: repair or remove the dam. The county noted that both options have significant costs.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/24/us/rapidan-dam-collapse-risk-minnesota/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/26/2024", "section": "us"}}

Lukas McClish, 34, set out for what he thought would be a three-hour hike in the Santa Cruz Mountains on June 11, according to CNN affiliate KGO. But he became lost in the mountains \u2013 partially due to the destruction of local landmarks in recent wildfires. His family officially reported him missing when he didn\u2019t show up for a Father\u2019s Day dinner on June 16, triggering search and rescue efforts, KGO reported. McClish was eventually found on Thursday thanks to a drone from the Santa Cruz Sheriff\u2019s Office, according to an X post from Cal Fire San Mateo, which said McClish was found in Big Basin Redwoods State Park \u2013 California\u2019s oldest state park and home to towering ancient coast redwood trees. \u201cThere were multiple reports of witnesses hearing someone yelling for help, but the location of that person was hard to establish,\u201d said Cal Fire.

{"id": "2024_06_24_us_dali-crew-members-ship-sails-virginia", "text": "Eight of the 21 crew members from the cargo ship that struck and destroyed a famed Baltimore bridge are back home Monday after myriad complications kept them confined on board for months. Two other crew members have also been cleared to return overseas, a spokesperson for the ship\u2019s manager said. The news came as the Dali cargo vessel started its journey Monday from Baltimore\u2019s Seagirt Marine Terminal to Norfolk, Virginia, to undergo repairs, said Darrell Wilson, spokesperson for ship manager Synergy Marine. Four crew members stayed on the ship to assist a relief crew during the Dali\u2019s voyage to Norfolk, Wilson said. After the journey is complete, they will join the seven remaining crew members, who must stay in the US indefinitely. The Dali\u2019s crew members, including 20 from India and one from Sri Lanka, had been stuck on the Dali since March 26. During the frigid predawn hours, the 984-foot ship lost power, veered off course and destroyed the Francis Scott Key Bridge,\u00a0killing six construction workers. While none of the crew members have been charged in connection with the disaster,\u00a0investigations are underway\u00a0to determine who might be responsible. The ship\u2019s officers are among the 11 crew members who must stay in the US, Wilson said. They have been cooperating with authorities, but it is unclear when they will get to leave. The seamen who will remain in the US are expected to stay in hotels or apartments, said the Rev. Joshua Messick, director of the Baltimore International Seafarers\u2019 Center and chaplain for the Port of Baltimore. \u201cThey\u2019re anxious, under considerable stress, considering they don\u2019t know what the future holds,\u201d Messick told CNN Thursday. \u201cThey don\u2019t know when they\u2019ll see their family again or how they\u2019ll be treated here.\u201d As for the 106,000-ton vessel, \u201cThe Dali is scheduled to transit directly to Virginia International Gateway to have roughly 1,500 cargo containers offloaded to reduce draft,\u201d the US Coast Guard said in a statement Monday morning. \u201cThe vessel is then scheduled to transit further to Norfolk International Terminal, where it is slated to undergo continued salvage and repairs from damage caused during the bridge collapse.\u201d While repair efforts continue, new details have emerged in a federal probe into what caused the deadly disaster. Investigators have zeroed in on a piece of the Dali\u2019s electrical system, which failed moments before the ship crashed into the bridge, the National Transportation Safety Board said in a Monday update. The update follows a preliminary report published last month, which said two circuit breakers on the Dali tripped, triggering a nearly ship-wide electrical blackout about three ships\u2019 lengths from the Francis Scott Key Bridge. On Monday, the NTSB said investigators have finished testing electrical components on board and have removed a wire connector known as a terminal block for further testing at the NTSB lab in Washington, DC. Investigators have found an \u201cinterruption in the control circuit\u201d in one breaker\u2019s undervoltage release, which would cause it to trip when voltage falls below predetermined thresholds, the NTSB said Monday. The NTSB\u2019s update is not final, and the agency has not found a probable cause of the crash, which could take months to determine.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/24/us/dali-crew-members-ship-sails-virginia/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/26/2024", "section": "us"}}

The pardon proclamation is expected to be announced on Wednesday and one official said it is set to affect roughly 2,000 people. The granting of pardons won\u2019t automatically change convicted veterans\u2019 records but allows those impacted to apply for a certificate of pardon that will help them receive withheld benefits. The pardon, which CNN is first to report on, specifically grants clemency to service members who were convicted under former Uniform Code of Military Justice Article 125 \u2014\u202fwhich criminalized sodomy, including between consenting adults\u00a0\u2014\u202fbetween\u00a01951 and 2013 when it was rewritten by Congress. It also applies to those who were convicted of attempting to commit those offenses. Anyone who was convicted of a non-consensual act such as rape will not be pardoned. The White House did not respond to a request for comment. Separately, the law known as \u201cDon\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell\u201d was repealed by Congress in 2011, but not before thousands of service members had been discharged from the military. A service member\u2019s discharge status can determine what kind of Veterans Affairs benefits they are eligible for. A bad-conduct discharge, for example, given under general court-martial, can make someone\u202fineligible\u202ffor services including a VA home loan military pension,\u00a0and education benefits. The pardon is separate from the Pentagon\u2019s ongoing review of military records for those who were discharged based on their sexual orientation, which one of the officials said did not apply to convictions under the UCMJ. The Pentagon launched a new outreach campaign last September to reach more veterans who believe they \u201csuffered an error or injustice\u201d to have their military records reviewed. \u201cFor decades, our LGBTQ+ service members were forced to hide or were prevented from serving altogether,\u201d Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said at the time. \u201cEven still, they selflessly put themselves in harm\u2019s way for the good of our country and the American people.\u201d In order to get their records changed under the pardon, individuals will need to complete an online application, which will go to their military service department. The services will then review the individual\u2019s court-martial and service record and determine if they are eligible for the pardon; that determination will then be sent to the attorney general,\u00a0acting through the Department of Justice\u2019s pardon attorney, a US official explained. The certificate of pardon does not automatically change someone\u2019s discharge status. If a certificate of pardon is issued, the service member will then have to apply to their respective military department\u2019s board of corrections to have their military records corrected.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/25/politics/biden-expected-pardon-veterans-convicted-gay-sex-law/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/26/2024", "section": "us"}}

Travis Eugene Posey, 44, opened fire at the\u00a0Mad Butcher in Fordyce\u00a0on Friday, armed with a pistol, a 12-gauge shotgun and a bandoleer with dozens of extra shotgun rounds, authorities said. Posey entered the not guilty plea during his first court appearance in\u00a0Ouachita County, where he has been held since the shooting in neighboring Dallas County, Jeff Rogers, the prosecuting attorney for the 13th\u00a0Judicial District of Arkansas, told CNN. He is being held without bond and his next court date has not been set. CNN has reached out to Posey\u2019s public defender for comment. Posey could face additional charges pending the outcome of the investigation, the Arkansas State Police said in a\u00a0news release. Authorities believe Posey began engaging victims in the parking lot after exiting his truck and then entered the store, Secretary of Public Safety and Director of Arkansas State Police Mike Hagar said at a Sunday news conference. He then fired \u201cindiscriminately\u201d at customers and employees inside the store, according to Hagar. \u201cThe suspect arrived at the Mad Butcher armed,\u201d he said. \u201cWe believe that most, if not all the rounds fired by the suspect were from the shotgun.\u201d A motive is unclear, police say. Law enforcement responded to the shooting around 11:30 a.m. and exchanged gunfire with the suspect, state police said. \u201cHe immediately engaged in a firefight with law enforcement, where they were able to stop the threat,\u201d Hagar said. Posey was treated for non-life threatening injuries and taken to the Ouachita County Detention Center, state police said in a news release. Victims remembered by family as loving parents and grandparent Seven people aged 20 to 65 were injured by gunfire and two responding officers were shot and wounded in the incident, according to police.

The memorial will honor the victims of the mass shooting that left 11 worshippers dead and six others wounded. Most of the synagogue was demolished starting earlier this year, according to CNN affiliate KDKA. \u201cAlmost six years ago, a white supremacist committed the deadliest attack on American Jews in our nation\u2019s history right here,\u201d said second gentleman Doug Emhoff at Sunday\u2019s groundbreaking ceremony. \u201cIt was (an) unspeakable act of terror, of violence, barbarism, fueled by antisemitic hate,\u201d Emhoff said. On October 27, 2018, gunman Robert Bowers burst into the Tree of Life synagogue armed with multiple firearms and shot congregants with an AR-15-style rifle. Four responding police officers were among those injured. Those killed were David and Cecil Rosenthal, 54 and 59; Richard Gottfried, 65; Dr. Jerry Rabinowitz, 66; Irving Younger, 69; Daniel Stein, 71; Joyce Fienberg, 75; Bernice and Sylvan Simon, 84 and 86; Melvin Wax, 87; and Rose Mallinger, 97.

{"id": "2024_06_25_economy_us-consumer-confidence-june", "text": "US consumer confidence teetered slightly in June as Americans grew a little warier about the future, new data released Tuesday showed. The Conference Board\u2019s latest consumer confidence index dipped to 100.4 in June from a downwardly revised level of 101.3 in May. June\u2019s reading landed in line with what economists were expecting but reinforced what\u2019s become a running theme: Despite continued economic growth and a historically strong labor market, Americans say their confidence has grown increasingly threadbare after a prolonged stint of high inflation and interest rates. \u201cThe details continue to demonstrate a hesitant, but not overly concerned, consumer,\u201d Wells Fargo economists Shannon Seery Grein and Jeremiah Kohl wrote in an investor note on Tuesday. Separate survey data released Tuesday by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\u2019s Consumer Finance Institute showed that while respondents maintained a net positive outlook on the economy, more than one-third of them reported concern about making ends meet in the next seven to 12 months. Measurements of Americans\u2019 confidence are typically closely watched, as consumer spending accounts for nearly 70% of US economic activity. But that significance is even more heightened now with the US presidential election just months away. Future outlook remains downbeat The Conference Board\u2019s latest report showed that Americans felt better about the labor market, which outweighed concerns about the future; however, consumers\u2019 feelings on current business conditions cooled, noted Dana Peterson, chief economist of the business membership and research organization. \u201cHowever, if material weaknesses in the labor market appear, confidence could weaken as the year progresses,\u201d she said in a statement. Consumers felt different levels of confidence around different parts of the economy. The present situations index ticked up to 141.5 (its highest level since March) from 140.8; however, the expectations index dropped to 73, marking the fifth consecutive month below 80, which the Conference Board considers as a threshold signaling a recession is ahead. The expectations index has been at or above that potential recession threshold only six months since March 2022, when escalating inflation forced the Federal Reserve to start a historic rate-tightening campaign. Inflation has cooled considerably during the past two years but is still above the central bank\u2019s 2% target. Interest rates remain at a 23-year high and have helped to tamp down demand. Although the strong jobs market has helped prop up consumer spending and kept the economy churning, the dual pressures of elevated inflation and high interest rates have weighed down some people. Credit card balances are growing and delinquencies are on the rise. The Philly Fed\u2019s latest Labor, Income, Finances, and Expectations (LIFE) Survey showed there was a sharp year-over-year increase in anxiety about making ends meet: In April 2024, 26.2% of respondents who said they could pay all their bills reported concern about being able to do so in the next six months. That\u2019s up from 20.7% in April 2023. A critical read on inflation is coming Tuesday\u2019s consumer confidence index is a reflection of a further cooling in spending growth ahead, according to Ian Shepherdson, Pantheon Macroeconomics\u2019 chief economist. \u201cIn one line\ufeff, (the index is) consistent with slowing consumption growth and a gently rising unemployment rate,\u201d he wrote. The Conference Board\u2019s confidence index and the\u00a0University of Michigan\u2019s twice-a-month consumer sentiment index\u00a0are two of the leading gauges of consumers\u2019 attitudes toward the current and future strength of the economy. Although the two indexes typically track similarly over time, the consumer confidence index is more influenced by employment and labor market conditions, while the Michigan sentiment index has a greater emphasis on household finances and the impact of inflation. The Michigan index\u2019s preliminary reading for June, released earlier this month, showed sentiment levels were at a seven-month low. The latest, and highly critical, read on inflation will come Friday when the Commerce Department releases the Personal Consumption Expenditures price index data for May. The PCE index, which measured 2.7% in April, is the Fed\u2019s preferred inflation gauge.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/25/economy/us-consumer-confidence-june/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/26/2024", "section": "us"}}

Patrick Braxton will officially become mayor of Newbern once the court approves the settlement \u2013\u00a0 the first Black person to hold the position in the town\u2019s 166-year history. Newbern is about an hour drive from Selma in the western part of Alabama and has a population of 133, according to the\u00a02020 Census. After being sworn in as mayor, Braxton was later denied full access to the office by the man who was mayor before him, Haywood Stokes III, who is White, and the majority-White city council, according to a lawsuit. Braxton along with four residents he wanted to appoint to a new city council and the\u00a0NAACP\u2019s Legal Defense Fund\u00a0filed an amended complaint to force the town to honor the election. Although \u201ca factual dispute exists regarding who has lawful authority to serve as mayor and town councilmembers,\u201d according to the settlement, signed\u00a0June 21, the parties now agree \u201cBraxton is the lawful mayor of Newbern, and he shall hold all the powers, privileges, duties \u2026 entrusted to the mayor of Newbern under Alabama state law.\u201d The settlement does not require that the defendants admit to any wrongdoing and specifically notes that they \u201cdeny having engaged in any wrongful practice, or other unlawful conduct.\u201d Leah Wong, an attorney with the Legal Defense Fund who represented the plaintiffs, called the outcome of the settlement positive because \u201cthe town will be able to move forward.\u201d \u201cMost of the Black residents still recognized (Braxton) as mayor \u2026,\u201d Wong said. \u201cIt is a shame that he had to fight for his right to actually execute his duties for the last four years.\u201d CNN has reached out to Braxton and the town of Newbern for comment. Under the settlement, Braxton has 14 days after the effective date to submit names of residents to the Alabama governor he wants the state to appoint as town council members.\u00a0If Alabama Governor Kay Ivey\u00a0does not appoint people to fill the town council positions, Braxton must hold a special election on December 31, 2024. Braxton, along with his new town council, will also be responsible for conducting the regularly scheduled elections set for 2025. The settlement states the town agrees to pay the attorney fees of the plaintiffs which will come from town funds. And the town\u2019s finances will be independently audited by an entity jointly agreed upon by Stokes and Braxton. A lifelong Newbern resident and volunteer firefighter, Braxton previously told CNN he decided to challenge the status quo\u00a0in his town\u00a0and run for mayor. He asserted in the lawsuit the mayor and town council were not responding to the needs of Newbern\u2019s majority Black community, CNN previously reported. The town had not held a mayoral election since at least 1965, when the Voting Rights Act became law, according to the lawsuit. \u00a0According to court records, the voting age population in Newbern is 64.3 percent Black and 34.8 White. According to the lawsuit, \u201cto prevent Braxton from appointing a majority black Town council, the Defendants \u2026 agreed to hold a secret meeting and adopt resolutions to conduct a special election,\u201d \u00a0CNN previously reported. At the meeting, Braxton\u2019s lawsuit claims Stokes set a special election date for the council, \u201cbecause the council members had allegedly \u2018forgotten\u2019 to qualify as candidates for the 2020 municipal elections.\u201d Braxton and the people he appointed as councilors say in the lawsuit\u00a0that\u00a0no notice of a special election was published and the only people to file to run were Stokes and former council members Gary Broussard, Jesse Donald Leverett, Voncille Brown Thomas and Willie Richard Tucker. And as they were the only candidates for the October 6 special election, they won by default. The lawsuit claimed the locks on the town hall were changed so Braxton could not get in, adding he was denied access to the post office box used for official mail, and a local bank would not let him see the town accounts. \u201cPatrick Braxton accomplished something no other Black resident of the City of Newbern had ever accomplished since the city\u2019s founding in 1854: he was duly elected Mayor of the City,\u201d the lawsuit claimed. \u201cHowever, the minority White residents of the city, long accustomed to exercising total control over city government, refused to accept this outcome.\u201d In court filings, the defendants said there was no conspiracy and no racial discrimination, CNN reported. CNN\u2019s Meridith Edwards and Rachel Clarke contributed to this report.\u00a0", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/25/us/patrick-braxton-newbern-alabama-mayor-settlement-reaj/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/26/2024", "section": "us"}}

{"id": "2024_06_25_politics_trum-mar-a-lago-search-warrant", "text": "Federal Judge Aileen Cannon said Tuesday she had \u201ca hard time seeing\u201d any problems with the warrant the FBI obtained to search former President Donald Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago estate in the summer of 2022. While she didn\u2019t rule from the bench on the third and final day of oral arguments in Fort Pierce, Florida, Cannon appeared to side with prosecutors over whether Trump\u2019s defense can suppress boxes of evidence seized by the FBI in August 2022. Trump\u2019s attorney Emil Bove had argued that the warrant was overly broad and unjustly allowed agents to search the entire Mar-a-Lago premises. Cannon, however, said the language in the warrant, which a magistrate judge signed off on, seems to have been sufficient. \u201cI have a hard time seeing what more needed to be included\u201d in the warrant\u2019s description of where agents could search in Mar-a-Lago and what physical documents they could seize, Cannon said. Trump and his co-defendants, personal aide Walt Nauta and\u00a0Mar-a-Lago property manager Carlos De Oliveira, are facing charges of mishandling sensitive or classified materials and of obstruction in the case brought by special counsel Jack Smith.\u00a0All three have pleaded\u00a0not guilty. Bove, like in other recent hearings in the classified documents case, wants the judge to hold even more hearings that could probe into the investigators\u2019 work. But Cannon has had tough questions. \u201cWe\u2019re not talking about the search of a single-family home in the suburbs,\u201d Bove said, explaining that the 50-plus-room property wasn\u2019t approached specifically enough by the investigators when they told a court in 2022 they wanted permission to search for and seize classified documents. \u201cThey purported to look for classified documents in a gym and a kitchen,\u201d he added. But Cannon challenged Bove\u2019s complaints by pointing out there may not be legal issues with agents searching much of the property and finding documents in some rooms but not others. \u201cYou would agree that paperwork, though, could be located anywhere,\u201d the judge said. Investigators say they found classified documents in various places at the resort, including a public ballroom, a bathroom and a bedroom. Another tense moment At the conclusion of the hearing, Cannon and prosecutor David Harbach sparred again \u2013 after terse exchanges between the two on Monday \u2013 illuminating continued frustration from the special counsel\u2019s office with the hearings and the approach of Trump\u2019s lawyers. Harbach jumped up after Bove concluded his arguments. Trump\u2019s attorney had tried to claim, without much evidence in court, that prosecutors should have to provide information about any divisions within the FBI\u00a0regarding\u00a0the case\u00a0or whether any agents involved in the case disliked Trump. Harbach called this an \u201cattempt to hijack the hearing.\u201d But Cannon, who was already trying to wrap up the almost two-hour hearing, was quick to cut off the prosecutor. She told him the hearing hadn\u2019t been hijacked. Harbach asked the judge whether he could speak more in open court about the defense strategy. \u201cIt concerns the defense\u2019s repeated attempts to impart allegations that have nothing to do with what\u2019s before the court,\u201d he said. Cannon then cut him off, ending the hearing.

{"id": "2024_06_25_politics_trump-gag-order", "text": "The judge in Donald Trump\u2019s hush money trial has lifted portions of the gag order restricting what the former president can say about witnesses in the trial, such as Michael Cohen and Stormy Daniels, two days before Trump will square off against President Joe Biden at the CNN Presidential Debate. Trump, however, cannot discuss any prosecutor, court staffer or their family members,\u00a0according to a court order on Tuesday from Judge Juan Merchan that rolls back parts of the gag order imposed before the trial began.\u00a0That aspect of the gag order remains in effect at least until his sentencing, which is set for July 11. The new order Tuesday also lifts the bar on public statements about jurors but notes disclosure of any personally identifying information of any juror is still prohibited. Merchan wrote in his decision lifting parts of the gag order Tuesday that the \u201ccircumstances have now changed\u201d following Trump\u2019s conviction last month on 34 counts of falsifying business records. The judge\u2019s decision comes two days before Trump\u2019s debate with Biden, where Trump\u2019s conviction is sure to be raised. The former president will now be able to discuss the witnesses who testified against him as well as the makeup of the Democratic-leaning jury pool in Manhattan. Trump spokesperson Steven Cheung said in a statement that Merchan\u2019s order \u201cleaves in place portions of the unconstitutional gag order\u201d and that Trump plans to appeal the ruling. \u201cThis is another unlawful decision by a highly conflicted judge, which is blatantly un-American as it gags President Trump, the leading candidate in the 2024 presidential election during the upcoming presidential debate on Thursday,\u201d Cheung said. \u201cPresident Trump and his legal team will immediately challenge today\u2019s unconstitutional order.\u201d Last week, New York\u2019s highest court declined to hear Trump\u2019s appeal on the gag order \u201cupon the ground that no substantial constitutional question is directly involved.\u201d Trump was held in contempt 10 times during the trial for violating Merchan\u2019s gag order after he made statements about Cohen and Daniels and complained about the jury pool. The judge fined Trump $10,000 \u2013 $1,000 for each violation \u2013 and threatened him with imprisonment if additional violations occurred. Trump repeatedly complained about the gag order throughout the seven-week trial, arguing that witnesses, including Cohen, were taking advantage of the gag order to attack him when he couldn\u2019t respond. During the trial, Merchan said he could not legally restrict Cohen\u2019s public statements but he expressed consternation over what the former Trump fixer and lawyer was saying about the case. At one point, Merchan told prosecutors to urge Cohen not to make public statements about the trial. In a statement to CNN, Cohen said Tuesday: \u201cFor the past six years, Donald and acolytes have been making constant negative statements about me. Donald\u2019s failed strategy of discrediting me so that he can avoid accountability didn\u2019t work then and won\u2019t work now.\u201d The Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office declined to comment. In his order, Merchan wrote that his gag order provisions \u201cwere narrowly tailored to address the significant concerns regarding the Defendant\u2019s extrajudicial speech,\u201d while noting that appeals courts have upheld the restrictions he placed on Trump during the trial. The judge acknowledged that he was reluctant to lift the gag order pertaining to the jurors, writing, \u201cthere is ample evidence to justify continued concern for the jurors.\u201d Merchan wrote it was his \u201cstrong preference to extend those protections\u201d to jurors, but he said he could not legally do so. As for the remaining protections for prosecutors, court staffers and their families, Merchan says they must feel safe to do their jobs ahead of sentencing. \u201cUntil sentence is imposed,\u201d Merchan wrote, those covered by that part of his gag order \u201cmust continue to perform their lawful duties free from threats, intimidation, harassment, and harm.\u201d Last week, Manhattan prosecutors urged Merchan to keep in place the gag order preventing Trump from making statements about jurors, prosecutors and their family members, arguing threats against prosecutors have increased since the start of the trial. In the filing, the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office said it did not oppose lifting the portion of the gag order that blocked Trump from making statements about witnesses.

On Tuesday, Nvidia closed nearly 7% higher, reversing course after three straight days of declines, which caused some investors to worry that the excitement over the crucial role the company is expected to play in the artificial intelligence revolution may be cooling. \u201cWhile we do believe in AI, there have been signs of over-exuberance in the US market over the last month,\u201d Jim Reid, a research strategist at Deutsche Bank, wrote in a note Monday. On June 18, the chipmaking giant\u2019s market capitalization hit $3.34 trillion, surpassing Microsoft\u2019s to become the world\u2019s most valuable company. Over the next three trading days, though, the company shed $430 billion. Despite the rally in Nvidia\u2019s shares on Tuesday, Nvidia\u2019s market cap now stands at $3.10 trillion, falling to third place, behind Microsoft (MSFT) and Apple (AAPL), which have market caps of $3.35 trillion and $3.21 trillion, respectively. \u201cWhat we see with Nvidia is typical volatility, which is expected when a stock rises as quickly as Nvidia\u2019s did,\u201d Jochen Stanzl, chief market analyst at trading platform CMC Markets, told CNN. Nvidia\u2019s stock has been on a tear, soaring more than 161% since January. The company\u2019s chips power AI systems, including generative AI, the technology behind OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT that can create text, images and other media. Market contagion? Frenzy around the potential for AI to radically change the way we live and work \u2014\u00a0and make big returns for investors \u2014 has driven much of the stock market\u2019s returns over the past year and a half. Nvidia is a member of the so-called Magnificent Seven, the mega-cap tech companies whose shares greatly outperformed the broader US stock market rally last year. The S&P 500 index climbed 24.2% over 2023, compared with the more than 100% average rise in the stocks of the Magnificent Seven. In a note published Monday, Deutsche Bank noted that, as a result of the seven stocks\u2019 dominance, \u201cthe US stock market is close to being the most concentrated in history.\u201d On Tuesday, the bank wrote that the decline in Nvidia\u2019s stock the previous day had \u201cheld down US equity returns more broadly.\u201d On Tuesday, Nvidia\u2019s rally helped lift the tech-heavy Nasdaq, which rose 1.3%. The S&P 500 closed 0.4% higher on Tuesday, as well. The Dow ended 0.8% lower.

{"id": "2024_06_25_cars_tesla-recalling-cybertruck", "text": "Tesla has issued two recalls on the Cybertruck, its third and fourth, since the model was introduced late last year. The latest recall, which includes almost all of the nearly 12,000 trucks on the road so far, involves the truck\u2019s huge single windshield wiper and a piece of plastic trim along the edge of the truck bed. A piece of black plastic trim that runs along the edge of the truck\u2019s angled bed wall can come loose and may detach from the vehicle while it\u2019s being driven. \u201cIf the applique separates from the vehicle while in drive, it could create a road hazard for following motorists and increase their risk of injury or a collision,\u201d according to documents posted on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration web site. The problem emerged when the piece was missing on a Cybertruck that had been transported to a delivery center on a car hauler truck, according to NHTSA documents. An investigation by Tesla revealed that the piece had not been properly installed. Further investigation revealed more cases of the trim pieces coming loose because of improper installation. Some of these cases were on Cybertrucks that had been delivered to customers. Cybertruck owners will be asked to bring their trucks to a Tesla service center where the trim piece will either be replaced or installed properly with \u201cadhesion promotor\u201d and pressure sensitive tape. Tesla will begin notifying owners of the recall in mid-August. The trucks are also being recalled for a separate issue in the electric motor that powers the truck\u2019s single huge windshield wiper. Some of the motors were damaged during testing in a way that can allow excessive electrical current to run through the motor, causing it to fail. Tesla has previously recalled the Cybertruck for other issues. In April the trucks were recalled because the accelerator pedal could become stuck down. In January, Tesla issued a software recall for 2.2 million vehicles, including Cybertrucks, because letters on warning lights were too small to easily read. That problem was fixed through an over-the-air software update.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/25/cars/tesla-recalling-cybertruck/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/26/2024", "section": "us"}}

The recall involves the \u201cMake it Mini\u201d sets which contain resins that, when liquid, can cause those injuries and irritations to young children and adults alike. The CPSC also found that the resins contain chemical compounds called \u201cacrylates\u201d\u00a0in amounts that are prohibited in children\u2019s products. After the resins cure (or turn into a solid form), however, they no longer present this hazard, the agency said. Isaac Larian, CEO of MGA, wrote in an email to CNN that the toy had been on the market for 18 months, and estimated that only 10% to 15% of the recalled toys still have liquid resin inside. The CPSC said MGA Entertainment has received 26 reports of incidents with the toy sets from children and adults, including reports of skin burns and irritation, and respiratory irritation, with one report that it triggered a case of asthma in the user. The recalled sets, which include an additional 1 million that were sold in Canada, include \u201cMake It Mini Appliances,\u201d all models and series of \u201cMake It Mini Food,\u201d and \u201cMake It Mini Lifestyle.\u201d Most sets consist of a sphere which contains the materials required to assemble the  miniature appliance, food or lifestyle items. The resin packaging in each set may imitate food items such as a peanut butter jar, maple syrup, milk container, etc. and the resins when hardened imitate food. The sphere packaging consists of a disposable wrapper bearing \u201cMGA\u2019s Miniverse\u201d on a yellow background and \u201cMake It Appliances,\u201d or \u201cMake It Mini Food,\u201d in bright pink or \u201cMake It Mini Lifestyle\u201d in salmon pink.

{"id": "2024_06_23_us_arkansas-grocery-store-shooting-investigation", "text": "The suspect in a mass shooting at a grocery store in Arkansas was armed with a pistol, a 12-gauge shotgun and had a bandolier with dozens of extra shotgun rounds, authorities said. It was one of at least 14 mass shootings in the US since Friday, including one in Ohio, in which 10 people \u2013 including two minors \u2013 were shot. The US has suffered at least 247 mass shootings in just the past six months, according to the Gun Violence Archive, which defines mass shootings as those in which four or more victims are shot. In recent weeks, gunfire erupted at a\u00a0Michigan splash pad, a\u00a0Texas Juneteenth celebration\u00a0and a\u00a0Massachusetts car meetup, among other seemingly innocuous locations. The suspect in the Arkansas grocery store shooting, Travis Eugene Posey, 44, allegedly opened fire at the Mad Butcher in Fordyce on Friday, killing four people ages 23 to 81 and wounding\u00a0nine\u00a0others. \u201cThe suspect arrived at the Mad Butcher armed,\u201d Secretary of Public Safety and Director of Arkansas State Police Mike Hagar said. \u201cWe believe that most, if not all the rounds, fired by the suspect were from the shotgun.\u201d Authorities believe the suspect \u201cimmediately began engaging victims in the parking lot after exiting his truck and then proceeded into the store,\u201d Hagar said. Once inside the grocery store, the suspect \u201cwas firing indiscriminately at both customers and employees,\u201d Hagar said. Law enforcement responded to the shooting around 11:30 a.m. and exchanged gunfire with the suspect, Arkansas State Police said. Officers arrived less than three minutes from the time the first shot was fired, Hagar said. \u201cWhen law enforcement arrived on scene, the suspect exited the store, and the officers redirected his attention towards them,\u201d he said. \u201cHe immediately engaged in a firefight with law enforcement, where they were able to stop the threat,\u201d Hagar said. Posey was \u201ctreated for non-life-threatening\u00a0injuries after exchanging gunfire with law enforcement\u201d and taken to the Ouachita County Detention Center, state police said in a release. Posey is expected to be charged with four counts of capital murder, with additional charges pending, Arkansas State Police said in a\u00a0news release. He is set to appear in court Monday, Dallas County prosecutor Eric Marks said. The suspect\u2019s motive is not yet clear, Hagar said, noting that his criminal history is \u201cvery limited \u2013 if there is any at all.\u201d It was not clear whether Posey had retained legal counsel. Victims include an infant\u2019s mother and a selfless great-grandparent The four people killed in the shooting were identified as Callie Weems, 23; Roy Sturgis, 50; Shirley Taylor, 62; and Ellen Shrum, 81. Weems, the youngest victim, leaves behind her 10-month-old daughter Ivy, according to a GoFundMe page set up by family friends to help with her funeral expenses. \u201cCallie\u2019s life was tragically took yesterday way (too) soon,\u201d reads the campaign, verified by GoFundMe. \u201cWith Ivy being left behind this is a great way for Helen (Callie\u2019s mother) to also do something for her future. She loved her child and everyone witnessed her being a phenomenal mom. Pray for Helen, Ivy and family the days to come will be the hardest.\u201d The young victim\u2019s mother, Helen Browning, is also mourning the death of another victim. She said Sturgis, a logger and a loving father, was part of her extended family, the Associated Press reported. \u201cRoy was as country as cornbread,\u201d Browning told The Associated Press. \u201cHe lived a simple life. He was a simple man.\u201d The oldest victim, Ellen \u201cJanie\u201d Shrum, leaves behind her husband of 63 years, their three children and numerous grandchildren and great-grandchildren, who knew her lovingly as \u201cGrammie.\u201d \u201cShe was completely selfless,\u201d her son, Tait Shrum, told CNN. \u201cShe didn\u2019t have a selfish bone in her body.\u201d Janie Shrum was a devoted Christian and served as a foster parent for several children. An avid gardener, she always shared what she canned, baked and cooked with others. \u201cLove was the key to life for her,\u201d her daughter, Teresa Shrum Crutchfield said. \u201cShe wanted to share that love with others.\u201d Early on in her retirement, Janie Shrum worked as a cashier for a few months at the Mad Butcher \u2013 the store where the mass shooting happened. \u201cWhen she retired she couldn\u2019t stay retired,\u201d Tait said. \u201cShe needed that connection with people, that\u2019s where she got her happiness.\u201d Taylor\u2019s daughter, Angela Atchley, told CNN her mother loved her family and kids and was \u201cthe hardest working woman I know.\u201d \u201cWe are completely lost,\u201d Atchley said. In addition to the victims killed, seven civilians ages 20 to 65 years were injured by gunfire. Four of them were still hospitalized as of Sunday, including a woman who is in critical condition, Arkansas State Police said. Two police officers were also shot and wounded, authorities said, including a Fordyce police officer who was released from a hospital Saturday evening. \u201cI can tell you from what we\u2019ve seen that there appears to be no personal connection to the shooter of any of the victims,\u201d Hagar said. \u201cHe simply started engaging victims indiscriminately \u2014 just as targets of opportunity.\u201d \u2018Mama, pinch me. This can\u2019t be real\u2019 Katrina Doherty was shopping for dinner with her 18-year-old daughter and 4-year-old son when she thought she heard the sound of something falling. Then she saw glass shatter and someone drop to the ground. That\u2019s when she knew gunfire had erupted. Not finding an escape route, Doherty and others followed two store employees and darted into a freezer. The 39-year-old mother said she heard about nine or 10 rounds before making it into the icy shelter. \u201cWe ran in there really fast. We still heard gunshots keep going off,\u201d Doherty told CNN. \u201cIt was like slow motion. My daughter was like \u2018Mama, pinch me. This can\u2019t be real.\u2019 And I was like, \u2019Baby, it\u2019s real.\u2019\u201d Outside, David Rodriguez was pulling into a gas station when he heard \u201cpops.\u201d At first, he thought they were fireworks. Then he noticed the grocery store\u2019s front windows were broken \u2013 as if they had been \u201cshot open\u201d by gunfire, Rodriguez said. Panicked shoppers then sprinted out of the store as gunfire rang out in rapid succession, Rodriguez said. Inside the store\u2019s freezer, frigid customers and employees couldn\u2019t call 911 because there was no service, Doherty said. Her son started to cry, \u201cbut we finally got him calmed down because I didn\u2019t want the shooter to hear,\u201d she told CNN. At one point, one of the employees inside the freezer opened the door, but promptly closed it after seeing a dead body immediately outside, Doherty said. The door remained shut until one of the workers heard police outside, and those in the freezer were escorted out. More\u00a0mass shootings\u00a0tend to\u00a0unfold in summer months, with July 4 and 5\u00a0marking a peak\u00a0over roughly the last decade.

{"id": "2024_06_25_us_new-york-tech-ceo-murder-conviction", "text": "The former executive assistant of a tech CEO was found guilty Monday of murdering his boss \u2013 whom he then decapitated and dismembered \u2013 in 2020, according to a\u00a0news release from the Manhattan District Attorney\u2019s Office. Prosecutors said Tyrese Haspil, 25, killed Fahim Saleh, 33, to prevent him from learning Haspil had embezzled about $400,000 from the venture capitalist and\u00a0CEO of Gokada, a Nigerian motorcycle ride-hail company. A jury on Monday found Haspil guilty of one count of first-degree murder, two counts of second-degree grand larceny, one count of second-degree burglary and other charges, according to the DA\u2019s office statement. \u201cTyrese Haspil tragically cut Mr. Saleh\u2019s life short \u2013 a man who came from a close-knit immigrant family and followed his passions to become a successful entrepreneur,\u201d Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg said. \u201cI hope the accountability delivered by today\u2019s verdict can provide a measure of comfort to Mr. Saleh\u2019s loved ones as they continue to mourn his loss.\u201d CNN has reached out to Haspil\u2019s attorney Sam Roberts at The Legal Aid Society, which represents New Yorkers who cannot pay for legal services, for comment. Haspil is expected to be sentenced in September, according to the release. Haspil became Saleh\u2019s assistant in May 2018, where he was tasked with a variety of responsibilities\u00a0including handling Saleh\u2019s\u00a0finances \u2013 which is how he\u00a0gained access to Saleh\u2019s financial records, according to the DA\u2019s office release. That fall, Haspil\u00a0began stealing from Saleh\u2019s companies using two separate schemes, the DA\u2019s office stated.\u00a0Haspil created\u00a0several financial accounts, including a PayPal account, to funnel funds into the accounts while\u00a0also\u00a0creating fake statements and mimicking\u00a0transactions\u00a0that would go undetected by his boss, according to the release. Haspil resigned in May 2019, but continued to steal money, the release said. In January 2020, after one of the frauds was found and traced to Haspil, Saleh confronted his former mentee for stealing $35,000 from his company\u00a0and proposed a settlement to pay back the debt and avoid criminal prosecution,\u00a0according to the release. Haspil agreed to pay back\u00a0Saleh\u00a0over an agreed upon two-year period but did so using the\u00a0stolen money from the PayPal financial scheme, causing him to embezzle nearly $400,000,\u00a0according to the DA\u2019s office. Fearing Saleh would learn of his continued embezzlement, Haspil then decided to plot Saleh\u2019s murder \u2013 believing that killing his former boss would prevent Saleh from testifying against him, according to the release. On July 13, 2020, Haspil followed Saleh into his Lower East Side condo, tased him in the back and stabbed him multiple times, the release stated. The next day, Haspil returned to the apartment \u201cto dismember the body and clean up the crime scene,\u201d according to the release. Haspil left briefly while attempting to clean the crime scene, and Saleh\u2019s cousin, who went to the apartment to check on him, found Saleh\u2019s body with his head and limbs severed, the release said. Haspil did not re-enter the apartment after seeing police outside. On July 17, police arrested Haspil\u00a0in Manhattan. Saleh was well known for\u00a0his support of fledgling techies. He was born in Saudi Arabia to Bangladeshi parents.\u00a0He grew up in upstate New York\u00a0and had a computer science degree from Bentley University in Massachusetts.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/25/us/new-york-tech-ceo-murder-conviction/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/26/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_25_politics_biden-administration-american-military-contractors-ukraine", "text": "The Biden administration is moving toward lifting a de facto ban on American military contractors deploying to Ukraine, four\u00a0US officials familiar with the matter told CNN, to\u00a0help the\u00a0country\u2019s\u00a0military maintain and repair US-provided weapons systems. The change\u00a0would\u00a0mark\u00a0another significant shift in the Biden administration\u2019s Ukraine policy, as the US looks for ways to give Ukraine\u2019s military an upper hand against Russia. The policy is still being worked on by administration officials and has not received final sign-off yet from President\u00a0Joe\u00a0Biden, officials said. \u201cWe have not made any decisions and any discussion of this is premature,\u201d said one administration official. \u201cThe president is absolutely firm that he will not be sending\u00a0US\u00a0troops to Ukraine.\u201d Once approved,\u00a0the change\u00a0would likely be\u00a0enacted this year, officials said, and\u00a0would\u00a0allow the Pentagon to provide contracts to American companies for work inside Ukraine for the first time since Russia invaded\u00a0in 2022. Officials said they hope it will speed up the maintenance and repairs of weapons systems being used by the Ukrainian military. Over the last two years, Biden has insisted that all Americans, and particularly US troops, stay far away from the Ukrainian frontlines. The White House has been determined to limit both the danger to Americans and the perception, particularly by Russia, that the US military is engaged in combat there. The State Department has explicitly warned Americans against traveling to Ukraine since 2022. As a result, US-provided military equipment that has sustained significant damage in combat has had to be transported out of the country to Poland, Romania, or other NATO countries for repairs, a process which takes time. \u00a0US troops are also available to help the Ukrainians with more routine maintenance and logistics, but only from afar via video chat or secure phone\u2014an arrangement that has come with inherent limitations, since US troops and contractors are not able to work directly on the systems. Administration officials began to seriously reconsider those restrictions over the last several months, officials said, as Russia continued to make gains on the battlefield and US funding for Ukraine stalled in Congress. Allowing experienced, US government-funded American contractors to maintain a presence in Ukraine means they will be able to help fix damaged, high-value equipment much faster, officials said. One advanced system that officials say will likely require regular maintenance is the F-16 fighter jet, which Ukraine is set to receive later this year. Companies bidding for the contracts would be required to develop\u00a0robust risk mitigation plans to mitigate threats to their employees, an official said. The discussions follow a series\u00a0of decisions the US has made in recent months to try to help Ukraine beat back the Russians. In late-May, Biden gave Ukraine permission to strike targets inside Russia, near the border with the Ukrainian city of\u00a0Kharkiv, with US weapons\u2014a request the US had repeatedly denied in the past. Last week, that policy appeared to expand once again, when National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said Ukraine could counterstrike anywhere along the Ukraine-Russia border using US weapons. Current and former officials familiar\u00a0with the discussions\u00a0about deploying\u00a0contractors to Ukraine emphasized that the policy change will not result in the kind of overwhelming American contractor presence there that existed in Iraq and Afghanistan. Instead, it would likely result in anywhere from a few dozen to a couple hundred contractors working in Ukraine at a time. \u201cThis would be a much more focused and thoughtful effort to support Ukraine in country,\u201d said retired Army officer Alex\u00a0Vindman, who served as the director for European Affairs on former President Donald Trump\u2019s National Security Council. Vindman\u00a0has been pushing the administration to lift the restrictions for nearly two years and said the administration has been working on a plan to ease the restrictions since earlier this year. \u201cUkraine is an ally,\u201d\u00a0Vindman\u00a0told CNN. \u201cThe US has keen, critical national security interests in supporting Ukraine, and there are plenty of risk mitigation measures.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/25/politics/biden-administration-american-military-contractors-ukraine/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/26/2024", "section": "us"}}
