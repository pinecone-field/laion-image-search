Two undocumented men from Venezuela are accused of killing the girl and both are facing charges of capital murder in her death, according to the Houston Police Department. Both are being held on a $10 million bond this week, court records show. As Jocelyn\u2019s family laid her to rest Thursday, remembering her as a kind, good-hearted child who was her mother\u2019s best friend, Mayor John Whitmire called for justice, reminding attendees that children \u201care not supposed to be taken off the streets of Houston.\u201d This is also the latest case to bring immigration to the forefront as a critical issue this election year, as the two men were in the country illegally, according to the US Department of Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Here\u2019s what we know so far about the cases around Jocelyn\u2019s death: Who was Jocelyn? Born on December 27, 2011, Jocelyn\u2019s family called her a \u201cloyal, compassionate and caring friend\u201d who supported those around her, her obituary says. Her kindness and \u201czest for life\u201d are among the things her family wants people to remember her for. At her celebration of life service, Jocelyn\u2019s sister Gabby remembered how the two of them would laugh, play, cry and \u201cget on each other\u2019s nerves.\u201d She described her older sister as smart and having a good heart. \u201cJossy also gave me courage to be myself and speak up for myself and for that I will always be grateful to you. I love you, Jossy,\u201d Gabby said. Jocelyn loved animals and wanted them all to have homes, not understanding why some were strays. Green was her favorite color. Jocelyn enjoyed fantasy, whether it was the magic of Harry Potter, vampire-film classic \u201cTwilight\u201d or the upside down of TV\u2019s \u201cStranger Things,\u201d her obituary reads. She even had a crush on \u201cStranger Things\u201d star Finn Wolfhard. She is survived by her mother, Alexis, brother, and \u201csister\u201d Gabby, as well as her grandparents and numerous family members. What happened to Jocelyn? Surveillance footage of the area obtained by detectives showed the suspects at a restaurant together the evening of June 16, Lt. Stephen Hope of the Houston Police Department said at a news conference after their arrests. The men left on foot and were later seen meeting and talking with Jocelyn, Hope said, before all three walked to a convenience store. A few minutes later, Hope said, they went to a bridge. Prosecutors allege the men killed Jocelyn and threw her body in the bayou. Jocelyn\u2019s body was found along West Rankin Road in a shallow creek in north Houston early in the morning of June 17, authorities have said. The 12-year-old was strangled to death, according to the medical examiner, the Associated Press reported. What we know about the accused men Johan Jose Martinez-Rangel, 22, and\u00a0Franklin Jose Pe\u00f1a Ramos, 26, were arrested June 20, three days after Jocelyn\u2019s strangled body was found in the creek, according to the Houston Police Department. Both men are from Venezuela and entered the US illegally, a spokesperson for US Immigration and Customs Enforcement told CNN. Where and when they entered the country is unclear, the spokesperson said, but each had been apprehended near El Paso by US Border Patrol \u2013\u00a0Martinez-Rangel on\u00a0March\u00a014\u00a0and Pe\u00f1a Ramos on May\u00a028\u00a0\u2013 and released with a notice to appear in court in the future. An attorney for Pe\u00f1a Ramos declined to comment. An attorney for Martinez-Rangel did not immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday. Where are the suspects now? Both men are under immigration holds by federal authorities, according to the AP, which means they could not leave custody even if they could post bond. Family and community reaction After her daughter\u2019s body was found, Alexis Nungaray cried as she realized the heartbreaking news she would have to share with her family. \u201cI\u2019m, like, angry that they took advantage of her. She was so young. She was 12. You took my baby away, you took her away,\u201d the mother told CNN affiliate KHOU on June 19. \u201cNow, I get to let her little brother know his older sister is never coming home.\u201d At a news conference on June 24, Nungaray shared her frustration that her daughter\u2019s life was taken from her. \u201cShe had such a bright future ahead of her and I knew she was going to go very far. And, you know, these monsters took that opportunity from her,\u201d she said. Laying her to rest During Thursday\u2019s celebration of life service, one of Jocelyn\u2019s favorite songs, \u201cConey Island Baby,\u201d flowed through the crowded room as a slideshow of her life played. The song is from the 1960s and way before her time, but it fit Jocelyn\u2019s eclectic music tastes. Stories emerged about Jocelyn and her sister making slime together and watching sunsets, reminding the room of a life lost too soon. Her great-aunt broke down in tears, but she stirred some laughs when she talked about Jossy\u2019s love for books. \u201cJossy loved to read. Anytime we were at Walmart or any store, that girl would try to beeline for the book section all day, every day,\u201d she said. A reception is being hosted at Gallery Furniture on North Freeway in Houston after the celebration of life to support the family, according to a Facebook post from the store owner. Jim McIngvale, known as \u201cMattress Mack,\u201d\u00a0is well known for his charitable work, like turning his stores into shelters to help people affected by Hurricane Harvey and other severe weather events.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/27/us/what-we-know-houston-jocelyn-nungaray-killing/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/30/2024", "section": "us"}}

Roosevelt\u2019s sister, Corinne Roosevelt Robinson, and his brother-in-law, Douglas Robinson Jr., gifted him the watch just before he left for the Spanish-American War in Cuba in 1898, according to the park service. On the inside of the watch reads the inscription: \u201cTHEODORE ROOSEVELT FROM D.R. AND C.R.R.\u201d the park service said. The silver watch traveled with him during the war, while hunting in Africa and exploring the Amazon in South America, according to the park service. After the 26th president\u2019s death in 1919, his watch was kept as a memento and eventually given to the park service to be put on display at the Sagamore Hill National Historic Site on Long Island. In 1971, the watch was loaned out, initially on a six-year term which was later extended, to the Theodore Roosevelt Inaugural National Historic Site in Buffalo, New York. But on July 21, 1987, the watch was stolen from the site, where it was last seen on display at the site\u2019s Ansley Wilcox House in Buffalo. It wasn\u2019t until last year when the watch reappeared 36 years later at an auction in Florida, the park service said. The auctioneer realized whose pocket watch it was and contacted the historical sites and the park service. The park service and FBI then got involved and worked together to verify the watch was the former president\u2019s stolen watch from 1987. \u201cThe repatriation of the watch would not have been possible without the close collaboration between the FBI and NPS,\u201d FBI Special Agent Robert Giczy said in a news release Thursday. \u201cThis partnership ensured that this historic treasure could be returned safely for future generations to enjoy.\u201d The watch, described by the FBI as a Waltham 17 jewel watch, was returned Thursday to New York to be placed at Roosevelt\u2019s home at the Sagamore Hill National Historic Site and can be viewed by the public for the next three months. It was never determined who stole the watch from the display and how it eventually ended up in Florida, according to the park service. CNN\u2019s Ashley R.

{"id": "2024_06_29_politics_trump-campaign-gop-platform", "text": "Top advisers to Donald Trump are plotting an overhaul of the Republican Party platform that will dramatically slash its size and refocus the GOP around the former president\u2019s agenda for a second term. A memo from Trump campaign managers Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles dated Thursday criticized past platforms as too long and too heavily influenced by special interests and outside groups. A \u201cclear, concise and easily digestible\u201d platform will be easier for voters to understand and harder for political opponents to attack, they wrote. \u201cPublishing an unnecessarily verbose treatise will provide more fuel for our opponent\u2019s fire of misinformation and misrepresentation to voters,\u201d the memo said. \u201cIt is with that recognition that we will present a streamlined platform in line with President Trump\u2019s principled and popular vision for America\u2019s future.\u201d The memo, obtained Saturday by CNN, was first reported by The New York Times. The party\u2019s most recent platform, crafted in 2016 and reapproved in 2020, spans 66 pages. A person familiar with the planning said the goal for the upcoming platform is a concise document that is \u201ca couple dozen pages,\u201d written in clearer language and likely reflecting Trump\u2019s top priorities. That person went on to say that when platform committees convened ahead of previous conventions, their meetings were attended by lobbyists and special interest groups trying to insert specific line items for their clients into the party platform. LaCivita and Wiles wrote they want a platform that will \u201cfree our Party from the constraints of Washington jargon and the shackles of lobbyist influence.\u201d The memo comes amid intensifying anxiety from conservative groups over the direction of the platform ahead of next month\u2019s Republican National Convention in Milwaukee. There is especially concern among anti-abortion groups that Thursday\u2019s memo is signaling Trump intends to remove the platform\u2019s long-standing commitment to a federal abortion ban and an amendment to the US Constitution giving the unborn the same rights as people. \u201cThe party is fully united, and taking out the pro-life language risks dividing the party,\u201d said one Trump ally who is deeply involved in the anti-abortion movement and is aware of the memo from LaCivita and Wiles. The existing platform also lays out the party\u2019s opposition to same-sex marriage and new gun restrictions. It embraces changes to Medicare and Social Security for people under 55 \u2014 some of which has become fodder for Democratic messaging in recent election cycles. Trump\u2019s campaign is especially aware of how Democrats have weaponized the GOP platform in the past and is seeking to avoid a lengthy document full of potential landmines for the former president to navigate. \u201cThe platform is an opportunity to make our vision clear, and to lay out a framework for policy making, while rejecting any special interest influence that seeks to make public policy stray from our clear and straightforward objectives,\u201d LaCivita and Wiles wrote. But by laying down markers in advance of next month\u2019s convention, Trump\u2019s campaign is further asserting his dominance over a party more fully in his control. Already, Trump this year has ousted the party\u2019s previous chair, Ronna McDaniel, and installed close allies atop the GOP \u2014 his daughter-in-law Lara Trump and North Carolina GOP leader Michael Whatley. The platform committee, meanwhile, will be led by three close allies: Randy Evans, Trump\u2019s former ambassador to Luxembourg; Russell Vought, a top official in the Trump administration; and Ed Martin, president of the right-wing interest group the Phyllis Schlafly Eagles and author of the 2016 book \u201cThe Conservative Case for Trump.\u201d That committee will meet behind closed doors ahead of the convention, which begins July 15. Unlike in previous years, its deliberations will not be broadcast by C-SPAN, a source confirmed.

An evacuation order went into effect Thursday night for residents along the southeast side of the fire, the Arizona Department of Forestry and Fire Management said in\u00a0a social media post. The department said at least 60 homes were evacuated Thursday. About 4.5 million people live in the county. \u201cIt definitely puts a little bit of a panic into your mind right away,\u201d a Scottsdale woman told CNN affiliate KPNX. \u201cWe made a plan. We have had a plan. We have lots of friends in the area that have trucks and trailers ready to go when we are.\u201d The woman, along with another resident, safely evacuated to another property in north Scottsdale where they have mares, pigs, goats and cats. They said watching the \u201corange flames over the north side of the houses\u201d put them \u201con edge\u201d as they watched from safety. The fire, which began Thursday, has burned 3,200 acres and is at 0% containment, fueled by winds and hot, dry conditions, said via the US Forest Service\u2019s InciWeb alert system on Friday. Overnight, there were flame lengths as high as 20 to 40 feet in some areas, the alert said. The fire is burning as the nation grapples with a summer of more\u00a0extreme heat\u00a0\u2013 the deadliest form of weather globally and one making wildfires more likely and destructive. And with the planet warming due to fossil fuel pollution, the heat will only get\u00a0more frequent\u00a0and intense. The areas preparing for evacuation expanded Friday morning, as the fire moved farther east, according to the Maricopa County Department of Emergency Management and the InciWeb alert system. Areas southeast of the fire from Dove Valley Road to the Tonto National Forest boundary remain under an evacuation order. \u201cWe\u2019ve evacuated our horses, and we\u2019ll get some more. I\u2019ll do it all night long if I have to,\u201d resident Chris Hull told CNN affiliate KNXV as he was fueling up his truck to haul more livestock. \u201cWhatever it takes.\u201d Fire activity in Maricopa County picked up late Thursday, forcing officials to shift crews to the southeast side of the fire to protect structures. The wildfire is also threatening \u201chigh voltage power lines and the Sonoran Desert,\u201d authorities said via InciWeb. \u201cIt\u2019s burning through grass and brush and has moved off of private land onto the Tonto National Forest,\u201d they said, adding nearly 180 personnel have been assigned to the fire.

{"id": "2024_06_26_us_texas-death-row-ramiro-gonzales", "text": "Texas executed\u00a0Ramiro Gonzales\u00a0by lethal injection on Wednesday for a 2001 murder, the state Department of Criminal Justice said, following unsuccessful appeals to the US Supreme Court that argued, in part, he should have been ineligible for the death penalty under state law because he was no longer dangerous. Gonzales, 41, was convicted and sentenced to death in 2006 for the sexual assault and killing of 18-year-old Bridget Townsend, court records show. His execution was the first of two \u2013 the other in Oklahoma \u2013 carried out this week in the United States. Gonzales was pronounced dead at 6:50 p.m., the state criminal justice department said. The department provided Gonzales\u2019 last statement before he was executed, in which he repeatedly apologized to the Townsend family and said he \u201cnever stopped praying\u201d for their forgiveness: \u201cI can\u2019t put into words the pain I have caused y\u2019all, the hurt what I took away that I cannot give back.\u201d \u201cI hope this apology is enough. I lived the rest of this life for you guys to the best of my ability for restitution, restoration, taking responsibility,\u201d Gonzales said. \u201cI never stopped praying that you would forgive me and that one day I would have this opportunity to apologize.\u201d During the penalty phase of Gonzales\u2019 trial, jurors were required to find, as they are in all capital cases in Texas, a \u201cprobability\u201d Gonzales would continue to \u201ccommit criminal acts of violence.\u201d Without this determination, capital defendants in the Lone Star State are not eligible for the death penalty, per state law. In their appeals to the Supreme Court, Gonzales\u2019 attorneys said his track record these last 18 years shows he was not dangerous, pointing to his commitment to his Christian faith, ministry to others behind bars and his unsuccessful attempts to donate a kidney to a stranger in need. Additionally, they said the evidence relied upon to make the finding of future dangerousness was false: An expert witness who diagnosed the inmate with antisocial personality disorder relied on recidivism data later found to be incorrect, and he later evaluated Gonzales and walked back his testimony. In a pair of brief orders Wednesday, the US Supreme Court gave no comment in its denial of Gonzales\u2019 requests. There were no noted dissents. \u201cWe have finally witnessed justice being served,\u201d Townsend\u2019s brother, David, said Wednesday after witnessing Gonzales\u2019 execution, according to the Associated Press. \u201cThis day marks the end of a long and painful journey for our family. For over two decades we have endured unimaginable pain and heartache.\u201d Gonzales\u2019 death \u201cprovides us a little bit of peace,\u201d he said. \u201cI do want to say we are not joyous. We are not happy. This is a very, very sad day for everyone all the way around.\u201d Gonzales had grieved for Townsend and her family, as well as another woman he kidnapped and raped before confessing to Townsend\u2019s killing, his attorneys said Wednesday night in a statement. \u201cRamiro knew he took something from this world he could never give back. He lived with that shame every day, and it shaped the person he worked so hard to become,\u201d said the attorneys, Thea Posel and Raoul Schonemann. \u201cIf this country\u2019s legal system was intended to encourage rehabilitation, he would be an exemplar.\u201d In his final statement before execution, Gonzales also thanked his family and friends, along with two officials with the Texas Department of Criminal Justice for \u201cthe opportunity to become responsible, to learn accountability and to make good.\u201d The state of Texas had also opposed Gonzales\u2019 appeals, arguing in part his team had misconstrued the eligibility requirement and contending the question of whether Gonzales would continue to be a threat was not limited to the inmate\u2019s behavior on death row. Even taking into account his behavior post-conviction, \u201cthere\u2019s undoubtedly sufficient evidence to uphold the finding of future dangerousness,\u201d attorneys for the state wrote, pointing to the subsequent kidnapping and rape of another woman and a litany of transgressions he committed while in jail. \u201cEven if a jury could somehow consider events that had not happened yet, i.e., Gonzales\u2019s behavior on death row, the jury could still have rationally believed Gonzales would be a danger in the future,\u201d they said. On Monday, the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles declined to recommend clemency in a 7-0 vote. Without that recommendation, Republican Gov. Greg Abbott only could have given Gonzales a one-time 30-day reprieve. In a statement, the Medina County Criminal District Attorney\u2019s Office, which prosecuted the case, said the death penalty is never \u201ctaken lightly\u201d in Texas. \u201cNothing about an execution is easy. Nothing about losing a loved one to murder is easy,\u201d District Attorney Mark Haby said. \u201cHowever, it seems to be a fitting end that the defendant was executed on the birthday of the person he killed, Bridget Townsend. May both their souls find peace.\u201d CNN has reached out to members of Townsend\u2019s family for comment. 18 months passed before key confession Gonzales murdered Townsend in January 2001, after he called the home of his drug supplier, her boyfriend, in search of drugs, according to a 2009 Texas appeals court opinion affirming the inmate\u2019s conviction and death sentence. When Townsend told Gonzales her boyfriend wasn\u2019t home, he went to the house in search of drugs. He stole money, then kidnapped Townsend, tying her hands and feet before driving her to a location near his family\u2019s ranch, the opinion states. There, he raped and fatally shot her, it says. The case went unsolved for 18 months. Then, while sitting in jail after pleading guilty to the rape of another woman, Gonzales confessed to Townsend\u2019s killing and led authorities to her body. Gonzales\u2019 execution was the nation\u2019s eighth this year, according to data from the Death Penalty Information Center, a non-profit organization that tracks capital punishment in the US and has in the past been critical of the way it\u2019s administered. It was followed by the ninth Thursday in Oklahoma, which executed Richard Rojem for the 1984 kidnapping, rape and murder of his 7-year-old stepdaughter, Layla Cummings. Rojem was pronounced dead at 10:16 a.m., the director of the state Department of Corrections confirmed in a statement. The state\u2019s parole board voted last week against recommending clemency for Rojem, who had claimed he was innocent, according to CNN affiliate KOCO. Rojem, like Gonzales, was the second person executed in his respective state so far in 2024, according to the center\u2019s data. By this time last year, 13 inmates had been put to death in the US, the data shows.

In a court hearing Thursday, Latah County Judge John Judge proposed the trial date as well as deadlines for other legal filings in the case. Both the prosecution and defense said the deadlines were \u201creasonable\u201d and agreed, although the defense added things could change depending on how the case progresses. Judge set aside about three months for the trial, including two weeks for jury selection, eight weeks for the trial, and two weeks for potential post-conviction death penalty hearings and sentencing. \u201cThis is a great step to set these deadlines and hearings so that we can move through this,\u201d Judge said. The order also indicates any motions challenging the death penalty are to be filed by September 5, with responses due by October 10. If a motion to change the venue is granted, \u201cthe Court anticipates that the trial dates will not change,\u201d the ruling states. Thursday\u2019s scheduling hearing was part of the long and winding road since\u00a0four University of Idaho\u00a0students \u2013 Kaylee Goncalves, Ethan Chapin, Xana Kernodle and Madison Mogen \u2013 were fatally stabbed in the overnight hours of November 13, 2022, at a home just off the school\u2019s main campus in Moscow. Kohberger, a Washington State University graduate student in criminology, was arrested in the killings on December 30, 2022, in his home state of Pennsylvania. A\u00a0not guilty plea was entered\u00a0on his behalf last year, and his\u00a0attorneys have indicated the 29-year-old intends to present an alibi as part of his defense. Prosecutors have said they will seek the death penalty. The\u00a0progression of the case\u00a0has been slowed by a series of pre-trial motions and hearings related to the death penalty, a gag order, the use of investigative genetic genealogy and Kohberger\u2019s proposed alibi. Several of the issues have still not been resolved. Judge\u00a0said in April\u00a0he wants a \u201chearing at least every month,\u201d noting the importance of \u201ccleaning up\u201d the legal proceedings. Last month, Goncalves\u2019 family expressed their frustration at the pace of the pre-trial hearings. \u201cThis case is turning into a hamster wheel of motions, hearings, and delayed decisions,\u201d the family said in a statement in May. \u201cCan we all just agree that this case needs to move forward and the judge needs to start setting hard deadlines in this case?\u201d In court Thursday, Judge expressed similar views. \u201cIn my opinion, we\u2019re getting to a point of diminishing returns,\u201d he said. The defense noted that some of the deadlines may need to be amended or extended as new information comes into the case, and Judge said he understood. \u201cI just don\u2019t want to be scrambling around a month before the trial. We\u2019re all going to be very, very busy, and the more we can resolve certain motions, supplements, whatever we need to do,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m trying to do this sooner than later.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/27/us/bryan-kohberger-idaho-murder-trial-date/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/30/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_29_business_nathans-famous-competitive-eating-hot-dogs", "text": "Every Fourth of July, starting when she was 15, Jacqueline Lewis and her family come together to honor a great American tradition: the Nathan\u2019s Famous hot dog eating competition. \u201cI think people want to know how many hot dogs a human can eat in that amount of time.\u201d Lewis, now 26, told CNN on a warm June day while eating miniature corn dogs (at a leisurely pace) outside of the original Nathan\u2019s location in Coney Island. \u201cI think they want to know.\u201d Lewis and her family aren\u2019t the only ones who want to see how many franks competitors can scarf down in 10 minutes. Each year, close to two million people watch Nathan\u2019s hot dog eating contest on ESPN, according to the frankfurter brand. Tens of thousands of spectators come out to Brooklyn\u2019s Coney Island to watch the event in person. Competitors train for months in advance, preparing their bodies to consume thousands of calories in just a few minutes. When it was announced recently that reigning champion Joey Chestnut was barred from competing this year over his deal with Impossible Foods \u2013 a plant-based meat company \u2013 it made national headlines. Nathan\u2019s, and the marketing visionaries behind the annual event, helped shape competitive eating as we know it today: a bombastic, showy sport that some say symbolizes America\u2019s obsession with excess. But eating contests date back. Way back. Two men, many ginger cakes It seems like people have always had a fascination with how much someone can eat and how quickly. \u201cSpeed and volume competitions pop up in Greek myth, in the Eddas of Norse myth, and even in what may be mankind\u2019s first novel, Apuleius\u2019 \u2018Golden Ass,\u2019 written in the second century A.D.,\u201d wrote Jason Fagone in his book \u201cHorsemen of the Esophagus: Competitive Eating and the Big Fat American Dream.\u201d In the United States, the tradition goes back a few hundred years. Fagone cites a 1793 Pennsylvania newspaper that described an event in which two men \u201cundertook to eat twenty-four ginger cakes each.\u201d Over time, pie eating contests became a regular part of Fourth of July celebrations as well as \u201ca natural icebreaker for picnics, summer camps, and county fairs,\u201d Fagone wrote. In the 19th century, there were basically two kinds of contests, explained Adrienne Bitar, a lecturer in American studies at Cornell University and the author of \u201cDiet and the Disease of Civilization.\u201d There was speed eating \u2014\u00a0who could eat the most in a set amount of time \u2014\u00a0and untimed competitions, where the winner was the person who could eat the most, full stop. The foods back then were simpler, and unbranded. People competed over onions, eggs, watermelon and pies. The contests were \u201cvery lighthearted,\u201d she said, and not nearly as physically taxing as they are today \u2014 they were \u201cathletic like a three legged race is athletic.\u201d When Nathan\u2019s starting putting on its annual event in the 1970s, it looked more like those early contests. At the time, PR mavens Max Rosey and Mortimer Matz thought a hot dog eating competition would drum up some publicity for Nathan\u2019s. (They also seem to have made up the legend that the first Nathan\u2019s contest was held in 1916). Back then, \u201cthere was still kind of like a local flavor to it \u2026 the competitors were mostly just big guys from Long Island,\u201d Fagone told CNN. Contestants would enter, rapidly eat some hot dogs and go back home to their own barbecues, he said. Melody Andorfer was the winner of the first official Nathan\u2019s contest in 1972, according to the Coney Island History Project. She ate 12 hot dogs in 5 minutes \u2014 beating all other competitors, men and women, she told the non-profit in an interview in 2020. That first year, Nathan\u2019s used barrels and a plank of wood to make the competitors table, she recalled. \u201cThey put a white plastic tablecloth there. In front of you, they put on a paper plate hot dogs and no mustard, nothing to drink. Just the hot dogs.\u201d A couple of decades later, in the 1990s, brothers George and Richard Shea took over marketing for Nathan\u2019s. George Shea, who still hosts the competition, helped turn the homespun event into a gigantic spectacle. Hot dog publicity Americans say the annual competition is about many things: Coney Island, the Fourth of July, patriotism \u2014 but the event that kicked off the rise of mainstream competitive eating in the United States is, at its core, about publicity, the man who runs the contest said. \u201cIt is a sport that did not start as a sport. It was a platform for exposure for Nathan\u2019s and certainly many other brands in the years that followed,\u201d said George Shea, who co-founded Major League Eating, the professional league that now oversees the competition. Shea took over the contest in 1991 when Rosey died. Before Shea stepped in, he said, the contests included a couple of cameras, a handful of competitors and \u201c15 or 20 onlookers who just happened to be passersby and stopped.\u201d As host, Shea cultivated a persona designed to hype the event. He stands on stage in a flat-top straw hat and a suit and tie. Leading up to the contest, he makes grand proclamations about life and poetry as dramatic music plays. When announcing competitors, he builds up anticipation, treating the event more like a boxing match than a hot dog eating contest. The act is \u201ca little bit of Coney Island, it\u2019s a little bit of sports reporter, it\u2019s a little bit of apocalyptic preacher,\u201d Shea said. \u201cThe whole thing is just fantastic. You get up there, there are no rules, you say and do whatever you want and it\u2019s all about getting in motion, expressing the emotion \u2026 and universally the reaction I get from people is just \u2018this is not what I expected and I really love it,\u2019\u201d Shea said. It took a while to bring that performance to the mainstream. About a decade into his tenure as leader of the competition, Shea pitched a story to the LA Times. The ensuing article introduced the idea to a new part of the country, he said. After that, Shea signed deals for a documentary and TV special \u2014 just as superstar Takeru Kobayashi came onto the scene in 2001 and \u201cblew it open,\u201d Shea said. \u201cIt was coincidental and very mutually beneficial \u2014 the timing was very good because he had enormous star power,\u201d Shea said. The first year he participated in the contest, Kobayashi ate 50 hot dogs \u2014\u00a0nearly double the 2000 winner. Kobayashi showed \u201cthat you could treat (the contest) as an athletic activity and excel,\u201d Fagone said. The Japanese newcomer had taken the pursuit seriously, training and coming up with a novel way to approach the contest (separate hot dogs from buns and snap the frankfurters in half before eating). The intensity of the training, and the achievement, lent legitimacy to the whole endeavor. A few years later, ESPN started broadcasting the event. An American tradition, for better or worse For some, competitive eating is a symbol of American culture \u2014 the good and the bad. Eating contests are \u201ca celebration of excess,\u201d Bitar said, part and parcel of the myth of America that attracted immigrants when the country was still young. They represent \u201cthis larger fantasy, this national American fairy tale about consuming without consequence.\u201d Kobayashi himself has pierced that fantasy, revealing in a Netflix documentary show called \u201cHack Your Health\u201d that he no longer feels hunger and that he\u2019s worried competitive eating may have lasting ramifications for his health. (Nevertheless, he plans to compete against Chestnut in an upcoming Netflix special). The contests have staying power in part because of their shock value, Bitar said. Competitive eating \u201cbreaks all sorts of etiquette and social norms,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s one of these moments where all of our rules are broken.\u201d Shea also pointed to an underlying tension as a reason that Americans still watch the Nathan\u2019s hot dog eating contest after all these years. He described it as the \u201celement of \u2018wait you\u2019re not supposed to do that\u2019 and \u2018I can\u2019t believe he\u2019s doing that or she\u2019s doing that.\u2019\u201d But he sees the contest as a special event, one that symbolizes something else: happiness. \u201cIt goes to New York City history \u2026 but more important, hot dogs represent to me the joy of summer.\u201d Beatrice Fellman, 25, agrees. The Coney Island visitor, who described the hot dog as \u201cAmerica\u2019s meal\u201d on that warm day in June, said it stands for \u201cpatriotism and a good time.\u201d Fellman was one of many on a crowded boardwalk, flooded with hundreds of beachgoers trying to soak up the sun, carrying towels and beach chairs. The mood was celebratory. Bass bumped from speakers and a live band played to about a dozen people dancing. Despite the heat, there were lines at both Nathan\u2019s locations, where people waited for the famous hot dogs and crinkle-cut french fries. \u201cWe love the Nathan\u2019s hot dog eating competition because we love how it brings the city together,\u201d Fellman said, standing with a group of her friends, all wearing Nathan\u2019s hot dog eating contest T-shirts. \u201cIt celebrates a beautiful American comfort food that is the hot dog.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/29/business/nathans-famous-competitive-eating-hot-dogs/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/30/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_27_us_uvalde-grand-jury-indictments-police-chief-officer", "text": "A grand jury has indicted two former Uvalde school police officers in the botched law enforcement response to the 2022 mass shooting at Robb Elementary school that left 19 children and two teachers dead, two Texas state government sources with knowledge of the indictment told CNN Thursday. Former Uvalde Consolidated Independent School District Police Chief Pete Arredondo and former school police officer Adrian Gonzales were named in the indictments, which represent the first criminal charges filed in the school massacre. Arredondo surrendered himself to the custody of the Texas Rangers in Uvalde on Thursday, an official with the Texas Department of Public Safety told CNN. The former chief was booked on 10 counts of child endangerment and known criminal negligence, according to the indictment. Arredondo was then released\u00a0on bond, according to the Uvalde County Jail. Gonzales was booked into the Uvalde County Jail early Friday afternoon, the Uvalde Leader-News reported, citing Uvalde County Sheriff\u2019s Office Chief Deputy Brandon McCutchen. Gonzales was waiting to be processed, McCutchen told the paper. Earlier in the day, Gonzales\u2019 attorney Nico LaHood told CNN in a statement the former school police officer was planning to self-surrender \u201cso the judicial process can move forward.\u201d \u201cIt is very early on in our representation, so we will be working to acquire the evidence, the government is relying on, in this accusation,\u201d LaHood said. \u201cMr. Gonzales\u2019 position is he did not violate school district policy or state law. The application of this statute, to law enforcement, under these circumstances is unprecedented in the state of Texas. It will take time to evaluate these allegations and the underlying facts,\u201d LaHood continued. CNN has reached out to the Uvalde County Jail for more information. The indictment against Gonzales was not immediately available from the Uvalde County District Court clerk\u2019s office. \u201cOur administration has not been contacted by the District Attorney\u2019s Office regarding any of our staff and we don\u2019t have any comment at this time regarding the matter,\u201d the Uvalde Police Department said in a statement on Facebook Thursday night. The Uvalde County District Attorney\u2019s office is not planning to file any more indictments in the botched response to the shooting, according to family members who have spoken to District Attorney Christina Mitchell. Kimberly Mata-Rubio, the mother of 10-year-old victim Lexi Rubio, and Brett Cross, the guardian of 10-year-old victim Uziyah Garcia, told CNN they were informed by Mitchell there would be no further indictments coming out of the grand jury. \u201cI\u2019m glad two people are indicted,\u201d Mata-Rubio told CNN Friday. \u201cIt\u2019s not justice until there are convictions. But I am also aware that there were others at fault that day, and it\u2019s hard to accept that they will not face any consequences.\u201d \u201cI would be lying if I didn\u2019t say I feel like that\u2019s not enough,\u201d Cross told CNN. Arredondo faces 10 felony charges of child endangerment for failing to recognize the incident as an active shooting and for failing to take proper action to intervene, the indictment says, and these behaviors placed each child in \u201cimminent danger of bodily injury, death, physical impairment and mental impairment.\u201d Gonzales also faces felony charges of abandoning and endangering a child, Mitchell, the Uvalde district attorney, told the Uvalde Leader-News. The district attorney\u2019s office declined to comment to CNN Friday. Family members of the victims have been meeting with the DA\u2019s office to discuss the results of the months-long grand jury investigation, according to Brett Cross, the guardian of 10-year-old Uziyah Garcia, one of the fourth graders killed in the shooting rampage. Jesse Rizo, the uncle of one of the students killed, Jacklyn Cazares, said he was pleasantly surprised to learn about two officers\u2019 indictments, but had hoped more people were faced with criminal charges, he told CNN\u2019s Kate Bolduan Friday. \u201cIt\u2019s the beginning of something, right?\u201d Rizo said. \u201cBut in order to bring closure, you would want all the officers that didn\u2019t do their job that day, that failed to respond appropriately, you would want them to be held accountable in an equal way.\u201d Rizo hopes the DA will explain her intentions in public and indicate if any more indictments can be expected, he said. \u201cA lot of us are not exposed to the daily legalities of all these things, so we get a little confused with the technical things that go on,\u201d Rizo said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of questions that need to be answered as well.\u201d The Uvalde Consolidated Independent School District offered its condolences to the families of the victims Friday, saying it had no further information to add. \u201cAs with the rest of the Uvalde community, we have only just learned about the grand jury decision regarding two indictments being issued,\u201d school district spokeswoman Anne Marie Espinoza said in a statement. How the fallout unfolded Earlier this year, the\u00a0US Justice Department\u00a0released a damning report that concluded law enforcement officers had\u00a0many opportunities to reassess their flawed response\u00a0to the May 24, 2022, shooting at Robb Elementary School. Bursts of gunfire, reports a teacher had been shot and then a desperate call from a student trapped with the gunman could \u2013 and should \u2013 all have prompted a drive to stop the bloodshed far sooner, said the report. Instead, it took 77 minutes from when the 18-year-old shooter walked into Robb Elementary School until he was stopped. The carnage remains among the\u00a0deadliest\u00a0episodes in America\u2019s\u00a0ongoing scourge\u00a0of campus shootings. Critical failures in leadership\u00a0among specific law enforcement officers who rushed to Robb Elementary are cited by the Justice Department, whose\u00a0575-page report\u00a0was released nearly 20 months after the massacre. Arredondo was fired\u00a0in August 2022 for his role in the failed response. In May, his replacement, Joshua Gutierrez, submitted his\u00a0resignation and his last day on the job was Wednesday, according to a school official\u2019s statement. Gonzales, who had been with school district police since July 2021 and previously with Uvalde police since 2009, told investigators he was at the high school when he heard a report of a vehicle accident by Robb Elementary and went to check. Gonzales, who said he was one of the first officers to arrive, heard shots and entered the south hallway along with Arredondo. Gonzales said he tried to call for the SWAT team on his radio but could not transmit inside the school building so he left. \u201cOnce I got out to get radio reception, I never went back in,\u201d he told investigators. While the gunman was unchallenged inside the school, Gonzales said he spent much of the time waiting with emergency medics outside the west door. He also found a set of keys and a plan of the school, he said, that had been requested by a Texas Ranger on scene. State Sen. Roland Gutierrez told CNN Thursday he believes the Texas Department of Public Safety also bears substantial responsibility for the failed law enforcement response and should have been included in the indictments. \u201cThis is nothing but a whitewash of the most tragic mass shooting in our nation\u2019s history \u2013 one of them at least \u2013 and certainly the worst officer-involved response to a mass shooting in our nation\u2019s history. And all\u00a0of it falls in the hands of the Department of Public Safety and (its director) Steve McCraw.\u201d During the fallout following the massacre, DPS Director Steven McCraw repeatedly called the law enforcement response to the shooting an \u201cabject failure\u201d and said each of its officers\u2019 actions would be internally investigated and scrutinized by the district attorney. \u201cIt was more than an abject failure and it\u2019s a crime not to indict those officers,\u201d Gutierrez said. CNN has sought comment from the state\u2019s Department of Public Safety. Officers, school employees and shooting victims testified before grand jury Multiple law enforcement officers who responded to the shooting, including members of the Texas Department of Public Safety, were ordered to testify before the grand jury, CNN previously reported. School employees and victims of the shooting began their testimony before the grand jury in March \u2013 shortly after the Uvalde City Council\u00a0released an independent report clearing all local officers of wrongdoing. The independent investigator hired by the city\u00a0reported his findings at a packed city council meeting, saying all the officers who responded to the school from the Uvalde Police Department acted in good faith and should be exonerated. The findings sparked the fury of many victims\u2019 parents and community members who have\u00a0said for nearly two years that some should not be absolved. Less than a week after the release of the report, Uvalde Police Chief Daniel Rodriguez abruptly announced he would resign, effective April 6, saying it was time for \u201ca new chapter\u201d in his career. Federal report describes failed police response The Justice Department report dismissed the early official narrative of brave first responders saving lives that day and said \u201cmany victims shared that it added to their pain during a challenging time.\u201d The report found ample problems also emerged after the gunman was killed \u2013 from getting students away from the school and reunited with families to how bereaved parents were told their children were dead, the release of information about what happened, and the provision of therapy services. The report describes the quick arrival of law enforcement officers who ran toward the sound of gunfire, then almost immediately stopped once they got near the classrooms where the gunman was killing fourth graders and educators. That decision ran counter to\u00a0widely established active shooter response protocol, which instructs law enforcement to move toward and eliminate any threat. Instead, the intensity level dropped as responders began to treat the situation as a \u201cbarricaded suspect\u201d operation that did not need immediate action, even as more officers arrived and the signals of ongoing danger multiplied. That was the \u201csingle most critical tactical failure,\u201d the team from the Justice Department\u2019s Office of Community Oriented Policing Services found. In May, 19 families of the students and teachers killed or injured in the mass shooting said they settled a lawsuit with the city for $2 million and announced they are suing 92 officers with Texas Department of Public Safety, the school district and individual employees. The city confirmed the settlement in a statement. \u201cIt has been an unbearable two years,\u201d Javier Cazares, the father of 9-year-old victim Jacklyn Cazares, said at a May news conference. \u201cWe all know who took our children\u2019s lives, but there was an obvious systemic failure out there on May 24. The whole world saw that.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/27/us/uvalde-grand-jury-indictments-police-chief-officer/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/30/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_27_us_minneapolis-juror-bribery-indictment", "text": "Federal charges have been filed against five people linked to a recent attempt to\u00a0bribe a juror\u00a0to help secure a not guilty verdict in a trial over a $250 million fraud scheme that exploited a federally funded child nutrition program, the US attorney in Minnesota announced in a news conference Wednesday. The juror, identified only as \u201cJuror 52,\u201d immediately called 911 to report the attempt after a gift bag containing $120,000 in cash was dropped off at her front door earlier this month, FBI Special Agent\u00a0Travis Wilmer said in an affidavit filed June 3 in federal court. Three of those charged this week, Abdimajid Nur, Abdiaziz Farah and Said Farah, were defendants in the fraud trial connected to Feeding Our Future, a nonprofit organization prosecutors say was used to skim nearly $250 million from federal child nutrition programs. Juror 52, who is not accused of any wrongdoing, was dismissed from the case and replaced with an alternate. Nur and Abdiaziz Farah were convicted of wire fraud, bribery, money laundering, conspriacy and other crimes, while Said Farah was acquitted, according to a Justice Department news release and agency spokesperson Tasha Zerna. Court documents state Juror 52 was targeted \u201cbecause she was the youngest juror and they believed her to be the only juror of color.\u201d Included with the alleged bribery money was a document described by US Attorney Andrew Luger as \u201cchilling.\u201d The document laid out instructions for the juror to follow with arguments for her to use to sway other jurors, the indictment states. Those arguments focus on an assertion of prejudice by the government based on the defendants\u2019 immigration status and race, according to the indictment. Luger said the note inside the gift bag also included a clear message to the juror that read, \u201cYou alone can end this case.\u201d Nur recruited Ladan Ali, a woman who \u201cattempted to follow\u201d the juror home after the first day of closing arguments and two days later dropped off the gift bag containing the bribery money at the juror\u2019s house and gave it to a relative, the indictment says. Said Farah allegedly provided the funds. Another defendant, Abdulkarim Farah, accompanied Ali and videotaped her dropping off the money, according to the indictment.\u00a0Abdiaziz Farah, Said Farah and Abdulkarim Farah are brothers. CNN has reached out to attorneys for all five defendants for comment. The\u00a0charges they face\u00a0include bribery of a juror, conspiracy to bribe a juror and corruptly influencing a juror. When the\u00a0alleged\u00a0bribery attempt was announced in court, all defendants in the trial were ordered to turn their phones in to authorities. Abdiaziz Farah engaged a factory reset\u00a0in an attempt to wipe\u00a0all the data from his device, according to court documents.\u00a0He also faces a count of obstruction of justice connected to that allegation. Recovered videos from the phones of the defendants include recordings of the bribe money being dropped off at Juror 52\u2019s home, according to the indictment. \u201cThey took the video to ensure that the money was delivered and as evidence to show Juror 52\u2019s complicity if she accepted the bribe but did not follow through with a not guilty verdict,\u201d the indictment states. Days later, a search warrant was served at Abdiaziz Farah\u2019s home, and among the items found by investigators was a list of all the jurors\u2019\u00a0names hidden inside a water bottle,\u00a0a DOJ warrant shows. Fingerprints from the bag of money led investigators to Ladan\u00a0Ali,\u00a0Luger said.\u00a0During Wednesday\u2019s news conference, Luger shared surveillance images he says show Ali in a rental car following\u00a0Juror\u00a052 home from court. \u201cThis is more than just a mob movie. This is a chilling attack on our system of justice,\u201d he added. \u201cThey studied her, followed her and determined that she would succumb to their scheme. The fact that they failed does not lessen the magnitude of what they tried to do,\u201d said Luger. \u201cFortunately for all of us, Juror 52 could not be bought, and she terminated their scheme.\u201d \u201cThe sophistication and intentionality of this plot cannot be overstated,\u201d said Luger, adding Juror 52\u2019s movements were tracked night and day. The three Farah brothers are scheduled to make their initial appearances on the charges in federal court Thursday afternoon. Ladan Ali is expected to turn herself in later this week, and Abdimajid Nur is set to appear in court next week, according to Zerna.

{"id": "2024_06_29_business_india-adani-slum-redevelopment-concerns-intl-hnk-dst", "text": "When Masoom Ali Shaikh arrived in Mumbai in 1974 as a young man from northern India, the patch of land where he set up shop was \u201cjust a creek with no proper road and garbage all around,\u201d he said. Fifty years later, that swampy area \u2014 once a fishing village and rubbish dump \u2014 is now Dharavi, one of Asia\u2019s biggest slums and a bustling hub of industry in India\u2019s financial capital. Famously depicted in the 2008 Oscar-winning film \u201cSlumdog Millionaire,\u201d Dharavi is a\u00a0cacophonous maze of small businesses on every corner, from bakeries to butchers to barbers. These shops service roughly one million residents living cheek by jowl in cramped buildings and narrow alleys. Many of them are migrants and artisans who brought the crafts of their home states to establish businesses in the sprawling 500-acre slum. These small-scale enterprises, which generate a collective annual turnover of more than $1 billion by some estimates, are a crucial source of livelihood for many families, some of whom have lived in Dharavi for generations. Shaikh is one of them. After arriving in Dharavi from his home state Uttar Pradesh, he set up a shoe-making business which allowed him to support six family members over the years, even opening a second shoe store for his daughter to operate. However, many residents fear their livelihoods could now be at risk as the slum prepares to undergo a drastic transformation, overseen by one of Asia\u2019s richest men. Over the decades, there have been several failed attempts to redevelop Dharavi, a process which experts say has always been politically fraught for several reasons: the sheer scale and density of the slum and the high value of its land in central Mumbai, for starters. Residents and authorities point to the slum\u2019s myriad problems, including extreme crowdedness and poor sanitation. Many residents have no access to running water or clean toilets and suffer from various health problems. In some poorly ventilated areas, dust perpetually hangs in the air and smoke wafts from nearby workshops. That could change with this newest plan, led by billionaire and infrastructure tycoon Gautam Adani, founder of the Adani Group, who briefly ousted Jeff Bezos as the world\u2019s second-wealthiest person in 2022. \u201cA new chapter of pride and purpose is beginning. It is a historic opportunity for us to create a new Dharavi of dignity, safety and inclusiveness,\u201d Adani wrote in a message on his company\u2019s website after winning the bid to redevelop the area in 2022. He vowed to \u201ccreate a state-of-the-art world-class city, which will reflect a resurgent, self-assured, growing India finding its new place on the global stage as the 21st century belongs to India.\u201d But his vision of a new Dharavi has been met with mixed reactions, from hopeful residents ready for change to skeptics who have heard empty rhetoric for years. Some are vehemently against the proposal, with demonstrators taking to the streets in protest, concerned that Adani\u2019s plan could imperil their homes and businesses. \u201cWhen redevelopment happens, the only thing I want is to be relocated to the same place,\u201d Shaikh told CNN during a visit to his workshop in April, speaking as his employees hammered out soles and manipulated leather onto shoe moulds. \u201cIf I am thrown into some different area, I will lose all my business and my livelihood,\u201d he added. \u201cMy vendors and buyers will not know where I am moved, which would harm my business.\u201d Lofty promises Migrants have been flocking to Dharavi for more than a century, according to Mumbai authorities, many settling there because it was free and unregulated government-owned land. Almost from the start, Dharavi was defined by its industries: from the traditional potters of Gujarat who began arriving in the late 1800s, to leather tanners from Tamil Nadu and embroidery workers from Uttar Pradesh. The slum\u2019s growth reflected that of Mumbai itself, a diverse city famous for attracting Bollywood hopefuls and job-seekers from across India. Throughout the country, migrants and poorer populations often settle on \u201cperipheral lands, unwanted lands, because they\u2019re seen as hazardous in some way or uninhabitable,\u201d said Lalitha Kamath, a professor of urban planning and policy at the Tata Institute of Social Sciences in Mumbai. In Dharavi\u2019s case, \u201cthey built a habitable place \u2026 they reclaimed it from marshy land to something today that\u2019s really valuable,\u201d she added. But because of its informal nature, Dharavi remained undeveloped and haphazard for many years. It wasn\u2019t until the 1970s that the government made basic improvements: building key roads, laying sewers and water lines and providing residents with taps, toilets and electricity. For decades, the government struggled to find developers and builders who could carry out the expensive, logistically complicated task of redeveloping Dharavi from top to bottom. There were also many questions at play: Which residents would be re-located, and to where? How would business owners be compensated? Who would be eligible? \u201cAll slum redevelopment is quite fraught,\u201d Kamath said. But Dharavi had unique challenges due to the size of its population, the importance of its economy, and the value of the land \u2014 surrounded by affluent commercial districts in the heart of the city, close enough to the airport that arriving planes can see the sprawl of the slum from the air. After years of stalled progress and failed tendering processes, Adani\u2019s company won the right to redevelop Dharavi with a 50 billion rupee ($612 million) bid, Reuters reported at the time. It\u2019s expected to take seven years to complete, and is the latest mega-project taken on by Adani Enterprises, which already supplies electricity in Mumbai. His promises are lofty. About a million people will be \u201crehabilitated and resettled,\u201d with both residential homes and businesses up for redevelopment, he said in the message on his website. And, he vowed, residents will have better healthcare and recreational facilities, open spaces, a hospital and school, and more, he said. Ineligible residents who can\u2019t be rehoused within Dharavi will be given relocation options instead. But some residents aren\u2019t convinced. \u201cFor the last 30 years, we are dreaming and hearing about redevelopment, but nothing has taken place,\u201d said Dilip Gabekar, 60, who was born in Dharavi and works for a non-profit aiding women and children in the slum. \u201cOnly during elections, there is noise about redeveloping\u00a0Dharavi,\u201d he added, speaking to CNN weeks before Mumbai went to the polls in May in a nationwide election that ultimately saw Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his far-right Bharatiya Janata Party win another five-year term. \u201cBut once elections are over, the talks about redevelopment also die down,\u201d he added, despite Adani having won the bid long before the most recent general election. In response to CNN\u2019s request for comment, a spokesperson from the Dharavi Redevelopment Project Private Ltd (DRPPL) said the project was \u201ccommitted to fulfilling Dharavi\u2019s needs and providing residents with new homes with better amenities, accessibility, and resources.\u201d They added that they are exploring \u201call possible options\u201d to protect livelihoods and businesses, and to help raise people\u2019s incomes \u2014 for instance, by consolidating supply chains, giving all businesses tax refunds for five years and launching job initiatives for youth and women. Who gets a free house? Chief among residents\u2019 worries is their eligibility under Adani\u2019s plan, which could determine who gets a free new apartment in the redeveloped space and who may have to move elsewhere on their own dime. According to the DRPPL spokesperson, ground-floor residents who lived in Dharavi before the year 2000 will be granted a free unit within the area that is at least 350 square feet. Higher-floor residents, or those who lived there between 2000 and 2011, will receive a 300-square-foot home following a one-time payment of 250,000 rupees (about $3,000), located within 10 kilometers (6.2 miles) of Dharavi. Those who moved to Dharavi after 2011 will also receive a 300-square-foot home within the same radius, but will have to pay rent to the government. All apartments, either in or near Dharavi, will have separate bedrooms, toilets and kitchens, the spokesperson said. The plan is a collaboration between Adani and Maharashtra state authorities. The land itself will remain government-owned. With the last survey conducted in Dharavi 15 years ago, a firm hired by Adani is now going door to door to collect residents\u2019 information. That could spell trouble for many residents who never got the proper documents to prove their long-term tenancy. \u201cThere is no alternative for someone who has no proper paperwork,\u201d said Gabekar, the NGO worker.\u00a0Many of those deemed ineligible can\u2019t afford to relocate to the housing options provided by Adani, he added. Even those with the right papers are worried. Shaikh, the shoemaker, showed CNN his tenancy and business documents. They\u2019re written in smeared blue ink, laminated and kept carefully tucked away in a drawer. \u201cI have enough papers to prove that I have been in this place for a long time,\u201d he said. But, he added, many businesses have changed hands over the years, leaving new owners without the proper documents. Baburao Mane, a former elected state assembly member affiliated with the opposition party, and a Dharavi native himself, has led some of the most vocal protests against the Adani plan, including a rally in December that saw thousands of people march to Adani\u2019s offices in Mumbai. Only about 50,000 residents, about 5% of the population, have valid papers, Mane estimated. He claimed that the ongoing survey would bring that number down further. \u201cThey should make no difference between valid and non-valid papers to allot places. Anyone who has land in\u00a0Dharavi\u00a0should be given land during the redevelopment,\u201d he said. When asked about concerns over proving eligibility, the DRPPL spokesperson said its plan had \u201csuitable redressal mechanisms to address such eventualities.\u201d Even if eligible residents get re-housed within Dharavi, there are concerns over space. Often, several generations of a family live within cramped multi-story buildings. But only the ground-floor residents will receive the free housing, leaving about 700,000 upper-floor residents ineligible, NDTV reported. \u201cAll the houses in Dharavi have two or three floors \u2026 I have 15 family members who stay above each other (in the same building),\u201d said Neeta Jadhav, a 46-year-old resident who has lived in Dharavi for 26 years, and who has the documents to prove eligibility. \u201cIf we are all put in one small apartment there will be a lot of conflict, so the developer should consider giving us a bigger space,\u201d she said. Mane, the former politician and protest leader, said the group was demanding 500 square feet for each Dharavi household, vowing to \u201cnot let even one house be demolished\u201d until the government agrees to their conditions. Hope and mistrust Despite the pushback from some, there is uniform agreement among residents that Dharavi does need redevelopment. It\u2019s just a question of how, and who can be trusted with such a mammoth project. \u201cI will be happy if development takes place,\u201d said resident Jadhav. \u201cI want my children to have a better life, and move from here to a place that has proper amenities like a good school and a park for them to play.\u201d \u201cIf Adani gives what he has promised, then our life will improve for sure,\u201d she added. And there are some who are enthusiastically in favor of Adani\u2019s plan. \u201cIf Adani redevelops\u00a0Dharavi, it will be good for us as we don\u2019t want to stay\u00a0in Dharavi\u00a0any longer,\u201d said 42-year-old potter Dhanshuk Purshottamwala, whose family has lived in the area and run the pottery business for generations. He hopes Adani\u2019s plan will end that family tradition, with all their necessary papers in order. \u201cI don\u2019t want my children to be living the way I am,\u201d he said, speaking to CNN from his workshop where wet and drying pots line the walls and floors. \u201cI don\u2019t teach my children this skill, I want them to study and have a better life.\u201d While the redevelopment is a massive challenge, Adani is behind some of India\u2019s most ambitious infrastructure projects. He is India\u2019s largest airport operator and\u00a0owns India\u2019s biggest private port operator and private thermal power operator. He\u2019s also one of the country\u2019s largest developers and operators of coal mines, and is simultaneously building the world\u2019s biggest clean energy plant. However, he\u2019s a relative newcomer in the field of slum redevelopment and affordable housing, said Kamath, adding that the lack of affordable housing is what prompted people to set up informal settlements in the first place. And for most residents that CNN spoke to, their hopes for change are dimmed by deep distrust of Adani\u2019s conglomerate and the city government. Several pointed to the 2023 fraud allegations against the Adani Group, which sparked an ongoing investigation by India\u2019s regulators and lost the company over $100 billion in value in a stock market meltdown.\u00a0In January, the country\u2019s top court ordered the regulators to quickly finish their investigation\u00a0and said no further probes were needed, a decision Adani celebrated at the time. His representatives have called the allegations baseless and malicious. Others residents complained about a lack of transparency, saying they had received little official communication and were not included in meetings about the redevelopment, leaving them in the dark about the details or timing of the plan. This is common across many slum redevelopments in India, said Kamath, describing these projects as top-down, with power held by a small group of private developers and state officials. \u201cFolks from the community will very rarely get much space at the table,\u201d she said. It\u2019s one reason why \u201cthere are concerns with all kinds of redevelopment projects that have been proposed, not just this one, because they usually don\u2019t do justice to every group that lives there or has claim to that space, who has made it what it is today,\u201d she said. Then, there\u2019s an ongoing lawsuit by a rival company that alleged the Maharashtra state government had improperly canceled an original 2018 bidding process\u00a0and restarted it so Adani could win, according to Reuters. The state and Adani deny any wrongdoing, but that hasn\u2019t stopped many residents from viewing Adani and his government ties with suspicion. Adani is a vocal champion of Prime Minister Modi, and opposition leaders have ferociously questioned their relationship \u2014 with some even claiming that they were punished for pursuing the issue. The DRPPL spokesperson said Adani had won the project \u201cthrough an open, transparent, fair, and competitive bidding process,\u201d and said claims of any political relationships were \u201cbaseless and aimed at spreading misinformation.\u201d Meanwhile, some are simply tired of listening to the same old promises. \u201cI have grown\u00a0from a child to a woman (in Dharavi) and the development saga just keeps going on,\u201d said Reshma Prasant Bobde, a 42-year-old housewife whose family has lived there for generations. She described seeing the same cycle of politicians pushing redevelopment for \u201ctheir own agenda,\u201d followed by residents protesting and, ultimately, stagnation. \u201cThis talk of development\u00a0has been going on since my grandmother\u2019s time, but it hasn\u2019t moved an inch,\u201d she said. \u201cMy children, who are 11 and seven years old, will grow old and nothing will change in\u00a0Dharavi.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/29/business/india-adani-slum-redevelopment-concerns-intl-hnk-dst/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/30/2024", "section": "us"}}

The Nassau County Sheriff\u2019s Office Marine Unit found the victim with a critical injury when they responded to the shark attack at about 11:15 a.m. local time, the\u00a0sheriff\u2019s office said in a social media post. The shark bit the man\u2019s forearm and he was losing blood, authorities said. \u201cActing swiftly, a deputy boarded the vessel and applied a tourniquet to stop the bleeding,\u201d the sheriff\u2019s office said. \u201cThe deputy then piloted the boat to the Dee Dee Bartels boat ramp, where Fernandina Beach Fire Rescue was waiting.\u201d The man was then airlifted to a local hospital for treatment. While he is in critical condition, he is expected to recover, the sheriff\u2019s office said. The incident comes after two separate shark attacks within just 90 minutes of each other left three people injured at neighboring Walton County, Florida, beaches earlier this month. Shark activity is typically at its peak in Florida waters between April and October, according to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. \u201cYet shark bites still remain very rare,\u201d the commission said. \u201cHumans are 30 times more likely to be struck by lightning in Florida than to be bitten by a shark. Experts agree that the increase in the number of shark bites in recent years is more related to an increase in human visitors than to an increase in shark populations or activity.\u201d In Florida, shark bites are fatal less than 1% of the time, according to the commission. \u201cExperts believe that most shark bites are cases of mistaken identity, which explains why nearly all shark bites that occur in Florida waters are of a bite-and-release nature,\u201d the commission said. While the risk of being bitten by a shark is extremely low, Florida tops global charts for the number of shark bites, according to the Florida Museum of Natural History\u2019s annual shark attack\u00a0report. In 2023, Florida had 16 unprovoked shark bite incidents reported, which represents 44% of the United States total and 23% worldwide. Volusia County had the most shark bites, and the others were reported in Brevard, St. Lucie, Miami-Dade, Palm Beach, Escambia and Pinellas counties. There were no fatalities reported last year in the state as a result of the attacks.

{"id": "2024_06_27_us_oklahoma-schools-bible-curriculum", "text": "All Oklahoma schools are required to incorporate the Bible and the Ten Commandments in their curriculums, effective immediately, the state\u2019s chief education officer announced in a memorandum Thursday. At a State Board of Education meeting, Oklahoma State Superintendent\u00a0of Public Instruction Ryan Walters said the Bible is \u201cone of the most foundational documents used for the Constitution and the birth of our country.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s crystal clear to us that in the Oklahoma academic standards under Title 70 on multiple occasions, the Bible is a necessary historical document to teach our kids about the history of this country, to have a complete understanding of Western civilization, to have an understanding of the basis of our legal system,\u201d Walters said. Every classroom in the state from grades 5 through 12 must have a Bible and all teachers must teach from the Bible in the classroom, Walters said. The Oklahoma memorandum follows a law in Louisiana passed\u00a0June 19,\u00a0that\u00a0requires\u00a0all public classrooms to display the Ten Commandments. A group of Louisiana parents and civil rights organizations are\u00a0suing\u00a0the state over the new law, contending the legislation violates both US Supreme Court precedent and the First Amendment. Oklahoma\u2019s directive \u201cis in alignment with the educational standards approved on or about May 2019, with which all districts must comply,\u201d according to a news release. \u201cThe Bible is an indispensable historical and cultural touchstone,\u201d Walters said in the release. \u201cWithout basic knowledge of it, Oklahoma students are unable to properly contextualize the foundation of our nation. This is not merely an educational directive but a crucial step in ensuring our students grasp the core values and historical context of our country.\u201d Interfaith Alliance, a national organization that seeks to protect religious freedoms, told CNN in a statement Thursday: \u201cThis is blatant religious coercion that should have absolutely no place in public schools \u2013 in Oklahoma or any other state.\u201d \u201cTrue religious freedom means ensuring that no one religious group is allowed to impose their viewpoint on all Americans. The vast majority of people of faith in this country reject these dangerous, intimidating efforts to force a Christian nationalist agenda into our schools, our courts and our government,\u201d the statement said. The new memo comes after the Oklahoma Supreme Court blocked an effort to establish the first publicly funded religious charter school in the country. The court on Tuesday ordered the state to rescind its contract with\u00a0St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School\u00a0in a 6-2 decision with one recusal. \u201cUnder Oklahoma law, a charter school is a public school,\u201d wrote Justice James R. Winchester for the court. \u201cAs such, a charter school must be nonsectarian. However, St. Isidore will evangelize the Catholic faith as part of its school curriculum while sponsored by the State.\u201d Walters called the ruling \u201cone of the worst\u201d decisions the state Supreme Court has made and pledged to \u201cfight back.\u201d \u201cWhat the court did was rule against the parents of Oklahoma who have demanded more choices for their kids. We have a great opportunity to make sure that parents have the most options of any parents in the country here in Oklahoma, by giving them the ability to go to a public school, charter schools, private schools, this would have been the most unique charter school in the country,\u201d Walters said. \u201cSo I want you all to know, we will continue to fight back against this, we want to continue to provide an opportunity for parents to send their kids to high-quality schools.\u201d The American Civil Liberties Union applauded the decision, saying, \u201cCharter schools are public schools that must be secular and serve all students. St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School, which plans to discriminate against students, families, and staff and indoctrinate students into one religion, cannot operate as a public charter school.\u201d This is a developing story and will be updated.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/27/us/oklahoma-schools-bible-curriculum/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/30/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_29_business_lego-most-stolen-items", "text": "Lego\u2019s fanbase, which famously cuts across kids, teenagers and grownup collectors, is seeing some unsavory characters break into the mix, and for all the wrong reasons. Lego products, especially the pricier sets that range from over $100 to $1,000 or more, are being targeted for theft both by individual shoplifters and larger organized retail crime rings who make a beeline for sets sitting on store shelves because they can fetch a good profit at resale both in legal and illegal channels. Miguel Zuniga, who operates a Bricks & Minifigs Lego resale franchise store in Lumita, Los Angeles County, is still dealing with a break-in on June 18. The Lego heist happened around 5 am that Tuesday morning. \u201cI was asleep, and the ADT security system gave me a call. Then my wife got a call. I went straight to the cameras and saw we were being robbed,\u201d Zuniga told CNN. He got to his store within 10 minutes, but the burglars were gone \u2013 with about $5,000 to $7,000 of Legos, he estimates. Retail crime experts told CNN that stolen Lego sets are easy to resell, they\u2019re typically hard to trace and they can fetch close to the original retail price if in mint condition and unused. Even used sets in decent shape can go for 50% of the original price. In recent months, robbers have stolen Legos in several states. Earlier this month, police in California arrested two people in connection with a retail theft ring that allegedly stole thousands of Lego toys from several Southern California retailers, according to CNN affiliate KABC. LAPD detectives recovered more than 2,800 boxes of Lego toys with retail value of $20 to over $1,000 per item, the report quoted a police statement as saying. In Philadelphia, police logged a series of Lego set thefts in recent months at retailers such as Barnes & Noble and Target, with stolen sets valued from $250 to up to $1,000 each. Target told CNN it did not have any information to share on Lego thefts at its stores. Barnes & Noble did not immediately respond to a request for comment. And north of the border, in Richmond, British Columbia, police in March seized a haul of more than 1,000 stolen toys. Among the stolen goods were more than $150,000 worth of Lego sets and other plush toys. Among the most stolen products Although hard data is difficult to come by, experts said Lego sets are routinely among the top 10 most stolen retail products, along with branded denim, handbags, designer shoes, Olay skincare and Apple products. \u201cLego is unique. The brand is always refreshing their offerings, always on trend with tie-ins to pop culture and special edition sets,\u201d said Read Hayes, a criminologist at the University of Florida and the director of the Loss Prevention Research Council, whose members include Walmart, Target, Home Depot and Gap. Hayes told CNN his team works with a majority of retailers that carry Lego products as well as Legoland theme parks. \u201cDemand is always there.\u201d As a result, there\u2019s not only a market for stolen Lego products but also a burgeoning counterfeit market, especially online. Casey Slaughter, a captain with the Wichita, Kansas, police department who heads its property crimes bureau, is very familiar with Lego offenses. \u201cWe see Lego toys as one of the more frequently stolen items in our area,\u201d Slaughter told CNN. \u201cAny retailer selling the brand is susceptible to Lego theft, but we also have a couple of Lego-specific secondhand stores that have popped up as resellers. They\u2019re being targeted.\u201d It\u2019s easy money for Lego thieves, he said. \u201cThey\u2019re difficult to track where they were stolen from,\u201d he said. Between January 8, 2024 and May 7, 2024, Wichita Police investigated 19 Lego thefts, according to data the police department provided to CNN. Thefts included sets based on Star Wars, Indiana Jones and Back to the Future films, the data indicated. When reached for comment, Lego directed CNN to online resources on its website to educate consumers how to spot fake online Lego stores and fake Lego products. In California, several Bricks & Minifigs stores have been robbed since April. \u201cThis is probably our fourth or fifth hit that deals mainly with Legos. They happen quickly, 30 seconds to a minute,\u201d Captain Calvin Mah with the Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department\u2019s major crimes bureau said in an interview with CNN, referring to the robbery at Zuniga\u2019s store. \u201cIn watching the surveillance video, I could see them targeting specific Lego sets. They knew exactly what they were looking for. They wanted the high-end and high-value sets, the rare or collectible ones,\u201d he said. Zuniga got emotional when speaking about the robbery to CNN. After cleaning his store the day of the burglary, Zuniga went home to shower. \u201cWhen I came back I sent a bat signal to the community to come and support us in our time of need,\u201d he said. Customers came, some even donating their Lego sets. He bought Lego sets that were on sale at the local Target to fill up empty shelves. \u201cAt 9 am, the first customer that came was a 71-year-old who has built some of the most expensive Lego sets,\u201d Zuniga recounted, his own voice cracking as he sobbed. \u201cHe\u2019s our local legend. He showed up in tears.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/29/business/lego-most-stolen-items/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/30/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_29_business_tractor-supply-dei-roles-goals", "text": "Tractor Supply Company has eliminated its diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives as part of what the retail chain says is a push to distance itself from \u201cnonbusiness activities\u201d after conservative backlash from some of its customer base. In a news release Thursday, Tractor Supply, which advertises itself as the country\u2019s \u201clargest rural lifestyle retailer,\u201d said it will stop sponsoring activities like \u201cpride festivals and voting campaigns\u201d and would be cutting DEI roles and \u201cretire (its) current DEI goals while still ensuring a respectful environment.\u201d \u201cWe have heard from customers that we have disappointed them,\u201d the company said. \u201cWe have taken this feedback to heart.\u201d The about-face comes less than a month after right-wing commentator Robby Starbuck attacked the company\u2019s LGBTQ-inclusive stance and DEI hiring initiatives in a series of posts on X. Starbuck, who in 2022 launched a failed bid for Tennessee\u2019s 5th Congressional District, called on customers to boycott Tractor Supply and contact its corporate leadership. After the policy pivot was announced, Starbuck took to X again, calling the move a \u201cmassive victory\u201d and \u201cthe single biggest boycott win of our lifetime.\u201d Shaun Harper, a professor of business, public policy and education at the University of Southern California, told CNN one reason for the conservative backlash was the fact Tractor Supply failed to tailor its DEI policy to the culture in which it operates. The Brentwood, Tennessee-based company, which bills itself as the largest supporter of the National FFA Organization, a non-profit supporting agricultural education, has deep ties to rural communities across 49 states. Harper says Tractor Supply\u2019s inclusion policies should have been attuned to that specific cultural context. \u201cYou can\u2019t say you\u2019re going to try to do at Tractor Supply what they do at the Apple headquarters in Cupertino, California \u2014 that\u2019s definitely not going to work,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s what I call \u2018situated DEI.\u2019 I would say start with an emphasis on expanding opportunities for low income people, expanding access to farming for women in rural contexts, and helping people understand how more women and more people of color in the farming industry benefits everyone. And helping them understand that the diversification of the farming industry, with women and people of color doesn\u2019t necessarily have to entail a reduction and opportunities for White male farmers.\u201d Still, activists and experts say Tractor Supply\u2019s backtrack is a blow against civil rights and LGBTQ+ protections for employees and customers. \u201cHomophobia, transphobia, sexism, gender discrimination, workplace sexual harassment, ableism, size-ism and racism are not going to eliminate themselves,\u201d said Harper. \u201cIn the absence of good policy and programs within companies, the danger is that those long-standing problems are going to become exacerbated. There\u2019s going to be more conflict between and among employees, and customers who represent various diverse groups.\u201d Tractor Supply also said it would \u201cno longer submit data to the Human Rights Campaign,\u201d one of the biggest LGBTQ+ non-profit advocacy groups in the United States. It was one of more than 1,300 businesses to participate in the HRC\u2019s Corporate Equality Index, a benchmarking survey and report measuring policies and practices relating to LGBTQ+ workplace equality. In 2023, the company earned a near-perfect score of 95/100 for instating workplace protections and benefits taking LGBTQ+ employees into account, providing inclusivity training to workers, and performing outreach to the LGBTQ+ community. \u201cTractor Supply Co is turning its back on their own neighbors with this shortsighted decision,\u201d Eric Bloem, vice president of Programs and Corporate Advocacy at the Human Rights Campaign, told CNN in a statement Saturday. \u201cLGBTQ+ people live in every zip code in this country, including rural communities. We are shoppers, farmers, veterans and agriculture students. Companies from every industry work closely with us to be sure their employees and customers are respected, valued and can get the job done for their workforce and shareholders. This is why the Tractor Supply \u2014 and most of the country\u2019s biggest employers \u2014 have worked with us for years to create inclusive policies and practices. Caving to far right extremists is only going to hurt the same folks that these businesses rely on.\u201d A trend of bowing to anti-LGBTQ+ voices The policy reversal is part of a wider trend of corporate vacillation over LGBTQ+ inclusion. In the face of anti-LGBTQ backlash threatening companies\u2019 bottom line, several household brands have backed down in their support of inclusivity. Last year, Bud Light\u2019s partnership with transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney sparked an anti-trans backlash and a monthslong boycott of the beer brand, throughout which the company failed to take a firm stance in support of Mulvaney and the transgender community. The boycott and the subsequent tepid response lost parent company Anheuser-Busch InBev as much as $1.4 billion in sales, as well as its credibility with a major LGBTQ+ non-profit. Last month, retailer Target said it will limit how many stores would carry its Pride-themed collection for adults after a boycott from right-wing activists last summer led to a sharp dip in sales. While bowing to consumer backlash might seem like the safest strategy to claw back revenue lost in a boycott, it can also be shortsighted. Harper argues few companies consider the potential cost of litigation from customers and employees. \u201cSo much money gets wasted on settlements or damages for discrimination and harassment,\u201d he said. \u201cI want companies to not just think about sales, but also about the cost of litigation, as well as the reputational costs. Those are the parts that business leaders aren\u2019t thinking about as they are folding on DEI.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/29/business/tractor-supply-dei-roles-goals/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/30/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_29_politics_democratic-donors-biden-debate-election", "text": "Less than 48 hours after President Joe Biden\u2019s alarming debate performance, the Democratic donor class is in crisis, racked by anxiety over what \u2014 if anything \u2014 the party\u2019s wealthiest backers can do to reinvigorate or replace Biden, whose campaign has commissioned new polling to assess the damage. The vast universe of wealthy Biden backers and their political whisperers has split along three lines. One faction is arguing that a pressure campaign urging the president \u2014 who has been adamant he will not step aside \u2014 to drop out would be a self-defeating nonstarter. Another is calling for a middle-of-the road approach, saying party leaders should consider drastic steps only after the fallout from Thursday night is more closely examined. Democratic fundraiser and strategist Dmitri Mehlhorn, who often works closely with LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, another prominent donor, told CNN that while the first 10 or 15 minutes of the debate \u201cwas very upsetting to see,\u201d\u00a0Biden\u2019s performance later in Atlanta and then at a high-energy rally on Friday in North Carolina had begun to settle his nerves. In any event, he reasoned, Biden alone controlled his fate as the Democratic nominee. \u201cThe smartest thing is to think through how you (as influential outsiders) operate, assuming no change,\u201d Mehlhorn said. \u201cAnd if there\u2019s no change, if Biden wants to remain president, then any kind of a pressure campaign is just a waste of time and energy and effort and money.\u201d A third group of donors and advisers, with fewer direct ties to Biden world and less influence within it, is proactively calling on Democrats to quit wasting time and immediately begin the process of seeking out a new nominee with a little more than four months before a general election clash with former President Donald Trump. The would-be favorites to step in for Biden, should he reverse course and leave the race, have been careful to pledge their support to the president and, as California Gov. Gavin Newsom has done, get out-front defending him. \u201cAll this other talk \u2026 it\u2019s unhelpful and unnecessary. We aren\u2019t going to turn our backs because of one performance,\u201d Newsom said in an email to supporters on Friday. \u201cWhat kind of party does that?\u201d As the Biden campaign conducts extensive research in battleground states about the president\u2019s standing, other leading Democrats have been less inclined to circle the wagons \u2014 instead warning that the party is doomed to defeat if it does not act decisively to change the equation. Former Iowa Sen. Tom Harkin, who served alongside Biden in the Senate for decades, sought to set the tone in a pointed letter he dashed off to friends after the debate. \u201cAll incumbent Democratic Senators should write to Biden asking him to release his delegates and step aside so the convention can choose a new candidate,\u201d Harkin wrote in the letter, a copy of which was obtained by CNN. \u201cA couple of Governors may need to do the same.\u201d Harkin said there was still time for a course correction and a new Democratic ticket, which he believes \u201cwould energize the party at all levels and capture the general public\u2019s attention \u2014 many of whom would like an alternative to Trump.\u201d \u201cThis is a perilous time and is more important than Joe Biden\u2019s ego,\u201d Harkin wrote, \u201cor desire to stay president.\u201d There does seem to be agreement among all sides over one thing: Ultimately, the decision will be Biden\u2019s to make. There is no appetite for a clash at the Democratic National Convention this summer in Chicago \u2014 partly because there is no clear apparatus for pushing Biden aside, but mostly due to concerns that a floor fight, no matter the outcome, would do more harm than good. \u201cThe party is in President Biden\u2019s hands \u2014 for better or worse,\u201d a Democratic senator told CNN, speaking on condition of anonymity to avoid disrespecting the president or alienating the campaign. \u201cHe deserves our respect and space to reach any decision.\u201d The absence of an heir apparent to Biden who could satisfy the party\u2019s perpetually warring factions while quickly bringing together competing donor networks is another significant hurdle for those pushing for immediate action. \u201cA true succession plan does not exist,\u201d a senior Democratic adviser to the Biden campaign told CNN on Saturday. \u201cThat\u2019s what makes all of this not just heartbreaking, but very problematic.\u201d Democrats are conducting new polls and research, throughout the weekend and into early next week, in an effort to gain a better understanding of the political fallout, particularly in key contests that will determine whether the party can win back its House majority and maintain its narrow control of the Senate. A second longtime adviser said the only way Biden would even consider stepping aside \u2014 a move that is still very much an open question \u2014 is if he was presented serious data showing that he would not only likely lose his reelection bid, but also endanger down-ballot candidates in House, Senate and competitive local races across the country. The Biden campaign has long had polling that found Democrats would still support those candidates even if they didn\u2019t vote for Biden. If the president\u2019s debate setback would make some of these voters far less inclined to vote at all \u2014 handing a turnout advantage to Trump and Republicans \u2014 Biden could be confronted with a starker decision. Without that information, for now, the most prominent national Democrats, led by former President Barack Obama, are asking party donors to keep the faith. For years, the relationship between Obama and Biden and their circle of advisers was strained by Obama\u2019s decision to support Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential bid in 2015 and urge Biden not to run. This moment \u201cis even more fraught,\u201d one longtime Obama adviser said Saturday, noting that Biden would have to ultimately reach \u201cany decision about his next steps on his own.\u201d At a fundraiser for House Democrats on New York City\u2019s Upper West Side late Friday, Obama did not take questions from donors in the audience as he spoke with House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries in what Florida Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, who was in attendance, told CNN was more like a \u201cfireside chat.\u201d The former president, as he did in a social media post earlier in the day, recounted to attendees his own dismal debate experience from 2012, repeated a message about the stark contrast between the two presidential candidates and said Biden\u2019s values \u201creflect the best in America.\u201d Asked about the debate by Jeffries, Obama pivoted to a more expansive view of the situation. \u201cAn appropriate message for\u00a0this evening\u00a0is that this is a team sport. The president is captain, and we need the White House, because of the enormous power of the executive branch,\u201d Obama said. \u201cBut the critical need for us to regain the House and have Hakeem Jeffries as speaker should be sufficient motivation. And if we do our jobs on that front, that is probably the most important thing we can do for the Biden reelection campaign as well.\u201d But signs \u2014 literally \u2014 of dissent have been more prominent outside the fundraising circuit. When Biden arrived at hedge fund manager Barry Goldstein\u2019s event in East Hampton, New York, on Saturday, his motorcade passed a group of people holding signs appealing for the president to drop out. \u201cWe love you,\u201d one said, \u201cbut it\u2019s time.\u201d Once inside, Biden acknowledged the angst among the donors. \u201cI understand the concern about the debate \u2014 I get it,\u201d the president said. \u201cI didn\u2019t have a great night.\u201d But he also pushed back against the some of the concerns voiced in recent reports. \u201cVoters had a different reaction,\u201d Biden said, claiming that post-debate polling showed little movement except for some figures that \u201cmoved us up, actually.\u201d Goldstein told CNN more than 200 people were expected at the event, which brought in additional donations the Friday morning after the debate. Actors Sarah Jessica Parker and Matthew Broderick were among the hosts, and former Trump communications director Anthony Scaramucci was also on hand. As he made his swing through the Hamptons, Biden was accompanied by Jeffrey Katzenberg, the Hollywood mogul serving as a co-chair of his campaign.\u00a0Biden\u2019s team has tried to point to some fundraising bright spots in the days after the debate, saying the campaign brought in more than $27 million during a two-day period. Biden will be in New Jersey on Saturday night for another fundraiser, this one hosted by wealthy New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy, a former Democratic National Committee finance chair. Those gatherings follow the mixed reviews that emerged from a Friday night event in New York City attended by Biden and headlined by rock \u2018n\u2019 roll legend Elton John. \u201cThe vibe in the room was completely bizarre,\u201d said a Democratic strategist who attended the event. \u201cYou\u2019re having fun and the drinks are flowing, and Elton John was there \u2014 but you\u2019re waiting for the gaffe, you\u2019re waiting for the slip \u2014 magnified by the terror of the night before.\u201d Another donor in the room, Charles Myers, told CNN the panicky narrative around a donor exodus from Biden\u2019s campaign was \u201cfrustrating\u201d and \u201cnot what\u2019s happening.\u201d \u201cYes, donors were nervous after the very bad debate performance,\u201d Myers said, \u201cbut still very much on board and some want to do more.\u201d The gathering in the East Village, he added, saw Biden in \u201cgreat form,\u201d and he had a \u201cgeneral sense\u201d that while the debate \u201cwas really bad \u2026 the campaign is doing a course correction and all of us want to double the effort to help with that turnaround.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s time to do polling and find out if there are any potential replacements that poll higher than Trump,\u201d billionaire businessman\u00a0Mark Cuban, who recently came out in support of Biden, told\u00a0CNN.\u00a0Trump is politically weak, Cuban said, so a Democrat who could\u00a0\u201cstep in and immediately change the race\u201d would be \u201cworth considering.\u201d For now, though, Cuban\u00a0\u2014 who said he is not a donor to the Biden campaign but did attend a fundraiser in March to show his support \u2014\u00a0made clear the task of replacing Biden this late in the cycle would be uniquely challenging. The former majority owner of the Dallas Mavericks basketball team, who previously supported former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley in the GOP primary, used a sports analogy:\u00a0\u201cAt this point, it\u2019s more like discussing an NBA or NFL game after the fact and wanting to trade players,\u201d Cuban said. Hoffman offered a variation on that theme in a Friday night email to friends \u2014 some of whom, he wrote, had been asking him \u201cwhether there should be a public campaign to pressure President Biden to step aside after his (very) bad debate performance last night.\u201d \u201cI think such a campaign to get Biden to step down would be a bad idea,\u201d Hoffman wrote, arguing that such steps might harden Biden\u2019s resolve to prove his doubters wrong. He also pointed to the president\u2019s lively performance at the rally in Virginia and to the way Republicans reacted following Trump\u2019s felony conviction last month. \u201cThey ruthlessly and immediately closed ranks,\u201d Hoffman wrote, \u201cbecause they understand that at this stage of the race, they must spend every minute and dime either boosting their old man, or tearing down ours.\u201d Another Democratic donor was more blunt about the state of play and the party\u2019s choices. \u201cI don\u2019t think (Biden) is going anywhere,\u201d the donor told CNN. \u201cThis is the old horse we\u2019ve got, and we need to ride him \u2018til he\u2019s ready for the glue factory.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/29/politics/democratic-donors-biden-debate-election/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/30/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_28_politics_trump-new-jersey-golf-club-liquor-license", "text": "New Jersey regulators have scheduled a July 19 hearing to decide on the liquor license renewals for two of former President Donald Trump\u2019s golf clubs in the wake of his felony conviction in New York. A New Jersey\u00a0law\u00a0prohibits anyone who was convicted of a crime \u201cinvolving moral turpitude\u201d from holding a liquor license, according to a spokesperson from the New Jersey attorney general\u2019s office. In May, Trump was\u00a0found guilty of 34 counts of falsifying business records\u00a0in a New York court \u2014 in an unprecedented criminal trial that made him the first former US president to be convicted of a felony. Prosecutors said he falsified records to conceal a payment made to an adult film actress to keep her from speaking out about an alleged affair with Trump before the 2016 election. Trump has denied the affair. New Jersey regulators will hold the hearing \u2014 which comes after the presumptive Republican nominee is set to be sentenced in New York on July 11 \u2014 and determine whether the liquor licenses at the golf courses in Colts Neck and Bedminster can be legally renewed. \u201cA review by ABC [Alcohol Beverage Control]\u00a0indicates that Mr. Trump maintains a direct beneficial interest in the three liquor licenses through the receipt of revenues and profits from them, as the sole beneficiary of the Donald J. Trump Revocable Trust,\u201d the spokesperson from the attorney general\u2019s office said. A spokesperson for the Trump Organization called the hearing \u201cunwarranted and unjustified.\u201d \u201cAs previously stated, President Trump is not the holder of any liquor license in New Jersey, and he is not an officer, director or operator of any entity that holds a liquor license in New Jersey,\u201d a statement obtained by CNN on Saturday reads. \u201cWe sincerely hope that this investigation is not political in nature, and given the foregoing, we feel confident that our licenses will remain unaffected,\u201d the statement said. The liquor licenses at the Colts Neck and Bedminster golf courses expire Sunday, and until the hearing, the clubs will be allowed to sell liquor under a state-issued temporary 90-day permit, according to the attorney general\u2019s office spokesperson. \u201cDuring such a hearing, the applicant bears the burden of proof to demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that they remain qualified to maintain licensure, which includes a review of any beneficiaries of the licenses,\u201d they said. The liquor license for Trump\u2019s third New Jersey golf course in Pine Hill was renewed on June 3, the spokesperson said. \u201cABC declines further comment on the status of that license pending the outcome of the hearing set for the Colts Neck and Lamington Farm Club licenses,\u201d the spokesperson said. This story has been updated with additional details.

{"id": "2024_06_26_us_trails-carolina-camp-death-update-homicide", "text": "A boy from New York journeyed to North Carolina for camp but did not survive his first night, authorities said.\u00a0Now, his death is being investigated as a homicide. Hours after arriving at Trails Carolina, a program for adolescents with behavioral or emotional issues, the 12-year-old suffocated in February after camp staff directed him to sleep in a fully enclosed bivy sack, a newly released autopsy report states. A bivy sack is a piece of sleeping equipment that usually includes waterproof material. \u201cThe cause of death is asphyxia due to smothering,\u201d the autopsy report says. \u201cThe manner of death is homicide.\u201d The boy\u2019s family, who lives in New York, has asked CNN not to publicize the boy\u2019s name. The family declined to comment further, family representative Robert J. Higdon Jr. said. The Transylvania County Sheriff\u2019s Office said it is investigating the death. While no arrests have been made, investigators do have suspects, Det. John C. Nicholson told CNN on Wednesday. The sheriff\u2019s detective declined to answer additional questions, citing the ongoing investigation. CNN has reached out to Trails Carolina for comment. While North Carolina authorities have started the process to permanently revoke the nature camp\u2019s license, Trails Carolina could still appeal. Confined in a bivy enclosed with an alarm A bivy sack gives more protection than a sleeping bag alone, often eliminating the need to sleep in a tent when camping. Bivies typically include a breathable inner layer that can be zipped and an opaque, waterproof outer layer. \u201cIt should be noted that a common warning on commercially available bivy products indicates that the outer, weather resistant opening should not be fully secured as it may lead to condensation and breathing restriction,\u201d the boy\u2019s autopsy report states. \u201cThis information was obtained on basic web search.\u201d During the overnight hours between February 2 and 3, the boy was directed to sleep in a fully enclosed bivy with an attached alarm that would alert counselors if the boy tried to leave, the autopsy report states. The child had previously left his bivy sack to sleep outside of it. The counselors woke him and made him re-enter the bivy. According to the camp\u2019s protocol, the boy \u201cwas placed to sleep in a bivy (small camping enclosure) with a sleeping mat and sleeping bag,\u201d the autopsy report states. \u201cThe program\u2019s protocol required the bivy to be placed on top of a thick mil plastic sheet which was folded up the sides in the form of a \u2018canoe\u2019. The opening to the bivy was then secured with an alarm device such that if the occupant attempted to exit the bivy, it would alarm and wake up the counselors in the cabin,\u201d the autopsy report says. \u201cAccording to investigative reports, the internal mesh bivy door, which is normally used to secure the opening, was torn and the outer weather resistant door was instead (used) to secure the opening with the alarm device.\u201d During the overnight hours, a counselor noticed the boy was moving around \u201cbut stopped moving shortly after,\u201d the autopsy report states. \u201cRoutine checks were performed throughout the night, but due to the outer, opaque layer of the bivy being closed, he could not be visualized,\u201d the report says. \u201cIn the morning, the counselors attempted to wake him up but noted he was not moving.\u201d Trails Carolina released multiple statements in the days following the boy\u2019s death. \u201cWe are shattered by the tragic loss of a young life and our deepest sympathies are with the student\u2019s family and loved ones,\u201d the camp said in a February 6 statement. Two days later, the camp issued another statement in response to the sheriff\u2019s office\u2019s initial findings, which said the boy\u2019s death \u201cappeared suspicious\u201d and claimed the camp was not cooperating with the investigation. \u201cTrails has conducted an internal investigation of this incident and the Trails facility has been investigated by outside professionals who are subject-matter experts,\u201d the camp said February 8. \u201cBoth investigations have concluded that there is no evidence that Trails failed to properly supervise, no evidence that Trails caused harm, and no evidence that conditions at Trails were unsafe or unhealthy.\u201d \u201cOur staff have fully cooperated with the local law enforcement\u2019s investigation,\u201d the statement continued. \u201cAny assertion to the contrary is false, reckless, and defamatory.\u201d Trails Carolina has not given an updated statement to CNN after repeated requests for comment this week. The camp is shut down for now Trails Carolina is an \u201coutcome-driven nature-based therapy program in Lake Toxaway, North Carolina,\u201d the camp said in its February 6 statement. \u201cThe program helps adolescents, aged 10-17-years-old, work through behavioral or emotional difficulties, build trusting relationships with their family and peers, and achieve academic success.\u201d The camp \u201cpairs psychological counseling with a variety of outdoor activities, including hiking, backpacking, camping, rock climbing and equine-assisted emotional work,\u201d Trails Carolina said. Following the boy\u2019s death and an investigation into the camp, the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services started the process of revoking Trails Carolina\u2019s license, according to documents obtained by CNN. \u201cThey cannot operate at this time,\u201d agency spokesperson Kelly Haight Connor said Tuesday. On February 12, the DHHS sent a letter to Trails Carolina ordering the camp to halt new admissions and stop using \u201cbivy bags for any purpose\u201d until an investigation is complete. On March 28, the DHHS sent a letter ordering Trails Carolina to suspend admissions because \u201cconditions in the facility are found to be detrimental to the health and safety of the clients.\u201d The letter cited violations involving medication requirements, incident response requirements and protection from harm, abuse, neglect or exploitation. And on May 17, the DHHS sent a letter to Trails Carolina saying it was starting the process to revoke its license. But Trails Carolina has 60 days \u2013 or until mid-July \u2013 to appeal the revocation of its license. As of Tuesday, the DHHS was not aware of any appeals filed, the agency\u2019s spokesperson said. CNN\u2019s Eva Roytburg contributed to this report.

{"id": "2024_06_29_us_conservatives-14th-amendment-challenge-race-based-programs", "text": "The Supreme Court\u2019s decision to\u00a0gut affirmative action\u00a0in college admissions one year ago has opened the door for numerous legal challenges against race-based grant programs, internships and scholarships across the country. Many of those lawsuits are being filed by conservative groups who insist that it\u2019s unconstitutional to design and operate a program exclusively for a certain racial group. They argue that the programs\u00a0particularly disadvantage White\u00a0and Asian\u00a0Americans, by preventing them from obtaining the jobs, funding or opportunities that these programs offer to\u00a0other racial groups. Some lawsuits invoke the Equal Protection Clause of the\u00a014th\u00a0amendment\u00a0which was ratified after slavery was abolished and says no state may \u201cdeny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\u201d The amendment was notably cited in Justice Clarence Thomas\u2019\u00a0concurring opinion\u00a0in the landmark affirmative action ruling,\u00a0who described it as a \u201ccrowning accomplishment\u201d of Congress. Thomas\u00a0argued that the 14th\u00a0Amendment \u201censures racial equality with no textual reference to race whatsoever.\u201d \u201cIn the wake of the Civil War, the Framers of the Fourteenth Amendment charted a way out: a colorblind Constitution that requires the government to, at long last, put aside its citizens\u2019 skin color and focus on their individual achievements,\u201d he wrote. But some historians argue that the history of centuries of slavery and racism that ultimately led to the ratification of the 14thamendment is often lost in the conversations around\u00a0affirmative action. The amendment, they say, was never intended to be colorblind. Why was the 14th amendment passed? The 14th\u00a0amendment was ratified on July 9, 1868, to grant citizenship and equal protection of the law to anyone\u00a0\u201cborn\u00a0or naturalized\u00a0in the United States,\u201d\u00a0including formerly enslaved Black people. At the time, the passage of the amendment was necessary because millions of Black people were newly freed and their legal and civil rights had not been established. Eric\u00a0Foner,\u00a0a\u00a0historian and professor at Columbia University who specializes in the\u00a0Civil War, Reconstruction and slavery, said the 14th amendment enabled Black people to legally enjoy freedoms such as getting an education, owning land and riding street cars. Foner\u00a0also said the amendment was created to ensure that programs specifically for newly freed Black Americans were able to continue. One example, he said, was the\u00a0Freedman\u2019s Bureau, which was established in 1865 to provide aid such as food, clothing and medical services to formerly enslaved people. \u201cCertainly, this notion of equal protection of the law was both a general principal applied to everybody and a particular justification for assistance to Black people,\u201d\u00a0Foner\u00a0said. \u201cYou have to look at the broad historical context.\u201d But even after the amendment was ratified,\u00a0Jim\u00a0Crow\u00a0laws, segregation and racial violence prevented Black Americans from gaining equality. Some racial disparities persist today and now, more\u00a0than\u00a0150 years later, the same amendment that paved the way for programs that help many Black people is being used\u00a0as justification\u00a0to\u00a0dismantle them. How is it being interpreted in today\u2019s legal challenges? The 14th\u00a0amendment has been cited in several lawsuits filed by conservative groups challenging the constitutionality of programs specifically for people of color. Some of these legal challenges\u00a0successfully forced\u00a0defendants to open their programs to people of all races, either voluntarily or\u00a0through a court order. Earlier this year, legal strategist Edward Blum,\u00a0through his legal advocacy group the American Alliance for Equal Rights,\u00a0sued\u00a0the\u00a0director of the Smithsonian\u2019s National Museum of the American Latino and the director of the Institute of Museum and Library Services over an\u00a0internship program that was open only to Latino applicants,\u00a0saying it\u00a0violated the\u00a0US\u00a0Constitution. The\u00a0complaint\u00a0cited both the 14th\u00a0amendment and\u00a0the\u00a0Fifth\u00a0amendment while arguing that the internship program violated the right of\u00a0\u201cAmericans, like Plaintiff\u2019s members,\u201d to equal protection under\u00a0the law. When asked for comment about the settlement,\u00a0David Coronado, a spokesperson for the National Museum of the American Latino said in an email to CNN,\u00a0said the museum has now added language\u00a0to the program\u2019s website and scoring rubric\u00a0that\u00a0\u201cspells out what had been our practice already,\u201d\u00a0CNN previously reported. \u201cThe National Museum of the American Latino reaffirmed its longstanding commitment to equal opportunity for all internship applicants, regardless of race or ethnicity,\u201d Coronado said.\u00a0 In a statement to CNN this week, Blum said the 14th\u00a0amendment\u2019s equal protection clause \u201chas been interpreted to mean that individual Americans should never be treated differently because of their race.\u201d Blum said, in his view, \u201cany program or policy such as college admissions, fellowships, internships, grants, financial aid and employment that excludes someone because of their race is usually in violation of the 14th\u00a0Amendment.\u201d The\u00a0museum\u00a0settled with Blum\u00a0in March\u00a0and\u00a0now states\u00a0its internship program\u00a0is \u201cequally open\u00a0to students of all races and ethnicities.\u201d The 14th\u00a0amendment was also invoked in a\u00a0recent lawsuit\u00a0filed by\u00a0the conservative group\u00a0Judicial Watch against the city of Evanston, Illinois over a reparations program for Black residents\u00a0meant to correct past discriminatory housing practices.\u00a0Under the program, Black residents who lived in the city between 1919 and 1969 \u2013 as well as their direct descendants \u2013 can apply for up to $25,000 in housing assistance or a direct cash payment,\u00a0CNN previously reported. But\u00a0the lawsuit,\u00a0filed on behalf of six people whose parents or grandparents lived in Evanston during the outlined time period but do not identify as Black,\u00a0argues that solely limiting the cash payment to eligible Black Americans \u201cviolates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution\u201d because \u201cEvanston is discriminating against each member on the basis of the member\u2019s race.\u201d Tom Fitton, president of Judicial Watch, said the reparations program is a \u201cbrazen violation\u201d of the 14th\u00a0amendment. \u201cYou get equal protection of the law under our constitution irrespective of your race,\u201d Fitton told CNN in an interview earlier this month. \u201cThere are no exceptions for denying people equal protection of the law.\u201d Why are there clashing interpretations? David Blight, a history and African American studies professor at Yale University, said he believes the 14th\u00a0amendment was written in a way that leaves it open to different interpretations. Blight said while it was initially ratified to help formerly enslaved Black people,\u00a0the language in the amendment is vague. It\u2019s also unclear how it should be enforced, Blight said. This has allowed conservatives today to use it to their advantage in legal challenges against race-based programs, he said. \u201cThe 14th\u00a0amendment is, without any question, malleable,\u201d Blight said. \u201cIt can be twisted and used all kinds of ways and that\u2019s what has happened with affirmative action.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/29/us/conservatives-14th-amendment-challenge-race-based-programs/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/30/2024", "section": "us"}}

{"id": "2024_06_27_us_karen-read-john-okeefe-what-we-know", "text": "The closely watched murder trial of Karen Read is nearing its end as Massachusetts jurors deliberate her fate while her supporters rally in her defense outside court. So how did we get here? Read, 45, has pleaded not guilty to charges of second-degree murder, vehicular manslaughter while intoxicated, and leaving the scene of a collision resulting in death. The case stems from the death of her boyfriend, Boston Police Officer John O\u2019Keefe, whose body was found bruised and battered in the snow on January 29, 2022, outside the home of a fellow Boston police officer in the suburb of Canton. The trial began in April and has garnered interest as it featured accusations of a police cover-up, sexist and offensive texts from the lead investigator, a federal probe into the investigation, and groups of pink-wearing supporters chanting to \u201cFree Karen Read.\u201d Here\u2019s a review of what we know about the case. The death of John O\u2019Keefe The heart of the trial stems from what happened on one wintry evening in Canton over two years ago. On the night of January 28, 2022, Read and O\u2019Keefe went out drinking at two bars with friends. Shortly after midnight, the couple climbed into Read\u2019s SUV and drove to the home of O\u2019Keefe\u2019s colleague on Fairview Road for an after-party, court documents show. O\u2019Keefe got out of the vehicle, and Read drove home. Early the next morning, she drove around in a snowstorm to look for him and found his body in the front yard of the Canton house, according to court documents. What exactly happened to O\u2019Keefe between getting out of the vehicle and when he was found the next morning? The prosecution has alleged the couple got into an argument that led O\u2019Keefe to get out of the vehicle, but he never made it inside the house. A drunken Read allegedly struck him with the vehicle while driving in reverse and then fled, leaving him to die in the snowy cold, prosecutors say. Firefighters who responded to the scene that morning asked about his injuries, and Read told them, \u201cI hit him, I hit him,\u201d according to their testimony. People at the house that night testified O\u2019Keefe never came inside. In addition, Read\u2019s vehicle had a broken taillight, and pieces of the taillight were found outside the Canton home, prosecutors said. Data from the vehicle\u2019s internal system also indicated she reversed at a rapid speed, according to testimony. \u201cWhat the constellation of the facts and the evidence ineluctably demonstrate here is that the defendant drove her vehicle in reverse at 24.2 miles per hour for 62.5 feet, struck Mr. O\u2019Keefe, causing those catastrophic head injuries, leaving him incapacitated and freezing him to death,\u201d prosecutor Adam Lally said in closing arguments Tuesday. However, Read has said she dropped off O\u2019Keefe at the house and then drove to his home because she wasn\u2019t feeling well, according to court documents. Her defense has accused\u00a0off-duty police inside that Canton home of killing O\u2019Keefe and framing Read. The defense has theorized O\u2019Keefe was beaten in the home and mauled by the homeowners\u2019 German shepherd, Chloe, and then tossed out in the snow to die. The police then conspired to fabricate evidence and lie under oath to protect their own, the defense alleged. \u201cLadies and gentlemen, there was a cover-up in this case, plain and simple,\u201d defense attorney Alan Jackson said. \u201cYou\u2019ll surely say to yourself, \u2018I don\u2019t want to believe it, I don\u2019t want to believe that could happen in our community,\u2019 but sadly over these past eight weeks you\u2019ve seen it right before your eyes.\u201d Lead investigator apologizes for offensive texts The prosecution\u2019s case also has been hampered by a series of missteps and unusual investigative practices. Most notably, a lead investigator in the case, Massachusetts State Police Trooper Michael Proctor, admitted that he sent a series of sexist and offensive texts about Read in a private group chat, calling her a \u201cwhack job,\u201d mocking her medical issues and commenting to coworkers that he had found \u201cno nudes\u201d while searching her phone for evidence,\u00a0CNN affiliate WCVB reported. Proctor apologized on the stand for the \u201cunprofessional\u201d comments, but the vulgar texts have been sharply criticized in and out of court, including from the governor. \u201cIt\u2019s completely unprofessional,\u201d Gov.\u00a0Maura Healey told WCVB of the texts. \u201cIt does harm, frankly, to the dignity and the integrity of the work of men and women across the state police and law enforcement. So as a former attorney general and as governor, I am disgusted by that.\u201d At closing arguments, the prosecution condemned the texts as \u201cunprofessional, indefensible, (and) inexcusable\u201d but said they had no impact on the integrity of the investigation. The defense disagreed. \u201cThey cannot distance themselves from the stench of him on this case and this investigation. Those secret group chats illustrate the quality and care of this investigation,\u201d Jackson said. The US Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of Massachusetts has launched a federal probe into Read\u2019s arrest and prosecution. And in March, the Massachusetts State Police announced an\u00a0investigation into Proctor for potential policy violations. The prosecution has presented evidence that Read and O\u2019Keefe had a volatile relationship. O\u2019Keefe\u2019s niece and nephew said they heard the couple yelling in arguments prior to his death, and an ATF agent testified about his romantic kiss and text messages with Read, according to\u00a0WCVB. Further, in the minutes after prosecutors say she hit him with the SUV, she called his phone and left a voicemail yelling, \u201cJohn, I f**king hate you!\u201d The defense has sharply questioned witnesses about whether Read truly confessed to hitting him with her vehicle and has challenged investigators about the quality of their work. For example, investigators used red plastic cups to collect evidence from the scene, and surveillance video of Read\u2019s vehicle was inexplicably flipped to a mirror image, WCVB reported. \u201cLie, obfuscate, manipulate, alter, and when they\u2019re caught, they just excuse it away,\u201d Jackson said in closing arguments. \u201cThat\u2019s not sloppiness,\u201d he added. \u201cThat\u2019s evidence manipulation.\u201d But prosecutors have rejected those theories as nothing more than speculation. \u201cThere is no conspiracy, there is no cover-up, there is no evidence of any of that beyond speculation, rampant speculation and conjecture on behalf of the defense,\u201d Lally said in closing arguments. The case has divided a small town The accusations of a cover-up and high stakes of the trial have spilled over to local residents and divided the town. Aidan Kearney, a Massachusetts blogger nicknamed Turtleboy, has fed the ongoing debate with numerous posts alleging a cover-up by law enforcement and local politicians. In October, he pleaded not guilty to charges of witness intimidation and conspiracy, CNN affiliate WBZ reported, after he allegedly called and sent messages to witnesses and investigators in Read\u2019s case. Near the courthouse, dozens of people have gathered daily to support Read and offered their approval of her defense\u2019s accusations that she was framed. Wearing pink in solidarity, they have held signs reading \u201cFree Karen Read\u201d and waved American flags. Police have set up a buffer zone to keep them from being too close to the courthouse. Rita Lombardi, a local Read supporter outside the court, told CNN on Thursday she got into the case by following Turtleboy\u2019s work. \u201cThe information in the court filings didn\u2019t add up,\u201d she said. \u201cThis woman was framed, and there is overwhelming evidence, overwhelming scientific evidence that she was framed for murder by the very people we trust to protect us.\u201d \u201cWe are not protesters, we are supporters,\u201d she added. \u201cWe bring love, we bring joy, we bring hope, compassion.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/27/us/karen-read-john-okeefe-what-we-know/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/30/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_27_us_west-virginia-adopted-black-children-slaves-reaj", "text": "Two West Virginia parents are awaiting trial on more than a dozen charges after adopting four Black children and allegedly using them for \u201cforced labor\u201d on their farm, court documents show. Jeanne Whitefeather, 62 and Donald Lantz, 63, who are both White, have been charged with human trafficking of children, civil rights violations, use of a minor child in forced labor and child neglect, according to the 17-count indictment. Madison Tuck, assistant prosecuting attorney for Kanawha County, West Virginia, told CNN Wednesday that the trial is set to begin on September 9. Tuck said the children are \u201call safe\u201d but declined to give further details about their location. Lantz and Whitefeather entered not guilty pleas during a June 11 arraignment. Mark Plants, an attorney representing Whitefeather, told CNN Thursday that his client \u201cabsolutely, emphatically (denies) the allegations.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re talking about two parents who adopted five Black children, has cared for them for the last eight years, and this is going to come out at trial. And we\u2019ll let the jury decide at the end of the day. But we absolutely, emphatically deny the allegations.\u201d Lantz\u2019s attorney did not immediately return requests for comment. During the arraignment, Thirteenth Judicial Circuit Judge Maryclaire Akers said, \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen an indictment like this in all of my time.\u201d Akers, referencing the indictment, said it alleges the children were \u201ctargeted because of their race\u201d to be used \u201cas basically slaves.\u201d CNN has obtained court documents related to the case, which began in October 2023 when Kanawha County Sheriff\u2019s deputies responded to a 911 call raising concerns about the children. CNN requested a copy of the 911 call, but authorities declined to release it.  The 911 caller reported the children were \u201cmade to do farm work\u201d and \u201cnot allowed inside the house,\u201d according to a sworn statement from the deputy who responded to the call. A news release from the sheriff\u2019s office noted that \u201cdeputies had to force entry into the barn where they located a juvenile male and juvenile female locked inside an approximate 20x14 foot room.\u201d \u201cThe children had no means to exit the barn on their own, no running water, no bathroom facilities, and were obviously deprived of adequate hygienic care and food,\u201d the release said. According to the deputy\u2019s sworn statement, \u201cthe female juvenile also stated she and her 14-year-old brother were not allowed inside the house.\u201d \u201cThere were no accessible windows in the room or way for the children to exit. If there were a medical emergency or fire, the children would be unable to exit the locked room to safety,\u201d the statement said.  When Whitefeather and Lantz arrived hours later, the deputy wrote, \u201cMs. Whitefeather made the admission to Det. Alford that the children were left in the shed but stated they \u2018like it.\u2019\u201d An affidavit from a lieutenant in the sheriff\u2019s office indicated that the police encounter in October 2023 was preceded by two other concerned 911 calls about the wellbeing of the children. Both callers, in May and June 2023, told dispatchers that children living there were \u201csleeping in the barn\u201d and using a portable toilet outside, according to the affidavit. Both times, Whitefeather and Lantz claimed to responding deputies that they had just moved to the site from Washington State and were using the portable toilet due to plumbing issues in their new home, the statement said. \u201cMs. Whitefeather told the deputies that people in the area don\u2019t like them, and vehicles had been stopping on the roadway in front of their residence,\u201d the lieutenant wrote of the June 2023 encounter. \u201cThis call was cleared with \u2018no police action necessary.\u2019\u201d A grand jury returned an indictment against Whitefeather and Lantz in May that allege, among other things, that the couple did \u201cknowingly, feloniously, and willfully traffic a minor,\u201d and \u201cdid recruit, entice, and obtain the victim of the offense from a shelter and facility that serves runaway youths, children in foster care, the homeless and victims of human trafficking, domestic violence and sexual assault.\u201d The pair are each being held on $500,000 \u201ccash-only\u201d bonds, according to an arraignment order.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/27/us/west-virginia-adopted-black-children-slaves-reaj/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/30/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_28_politics_election-biden-presidential-race-what-matters", "text": "Joe Biden\u2019s spotty debate performance immediately triggered new questions from worried Democrats about whether he would leave the presidential race. It would not be an easy process since Biden is already the Democrats\u2019 presumptive nominee and the overwhelming choice of primary voters. He faced little opposition during the primary season, and the fact that he won nearly all of the party\u2019s delegates means it\u2019s very unlikely he\u2019d be forced out of the race against his will. \u201cThis isn\u2019t the \u201960s. Voters choose the nominee. He is the nominee,\u201d said CNN analyst and Democratic strategist David Axelrod, reacting to Biden\u2019s performance at the debate Thursday night on CNN. That current primary system, which empowers primary voters over party bigwigs, essentially sprang from discontent after Democrats selected Vice President Hubert Humphrey as their nominee in 1968. Even after President Lyndon Johnson bowed out of the presidential race that year, recognizing his fading popularity and opposition to the war in Vietnam, Humphrey represented a continuation of Johnson\u2019s Vietnam policy at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago. Violence broke out when protesters clashed with police as Humphrey accepted the nomination. Things would be very different in 2024 if Biden decided to leave the race, although Democrats\u2019 convention will return to Chicago in August. As we\u00a0first wrote\u00a0back in February,\u00a0if the leading candidate was to drop out of the campaign after most primaries or even during the convention, individual delegates would need to select the party\u2019s nominee on the convention floor (or, potentially, during a\u00a0virtual roll call). That would shine a spotlight on the normally niche question of who those actual delegates are. The Democratic Party set a deadline of June 22 for states to select the more than 3,900 delegates \u2013\u00a0almost all of them currently pledged to Biden \u2013 allocated as part of the primary process. These delegates aren\u2019t just pledged to vote for Biden; they\u2019re also approved by his campaign. So while a majority of convention delegates could\u00a0decide to pick a new nominee, doing so would require massive defections from the president\u2019s own supporters. It also means that if Biden dropped out of the race, it would largely be Biden backers who would be responsible for picking his replacement. Who could replace Biden? You can assume, for instance, that Vice President Kamala Harris would be a top contender to be on the ballot in such a scenario. But there would be other potential candidates who previously argued they could run a more effective campaign against former President Donald Trump. Would someone like California Gov. Gavin Newsom \u2013\u00a0who offered unqualified support for Biden in the wake of Thursday\u2019s debate \u2013\u00a0challenge Harris at the convention? Settling on a replacement could be divisive and ugly. It would be up to the delegates to decide, in a series of votes after frantic lobbying, who to pick. On the Democratic side, there is also another group to consider: the\u00a0\u201csuperdelegates,\u201d\u00a0a group of about 700 senior party leaders and elected officials who are automatically delegates to the convention based on their position. Under normal party rules, they can\u2019t vote on the first ballot if they could swing the nomination, but they\u2019re free to vote on subsequent ballots. What if a candidate left the race after the convention? It would take a drastic event for a candidate to leave the race in the few months between a party\u2019s nominating convention in the summer and the general election in November. Democrats and Republicans have slightly different methods of dealing with this possibility. You can imagine the end result would probably be that the running mate stepped up to be on the general election ballot, but that is not necessarily guaranteed. Democrats \u2013\u00a0The Democratic National Committee is empowered to fill a vacancy on the national ticket after the convention under party rules, after the party chair consults with Democratic governors and congressional leadership. Republicans \u2013\u00a0If a vacancy occurs on the Republican side, the Republican National Committee can either reconvene the national convention or select a new candidate itself. Would the running mate automatically become the nominee? An in-depth\u00a0Congressional Research Service\u00a0memo also notes that if an incumbent president becomes incapacitated after winning the party\u2019s nomination, the 25th Amendment would elevate the vice president to the presidency, but party rules would determine who rises to become the party\u2019s nominee. Neither party, according to the CRS, requires that the presidential candidate\u2019s running mate be elevated to the top of the ticket, though that would obviously be the most likely scenario. Has a candidate ever left the race after the convention? In modern times, per the CRS, the Democrat running for vice president in 1972, Sen.\u00a0Thomas Eagleton, was forced to step aside after the convention after it was discovered that he was treated for mental illness. (1972 was a very different time! Today, thankfully, there is not nearly the stigma attached to mental health.) The DNC actually needed to convene a meeting to affirm Sargent Shriver as Democratic nominee George McGovern\u2019s second-choice running mate. What if a president-elect was incapacitated after the election? If a president-elect was to die, timing is again important. Under the Constitution, it is electors meeting in state capitols who technically cast votes for the presidency. While some states require that they vote for the winner of the election in their state, in others they have leeway. The CRS memo, which cites several congressional hearings on the subject, suggests it would clearly make sense for a vice president-elect to simply assume the role of president-elect, but the law itself is murky. Under the 20th Amendment, if a president-elect dies, his or her running mate, the vice president-elect, becomes president. There could be some question, for instance, about when exactly a person becomes president-elect. Is it after the electors meet in December, or after Congress meets to count Electoral College votes on January 6?", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/28/politics/election-biden-presidential-race-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/30/2024", "section": "us"}}

The Recording Industry Association of America \u2013 the trade group on behalf of labels including Sony Music Entertainment, UMG Recordings and Warner Records \u2013 filed two copyright infringement cases against AI companies Suno and Uncharted Labs, the developer behind Udio, for training their AI models with the labels\u2019 unlicensed sound recordings. Udio is the company behind \u201cBBL Drizzy,\u201d the AI-generated song that went viral last month during the Kendrick Lamar and Drake spat. Udio was founded last year by former Google DeepMind researchers to make it \u201ceasy for anyone to create emotionally resonant music in an instant,\u201d according to the company. In April, it raised $10 million in funding. Meanwhile, Suno raised $125 million in funding last month. The platform, which allows users to create songs with only a few prompts, relies on OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT for lyrics and title development. Udio and Suno did not immediately respond to a request for comment. RIAA CEO Mitch Glazier said in a statement that the lawsuits are \u201cnecessary to reinforce the most basic rules of the road for the responsible, ethical, and lawful development of generative AI systems and to bring Suno\u2019s and Udio\u2019s blatant infringement to an end.\u201d He added that the music community is already partnering and collaborating with \u201cresponsible developers to build sustainable AI tools\u201d that put artists and songwriters in charge, but unlicensed services can exploit an artist\u2019s work \u201cwithout consent or pay set back \u2026 .\u201d In April, more than 200 artists, including Billie Eilish, Kacey Musgraves, J Balvin, Ja Rule, Jon Bon Jovi, The Jonas Brothers, Katy Perry, Miranda Lambert and more, signed an open letter\u00a0organized by the non-profit Artist Rights Alliance calling on AI developers, technology companies, platforms and digital music services to \u201ccease the use of artificial intelligence to infringe upon and devalue the rights of human artists.\u201d The lawsuit against Udio states \u201cif developed with the permission and participation of copyright owners, generative AI tools will be able to assist humans in creating and producing new and innovative music.\u201d It added: \u201cBut if developed irresponsibly, without regard for fundamental copyright protections, those same tools threaten enduring and irreparable harm to recording artists, record labels, and the music industry, inevitably reducing the quality of new music available to consumers and diminishing our shared culture.\u201d Meanwhile, the lawsuit against Suno states the company has over 10,000,000 users generating music files using the platform, bringing in about 2,000,000 streams. \u201cThese digital music files have been released to the public\u2014some already finding their way onto the major streaming services\u2014and compete with the copyrighted sound recordings that enabled their creation; yet Suno sought no permission from and gives no credit or compensation to the human artists or other rightsholders whose works fueled their creation.\u201d This story has been updated with additional context and developments.

Wracked with grief, Rebecca Fielding said she was in a \u201creally dark place.\u201d Jonathan was her best friend, and while she sometimes doubted others\u2019 love for her, she never questioned his. She said she\u2019d journeyed to Utah to take her own life.

She also left a bag of Takis chips, a Spiderman plushie she had bought at a gas station and some tiny plastic babies \u2014 an inside joke between her and her family. She then drove back to Missouri \u2014 with no expectations for what was to come. \u201cMy goal was just to tell people what happened \u2026 It bothered me that my entire world had imploded at that spot and no one visiting would have any idea,\u201d she told CNN. \u201cI never expected strangers to feel so connected to a dead person they never heard of.\u201d A \u2018Grand Canyon sized mark on the world\u2019 Jonathan Fielding had moved to Orem, Utah, about six months before his death. Originally from Blue Springs, Missouri, he\u00a0loved photography and exploring nature. So the red-rock landscape of southern Utah was an ideal place for him to spend time while on breaks from his sales job. On January 27, Jonathan and several friends were visiting Moonscape Overlook, a remote ridge east of Capitol Reef National Park that offers panoramic views of the surrounding desert. Jonathan was taking photos when a cliff he stepped on crumbled and he fell more than 200 feet to his death. He was 19. Rebecca said that while Jonathan was passionate about photography, he didn\u2019t share his photos much with her. She didn\u2019t discover his new photography website until after his death. Parts of the site remain unfinished. After his death Rebecca looked through her brother\u2019s cameras and found photos Jonathan had taken the day he fell. They include striking images from\u00a0the Moonscape Overlook, its otherworldly vistas\u00a0illuminated by the afternoon sun. \u201cJonathan saw beauty everywhere he went,\u201d she wrote in a TikTok post. \u201cWhile he might not be the subject of the photos he took just moments before his death, he is in every one of them.\u201d Rebecca said she grew up gay in a religious environment and lives with autism and depression. For her, Jonathan was the only person she was comfortable letting see her at her \u201cabsolute worst,\u201d and that \u201che never once judged me for it.\u201d In her grief, Rebecca left a note in the journal she left at the site of her brother\u2019s fall: \u201cJonathan Fielding 5/5/2004 - 1/27/24, a soul too pure for this world, a kid too fearless for his own good, a friend whose kindness knew no bounds,\u201d she wrote on the first page, \u201cA son who could never disappoint, a brother whose love knew no limit. A person who left a Grand Canyon sized mark on this world.\u201d The journal received a few entries from strangers, but it soon became too weathered to survive the desert elements. So Rebecca returned to Utah in April and replaced the journal with a sturdier and \u201cmore waterproof\u201d one, along with an account of what had happened to her brother and a new pen. This time she added, \u201cI love you Bro. And thank you for loving me.\u201d Tammy Mayo Fielding, Rebecca and Jonathan\u2019s mother, also left a note in the journal. Two months later, on June 12, hiker Sherrie Joyce Miller\u00a0was taking a drive along Utah\u2019s\u00a0Highway 24 with her close friend Kelli Hansen when they pulled over at their favorite swimming hole by the Dirty Devil River. Miller, who prefers to be known as Sherr Joy, told CNN that after she got out of the car with her dog Bandit, she noticed a black notebook under a rock near a tree. It turned out to be the journal Rebecca had left in April. Sherr Joy recognized the name and the description from having read the news about Jonathan\u2019s death. \u201cI realized it was something precious, \u201cshe said. Captivated, she put the journal in a gallon bag and tucked it back under a rock, then left a note of her own, signed with her nickname, \u201cSharki.\u201d Rebecca Fielding had also visited Utah again in June but had not been able to locate the journal or read any of the new entries in it. On that trip she had even left a third journal in a waterproof container with a photo album near the spot of Jonathan\u2019s death, thinking the previous one had been lost. It turns out the April journal had been picked up from Jonathan\u2019s resting place at the end of Moon Overlook Road and left near Highway 24 by someone who identified themselves only as \u201ca nomad\u201d who believed it to be a \u201crandom notebook left by a tourist.\u201d \u201cIt was only after reaching this spot did I carefully read its pages,\u201d the nomad wrote in the journal on June 1. \u201cPerhaps Jonathan wanted to have one last adventure. What a most magical spot he chose.\u201d By then, other strangers had already left notes in the journal. One entry was from someone visiting from The Netherlands. After messaging Rebecca through Facebook, Sherr Joy and Hansen helped her devise a plan to make the journal a place where Jonathan\u2019s memory could live on. \u201cI reached out to Rebecca as one human being to another, I thought the family might want the journal returned to where it started,\u201d Sherr Joy said. \u201cI believe grief manifests into love when we as human beings embrace each other with kindness whether we personally knew someone or not.\u201d Strangers began leaving messages to honor Jonathan A public Facebook group, \u201cJonathan Fielding\u2019s Journal Journey\u201d was born two days later. The page asks travelers to update the journal before passing it along to the next person who finds it. Joy went back to Highway 24 and left a photo of Jonathan, along with a description of the journal project on the back, so future passersby would have context. \u201cIf you find this book, please take it to a new location and leave it for the next traveler,\u201d she wrote on a laminated piece of paper. \u201cHis sister, Rebecca Fielding started a Facebook page to track his journal. Please post a picture so his family may track the journey.\u201d Rebecca also made a TikTok video on June 14 to share the entries made in the journal before Sherr Joy\u2019s discovery. She set the TikTok to the song \u201cNot Dead Yet,\u201d by Lord Huron, Jonathan\u2019s favorite band, and added a message in the last slide: \u201cAs long as one person remembers who he was, he will never fully die.\u201d The video shows some of the comments left in the journal. \u201cJonathan, we did not know you\u2026\u201d wrote two travelers who identified themselves as David W. and James H. \u201cWe do know this: you took your last breaths at this sublime, heavenly place. And that, like your life, has to mean something.\u201d Another entry, signed by the nomad, read: \u201cJonathan\u2026 may you enjoy some time here listening to the water and resting under this tree.\u201d Others left items in the journal, like feathers and leaves. Rebecca said that she left the journal for Jonathan \u2014 but also for a small part of herself. It was a cry for help, she said. \u201cI wanted to be seen, pretty much. I wanted my grief and pain to be seen because I have a big family. It felt like people were looking at me, but they weren\u2019t seeing me and seeing what I was going through,\u201d she said. \u201c(I was) just feeling like an outsider and just feeling so alone because Jonathan was my person\u2026 I just didn\u2019t want to be alone anymore.\u201d The power of human connection in the face of tragedy For Rebecca Fielding, the journal project happened somewhat by accident. But the love she felt from her brother, she says, was nothing but intentional. He was a \u201cball of light.\u201d She said she feels like \u201cnothing I do will ever be good enough to make up for what happened \u2026 It\u2019s super cliche, but grief is just love with nowhere to go\u2026 This love I have for him; I don\u2019t really have anywhere else to put it.\u201d Even so, she\u2019s been deeply moved by how the journal idea has grown into \u201cthis huge, amazing thing\u201d that has affected others who have heard Jonathan\u2019s story. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s just so fitting for who Jonathan was and is such a good way to remember him, because it was just the little things he did in life that made a huge impact on people.\u201d According to Rebecca, Jonathan once spent 30 minutes disassembling a lamp in a stranger\u2019s yard to free a bird trapped inside. Another time, he and Rebecca were exploring\u00a0the Utah desert together when Rebecca started having anxiety about whether Jonathan was enjoying himself. \u201cThe entire time, I kept asking him, \u2018Hey, is this something you like doing? Do you want to do this instead?\u2019\u201d she recalled. \u201cEventually, he was just like, \u2018Rebecca, I don\u2019t care what I\u2019m doing. I\u2019m just happy to be spending time with you.\u2019\u201d Rebecca said receiving the journal entries from Sherr Joy was \u201cincredible\u201d and lifted her spirits. \u201cWhen (she) sent those messages, I was just blown away by the things that people had written in them because they were absolutely beautiful and just so touching,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll never meet these people (and) I\u2019ll never know a lot of their names, but they just really left a mark on my soul.\u201d For Sherr Joy, finding Rebecca\u2019s journal gave her hope for \u201chow we can make this world a better place.\u201d She believes \u201cit only takes one gesture or act of kindness to create a ripple of good energy.\u201d Now the public group has over 900 members, and anyone can use it to track the journal\u2019s progress and location. Rebecca says she\u2019s keeping her \u201cfingers crossed\u201d that the journal receives more entries soon. Rebecca said Jonathan also wrote in journals. After he died she and their mother\u00a0found a passage in one of them, which Rebecca read to CNN. \u201cWhy am I proud of myself? I don\u2019t quit. I\u2019m focused on getting better every day,\u201d Jonathan had written. \u201cI take care of others around me. I motivate everyone around me. What does growth require? Patience and forgiveness.\u201d Jonathan would have turned 20 last month. Now, his spirit lives on in the desert landscape that he loved so much, thanks to strangers who are touched and inspired by his story \u2014 and to his devoted sister, who wants him never to be forgotten.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/29/us/jonathan-fielding-utah-rebecca-journal-cec/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/30/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_05_30_us_kohberger-idaho-killings-pretrial-hearings", "text": "After yet another pre-trial hearing in Bryan Kohberger\u2019s quadruple murder trial in early May, the family of one of the victims openly criticized the slow pace of the proceedings. \u201cThis case is turning into a hamster wheel of motions, hearings, and delayed decisions,\u201d the \u201cincredibly frustrated\u201d family of slain University of Idaho student Kaylee Goncalves said in a statement. The criticism stemmed from the long and winding road that\u2019s unfolded since four University of Idaho students \u2013 Goncalves, Ethan Chapin, Xana Kernodle and Madison Mogen \u2013 were fatally stabbed in the overnight hours of November 13, 2022, at a home just off the school\u2019s main campus in Moscow. Kohberger, a Washington State University graduate student in criminology, was arrested in the killings on December 30, 2022, in his home state of Pennsylvania. A\u00a0not guilty plea was entered on his behalf in May 2023, and his\u00a0attorneys have indicated the 29-year-old intends to present an alibi as part of his defense. Prosecutors have said they will seek the death penalty. The trial is set to begin June 2, 2025, according to a scheduling order filed in court. Still, the progression of the case has been slowed by a series of pre-trial motions and hearings. Latah County Judge John Judge said in April he wants a \u201chearing at least every month,\u201d noting the importance of \u201ccleaning up\u201d the legal proceedings. The hearings largely fall into a few different buckets. One relates to the defense attorneys\u2019 access to evidence, particularly how the prosecution used investigative genetic genealogy in building the case. A second set of hearings concerns Kohberger\u2019s proposed alibi for his innocence. Third, there have be a number of hearings related to a gag order that restricts what the parties can publicly say about the case. Here\u2019s a timeline of some of the notable pre-trial hearings and decisions so far: June 9, 2023: A coalition of media organizations and the family of a murder victim came to court to challenge the gag order placed on the parties in the case. June 23, 2023: The judge denied both requests but issued a revised gag order that allows the parties to discuss topics that do not have a \u201csubstantial likelihood of materially prejudicing or otherwise influencing the outcome of the case.\u201d August 2, 2023: Kohberger\u2019s attorneys said they would\u00a0use an alibi defense but couldn\u2019t pin down their client\u2019s specific location on the night of the killings because he was \u201cdriving during the late night and early morning hours.\u201d \u201cMr.\u00a0Kohberger\u00a0is not claiming to be at a specific location at a specific time; at this time there is not a specific witness to say precisely where Mr.\u00a0Kohberger\u00a0was at each moment of the hours\u201d of the attacks, his attorneys said in a court filing. October 26, 2023: The judge denied a\u00a0request to dismiss the grand jury indictment after the defense argued there was an error in the grand jury instructions. December 18, 2023: The judge denied a second motion to dismiss the indictment after the defense argued prosecutors failed to comply fully with state rules on jury selection and the jury questionnaire. February 28, 2024: Defense attorney Anne C. Taylor asked the court to allow three defense experts and others to view the investigative genetic genealogy evidence, which has been sealed, to understand the full timeline of how police began to focus on Kohberger. Genetic genealogy is a practice that blends DNA analysis in the lab with genealogical research, such as tracing a person\u2019s family tree. In this case, investigators found a single source of male DNA on the button snap of a leather knife sheath left at the crime scene,\u00a0according to a probable cause affidavit. FBI investigators loaded the DNA profile to public genealogy sites to search for a match and then sent a tip to investigate Kohberger, according to a prosecution court filing. The judge initially declined to give the defense investigators extended access to the investigative genetic genealogy, saying he would rather the experts already approved to view the material give justification for digging deeper. April 4, 2024: The judge criticized Kohberger\u2019s defense attorney, saying she commissioned phone surveys to potential jurors that could hinder Kohberger\u2019s ability to get a fair trial. However, Taylor said the judge violated her client\u2019s right to due process by ordering a stop to the anonymous survey without hearing the defense\u2019s side first. April 17, 2024: Kohberger\u2019s defense lawyers filed a court document saying they plan\u00a0to offer a cell phone tower and radio frequency expert to partially corroborate\u00a0his proposed alibi that he was out driving west of Moscow\u00a0on the night of the slayings. April 19, 2024: The judge allowed surveys conducted with potential jurors to continue \u201cwithout modification\u201d after temporarily pausing them. April 29, 2024: The prosecution asked the court to deny Kohberger the opportunity to add to his alibi and to preclude anyone other than the defendant to testify as to his whereabouts on the night of the murders. May 2, 2024: Kohberger\u2019s defense had asked for an upcoming evidentiary hearing with witnesses be made public, while the prosecution asked that it be sealed. The judge ruled that it will be closed to the public. May 23, 2024: Taylor, the defense attorney, questioned a Moscow police detective about the preparation of visual cell phone logs and methods for searching for certain videos. The testimony was related to two motions to compel prosecutors to share discovery with the defense, but the contents of the motions are sealed, so it was not clear what they were requesting. May 30, 2024: The Moscow police detective leading the investigation and a defense expert in cell phone location data testified that the defense has not received some key evidence in the case. Cpl. Brett Payne, the lead investigator on the case, testified he and other investigators collected thousands of hours of video surveillance as they tried to locate a white Hyundai Elantra connected to the suspect. The videos are saved on various thumb drives, but there is no central inventory of the videos, he testified. He also said investigators did not see on any of the videos the Elantra going south from Moscow toward Pullman, Washington, in the early morning hours after the killings. The probable cause affidavit used in the case alleges Kohberger drove south toward Pullman after he committed the four killings. Sy Ray, an expert on cell phone geolocation data, testified that he has not been provided the underlying AT&T source data and list of nearby cell towers that was used by detectives to create a map of Kohberger\u2019s movements with his cell phone. Based on the data he had received, he believed some statements in the records were not accurate, and he said the missing data could be helpful to the defense. \u201cBecause of the piecemealing of the data, because of the missing data, because of data that I\u2019m reviewing that is incredibly inaccurate, everything that is missing is absolutely to the benefit of the defense right now,\u201d he said. June 7, 2024: After previously restricting who had access to the investigative genetic genealogy evidence, the judge ruled to allow unnamed \u201cdefense investigators\u201d to view the material. June 27, 2024: The parties agreed to go to trial around this time next year, with a scheduling order filed in court establishing the start date as June 2, 2025. Judge set aside about three months for the trial, including two weeks for jury selection, eight weeks for the trial and two weeks for potential post-conviction hearings and sentencing. \u201cThis is a great step to set these deadlines and hearings so that we can move through this,\u201d he said. The scheduling order also indicates any motions challenging the death penalty are to be filed by September 5, with responses due by October 10. If a motion to change the venue is granted, \u201cthe Court anticipates that the trial dates will not change,\u201d the ruling states.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/30/us/kohberger-idaho-killings-pretrial-hearings/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/30/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_26_us_jocelyn-nungaray-killing-houston", "text": "Two undocumented Venezuelan men have been charged with capital murder in the killing this month of a 12-year-old girl in Houston, the latest case to underscore the pivotal role immigration continues to play in US politics and the upcoming presidential election. Johan Jose Martinez-Rangel, 22, and\u00a0Franklin Jose Pe\u00f1a Ramos, 26, were arrested June 20, three days after the strangled body of Jocelyn Nungaray was found in a shallow creek, according to the Houston Police Department. A judge this week ordered each man held on a $10 million bond, court records show. Both men are Venezuelan nationals who entered the US illegally, a spokesperson for US Immigration and Customs Enforcement told CNN. It\u2019s\u00a0unclear when and where they entered the\u00a0country, the spokesperson said, but each was apprehended near El Paso by US Border Patrol \u2013\u00a0Martinez-Rangel on\u00a0March\u00a014\u00a0and Pe\u00f1a Ramos on May\u00a028\u00a0\u2013 and released with a notice to appear in court in the future. An attorney for Pe\u00f1a Ramos declined to comment.\u00a0An attorney for\u00a0Martinez-Rangel did not immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday. Republicans and right-wing media have\u00a0pointed to the case as a consequence of\u00a0the immigration policies of President Joe Biden\u2019s administration as they seek\u00a0to draw a contrast with his rival, former President Donald Trump. \u201cThat little girl would be alive today if Biden enforced immigration laws at the border,\u201d GOP Gov. Greg Abbott said on X following the suspects\u2019 arrests. Trump, who will face Biden Thursday in CNN\u2019s Presidential Debate, has echoed as much, saying in a speech over the weekend both suspects \u201cwould not have been in our country\u201d if he were president, despite the fact similar crimes\u00a0occurred during his time in office.\u00a0He also pointed\u00a0to the cases of two women who authorities say were killed in the past year by\u00a0men\u00a0who crossed into the country illegally: Georgia nursing student Laken Riley\u00a0and Maryland mother Rachel Morin. Asked Wednesday about the cases, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said, \u201cOur hearts are with the families of the victims.\u201d \u201cThe criminals who committed these heinous acts must be held responsible with the fullest force of the law,\u201d he told CNN\u2019s Kate Bolduan. \u201cWe will hold the criminals accountable.\u201d Jocelyn\u2019s body was found along West Rankin Road in north Houston early in the morning of June 17, authorities have said. Detectives got surveillance footage from the area showing the suspects together at a restaurant the prior evening, Lt. Stephen Hope of the Houston Police Department said at a news conference after their arrests. The pair left on foot and were later seen meeting and talking with Jocelyn, Hope said, before all three walked to a convenience store. A few minutes later, Hope said, Jocelyn and the men went to the bridge where \u201cultimately, Jocelyn was murdered,\u201d Hope said.\u00a0The suspects left, he said, before returning to a residence they shared. On June 20, Houston police found the suspects at an apartment complex where they were arrested without incident, Hope said, crediting the community with helping police throughout the investigation. At this time, the charges against the suspects do not carry eligibility for the death penalty, Harris County District Attorney Kim Ogg said at a news conference Monday, according to footage from CNN affiliate KHOU, adding forensic evidence is still being examined. The decision on whether to seek a death sentence would not be unilaterally made by Ogg, she said. Her office has a committee that makes that choice based on the evidence and the feelings of the victim\u2019s family. At that news conference, Alexis Nungaray, Jocelyn\u2019s mother, said it had been \u201ca very, very hard time\u201d for her family, telling reporters she kept seeing \u201csigns\u201d that reminded her of Jocelyn in the days following her death. \u201cI know this is a very high-profile case,\u201d Nungaray said, \u201cbut she was still my firstborn. I was a teen mom, I fought for her at 15. I\u2019m 27 now, and I\u2019m still fighting for her.\u201d \u201cJust remember that she was a very special little girl that deserves her justice.\u201d CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated when the two men entered the US.

{"id": "2024_06_28_us_dolphins-stranded-cape-cod-massachusetts", "text": "After more than 100 dolphins were found stranded off Cape Cod, Massachusetts, the numbers had dwindled down to between 10 to 20 dolphins circling in the harbor by Saturday morning following a 12-hour rescue effort by the International Fund for Animal Welfare, a spokesperson said. In what the IFAW described as possibly \u201cthe largest single mass stranding event\u201d in the organization\u2019s 26-year history, 125 Atlantic white-sided dolphins were located stranded early Friday in shallow mud flats of Wellfleet in an area called the \u201cGut,\u201d or Great Island at the Herring River. Stacey Hedman, the fund\u2019s communications director, described the area as a \u201cvery difficult location with dangerous mud.\u201d The town of Wellfleet is a little over 100 miles southeast of Boston. On Saturday, Hedman said other than the remaining 10 to 20 dolphins, the rest of the mammals were successfully herded out \u2013 \u201cat least for a time.\u201d Hedman added: \u201cThose spotted this morning are likely the same dolphins. They are still swimming but close to shore,\u201d noting that low tide was set to begin at noon. The non-profit, which rescues, rehabilitates and releases animals, described the Herring River Gut as \u201cthe epicenter of our mass strandings\u201d in a Facebook post on Friday. \u201cWe had 125 Atlantic white-sided dolphins strand and 10 died before we arrived,\u201d Hedman said in an email to CNN on Friday. The dolphins were herded in a coordinated response effort Friday to encourage their movement back to deeper waters, IFAW said in a news release Saturday. Rescuers began on foot and switched to boating efforts as the water returned to high tide just before 5 p.m. Friday, which worked in their favor to refloat the animals, according to the fund. Rescuers continued until sunset. The rescue operation, in which at least 25 fund workers and 100 volunteers assisted, was ongoing on Saturday.  The Whale and Dolphin Conservation, the Center for Coastal Studies, AmeriCorps of Cape Cod and the New England Aquarium are also supporting the operation. \u201cAt first light Saturday morning, an IFAW team was on the water to find 10 of the dolphins swimming in a dangerous area, and efforts have been successful to herd them towards deeper water,\u201d the fund stated in the release. \u201cIFAW scouts found another group of 25 dolphins swimming but close to shore in Eastham.\u201d Eastham is just south of Wellfleet. \u201cThis rescue had many challenges due to the number of dolphins, the large size of many of the animals, how spread out they were over a large area, the difficult mud conditions, and the complicated locations from which we could reach them,\u201d said Misty Niemeyer, stranding coordinator for IFAW, in a statement. \u201cIt was a 12-hour exhausting response in the unrelenting sun, but the team was able to overcome the various challenges and give the dolphins their best chance at survival,\u201d Niemeyer said. Hedman noted there is no set explanation for why dolphins strand. \u201cCape Cod is a global stranding hotspot due to the curvature of our shores and the fluctuation of our tides,\u201d Hedman said. More dolphins get stranded along Cape Cod\u2019s 12-mile stretch of shoreline than any other place globally, according to the fund. This story has been updated with additional information.

{"id": "2024_06_25_us_las-vegas-shootings", "text": "An overnight manhunt for a gunman sought in the deaths of five people in North Las Vegas ended Tuesday morning after police located him just before he killed himself. Eric Adams, 47, was identified by police as a suspect in two shootings on Monday night, according to a news release from the North Las Vegas Police Department. Five people were killed and a 13-year-old girl was hospitalized in critical condition with a gunshot wound after the shooting spree at two apartments. The shooting started when an argument broke out between the suspect and his ex-girlfriend while he was visiting her apartment, police said Thursday in an updated news release. Around 10 p.m. on Monday, police received reports of a shooting at an apartment complex on Casa Norte Drive, the release said. When they arrived, police located two adult females \u2013 one in her early 40s and another in her late 50s \u2013 with gunshot wounds. They were later pronounced dead by medical personnel, according to police. \u201cThe two got into a domestic-related argument, during which Adams armed himself with a gun and shot two other women in the apartment,\u201d the Thursday news release said. Police later located a third victim, a 13-year-old female, who also had a gunshot wound and remains in critical condition at UMC Trauma Center as of Thursday, police told CNN in an email. Three more victims were with gunshot wounds were found at another apartment in the same complex, police said Thursday \u2013 Adams\u2019 ex-girlfriend\u2019s 24-year-old daughter and her 22-year-old friend, along with a 20-year-old man. All three were pronounced dead at the scene, police said. The 20-year-old victim, who was an upstairs neighbor, heard the commotion and decided to check on the women to see if he could help, police said. Adams then shot him when he arrived at the apartment, police said. At that point, the suspect went upstairs and shot three people who were inside that apartment, including a 59-year-old woman, a 40-year-old woman and the teenage girl, police said. Two other people were inside the apartment but were left unharmed. Police then identified Adams as a suspect and the manhunt began overnight. After the shootings, Adams took his ex-girlfriend hostage and fled the area, police said. At some point in the early hours of Tuesday morning, the ex-girlfriend escaped unharmed and found a nearby Las Vegas Metropolitan Police officer to ask for help. Police searched throughout the night for Adams until around 10 a.m. on Tuesday, when they received a tip that he was at a business on East Lake Mead Boulevard. When police arrived at that area, Adams fled to the backyard of a nearby residence. \u201cOfficers began giving Adams verbal commands to drop the firearm, however, Adams ignored those commands and died by suicide,\u201d the release says. Police are continuing their investigation into the incident. \u201cThe surviving victims and their families are being assisted by the North Las Vegas Police Department, victim advocates and detectives, to help them through this difficult time,\u201d police said Thursday.
