{"id": "2024_07_08_us_patriot-front-white-nationalist-group", "text": "With their faces concealed behind white cloths and sunglasses, dozens of protesters marched down the streets of downtown Nashville this weekend, chanting \u201cSieg Heil\u201d and \u201cDeportation saves the nation,\u201d according to a statement from the Tennessee Democratic Party. \u201cReclaim America,\u201d one banner at the front of the group read. Behind it, uniformed marchers in dark shirts and khaki-colored pants hoisted a plethora of Confederate and historic US flags, with some of the American flags turned upside down. Their attire and tactics are hallmarks of the Patriot Front white supremacist group, with which the protesters are believed to be affiliated. And they\u2019re just part of a multifaceted shift in political rhetoric purportedly aiming to drastically reshape America during this crucial presidential election cycle. While \u201cno criminal activity took place\u201d during the Nashville rally, police said, the demonstration drew disdain from local critics. \u201cJust two days after celebrating the independence of our nation, white supremacists have taken to the streets of Nashville carrying Confederate flags and chanting \u2018deportation saves the nation\u2019 and \u2018Sieg Heil,\u2019\u201d the Tennessee Democratic Party said in a statement posted on X Saturday night. \u201cThis is what we\u2019re fighting against in Tennessee,\u201d state party chair Hendrell Remus said in the statement. \u201cThis is what we\u2019re fighting against in America.\u201d While bystanders were stunned to see the White nationalist demonstration in Nashville, protests linked to the Patriot Front have popped up across the country, including in Boston on Independence Day weekend two years ago. Here\u2019s what we know about the clandestine group: How did Patriot Front start? Patriot Front \u201cis a white nationalist hate group that\u00a0formed in the aftermath of the deadly \u2018Unite the Right\u2019 rally\u00a0in Charlottesville, Virginia,\u201d according to the Southern Poverty Law Center. \u201cThe organization broke off from Vanguard America (VA), a neo-Nazi group that participated in the chaotic demonstration,\u201d the SPLC website adds. The 2017 rally turned deadly when counterprotester Heather Heyer was killed. Later that month, Thomas Ryan Rousseau, who\u00a0led Vanguard America members\u00a0at \u201cUnite the Right,\u201d rebranded the group\u2019s website and launched a new group called Patriot Front, according to the Anti-Defamation League. CNN has reached out to an attorney who has represented the Patriot Front\u2019s leader for comment. What do Patriot Front members believe? \u201cMembers of the white supremacist group Patriot Front believe that their ancestors conquered America and bestowed it to them, and no one else,\u201d according to\u00a0the ADL. \u201cPatriot Front defines itself as an organization of \u201cAmerican nationalists,\u201d justifying its hate and intolerance under the guise of preserving America\u2019s identity as a \u201cPan-European nation,\u201d the ADL adds. The group\u2019s manifesto claims those in America who are not of European ancestry are not truly American. \u201cTo be an American is to be a descendant of conquerors, pioneers, visionaries, and explorers. This unique identity was given to us by our ancestors, and this national spirit remains firmly rooted in our blood,\u201d the Patriot Front\u2019s manifesto states. \u201cNationhood cannot be bestowed upon those who are not of the founding stock of our people, and those who do not share the common spirit that permeates our greater civilization, and the European diaspora,\u201d the manifesto adds. Earlier this year, an attorney defending the Patriot Front group in a civil lawsuit told a federal judge in an oral argument that its members are not white supremacists. Rather, he suggested they are white separatists of the \u201cgood fences make good neighbors variety,\u201d according to a written decision from the judge. After reviewing the group\u2019s website and manifesto, which calls for \u201cthe formation of a white ethnostate,\u201d the judge concluded that she \u201ccannot reasonably infer that Patriot Front seeks separation for any reason other than white supremacy.\u201d What are the goals of Patriot Front? \u201cI think when you look at the past actions of the Patriot Front, they\u2019re varied,\u201d former FBI Deputy Assistant Director Peter Strzok said in 2022, shortly after a similar group of protesters demonstrated near a Pride parade in Idaho. \u201cA lot of what they do is designed for image \u2013 for creating propaganda that they can use to spread their message to recruit more followers,\u201d Strzok told CNN. \u201cSo in the past, what we\u2019ve seen from a lot of their activities (is) not so much intent on engaging in violence as much as engaging in protests. Certainly, hateful speech, for sure, but this is much more a group that\u2019s designed for image and for creating a public spectacle.\u201d Strzok said the emergence of the\u00a0\u201creplacement theory\u201d has played into White nationalist propaganda, and \u201cI think that\u2019s encouraging or accepting behavior that in the past we had moved away from.\u201d But Strzok said there\u2019s always a key question with such groups: \u201cIs there a trigger point where their intention is to move from simply protesting to violence?\u201d How is Patriot Front different from other White nationalist or White supremacist groups? Members of Patriot Front are \u201ccomparatively young,\u201d Strzok said. \u201cA central tactic to Patriot Front is \u2018flash demonstrations\u2019 \u2013 privately planned and unannounced events that allow groups to promote their beliefs while limiting the risk of individual exposure, negative media coverage, arrests and public backlash,\u201d according to\u00a0the ADL. \u201cThese flash demonstrations are mainly orchestrated for a quick photo and video opportunity that is then turned into online content.\u201d And Patriot Front \u201chas declined to participate in large rallies with other hate groups,\u00a0preferring instead to work with small, local chapters that allow Patriot Front to remain the center of attention\u00a0while controlling their message and presentation,\u201d according to the SPLC.

{"id": "2024_07_10_politics_chicago-donors-fundraiser-convention", "text": "Democratic donors are deeply concerned about President Joe Biden\u2019s viability as a candidate as the party continues to wrestle with the path forward \u2014 and holding back big checks, according to multiple sources familiar with the effort. \u201cEverything is frozen because no one knows what\u2019s going to happen. Everyone is in wait and see mode,\u201d one Democratic strategist told CNN, noting that donors are hyper-focused on what Biden is doing, including interviews and his news conference Thursday. Donors often operate behind the scenes and, according to sources, have grown increasingly anxious about Biden\u2019s candidacy following his halting debate performance last month. And on Wednesday, George Clooney, who had been among Biden\u2019s biggest supporters and donors in Hollywood, took the remarkable step of publicly calling for him to bow out of the presidential race. The Clooney op-ed, the strategist said, is \u201cgoing to sting.\u201d Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s comments on MSNBC Wednesday morning also raised fresh doubts and ricocheted among donors. Pelosi\u00a0told MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe\u201d that \u201cit\u2019s up to the president to decide if he is going to run. We\u2019re all encouraging him to make that decision because time is running short.\u201d \u201cMajor donations have slowed remarkably since the debate,\u201d a Democratic fundraiser told CNN, adding that small dollar donations are proceeding at pace, but noted the campaign is too vast to live on small donations alone. A Biden campaign official told CNN that July was the best start to any month ever for grassroots fundraising. They added that several donors maxed out in the past few days and that the Biden-Harris campaign had several fundraisers across the country this month alone. Earlier this week, Biden tried to reassure donors in a call, maintaining that he\u2019s staying in the race and arguing he\u2019s still the best candidate to beat Republican rival Donald Trump. \u201cMy one job is to beat Donald Trump,\u201d\u00a0Biden\u00a0said, according to one of the participants on the\u00a0call, who said\u00a0Biden\u00a0thanked\u00a0donors and renewed his pledge to keep the fight alive. But that hasn\u2019t calmed everyone\u2019s nerves. \u201cIt\u2019s been a rough go,\u201d one source familiar with the fundraising situation said. \u201cIn the short term, the money is a challenge, but it is a fluid situation.\u201d The incoming money is \u201cdrying up,\u201d another source close to fundraising efforts told CNN, describing\u00a0donors as very, very frustrated, and very, very worried. That\u2019s already come through in fundraisers held after the debate: A fundraiser held at New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy\u2019s home following the debate raised $3.7 million \u2013 less than half of the haul raised at a pre-debate fundraiser held at the Virginia home of former Gov. Terry McAuliffe the week before the debate. Top Chicago donors halting convention fundraising lunch for high-dollar contributors Meanwhile, organizers for at least one Chicago fundraiser scheduled during the Democratic National Convention have decided to not to proceed with the mid-August event, a source with knowledge of the discussions told CNN. In the immediate wake of Biden\u2019s debate performance, organizers paused conversations on planning the fundraiser until after the July 4 holiday to allow the dust to settle. This week, the host committee decided not to proceed with the event, citing a disagreement over how to proceed given the continued erosion of support for Biden\u2019s candidacy. The event, designed as a lunch for a few dozen wealthy Windy City denizens, was expected to rally support among the party\u2019s loyal and well-heeled locals in a show of support for the big event in their backyard. While the lunch itself was expected to bring in less than $1 million for the campaign, the mood of the participants \u2014 many of whom had given millions to Biden\u2019s 2020 campaign and associated entities \u2014 serves as a warning sign among some deep-blue corners of the donor class. A spokesperson for the Biden campaign told CNN the event was not affiliated with their official fundraising schedule. Nearly two weeks after the debate, some Democratic donors continue to sound public warnings that their party could lose the White House in November if Biden remains the nominee and say they are increasingly concerned about his dug-in defiance. The president has insisted he will remain in the race and expressed frustration\u00a0with \u201cthe elites\u201d calling for him to withdraw from the race. Damon Lindelof, a Hollywood screenwriter and producer\u00a0who recently called on fellow Democratic donors\u00a0to withhold contributions until Biden steps down, told CNN in an email Wednesday he\u2019s \u201cpretty steadfast\u201d in that view. \u201cI maintain that Joe Biden is an excellent president, and I\u2019m saddened that the intraparty language is attack/defend/retreat instead of a thoughtful and considered debate about where we are and how to get to where we need to be,\u201d Lindelof said. \u201cI think the characterization that the only folks asking for that conversation are \u2018elites\u2019 ignores the polling and the tens of millions of Americans who have been saying they were deeply concerned about our nominee for awhile now,\u201d he added. Maggie Kulyk, a Democratic donor who runs a wealth-management firm, said her view that Biden needs to step down is shared by \u201cpeople I talk to all the time \u2013 friends, clients, etc. \u201cTo a person, they all say the same thing, that he shouldn\u2019t be at the top of the ticket,\u201d she said in a telephone interview. \u201cWashington politicians or someone with some leverage needs to grow a spine and tell the truth that\u2019s in plain sight,\u201d she added, that Biden is dealing with \u201cobvious cognitive issues.\u201d \u201cThis sort of waiting around for (Biden) to make a big stumble again as an excuse, to me, seems ludicrous,\u201d Kulyk said. \u201cThe debate was the thing. We saw it.\u201d Kulyk sits on the board of the Women Donors Network but said she was not speaking on behalf of the contributor group. Democrats stunned by last 24 hours Many anxious Democrats who have been holding their breath and waiting to see what happens to Biden\u2019s reelection campaign have been stunned by the past 24 hours. One widely shared view had been that everything was likely to come to a head after this week\u2019s NATO conference that the US is hosting just blocks away from the White House. Instead, devastating headlines have come out in rapid succession as Biden has been juggling various engagements on the global stage. \u201cThis seems to be moving more rapidly than I thought,\u201d one senior Democrat said. The news of the canceled fundraiser in Chicago came hours after Clooney called on the president to bow out of the race, just weeks after the actor headlined a major fundraiser for the president\u2019s reelection campaign. Clooney wrote that the Biden that he saw during a June 15 fundraiser, which also included former President Barack Obama, \u201cwas not the Joe \u201cbig F-ing deal\u201d Biden of 2010. He wasn\u2019t even the Joe Biden of 2020.\u201d \u201cHe was the same man we all witnessed at the debate,\u201d Clooney added, referencing Biden\u2019s faltering and disastrous performance at the June 27 presidential debate on CNN. Biden\u2019s team is currently planning to host fundraisers in Austin, Denver, and two in California \u2014 one in Laguna Beach and another in Northern California \u2014 in July, according to a source familiar with the plans. Donors elsewhere in the country\u00a0have told CNN\u00a0their events are on hold until Biden\u2019s path is clearer. John Morgan, a Florida trial attorney and longtime Biden supporter, had been working with the campaign to host a fundraiser in the state likely in early September, but he said this week that the event is \u201call up in the air.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t even bother them,\u201d he said\u00a0about\u00a0reaching out to campaign officials\u00a0on\u00a0the status of the event. \u201cI\u2019m not going to call them because they have bigger fish to fry than an event in Florida in September. They\u2019ve got to get past all the naysayers.\u201d For his part, Morgan said he remains committed to backing Biden and is willing to hold a fundraiser \u201conly if he\u2019s the candidate.\u201d \u201cSome of the elite donor class is cutting and running. That\u2019s a huge mistake,\u201d Morgan said. One long-time Democratic fundraiser said it\u2019s too soon to tell whether Biden is doing enough to stem the concerns of contributors but was relieved that there had not been a \u201csnowball\u201d of elected officials in Washington calling on Biden to quit the race this week once they returned from their July 4\u00a0recess. That said, the person added, \u201cI\u2019ve not made any calls or requests (for donations) in the last week and a half \u2026 because he\u2019s got to let some of this die down.\u201d For its part, the Biden campaign has touted a flood of recent online financial support and the substantial infrastructure it already has built in battleground states to argue it will have the ground game and resources to compete effectively this fall. The campaign said it raised $38 million in the four days after the debate, including $30 million from grassroots contributors. Additionally, Peter Lowy, a former retail executive, on Monday delivered the maximum $929,600 contribution to Biden\u2019s joint fundraising committee with the Democratic National Committee, according to the campaign. In a statement, Lowy said \u201cthere is no question about the country\u2019s success\u201d during Biden\u2019s tenure. \u201cThe economy is strong. Unemployment is near historic lows, more than 15 million jobs have been created, the S&P 500 is at an historic high and inflation is now decreasing,\u201d he said. \u201cBased on all of these facts and based on my interactions with the President, when he announced his plan to run for reelection, I was totally supportive. I supported him then, and I support him today.\u201d This story and headline have been updated with additional developments.

The move comes as state officials say they\u2019ve run out of shelter space. \u201cWe\u2019ve never thought that Logan was an appropriate place for people to be staying overnight,\u201d Gov. Maura Healey told CNN affiliate WBZ after announcing the policy. Officials converted a former prison into a shelter. It\u2019s controversial For months, officials in Massachusetts have warned they were overwhelmed by the number of migrants arriving. Healey said last year that the state\u2019s emergency shelter system for families had reached capacity with 7,500 families. At one point last year, the state\u2019s lieutenant governor called on residents to consider housing migrants in their homes due to the lack of shelter space. And recently a delegation from the state traveled to the US Southern border to spread the word \u201cabout how Massachusetts is out of shelter space,\u201d officials said. In May officials announced that the Bay State Correctional Center in Norfolk, which shut down in 2015, was being converted into an emergency shelter that could house 140 families. The controversial announcement sparked protests outside the facility some 25 miles southwest of Boston, WBZ reported. Footage from the CNN affiliate showed protesters waving signs that said, \u201cNo kids in prisons\u201d and \u201cNorfolk Prison-Shelter Not Safe for Anyone!\u201d And at a heated community meeting last month, tensions flared as Norfolk residents expressed concerns about possible impacts on schools, medical services and public safety, according to WBZ. Police and social workers escorted families out Migrants have been sleeping in a corner of the Boston airport\u2019s international arrivals terminal for months. Footage from CNN affiliates showed people lining up sleeping bags, blankets and pillows in rows along the walls of the terminal. At one point, hundreds of migrant families were staying there, CNN affiliate WCVB reported. On June 25, officials said 288 people had slept there overnight. By Tuesday morning, only a few families remained. After sunrise, WBZ reported that state police, social workers and airport staff led those migrants to taxis, which took migrants to welcome centers in Allston and Quincy. \u201cThis is in the best interest of families and travelers and staff at Logan, as the airport is not an appropriate place for people to seek shelter,\u201d state Emergency Assistance Director Scott Rice said in a press release last month. \u201cWe are going to continue to spread the word that Massachusetts is out of shelter space and that, if families are travelling to Massachusetts, they need to be prepared with a plan for housing that does not include Logan Airport or our Emergency Assistance shelters.\u201d CNN\u2019s Braden Walker contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/09/us/boston-logan-airport-migrants-cec/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/11/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_07_10_politics_democrats-nancy-pelosi-biden-nominee", "text": "Two days after President Joe Biden asserted he was \u201cfirmly committed\u201d to staying in the 2024 race, Democrats continue to question his place as their nominee, with the number of lawmakers calling for him to step aside ticking up Wednesday evening. Vermont Sen. Peter Welch became the first Democratic senator to call on Biden to step aside as the nominee in a Washington Post op-ed published Wednesday. Just\u00a010\u00a0congressional Democrats have\u00a0publicly\u00a0called for Biden to step aside, but a larger number are operating under a premise that Biden may still be deliberating, with former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi saying Wednesday, \u201cIt\u2019s up to the president to decide if he is going to run. We\u2019re all encouraging him to make that decision because time is running short.\u201d The comments made by Pelosi, who is known for her precision, confused some members but also\u00a0provided an opening for others, according to conversations with multiple lawmakers and aides. After a group of California House Democrats met in the Capitol Wednesday, many emerged echoing a similar sentiment. \u201cThe president has got to decide what he is going to do,\u201d Democratic Rep. Scott Peters told CNN. When presented with the reality that Biden has stated he plans to remain in the race, Peters responded, \u201cI don\u2019t think the week is over. I think that as more and more data comes in, he\u2019s got to keep his eyes open.\u201d Democratic Rep. Jared Huffman told CNN that just because Biden has said he made his decision to remain in the race, that does not mean it is final. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t work that way,\u201d Huffman, who has raised concerns about Biden, told CNN.\u00a0\u201cWe all understand this as President Biden\u2019s decision. I will just say that good leaders always continue to consider new information and changed circumstances and sometimes make different decisions informed by that. So, this is going to be fluid for a little while.\u201d Even Rep. Jim Clyburn, a Democrat from South Carolina who is a strident Biden supporter, told reporters Wednesday\u00a0he \u201chas no idea\u201d if Biden\u2019s decision to stay in the race is final. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to ask him.\u201d Sen. Joe Manchin, an independent from West Virginia, told CNN Wednesday when pressed on if he really thought Biden could change his mind, \u201cif you can\u2019t change your mind, you can\u2019t change anything,\u201d adding he has always believed \u201crational people do the right thing.\u201d The high stakes meetings on Capitol Hill\u00a0that kicked off on\u00a0Tuesday also did little to resolve Democratic divisions over Biden\u2019s future. House members leaving a nearly two-hour meeting at the DNC argued they were still working through the process, and various caucuses within the Democratic party \u2014 including lawmakers who represent the most competitive districts \u2014\u00a0have held private meetings with Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries, who has promised to relay concerns to the White House. New York Democratic Rep. Ritchie Torres, a member of the Congressional Black Caucus, reversed course on Wednesday and went public with his concerns that Biden remaining at the top of the ticket could hurt Democrats\u2019 chances of winning back the House of Representatives. Torres said in a statement Wednesday that \u201cthere must be a serious reckoning with the down-ballot effect of whomever we nominate,\u201d when two days prior had called the intra-party controversy \u201cself-destructive.\u201d Crystalizing his criticism, Torres said in a statement to CNN \u201cif we are going on a political suicide mission, then we should at least be honest about it.\u201d In just the last two days, Democratic Reps. Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey, Earl Blumenauer of Oregon and Pat Ryan of New York have called on Biden to step aside, bringing the total number of congressional Democrats to make public statements asking Biden to withdraw to 10. During a Senate lunch Tuesday,\u00a0three Democratic senators \u2013 Colorado\u2019s Michael Bennet, Montana\u2019s Jon Tester and Ohio\u2019s Sherrod Brown - expressed concerns to their colleagues that they didn\u2019t think Biden could beat Trump in a rematch in November. Bennet later on Tuesday became the first Democratic senator to publicly say he doesn\u2019t believe Biden is capable of winning reelection. On Thursday, the Biden campaign will dispatch top campaign officials\u00a0including\u00a0senior Biden advisers Mike Donilon and Steve Ricchetti, and Biden Campaign Chair Jen O\u2019Malley Dillon to brief senate Democrats during a special meeting, a sign that questions about Biden\u2019s future are still lingering. Democrats both publicly and privately\u00a0contend that one of the challenges of the moment for them is that they need to see more of the President. \u201cThe President has to be more active, He has to be out there in unscripted situations, answering questions, interacting with voters in order to demonstrate that the debate performance was an anomaly,\u201d independent Maine Sen. Angus King said. Many members told CNN that they will be watching Biden very carefully for the remainder of the week,\u00a0including a high-profile press conference he is scheduled to host on Thursday at NATO. The number three Democrat in the House, Rep. Pete Aguilar of California,\u00a0said Tuesday,\u00a0\u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d referring to the upcoming events. \u201cWe\u2019ll see how this plays out,\u201d Democratic Rep. Jim Costa of California said. This story has been updated with additional developments.

{"id": "2024_07_08_us_rust-trial-alec-baldwin-producer", "text": "In a significant victory for the defense, Alec Baldwin\u2019s role as a producer on the film \u201cRust\u201d will not be considered during his involuntary manslaughter trial in the fatal on-set shooting of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins, Judge Mary Marlowe Sommer ruled Monday. Baldwin\u2019s position as a producer has consistently been part of the prosecution\u2019s strategy as they have sought to show he had more responsibility and influence on the set than just as an actor. In court Monday, the prosecution said as producer he should have been aware of set safety requirements, while Baldwin\u2019s defense said this evidence was prejudicial and confusing to the jury. In issuing her ruling, the judge admitted she struggled to understand the prosecution\u2019s arguments. \u201cI\u2019m having real difficulty with the state\u2019s position that they want to show that as a producer, he didn\u2019t follow guidelines, and therefore, as an actor, Mr. Baldwin did all these things wrong resulting in the death of Halyna Hutchins because as a producer, he allowed this all to happen,\u201d Marlowe Sommer said. The judge said her decision was impacted by the fact that there were other producers on the film and Baldwin himself was not solely responsible for on set decision-making. \u201cThe probative value is not substantially outweighed by unfair prejudice and certainly confusion of issues to the jury, so I\u2019m denying evidence of his status as a producer,\u201d she concluded. Now, with the judge not allowing evidence related to his role as a producer, the jury will consider Baldwin solely as an actor who was holding the gun as part of his role \u2013 not as the boss or as a supervisor who was responsible for set safety. The decision was one of a number of key evidentiary rulings made during a hearing Monday, just one day before jury selection is set to begin in the case. The trial is expected to last about two weeks. The case stems from the fatal shooting of Hutchins on October 21, 2021, at a New Mexico ranch as they rehearsed the Western film \u201cRust.\u201d Baldwin was practicing a \u201ccross draw\u201d \u2013 pulling a gun from a holster on the opposite side of his body from his draw hand \u2013 with a prop gun when it fired a live round, killing Hutchins and injuring director Joel Souza. Prosecutors charged Baldwin with involuntary manslaughter, saying he was negligent and reckless in his handling of the gun. Baldwin has pleaded not guilty and has said he did not pull the trigger and did not know there were live rounds in the firearm. Hannah Gutierrez Reed, the armorer and props assistant for \u201cRust\u201d who loaded the firearm, was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter in March. She was sentenced to the maximum 18 months in prison. Dave Halls, the assistant director who yelled \u201ccold gun\u201d and handed it to Baldwin, agreed to plead no contest to negligent use of a deadly weapon, the\u00a0district attorney\u2019s office announced in January 2023. Judge allows some videos of Baldwin Other pretrial rulings on Monday dealt with videos of Baldwin\u2019s behavior on set, the relevance of some evidence and whether certain witnesses can testify. In one ruling, the judge determined prosecutors can show videos from the set of Baldwin\u2019s handling of the firearm. Prosecutors have said the videos show him improperly handling the gun, including engaging in horseplay with the revolver and placing his finger on the trigger during scenes where he was not required to shoot the firearm. However, the judge ruled prosecutors cannot introduce videos of him yelling or screaming at people on set, saying they were not relevant to the charge. Prosecutors will be allowed to show video of Hutchins after she was shot and photos of her autopsy, the judge ruled. The defense had argued this evidence would be prejudicial to the jury, but prosecutors said it was necessary to their case. Further, the judge ruled to exclude a letter from about 25 crew members defending the safety on set. The judge said the letter was hearsay and cannot be used as evidence at trial unless one of the trial witnesses participated in the letter. Several other decisions went for the defense. In one, the judge ruled they can question Souza, the director, about his civil lawsuit against Baldwin and question his motives. In another, the judge ruled the defense can seek testimony from Robert Shilling, a former investigator for the prosecution who criticized the quality of the investigation.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/08/us/rust-trial-alec-baldwin-producer/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/11/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_07_08_us_us-heat-wave-shatters-records-causes-deaths", "text": "(CNN) \u2014 More than 50 million people across the US are under heat alerts amid a brutal heat wave that has shattered records and caused multiple deaths across the West. As of Monday, much of the West and South are experiencing moderate to major heat risk, the National Weather Service said. California and Nevada are expected to see more daily record high temperatures in the week ahead. By Thursday, the heat in the Pacific Northwest will shift to the Intermountain West and northern High Plains, the National Weather Service\u2019s Weather Prediction Center cautions. In Oregon, four people died of suspected heat-related illnesses over the weekend, according to a Monday news release from Multnomah County. Three of the four were residents of Multnomah County, while the other individual was transported from outside the county and later died at a Portland hospital. These deaths happened after the county declared a state of emergency Friday due to \u201cdangerously hot temperatures,\u201d but the news release noted \u201cfurther tests and investigation will determine whether the deaths are officially hot-weather-related. In some cases, the deaths may be found to have had other causes.\u201d Dozens of locations in the West and Pacific Northwest tied or broke previous heat records in recent days, and more than 165 daily high temperature records could be tied or broken this week. A motorcyclist died Saturday in California\u2019s Death Valley from heat exposure, the\u00a0Death Valley National Park\u00a0said in a news release. The high temperature that day was 128 degrees Fahrenheit, according to preliminary data. Six motorcyclists were near Badwater Basin\u00a0when they became sick due to the heat,\u00a0the release said. In addition to the cyclist who died, one was transported to a hospital in Las Vegas and the other four were treated on scene. Rescue efforts were hampered due to the extreme heat at the park, as emergency medical flight helicopters cannot fly safely when it is over 120 degrees, the release noted. \u201cHeat illness and injury are cumulative and can build over the course of a day or days,\u201d the release said. \u201cBesides not being able to cool down while riding due to high ambient air temperatures, experiencing Death Valley by motorcycle when it is this hot is further challenged by the necessary heavy safety gear worn to reduce injuries during an accident.\u201d Heat is the\u00a0deadliest weather threat\u00a0in the United States, killing more than twice as many people each year on average than hurricanes and tornadoes combined. Record-high heat during a holiday weekend Death Valley was among a slew of places where daily temperature records were broken this Fourth of July weekend. On Saturday, Death Valley reached 128 degrees, breaking the daily record of 127 set on July 6, 2007. An excessive heat warning is in effect until late Wednesday evening for the area where temperatures are expected to be between 122 to 129 degrees. On the more-humid East Coast, temperatures above 100 degrees were also widespread, The Associated Press reported. Many areas in Northern California surpassed 110 degrees Sunday, while Phoenix, Arizona, set a new daily record for the warmest low temperature: it never got below 92 degrees. Las Vegas also made history, reaching a record high of 120 degrees on Sunday. Indiana resident Mark Kavacinski told CNN affiliate KVVU his family almost canceled their vacation to Las Vegas because of the intense heat. \u201cWe knew it was going to be hot. It\u2019s July, right? Did we know it was going to be this hot? No,\u201d Kavacinski said. \u201cBut we decided that heat\u2019s heat. We can handle it.\u201d Las Vegas temperatures have exceeded 110 degrees each day since Wednesday and are forecast to do so every day until at least next Sunday, which would mark a stretch of prolonged extreme heat longer than any ever experienced in the city, with 11 days or more above 110 degrees. Sunday\u2019s heat was enough to melt crayons, the weather service office in Las Vegas demonstrated on X. And parts of western Nevada and northeastern California won\u2019t see temperatures below 100 degrees until next weekend, the National Weather Service office in Reno said. Further north, Oregon\u2019s weekend scorcher broke many records. On Sunday, Salem hit 103 degrees, just over the city\u2019s 100-degree record from 1945, according to the National Weather Service office in Portland. Eugene also experienced temperatures of 103, breaking the 1945 record of 98 degrees. But some Oregonians told CNN affiliate KATU Sunday they would not miss the Portland Timbers soccer game, regardless of the heat. \u201cYeah, I know it\u2019s hot! It\u2019s 100, it\u2019s crazy. but the game here is greater,\u201d Tim Hueng of Tigard, Oregon told KATU as he waited in line to enter Providence Park. Even mountain destinations couldn\u2019t beat the heat. Reno, Nevada, saw a new daily record of 105 degrees on Sunday, the weather service office there announced. And on Monday, Reno reached 106, topping the 2017 record of 104. And despite its elevation of just over 6,000 feet, South Lake Tahoe hit 92 degrees Sunday, beating its daily record of 88 degrees. The high temperatures continued Monday, with the city seeing 91 degrees, breaking 2017\u2019s record of 89.

The Boeing 757-200 that lost its wheel completed its planned flight to Denver, where it safely landed, United said. No injuries were reported on the ground. Pilots of an Allegiant flight bound for Tulsa, Oklahoma, were the first to be heard on\u00a0LiveATC.net\u00a0reporting the wayward wheel as it bounced across runways and taxiways at LAX and radioed in their report to air traffic control. \u201cA tire came off that 75 that took off, we saw it rolling down past bravo seven, bravo eight,\u201d said the crew of Allegiant 2388. Other pilots chimed into air traffic control in real-time, with the crew of another flight saying the tire crossed a parallel runway. Another pilot radioed the wheel\u00a0had finally stopped near the airport\u2019s southwest corner, about three-quarters of a mile from where it was first seen rolling away. There were 174 customers and seven crewmembers on board, the airline said. \u201cThe wheel has been recovered in Los Angeles, and we are investigating what caused this event,\u201d the airline said in a statement. The Federal Aviation Administration is also investigating. The incident comes months after another United Airlines flight lost a wheel while taking off from San Francisco International Airport, damaging several cars in a parking lot. That plane, which was headed for Osaka, Japan, landed safely in Los Angeles, officials said at the time. No injuries were reported. The incident was one of at least a dozen involving United Airlines flights in March, according to a CNN analysis, prompting CEO Scott Kirby to send a\u00a0safety message to customers. At the time, he said the incidents were \u201cunrelated,\u201d but \u201chave our attention and have sharpened our focus.\u201d That same month, the FAA began a safety review of the airline, according to a memo from United. \u201cOver the next several weeks, we will begin to see more of an FAA presence in our operation as they begin to review some of our work processes, manuals and facilities,\u201d United said in a memo to employees obtained by CNN. The review means an \u201ceven closer look at multiple areas of our operation to ensure we are doing all we can to promote and drive safety compliance.\u201d In a statement at the time, the FAA said its \u201csafety assurance system routinely monitors all aspects of an airline\u2019s operation. It focuses\u00a0on an airline\u2019s compliance with applicable regulations; ability to identify hazards, assess and mitigate risk; and effectively manage safety.\u201d CNN\u2019s Gregory Wallace, Samantha Delouya, Taylor Romine and Sara Smart contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/09/us/united-plane-loses-wheel-takeoff/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/11/2024", "section": "us"}}

Foster County Emergency Management Director Andrew Kirking told CNN 911 was notified about the train derailment in the small town of Bordulac, about 140 miles northwest of Fargo, between 3:30 a.m. and 4 a.m. local time. Kirking said the train was carrying \u201cintact hazardous materials,\u201d so authorities have been monitoring air quality near the incident. Between 25 and 30 cars derailed. The North Dakota Department of Environmental Quality told CNN the train was carrying anhydrous ammonia, sulfur and methanol. Anhydrous ammonia, a gas widely used as a nitrogen-based fertilizer, can be extremely dangerous in high quantities, triggering explosions and causing dehydration and severe burns in humans, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In a\u00a0Facebook post, the department said it is monitoring the remediation and cleanup of the derailment. Kirking added local crews, including the Carrington Fire Department, regional hazardous material officials and Canadian Pacific also responded to the scene. Crews will work through the night Friday to extinguish the fires, cool the rail cars and remove hazardous material from them, Kirking said in a statement. They\u2019re also preparing the site for heavy equipment to remove the rail\u00a0cars. The county is working to keep residents safe, stabilize the incident and minimize environmental impact, Kirking said Friday night. Canadian Pacific Kansas City, the train operator, said in a statement provided Friday to CNN the company \u201cis continuing its comprehensive, coordinated response\u201d to the derailment in collaboration with local officials. The statement continued: \u201cCPKC response crews, including senior officers from our operations, environmental and hazardous materials teams, are on scene coordinating closely with emergency response officials. The safety of the public and emergency responders is CPKC\u2019s first priority.\u201d Crews are trying to bridge a gap over a bog to fight the fires and get heavy equipment to move the train cars, Kirking told CNN. They used two pumping trailers to douse the derailed\u00a0cars, he said. \u201cOur objective is to get the fire out in the next 12 to 18 hours,\u201d Kirking said. \u201cWe are starting to get a little water on it right now.\u201d Kirking said getting the train cars removed will be a bit more tedious and will likely take more than a week or two. He said all residents within a one-mile radius of the derailment were notified of the incident and potential hazards. Consequently, Kirking said, they have issued a voluntary evacuation. The cause of the derailment is still under investigation, he said, adding the engineer and conductor were the only people on board the train and they escaped safely. \u201cRight now, based on the elevation, we think that the spill material can be contained around those railroad tracks and will not impact any water source,\u201d Kirking said. Kirking said it is too early to tell if the hazardous material has leaked into any waterways, but an environmental crew is coming out to set up to prevent any pollution.

{"id": "2024_07_10_us_dwight-jackson-employment-discrimination-lawsuit-reaj", "text": "A Black man has filed an employment discrimination lawsuit against a hotel in Detroit, Michigan, alleging the hotel only offered him a job interview after he changed the name on his resume, according to a copy of the lawsuit obtained by CNN. Dwight Jackson filed the lawsuit against the Shinola Hotel on July 3, alleging he was denied a job when he applied as \u201cDwight Jackson,\u201d but later offered an interview when he changed his name to \u201cJohn Jebrowski.\u201d The lawsuit alleges Jackson was denied a job in \u201cviolation of Michigan Elliott Larsen Civil Rights Act.\u201d Between January and April 2024, Jackson, a 27-year-old Black man, applied to multiple positions at the Shinola Hotel in downtown Detroit, including a role in reception, according to the lawsuit. On its website, Shinola Hotel says it is a \u201cluxury\u201d hotel. Jackson\u2019s attorney, Jon Marko, provided CNN with a copy of Jackson\u2019s resume, which details consistent employment, including previous roles as a \u201cFront Desk Agent\u201d at Detroit\u2019s Marriott Westin Book Cadillac and David Whitney Hotel, which use the words luxury and luxurious to describe their respective hotels. \u201cMr. Jackson had applied for a job that he was eminently qualified for,\u201d Marko, a civil rights attorney, told CNN. However, Shinola Hotel did not offer Jackson an interview. After getting no response to his initial job applications, in April 2024 Jackson applied again, making one significant change to his application \u2014 his name. According to the lawsuit, Jackson applied to Shinola Hotel \u201ctwice for similar positions under a more readily apparent Caucasian name, with the alias \u2018John Jebrowski,\u2019\u201d using nearly identical resumes. The resumes have different dates of previous employment. He was offered multiple interviews within the same week, the lawsuit claims. The lawsuit alleges that \u201cJackson established that the Defendant\u2019s consideration of candidates was based on the racial appearance of the applicant\u2019s name.\u201d \u201cTo be denied a job in 2024 in your hometown, for the color of your skin, goes beyond dollars and cents. It goes into the psyche of a person,\u201d Marko said. Sage Hospitality Group is Shinola Hotel\u2019s operating partner. Anna Stancioff, Sage Hospitality\u2019s Senior Corporate Director of PR & Brand Communications and spokesperson for the hotel said in an email Tuesday, \u201cWe take this allegation very seriously and do not tolerate discrimination of any kind. We are committed to fostering an inclusive workplace where everyone has the opportunity to succeed and are dedicated to building a diverse workforce that reflects the community.\u201d According to Marko, Jackson attended the job interview and confronted the interviewer at Shinola Hotel. He revealed his real identity and expressed his belief that he was not given an interview initially because his name appeared more traditionally African American. \u201cShortly after Jackson underwent the interview process, he was informed that he was no longer a viable candidate for the position,\u201d the lawsuit states. Marko said employment discrimination is not unusual. He added, as a civil rights attorney, \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a lot of discrimination in hiring, especially when it comes to the exclusion of minorities and individuals who have minority-sounding names.\u201d A recent\u00a0study published by the National Bureau of Economic Research\u00a0found that name bias is a prevalent issue in the hiring process. Researchers sent out identical resumes to 108 U.S. employers to analyze whether race and gender affected callback rates for job applications. Resumes with Black male and Black female names received the fewest callbacks. But, Marko said, proving cases of name bias is extremely challenging and most of these cases never get off the ground due to a lack of evidence. Jackson\u2019s case is different, he said, because he applied twice for similar positions with nearly the exact same resume and it yielded different results when he used the alias. Marko said Jackson \u201cwants to shed light on this problem that\u2019s not just isolated at the Shinola Hotel, not just isolated in Detroit or Michigan, but across the country. He wants to make sure that it doesn\u2019t happen to anyone else.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/10/us/dwight-jackson-employment-discrimination-lawsuit-reaj/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/11/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_07_10_us_dartmouth-student-death-won-jang", "text": "The hourslong disappearance, then confirmed death of a Dartmouth College fraternity member has police investigating the case as a possible hazing incident. The Ivy League school has suspended the 20-year-old\u2019s Greek organization, as well as a sorority. Won Jang, a member of Beta Alpha Omega, had last been seen by friends around 9:30 p.m., Saturday, at an informal social gathering at docks near the Dartmouth boathouse on the Connecticut River, the New Hampshire Fish and Game Department said in a news release. When he didn\u2019t show up for an event the next day, authorities were notified, the agency said. Items found near the dock indicated Jang hadn\u2019t left the river area, which authorities searched while divers checked the water. About 3 1/2 hours after Jang was reported missing, his body was found in the Connecticut River by an underwater camera not far from the dock where he last was seen, the department said. While a cause of death remains unclear, the school forwarded to the nearby Hanover Police Department anonymous emails indicating hazing or alcohol may have contributed to Jang\u2019s death, Hanover Police Chief Charlie Dennis said during a Monday news conference. \u201cCertainly this is a tragic event,\u201d he said, asking anyone with information to come forward to help with the investigation. Hanover Police did not immediately reply to CNN\u2019s request for more information about the case. Jang had been a member of Dartmouth\u2019s chapter of Beta Alpha Omega, according to the college and his profile on the fraternity\u2019s website, which has been taken down. As Hanover police investigate his death, Dartmouth suspended the Beta Alpha Omega fraternity, along with the Alpha Phi sorority, college spokesperson Morgan Kelly told CNN on Wednesday. Kelly would not say what role the fraternity or sorority played relative to the investigation into Jang\u2019s death. \u201cWe aren\u2019t able to provide details on an ongoing investigation, but we can say that at the time of the incident, Beta Alpha Omega was on alcohol probation following a fall-, winter- and spring-term suspension. Alpha Phi was placed on alcohol probation during the fall 2023 term and then returned to good standing,\u201d Kelly added. Beta Alpha Omega\u2019s local chapter and Alpha Phi\u2019s national organization did not immediately respond to CNN\u2019s requests for comment. Jang\u2019s death and the police probe follow a spate of hazing deaths in recent years on or near US college campuses that have led variously to suspensions, expulsions, criminal charges and scrutiny of university oversight of fraternities and sororities. Seventy-three percent of students in US fraternities and sororities experienced what they called some form of hazing at least once, according to a\u00a0University of Maine study\u00a0released in 2008, the most recent available for such research. Jang\u2019s death comes nearly two months after another Dartmouth student\u2019s body was found in the Connecticut River after she was reported missing, CNN affiliate WMUR reported. Their deaths do not appear to be connected. An \u2018amazing guy\u2019 who was always smiling Jang had been studying biomedical engineering and economics at Dartmouth and worked part-time at the school\u2019s DALI Lab, a startup-like experiential learning program where students work in teams of designers and developers, according to his LinkedIn profile. \u201cWon wholeheartedly embraced opportunities at Dartmouth to pursue his academic and personal passions,\u201d Dean Scott C. Brown wrote on a site memorializing school community members who have died. \u201cWe are in contact with Won\u2019s family and have expressed our sincere condolences at this most difficult time,\u201d he continued. Kledian Marinaj, a friend of Jang who recently had been trying to make plans to grab a meal with him, was upset by his death, he told CNN affiliate WMUR. \u201cWon was always an amazing guy,\u201d Marinaj said. \u201cI don\u2019t think there was ever a time when I didn\u2019t see him with a smile on his face.\u201d Jang had been his high school valedictorian in Middletown, Delaware, according to his LinkedIn profile and YouTube recording of the graduation ceremony. During an introduction to his speech at commencement, he was praised by an administrator for his wit, humility and motivation.

{"id": "2024_07_10_politics_democratic-fears-biden-landslide-analysis", "text": "President Joe Biden and his advisers keep issuing unequivocal declarations that he\u2019s staying in the 2024 race, but Democrats aren\u2019t hearing it. \u201cIt\u2019s up to the president to decide if he is going to run. We\u2019re all encouraging him to make that decision because time is running short,\u201d former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Wednesday on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe,\u201d repeating her position of a week ago as if Biden had not made any declaration at all. \u201cSpeaker\u00a0Pelosi\u00a0fully supports whatever President Biden decides to do,\u201d a spokesperson said in a subsequent statement. But the comments from such a senior member of the party had already essentially reopened the debate about whether Biden should go. Vermont Sen. Peter Welch on Wednesday evening became the first Democratic senator \u2014 and the 10th congressional Democrat \u2014 to call for Biden to step aside as the nominee, writing in a Washington Post op-ed, \u201cThe stakes could not be higher.\u201d That all came on the heels of Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet on Tuesday evening voicing the concerns other Democrats have shared privately. \u201cDonald Trump is on track, I think, to win this election, and maybe win it by a landslide, and take with him the Senate and the House,\u201d he told CNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins. Another Democrat, Rep. Adam Smith from Washington, agreed with that landslide assessment and implored Biden to reconsider. \u201cDon\u2019t let this be your legacy, that you refused to step down and got him back in the White House,\u201d Smith said, referring to Trump, during an interview with CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer on \u201cthe Situation Room.\u201d And New York Rep. Ritchie Torres \u2014 a member of the Congressional Black Caucus, which has been strongly supportive of Biden \u2014 put the potential down-ballot effects of a Biden candidacy bluntly. \u201cIf we are going on a political\u00a0suicide\u00a0mission, then we should at least be honest about it,\u201d he told CNN. Clooney: step aside to \u2018save\u2019 democracy George Clooney, the actor and Democratic fundraiser, is a Biden ally who spent time with him in Los Angeles and cohosted a record-breaking fundraiser for the president\u2019s campaign recently. The Biden that disastrously appeared on the debate stage is the same one that he saw in California, Clooney wrote in The New York Times on Wednesday. Now he argues that Biden needs to step aside so that capable Democrats can come forward to compete for the nomination or face losing control of the entire government. Democrats have been so \u201cterrified\u201d of a second Trump term that they ignored warning signs about Biden during the primary, Clooney said. \u201cJoe Biden is a hero; he saved democracy in 2020. We need him to do it again in 2024,\u201d Clooney wrote, appealing to Biden\u2019s sense of duty. He\u2019s not the only bold-faced Hollywood name raising the alarm. Rob Reiner and Michael Douglas, both Democratic fundraisers, are also on the record. And there are other fundraising concerns: Organizers for at least one Chicago fundraiser scheduled during the Democratic National Convention have decided to not to proceed with the mid-August event, a source with knowledge of the discussions told CNN. A test every day Biden told ABC\u2019s George Stephanopoulos during a high-stakes interview last week that he doesn\u2019t need to take a cognitive test and prove his fitness to lead because every day in the presidency is a cognitive test. That\u2019s going to be Biden\u2019s curse going forward. No matter how many fiery teleprompter speeches he gives, he likely won\u2019t be able to suddenly walk without shuffling or talk in conversation with the steadiness he once did. The next of his daily tests will come Thursday, when the president conducts a rare solo news conference at the conclusion of a NATO meeting taking place in Washington. Biden should be talking about his successful efforts to expand the treaty organization and mobilize it to stand up to Russia, but instead he will face question after question about his fitness to do the job. Stephanopoulos, by the way, who spent time in direct contact with the president, told a passerby secretly recording him on a New York City street that he doesn\u2019t think Biden can serve another four years. Next week, Biden will sit down with \u201cNBC Nightly News\u201d anchor Lester Holt for an interview that will tape and air\u00a0Monday, the network announced Fear of a \u2018landslide\u2019 Bennet, the Colorado Democrat, became the first senator in his party to publicly say he doesn\u2019t believe Biden is capable of winning reelection. Sens. Sherrod Brown and Jon Tester \u2014 the two most vulnerable senators facing reelection \u2014 also said Biden would not win during a meeting in the Capitol, according to a source familiar, CNN reported Tuesday. \u201cIt\u2019s a moral question about the future of our country,\u201d Bennet said on CNN. \u201cAnd I think it\u2019s critically important, for us, to come to grips with what we face, if together, we put this country on the path of electing Donald Trump again.\u201d He continued: \u201cThe White House, in the time since that disastrous debate, I think, has done nothing to really demonstrate that they have a plan to win this election.\u201d Democrats are already in a difficult position in the race to control the Senate, since they are defending a larger number of seats than Republicans this cycle. About a third of the Senate is up for election every two years. CNN\u2019s senior political analyst Ronald Brownstein argued Tuesday that a Biden loss could cost Democrats the Senate, which would reverberate for decades since it would give aging conservative justices on the Supreme Court, like Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, cover to resign and solidify the court\u2019s conservative majority. Trump is currently ahead CNN\u2019s Road to 270 assessment of the electoral map shows Trump in position to win the election. Georgia, Michigan and Nevada \u2014 all states that Biden won in 2020 \u2014 are all leaning toward Republicans. If Trump wins those three state and all the states he won in 2020, he would have 272 electoral votes, enough to win the election. CNN Senior data reporter Harry Enten said polling clearly shows Trump is ahead at this point. But he notes that polling this far from the election does not generally represent the final vote. \u201cWhen we\u2019re looking at this data we should keep in mind that it\u2019s still just July and the election is in November,\u201d he told CNN\u2019s Jim Acosta. \u201cSo we\u2019ll just have to wait and see how things shift as things go on from here.\u201d Is Biden hearing this? The Democratic leader in the House, Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, has publicly backed Biden, but he has told nervous lawmakers he will take their concerns to the White House, according to CNN\u2019s Annie Grayer and Manu Raju. But Jeffries\u00a0brushed off questions about whether Biden is the most effective nominee and said he has no plans to meet with him on Wednesday. \u201cOver the last few days, the members of the House Democratic Caucus have had conversations that are candid, constructive and clear-eyed about the path forward, which primarily includes doing everything we can to make sure that we take back the majority in November of this year,\u201d he told reporters on his way into a meeting with the Congressional Black Caucus. Some Democrats want to move on from this debate, worrying that it only boosts Trump. \u201cDonald Trump and the Republicans have loved every minute of watching this discussion,\u201d Rep. Debbie Dingell, who represents the battleground state of Michigan, told CNN\u2019s Jessica Dean.

Dashawn Watkins, 29, has been charged with first degree murder, aggravated assault, abuse of\u00a0a\u00a0corpse,\u00a0and tampering with evidence in connection with the death of 14-year-old Pauly Likens of Sharon, Pennsylvania, police said in a complaint filed in Mercer County District Court. CNN has reached out to Watkins\u2019 attorney for comment\u00a0but has not yet received a response.\u00a0If\u00a0convicted,\u00a0Watkins could face the death penalty or life in prison, according to Pennsylvania state law. Mercer County District Attorney Peter C. Acker told CNN at this point investigators have not found any evidence that suggests Likens\u2019 murder was a hate crime. However, investigators are also not ruling out the possibility, and if anyone has evidence that would suggest this is a hate crime, he said, authorities will investigate it. Likens\u2019\u00a0relatives had been searching for the teen for several days when police began finding dismembered human remains in and near the Shenango River Lake in Mercer County, the criminal complaint said. Mercer County Coroner John A. Libonati said in a July 3 statement the remains belonged to\u00a0Likens. The cause of death was determined to be sharp force trauma to the head and the manner was ruled as homicide, Libonati said. Pamela Ladner, president of\u00a0LGBTQIA+ Alliance Shenango Valley who spoke on behalf of\u00a0the teen\u2019s\u00a0family, told CNN\u00a0Likens \u201cwas a selfless, loving child who loved nature, getting her nails done, and shopping.\u201d \u201cShe aspired to be a\u00a0park\u00a0ranger like her Aunt Liz,\u201d\u00a0Ladner said.\u00a0\u201cOur community is mourning with Pauly\u2019s family at this tragic loss of young life. We are hoping justice is served.\u201d Likens\u00a0was last seen walking home on June 22 after leaving a friend\u2019s house, police said in the complaint.\u00a0In the early hours of June 23, the teenager posted on Snapchat that she had gone on a late-night walk. She replied\u00a0initially\u00a0when her friend asked if she was OK but did not reply to further messages, the complaint said. Video surveillance from\u00a0nearby\u00a0businesses and homes showed a person that appeared to be Likens\u00a0walking near a canoe launch along the Shenango River in Sharon, as well as a vehicle arriving and leaving the area around the same time on June 23, according to the complaint. Police said Watkins, the suspect, was seen in video footage leaving a nearby apartment complex with a large duffel bag that appeared empty and returning about 20 to 25 minutes later with the bag looking \u201cheavy and awkward,\u201d the complaint says.\u00a0Video shows a vehicle leaving the apartment complex, arriving to the canoe launch area and returning to the complex during the same time frame,\u00a0the complaint states. The footage shows Watkins struggling to carry the duffle bag and placing it on the floor\u00a0of a hallway in the building, and then again\u00a0before entering an apartment, the complaint said. He\u2019s also seen coming to the apartment later that day with a shopping bag and leaving with multiple bags\u00a0and garbage bags\u00a0the next day. When officers went to the building, they saw what appeared to be blood stains in the places where Watkins rested the bag on the floor, the complaint said. When Watkins was detained by police on July 2, he told authorities that he recently met with a person he had met on Grindr,\u00a0who\u00a0police said matched\u00a0Likens\u2019\u00a0description, according to the complaint. Watkins claimed his memory was poor when asked about where they met or where he had gone, the complaint said. He said the person did not come to his apartment and noted that he brought in a large rolling luggage\u00a0bag\u00a0that he had left in his car from a recent vacation, the complaint said.\u00a0When police searched Watkins\u2019\u00a0apartment, they found\u00a0traces of\u00a0blood,\u00a0a saw, and a receipt for the purchase of the tool, the complaint said. \u00a0 A candlelight vigil for\u00a0Likens\u00a0will be held in Sharon on Saturday.\u00a0The teenager is being remembered for her will to help others, her love of animals and her \u201ccontagious laughter,\u201d according to her obituary. \u201cPauly lit up every room she entered, always making people smile and passing around her contagious laughter.

{"id": "2024_07_08_us_chicago-shootings-july-fourth-weekend", "text": "Gun violence is down across America this year but it peaks every summer and Chicago\u2019s Fourth of July weekend bore the data out, with 109 people shot, including 19 fatally, police said in a Monday news conference. All of the victims were boys and men ranging in age from 16 to 36 years old, according to police records. This year\u2019s violent holiday weekend comes as the city and the nation have seen a drop in gun violence in recent years. As of June 24, Chicago had seen 1,105 shooting incidents so far this year, a 6% reduction from the same time last year and a 12% reduction over the past two years. The city had seen 271 gun deaths as of June 24, a 12% reduction since the same time last year and 16% reduction of the past two years, according to data from the Chicago Police Department. Last year over the long holiday weekend, 57 people were shot and eight were killed between Friday, June 30 at 6 p.m. and Tuesday, July 4 at 11:59 p.m., according to Chicago police. July 4 is the peak day for mass shootings in the US, more than any other single calendar day over roughly a decade, a 2023 CNN analysis of the Gun Violence Archive\u2019s mass shooting data since 2014\u00a0found. The day with the second most shootings was July 5. Gun violence is a \u2018societal issue\u2019 In the United States, law enforcement statistics and independent researchers have continually pointed to summer months as a time of increased gun violence, with July 1-7 being an especially violent period each year for both mass shootings and individual incidents. Heat, experts say, can elevate discomfort and aggression\u00a0\u2013 a potential catalyst for violence at a time\u00a0kids are out of school\u00a0and warmer weather drives\u00a0more people outdoors\u00a0in a country with\u00a0more guns than people. \u201cWhen we look at what happened this weekend, we always like to say that it\u2019s a police issue,\u201d Chicago Police Department Superintendent Larry Snelling said at the news conference. \u201cThis is a societal issue. The police cannot be in everybody\u2019s backyard. They cannot be in everyone\u2019s home. They cannot invade every single gathering where there\u2019s a possibility that someone may show up with a gun.\u201d \u201cEveryone needs to be involved in this, this cannot just be the police department alone,\u201d he added. On Friday, after dozens of people had already been shot in Chicago, Mayor Brandon Johnson released a statement addressing the violence. \u201cWe are devastated by the recent violence that has left our city in a state of grief and we extend our heartfelt condolences to the families and communities impacted by these recent events,\u201d Johnson said in the statement. \u201cThe City of Chicago is committed to ensuring the safety of all residents and visitors.\u201d The city had canceled time off for police officers to \u201cmaximize presence and ensure prompt incident response,\u201d activated an emergency services assistance center to provide  support to people in the community and would hold a community rally Friday afternoon to \u201cpromote bonding, support, and healing,\u201d according to Johnson. But the efforts did not end the shootings. Snelling urged public cooperation and tips to lead detectives to suspects, especially those who \u201cmake the choice\u201d to shoot women and children. \u201cThose people have to be taken off the street,\u201d Snelling implored. \u201cThey have to be put away. If we\u2019re not doing that, then we\u2019re failing other families. We\u2019re failing people in our city.\u201d One of those killed over the weekend was an 8-year-old-boy who was shot alongside two other boys, ages 5 and 8, according to the Chicago Police Department\u2019s online records. Several 15- to 16-year-olds were also among those shot over the weekend, police say. In another instance, eight people between the ages of 18 and 74 suffered gunshot wounds and in a separate incident, seven people aged 15 to 40 years old were shot. The 40-year-old died, according to the police department. Officers are training for the upcoming Democratic National Convention next month to be better prepared for potential protests or civil unrest, Snelling said. \u201cAlong with that, we have been working on a neighborhood plan to make sure that we\u2019re not pulling resources that are necessary to keep our neighborhoods safe to place down and around the footprint of the DNC,\u201d he said. \u201cGenerations of disinvestment and deep disenfranchisement\u201d have led to the state of violence within the city, Johnson said during Monday\u2019s news conference. He is pushing for more federal resources to increase intervention and prevention of gun violence, including \u201cmore boots on the ground\u201d to help get illegal guns off the streets. \u201cWe are going block to block, neighborhood by neighborhood, to make sure that the city is safe and ultimately stop this violence,\u201d said Johnson. \u201cThese are not just numbers on pages.

The filing seeks an order from the court that would prevent the state from\u00a0requiring public schools to\u00a0display\u00a0posters of the\u00a0Ten Commandments in all classrooms or implementing any other statute from the new law. That\u00a0lawsuit,\u00a0filed last month in federal\u00a0court, contends that the legislation\u00a0violates both US Supreme Court precedent and the First Amendment. House Bill 71, signed by Republican Gov. Jeff Landry in June, mandates that by January 1, 2025, a poster-sized display of a state-approved version of the Ten Commandments with \u201clarge, easily readable font\u201d be put in every classroom from kindergarten through the university-level at state-funded schools. Last month, Oklahoma State Superintendent of Public Instruction Ryan Walters issued a memo requiring that schools in the state incorporate the Bible and the Ten Commandments into their curriculum, calling the Bible an \u201cindispensable historical and cultural touchstone.\u201d The memo came after the state\u2019s Supreme Court blocked an effort to establish the first publicly funded religious charger school in the country, CNN previously reported. Plaintiffs in the Louisiana lawsuit argued mandating that the Ten Commandments be displayed in every classroom renders them \u201cunavoidable\u201d and \u201cunconstitutionally pressures students into religious observance, veneration, and adoption of the state\u2019s favored religious scripture.\u201d \u201cIt also sends the harmful and religiously divisive message that students who do not subscribe to the Ten Commandments \u2014 or, more precisely, to the specific version of the Ten Commandments that H.B. 71 requires schools to display \u2014 do not belong in their own school community and should refrain from expressing any faith practices of beliefs that are not aligned with the state\u2019s religious preferences,\u201d the complaint continues. The lawsuit\u00a0was\u00a0brought by the American Civil Liberties Union, the ACLU of Louisiana, Americans United for Separation of Church and State, and the Freedom From Religion Foundation,\u00a0on behalf of nine \u201cmulti-faith families\u201d with students enrolled in Louisiana public schools. It names state Superintendent of Education Cade Brumley, several other Louisiana State Board of Elementary and Secondary Education officials, and some local school boards. When asked about the lawsuit, Brumley told CNN in a statement last month that he looked forward to implementing the law. \u201cThe Ten Commandments law passed with overwhelming support in Louisiana\u2019s state legislature and was enthusiastically signed by our Governor,\u201d he said. \u201cI look forward to implementing the law and defending Louisiana\u2019s sovereign interest to select classroom content fundamental to America\u2019s foundation.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/08/us/louisiana-ten-commandments-plaintiffs-lawsuit-reaj/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/11/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_07_09_us_dvontaye-mitchell-milwaukee-death", "text": "The death of a Black man after he was pinned to the ground by security guards at a Wisconsin hotel last month\u00a0is being investigated as a homicide, as members of his family\u00a0and their attorneys on Wednesday called for criminal charges and marched to the hotel in protest of the fatal encounter that was partly captured on video. Dvontaye Mitchell, 43, was at the downtown Hyatt Regency in Milwaukee on June 30, when police allege he \u201ccaused a disturbance,\u201d prompting security guards to escort him out of the hotel, a statement from Mitchell family attorney Ben Crump said. Part of a video posted on social media shows security guards and others pinning Mitchell to the ground. Mitchell can be heard grunting and pleading with the guards, repeatedly saying \u201cplease\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d One of the guards, who appears to be White, can be heard saying \u201cstay down,\u201d and \u201cstop fighting,\u201d as the others, who appear to be people of color, hold Mitchell down, the video shows. The same guard is heard calling out to witnesses, \u201cThis is what happens when you go into the ladies room.\u201d At a news conference Wednesday, Crump and other attorneys for Mitchell\u2019s family described what they said were portions of bystander and hotel security footage that showed Mitchell running away from security, later being shoved to the ground outside, where he was held down, beaten and kicked. CNN has not seen the footage. \u201cThis was outrageous and one of the most disgusting things that I\u2019ve seen in 15 years of practice as an attorney,\u201d said William Sulton, who is also representing the family. Mitchell\u2019s family planned to hold a candlelight vigil outside the hotel Wednesday evening. \u201cTo see him go out this world the way he did, that was devastating. That would never leave my mind, that\u2019s going to live with me for the rest of my life,\u201d Mitchell\u2019s mother, Brenda Giles, told reporters Wednesday. It\u2019s unclear what led up to Mitchell\u2019s encounter with the security guards, how long it took police officers to arrive on the scene, and what Mitchell was doing at the hotel. When officers arrived, Mitchell was unresponsive and pronounced dead despite lifesaving measures, Milwaukee Police told CNN on Tuesday without mentioning Mitchell by name. Crump said his office had obtained an affidavit from an unidentified hotel employee who claimed he reluctantly helped hold down Mitchell after being ordered to do so by a security guard. Crump said he would turn the document over to prosecutors but did not release it publicly. The local prosecutor is investigating Mitchell\u2019s death as a homicide, he said. \u201cMr. Mitchell\u2019s death is a tragedy, and we extend our deepest condolences to his family,\u201d said Milwaukee County District Attorney John Chisholm said in a statement Wednesday. Prosecutors met and briefed an attorney for Mitchell\u2019s family on the investigation and shared video footage and other evidence,\u00a0Chisholm said. Prosecutors were awaiting full autopsy results that Chisholm said will \u201callow our office to comprehensively evaluate the actions leading up to Mr. Mitchell\u2019s death from the perspective of potential criminal liability.\u201d \u201cAll aspects of these actions, including Mr. Mitchell\u2019s death and the use of force by hotel personnel, will be closely examined,\u201d Chisholm said. The preliminary manner of death for Mitchell is homicide, Karen Domagalski from the Milwaukee County Medical Examiner\u2019s Office told CNN on Tuesday, but the final manner is yet to be determined. \u201cThe cause and manner of death is pending toxicology and further investigation, Domagalski said. \u201cWe do not have a timeline for when this case will be finalized.\u201d The encounter comes as the use of force\u00a0\u2013 particularly\u00a0against people of color\u00a0\u2013\u00a0by police and others in authority roles remains under scrutiny nearly four years after protests flared nationwide following the murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer. Now, every time Mitchell\u2019s children turn on the TV, they are reminded of how their father died, DeAsia Harmon, Mitchell\u2019s widow, told CNN affiliate WTMJ on Monday. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t even go into the grocery store with my daughter without her being afraid of the security standing at the door,\u201d Harmon said. \u201cShe said, \u2018is all security bad or just the ones who murdered my dad.\u2019\u201d The security guards involved in the incident have been suspended. Aimbridge Hospitality, which operates the downtown Hyatt Regency Milwaukee, is still completing its investigation, a Hyatt spokesperson told CNN on Monday. \u201cWe extend our heartfelt condolences to Dvontaye Mitchell\u2019s family, all those who knew and loved him, and the Milwaukee community in light of this tragedy,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cAs the investigation continues, Hyatt is fully committed to supporting efforts to help ensure accountability for the circumstances that led to the death of Dvontaye Mitchell.\u201d In a statement Wednesday, Hyatt said it joined Mitchell\u2019s family \u201cin their calls for transparency, accountability and justice for this senseless tragedy.\u201d \u201cWe believe that the employees of Aimbridge Hospitality who were involved should be terminated and that criminal charges should be filed,\u201d the company said. Milwaukee Police are not considering the incident as a criminal investigation because there isn\u2019t any evidence of \u201cblunt force,\u201d according to Crump. \u201cIt is unacceptable that this case is not being considered a criminal investigation despite the fatal outcome, which the medical examiner considers a homicide,\u201d Crump said in a statement Wednesday. There\u2019s no timeline for a charging decision at the moment, the Milwaukee\u00a0County\u00a0District Attorney\u2019s office told CNN on Tuesday. \u2018To know him is to love him\u2019 Giles said her eldest son was a jolly and outgoing brother, uncle and father who loved his family, she told WTMJ. \u201cEverybody that knows him, to know him is to love him, they know,\u201d his sister, Nayisha Mitchell told the station. \u201cThey knew he was a good person.\u201d Mitchell loved music and art, his mother told reporters Wednesday. He loved walking and cooking. \u201cHe loved to dance, and he was harmless. I always called him my big teddy bear,\u201d Giles said. When Mitchell\u2019s father passed away in 2016, Mitchell fell into depression, his family told WTMJ. Giles believes her son was suffering from a mental health episode at the time of the incident, according to Crump. Shawn Moore, a witness who recorded parts of the interaction, told WTMJ he wishes he had done more. \u201cWhat I ended up capturing was another Black man in Milwaukee dealing with mental issues losing his life over nothing,\u201d he said. Family and friends held a vigil for Mitchell over the weekend outside the downtown Hyatt Regency echoing similar sentiments of calls for justice. CNN\u2019s Ray Sanchez, Sara Smart and Rebekah Riess contributed to this report.\ufeff", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/09/us/dvontaye-mitchell-milwaukee-death/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/11/2024", "section": "us"}}

{"id": "2024_07_10_politics_fact-check-biden-campaign-j-d-vance-heritage-foundation", "text": "In two social media posts on Tuesday, President Joe Biden\u2019s campaign distorted a quote from Republican Sen. J.D. Vance of Ohio to inaccurately make it seem as if Vance had been praising a conservative think tank\u2019s\u00a0Project 2025\u00a0initiative and expressing support for a nationwide abortion ban and cuts to Social Security. Both of the\u00a0\u201cBiden-Harris HQ\u201d\u00a0posts on X, formerly known as Twitter, included a nine-second video of Vance \u2013 a\u00a0possible Republican vice presidential candidate\u00a0\u2013 saying the following in a 2023 speech:\u00a0\u201cI want to thank especially Kevin Roberts and all of the Heritage Foundation for 50 years of incredible work on conservative policy.\u201d\u00a0Roberts is the president of the think tank. In\u00a0one of the posts, the \u201cBiden-Harris HQ\u201d account claimed that the video showed Vance complimenting Project 2025 in particular.\u00a0Project 2025\u00a0is an extensive Heritage Foundation blueprint for how former President Donald Trump, if elected again, could radically reshape the executive branch and implement right-wing policies. The Biden campaign claimed in\u00a0the other post\u00a0that the video showed Vance praising two unpopular policy proposals. The post said: \u201cTrump VP contender JD Vance thanks Project 2025 leaders for their \u2018incredible work\u2019 of creating a plan for Trump to ban abortion nationwide and cut Social Security.\u201d Facts First:\u00a0Both of the Biden campaign posts are false.\u00a0The full video\u00a0of Vance\u2019s speech to the Heritage Foundation shows that he did not mention Project 2025, abortion, or Social Security at all; the 2023 speech was almost entirely about foreign policy, with a dash of criticism of progressives. And the Biden campaign misleadingly edited the Vance sentence it purported to quote, using ellipses to omit the fact that Vance was broadly praising the Heritage Foundation\u2019s work over the last five decades rather than endorsing any particular recent initiative or proposal. The Biden campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesday. An edited quote The Biden campaign edited Vance\u2019s quote to make it read as follows:\u00a0\u201cI want to thank especially Kevin Roberts and all the Heritage Foundation for\u2026 incredible work on [our] policy.\u201d That\u2019s a distortion. Here, again, is what Vance actually said: \u201cI want to thank especially Kevin Roberts and all of the Heritage Foundation for 50 years of incredible work on conservative policy.\u201d So the Biden campaign removed the words \u201c50 years of\u201d and \u201cconservative,\u201d and added the word \u201cour,\u201d to make it sound like Vance was conveying praise of current policies Vance himself had adopted \u2013 rather than general praise for Heritage\u2019s decades of contributions to the conservative movement. What Project 2025 says and what Vance says\u00a0 Vance did\u00a0say\u00a0near the beginning of the speech that the Heritage Foundation \u201cis going to play a major role in helping us figure out how to govern, at the White House, at the Senate, at the House and all across our great country.\u201d But the full Project 2025\u00a0policy document, a 920-page tome called \u201cMandate for Leadership: The Conservative Promise,\u201d was\u00a0not released until the day after Vance\u2019s speech, which he delivered on April 20, 2023. That Project 2025 policy document\u00a0barely mentions Social Security, let alone makes significant proposals on the subject. On abortion, the policy document calls for the Justice Department to enforce a law, first\u00a0passed in the 19th century, that criminalizes the mailing of abortion pills and any other items used in abortions. Critics have\u00a0warned\u00a0that strict enforcement of this law could create a de facto national abortion ban without requiring Congress to pass new legislation. On NBC this past weekend, Vance said he supported the recent Supreme Court decision that allowed abortion medication mifepristone to continue to be mailed to patients without an in-person visit to a doctor. On CBS in May 2024, he\u00a0avoided taking a position\u00a0when asked what minimum national standard on abortion he would support, nodding toward Trump\u2019s stated position that abortion policy will be determined by individual states. Vance is opposed to abortion; on the website for his 2022 campaign for the Senate, he\u00a0declared himself\u00a0\u201c100 percent pro-life\u201d and called for \u201celiminating abortion.\u201d However, he\u00a0said\u00a0on CNN in December 2023: \u201cWe have to accept that people do not want blanket abortion bans. They just don\u2019t. And I say that as a person who wants to protect as many unborn babies as possible. We have to provide exceptions for life of the mother, for rape, and so forth.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/10/politics/fact-check-biden-campaign-j-d-vance-heritage-foundation/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/11/2024", "section": "us"}}

The jury delivered a speedy conviction, finding Hwang guilty on 10 of 11 criminal counts after beginning deliberations Tuesday afternoon. Hwang\u2019s co-defendant and deputy, Patrick Halligan, was also found guilty The criminal conviction comes after prosecutors said Hwang\u2019s family office Archegos (which operated similarly to a hedge fund) lied to banks to conceal massive stock purchases and artificially inflated the stocks\u2019 value. Hwang\u2019s firm\u2019s positions in stocks like ViacomCBS, Tencent and Discovery (now Warner Bros.

Alvin Bragg\u2019s\u00a0office is working with alleged victims whose claims of forcible rape and sexual abuse against the 72-year-old\u00a0disgraced\u00a0former Hollywood producer still fall within the statute of limitations, prosecutor Nicole Blumberg told the court. Blumberg said prosecutors could realistically go to trial in November against Weinstein,\u00a0whose downfall over similar claims became a symbol of the #MeToo movement. Some of the alleged victims had been not willing to participate in the legal process at the time of Weinstein\u2019s first trial, the prosecutor said. \u201cAs we said in 2020, some women were not ready. These women are now ready,\u201d Blumberg said The New York Court of Appeals\u00a0ruled this year\u00a0that the testimony of \u201cprior bad acts\u201d witnesses should not have been allowed in the trial that led to Weinstein\u2019s 2020 conviction of first-degree criminal sexual act and third-degree rape because it \u201cwas unnecessary to establish defendant\u2019s intent and served only to establish defendant\u2019s propensity to commit the crimes charged.\u201d He was sentenced to\u00a023 years in prison\u00a0and has maintained his innocence and denied any nonconsensual sexual activity. Prosecutors in New York had in May indicated their plans to seek a new indictment but said Tuesday they have yet to do so. Weinstein\u2019s lawyers must be notified when that happens because the defense team plans to present a case to the grand jury that might include testimony from Weinstein himself. Defense attorney Arthur Aidala accused the DA\u2019s office of delaying tactics at the hearing, telling state Judge Curtis Farber, \u201cThey have a defendant and they\u2019re out there looking for a crime.\u201d Aidala said Weinstein is \u201cbegging\u201d his attorneys to get this matter done quickly and wants to go to trial in September as initially discussed at the first hearing after Weinstein\u2019s 2020 conviction was vacated by New York\u2019s highest court. He\u00a0has remained behind bars because he was sentenced last year in Los Angeles to\u00a016 years in prison on charges\u00a0of rape and sexual assault \u2013 a trial that similarly used \u201cprior bad acts\u201d witnesses and has also been appealed. The defense attorney said Tuesday that Weinstein is suffering in solitary confinement at Rikers Island after being removed from a hospital setting. According to his lawyer, Weinstein is not getting any treatment for his health issues, including fluid in his heart and his lungs, Spinal Stenosis, macular degeneration in his eyes and diabetes. CNN has reached out to Rikers and the Bureau of Prisons on his claims. Weinstein\u2019s attorneys have consented to Weinstein remaining in custody in New York pending the retrial despite his vacated conviction because he could alternatively be transferred to California to serve a prison sentence for his rape conviction there.

{"id": "2024_07_10_us_virginia-school-cell-phone-restrictions-youngkin", "text": "Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin issued a new executive order Tuesday that will limit or ban cell phone use in public schools \u2013 the latest in a string of efforts by officials to crack down on what many see as a classroom distraction and a threat to students\u2019 mental health. The order by Youngkin, a Republican, directs the Virginia Department of Education to establish guidelines for a cell phone-free education, the governor\u2019s office said in a news release. The new policies are to be implemented in schools by January 1, 2025, with a draft of guidelines expected by August 15 and final guidance issued in September. Youngkin called the order an \u201cessential action\u201d that would \u201cpromote a healthier and more focused educational environment\u201d for the more than 1.2 million students served by the Virginia Department of Education as of the 2023-2024 academic year. \u201cCreating cell phone and social media-free educational environments in Virginia\u2019s K-12 education system will benefit students, parents, and educators,\u201d\u00a0Youngkin said in the release. \u201cToday\u2019s Executive Order both establishes the clear goal to protect the health and safety of our students by limiting the amount of time they are exposed to addictive cell phones and social media and eliminates clear distractions in the classroom.\u201d The move comes on the heels of announcements last month by the nation\u2019s two largest school districts \u2013 New York City Public Schools and the Los Angeles Unified School District \u2013 that they would similarly move to limit cell phones in their schools. Across the United States, 72% of high school teachers said cell phone distraction is a \u201cmajor problem in the classroom,\u201d according to a report last week by the Pew Research Center. Los Angeles\u2019 school board voted 5-2 to ban cell phones during the school day by the start of the spring 2025 semester, a stance that goes beyond the existing, 14-year-old policy, which bans students from using cell phones during class instruction and limits social media use at school to \u201ceducational purposes.\u201d Cell phone use has exploded in the years since. LAUSD board members who supported the ban pointed to research they said suggests \u201cexcessive cell phone use impacts adolescents\u2019 mental health and well-being and is associated with increased stress, anxiety, depression, sleep issues, feelings of aggression, and suicidal thoughts.\u201d New York City\u2019s Public Schools Chancellor David Banks echoed that days later, when he said in an interview with WNYW that phones were not only a distraction, but an addiction \u2013 and a \u201cmajor issue.\u201d Banks indicated a formal announcement would come once he decided how to implement the plan. The change would go into effect as early as January 2025, he told CNN affiliate NY1. Still, questions remain about how to implement these plans. One sticking point is the impact on communication between students and their parents, particularly in the event of an emergency \u2013 a distressingly universal occurrence in an age of school lockdowns and gun violence. Banks acknowledged parents\u2019 concerns, telling NY1, \u201cWe want you to be able to bring your phone to school because the minute that school is over you need to be in communication with your family.\u201d \u201cWe can\u2019t control what happens once they\u2019re home,\u201d he said, \u201cbut maybe six to eight hours out of the day, we might have a little bit more control.\u201d CNN\u2019s Holly Yan, Debra Goldschmidt, Alisha Ebrahimji and Jeff Winter contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/10/us/virginia-school-cell-phone-restrictions-youngkin/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/11/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_07_08_us_college-value-cost-americans-skeptical-poll", "text": "Americans are increasingly skeptical about the value and cost of college, with most saying they feel the US higher education system is headed in the \u201cwrong direction,\u201d according to a new poll. Overall, only 36% of adults say they have a \u201cgreat deal\u201d or \u201cquite a lot\u201d of confidence in higher education, according to the report released Monday by Gallup and the Lumina Foundation. That confidence level has declined steadily from 57% in 2015. Some of the same opinions have been reflected in\u00a0declining enrollment\u00a0as colleges contend with the effects of the\u00a0student debt crisis, concerns about the high cost of tuition and\u00a0political debates\u00a0over how they teach about race and other topics. The dimming view of whether college is worth the time and money cuts across all demographics \u2014 including gender, age and political affiliation. Among Republicans, the number of respondents with high confidence in higher education has dropped 36 percentage points over the last decade \u2014 far more than it dropped for Democrats or independents. \u201cIt\u2019s so expensive, and I don\u2019t think colleges are teaching people what they need to get a job,\u201d says Randy Hill, 59, a registered Republican in Connecticut and a driver for a car service. His nephew plans to do a welding apprenticeship after graduating high school. \u201cYou graduate out of college, you\u2019re up to eyeballs in debt, you can\u2019t get a job, then you can\u2019t pay it off. What\u2019s the point?\u201d The June 2024 survey\u2019s overall finding \u2014 that 36% of adults feel strong confidence in higher education \u2014 is unchanged from the year before. But what concerns researchers is shifting opinion on the bottom end, with fewer Americans saying they have \u201csome\u201d confidence and more reporting \u201cvery little\u201d and \u201cnone.\u201d This year\u2019s findings show almost as many people have little or no confidence, 32%, as those with high confidence. Experts say fewer college graduates could worsen labor shortages in fields from health care to information technology. For those who forgo college, it often means lower lifetime earnings \u2014 75% less compared with those who get bachelor\u2019s degrees, according to Georgetown University\u2019s Center on Education and the Workforce. And during an economic downturn, those without degrees are more likely to lose jobs. \u201cIt is sad to see that confidence hasn\u2019t grown at all,\u201d says Courtney Brown, vice president at Lumina, an education nonprofit focused on increasing the numbers of students who seek education beyond high school. \u201cWhat\u2019s shocking to me is that the people who have low or no confidence is actually increasing.\u201d This year\u2019s survey added new, detailed questions in an effort to understand why confidence is shrinking. Almost one-third of respondents say college is \u201ctoo expensive,\u201d while 24% feel students are not being properly educated or taught what they need to succeed. The survey did not specifically touch on the\u00a0protests this year against the war in Gaza\u00a0that divided many college campuses, but political views weighed heavily on the findings. Respondents voiced concerns about indoctrination, political bias and that colleges today are too liberal. Among the respondents who lack confidence, 41% cite political agendas as a reason. Among other findings: More than two-thirds, or 67%, of respondents say college is headed in the \u201cwrong direction,\u201d compared with just 31% who feel it\u2019s going in the right direction. Generally when people express confidence in higher education, they are thinking of four-year institutions, according to Gallup. But the survey found that more people have confidence in two-year institutions. Forty-nine percent of adults say they have \u201ca great deal\u201d or \u201cquite a lot\u201d of confidence in two-year programs, compared with 33% of Americans who feel that way about four-year colleges. California college student Kristen Freeman understands why. \u201cIt\u2019s about saving money. That\u2019s why I went to a two-year. It\u2019s more bang for your buck,\u201d says Freeman, 22, a sociology major at Diablo Valley Community College with plans to transfer to San Jose State University for the final two years of college. Freeman understands the concerns about indoctrination and whether college prepares students for life and work but also feels the only way to change structural problems is from the inside. \u201cI am learning about the world around me and developing useful skills in critical thinking,\u201d Freeman says. \u201cI think higher education can give students the spark to want to change the system.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/08/us/college-value-cost-americans-skeptical-poll/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/11/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_07_10_us_alabama-death-row-inmate-autopsy-lawsuit", "text": "An Alabama death row inmate who is set to be executed by lethal injection next week has asked the state to forgo an autopsy of his body after he is put to death, saying it would violate his religious beliefs as a practicing Muslim, a lawsuit says. Keith Gavin, who is set to be executed next Thursday or Friday, says his body will be subjected to an \u201cinvasive autopsy\u201d that would violate his \u201csincerely held religious beliefs,\u201d as well as Alabama state law, according to the complaint filed by his attorneys last month. Among those named as defendants in the lawsuit are Escambia County District Attorney Steve Billy, Alabama Department of Corrections Commissioner John Hamm and Terry Raybon, warden of the William C. Holman Correctional Facility where Gavin is incarcerated on death row. The complaint is seeking a judicial order preventing the defendants from performing the autopsy and requiring them \u201cto respect Mr. Gavin\u2019s constitutional rights and sincerely held religious beliefs.\u201d Gavin is a devout Muslim, the complaint says, and his religion \u201cteaches that the human body is a sacred temple, which must be kept whole.\u201d An autopsy, he says, would desecrate his body and \u201cviolate the sanctity of keeping his human body intact\u201d along with his right to the free exercise of his religion. The lawsuit claims Gavin\u2019s attorneys have repeatedly attempted to reach state officials in charge of the autopsy process regarding his request for his \u201cearthly remains to be handled consistent with his faith,\u201d but have received no response. Immediately after Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey signed Gavin\u2019s April 25 letter setting his execution date, the lawsuit says the defendants failed to respond to phone calls, emails and in-person visits or have declined to speak with Gavin\u2019s attorneys. Under Alabama law, a medical examiner is required to investigate any death that takes place in any penal institution in the state, and the law gives discretion to state officials to order a postmortem autopsy if the death is \u201cunlawful, suspicious or unnatural.\u201d \u201cThis law is intended to establish with certainty the cause of death in any such event. After Mr. Gavin\u2019s execution, there will be no question as to who or what caused Mr. Gavin\u2019s death. The State will execute him by lethal injection,\u201d the lawsuit argues. CNN has reached out to the Alabama Department of Corrections and Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall\u2019s office for comment on the lawsuit. Alabama has faced scrutiny over its executions after multiple failed lethal injections prompted an internal review of the state\u2019s capital punishment system in 2022. Ivey asked the state Department of Corrections to conduct a \u201ctop-to-bottom review of the state\u2019s execution process\u201d after the problems came into the national spotlight, CNN previously reported.

She also said the evidence would show the firearm was in \u201cperfect order\u201d and did not malfunction. \u201cWhen someone plays make-believe with a real gun in a real-life workplace, and while playing make-believe with that gun violates the cardinal rules of firearm safety, people\u2019s lives are endangered and someone could be killed,\u201d she told jurors. \u201cThe evidence will show that someone who played make-believe with a real gun and violated the cardinal rules of firearm safety is the defendant, Alexander Baldwin.\u201d In contrast, the defense blamed the film\u2019s armorer and the first assistant director \u2013 jointly in charge of firearm safety on set \u2013 for allowing a real bullet to be loaded into the prop gun and failing to make it safe before it reached Baldwin. \u201cThis was an unspeakable tragedy, but Alec Baldwin committed no crime. He was an actor, acting, playing the role of Harlan Rust. An actor playing a character can do things that are lethal,\u201d attorney Alex Spiro said. \u201cThese \u2018cardinal rules\u2019 are not cardinal rules on a movie set.\u201d After opening statements, four law enforcement officers who responded to the \u201cRust\u201d set or handled evidence testified about their roles in the investigation. Baldwin has pleaded not guilty to a felony charge of involuntary manslaughter in connection with the death of 42-year-old Hutchins. If convicted, he could face up to 18 months in prison. The trial stems from the\u00a0fatal shooting\u00a0on October 21, 2021, inside a makeshift church at the Bonanza Creek ranch as the cast and crew rehearsed a scene for the film \u201cRust.\u201d Baldwin was practicing a \u201ccross draw\u201d \u2013 pulling a gun from a holster on the opposite side of his body from his draw hand \u2013 with a prop gun when it fired a live round, killing Hutchins and injuring director Joel Souza. The shocking death was the first of its kind since the 1993 death of\u00a0actor Brandon Lee, the son of martial arts icon Bruce Lee, who was killed in the filming of \u201cThe Crow\u201d when his co-star fired a prop gun containing a fragment of a bullet. Twelve jurors and four alternates were empaneled Tuesday for the Baldwin\u2019s trial in Sante Fe. The trial is expected to last for about two weeks. This is the third criminal case related to the on-set shooting. In March, Hannah Gutierrez Reed, the armorer for \u201cRust,\u201d was\u00a0found guilty of involuntary manslaughter and sentenced to 18 months in prison. Dave Halls, the assistant director, agreed to plead no contest to negligent use of a deadly weapon, the\u00a0district attorney for New Mexico\u2019s First Judicial District said. The terms of that deal included six months of probation\u00a0and a suspended sentence, prosecutors said. Dueling narratives from prosecution and defense On set that fatal day, Gutierrez Reed loaded a prop six-shot revolver with what\u00a0she\u2019s said she believed were \u201cdummy\u201d rounds, a term for ammo that contains no explosive elements but appear to be real, according to investigators and her defense attorney. After a lunch break, Halls fetched the prop gun from a cart outside the church and yelled \u201ccold gun,\u201d indicating it was safe. He then handed the gun to Baldwin. Baldwin then practiced the \u201ccross draw\u201d move and pointed the gun toward the camera, helmed by Hutchins, Souza and a camera operator. Suddenly, they heard a loud bang. Hutchins, who was shot in her torso, was transported by helicopter to the hospital and later pronounced dead. Souza, who was hit in the shoulder, was treated at the hospital, and a projectile from a live round was removed from his back. In opening statements, prosecutors said Baldwin did not follow appropriate safety rules on set, even before the fatal shooting. When he fired a gun, he did not do a safety check, Johnson alleged. He also used the gun to point at things, cocked the hammer when he was not supposed to and put his finger on the trigger when he was not supposed to, according to Johnson. Forensic testing of the firearm showed that the gun did not malfunction, she alleged. \u201cAfter the shooting, Baldwin began to claim he did not pull the trigger,\u201d she said. \u201cThe evidence will show, ladies and gentlemen, that\u2019s not possible.\u201d \u201cHe pointed the gun at another human being, cocked the hammer and pulled that trigger, in reckless disregard for Ms. Hutchins\u2019 safety,\u201d she said. Baldwin\u00a0has previously stated to CNN\u00a0that he did not pull the trigger during the fatal shooting, though he said he did cock the hammer of the gun. \u201cI never took a gun and pointed\u00a0at somebody and clicked the thing,\u201d Baldwin said in the 2022 interview. In the defense\u2019s opening statements, Spiro said the prosecution\u2019s attempt to prove Baldwin pulled the trigger did not make him guilty of homicide. The key to the fatal shooting was that others had loaded the prop gun with a live bullet and had cleared it as safe before the gun reached Baldwin. The prop gun was later damaged during unnecessary testing from the prosecution and investigators, hindering the evidence in the case, Spiro said. Further, Spiro played a video from the scene in question, in which Baldwin pulls a gun with the camera up close. In the video, he is in continual discussion with people off-camera about how to position himself and how to \u201cwhip out\u201d the gun. \u201cThere\u2019s no danger. They wanted him to do it again,\u201d Spiro said. Law enforcement officers testify on investigation After opening statements, four law enforcement investigators testified about their interactions with those on set and the chain of custody of the prop gun and rounds. The first witness was Nicholas Lefleur, a former deputy with the Santa Fe Sheriff\u2019s Office, who responded to the \u201cRust\u201d set after the shooting and spoke briefly with Baldwin. \u201cI was holding the gun, yeah,\u201d\u00a0Baldwin said when Lefleur approached him, according to body-camera video played in court. The deputy pulled Baldwin aside and told him not to speak to other people because they could all be witnesses, according to the video. However, the video shows Baldwin and other crew members continuing to discuss what happened in the shooting. On cross-examination, Lefleur acknowledged he did not repeat his order or tell Baldwin to get away from other people. Timoteo Benavidez, a former lieutenant with the Santa Fe County Sheriff\u2019s Office, testified about his visit to the set shortly after the shooting. He obtained the prop gun used in the shooting from Gutierrez Reed and then put it into his vehicle and locked the door, he testified. The gun did not have any rounds in it when he examined it, he said. Santa Fe County sheriff\u2019s Deputy Joseph Lujan testified he went to the hospital after the shooting and retrieved a projectile that doctors removed from Souza\u2019s shoulder. Finally, Marissa Poppell, a crime scene technician with the sheriff\u2019s office, testified she sent the prop gun to the FBI for a firearm functioning test to make sure it was in \u201cproper working order.\u201d When the firearm came back from the FBI, the cylinder had been removed and a small internal component was in a separate plastic bag, she testified. Five live rounds and one spent casing were found on set, she said. The long path to trial The case has been marked by years-long fits and starts with turnovers in prosecutors, a prosecution stalled by questions surrounding the integrity of evidence and a steady spate of motions from Baldwin\u2019s team attempting to get the charge thrown out. In the run-up to Baldwin\u2019s trial, the judge denied multiple defense motions seeking to throw out the case. Baldwin\u2019s attorneys had accused prosecutors of misconduct during the grand jury process; had argued the shooting death of Hutchins was an accident and Baldwin was not criminally liable; and had claimed the gun used in the shooting was destroyed during forensic testing by the FBI and the defense could not attempt to recreate the examination. Baldwin\u2019s prosecution was initially led by New Mexico First Judicial District Attorney\u00a0Mary Carmack-Altwies, a Democrat who later stepped aside, leaving the work to special prosecutors. One special prosecutor, Andrea Reeb, who also serves as a Republican state legislator, subsequently resigned from the case after Baldwin\u2019s legal team moved to\u00a0have her disqualified,\u00a0citing constitutional questions about a lawmaker working for the prosecution. Controversy surrounding Reeb later escalated after the New York Times\u00a0obtained communications\u00a0between Reeb and Carmack-Altwies following her hiring, in which the GOP lawmaker joked that serving on the team prosecuting Baldwin could help her political campaign. Reeb did not respond to a request for comment by the Times. In April 2023, special prosecutors\u00a0dismissed an involuntary manslaughter charge against Baldwin, citing \u201cnew facts\u201d in the case. But in October,\u00a0prosecutors said\u00a0\u201cadditional facts have come to light,\u201d and Baldwin was\u00a0indicted by a grand jury\u00a0in January on two counts of involuntary manslaughter. Prosecutors initially sought to argue in court that Baldwin\u2019s\u00a0role as a producer also opened him up to potential liability for the alleged culture\u00a0of unsafe practices on the\u00a0set. However, in a significant victory for the defense, Judge Mary Marlowe Sommer ruled on Monday that Baldwin\u2019s producer role will not be considered at trial.

{"id": "2024_07_10_media_cbs-news-president-ingrid-ciprian-matthews-stepping-down", "text": "Ingrid Cipri\u00e1n-Matthews, a three-decade veteran of CBS News who ascended to the role of president in 2023, abruptly announced Wednesday that she will step down from her role as the news organization\u2019s parent company prepares for a complex merger. \u201cNo journalist wants to \u2018be\u2019 the news, especially me. But today, I have some news of my own to share,\u201d Cipri\u00e1n-Matthews announced in a memo to employees. \u201cAfter much consideration, I\u2019ve decided this is the right time to step away from my current role at CBS News and begin to write my next chapter.\u201d The sudden move comes just months before the high stakes 2024 presidential election, leaving the Tiffany Network\u2019s news organization without a top boss to guide it through the pivotal moment. Wendy McMahon, chief executive of CBS News and Stations, said in a separate memo to staffers that Cipri\u00e1n-Matthews will move into a newly created role as senior editorial adviser helping to guide the outlet\u2019s politics coverage during the election. The announcement also comes days after Paramount Global, the parent company of CBS News, accepted an offer from Hollywood production studio Skydance Media that will see the two companies merge. Following the merger, Skydance Media plans to install its own leadership team. Cipri\u00e1n-Matthews alluded to the corporate uncertainty in her memo to staff. \u201cSome may be asking why I\u2019m announcing this now. We all know our industry and company are going through a transformation and a number of short- and long-term decisions need to be made,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI do not want to be disingenuous with any of you about who should drive these decisions. I\u2019ve always leaned into my integrity and my values and I felt it was important to be transparent at this juncture about my plans.\u201d \u201cIngrid will transition into this new role over the next few weeks, and we will share more updates soon,\u201d McMahon said. When she took over as CBS News president, Cipri\u00e1n-Matthews became the first Latina to hold the influential post at the network\u2019s news division. Her short run came after Neeraj Khemlani stepped down after a brief two-year stint, during which he become the subject of a human resources probe. The decision by Cipri\u00e1n-Matthews to vacate her role means that two of the nation\u2019s biggest television broadcast news organizations will be without a chief heading into the November elections amid a particularly turbulent period in the media industry. Earlier this year, Disney ousted Kim Godwin as ABC News chief and has yet to announce a replacement.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/10/media/cbs-news-president-ingrid-ciprian-matthews-stepping-down/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/11/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_07_09_us_taylor-casey-missing-bahamas-search-update", "text": "Investigators looking for missing American Taylor Casey in the Bahamas have enlisted the help of search dogs, marine teams and flight crews, officials said, as the search for the Chicago woman nears the three-week mark. Casey, 41, was last seen June 19 on Paradise Island, a small resort enclave just off the coast of the island of New Providence, the Royal Bahamas Police Force said. She was there to attend a yoga retreat. A\u00a0missing person flyer\u00a0released by police did not provide details of the circumstances of her disappearance or say whether foul play is suspected. During a June 22 search, a dog picked up a scent from a tent and tracked it to the water, but the scent ended there, Police Commissioner Clayton Fernander said at a news conference Monday. Two days later, search crews found Casey\u2019s cell phone in the water, but they have been unable to access its contents, officials said. Investigators in the Bahamas asked American authorities for help unlocking the phone, but they also had no luck, Fernander said Monday. Authorities also reviewed surveillance footage from around the island, but there is \u201cno information to connect at this time,\u201d the police commissioner added. Casey\u2019s mother, Colette Seymore, traveled to the Bahamas to meet with police, US Embassy leadership and organizers of the Sivananda Ashram Yoga Retreat where Casey was reported missing. \u201cI had to return home without her. This is every mother\u2019s worst nightmare,\u201d Seymore said in a\u00a0news release\u00a0last week after returning to the US. \u201cI felt an urgent need to return because without (US) government support, we may never find out what happened to my Taylor.\u201d Casey\u2019s family asked the FBI to take over the search, saying they \u201care not satisfied with how this investigation has been handled thus far.\u201d \u201cWhat we learned and observed during our time meeting with the authorities and Ashram leaders is disturbing and infuriating,\u201d Emily Williams, a friend of Casey who accompanied Seymore on the trip,\u00a0said\u00a0in the release. The US State Department is aware of reports of a missing US citizen in the Bahamas, a spokesperson told CNN last week, declining to comment on Casey\u2019s case specifically. When a US citizen is missing, the department works with local authorities and communicates with families openly, the spokesperson said. When asked for comment, the FBI referred CNN to the Royal Bahamas Police Force. Yoga retreat asked police to investigate Police in the Bahamas were alerted to Casey\u2019s disappearance by the Sivananda Ashram Yoga Retreat, which asked them to investigate after Casey failed to attend morning classes, the retreat said in a statement to CNN. Taylor, who has been practicing yoga for 15 years, went to the yoga retreat \u201cto fulfill a long-term goal of deepening her practice,\u201d the family said. Seymore visited the retreat on June 27 \u2013 a trip the family\u2019s statement called \u201cdeeply unsettling.\u201d When Seymore arrived at the retreat with her team, the scene appeared largely unprocessed by authorities, the release stated.\u00a0Among Casey\u2019s belongings were a\u00a0Bible\u00a0and other books, a sketchpad with paintings, affirmation cards, clothes and toiletries. \u201cIt became apparent to us when we met with the Sivananda Ashram leaders that they were struggling to keep a linear and cohesive narrative regarding Taylor\u2019s disappearance,\u201d Williams said. Ram Soskin, the lead manager of the Sivananda Ashram Yoga Retreat, told Casey\u2019s family that on the Monday before her disappearance, an unidentified man with a walkie-talkie was seen walking the same platform where Casey\u2019s tent was, the release states. On the day Casey was last seen, one of the retreat participants was approached by a stranger while sitting alone at the beach, the participant told Seymore\u2019s team, according to the release. \u201cThe unidentified man was wearing a Celtics baseball cap and dressed in all black. He claimed he was from Chicago and was interested in taking a yoga class. He proceeded to follow her onto the property,\u201d the release states. Seymore said police advised her not to speak to guests at the retreat\u00a0and authorities noted\u00a0not all of them were aware of\u00a0Casey\u2019s disappearance. Seymore described the retreat as \u201ccultish,\u201d\u00a0and claimed\u00a0students\u00a0were\u00a0being \u201ccoerced to obey\u201d retreat leaders, \u201ceven if that meant holding back information about my child,\u201d according to the release. Staff met with Taylor\u2019s mother and friends once at police headquarters and once at the retreat, Jonathan Goldbloom, a representative for the ashram, told CNN in a statement. \u201cTo be clear, the police advised us that while we can encourage community members to speak with them, it must be their choice. So, we announced their presence to Taylor\u2019s classmates and teachers and invited anyone wanting to meet with them to come forward,\u201d Goldbloom said.\u00a0\u201cMany of our community members chose to speak with them and the ashram did not intervene in terms of what individuals said.\u00a0They were encouraged to speak freely.\u00a0Any perceived hesitancy could have been due to their own grieving processes.\u201d The retreat has been asking across channels for people to come forward with information and providing guests with regular updates, Goldbloom said. \u201cAll of us are distraught over Taylor\u2019s disappearance, and our hearts go out to her family and friends,\u201d Goldbloom said.
