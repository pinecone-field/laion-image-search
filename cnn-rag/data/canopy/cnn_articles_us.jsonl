{"id": "2024_02_22_us_rise-above-movement-ruling-on-hold", "text": "After a federal judge made the rare decision\u00a0to\u00a0dismiss\u00a0a criminal\u00a0case\u00a0against\u00a0two White\u00a0nationalists suspected of inciting violence at political rallies, an appeals court on Thursday put the ruling on hold and one of the men was re-arrested. The\u00a0appeals\u00a0court\u00a0stay came after the\u00a0highly\u00a0unusual\u00a0ruling\u00a0of US District Court Judge Cormac Carney\u00a0to\u00a0dismiss\u00a0the\u00a0case\u00a0against\u00a0Robert Rundo and Robert Boman,\u00a0saying they were being selectively prosecuted while far left groups weren\u2019t. The two men were under indictment for conspiracy, riots, and aiding and abetting. Rundo, who was released after the ruling, was taken back into custody by federal agents, a law enforcement official involved in the investigation told CNN Thursday. Rundo was believed to have traveled to the US-Mexico border after his release, a law enforcement source told CNN. The Justice Department obtained a warrant to take him back into custody, saying he was \u201can extremely serious flight risk.\u201d Rundo will now remain in custody while the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals considers motions involving his release, according to court records. Court records show Rundo\u2019s attorneys had signaled their intention to possibly request Carney\u2019s intervention yet again in the matter involving their client, but in the new order the higher court blocked Carney and other judges from any further action while they consider the matter. \u201cNo lower court may order h\ufeffis release absent further order of this Court,\u201d the Ninth Circuit commanded in their order. Rundo and Boman were\u00a0allegedly members of the\u00a0Rise Above Movement, RAM, which Carney described as \u201ca group of far-right,\u00a0white\u00a0supremacist\u00a0nationalists, who attended several rallies and protests during which they engaged in violent acts.\u201d They were both indicted under the\u00a0federal\u00a0Anti-Riot Act \u2013 referred\u00a0to by Carney as \u201ca-once-rarely-used criminal statute.\u201d The men\u00a0are believed\u00a0to\u00a0have recruited and given combat training\u00a0to\u00a0like-minded members, then incited violence at political rallies in Huntington Beach and Berkeley, California,\u00a0and in Charlottesville, Virginia. \u201cBeginning around March 2017, (Rundo and Boman) agreed\u00a0to\u00a0riot at political rallies and organized demonstrations, where they would assault individuals they believed were associated with Antifa and related far-left groups,\u201d Carney wrote. The defense presented a motion\u00a0to\u00a0dismiss\u00a0the\u00a0case,\u00a0saying the men were the victims of selective prosecution. \u201cIt is not uncommon\u00a0for a defendant\u00a0to\u00a0raise selective prosecution\u00a0as a defense but it is extraordinarily uncommon\u00a0for that defense\u00a0to\u00a0succeed because the defendant has\u00a0to\u00a0prove that other similarity positioned people were not prosecuted,\u201d\u00a0said CNN senior legal analyst Elie Honig. But Carney\u00a0took exception\u00a0to\u00a0what he viewed as an imbalance by\u00a0federal prosecutors in charging\u00a0White\u00a0nationalists\u00a0with crimes under the Anti-Riot Act, but \u2013 in his view \u2013 not similarly charging far left agitators. \u201cThe government cannot prosecute RAM members such as Defendants while ignoring the violence of members of Antifa and related far-left groups because RAM engaged in what the government and many believe is more offensive speech,\u201d wrote Carney. \u201cBy many accounts, members of Antifa and related far-left groups engaged in worse conduct and in fact instigated much of the violence that broke out at these otherwise constitutionally protected rallies to silence the protected speech of the supporters of President Trump,\u201d Carney wrote,\u00a0adding he viewed prosecuting far right rioters while ignoring far left instigators as \u201cconstitutionally impermissible.\u201d \u201cSuch selective prosecution\u00a0leaves the troubling impression\u00a0that the government believes speech\u00a0on\u00a0the left more deserving of protection\u00a0than speech\u00a0on\u00a0the right,\u201d wrote Carney. Following widespread civil unrest in the country in 2020,\u00a0federal\u00a0prosecutors did\u00a0bring more than\u00a0200\u00a0cases\u00a0against\u00a0individuals alleged\u00a0to\u00a0have engaged in violence during protests\u00a0after the police killing of George Floyd. Some\u00a0cases were for riot-related crimes and others for lesser offenses usually handled by local authorities, not\u00a0federal\u00a0prosecutors. At the time, then-Attorney General William Barr urged\u00a0federal\u00a0prosecutors\u00a0to get\u00a0tougher in bringing more\u00a0cases, including exploring using a rarely used sedition law, but some\u00a0federal\u00a0prosecutors were taken aback by the notion\u00a0of charging protestors with violating\u00a0a law that makes it a crime\u00a0to\u00a0conspire\u00a0to\u00a0overthrow the government. Barr\u00a0frequently lashed out at leftist groups, including publicly decrying Antifa, but despite his threats\u00a0to\u00a0go after the group, the Justice Department under his leadership did not bring widespread charges\u00a0against\u00a0so-called Antifa members \u2013 an amalgamation\u00a0of individuals\u00a0holding various views, which, unlike various neo-Nazi and\u00a0White\u00a0supremacist groups, has no formal leadership structure or membership. Attorneys for both Rundo and Boman did not respond to CNN\u2019s multiple requests for comment on the recent court action. Judge Carney is no stranger\u00a0to\u00a0controversial\u00a0rulings. Late last year, he blocked parts of\u00a0a California law that\u00a0would have banned carrying concealed weapons\u00a0in a multitude of public places.\u00a0 And in 2014,\u00a0he deemed California\u2019s death penalty unconstitutional,\u00a0calling the administration\u00a0of the state\u2019s system \u201cdysfunctional.\u201d Carney was\u00a0once the chief judge of the Central District of California, but stepped down after making a\u00a0racially insensitive remark\u00a0about a\u00a0top\u00a0administrative official at the\u00a0court,\u00a0according\u00a0to\u00a0the Los Angeles Times.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/02/22/us/rise-above-movement-ruling-on-hold/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/22/2024", "section": "us"}}

{"id": "2024_07_20_us_global-it-outage-california-forecaster-trnd", "text": "As what was possibly the \u201clargest IT outage in history\u201d impacted computer systems across the globe this week, a Northern California weather forecaster found a creative \u2013 and hands-on \u2013 solution to keep his viewers updated as his news station\u2019s software remained offline. On Friday, many computer systems for healthcare, business, technology and government sectors worldwide crashed after cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike issued a software update for Microsoft Windows operating systems. The widespread disturbance affected 8.5 million Windows devices, or fewer than 1% of all Windows machines, Microsoft said Saturday. The lengthy process of restoring operations continued on Saturday. But early Friday morning, Preston Donion, a forecaster and multimedia journalist for CNN affiliate KRCR in Redding, California, says he woke up to chaos after \u201ceverything had gone completely haywire\u201d with the systems at his job the night before. \u201cThey didn\u2019t end up even running a broadcast on our stations at 10 and 11 (p.m.), so they were really kaput,\u201d Donion told CNN on Saturday. He says he rushed into work to find that, sure enough, they had no weather graphics available. Donion and his producer teamed up to figure out how they could display a weather forecast on air with the systems down, he said. \u201cBecause I have my numbers, I can get my forecast built, but I have no way to communicate that,\u201d recalled Donion, who\u2019s worked at KRCR since June 2022. He says he spent the first half hour of the show pulling up websites or screen sharing from one of the station\u2019s iPads and stepping off the screen to read numbers. \u201cBut I realized that wasn\u2019t very engaging, wasn\u2019t very effective,\u201d Donion said. About 45 minutes into the broadcast, the Washington native says he used a Sharpie and a pen to draw a rough sketch of a map he had saved as a reference for familiarizing himself with California. \u201cI just went to work on the back of a piece of paper that had my rundown on it, and just did my best,\u201d Donion said. His on-air solution to the tech fiasco turned out to be the hand-drawn maps of his coverage area, which he admitted to viewers weren\u2019t \u201cperfect\u201d renderings. \u201cI just drew this up,\u201d Donion can be seen telling local viewers in a video he shared to his X account Friday. \u201cI know Trinity County looks like it\u2019s been on somewhat of a diet there, and things are a little square in Modoc County, but I wanted to give you a visual.\u201d He also shared on air the seven-day forecast using a chart he typed in his phone\u2019s Notes app, the video shows. \u201cI thought it was the best way to just kind of put together some visuals without having computer technology, so it was fun to me,\u201d said Donion. One viewer commented the retro approach to the forecast took them back to the 1970s, when TV meteorologists used paper maps and magnets in their weather centers, he said. \u201cI definitely got some messages on Facebook and on Twitter saying, \u2018Hey, you know, thanks for adapting. We appreciate you just getting the information out,\u2019\u201d Donion said. \u201cOther meteorologists have reached out and said, \u2018You know, I was thinking I\u2019d have to get my magnets out,\u2019\u201d he added. Many of KRCR\u2019s systems were back online by the end of Donion\u2019s shift around 11 a.m. local time Friday, and the evening shows went smoothly, he shared. CNN Meteorologist Elisa Raffa gave kudos to Donion for his quick thinking. While learning about meteorology in school, Raffa says weather students learned to hand-draw fronts and storm systems. \u201cIt\u2019s a skill you never think you\u2019ll need again \u2013 until the computers go out,\u201d Raffa said. \u201cAnd if you ask a 30-plus-year veteran in the industry, they\u2019d be happy to remind us that this was how weather was done before the magic of green screens,\u201d she added. \u201cMarkers, chalk, magnets and a whole lot of paper were used to get a forecast on TV. It\u2019s amazing how much we depend on technology now!\u201d CNN\u2019s Dalia Faheid contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/20/us/global-it-outage-california-forecaster-trnd/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/22/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_07_21_business_crowdstrike-outage-cost", "text": "The world learned relatively quickly that cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike was behind a crippling global tech outage on Friday. But figuring out who will pay the bill for the damages could take a lot longer. What one cybersecurity expert said appears to be the \u201clargest IT outage in history\u201d led to the cancellation of more than 5,000 commercial airline flights worldwide and disrupted businesses from retail sales to package deliveries to procedures at hospitals, costing revenue and staff time and productivity. The problem was caused by a few bits of CrowdStrike\u2019s own bad code in a software \u201ccontent update.\u201d Unfortunately, fixing the mistake was much more time consuming than causing it, and it could be days before all the systems are back to normal. While CrowdStrike has apologized, it has not mentioned whether or not it intends to provide compensation to affected customers. And when asked by CNN about whether it plans to provide compensation, its response did not address that question. Experts say they expect that there will be demands for remuneration and very possibly lawsuits. \u201cIf you\u2019re a lawyer for CrowdStrike, you\u2019re probably not going to enjoy the rest of your summer,\u201d said Dan Ives, a tech analyst for Wedbush Securities. Billion-dollar bill Experts largely agree it\u2019s too early to get a firm handle on the price tag for Friday\u2019s global internet breakdown. But those costs could easily top $1 billion, said Patrick Anderson, CEO of Anderson Economic Group, a Michigan research firm that specializes in estimating the economic cost of events like strikes and other business disruptions. His firm estimates that a recent hack of CDK Global, a software firm that serves US car dealerships, reached that $1 billion cost mark. While that outage lasted much longer, about three weeks, it was restricted to one narrow industry. \u201cThis outage is affecting far more consumers and businesses in a way that ranges from inconvenience to serious disruptions and resulted in out of pocket costs they can\u2019t get back easily,\u201d he said. Anderson added that the costs could be particularly significant for airlines, due to lost revenue from canceled flights and excess labor and fuel costs for the planes that did fly but faced significant delays. Despite CrowdStrike\u2019s dominance in the cybersecurity field, its revenue is just less than $4 billion annually. But there could be legal protections for CrowdStrike in its customer contracts to shield it from liability, according to one expert. \u201cI would guess that the contracts protect them,\u201d said James Lewis, researcher at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Lewis pointed to case decided Thursday in favor of SolarWinds, another software company. A judge dismissed Securities and Exchange Commission charges against SolarWinds related to a Russian hack of federal government agencies in late 2020. Lewis said in that case SolarWinds was only facing charges for not disclosing its system\u2019s vulnerabilities to an outside hack, not for damage caused by its own actions. But it still won a dismissal of the case. Will customers stay? It\u2019s also not clear how many customers CrowdStrike might lose because of Friday. Wedbush Securities\u2019 Ives estimates less than 5% of its customers might go elsewhere. \u201cThey\u2019re such an entrenched player, to move away from CrowdStrike would be a gamble,\u201d he said. It will be difficult, and not without additional costs, for many customers to switch from CrowdStrike to a competitor. But the real hit to CrowdStrike could be reputational damage that will make it difficult to win new customers. \u201cToday CrowdStrike becomes a household name, but not in a good way, and this will take time to settle down,\u201d Ives said. CrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz said in an interview Friday morning on CNBC that the firm has been focused on fixing the continuing problems and that so far, he believed most customers had been understanding. \u201cMy goal right now is to make sure every customer is back up and running,\u201d he said. \u201cI think many of the customers understand it\u2019s a complex environment and staying one step ahead of the bad guys requires these content updates.\u201d But even if customers are understanding, it\u2019s likely that CrowdStrike\u2019s rivals will be seeking to use Friday\u2019s events to try to lure them away. \u201cIt\u2019s a very competitive business. There will be sales people from all the other companies, \u2026(jumping) in and say(ing), \u2018This has never happened to us,\u2019\u201d said said Eric O\u2019Neill, a cybersecurity expert and former FBI counterintelligence operative. \u201cThey\u2019re an excellent company doing important work. I hope they survive this. If they don\u2019t, the only winner will be the cybercriminals.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/21/business/crowdstrike-outage-cost/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/22/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_07_20_business_unmarried-couples-living-together-questions-to-ask", "text": "Taking your romantic relationship to the next level \u2014 sharing a home \u2014 is a big deal in so many ways. If you opt to live together instead of marrying, you may think you\u2019re saving money (e.g., no wedding!) and keeping your financial and legal independence from each other. In some ways you may be. But there are a lot of financial and legal considerations that you both should hash out before calling the movers. That is especially the case for couples over 50 \u2014 for whom living together may seem the easier option if they have already had long-term marriages. \u201cMy research has shown that following a gray divorce, women and men are more likely to form a cohabitation than a remarriage, signaling that cohabitation is gaining ground among older adults these days,\u201d said sociology professor Susan Brown, director of the\u00a0National Center for Family & Marriage Research at Bowling Green State University. An analysis of federal data by the Pew Research Center found that in 2016, couples over 50 represented roughly a quarter of adults living together. Those in this age group \u2014 far more than couples in their 20s and 30s \u2014 have already lived complex lives, raised families and saved for and envisioned retirement. They also, much to their chagrin, are more likely to develop health problems during their relationships from hereon out. But while some concerns may be more urgent for older couples, here are some key questions couples of any age should consider when deciding to live together: 1. What are the numbers we\u2019re working with? Mari Adam, a certified financial planner and founder of the educational consultancy Mari Talks Money, recommends partners know the financial basics about each other. This includes your income, assets, debts and credit scores. It also includes what kind of health, disability and long-term care insurance you have. And don\u2019t forget to share with your partner whether and how much you owe in alimony and child support. Surprises and secrets are never welcome in this regard. If you\u2019re the person receiving alimony or child support, figure out the potential consequences of living together on your eligibility for those payments. Every state has its own rulebook. So check in with a divorce attorney. \u201cThere can be all sorts of gotchas,\u201d Adam said. In terms of Social Security benefits, if you are divorced or widowed, you may be entitled to benefits based on your former spouse\u2019s earnings records. But the rules may change if you remarry, based on your age. If, however, you are just cohabitating, that isn\u2019t likely to interfere with your getting those benefits if you\u2019re otherwise eligible, said Steven Rubin, a certified elder care attorney at the firm Drazen Rubin Law. 2. Who pays for what? Figuring out how much each of you will pay for joint living expenses is a conversation worth having, if only to ward off potential resentments in the future. Adam has counseled people to find \u201cfair and equitable\u201d solutions. For some, that may mean splitting expenses 50/50. But for others that may not make sense. For example, if you make three times as much as your partner, you might decide to pay on a proportional basis, with each contributing the same percentage of your incomes for common expenses. Here\u2019s what that can look like: 10% of a $75,000 income ($7,500) is three times less than 10% of $225,000 ($22,500). Beyond dollars and cents, you also might consider what each partner brings to the table in terms of living together \u2014 whether it\u2019s cooking, cleaning, home repairs or taking charge of your social life as a couple. \u201cI\u2019ve seen friends and clients where the woman has money and [her male partner] doesn\u2019t. She pays all the house expenses and he is the handyman,\u201d Adam said. If your partner owns their home and you move in to that house, consider that the financial benefits of anything that improves the home\u2019s value \u2014 such as a new roof or a kitchen renovation \u2014 will only accrue to your partner, since you are not a co-owner, even though you will both enjoy the day-to-day benefits of living in an improved space. \u201cYou can solve anything. But you have to be willing to talk about it and be fair-minded about it,\u201d Adam said. \u201cThere is no one right answer.\u201d She also recommends a \u201cyours, mine and ours\u201d approach to bank accounts. \u201cIt is important to keep money separate \u2014 especially when you have kids. But have a joint account that both parties put money into [for joint living, traveling and entertaining expenses].\u201d 3. What happens if one of us gets sick? No one wants to contemplate this question. (Even writing about it is unpleasant.) But discussing it ahead of time can lessen some of the stress, should a situation arise when a partner gets sick and requires chronic care or becomes terminally ill, Rubin said. Discuss whom each of you wants to legally give a durable power of attorney to \u2014 that is the person you designate to manage your finances if you become incapacitated. Also discuss who you want to be your health care proxies. A medical proxy is the person who will make medical care decisions for you if you become unable to do so for yourself. And make clear how much and what types of medical intervention you want if you become terminally ill \u2014 that is something a proxy will be charged with respecting, even if the person\u2019s family is pushing for something different. All these wishes should be executed through a durable power of attorney form and what is sometimes called an advance health directive or living will. And if your partner is not your chosen health care proxy, include a medical release form in your health care directive naming them as someone who you, essentially, want by your side during a health crisis. \u201c[T]hat will allow doctors and hospitals to communicate with your partner, even if the partner is not the decision maker,\u201d Rubin said. \u201cI also list this in the advance directive that they want the person to have full visitation rights and the decision maker has a fiduciary responsibility to ensure your wishes are met.\u201d 4. What do you want to happen to your assets when you die? While everyone should have a will spelling out how they want their assets to be distributed, it\u2019s especially important for unmarried couples to do so since the law typically confers a lot of automatic benefits to marital spouses and a person\u2019s children than to one\u2019s live-in partner. If one or both of you have kids, both partners need to be clear about how the children and the surviving partner will (or won\u2019t) be provided for in the estate. One concern, for example, may be what happens to the home you share when one of you dies? If you own it jointly, who will inherit the deceased partner\u2019s share? If the person who dies is the sole owner, who will inherit the property? If it\u2019s not the live-in partner, then do you want to have a provision where the partner can stay in the home for a given period of time? All that can be addressed by setting up a trust for the asset, Rubin said. One area where things can get tricky with the home, Rubin said, is if the person who owns the house needs expensive long-term care and tries to qualify for Medicaid, which requires them to have very few assets. Even if the home is jointly owned with one\u2019s live-in partner, the state may or may not require that the home be sold before the sick partner can qualify and if it\u2019s sold then their significant other has to move out. If you were married, Rubin said, the property would be treated as exempt for benefit purposes.

I was powerless. I couldn\u2019t do anything,\u201d the two-time Super Bowl champion told CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett on Wednesday. The incident happened Saturday at the end of a flight from Denver to Orange County, California. Davis, 51, was flying with his wife, two sons and daughter when one of the sons asked for a cup of ice during beverage service, Davis wrote on Instagram. A flight attendant \u201ceither didn\u2019t hear or ignored his request and continued past our row,\u201d the post read. \u201cI calmly reached behind me and lightly tapped (the attendant\u2019s) arm to get his attention to again ask for a cup of ice for my son,\u201d Davis wrote.  \u201cHe shouted, \u2018Don\u2019t hit me,\u2019 and left the cart to hurriedly approach the front of the plane. I was confused, as were the passengers in front of me who witnessed the exchange. I thought nothing of it other than this particular employee was incredibly rude and blatantly wrong in his accusations of me hitting him.\u201d Davis said he did not see or interact with the attendant for the rest of the flight. After the plane landed in Orange County, the pilot asked passengers to remain seated, and FBI and law enforcement agents went to Davis\u2019s seat, put him in handcuffs and took him off the plane \u2013 with the scene \u201crecorded by multiple passengers,\u201d he wrote. \u201cMy boys were there. And my daughter was there. And my wife is there,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cI\u2019m wondering what\u2019s going on. They didn\u2019t ask me any questions. I had no chance to even explain.\u201d Davis\u2019 wife, Tamiko Davis, said she knew her husband couldn\u2019t even question why he was being handcuffed and taken away. \u201cTerrell knows better. Unfortunately, historically, in these situations, interaction with law enforcement as a Black man \u2026 you can\u2019t ask,\u201d she told CNN. \u201cSo thank God my husband has the wherewithal, the class, the understanding to know, in that moment, all he could do was sit there and comply and be humiliated in front of his sons and the 200 \u2026 however many people were on that plane. They didn\u2019t give him any other options.\u201d Wife and kids were left \u2018to fend for ourselves\u2019 Davis said he strives to be a positive role model for his kids and teach them to do the right thing \u2013 which makes the sight of him getting taken away in handcuffs even more heartbreaking. \u201cWe did the right thing. We didn\u2019t do anything. Yet I found myself with handcuffs, being paraded off a plane and being treated like a convict,\u201d Davis said. After Davis was taken off the plane, \u201cWe were just left to fend for ourselves on a flight with everyone staring at us,\u201d his wife said told ABC\u2019s \u201cGood Morning America\u201d earlier Wednesday. Later, \u201cDuring questioning, it was rightfully determined by the agents that this flight attendant was inaccurate in his accusations and the agents profusely apologized,\u201d Davis wrote. United Airlines has \u201cremoved the flight attendant from duty while we closely review this matter,\u201d the company said in an email to CNN Monday evening. \u201cThis is clearly not the kind of travel experience we strive to provide, and we have reached out to Mr. Davis\u2019 team to apologize,\u201d United Airlines\u2019 email read. Davis is still waiting for a direct apology from United Airlines, he told \u201cGMA\u201d Wednesday morning. \u201cThey have not reached out to me to apologize,\u201d he told ABC. \u201cThey have reached out to my attorney, but I have not heard from them directly. And so that, to me, is a problem.\u201d CNN reached out to United Airlines for comment after Davis\u2019 remarks Wednesday. \u201cWe have nothing new to share,\u201d United\u2019s media relations department said. \u2018We are held to a different standard\u2019 The Davises said they\u2019re not certain what race the flight attendant is. But they said Black men are often treated differently \u2013 and they\u2019re raising their sons to beware of that cruel reality. \u201cThe traumatizing experience of my two sons, my daughter and my wife watching me being placed in handcuffs \u2013 without due process or any explanation \u2013 cannot be undone,\u201d Davis wrote on Instagram. \u201cI certainly felt like that wouldn\u2019t have happened if I were a White person,\u201d Davis told CNN. \u201cThat\u2019s what I felt. Whether that\u2019s true or not, that\u2019s a different conversation.\u201d The FBI\u2019s Los Angeles field office acknowledged Monday that agents and law enforcement partners respond to a report of an incident with a flight that landed Saturday at Orange County\u2019s John Wayne Airport. A person who was detained for questioning \u201cwas cooperative with law enforcement and was released to continue his travels,\u201d the FBI office said. The FBI does not provide details of incidents or names of people who might have been interviewed unless charges are filed publicly, FBI field office spokesperson Laura Eimiller said. What happened on the flight \u201cis appalling and disturbing to say the least,\u201d Parker Stinar, managing partner of the Chicago-based law firm representing Davis told CNN this week. \u201cWe plan on fully investigating\u00a0the events that took place and are actively contacting United Airlines in this matter,\u201d Stinar wrote. Now, instead of vacationing with his children, Davis is using his clout to raise awareness about mistreatment and hopefully \u201caffect change,\u201d he told \u201cGMA.\u201d As one of only eight running backs to have rushed more than 2,000 yards in an NFL season, Davis played seven seasons in the NFL \u2013 all with the Broncos \u2013 from 1995 to 2001, and helped the Broncos win two Super Bowls in January 1998 and January 1999. He was named MVP of that first title game, rushing for 157 yards and scoring three touchdowns in the Broncos\u2019 31-24 win over the Green Bay Packers. The three-time Pro Bowler was enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2017. But despite his fame, Davis said he and other Black men are often treated differently. He wants his sons to keep an open mind if they feel they\u2019re being perceived differently \u2013 \u201cI always try to go through a checklist of things that it could be, and I always try to use race as like the last sort of possible thing,\u201d Davis told CNN. \u201cBut I always tell them: What applies to everybody else doesn\u2019t apply to you,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re always trying to teach them that there\u2019s consequences, but we are held to a different standard.\u201d CNN\u2019s Jason Hanna, Raja Razek, Cindy Von Quednow and Kelly McCleary contributed to this report.

{"id": "2024_07_21_politics_trump-assassination-attempt-independent-review-mayorkas", "text": "Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, under\u00a0pressure from the White House and Congress,\u00a0unveiled Sunday the experts who will be conducting an independent review of the attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump, tapping former senior Homeland Security officials who served under multiple administrations, as well as law enforcement officials. Some of those\u00a0chosen to serve on\u00a0the independent panel include Janet Napolitano, a former DHS Secretary, and Mark Filip, a former federal judge and\u00a0deputy\u00a0attorney\u00a0general to President George W. Bush. The Department of Homeland Security and the White House have been closely managing how the Secret Service is handling the\u00a0fallout from the attempt on Trump\u2019s life. The independent review is an effort by officials to get ahead of\u00a0congressional reviews and hearings happening on Capitol Hill, sources familiar with the matter tell CNN. Over recent days, the Department of Homeland Security had been reaching out to individuals,\u00a0including some former government officials,\u00a0to\u00a0gauge\u00a0interest and select who will be on the panel. Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle, who has faced sharp criticism in the week since the shooting at Trump\u2019s Butler, Pennsylvania, rally, said the agency is \u201ceager to cooperate\u201d with the bipartisan, independent review of the agency\u2019s actions related to the incident. \u201cI look forward to the panel examining what happened and providing recommendations to help ensure it will never happen again,\u201d Cheatle said in a statement Sunday evening. In the days since the attack on the former president and Republican presidential nominee, relatively little has come out about the shooter\u2019s motive, how he was able to perch on a nearby rooftop with an AR-style weapon and why Trump\u2019s team wasn\u2019t warned about a potential threat. Republican lawmakers in particular have been upset with the lack of answers, with some calling for Cheatle\u2019s resignation. The review stems from a request by President Joe Biden to conduct an independent review of the assassination attempt. Mayorkas told reporters last week that he wanted the review up and running in a matter of days. \u201cWe are committed to getting to the bottom of what happened on July 13, and I am grateful to the distinguished members of this independent review who will bring decades of expertise in law enforcement and security operations to this important investigation,\u201d Mayorkas said in a statement Sunday. \u201cThis independent review will examine what happened and provide actionable recommendations to ensure they carry out their no-fail mission most effectively and to prevent something like this from ever happening again,\u201d he added.

Backers of the law argue the Ten Commandments belong in classrooms because the commandments are historical and are part of the foundation of US law.

{"id": "2024_07_20_economy_china-economy-employment-blue-collar-work-intl-hnk", "text": "Leon Li used to play a discreet but indispensable part at one of China\u2019s biggest tech giants. As an administrative officer, she worked around the clock to schedule meetings, prepare documents and provide her bosses with whatever support they needed. But in February, she quit the company, forgoing a stable career and comfortable salary forsomething a little less stressful \u2014 cleaning homes. \u201cEvery morning when the alarm rang, all I could see was my dull future,\u201d she told CNN, reflecting on her office job. Li, 27, is part of a growing base of Chinese workers swapping high-pressure office jobs\u00a0for flexible blue-collar work. Many of them used to work for some of the biggest companies in the country. But these firms are slowly losing their appeal as China\u2019s economy faces headwinds\u00a0including a property crisis, declining foreign investment and slumping consumption. China\u2019s economy\u00a0grew 4.7% year-on-year in the second quarter of 2024, missing economists\u2019 expectations and marking the weakest growth since the first quarter of last year, according to the\u00a0latest data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) released on Monday. Gruelingly long hours and shrinking resources have prompted employees like Li to\u00a0rethink whether it\u2019s worth trading their time and health for higher pay. \u201cI like cleaning up. As living standards improve (across the country), the demand for housekeeping services is also surging with an ever-expanding market,\u201d said Li, who lives in the central Chinese metropolis of Wuhan. But more importantly, she feels happier. \u201cThe change it brings is that my head no longer feels\u00a0dizzy. I feel less mental pressure. And I am full of energy every day,\u201d she said. Workers reject \u2019996\u2019 culture Li is not the only white-collar worker who has found a better work-life balance by trading\u00a0an office job for manual labor. Alice Wang, 30, who is using an alias for privacy reasons, used to work for one of China\u2019s\u00a0leading live-streaming e-commerce platforms, earning 700,000 yuan ($96,310) per year. But she resigned in April, moving from Hangzhou, a picturesque tech hub, to the\u00a0more laidback city of Chengdu, where rent is cheaper, to take up pet grooming. China\u2019s notorious \u201c996\u201d work culture \u2013 the practice of working from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. six days a\u00a0week that is common among the country\u2019s tech companies, startups and other private businesses \u2013 has been a push factor for many employees who call it quits. Wang recalled feeling physically frail and \u201cvery lifeless and stagnant\u201d at her old job,\u00a0when she used to dedicate most of her time to work. But she feels different now. \u201cThe feeling of growth is relatively good,\u201d she said, adding that\u00a0she\u2019s undertaking grooming training and has ambitions to one day open her own store. \u201cThat\u2019s the longer-term plan,\u201d she said. The trend to move from professional to manual jobs comes amid surging demand for blue-collar workers, according to Chinese recruitment platform Zhaopin. In its latest survey released in June, the platform found that demand for blue-collarjobs \u2013 such as food delivery workers, truck drivers, waiters and technicians \u2013 had surged 3.8 times in the first quarter of the year compared to the same period in 2019. Demand for delivery workers grew the fastest, by 800%, after three years of Covid-related lockdowns\u00a0that gave rise to a takeout food culture. And blue-collar workers\u2019 pay has also gone up, attracting more people to jobs they might have previously avoided. The explosion of online shopping has seen the average monthly salary for a delivery worker\u00a0surge 45.3% since 2019, from 5,581 yuan ($768) to 8,109 yuan ($1,116), according to the survey. For some college graduates though, taking a manual job was not their first choice. As the economy slows, positions for fresh grads have become harder to come by in an increasingly\u00a0competitive corporate job market. The survey also found the number of people under the age of 25 who applied for blue-collar\u00a0jobs in the first quarter of this year surged 165% compared with the same period in 2019. China\u2019s unemployment rate for 16-to-24-year-olds reached a staggering 21.3% in June 2023,\u00a0according to the NBS, which subsequently suspended the release of the figure for months while it adjusted its methodology. The authorities brought back the data in January this year \u2013 excluding from the figure some\u00a062 million students, whose main task, they said, should be to study rather than look for\u00a0jobs. In recent months, the jobless rate for prospective workers aged 16 to 24 years old has hovered\u00a0between 14.2% and 15.3%, according to the NBS. Economists Larry Hu and Zhang Yuxiao, from Macquarie, wrote in a research report last year that\u00a0China\u2019s services sector, private companies and small and medium-sized enterprises used to be\u00a0the major sources of employment for young workers. However, they have been hit hard by\u00a0sluggish consumer demand. David Goodman, director of the University of Sydney\u2019s China Studies Centre, said there hadbeen a mismatch between the kind of graduates that universities churn out and what\u00a0the market really needs. He said China\u2019s economy was shifting towards advanced technology, green tech and service industries, while university education still largely focuses on manufacturing and public service, areas that are outdated or saturated. \u201c(There is) a key problem if the higher education system has not adjusted itself or beenadjusted to meet rapid changes in the structure of the economy,\u201d he explained. Pressure of another kind But some wonder if blue-collar work is truly the stress-free refuge people like Li and Wang\u00a0imagine it to be. A recent video circulated widely on Chinese social media demonstrated how things could go\u00a0wrong. The clip showed a barista in Shanghai losing his temper over a customer who\u00a0threatened to make a complaint against him. In a fit of rage, he threw coffee powder at her, instantly becoming the center of a cafe drama\u00a0that sparked an online debate about the challenges workers in the service industry face. Complaints or bad online reviews can prove disastrous for shops and restaurants in China, as\u00a0many consumers religiously follow recommendations on popular social media platforms such\u00a0as Xiaohongshu and Douyin, China\u2019s version of TikTok. The threat of a bad review puts pressure on low-paid workers to avoid doinganything that may draw negative attention to the company. Some internet users denounced the barista\u2019s poor manner. But many more sympathized with\u00a0him. \u201cThe pay is low to begin with, let alone having to face complaint. May as well just quit (when\u00a0you are) squeezed both by the company and customers,\u201d one online commenter wrote. But for Li, who works just six hours a day cleaning houses on a freelance basis, her\u00a0experience has been positive. She enjoys bonding with her clients and says each cleaning session makes her feel like more\u00a0than just a business transaction. \u201cCustomers will carefully pour water for us to drink. When it is time to eat, they will order\u00a0takeout for us, bring us food, and constantly remind us to drink water and rest,\u201d she said. So far, she said she has no regrets about quitting her office job. \u201cAfter a tiring day, I can go home and eat and do what I like without any extra mental\u00a0pressure,\u201d she said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/20/economy/china-economy-employment-blue-collar-work-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/22/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_07_21_politics_democratic-donors-harris-biden", "text": "Alan Kessler, a Philadelphia lawyer and longtime Democratic fundraiser, said the texts and emails began soon after news broke Sunday that President Joe Biden had withdrawn from the 2024 race and called for Vice President Kamala Harris to become his successor. One, in particular, summed up the mood among Biden\u2019s donors, he said. \u201cThis is transformative,\u201d the text from a major contributor read. After weeks of turmoil over the future of the Democratic ticket, Kessler said the campaign donors he\u2019s courted as a bundler for Biden\u2019s campaign are turning their full attention to Harris and committing to work on her behalf. \u201cThey\u2019re really excited, and they are all in,\u201d he said. In another sign of enthusiasm: Small-dollar donors contributed more than $27.5 million in the first five hours of Harris\u2019 presidential campaign, according to ActBlue, the online fundraising platform for Democratic candidates and causes. Harris will need the money. Although the Biden-Harris campaign and its affiliated committees outraised former President Donald Trump\u2019s political operation in June, newly filed campaign reports show the Trump team entered July and the general election showdown with a bigger war chest of available cash. The Biden campaign had dramatically outspent the Trump last month, drawing down the campaign\u2019s reserves \u2013 just as concerns grew about Biden\u2019s poor June 27 debate performance, putting future contributions at risk. On Sunday afternoon, the Biden campaign filed paperwork with federal election regulators, transforming itself into the \u201cHarris for President\u201d committee. But Harris is not yet the Democrats\u2019 presidential nominee. It\u2019s now up to some 4,700 delegates to decide who officially becomes the party\u2019s standard-bearer. Biden\u2019s withdrawal caps weeks of uncertainty and drama. Some Democratic donors were so alarmed by Biden\u2019s halting appearance on the debate stage that they declared an embargo on future giving to his campaign \u2013 and in some cases vowed to withhold contributions to down-ballot Democratic candidates \u2013 until the president agreed to withdraw from the race. On Sunday, after Biden\u2019s announcement, Biden campaign co-chair Cedric Richmond unleashed anger at some of those big donors, saying they had \u201ccreated a self-fulfilling prophecy\u201d by declining to give money to support Biden after his debate performance. \u201cYou can\u2019t win without money, and then they were going to point the finger at the candidate. They were going to blame it on Biden,\u201d Richmond said. \u201cFor a president that has accomplished so much, it was a no-win situation.\u201d Richmond also had this message to financial backers who had abandoned the president in recent weeks: \u201cNow those donors need to step the f**k up.\u201d \u2018DEMBARGO is lifted\u2019 \u201cSuffice to say, the DEMBARGO is lifted,\u201d Damon Lindelof, a Hollywood screenwriter and producer, wrote Sunday on Instagram. Lindelof was among the contributors who had called\u00a0on fellow Democratic donors\u00a0to stop writing campaign checks. He wrote that he felt \u201cprofound relief, gratitude \u2026 and then for the first time, genuine EXCITEMENT for the election ahead.\u201d The enthusiasm for Harris among the Democratic donor class was not universal, however. Florida lawyer John Morgan \u2013 an ardent Biden supporter and fundraiser for the president\u2019s reelection campaign \u2013 said he no longer plans to raise money for the White House effort because he\u2019s not persuaded that Harris is the strongest candidate Democrats could field. But Biden\u2019s endorsement essentially closes the door on a more open selection process that some in the party had sought, he said. The party would have been better served by \u201csomeone who will appear more moderate\u201d to voters, Morgan said, ticking off Govs. Andy Beshear of Kentucky, Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan and Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania as among preferred options. And he said he expects Republicans to quickly cast Harris as a \u201cCalifornia progressive\u201d who bungled efforts to stop illegal immigration at the southern border with Mexico, although he views that characterization as unfair. Morgan had planned a fundraiser for the Biden campaign in Florida, but those plans had been put on hold because of the tumult unleashed by the June 27 debate . Morgan said he already had collected $1 million for the event \u2013 money that now likely will benefit Harris \u2013 but will do no more. \u201cWill I vote for Harris? Yes,\u201d he said. \u201cWill I raise money? No.\u201d CNN\u2019s MJ Lee contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/21/politics/democratic-donors-harris-biden/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/22/2024", "section": "us"}}

{"id": "2024_07_18_us_seattle-police-officer-fired-jaahnavi-kandula", "text": "A Seattle police officer has been fired over the\u00a0\u201cdehumanizing laughter\u201d\u00a0and\u00a0\u201ccruel comments\u201d\u00a0he made after\u00a0the 2023 death of an\u00a0Indian graduate student\u00a0who was struck by a police vehicle, the police chief says. Seattle interim Police Chief Sue Rahr terminated former officer Daniel Auderer on Wednesday and justified her decision to the department in an internal email, attaching the department\u2019s disciplinary action report alongside it. \u201cThere is no doubt that the named officer\u2019s cruel comments and callous laughter about the tragic death caused deep pain to Ms. Kandula\u2019s family, but also immeasurable damage to the public trust of police in the Seattle community, across the nation, and around the world,\u201d Rahr wrote in the internal memo, noting many in the community said Auderer\u2019s \u201cdehumanizing laughter\u201d heard on video was \u201cmore outrageous and disturbing\u201d even than Kandula\u2019s death. \u201cIt is my duty as the leader of this organization to uphold the high standards necessary to maintain public trust,\u201d Rahr wrote. \u201cFor me to allow the officer to remain on our force would only bring further dishonor to the entire department.\u201d On January 23, 2023, Jaahnavi Kandula, a 23-year-old graduate student from Andhra Pradesh, India, was fatally struck by Seattle Police Officer Kevin Dave\u2019s police patrol vehicle while she on a crosswalk. Eight months after the incident, police released body-worn police camera footage\u00a0that captured a phone conversation in which Auderer, the day after he was sent to the scene to examine if the officer whose vehicle hit her had been impaired, can be heard laughing, saying Kandula\u2019s life had \u201climited value.\u201d \u201cBut she is dead,\u201d Auderer says on the body-worn camera footage, apparently in response to the person on the phone. \u201cNo, it\u2019s a regular person,\u201d Auderer then says. Moments later, he replies: \u201cYeah, just write a check\u201d and laughs. \u201cYeah, $11,000. She was 26 anyway,\u201d he adds, mistaking Kandula\u2019s age. \u201cShe had limited value.\u201d CNN has reached out to Auderer for comment but did not immediately receive a response. The video\u2019s release\u00a0last year sparked\u00a0outrage\u00a0across the nation, especially within the South Asian diaspora \u2013\u00a0inspiring rallies,\u00a0meetings with elected officials\u00a0and\u00a0online petitions\u00a0demanding justice for Kandula. It also grabbed the attention of onscreen celebrities like Priyanka Chopra, Farhan Akhtar and Lilly Singh, who posted online about her death. Auderer, who is also vice president of the Seattle Police Officers Guild, \u201cintended the comment as a mockery of lawyers,\u201d he wrote in an August 8 letter to the city\u2019s Office of Police Accountability\u00a0released by\u00a0the Seattle Police Officers Guild. \u201cI was imitating what a lawyer tasked with negotiating the case would be saying and being sarcastic to express that they shouldn\u2019t be coming up with crazy arguments to minimize the payment.\u201d CNN has reached out to the Seattle Police Officers Guild for comment. \u201cI believe the\u00a0impact\u00a0of his actions is so devastating that it cannot be mitigated by his\u00a0intent\u00a0to keep his conversation private,\u201d Rahr wrote in her email to the police department. \u201cThe hurt his words have inflicted on Ms. Kandula\u2019s family cannot be erased.\u201d \u201cThe actions (of) this individual police officer have brought shame on the Seattle Police Department and our entire profession, making the job of every police officer more difficult,\u201d she continued. The body-worn camera footage was provided to the King County Prosecutor\u2019s Office as part of the fatality case, according to Rahr. The office announced in February it would not file criminal charges against Dave \u2013 whose patrol vehicle struck Kandula \u2013 saying it \u201clacks sufficient evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Officer Kevin Dave was impaired by drugs or alcohol, driving in a reckless manner, or driving with disregard for the safety of others.\u201d The city\u2019s Office of Police Accountability recommended in January that Auderer be terminated following an investigation that found the officer violated the department\u2019s standards and duties policy and bias-free policing policy, a spokesperson told CNN. Kandula was from the Kurnool District in Andhra Pradesh and spoke Telugu, the president of the Telugu Association of North America, Niranjan Srungavarapu, previously told CNN. The group helped return her remains to India in January, he said. She had come to the United States in 2021 to pursue a master\u2019s degree in information systems in the College of Engineering at Northeastern University\u2019s Seattle campus, according to the school. She would have graduated in December. \u201cJaahnavi, a young soul full of dreams and hopes, came to the United States with the aspiration to pursue her master\u2019s degree and be a beacon of support for her family,\u201d the association said in a statement to its Seattle community and members. \u201cHer future was a shining light, cruelly extinguished.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/18/us/seattle-police-officer-fired-jaahnavi-kandula/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/22/2024", "section": "us"}}

The pilot, who was the only person on board, was conducting parachute operations prior to the crash, Tammy L. Jones, a spokesperson for the FAA, told CNN Saturday. It is unclear how many divers were on board before the crash, Niagara County Sheriff Michael Filicetti said at a news conference Saturday. A brush fire also reportedly began around the crash site, according to the release. The initial responding crew had to put out \u201ca significant fire at that point,\u201d Filicetti said. The sheriff called the plane crash \u201can unfortunate incident\u201d and added that local and federal law enforcement partners are working to determine what led to the crash. \u201cWell, I think this is like any other emergency-type incident. \u2026 You get here, you want to try to preserve life. Unfortunately, in this case, we couldn\u2019t do that,\u201d Filicetti said. A National Transportation Safety Board investigator is expected to be traveling to the crash site on Saturday, NTSB spokesperson Peter Knudson told CNN. The investigator will document the airplane wreckage, which will then be moved to a secure facility for further evaluation, Knudson said. The investigation will involve three primary areas: the pilot, the aircraft and the operating environment.

{"id": "2024_07_21_us_george-washington-tent-fragment-goodwill", "text": "As a collector of artifacts, Richard \u201cDana\u201d Moore makes a habit of scrolling through Goodwill\u2019s online thrift store, and one day in 2022, the history buff came across an item that piqued his interest.  A post in the historical documents section featured the image of a framed item purporting to contain a fragment of George Washington\u2019s tent. It came with a written note saying the tent had been displayed at an exposition commemorating the 300th anniversary of the founding of Jamestown in the Virginia Colony. \u201cI was like, \u2018This can\u2019t be.\u2019 So I was a little bit astonished,\u201d Moore told CNN. Moore was skeptical of the posting so he initially held off on bidding for two weeks. \u201cThere are a lot of fakes out there,\u201d he added. \u201cThere\u2019s always something that\u2019s not real, that looks to be real.\u201d Moore said he took a closer look at the torn note and determined it looked like it had aged over the years along with the fragment, which is 4 inches wide and over 5 inches long. \u201cI jumped in with both feet. I said, \u2018Hell with it.\u2019 I\u2019m\u00a0gonna\u00a0bid on it,\u201d he said. Moore told CNN that he bid a little over $1,700 on the artifact and won. He initially didn\u2019t tell his wife, Susan Bowen, and hid it in their home. Now, he said, she agrees that he hit it out of the park: The artifact was confirmed to be a piece of Washington\u2019s dining tent, and Moore estimates it to be worth tens of thousands of dollars. The artifact goes on display at a museum Moore contacted the Museum of the American Revolution in Philadelphia in February last year. He knew the museum held Washington\u2019s sleeping and office tent.  Matthew\u00a0Skic, curator of exhibitions, told CNN the museum was excited but first needed to confirm the fragment was actually a piece of one of Washington\u2019s war tents. Moore agreed to send the artifact to the museum for a conservator to look at the weave of the fabric. \u201cWhat\u2019s really fascinating about this particular fragment is it retains some of the red wool trim on the edge of it, and that was telling us that this was likely cut away from the edge of the roof of the dining marquee,\u201d\u00a0Skic\u00a0said. While the museum is still trying to determine which gap the fragment might fill, its binding and hand-stitched linen point to it being the real thing. Also, the note that it came with is appropriate for the time period. Once the museum confirmed the fabric\u2019s authenticity they were excited to feature it alongside the rest of the planned exhibit around Washington\u2019s sleeping and office war tent. \u201cThis one is a lot of fun because it came from an unlikely spot,\u201d Skic said. \u201cYou don\u2019t expect to find these kinds of historical treasures in a place like that, although this is not the first historical treasure that has come up via Goodwill.\u201d The fragment, on loan from Moore, was put on display for public view in February of this year as part of the museum\u2019s exhibit Witness to Revolution: The Unlikely Travels of Washington\u2019s Tent. The fragment will stay in the museum until January 5, 2025, and then it will be returned to Moore. The dining tent that Moore\u2019s fragment belongs to is now being held at the Smithsonian. It is not on display for public view. Symbols of Washington\u2019s leadership George Washington\u2019s tents, as explained by the museum, have nearly 250 years of history. The tents, used during the Revolutionary War, held his sleeping and office quarters where he led meetings, planned strategies and wrote letters. Over the years, the tents became a symbol of Washington\u2019s leadership and the founding of the country following the Revolution. The fragment was likely cut off the dining tent by a man named John Burns, who saw the tent on display in Norfolk, Virginia, at the exposition commemorating the founding of Jamestown. The tent itself was on loan from Mary Custis Lee, the great-granddaughter of Washington\u2019s wife, Martha. Lee\u2019s father, George Washington Parke Custis, later owned the Revolutionary War tents and frequently set them up to host events. Two hundred years ago, he started cutting away pieces of George Washington\u2019s tents as souvenirs. \u201cGeorge Washington Parke Custis was seeing the tent as a way to connect people to the past. And there might have been a similar mindset in 1907 when this, this fragment of the dining marquee, was cut,\u201d Skic said. There are fragments known to have been cut by Parke Custis. But Skic said there is still more to be learned from this fragment, especially about who Burns, the note\u2019s author, might be. Currently, Moore is the only\u00a0known private owner of a piece of Washington\u2019s tent. All of the others are in the Smithsonian and other museums. Moore said knowing he bought the fragment gives him chills at night. It isn\u2019t about the money or recognition for him. It\u2019s about \u201cbreaking away from British rule and the beginnings of our country.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s the history behind it. Can you imagine the information and the things that were said within that tent?\u201d Moore asked rhetorically. Moore and his wife visited the museum earlier this month and said they were filled with emotion at the sight of the artifact.  \u201cI never got chills like that in my entire life,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were both over the moon. We still can\u2019t believe it.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/21/us/george-washington-tent-fragment-goodwill/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/22/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_07_21_politics_delegates-democratic-ticket-harris", "text": "Democratic convention delegates are draining the political drama from Joe Biden\u2019s decision to give up the presidential nomination by quickly coalescing around his chosen successor, Vice President Kamala Harris. The North Carolina\u00a0and Tennessee delegations\u00a0came out in unanimous support of Harris late Sunday. South Carolina Democrats also delivered a public vote of confidence. Harris\u2019 swift ascent provides some rare good news for Democrats who have been agonizing over Biden\u2019s fate for weeks. Biden\u2019s endorsement has weight, but no formal bearing on the process.\u00a0The makeup of ticket now rests with\u00a0the roughly 4,700 delegates\u00a0who will, in the coming weeks, vote for a new standard-bearer. Interviews with more than two dozen delegates in the immediate aftermath of Biden\u2019s announcement suggest the vice president is the clear leader. Delegates pledged to Biden are under no obligation to support his choice, but their loyalty to him and his wishes suggests the lion\u2019s share will quickly fall in line behind Harris. Many already have; some are now contacting other delegates, with no input yet from Harris\u2019 campaign, to shore up her support. \u201cEvery one of us (delegates) were vetted and worked for Biden or the Biden campaign in some way, whether we volunteered or donated or something. These are all Biden people,\u201d said Joe Caiazzo, a Biden delegate from Massachusetts who praised the president\u2019s \u201cselfless, patriotic\u201d decision. What follows is less than certain \u2013 and unprecedented in modern political history. Current party rules were largely designed to pass the nominating process off to primary voters and ahead of an orderly, made-for-TV roll call vote to confirm their choice. But that pro forma process is not set in stone. The Democratic National Committee will likely need to do more work, either through interpretation of their existing rules or by passing new ones, to clarify the next steps. \u201cIn short order, the American people will hear from the Democratic Party on next steps and the path forward for the nomination process,\u201d DNC Chair Jaime Harrison said on Sunday. Even before Biden\u2019s bolt landed, Democrats were at odds over when and how the nominating vote would take place. Under a proposed plan outlined Friday to the convention rules committee, it would be up to Harrison and convention chair Minyon Moore to set a specific date for voting to begin, though not before August 1. Delegates would vote via digital ballots, with at least 24 hours\u2019 notice, much like they did in 2020 during the largely remote convention. That year, voting ran for nearly two weeks and, of the 4,747 ballots they sent out, only over a dozen were not returned, according to Andrew Binns, a senior adviser to the convention. An open letter from more than 75 current and former DNC members, shared with CNN, praised Biden for his decision to give way \u201cto a new generation of public servants\u201d and insisted that Harris is \u201cthe only person that can credibly claim the torch from the Biden-Harris Administration.\u201d \u201cWe also firmly believe that Vice President Harris and her Vice Presidential selection will help Democratic candidates for U.S. House, Senate, and in the states we need to win in November, enabling us to enact laws that truly benefit the American people,\u201d the authors said, addressing one of the concerns that led so many Democratic lawmakers to call for Biden to step aside. In the critical swing state of Michigan, where party chair Lavora Barnes almost immediately endorsed Biden, the leadership of the \u201cuncommitted\u201d movement \u2013 which won about 30 delegates during a protest campaign against the president\u2019s handling of Israel\u2019s war in Gaza \u2013 opened the door for Harris. \u201cIt\u2019s time to align our actions with our values,\u201d said Layla Elabed in a statement datelined Dearborn, a Detroit suburb where\u00a0more than half\u00a0of the population is of Middle Eastern or North African descent. \u201cVice President Harris can start the process to earn back trust by turning the page from Biden\u2019s horrific policies in Gaza.\u201d Harris made headlines in March when she called for a ceasefire in Gaza during a speech on the anniversary of \u201cBloody Sunday\u201d at the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama. One California delegate, who like others spoke to CNN on the condition of anonymity to offer a candid assessment in this pivotal moment, said he\u2019s \u201crelieved\u201d and \u201cexcited\u201d after hearing Biden stepped down. The delegate, who wanted Biden to quit the race after seeing his shaky performance in last month\u2019s presidential debate, said he hoped Harris would replace Biden at the top of the ticket, calling her the \u201cstrongest\u201d candidate. Another California delegate said she\u2019s \u201cfeeling a huge sense of relief.\u201d She had privately been concerned about Biden\u2019s viability following the debate and hoped for weeks he would step aside. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t go on like that any longer,\u201d the delegate said, \u201cwithout jeopardizing the entire election up and down the ballot.\u201d A Massachusetts delegate told CNN that while he still strongly supports Biden\u2019s agenda, the president\u2019s \u201cvision has failed to reach Americans.\u201d The delegate said he has not yet decided who to support for the nomination, and believes the party needs a leader who \u201ccan help Americans understand what\u2019s at stake.\u201d Another erstwhile Biden delegate from Colorado said, \u201cIt is long overdue that there is a competitive nomination for president\u201d at the Democratic convention. She also told CNN she\u2019s not yet decided on who to support for the nomination. When asked about Harris, the delegate said she\u2019s not convinced the vice president can win in November. \u201cIt is not clear that (Harris) is the best candidate to defeat Donald Trump,\u201d she said. A delegate from Florida told CNN he\u2019s \u201cdisappointed\u201d Biden dropped out and said Democrats owe Biden \u201ca debt of gratitude\u201d for winning the 2020 election and \u201csetting up Democrats to defeat Trump again.\u201d He said he\u2019s taking his cues from Biden and plans to back Harris, who has been making calls to Democratic lawmakers asking for their support as she tries to consolidate the party over the coming days. In South\u00a0Carolina, one\u00a0Democratic delegate told CNN they were \u201csad\u201d to hear the news, noting that the Palmetto State had been so critical in Biden\u2019s primary victory four years ago. \u201cWe saved and relaunched Biden\u2019s campaign, so it\u2019s sad to see his electoral career \u2013 that we take a lot of pride in - come to an end,\u201d the delegate said, while also warning that this affection and loyalty would not necessarily be passed on to Harris. The delegate told CNN they would prefer Harris \u201cwins in a competitive process,\u201d reasoning that that \u201cshe\u2019d be a stronger nominee if she isn\u2019t anointed.\u201d\u00a0Though getting the support of Rep. Jim Clyburn, the state\u2019s most powerful Democrats and a close Biden ally, could settle the matter, \u201cHe\u2019s still the titan of politics in\u00a0South\u00a0Carolina,\u201d the delegate said. \u201cIs he going to put his full shoulder into whipping for Harris? That\u2019s all unanswered,\u201d In a statement issued shortly after Biden\u2019s, Harris on Sunday confirmed she is running for president and said she was \u201chonored\u201d to receive Biden\u2019s endorsement. Harris said she intends to \u201cearn and win\u201d the presidential nomination in her first public statement since Biden\u2019s stunning announcement. \u201cOver the past year, I have traveled across the country, talking with Americans about the clear choice in this momentous election. And that is what I will continue to do in the days and weeks ahead,\u201d Harris said, before hinting at the condensed timeframe. \u201cWe have 107 days until Election Day. Together, we will fight. And together, we will win.\u201d Shasti Conrad, chair of the Washington state Democrats, said the party is currently calling all their delegates to get a \u201ctemperature check\u201d and make sure everyone has up-to-date information on the process ahead. They have a group call scheduled for later Sunday. Conrad, who officially endorsed Harris, is the first South Asian women to lead a state party and said she is \u201cthrilled\u201d that Harris is on track to become the nominee. \u201cIt really means that we are fully a part of this American story,\u201d Conrad said, \u201cand that people who look like her and look like myself in this country have a place in leadership.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/21/politics/delegates-democratic-ticket-harris/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/22/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_07_17_us_navy-exonerates-black-sailors-port-explosion", "text": "The US Navy has exonerated 256 Black sailors who were found to be unjustly punished in 1944 following a horrific port explosion that killed hundreds of service members and exposed racist double standards among the then-segregated ranks. On July 17, 1944, munitions being loaded onto a cargo ship detonated, causing secondary blasts that ignited 5,000 tons of explosives at Port Chicago naval weapons station near San Francisco. The explosion killed 320 sailors and civilians, nearly 75% of whom were Black, and injured another 400 personnel. Surviving Black sailors had to pick up the human remains and clear the blast site while White officers were granted leave to recuperate. The pier was a critical ammunition supply site for forces in the Pacific during World War II, and the job of loading those ships was left primarily to Black enlisted sailors overseen by White officers. Before the explosion, the Black sailors working the dock had expressed concerns about the loading operations. Shortly after the blast, they were ordered to return to loading ships even though no changes had been made to improve their safety. The sailors refused, saying they needed training on how to more safely handle the bombs before they returned. What followed affected the rest of their lives, including punishments that kept them from receiving honorable discharges even as the vast majority returned to work at the pier under immense pressure and served throughout the war. Fifty sailors who held fast to their demands for safety and training were tried as a group on charges of conspiracy to commit mutiny and were convicted and sent to prison. The whole episode was unjust, and none of the sailors received the legal due process they were owed, Navy Secretary Carlos Del Toro said in an interview with The Associated Press. It was \u201ca horrific situation for those Black sailors that remained,\u201d Del Toro said. The Navy\u2019s office of general counsel reviewed the military judicial proceedings used to punish the sailors and found \u201cthere were so many inconsistencies and so many legal violations that came to the forefront,\u201d he said. Thurgood Marshall, who was then a defense attorney for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, defended the 50 sailors who were convicted of mutiny. Marshall went on to become the first Black justice on the Supreme Court. On Wednesday, the 80th anniversary of the Port Chicago disaster, Del Toro signed paperwork officially clearing the sailors, who are now deceased. Del Toro handed the first pen to Thurgood Marshall Jr., the late justice\u2019s son. The exonerations \u201care deeply moving,\u201d Marshall Jr. said. \u201cThey, of course, are all gone, and that\u2019s a painful aspect of it. But so many fought for so long for that kind of fairness and recognition.\u201d President Joe Biden said the decision to exonerate is \u201crighting a historic wrong.\u201d In the appeal of their courts martial convictions, then-NAACP attorney Marshall wrote that \u201cjustice can only be done in this case by a complete reversal of findings,\u201d Biden said in a statement. \u201cWith this action, we are answering that call.\u201d The events have stung surviving family members for decades, but an earlier effort in the 1990s to pardon the sailors fell short. Two additional sailors were previously cleared \u2013 one was found mentally incompetent to stand trial, and one was cleared on insufficient evidence. Wednesday\u2019s action goes beyond a pardon and vacates the military judicial proceedings carried out in 1944 against all of the men. \u201cThis decision clears their names and restores their honor and acknowledges the courage that they displayed in the face of immense danger,\u201d Del Toro said. The racism\u00a0that the Black sailors faced reflected the military\u2019s views at the time \u2013 ranks were segregated, and the Navy had only reluctantly opened some positions it considered less desirable to Black service members. The official court of inquiry looking into why the explosion occurred cleared all the White officers and praised them for the \u201cgreat effort\u201d they had to exert to run the dock. It left open the suggestion that the Black sailors were to blame for the accident. Del Toro\u2019s action converts the discharges to honorable unless there other circumstances surrounded them. After the Navy upgrades the discharges, surviving family members can work with the Department of Veterans Affairs on past benefits that may be owed, the Navy said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/17/us/navy-exonerates-black-sailors-port-explosion/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/22/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_07_19_us_taylor-casey-bahamas-missing-chicago", "text": "It\u2019s been a month since anyone reported seeing Taylor Casey. She was last spotted near Paradise Island in the Bahamas on June 19. Still, her loved ones are making sure she is being seen \u2013 by publicly campaigning for her safe return. Chicagoan Casey is described by friends and family as someone who defies \u201cboundaries and definitions,\u201d and a person \u201ceveryone notices when she enters a room.\u201d When members of her community gathered July 11 to mark Casey\u2019s 42nd birthday, plead with Bahamian police to keep searching for her and ask federal agencies to provide assistance, the event included balloons, snacks, games and bubbles. One reason support for finding Casey has been so monumental is that she is an \u201camazing, amazing friend,\u201d said Jacqueline Boyd, Casey\u2019s close friend and \u201cchosen family\u201d member for 17 years. \u201cAnybody that has been in a room with her is really, really devastated right now, personally impacted and motivated to action,\u201d Boyd told CNN.  \u201cAnd it is fully a reflection of how Taylor shows up for us.\u201d Casey is an artist, a hairstylist, an Air Force veteran, a community worker and a woman of faith, Boyd said. She was born in south suburban Harvey, Illinois, and most recently lived in Rogers Park in Chicago. Casey had worked at the Chicago Freedom School as a program manager developing youth programs and had done some work with Howard Brown Health in HIV testing and prevention, her close friend Emily Williams told CNN. \u201cTaylor\u2019s favorite things are flowers and gardens and just peace,\u201d said her mother, Colette Seymore. \u201cTaylor is a very gentle spirit. Taylor just loves people, loves to help people, cares about people, cares about justice (and) fairness.\u201d \u201cLove is an action,\u201d Seymore said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just a word \u2026 and Taylor was good for that (and) showing you that she loved you.\u201d Seymore told CNN she and Casey have outings together to carnivals and restaurants and go on nature walks. She recounts a time she didn\u2019t know Casey had stopped by her house until Seymore got a call. \u201cShe called me and said, \u2018Mom, look outside your door.\u2019 And I looked outside my door, and it was one little flower,\u201d Seymore said. \u201cTaylor had come and planted a flower on the side of my side door.\u201d Casey was getting a yoga instructor certification at Sivananda Ashram Yoga when she went missing. She was last seen at the ashram and was reported missing when she didn\u2019t show up for morning classes on June 20. Nature, especially the beach, was Casey\u2019s \u201cplace of peace,\u201d and why her circle was so excited to see her go to the ashram, said Williams. \u201cTaylor had been looking forward to it for a long time, and it seemed really idyllic.\u201d Williams said she wishes \u201cwe could have been there to protect Taylor.\u201d Police found her phone in the water near a boating dock on June 24, but have been unable to access its contents, authorities said. Investigators in the Bahamas asked American authorities for help unlocking the phone, but they also had no luck, Police Commissioner Clayton Fernander said at a news conference. It\u2019s unclear where the Royal Bahamas Police Force investigation stands. CNN has reached out to the Bahamian police for comment and has received no response. According to Seymore and Williams, they have received minimal updates from authorities. However, they thanked the staff for US senators from Illinois for keeping in contact with them. Casey\u2019s family were told to expect an update last week from the Bahamian authorities but have not heard back, according to Williams and Seymore. A\u00a0July 14 statement\u00a0from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on behalf of the Consul General of the Bahamas notes the Royal Bahamas Police Force is cooperating with the family and conducting a full and thorough investigation, which remains open. \u201cWe want to receive these updates about the full investigation that they\u2019re doing and the thorough work that (they\u2019re) doing. We want to hear that. The fact of the matter is that we haven\u2019t heard that from them. So, I think that that\u2019s telling,\u201d Williams told CNN. \u201cThis, for us, is about finding Taylor. It\u2019s not about anything else,\u201d she continued. \u201cEverything that we have talked about (and) everything that we have shared has been with the intention of finding Taylor.\u201d A complex identity Casey is described as a \u201cfixture of Chicago\u2019s transgender community,\u201d in a\u00a0news release shared\u00a0July 10 on a social media account dedicated to finding her. \u201cTaylor\u2019s disappearance has sent shockwaves through Chicago\u2019s LGBTQ+ community,\u201d the release read. The first week or so after Casey\u2019s disappearance, Boyd said, was filled with \u201cconfusion and shock.\u201d Yet, the first order of business was to make sure there was a thorough investigation. Casey\u2019s loved ones chose to wait until widely sharing Casey\u2019s gender identity in connection with her case. Amid the devastation and initial communication with authorities, Boyd said family and friends asked themselves: \u201cHow can we talk about the person we love so much whose gender is more complex than most people can understand \u2013 and do that lovingly?\u201d They decided that during \u201cshock and grief (was) not the time,\u201d Boyd said. \u201cI can\u2019t even express to folks who are not part of the community how frequently we lose our women (and) how frequently our Black trans women are just gone, usually due to some form of violence or something really, really unfortunate happening,\u201d Boyd told CNN. \u201cYou\u2019re really hoping against hope that there\u2019s some other reason why this person\u2019s gone. So, protecting her privacy (and) protecting her ability to speak for herself about her own gender \u2013 that she never wanted on a national stage \u2013 for me, that was top priority.\u201d Boyd said Casey\u2019s gender is more to her than just that of a transgender woman, adding how others understand their own gender is \u201cdeeply personal.\u201d \u201cWhile Taylor is a Black trans woman, there are worlds within that that are not a neat compartmentalization,\u201d Boyd said, explaining that Casey\u2019s views are more \u201cgender expansive.\u201d Many close to Casey believe her gender identity has impacted the investigation. For a missing young White woman, Williams says, there is much media coverage and resources. \u201cTaylor is just as deserving (of that),\u201d she told CNN. Casey is \u2018not a person that just gives up\u2019 Apart from Casey\u2019s return, Boyd hopes the ongoing investigation will lead to getting involvement and assistance from federal authorities. That way family and friends \u201ccan know every stone has been turned over,\u201d she said. The US State Department is aware of reports of a missing US citizen in the Bahamas, a spokesperson told CNN but declined to comment on Casey\u2019s case specifically. When a US citizen is missing, the department works with local authorities and communicates with families openly, the spokesperson said. When asked for comment, the FBI referred CNN to the Royal Bahamas Police Force. For Seymore, every day gets harder. \u201cWhen somebody dies, the longer it is (and) as time goes by, it gets easier. Not really easier, but it gets easier,\u201d she said. \u201cBut this is not getting easier for me \u2026 I wake up every morning just so sad.\u201d She does have hope and believes Casey is alive, added Seymore. It also puts \u201ca smile on (her) face\u201d when she thinks of all the community work her daughter has done. \u201cI hope that people take this opportunity to have a different conversation about how we see each other and understand each other\u2019s identities,\u201d Boyd said. \u201cThat\u2019s my other hope; that Taylor is honored from a place of letting people be curious, nuanced and open to seeing people as a whole person, not just one identity.\u201d Williams takes solace in the fact that Casey is \u201cstrong\u201d mentally and physically. \u201cI believe that it\u2019s those things that are keeping her alive and that would give us the best chance of finding her and bringing her home,\u201d she said. \u201cTaylor doesn\u2019t give up. Taylor is not a person that just gives up,\u201d Seymore told CNN. Seymore also hopes to get the financial resources to hire a lawyer and a private investigator since \u201cthe people over in the Bahamas are not doing all that they can to find my child, so we need help.\u201d \u201cTaylor is somebody who we all keep looking for \u2026 this is not going to drop. Chicago is a city of workers and organizers, and we are ready to do absolutely everything we can to find her, and she deserves that. She deserves that from our country,\u201d Boyd said.

{"id": "2024_07_21_us_tech-outage-flight-cancellations-united-delta-airlines", "text": "More than 1,500 US flights have been canceled for the third day straight, as airlines struggle to recover from a global tech outage that left thousands of passengers stranded at airports. Around 1,600 flights into, within or out of the United States were canceled by Sunday evening, while more than 8,500 US flights were delayed, according to the tracking website\u00a0FlightAware.com. More than 1,000 of those cancelations were from Delta Air Lines, the website shows. The airline is continuing its recovery efforts following \u201can outside vendor technology issue\u201d resulting in delays and cancelations, Delta said\u00a0Sunday. The airline is communicating directly with some impacted customers, offering travel vouchers, waivers and SkyMiles Program miles, it said. In an update to Delta customers Sunday afternoon, Delta Air Lines CEO Ed Bastian said the airline\u2019s teams are still working to recover their system and restore operations. \u201cCanceling a flight is always a last resort, and something we don\u2019t take lightly,\u201d Bastian said. On Saturday, 2,136 flights among multiple carriers were canceled, and more than 21,300 flights were delayed, according to\u00a0FlightAware. The issue extended beyond airports, with businesses, government agencies, health and emergency services, banks, schools and universities around the world grinding to a halt or seeing services disrupted due to a\u00a0flawed software update\u00a0for Microsoft Windows operating systems issued by the cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike,\u00a0experts told CNN. The outage affected an estimated 8.5 million Windows devices, according to Microsoft. CrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz\u00a0apologized\u00a0to customers and said a fix has been deployed, but\u00a0experts say\u00a0getting systems back in order will be a lengthy process. Major airlines have said services are being restored, but there could be more delays and disruptions. A majority of\u00a0United\u00a0Airlines\u00a0systems\u00a0have\u00a0recovered\u00a0from Friday\u2019s outage, though some delays and cancellations are still possible, the airline\u00a0said in a statement. More than 400 United flights were canceled Saturday, and over 200 flights were canceled Sunday, according to\u00a0FlightAware.com. Delta has paused unaccompanied minor travel until Wednesday due to the outage, the airline announced over the weekend. Unaccompanied children who are already booked on a Delta flight will not be able to travel, and the airline has asked that no new flights be booked for them. Also impacted was American Airlines, which said in a statement  Friday \u201cwe were able to safely reestablish our operation\u201d and it had \u201cissued a travel waiver for our customers impacted by the vendor technology issue earlier this morning.\u201d Allegiant Air said in a statement Saturday while \u201cnormal operations have resumed\u201d after the outage, they\u2019re processing a backlog of customer messages and troubleshooting their programs and platforms. Even with the flawed computer update rolled back, it\u2019s not a quick fix for airlines, which have computers at thousands of gates that will need to be individually manually rebooted, David Kennedy, cofounder of cybersecurity company Binary Defense,\u00a0told CNN on Saturday. \u201cIt\u2019s not just as simple as rebooting. There\u2019s a lot more steps and complexities in this that are involved,\u201d Kennedy said. \u201cThere\u2019s just not enough people at those airports, at those locations to go and do it.\u201d The US Department of Transportation on Friday said it determined the flight delays and cancelations resulting from the system outage were \u201ccontrollable,\u201d meaning they\u2019re \u201cattributable to the airline.\u201d In such cases, the airlines \u201cmust adhere to their customer service commitments.\u201d Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg in a social media post Saturday said he received reports of some airlines only offering flight credits to passengers for canceled flights. \u201cLet me be clear \u2014 you are entitled to get your money back promptly if your flight is canceled and you don\u2019t take a rebooking,\u201d Buttigieg said. Travelers upset as plans are thwarted Flight cancelations persist at the world\u2019s\u00a0busiest\u00a0airport,\u00a0Atlanta\u2019s\u00a0Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport, where officials have implemented a \u201cconcessions crisis plan, ensuring concessions availability while all flights are operating.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve provided assistance and guidance to passengers spending the night in the airport, and we\u2019re collaborating with our airlines to create space for luggage reunification areas,\u201d an airport spokesperson told CNN on Sunday. \u201cIt just seems like nobody cares about us. We\u2019re sleeping on the floor. There\u2019s kids sleeping on the floor and no one\u2019s done anything about it,\u201d traveler Anthony Augugliaro told CNN affiliate WSB on Sunday. Long lines of passengers also waited for assistance at the airport Saturday. Delta passenger Catalina Villareal described the scene: \u201cMayhem. Chaos. Frustration. Hunger.\u201d Villareal said she had experienced three flights cancellations. Charlotte Yeh, a traveler at Boston Logan International Airport, told CNN affiliate WFXT Saturday she received no notification her flight to Fort Lauderdale for her father\u2019s 96th birthday was canceled. Thousands of people face the same uncertainty as they cram together in airports across the country, waiting for answers. \u201cI was supposed to be in California for my mom\u2019s wedding,\u201d Richard Whitfield of Pasco County, Florida, told CNN on Saturday. Whitfield and his partner, Jonathan Shade, left Tampa on Thursday and missed their connecting flight in Atlanta due to poor weather conditions, delaying their landing and forcing the plane to refuel in Tallahassee. After their rescheduled flight on Friday was delayed many times, the couple\u00a0decided to cancel the trip and just head home. But with no available flights back to Tampa on Friday night, they spent their second night in an airport hotel. They were unable to get a voucher from Delta for either of their stays. \u201c(Richard has) been on hold for 24 hours,\u201d Shade told CNN. \u201cWhen he eventually got his number in line, it was 2,001.\u201d Two hours later, Richard\u2019s place in Delta Air Lines\u2019 virtual customer service queue was 2,300 in line, Shade said. Whitfield told CNN the whole ordeal has had an impact on him. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s been the domino effect that it has on humanity and everything that we need to survive: food, sleep, or water, housing,\u201d he said. After spending 48 hours in Atlanta, they found a Saturday evening flight back to Tampa they say they can only hope is not delayed or canceled. For now, there is nothing the couple can do but wait and \u201cget a good stiff drink,\u201d Shade and Whitfield said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/21/us/tech-outage-flight-cancellations-united-delta-airlines/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/22/2024", "section": "us"}}

How did the crash unfold? Which systems have recovered, and which ones are still affected? We break it down. (All times Eastern Time.) Late Thursday night and early Friday, 911 centers and transportation services are disrupted Overnight on Thursday and into Friday, several states, including Alaska and Arizona, experience 911 service outages. Some hospitals also begin experiencing technology issues overnight, according to nurses on shift. Between 2 and 3 a.m., the Federal Aviation Administration announces that all Delta and American Airlines flights are grounded. Several minutes later, the FAA says flights from United and Allegiant Airlines have been grounded regardless of their destination. Spirit Airlines says its flight reservation system has also been affected by the outage. A few hours later, between 5 and 6 a.m., public transit systems in the Northeast begin announcing that they have been impacted. Washington, DC, public transportation services \u2014 including trains and buses \u2014 begin experiencing delays, according to the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority. In New York City, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, North America\u2019s largest transportation network, says customer information systems have gone temporarily offline, but train and bus services remain unaffected. At 5:30 a.m., US cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike tells customers that it was \u201caware of reports of crashes\u201d of its software on Microsoft Windows operating systems, according to a company advisory viewed by CNN.\u00a0CrowdStrike\u2019s cybersecurity software \u2014\u00a0used by numerous Fortune 500 companies \u2014\u00a0detects and blocks hacking threats.

Global banks start reporting some service disruptions, including Australia\u2019s Commonwealth Bank, South Africa\u2019s Capitec, and the Bank of Israel. Australian lenders ANZ and Westpac were also impacted, according to Downdetector, a website that tracks cyber outages. Downdetector has also reported issues for New Zealand\u2019s ASB Bank. Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler issues an emergency declaration in response to the outage that affected Bureau of Emergency Communication\u2019s Computer Aided Dispatch system that is used for fielding emergency calls. The bureau begins taking calls manually, according to the mayor\u2019s office. Meanwhile, United Airlines announces that it is resuming \u201csome flights.\u201d Between 8 and 9 a.m., some flights resume but airports brace for a busy day Delta Air Lines resumes some flight departures and issues travel waivers to affected customers. A spokesperson for Atlanta\u2019s Hartsfield Jackson International Airport said that systems were operational and the airport put in place additional customer service personnel to address the challenges they\u2019re facing. The spokesperson urged customers to \u201chave patience. We\u2019re trying to have grace and patience with all of the passengers. We\u2019re asking the same.\u201d Later Friday morning, Charlotte Douglas International Airport, an American Airlines hub, advises passengers to not go to the airport \u201cunless they have confirmed their flight information with the airline.\u201d Officials at Miami International Airport, another American Airlines hub, likewise warn travelers that US Customs and Border Protection operations have been affected nationwide, \u201cso international passenger arrivals are currently being processed manually at a slower pace.\u201d Between 9 a.m. and noon, federal agencies get involved and Biden is briefed A little before 9 a.m., Alaska State Troopers and Phoenix Police Department in Arizona say that service at its 911 centers are once again operational after emergency and non-emergency call centers were impacted. Portland\u2019s Computer Aided Dispatch system also comes back online at 9 a.m. \u201cAt no time was the community\u2019s ability to make 911 calls impacted,\u201d the mayor\u2019s office says in a news release. \u201cThe critical, life-saving services of public safety bureaus, including Police and Fire & Rescue, continue.\u201d The Federal Communications Commission announces it is working with federal agencies to provide assistance and determine the extent of the outage after it was made aware of \u201creports of a systems outage causing disruptions in service, including 911.\u201d President Joe Biden is briefed on the CrowdStrike outage and his team is in touch with CrowdStrike and impacted entities, says a White House official. The president\u2019s team is also engaged with agencies \u201cto get sector by sector updates throughout the day and is standing by to provide assistance as needed,\u201d according to the official. Around this time, an increasing number of federal agencies begin getting involved and reporting service disruptions. The US Department of Homeland Security says in a statement on X they are \u201cworking with CrowdStrike, Microsoft and our federal, state, local and critical infrastructure partners to fully assess and address system outages.\u201d Social Security offices close to the public, as the agency warns the public that \u201clonger wait times on our national 800 number are expected.\u201d In an internal memo viewed by CNN, the US Department of Justice says it is feeling some impact from the technology outage and, while it\u2019s working on workarounds, notes it does not have an \u201cestimated restoration time.\u201d Mail carriers UPS and FedEx tell CNN they were also impacted by the outage. UPS says its airline is operational and its drivers are on the roads, but there may be some service delays. A little after 11 a.m., CrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz says in a post on X, the firm \u201c(understands) the gravity of the situation and are deeply sorry for the inconvenience and disruption,\u201d adding that the incident was not a cyber attack, and that customers\u2019 data remains protected. \u201cThe issue has been identified and a fix has been deployed,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was an issue with a Falcon content update for Windows Hosts.\u201d Late morning through early afternoon: canceled doctors and DMV appointments The Massachusetts Department of Transportation announces that some Registry of Motor Vehicle operations are impacted. Other states also report impacts to their driving services, including Georgia, North Carolina, Texas and Tennessee. Around the same time, several of the nation\u2019s healthcare and hospital systems announce they have been impacted by the global outage, including Mass General Brigham hospital system in Massachusetts, Penn Medicine in Pennsylvania, Northwell Health in New York, and Emory Healthcare in Atlanta. While some hospitals report delays in services, others cancel some non-urgent surgeries and medical office visits. Several cancer centers, including Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston and New York\u2019s Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center say they have paused certain procedures and scheduled appointments. In British Columbia, the Provincial Health Services Authority (PHSA) announces its health system has been impacted, and is working on implementing contingency plans in order to ensure care for patients. Late afternoon sees more medical disruptions Around 4 p.m., New York Blood Center, a supplier of blood to approximately 200 hospitals in the Northeast United States, says it has put in place an emergency driving operation to distribute blood. \u201cThe test tubes are not making it onto planes from yesterday and today, requiring for us to drive them,\u201d New York Blood Center\u2019s senior vice president Andrea Cefarelli told CNN in a phone call. \u201cThere is going to be a 12-24 hour delay in getting the test results.\u201d Blood Centers of America, which rely on shipping companies like FedEx, says it is experiencing delays in reporting test results.\u00a0Executive Vice President Jenny Ficenec says blood usage may be down due to hospitals canceling elective surgeries, so the delay should not cause any shortages unless the problem persists. Blood\u00a0Assurance, which provides blood to hospitals in a number of Southeast states, including Tennessee, Georgia, North Carolina and Virginia, says its planned shipment of at least 20\u00a0platelets has been postponed due to flight delays and cancellations caused by the outage. \u201cWe are asking community members to help through donation,\u201d\u00a0Blood\u00a0Assurance says in an email to CNN. \u201cWe have a fantastic community of donors that always shows up when we need them.\u201d Meanwhile, CrowdStrike CEO Kurtz takes to social media again and promises customers \u201cfull transparency\u201d on how the global IT outage involving the company\u2019s software occurred. CrowdStrike would take steps \u201cto prevent anything like this from happening again,\u201d according to a statement on the company\u2019s website. Saturday morning: massive flight delays In a statement Saturday morning, Microsoft estimates the outage affected 8.5 million Windows devices. That\u2019s less 1% of all Windows machines, according to Microsoft, but the company adds that \u201cthe broad economic and societal impacts reflect the use of CrowdStrike by enterprises that run many critical services.\u201d Various sectors are still feeling the aftershocks of the outage. Although airlines have largely resumed services, many tell customers that they expect disruptions in schedules to continue. As of noon on Saturday, at least 3,375 flights across the United States have been delayed and more than 1,200 canceled, according to data from flight tracker FlightAware. Atlanta\u2019s Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport, the nation\u2019s busiest airport, remains the most affected.

Still, over 600 Delta flights have been canceled Saturday. \u201cAdditional cancelations are expected as some of Delta\u2019s technology continues to recover from Friday morning\u2019s vendor-caused issue,\u201d the update said. Jetstar Japan, Hong Kong Express and Cebu Pacific airlines said Saturday their operations are gradually being restored too. Cybercriminals capitalized on the chaos by promoting fake websites filled with malicious software designed to compromise unsuspecting victims, according to warnings from the US government and multiple cybersecurity professionals. Former McAfee CEO Dave DeWalt told CNN a group of private sector and government agencies worked overnight to \u201cascertain the threat\u201d and find a solution to the global outage. The call included the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency and other private and government organizations. CrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz apologized to customers Friday for the outage and said the company is working with those affected. \u201cWe understand the gravity of the situation and are deeply sorry for the inconvenience and disruption,\u201d Kurtz posted on X. \u201cWe are working with all impacted customers to ensure that systems are back up and they can deliver the services their customers are counting on.\u201d But it could be easier said than done: Manual restarts of individual systems take time and expertise some customers don\u2019t have, which is why companies have been slow to recover from the outage. Chaos continues for travelers Frustrated passengers lined up at airports backed up with flight cancellations and delays, some missing life events like funerals and birthdays. At Atlanta\u2019s Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport, long lines of passengers waited for assistance Saturday, with many flights still canceled or delayed. \u201cI was supposed to be in California for my mom\u2019s wedding,\u201d Richard Whitfield of Pasco County, FL told CNN\u2019s Isabel Rosales Saturday. Whitfield and his partner, Jonathan Shade, left Tampa on Thursday and missed their connecting flight in Atlanta due to poor weather conditions, delaying their landing and forcing the plane to refuel in Tallahassee. After their rescheduled flight on Friday was delayed many times, the couple\u00a0decided to cancel the trip and just head home. But with no available flights back to Tampa, Friday night, they spent their second night in an airport hotel. They were unable to get a voucher from Delta for either of their stays. \u201c(Richard has) been on hold for 24 hours,\u201d Shade told CNN. \u201cWhen he eventually got his number in line, it was 2,001.\u201d Two hours later, Richard\u2019s place in Delta Air Lines\u2019 virtual customer service queue was 2,300 in line, Shade said. Delta Air Lines has reported the most cancellations, with\u00a0more than\u00a0850 Delta and Delta Connection flights unable to depart. \u201cIf we can\u2019t do the flight, we will try for the car and if we can\u2019t do the car, it\u2019s just another night in a hotel and we will see what happens,\u201d Shade said. At last check, a rental car back to Tampa would cost the pair $600, Shade and Whitfield said. Amtrak is charging $1,000 for a one-way ticket to Tampa, they added. Whitfield tells CNN the whole ordeal has had an impact on him. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s been the domino effect that it has on humanity and everything that we need to survive: food, sleep, or water, housing,\u201d he said. After spending 48 hours in Atlanta, they found a Saturday evening flight back to Tampa they say they can only hope is not delayed or canceled. For now, there is nothing the couple can do but wait and \u201cget a good stiff drink,\u201d Shade and Whitfield said. In addition to the problems at airports, the outage has also caused delays at hotels and rental car companies. Major hotels, including Marriott International and some Hiltons, were impacted both in regard to payment processing and delays to check in-processes. Even Americans not traveling felt the effects of the outage in various facets of their everyday lives, including while trying to call 911 during emergencies in some areas, getting or renewing their driver\u2019s licenses or shipping or receiving packages. There were reports of 911 outages in various states, like Alaska, and cities, like Phoenix, where the system was down for hours but has since been restored. Driver\u2019s license offices were closed or had limited services in Texas, Tennessee, North Carolina and Georgia. Some hospitals had to cancel appointments and surgeries While most hospitals remained open to treat medical emergencies, some said an inability to access electronic medical records and order lab tests and prescriptions had caused them to cancel patient appointments and surgeries. Hospital workers scrambled to provide needed care to patients without the technology they rely on. Kim Brown was near the end of her shift Thursday night as a labor and delivery nurse at Kaiser Permanente in San Jose, California, when the hospital\u2019s computer systems, which it relies on to care for women in labor and their babies, went down. \u201cAll of our babies get little plastic tags that will set off an alarm if they get too close to an exit or an elevator. That went down,\u201d Brown said. \u201cIt was unnerving because we had zero information. It was just, \u2018Oh, well, everything\u2019s out now.\u2019\u201d With the outage posing a security risk to newborn babies, the hospital called security guards to sit by the elevators to keep them safe. At the postpartum care unit in Dignity Health California Hospital Medical Center in Los Angeles, nurse Laura Topete said she ran into a roadblock trying to get analgesic drugs for a woman who was in pain after delivery, but couldn\u2019t access the doctor\u2019s orders to see what kind of medications she could have. \u201cThe patient was in pain longer than she needed to be,\u201d Topete said. Epic Systems, a company that makes widely used electronic health records systems for hospitals and doctors\u2019 offices, said on Friday its Nebula cloud-based platform had been impacted by the outage overnight and some services, including telehealth visits, were not available during the outage. Another electronic medical records company, Veradigm, also said its systems were impacted by the CrowdStrike outage. A spokesperson for the US Department of Health and Human Services said it was \u201cworking to assess the impact of the CrowdStrike outage on patient care and HHS systems, services, and operations,\u201d along with federal, state, local and private sector partners. In addition to hospitals, blood donation centers experienced challenges and altered blood shipment methods due to flight delays. New York Blood Center, which supplies about 200 hospitals in the Northeast, initiated an emergency driving operation to distribute collected blood. And Blood Assurance was concerned for its planned shipment of at least 20 platelets \u2014 the disc-shaped fragments that help with clotting \u2014 due to flight issues. Government agencies were at a standstill The impacts of the global tech outage were felt across the US as countless government agencies waited for services to get back to normal. The mayor of Portland, Oregon, issued an emergency declaration due to the ongoing outage. It affected the city\u2019s servers in city data centers, employee computers and single sign-on to cloud services, Mayor Ted Wheeler said in a news release. In Southern California, the disruption caused connectivity issues at the Los Angeles County Superior Court and it temporarily limited jail bookings in San Diego County, officials said. Elsewhere, some voting locations in Arizona experienced outages in Maricopa County as early voting continued in the state\u2019s primary, according to the Maricopa County Elections Department. The county is the fourth-most populous in the US and is home to Phoenix, the county website said. The Social Security Administration closed its local offices to the public on Friday after the outage shut down numerous services. The agency said in a statement it expected longer wait times for the national 800 phone number, and some online services may be unavailable.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/20/us/flights-canceled-delayed-global-it-outage/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/22/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_07_20_us_texas-houston-power-outage", "text": "Theodore Doyle, an 81-year-old retired manager with the former US Customs Service, was waking up in his hot and muggy northeast Houston apartment in a bed soaked in sweat. Doyle ultimately checked into a $98-a-night hotel room late Tuesday, after enduring a compounding crisis of extreme heat and no power for more than a week with about 200 other seniors at an independent living facility in the Kingwood community. \u201cThere\u2019s no air circulating. It\u2019s just stifling and it\u2019s sort of tough to breathe,\u201d he told CNN before returning to his apartment when power was restored Thursday afternoon. \u201cI just couldn\u2019t take it anymore.\u201d During the outage, a generator powered one elevator and a large, air-conditioned lounge at the complex \u2013 a lifeline for many who are dependent on electric wheelchairs and scooters to get around and oxygen machines for pulmonary disease. At times, as many as 40 residents sought refuge in the lounge. Others remained in their stifling apartments. Some stayed with relatives. \u201cA friend just turned 95 about a month ago,\u201d Doyle said. \u201cAnother friend of mine is over 90 and quite a few of us are all over 80. It\u2019s tough. You\u2019re not as spry as you used to be.\u201d By Sunday afternoon, about 1,200 customers of Houston\u2019s main utility, CenterPoint Energy, were without power, according to PowerOutage.us. It\u2019s unclear if those customers have been without power since Beryl hit the Golf Coast July 8 as a hurricane, leaving more than 2 million customers in the dark, mostly in the Houston area. More than 135,000 CenterPoint customers had no power on Monday night. The embattled utility said in a statement that customers without power were \u201cpredominantly isolated instances,\u201d where homes or equipment sustained severe damage from the storm. CenterPoint, which has 2.8 million customers in the Houston area, said some current outages could be related to thunderstorms Saturday morning. \u201cFor safety reasons, our crews pause their work when there is lightning,\u201d the statement said. At least 14 Houston-area deaths were confirmed to be hurricane-related, including seven people \u2013 ranging in age from 50 to 110 \u2013 who died from \u201cheat exposure due to power loss,\u201d according to the Harris County Institute of Forensic Sciences. Overall, more than 20 deaths in Harris and nearby counties were attributed to the storm, according to the Houston Chronicle and other local media outlets. Older people were especially vulnerable and, authorities warned, the number of fatalities could grow. For more than a week, some residents of the nation\u2019s fourth largest city were left to sleep in their cars, shuffle perilously with canes and walkers across dark rooms and corridors, and watch food and medications spoil and critical medical equipment become inoperable. At times, they cried in desperation after discovering the bodies of neighbors who succumbed to the heat following a comparatively mild Category 1 hurricane. \u201cIt is unimaginable this is happening in 2024,\u201d Denise Furlough, who delivered food, batteries and ice to her 86-year-old father during the more than a week without power in his Almeda Plaza home, told CNN Saturday. \u201cI was just frightened I might go over there and he wouldn\u2019t be alive.\u201d \u2018She didn\u2019t have to die\u2019 In Houston\u2019s Museum District on Tuesday, Pat Baker arrived at a condo complex to check on a neighbor with health problems who rented out her daughter\u2019s apartment. The neighbor didn\u2019t answer. \u201cI unlocked the door and found her,\u201d Baker, fighting back tears, told CNN affiliate KHOU. \u201cYou know, it\u2019s just been hot and miserable and I\u2019m just sick of this. I\u2019m just sick of it.\u201d Power was restored at the condo complex later that afternoon after the body was removed from the apartment, the station reported. The latest name on the Harris County list of confirmed Beryl-related deaths was Christine Davis, who had turned 110 in May, according to the 110 Club, a site about super-centenarians. She died Tuesday at Memorial Hermann Hospital Northeast from hyperthermia caused by \u201cenvironmental heat exposure due to power outage,\u201d according to the Harris County Institute of Forensic Sciences. Another confirmed storm victim was Pamela Jarrett, 64, who died of hyperthermia on July 11, days after the hurricane, in her home in Spring, Texas, just north of Houston. Relatives told CNN affiliate KTRK on Wednesday that Jarrett relied on a wheelchair and feeding tube. \u201cIt could have been avoided, and she didn\u2019t have to die,\u201d said her sister Janet, who took care of her and struggled to keep the feeding device charged during the outage. She said she tried to keep Jarrett cool with ice and water until she became unresponsive. \u201cAs much as I tried to save her,\u201d Janet Jarrett told the station, \u201cI couldn\u2019t save her.\u201d Power was restored in the Jarrett home on Tuesday. Utility pledges \u2018thorough review\u2019 In the city of Humble, about 20 miles north of Houston, Christina Bourgeois, her three children \u2013 ages 5 through 9 \u2013 and their dog Mimosa spent the night after the storm in her Dodge Journey outside their home. She kept the Dodge on, the air conditioner running because of the heat. \u201cI slept in the driver\u2019s seat,\u201d she told CNN Friday. \u201cIt was awful. You know, my younger son, I had to get up and take him inside to use the restroom.\u201d The children later stayed with relatives and Bourgeois, 32, spent every night in the car until power was restored on Wednesday. \u201cI would wake up every two or three hours or so to turn the air on and then turn it off,\u201d she said of the nights she spent alone in the Dodge.  \u201cI hadn\u2019t slept. I was exhausted. I was starting to swell. I had bags under my eyes. Any little noise would wake me up because I have the windows down, you know \u2026 Any kind of rustle of the leaves or, you know, even cars passing by, I would just wake up.\u201d Texas Gov. Greg Abbott last Sunday threatened executive action if CenterPoint Energy did not address concerns over the prolonged outage. And the Public Utilities Commission of Texas said it would investigate the company\u2019s response, according to Chairman Thomas Gleason. He told reporters Monday the utility\u2019s ability to maintain its infrastructure and its communication with customers has been called into question. CenterPoint Energy told CNN in a statement it was \u201ccommitted to doing a thorough review of our Hurricane Beryl response.\u201d \u201cWe are engaging with community leaders, elected officials, local clergy leadership and others across the area to learn about how we can be more responsive to their needs and concerns,\u201d the statement said. Doyle, before he returned to his apartment on Thursday, said he had about $150 worth of food on his refrigerator that went bad. He said he was unsure about the condition of some insulin he had left behind. He blamed the utility company for leaving thousands of Houstonians marooned in a broiling nightmare. \u201cYou have no idea how frustrating this is,\u201d he said. \u201cWe should not be subjected to this.\u201d Furlough, whose father, Julius Gordon, is a cancer survivor and has heart disease, said he \u2013 like many Houston residents \u2013 felt hopeless and abandoned until power to his home was restored on Tuesday. Her father told CNN, \u201cYou\u2019re just there. You just vegetate.\u201d CNN\u2019s Amy Simonson and Rebekah Riess contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/20/us/texas-houston-power-outage/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/22/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_07_18_us_keith-gavin-alabama-execution", "text": "Atmore, Alabama (AP) \u2014 A man convicted of fatally shooting a delivery driver during a robbery attempt in 1998 was executed Thursday evening in Alabama. Keith Edmund Gavin was pronounced dead at 6:32 p.m. CDT following a chemical injection at the William C. Holman Correctional Facility in southwest Alabama, authorities said. The 64-year-old inmate was convicted of capital murder in the shooting death of William Clayton Jr. in Cherokee County. Handling his own appeals, Gavin filed a handwritten request Wednesday with the US Supreme Court seeking a stay of execution. But the nation\u2019s high court rejected his request without comment less than an hour before the scheduled 6 p.m. CDT start of the procedure. The state attorney\u2019s general office had responded that the inmate\u2019s arguments that a circuit court had wrongly rejected an earlier appeal were without merit. Clayton, a courier service driver, had driven to an ATM in downtown Centre on the evening of March 6, 1998. He had just finished work and was getting money to take his wife to dinner, according to a court summary of trial testimony. Prosecutors said Gavin shot Clayton during the attempted robbery, pushed him into the passenger seat of the van he was driving and drove off in the vehicle. A law enforcement officer testified that he began pursuing the van and the driver \u2014 a man he later identified as Gavin \u2014 shot at him before running away into the woods. Clayton, 68, was retired from a job at a railroad company and was a Korean War veteran, according to a 1998 obituary published by The Birmingham News. At the time of the killing, Gavin was on parole in Illinois after serving 17 years of a 34-year sentence for murder, according to court records. \u201cThere is no doubt about Gavin\u2019s guilt or the seriousness of his crime,\u201d the Alabama attorney general\u2019s office had written in requesting an execution date for Gavin. Alabama last week agreed in Gavin\u2019s case to forgo a post-execution autopsy, which is typically performed on executed inmates in the state. Gavin, who was Muslim, said the procedure would\u00a0violate his religious beliefs.\u00a0Gavin had filed a lawsuit seeking to stop plans for an autopsy, and the state settled the complaint. A jury convicted Gavin of capital murder and voted 10-2 to recommend a death sentence, which a judge imposed. Most states now require a jury to be in unanimous agreement to impose a death sentence. A federal judge in 2020 ruled that Gavin had ineffective counsel at his sentencing hearing because his original lawyers failed to present more mitigating evidence of Gavin\u2019s violent and abusive childhood. Gavin grew up in a \u201cgang-infested housing project in Chicago, living in overcrowded houses that were in poor condition, where he was surrounded by drug activity, crime, violence, and riots,\u201d US District Judge Karon O. Bowdre wrote. A federal appeals court overturned the decision which allowed the death sentence to stand. Death penalty opponents had delivered a petition Wednesday to Gov. Kay Ivey appealing to her to grant clemency to Gavin. They argued that there were questions about the fairness of Gavin\u2019s trial and said Alabama was going against the \u201cdownward trend of executions\u201d in most states. It was the 10th execution in the US so far this year and the third in Alabama, according to the Death Penalty Information Center. Texas, Georgia, Oklahoma and Missouri also have conducted executions this year. The Washington, DC-based nonprofit takes no position on capital punishment but has criticized the way states carry out executions. The Supreme Court on Tuesday blocked the state of Texas from\u00a0executing\u00a0an inmate 20 minutes before he was scheduled to receive a lethal injection.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/18/us/keith-gavin-alabama-execution/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/22/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_07_21_tech_how-ai-helps-companies-set-prices", "text": "It\u2019s hard not to get fired up at how much more everything costs compared to just a few years ago. But people making the same exact purchases as you aren\u2019t necessarily paying the same exact prices as you. This became apparent to me a few weeks ago when a friend texted me that Starbucks was running a buy one, get one free drink promotion. But when I logged in to the app, the offer was nowhere to be found. Why was my friend getting special treatment? It\u2019s likely that Starbucks used artificial intelligence to determine that my friend, if offered a promotion, would make a purchase they wouldn\u2019t otherwise have, whereas I would make a purchase regardless, said Shikha Jain, a lead partner in the North American consumer and retail division at the consultancy firm Simon-Kucher. The system nailed it for me \u2014 just opening the app to check if I had the promo got me to order, and I paid full price. It\u2019s impossible to say exactly how Starbucks\u2019 systems made that correct judgment about me \u2014 though my past shopping behavior and the shopping behavior of similar customers were almost certainly factors, she said. The Seatle-based coffee chain declined to share what feeds into its AI model, dubbed Deep Brew. A spokesperson did, however, confirm that AI is powering the individualized offers it sends customers. This personalized pricing strategy is not unique to Starbucks. Companies are increasingly leveraging customer data, often derived from loyalty programs, in coordination with machine-learning models to uniquely price goods and services based on an individual\u2019s willingness to pay. The end goal: \u201cGet you to buy more items, buy the same items again or to spend more on the same items,\u201d said Jain. Traditional marketing tactics on steroids Companies are still employing tried and true marketing 101 tactics, like segmenting customers who exhibit similar purchasing behavior and preferences and taking into account, for instance, a shopper\u2019s location and the time of year. Companies have used this kind of information to effectively offer different prices to different groups of consumers. But in the past, they had to cast a pretty wide net to do so, said Jim Presley, senior vice president of US consumer analytics at NielsenIQ, a consumer insights company. That might have involved mailing coupons to homes located in a specific neighborhood or tailoring deals to people who click certain kinds of ads or read certain online publications. Companies have for years tried to target customers by distilling statistics into actual preferences. What\u2019s changed now with the advancements in AI is the level of sophistication and accuracy with which these types of predictions can be made, said Presley. Using AI, companies can now answer questions like, \u201cWhat is this person going to buy next? What do we think they\u2019re going to be willing to pay? Where are they going to buy from? When are they going to buy it?\u201d said Jain. Matt Pavich, senior director of strategy and innovation at Revionics, an AI company that specializes in helping retailers set prices, said its goal is not to tell retailers exactly how much to charge individual customers. Rather, its bread and butter is providing companies with \u201call of the analytics and predictive scenarios\u201d to figure out prices themselves. Instead of waiting for customers to respond in real time to price changes, Revionics\u2019 clients get a toolbox to test out prices in advance. Then, by predicting how much consumers will buy at different price points, Revionics helps retailers manage their inventories. The personalization even extends beyond prices to targeting customers. So, for instance, a notification you receive informing you of a sale may be worded completely differently from a notification another customer receives of the same sale. Mary Winn Pilkington, senior vice president of investor relations and public relations at Tractor Supply Co., told CNN it recently partnered with Revionics because it wanted to more successfully adjust prices to \u201cthe ever-changing market\u201d to \u201cattract and retain customers.\u201d The aim of partnering with Revionics wasn\u2019t to see how high they can raise their prices without turning away too many customers, she said. Instead, it\u2019s \u201cto curate specific offers individualized for customers.\u201d This, she said, \u201coften leads to lower prices and better value on the products and services our customers need.\u201d Of course, like in the case of my Starbucks experience, it could also very well lead to identifying customers who don\u2019t require promotions at all.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/21/tech/how-ai-helps-companies-set-prices/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/22/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_07_18_us_samantha-woll-case-update", "text": "Jurors returned mixed verdicts Thursday in the trial of a man accused of killing Detroit synagogue president Samantha Woll at her home. Michael Jackson-Bolanos, 29, faced four charges. Jurors deadlocked on the charges of felony murder and home invasion. They found him not guilty of premeditated murder but found him guilty of lying to a police officer. A pretrial hearing on the two deadlocked counts has been scheduled for noon on July 25. Prosecutors could decide to not retry the case but did not immediately comment after the jury\u2019s findings Thursday. The trial, which lasted over a month, was complicated by the replacement of a juror this week. It also included stunning testimony from Woll\u2019s ex-boyfriend Jeffrey Herbstman, who initially told police he \u201cmay have murdered my girlfriend\u201d \u2013 but later testified he had nothing to do with Woll\u2019s death. Defense attorney Brian Brown said his client was frustrated with the verdict. \u201cWe feel that the jury should have come back with a not guilty on the felony murder and also the home invasion first degree. They got it right on the premeditated murder,\u201d Brown said. \u201cMy guy is innocent. You know, there\u2019s no point of going through this all over again.\u201d Brown said there \u201cwas zero evidence that would have put my client inside the home. He never went inside.\u201d The attorney said he was \u201cstill scratching my head\u201d on the deadlocked home invasion count. Wayne County Prosecutor Kym Worthy, in a statement, thanked the jury for its dedication and said her office had been \u201chopeful that a decision could be reached today.\u201d Worthy added, \u201cWe will press on for justice for the Wolls and will determine our next course of action at the pre-trial hearing.\u201d What we know about the attack Woll was the 40-year-old board president of the Isaac Agree Downtown Synagogue in Detroit. The night before her body was found, Woll attended a wedding and appeared normal, police said. She returned home shortly after midnight, and there were no signs of forced entry at her home. A prosecutor told jurors that Woll left her door open, which led to a tragic encounter. In the early morning hours of October 21, 2023, Woll\u2019s body was found fatally stabbed outside her home. Authorities believe she stumbled outside after she was attacked. A medical examiner determined Woll died from \u201cmultiple sharp force wounds with a straight-edge cutting instrument,\u201d Worthy\u2019s office said in a news release. Authorities have said they believe Jackson-Bolanos did not know Woll, and the Wayne County prosecutor has said there was no evidence suggesting the killing was a hate crime. But blood evidence indicated Jackson-Bolanos was the killer, Wayne County Assistant Prosecuting Attorney Ryan Elsey said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t catch him until close to six weeks after her death. But when they did, he still had her blood on a jacket that he wore that night and on a backpack that he wore that night,\u201d Elsey told jurors.\u00a0 Prosecutors accused Jackson-Bolanos of entering Woll\u2019s home and stabbing her multiple times. He also \u201clied to the police by making statements he knew were false and misleading relating to the investigation of the case,\u201d prosecutors said in December. When Jackson-Bolanos was interrogated by Detroit police last year, he insisted he did not know Woll or have any involvement in her death. \u201cI don\u2019t know this woman. I don\u2019t know anything about this woman except when it popped up on the news, bro. That\u2019s it,\u201d Jackson-Bolanos said, according to CNN affiliate WDIV. \u201cThe only thing I know that I was in the wrong place at the wrong time.\u201d In his opening statement, Brown said clues at the scene indicate his client did not kill Woll during a home invasion. \u201cYes, Samantha Woll tragically died on October 21st. However, it was not Michael Jackson-Bolanos who did this. She was stabbed eight times in the neck, in the back of the head, in the back of the neck. To me, that would indicate a crime of passion. This wasn\u2019t just some random person walking into her house, trying to steal anything,\u201d Brown told jurors. \u201cNothing of value was taken from her house. She had valuables. Her purse was in plain view. Credit cards, cell phone, laptops \u2013 plain view,\u201d Brown said. \u201cIf anybody came into this particular house to steal something and to stab her eight times, surely they would have taken something of value.\u201d Ex-boyfriend explains why he once believed he \u2018was responsible for her death\u2019 The case took a bizarre turn when Woll\u2019s ex-boyfriend Herbstman, who previously told police he may have killed Woll but did not remember, took the stand. Herbstman said he dated Woll from August 2022 to July 2023, when the pair broke up amicably. The ex-boyfriend, who said he was diagnosed with depression at least a decade ago, became despondent after learning about Woll\u2019s death last October. \u201cI was devastated \u2026 There were days that I couldn\u2019t get out of bed,\u201d Herbstman testified. Around October, he wasn\u2019t getting relief from one of his usual medications for depression, \u201cso my psychiatrist recommended that I try a new medication\u201d \u2013 starting with a small dose and gradually scaling it up, Herbstman testified. On November 7, Herbstman was on a work trip in Kalamazoo \u2013 about 140 miles west of Detroit \u2013 when he suffered a panic attack in his car. He said he had recently increased the dosage of his new antidepressant and had also smoked cannabis. \u201cMy thoughts began racing \u2026 I couldn\u2019t stop worrying about things,\u201d Herbstman testified. \u201cI began to believe that I was responsible for her death \u2013 that I had somehow killed her and didn\u2019t remember doing it,\u201d Herbstman said. \u201cAnd I couldn\u2019t shake that feeling. And it was disturbing to the extreme.\u201d He called 911, and an officer arrived with her body-worn camera on. In the footage, which was played in court, Herbstman told police: \u201cI\u2019m having a panic attack. \u2026 I may have murdered my girlfriend, and I don\u2019t remember it.\u201d During his testimony last month, Herbstman said he had nothing to do with Woll\u2019s death. He said he stopped taking the new medication immediately after the panic attack and had not had a similar episode since. The ex-boyfriend was eventually cleared as a suspect. Elsey told jurors that \u201cpolice did not find any evidence placing\u201d Herbstman at the scene or any evidence that he left his home that night. The prosecution said Herbstman was granted \u201cuse immunity\u201d during the trial. \u201cThat means that for this time that you\u2019re sitting in this witness chair that anything you say can\u2019t be used against you in a subsequent criminal proceeding,\u201d Elsey told Herbstman. Why the jury had to restart deliberations The trial, which began in early June, lasted longer than initially anticipated. Van Houten said jurors had been asked to be available through July 3, but deliberations did not begin until July 9. Jurors had to restart deliberations Tuesday after one juror had to leave for a pre-scheduled vacation, CNN affiliate WDIV reported. That juror was replaced with an alternate juror, and the original juror\u2019s comments and opinions about the evidence had to be tossed out as deliberations restarted from scratch.

{"id": "2024_07_21_politics_biden-harris-questions-democratic-nominee-who-is-president", "text": "President Joe Biden on Sunday announced he will not seek to be reelected as president in 2024, and he endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris to become the Democratic nominee. But the 81-year-old\u2019s decision \u2014 with just over 100 days until the election \u2014 has given rise to many more questions about what comes next for the rest of his presidency and for the presidential race. Is Biden still the president? Yes. Biden\u2019s announcement exclusively pertained to his role as the Democratic candidate in November\u2019s presidential election. It has no bearing on his current role or term as president, which he said he intends to serve out in its entirety. Biden will remain president until his successor is sworn in on January 20, 2025. In announcing his decision, Biden wrote, \u201cWhile it has been my intention to seek reelection, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and to focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President for the remainder of my term.\u201d Despite Biden\u2019s statement, some Republicans are urging him to resign effective immediately. Notable lawmakers questioning Biden\u2019s ability to serve as president and calling for his resignation include House Speaker Mike Johnson, House GOP Conference Chair Elise Stefanik and the chair of the Senate GOP campaign arm, Montana Sen. Steve Daines. But, again, there is no indication as of Sunday evening that Biden has any intention of stepping down early. Biden endorsed Harris. Does that make her the Democratic nominee? No. Following his announcement, Biden endorsed Harris, his vice president, to be the Democratic presidential nominee. Harris said in a statement that she was \u201chonored\u201d to receive Biden\u2019s endorsement and intends to \u201cearn and win\u201d the nomination for president in her first public statement since Biden\u2019s stunning announcement. A number of prominent Democrats quickly threw their support behind Harris, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who ran for president in 2020; top House progressive Rep. Pramila Jayapal of Washington and Delaware Sen. Chris Coons, a Biden campaign co-chair. North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper and Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro also endorsed Harris, as did the entire Tennessee delegation to the DNC. But none of this automatically makes her the nominee. How will the Democratic nominee be chosen and who will it be?\u00a0 CNN\u2019s Zachary Wolf and Ethan Cohen have laid out how the complex process to replace Biden will likely play out now that Biden is no longer the Democrat\u2019s presumptive nominee. Individual delegates will now select the party\u2019s nominee during the Democratic convention in Chicago next month \u2014 or, potentially, during a virtual roll call. But because Biden won nearly all of the delegates during the primary process; they were approved by the Biden campaign and pledged to vote for the president. This means that while the delegates can vote however they like, it will largely be Biden backers who will be picking the nominee. That doesn\u2019t mean that a candidate who isn\u2019t endorsed by Biden couldn\u2019t attempt to secure the nomination. Some Democrats are calling for an \u201copen process\u201d to replace Biden, which would see other candidates in addition to Harris join the race. Under party rules, candidates must meet certain requirements to be nominated, including gathering hundreds of signatures from delegates from several states; being a \u201cbona fide Democrat\u201d; and having \u201cestablished substantial support for their nomination as the Democratic candidate.\u201d While this determination is to be made by the DNC national chairperson, the party has not yet released more details on how exactly the process would work. Who else could be the new nominee if not Harris?\u00a0 While Harris received Biden\u2019s endorsement, the names of many prominent Democratic lawmakers have been unofficially floated as alternatives who could go against her for the party\u2019s nomination. Most of those individuals, however, have not announced or otherwise signaled that they intend to vie for the role. On Sunday night, however, sources close to Sen. Joe Manchin, independent of West Virginia, told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper that Manchin is considering re-registering as a Democrat and throwing his hat into the ring. Manchin had called for Biden to bow out of the race Sunday morning on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d How will the new presidential nominee\u2019s running mate be chosen? The Democratic Party elects a vice presidential candidate in largely the same manner as the vote for president, although there\u2019s typically not a full vote. In practice, whoever the presidential nominee chooses as their running mate is typically accepted by the delegates. What happens to the money raised for Biden\u2019s reelection? Biden\u2019s reelection efforts had raised a total of $240 million at the end of June. Those funds are split across the DNC, allied committees and Biden\u2019s campaign committee itself. The latter alone holds $95.9 million as of the end of last month, Federal Election Commission data shows. Many campaign finance experts say that, should Harris become the nominee, any money remaining campaign\u2019s bank accounts would transfer to her political operation because she already is part of the ticket. But some Republican lawyers disagree, arguing that under some interpretations, Biden and Harris must be formally nominated by their party before any money could be shifted. \u201cIf President Biden is committed to passing the torch to his vice president, and wants to be able to seed her campaign with the current Biden for President campaign war chest, he\u2019ll first have to become his party\u2019s legal nominee,\u201d veteran Republican election lawyer Charlie Spies wrote in an op-ed\u00a0in The Wall Street Journal earlier this month. If Harris does not become the nominee, the Biden-Harris campaign could transfer the entire pot to the Democratic National Committee, according to the FEC. The committee would then be empowered to financially support another prominent Democratic nominee, and distribute the cash to candidates further down the ticket along with their allied committees. The DNC would encounter FEC limitations on spending and contributions, should it choose this route. Another option the campaign has is to transform into a political action committee, spending Biden\u2019s funds on independent expenditures such as advertising campaigns for a new presidential candidate. But it would not be allowed to coordinate those spending activities with any of the candidates it supports. Has this ever happened before? While no US president has been pressured out of a reelection campaign due to concerns over his mental fitness, it is not unprecedented for an incumbent president to abandon his reelection campaign \u2014 but it is rare. This is the first time a one-term US president has dropped out of a reelection run in decades. It recalls former Presidents Lyndon B. Johnson and Harry S. Truman\u2019s decisions not to seek full second terms in 1968 and 1952, respectively. Biden\u2019s decision notably comes months closer to Election Day, and it is the latest such decision in history. At least five other former presidents have also rejected the possibility of a second full term. CNN\u2019s David Wright, Zachary B. Wolf, Ethan Cohen, Fredreka Schouten and Alex Leeds Matthews contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/21/politics/biden-harris-questions-democratic-nominee-who-is-president/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/22/2024", "section": "us"}}

In a post on the social platform X, the former US senator from Nebraska said that \u201cafter extensive prayer and lots of family tears,\u201d he asked university officials that day to start looking for a new president. In a statement, the university said his resignation is effective July 31. \u201cI need to step back for a time and focus more on the needs of my family while we rebuild more stable household systems,\u201d Sasse said, adding that he would continue to teach at the university.

The couple has two daughters in college, and their youngest child is turning 13, he said. Sasse, a Republican, left the senate last year after being\u00a0named the 13th president of the university. While in the Senate, he was a\u00a0prominent critic of former President Donald Trump\u00a0who joined with a handful of other Republicans to vote in favor of conviction his impeachment trial after the 2021 Capitol riot. That led to criticism from within Sasse\u2019s own party even though he voted with Trump 85% of the time and helped get his three Supreme Court nominees confirmed. The chair of the university\u2019s board of trustees, Mori Hosseini, thanked Sasse for his leadership. \u201cHe has left a lasting impact on the university and all of those associated with it.
