{"id": "2024_06_11_us_dog-saves-stranded-owner-oregon", "text": "When Troy Millhollin saw his friend Brandon Garrett\u2019s dog Blue come into their\u00a0camp alone with scratches on his nose, he had a feeling something was wrong. \u201cWhen (Blue) showed up without his sister, Nova, I was like, \u2018That\u2019s not normal,\u2019\u201d Millhollin told CNN. Millhollin, 46, and Garrett, 60, had been driving in separate vehicles from Halfway, Oregon, to a camp in the woods the afternoon of June 2. Every summer, the two set up camp there for a couple of days to cut firewood. Garrett should have been right behind him that day, Millhollin said, but his friend never arrived. While waiting, he realized the scratches on Blue\u2019s nose were actually cuts, and decided to drive back to town to find his friend. In town, no one had seen or heard from Garrett, Millhollin said. He reached out to other friends in the area who started searching. By morning, Garrett still hadn\u2019t shown up. Millhollin then called Garrett\u2019s brother, Tyree Garrett,\u00a0who also started searching with a friend. Having grown up in the area, Tyree Garrett remembered there were two places on the creek not visible from the road where a vehicle could have tumbled into. At the first location he checked on US Forest Service Road 39, he found the pickup truck his brother was driving. But it wasn\u2019t a reassuring sight. \u201cI could see the injured dogs laying down there and I kept yelling for\u00a0my brother,\u201d the younger Garrett said. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t answer.\u201d There was no cell service at the site of the crash, so he had to leave to call for help. \u201cI thought for sure when I was making the 911 call that I was calling just for a body recovery,\u201d Tyree Garrett told CNN. \u201cSo I was pretty heartbroken at the\u00a0time.\u201d Later, the family would realize Blue had traveled approximately 4 miles from where he and his owner had crashed to find and alert Millhollin. \u2018I was hoping just to survive\u2019 Meanwhile, Brandon Garrett had spent the night in the ravine, hoping help would arrive. The accident had happened when he started to fall asleep while driving, Garrett told CNN: \u201cI thought I\u2019d make camp and I didn\u2019t. I\u2019d come to taking a bad line on the corner and lost the whole thing and it beat me up pretty good.\u201d Garrett said he was thrown through the windshield downhill as the truck swerved into the ravine. The truck flipped right next to him.\u00a0Unable to move much, he leaned against the truck and lost consciousness. When Garrett came to, it was raining heavily and he was waist deep into the creek, so he crawled back in for some shelter. \u201cI knew it was going to be touch and go to make it to dawn,\u201d he said.  He didn\u2019t see Blue, but he had his three other dogs to keep him company \u2013 but they, too, were injured. \u201cI was hoping just to survive because it didn\u2019t really look like it at that point. I was in a spot where I couldn\u2019t be seen from the road,\u201d Garrett said. Just before 9:30 a.m. on June 3, the\u00a0Baker County Sheriff\u2019s Office dispatch received Tyree Garrett\u2019s report of the crash, according to a\u00a0news release.\u00a0Law enforcement and Baker County Search and Rescue responded to the scene. When he arrived, Sheriff Travis Ash saw Brandon Garrett\u2019s vehicle tilted on its side in the steep ravine, the release stated. Ash heard Garrett shouting and found him 100 yards from the vehicle with the three other dogs. Ash provided first aid as the county rescue ropes team prepared to get Garrett. They eventually secured him in a rescue basket, connected it to a highline rope system and pulled him across the ravine. Garrett was later airlifted to a regional hospital, the sheriff\u2019s office said. Garrett told CNN he sustained a hairline fracture in his foot and some lacerations. He is recovering at home. Garrett also said he was driving\u00a0Millhollin\u2019s truck the day of the accident, and now hopes to raise money to replace it for his friend. But Millhollin insists that he rest. \u201cI\u2019m not worried about the truck. As long as they all were okay. That\u2019s what mattered,\u201d Millhollin said. Three of Garrett\u2019s dogs \u2013 including Blue \u2013 are with him as he recovers, but one still isn\u2019t back from the veterinarian. It was no surprise to those who know Blue \u2013 who is part Pitbull, Australian Shepherd and Whippet, among other breeds \u2013 that he knew where to go after the accident. Garrett said he often spends time with the dogs in those woods, and Blue in particular knows the area so well that he can find Garrett in the woods, find his way home or navigate to Millhollin\u2019s house. \u201cI\u2019ve been around dogs my whole life,\u201d Tyree Garrett said. \u201cThey\u2019ve got a great sense of direction and they\u2019re just really savvy creatures.\u201d Brandon Garrett described his companions as simply, \u201cmy best friends.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/11/us/dog-saves-stranded-owner-oregon/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/12/2024", "section": "us"}}

Chestnut won the \u201cMustard Yellow Belt\u201d 16 times, ate a world record 76 hot dogs and buns in 10 minutes in 2021 and has reportedly made hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of dollars for his competitive eating of hot dogs and other foods.  MLE co-founder George Shea said the company tried to accommodate Chestnut and his management team, which included allowing him to compete in a rival unbranded hot dog eating contest on Labor Day. \u201cIt\u2019s a long-standing rule not to represent a rival brand,\u201d Shea said. \u201cMichael Jordan can\u2019t go to Adidas and say that Air Jordans are great.\u201d The MLE has also emphasized that Chestnut was not banned for life from competing, citing his 20-year relationship with the league. The organization said that to come back Chestnut must renounce deals with brands that rival Nathan\u2019s. \u201cJoey Chestnut is an American hero. We would love nothing more than to have him at Nathan\u2019s Famous International Hot Dog Eating Contest, which he has dominated for years. We hope that he returns when he is not representing a rival brand,\u201d the MLE said in a statement. An account under Chestnut\u2019s name wrote on X Tuesday that he does \u201cnot have a contract with MLE or Nathans and they are looking to change the rules from past years as it relates to other partners I can work with.\u201d CNN has not independently confirmed the authenticity of the X account. This is not the first instance of Nathan\u2019s beefing with their winners. Chestnut\u2019s rival and former reigning champion Takeru Kobayashi did not compete in the 2010 contest, reportedly due to disputes with the company over getting him to sign an exclusive contract. An Impossible Foods spokesperson said, \u201cWe love Joey and support him in any contest he chooses. It\u2019s OK to experiment with a new dog. Meat eaters shouldn\u2019t have to be exclusive to just one wiener.\u201d Joey Chestnut, Nathan\u2019s and its parent company, Smithfield Foods, did not reply to requests for comment.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/11/business/nathans-hot-dog-joey-chestnut-banned-impossible/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/12/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_11_politics_coast-guard-leader-testifies-congress-invs", "text": "Senators blasted the head of the US Coast Guard at a contentious hearing on Tuesday, saying she has fostered a \u201cculture of concealment,\u201d withheld critical information from congressional investigators and failed to hold leaders and perpetrators accountable for serious misconduct. \u201cOur investigation has shown a deep moral rot within the Coast Guard now,\u201d said Sen. Richard Blumenthal, chair of the Homeland Security Committee\u2019s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, which has been looking into the Coast Guard\u2019s past mishandling of sexual assault cases. \u201cOne that prioritizes cronyism over accountability, silence over survivors.\u201d Blumenthal and other lawmakers from the subcommittee told Commandant Adm. Linda Fagan that their investigation has found that sexual assault remains a \u201cpersistent and unacceptably prevalent\u201d issue across the service, despite her initial assurances that it was a problem of the past. Nearly 40 whistleblowers have come forward to the subcommittee in recent months, lawmakers said. At the hearing, Fagan was questioned about what specific steps she was taking to ensure those who commit serious misconduct, as well as those who cover up their crimes, are removed from the service. \u201cAre you aware that there are more survivors who leave the Coast Guard than perpetrators?\u201d asked Blumenthal, a Democrat from Connecticut, where the Coast Guard Academy is based. \u201cThis problem is not one of the past. It is real and present \u2026 and the evidence is not in my voice, it is the voices and faces of the whistleblowers \u2026 they are in my view heroes in this story.\u201d The hearing was sparked by CNN\u2019s reporting on the results of a secret investigation \u2014 dubbed Operation Fouled Anchor, which was quietly closed and hidden from Congress and the public despite substantiating dozens of sexual assaults that had previously been mishandled at the Coast Guard\u2019s prestigious academy. At a previous hearing led by the same subcommittee, four sexual assault victims testified about how they were silenced, retaliated against and left battling severe mental trauma while alleged perpetrators continued to thrive within the service. \u201cWe are taking action, the work is not done \u2026 we have not waited,\u201d Fagan said, repeatedly pledging to change the culture but saying she needs more time and resources to do so. \u201cI want to stop creating victims, but for the victims that we do have in the organization, I am 100% committed to fully supporting them and their needs.\u201d Fagan had previously said she only learned of the \u201ctotality\u201d of the so-called Fouled Anchor probe when CNN inquired about the issue, though she had heard of it because she had previously taken steps to remove a commanding officer caught up in the investigation. When pressed by senators Tuesday on how much she had known about the investigation prior to becoming commandant in 2021, she acknowledged that she had \u201cformally\u201d learned about it when the agency\u2019s leadership council was briefed in 2018,and she said that \u201cwhen we closed it out in 2020, there was conversation around whether to disclose or not.\u201d Fagan refused to say whether she believed her predecessor, Admiral Karl Schultz, was behind the ultimate decision to keep the findings of Fouled Anchor from Congress after the probe concluded. She said she did not have \u201cany direct evidence of misconduct\u201d surrounding this decision, even though minutes earlier senators had displayed a giant poster of a handwritten list made by Schultz\u2019s second in command with \u201cpros\u201d and \u201ccons\u201d about whether to be transparent with lawmakers and the public about the probe. Schultz previously declined to comment to CNN about Fouled Anchor. The hearing Tuesday came as Fagan was already facing immense pressure, as new controversies and increased congressional scrutiny have shined a light on how sexual assault is continuing to plague the agency. This includes explosive allegations from the academy\u2019s longtime head of sexual assault prevention, Shannon Norenberg, who recently announced her resignation and said top leaders had directed her to lie to sexual assault victims and Congress, making her an unwitting accomplice in the Fouled Anchor coverup. Several lawmakers seized on Norenberg\u2019s allegations, specifically that she had been barred from providing survivors with key paperwork that would help them access veteran\u2019s benefits available to sexual assault survivors. Fagan said she couldn\u2019t speak about specifics of that allegation, as well as other issues raised by the senators, because of an open Inspector General investigation. That prompted Blumenthal to criticize her for using the investigation as a shield, eliciting applause from the audience. \u201cYou\u2019re the leader, these decisions are yours,\u201d said Blumenthal. Fagan said she hadn\u2019t actually read Norenberg\u2019s full statement, just the CNN article about it. Senators also focused on an email alleging a recent assault coverup that went viral after being deleted from Coast Guard servers and a leaked internal memo showing that Coast Guard officials recently worried that publishing testimonials from assault survivors \u201ccould continue to exacerbate the narrative \u2026 that the Coast Guard is in a sexual assault crisis now.\u201d Sen. Maggie Hassan, a Democrat from New Hampshire, argued that the \u201creluctance\u201d to release the videos \u201cindicates a real failure of leadership\u201d and lack of understanding of the agency\u2019s current sexual assault problem. Throughout the hearing, lawmakers pressed Fagan on what they described as a lack of transparency and cooperation with their investigation. \u201cThe only way you can change the culture, the only way this can be fixed \u2026 is with truth, transparency and accountability,\u201d said Sen. Ron Johnson, a Republican from Wisconsin and Ranking Member of the subcommittee, adding that he thinks subpoenas will be necessary. Johnson flipped through page after page of records produced by the Coast Guard that were almost entirely redacted. A group of bipartisan lawmakers from the House Oversight committee, who were not part of the hearing but have their own investigation underway into the agency\u2019s handling of a variety of misconduct, including sexual assault, racism and hazing, joined the voices of criticism. They sent a letter to Fagan on Tuesday saying that the Coast Guard has provided fewer than 1% of records identified as potentially responsive to the requests to date. They also said they have heard from whistleblowers who \u201crevealed additional cultural deficiencies and alleged incompetence and misconduct by current and former leaders,\u201d who whistleblowers say may have \u201cwillfully concealed evidence relevant to criminal investigations\u201d and \u201cmisrepresented material facts to Coast Guard Investigative Service (CGIS) investigators to conceal the depth of the culture of misconduct and the identities of other potential suspects.\u201d At Tuesday\u2019s hearing, Fagan said the Coast Guard has been fully cooperating with the subcommittee\u2019s investigation. But senators said it appeared that the records it deemed \u201csensitive\u201d and refused to provide were more likely withheld because of fear of further public embarrassment. \u201cWhat\u2019s required of the Coast Guard at this moment is an unsparing commitment to truth-telling, following the facts and the evidence wherever they lead, even if they are embarrassing to former members of the Coast Guard or present members,\u201d said Blumenthal.

And Sunday night, a drive-by shooting left two injured, with one person still hospitalized in critical condition, Barnes told reporters Monday. Police don\u2019t currently believe the shootings were connected, Barnes added, \u201cWe\u2019re looking at that as an angle, however we have no information to suggest that at this time.\u201d \u201cGuns are not a solution to conflict, and we must stop normalizing their use and their accessibility,\u201d Mayor Satya Rhodes-Conway said at the news conference Monday. \u201cThe families impacted by these events will never be the same.\u201d Friday\u2019s shooting ended a five-week streak of no reports of shots fired in Madison, officials said. Rhodes-Conway called on state lawmakers to enact gun safety measures. Police have yet to identify a suspect or make arrests in the rooftop shooting and are asking the public for information or videos of the event. \u201cAt this time, we will not be publicly identifying the suspect or a person of interest, as we do not want to jeopardize any leads in this case,\u201d Barnes said. In the rooftop shooting, 10 people suffered gunshot wounds or grazes, one person was hurt by broken glass and another sustained a shoulder injury, according to police. Emergency personnel responded around 1 a.m. Sunday to what police now believe was a \u201csneak bash,\u201d or an unauthorized party in a private setting, Barnes said Monday. Police found one teen who suffered multiple gunshot wounds bleeding in the street, and rushed into the apartment building on Johnson Street, Barnes said. \u201cOfficers watched as dozens of people rushed out of the building, running in panic and tripping over one another, simply trying to find safety,\u201d he said. After running up 12 flights of stairs to reach those at the party, police said they found a chaotic scene. Police believe there were at least 25 people on the rooftop, Barnes said Monday. Authorities initially estimated there were several hundred people on the scene. Victims range in age from 14 to 23, with some victims still in high school, authorities said. Police are looking at \u201cdigital evidence\u201d and are still working to determine who organized the party, Barnes said. The Madison Fire Department took five people with gunshot wounds to the hospital by ambulance, while other victims reported to the hospital on their own. Four ambulances and two engine companies helped triage, treat and transport patients at the scene, the department said in a statement. Earlier this year, the Madison police and fire departments teamed up to train for how to respond to a situation like this one, Barnes previously said, \u201chowever, we didn\u2019t expect to put it into practice so soon.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/09/us/madison-wisconsin-shooting-multiple-injuries/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/12/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_10_us_us-violent-crime-rates-statistics", "text": "Violent\u00a0crime\u00a0dropped by more than 15% in the United States during the first three months of 2024, according to statistics released Monday by the FBI. The new numbers show violent\u00a0crime\u00a0from January to March dropped 15.2% compared to the same period in 2023, while murders fell 26.4% and reported rapes decreased by 25.7%. Aggravated assaults decreased during that period when compared to last year by 12.5%, according to the data, while robberies fell 17.8%. The numbers released Monday were gathered from 13,719 of the just over 19,000 law enforcement agencies from across the country, according to the bureau. Meanwhile, property\u00a0crime\u00a0went down 15.1% in the first three months of this year. Burglaries dropped 16.7%, while motor vehicle theft decreased by 17.3%. The declines in violent and property\u00a0crimes were seen in every region of the US. In a statement Monday, Attorney General Merrick Garland stressed the new data \u201cmakes clear that last year\u2019s historic decline in violent\u00a0crime\u00a0is continuing.\u201d \u201cThis continued historic decline in homicides does not represent abstract statistics. It represents people whose lives were saved \u2014 people who are still here to see their children grow up, to work toward fulfilling their dreams, and to contribute to their communities,\u201d Garland said. US murder rate plunges The new FBI figures validate a trend identified by some national\u00a0crime\u00a0experts: The US murder rate continues to drop at a high rate and could be headed for its largest annual decline ever. Compared to the first five months of 2023, murders this year have dropped more than 40% in cities including New Orleans, Seattle, Boston, Baltimore, and Philadelphia, according to the research firm AH Datalytics, which analyzes\u00a0crime\u00a0figures reported by law enforcement agencies across the nation. Although more than six months still remain in 2024, \u201cit\u2019s plausible that this will be, by far, the largest one-year decline in American history,\u201d said Jeff Asher, criminal justice analyst and co-founder of consulting firm AH Datalytics. The firm\u2019s real-time review of 265 cities currently shows a 19% drop in murders nationwide compared to 2023. Data limitations The preliminary figures in the FBI\u2019s Quarterly Uniform\u00a0Crime\u00a0Report do come with important limitations. For one, the bureau relies upon data voluntarily submitted by policing agencies. Crime\u00a0analysts also say quarterly data are imprecise, as law enforcement agencies have the remainder of the year to audit and correct any reporting errors before final annual figures are published by the FBI. \u201cWe have other data sources that point to the same trends, but the degree of those declines is probably being overstated due to the methodology being employed by the FBI,\u201d said Asher. \u2018Interrupting cycles of violence\u2019 The US murder rate has declined since 2020, when the Covid-19 pandemic brought with it a surge in homicides across the country. FBI figures showed the number of homicides increased nearly 30% from 2019 to 2020 \u2013 the largest single-year increase the agency had recorded since it began tracking these\u00a0crimes in the 1960s \u2013 and violent\u00a0crime\u00a0during the same period increased by 5%. Criminal justice experts say\u00a0crime\u00a0trends are complex, but generally blame the cause in the 2020 surge on vast societal disruptions, including the closure of schools, businesses, childcare and community programs. Others pointed to more stress and more guns along with less policing, less public trust and disruption of social support services. \u201cThese are some of the tools that we would expect to have an effect on reversing or interrupting cycles of violence,\u201d said Asher. \u201cIn a normal year these tools would have been available to us in 2020 or 2021, but they weren\u2019t. It\u2019s only now, several years later, that we\u2019re starting to see the level of gun violence, the level of murder fall back to where it was pre-pandemic.\u201d CNN\u2019s Eric Levenson and Mark Morales contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/10/us/us-violent-crime-rates-statistics/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/12/2024", "section": "us"}}

The chaotic December 5, 2019, gun battle sent a spray of bullets across a crowded South Florida intersection as at least 18 officers from three jurisdictions pursued a pair of jewelry heist suspects who had hijacked the UPS truck and led authorities on a lengthy vehicle chase. \u201cWe\u2019re extremely disappointed that after almost five years, these officers are finding themselves indicted for something they had seconds to decide,\u201d\u00a0South Florida Police Benevolent Association president Steadman Stahl said. The names of the officers expected to be indicted and the specific charges they face were not released by the police union. CNN has sought comment from the Miami-Dade Police Department. In a statement to CNN, the Broward County State Attorney\u2019s Office said, \u201cGrand jury proceedings are secret under Florida law, and any proceedings or actions taken by a grand jury are not public until a judge makes them so. We are not at liberty to comment at this time.\u201d Stahl pointed to the officers\u2019 indictments \u2013 as well as the indictment of a former school resource officer who was found not guilty for not entering an active mass shooting scene at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in 2018 \u2013 and warned that the prosecutions send mixed messages to law enforcement. \u201cIt sends a chilling effect to officers in Broward County that their State Attorney\u2019s Office prosecutes one officer for not responding to an active shooter and now indicting officers for responding to active shooters. As the process moves forward, we will monitor it and defend our officers,\u201d Stahl said. The 2019 confrontation began with an armed robbery at a jewelry store in Coral Gables, near Miami. The two suspects, Lamar Alexander and Ronnie Jerome Hill, then hijacked the UPS truck and took its driver hostage, leading police on a 30-mile chase that spanned two counties and was punctuated by occasional gunfire from the delivery truck. The chase ground to a halt at a traffic-packed intersection in Miramar, where gunfire wizzed between the suspects and police, some of whom were using their vehicles as impromptu shields. In the end, four people were shot and killed, including the two robbery suspects, a bystander, and\u00a0hostage UPS driver Frank Ordonez, who relatives say had been filling in\u00a0for a colleague who had called out from work that day. The bystander, Richard \u201cRick\u201d Cutshaw, was a local union field representative who was caught in the crossfire as he was driving home from work, according to Don Slesnick, a lawyer for the Office and Professional Employees International Union where Cutshaw worked. At least 13 police officers were shot at, but none were injured, Stahl said at the time.

{"id": "2024_06_11_media_pro-trump-media-hunter-biden-conviction", "text": "In the wake of Hunter Biden\u2019s conviction on federal gun charges Tuesday, right-wing media personalities sought to downplay the jury\u2019s decision, falsely claiming the case was a \u201cfake trial\u201d designed to \u201ccover up\u201d other supposed crimes committed by the president and his family. The reaction showcased how far to the fringes\u00a0the\u00a0right-wing and pro-Trump media\u00a0ecosystem has\u00a0drifted in recent years, with\u00a0high-profile personalities defaulting to\u00a0conspiracy theories\u00a0and\u00a0innuendo in response to\u00a0inconvenient political news. \u201cHunter Biden guilty. Yawn,\u201d right-wing talk show host Charlie Kirk wrote. \u201cThe true crimes of the Biden Crime Family remain untouched. This is a fake trial trying to make the Justice system appear \u2018balanced.\u2019 Don\u2019t fall for it.\u201d While right-wing figures and Republicans have long pushed the narrative that President Joe Biden has been involved in criminal activity, their claims have repeatedly fallen flat.\u00a0But the\u00a0reaction\u00a0rippled throughout the pro-Trump world\u00a0Tuesday\u00a0with\u00a0other far-right influencers and Trump-boosting Republicans echoing the\u00a0sentiment. \u201cThey went after Hunter on his gun stuff to make you overlook all his Ukraine stuff,\u201d Jack Posobiec,\u00a0the far-right conspiracy theorist\u00a0and Real America\u2019s Voice host,\u00a0wrote\u00a0on X. Donald Trump\u2019s campaign also\u00a0slammed\u00a0the verdict,\u00a0pushing\u00a0the conspiracy theory that the president had taken money from foreign governments. \u201cThis trial has been nothing more than a distraction from the real crimes of the Biden Crime Family, which has raked in tens of millions of dollars from China, Russia and Ukraine,\u201d the Trump campaign said a statement to CNN. \u201cCrooked Joe Biden\u2019s reign over the Biden Family Criminal Empire is all coming to an end on November 5th, and never again will a Biden sell government access for personal profit.\u201d There is\u00a0no evidence\u00a0Joe Biden has received large sums of money from China or has otherwise gained wealth as a result of his son\u2019s business dealings abroad. The former president\u2019s son\u00a0Donald Trump Jr.\u00a0also alleged in a live conversation on X that the younger Biden\u2019s trial was \u201cnot what it seems.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s trying to create that illusion of equal justice under the law,\u201d\u00a0he claimed. Instead, Trump Jr. alleged the case\u00a0was a \u201ccover up\u201d for the \u201creal charges and all the things that tied back to Joe Biden himself lapse, drop, expire in terms of statute of limitations.\u201d Many of the former president\u2019s supporters also\u00a0reacted with\u00a0similar\u00a0sentiments. \u201cThey want you focused on the shiny little object of Hunter\u2019s gun so you\u2019re not focused on the Bidens making bank selling out America,\u201d\u00a0Monica Crowley, the former Trump administration official\u00a0and Fox News contributor, wrote on X. The reaction stood in contrast to just last month when former President Donald Trump was convicted on all 34 counts in\u00a0the\u00a0New York\u00a0hush money trial. For\u00a0others\u00a0in the right-wing sphere, it\u2019s simple; Trump\u2019s case was a political hit job while Hunter Biden\u2019s case was a clear case of someone breaking the law. \u201cWe have gone over a cliff,\u201d Fox News host Jeanine Pirro said shortly after Trump was found guilty. \u201cThis is a new era in America, and I think it goes against the ilk of who we are as Americans and our faith in the criminal justice system.\u201d But\u00a0on Tuesday after the jury\u00a0delivered its\u00a0guilty verdict, Pirro\u00a0applauded the\u00a0Delaware\u00a0judge\u00a0-\u00a0a Trump appointee\u00a0-\u00a0for\u00a0her\u00a0handling of the Hunter Biden case. \u201cThis is a no-nonsense judge who took this case, showed America how a case worked and moved it right from opening statement to verdict,\u201d she said. Virginia Rep. Bob Good,\u00a0who leads the hard-right House Freedom Caucus,\u00a0offered a similar assessment. \u201cHunter Biden is convicted of an actual crime.

Meanwhile,\u00a0Mark Levin, the right-wing talk radio\u00a0personality\u00a0and Fox News weekend host, wrote that Biden was convicted \u201cin a real trial (not a farce like Manhattan).\u201d Still, other Trump boosting Republicans reacted with a\u00a0shrug\u00a0. \u201cThe Hunter Biden gun conviction is kinda dumb tbh,\u201d Florida GOP Rep.

{"id": "2024_06_10_us_rev-james-lawson-jr-civil-rights-icon-dies", "text": "The Rev. James Lawson Jr., a civil rights icon who trained activists in nonviolent protest, died Sunday, according to the pastor at Holman United Methodist Church in Los Angeles, where Lawson was reverend emeritus. Lawson died in Los Angeles, Rev. Christian Washington told CNN Monday. He was 95. Lawson was born in Uniontown, Pennsylvania, in 1928,\u00a0according to\u00a0his biography by The Martin Luther King, Jr. Research and Education Institute at Stanford University. In 1951, he was imprisoned for refusing to register with the armed forces. After his parole the following year, he traveled to India for missionary work with the Methodist Church, the biography states. There, he studied\u00a0Mahatma\u00a0Gandhi\u2019s use of nonviolence. He returned to the United States in 1956 and studied at Oberlin College School of Theology and Vanderbilt University, according to the biography. Lawson met the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. the following year. The civil rights leader urged Lawson to move to the South to teach nonviolence to others, his biography states, and that same year, Lawson would organize workshops on nonviolence for residents of Nashville and students at Vanderbilt and elsewhere. Following the lunch counter sit-ins in Greensboro, North Carolina, Lawson and other activists held nonviolent protests in Nashville\u2019s downtown stores, according to the biography. He was expelled from Vanderbilt in 1960 due to his involvement in the city\u2019s desegregation movement. King went on to praise Lawson and other preachers for \u201cfighting for the rights of his people\u201d in his April 3, 1968, \u201cI\u2019ve Been to the Mountaintop\u201d speech \u2013 his last. \u201cAnd I want to commend the preachers, under the leadership of these noble men: James Lawson, one who has been in this struggle for many years; he\u2019s been to jail for struggling; but he\u2019s still going on, fighting for the rights of his people. Rev. Ralph Jackson, Billy Kiles; I could just go right on down the list, but time will not permit,\u201d King said. \u201cBut I want to thank them all. And I want you to thank them, because so often, preachers aren\u2019t concerned about anything but themselves. And I\u2019m always happy to see a relevant ministry.\u201d After King\u2019s assassination, Lawson continued working with civil rights groups, including the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. Lawson was the pastor of Holman United Methodist Church in Los Angeles from 1974 to 1999, according to the\u00a0church. He held workshops on nonviolence well into his 90s, Washington said. Lawson also taught at the University of California Los Angeles\u2019 college of social sciences, and university officials\u00a0there\u00a0called him\u00a0\u201cone of the most impactful social justice leaders of the twentieth-century.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/10/us/rev-james-lawson-jr-civil-rights-icon-dies/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/12/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_11_us_pamela-smart-accepts-responsibility-husband-killing", "text": "Concord, New Hampshire (AP) \u2014 Pamela Smart, who is serving life in prison for plotting with her teenage student to have her husband killed in 1990, accepted full responsibility for his death for the first time in a videotaped statement released Tuesday as part of her latest sentence reduction request. Smart, 56, was a 22-year-old high school media coordinator when she began an affair with a 15-year-old boy who later fatally shot her husband, Gregory Smart, in Derry, New Hampshire. The shooter was freed in 2015 after serving a 25-year sentence. Though Pamela Smart denied knowledge of the plot, she was convicted of being an accomplice to first-degree murder and other crimes and sentenced to life without parole. Smart has been incarcerated for nearly 34 years. She said in the statement that she began to \u201cdig deeper into her own responsibility\u201d through her experience in a writing group that \u201cencouraged us to go beyond and to spaces that we didn\u2019t want to be in. \u201cFor me that was really hard, because going into those places, in those spaces is where I found myself responsible for something I desperately didn\u2019t want to be responsible for, my husband\u2019s murder,\u201d she said, her voice quavering. \u201cI had to acknowledge for the first time in my own mind and my own heart how responsible I was, because I had deflected blame all the time, I think, almost as if it was a coping mechanism, because the truth of being so responsible was very difficult for me.\u201d She asked to have an \u201chonest conversation\u201d with New Hampshire\u2019s five-member Executive Council, which approves state contracts and appointees to the courts and state agencies, and with Gov. Chris Sununu. The council rejected her latest request in 2022 and Smart appealed to the state Supreme Court, which dismissed her petition last year. Val Fryatt, a cousin of Gregory Smart, told The Associated Press that Smart \u201cdanced around it\u201d and accepted full responsibility \u201cwithout admitting the facts around what made her \u2018fully responsible.\u2019\u201d Fryatt noted that Smart didn\u2019t mention her cousin\u2019s name in the video, \u201cnot even once.\u201d Messages seeking comment on the petition and statement were sent to the council members, Sununu, and the attorney general\u2019s office. Smart is serving time at Bedford Hills Correctional Facility in Westchester County, New York. She has earned two master\u2019s degrees behind bars and has also tutored fellow inmates, been ordained as a minister and been part of an inmate liaison committee. She said she is remorseful and has been rehabilitated. The trial was a media circus and one of America\u2019s first high-profile cases about a sexual affair between a school staff member and a student. Joyce Maynard wrote \u201cTo Die For\u201d in 1992, drawing from the Smart case. That inspired a 1995 film of the same name, starring Nicole Kidman and Joaquin Phoenix. The killer, William Flynn, and three other teens cooperated with prosecutors. They served shorter sentences and have been released.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/11/us/pamela-smart-accepts-responsibility-husband-killing/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/12/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_11_business_chiquita-banana-liable-paramilitary-group-colombia", "text": "A Florida jury on Monday found banana company Chiquita Brands International liable for financing the Colombian paramilitary group Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia (AUC). The jury in the civil case, in federal court in the Southern District of Florida, found that \u201cChiquita knowingly provided substantial assistance to the AUC to a degree sufficient to create a foreseeable risk of harm to others.\u201d Chiquita, one of the world\u2019s largest banana producers, has been ordered to pay a total of $38.3 million to the families of eight victims of the AUC, which was a far-right paramilitary group that was designated a terrorist organization by the US. The group disbanded in 2006, according to Stanford University\u2019s Mapping Militants Project. In an amended Florida lawsuit, which was filed in 2008, the plaintiffs alleged payments from Chiquita to the AUC propped up the paramilitary group\u2019s violence in Colombia and that the company should be held liable for the group\u2019s murders. In a statement to CNN, Chiquita said it planned to appeal to jury\u2019s verdict.  \u201cThe situation in Colombia was tragic for so many, including those directly affected by the violence there, and our thoughts remain with them and their families. However, that does not change our belief that there is no legal basis for these claims,\u201d the company\u2019s statement said. \u201cWhile we are disappointed by the decision, we remain confident that our legal position will ultimately prevail.\u201d Searcy Law, a law firm representing AUC victims and their families, applauded Tuesday\u2019s decision in a press release. \u201cThe verdict sends a powerful message: corporations will be held accountable when business decisions prioritize profits over human lives,\u201d\u00a0Searcy Law said. The lives of the victims were devastated as a result of violence by AUC, Searcy Law said. CNN has reached out to the victims\u2019 families. In 2007, Chiquita pleaded guilty to making over 100 payments to the AUC totaling over $1.7 million despite the group being designated a terrorist organization. Chiquita recorded the AUC payments as \u201csecurity services,\u201d though the company never received any actual services from these payments, according to a US Justice Department press release from the time. The company agreed to pay the US government a $25 million fine, the US said in its release. An unnamed company executive had told the Justice Department that the payments had been made under the threat of violence, according to the release. However, the Florida jury ruled that Chiquita failed to \u201cact as a reasonable businessperson would have acted under the circumstances.\u201d \u201cChiquita\u2019s claim that it was forced to support the terrorists because it was itself the victim of extortion was a defense expressly rejected by the jury,\u201d Searcy Law said. Searcy Law attorney Victoria Mesa-Estrada\u00a0said the verdict is a wake-up call for businesses to \u201cre-evaluate their operations and ensure they are not even indirectly supporting violence or human rights abuses.\u201d In a social media post, Colombia\u2019s president, Gustavo Petro, reacted to the American jury\u2019s Tuesday decision and asked why the same ruling was not made in his home country. \u201cWhy could US justice determine in judicial truth that Chiquita Brands financed paramilitarism in Urab\u00e1? Why couldn\u2019t Colombian justice?\u201d he said in a post on X translated from Spanish.  This story has been updated with additional details.

{"id": "2024_06_10_us_baltimore-bridge-shipping-channel-opens", "text": "The Port of Baltimore\u2019s shipping channel is fully operational again, response officials announced Monday, more than two months after a massive cargo ship crashed into the Francis Scott Key Bridge, killing six construction workers and cutting off access to the crucial shipping artery. \u201cWe\u2019ve cleared the Fort McHenry Federal Channel for safe transit,\u201d Baltimore District Commander Col. Estee Pinchasin said in a statement Monday. \u201cAlthough the overarching goal to restore full operational capacity to the Federal Channel was successful, each day we thought of those who lost their lives, their families and the workers impacted by this tragic event.\u201d \u201cNot a day went by that we didn\u2019t think about all of them, and that kept us going,\u201d Pinchasin added. Fully reopening the 700-foot wide channel meant crews had to remove roughly 50,000 tons of wreckage from the Patapsco River, according to a Monday news release from Unified Command, a group of agencies that led the response to the collapse. That response included more than 2,000 people and subject matter experts, nearly two dozen tugboats, 13 floating cranes and 10 excavators, among other equipment. The channel, which provides access to an essential international cargo destination, closed to vessel traffic on March 26, after a 213-million pound cargo ship\u00a0lost power and crashed into\u00a0one of the bridge\u2019s support columns, causing the structure to collapse. The collapse, which was captured in stunning video, sparked a multi-agency investigation into what caused the disaster. Recovery crews worked for weeks to remove debris and recover the victims, who were from Honduras, El Salvador, Mexico and Guatemala \u2013 though many had called Maryland home for years. They were fathers, loving partners, sons and visionaries who left behind grieving communities and unfulfilled dreams. The ship, a container vessel called Dali, remained lodged in the channel until it was hauled away on May 20, after crews were able to remove a piece of the bridge that had been pinning down its bow. The ship\u2019s removal allowed for the opening of a temporary 400-foot channel, and cruise ships were able to once again depart from the port at the end of May. Last week, crews cleared the final large steel truss that had been blocking the full channel and had been working to ensure no hazards remain, according to the Unified Command. The closing of the channel was a blow to the port\u2019s economy, which officials say supported tens of thousands of jobs. While the full cost of rebuilding the bridge is not clear, President Joe Biden has pledged federal support to make it happen. The Insurance Information Institute has estimated the bridge alone could be worth more than $1.2 billion.

Nancy Mace will win the Republican primary for the state\u2019s 1st Congressional District, CNN projects, staving off two challengers and a push by allies of former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, whom she voted to oust. By taking a majority of the vote Tuesday, Mace is projected to avoid a June 25 primary runoff in her quest for a third term representing the coastal Charleston-area seat. Tuesday\u2019s outcome comes as\u00a0a much-needed win for Mace, who has become an increasingly polarizing figure within her party. She has faced waves of criticism over the past several months, including accusations that she created a toxic workplace to anger over votes by her and seven other Republicans to boot McCarthy from the speakership in October. Days after the move, Mace wore a white T-shirt with a red \u201cA\u201d on the front, a reference to the novel \u201cThe Scarlet Letter\u201d and what she described as a demonization of her vote. McCarthy sought his revenge at the ballot box, with his allies spending millions attacking Mace during the primary. The congresswoman and groups backing her painted chief opponent Catherine Templeton \u2013 a former South Carolina Cabinet official under Republican Gov. Nikki Haley \u2013 as a McCarthy puppet. Mace has faced criticism for her evolving relationship with former President Donald Trump. After the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol, Mace told CNN that Trump\u2019s \u201centire legacy was wiped out\u201d that day. In the run-up to the 2022 midterm elections, Trump backed her primary opponent Katie Arrington. Among Mace\u2019s chief backers in that primary was Haley, who campaigned with Mace and appeared in a TV ad on her behalf.\u00a0Mace went on to defeat Arrington by 8 points. Two years later, Mace endorsed Trump over Haley ahead of South Carolina\u2019s Republican presidential primary. The former president endorsed Mace in March, calling her a \u201cstrong conservative voice.\u201d Mace was first elected in 2020, when she narrowly unseated Democratic incumbent Joe Cunningham. She comfortably won reelection two years later after the district was redrawn to become more favorable to the GOP. A three-judge panel concluded last year that the district\u2019s new lines amounted to an unconstitutional racial gerrymander.

{"id": "2024_06_11_politics_joe-biden-hunter-biden-verdict", "text": "When Hunter Biden was discharged from the Navy Reserve for using cocaine in 2014, his father \u2014 then-Vice President Joe Biden \u2014 wrote his family a concise message of summation. \u201cTime to move on,\u201d he said in an email. For the Bidens, moving on from Hunter\u2019s issues of addiction has proved almost impossible. Even with their son now sober and living in California with his young family, the darkest days of the family\u2019s lives continue to bear consequences in ways that weigh heavily on the president. Hunter Biden\u2019s guilty verdict on three federal gun charges Tuesday punctuated \u2014 but did not end \u2014 what has been a long and difficult saga. Joe Biden, who had planned to spend Tuesday night at the White House, returned late in the day to Delaware to surround himself with members of his family, many of whom spent the last week attending the trial. Greeting him at the steps to Marine One was his son, who only five hours earlier had left the downtown courthouse newly convicted. If the family felt anguished, they did not show it \u2014 at least not in view of the cameras. Instead, the president offered his family a warm smile, hugged Hunter Biden\u2019s young son, Beau, and gave him a kiss on the forehead. Joe Biden has little precedent to follow in navigating his son\u2019s conviction. Never before has a president\u2019s immediate family member been found guilty of a crime during their father\u2019s term in office. While the emotional weight and concern are shared by his family, doing so as president is a unique burden. Aside from the last-minute trip to Delaware \u2014 first floated as a possibility late Monday night, a source familiar with the plans said, with a final decision reached Tuesday afternoon following the verdict \u2014 the president\u2019s schedule wasn\u2019t altered. He still spoke Tuesday afternoon at an event on gun violence prevention in Washington, despite the political awkwardness of the subject matter. And he is still planning to travel to Italy on Wednesday for the G7. The display of warmth on the tarmac Tuesday was in keeping with the president\u2019s approach to his son\u2019s legal predicament. Instead of pushing him away, as some wary Democrats might prefer, the president has held Hunter Biden close throughout his ordeal. From the airport, where hugs were also exchanged between Biden family members and close aides, the group traveled in separate cars to the president\u2019s home in a leafy Wilmington neighborhood to process the developments in private. It has been behind closed doors that Joe Biden and his family have mostly kept their concerns over their son\u2019s legal issues. The president has been wary of speaking about the matter publicly, and it\u2019s not a topic aides raise easily. Asked during an interview with ABC last week about the case, Biden offered only one-word answers. \u201cYes,\u201d he would accept the verdict. \u201cYes,\u201d he had ruled out a pardon. The private nature of the circumstances in the case made the very public airing of traumatic moments during last week\u2019s trial all the more difficult. Tearful moments from the president\u2019s granddaughter Naomi deeply affected many family members. And the revelation that Hallie Biden \u2014 the widow of the president\u2019s late son, Beau Biden, who later had a relationship with Hunter Biden \u2014 had herself tried crack cocaine reverberated throughout the wider Biden orbit. In a statement following the verdict, Joe Biden framed the conviction through the lens of a father, not a president. \u201cJill and I love our son, and we are so proud of the man he is today. So many families who have had loved ones battle addiction understand the feeling of pride seeing someone you love come out the other side and be so strong and resilient in recovery,\u201d the president wrote. He also sought to draw an implicit but clear distinction with former President Donald Trump, who has called the judicial system \u201crigged\u201d in the wake of his own felony conviction on charges of falsifying business records. \u201cI will accept the outcome of this case and will continue to respect the judicial process as Hunter considers an appeal,\u201d the president wrote. \u201cJill and I will always be there for Hunter and the rest of our family with our love and support. Nothing will ever change that.\u201d What role the verdict will play in November\u2019s election remains difficult to discern, although Biden\u2019s aides and even many Republicans have downplayed the prospect of voters being swayed by the legal problems of the president\u2019s son. Biden aides \u2013 upon learning of the verdict \u2013 made clear to allies that despite the historic conviction of a sitting president\u2019s son, everything would be business as usual for the campaign, two sources familiar with the campaign\u2019s thinking said. Even as Hunter Biden\u2019s trial got underway, officials inside the president\u2019s campaign headquarters in Wilmington maintained that voters understand what they see as a black-and-white difference between Trump, who is a former president and now a convicted felon, and Hunter Biden, who \u2013 despite being the president\u2019s son \u2013 is a private citizen. One of the two sources said officials in Wilmington unsurprisingly discussed the guilty verdict, but the source declined to describe the tenor of those conversations. That reticence was a clear reflection of a reality that Biden allies know well: Few issues are more sensitive inside the White House and the president\u2019s reelection campaign operation than those related to his family. Perhaps more worrying than the political fallout, at least for some people close to Biden, is the personal toll the verdict could have on the president as he gears up for a bruising rematch against Trump. Biden, who speaks or texts with his son on a daily basis, has been concerned for his well-being throughout the legal saga. The president is still expected to spend ample time in the coming weeks preparing for his June 27 debate with Trump. And a day after one of the most painful moments for his family, Biden is expected to leave for a three-day trip to Italy for the G7 summit. The fluke of scheduling speaks to the balance Biden has been forced to strike throughout his son\u2019s legal proceedings. As the trial was underway last week, Biden was in France commemorating D-Day. Aides said the president was keeping track of the trial from overseas, and remained in touch with his son and first lady Jill Biden, who was a regular presence in the courtroom, along with their daughter Ashley, the president\u2019s brother James, and the first lady\u2019s sister Bonny Jacobs. Before and after that trip, the president spent a sizable amount of time with Hunter Biden in Delaware, including at the family beach home in Rehoboth the weekend before jury selection. He returned from France directly to the family home in Wilmington. That city rests at the very center of the Biden family identity. The train station the president passed through thousands of times as a senator and vice president is now named in his honor. The courthouse where the trial unfolded is named for the Republican senator Biden defeated in 1972. The president\u2019s reelection campaign is headquartered a few blocks away. Farther out of town is the home on a lake the Biden family has returned to in moments of joy and times of pain. The driveway out front is where, in the depths of Hunter Biden\u2019s addiction, his father once chased his son after an attempted intervention, grabbed him close in the dark and cried. It is there the family retreated on Tuesday as they begin to work through the next chapter.

Police said they will not release the identity of the person who died until family members have been notified. The suspect was identified as Joseph Grier, a 39-year-old felon, Atlanta Police Chief Darin Schierbaum said at a news conference. CNN has not been able to determine if Grier has retained legal counsel at this time. The chief called the bus driver \u201ca hero\u201d as he was in \u201ca very dangerous situation\u201d yet remained committed to his passengers. He noted the driver was shaken up by the \u201charrowing experience.\u201d The chief said 17 people were on the bus, including the driver. Authorities responded to a report of gunfire on a bus\u00a0in downtown Atlanta at roughly 4:35 p.m Tuesday and upon arrival, the bus took off, the Atlanta Police Department said. Following a chase that\u00a0took place on I-85 and surface streets in\u00a0multiple counties, the suspect was taken into custody \u201cwithout further incident,\u201d police said. Inside the bus, officers found an adult with a gunshot wound, who died at a hospital, according to police. There were no other injuries to the people on the bus, according to authorities. The bus hit several vehicles during the pursuit, police said. It was not immediately known whether any motorists were hurt. A man told CNN his wife called him from the bus to say someone had been shot and she was scared.

Shortly after the bus came to a stop\u00a0in the suburb of Stone Mountain, one person was seen being led away in handcuffs. A police armored vehicle was parked in front of the bus and at least a dozen law enforcement vehicles were parked behind it on the street.

{"id": "2024_06_11_business_amazon-contract-workers-file-legal-claims", "text": "More than 15,000 Amazon contract drivers filed arbitration claims against the e-commerce giant on Tuesday, alleging Amazon classified them as independent contractors instead of employees with minimum wage and overtime rights. Millions of Americans participate in the \u201cgig economy,\u201d freelancing work through delivery and ride apps like Lyft, Uber, Doordash and Instacart. But as gig work has gotten more popular, many of those workers say they are in fact employees, not just contractors, and therefore deserve more benefits and protections. The definition and rights of a contract worker versus an employee, for example, has been fiercely debated in laws such as California\u2019s Prop 22, which allows ride-hailing and delivery drivers to be treated as independent contractors with some added benefits, including a minimum earnings guarantee. Amazon Flex, launched in 2015, allows independent contractors to sign up to deliver Amazon packages. Flex drivers provide Amazon Fresh grocery deliveries or same-day deliveries from the company\u2019s warehouse hubs. Since the drivers are classified as independent contractors, these claims ask for compensation for unpaid wages and overtime, and reimbursement for expenses such as mileage and cell phone usage. Lawyers for the case said in a statement that about 450 such claims had been previously filed with the American Arbitration Association. Drivers from California, Massachusetts and Illinois filed claims because laws about employee misclassification are \u201cvery clear\u201d in those states, attorney Steven Tindall told CNN. The three states also allow workers to file claims for expense reimbursement from employers, Tindall added. Tindall and another attorney, Joseph Sellers, have been collecting claims for years, Tindall said. In a statement, Amazon said Flex \u201cgives individuals the opportunity to set their own schedule and be their own boss, while earning competitive pay. We hear from most of the Amazon Flex delivery partners that they love the flexibility of the program, and we\u2019re proud of the work they do on behalf of customers every day.\u201d\u00a0On its website, Amazon says most drivers earn between $18 to $25 an hour. In their statement, Tindall and Sellers said Amazon only pays the drivers for a pre-determined \u201cblock.\u201d If a Flex driver books a three-hour block on the app, they only get paid for three hours, even if deliveries come in that take more time. Tindall told CNN that the workers filed independent arbitration claims instead of a class action lawsuit because drivers have to sign an agreement that forbids class action. \u201cArbitration, unfortunately, limits the drivers\u2019 pursuit of justice. So, we\u2019re left with little choice but to file almost 16,000 individual arbitration actions at once,\u201d Tindall said. CNN\u2019s Samantha Delouya contributed to this report.

The\u00a02023 law, passed by Florida\u2019s Republican-led legislature and signed by Gov. Ron DeSantis, prohibits doctors and nurses from prescribing medication, including hormones or puberty blockers, to anyone under 18. \u201cThe State of Florida can regulate as needed but cannot flatly deny transgender individuals safe and effective medical treatment\u2014treatment with medications routinely provided to others with the state\u2019s full approval so long as the purpose is not to support the patient\u2019s transgender identity,\u201d the order states. The transgender plaintiffs and their parents argued the law violated their constitutional rights. In a 105-page order, Hinkle agreed, writing: \u201cWhether based on morals, religion, unmoored hatred, or anything else, prohibiting or impeding a person from conforming to the person\u2019s gender identity rather than to the person\u2019s natal sex is not a legitimate state interest.\u201d The order does not address the state law\u2019s ban on gender-affirming surgery for minors or surgery restrictions for adults as the lawsuit did not challenge those provisions, Hinkle noted. Simone Chriss, transgender rights initiative director at the nonprofit Southern Legal Counsel law firm, called the move \u201ca victory for the state of Florida\u201d in a statement. \u201cThe federal court saw Florida\u2019s transgender minor healthcare ban and adult restrictions for what they are\u2014discriminatory measures that cannot survive constitutional review,\u201d Chriss said. \u201cToday\u2019s ruling blocks the state of Florida\u2019s cruel campaign to deny fundamental rights and basic healthcare to its transgender citizens.\u201d In a statement following the order, DeSantis\u2019 office said the state will appeal the ruling. \u201cThrough their elected representatives, the people of Florida acted to protect children in this state, and the Court was wrong to override their wishes,\u201d the statement said. \u201cWe disagree with the Court\u2019s erroneous rulings on the law, on the facts, and on the science. As we\u2019ve seen here in Florida, the United Kingdom, and across Europe, there is no quality evidence to support the chemical and physical mutilation of children.

But the man and his former attorney say he has never stepped foot in Spain and have insisted he is innocent. David Knezevich, 36, was arraigned and pleaded not guilty on Monday to a kidnapping charge in federal court in Miami \u2013 four months after his wife was last seen in Madrid, according to court records. His wife, Ana Maria Knezevich Henao, has not been heard from since February 2, the day a man wearing a face covering and helmet \u2013 who prosecutors allege was Knezevich \u2013 entered her apartment building in Madrid and spray-painted the lens of a building surveillance camera. About an hour later, the man emerged from an elevator with a suitcase, according to the criminal complaint. Before Knezevich\u2019s arrest in Florida in May, his attorney at the time, Kenneth Padowitz, told CNN that his client \u201chas never been to Spain\u201d and had nothing to do with the incident. But investigators allege Knezevich has been tied to the crime using the can of spray paint, security camera footage, stolen license plates and rental car records, as well as messages he sent to a woman he\u2019d met on a dating app. If convicted, the husband faces a maximum sentence of life in prison. How FBI investigators built their case Knezevich\u2019s current attorney, Jayne C. Weintraub, filed a request on Monday to the court for a hearing on the court\u2019s order of detention, asking to cross-examine an FBI agent regarding new evidence and allegations in the case since a detention hearing last month. The couple had lived in Florida and were planning to divorce, but the separation had become tense because Knezevich didn\u2019t want to evenly split their assets, the criminal complaint said. Padowitz, however, told CNN in February that the split was amicable. Henao had moved to Spain in December and had been living in an apartment in an apartment in Madrid\u2019s upscale Salamanca neighborhood, court documents said. When Henao disappeared from her apartment in February, Knezevich was far away in his native Serbia, Knezevich\u2019s former attorney Padowitz has said. But federal officials said records show Knezevich flew from Miami to Turkey in January and then went to Belgrade, Serbia, where he rented a small car on January 29. The owner of the rental car agency told investigators that when the car was returned in mid-March, someone had tinted its windows and added a new license plate frame, and it had traveled nearly 4,800 miles, the criminal complaint said. Toll booth cameras captured images of the same model Peugeot, with tinted windows, near Madrid in the late night and early morning of February 2 and 3. It had\u00a0license plates stolen from another vehicle on the Madrid street where Henao was living, the complaint said. Shortly after 9 p.m. the night of Henao\u2019s disappearance, a man wearing a face covering and helmet but with \u201cphysical characteristics\u201d resembling Knezevich entered her apartment building and partially obscured the surveillance camera with spray paint, investigators said. Spanish investigators identified the brand of spray paint and determined that a Madrid retailer had sold the same paint, along with two rolls of duct tape, to a man who resembled Knezevich the same day Henao was last seen, the criminal complaint said. Henao, a US citizen originally from Colombia, was in constant communication with her loved ones while overseas. She was planning a trip to Barcelona with her friends on February 5, her brother told CNN, but she abruptly stopped communicating and never showed up for the trip. Two days before the trip, her friend Sanna Rameau received a puzzling WhatsApp message from Henao indicating she was abruptly leaving town with a man she had just met. The message, seen by CNN, read: \u201cI met someone wonderful!! He has a summer house about 2h (hours) from Madrid. We are going there now and I will spend a few days there. Signal is spotty. I\u2019ll call you when I get back.\u201d Henao and Rameau had spoken by phone just hours before her disappearance but she had not mentioned meeting a dreamy stranger, Rameau told CNN. Investigators allege the texts sent from Henao\u2019s phone were really sent by her husband. He is believed to have asked another Colombian woman whom he had met on a dating app to help translate the messages into Colombian, court documents said. The message he sent to the unidentified Colombian woman to translate was the same one sent from Henao\u2019s phone saying she\u2019d met a new guy, court documents said.

{"id": "2024_06_11_politics_joe-biden-hunter-biden-gun-violence-speech", "text": "President Joe Biden on Tuesday heralded the steps his administration has taken to strengthen the country\u2019s gun laws and enhance the penalties for those who violate them, in what was an awkward political moment for a man whose son had been convicted just hours earlier on federal gun charges. Speaking at an Everytown for Gun Safety event under a banner that read \u201cGun Sense University\u201d in large block letters, the president did not reference his son\u2019s conviction. Hunter Biden was pronounced guilty earlier in the day of three felony charges after a jury found he lied on a form by saying he was not abusing drugs when he purchased a firearm in 2018. Instead,\u00a0speaking as someone who has had two children die prematurely,\u00a0he spent much of his remarks reflecting on personal loss\u00a0and saying\u00a0that he empathized with those in the audience who have lost loved ones to gun violence. \u201cNever give up on hope,\u201d the president told the audience. While Biden did not reference his son\u2019s conviction on stage Tuesday afternoon, it was sure to be at the top of his mind. Biden is known to be passionately defensive of his family and sensitive to outside criticism of his son\u2019s troubled history. The president rearranged his schedule to leave directly from the gun-safety event for Wilmington, where his son remains after the jury there convicted him. The White House cancelled a previously scheduled press briefing that was to take place Tuesday afternoon. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the timing of Biden\u2019s address and his son\u2019s federal trial Tuesday morning. While Biden has largely avoided commenting on his son\u2019s trial - he said in an interview last week that he would respect the trial\u2019s outcome and would not pardon his son - the outcome of the jury\u2019s verdict is sure to be at the top of his mind on Tuesday. The president is known to be passionately defensive of his family and sensitive to outside criticism of his son\u2019s troubled history. \u201cAs I said last week, I am the President, but I am also a Dad. Jill and I love our son, and we are so proud of the man he is today,\u201d Biden said in a statement following the verdict. \u201cSo many families who have had loved ones battle addiction understand the feeling of pride seeing someone you love come out the other side and be so strong and resilient in recovery. As I also said last week, I will accept the outcome of this case and will continue to respect the judicial process as Hunter considers an appeal. Jill and I will always be there for Hunter and the rest of our family with our love and support. Nothing will ever change that.\u201d The painful moment for the Biden family comes a day before\u00a0President Biden is expected to leave for a three-day trip to Italy for the G7 summit. The fluke of scheduling speaks to the balance Biden has been forced to strike throughout his son\u2019s legal proceedings. As the trial was underway last week, Biden was in France commemorating D-Day. Aides said the president was keeping track of the trial from overseas, and remained in touch with his son and first lady Dr. Jill Biden, who had returned to Delaware to attend the trial for one day. Before and after that trip, Biden spent a sizable amount of time with Hunter in Delaware. He returned from France directly to the family home in Wilmington. He\u2019ll attempt to put the personal drama on the back-burner while he talks about gun violence, a topic that he views as key to his political life. As a senator, the president helped get an assault weapons ban passed through Congress in the 1990s and has promised to do so again. He also frequently touts signing the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, which was the first significant gun safety legislation in a quarter-century when it was passed. That act, which was signed into law by Biden almost two years ago, was created in the wake of massacres at a Texas elementary school and a New York supermarket. It established new criminal offenses for the straw-purchasing of firearms by buyers who lie about the gun\u2019s intended owner, among other provisions. \u201cIt\u2019s the most significant gun legislation in nearly 30 years, and we passed it only because you got out and worked like hell to get it done,\u201d Biden said Tuesday. \u201cI may have had the idea, but you got it made, you made it happen. It was designed to reduce gun violence and save lives, and I\u2019m so proud of the tremendous progress we\u2019ve made since then.\u201d Absent from Biden\u2019s comments Tuesday, however, was an announcement that the Department of Justice had brought more than 500 new gun charges using statutes under the bipartisan gun law. The White House had previewed the announcement to reporters ahead of the speech, but Biden instead opted to more broadly focus on it. The White House declined to comment on why the reference to the volume of prosecutions did not appear in the speech, pointing to the overarching message in the address. \u201cThe President highlighted the progress his Administration has made reducing crime and getting illegal guns off our streets,\u201d a White House spokesperson told CNN. Biden has pushed for universal background checks of gun purchases, increased red-flag laws that allow law enforcement to confiscate guns from those deemed a threat to safety, and a ban on assault weapons. He has said he would make those efforts a priority if he were to attain a second term. But most of those policies would include congressional cooperation, and gun control remains one of the most divisive and intractable topics in American politics. Former President Donald Trump, meanwhile, has promised to roll back any gun-control advancements made during Biden\u2019s term. Addressing the NRA convention in May, Trump said the rights of gun owners were \u201cunder siege\u201d and urged them to vote in November. This story has been updated with additional details.

On the morning his trial was set to begin in Manhattan Monday, Felix Herrera Garcia, 35, pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to distribute narcotics resulting in death and serious bodily injury, one count of possession with intent to distribute narcotics resulting in death and one count of possession with intent to distribute narcotics resulting in serious bodily injury, according to a statement from the US Attorney\u2019s Office of the Southern District of New York. All three counts carry a mandatory minimum sentence of 20 years in prison, with a maximum sentence of life in prison, prosecutors said. Herrera Garcia is the husband of Grei Mendez, the owner and operator of the day care, court documents showed. He\u00a0was captured by authorities in Mexico\u00a011 days after the incident. The charges stemmed from the death of Nicholas Dominici, 1, in 2023 after he and three others were exposed to suspected opioids at the Divino Ni\u00f1o day care in the Bronx. \u201cHerrera Garcia has now been held accountable in the tragic loss of little Nicholas, the serious injury of Abel, and the harm to Kiara and Jaziel,\u201d Bronx District Attorney Darcel Clark said in a statement Monday. About two weeks ago,\u00a0a co-conspirator, Renny Antonio Parra Paredes, 38, pleaded guilty to conspiring to distribute narcotics and stipulated his conduct caused death and serious bodily injury \u201cin connection with his role in the poisonings,\u201d prosecutors said. His guilty plea carries a mandatory minimum sentence of 20 years in prison, with a maximum sentence of life in prison. Paredes has \u201caccepted responsibility for his offense\u201d and \u201cexpressed his sadness and remorse for the harm to the children that he was a part of causing,\u201d Paredes\u2019 attorney John Kaley told CNN. \u201cHe also offered his most sincere apology to the families affected by the presence of drugs at the Daycare facility for what had occurred to their children.\u201d Mendez, the owner of the day care, and another defendant, Carlisto Acevedo Brito, are also facing federal charges in relation to the case. The US attorney\u2019s office told CNN Monday their cases are still pending. Mendez and Brito are also both facing\u00a0state murder charges\u00a0in connection to the infant\u2019s death, according to the Bronx DA\u2019s office. According to court documents, Brito is Herrera Garcia\u2019s cousin and a tenant who resided in a bedroom within the day care. All four people arrested as part of the alleged conspiracy were said to be mid-level drug distributors, a federal law enforcement official previously told CNN.

{"id": "us_queer-meaning-lgbtq-cec", "text": "For most of its\u00a0early\u00a0history, the word \u201cqueer\u201d\u00a0meant\u00a0unusual or out of the ordinary. Then it was co-opted as a homophobic insult for much of the 20th century before people from\u00a0LGBT\u00a0communities\u00a0reclaimed the term. Then, LGBTQ activists who identified as queer\u00a0showed that they were proud to be different. LGBTQ activist groups like Queer Nation chanted \u201cWe\u2019re here! We\u2019re queer! Get used to it!\u201d as a unifying call to action for all LGBTQ people. Now, queer is an identifier preferred by some LGBTQ people for its expansive and fluid nature, though others reject the word because of how it was used in the past. For\u00a0many of\u00a0those who embrace the term queer, identity isn\u2019t fixed \u2013\u2013 it evolves, and \u201cqueer\u201d can encapsulate both sexuality and gender identity throughout a person\u2019s life. \u201cQueerness is cloudy by definition \u2013\u2013\u00a0essentially, what is not the norm,\u201d said Maya Satya Reddy, founder of the Queer Asian Social Club, a collective that advocates for improved visibility of LGBTQ Asian Americans in media. \u201cI think queerness gave and still gives me a lot of space to flow between identities or what something means to me on that day.\u201d Here\u2019s what it means to be the Q in LGBTQ. What queer means today Queer is an expansive term used by some LGBTQ people to describe their sexuality, gender identity or both. It\u00a0may be\u00a0preferred by those who find other terms like \u201cgay\u201d or \u201cbisexual\u201d too restrictive or narrow, as well as\u00a0some people\u00a0whose identities are fluid and evolving. \u201c(Queer) includes all of the identities and lived experiences that are included under the LGBTQ acronym \u2013\u2013 folks that might otherwise identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender,\u201d said Samuel Allen, a clinical assistant professor at Northwestern University and a therapist at its Family Institute, where he focuses on LGBTQ health\u00a0and wellbeing. People who are nonbinary \u2013\u2013\u00a0that is,\u00a0those whose gender identity does not fall within the binary categories of man or woman, or who do not identify with any gender\u00a0\u2013\u2013\u00a0might also identify as queer, Allen said. The term may suit people who have a less strict or static relationship to gender. The history of how queer was used against LGBTQ people Queer was used as a relatively innocuous word when it entered the English lexicon in the early 16th century. Then, \u201cqueer\u201d meant peculiar, odd, or out of place, said Gregory Coles, a language scholar who\u00a0has\u00a0studied the histories of slurs\u00a0and how they\u2019re reclaimed by the marginalized people they\u2019re used against. \u201cQueer\u201d wasn\u2019t used as a homophobic slur, it\u2019s thought, until the end of the 19th century,\u00a0Coles said.\u00a0In a private letter in 1894,\u00a0the British nobleman\u00a0John Douglas\u00a0derisively referred\u00a0to men attracted to other men as \u201csnob queers,\u201d\u00a0including the Irish playwright Oscar Wilde, with whom one of his sons had a relationship, according to the United Kingdom\u2019s National Archives. The playwright sued Douglas for libel, but when the letter was made public, charges of gross indecency were brought against Wilde \u2013\u2013\u00a0homosexual acts were illegal in the UK, where Wilde had been living. Wilde was eventually\u00a0convicted and sentenced\u00a0to two years of hard labor, destroying his reputation as a celebrated writer and diminishing his savings. The derogatory use of \u201cqueer\u201d began to overtake the word\u2019s original definition. By the 1920s, the word had fallen out of popular usage because of its new homophobic association, Coles\u00a0said. \u201cWhere the word did appear, it typically carried the same level of hatred as Douglas\u2019 original use, paired with the same determination to destroy the lives of \u2018queers,\u2019\u201d Coles said. \u201cMost often, the word was associated with physical violence.\u201d Why some LGBTQ people prefer the term queer Queer is ambiguous on purpose, said Kaila Adia Story, an associate professor at the University of Louisville who studies the intersection of race and sexuality: It frees LGBTQ people\u00a0who use the term to describe themselves\u00a0from having to specify the particulars of their identity while acknowledging that they don\u2019t subscribe to\u00a0heteronormativity, or the belief that being straight is the norm of sexual behavior. \u201cQueer means not letting society, institutions, friends or loved ones define who you are or who you hope to be,\u201d Story said. \u201cIt means to define yourself for yourself, live boldly and unapologetically.\u201d The term also eschews some of the expectations and stereotypes that accompany terms like \u201cgay\u201d or \u201clesbian,\u201d which explicitly reference gender. \u201cSexuality doesn\u2019t have to have one specific definition, and queer allows people room to learn who they are and claim it for themselves,\u201d said Dr. Lexx Brown-James, a therapist and sex educator who cohosted \u201cQueer Sex Ed,\u201d a webseries from the LGBTQ advocacy organization It Gets Better. Young people particularly have gravitated toward the word because they\u2019re growing up during a time when the way we identify our sexualities and genders is evolving and diversifying beyond the binary of male and female, gay or straight, Allen said. Before nonbinary was a more commonly used identifier, the newer, more expansive definition of queer inspired the term genderqueer, which also refers to people whose gender identity isn\u2019t solely male or female. \u201cWith the (LGBT) acronym, there isn\u2019t really space for them,\u201d Allen said. \u201cQueer offers an opportunity for a bit more expansive view.\u201d Reddy said she has felt more comfortable using queer as an identifier than gay or lesbian because the terms \u201chave traditionally evoked very specific images\u201d that don\u2019t align with her self-perception. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t feel like me,\u201d she said. \u201cQueer, for me, really inhabits the space between\u201d rigid divisions of gender and sexuality. Gen Z adults identify as LGBTQ at much higher rates than older Americans, according to recent studies.\u00a0Queer is becoming a more common identifier among LGBTQ people,\u00a0particularly\u00a0among Gen Z,\u00a0Allen said, but it\u2019s not a \u201cuniversal preference.\u201d Some LGBTQ people from older generations still find the term offensive given its\u00a0history as a homophobic slur\u00a0throughout the 20th century. How LGBTQ people reclaimed the word In 1990, a group of activists from ACT UP, the New York-based organization\u00a0aimed at ending the AIDS crisis, debuted their new initiative: Queer Nation, an advocacy venture dedicated to ending discrimination against all LGBTQ people. They were among the first (or at least most visible) protesters to rehabilitate the word \u201cqueer\u201d into not only an identifying term, but a unifier under which all LGBTQ people could fit,\u00a0language scholar\u00a0Coles said. \u201cQueer\u201d was still widely considered an epithet then. In a leaflet distributed at New York\u2019s Pride Parade in 1990, Queer Nation explained its choice to call LGBTQ people queer.\u00a0In an excerpt provided by Coles, Queer Nation wrote:\u00a0\u201cUsing \u2018queer\u2019 is a way of reminding us how we are perceived by the rest of the world \u2026 Yeah, queer can be a rough word but it is also a sly and ironic weapon we can steal from the homophobe\u2019s hands and use against him.\u201d Adopting \u201cqueer\u201d was a sharp political move, too, Coles said: \u201cInstead of treating the concerns of gay men, lesbians, bisexuals, trans folks, and other groups as largely distinct from one another, \u2018queer\u2019 offered a single unifying word that allowed all these people to band together and fight for their shared interests with greater political influence,\u201d Coles said. Academics soon followed Queer Nation\u2019s lead and began to include the term in their work:\u00a0Teresa de\u00a0Lauretis\u00a0organized\u00a0a 1990 conference of queer theorists, and Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick, who helped popularize the term queer studies instead of gay and lesbian studies,\u00a0said\u00a0in a 1993 book\u00a0that within queer there is room for \u201copen mesh of possibilities, gaps, overlaps, dissonances and resonances\u201d in discussions of gender and sexuality.\u201d TV series like \u201cQueer as Folk\u201d and \u201cQueer Eye for the Straight Guy\u201d further exposed the public to a different interpretation of the term \u2014 queer as it was used in those series \u201cstill implied strangeness and difference from the sexual norm, but that strangeness was now a matter of self-conscious pride,\u201d Coles said. In 2016, LGBTQ media advocacy organization\u00a0GLAAD\u00a0formally recommended that media outlets adopt the longer version of the acronym to include the Q, for queer. With its recommendation, LGBTQ eventually superseded LGBT as the acronym\u00a0many\u00a0media outlets used to describe queer people. Why queer is still controversial Despite the prevalence of queer, its use is still a point of contention among LGBTQ people, particularly those from older generations. Larry Kramer, the late playwright and LGBTQ rights activist, famously disliked using the word as an identifier,\u00a0telling an audience\u00a0at Yale University in 2009, \u201cI am not queer! And neither are you. When will we stop using this adolescent and demeaning word to identify ourselves?\u201d For those who didn\u2019t grow up hearing the word used as a slur, its heft might not register, Coles said. But the word may still carry the \u201cweight of decades of trauma\u201d for older generations of LGBTQ activists to whom queer was always an attack on their identity. \u201cIt can be hard to see a word that was used to abuse you widely used and embraced,\u201d said Dr. Lexx, the therapist and sex educator. Disagreement over use of the word queer gives LGBTQ people a chance to reckon with the history of the word and, hopefully, better understand each other, Reddy said. \u201cI identify this way because that\u2019s how I feel,\u201d Reddy said. \u201cAnd a person from a different generation may really dislike or feel uncomfortable about the word queer. That\u2019s an opportunity for us to (question), \u2018why is that? No matter what the reason, how do we respect that and ensure that there\u2019s space for what we\u2019re all feeling at the same time?\u2019\u201d It\u2019s freeing for so many young people to find a term to describe who they are when other identifiers don\u2019t fit the bill, Allen said. But he also hopes that the young people who identify as queer recognize the term\u2019s loaded meaning. \u201cMy hope is that they use the term intentionally and with due recognition to its history,\u201d he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/us/queer-meaning-lgbtq-cec/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/12/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_10_us_akron-ohio-mass-shooting-police-update", "text": "Investigators have identified a 28th victim in a mass shooting at a birthday party in Akron, Ohio, last week that left one person dead, city officials said Monday, as they continue their search for a suspect or suspects. The latest victim was initially believed to be a witness but was in fact grazed by a bullet, Akron Police Chief Brian Harding said at a news conference Monday, eight days after gunfire erupted at the party early on June 2. The 36-year-old woman went to a hospital after the shooting but was referred elsewhere, Harding said, and ultimately did not seek medical treatment. Police continue to follow up on leads, Harding said, telling reporters investigators had received a \u201clarge number of tips.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t have a specific suspect or any of that information that I\u2019m willing to share right now,\u201d Harding said. Police initially said there were 25 victims, including the 27-year-old man who was killed. Last Wednesday, Akron Police updated that figure, announcing in a post on Facebook that 27 individuals were hit by gunfire and identifying the deceased victim as LaTeris Cook. At that time, two victims remained in critical condition, while the other 25 were either stable or had been released from medical care. The shooting is one of at least 208 mass shootings in the US so far this year, according to the Gun Violence Archive, which \u2013 like CNN\u00a0\u2013 defines a mass shooting as one in which four or more people are injured, excluding the shooter or shooters. Police responded shortly after midnight on June 2 to 911 calls reporting shots fired and multiple victims, according to an earlier statement from Harding and Mayor Shammas Malik. The shooting took place at a \u201clarge birthday party\u201d where 200 people had been in attendance, Harding said at a news conference that evening. The scene appeared \u201cconsistent with someone driving by shooting out of a car,\u201d Harding said at the time. Investigators recovered 45 shell casings fired from at least five different guns, the city\u2019s update last Wednesday said, adding three handguns were found at the scene. At least one person returned fire, the update said. Several agencies \u2013 including the ATF and US Marshals \u2013 are offering up to $22,500 in rewards for information related to the case. Also Monday, Mayor Malik announced the city was creating a gun violence response fund aimed at assisting the victims of last week\u2019s shooting and the victims of future shootings. \u201cGun violence is a huge issue in our community and in many cities across the country. It\u2019s something that has been a high priority for me and for our new administration and will continue to be,\u201d he said.

{"id": "2024_06_11_tech_elon-musk-drops-openai-lawsuit", "text": "Lawyers for Elon Musk on Tuesday moved to dismiss the billionaire\u2019s lawsuit against OpenAI and CEO Sam Altman, ending a months-long legal battle between co-founders of the artificial intelligence startup. Musk \u2014 who co-founded OpenAI in 2015 \u2014 sued the company in February, accusing the ChatGPT maker of abandoning its original, nonprofit mission by reserving some of its most advanced AI technology for private customers. The lawsuit had sought a jury trial and for the company, Altman and co-founder and president Greg Brockman to pay back any profit they received from the business. But OpenAI quickly pushed back against Musk\u2019s claims, calling them \u201cincoherent\u201d and \u201cfrivolous\u201d and arguing in a court filing that the case should be dismissed. The company also published a blog post that included several of Musk\u2019s emails from OpenAI\u2019s early days. The emails appeared to show Musk acknowledging the need for the company to make large sums of money to fund the computing resources needed to power its AI ambitions, which stood in contrast to the claims in his lawsuit that OpenAI was wrongly pursuing profit. Musk\u2019s lawyers did not cite a reason for their request to drop the lawsuit in Tuesday\u2019s filing. A hearing regarding OpenAI\u2019s motion to dismiss the case had been scheduled for Wednesday. The move to drop the lawsuit also came one day after Musk fired off a string of posts on his social media platform X criticizing OpenAI and its handling of user data, after Apple announced a partnership that integrates ChatGPT with digital personal assistant Siri for users on an opt-in basis. \u201cIf Apple integrates OpenAI at the OS\ufeff (operating system) level, then Apple devices will be banned at my companies. That is an unacceptable security violation,\u201d Musk said in one post. (Apple said as part of its announcement that user queries sent to ChatGPT will not be stored by OpenAI.) The Musk-OpenAI legal battle represented the diverging visions for how the ChatGPT maker \u2014 which has quickly skyrocketed in value and become the leader in the burgeoning AI space that many see as the future of technology \u2014 should be managed. Musk accused OpenAI of racing to develop powerful \u201cartificial general intelligence\u201d technology to \u201cmaximize profits.\u201d OpenAI, meanwhile, accused Musk of essentially being jealous that he was no longer involved in the startup, after he left OpenAI in 2018 following an unsuccessful bid to convince his fellow co-founders to let Tesla acquire it. But while OpenAI called Musk\u2019s claims \u201ca fiction,\u201d the billionaire is not the only person who has raised questions about OpenAI\u2019s leadership and direction. The company last year faced a high-profile leadership crisis that led to Altman\u2019s temporary ouster from the company, apparently over concerns by several board members about the\u00a0risks of artificial intelligence. After days of uncertainty and an intervention by Microsoft, a major investor in OpenAI, Altman was restored to his position in what industry analysts said was a victory for those seeking to commercialize AI technology. More recently, multiple high-profile OpenAI safety leaders exited the company, with several publicly claiming the company had prioritized quickly rolling out new products over safety. Weeks later, the company said it had established a new committee that would make recommendations to the company\u2019s board about safety and security.
