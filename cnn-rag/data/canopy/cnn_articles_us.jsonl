The 64-year-old was charged with driving while intoxicated, the Suffolk County Police Department announced in a Saturday news release. Police say the suspect was driving a 2020 Chevy Traverse southbound through a parking lot in Commack Road, and continued crossing through Grand Boulevard, where he eventually crashed the vehicle through the front window of Hawaii Nail & Spa just after 4:30 p.m. Four people died during the crash, which took place when the salon was open and conducting business. Nine additional people were transported to local hospitals; eight were transported by ambulance and one was airlifted by helicopter, the police department said in the release. The suspect was transported to a local hospital for non-life-threatening injuries and will be arraigned at a later date, police say. \u201cIt appears a motorist drove through the building, all the way through the building and we don\u2019t know the cause at this time,\u201d Dominic Albanese of the\u00a0Deer Park Fire Department said Friday. The driver of the minivan was partially conscious when first responders arrived on the scene, he said. The nail salon is one of five stores in a small shopping area in Deer Park, Long Island. A series of parking spots face the storefronts, just beyond the sidewalk. Some 150 firefighters and EMS officials were on scene to handle the incident, Albanese said. \u201cThis is very difficult for all the firefighters and EMS personnel on scene and we\u2019ll be meeting with the crisis team this evening, for anybody that needs it, for all departments involved,\u201d Albanese told reporters.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/28/us/long-island-minivan-crash-nail-salon/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_07_01_us_karen-read-murder-trial-deliberations", "text": "A judge declared a mistrial in the murder trial of Karen Read, the Massachusetts woman accused of drunkenly driving into her police officer boyfriend and leaving him to die in January 2022, in a case featuring accusations of a vast police cover-up and investigative misconduct. It was the second time Monday the deadlocked jury told the judge it could not reach a verdict after spending days deliberating Read\u2019s fate. Jurors also said Friday they could not reach a unanimous decision. Read, 45, pleaded not guilty to charges of second-degree murder, vehicular manslaughter while intoxicated, as well as leaving the scene of an accident resulting in death in connection to the 2022 death of John O\u2019Keefe, who was her boyfriend and a Boston police officer. \u201cWe thank the O\u2019Keefe family for their commitment and dedication to this long process,\u201d said Morrisey after the mistrial was announced. \u201cThey maintained sight of the true core of this case \u2013 to find justice for John O\u2019Keefe.\u201d The commonwealth intends to retry the case with a new jury following the mistrial, according to Norfolk District Attorney Michael Morrissey. She could face life in prison if convicted, according to Massachusetts law. Read\u2019s attorney Alan Jackson, meanwhile, said prosecutors in the case had \u201cfailed miserably and they\u2019ll continue to fail,\u201d according to video outside the courthouse provided by CNN affiliate WCVB. \u201cNo matter how long it takes, no matter how long they keep trying, we will not stop fighting,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cFolks, this is what it looks like when you bring false charges against an innocent person.\u201d The Massachusetts judge overseeing the trial gave jurors a so-called \u201cdynamite charge\u201d Monday morning, directing them to continue their deliberations after they indicated for a second time Monday they could not reach a unanimous verdict. The Tuey-Rodriguez charge instructs jurors to reconsider their positions while taking into consideration the opinions of panelists with whom they do not agree. Norfolk County Superior Court Judge Beverly Cannone read the charge around 11 a.m. after jurors sent a note saying, \u201cDespite our commitment to the duty entrusted to us, we find ourselves deeply divided by fundamental differences in our opinions and state of mind.\u201d Jurors had resumed deliberations Monday morning at the judge\u2019s direction, after first saying on Friday they could not reach a unanimous decision. Cannone on Friday asked the jury to continue to deliberate, but decided against reading the Tuey-Rodriguez charge, which case law cautions against providing prematurely. The jury of six men and six women had been considering a verdict since midday June 25, weighing the evidence in a case featuring accusations of a vast police cover-up as well as improper conduct and sexist text messages from a lead investigator. On both Friday and Monday, Norfolk County Assistant District Attorney Adam Lally argued against the judge issuing the Tuey charge, saying the jury had not yet deliberated enough, citing in part the complexity of the case and the high volume of evidence and witness testimony. Defense attorney David Yannetti, meanwhile, urged the judge to issue the charge, saying Monday jurors had now twice indicated they are \u201chopelessly deadlocked.\u201d On Monday, Cannone sided with the defense, telling the court she\u2019d determined the jury had conducted the requisite \u201cdue and thorough deliberation.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve never seen a note like this, with reporting to be at an impasse,\u201d the judge said. If prosecutors seek another trial, they could take a different approach, perhaps bringing a lesser charge than second-degree murder if prosecutors determine their evidence failed to meet the standard required or using different experts or different testimony, trial attorney Misty Marris said. \u201cIt\u2019s a chance to identify what the mistakes or holes in the case might have been,\u201d Marris said. \u201cAnd it does give the defense that advantage, because they know now, especially when you\u2019re able to speak to the jurors after the fact, you learn a lot. You learn a lot about what motivated them.\u201d How the trial went The heart of the trial stemmed from what happened on one wintry evening in Canton, Massachusetts, more than two years ago. On the night of January 28, 2022, Read and O\u2019Keefe went out drinking at two bars with friends. Shortly after midnight, the couple climbed into Read\u2019s SUV and drove to the Canton home of one of O\u2019Keefe\u2019s fellow Boston police officers for an after-party, court documents show. In the morning, O\u2019Keefe\u2019s body was found bruised and battered in the snow outside the home, authorities said. Prosecutors have alleged Read and O\u2019Keefe, who had an at-times tumultuous relationship, got into an argument that night, and that she drunkenly backed into him with a vehicle and fled the scene, leaving him to die in the cold. \u201cWhat the constellation of the facts and the evidence ineluctably demonstrate here is that the defendant drove her vehicle in reverse at 24.2 miles per hour for 62.5 feet, struck Mr. O\u2019Keefe, causing those catastrophic head injuries, leaving him incapacitated and freezing him to death,\u201d prosecutor Lally said in closing arguments Tuesday. In contrast, Read\u2019s defense has accused off-duty police inside the Canton home of fatally beating O\u2019Keefe, dumping his body on the lawn and then conspiring through fabricated evidence and false testimony to frame Read. \u201cLadies and gentlemen, there was a cover-up in this case, plain and simple,\u201d defense attorney Jackson said. \u201cYou\u2019ll surely say to yourself, \u2018I don\u2019t want to believe it, I don\u2019t want to believe that could happen in our community,\u2019 but sadly over these past eight weeks you\u2019ve seen it right before your eyes.\u201d The closing arguments represented the end of a murder trial that has garnered interest both local and widespread, including accusations of witness tampering, a federal probe into the investigation, and groups of pink-wearing supporters chanting to \u201cFree Karen Read.\u201d The prosecution\u2019s case has also been hampered by a series of missteps and unusual investigative practices. Most notably, a lead investigator in the case, Massachusetts State Police Trooper Michael Proctor, admitted he sent a series of sexist and offensive texts about Read in a private group chat, calling her a \u201cwhack job,\u201d mocking her medical issues and commenting to coworkers he had found \u201cno nudes\u201d while searching her phone for evidence, WCVB reported. Proctor apologized for the \u201cunprofessional\u201d comments on the stand, but the vulgar texts have been sharply criticized in and out of court, including from the governor. \u201cIt\u2019s completely unprofessional,\u201d Gov. Maura Healey told WCVB of the texts. \u201cIt does harm, frankly, to the dignity and the integrity of the work of men and women across the state police and law enforcement. So as a former attorney general and as governor, I am disgusted by that.\u201d CNN\u2019s Artemis Moshtaghian, Jennifer Henderson and Zoe Sottile contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/01/us/karen-read-murder-trial-deliberations/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_07_01_us_jeffrey-epstein-grand-jury", "text": "Fort Lauderdale, Florida (AP) \u2014 Florida prosecutors heard graphic testimony about how the late millionaire and financier\u00a0Jeffrey Epstein\u00a0sexually assaulted teenage girls two years before they cut a plea deal, according to transcripts released Monday of the 2006 grand jury investigation. The transcripts were at the center of a court battle for about a decade after media investigations into Epstein\u2019s ties to the rich and the powerful seems to have allowed him to continue to rape and sex traffic teenagers without ever being sent to prison or serving a serious jail term. The judge\u2019s release of the approximately 150 pages came as a surprise as he had scheduled a hearing for next week on when and how to release them. Gov. Ron DeSantis had signed a bill in February allowing the release on Monday or any time thereafter that Circuit Judge Luis Delgado ordered. The transcripts show that the grand jury heard testimony that Epstein, who was then in his 40s, had raped teenage girls as young as 14 at his Palm Beach mansion. The teenagers testified and told detectives they were also paid to find him more girls. \u201cThe details in the record will be outrageous to decent people,\u201d Delgado wrote in his order. \u201cThe testimony taken by the Grand Jury concerns activity ranging from grossly unacceptable to rape \u2014 all of the conduct at issue is sexually deviant, disgusting, and criminal.\u201d After the grand jury investigation, Epstein cut a deal with South Florida federal prosecutors in 2008 that allowed him to escape more severe federal charges and instead plead guilty to state charges of procuring a person under 18 for prostitution and solicitation of prostitution. It\u2019s long been criticized as too lenient. He was sentenced to one and a half years in the Palm Beach County jail system, followed by a year of house arrest. He was required to register as a sex offender. That deal has been widely criticized as too lenient. According to the transcripts, Palm Beach Police Det. Joe Recarey testified in July 2006 that the initial investigation began when a woman reported in March 2005 that her stepdaughter who was in high school at the time said she received $300 in exchange for \u201csexual activity with a man in Palm Beach,\u201d Recarey testified. Another teenager, whose name was redacted in the transcript, told detectives that she was 17 years old when she was approached by a friend who said she could make $200 by providing a massage at Epstein\u2019s home. At the house, the teen was led to a room by an Epstein assistant, and a short time later, Epstein entered and demanded that she remove her clothes. She complied and started the massage. When Epstein tried touching her, she told him she was uncomfortable. Epstein then told her that he would pay her if she brought other \u201cgirls\u201d to his home. She agreed to do so, according to the October 2005 interview with detectives recounted by Recarey. \u201cAnd he told her, \u2018The younger, the better,\u2019\u201d Recarey said. When she brought over a 23-year-old friend, Epstein told her that the friend was too old. Over time, the teen brought six friends from her high school over to Epstein\u2019s home, including a 14-year-old girl, the detective said. The teen, who likened herself to Hollywood Madame Heidi Fleiss to detectives, explained that the girls understood what they were getting into. She received $200 every time she brought over a friend and a rental car paid by Epstein. \u201cThe more you did, the more money you made,\u201d the detective said the teen told him. \u201cShe explained that there was going to be a massage or some possible touching, and you would have to provide the massage either topless or naked.\u201d Epstein in 2018 was charged with federal sex trafficking\u00a0crimes in New York\u00a0\u2014 where he also had a mansion that was a scene of abuse \u2014 after the Miami Herald published a series of articles that renewed public attention on the case, including interviews with some victims who had been pursuing civil lawsuits against him.\u00a0Epstein\u00a0was 66 when\u00a0he killed himself\u00a0in a New York City jail cell in August 2019, federal officials say. Delgado in his order called Epstein \u201cthe most infamous pedophile in American history.\u201d \u201cFor almost 20 years, the story of how Jeffrey Epstein victimized some of Palm Beach County\u2019s most vulnerable has been the subject of much anger and has at times diminished the public\u2019s perception of the criminal justice system,\u201d Delgado wrote. \u201cEpstein is indeed notorious and infamous and is widely reported to have flaunted his wealth while cavorting with politicians, billionaires, and even British Royalty,\u201d he continued. \u201cIt is understandable that given those reports the public has a great curiosity about what was widely reported by news (agencies) as \u2018special treatment\u2019 regarding his prosecution.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/01/us/jeffrey-epstein-grand-jury/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "us"}}

The teenager, identified as Nyah Mway, was approached by three officers Friday night after he and another 13-year-old matched the descriptions of robbery suspects, according to a release from the Utica Police Department. Officers were patrolling the area to assist with two recent robbery investigations where \u201cthe suspects were described as Asian males who brandished a black in color firearm and forcibly demanded and stole property from victims,\u201d the release reads. \u201cBased on the listed identifying factors from the robbery, officers approached Nyah Mway and the other juvenile as they matched the robbery suspects\u2019 descriptions and were in the immediate vicinity of the previous robbery at nearly the same time of day,\u201d it continues. Police also say Nyah Mway was violating New York vehicle and traffic law by walking in the road. According to Utica Police and bodycam footage released, when \u201cthe officers attempted to conduct a citizen stop of the two 13-year-old juveniles\u201d and tried to pat-frisk Nyah Mway, \u201che immediately fled on foot.\u201d While fleeing, police said, Nyah Mway pulled out what appeared to be a handgun but was later found to be a replica Glock pellet gun and pointed it at the police officers. One of the officers discharged his firearm once and shot the teen in the chest \u201cduring a ground struggle,\u201d Utica Police Chief Mark Williams said during a news conference Saturday. He was given \u201cimmediate\u201d first aid by the officers and taken to Wynn Hospital, where he died, according to Williams. The officers involved with the incident were identified by the police department as Patrick Husnay, Bryce Patterson, and Andrew Citriniti. Husnay was the officer who fired his gun and all three are on administrative leave with pay, according to police. CNN has reached out to the Utica Police Benevolent Association for comment. Body camera footage released by police shows chaotic struggle The body camera footage released by police shows one officer saying he needs to pat down the two juveniles to make sure they don\u2019t have any weapons. Nyah Mway immediately flees in the video. Some of the footage was edited to insert a red circle around the replica gun and authorities froze the frames where the teen appears to point it at the officers. The officers believed it was a handgun, police said, but it was later determined to be a replica of a Glock 17 Gen 5 handgun with a detachable magazine, The Associated Press reported. The replica gun carried by the teen \u201cis in all aspects a realistic appearing firearm with Glock markings, signatures, detachable magazine, and serial numbers,\u201d Lt. Michael Curley, a police spokesperson, said via email to The Associated Press. \u201cHowever ultimately it fires only pellets or BB\u2019s.\u201d The police body camera video shows a chaotic scene. In the footage, Nyah Mway appears to point the replica handgun at police while he flees. The officers yell \u201cgun,\u201d and one police officer tackles and punches the teenager. As they are wrestling on the ground, another police officer fires a single shot. Bystanders scream at the police throughout the recordings, and at one point an officer yells back, \u201cWe\u2019re trying to save him right now!\u201d The other youth was detained in the back of a police vehicle and was not involved in the shooting, The Associated Press reported. The police department released the body camera videos following a public outcry as the shooting roiled Utica, a city with a population of 65,000. It is home to more than 4,200 people from Myanmar, according to The Center, a non-profit helping to resettle the refugees, The Associated Press reported. Nyah Mway, who local media reports said was an eighth grader at Donovan Middle School, was identified as a refugee born in Myanmar and a member of the Karen ethnic minority, The Associated Press reported. There are two ongoing, parallel investigations into the incident, according to police: one by the New York State Attorney General, and another by the Utica Police Department\u2019s Professional Standards Unit. Tensions run high during news conference A news conference about the incident ended early Saturday after tensions ran high. The conference was stopped several times after audience members audibly booed and interrupted the police chief and Utica Mayor Michael P. Galime. An interpreter struggled to speak over repeated audience outbursts. Members of the community, including the youth\u2019s family, were in attendance, The Associated Press reported. \u201cI know there\u2019s a lot of emotions in this room and a lot of upset people,\u201d the police chief said. \u201cBut you\u2019re asking us to be transparent \u2013 you\u2019re asking us to be transparent, and when you shout over us, it makes it very difficult to do so.\u201d A small group also staged a protest outside the Utica Police station Saturday night. One protester\u2019s sign reads \u201cJustice for Nyah Mway. Forever 13.\u201d Another protest took place Monday morning, according to CNN affiliate WKTV Galime met for more than two hours with members of the community on Sunday to discuss the shooting. It is \u201cextremely tragic\u201d to see a police stop end like this, the mayor said, adding the city has \u201cworked so hard to make sure we train, we understand, and we are completely objective in how we deal with our community.\u201d \u201cRight now, it feels that possibly the police did something out of anger and out of subjectivity. I know that we are doing everything we can to make sure our police departments and our whole government as whole truly treats everyone through objectivity,\u201d Galime said. During the meeting, community members asked questions and expressed their concerns on topics such as police procedures during stops and racism. \u201cThey would like to change right now, right away, but we understand that\u2019s something that cannot happen right now, right away,\u201d Lupway Doh, a leader of the Karen community, told CNN affiliate WKTV.

{"id": "2024_07_01_politics_joe-biden-immunity-supreme-court", "text": "President Joe Biden on Monday condemned the Supreme Court\u2019s decision which ruled that presidents have an absolute immunity from prosecution for core official acts, and issued a stern warning over a possible second term for former President Donald Trump. \u201cThere are no kings in America. Each, each of us is equal before the law. No one, no one is above the law, not even the president of the United States,\u201d Biden said in a speech from the White House. \u201c(With) today\u2019s Supreme Court decision on presidential immunity, that fundamentally changed. For all practical purposes, there are virtually no limits on what the president can do. It\u2019s a fundamentally new principle and it\u2019s a dangerous precedent because the power of the office will no longer be constrained by the law even including the supreme court of the United States.\u201d The Supreme Court, in a 6-3 decision along ideological lines,\u00a0ruled\u00a0that Trump may claim immunity from criminal prosecution for some of the actions he took as president before leaving office, likely delaying his federal election subversion trial related to his actions on January 6 even further. The\u00a0ruling\u00a0rejects a decision from a federal appeals court in February that found the former president enjoyed no immunity for alleged crimes he committed during his presidency to reverse the 2020 election results. Biden repeatedly warned that the limits of the president\u2019s power now solely rest with the holder of the office and the choices that person makes. He said Trump would be a danger in that role. The notably political speech comes at a critical moment for Biden\u2019s campaign as he tries to beat back persistent concerns about his age exacerbated by his performance in last week\u2019s presidential debate. His unsteady performance wreaked anxiety among some of his top donors and raised uncomfortable questions for Democrats about whether he should remain on their ticket, much less serve another four years in the White House. During Monday\u2019s speech, Biden appeared alert, reading energetically from a teleprompter in the Cross Hall of the White House. But he did not take questions, immediately walking away after his five-minute, scripted statement. On Monday, Biden referenced the January 6, 2021, insurrection at the US Capitol and called it \u201cone of the darkest days in the history of America.\u201d He said the court\u2019s decision has made it unlikely that Trump will face trial for his criminal charges related to that riot before the election. The court\u2019s decision technically allows special counsel Jack Smith to move forward with his election subversion case against Trump, but left many technical questions unresolved \u2013 making it increasingly unlikely that a trial can get underway before the November election. Smith\u2019s case now returns to lower courts, which must review the specific steps Trump took to overturn the results of the 2020 election and whether those actions were official, and therefore receive immunity, or private, and do not. The majority said that Trump\u2019s conversations with the Justice Department \u2013 his efforts to try to get officials on board with his attempt to overturn the election \u2013 were covered with absolute immunity. For other official actions and more routine powers held by the president, the court said there is at least some immunity and it largely deferred to lower courts to sort that out. That\u2019s a process that could take weeks or even months. Perhaps even more important, the majority made clear that official acts cannot be considered at all as evidence in a potential trial, which could make it much harder for Smith to prevail. Chief Justice John Roberts also wrote that the lower courts may not consider a former president\u2019s motive, which may allow Trump\u2019s attorneys to argue that he wasn\u2019t attempting to overturn an election in his favor at all. \u201cI know I will respect the limits of the presidential powers I\u2019ve had for three-and-a-half years, but any president \u2013 including Donald Trump \u2013 will now be free to ignore the law,\u201d Biden said. Biden, who has made protecting democracy a central tenet of his campaign, described the decision as a broader pattern from the Supreme Court in undermining \u201ca wide range of long-established legal principles,\u201d pointing to other decisions on voting rights and civil rights as he implicitly laid out the stakes for the presidential election. He added that voters now hold the ultimate say over holding Trump accountable. \u201cThe American people must decide if they want to entrust \u2026 the presidency to Donald Trump, now knowing that he\u2019ll be even more emboldened to do whatever he pleases whenever he wants to do it.\u201d He added, \u201cI concur with Justice (Sonia) Sotomayor\u2019s dissent today. Here\u2019s what she said \u2013 she said, \u2018In every use of official power, the president is now a king above the law. With fear for our democracy, I dissent,\u2019 end of quote. So should the American people dissent. I dissent.\u201d The Supreme Court\u2019s decision had an instant effect \u2013 Trump\u2019s legal team filed a letter Monday seeking to challenge the former president\u2019s conviction in his New York criminal hush money trial based on the high court\u00a0ruling on presidential immunity, a source told CNN. Trump\u2019s lawyer filed a letter with Judge Juan\u00a0Merchan seeking permission to file a motion to challenge the verdict, the source said. If the judge allows Trump to file the motion it could delay Trump\u2019s sentencing \u2013 set for next week \u2013 to allow the parties to brief the issue. The Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office\u00a0did not file its sentencing submission Monday as expected, according to a source.

Chicken Soup for the Soul Entertainment (CSSE) revealed in a filing that it has nearly $1 billion in debt and owes millions of dollars to several entertainment companies including the BBC and Sony Pictures, plus to retailers ranging from Walmart to Walgreens. Filings show that the company took on about $325 million in debt following its purchase of Redbox in 2022 from private equity giant Apollo Global Management. The plan was to make it into an entertainment conglomerate, combining the DVD rental business with its free streaming services, like Crackle, the entertainment platform once owned by Sony. Those plans didn\u2019t pan out, hindered by dual Hollywood strikes that limited production of fresh content and the decline of people renting physical DVDs that even forced rival Netflix to quit that part of its business last year. CSSE declined to comment. Deadline previously reported that Redbox hadn\u2019t paid employees for a week, and medical benefits have been suspended. Filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy could help the company fix those issues if its plans are approved by a court in Delaware. The company\u2019s publishing arm, which produces those ubiquitous self-help books that were once a worldwide phenomenon, isn\u2019t affected by the bankruptcy filing of its entertainment unit.

{"id": "2024_06_30_us_gay-military-law-biden-pardon", "text": "The predawn silence was shattered by heavy banging on the doors of the US Army barracks in West Germany that morning in May 1988. Mona McGuire and Karla Lehmann were handcuffed, pulled from their barracks, interrogated for hours and eventually kicked out of the Army for admitting to charges of sodomy and an indecent act to avoid a court martial and prison. \u201cI wasn\u2019t going to prison at 19, 20 years old for loving another human being, for loving another female,\u201d McGuire told CNN. In the decades since, McGuire said, she has led \u201can honorable life\u201d while overcoming her emotional scars. She lives\u00a0in a\u00a0Milwaukee\u00a0suburb with her\u00a0two sons\u00a0and\u00a0her wife. She\u00a0has worked at a printing company for the last 35 years. \u201cI was able to recover and strong enough to carry on,\u201d she said. Lehmann retired in 2016 from the Milwaukee Police Department after 26 years on the job and is now a victim advocate for the Michigan State Police. She and McGuire remain friends. \u201cHere I\u2019m sitting with this charge of sodomy and indecent acts on my federal record with the military. But I ended up going to the sensitive crimes division and investigating sexual assaults for half my career,\u201d she told CNN. \u201cI ended up becoming a mentor and a teacher and I taught all over the states on how to conduct those investigations and how to interview people \u2013 which is kind of ironic because my interrogation with the military was brutal.\u201d Now, after President Joe Biden pardoned American veterans who were convicted under a military law that banned gay sex for more than 60 years, McGuire and Lehmann have been left wondering whether the announcement will affect service members, like them, who accepted less than honorable discharges rather than face court martial \u2013 a lasting stain on their military records. Biden, in a statement on Wednesday, said he was \u201crighting an historic wrong\u201d by pardoning service members \u201cwho were convicted simply for being themselves.\u201d \u201cIt just leaves this void and this question mark of, \u2018What\u2019s going to happen for us?\u2019\u201d Lehmann said of the proclamation. Many vets accepted bad discharges to avoid court martial Biden\u2019s proclamation\u00a0will affect roughly 2,000 people, according to a US official.\u00a0The pardon won\u2019t automatically change the record of convicted veterans, but it will allow them to apply for a certificate that will help them receive withheld benefits. \u201cOur nation\u2019s service members stand on the frontlines of freedom, and risk their lives in order to defend our country. Despite their courage and great sacrifice, thousands of LGBTQI+ service members were forced out of the military because of their sexual orientation or gender identity,\u201d Biden said. \u201cThis is about dignity, decency, and ensuring the culture of our Armed Forces reflect the values that make us an exceptional nation.\u201d The pardon specifically grants clemency to service members who were convicted under former Uniform Code of Military Justice Article 125 \u2014\u202f which criminalized sodomy, including between consenting adults\u00a0\u2014\u202fbetween\u00a01951 and 2013 when it was rewritten by Congress. It also applies to those who were convicted of attempting to commit those offenses. A senior administration official told reporters they\u00a0are also\u00a0working to address cases in which LGBTQ+ service members were convicted under other UCMJ charges than Article 125, such as conduct unbecoming an officer. The official said individuals who may have been convicted of other charges \u201cbased on their sexual orientation or gender identity\u201d can go through the normal pardon process at the Department of Justice. What the proclamation means for McGuire and Lehmann is unclear at the moment, but their stories reflect the plight of veterans unfairly targeted for their sexual orientation. \u201cRight now, even with the pardon, the burden of proof and the burden to reach out and go through this process is completely on the veteran and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s fair,\u201d said Christie Bhageloe,\u00a0a pro bono attorney and director of The Veterans Consortium\u2019s discharge upgrade program. \u201cI hold out hope that the White House will work with the Department of Defense and then just make this an automatic or easy process, rather than making veterans jump through more hoops,\u201d said Bhageloe, who is representing McGuire and Lehmann. \u201cI think it\u2019s a step in the right direction just stating out for the world to hear that these veterans did not do anything wrong and they should have that stain from their records removed but, practically, they need to make it easier.\u201d McGuire and Lehmann are among the thousands of service members forced out of the military because of their sexual orientation between the 1950s and 2011, when a law known as \u201cDon\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell\u201d was repealed by Congress. Lt. Col. Ruth Castro, an Army spokesperson, said privacy laws prevented her from commenting on individual cases. And she referred CNN to a new Defense Department website about the pardon application process.  A service member\u2019s discharge status can determine what Veterans Affairs benefits they are eligible for. A bad-conduct discharge, for example, given under general court martial, can make someone\u202fineligible\u202ffor services including a VA home loan, military pension and education benefits. The pardon is separate from the Pentagon\u2019s ongoing review of military records for those who were discharged based on their sexual orientation \u2013 which another US official said did not apply to convictions under the UCMJ. The Pentagon launched a new outreach campaign last September to reach more veterans who believe they \u201csuffered an error or injustice\u201d to have their military records reviewed. To get their records changed under the pardon, veterans will need to complete an online application, which will go to their military service department. The department will review the individual\u2019s court martial and service record and determine if they are eligible for the pardon. That determination will then be sent to the attorney general,\u00a0acting through the Department of Justice\u2019s pardon attorney, a US official explained. The certificate of pardon does not automatically change the discharge status. With a certificate of pardon, the service member will then have to apply to their respective military department\u2019s board of corrections to have their military records corrected. Bhageloe said more clarity is needed on the pardons because the majority of veterans discharged before and during \u201cDon\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell\u201d were not \u201cconvicted\u201d but instead accepted a bad discharge to avoid a court martial and possibly prison. \u2018Embarrassing, humiliating, devastating\u2019 McGuire and Lehmann were stationed with the 164th Military Police Company in West Germany when Army investigators burst into the barracks. They were handcuffed and driven to another base, where they said they were fingerprinted, had mugshots taken and were interrogated separately. After seven or eight hours of what they described as humiliating and offensive questions about their private lives, McGuire and Lehmann said they were forced to confess and accept a discharge \u201cfor the good of the service \u2013 in lieu of trial by court-martial.\u201d \u201cThat decision was forced upon us during that seven- to eight-hour interrogation,\u201d said McGuire, who was following in the footsteps of her father, a military police officer during World War II. He died when she was 7. \u201cI remember hyperventilating, being you know, upset, crying so much that I just couldn\u2019t breathe at that point. My world was crushed. My dream was definitely crushed. My career was crushed. It was embarrassing, humiliating, devastating.\u201d McGuire eventually returned home to Mineola, Texas. Lehmann went home to Wisconsin. \u201cI\u2019m coming home to a new me, a newfound, you know, part of myself that I don\u2019t know very well, and I\u2019m outed and I\u2019m ashamed,\u201d said Lehmann, whose grandfather was a World War II veteran.  \u201cI\u2019m embarrassed that I got discharged. I don\u2019t know what it means for my future as a police officer. And it was just really, really challenging to navigate telling family and friends\u2026 I avoided people. I did not want to share my story.\u201d Apologies for \u2018ruining your military career\u2019 In January 2018, McGuire and Lehmann finally learned who had outed them. Lehmann had received a copy of a Facebook message that a woman who had been stationed with them originally sent to another soldier. Lehmann immediately texted a copy to McGuire. \u201cI just wanted to say how sorry I am!!! I had a pretty sheltered life growing up. I was never around (people) of a different race or around gays or lesbians,\u201d the message read. \u201cI was a terrible friend to you \u2026 I\u2019ve always wanted to find you guys and apologize for ruining your military career.\u201d The woman wrote that her own military career ended not long after McGuire and Lehmann were kicked out of the Army. \u201cSorry to say I\u2019m not 100% lesbian. But I am bi. I miss you\u2026 Again I am so very sorry and hope you will forgive me,\u201d she wrote in the message, which mentioned McGuire and Lehmann by name. In 2022, McGuire filled out the paperwork in a bid to upgrade her discharge, which she described as \u201cthe most traumatic event in her life,\u201d according to a record of the proceeding with the Army Board for Correction of Military Records. She wrote about her love for the country and the \u201chumiliation\u201d she has felt. She described \u201cfeeling worthless and alone\u201d and falling into a deep depression that for a time stripped away her self-confidence. \u201cTo date, she has dreams of being in the Army, dreaming she re-enlisted and was allowed to serve her country,\u201d the document said. \u201cShe awakes and realizes it was a dream and the overwhelming sadness is again felt.\u201d McGuire received a response from the Department of the Army in a letter dated August 2, 2023: \u201cI regret to inform you that the Army Board for Correction of Military Records denied your application.\u201d The denial letter said the board concluded in part there was \u201cinsufficient evidence to support the applicant had condition or experience that mitigated her misconduct.\u201d It also cited insufficient evidence that she suffered from depression after her discharge and of her \u201cpost-service honorable conduct.\u201d McGuire, the letter said, admitted guilt to the charges and \u201cvoluntarily requested discharge \u2026 for the good of the service \u2013 in lieu of trial by court-martial.\u201d \u201cAfter the seven to eight hours of brutal, intense interrogation and telling us we\u2019re going to prison, we finally broke down and gave in,\u201d McGuire told CNN. Bhageloe said she is appealing McGuire\u2019s denial for a discharge upgrade and helping prepare Lehmann\u2019s application for an upgrade. \u201cI feel like this is the time. I am hopeful that something positive will come of this,\u201d McGuire said of America\u2019s latest attempt to right what Biden\u2019s proclamation called a \u201chistorical injustice.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/30/us/gay-military-law-biden-pardon/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_07_01_politics_democrats-down-ballot-debate-fallout-biden", "text": "Pennsylvania Sen. Bob Casey, a Democrat whose seat is crucial to maintaining his party\u2019s slim Senate majority in November, faced a new attack ad Sunday from GOP challenger Dave McCormick\u2019s campaign \u2014 one that Republicans across the country could emulate. Casey, the McCormick ad claims, knew of President Joe Biden\u2019s status, and stood by the president anyway. The 35-second video features clips of Democratic operatives lamenting Biden\u2019s poor debate performance against former President Donald Trump last week \u2014 and then features Casey publicly proclaiming that Biden is up for the job if he wins a second term. It ends with text across the screen: \u201cWhen will Casey finally tell the truth?\u201d Casey, campaigning in Scranton on Monday, stood by Biden. \u201cHe had a bad night and debate, but I think people know what\u2019s at stake,\u201d he told reporters. The McCormick video was an early glimpse at a new strategy House and Senate Republican groups have started to deploy as the consequences of the president\u2019s shaky debate performance ripple through House, Senate and governor\u2019s races across the country. Republicans are eager to turn the 81-year-old president\u2019s struggles into an anvil, while Democrats gingerly navigate the most precarious moment to date in their bid to maintain control of the Senate and flip the GOP\u2019s slim House majority this fall. In the aftermath of Biden\u2019s Thursday night debacle, Democratic members of Congress have largely stood behind the president in public. That could change \u2013 very quickly \u2013 if post-debate polling and research show that Biden\u2019s debate fallout is likely to cost Democrats the House come November. \u201cThe firewall is Congress. We need to have one of the bodies,\u201d a Democratic congressman, who only agreed to speak anonymously, told CNN. This lawmaker said he and his colleagues would feel compelled to speak out \u2013 in a way they have not so far \u2013 and call on Biden to drop out if data comes out that shows: \u201cShit, he\u2019s not just going to lose the presidency, but he\u2019s going to lose the House.\u201d As CNN has reported, Biden and his team have been collecting and awaiting data \u2013 both anecdotal and public polling \u2013 as well as bracing for a broader round of Democratic campaign polling and research to get a clearer sense of the post-debate damage. If the dam is still holding among Democratic lawmakers who have declined to publicly call on Biden to leave the race, then privately, elected officials \u2013 everyone from leadership to the rank-and-file members of Congress \u2013 are actively discussing a range of \u201cwhat ifs\u201d, sources said. CNN reached out to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, the House Democrats\u2019 campaign arm, for comment. In private chats, lawmakers are discussing familiar Democratic names like Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, California Gov. Gavin Newsom and others as possible replacements for Biden. They are also intensely sensitive about outright dismissing Vice President Kamala Harris, and the anger that the scenario of passing over the country\u2019s first Black female vice president would unleash. Those floated prospects have been sensitive about being seen as publicly nudging Biden to exit the 2024 race. Whitmer on Monday pushed back on a Politico report that she\u2019d told Biden campaign co-chair Jen O\u2019Malley Dillon that Biden could no longer win Michigan \u2014 a must-win swing state for Democrats. \u201cAnyone who claims I would say that we can\u2019t win Michigan is full of shit,\u201d Whitmer said on X. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, a two-term Democrat in a deep-red state whose name is also in the mix of potential replacements and future presidential contenders, told reporters in his home state Monday that Biden\u2019s performance in the debate was \u201crough\u201d \u2013 but insisted that he still backed the president. \u201cIt was a very bad night for the president,\u201d Beshear said. \u201cBut he is still the candidate. Only he can make decisions about his future candidacy. So as long as he continues to be in the race, I support him.\u201d Republicans on the attack The National Republican Senatorial Committee posted a video on social media interspersing endangered Democratic incumbents\u2019 comments supporting Biden with some of the president\u2019s worst moments in the debate. \u201cDemocrats 2024: Don\u2019t believe your lying eyes,\u201d the Senate GOP campaign arm said in a post accompanying the video. Jack Pandol, the communications director for the National Republican Congressional Committee, said in a memo Monday that the House GOP\u2019s campaign arm\u00a0is preparing to take aim at Democrats \u201cfor gaslighting their own voters and refusing to take responsibility for the crisis the country now finds itself in.\u201d The NRCC dispatched trackers \u2014 staffers who record video of lawmakers and candidates and sometimes pose their own questions \u2014 to the US Capitol complex and airports in Washington and endangered Democrats\u2019 home districts to pose questions about Biden\u2019s fitness. Pandol\u2019s memo also highlighted the House\u2019s partisan vote last month to hold Attorney General Merrick Garland in contempt of Congress for refusing to turn over the audio recordings of Biden\u2019s interviews with former special counsel Robert Hur, who investigated Biden\u2019s handling of classified material and declined to bring charges. \u201cThe NRCC can weaponize these votes in paid advertisements, mail, digital, and earned media to pin Democrats to a conspiracy to protect a President Americans do not believe should be serving another term,\u201d Pandol said in the memo. What Democrats are saying Democratic leaders have broadly stood by Biden in the wake of the last week\u2019s\u00a0debate. However, some down-ballot Democrats have been more critical. On Capitol Hill last Friday, some Democrats expressed alarm about Biden\u2019s struggle to deliver clear answers in the debate. \u201cJoe Biden couldn\u2019t communicate, and Donald Trump lied every time he opened his mouth,\u201d Minnesota Rep. Angie Craig said. Illinois Rep. Brad Schneider said \u201cyeah\u201d when asked if he was keeping the door open to replacing Biden as the Democratic nominee. California Rep. Scott Peters called conversations about replacing Biden \u201cpremature,\u201d but said he is \u201copen to a conversation about how to win this election.\u201d \u201cI think everyone is concerned about last night,\u201d Peters told CNN. \u201cSo the campaign has got to convince a lot of people that this is a campaign we win.\u201d O\u2019Malley\u00a0Dillon\u00a0sought to reassure party leaders and staff on multiple calls Monday morning as the campaign continues to manage the fallout from the president\u2019s poor debate performance last week. One person who was on the calls told CNN that O\u2019Malley\u00a0Dillon\u00a0sought to be \u201creassuring,\u201d and summarized her overarching message as: \u201cThis will pass, but we have to do our work.\u201d She also stressed that \u201cit\u2019s our job to keep everyone calm,\u201d according to the person. Some of the Monday morning calls that O\u2019Malley\u00a0Dillon\u00a0led featured Democratic leaders and staff working for the DNC and the convention, the person said, and were previously scheduled. Participants were able to speak up if they chose to. Some top Democratic officials and supporters close to the White House have balked at the tone and language that some campaign officials have taken as part of their defense. In particular, the decision by the campaign to refer to those who have called on Biden to drop out as \u201cthe bedwetting brigade\u201d has fueled anger and dismay. One senior Democratic official told CNN that tone was \u201cdisrespectful.\u201d Another top Democrat in close touch with the White House said it was \u201cdisgusting.\u201d Multiple people taking issue with language like \u201cbedwetting\u201d told CNN that the tone is dismissive and wholly unappreciative of the very serious and widespread concerns inside the Democratic Party about whether Biden is fit to seek and carry out a second term. In one fundraising email over the weekend sent under the name of deputy campaign manager Rob Flaherty, the campaign acknowledged the widespread panic that Biden\u2019s debate performance had caused. \u201cIf you\u2019re like me, you\u2019re getting lots of texts or calls from folks about the state of the race after Thursday. Maybe it was your panicked aunt, your MAGA uncle, or some self-important Podcasters,\u201d the email started. Later, the message said: \u201cThe\u00a0bedwetting\u00a0brigade is calling for Joe Biden to \u2018drop out.\u2019 That is the best possible way for Donald Trump to win and us to lose.\u201d Biden\u2019s campaign on Monday launched a minute-long ad using remarks the president made in Raleigh, North Carolina, last Friday \u2014 part of an attempt to recast the debate between an aging but honest incumbent and a dishonest Trump. \u201cFolks, I know I\u2019m not a young man,\u201d Biden says in the portion of his speech used in the ad. \u201cBut I know how to do this job. I know right from wrong. I know how to tell the truth.\u201d It\u2019s a message Democrats quickly latched onto as Biden and his family gathered at Camp David and his campaign seeks to minimize the damage among donors and Democratic allies. Pennsylvania Rep. Madeleine Dean said Monday on CNN that Biden had \u201ca bad 90 minutes. I don\u2019t sugarcoat that.\u201d \u201cBut we have had a bad nine years since June 16, 2015, when Donald Trump came down the escalator,\u201d she said, referring to the launch of Trump\u2019s first presidential run.

{"id": "2024_06_30_us_uvalde-school-shooting-police-indictments", "text": "More than two years after the massacre at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde left 19 children and 2 teachers dead, a grand jury indicted two former Uvalde school police officers in the botched law enforcement response to the 2022 mass shooting. Former Uvalde Consolidated Independent School District Police Chief Pete Arredondo and former school police officer Adrian Gonzales were named in the indictments, which represent the first criminal charges filed in the school shooting. The victims\u2019 families, who have been fighting for years in search of answers as to why the shooter was left for 77 minutes \u2013 with dead, dying and traumatized victims \u2013 before he was stopped, are still shattered, heartbroken and grieving. \u201cWe still drown in sadness, there\u2019s still a whole lot of anger because these men have walked around for the last two years, one month and four days, walking around like they didn\u2019t do anything wrong,\u201d Brett Cross, the uncle and guardian of victim Uziyah Garcia, 10, told CNN. Arredondo and Gonzales were among the 376 law enforcement officers who arrived at the school, and it took them more than an hour to confront and kill the teenage shooter from the time he entered the school through an unlocked door. The response to the attack\u00a0has been denounced as an \u201cabject failure\u201d with\u00a0enough blame to be spread widely. Families are now struggling with mixed emotions. The indictments provided a small measure of hope in their quest for accountability but with only two officers facing charges, they said it is far from enough. \u201cI think these indictments, taking these officers off of the streets so they\u2019re never in the position to put others in danger again, that\u2019s a win for the community, for Texas,\u201d Kimberly Mata-Rubio, the mother of victim Lexi Rubio, 10, told CNN. \u201cAs for the families of victims, nothing will ever change what happened. What we want most we can\u2019t have, we want our children and those two teachers back.\u201d What\u2019s next? Here are answers to some of the biggest questions. Who was indicted? What were the charges? Former Uvalde Consolidated Independent School District Police Chief Pete Arredondo\u00a0surrendered to the custody of the Texas Rangers in Uvalde Thursday, an official with the Texas Department of Public Safety told CNN. The former chief was booked on 10 felony charges of child endangerment with known criminal negligence for failing to recognize the incident as an active shooting and for failing to take proper action to intervene, the indictment said. According to the filing, the behaviors placed each of the 10 children listed in \u201cimminent danger of bodily injury, death, physical impairment and mental impairment.\u201d Arredondo was hired by the school district in March 2020 and fired in August 2022 for his role in the highly scrutinized law enforcement response on May 24, 2022. For more than two years, Arredondo\u2019s actions on the day of the shooting have been under scrutiny from the families of victims and survivors, the Uvalde community and in several investigative reports, including one released this year by the U.S. Department of Justice. Arredondo\u2019s lawyer has not responded to CNN\u2019s request for comment. Former school police officer Adrian Gonzales posted bail Friday and was released after being charged with 29 counts of abandoning and endangering a child, the Uvalde County Sheriff said in a news release. Gonzales, who was hired by the school district in July 2021, left the department in February 2023. No specific reason was given for Gonzales\u2019 departure, according to the Uvalde News Leader. Gonzales was booked into the Uvalde County Jail early Friday afternoon, the Uvalde Leader-News reported, citing Uvalde County Sheriff\u2019s Office Chief Deputy Brandon McCutchen. Jail records show both Arredondo and Gonzales were released on $10,000 bond. What do the indictments say about the officers? The indictment listed Gonzales as one of the responders to the scene, something Mata-Rubio said she did not previously know. \u201cAs far as Adrian, it was not a name that was on my\u00a0radar, and I was unaware of the details of his part on that date,\u201d said Mata-Rubio. \u201cTwenty-one people could have gone home that day had Adrian Gonzales done his job.\u201d \u201cAfter hearing gun shots and after being advised of the general location of the shooter and having time to respond to the shooter, the said Adrian Gonzales failed to engage, distract or delay the shooter to attempt to engage, distract and delay the shooter, and failed to otherwise act in a way to impede the shooter until after the shooter entered rooms 111 and 112 of Robb Elementary School and shot at a child or children in Rooms 111 and 112,\u201d the indictment states, with the allegation repeated for each of\u00a0the\u00a019 children killed and 10 surviving children. The indictment also said Gonzales failed to \u201cfollow his active shooter training\u201d in his response. \u201cMr. Gonzales\u2019 position is he did not violate school district policy or state law,\u201d defense attorney Nico LaHood told CNN Friday. \u201cThe application of this statute, to law enforcement, under these circumstances is unprecedented in the state of Texas. It will take time to evaluate these allegations and the underlying facts.\u201d The indictment also alleges Arredondo \u201cfailed to respond as trained to an active shooter incident\u201d and delayed the response by law enforcement to stop the gunman \u201cwho was hunting and shooting\u201d children inside the classroom. Are more indictments expected? The Uvalde County District Attorney\u2019s office is not planning to file any more indictments in the botched response to the shooting, according to family members who have spoken to District Attorney Christina Mitchell. Mata-Rubio and Cross told CNN they were informed by Mitchell there would be no further indictments coming out of the grand jury. The district attorney\u2019s office did not respond to CNN\u2019s multiple requests for comment. \u201cI\u2019m glad two people are indicted,\u201d Mata-Rubio told CNN Friday. \u201cIt\u2019s not justice until there are convictions. But I am also aware that there were others at fault that day, and it\u2019s hard to accept that they will not face any consequences.\u201d \u201cI would be lying if I didn\u2019t say I feel like that\u2019s not enough,\u201d Cross told CNN. \u201cAlthough to be perfectly honest, it will never be enough, because even if all 376 officers get charged, my son\u2019s still not here.\u201d What has been the reaction from local officials and police? The Uvalde Police Department released a statement on Facebook saying they are aware of the news regarding the two indictments. \u201cOur administration has not been contacted by the District Attorney\u2019s Office regarding any of our staff and we don\u2019t have any comment at this time regarding the matter,\u201d their statement read. \u201cWe have no other information on the matter outside of what has been reported.\u201d The Uvalde Consolidated Independent School District offered its condolences to the families of the victims Friday, saying it had no further information to add. \u201cAs with the rest of the Uvalde community, we have only just learned about the grand jury decision regarding two indictments being issued,\u201d school district spokeswoman Anne Marie Espinoza said in a statement. How about the reaction from families? Mata-Rubio, wearing a blue shirt reading \u201cI\u2019m not a regular mom, I\u2019m Lexi\u2019s mom,\u201d said she was \u201cglad\u201d to hear about the indictments but was frustrated state police, or the Texas Department of Public Safety, were not included in the indictments. \u201cWhen they go to a scene, they know they\u2019re in charge, they know that they could have taken over. They chose not to and this was the result,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cThere\u2019s the part of me that is Lexi\u2019s mom as a grieving mother that will never understand any of this. Then there\u2019s the logical part of me that realizes that in order to get justice, some sort of justice, this is the route the DA had to go.\u201d State Sen. Roland Gutierrez also told CNN Thursday he believes the Texas Department of Public Safety bears substantial responsibility for the failed law enforcement response and should have been included in the indictments. Nikki Cross, Brett Cross\u2019 wife and the guardian of victim Uziyah Garcia, said she is disappointed the acting City of Uvalde Police Chief Mariano Pargas was not included in the indictments. \u201cUnfortunately, cowardness is just not against the law apparently, even if you have a badge,\u201d Cross said. \u201cI do just hope maybe after these two officers and all testimony is out there, maybe we can come back to charges against him.\u201d CNN has reached out to the Texas Department of Public Safety and Pargas for comment. Both Nikki and Brett Cross are trying to remain optimistic about the outcome of the expected trials but hope officials stay on top of the case and do not \u201clet this just fall through because it\u2019s the state of Texas and they back the blue.\u201d \u201cThis isn\u2019t a matter of \u2018Oh, we ride the thin blue line\u2019 or \u2018We need to respect cops because they put lives on the line.\u2019 They showed us that not all cops put their lives on the line and when they actively chose to put their lives above our children when they signed up to serve and protect, you negate everything at that point,\u201d Brett Cross said. Oscar Orona, father of survivor Noah Orona, now 12, said while he was pleasantly surprised by the indictments, his top priority continues to be the health of his son, who was shot in the massacre. \u201cToday was a big day, don\u2019t get me wrong and I\u2019m not trying to minimize that,\u201d Orona said. \u201cBut in the end, our foremost goal is our son\u2019s well-being now, tomorrow, and years to come because that\u2019s gonna be the true battle right there.\u201d Jesse Rizo, the uncle of one of the students killed, Jacklyn Cazares, 9, echoed the other parents in their hopes more law enforcement officials would be facing with criminal charges, he told CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s the beginning of something, right?\u201d Rizo said. \u201cBut in order to bring closure, you would want all the officers that didn\u2019t do their job that day, that failed to respond appropriately, you would want them to be held accountable in an equal way.\u201d Will they be tried separately? It is not yet clear if Arredondo or Gonzales will be tried separately or together. Where will the trials be held? Families who spoke with the district attorney told CNN Mitchell will not push for a change of venue in this case and intends to hold the trial in Uvalde. Victim Uziyah Garcia\u2019s guardians, Nikki and Brett Cross, voiced their apprehension and said they have little confidence with the trial being held in Uvalde due to the negative response they have received from some community members. \u201cThis is the same community that has driven by when we\u2019ve been doing sit-outs telling us to die,\u201d Brett Cross told CNN. \u201cSame community that blames us, that tells us to move on, that tells us that we\u2019re wrong, this is the same community that shows up for a superintendent who didn\u2019t do anything but won\u2019t show up when 19 children and two teachers are killed.\u201d Do we know when the trials start? Right now, there\u2019s no date set for Arredondo or Gonzales\u2019 first court appearances, an official with the Uvalde County District Court clerk\u2019s office said. Brett Cross said the district attorney indicated it could be months or even up to a year before the case goes to trial because of the amount of evidence and investigative material to be handed over to the defense. \u201cNow that they\u2019ve been indicted, you know, their lawyers will have a chance to go through evidence and everything and we saw that it took this long for the prosecution to go through evidence,\u201d Cross said. \u201cSo I\u2019m expecting a lengthy time where the defense goes through it.\u201d What type of punishment do the former police officers face? Each defendant could face jail time of six months to two years and a fine of up to $10,000 for each count, according to state sentencing guidelines. What\u2019s next for grieving families? The world will never be the same for the families and friends of the children and teachers who were murdered. Although nothing can bring them back or fill the holes they left behind, their loved ones said they will not stop fighting for them, regardless of how the trials go. \u201cThere\u2019s more than one avenue for justice and accountability. If we\u2019re able to change laws that save lives, then that\u2019s even more justice for Uziyah,\u201d Brett Cross said. Many of the families have become outspoken advocates for gun reform, demanding their state enact sensible gun laws to prevent similar future tragedies. \u201cI want to see convictions, at the local level also at the state level and at the federal level, calling for gun reform through work at LivesRobbed, I\u2019m never going to stop fighting for her, for all the children.\u201d Mata-Rubio said. \u201cEarly on I stood at the downtown plaza and I said that what I wanted is my daughter, and if I can\u2019t have that, then those who failed her will never know peace and I stand by that.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/30/us/uvalde-school-shooting-police-indictments/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_07_01_politics_trump-challenge-hush-money-verdict-immunity-supreme-court", "text": "Donald\u00a0Trump\u2019s legal team filed a letter Monday seeking to challenge the former president\u2019s conviction in his New York criminal hush money trial based on the US Supreme Court ruling on presidential immunity, a source told CNN. Just hours after the high court ruling, Trump\u2019s lawyer filed a letter with Judge Juan\u00a0Merchan seeking permission to file a motion to challenge the verdict, the source said. If the judge allows Trump to file the motion it could delay Trump\u2019s sentencing \u2013 set for next week \u2013 to allow the parties to brief the issue. The longshot bid to challenge Trump\u2019s New York conviction follows the Supreme Court decision that presidents have an absolute immunity\u00a0from prosecution for core official acts. It comes as the 2024 Republican presumptive presidential nominee seeks to avoid other pre-election trials in the three most significant criminal prosecutions he faces. In the letter, Trump\u2019s legal team cited the Supreme Court\u2019s decision and suggested postponing his sentencing next week, a source familiar with the effort told CNN. The former president\u2019s lawyers argued that the ruling confirmed their position that Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg should not have been allowed to offer evidence at the trial regarding Trump\u2019s \u201cofficial acts\u201d and, as a result, the jury\u2019s guilty verdict should be set aside. The Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office\u00a0did not file its sentencing submission Monday as expected, according to a separate source. The district attorney\u2019s office declined to comment on the letter Monday night. The Supreme Court, in the 6-3 decision that split along ideological lines, ruled that Trump may claim immunity from criminal prosecution for some of the actions he took as president before leaving office, likely delaying cases \u2013 like his federal election subversion trial related to his actions on January 6, 2021 \u2013 even further. Trump became the first former US president to be convicted of a felony in May when the Manhattan jury found him guilty of all 34 counts of falsifying business records\u00a0in his\u00a0hush money criminal trial. Trump\u2019s sentence is up to the judge, and it could include prison time or probation. Merchan set that sentencing hearing for July 11.

{"id": "2024_06_25_us_las-vegas-shootings", "text": "An overnight manhunt for a gunman sought in the deaths of five people in North Las Vegas ended Tuesday morning after police located him just before he killed himself. Eric Adams, 47, was identified by police as a suspect in two shootings on Monday night, according to a news release from the North Las Vegas Police Department. Five people were killed and a 13-year-old girl was hospitalized in critical condition with a gunshot wound after the shooting spree at two apartments. The shooting started when an argument broke out between the suspect and his ex-girlfriend while he was visiting her apartment, police said Thursday in an updated news release. Around 10 p.m. on Monday, police received reports of a shooting at an apartment complex on Casa Norte Drive, the release said. When they arrived, police located two adult females \u2013 one in her early 40s and another in her late 50s \u2013 with gunshot wounds. They were later pronounced dead by medical personnel, according to police. \u201cThe two got into a domestic-related argument, during which Adams armed himself with a gun and shot two other women in the apartment,\u201d the Thursday news release said. Police later located a third victim, a 13-year-old female, who also had a gunshot wound and remains in critical condition at UMC Trauma Center as of Thursday, police told CNN in an email. Three more victims were with gunshot wounds were found at another apartment in the same complex, police said Thursday \u2013 Adams\u2019 ex-girlfriend\u2019s 24-year-old daughter and her 22-year-old friend, along with a 20-year-old man. All three were pronounced dead at the scene, police said. The 20-year-old victim, who was an upstairs neighbor, heard the commotion and decided to check on the women to see if he could help, police said. Adams then shot him when he arrived at the apartment, police said. At that point, the suspect went upstairs and shot three people who were inside that apartment, including a 59-year-old woman, a 40-year-old woman and the teenage girl, police said. Two other people were inside the apartment but were left unharmed. Police then identified Adams as a suspect and the manhunt began overnight. After the shootings, Adams took his ex-girlfriend hostage and fled the area, police said. At some point in the early hours of Tuesday morning, the ex-girlfriend escaped unharmed and found a nearby Las Vegas Metropolitan Police officer to ask for help. Police searched throughout the night for Adams until around 10 a.m. on Tuesday, when they received a tip that he was at a business on East Lake Mead Boulevard. When police arrived at that area, Adams fled to the backyard of a nearby residence. \u201cOfficers began giving Adams verbal commands to drop the firearm, however, Adams ignored those commands and died by suicide,\u201d the release says. Police are continuing their investigation into the incident. \u201cThe surviving victims and their families are being assisted by the North Las Vegas Police Department, victim advocates and detectives, to help them through this difficult time,\u201d police said Thursday.

{"id": "2024_06_27_us_minneapolis-juror-bribery-indictment", "text": "Federal charges have been filed against five people linked to a recent attempt to\u00a0bribe a juror\u00a0to help secure a not guilty verdict in a trial over a $250 million fraud scheme that exploited a federally funded child nutrition program, the US attorney in Minnesota announced in a news conference Wednesday. The juror, identified only as \u201cJuror 52,\u201d immediately called 911 to report the attempt after a gift bag containing $120,000 in cash was dropped off at her front door earlier this month, FBI Special Agent\u00a0Travis Wilmer said in an affidavit filed June 3 in federal court. Three of those charged this week, Abdimajid Nur, Abdiaziz Farah and Said Farah, were defendants in the fraud trial connected to Feeding Our Future, a nonprofit organization prosecutors say was used to skim nearly $250 million from federal child nutrition programs. Juror 52, who is not accused of any wrongdoing, was dismissed from the case and replaced with an alternate. Nur and Abdiaziz Farah were convicted of wire fraud, bribery, money laundering, conspriacy and other crimes, while Said Farah was acquitted, according to a Justice Department news release and agency spokesperson Tasha Zerna. Court documents state Juror 52 was targeted \u201cbecause she was the youngest juror and they believed her to be the only juror of color.\u201d Included with the alleged bribery money was a document described by US Attorney Andrew Luger as \u201cchilling.\u201d The document laid out instructions for the juror to follow with arguments for her to use to sway other jurors, the indictment states. Those arguments focus on an assertion of prejudice by the government based on the defendants\u2019 immigration status and race, according to the indictment. Luger said the note inside the gift bag also included a clear message to the juror that read, \u201cYou alone can end this case.\u201d Nur recruited Ladan Ali, a woman who \u201cattempted to follow\u201d the juror home after the first day of closing arguments and two days later dropped off the gift bag containing the bribery money at the juror\u2019s house and gave it to a relative, the indictment says. Said Farah allegedly provided the funds. Another defendant, Abdulkarim Farah, accompanied Ali and videotaped her dropping off the money, according to the indictment.\u00a0Abdiaziz Farah, Said Farah and Abdulkarim Farah are brothers. CNN has reached out to attorneys for all five defendants for comment. The\u00a0charges they face\u00a0include bribery of a juror, conspiracy to bribe a juror and corruptly influencing a juror. When the\u00a0alleged\u00a0bribery attempt was announced in court, all defendants in the trial were ordered to turn their phones in to authorities. Abdiaziz Farah engaged a factory reset\u00a0in an attempt to wipe\u00a0all the data from his device, according to court documents.\u00a0He also faces a count of obstruction of justice connected to that allegation. Recovered videos from the phones of the defendants include recordings of the bribe money being dropped off at Juror 52\u2019s home, according to the indictment. \u201cThey took the video to ensure that the money was delivered and as evidence to show Juror 52\u2019s complicity if she accepted the bribe but did not follow through with a not guilty verdict,\u201d the indictment states. Days later, a search warrant was served at Abdiaziz Farah\u2019s home, and among the items found by investigators was a list of all the jurors\u2019\u00a0names hidden inside a water bottle,\u00a0a DOJ warrant shows. Fingerprints from the bag of money led investigators to Ladan\u00a0Ali,\u00a0Luger said.\u00a0During Wednesday\u2019s news conference, Luger shared surveillance images he says show Ali in a rental car following\u00a0Juror\u00a052 home from court. \u201cThis is more than just a mob movie. This is a chilling attack on our system of justice,\u201d he added. \u201cThey studied her, followed her and determined that she would succumb to their scheme. The fact that they failed does not lessen the magnitude of what they tried to do,\u201d said Luger. \u201cFortunately for all of us, Juror 52 could not be bought, and she terminated their scheme.\u201d \u201cThe sophistication and intentionality of this plot cannot be overstated,\u201d said Luger, adding Juror 52\u2019s movements were tracked night and day. The three Farah brothers are scheduled to make their initial appearances on the charges in federal court Thursday afternoon. Ladan Ali is expected to turn herself in later this week, and Abdimajid Nur is set to appear in court next week, according to Zerna.

The Nassau County Sheriff\u2019s Office Marine Unit found the victim with a critical injury when they responded to the shark attack at about 11:15 a.m. local time, the\u00a0sheriff\u2019s office said in a social media post. The shark bit the man\u2019s forearm and he was losing blood, authorities said. \u201cActing swiftly, a deputy boarded the vessel and applied a tourniquet to stop the bleeding,\u201d the sheriff\u2019s office said. \u201cThe deputy then piloted the boat to the Dee Dee Bartels boat ramp, where Fernandina Beach Fire Rescue was waiting.\u201d The man was then airlifted to a local hospital for treatment. While he is in critical condition, he is expected to recover, the sheriff\u2019s office said. The incident comes after two separate shark attacks within just 90 minutes of each other left three people injured at neighboring Walton County, Florida, beaches earlier this month. Shark activity is typically at its peak in Florida waters between April and October, according to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. \u201cYet shark bites still remain very rare,\u201d the commission said. \u201cHumans are 30 times more likely to be struck by lightning in Florida than to be bitten by a shark. Experts agree that the increase in the number of shark bites in recent years is more related to an increase in human visitors than to an increase in shark populations or activity.\u201d In Florida, shark bites are fatal less than 1% of the time, according to the commission. \u201cExperts believe that most shark bites are cases of mistaken identity, which explains why nearly all shark bites that occur in Florida waters are of a bite-and-release nature,\u201d the commission said. While the risk of being bitten by a shark is extremely low, Florida tops global charts for the number of shark bites, according to the Florida Museum of Natural History\u2019s annual shark attack\u00a0report. In 2023, Florida had 16 unprovoked shark bite incidents reported, which represents 44% of the United States total and 23% worldwide. Volusia County had the most shark bites, and the others were reported in Brevard, St. Lucie, Miami-Dade, Palm Beach, Escambia and Pinellas counties. There were no fatalities reported last year in the state as a result of the attacks.

The officers were part of a Corrections Emergency Response Team (CERT), which are specially trained units designed to deal with violent prison situations, at the Jefferson City Correctional Center. A former inmate at the correctional center tells CNN he witnessed\u00a0officers create\u00a0the violent circumstances that killed the 39-year-old Moore, whose 2023 death forms part of an especially deadly year in Missouri prisons. \u201cI never watched anybody die before,\u201d Jordan Seller, 27, told CNN, as he explained the events leading to Moore\u2019s death began with what was supposed to be a routine search of the cells on the maximum-security prison block he shared with Moore. \u201cThey come in like a hundred deep, you know, and that\u2019s barely an exaggeration, you know, they try to come in and pull everybody out as fast as they can, search cells fast as they can and get out,\u201d Seller said. He and his cellmate had already been pulled out and put back in their cell when they noticed the commotion building around Moore\u2019s cell, Seller says. \u201cThe cell was surrounded by CO\u2019s,\u201d or corrections officers, Seller said and that Moore was pleading with them he had a medical lay-in and needed to be put in two pairs of handcuffs, essentially latched together with the outside rings on the wrist to ease tension on the shoulders being pulled back. Seller said they\u2019re commonly used for bigger inmates or those who may have trouble putting their hands behind their backs. Seller says the correctional officers refused to listen to Moore and began treating him as if he was non-compliant. The officers proceeded to pepper spray Moore, slam him to the ground and force him into a single pair of handcuffs, he says. \u201cHe can\u2019t see. He\u2019s spitting out mace, he\u2019s coughing, he can\u2019t breathe and he\u2019s telling them \u2018I\u2019m allergic to mace, you need to hurry up and get medical here,\u2019\u201d Seller said. Seller says he was looking up at the commotion from his cell on the lower floor of the prison block before Moore was brought down the stairs closer to him in a \u201creal aggressive\u201d manner. The correctional officers placed Moore\u00a0in \u201csome kind of chair-like contraption,\u201d according to Seller,\u00a0which the county prosecuting attorney has said was a restraint chair, sometimes used in corrections facilities. Seller says the prison guards began to place a spit mask on Moore, but Seller maintained he was only spitting out mace. \u201cOf course, he\u2019s refusing this because there\u2019s no reason for them to put a spit mask on,\u201d said Seller, who also says he witnessed this a few feet from his cell door. \u201cHe don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on. He can\u2019t see, you know, so they\u2019re grabbing on him trying to put something on his head. He\u2019s fighting it. Well, then they started shocking him with the shock glove.\u201d Seller then recounted what he believes were Moore\u2019s final moments, when the officers pulled out what appeared to be \u201can all-black motorcycle helmet, you know, darkened mask, all that,\u201d and put it on Moore\u2019s head. \u201cImmediately he\u2019s jumping, hopping, and you can hear him screaming, you know, \u2018Help! I can\u2019t breathe. I can\u2019t breathe, take it off. I can\u2019t breathe. I\u2019m, I\u2019m allergic to mace. I need help.\u2019 And then it gets worse and worse,\u201d Seller said. \u201cHe\u2019s jumping up and down shaking. And, you know, slowly, his screams are getting weaker and weaker,\u201d Seller said. \u201cI believe I watched him die before they even took him out the wing,\u201d he said. \u201cI watched the people that are supposed to be protecting me, kill somebody, literally killed them, you know? And that brought on such a fear, you know? The realization that these people can kill me and there\u2019s nothing I can do about it,\u201d said Seller. Moore was declared dead that day. What the indictment says When the arrests were made Friday, Cole County Prosecuting Attorney Locke Thompson largely corroborated to CNN Seller\u2019s eyewitness account of what happened to Moore, including the use of a \u201cspit mask and padded helmet.\u201d During a contraband sweep of the prison, Moore \u201cwas pepper sprayed twice during the operation before being placed in a spit hood, leg wrap, and restraint chair and transferred to a separate housing unit, where he was left in the hood, wrap, and restraint chair for approximately thirty minutes,\u201d the prosecutor said in a statement. Thompson said, \u201cMultiple witnesses heard Moore pleading with the corrections staff and telling them that he could not breathe\u201d before he was transferred to the prison hospital wing and pronounced dead. A statement of probable cause against the charged officers describing the incident said Moore \u201cshowed no aggression to any members of the CERT team during this process and was on video being compliant,\u201d and that Moore \u201cmade no threats to anyone.\u201d The use of a \u201cshock glove\u201d on Moore, as Seller described to CNN, was not mentioned by the prosecutor. Former corrections officers Justin Leggins, Jacob Case, Aaron Brown, Gregory Varner and Bryanne Bradshaw were all charged in this case. Leggins and Case were charged with second-degree murder and second-degree assault, in part for \u201crecklessly\u201d causing physical injury to Moore by pepper-spraying him in the face, according to court documents. Brown was charged with second-degree murder, and assault in the second degree, for \u201crecklessly\u201d causing serious physical injury to Moore by \u201cplacing a mask\u201d over Moore\u2019s face, which \u201cinhibited\u201d his ability to breathe, according to a joint felony complaint against the officers. Varner was charged with second-degree murder and assault in the second degree for \u201crecklessly\u201d causing \u201cserious physical injury\u201d to Moore by leaving him \u201cin a position which caused his asphyxiation,\u201d the complaint said. Bradshaw was charged with involuntary manslaughter in the second degree and is accused of negligently causing Moore\u2019s death by leaving him in a position that caused \u201casphyxiation,\u201d the complaint alleges. CNN has attempted to identify attorneys for each of the former officers arrested but has not been able to make contact. An initial appearance in front of a judge is expected for these former officers on Monday, the county\u2019s prosecuting attorney told CNN. In response to the murder charges, the Missouri Department of Corrections said in a statement it \u201chas discontinued use of the restraint system in which Moore was held.\u201d Additionally, the statement said the department has begun using body-worn cameras in maximum-security prisons, starting with Jefferson City Correctional Center, to \u201cbolster both security and accountability.\u201d It also said 10 people involved in the incident have been terminated following internal and independent law enforcement investigations, including the five officers charged. The corrections department previously confirmed that the warden of the prison at the time of Moore\u2019s killing, Doris Falkenrath, was no longer with the department. Falkenrath was not among those arrested and not listed on the indictments filed Friday. Following the indictment, Othel Moore\u2019s family filed a federal civil lawsuit against the officers, the prison warden at the time of the killing and the previous director of the Missouri Department of Corrections, alleging, in part, that Moore is dead \u201cbecause of the actions, inactions, conscious disregard, willful and wanton, and depraved behavior\u201d of the then corrections officers. The suit also alleges the \u201cattack\u201d was not an isolated incident but the \u201cmanifestation of a barbarous pattern and practice, fostered by the highest-ranking members of the Missouri Department of Corrections.\u201d A spokesperson for the Missouri Department of Corrections told CNN the department won\u2019t comment on pending litigation. Attorneys Andrew M. Stroth and Steven Hart are among those representing Moore\u2019s family. In remarks to the press Friday following the announcement of the charges, Stroth said, \u201cThese charges are historic. These charges are unprecedented. When you hear about what happened, witnesses saw what happened, video evidence shows what happened. It\u2019s George Floyd 3.0 in a prison. Othel Moore, like George Floyd, was beaten. Othel was actually pepper sprayed, they put a spit mask on his face, they put him in the prone position face down. They shocked him with shock gloves. The entire time before his death was screaming. \u2018I can\u2019t breathe.\u2019\u201d Stroth told CNN: \u201cI\u2019ve reviewed hundreds of police cases, prison cases, this is one of the most egregious cases I have ever seen.\u201d \u2018We want transparency and accountability\u2019 It\u2019s also part of a worsening trend in the Missouri prison system. From 2012 to 2019, the average number of deaths, which includes natural deaths, hovered around 99 per year, according to state data obtained by CNN through a Missouri Sunshine Law request. From 2020 to 2023, the average number of deaths then climbed to 128 per year, a near 30 percent jump. There were fewer people incarcerated in Missouri in 2023 than at any time since at least 2012, according to state data. However, it was the prison system\u2019s deadliest year over that time period. Last year saw 137 prison deaths, with Othel Moore among them. Lori Curry, founder and executive director of the non-profit advocacy group Missouri Prison Reform, told CNN her group is regularly in touch with around 900 inmates, or \u201cresidents of prisons,\u201d as Curry described them, to use more humanizing language. Her organization also tracks deaths reported in prisons and based on the data they provided to CNN, \u201cwhat (the state) refer to as natural deaths\u201d was the most frequent listing as manner of death in their numbers over 2022 and 2023. However, Curry cast doubt on the state listings and attributes the rise in the number of deaths in recent years to \u201cdeclining healthcare, an increase in drugs and overdoses, and an increase of staffing shortages,\u201d she told CNN. She said her advocacy group quickly learned about the disturbing circumstances around Moore\u2019s killing. \u201cPeople in prisons notified us about the situation immediately,\u201d Curry said. She also believes\u00a0\u201cthe Department of Corrections needs to be more forthcoming\u201d about the information around this and that if lawyers, family and others were not so vocal about the case it would not have stayed in the spotlight. Curry founded Missouri Prison Reform in 2019 after launching an anonymous Twitter account where she reported stories relayed to her by inmates. Many years and many stories later, \u201cI\u2019ve been appalled at the things that have gone on in [Missouri] prisons,\u201d she told CNN. \u201cWe want transparency and accountability from our department of corrections,\u201d she added. Seller, who has seen the dynamic between guards and inmates up close, says he wants the same thing. \u201cI see police officers out here wearing body cameras all the time, you know, and it\u2019s required for their stops, arrests, all that. And I believe that\u2019s the only solution for the way that inmates are getting treated is that the CO\u2019s are required to wear body cameras,\u201d Seller told CNN. \u201cYou can\u2019t trust the people that are supposed to protect you,\u201d he said. \u201cThis has become such a big pandemic. I mean, I\u2019m calling it a pandemic, you know, and it\u2019s severe and it\u2019s a big problem.\u201d Seller was serving a six-year sentence after pleading guilty to second-degree rape in 2018, according to court records. State registry records also show the victim in that case was a minor. Seller did his time at a few prisons before being released from the Jefferson City Correctional Center in March. \u201cI did a lot of good for myself in there, a lot of soul searching,\u201d Seller said. He told CNN his reason for coming forward was simple: \u201cIt\u2019s something that\u2019s wrong, that needs to be addressed. Something needs to change,\u201d he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/30/us/missouri-prison-guards-othel-moore-death/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_07_01_business_adjustable-rate-mortgages-higher-payments", "text": "Last year, when Jennifer Hernandez received notice that the mortgage payments on her Houston home would jump about $2,000 per month, she was stunned. Hernandez refinanced her home loan in 2016 using an adjustable-rate mortgage loan, which has a low introductory rate for a fixed initial period. Unlike the more popular fixed-rate mortgage loans, ARMs can offer temporary relief for homebuyers who want to avoid paying higher mortgage rates \u2014 however, they also come with risk. After the fixed introductory period \u00ad\u2014 usually five, seven or ten years \u00ad\u2014 the rate on an ARM loan adjusts periodically based on current market conditions. That means when mortgage rates increase, many ARM loan holders, like Hernandez, experience the unpleasant shock of significantly higher monthly home payments. For thousands of Americans like Hernandez who took out ARM loans five years ago, before interest rates shot up to a four-decade high, that shock is coming this year. Mortgage rates have remained elevated, adding fuel to one of the most unaffordable housing markets in decades. That led ARMs to gain traction despite their drawbacks. According to data from Intercontinental Exchange, a global provider of technology and data, 1.7 million homeowners have bought homes with adjustable-rate mortgages since 2019. Many buyers who bought 5-year ARMs \u2013 one of the more popular offerings \u2013 will graduate into significantly higher monthly payments this year. The fixed period for these ARMs has already reset for 328,000 homeowners \u2013 and 102,000 more loans will reset over the next 12 months, according to ICE. ARM loans gained a bad reputation after the subprime mortgage crisis of 2007 and 2008, after many homebuyers could no longer afford to make their monthly home payments when their rates reset. While the rate of homebuyers choosing ARMs never rebounded to pre-2008 levels, the share of homebuyers using ARM loans has doubled over the past four years, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. Is an adjustable rate a good idea? An ARM may make sense for homebuyers comfortable with the risk of interest rate increases or those who plan to move or refinance before the fixed rate expires, Lorriane Jones, a loan consultant in Southern California, told CNN. But when opting for an ARM, it\u2019s key to keep a close eye on the details, otherwise things can turn difficult, fast. Hernandez, who is herself a loan officer, had misremembered the terms of her $1.1 million loan: rather than a 10/1 ARM, which has a fixed rate for the first ten years and resets every year after that, Hernandez had taken out a 7/1 loan. \u201cI just got caught blindsided,\u201d she said. \u201cLife gets in the way, and you get busy. I\u2019ve been slammed with kids and work for the last seven years.\u201d Last October, Hernandez\u2019s mortgage rate jumped by 2% to 5.125%, the maximum allowed in the first adjustment year, according to her loan terms. Most ARM loans come with an interest rate cap to prevent costs from spiraling out of control. Hernandez said her ARM is capped at 8.125%, five percentage points above her initial fixed rate. To Hernandez, it made little sense to refinance the loan while the 30-year fixed mortgage rate remains higher than her new adjusted rate. But this coming October, she suspects her monthly payments will adjust higher. \u201cI\u2019ve made it work, but now I\u2019m going to have to figure out how to make it work again this October,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s stressful having to worry about it.\u201d Andrew Marquis, a loan officer in Lexington, Massachusetts, said he has recently seen a dramatic increase in ARM loan applications. Homebuyers increasingly believe that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in the next few years, giving these buyers time to refinance their loans before the clock on the fixed period of their ARM runs out, he said. The Fed doesn\u2019t directly set mortgage rates, but its actions influence them. This year, the Federal Reserve has signaled that it may possibly cut its benchmark interest rate one time. \u201cI would say on the jumbo loans we\u2019re doing, probably 40% of the loans are doing ARMs,\u201d Marquis said, referring to loan amounts above $766,000. Marquis said that taking out an ARM loan might be worthwhile for those with a higher risk appetite. \u201cIf people can save a half a percent on a seven-year ARM versus a 30-year fixed, they\u2019re saving hundreds of dollars a month,\u201d he said. Interest rates can be unpredictable. Hernandez said she saved money in the initial seven years of her loan, but if she could have a do-over, she likely would not have chosen an adjustable-rate mortgage in 2016. \u201cThis increase in payments hasn\u2019t felt good,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m just praying that when my October adjustment comes around, rates have come down a little bit.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/01/business/adjustable-rate-mortgages-higher-payments/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "us_new-york-12-year-old-college-trnd", "text": "Recent high school graduate Suborno Isaac Bari, 12, plans to start studying math and physics at New York University in the fall, but he\u2019s already got his ambitious sights set on beginning a doctoral program. \u201cI hope to graduate college at 14 in spring 2026,\u201d said Suborno, who recently became the youngest graduate from his Long Island high school. \u201cIf I ever decide to do a second Ph.D., it will be in physics, but mainly I want to focus on math,\u201d he told CNN. The gifted tween, who memorized the periodic table at 2 years old and has taught lectures at colleges in India since he was 7, graduated on Wednesday from Malverne High School in Nassau County, New York. Suborno, who says he skipped to 12th grade after completing ninth grade studies, became the youngest-ever student to graduate from the high school, CNN affiliate WABC-TV reported. His high school uses a 100-point GPA scale rather than a 4.0 scale, says Suborno, who shared he earned around a 96 GPA for his first year of high school and a 98 for his second and final year. Once he began the 12th grade, Suborno took on nondegree classes at several universities around New York including NYU, Stony Brook University, the City University of New York and Brooklyn College. \u201cThat was a whole new challenge for me,\u201d he shared. \u201cYou\u2019ve got much more homework, much longer classes, (many) more new subjects and material and it\u2019s all condensed into a far shorter time than in school.\u201d The bright young student, whose family says he\u2019s also skilled in painting, debate and playing the piano, could also be making history at NYU when he begins pursuing his bachelor of science degree. A university spokesperson informed the Bari family \u201cwithout NYU undertaking a complete review of its records, NYU is unaware of anyone younger than Suborno being admitted,\u201d according to a copy of an email shared with CNN. Suborno was introduced to education early on by his parents, Rashidul and Shaheda Bari. His father Rashidul teaches physics at Brooklyn Technical High school and his mother Shaheda is an elementary school teacher. They noticed their youngest son was exceptionally bright in 2014 as they taught him basic math, according to Rashidul Bari. \u201cMy wife was actually his teacher at the time. One day \u2026 she was teaching him one plus one, and he would be responding, \u2018Mom, one plus one is two,\u2019\u201d Rashidul Bari said. \u201cAnd then Mom would go, \u2018then what is one plus two?\u2019 And then he\u2019d say \u2018three,\u2019 and then he\u2019d be questioning Mom, \u2018if one plus one is two, can you please tell me, what is n plus n?\u2019\u201d The questions took Shaheda Bari by surprise, her husband says. Rashidul Bari says he at first paid it no mind because his eldest son, Refath Bari, 21, who attends Brown University, was also smart. \u201cSo I told my wife, \u2018OK, there is nothing surprising here, he probably did it to capture attention,\u2019\u201d Rashidul Bari said. \u201cBut it kept happening. Every math concept, he started abstracting.\u201d Suborno\u2019s dad, who was a math student at the time, shared the fascinating discovery with one of his professors. \u201cMy professor said, \u2018no way, a 2-year-old cannot do that abstraction. You should pay serious attention,\u2019\u201d Rashidul Bari said. Suborno continued attracting attention, which eventually led to him getting invited to take college-level courses, his dad said. In 2016, then-President Barack Obama sent Suborno a letter praising the bright student for his hard work and accomplishments. The family shared a copy of the letter with CNN. In 2020 when he was 7, Suborno began receiving invitations from colleges in India to teach, which he does three times a year, his dad says. \u201cThat gives him lots of chances to have conversations with different levels of expertise, students, faculties, college presidents, so many people,\u201d Rashidul Bari said. The family says they were told by Mensa he must wait until he\u2019s 14 years old \u2013 around the time Suborno says he plans to graduate from NYU \u2013 to have his IQ tested. Suborno plans to continue his family\u2019s trend of teaching by one day becoming a math and physics professor. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely insane,\u201d he said about starting at NYU in the fall. \u201cI can\u2019t wait for all the opportunities I\u2019ll have, I\u2019ll be able to meet people who are actually interested \u2026 fully in math and science, and people who are also majoring in math and physics and who want to find out these mysteries behind the universe.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/us/new-york-12-year-old-college-trnd/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "us"}}

The new tower will be built in Jeddah and developed in tandem with Dar Global, the international arm of Saudi mega-developer Dar Al Arkan. If completed, it appears the Jeddah tower would be the Trump Organization\u2019s first major project in Saudi Arabia. \u201cWe are thrilled to expand our footprint in the Middle East and bring the Trump standard of luxury to the region through our long-standing relationship with Dar Global,\u201d Eric Trump, executive vice president of the Trump Organization and son of former president Donald Trump, said in the announcement. Dar Global said the project will target the \u201cluxury Saudi Arabian market and international investors.\u201d The new project in Saudi Arabia comes just days after the Trump Organization and Dar Global unveiled a $500 million Trump International hotel complex in Oman. That five-star hotel complex, set to open in December 2028, would include a nightclub, golf course and members-only club. Dar Al Arkan has agreed to use the Trump name and logo under license for that hotel, which is not owned by the Trump Organization. The Trump Organization\u2019s new projects in the Middle East could raise concerns about potential conflicts of interest should former President Donald Trump return to the White House. \u201cThe Trump Organization\u2019s continued pursuit of foreign business projects raises perilous national security, corruption and constitutional concerns,\u201d Donald K. Sherman, senior vice president and chief counsel at the Citizens for Responsibility & Ethics in Washington (CREW), told CNN in a statement. \u201cThis is particularly true of their development in Saudi Arabia, whose government has a long history of apparently seeking to influence Donald Trump,\u201d Sherman added. \u201cIf Trump were to return to the presidency, he would likely violate the Foreign Emoluments Clause of the Constitution, as he did repeatedly in his first term in office.\u201d A 2023 analysis by CREW found that Trump made at least $9.6 million from countries in the Middle East during his presidency. The Trump Organization is owned by a private trust that lists the former president as the sole beneficiary. The family business is run by his sons Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump. Last year, the Trump Organization was fined $1.6 million by a New York judge for running a decade-long tax fraud scheme. Two Trump entities were convicted of 17 felonies, including tax fraud and falsifying business records. The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The investment firm run by Jared Kushner, the former president\u2019s son-in-law who helped advise on foreign policy during the Trump administration, reportedly secured a $2 billion investment from the Saudi royal fund. Last month, Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, launched an investigation into Kushner\u2019s firm and its ties to Saudi Arabia and other Middle Eastern governments. Wyden expressed concern that the investments in Kushner\u2019s firm could create \u201csignificant conflicts of interest and potential counterintelligence risks.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/01/business/trump-tower-saudi-arabia/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "us"}}

On Monday, Gill said in a Securities and Exchange filing that he purchased about 9 million Chewy shares (CHWY), amounting to a 6.6% stake in the company. Chewy shares closed 6.6% lower on Monday after jumping as much as 10% earlier in the session. Chewy shares began gaining last Thursday after Gill, the individual investor who helped spark the frenzied trading around GameStop shares three years ago, posted a photo of a cartoon dog on his X account. The cartoon\u2019s blue background appeared to be the same blue as Chewy\u2019s logo. Shares of the company surged more than 34% that day at its highs before closing 0.3% lower. Meme stocks more typically move on social media sentiment than fundamentals, often posting huge swings based on the buying and selling of influential traders like Gill.

Gill revived the meme stock frenzy in May after breaking a three-year social media hiatus to post a cartoon on X.

They argue that the programs\u00a0particularly disadvantage White\u00a0and Asian\u00a0Americans, by preventing them from obtaining the jobs, funding or opportunities that these programs offer to\u00a0other racial groups. Some lawsuits invoke the Equal Protection Clause of the\u00a014th\u00a0amendment\u00a0which was ratified after slavery was abolished and says no state may \u201cdeny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\u201d The amendment was notably cited in Justice Clarence Thomas\u2019\u00a0concurring opinion\u00a0in the landmark affirmative action ruling,\u00a0who described it as a \u201ccrowning accomplishment\u201d of Congress. Thomas\u00a0argued that the 14th\u00a0Amendment \u201censures racial equality with no textual reference to race whatsoever.\u201d \u201cIn the wake of the Civil War, the Framers of the Fourteenth Amendment charted a way out: a colorblind Constitution that requires the government to, at long last, put aside its citizens\u2019 skin color and focus on their individual achievements,\u201d he wrote. But some historians argue that the history of centuries of slavery and racism that ultimately led to the ratification of the 14thamendment is often lost in the conversations around\u00a0affirmative action. The amendment, they say, was never intended to be colorblind. Why was the 14th amendment passed? The 14th\u00a0amendment was ratified on July 9, 1868, to grant citizenship and equal protection of the law to anyone\u00a0\u201cborn\u00a0or naturalized\u00a0in the United States,\u201d\u00a0including formerly enslaved Black people. At the time, the passage of the amendment was necessary because millions of Black people were newly freed and their legal and civil rights had not been established. Eric\u00a0Foner,\u00a0a\u00a0historian and professor at Columbia University who specializes in the\u00a0Civil War, Reconstruction and slavery, said the 14th amendment enabled Black people to legally enjoy freedoms such as getting an education, owning land and riding street cars. Foner\u00a0also said the amendment was created to ensure that programs specifically for newly freed Black Americans were able to continue. One example, he said, was the\u00a0Freedman\u2019s Bureau, which was established in 1865 to provide aid such as food, clothing and medical services to formerly enslaved people. \u201cCertainly, this notion of equal protection of the law was both a general principal applied to everybody and a particular justification for assistance to Black people,\u201d\u00a0Foner\u00a0said. \u201cYou have to look at the broad historical context.\u201d But even after the amendment was ratified,\u00a0Jim\u00a0Crow\u00a0laws, segregation and racial violence prevented Black Americans from gaining equality. Some racial disparities persist today and now, more\u00a0than\u00a0150 years later, the same amendment that paved the way for programs that help many Black people is being used\u00a0as justification\u00a0to\u00a0dismantle them. How is it being interpreted in today\u2019s legal challenges? The 14th\u00a0amendment has been cited in several lawsuits filed by conservative groups challenging the constitutionality of programs specifically for people of color. Some of these legal challenges\u00a0successfully forced\u00a0defendants to open their programs to people of all races, either voluntarily or\u00a0through a court order. Earlier this year, legal strategist Edward Blum,\u00a0through his legal advocacy group the American Alliance for Equal Rights,\u00a0sued\u00a0the\u00a0director of the Smithsonian\u2019s National Museum of the American Latino and the director of the Institute of Museum and Library Services over an\u00a0internship program that was open only to Latino applicants,\u00a0saying it\u00a0violated the\u00a0US\u00a0Constitution. The\u00a0complaint\u00a0cited both the 14th\u00a0amendment and\u00a0the\u00a0Fifth\u00a0amendment while arguing that the internship program violated the right of\u00a0\u201cAmericans, like Plaintiff\u2019s members,\u201d to equal protection under\u00a0the law. When asked for comment about the settlement,\u00a0David Coronado, a spokesperson for the National Museum of the American Latino said in an email to CNN,\u00a0said the museum has now added language\u00a0to the program\u2019s website and scoring rubric\u00a0that\u00a0\u201cspells out what had been our practice already,\u201d\u00a0CNN previously reported. \u201cThe National Museum of the American Latino reaffirmed its longstanding commitment to equal opportunity for all internship applicants, regardless of race or ethnicity,\u201d Coronado said.\u00a0 In a statement to CNN this week, Blum said the 14th\u00a0amendment\u2019s equal protection clause \u201chas been interpreted to mean that individual Americans should never be treated differently because of their race.\u201d Blum said, in his view, \u201cany program or policy such as college admissions, fellowships, internships, grants, financial aid and employment that excludes someone because of their race is usually in violation of the 14th\u00a0Amendment.\u201d The\u00a0museum\u00a0settled with Blum\u00a0in March\u00a0and\u00a0now states\u00a0its internship program\u00a0is \u201cequally open\u00a0to students of all races and ethnicities.\u201d The 14th\u00a0amendment was also invoked in a\u00a0recent lawsuit\u00a0filed by\u00a0the conservative group\u00a0Judicial Watch against the city of Evanston, Illinois over a reparations program for Black residents\u00a0meant to correct past discriminatory housing practices.\u00a0Under the program, Black residents who lived in the city between 1919 and 1969 \u2013 as well as their direct descendants \u2013 can apply for up to $25,000 in housing assistance or a direct cash payment,\u00a0CNN previously reported. But\u00a0the lawsuit,\u00a0filed on behalf of six people whose parents or grandparents lived in Evanston during the outlined time period but do not identify as Black,\u00a0argues that solely limiting the cash payment to eligible Black Americans \u201cviolates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution\u201d because \u201cEvanston is discriminating against each member on the basis of the member\u2019s race.\u201d Tom Fitton, president of Judicial Watch, said the reparations program is a \u201cbrazen violation\u201d of the 14th\u00a0amendment. \u201cYou get equal protection of the law under our constitution irrespective of your race,\u201d Fitton told CNN in an interview earlier this month. \u201cThere are no exceptions for denying people equal protection of the law.\u201d Why are there clashing interpretations? David Blight, a history and African American studies professor at Yale University, said he believes the 14th\u00a0amendment was written in a way that leaves it open to different interpretations. Blight said while it was initially ratified to help formerly enslaved Black people,\u00a0the language in the amendment is vague. It\u2019s also unclear how it should be enforced, Blight said. This has allowed conservatives today to use it to their advantage in legal challenges against race-based programs, he said. \u201cThe 14th\u00a0amendment is, without any question, malleable,\u201d Blight said. \u201cIt can be twisted and used all kinds of ways and that\u2019s what has happened with affirmative action.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/29/us/conservatives-14th-amendment-challenge-race-based-programs/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "us"}}

They\u2019ve even survived five mass extinctions, including the asteroid that wiped out 75% of life on the planet. But many species of these aquatic apex predators are now in danger of dying out forever.  \u201cSharks are in crisis globally,\u201d says the WWF. Overfishing (hunting for their meat, fins, and other parts before they can reproduce fast enough) is their biggest threat along with unintentionally getting caught in fishing gear and the effects of climate change.  Of the thousand known species of sharks and rays (sharks\u2019 closest living relatives), over a third of them are at risk of extinction. And since sharks are \u201cindicators of ocean health,\u201d as sharks go, so does the delicate balance of marine ecosystems.  Shark research From gathering data to educating the public to advocating for underwater life, many conservation groups are on a mission to protect these prehistoric creatures before they are lost to history.  Research is key to conservation. Scientists rely on this information to inform wildlife and habitat management and conservation plans while advocates use data to develop and recommend policy to public officials. This research can also be used for public safety purposes as well as to educate future generations that will inherit the planet. Often conducted in remote and dangerous environments, shark research requires time and money. But that work is paying off as researchers continually identify new species of sharks, such as those that can walk on the ocean floor and glow in the dark. These research-oriented organizations are exploring the world\u2019s reefs, seas, coastlines, and oceans to ultimately benefit shark conservation:   Shark conservation  Unfortunately for sharks, NOAA says, \u201cWhat makes them unique also makes them vulnerable.\u201d Some species of sharks, like great whites, are slow to reproduce: they can take decades to reach breeding age, have pregnancies last up to three years, and produce small litters. And warming waters are shifting some of their migration patterns beyond protected areas, putting them at risk of fishing. All of it is hurting their numbers. A 2021 report showed over the last 50 years, global shark and ray populations have fallen more than 70%.  \u201cIf we don\u2019t do anything, it will be too late,\u201d says biologist and study co-author Nick Dulvy. \u201cIt\u2019s much worse than other animal populations we\u2019ve been looking at,\u201d adding the downward trend for sharks is even steeper than those for elephants and rhinos, which are \u201ciconic in driving conservation efforts on land.\u201d While the study found we may approach a \u201cpoint of no return,\u201d there are encouraging signs that conservation efforts are starting to work for white sharks and hammerheads thanks to government bans, policies, and quotas.  There is still a long way to go, however, so many conservation organizations like these are dedicated to rescuing and protecting these vulnerable creatures:  Protecting the ocean   It\u2019s not just sharks that are vulnerable to deteriorating conditions in the water \u2013 the entire marine ecosystem is at risk due to unsustainable fishing practices, climate change, and pollution, which has reached \u201cunprecedented\u201d levels within the last 20 years.  The Great Pacific Garbage Patch, the largest concentration of ocean plastic in the world, is now twice the size of Texas. Scientists are seeing the highest ocean surface temperatures on record this year along with a \u201ctotally unprecedented\u201d marine heat wave in the north Atlantic Ocean. Researchers warn all coral reefs on Earth could die out by the end of the century.  Experts say it\u2019s not too late to reverse course, but the window to do so is shrinking. A report in the journal Nature found marine wildlife to be \u201cremarkably resilient\u201d and could recover by 2050 with urgent and widespread conservation interventions.

{"id": "2024_06_29_us_jonathan-fielding-utah-rebecca-journal-cec", "text": " Two days after Jonathan Fielding fell to his death while taking photos from a scenic overlook in southern Utah, his older sister Rebecca found herself sitting on the same ledge where he had lost his footing. It was January 29. She had driven some 15 hours from her home in Missouri, where they had grown up. Wracked with grief, Rebecca Fielding said she was in a \u201creally dark place.\u201d Jonathan was her best friend, and while she sometimes doubted others\u2019 love for her, she never questioned his. She said she\u2019d journeyed to Utah to take her own life. Rebecca said she was planning to leave a journal at the site with her last words when the clouds parted and sunlight embraced her. \u201cI felt the sun on my back, and it felt like someone was giving me a hug,\u201d Rebecca said. \u201cAnd in that moment, things just felt the teeniest bit better, and it didn\u2019t feel as much like the end of the world.\u201d So, Rebecca left the leather-bound journal and a pen with a note about her brother explaining \u201cwhat the world lost\u201d with him gone. She also left a bag of Takis chips, a Spiderman plushie she had bought at a gas station and some tiny plastic babies \u2014 an inside joke between her and her family. She then drove back to Missouri \u2014 with no expectations for what was to come. \u201cMy goal was just to tell people what happened \u2026 It bothered me that my entire world had imploded at that spot and no one visiting would have any idea,\u201d she told CNN. \u201cI never expected strangers to feel so connected to a dead person they never heard of.\u201d A \u2018Grand Canyon sized mark on the world\u2019 Jonathan Fielding had moved to Orem, Utah, about six months before his death. Originally from Blue Springs, Missouri, he\u00a0loved photography and exploring nature. So the red-rock landscape of southern Utah was an ideal place for him to spend time while on breaks from his sales job. On January 27, Jonathan and several friends were visiting Moonscape Overlook, a remote ridge east of Capitol Reef National Park that offers panoramic views of the surrounding desert. Jonathan was taking photos when a cliff he stepped on crumbled and he fell more than 200 feet to his death. He was 19. Rebecca said that while Jonathan was passionate about photography, he didn\u2019t share his photos much with her. She didn\u2019t discover his new photography website until after his death. Parts of the site remain unfinished. After his death Rebecca looked through her brother\u2019s cameras and found photos Jonathan had taken the day he fell. They include striking images from\u00a0the Moonscape Overlook, its otherworldly vistas\u00a0illuminated by the afternoon sun. \u201cJonathan saw beauty everywhere he went,\u201d she wrote in a TikTok post. \u201cWhile he might not be the subject of the photos he took just moments before his death, he is in every one of them.\u201d Rebecca said she grew up gay in a religious environment and lives with autism and depression. For her, Jonathan was the only person she was comfortable letting see her at her \u201cabsolute worst,\u201d and that \u201che never once judged me for it.\u201d In her grief, Rebecca left a note in the journal she left at the site of her brother\u2019s fall: \u201cJonathan Fielding 5/5/2004 - 1/27/24, a soul too pure for this world, a kid too fearless for his own good, a friend whose kindness knew no bounds,\u201d she wrote on the first page, \u201cA son who could never disappoint, a brother whose love knew no limit. A person who left a Grand Canyon sized mark on this world.\u201d The journal received a few entries from strangers, but it soon became too weathered to survive the desert elements. So Rebecca returned to Utah in April and replaced the journal with a sturdier and \u201cmore waterproof\u201d one, along with an account of what had happened to her brother and a new pen. This time she added, \u201cI love you Bro. And thank you for loving me.\u201d Tammy Mayo Fielding, Rebecca and Jonathan\u2019s mother, also left a note in the journal. Two months later, on June 12, hiker Sherrie Joyce Miller\u00a0was taking a drive along Utah\u2019s\u00a0Highway 24 with her close friend Kelli Hansen when they pulled over at their favorite swimming hole by the Dirty Devil River. Miller, who prefers to be known as Sherr Joy, told CNN that after she got out of the car with her dog Bandit, she noticed a black notebook under a rock near a tree. It turned out to be the journal Rebecca had left in April. Sherr Joy recognized the name and the description from having read the news about Jonathan\u2019s death. \u201cI realized it was something precious, \u201cshe said. Captivated, she put the journal in a gallon bag and tucked it back under a rock, then left a note of her own, signed with her nickname, \u201cSharki.\u201d Rebecca Fielding had also visited Utah again in June but had not been able to locate the journal or read any of the new entries in it. On that trip she had even left a third journal in a waterproof container with a photo album near the spot of Jonathan\u2019s death, thinking the previous one had been lost. It turns out the April journal had been picked up from Jonathan\u2019s resting place at the end of Moon Overlook Road and left near Highway 24 by someone who identified themselves only as \u201ca nomad\u201d who believed it to be a \u201crandom notebook left by a tourist.\u201d \u201cIt was only after reaching this spot did I carefully read its pages,\u201d the nomad wrote in the journal on June 1. \u201cPerhaps Jonathan wanted to have one last adventure. What a most magical spot he chose.\u201d By then, other strangers had already left notes in the journal. One entry was from someone visiting from The Netherlands. After messaging Rebecca through Facebook, Sherr Joy and Hansen helped her devise a plan to make the journal a place where Jonathan\u2019s memory could live on. \u201cI reached out to Rebecca as one human being to another, I thought the family might want the journal returned to where it started,\u201d Sherr Joy said. \u201cI believe grief manifests into love when we as human beings embrace each other with kindness whether we personally knew someone or not.\u201d Strangers began leaving messages to honor Jonathan A public Facebook group, \u201cJonathan Fielding\u2019s Journal Journey\u201d was born two days later. The page asks travelers to update the journal before passing it along to the next person who finds it. Joy went back to Highway 24 and left a photo of Jonathan, along with a description of the journal project on the back, so future passersby would have context. \u201cIf you find this book, please take it to a new location and leave it for the next traveler,\u201d she wrote on a laminated piece of paper. \u201cHis sister, Rebecca Fielding started a Facebook page to track his journal. Please post a picture so his family may track the journey.\u201d Rebecca also made a TikTok video on June 14 to share the entries made in the journal before Sherr Joy\u2019s discovery. She set the TikTok to the song \u201cNot Dead Yet,\u201d by Lord Huron, Jonathan\u2019s favorite band, and added a message in the last slide: \u201cAs long as one person remembers who he was, he will never fully die.\u201d The video shows some of the comments left in the journal. \u201cJonathan, we did not know you\u2026\u201d wrote two travelers who identified themselves as David W. and James H. \u201cWe do know this: you took your last breaths at this sublime, heavenly place. And that, like your life, has to mean something.\u201d Another entry, signed by the nomad, read: \u201cJonathan\u2026 may you enjoy some time here listening to the water and resting under this tree.\u201d Others left items in the journal, like feathers and leaves. Rebecca said that she left the journal for Jonathan \u2014 but also for a small part of herself. It was a cry for help, she said. \u201cI wanted to be seen, pretty much. I wanted my grief and pain to be seen because I have a big family. It felt like people were looking at me, but they weren\u2019t seeing me and seeing what I was going through,\u201d she said. \u201c(I was) just feeling like an outsider and just feeling so alone because Jonathan was my person\u2026 I just didn\u2019t want to be alone anymore.\u201d The power of human connection in the face of tragedy For Rebecca Fielding, the journal project happened somewhat by accident. But the love she felt from her brother, she says, was nothing but intentional. He was a \u201cball of light.\u201d She said she feels like \u201cnothing I do will ever be good enough to make up for what happened \u2026 It\u2019s super cliche, but grief is just love with nowhere to go\u2026 This love I have for him; I don\u2019t really have anywhere else to put it.\u201d Even so, she\u2019s been deeply moved by how the journal idea has grown into \u201cthis huge, amazing thing\u201d that has affected others who have heard Jonathan\u2019s story. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s just so fitting for who Jonathan was and is such a good way to remember him, because it was just the little things he did in life that made a huge impact on people.\u201d According to Rebecca, Jonathan once spent 30 minutes disassembling a lamp in a stranger\u2019s yard to free a bird trapped inside. Another time, he and Rebecca were exploring\u00a0the Utah desert together when Rebecca started having anxiety about whether Jonathan was enjoying himself. \u201cThe entire time, I kept asking him, \u2018Hey, is this something you like doing? Do you want to do this instead?\u2019\u201d she recalled. \u201cEventually, he was just like, \u2018Rebecca, I don\u2019t care what I\u2019m doing. I\u2019m just happy to be spending time with you.\u2019\u201d Rebecca said receiving the journal entries from Sherr Joy was \u201cincredible\u201d and lifted her spirits. \u201cWhen (she) sent those messages, I was just blown away by the things that people had written in them because they were absolutely beautiful and just so touching,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll never meet these people (and) I\u2019ll never know a lot of their names, but they just really left a mark on my soul.\u201d For Sherr Joy, finding Rebecca\u2019s journal gave her hope for \u201chow we can make this world a better place.\u201d She believes \u201cit only takes one gesture or act of kindness to create a ripple of good energy.\u201d Now the public group has over 900 members, and anyone can use it to track the journal\u2019s progress and location. Rebecca says she\u2019s keeping her \u201cfingers crossed\u201d that the journal receives more entries soon. Rebecca said Jonathan also wrote in journals. After he died she and their mother\u00a0found a passage in one of them, which Rebecca read to CNN. \u201cWhy am I proud of myself? I don\u2019t quit. I\u2019m focused on getting better every day,\u201d Jonathan had written. \u201cI take care of others around me. I motivate everyone around me. What does growth require? Patience and forgiveness.\u201d Jonathan would have turned 20 last month. Now, his spirit lives on in the desert landscape that he loved so much, thanks to strangers who are touched and inspired by his story \u2014 and to his devoted sister, who wants him never to be forgotten.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/29/us/jonathan-fielding-utah-rebecca-journal-cec/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_28_us_dolphins-stranded-cape-cod-massachusetts", "text": "After more than 100 dolphins were found stranded off Cape Cod, Massachusetts, the numbers had dwindled down to between 10 to 20 dolphins circling in the harbor by Saturday morning following a 12-hour rescue effort by the International Fund for Animal Welfare, a spokesperson said. In what the IFAW described as possibly \u201cthe largest single mass stranding event\u201d in the organization\u2019s 26-year history, 125 Atlantic white-sided dolphins were located stranded early Friday in shallow mud flats of Wellfleet in an area called the \u201cGut,\u201d or Great Island at the Herring River. Stacey Hedman, the fund\u2019s communications director, described the area as a \u201cvery difficult location with dangerous mud.\u201d The town of Wellfleet is a little over 100 miles southeast of Boston. On Saturday, Hedman said other than the remaining 10 to 20 dolphins, the rest of the mammals were successfully herded out \u2013 \u201cat least for a time.\u201d Hedman added: \u201cThose spotted this morning are likely the same dolphins. They are still swimming but close to shore,\u201d noting that low tide was set to begin at noon. The non-profit, which rescues, rehabilitates and releases animals, described the Herring River Gut as \u201cthe epicenter of our mass strandings\u201d in a Facebook post on Friday. \u201cWe had 125 Atlantic white-sided dolphins strand and 10 died before we arrived,\u201d Hedman said in an email to CNN on Friday. The dolphins were herded in a coordinated response effort Friday to encourage their movement back to deeper waters, IFAW said in a news release Saturday. Rescuers began on foot and switched to boating efforts as the water returned to high tide just before 5 p.m. Friday, which worked in their favor to refloat the animals, according to the fund. Rescuers continued until sunset. The rescue operation, in which at least 25 fund workers and 100 volunteers assisted, was ongoing on Saturday.  The Whale and Dolphin Conservation, the Center for Coastal Studies, AmeriCorps of Cape Cod and the New England Aquarium are also supporting the operation. \u201cAt first light Saturday morning, an IFAW team was on the water to find 10 of the dolphins swimming in a dangerous area, and efforts have been successful to herd them towards deeper water,\u201d the fund stated in the release. \u201cIFAW scouts found another group of 25 dolphins swimming but close to shore in Eastham.\u201d Eastham is just south of Wellfleet. \u201cThis rescue had many challenges due to the number of dolphins, the large size of many of the animals, how spread out they were over a large area, the difficult mud conditions, and the complicated locations from which we could reach them,\u201d said Misty Niemeyer, stranding coordinator for IFAW, in a statement. \u201cIt was a 12-hour exhausting response in the unrelenting sun, but the team was able to overcome the various challenges and give the dolphins their best chance at survival,\u201d Niemeyer said. Hedman noted there is no set explanation for why dolphins strand. \u201cCape Cod is a global stranding hotspot due to the curvature of our shores and the fluctuation of our tides,\u201d Hedman said. More dolphins get stranded along Cape Cod\u2019s 12-mile stretch of shoreline than any other place globally, according to the fund. This story has been updated with additional information.

Joseph Eaton never provided a reason to law enforcement officials for the violent crimes he admitted committing in Maine last year, and he had no explanation for the victims\u2019 families and friends who spoke in court. Through written testimony read aloud, a woman described the horrific scene of blood and broken glass that confronted her in April 2023 when she found the crime scene where Eaton confessed to the fatal shootings. In a similar written statement, the father of one of\u00a0three people wounded\u00a0by bullets that Eaton fired on a highway spoke of his terror that day that his daughter would bleed out in his arms. She ultimately survived. A shooting survivor spoke of discovering 13 bullet holes in her car. Others said they experienced sleepless nights and nightmares as a result of Eaton\u2019s actions. \u201cHe killed the only four people in this world who actually loved and cared for him,\u201d said a distraught Kristina DeRaps, who is married to a nephew of one of the victims, Patti Eger. DeRaps called Eaton \u201ca selfish little boy.\u201d Eaton looked down at the defense table during much of the testimony. When he spoke, he said he was still in disbelief over his actions. \u201cI wake up every day regretting what I did,\u201d he said. Of his life sentence, he added, \u201cI honestly think I deserve worse. All I can say is, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d Law enforcement officials say Eaton, now 35, confessed to fatally shooting his parents, Eger and Eger\u2019s husband at the Egers\u2019 home in the rural town of Bowdoin. He also confessed to shooting at vehicles on Interstate 295 in Yarmouth. The crimes took place days after Eaton was released from a Maine prison for unrelated crimes. He has been\u00a0in jail since his latest arrest. Killed were David Eaton, 66; Eger and Cynthia Eaton, both 62; and Robert Eger, 72. Cynthia Eaton had picked her son up on April 14, when he was released from prison. Also killed was the Egers\u2019 dog, which led authorities to add animal cruelty to the list of charges against Joseph Eaton. Authorities believe Eaton delivered the fatal shots on April 17, 2023. The victims\u2019 bodies were found the following morning, on the same day authorities say he fired at cars on I-295 in Yarmouth, about 12 miles outside of Portland, Maine\u2019s biggest city. Eaton faced separate indictments because the attacks at the Bowdoin home and on the highway happened in different counties. At the time, Maine Public Safety Commissioner Michael Sauschuck called the shootings \u201can attack on the soul of our state.\u201d Months later, an Army reservist who lived in Bowdoin killed 18 people at two locations in the city of Lewiston, in what would become the state\u2019s deadliest mass shooting. An unsigned note found at the scene of the killings mentioned \u201csomeone being freed of pain and that the writer of the note wanted a new life,\u201d according to a criminal affidavit. Eaton told the Portland Press Herald newspaper in jailhouse interviews that he was not in control of his actions at the time of the shootings and didn\u2019t understand why he did it. All told, Eaton pleaded guilty on Monday to more than a dozen charges, including four counts of murder and aggravated attempted murder. He received the maximum penalty for each of them. Defense lawyer Andrew Wright said Eaton chose to plead guilty to take responsibility for his actions, believing it was the \u201creasonable and moral\u201d thing to do to bring the case to a conclusion. Outside the courthouse, Wright said he struggles to make sense of Eaton, who despite committing such violent crimes also struck him during their one-on-one interactions as \u201ca kind and compassionate and emotional and empathetic\u201d man. \u201cIt\u2019s a senseless act, that makes no sense to anyone involved,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a tragedy.\u201d Authorities say Eaton also has a criminal history in Florida and Kansas.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/01/us/maine-released-inmate-shootings/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_30_business_barbecue-grills-july-fourth-weber-traeger", "text": "Americans binged on grills during the pandemic, but the barbecue industry now faces a number of threats, including high meat prices and interest rates on top of economic uncertainty. Many feel no need to upgrade fairly recent purchases. Market leaders like higher-end grill manufacturer Traeger, once a pandemic darling, reported its latest quarter\u2019s grill sales were $76.8 million \u2014 a plunge from the $156.1 million the company raked in during the second quarter of 2021. Best-selling grill brand Weber has also seen its market share decline since 2020, according to data from TraQline. (Weber did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment.) Home Depot also reported pressure in more expensive patio and garden equipment, including grills, during its first quarter in May, part of a larger dip in sales and earnings. And it\u2019s not just the big brands. Local stores that sell grills and other backyard cooking gear similarly reported demand dropping.  \u201cIt\u2019s trending down,\u201d said Brian Bushfield, general manager at West Coast BBQ Shop in San Diego, California. He noted a sluggish start to June and a slow Memorial Day, despite the holiday being one of the most popular occasions to purchase new grills. America might be less interested in buying grills, but they\u2019re still using them a ton. And there\u2019s evidence that the great BBQ sales evaporation may have hit a floor. Lockdown was a grill (seller)\u2019s best friend Americans\u00a0aren\u2019t\u00a0cooking outside on grills less. At least, that\u2019s according to statistics from the Hearth, Patio & Barbecue Association that reported 80% of U.S. homeowners owned a grill or smoker in 2023 \u2014 up from 64% in 2019.\u202fOf the new grill owners surveyed, 27% cited cooking more at home during Covid as the reason for their purchase. Other than barbecue grills, consumables like charcoal pellets and propane tanks make up Home Depot\u2019s grill category. Home Depot Senior Merchant of Grills Joe Downey said that these items drive a large portion of sales and that they are powered by new customers who purchased grills during the pandemic returning frequently to buy fuel. \u201cMore cooks are cooking at home than ever before,\u201d he said. The cost of food at home fell earlier this year as the cost of eating out rose, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics that reported a 0.2% dip in grocery prices from March to April. Roy Morchian, owner of American Royal Hardware in Montclair, New Jersey, told CNN that the number of grills sold in 2020 rose to 160 from his store\u2019s yearly average range of 80 to 120 grills. And while their sales \u201chave come back to normal\u201d now closer to pre-pandemic levels, he notices new faces have joined familiar ones when purchasing propane tanks to fuel the Weber grills they stock. Most grill makers and retailers seem to agree that the pandemic pulled forward demand for grills and other long-lasting home equipment as people searched for ways to fill their days and entertain their families at home. San Diego Grill Pros owner Jessica Hernandez recounted \u201castronomical\u201d sales numbers and dubbed 2020 their \u201cunicorn year.\u201d Corey Martin, VP of Marketing at Texas Star Grill Shop described droves of people flocking to their Houston branch to buy grills and shelling out thousands of dollars for higher-end models like Weber\u2019s Genesis, which retails between $800 and $1,800, and Traeger\u2019s Timberline, which starts at about $3,000. \u201cIt was like a really busy grocery store,\u201d he said of his shop. But he and his staff knew that 2020 might be an aberration and the windfall might not last. \u201cIt would be stupid to be in a grill business and think that Covid was the new normal,\u201d Martin said. He said retailers who sell grills know it\u2019s a slow growth and seasonal industry. Downey sees Home Depot\u2019s grill sales stabilizing now following the lockdown-driven high. He anticipates that pandemic-purchased grills will reach the end of their life cycle and bring returning buyers with them in 2025. \u201cThe bottom has been reached and we are on the upswing in terms of getting closer to the end of [the grill] life cycle,\u201d he said. A key issue is a grill\u2019s life cycle: an average grill could last about five years and Americans purchased more than 21 million grills and smokers in 2020. It\u2019s clear that the replacement phase still hasn\u2019t kicked in quite yet. Reigniting the market Meanwhile, grill sellers are looking for ways to stoke demand. Beyond running familiar summer promotions for popular grilling days like Memorial Day and Father\u2019s Day, Downey said that Home Depot is trying to encourage young first-time homeowners to buy grills by introducing them to well-known brands at lower price points. Downey said somebody purchasing a $99 Weber kettle later might look to buy the compact Weber Spirit. \u201cThen as they grow, maybe they\u2019ll aspire to get into the Weber Genesis,\u201d he said, referencing the brand\u2019s more expensive model. Ace Hardware is running advertisements promoting its longstanding free assembly and delivery on grills \u2013- from brands such as Big Green Egg, Blackstone, Weber and Traeger \u2013 priced $399 and up, for Ace Rewards members, which is a free program to join. Traeger CEO Jeremy Andrus told CNN of the soft demand period \u201cWe are not waiting for this to end and riding it out.\u201d He pointed to Traeger hosting weekend cooking demonstrations outside of retail stores like Home Depot and Ace Hardware. \u201cIf we have an opportunity to get in front of the consumer and not only explain what a Traeger does but give them an opportunity to taste the food cooked off of a Traeger, it\u2019s a very effective conversion tool,\u201d he said. But firing up demand in a traditionally slow-growth industry is a challenge, according to Simeon Siegel, an analyst at BMO Capital Markets who follows Traeger. \u201cIf someone has a barbecue, they\u2019re not going to buy another simply because it\u2019s on sale,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the end of the day, if someone doesn\u2019t need to buy a grill, there\u2019s only so many things companies can do to create demand.\u201d And economic trends haven\u2019t helped. Beef and veal prices rose the fastest among other food categories in 2024 and the US Department of Agriculture expects prices to rise another 4% this year. Some consumers are abandoning meat entirely. A year and a half ago, Bloomfield, New Jersey, resident Shikhiu Ing traded grilled meat for greens as a part of a conscious health decision. While he describes firing up his grill three times a week during the pandemic, he now finds less use for it after going mostly vegetarian. \u201cIt\u2019s non-functional right now. Grilling vegetables is kind of a chore to be honest,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just faster in the air fryer. Throw some broccoli in there, air fry. You got vegetables.\u201d Hot grill summers are here to stay? The grill industry isn\u2019t a stranger to slumps or about-face shifts in consumer demand. Andrus pointed to grill sales declining in the years following the 2008 recession before returning to growth for the next 10 years as a testament to the industry\u2019s resiliency. \u201cAmericans love to cook outdoors,\u201d he said. \u201cThey always have, they always will.\u201d For Newark, New Jersey, native Ayla Dunkley, cooking outdoors has been a family tradition. \u201cI learned how to grill from my grandfather and my father, so I learned everything from them,\u201d she said. Following her grandfather\u2019s advice, Dunkley replaces her Blackstone cooker every three to five years and waits until the summer season is over to shop at lower prices. Fourth of July cookouts will\u00a0cost $71.22 on average for 10 guests this summer, according to data from the American Farm Bureau Federation. That\u2019s up 5% from last year and up 30% from 2019. Yet Dunkley\u2019s annual plans to celebrate the holiday with her family in Pennsylvania are still on, grill in tow.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/30/business/barbecue-grills-july-fourth-weber-traeger/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_27_us_uvalde-grand-jury-indictments-police-chief-officer", "text": "A grand jury has indicted two former Uvalde school police officers in the botched law enforcement response to the 2022 mass shooting at Robb Elementary school that left 19 children and two teachers dead, two Texas state government sources with knowledge of the indictment told CNN Thursday. Former Uvalde Consolidated Independent School District Police Chief Pete Arredondo and former school police officer Adrian Gonzales were named in the indictments, which represent the first criminal charges filed in the school massacre. Arredondo surrendered himself to the custody of the Texas Rangers in Uvalde on Thursday, an official with the Texas Department of Public Safety told CNN. The former chief was booked on 10 counts of child endangerment and known criminal negligence, according to the indictment. Arredondo was then released\u00a0on bond, according to the Uvalde County Jail. Gonzales was booked into the Uvalde County Jail early Friday afternoon, the Uvalde Leader-News reported, citing Uvalde County Sheriff\u2019s Office Chief Deputy Brandon McCutchen. Gonzales was waiting to be processed, McCutchen told the paper. Earlier in the day, Gonzales\u2019 attorney Nico LaHood told CNN in a statement the former school police officer was planning to self-surrender \u201cso the judicial process can move forward.\u201d \u201cIt is very early on in our representation, so we will be working to acquire the evidence, the government is relying on, in this accusation,\u201d LaHood said. \u201cMr. Gonzales\u2019 position is he did not violate school district policy or state law. The application of this statute, to law enforcement, under these circumstances is unprecedented in the state of Texas. It will take time to evaluate these allegations and the underlying facts,\u201d LaHood continued. CNN has reached out to the Uvalde County Jail for more information. The indictment against Gonzales was not immediately available from the Uvalde County District Court clerk\u2019s office. \u201cOur administration has not been contacted by the District Attorney\u2019s Office regarding any of our staff and we don\u2019t have any comment at this time regarding the matter,\u201d the Uvalde Police Department said in a statement on Facebook Thursday night. The Uvalde County District Attorney\u2019s office is not planning to file any more indictments in the botched response to the shooting, according to family members who have spoken to District Attorney Christina Mitchell. Kimberly Mata-Rubio, the mother of 10-year-old victim Lexi Rubio, and Brett Cross, the guardian of 10-year-old victim Uziyah Garcia, told CNN they were informed by Mitchell there would be no further indictments coming out of the grand jury. \u201cI\u2019m glad two people are indicted,\u201d Mata-Rubio told CNN Friday. \u201cIt\u2019s not justice until there are convictions. But I am also aware that there were others at fault that day, and it\u2019s hard to accept that they will not face any consequences.\u201d \u201cI would be lying if I didn\u2019t say I feel like that\u2019s not enough,\u201d Cross told CNN. Arredondo faces 10 felony charges of child endangerment for failing to recognize the incident as an active shooting and for failing to take proper action to intervene, the indictment says, and these behaviors placed each child in \u201cimminent danger of bodily injury, death, physical impairment and mental impairment.\u201d Gonzales also faces felony charges of abandoning and endangering a child, Mitchell, the Uvalde district attorney, told the Uvalde Leader-News. The district attorney\u2019s office declined to comment to CNN Friday. Family members of the victims have been meeting with the DA\u2019s office to discuss the results of the months-long grand jury investigation, according to Brett Cross, the guardian of 10-year-old Uziyah Garcia, one of the fourth graders killed in the shooting rampage. Jesse Rizo, the uncle of one of the students killed, Jacklyn Cazares, said he was pleasantly surprised to learn about two officers\u2019 indictments, but had hoped more people were faced with criminal charges, he told CNN\u2019s Kate Bolduan Friday. \u201cIt\u2019s the beginning of something, right?\u201d Rizo said. \u201cBut in order to bring closure, you would want all the officers that didn\u2019t do their job that day, that failed to respond appropriately, you would want them to be held accountable in an equal way.\u201d Rizo hopes the DA will explain her intentions in public and indicate if any more indictments can be expected, he said. \u201cA lot of us are not exposed to the daily legalities of all these things, so we get a little confused with the technical things that go on,\u201d Rizo said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of questions that need to be answered as well.\u201d The Uvalde Consolidated Independent School District offered its condolences to the families of the victims Friday, saying it had no further information to add. \u201cAs with the rest of the Uvalde community, we have only just learned about the grand jury decision regarding two indictments being issued,\u201d school district spokeswoman Anne Marie Espinoza said in a statement. How the fallout unfolded Earlier this year, the\u00a0US Justice Department\u00a0released a damning report that concluded law enforcement officers had\u00a0many opportunities to reassess their flawed response\u00a0to the May 24, 2022, shooting at Robb Elementary School. Bursts of gunfire, reports a teacher had been shot and then a desperate call from a student trapped with the gunman could \u2013 and should \u2013 all have prompted a drive to stop the bloodshed far sooner, said the report. Instead, it took 77 minutes from when the 18-year-old shooter walked into Robb Elementary School until he was stopped. The carnage remains among the\u00a0deadliest\u00a0episodes in America\u2019s\u00a0ongoing scourge\u00a0of campus shootings. Critical failures in leadership\u00a0among specific law enforcement officers who rushed to Robb Elementary are cited by the Justice Department, whose\u00a0575-page report\u00a0was released nearly 20 months after the massacre. Arredondo was fired\u00a0in August 2022 for his role in the failed response. In May, his replacement, Joshua Gutierrez, submitted his\u00a0resignation and his last day on the job was Wednesday, according to a school official\u2019s statement. Gonzales, who had been with school district police since July 2021 and previously with Uvalde police since 2009, told investigators he was at the high school when he heard a report of a vehicle accident by Robb Elementary and went to check. Gonzales, who said he was one of the first officers to arrive, heard shots and entered the south hallway along with Arredondo. Gonzales said he tried to call for the SWAT team on his radio but could not transmit inside the school building so he left. \u201cOnce I got out to get radio reception, I never went back in,\u201d he told investigators. While the gunman was unchallenged inside the school, Gonzales said he spent much of the time waiting with emergency medics outside the west door. He also found a set of keys and a plan of the school, he said, that had been requested by a Texas Ranger on scene. State Sen. Roland Gutierrez told CNN Thursday he believes the Texas Department of Public Safety also bears substantial responsibility for the failed law enforcement response and should have been included in the indictments. \u201cThis is nothing but a whitewash of the most tragic mass shooting in our nation\u2019s history \u2013 one of them at least \u2013 and certainly the worst officer-involved response to a mass shooting in our nation\u2019s history. And all\u00a0of it falls in the hands of the Department of Public Safety and (its director) Steve McCraw.\u201d During the fallout following the massacre, DPS Director Steven McCraw repeatedly called the law enforcement response to the shooting an \u201cabject failure\u201d and said each of its officers\u2019 actions would be internally investigated and scrutinized by the district attorney. \u201cIt was more than an abject failure and it\u2019s a crime not to indict those officers,\u201d Gutierrez said. CNN has sought comment from the state\u2019s Department of Public Safety. Officers, school employees and shooting victims testified before grand jury Multiple law enforcement officers who responded to the shooting, including members of the Texas Department of Public Safety, were ordered to testify before the grand jury, CNN previously reported. School employees and victims of the shooting began their testimony before the grand jury in March \u2013 shortly after the Uvalde City Council\u00a0released an independent report clearing all local officers of wrongdoing. The independent investigator hired by the city\u00a0reported his findings at a packed city council meeting, saying all the officers who responded to the school from the Uvalde Police Department acted in good faith and should be exonerated. The findings sparked the fury of many victims\u2019 parents and community members who have\u00a0said for nearly two years that some should not be absolved. Less than a week after the release of the report, Uvalde Police Chief Daniel Rodriguez abruptly announced he would resign, effective April 6, saying it was time for \u201ca new chapter\u201d in his career. Federal report describes failed police response The Justice Department report dismissed the early official narrative of brave first responders saving lives that day and said \u201cmany victims shared that it added to their pain during a challenging time.\u201d The report found ample problems also emerged after the gunman was killed \u2013 from getting students away from the school and reunited with families to how bereaved parents were told their children were dead, the release of information about what happened, and the provision of therapy services. The report describes the quick arrival of law enforcement officers who ran toward the sound of gunfire, then almost immediately stopped once they got near the classrooms where the gunman was killing fourth graders and educators. That decision ran counter to\u00a0widely established active shooter response protocol, which instructs law enforcement to move toward and eliminate any threat. Instead, the intensity level dropped as responders began to treat the situation as a \u201cbarricaded suspect\u201d operation that did not need immediate action, even as more officers arrived and the signals of ongoing danger multiplied. That was the \u201csingle most critical tactical failure,\u201d the team from the Justice Department\u2019s Office of Community Oriented Policing Services found. In May, 19 families of the students and teachers killed or injured in the mass shooting said they settled a lawsuit with the city for $2 million and announced they are suing 92 officers with Texas Department of Public Safety, the school district and individual employees. The city confirmed the settlement in a statement. \u201cIt has been an unbearable two years,\u201d Javier Cazares, the father of 9-year-old victim Jacklyn Cazares, said at a May news conference. \u201cWe all know who took our children\u2019s lives, but there was an obvious systemic failure out there on May 24. The whole world saw that.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/27/us/uvalde-grand-jury-indictments-police-chief-officer/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "us"}}

The body of 52-year-old Kyle Kreykes was discovered on Monday after he was reported missing by his family on June 21, Rock Valley Police Chief Monte Warburton told CNN on Friday. Kreykes had drowned in the flooded basement of his home where he lived alone, Warburton said. Officials could not search Kreykes\u2019s home for several days due to the high water levels, Warburton said. Large pumps were brought in to remove the floodwaters. President Joe Biden issued a disaster declaration for several Iowa counties Monday, including Clay County. At least two other deaths have been reported due to the flooding, officials in Iowa and South Dakota said. In Clay County, a man died after attempting to drive a pickup truck across rapid floodwaters on Saturday in the city of Spencer, according to a news release from the Clay County Sheriff\u2019s Office on Tuesday. The man, who was from Elburn, Illinois, was swept away and found floating in the Little Sioux River, officials said.
