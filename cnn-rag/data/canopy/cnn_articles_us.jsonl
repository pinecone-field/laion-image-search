{"id": "2024_05_18_us_ucla-faculty-rejects-censure-gene-block", "text": "The UCLA Academic Senate rejected censuring and making a no confidence statement against university\u00a0Chancellor Gene Block amid mounting criticism over his handling of a campus pro-Palestinian encampment that was violently attacked by counterprotesters. Faculty members were divided Thursday while mulling whether \u201cChancellor Block failed to ensure the safety of our students and grievously mishandled the events.\u201d On the motion to censure Block, 50% of votes cast were in favor. The motion of no confidence in Block garnered 43% of votes in favor. After the vote, University\u00a0of\u00a0California President Michael V. Drake said in a statement: \u201cThese are\u00a0extraordinarily complex\u00a0and\u00a0unprecedented times for American universities. I appreciate\u00a0Chancellor\u00a0Block\u2019s dedication\u00a0and\u00a0commitment\u00a0to\u00a0the University during these difficult times. We will continue\u00a0to\u00a0provide our\u00a0chancellors with the support\u00a0and\u00a0resources they need\u00a0to\u00a0respond\u00a0to\u00a0these ever-evolving situations.\u201d Andrea M. Kasko,\u00a0who serves as the chair of the Academic Senate, called on colleagues to \u201ctry to find common ground\u201d in a\u00a0statement issued\u00a0following the votes. \u201cAs we all process the results of the votes by the Legislative Assembly on May 16, 2024, on the resolutions of no confidence and censure of the Chancellor, it is clear that we are not united in how we view the major events of the past weeks and the campus response to them,\u201d Kasko said. CNN has reached out to Block and UCLA for comment. As part of a movement that swept university campuses throughout the nation, pro-Palestinian protesters set up an encampment at UCLA in an effort to raise awareness about the mass deaths and destruction in Gaza, and calling for the university to divest from any financial ties with Israel. On April 30, law enforcement stood by for hours as counterprotesters attacked the pro-Palestinian encampment,\u00a0which erupted into\u00a0the worst violence stemming from the ongoing college protests around the country over Israel\u2019s war in Gaza. More than 150 students \u201cwere assaulted with pepper spray and bear mace,\u201d and at least 25 protesters ended up being transported to local emergency rooms, according to the encampment\u2019s organizers. While a criminal investigation is still underway into the assaults, a CNN review of footage, social media posts, and interviews found that some of the most dramatic attacks caught on camera that night were committed by people outside UCLA \u2013 not the university students and faculty who were eventually arrested. After the violence and as the university faced criticism, Block announced UCLA\u2019s security operations would change. He said it is clear that \u201curgent changes are needed in how we administer safety operations\u201d in order to best protect the school community. The university also said it is investigating \u201ca group\u00a0of\u00a0instigators\u201d who attacked the encampment, according to a statement from Block. \u201cHolding the instigators\u00a0of\u00a0this attack accountable and enhancing our campus safety operations are both critical. Our community members can only learn, work and thrive in an environment where they feel secure,\u201d Block said in the May 6 statement. Other universities and their leaders have faced backlash over their response to campus protests as well. This week, arts and sciences faculty at Columbia University passed a vote of no confidence in the school\u2019s president, Minouche Shafik, who has been under\u00a0intense scrutiny for her handling\u00a0of campus protests and her congressional testimony on the subject. Last week, the University of Southern California\u2019s faculty senate voted 21-7 to censure USC President Carol Folt and Provost Andrew Guzman over the removal of a protest encampment from campus and the use of Los Angeles police to arrest protesters, among other issues. Faculty and staff express disapproval Hundreds of University of California faculty and staff signed a letter addressed to Block \u201cdecrying the horrific violence perpetrated against our students on April 30, and calling on him to fully protect our students\u2019 safety and security, and to honor their first amendment rights to free speech.\u201d Days later, more than 900 University of California faculty and staff signed a letter demanding Block\u2019s resignation following the arrests at the campus. \u201cFollowing the violent and aggressive police sweep of the Palestine Solidarity Encampment on May 2, 2024, resulting in more than 200 students, faculty, and staff arrested while peacefully protesting, it has become obvious that Chancellor Block has failed our university,\u201d the letter said. The United Auto Workers 4811, which represents 48,000 University of California academic workers, has authorized a strike \u201cif circumstances justify,\u201d citing \u201cnumerous, egregious unfair labor practices committed\u201d during on-campus protests.\u00a0Specifically, the union mentioned the handling of protests on April 30 and May 1 at UCLA. \u201cAt the heart of this is our right to free speech and peaceful protest,\u201d said Rafael Jaime, a graduate worker in the English department and president of UAW 4811.\u00a0\u201cIf members of the academic community are maced and beaten down for peacefully demonstrating on this issue, our ability to speak up on all issues is threatened.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/18/us/ucla-faculty-rejects-censure-gene-block/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/22/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_05_18_us_helms-ategeka-college-acceptance-cec", "text": "Helms Ategeka wants to be a pop star. But when he told his dad he planned to pursue a music degree after his graduation next month from high school, his father wasn\u2019t exactly thrilled. So last fall, the Oakland, California, teenager took a different approach: He started applying to colleges. More than 150 of them. Before long, he got an acceptance letter. Then another. And another. The trickle became a flood until there were 122 of them \u2014 along with some $5.3 million in proposed grants and scholarship offers. (CNN has viewed the acceptance letters.) His father says he\u2019s proud of Helms\u2019 3.94 GPA and had hoped his son would pick a career with financial stability, like medicine or computer technology. Or maybe Helms might follow in his own footsteps as a mechanical engineering graduate from the University of California, Berkeley. But as he watched the mountain of acceptance letters in his son\u2019s room get bigger with every mail delivery, Chris Ategeka\u2019s hope dimmed. The messages on the multicolored envelopes beckoned with undeniable enthusiasm.\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re in!\u201d one said. \u201cOur family welcomes your family! read another. \u201cHe\u2019s so confident that music is what he wants to do, it would be a disservice for me to try to guide him otherwise \u2026 that\u2019s why he applied to a gazillion colleges to prove a point,\u201d Ategeka says. \u201cI told him, \u2018You want to be a musician? It takes a lot of hard work.\u2019 And his reaction was, I\u2019ll use my determination to do this to show you how hard I can work.\u201d But how does an 18-year-old begin narrowing down such a massive list of options? And so began a journey that came with tough lessons on change and compromise \u2014 for both father and son. He had a key requirement for the colleges he applied to Helms\u2019 life revolves around music. At Head-Royce High School in Oakland he\u2019s part of an a cappella group that meets every week to belt out covers of popular pop music. His room is stacked with CDs by Beyonc\u00e9, Prince and Bruno Mars. Before he starts college in the fall, he\u2019s taking a summer trip to Peru with a choir to perform in churches and communities. \u201cI live for music. I spend most of my time either listening to music, making music or out there performing,\u201d Helms says. \u201cI feel the most alive and fulfilled when I\u2019m doing something related to music.\u201d So when he started his college application journey, he had one key requirement: The school needed to have a strong music program. He mostly used universities\u2019 online portals for his applications, he says, which made it easier to copy and paste his information to multiple places. His father paid the application fee required by some universities. Helms spent many hours writing essays for different schools, although most were variations of the same personal story. In his essays, he highlighted his passion for music and his background as an immigrant. A small group of schools, including Brown, Wesleyan and Colgate, rejected him or placed him on their waiting list. But the much longer list of schools that said yes spans the country, from big state universities to smaller private colleges: Bard College, Drexel, Howard, Loyola Marymount, Sarah Lawrence College \u2014 and yes, UC Berkeley. He moved to the US just before the pandemic shut down everything Ategeka immigrated to the US from his homeland in Uganda in late 2000s to attend the University of California, Berkeley. He left Helms with his mother in the western Ugandan town of Fort Portal, where he lived until he joined his father in California five years ago. Soon after Helms came to the US in 2019, the world largely shut down due to the coronavirus pandemic. He attended his new school via Zoom and missed out on a big part of interacting with others and learning the nuances of American culture. As a result, he wasn\u2019t sure his college applications would resonate or meet a lot of the requirements, he says. \u201cI gave it my all with the application process. I reached out to the schools to make sure that they\u2019ve received my application and made sure I gave my essays my best shot. But I did not expect so many schools to say yes, so I was not prepared,\u201d Helms says. His modern drama teacher, Ricky Lapidus, is not surprised that Helms has received so many offers. \u201cHelms loves learning \u2014 he\u2019s interested in other people as much as he is in grades,\u201d says Lapidus, head of the Upper School at Head-Royce High School.\u00a0\u201cHe is a deeply empathetic person and that\u2019s how he approaches school \u2014 how do I learn more so I can understand others more? What makes him stand out for a college is a combination of his brains, sure, but also his joy and willingness to explore new things.\u201d He used his father\u2019s words against him Helms spent the past few months studying the websites and social media accounts of schools that accepted him. He\u2019s watched videos of their music programs on YouTube and TikTok to get a sense of where he fits in. And most importantly, he\u2019s had candid conversations with his father about the realities of a career in music. \u201cAs an immigrant parent, I was thinking, \u2018How are you going to pay your bills?\u2019 But he\u2019s a driven kid \u2026 and he used my words against me,\u201d Ategeka says. Through this process, Ategeka says he realized he was viewing his son\u2019s academic quest through what he describes as an \u201cAfrican immigrant mentality\u201d that prioritizes certain lucrative careers as markers of success. \u201cI always tell him that he can be whatever he wants to be and can do anything he puts his mind to. And he was like, \u2018Yeah, this is what I really want to do.\u2019\u201d Ategeka says he\u2019s slowly been embracing his son\u2019s dream to study music and become a pop singer.\u00a0He says he still worries about his future, because he knows how difficult it is to become famous enough to earn a living from your talent. But he admires Helms\u2019 determination and focus, as does his mother in Uganda. Chris Ategeka says his son proved he\u2019s serious about a music career by getting accepted to so many colleges. \u201cHe is really highlighting the idea that he\u2019s not a kid who is failing out of school or running away from home to live in the subway to make the music thing work,\u201d Ategeka says. \u201cHe\u2019s sent the message that, \u2018I know I\u2019m smart. I got the grades. I can get into college. I can do whatever I want. But this is my passion, this is my drive, this is what I chose.\u201d His college choice has a connection to his dad After months of research, Helms made his choice: He will stay nearby and study music at his dad\u2019s alma mater, UC Berkeley. A spokesperson for Berkeley confirmed that he\u2019s been accepted. \u201cI created a spreadsheet, and I wrote out the pros and the cons for each of the schools and really tried to weigh my priorities,\u201d he says. \u201cIf I would like to be close to home, what kind of program each school has or doesn\u2019t have, that kind of stuff.\u201d Watching social media videos of the schools\u2019 concerts and other musical events revealed the quality and diversity of the programs offered, which helped in making his decision, he says. Videos of musical events at Berkeley had a certain joie de vivre, he says, which helped him see himself there. The school also has a wide variety of musical programs, including African music ensembles and a brass quintet. As an immigrant, Helms is part of a growing demographic. Children born abroad or in the US to an immigrant parent accounted for 58% of the increase in the nation\u2019s college enrollment between 2000 and 2018, a study by the Migration Policy Institute shows. \u201cThe face of US higher education is changing,\u201d the study says. \u201cStudents are more likely to come from immigrant families than in the past.\u201d Helms\u2019 new chapter comes at a precarious time for US colleges and universities as Berkeley and other schools grapple with the aftermath of pro-Palestinian student protests that have led to disruptions, arrests and debates about the limits of free speech. But Ategeka says his son\u2019s journey has reminded him to be open to new possibilities and ways of thinking. He believes Helms will find appropriate ways to be a part of difficult campus conversations. \u201cCollege is not about conforming to status quo \u2026 it is ground zero for training leaders who shape the future. It is in college that the young minds rethink the old and build the new for humanity and our planet,\u201d he says. Helms is excited to follow in his father\u2019s footsteps at Berkeley, which has an admission rate of about 12%. Of the nearly 126,000 students who applied in fall of 2023, only about 15,000 were accepted. But most importantly, he says, he\u2019s looking forward to taking the next step toward being a professional musician.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/18/us/helms-ategeka-college-acceptance-cec/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/22/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_05_18_us_covid-victims-death-memorial-website", "text": "Four years ago, Jody Settle and his partner toasted over Guinness beers and a takeout meal they had picked up from a normally bustling Irish pub in New York City left deserted by the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic. It was the last St. Patrick\u2019s Day meal the couple would share. Settle, 58, died from the virus 33 days later, on April 19, 2020, one of nearly 1.2 million people in the United States who have succumbed to Covid-19 since 2020. Ed Koenig, Settle\u2019s longtime partner, remembers Settle\u2019s peaceful face as he visited him in the hospital for the last time. Willie Nelson\u2019s version of \u201cAlways On My Mind\u201d played nearby as Koenig kissed Settle\u2019s forehead through his protective gear. A year ago, the World Health Organization declared an end to Covid-19 as a global public health emergency. The United States allowed its own public health emergency to expire nearly a week after the WHO\u2019s announcement.  Stay-at-home orders have long ended, and much of society has moved on from the pandemic.  But Covid-19-related grief lingers for millions. On the fourth anniversary of Settle\u2019s death \u2013 and driven by a need to mourn \u2013 Koenig wrote about his former partner on the Covid-19 remembrance website WhoWeLost. In part, he shared: \u201cYes, indeed, you will always be on my mind.\u201d The website, launched in 2020 in Kentucky and home to around 2,000 published and yet-to-be-published stories, serves as a digital haven for Koenig and hundreds of others. Those still grieving can write about their losses in a comment-free environment without interactions, judgment, internet trolls and the sometimes toxic nature of social media conversations surrounding the virus \u2013 including whether Covid-19 is even real, according to the website\u2019s founder, Martha Greenwald.  \u201cIt\u2019s their sacred space to say what they need without someone throwing all this cruelty at them,\u201d Greenwald, a poet and former English professor from New Jersey, said of her nonprofit website. Greenwald, who lives in Louisville, Kentucky, started The WhoWeLost Project for bereaved Kentuckians, inspired by the state\u2019s public health commissioner, who in October 2020 called on state residents to share their Covid-19 concerns with him. The project offers writing prompts and guidance for those looking to share their memories. Greenwald expanded the website nationally after a 2021 story on the website from an NPR affiliate garnered widespread praise.  \u201cI think the need for the site, in a way, is larger because less people are paying attention (to Covid-19),\u201d Greenwald told CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the last places that are still paying attention.\u201d Coping with Covid-19-related grief Researchers studying the pandemic\u2019s repercussions have found that grieving relatives of Covid-19 victims experienced higher rates of a prolonged grief disorder when compared with pre-pandemic periods. In general, the disorder, characterized by acute and insistent grief, impacts between 7% and 10% of adults and between 5% and 10% of children, according to the American Psychiatric Association. In a 2023 study, researchers in the United Kingdom found people were more than three times as likely to exhibit prolonged grief disorder symptoms 13 months after losing a loved one during the pandemic than compared with pre-pandemic times. \u201cThere\u2019s this lingering sense that their loved ones and their own grief were never allowed to exist, so it\u2019s very repressed and kind of still simmering under the surface for a lot of them,\u201d Greenwald said of the writers on WhoWeLost.org. \u201c(For) the people whose loved ones died early on during Covid, there were no funerals, so all the stories that could have been told at that wake that didn\u2019t happen. They can write those stories down here.\u201d New York City resident Wiandy Santiago\u2019s 65-year-old brother Wilmard Santiago died of Covid-19 in April 2020, a week after being placed on a ventilator. The family, limited to 10 funeral attendees standing 6 feet apart, couldn\u2019t hold a service for him until two months after his death. She says she wasn\u2019t able to mourn her brother in person with family. \u201c(We) grieved through a Zoom call,\u201d Wiandy Santiago told CNN. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing like being able to sit next to your loved one and grieve your brother, your sister, your spouse, your child.\u201d Her stepson, Alberto Locascio, died of the virus in September 2021, a week before his 40th birthday. \u201cUnless you went through it, you don\u2019t understand why it doesn\u2019t go away,\u201d she said of what she described as \u201ca complicated grief\u201d in a post on WhoWeLost.org. As she spoke, her eyes moistened. She says she has often wondered about her big brother\u2019s final thoughts. He died alone in a Bronx hospital without his wife and two sons by his side. \u201cWhat was he feeling? Was he scared?\u201d Santiago said amid tears, her voice quivering with the pain of never getting to say goodbye. She says she\u2019s sought solace in writing about her late relatives through the WhoWeLost project. Over the past two years, she\u2019s used the site to write poignant stories about the lives of her brother and stepson \u2013 like how Wilmard loved photography and the Yankees, or how Locascio was a kind and gentle soul who their family considered their protector. Scrolling Facebook through recent prom photos of Locascio\u2019s son brought a mix of emotions, she recently wrote on the website. \u201cI was sad for Nicholas who would have loved to have his dad there with him. So happy, yet so sad,\u201d Santiago wrote. She opens up about her lingering grief in many of the posts. \u201cI feel that healing comes from writing, releasing those emotions,\u201d she said. Greenwald agrees. She\u2019s a special adviser for Rituals in the Making, a research project by the anthropology department at George Washington University that has in part examined the ways in which those in mourning adapt when their normal rituals, like funerals, are interrupted. \u201cRituals can really help the surviving family and friends to feel that loss is recognized,\u201d said Sarah Wagner, a principal investigator on Rituals in the Making. \u201cWhen that does not happen, there\u2019s all kinds of ways that mourning stretches on and intensifies, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing with the pandemic.\u201d A safe place to grieve on their own terms Before discovering WhoWeLost, Koenig turned to social media for support from others grieving Covid-19-related deaths, but he says problems often arose in these settings as trolls bombarded\u00a0mourners\u00a0with horrendous comments. \u201cCovid isn\u2019t real, they died of something else.\u201d Koenig says that was a typical response in social media posts. Even as Covid-19 deaths climbed into the tens of thousands during the pandemic, a misinformation-led sector of society, fueled by political polarization, disregarded the virus\u2019s seriousness. Others denied its existence despite evidence from public health experts showing otherwise. A 2020 YouGov study found 13% of people polled in the US believed the coronavirus, or the virus that causes Covid-19, did not exist. The Poynter Institute\u2019s fact-checking website Politifact labeled claims that denied, downplayed or spread disinformation about Covid-19 as its \u201clie of the year\u201d in 2020. Koenig says the most offensive remarks he saw were expletive-filled death wishes hurled toward the LGBTQ+ community. \u201cAll you perverts are going to hell anyway, so what difference does it make?\u201d Koenig recalled reading. On WhoWeLost.org, those coping with prolonged grief are free to share their experiences away from those negative online conversations, Greenwald says. Many of the comments Greenwald says she has seen have involved shaming victims afflicted by more than one condition or disease at a time. \u201cIf someone posted that their mother died of cancer, they would get the usual \u2018sorry for your loss,\u2019 but if they posted that their mother died of Covid, then the comments might be something like, \u2018well, didn\u2019t she have cancer?\u2019 or \u2018she had a heart problem,\u2019 or \u2018she was a smoker,\u2019\u201d Greenwald said. Even when no one is shaming them about comorbidities or denying Covid-19\u2019s existence, Greenwald says the bereaved may feel no one wants to hear about what they\u2019re going through. The WhoWeLost project is still listening, Greenwald says. \u201cI know so many people who will say, \u2018my co-workers don\u2019t want to hear about it, or they tiptoe around the subject,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re still wanting to hear what you have to say even though everybody else wants you to shut up.\u201d Paige Gavin, a master\u2019s student also working on Rituals in the Making, said of WhoWeLost: \u201cThe ability for mourners to reflect on the positiveness of seeing their loved one \u2013 not just in their death, but in the life that they lived \u2013 I think that\u2019s been one of the benefits alongside having a place to tell that story.\u201d Wagner described WhoWeLost as a space for the bereaved to memorialize on their own terms. \u201cGiven that there was so much politicization, I think it is an opportunity for people to reflect on how Covid didn\u2019t define their loved one,\u201d Wagner said. \u201cCovid was so polarizing, and yet, it\u2019s a space that doesn\u2019t have to be about Covid at all.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/18/us/covid-victims-death-memorial-website/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/22/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_05_20_us_family-heirloom-reunited-social-media", "text": "When her mother died two years ago, Celia Bashaw began dreaming about art, and not just any art. Her thoughts were fixed on an heirloom her great uncle, Chuck Perkins, had carved. Her mother and grandmother had loved it. But Bashaw couldn\u2019t find it. She knew it had been picked up after her grandmother\u2019s death when the family was going through her belongings, 15 years ago. And she knew her great uncle, who lived in Vermont, had given it away there, hoping the new owners would hold on to it. As it turned out, they sold it. So she decided to make a Facebook post in a group for Vermonters, hoping she could track down the buyers and get the piece back. \u201c(My mom) had a whole chest of photos. A bunch of photographs of everybody in the family and all the things that were really special to her.\u201d Bashaw told CNN. \u201cIn those photos, there were very good, prominent photos of the family heirloom that I was looking for. Before, I hadn\u2019t had any good photos of it. I just had a description.\u201d Bashaw attached three photos of the engraving, which portrayed a leopard lounging in a tree. The post was shared about 600 times, according to CNN affiliate WCAX. Some commenters noted the piece looked different from the one Bashaw had originally posted. Bashaw replied while it had been through some wear and tear, she was able to confirm it was the same work from her great uncle\u2019s woodburned signature on the back. \u201cIt\u2019s really a one-of-a-kind engraving, so when this man sent me a picture of it, I was like, \u2018There\u2019s no way somebody did something so identical to my uncle\u2019s carving,\u2019\u201d Bashaw said. \u201cIt\u2019s got to be the one, like there\u2019s no way I can let this go.\u201d Then, in Rutland, Vermont, Chris McKirryher and her partner, Phil Matte, saw the Facebook post and realized they had the solution to Bashaw\u2019s long-shot quest. At a yard sale in Pittsford, Vermont, the couple had bought the carving. They arranged a meeting and Bashaw made the two-and-a-half hour drive from Plattsburgh, New York, to Vermont. She told CNN McKirryher and Matte were \u201cjust so darling\u201d and she \u201cloved them immediately.\u201d Despite being nervous about meeting strangers from the internet, Bashaw found the duo were \u201cso nice and such great people.\u201d \u201cWith all the bad news and everything going around, it\u2019s good to see something really nice,\u201d Matte told WCAX, who agreed to sell it back to Bashaw. In an updated post to the Facebook group, Bashaw shared her excitement at being reunited with her great uncle\u2019s artwork, thanking her friends, family and community for sharing and helping her find the piece. \u201cI\u2019m over the moon happy (and) lucky.\u201d she wrote. Now, Bashaw feels like a piece of her mother and grandmother has come back home. \u201cIt\u2019s really nice because I don\u2019t have very many things of my mother or my grandmother and actually, it\u2019s been extremely hard for me to even find a picture of me and my grandmother together. We were so close, and it just makes me so sad.\u201d she said. \u201cHaving a piece of art that was so important to them finally be back and in my grasp\u2026 I wish I could tell my mom about it because she would just scream, just like I did \u2026 I hope she can see it now that I have it back because she was looking for it too,\u201d she added. Bashaw, an artist herself, plans to put the carving back in her grandfather\u2019s house instead of in her own. \u201cHe has the wall still where there\u2019s like, almost a frame outline of where it used to be, so it\u2019s like as soon, I put it there, it\u2019s just supposed to be there.

The House\u2019s final passage vote was 64-29, and the bill now heads back to the Senate for concurrence. Senate Bill 276\u00a0would make it a crime to give abortion medication to a person without their consent. The amendment that would classify the drugs as Schedule IV substances was added after it passed out of the Senate. The bill\u2019s sponsor, Republican state Sen. Thomas Pressly, said he proposed the legislation after his sister was given misoprostol against her will. Abortion is\u00a0already banned\u00a0in Louisiana with no exceptions for rape or incest. In a\u00a0medication abortion, mifepristone blocks the hormone progesterone, which is needed for a pregnancy to continue. A second drug,\u00a0misoprostol,\u00a0is taken within the next 24 to 48 hours. Misoprostol causes the uterus to contract, creating cramping and bleeding. Approved for use in other conditions, such as preventing stomach ulcers, the drug has been available at pharmacies for decades. The amended bill would make it a felony \u2013 punishable with up to five years in prison and fines of up to $5,000 \u2013 for anyone found in possession of the drugs without a valid prescription. The legislation includes an exemption for pregnant women in possession of mifepristone and misoprostol for their own consumption. Doctors in the state would still be able to prescribe the drugs. In Louisiana, the distribution or possession with intent to distribute Schedule IV drugs\u00a0carries a penalty\u00a0of up to 10 years in prison and fines of up to $15,000. \u201cAbsolutely unconscionable,\u201d Vice President Kamala Harris wrote on X in response to the bill\u2019s House passage Tuesday night, adding, \u201cLet\u2019s be clear: Donald Trump did this.\u201d The anti-abortion group Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America celebrated the bill\u2019s passage. \u201cAdding abortion drugs to the\u00a0controlled substance\u00a0list should be uncontroversial. Like morphine and Valium, the drugs in question will still be available for prescription for legitimate medical reasons\u00a0\u2013\u00a0like miscarriage care\u00a0\u2013\u00a0but will be harder for abusers to obtain,\u201d Caitlin Connors, the group\u2019s southern regional director, said in a news release. CNN has previously reported that the bill sparked outcry from a group of nearly 270 Louisiana physicians, health care providers and medical students, who signed a letter to Pressly expressing concerns over the reclassification. The letter, obtained by CNN, says in part, \u201cneither mifepristone nor misoprostol have been shown to have any potential for abuse, dependence, public health risk, nor high rates of adverse side effects.\u201d The letter continues that placing the drugs under Schedule IV would create \u201cthe false perception that these are dangerous drugs that require additional regulation\u201d and that they are \u201cwidely prescribed and taken safely.\u201d Pressly rebutted the letter\u2019s claims in a response he shared with CNN last week: \u201cIf enacted, this legislation would not prohibit misoprostol or even mifepristone from being prescribed or dispensed for legitimate reasons.\u201d \u201cThe doctors I have consulted with feel this provision will not harm healthcare for women,\u201d he continued. If the state Senate accepts the amended bill passed out of the House, it will next head to the desk of Republican Gov. Jeff Landry.\u00a0If Landry were to sign the bill into law, Louisiana would become the only state to classify the drugs as controlled dangerous substances.

{"id": "2024_05_18_us_dali-ship-baltimore-bridge-refloats", "text": "Almost two months after its devastating collision with a Baltimore bridge, the trapped cargo ship Dali will refloat and travel to the Baltimore marine terminal on Monday morning, officials said. After weeks of salvage operations, the Dali can finally be relocated thanks to a\u00a0series of controlled explosions\u00a0which broke apart a massive piece of the Francis Scott Bridge that had been stuck atop the ship\u2019s bow, officials said. An estimated 500-foot section of the bridge weighing 8-12 million pounds was removed from the ship. \u201cThe\u00a0refloat\u00a0and transit sequence is deliberately designed to ensure all response personnel around the M/V Dali maintain control of the vessel, from\u00a0refloat, transit to, and berthing at a local marine terminal,\u201d Unified Command said in a\u00a0news release\u00a0Saturday. Conditions permitting, the massive ship\u2019s journey will begin around 5 a.m. on Monday during peak high tide, according to Unified Command. Crews will begin prepping the ship about 18 hours before \u2013 about midday on Sunday \u2013 to take full advantage of the high tide, officials added. Up to five tugboats will then tow and push the Dali about two and a half miles to the\u00a0Seagirt Marine Terminal in Baltimore, the release said. It will take an estimated three hours to transport the 984-foot, 106,000-ton ship. Maryland Gov. Wes Moore said Sunday he expects to have the channel reopened by the end of the month. \u201cI\u2019m proud that we\u2019re on track that by the end of May we\u2019ll have that federal channel reopened,\u201d Moore said on NBC\u2019s Meet the Press. \u201cAnd within days, we\u2019re going to have that massive vessel, the\u00a0Dali, out of that federal channel.\u201d The cargo ship collided with the bridge in the early hours of March 26, killing six maintenance workers and causing most of the structure to collapse into the Patapsco River. The disaster shut down most shipping to and from the Port of Baltimore. The crash has prompted multiple investigations, including by the FBI and the US Coast Guard. The ship\u2019s 21-member crew has remained onboard since the collapse, including during the planned explosions on May 13. The ship\u2019s management company told CNN this week the crew will remain on the vessel for \u201cthe foreseeable future.\u201d According to Barbara Shipley, mid-Atlantic labor representative for the International Transport Workers\u2019 Federation, there is no plan for what the crew will do once the Dali is escorted back to port on Monday. She said the crew\u2019s visas have all expired and the union is waiting for direction from immigration authorities to figure out next steps. She told CNN the crew members are trying to keep their spirits high despite being disconnected from their friends and families. The FBI confiscated the men\u2019s cell phones as part of their ongoing investigation. \u201cIt\u2019s been since April 15, they still haven\u2019t received their cell phones,\u201d Shipley said. \u201cNo one has received their cell phones, they did receive some SIM cards, but not all.\u201d Shipley said her priority \u201cwould be to have the decisions made quickly, which crew members will need to stay behind, and\u00a0which crew members can go home, and it\u2019s important to get these gentlemen back home to their families,\u201d Shipley said. \u201cAs far as I know, no one\u2019s been charged with anything and we\u2019re holding them. They can\u2019t go home because they\u2019re still under investigation. So I would like to see the investigation be expedited so we can get these gentlemen home.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/18/us/dali-ship-baltimore-bridge-refloats/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/22/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_05_21_us_oklahoma-women-killings-buried-freezer", "text": "Two women who disappeared during a drive between Kansas and Oklahoma amid a contentious custody battle were found dead inside a freezer buried in a cattle pasture leased by one of the five suspects in their killings, according to newly released search warrants. Affidavits in the case say the remains of Veronica Butler, 27, and Jilian Kelley, 39, were discovered while authorities were investigating a fresh pile of dirt on property leased by Tad Cullum,\u00a0one of the five people charged with two counts of first-degree murder, two counts of kidnapping and one count of conspiracy to commit first-degree murder. \u201cOn April 14, 2024, a chest freezer was excavated and opened. Within the chest freezer, the bodies of Butler and Kelley were located,\u201d the search warrant states. The court documents do not reveal how Butler and Kelley were killed. Along with Cullum, police have charged Tifany Adams, the 54-year-old grandmother of Butler\u2019s children who shared custody with Butler; married couple Cole Twombly, 50, and Cora Twombly, 44; and Paul Grice, 31. Court documents allege Adams and her significant other, Cullum, engaged in a killing plot with the Twomblys motivated by a custody battle between Butler and Adams, who is the grandmother of Butler\u2019s two children. Special Agent Jason Ott with the\u00a0Oklahoma\u00a0State Bureau of Investigation testified all the suspects knew each other through \u201can anti-government group that had a religious affiliation.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0The five suspects have not yet entered pleas in the case. CNN has reached out to the suspects\u2019 attorneys for comment. Women went missing on drive to visit children The two women were driving from Hugoton, Kansas, to Four Corners, Oklahoma, for Butler\u2019s supervised visit with her children when they went missing on March 30, according to the affidavit. Their vehicle was found abandoned near a highway in Texas County, where investigators found a bloody scene scattered with \u201cevidence of a severe injury,\u201d probable cause documents state. Investigators determined Adams purchased three burner phones, all of which had pinged near where Butler\u2019s car was found and at the last known location of the women before their disappearance, according to the affidavit. Cell phone data from two of the burner phones led authorities to a pasture property rented by Cullum, where a hole had been dug and filled back in, the affidavit states. The disturbed dirt was excavated and two bodies, later identified as Butler and Kelley, were discovered, the affidavit said. The site was about 8.5 miles from where the abandoned car was found, it noted. \u201cThe state of the bodies indicated they died as a result of foul play,\u201d the affidavits stated. No further details about the condition of the bodies were provided. A stun gun was also found near the site, according to the affidavit. In their arguments to deny the suspects bail, prosecutors said the killings were \u201ccomplex and involved extensive preparation,\u201d according to the court motion. Prosecutors also noted that some of the suspects had \u201cresources to flee if given the opportunity\u201d and \u201cpose grave danger to witnesses (and) community members.\u201d More than two weeks after Butler and Kelley disappeared, a search warrant says, Grice told an acquaintance he wanted to know \u201chow long DNA would last in dirt\u201d and on clothing, a search warrant says.\u00a0An arrest affidavit released earlier\u00a0said\u00a0Grice admitted to taking part in the killing and burial of the victims. The court documents do not reveal how Butler and Kelley were killed. The defendants are scheduled to be back in court in June for a status hearing. They were ordered held in jail without bond.

{"id": "2024_05_18_us_oregon-women-deaths-indictment", "text": "A 39-year-old man was indicted by a grand jury Thursday on murder charges for the deaths of three Oregon women whose bodies were found in 2023, according to the Multnomah County District Attorney. Jesse Lee Calhoun was charged with\u00a0three\u00a0counts\u00a0of\u00a0murder\u00a0in the second degree and\u00a0three\u00a0counts\u00a0of\u00a0abuse\u00a0of\u00a0a corpse in the second degree in the\u00a0deaths\u00a0of\u00a0Charity Lynn Perry, 24, Bridget Leanne Webster, 31, and Joanna Speaks,\u00a032, according to a\u00a0news\u00a0release\u00a0from the district attorney. All three women were found dead \u201cunder suspicious circumstances\u201d on different days in April 2023, two of them in Portland and a third in neighboring Washington, according to the district attorney\u2019s office. Authorities have not provided information on how they died and it\u2019s unclear how investigators linked Calhoun to the three deaths. \u201cI want to acknowledge the families of these women,\u201d Multnomah County District Attorney Mike Schmidt said in a news conference Friday. \u201cThis community holds you in our hearts and is here to support you.\u201d Calhoun, who was arrested on an unrelated charge, is expected to be transferred to the custody of Multnomah County for arraignment, the release reads. An arraignment date has not been set yet. CNN is working to identify and contact an attorney for Calhoun. Last year, authorities in\u00a0Oregon said they believed the\u00a0deaths\u00a0of Perry and Webster were connected to the deaths of two other\u00a0Oregon women, Kristin Smith and Ashley Real. Senior Deputy District Attorney Melissa Marrero\u00a0said Friday that authorities are \u201cstill very much investigating\u201d their deaths. \u201cJust because not all\u00a0of\u00a0these girls have their\u00a0charges\u00a0have been\u00a0brought up yet\u2014for\u00a0the other families\u2014does not mean that we are not still standing beside them,\u201d a member of Perry\u2019s family said\u00a0during the\u00a0news\u00a0conference.\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019re still together, the whole way, all the way.\u201d Smith\u2019s mother spoke about the cases of her daughter and Real, saying, \u201cWe just keep going.

{"id": "2024_05_21_us_5-things-to-know-for-may-21-middle-east-severe-weather-trump-trial-climate-italy-earthquakes", "text": "ChatGPT unveiled five fictional voice assistants last year \u2014 Breeze, Cove, Ember, Juniper and Sky. Now, the company behind the AI tool is pausing one of the synthetic voices after it received criticism from actor Scarlett Johansson for being \u201cso eerily similar\u201d to hers. Here\u2019s what else you need to know to\u00a0Get Up to Speed and On with Your Day. 1. Middle East The International Criminal Court is seeking arrest warrants on charges of war crimes for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, his defense minister, and three Hamas leaders. President Joe Biden slammed the court\u2019s efforts as \u201coutrageous,\u201d saying the move puts the terrorist organization and a top US ally on equivalent footing. If the ICC were to grant an arrest warrant for Netanyahu and his defense minister, the decision would make it extremely difficult for them to travel to any of the 124 countries that are party to the court\u2019s laws, including top US allies such as Britain and Germany. Notably, France on Monday broke away from its Western allies \u2014 including the US, the UK and Italy \u2014 to express support for the ICC. 2. Severe weather More than 22 million people in the Midwest are under severe weather threats today as a relentless storm system rips through the region. Large hail, heavy winds and a few tornadoes are possible, forecasts show. The biggest area of concern is concentrated in much of Iowa, northwest Illinois, southwest Wisconsin and northern Missouri, which are under a Level 4 of 5 threat. Though they are not in the bullseye of the storm, cities including Chicago, Milwaukee, Kansas City, Omaha and Madison are also at risk of seeing severe weather. Lower chances of severe storms stretch from Texas to Michigan, including Dallas, Oklahoma City, St. Louis, Minneapolis, and Detroit. 3. Trump trial The prosecution rested its case against former President Donald Trump on Monday in his criminal hush money trial, which is nearing a conclusion as soon as next week. Trump\u2019s ex-lawyer Michael Cohen wrapped up his testimony with an admission that he stole $60,000 from the Trump Organization for a payment he made on Trump\u2019s behalf to a tech company. Analysts say this could potentially damage his standing with the jury. Prosecutors have used Cohen to try to convince jurors that Trump falsified business documents to cover up a payment to adult film actress Stormy Daniels before the 2016 election, which they claim impacted the outcome. 4. Climate Ocean water is rushing miles underneath Antarctica\u2019s \u201cDoomsday Glacier,\u201d new research shows, meaning global sea level rise projections could be significantly underestimated. The Thwaites Glacier, which already contributes 4% to global sea level rise, holds enough ice to raise sea levels by more than 2 feet. But because it also acts as a natural dam to the surrounding ice in West Antarctica, scientists have estimated its complete collapse could ultimately lead to around 10 feet of sea level rise \u2014 a catastrophe for the world\u2019s coastal communities. New data helped to create an X-ray of the glacier and could help improve the accuracy of its forecasted timeline. 5. Italy earthquakes A 4.4 magnitude earthquake struck Italy\u2019s Campi Flegrei supervolcano Monday, causing damage in the town of Pozzuoli, the epicenter, and as far away as Naples. Cracks in walls and falling cornices were reported, Italy\u2019s Fire Brigade spokesman told CNN. The quake is part of an ongoing \u201cseismic storm\u201d that has seen more than a dozen events over 2.0 magnitude in the past 48 hours. The last major eruption of the supervolcano was in 1538, which resulted in the creation of a new bay on the southern Italian coast. More than 500,000 people live in the red zone directly adjacent to Campi Flegrei, according to the Italian Civil Protection agency, which has been working this year to update evacuation plans in the event of a major disaster.

Over four surreal hours, Scheffler, 27, a man of faith who once proclaimed his \u201cidentity isn\u2019t a golf score,\u201d was charged with felony assault for allegedly dragging a police officer with his car while arriving at the course in the predawn hours. He was handcuffed and taken away in an arrest captured on video that was widely circulated on social media. He took a mug shot in an orange jumpsuit and rushed back to the course in time to shoot a stellar 5-under par that left him near the top of the leaderboard. Scheffler struggled on Saturday, knocking himself out of contention for the championship. \u201cI definitely never imagined ever going to jail, and I definitely never imagined going to jail the morning before one of my tee times for sure,\u201d Scheffler told reporters Friday. Scheffler called the incident a \u201cbig misunderstanding.\u201d \u2018I feel for them. I\u2019m sorry\u2019 One of the strangest days in the history of professional golf began to unfold at 5:07 a.m. Friday, when police said a pedestrian was struck by a shuttle bus in front of Gate 2 at Valhalla. The pedestrian was later identified as Mills. He was described by Mayor Craig Greenberg as \u201ca Louisvillian who will be greatly missed by his family and our community.\u201d Mills had been \u201cenjoying his time at Valhalla while working security,\u201d his family told CNN affiliate WDRB in a statement. \u201cHe liked to stay busy in retirement. We love him and will miss him,\u201d Mills\u2019 family said. \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate for the person that did pass away earlier today. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s getting talked about enough, or at all,\u201d golfer Collin Morikawa lamented hours after the accident. At a news conference after competing on Friday Scheffler talked immediately about Mills\u2019 family. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine what they\u2019re going through this morning,\u201d he said. \u201cOne day he\u2019s heading to the golf course to watch a tournament. A few moments later he\u2019s trying to cross the street, and now he\u2019s no longer with us. I can\u2019t imagine what they\u2019re going through. My heart \u2013 I feel for them. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d After Mills was struck, police shut down traffic outside the course. At 6:16 a.m., Scheffler pulled up to stalled traffic in a black 2024 Lexus and steered the PGA player courtesy vehicle into the opposite lane in an attempt to get around the backup. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what \u2026 happened at the time other than there was an accident,\u201d Scheffler said. \u201cI didn\u2019t know that it was fatal.\u201d On the dark and rainy morning, Det. Bryan Gillis was directing traffic into Valhalla. \u201cDetective Gillis was in the middle of the westbound lanes, in full LMPD uniform and a hi-visibility yellow reflective rain jacket,\u201d the police report read. \u201cDetective Gillis stopped subject and attempted to give instructions.\u201d Scheffler \u201crefused to comply and accelerated forward, dragging Detective Gillis to the ground,\u201d according to the police report. \u201cDetective Gillis suffered pain, swelling, and abrasions to his left wrist and knee. He was transported to the hospital for further medical treatment by emergency medical personnel. Detective Gillis\u2019 uniform pants, valued at approximately $80, were damaged beyond repair.\u201d \u2018No idea he was even Scottie Scheffler\u2019 ESPN\u2019s Jeff Darlington witnessed the encounter. He wrote on social media that Scheffler \u201ccontinued to drive about 10 to 20 yards toward the entrance\u201d before stopping. \u201cThe police officer attempted to attach himself to Scheffler\u2019s car, and Scheffler then stopped his vehicle at the entrance to Valhalla,\u201d Darlington\u00a0wrote on X. \u201cThe police officer then began to scream at Scheffler to get out of the car. When Scheffler exited the vehicle, the officer shoved Scheffler against the car and immediately placed him in handcuffs.\u201d Darlington attempted unsuccessfully to intervene. He was only several feet away when the golfer was arrested. At one point, Darlington said on ESPN, Scheffler saw the journalist and said, \u201cCan you help?\u201d Darlington on video is seen briefly following officers as they took Scheffler away. Police tell him to step back. \u201cYou need to get out of the way. Right now, he\u2019s going to jail. He\u2019s going to jail and there\u2019s nothing you can do about it,\u201d one officer told Darlington, referring to Scheffler. \u201cThe police officers around the patrol car in which Scottie Scheffler was in had no idea he was even Scottie Scheffler,\u201d Darlington said on air. \u201cI say that because one police officer came up to me with his pad and said \u2026 \u2018Can you tell me the name of the person who was just arrested?\u2019\u201d \u2018I was pretty rattled\u2019 Scheffler\u2019s attorney, Steven Romines, said his client was headed to the golf course early to prepare for his tee time. \u201cDue to the combination of event traffic and a traffic fatality in the area it was a very chaotic situation. He was proceeding as directed by another traffic officer and driving a marked player\u2019s vehicle with credentials visible,\u201d Romines said in a statement, referring to Scheffler. \u201cIn the confusion, Scottie is alleged to have disregarded a different officer\u2019s traffic signals resulting in these charges.\u201d Multiple eyewitnesses have said Scheffler \u201cdid not do anything wrong\u201d but drove as directed, according to Romines. \u201cHe stopped immediately upon being directed to and never at any point assaulted any officer with his vehicle,\u201d the statement reads. \u201cWe will plead not guilty and litigate this matter as needed.\u201d Scheffler \u2013 a new father who has called golf a way for him \u201cto glorify God\u201d \u2013 would be seen over the course of the day on video wearing gym shorts and a T-shirt as he was led away in handcuffs and in an orange jail shirt for his mug shot. \u201cI was pretty rattled, to say the least,\u201d Scheffler said. \u201cI was shaking for like an hour.\u201d Scheffler was booked at 7:28 a.m. Friday. He was charged with felony second-degree assault on a police officer, along with lesser charges of third-degree criminal mischief, reckless driving and disregarding signals from officers directing traffic, according to Jefferson County court records. Josh Abner, a spokesperson for the office of Jefferson County Attorney\u00a0Mike O\u2019Connell, told CNN prosecutors are \u201cstill obtaining information in the case of Mr. Scheffler and will review and proceed accordingly.\u201d Scheffler has a court hearing scheduled for Tuesday. \u201cMy situation will get handled. It was a chaotic situation and a big misunderstanding,\u201d Scheffler told reporters, declining to comment on the specifics of what happened leading up to his arrest. He sat in the back of a police car and could hear an officer trying to figure out his identity. \u201cAt no point did I try to name-drop myself,\u201d Scheffler said. The golfer said \u201ca nice chat\u201d with the officer who drove him to the jail helped calm his nerves. At the jail at one point he asked the same officer, \u201c\u2018Hey, excuse me, can you just come hang out with me for a few minutes so I can calm down.\u2019 I was never angry. I was just in shock.\u201d He got ready to play while in police custody Scheffler recalled some officers cracking jokes about how he ended up behind bars before his tee time at the PGA, one of golf\u2019s four major tournaments. He said he looked out from his cell at one point and saw himself getting arrested on ESPN. \u201cI did spend some time stretching in a jail cell. That was a first for me. That was part of my warmup,\u201d he said. \u201cI started going through my routine and I tried to get my heart rate down as much as I could.\u201d Later that morning, an officer came to the holding cell and said, \u201cLet\u2019s go\u2026 Get ready,\u201d motioning for Scheffler to roll up his mat. \u201cI poked my head at the TV and I was like, \u2018Oh, I might be able to get there. We\u2019ll see how bad the traffic is getting in and out,\u2019\u201d Scheffler said. Just before his 10:08 a.m. tee time, Scheffler walked down to the tee box holding an umbrella under a light rain.  Chants of \u201cScottie! Scottie! Scottie!\u201d broke out among the spectators. \u201cFree Scottie!\u201d one man yelled, eliciting cheers from the crowd. Scheffler struck his first shot of the day with a crisp click of the club, sending the ball soaring toward the cloudy sky and unleashing applause and another round of cheers from the spectators. Some had scrawled the words \u201cFree Scottie\u201d with markers on their shirts. After 18 holes and his move up the leaderboard, he summed up his feelings at the news conference. \u201cIt was nice to be able to get inside the ropes,\u201d he said, \u201cand do what I love to do.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/19/us/scottie-scheffler-arrest-pga-championship/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/22/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_05_21_media_israel-gaza-live-camera-shut-down", "text": "In a sharp reversal,\u00a0Israel\u00a0said\u00a0Tuesday\u00a0it\u00a0would\u00a0return camera\u00a0and broadcast\u00a0equipment it\u00a0had seized from The Associated\u00a0Press\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0southern Israeli city\u00a0of\u00a0Sderot\u00a0on Tuesday\u00a0after the action prompted swift backlash from US officials and press groups. In a statement late Tuesday, Israel\u2019s Communications Minister Shlomo Karhi said that he\u00a0\u201chas ordered that the equipment be returned to the\u00a0AP news agency,\u201d\u00a0because\u00a0the Israeli\u00a0\u201cMinistry of Defense requested to re-examine the matter of broadcasts from sensitive locations and their effect on the risk of our forces.\u201d Earlier in the day, the Associated Press said Israeli authorities had shut down its live camera feed showing Gaza and seized its equipment in what it decried as an \u201cabusive use by the Israeli government of the country\u2019s new foreign broadcasters law.\u201d \u201cThe Associated Press decries in the strongest terms the actions of the Israeli government,\u201d the non-profit news collective said in a statement. \u201cWe urge the Israeli authorities to return our equipment and enable us to reinstate our live feed immediately so we can continue to provide this important visual journalism to thousands of media outlets around the world.\u201d Karhi said that the AP feed was cut and equipment seized because the AP was providing Al Jazeera with content after the Qatari-based network was banned in the country. The Israeli military regularly classifies areas around Gaza as \u201cclosed military zones,\u201d restricting movement there. The AP\u2019s live feed provided a view of actions in Gaza, where no independent journalists are able to operate because of Israeli and Egyptian restrictions on entry to the strip. The Israeli government\u2019s decision to return broadcasting equipment to the AP came after the White House expressed concerns to the Netanyahu-led government, a White House official told CNN. \u201cAs soon as we learned about the reports, the White House and the State Department immediately engaged with the Government of Israel at high levels to express our serious concern and ask them to reverse this action, which they have publicly committed to do,\u201d National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson told CNN. \u201cThe free press is an essential pillar of democracy and members of the media, including AP, do vital work that must be respected.\u201d The Associated Press applauded the Israeli Ministry of Communications\u2019 decision\u00a0to return its equipment but said it remained concerned about the law at the center of the action. \u201cWhile we are pleased with this development, we remain concerned about the Israeli government\u2019s use of the foreign broadcaster law and the ability of independent journalists to operate freely in Israel.\u201d Earlier, the Foreign Press Association voiced its alarm about the shutdown and confiscation. \u201cIsrael\u2019s move today is a slippery slope. Israel could block other international news agencies from providing live footage of Gaza. It also could allow Israel to block media coverage of virtually any news event on vague security grounds,\u201d the FPA said in a statement. The move comes weeks after\u00a0Israel shut down Al Jazeera\u2019s operations\u00a0in the country, raiding the news outlet\u2019s offices and seizing its communication equipment, prompting swift condemnation from the United Nations and rights groups over Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s moves to restrict press freedoms. The law approved by Israel\u2019s parliament last month gives the prime minister and the communications minister the authority to \u201ctemporarily\u201d order the closure of foreign networks operating in Israel that are deemed a threat to national security. News organizations could be banned for a 45-day period, although the government can renew the ban for additional 45-day periods. The law itself is also technically temporary and will expire on July 31 or earlier if an emergency declaration due to the war is canceled. Several legal challenges to the law are pending in Israeli courts. The Israeli Supreme Court recently declined to issue an emergency injunction against the law filed by The Association for Civil Rights in Israel, although a hearing is expected to be held on the challenge by June 6. The group said in its petition filed in early April that the law \u201cviolates freedom of expression, the right to information and freedom of the press,\u201d and \u201ctramples on the principles of the rule of law and the independence of the judiciary, since it includes an \u201coverride clause\u201d that prevents the court from overturning an illegal decision.\u201d Another legal challenge has been filed in the Tel Aviv District Court. In an earlier statement, Karhi had accused the AP of violating its new law by providing a feed to its thousands of news clients, including Al Jazeera. The confiscated equipment included a camera, tripod, two microphones and transmission equipment, the statement said. The press freedom group Reporters Without Borders condemned Israel\u2019s decision to seize the equipment. \u201cAfter having banned Al Jazeera, Israel is lashing out at the AP,\u201d it said in a statement. \u201cRSF denounces the seizure of the news outlet\u2019s camera and the interruption of the continuous feed that films Gaza under the pretext that these images are supplying, among others, Al Jazeera.\u201d The Union of Israeli Journalists also condemned the act, calling it \u201ca serious threat to press freedom and democracy.\u201d Israel opposition leader Yair Lapid also denounced the seizure as \u201can act of madness.\u201d \u201cThis is not Al Jazeera, this is an American media outlet that has won 53 Pulitzer Prizes,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cThis government behaves as if it has decided to make sure at any cost that Israel will be outcast all over the world. They went mad.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/21/media/israel-gaza-live-camera-shut-down/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/22/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_05_21_politics_mar-a-lago-documents-walt-nauta-donald-trump", "text": "Months before Donald Trump was indicted for mishandling classified documents, a federal judge said that investigators had \u201cstrong evidence\u201d that the former president \u201cintended\u201d to hide classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago\u00a0resort, according to newly released court documents. Judge Beryl Howell cited, among other things, the discovery of additional\u00a0classified documents found at Mar-a-Lago months after the FBI\u2019s search of the property in the summer of 2022. The records included a\u00a0\u201cmostly empty\u201d folder marked as\u00a0\u201cClassified Evening Summary\u201d that was found in the former president\u2019s bedroom, as well as four other documents with classification markings found in his post-presidential office at the resort. \u201cNotably, no excuse is provided as to how the former president could miss the classified-marked documents found in his own bedroom at Mar-a-Lago,\u201d Howell\u00a0wrote in March 2023. The ruling was among hundreds of pages of previously sealed filings that were publicly docketed Tuesday in the criminal classified documents case against Trump. Included as well were new images of Walt Nauta, Trump\u2019s personal aide, moving boxes around Mar-a-Lago room before the a Trump attorney was to review the boxes for classified materials sought by a subpoena. Prosecutors say\u00a0Nauta moved boxes around as part of an alleged conspiracy to conceal classified material from federal investigators. Nauta has been charged alongside Trump and Mar-a-Lago property manager Carlos De Oliveira in the case, facing charges of mishandling sensitive or classified materials and obstruction.\u00a0 All three have pleaded\u00a0not guilty. The photos of Nauta, which appear to be screenshots of surveillance footage, are dated June 1, 2022 \u2013 shortly before the Trump attorney was slated to canvass the storage room for any documents with classified markings to be returned to the federal government. The case against Trump, brought last summer, is currently in front of Judge Aileen Cannon in Fort Pierce, Florida. Cannon is a Trump appointee. Judge said that Trump used his attorney as a \u2018front man\u2019 to obstruct probe Trump\u2019s defense team is seeking to throw out parts of the prosecutors\u2019 case \u2013 including all the evidence seized from Mar-a-Lago and obtained from his former attorney Evan Corcoran, according to the filings in federal court in South Florida. Trump\u2019s team argues that the warrant for the search wasn\u2019t valid because of the way an FBI agent described the agency\u2019s thinking to a magistrate judge. They are also contesting Howell\u2019s 2023 ruling ordering\u00a0Corcoran to provide testimony and produce documents that he had previously withheld from the grand jury investigating the matter. Howell, an appointee of Barack Obama, said at the time that prosecutors had\u00a0\u201csufficient evidence to show that the former president\u201d used Corcoran as \u201ca \u2018front m[a]n\u2019 to obstruct the government\u2019s investigation and perpetuate the former president\u2019s unlawful retention of any classified documents contained in boxes transferred from the White House.\u201d Corcoran played a pivotal role in the investigation into the classified documents, as he was the attorney who was tasked with finding and producing documents with classified markings at Trump\u2019s Florida resort. In the criminal case filed last year, prosecutors say there was conspiracy led by Trump to move boxes of government records from the storage room before Corcoran searched for it for classified materials. Corcoran is referred to as \u201cPerson 18\u201d in Howell\u2019s ruling but can be identified based on what\u2019s known about the case. Among the topics Howell ordered Corcoran to testify about was a June 24, 2022, phone call he had with Trump \u2013 the same day investigators subpoenaed surveillance footage from Mar-a-Lago.\u00a0She also ordered the production of 88 documents that had been withheld under attorney-client privilege. Howell\u00a0recounted Trump\u2019s actions over the course of several months while the federal government sought to retrieve the sensitive documents taken from the\u00a0White House. Trump \u201cdeliberately curtailed his staff\u2019s efforts to comply\u201d with the National Archives\u2019\u00a0initial efforts to retrieve the documents, she wrote. \u201cThe former president\u2019s misdirection of NARA was apparently a dress rehearsal for his actions in response to the May 11, 2022 subpoena,\u201d Howell said. Twenty-one of the 32 national security documents Trump is accused of criminally mishandling were in the former president\u2019s possession August 8, 2022, the date of the Mar-a-Lago FBI search. That means that Trump\u2019s team in this newly available motion to suppress is seeking to cut out from the case those 21 documents\u2013and thus their related charges\u2013and the hundreds of other classified records around them, plus the part of the case accusing Trump of obstruction of justice that is built around Corcoran. Guidelines for FBI\u2019s search at Mar-a-Lago unsealed Also unsealed Tuesday was a law enforcement document outlining how the FBI was authorized to search Mar-a-Lago. The document, called a law enforcement operations order, explains what agents were permitted to bring with them when they searched Trump\u2019s estate and how they were allowed to operate as part of the search. It also includes boilerplate language from the\u00a0Justice Department manual\u00a0about use of force, including the limited circumstances in which agents are authorized to use deadly force. Though the language is standard and directly from the department\u2019s manual, Trump quickly took to social media Tuesday to decry the 2022 document as having \u201cauthorized\u201d deadly force. \u201cWOW! I just came out of the Biden Witch Hunt Trial in Manhattan, the \u2018Icebox,\u2019 and was shown Reports that Crooked Joe Biden\u2019s DOJ, in their Illegal and UnConstitutional Raid of Mar-a-Lago, AUTHORIZED THE FBI TO USE DEADLY (LETHAL) FORCE,\u201d Trump said in a\u00a0post on Truth Social. \u201cNOW WE KNOW, FOR SURE, THAT JOE BIDEN IS A SERIOUS THREAT TO DEMOCRACY. HE IS MENTALLY UNFIT TO HOLD OFFICE \u2014 25TH AMENDMENT!\u201d \u201cThe FBI followed standard protocol in this search as we do for all search warrants, which includes a standard policy statement limiting the use of deadly force. No one ordered additional steps to be taken and there was no departure from the norm in this matter,\u201d the FBI said in a statement. Much of the plan includes traditional practices by the FBI when executing a warrant \u2013 like how agents are required to have their standard issued weapon, ammunition and credentials while on duty. Other parts, however, show the lengths that the bureau went to to accommodate the former president, including instructions for commanding agents to wear \u201cunmarked polo or collared shirts\u201d and to keep their \u201claw enforcement equipment concealed,\u201d as well as references to their efforts to coordinate with US Secret Service to create a smooth process for entering the Florida club.

{"id": "2024_05_21_food_mar-jac-plant-poultry-death", "text": "Children have again been found working at a Mar-Jac Poultry slaughterhouse, according to the US Department of Labor. The latest discovery in Alabama comes less than a year after a teen worker was killed at a company facility in Mississippi. In a civil complaint filed May 7, the DOL said that investigators at its wage and hour division \u201cdiscovered oppressive child labor at [Mar-Jac\u2019s] poultry processing facility, namely children working on the kill floor deboning poultry and cutting carcasses.\u201d The complaint added that \u201cthe children had been working at the facility for months.\u201d Mar-Jac operates facilities in Mississippi, Alabama, and Georgia. The DOL\u2019s recent allegation follows an incident last year in which a teen died at a Mar-Jac facility in Mississippi. According to Mar-Jac Poultry Alabama\u2019s website, \u201cMar-Jac Poultry does not sell to the general public, individual restaurants or convenience stores. We sell primarily to wholesale distributors and various national fast food establishments.\u201d It didn\u2019t list which fast food companies it supplied. A DOL spokesperson told CNN Tuesday that \u201cthe wage and hour division has multiple ongoing investigations of Mar-Jac plants in Alabama and Mississippi.\u201d Federal labor law bans children from certain jobs in slaughterhouses and meat packaging plants, including using or cleaning machinery, because of the hazardous conditions. In the May complaint, the Labor department said Mar-Jac had employed \u201cseveral minors under the age of 18 in the particularly hazardous occupations of working on the kill floor.\u201d The jobs included \u201changing poultry along fast-moving machine lines, de-boning poultry, and cutting poultry carcasses.\u201d The complaint added that products coming out of the facility through the end of the month are \u201ctainted by child labor,\u201d making them \u201chot goods\u201d under the Fair Labor Standards Act. That means Mar-Jac has been \u201cunjustly enriched, accruing substantial ill-gotten gains,\u201d by shipment of these goods in violation of labor law, the complaint said. \u201cMar-Jac will continue to vigorously defend itself and expects to prevail in this matter,\u201d according to a company statement sent to CNN. \u201cMar-Jac is committed to complying with all relevant laws, including but not limited to the child labor regulations, and already has taken affirmative steps to go beyond what the regulations require.\u201d The workers in question had given the company documents showing they were over 18, according to the statement, which noted that Mar-Jac has a policy against hiring minors. The allegations come after a 16-year-old worker was killed at a Mar-Jac processing plant in Mississippi in July. He was the second employee who died while working at the facility in just over two years. Mar-Jac Poultry told CNN at the time that the teen died from injuries suffered in what it described as an \u201caccident.\u201d The company added that the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, which reviews workplace injuries among other labor issues, was investigating the incident with the \u201cfull support and cooperation of the company.\u201d Earlier this year, the DOL proposed a $212,646 fine against the processor. When asked about the status of the request by CNN, the spokesperson said that the department can\u2019t offer further comment as its investigations are ongoing. The Labor Department has lately been trying to crack down on incidents of child labor, especially at meatpacking facilities. In February 2023, the Department of Labor and Health and Human Services said that they were increasing efforts to fight child labor. The DOL noted at the time that it had seen a 69% increase in the illegal employment of children by companies. A janitorial company was recently fined $649,000 after an investigation found it hired minors for dangerous jobs cleaning slaughterhouses. Fayette Janitorial Service had employed at least 24 children, including those as young as 13, according to the DOL investigation. The minors had been working overnight shifts at two separate slaughter facilities, according to the DOL. \u2014 CNN\u2019s Parija Kavilanz and Amy Simonson contributed to this report.

{"id": "2024_05_21_us_grizzly-bear-attack-wyoming", "text": "A grizzly bear attack on a man in Wyoming\u2019s Grand Teton National Park is the second grizzly bear attack in less than a week. Park officials said they received a report on Sunday about \u201ca 35-year-old male visitor from Massachusetts who was seriously injured by a bear in the area of the Signal Mountain Summit Road,\u201d the National Park Service said in a news release Monday. Following an investigation, park officials have determined \u201cthe incident was a surprise encounter with two grizzly bears.\u201d The earlier bear attack occurred in the Canadian Rockies. The man, who was airlifted by helicopter to a nearby ambulance, is in stable condition, according to the park service, and expected to make a full recovery. With news of the attack still fresh, the park has closed both Signal Mountain Summit Road and Signal Mountain Trail to the general public. On Thursday, a grizzly bear was found dead in Elkford, British Columbia, after inflicting \u201csignificant injuries\u201d on a 36-year-old man who used a firearm to defend himself. \u201cOfficers are confident that they located the bear involved in the attack. The bear succumbed to its wounds,\u201d the British Columbia Conservation Officer Services said. CNN was able to confirm Sunday the man was also airlifted to a hospital but no update on his condition was given. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police initially reported he sustained broken bones and lacerations. Adult grizzly bears begin to come out of hibernation in springtime as the winter snowpack dissipates, the park service said in an informational release in April. \u201cThey search for available foods and often scavenge animals that died during the winter.\u201d Since the first grizzly bear sighting in Grand Teton on March 26, what is called \u201cbear season\u201d has begun. \u201cAll of Teton County is now in occupied grizzly bear habitat,\u201d the park service said.

Union City Police arrested Atlanta police officer Koby Minor Wednesday, according to a news release from the Atlanta Police Department. Minor resigned from the department later that day. Minor was charged with murder and aggravated assault after shooting his Lyft driver, a release from the Union City Police Department said. The Lyft driver was identified by authorities as Reginald Folks and was pronounced dead at the scene. The affidavit said he was shot in the head. \u201cOur hearts are with Mr. Folks\u2019 loved ones as they confront this unspeakable tragedy, and we have reached out to offer our support during this difficult time,\u201d Lyft said in a statement shared with CNN. \u201cWe stand ready to assist law enforcement with any investigation and have permanently banned the rider\u2019s account from the Lyft community.\u201d A passerby who saw Minor waving his hand on the side of Stonewall Tell Road in Union City called police, the affidavit said. Minor told the passerby he believed he was getting kidnapped by Folks, according to the affidavit. Minor recounted to police he had gotten in the Lyft after leaving another police officer\u2019s home that evening. He told officers Folks was talking on the phone through his car\u2019s Bluetooth in an unknown language and Minor said he \u201cheard what he thought was another voice in his ear talking to him but did not say what the voice said.\u201d Minor told police he then asked Folks to stop the car but he continued to drive. When they came to a red light, Minor tried to unlock and open the door but he could not get the door open. He then added Folks turned around and attempted to reach in the back seat, which is when Minor shot him. He fired approximately three shots, broke the window of the vehicle, and exited. Minor is being held in Fulton County Jail. CNN has been unable to determine if Minor has obtained legal representation. The Atlanta Police Department hired Minor in 2018 and was on unpaid administrative leave during the time of his arrest this week, the department statement said. He was previously arrested in Milton in December 2023, and he was relieved of his department-issued firearm as a result, according to the statement, which did not specify the nature of that arrest.

{"id": "2024_05_21_politics_us-gaza-pier-aid-not-delivered", "text": "None of the aid that has been unloaded from the temporary pier the US constructed off the coast of Gaza has been delivered to the broader Palestinian population,\u00a0as the US\u00a0works with the UN and Israel to identify\u00a0safe\u00a0delivery routes inside the enclave, the Pentagon said on Tuesday. Several desperate Gazans intercepted trucks delivering aid from the pier over the weekend, leading the UN to suspend the delivery operations until the logistical challenges are resolved. The US\u00a0is\u00a0working\u00a0with Israel and the United Nations to establish \u201calternative routes\u201d for the safe delivery of the 569 tons of aid transported to Gaza since last week, Pentagon spokesperson Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder said on Tuesday. Asked\u00a0whether\u00a0any of the\u00a0aid has been delivered to the people of Gaza, Ryder said, \u201cAs of today, I do not believe so.\u201d\u00a0He added that aid had been held in an assembly area on shore, but as of Tuesday had begun getting moved to warehouses for distribution throughout Gaza as alternative routes have been established. A US official told CNN that the Defense Department and UN are still working to determine\u00a0how much aid can be held at he staging area inside Gaza at any given time. The amount of aid getting to the Gaza shoreline from its initial staging area in Cyprus has also fallen short of initial Pentagon estimates. Since Friday, more than\u00a0569 metric tons of humanitarian assistance have been delivered through the temporary pier, called JLOTS,\u00a0or Joint Logistics Over-the-Shore, to the shore of Gaza to be distributed by humanitarian partners, Ryder said. But\u00a0Adm.\u00a0Brad Cooper, the commander of the US Naval Forces Central Command, said last week that the US hoped to initially transport 500 tons of aid per day via the pier, and scale up as time went on. Over the weekend, as trucks began moving the aid delivered off the floating pier,\u00a0CNN reported that a group of\u00a0men in Gaza intercepted the aid,\u00a0saying\u00a0they did not trust that\u00a0it\u00a0was\u00a0actually meant\u00a0for the Palestinian people. \u201cI have doubts,\u201d Mounir Ayad, a\u00a0Gaza resident, told CNN near the\u00a0pier. \u201cI don\u2019t understand this floating pier or what it indicates and what its purpose is. They say it\u2019s for\u00a0aid, but people are apprehensive. Is this\u00a0aid\u00a0or something else? We know that the US has never supported the Palestinian cause, so it\u2019s implausible that it\u2019s giving us\u00a0aid\u00a0without something in return.\u201d Ryder acknowledged on Tuesday that some initial aid brought into Gaza was \u201cintercepted by some people who took that aid off those vehicles.\u201d \u201cFully appreciating the desperation, but also fully appreciating the fact that it is very important that this aid get to the people who need it most, that\u2019s going to continue to be the focus. So I understand, you know, the focus on why is this not working, or why is that not working, but what we\u2019re focused on is how we can work to ensure that the Palestinian people get the aid.\u201d The Pentagon\u00a0said in April\u00a0that the goal was to deliver roughly 500 tons of aid \u2014\u00a0amounting to 90 truckloads \u2014\u00a0per day to the starving population of Gaza, with the intent of working up to 150 trucks daily. The pier was finally\u00a0anchored to Gaza\u00a0last week as the humanitarian situation in the\u00a0enclave\u00a0has only worsened. Sonali Korde, assistant to the administrator of\u00a0the US Agency for International Development\u2019s\u00a0Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance, said last week that conditions in Gaza \u201chave not improved and in the past two weeks we have seen a vital border crossing close, and at a time when it is critical we see more aid move. Across Gaza, 2.2 million people,\u00a0the entire population, is facing acute food insecurity.\u201d The US has faced\u00a0a number of challenges\u00a0with the pier, including planning around Israel\u2019s operations in Rafah which could raise security concerns; early issues with establishing who would transport the aid from the pier into Gaza, as the US has repeatedly said no US troops would have boots on the ground; and logistical challenges like sea and weather conditions that could continue to limit the ability to use it. Ryder said Tuesday that the US is continuing to push for aid to get in other ways, including through land routes. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin is continuing to have conversations with his Israeli counterpart regarding the effort to get aid through land crossings, including through Rafah, he said. When White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan met with Israeli officials as part of his trip to the Middle East over the weekend, the Israelis presented their latest thinking about a potential Rafah incursion during which the US side asked a lot of \u201chard questions,\u201d according to a senior administration official. This person noted that the two sides will continue those discussions but that the Israelis have been incorporating US feedback and concerns as they continue to work through those plans. The official added that both sides share the joint goal of destroying Hamas. As part of the discussions with the Israelis, US officials also made a series of \u201cspecific requests\u201d with regard to humanitarian aid, which they have agreed to implement, according to the official. \u201cI thought the the conversations were, were quite constructive and now we\u2019re looking to see some of what was agreed unfold here over the coming days,\u201d the official said. Just Tuesday, according to this person, over 370 pallets of aid were distributed in Gaza. The US has also made a number of air drops of humanitarian aid into Gaza in partnership with the Royal Jordanian Air Force. It\u2019s unclear with what regularity those will continue; Ryder said Tuesday it is an \u201coption we have available to us\u201d but he declined to say\u00a0whether\u00a0that effort would continue \u201cwell into the future.\u201d The last humanitarian air drop announced by US Central Command was conducted on May 9. \u201cThis is not a sole US military effort, it\u2019s an interagency effort. It\u2019s an international effort. And we understand the desperate need of the Palestinian people right now,\u201d Ryder said of efforts to get aid into Gaza.\u00a0 \u201cAnd we\u2019re going to continue to work to get them what they need.\u201d This story has been updated with additional information.

Despite the impressive achievements, Tillman remembers turning to her mother and saying, \u201cI think I want to pursue a doctorate degree.\u201d Her mother,\u00a0Jimalita\u00a0Tillman, was surprised. They were in the middle of the Covid-19 pandemic. And Dorothy was a year into launching a science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics (STEAM) camp startup, and she was looking for funding for the organization. She was busy. \u201cI was just like, \u2018why?\u2019 I thought you were done,\u201d Jimalita told CNN. But after Dorothy explained that her mission was to positively impact young people when it came to their mental health, Jimalita understood and lent her support. Fast-forward two years, when 17-year-old Dorothy\u00a0successfully delivered her dissertation. Now, at 18, she is officially Dr. Dorothy Jean Tillman after walking at Arizona State University\u2019s College of Health Solutions convocation on May 8. Jimalita\u00a0told CNN that seeing her daughter achieve so much is humbling. \u201cI knew what it took for her to go through that. She had to sacrifice a lot. A lot of her fears and going through different things during the pandemic,\u201d she said. \u201cShe emerged as a leader without fear, showing them how to navigate online schooling.\u201d From a young age, Dorothy excelled in her academic pursuits. By age 7, she was already doing high school work. At that point, she started to take college level module tests and apply the credits toward higher education. \u201cIt was always a very hard thing to kind of stomach mentally being so young. When you get out of college, you\u2019re thinking, \u2018what do I do next?\u2019 Now I am able to sit in the comfortability of being a teenager and being OK with the fact that I don\u2019t have to figure out what comes next,\u201d Dorothy said. She studied integrated behavioral health at Arizona State University. For her dissertation, she explored the stigma that prevents university students from getting mental health treatment. In addition to her school work, Dorothy also devotes her time to running the\u00a0Dorothy Jeanius\u00a0STEAM Leadership Institute, which inspires hundreds of underserved young people in Chicago, as well as abroad in countries like Ghana and South Africa, to pursue STEAM careers. The program includes guest speakers and open conversations around each of the five areas of STEAM. \u201cWe just want to provide them with all the resources possible and the best foundation to be able to start walking on that pathway to their dreams,\u201d she said. While so many people marvel at the success she\u2019s achieved, Tillman says she is still a normal teen who spends time with family and friends. She gives credit to her mother as one of her greatest motivators. \u201cI definitely couldn\u2019t have gotten this far without her, like she\u2019s definitely the best teammate, the best supporter,\u201d she said. Another inspiration for Tillman is her grandmother, former Chicago alderwoman Dorothy Tillman, who worked alongside Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. during the civil rights movement. After graduating from ASU, Tillman hopes to continue developing her camps and start applying her studies on integrated behavioral health into her work. There is a potential for franchising the camps one day so more kids gain something, she says.\u00a0She also hopes to work more with kids in Africa. \u201cI\u2019ve been focusing on my studies a lot and I don\u2019t go nearly as much as I should,\u201d Tillman said. \u201cNow I\u2019m glad to have the time for things like that.\u201d While she\u00a0has achieved a lot at her age, Tillman tells people it\u2019s all about having\u00a0a supportive family around her. \u201cIt\u2019s teamwork that makes the dream work,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is a village that builds the land.

On Monday, the body of a fallen climber was discovered on Alaska\u2019s Denali \u2013 the tallest peak in North America, according to Denali National Park and Preserve rangers. The climber was found by a mountaineering patrol after a concerned family member contacted rangers Sunday to say they had not heard from the climber for several days, according to an NPS news release. The climber, who was attempting a solo climb of Denali, had been regularly checking-in with family through a satellite communication device. \u201cMountaineering rangers patrolling the upper mountain quickly located the climber\u2019s empty tent at the top of the 16,200-foot ridge,\u201d the news release reads. After conducting interviews with other climbers and gathering location data from the climber\u2019s satellite device, rangers determined that the climber had last been seen on Wednesday, May 15, while traversing the 17,200-foot plateau to Denali Pass at 18,200 feet. \u201cData indicated the device had not changed location since Thursday, May 16, suggesting a fall from the Denali Pass traverse took place on that day,\u201d NPS said. The climber was found on Denali\u2019s West Buttress route and was confirmed deceased. \u201cRanger patrol then secured the climber in place and returned to high camp,\u201d the release said. \u201cRecovery efforts will be attempted when weather conditions allow.\u201d The park service has not released the identity of the fallen climber. \u201cSince 1980, at least fourteen climbers have died in falls along this treacherous section of the West Buttress route, including the soloist,\u201d the park service said. Also this week, a hiker in Oregon died after officials say she went off-trail while hiking the Oneonta Trail in the Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area, west of Portland.

The man, Dale Chorman, was with a friend when the pair spotted a female moose and her two newborn calves in the city of Homer, the Alaska Department of Public Safety said. \u201cDale was with another adult male and they were attempting to take photos of two newborn moose calves when the cow moose attacked Dale,\u201d agency spokesperson Austin McDaniel told CNN in an email Tuesday. An\u00a0initial report\u00a0says the moose charged the two men and kicked one of them. The other man was not injured, McDaniel said. Chorman\u2019s body was sent to the Alaska State Medical Examiner\u2019s Office for an autopsy. CNN has sought more information from the medical examiner. Chorman\u2019s relatives are now remembering him as a loving father, husband and friend. However, they also are urging people to not blame the moose for his death. \u201cThe moose, obviously, is not at fault. To the concerned neighbors, I say \u2014 quell your primate spear rattling. The ungulate mother need not die. She was just protecting her offspring,\u201d Dale\u2019s son, Nathan Chorman, wrote in a statement, according to CNN affiliate KTUU. Dale was experienced around wildlife, according to his family. He\u2019d said the previous day that the brush was thick enough to come across a wild animal by accident, Nathan wrote. \u201cI\u2019m sure Dale was surprised too. On a given day, nobody expects to die on their own property doing something routine, even when the routine is fairly dangerous. But he would have accepted this outcome,\u201d Nathan\u2019s statement reads. \u201cThis was not a hapless fool stumbling into danger \u2014 this was a person who went out looking for a great photo, knowing the risks, and got caught in a dangerous moment,\u201d the son wrote. A small adult female moose can weigh up to 800 pounds and be up to 6 feet tall, according to the\u00a0Alaska Department of Fish and Game. While in the company of her calves, a female moose will not hesitate to attack should a person come near them, McDaniel said. \u201cCow moose with calves are known to be relentless in their efforts to defend their calves from perceived threats,\u201d McDaniel said. \u201cThe Alaska wildlife troopers encourage Alaskans to not approach moose calves to take photos or attempt to pet them as there is likely a cow moose nearby.\u201d Homer is about 220 miles south of Anchorage on Alaska\u2019s Kenai Peninsula.

{"id": "2024_05_16_us_loay-alnaji-paul-kessler-death-will-stand-trial", "text": "A man charged with manslaughter in the death of a Jewish protester he\u2019s accused of striking during dueling demonstrations over the Israel-Hamas war last year will stand trial, a judge ruled Wednesday, according to prosecutors. Prosecutors allege Loay Alnaji hit the 69-year-old protester, Paul Kessler, with a megaphone before Kessler fell and struck his head on the pavement of a street corner in Thousand Oaks, California, in November, the Ventura County District Attorney\u2019s Office said in a release. Kessler, who was demonstrating in support of Israel, later died at a hospital. Medical examiners determined he died from blunt force trauma caused by the blow from the megaphone and his fall, prosecutors said. Alnaji is facing involuntary manslaughter and battery charges after an investigation police say was complicated by conflicting statements from pro-Israel and pro-Palestinian witnesses. He has pleaded not guilty, the district attorney\u2019s office said last year. The tense confrontation happened during one of many protests sweeping US cities in the weeks after Hamas attacked Israel on October 7, killing an estimated 1,200 people and kidnapping about 200 others. Israel\u2019s ongoing military response in Gaza has so far killed more than 35,000 Palestinians, according to the Ministry of Health in\u00a0Gaza, and is fueling a worsening humanitarian crisis. During a two-day hearing, prosecutors presented evidence against Alnaji, including DNA analysis of blood on the megaphone, which matches Kessler, and video and audio taken on Kessler\u2019s phone in the moments leading to his fall, the district attorney\u2019s office said. Prosecutors have yet to find evidence to indicate Alnaji committed a hate crime, the release said. \u201cWhile antisemitic hate speech was heard at the November 5, 2023, rally, there is no evidence those words were said by\u00a0Alnaji,\u201d the release said. Alnaji\u2019s attorney, Ron Bamieh, told CNN his client was acting in self-defense during an altercation with the victim and said witness accounts of the incident have been \u201cinconsistent or inaccurate.\u201d \u201cThis case is a simple question of whether or not my client had the right to swat Mr.\u00a0Kessler\u2019s phone away, and as a result, hit him in the face in self-defense,\u201d Bamieh said. In November, Bamieh told CNN Kessler stuck his phone in Alnaji\u2019s face and he \u201cbrushed\u201d it away. \u201cWhen (Kessler) fell, my client is seen on the video 6 to 8 feet away from him,\u201d he added. The attorney said previously Alnaji \u201cfully cooperated with law enforcement, attempted to aid Mr. Kessler when he fell, and called 911 when he realized that Mr. Kessler was injured.\u201d While Bamieh concedes Alnaji struck the victim during the heated confrontation, he argued prosecutors were \u201caggressive\u201d in filing the case the way they did. \u201cThe prosecution is treating this as more of a publicity case and a political case than an actual criminal case.\u201d A spokesperson for the district attorney\u2019s office, Joey Buttitta, told CNN, \u201cWe pursue truth and justice based on the facts and the evidence, not politics and publicity.\u201d After he was charged, Alnaji was placed on administrative leave from his job in the Ventura County Community College District, which includes three colleges, the district said at the time. He worked at Moorpark College,\u00a0The Los Angeles Times\u00a0reported. Alnaji\u00a0is out on $50,000 bail and is scheduled for an arraignment on June 10, the district attorney\u2019s office said. He faces a maximum of four years in prison if convicted. What investigators said happened at the dueling rallies The incident took place while simultaneous rallies were being\u00a0held by two groups\u00a0identified as \u201cFreedom for Palestine\u201d and \u201cWe are Pro-Israel,\u201d according to the Ventura County Sheriff\u2019s Office. Authorities estimated between 75 and 100 people were present. Around 3:20 p.m. on November 5, the sheriff\u2019s office received multiple calls about a possible assault related to the protests at an intersection, Sheriff Jim Fryhoff has said. When deputies and medical responders arrived at the scene minutes later, they found Kessler lying on the ground, conscious and responsive, the sheriff said. Investigators determined a pro-Palestinian protester, later identified as Alnaji, had been involved in an altercation with Kessler, who at some point fell backward and hit his head on the ground, authorities said. Pro-Israel and pro-Palestinian witnesses at the scene gave contradicting accounts of who the aggressor was and how the altercation occurred, the sheriff said. A 50-year-old suspect was also interviewed at the scene, where he told deputies he had been involved in an altercation with Kessler, Fryhoff said. His home was searched by investigators the next day, the sheriff said. Authorities did not say at the time whether that suspect was Alnaji. Kessler was hospitalized in critical condition before dying from his injuries. In addition to determining his cause of death to be blunt force trauma, an autopsy revealed Kessler suffered injuries consistent with a fall, including skull fractures, brain swelling and bruising, and nonlethal injuries to his face, according to Dr. Christopher Young, Ventura County\u2019s chief medical examiner. The district attorney described Kessler as a father of one who had been married for 43 years. He worked in medical sales for \u201ca number of decades\u201d and also taught sales and marketing.

{"id": "2024_05_21_politics_fani-willis-scott-mcafee-georgia-elections", "text": "Two key figures in former President Donald Trump\u2019s election interference trial in Georgia will\u00a0fend off challengers in their elections Tuesday, CNN projects. Fani Willis, the Fulton County district attorney who is prosecuting Trump, is projected to win her Democratic primary rematch with attorney and author Christian Wise Smith. And Judge Scott McAfee, who is overseeing the former president\u2019s case, is projected to win his nonpartisan election for Fulton County Superior Court. The 2020 election interference case in Georgia was sidetracked for months over whether Willis should be disqualified\u00a0following revelations that she\u00a0had a romantic relationship with her lead prosecutor, Nathan Wade.\u00a0Willis has managed to stay\u00a0on, while\u00a0Wade\u00a0stepped down in March. An appeals court has said it will revisit the question of whether Willis should have been removed from the case. That has left the Trump case\u00a0effectively at a standstill.\u00a0A legal argument before the Supreme Court over whether\u00a0the former president\u00a0has immunity from prosecution also remains an issue in the Georgia case and may not be decided until this summer. Wise Smith, Willis\u2019 primary opponent, finished third in the 2020 Democratic primary for Fulton County district attorney. In this year\u2019s campaign, he questioned the resources that Willis\u2019 office was devoting to Trump\u2019s prosecution. Wise Smith said in a March interview with CNN\u2019s Laura Coates that it was \u201cvery unfortunate that her personal life has become so public. And you know, I feel for her in that sense.\u201d Willis will next face Republican attorney\u00a0Courtney Kramer,\u00a0who worked in\u00a0the\u00a0White House counsel\u2019s office under Trump.\u00a0Kramer, who was unopposed in the Republican primary, will be the heavy underdog against Willis in\u00a0deep-blue Fulton County, which is home to most of Atlanta.\u00a0Trump won 26% of the vote in the county in 2020, compared with Joe Biden\u2019s 73%. McAfee, meanwhile, faced criminal defense lawyer and talk radio host Robert Patillo in his nonpartisan general election Tuesday. Patillo, who describes himself as a \u201cconservative Democrat,\u201d\u00a0had criticized McAfee\u2019s handling of the decision not to remove Willis from the prosecution when details of her romantic relationship with Wade emerged. Another contender,\u00a0Tiffani Johnson, had filed to take on McAfee but was disqualified after she did not appear at a hearing challenging her eligibility. Tuesday\u2019s election was the first for McAfee, who was appointed to his job by Republican Gov. Brian Kemp in December 2022 to fill a retirement vacancy. Campaigning in Atlanta on Tuesday, McAfee told CNN he had \u201creally enjoyed kind of being out there on the trail.\u201d \u201cUsually, we are in this legal bubble, where you are just talking to lawyers, and it is a healthy thing to get out there talking to some other folks,\u201d he said. McAfee also spoke of wanting to further voters\u2019 trust in institutions. \u201cIn my little corner of the world, if I can do everything I can to instill that trust, to further that trust, that is what I try to do,\u201d the judge said. McAfee had a major fundraising advantage in his race, in part due to bipartisan support from influential figures.\u00a0Kemp and former Gov. Roy Barnes, a Democrat, were the marquee guests at a recent fundraising event for McAfee. Kemp could wind up being a witness in the Trump case. And Barnes was already a witness in the Willis disqualification issue. CNN\u2019s Ryan Young and Devon M.

{"id": "2024_05_21_tech_microsoft-ai-copilot-plus-build-2024", "text": "Microsoft\u00a0jumped headfirst into building artificial intelligence directly into its Windows operating system on Monday, announcing new AI computers that could help ramp up flagging PC sales. The developments push the company closer to its long-time goal to \u201cbuild computers that understand us versus us having to understand computers,\u201d CEO Satya Nadella told the audience at the company\u2019s annual developer conference at its Redmond, Washington headquarters. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re really close to that real breakthrough,\u201d he added. The computers, which are packed with processors that power advanced AI tools, come as PC sales have stalled for years. The company hopes the new machines will boost sales and revive excitement, particularly as AI is expected to become increasingly part of everyday life. Microsoft\u2019s new lineup of Copilot+ PCs, which feature a new Surface Pro tablet and Surface laptop, include AI tools that don\u2019t require internet connection \u2013 the AI processing occurs directly on the device The new hardware runs on OpenAI\u2019s new GPT-4o technology, which aims to turn ChatGPT into a digital personal assistant that can engage in real-time, spoken conversations and interact using text and \u201cvision.\u201d Announced last week, it can view screenshots, photos, documents or charts uploaded by users and have a conversation about them. The new hardware also plays up Microsoft\u2019s existing AI assistant called Copilot, which works across various products, including Bing and Microsoft 365. It can help with tasks such as writing, keeping track of\u00a0emails in Outlook or designing\u00a0presentations in PowerPoint. One new feature, called Recall, acts as a personal \u201ctime machine,\u201d allowing users to quickly find things from their computer, such as documents, images and websites. Another allows for real-time translation into more than 40 more languages locally on the device. The company also showed off a new tool called Team Copilot, which serves as a personal assistant, allowing it act as a meeting facilitator to create agendas or take notes on behalf of the whole team, not just an individual user. Microsoft isn\u2019t alone in its AI PC ambition. Dell and Lenovo also recently debuted AI-first PC computers under the Copilot+ AI umbrella, an emerging category that experts widely believe will become the next stage of computing. (Copilot+ is the name of the line of hardware that supports the Copilot software.) Next month, Apple is expected to announce new AI-powered tools for the iPhone and Mac at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference. \u201cOver time, AI capability will become a ubiquitous feature, but Microsoft and its partners have made a solid start,\u201d Geoff Blaber, CEO at CCS Insight, told CNN. \u201cThey will need to work hard to ensure that AI becomes a lot more than just a meaningless descriptor with a growing number of features.\u201d Microsoft\u2019s advancements also come at a time when the PC market is ripe for innovation. \u201cThis is a much-needed catalyst,\u201d Blaber added. Although the Surface line is relatively small within the overall PC market, it serves as an aspirational brand and a frontrunner in terms of innovation, according to Jitesh Ubrani, a research manager at market research firm IDC. But Microsoft\u2019s move is more reflective of a greater shift happening in the industry toward AI. In June, Apple will likely introduce generative AI \u2013 artificial intelligence that is capable of creating new output from images to text \u2013 across its iOS and Mac platforms. Reports indicate the company could unveil an AI-powered chatbot that runs on OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT technology, the same technology that underpins Microsoft\u2019s new CoPilot+ line. Still, Microsoft has already established itself as an early leader in this space with ChatGPT integrated into key products. And it appears those efforts are paying off. Last month, Microsoft reported quarterly profits of $21.9 billion, up from $18.3 billion a year ago. Revenue grew 17% year-over-year growth to $61.9 billion. Microsoft\u2019s Azure cloud business also experienced strong growth \u2013 revenue grew 31% \u2013 boosted by AI tailwinds. The company continues to go all in on AI in other ways, too. Earlier this month, Microsoft said it is pouring $3.3 billion into building a data hub in Wisconsin to train employees and manufacturers on how to best use artificial intelligence. The new center aims to create 2,300 union construction jobs and 2,000 permanent jobs over time, according to Microsoft. It also plans to use the center to train about 100,000 workers across the state.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/21/tech/microsoft-ai-copilot-plus-build-2024/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/22/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_05_16_us_pope-conservative-critics-suicidal-attitude-hnk-intl", "text": "Pope Francis has suggested that his conservative critics in the United States have a \u201csuicidal attitude,\u201d in an interview with CBS News. Asked about criticism from \u201cconservative bishops\u201d in the US who have opposed Francis\u2019\u00a0more progressive\u00a0papacy and efforts to reform the Catholic Church, the Pope paused on the word \u201cconservative,\u201d saying a conservative is \u201cone who clings to something and does not want to see beyond that. It is a suicidal attitude.\u201d There is an important difference between taking \u201ctradition into account\u201d and being \u201cclosed up inside a dogmatic box,\u201d Francis emphasized. Francis\u00a0has envisioned a merciful Catholic Church open to everyone, a \u201cfield hospital\u201d ready to bind up the wounds of a suffering humanity.\u00a0But during his pontificate, the Argentinian Pope has faced attacks from some inside the church\u00a0who see him as breaking with tradition\u00a0and have resisted his call for reform, including an embrace of LGBTQ+ Catholics. Internal backlash has also emerged to his outspokenness on the plight of migrants and need to address climate change. Some of the strongest pushback to Francis\u2019 progressive approach has come from groups in the United States.\u00a0Those who oppose Francis say they want a pope instead who lays down the law and presents doctrine in black-and-white terms. The pope has not been afraid to call out his critics, describing some of his opponents in the US as\u00a0\u201cbackwardists,\u201d\u00a0saying they have replaced faith with ideology. In recent months, Francis has taken even more assertive measures to deal with the opposition, including sanctioning\u00a0one of his most outspoken critics, US Cardinal Raymond Burke. He also removed a bishop in Tyler, Texas who had accused the pope of undermining the church\u2019s central teachings. His remarks to CBS come at a time when a spotlight has been thrown on an\u00a0extreme\u00a0socially conservative trend in the US Catholic church, highlighted by Kansas City Chiefs Kicker Harrison Butker\u2019s recent commencement address\u00a0at a Catholic school.\u00a0Butker described Pride Month as \u201cevil\u201d and suggested women would find the most fulfillment as homemakers.

{"id": "2024_05_21_cars_nissan-evs-mississippi-factory", "text": "Nissan is postponing a push to build new electric vehicles at its Canton, Mississippi, factory as sales of EVs are now growing more slowly than many industry experts had expected. EV sales in the US grew 2.6 % in the first quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, according to Kelley Blue Book. First quarter EV sales last year had outpaced 2022\u2019s by a stunning 46.4%. Many in the industry had expected interest in EVs to accelerate, not slow down. But consumers are concerned about the high prices of EVs and worried about being able to charge them easily, according to the consumer survey company JD Power. These concerns have led to recent drops in customer consideration of EVs. Currently, Nissan sells two EV models in the US, the Leaf compact hatchback and the Ariya SUV, but had announced plans to build five new EV models in Canton including two originally scheduled for production in 2025. The new models were set to include both Nissan and Infiniti vehicles. Infiniti is Nissan\u2019s luxury brand. Nissan is delaying plans to actually begin producing the vehicles in Mississippi. \u201cWe are adjusting the timeline for the introduction of these five new models to ensure we bring the vehicles to the market at the right time, prioritizing in line with customer demand and maximizing the opportunity for our brands and supplier partners,\u201d Nissan said in a statement emailed to CNN. These latest delays were previously reported by the industry newspaper Automotive News. Nissan still plans to offer a total of 19 EV models globally by 2030, a spokesperson said. Nissan previously announced it would invest $500 million in the factory to prepare it build the new electric vehicles. The factory in Canton currently employs roughly 5,000 workers and makes the Nissan Altima sedan Frontier, Titan, and Titan XD pickups.  Other automakers have also made moves to slow production of new EVs and EV batteries citing concerns about slowing consumer adoption. Last year, GM slowed down a planned ramp up in production of its Silverado EV pickup. Ford also reduced the planned size of a factory it\u2019s building to make EV batteries.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/21/cars/nissan-evs-mississippi-factory/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/22/2024", "section": "us"}}
