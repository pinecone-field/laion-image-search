{"id": "2024_07_16_us_nashville-illinois-dam-break", "text": "After water overtopped a reservoir dam and forced residents of a small Illinois city to evacuate Tuesday morning amid fears the structure could rupture, local officials now say the situation is under control. Extensive rain on Monday and Tuesday ran over the top of the dam and flooded downstream, which forced the evacuation of residents in Nashville, Illinois, said Alex Haglund, a spokesperson for the Washington County Sheriff\u2019s Office. \u201cAn estimated 200 residences were considered endanger and at risk of flooding,\u201d Haglund said in a news release. First responders helped evacuate residents in the downstream area \u2013 some of whom reported waist-high water in their homes \u2013 including one woman who required a rescue, Haglund said. \u201cWhile the immediate danger to those downstream from the dam has been managed, there are still multiple road closures in the area,\u201d the release stated, including on Interstate 64 between the Nashville and Ashley exits. Residents are encouraged to stay off the roads, if possible. Local officials had warned the rupture could happen at any moment. \u201cAttention the failure of the Nashville dam is imminent. Please evacuate your home at this time \u2026 you need evacuate now!\u201d the\u00a0Washington County Emergency Management Agency said in a hasty Facebook post Tuesday morning. Washington County was under a flash flood warning until 4:30 p.m. CT after the region received over 5 inches of rain in six hours, according to radar estimates from the National Weather Service office in St. Louis. That level of rain approaches 100-year rainfall frequency \u2013\u00a0the type of downpour statistically likely to happen only once every century \u2013 according to weather records. Extreme rainfall events like these are becoming more common, and they illustrate the effects of climate change. As the planet warms from fossil fuel pollution, the atmosphere is able to hold more moisture, which can then be released as intense rainfall. After the heavy rain Tuesday morning, another round of heavy precipitation is possible for the region overnight, with a potential break in the heaviest rain later Tuesday afternoon and evening. There have been no injuries or deaths due to this emergency. It was not known if the evacuation order is still in effect as of Tuesday early evening. Nashville \u2013 home to 3,105 people, according to the US Census Bureau \u2013 is in southeast Illinois, about 50 miles east of St. Louis. On July 26, 2022, a secondary dam on the city reservoir was breached after over four inches of rain fell near Nashville in less than 12 hours, causing a 6-foot breach and flooding nearly 40 acres of land between Ashley, Illinois, and Nashville, according to Washington County records.

Albino Herrera Espinoza, 52, and his daughter, Beatriz Herrera, 23, were visiting the southeast Utah park from their home in Green Bay, Wisconsin, and hiking the Syncline Loop Trail where the temperature at the time was over 100 degrees, according to the National Park Service. Espinoza is the owner of El Sarape, a well-known Mexican restaurant in Green Bay, CNN affiliate WGBA reported. The pair were found deceased just 15 minutes apart Friday shortly before 6 p.m. after the San Juan County Sheriff\u2019s Office was notified by the National Park Service \u201cof a deceased hiker in the Upheaval Dome area of Canyonlands National Park,\u201d a news release from the sheriff\u2019s office said. NPS rangers and a helicopter crew from the Bureau of Land Management Moab District responded and initiated a search operation, according the park service. It\u2019s unclear how long the father and daughter were lost in the park, located about 250 miles from Salt Lake City, or how long it took authorities to find them after they died. The United States is experiencing a historically hot summer as the heat goes on a July killing spree. The death toll will likely keep growing as the typically hottest month of the year carries on. It\u2019s been the hottest summer on record for around 100 US cities from Maine to California. Heat is suspected in the deaths of over three dozen people in the US in July, a number that\u00a0is likely an underestimate,\u00a0given the time required to attribute a death to nature\u2019s\u00a0most prolific weather killer.

{"id": "2024_06_08_us_rust-shooting-timeline-alec-baldwin", "text": "Actor Alec Baldwin and several crew members gathered in a church at a New Mexico ranch on October 21, 2021, to rehearse a scene from their upcoming Western film \u201cRust.\u201d Then came the unexpected gunshot. A promising cinematographer was killed, a director was wounded and a film production was left in shambles. Since that day\u2019s fatal shooting of 42-year-old Halyna Hutchins, the film\u2019s armorer and its assistant director have been convicted of criminal charges. After nearly three years of back-and-forth legal arguments, Baldwin\u2019s trial on the involuntary manslaughter charge began on July 10 with opening statements but ended abruptly on July 12, when the judge ruled prosecutors did not properly turn over evidence to the defense, and dismissed the charges. The details of what happened the day of the shooting have been made public in affidavits, probable cause statements, interviews with the main participants and testimony at criminal trials. Here\u2019s a timeline of the on-set shooting and the resulting legal cases. The shooting May 29, 2020: Baldwin, the three-time Emmy winner for his roles on \u201c30 Rock\u201d and \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d was announced as producer and star of the Western feature film \u201cRust,\u201d based on a story by Baldwin and Joel Souza, Deadline reported. In the film, Baldwin plays a grizzled outlaw on the run from authorities with his 13-year-old grandson. October 6, 2021: Filming of \u201cRust\u201d began at Bonanza Creek Ranch, a movie set outside Santa Fe, New Mexico. October 20, 2021: Several crew members walked off set, citing safety concerns. One crew member stated there had been two accidental weapons discharges and a special effects mess-up that set off explosives around the crew between takes. October 21, 2021: Hannah Gutierrez Reed, the armorer for \u201cRust,\u201d loaded a prop six-shot revolver with what she believed were \u201cdummy\u201d rounds, a term for ammo that contains no explosive elements but appear to be real, according to investigators and her defense attorney. Baldwin and several crew members began rehearsing a scene in a rustic church on set before breaking for lunch. After the break, Baldwin, Souza, Hutchins and a few others returned to the church for rehearsal. Assistant director Dave Halls fetched a prop gun from a cart outside the church and yelled \u201ccold gun,\u201d indicating it was unloaded. He then handed the gun to Baldwin. Baldwin practiced a \u201ccross draw\u201d \u2013 pulling a gun from a holster on the opposite side of his body from his draw hand. The scene required him to point the gun toward the camera, helmed by Hutchins, Souza and a camera operator. Suddenly, they heard a loud bang. Hutchins stumbled backward, slumped to the floor clutching her stomach and said she couldn\u2019t feel her legs. Souza, who had been standing beside her, noticed blood on his shoulder. At 1:48 p.m., the crew reported the shooting to emergency responders. Hutchins was transported by air helicopter to the hospital and was pronounced dead at 3:37 p.m. Souza was treated at the hospital, and a projectile from a live round was removed from his back. Sheriff\u2019s deputies arrived to the scene and began investigating the series of events leading to the shooting. October 22, 2021: Baldwin released a statement calling the death a \u201ctragic accident\u201d and said he is fully cooperating with the police investigation. December 2, 2021: In an interview with ABC, Baldwin said he cocked the gun and let go of the hammer, and the gun then fired. He said he was aiming the gun just to the side of the camera toward Hutchins, as she instructed him to do. \u201cI would never point a gun at anyone and then pull the trigger, never,\u201d he said. The investigations August 14, 2022: FBI testing of the firearm found it could not be fired without pulling the trigger while the gun was cocked, according to a forensics report. The report noted the gun eventually malfunctioned during FBI testing after internal parts fractured, causing the gun to go off in the cocked position without pulling the trigger. August 20, 2022: In an interview with CNN, Baldwin\u00a0placed responsibility\u00a0for Hutchins\u2019 death on Gutierrez Reed, the film armorer and props assistant, and on assistant director Halls, who handed him the gun. October 5, 2022: The family of Hutchins and Baldwin reached an undisclosed settlement in a wrongful death lawsuit filed against the actor and others. As part of the settlement, Matthew Hutchins, the cinematographer\u2019s widower, was named an executive producer on \u201cRust.\u201d January 19, 2023: Prosecutors announced Baldwin and Gutierrez Reed will be charged with involuntary manslaughter in Hutchins\u2019 death. Halls, the assistant director, agreed to plead no contest to negligent use of a deadly weapon, the district attorney\u2019s office announced. The terms of that deal include six months of probation\u00a0and a suspended sentence, prosecutors said. January 31, 2023: Baldwin and Gutierrez Reed were formally charged with involuntary manslaughter. February 23, 2023: Baldwin pleaded not guilty to manslaughter charges and was released on personal recognizance. April 20, 2023: New Mexico special prosecutors dismissed the charges against Baldwin, citing \u201cnew facts\u201d in the case. \u201cThis decision does not absolve Mr. Baldwin of criminal culpability and charges may be refiled,\u201d they said. August 9, 2023: Gutierrez Reed pleaded not guilty to involuntary manslaughter and tampering with evidence. January 19: Baldwin was indicted by a grand jury on charges of involuntary manslaughter. January 31: Baldwin pleaded not guilty to involuntary manslaughter charges for the second time. The trials February 22: The trial of film armorer Gutierrez Reed began. Prosecutors alleged her failures allowed six live bullets to make their way on set, and she did not make vital safety checks that would have caught the problem. Her defense blamed Baldwin for failing to follow common-sense gun safety rules and on the film\u2019s production team for creating a chaotic and unsafe environment. March 1: Souza, the director and screenwriter, testified about the moment he was shot on set while standing behind Hutchins. March 6: Gutierrez Reed was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter after jurors deliberated for nearly three hours. She was acquitted of a charge of evidence tampering. April 15: At her sentencing hearing, Gutierrez Reed said, \u201cMy heart aches\u201d for Hutchins\u2019 family and friends, and she asked the judge to sentence her to probation. The judge criticized her statement and sentenced her to a maximum of 18 months in prison, saying, \u201cYou alone turned a safe weapon into a lethal weapon.\u201d May 24: A New Mexico judge denied Baldwin\u2019s motion to dismiss the involuntary manslaughter indictment. Baldwin\u2019s attorneys had accused prosecutors of misconduct during the grand jury process. June 3: New Mexico prosecutors asked the court to grant use immunity to Gutierrez Reed and compel her to testify at Baldwin\u2019s trial, according to court documents. Gutierrez Reed invoked her Fifth Amendment right to silence in a pre-trial interview, and prosecutors said if she is not granted immunity then she would not be able to testify in the trial. Gutierrez Reed\u2019s attorney, Jason Bowles, told CNN he will oppose the motion. June 17: Prosecutors signaled their intention to portray Baldwin as repeatedly flouting safety protocols on the movie set in the days before the fatal shooting, according to\u00a0a court filing. June 21: Judge Mary Marlowe Sommer denied a defense motion asking the court to dismiss the involuntary manslaughter indictment. The defense had argued the shooting death was an accident and Baldwin was \u201cnot criminally liable,\u201d but the prosecution countered Baldwin was experienced in the movie business and knew he was handling a real gun. The judge also denied the prosecution\u2019s motion to grant use immunity to Gutierrez Reed to compel her to testify at Baldwin\u2019s trial. June 28: The court denied a motion to dismiss the charges related to the gun that was damaged during forensic testing. Separately, attorneys for Gutierrez Reed in a court filing on June 27 accused prosecutors of withholding evidence that would have favored the defendant during her manslaughter trial and requested she be released from prison,\u00a0Reuters\u00a0reported. According to the filing obtained by Reuters, prosecutors had a report from their own weapons experts that the gun used on set had \u201cunexplained toolmarks on critical surfaces of the trigger and sear.\u201d July 3: Judge Sommer denied two motions filed by Baldwin\u2019s legal team alleging prosecutors had improperly handled evidence, paving the way for Baldwin\u2019s trial to start. July 8: The judge ruled Baldwin\u2019s role as a producer on the film \u201cRust\u201d would not be considered at trial. The prosecution had sought to show Baldwin had more responsibility and influence on the set than just as an actor, but the judge said the evidence was prejudicial and confusing to the jury. July 9: Twelve jurors and four alternates were empaneled in Santa Fe for Baldwin\u2019s trial. July 10: The trial of Baldwin on a charge of involuntary manslaughter began with opening statements. Prosecutors alleged Baldwin was reckless with firearms on set and violated the \u201ccardinal rules of firearm safety.\u201d \u201cHe pointed the gun at another human being, cocked the hammer and pulled that trigger, in reckless disregard for Ms. Hutchins\u2019 safety,\u201d prosecutor Erlinda Johnson said. The defense blamed the film\u2019s armorer and the first assistant director for allowing a live round to be loaded into the prop gun. \u201cThis was an unspeakable tragedy, but Alec Baldwin committed no crime. He was an actor, acting, playing the role of Harlan Rust. An actor playing a character can do things that are lethal,\u201d attorney Alex Spiro said. \u201cThese \u2018cardinal rules\u2019 are not cardinal rules on a movie set.\u201d July 12: The involuntary manslaughter case against Baldwin was dismissed in dramatic fashion after the judge overseeing the case ruled prosecutors did not properly turn over evidence to the defense.

{"id": "2024_07_15_us_gen-z-boss-and-a-mini-tiktok-cec", "text": "If you could describe your overall vibe with two phrases, what would they be? \u201cFive-foot-three and an attitude\u201d? \u201cGen Z boss and a mini\u201d? Maybe even \u201ccargo shorts and a really cool mullet\u201d? If you can think of two catchy descriptors that encapsulate your outfit and unique aura, you\u2019ve got enough material to get in on the latest TikTok style trend. It\u2019s simple enough: Users introduce their clothing ensembles with jaunty little chants to hype up themselves and their friends. A trio of women in the UK apparently invented the format at the end of June, in a video in which they spotlight their outfits and hairstyles for a night on the town: \u201cBoots and a slicked-back bun,\u201d \u201ccowboy boots and a blowie\u201d \u2014\u00a0slang for blowout, a volumizing hair treatment\u2014\u2013 and \u201c(Adidas) Sambas and a little red bag.\u201d The employees of TBH Skincare in Australia took the trend to work, and their chants incorporated clothes, demeanors and descriptors that we viewers otherwise wouldn\u2019t catch by looking at them, like \u201cGen Z boss and a mini\u201d to describe their young manager who wore a short skirt to work, and \u201c5-foot-3 and an attitude\u201d for a shorter coworker who also wore a carnation-red cardigan \u2014 her sass, apparently, spoke louder than her clothes. Even Amy Poehler, a burgeoning TikTok star herself, repeated the format with three of her former castmates \u2014\u00a0Rachel Dratch and Seth Meyers (in a drive-by cameo) from \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d and Rashida Jones of \u201cParks and Recreation.\u201d Jones showed off her \u201cpony and a cashmere shirt,\u201d with Meyers bustling quickly past her like a ghost. Meyers did not introduce his own outfit, though if he had, he might have focused on his blue button-down and blindingly white sneakers. Some TikTokers are using the trend to celebrate their own style, their unique shine too bright to share with others in the same video. A mulleted user who goes by Michael B. strutted his stuff by himself, alternating between light-up \u201cdisco glasses\u201d and a sequin cowboy hat in red, white and blue. Though the videos are generally affectionate, the responses to the clip of the women of TBH Skincare have been less charitable. (The Daily Dot called it \u201cpeak corporate cringe.\u201d) So the employees and their Gen Z boss in a mini skirt posted a follow-up video in which they chanted some of the negative comments they received that encouraged them to \u201cgo back to the kitchen\u201d or hoping that they\u2019d be fired. The brand even capitalized on its viral fame with a \u201cGen Z boss and a mini\u201d bundle of skin care products. Corporate cringe though it may be, the trend is already paying off for the squad of TikTok-savvy skin care mavens.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/15/us/gen-z-boss-and-a-mini-tiktok-cec/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/17/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_07_14_us_trump-rally-gunman-thomas-crooks-invs", "text": "This November, Thomas Matthew Crooks was set to reach a political milestone: The first presidential election he was old enough to vote in. A 20-year-old living in a crucial swing state, Crooks had already shown potential signs of interest in politics, making a small political donation as a teenager and registering to vote just a week after he turned 18. But instead of casting his ballot this year, according to law enforcement, Crooks traveled an hour north of his home, climbed to the roof of a building, and opened fire on former President Donald Trump during a campaign rally \u2014 leaving him bloodied and coming inches away from killing him. Crooks\u2019 attack, which killed one spectator and critically injured two others, rocked American politics to its core, with elected officials from both sides of the aisle condemning the violence and warning of the dangers of the country\u2019s deep polarization. So far, investigators haven\u2019t found any evidence on social media or other writings by Crooks that might help identify his motive for the attempted assassination, law enforcement officials say. But CNN interviews with more than a half-dozen former classmates and neighbors of Crooks painted him as quiet, with classmates remembering him as a good student and something of a misfit in high school. And a review of public records suggests he may have had divergent political leanings, with Crooks registering to vote as a Republican but making a small donation to a Democratic-leaning group. Crooks lived in the Pittsburgh suburb of Bethel Park, about an hour\u2019s drive south of the Trump rally where law enforcement officials say he fired at the former president. Crooks graduated from Bethel Park High School in 2022, according to a local media report and a video of the school\u2019s graduation ceremony. Jason Kohler, 21, who went to the same high school, told CNN that Crooks was bullied by other students and seemed to be a loner. Crooks had \u201cno facial expression\u201d when he walked through the school hallways, Kohler said. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t, like, with the clique, so he always had, I guess, a target on his back.\u201d Another former student at the school, Sarah D\u2019Angelo, remembered Crooks as \u201ca quiet kid, not obviously political or violent in any way.\u201d She said the only time he spoke with her was when their class was waiting for their graduation ceremony to start. A third classmate, who asked not to be named, said that Crooks was very smart, took honors classes, and was shy. She said that he had a group of friends who were fairly conservative, some of whom would wear Trump hats. \u201cThere was definitely chatter about him just looking a little different,\u201d the classmate said of Crooks. \u201cAlmost a retro nerd vibe.\u201d Crooks\u2019 high school experience was interrupted by the pandemic, with students being out of school for months in 2020 and allowed to study remotely after that, the classmate said \u2013 and she added that she didn\u2019t recall seeing him much during their sophomore or junior years. When she heard that Crooks was identified as the Trump rally shooter, the classmate said, \u201cI was just, like, shocked \u2014 I just couldn\u2019t believe he did something that bold, considering he was such a quiet and kept-to-himself kind of person.\u201d FBI agents \u2014 like Crooks\u2019 former classmates \u2014 were still trying to piece together his motives on Sunday. Kevin Rojek, the special agent in charge of the FBI\u2019s Pittsburgh field office, said the FBI was working to gain access to Crooks\u2019 phone. Investigators believe he acted alone, Rojek said, adding that they had not seen any indication Crooks had mental health issues. \u201cWe are working hard to determine the sequence of events related to the subject and his movements in the hours, days and weeks prior to the shooting,\u201d Rojek said, while noting that \u201cwe\u2019re still very early in this investigation.\u201d The gun Crooks used was a legally purchased AR-style weapon, Rojek confirmed. According to law enforcement officials, the gun was traced to Crooks\u2019 father, which helped to determine the gunman\u2019s identity because he was not carrying identification. When reached by CNN late Saturday night, Crooks\u2019 father, Matthew Crooks, said he was trying to figure out \u201cwhat the hell is going on\u201d but would \u201cwait until I talk to law enforcement\u201d before speaking about his son. He could not be reached again on Sunday. Federal Election Commission records show that a donor listed as Thomas Crooks with the gunman\u2019s street address gave $15 to Progressive Turnout Project, a Democratic-aligned political action committee, on Inauguration Day in January 2021, when Crooks was 17. A spokesperson for Progressive Turnout Project said in an email that the group had received the donation \u201cin response to an email about tuning into the inauguration\u201d and that \u201cthe email address associated with the contribution only made the one contribution and was unsubscribed from our lists 2 years ago.\u201d \u201cWe unequivocally condemn political violence in all of its forms, and we denounce anyone who chooses violence over peaceful political action,\u201d the spokesperson wrote. Later that year, a week after turning 18, Crooks registered to vote as a Republican, according to a listing in Pennsylvania\u2019s voter database that matched his name, age and address. Crooks only cast a ballot once, in the 2022 midterm general election, an Allegheny County spokesperson told CNN. Both of Crooks\u2019 parents worked as social workers, according to state license records. His father is registered to vote as a Libertarian and his mother is registered as a Democrat, state voter records show. Crooks fired on Trump while perched on a nearby building rooftop outside the rally\u2019s security perimeter, before being killed by Secret Service agents, according to law enforcement officials. Law enforcement descended on Crooks\u2019 family home on a quiet street in Bethel Park on Saturday night. Explosive material was found in his residence, as well as in his car, law enforcement officials familiar with the investigation told CNN. A brief video posted on Facebook by Crooks\u2019 school district in 2022 showed Crooks participating in a computer coding course and explaining a coding concept to a fellow student. Crooks can also be spotted sitting at the front of an economics class in a TV ad for the investment firm BlackRock that was filmed at his high school. The teachers featured in both the videos declined to comment. A spokesperson for the social media platform Discord said in a statement that it had identified an account that appears to be linked to Crooks. The account \u201cwas rarely utilized and we have found no evidence that it was used to plan this incident or discuss his political views,\u201d the spokesperson wrote. Crooks worked\u00a0as a dietary aide at\u00a0Bethel Park Skilled Nursing and Rehabilitation Center, a nursing home less than a mile from his family\u2019s home,\u00a0according to Marcie Grimm, the center\u2019s administrator. \u201cWe are shocked and saddened to learn of his involvement as Thomas Matthew Crooks performed his job without concern and his background check was clean,\u201d Grimm said in a statement. A colleague who worked with Crooks at the nursing home and who asked not to be named described him in an interview as \u201cthe sweetest guy.\u201d Just this week, the colleague said, the two of them worked together to find an easier way for nursing home residents to open ranch dressing packets, an act the colleague said was indicative of how caring Crooks was. \u201cThese stupid ranch packets in the kitchen \u2014 no one can ever open them,\u201d said the colleague, who also went to high school with Crooks. \u201cEarlier this week he was helping me with a bunch of sick old ladies (to) put ranch on their salads.\u201d Crooks, the colleague said, never expressed political views at work and wasn\u2019t \u201ca radical.\u201d They added: \u201cIt\u2019s hard seeing everything that\u2019s going on online because he was a really, really good person that did a really bad thing, and I just wish I knew why.\u201d Bethel Park is a predominantly white suburb that is wealthier than the surrounding Pittsburgh metro area. Dan Grzybek, a county council representative whose district includes Bethel Park, described it as politically mixed \u2014 according to county election records, President Joe Biden won the precinct that includes the Crooks\u2019 house with just 52% of the vote. Grzybek, who lives nearby, said he had had a \u201cvery pleasant\u201d conversation with the gunman\u2019s parents while canvassing for votes before he was elected last year. He described the community as \u201cincredibly safe\u201d and \u201cclose-knit,\u201d and said he hoped that the shooting was not \u201cwhat Bethel Park is remembered for.\u201d \u201cAll things like this do is increase the already extreme political polarization we experience, and increase the risk of future violence in retaliation,\u201d Grzybek said. Andrew Bianco, who lives two houses down the street from the Crooks family, agreed that the area was politically diverse, with some residents flying Trump flags and others displaying Biden ones. But he said he doesn\u2019t remember ever seeing political signage outside the Crooks\u2019 residence, and only saw the gunman\u2019s father when he stepped outside to mow the lawn. \u201cIf anything, you\u2019d be like, \u2018Does someone live there?\u2019\u201d Bianco said.

{"id": "2024_07_16_us_hannah-gutierrez-reed-rust-dismissal", "text": "An attorney for convicted \u201cRust\u201d movie armorer Hannah Gutierrez Reed has filed a motion for a new trial or to have her case thrown out, after the related case against actor Alec Baldwin was dismissed in dramatic fashion last week. The attorneys filed the motion Tuesday in Santa Fe First Judicial District Court, citing \u201cegregious prosecutorial misconduct\u201d and multiple\u00a0allegations of \u201csevere and ongoing discovery violations by the State.\u201d Gutierrez\u2019s attorneys request the court order her prison release and the removal of Kari Morrissey as the special prosecutor \u201cfor the misconduct that has been found, and the violations committed in Ms. Gutierrez Reed\u2019s case.\u201d On Friday, the involuntary manslaughter\u00a0case against\u00a0actor Alec Baldwin\u00a0was dismissed\u00a0after the judge overseeing the case ruled prosecutors did not properly turn over evidence to the defense. Legal experts said the collapse of the actor\u2019s case could result in Gutierrez Reed being freed from the New Mexico state prison where she\u2019s serving an 18-month sentence following her conviction in March of involuntary manslaughter in the on-set fatal shooting of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins in 2021. Jason Bowles, Gutierrez Reed\u2019s attorney, previously told CNN the same failures that caused the dismissal of the charges against Baldwin \u2013 specifically the prosecution\u2019s withholding of evidence \u2013 were present in his client\u2019s case. \u201cThe judge found intentional misconduct and we also have had the same failures in Hannah\u2019s case by the state. We will be moving for dismissal of Hannah\u2019s case,\u201d Bowles said. Gutierrez Reed\u00a0previously filed an appeal of\u00a0her conviction. The shooting occurred October 21, 2021. Baldwin was on the set at a ranch outside Santa Fe practicing a \u201ccross draw\u201d with a prop gun \u2013 pulling it from a holster on the opposite side of his body from his draw hand \u2013 when it fired a live round, killing Hutchins and injuring director Joel Souza. As the armorer, Gutierrez Reed was responsible for firearm safety and storage. At her\u00a0trial, prosecutors argued she repeatedly violated safety protocol and acted without caution in performing her duties, ultimately leading to Hutchins\u2019 death. Gutierrez Reed\u2019s defense attorney argued she has been scapegoated for the safety failures of film set management and other crew members. Baldwin was two days into his own involuntary manslaughter trial when it imploded last Friday over revelations of withheld evidence. Baldwin\u2019s attorneys had filed a motion to dismiss the day prior, arguing the state withheld potentially favorable evidence \u2013 a violation of the Brady rule, which requires prosecutors to disclose such information to defendants. Specifically, the lawyers claimed the state did not share with them a man had delivered to investigators a batch of unexamined ammunition purportedly connected to the case after Gutierrez Reed\u2019s conviction. On Friday, during a chaotic, hourslong hearing, special prosecutor Kari Morrissey took the stand as a witness, testifying investigators had determined the ammunition was not a match to those found on the \u201cRust\u201d set and had no evidentiary value. The lead investigator, however, testified the rounds looked \u201csimilar\u201d to the dummy rounds on \u201cRust\u2019s\u201d set. Judge Mary Marlowe Sommer ruled prosecutors did not properly turn over evidence to the defense. She dismissed the case with prejudice, meaning it cannot be brought again. \u201cI fully expect Hannah Gutierrez Reed to make the same argument for her conviction to be overturned,\u201d Neama Rahmani, a former federal prosecutor, told CNN. \u201cThis evidence is more exculpatory and exonerates Gutierrez Reed even more than Baldwin.\u201d \u201cIt won\u2019t just be Alec Baldwin who\u2019s a free man,\u201d Rahmani added. \u201cHannah Gutierrez Reed will go free as well. And it\u2019s really a tragedy to the victims in this case.\u201d This is a developing story and will be updated.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/16/us/hannah-gutierrez-reed-rust-dismissal/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/17/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_07_16_us_tuskegee-syphilis-study-whistleblower-peter-buxtun-death", "text": "New York (AP) \u2014 Peter Buxtun, the whistleblower who revealed that the US government allowed hundreds of Black men in rural Alabama to go untreated for syphilis in what became known as the Tuskegee study, has died. He was 86. Buxtun died May 18 of Alzheimer\u2019s disease in Rocklin, California, according to his attorney, Minna Fernan. Buxtun is revered as a hero to public health scholars and ethicists for his role in bringing to light the\u00a0most notorious medical research scandal\u00a0in US history. Documents that Buxtun provided to The Associated Press, and its subsequent investigation and reporting, led to a public outcry that ended the study in 1972. Forty years earlier, in 1932, federal scientists began studying 400 Black men in Tuskegee, Alabama, who were infected with syphilis. When antibiotics became available in the 1940s that could treat the disease, federal health officials ordered that the drugs be withheld. The study became an observation of how the disease ravaged the body over time. In the mid-1960s, Buxtun was a federal public health employee working in San Francisco when he overheard a co-worker talking about the study. The research wasn\u2019t exactly a secret \u2014 about a dozen medical journal articles about it had been published in the previous 20 years. But hardly anyone had raised any concerns about how the experiment was being conducted. \u201cThis study was completely accepted by the American medical community,\u201d said Ted Pestorius of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, speaking at a 2022 program marking the 50th anniversary of the end of the study. Buxtun had a different reaction. After learning more about the study, he raised ethical concerns in a 1966 letter to officials at the CDC. In 1967, he was summoned to a meeting in Atlanta, where he was chewed out by agency officials for what they deemed to be impertinence. Repeatedly, agency leaders rejected his complaints and his call for the men in Tuskegee to be treated. He left the US Public Health Service and attended law school, but the study ate at him. In 1972, he provided documents about the research to Edith Lederer, an AP reporter he had met in San Francisco. Lederer passed the documents to AP investigative reporter Jean Heller, telling her colleague, \u201cI think there might be something here.\u201d Heller\u2019s story was published on July 25, 1972, leading to congressional hearings, a class-action lawsuit that resulted in a $10 million\u00a0settlement\u00a0and the study\u2019s termination about four months later. In 1997, President Bill Clinton formally\u00a0apologized\u00a0for the study, calling it \u201cshameful.\u201d The leader of a group dedicated to the memory of the study participants said Monday they are grateful to Buxtun for exposing the experiment. \u201cWe are thankful for his honesty and his courage,\u201d said Lille Tyson Head, whose father was in the study. Buxtun was born in Prague in 1937. His father was Jewish, and his family immigrated to the US in 1939 from Nazi-occupied Czechoslovakia, eventually settling in Irish Bend, Oregon, on the Columbia River. In his complaints to federal health officials, he drew comparisons between the Tuskegee study and medical experiments Nazi doctors had conducted on Jews and other prisoners. Federal scientists didn\u2019t believe they were guilty of the same kind of moral and ethical sins, but after the Tuskegee study was exposed, the\u00a0government put in place new rules\u00a0about how it conducts medical research. Today, the study is often blamed for the unwillingness of some African Americans to participate in medical research. \u201cPeter\u2019s life experiences led him to immediately identify the study as morally indefensible and to seek justice in the form of treatment for the men. Ultimately, he could not relent,\u201d said the CDC\u2019s Pestorius. Buxtun attended the University of Oregon, served in the US Army as a combat medic and psychiatric social worker and joined the federal health service in 1965. Buxtun went on to write, give presentations and win awards for his involvement in the Tuskegee study. A global traveler, he collected and sold antiques, especially military weapons and swords and gambling equipment from California\u2019s Gold Rush era. He also spent more than 20 years trying to recover his family\u2019s properties confiscated by the Nazis and was partly successful. \u201cPeter was wise, witty, classy and unceasingly generous,\u201d said David M. Golden, a close friend of Buxtun\u2019s for over 25 years. \u201cHe was a staunch advocate for personal freedoms and spoke often against prohibition, whether it be drugs, prostitution or firearms.\u201d Another longtime friend, Angie Bailie, said she attended many of Buxtun\u2019s presentations about Tuskegee. \u201cPeter never ended a single talk without fighting back tears,\u201d she said Buxtun himself could be self-effacing about his actions, saying he did not anticipate the vitriolic reaction of some health officials when he started questioning the study\u2019s ethics. At a Johns Hopkins University forum in 2018, Buxtun was asked where he got the moral strength to blow the whistle. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t strength,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was stupidity.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/16/us/tuskegee-syphilis-study-whistleblower-peter-buxtun-death/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/17/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_07_16_media_ozy-media-carlos-watson-fraud-trial", "text": "Ozy\u00a0Media and founder Carlos Watson were convicted of fraud by a Brooklyn federal jury on Tuesday, in a case accusing them of lying to investors about the now-defunct startup\u2019s finances and sham deals with Google and Oprah Winfrey. Watson, a former cable news anchor and investment banker, and\u00a0Ozy\u00a0were each convicted of securities fraud conspiracy and wire fraud conspiracy, while Watson was also convicted of identity theft. Both had pleaded not guilty. Federal prosecutors said Watson and his California-based news and entertainment company\u00a0falsified information about\u00a0Ozy\u2019s finances and audience size, fabricated contracts and inflated earnings projections to court investors. Founded in 2013,\u00a0Ozy\u00a0imploded in 2021 after news reports questioned its audience numbers and revealed that a top executive had impersonated a YouTube executive during a call with Goldman Sachs\u00a0bankers in which he claimed the streaming site agreed to pay for exclusive rights to an\u00a0Ozy\u00a0show. Prosecutors said Watson could face about 24 to 29 years in prison under recommended federal sentencing guidelines, including a mandatory two years for identity theft.\u00a0His sentencing is set for Nov. 18. \u201cOzy\u00a0Media ultimately collapsed under the weight of Watson\u2019s dishonest schemes and with today\u2019s verdict, Watson himself has been held accountable for his brazen crimes,\u201d Brooklyn US Attorney Breon Peace said in a statement. Lawyers for Watson and\u00a0Ozy\u00a0did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Watson\u2019s lawyer had told jurors that Watson was betrayed by deputies who acted on their own and kept him in the dark about their wrongdoing. The verdict follows\u00a0a six-week trial that featured testimony\u00a0by two former Watson deputies, who pleaded guilty to fraud. They told jurors they conspired with Watson to hide\u00a0Ozy\u2019s crippling debt, meager cash reserves and slow growth. Ozy\u00a0folded shortly after The New York Times reported on former chief operating officer Samir Rao\u2019s impersonation of the YouTube executive. Watson denied involvement in the incident, though prosecutors said contemporaneous chat logs show he coached Rao on what to say. The YouTube executive Alex Piper and Google CEO Sundar Pichai testified for the government, saying they never had deals with\u00a0Ozy\u00a0or considered buying it at any price, contrary to Watson\u2019s claims to investors. Prosecutors said Watson also assured investors that\u00a0Ozy\u00a0was thriving even as its cash reserves sank to $19,000 in 2018\u00a0and\u00a0it struggled to pay rent, wages and other basic expenses. Watson testified for several days in his own defense. He said prosecutors\u2019 view of\u00a0Ozy\u2019s finances was simplistic and failed to appreciate the nuances of media industry dealmaking. He also blamed negative press coverage for\u00a0Ozy\u2019s demise. During cross-examination, Watson was at times evasive about the inconsistent revenue figures\u00a0Ozy\u00a0provided to investors. He also declined a prosecutor\u2019s request to break down\u00a0Ozy\u2019s annual revenue in cash rather than future potential earnings. \u201cThat\u2019s not the way I\u2019ve thought about it before and that\u2019s not the way our investors thought about it,\u201d he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/16/media/ozy-media-carlos-watson-fraud-trial/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/17/2024", "section": "us"}}

Thomas Matthew Crooks told his coworkers he would be back to work on Sunday. While investigators have not been able to identify a motive for Crooks\u2019 attack at the rally in Butler County, Pennsylvania, they are piecing together more of his activities. By 3 p.m. on Saturday, roughly three hours before the shooting, Crooks was at the security screening area for the rally. He first aroused suspicion when he passed through the magnetometers carrying a\u00a0rangefinder, which looks similar to a small pair of binoculars and is used by hunters and target shooters to measure distances when setting up a long-range shot, according to a senior law enforcement official briefed on the investigation. The rangefinder would not have prevented Crooks from getting through the security screening point, but it did attract the attention of security personnel who kept an eye on him until he left the secure area. Investigators are unsure of where Crooks went after he left the screening area but the working theory is that he went to his car to retrieve the rifle. Around the same time witnesses alerted police that Crooks was crawling on the roof of the American Glass Research building, one of the four counter-sniper teams observed Crooks looking at their position through the rangefinder, according to the senior law enforcement official. \u201cThey were looking at him while he was looking at them,\u201d the official said. Crooks gained access to the rooftop by climbing on top of the building\u2019s air conditioning system and hoisting himself up, according to a senior federal law enforcement official briefed on the investigation. After the shooting, multiple law enforcement sources said investigators found a bulletproof vest, three fully-loaded magazines, and two remote-controlled explosive devices in Crooks\u2019 car. Investigators are uncertain as to whether Crooks had a plan to use the body armor, nearly 100 rounds of additional ammunition from those loaded magazines, and two remote-controlled bombs, had he escaped after the shooting. Additionally, after a search of his residence, investigators discovered another bulletproof vest, another remote-controlled explosive device, and a 3D printer, according to multiple law enforcement sources.

{"id": "2024_07_16_media_hillbilly-elegy-sales-jd-vance-trump-vp", "text": "In 2016, a venture capitalist and Yale law graduate named JD Vance published a memoir, \u201cHillbilly Elegy.\u201d The instant\u00a0bestseller turned Vance into a media star and was later adapted into an Oscar-nominated\u00a0film\u00a0directed by Ron Howard. Eight years after its publication, Vance\u2019s book has found its way back\u00a0onto the bestseller\u00a0lists, thanks to his appointment as Donald Trump\u2019s running mate. Less than 24 hours after Trump announced Vance was his vice-presidential\u00a0pick, \u201cHillbilly Elegy\u201d shot to the top of Amazon\u2019s\u00a0bestselling\u00a0books. On Tuesday, the 2020 film adaptation of \u201cHillbilly Elegy,\u201d starring Glenn Close and Amy Adams,\u00a0was the 6th\u00a0most-watched movie on Netflix\u2019s Top 10 in the US, as seen on the streamer\u2019s platform. Viewership of \u201cHillbilly Elegy\u201d increased by 1,179% on Netflix compared to the day before Vance\u2019s VP bid,\u00a0according to research from Luminate,\u00a0which adds that the film was watched for 19.2 million minutes on Monday, jumping from the 1.5 million minutes the movie was watched on Sunday when rumors were swirling of Vance\u2019s appointment. When the \u201cHillbilly Elegy\u201d film first debuted, it launched to mostly negative reviews and was largely panned by critics, though Close and Adams received praise for their performances portraying Vance\u2019s grandmother and mother,\u00a0respectively,\u00a0as well as the actor Gabriel Basso, who played a younger version of Vance. Close notably was nominated for \u201cHillbilly Elegy\u201d at both the Oscars and the\u00a0Razzie Awards, which is the ceremony that infamously honors the worst in cinema every year. \u201cHillbilly Elegy\u201d chronicles Vance\u2019s childhood in Appalachia, which he wrote was plagued with poverty, abuse and his mother\u2019s addiction. At the time of \u201cHillbilly Elegy\u2019s\u201d release, the book was\u00a0widely discussed\u00a0as an explanation\u00a0for\u00a0Trump\u2019s rise among the White working class. As the book\u2019s popularity went into overdrive after Vance was announced as Trump\u2019s veep pick, Goodreads, a social cataloging website for book recommendations, temporarily restricted actions on \u201cHillbilly Elegy\u201d including submitting ratings and reviews. A pop-up alert on Goodreads said, \u201cThis may be because we\u2019ve detected unusual behavior that doesn\u2019t follow our review guidelines.\u201d A representative for Goodreads declined to comment to CNN inquiry regarding the specific type of activity on Vance\u2019s book that was detected by the site, but per the company\u2019s\u00a0community guidelines, Goodreads launched the ability to limit reviews and ratings on a book earlier this year.

{"id": "2024_07_15_us_california-schools-parents-pronouns", "text": "Sacramento, California (AP) \u2014 California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a first-in-the-nation law Monday barring school districts from passing policies that require schools to notify parents if their child asks to change their gender identification. The law bans rules requiring school staff to disclose a student\u2019s gender identity or sexual orientation to any other person without the child\u2019s permission. Proponents of the legislation say it will help protect LGBTQ+ students who live in unwelcoming households. But opponents say it will hinder schools\u2019 ability to be more transparent with parents. The law comes amid a broader debate over local school districts and the rights of parents and LGBTQ+ students. \u201cPolitically motivated attacks on the rights, safety, and dignity of transgender, nonbinary, and other LGBTQ+ youth are on the rise nationwide, including in California,\u201d Democratic Assemblymember Chris Ward, who authored the law, said in a statement. \u201cWhile some school districts have adopted policies to forcibly out students, the SAFETY Act ensures that discussions about gender identity remain a private matter within the family.\u201d The new law comes after several school districts in California passed policies requiring that parents be notified if a child requests to change their gender identification. That led to\u00a0pushback by Democratic state officials, who say students have a right to privacy. But Jonathan Zachreson, an advocate in California who supports the so-called parental notification policies, opposes the law and said telling parents about a student\u2019s request to change their gender identification is \u201ccritical to the well-being of children and for maintaining that trust between schools and parents.\u201d States across the country have sought to\u00a0impose bans on gender-affirming care, bar\u00a0transgender athletes\u00a0from girls\u2019 and women\u2019s sports, and require schools to out trans and nonbinary students to their parents. Some lawmakers in other states have introduced bills with\u00a0broad language requiring that parents be notified\u00a0of any changes to their child\u2019s emotional health or well-being. The California law led to heated debate in the state legislature. LGBTQ+ lawmakers have shared stories about how it was difficult for them to decide when to come out to their families, arguing that transgender students should be able to share that part of their identity on their own terms. State Assemblymember Bill Essayli, a Republican representing part of Riverside County, is an outspoken opponent of the law. He has criticized Democratic leaders for preventing a bill he introduced last year \u2014 that would have required parents to be notified of their child\u2019s gender identification change \u2014 from receiving a hearing. In Northern California, the Anderson Union High School District board approved a parental notification policy last year. But the teachers union recommended that teachers not enforce the rule while the union is involved in a labor dispute with the district over the policy, said Shaye Stephens, an English teacher and president of the teachers association at the district. The notification policies put teachers in an unfair position, Stephens said. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of a lose-lose situation for teachers and administrators or anybody that\u2019s being asked to do this. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s safe for students,\u201d she said. \u201cI do not think that we are the right people to be having those conversations with a parent or a guardian.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/15/us/california-schools-parents-pronouns/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/17/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_07_16_politics_nikki-haley-trump-rnc-speech", "text": "Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley is expected to help pitch voters on Donald Trump during her Republican convention speech Tuesday night, her latest step toward embracing her former rival and unifying the party. Haley intends to \u201caddress voters who are uncertain about voting for President Trump and make the case for why she is voting for him,\u201d a person familiar with her speech told CNN. Haley\u2019s speech is being written in consultation with the Trump campaign and approved by Republican convention officials, as all such addresses are. Haley, who released her delegates last week and implored them to support Trump, was a late addition to the program. She was invited to appear onstage in Milwaukee only two days ago \u2013 the same day as the assassination attempt on Trump, which was followed by the former president\u2019s call for themes of unity at the convention. Tuesday\u2019s speech continues a gradual easing of tensions between Haley and Trump after a bruising, yearlong campaign for the Republican presidential nomination, in which Haley urged GOP voters to back her to avoid the \u201cchaos\u201d that she said follows the former president. After primary losses in New Hampshire and her home state of South Carolina, Haley defied calls to drop out and rally around Trump. Instead, she leaned harder into criticisms of the former president and his age. At campaign events, she frequently pointed out that polls suggested she would be more competitive than Trump against President Joe Biden in a general election matchup and warned that his legal troubles would dominate much of the campaign cycle. When Haley did end her campaign in early March, the day after Super Tuesday, she did not endorse the former president as primary rivals such as Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis had done. (DeSantis, who dropped out after losing the Iowa caucuses, is also set to speak Tuesday.) \u201cIt is now up to Donald Trump to earn the vote \u2013 those in our party and beyond it, who did not support him. And I hope he does that,\u201d she said in her exit announcement. But in May, Haley, who served as Trump\u2019s ambassador to the United Nations, said she would vote for the former president, arguing that Biden would be worse for America. And last week, shortly after she released her delegates to vote for Trump, her former rival said he would \u201ctake a look\u201d at inviting her to speak at the convention. \u201cThere was a lot of bad blood there,\u201d Trump told Fox News radio last week. \u201cShe stayed too long. She was being soundly defeated at every place, but she just wouldn\u2019t leave.\u201d Michael Whatley, the chair of the Republican National Committee, told reporters at a Bloomberg event Tuesday afternoon that he thought it was \u201ctremendously important\u201d that Haley would be speaking at the convention. \u201cWe want to talk about unifying the country, and I think that that\u2019s really where the president wants to go, particularly coming out of Saturday,\u201d Whatley said. \u201cSo having Ambassador Haley here is very important for us.\u201d Whatley declined to say when exactly the invitation to speak at the convention had been extended to Haley. Haley won less than 100 delegates, compared with the more than 2,200 who are bound to Trump, and she won just two primaries, in Vermont and Washington, DC. But in the weeks after\u00a0dropping out, she continued to receive tens of thousands of votes in primaries, including in key battleground states such as Arizona and Pennsylvania. The Biden campaign\u00a0has sought to reach Haley\u2019s supporters\u00a0through television and digital ads in hopes of reminding them of Trump\u2019s insults aimed at their candidate. Facing the convention crowd The question now is whether the unity Republicans are projecting at their convention has extended to Haley voters. Some supporters think it will. \u201cThe Nikki Haley voters will come around to Trump,\u201d said Katon Dawson, a longtime Haley ally and former South Carolina Republican Party chairman. \u201cIt might take a while, but they\u2019ll come.\u201d Dawson pointed to his own decision to back Trump and argued that, despite Haley\u2019s past criticism of the former president, the country couldn\u2019t handle another four years of Biden. He predicted the former governor would deliver a \u201cvintage Haley\u201d speech, focused on the future of the country while also striking a more conciliatory tone. \u201cShe\u2019s doing the right thing,\u201d Dawson said of Haley speaking at the convention. But the crowd will also include thousands of Republican Party activists, some of whom are still wary of her after the primary. \u201cI have no problem with her speaking tonight, only if she puts her complete support behind President Trump,\u201d said Susan Cheatham, an Arizona delegate who said she thought Haley stayed in the race as long as she did to \u201cdiscredit and disrupt\u201d Trump\u2019s campaign. Angie Fisher, a South Carolina delegate, predicted that the reaction to her home state\u2019s former governor would be mixed \u2013 and some delegates might boo her. \u201cIf they don\u2019t, it\u2019s because they have Southern hospitality and won\u2019t do that an event like this,\u201d Fisher said. \u201cBut for the most part, people who support Trump are not in support of how she handled running.\u201d Aaron Farris, an uncommitted delegate from Minnesota \u2013 where Haley won nearly 30% of the primary vote \u2013 said he voted for Trump but respects the former ambassador\u2019s work at the United Nations. \u201cStuff gets said during primaries,\u201d Farris said. \u201cAt the end of the day, it\u2019s important that we\u2019re all unified going into November.\u201d Julia Black, another South Carolina delegate, said she supported Haley when she led the state but always planned to vote for Trump in the primary. \u201cI think she has come back into the fold with the rest of us, and I think she\u2019ll speak about unity and just advancing the party,\u201d Black said. Black said the criticisms Haley leveled at Trump during the primary were just a normal part of politics. \u201cWho won?\u201d Black said. \u201cPoliticians. They say what they\u2019ve got to say.\u201d This story has been updated with additional information.

{"id": "2024_07_16_investing_gold-bars-bob-menendez", "text": "On Tuesday, Sen. Bob Menendez was found guilty on 16 counts including bribery, extortion, wire fraud, obstruction of justice and acting as a foreign agent. A key piece of evidence prosecutors presented to jurors during the nearly seven-week-long trial was the gold bars the FBI seized from the senator\u2019s home which he and his wife allegedly received in exchange for acting on behalf of foreign government officials and business people. Menendez maintains his innocence and plans to appeal the verdict, he told reporters outside the Manhattan courtroom on Tuesday. The discovery that Menendez owned a hoard of gold bars stunned many people. Who even owns physical bars of gold these days? Actually, a lot of people. Going for gold Demand for gold\u00a0was already on the rise as people have sought ways to hedge their investments against inflation. Since gold is a tangible asset with a limited supply, it offers that stability. Then, a string of bank failures, beginning with the\u00a0demise of Silicon Valley Bank\u00a0last year, added to the momentum. It was \u201ca wakeup call\u201d to many people, said Jonathan Rose, CEO of Genesis Gold Group, a precious metals firm in Beverly Hills, California. \u201cThere was a feeling of helplessness,\u201d which he said he could attest to since he had money deposited at Western Alliance, which\u00a0came under a significant amount of stress\u00a0in the wake of SVB\u2019s collapse. \u201cA lot of people were fearful thinking, \u2018Maybe my money is not as safe as I thought it was in the banking system.\u2019\u201d As a result, interest in owning gold jumped as people searched for tangible stores of value that \u201ccan\u2019t evaporate,\u201d Rose told CNN. And now even Costco sells gold bars. Ironically, gold hit a record high on Tuesday, the same day Menendez was convicted. That\u2019s because of US investors\u2019 renewed confidence in the prospect of interest rate cuts this year, which also helped the Dow and S&P 500 notch new record highs. The two kilograms and 11 ounces worth of gold bars Menendez and his wife possessed would have been worth over $185,000 as of Tuesday, according to Goldprice.org data. If you can invest in gold, why do people want to physically own it? Even though you can invest in gold and other precious metals without physically owning them, people tend to prefer \u201chaving the currency in their hands,\u201d said Rose. That\u2019s because if, for instance, you invest in a gold ETF, \u201cit\u2019s still tied to the market,\u201d he said. That means if the market were to plunge, you\u2019d be exposed to it and suffer some losses as a result. Where should people keep their gold? Plenty of his clients have buried the gold he\u2019s sold them in the ground, he said. One even stored it in an empty paint can in their garage. Other people who prefer to keep gold under their own roof store it in a gun safe or floor safe, he added. For added assurance, you can take out an insurance policy or keep it in a safe deposit box at a bank, but most of his clients opt not to, he said. However, people who want to invest in IRS-approved physical gold in their tax-deferred investment accounts by law are required to keep it in a bank or with a non-bank trustee.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/16/investing/gold-bars-bob-menendez/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/17/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_07_16_politics_fact-check-night-2-republican-national-convention", "text": "Night two of the Republican National Convention has kicked off in Milwaukee. CNN\u2019s Facts First team is fact checking the convention and will update this page throughout the night. Scalise on migrants coming to the US House Majority Leader Steve Scalise said Tuesday that migrants are arriving in the US after having been deliberately freed from prison. \u201cOn the border, Biden and Harris opened it up to the entire world. Prisons are being emptied,\u201d said Scalise,\u00a0a Louisiana Republican. Facts first: There is no evidence for Scalise\u2019s claim that \u201cprisons of being emptied\u201d\u00a0so that prisoners can travel to the US as migrants.  \u201cI do a daily news search to see what\u2019s going on in prisons around the world and have seen absolutely no evidence that any country is emptying its prisons and sending them all to the US,\u201d said Helen Fair, who is co-author of the\u00a0World Prison Population List, which tracks the global prison population, and a research fellow at the Institute for Crime & Justice Policy Research at Birkbeck, University of London. Trump, now the Republican presidential nominee, has repeatedly made such claims in his own speeches and interviews. But Trump has never provided any proof for the claim. Trump\u2019s campaign has provided CNN with only a vague 2022 article from right-wing website Breitbart\u00a0about a supposed federal intelligence report warning Border Patrol agents about Venezuela freeing violent prisoners who had then joined migrant caravans. But this supposed claim about Venezuela\u2019s actions has never been corroborated, and experts have told CNN, PolitiFact and FactCheck.org that they know of no proof of any such thing having happened. The recorded global prison population increased from October 2021 to April 2024, from about 10.77 million people to about 10.99 million people, according to the World Prison Population List. From CNN\u2019s Daniel Dale\u00a0 Rep. Stefanik claims that Biden presidency has led to the highest inflation of her lifetime Rep. Elise Stefanik of New York claimed in her Republican National Convention speech Tuesday that Biden\u2019s presidency has led to the \u201chighest rate of inflation\u201d in her lifetime. Facts First: This claim is out of date.  While the year-over-year inflation rate in June 2022, about 9.1%, was the highest since late 1981,\u00a0inflation has declined sharply since that Biden-era peak, and the most recent available rate, for June 2024, was about 3%. That rate was exceeded as recently as 2011.Stefanik was born in 1984. From CNN\u2019s Daniel Dale and Piper Hudspeth Blackburn\u00a0 Wisconsin Senate candidate exaggerates the numbers of fentanyl deaths Eric Hovde, the Republican running for Senate in Wisconsin, claimed in his RNC speech Tuesday that the Biden administration \u201cemboldened drug cartels to flood our streets with fentanyl killing over 100,000 Americans every year\u201d by opening the country\u2019s southern border and allowing \u201ccriminals and terrorists to enter the country.\u201d Facts First: It\u2019s a significant exaggeration that fentanyl kills more than 100,000 Americans every year due to the country\u2019s \u201copen\u201d borders. The number of overdose deaths involving synthetic opioids in 2023, including fentanyl, was approximately 75,000, according to estimated and provisional data.\u00a0 The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said\u00a0in May\u00a0that roughly 107,500 people in the US died from a drug overdose, but that is the total number of people who died from an overdose from any kind of drug. Synthetic opioids, including fentanyl, were involved in the majority of those fatalities, making up nearly 70% of overdose deaths in 2023, but they did not account for all of them. In fact, compared with 2022, there were around 1,500 fewer overdose deaths involving fentanyl and other synthetic opioids in 2023. The estimated number of deaths involving cocaine and psychostimulants such as methamphetamines increased in 2023. Specifically, in 2023, there were 74,702 deaths from synthetic opioids, and most of those deaths were from fentanyl. By comparison, in 2022 the estimated number was 76,226, according to the CDC. It is also worth noting that fentanyl is\u00a0largely\u00a0smuggled by US citizens\u00a0through legal ports of entry,\u00a0rather than by migrants sneaking into the country. Contrary to frequent claims by Republicans, the border is not \u201copen\u201d; border officers have seized\u00a0an increasing amount of illicit fentanyl, numbering in the hundreds of millions of pills, under Biden. From CNN\u2019s Jen Christensen Kari Lake on her opponent\u2019s record about voting laws Kari Lake said Tuesday that Democratic Arizona Rep. Ruben Gallego, her likely opponent in the state\u2019s US Senate race this fall, voted last week to let undocumented immigrants \u201cillegally cast a ballot in this upcoming election.\u201d \u201cThese guys are full, they\u2019re full of bad ideas,\u201d Lake said in her speech. \u201cJust last week Ruben Gallego voted to let the millions of people who poured into our country illegally cast a ballot in this upcoming election.\u201d Fact First:\u00a0This claim is false. The House did not vote on whether to allow noncitizens to vote. The chamber\u00a0passed a bill on July 10\u00a0that would require documentary proof of US citizenship to register to vote in federal elections. Gallego voted against the legislation, which is not expected to be taken up by the Democratic-controlled Senate. It is already illegal for noncitizens to vote in federal elections, and\u00a0experts say it rarely occurs. When people register to vote, they must provide a driver\u2019s license or Social Security number, and their identity is checked against existing databases. Voters are required to swear under penalty of perjury that they are a US citizen.\u00a0Noncitizens who vote illegally can face imprisonment or deportation. Gallego\u00a0said in a statement\u00a0that he opposed the bill because its \u201conly purpose is to disenfranchise tens of thousands of Arizonans, and I will not vote to take away the rights of Arizonans to stop something that is already illegal.\u201d \u201cOf course, only U.S. citizens should vote,\u201d said Gallego. \u201cBut this bill isn\u2019t about that, it\u2019s about making it harder for Arizonans to vote, including married women, servicemembers, Native Arizonans, seniors, and people with disabilities.\u201d From CNN\u2019s Piper Hudspeth Blackburn Perry Johnson\u2019s incorrect claim about median family income Perry Johnson, a Michigan business owner who previously ran for governor and president, said Tuesday that income rose consistently under former President Donald Trump. \u201cUnder Trump, family income went up every year. That is a fact,\u201d Johnson told the crowd. Facts first: Johnson is incorrect. Median family income fell in 2020 during the Covid-19 pandemic in both inflation-adjusted and non-adjusted terms. Typical family income grew by several thousand dollars during each of Trump\u2019s first three years in office, before adjusting for inflation. But it fell by $1,660 in 2020, when the pandemic wreaked havoc on the US economy. After factoring in inflation, typical family income fell by nearly $2,900 in 2020, after rising in each of the first three years of Trump\u2019s administration. From CNN\u2019s Tami Luhby  RNC video falsely claims there is \u2018rising crime\u2019 A video played near the beginning of Republican National Committee proceedings on Tuesday evening featured a narrator saying, \u201cIt\u2019s not just big cities. Rising crime is a problem everywhere.\u201d Facts First: The claim that there is a problem \u201ceverywhere\u201d with \u201crising crime\u201d is false. Both violent crime and property crime dropped significantly in the US in 2023 and in the first quarter of 2024, though there were increases in some communities. Preliminary FBI data for 2023 showed a roughly 13% national decline in murder and a roughly 6% national decline in overall violent crime compared to 2022, bringing both murder and violent crime levels below where they were in 2020, Trump\u2019s last calendar year in office. And preliminary FBI data for the first quarter of 2024 showed an even steeper drop from the same quarter in 2023 \u2013 a roughly 26% decline in murder and roughly 15% decline in overall violent crime. There are limitations to the FBI-published data, which comes from local law enforcement \u2013 the numbers are preliminary, not all communities submitted data, and the submitted data usually has some initial errors \u2013 so these statistics may not precisely capture the size of the recent declines in crime. But these statistics and other data sources make it clear crime has indeed declined to some extent nationally, though not everywhere. Crime data expert Jeff Asher, co-founder of the firm AH Datalytics, said that if the final 2023 figures show a decline in murder of at least 10% from 2022, this would be the fastest US decline \u201cever recorded.\u201d And he noted that both the preliminary FBI-published data from the first quarter of 2024 and also \u201ccrime data collected from several independent sources point to an even larger decline in property and violent crime, including a substantially larger drop in murder, so far this year compared to 2023, though there is still time left in the year for those trends to change.\u201d From CNN\u2019s Daniel Dale", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/16/politics/fact-check-night-2-republican-national-convention/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/17/2024", "section": "us"}}

McLauchlen was officially accounted for on January 25, 2024, the agency said. He was buried at Fort Leavenworth National Cemetery on July 8 and honored with a B-1 bomber flyover, according to Fort Leavenworth. On December 1, 1943, McLauchlen\u2019s B-24J Liberator bomber plane reached the intended target but was struck by \u201canti-aircraft fire, causing the left wing to burst into flames,\u201d according to the accounting agency. \u201cMy uncle was in charge of the mission that day, so his plane was right in the front, right in the center,\u201d McLauchlen\u2019s nephew, Richard McLauchlen Jr., said in an interview with the US Army published Thursday. \u201cOnce they started taking fire, and with that smoking wing, my uncle decided to drop out of the formation so that his plane wouldn\u2019t cause anyone else to be shot down,\u201d Richard McLauchlen Jr., who is a Vietnam veteran, said. Witnesses from another plane said they saw the one flown by McLauchlen fall into a steep dive before disappearing beneath clouds, officials reported. \u201cIt was noted that (three) enemy aircraft were also seen following the crippled plane into the clouds, and no further contact was made with the Liberator,\u201d the agency said. \u201cThe remains of the crew were not recovered or identified after the war, and they were all later declared Missing In Action.\u201d McLauchlen served as a member of the 436th Bombardment Squadron, Seventh Bombardment Group in the Army Air Forces at the time of his disappearance. Four years later, the American Graves Registration Service found the remains of what were thought to be eight people involved in a potential B-24 Liberator crash near Yodayadet, Burma, according to the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency. The remains couldn\u2019t be identified scientifically at the time and were sent to Honolulu\u2019s National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific. The accounting agency said it received a family disinterment request in early 2019 for one of the unidentified people \u201cbased on past attempts to associate the remains with other unresolved losses from southern Burma,\u201d according to the release. The remains were exhumed in October 2020 and taken to a Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency laboratory for analysis, the agency said. Scientists used anthropological analysis and circumstantial and material evidence to identify McLauchlen, and the Armed Forces Medical Examiner System used mitochondrial DNA analysis. His nephew\u2019s DNA helped identify him, the US Army reported. \u201cHe was unknown for 80 years, and now he\u2019s here, he\u2019s home, and he\u2019ll never be lost again,\u201d Richard McLauchlen Jr. said of his uncle in the US Army interview. Genetic genealogy blends DNA analysis in the lab with genealogical research, such as tracing a person\u2019s family tree. Lauded as a way to explore personal history and connect with previously unknown kin, such DNA matching also has been used to link victims to criminals such as the Happy Face Killer, who murdered at least eight women, and to identify other long-missing military service members.

Brian Steven Smith received 99-year sentences each for the deaths of Kathleen Henry, 30, and Veronica Abouchuk, who was 52 when her family reported her missing in February 2019, seven months after they last saw her. \u201cBoth were treated about as horribly as a person can be treated,\u201d Alaska Superior Court Judge Kevin Saxby said when imposing the sentence. \u201cIt\u2019s the stuff of nightmares,\u201d Saxby said. The remaining 28 years were for other charges, including sexual assault and tampering with evidence. Alaska does not have the death penalty. Smith, a native of South Africa who became a naturalized US citizen shortly before torturing and killing Henry at an Anchorage hotel in September 2019, showed no emotion during sentencing. He also displayed no emotion when\u00a0a jury deliberated for less than two hours\u00a0and found him guilty after a three-week trial in February. During the trial, the victims were not identified by name, only initials. Saxby said during sentencing that their names would be used in order to restore their personhood. Smith was arrested in 2019\u00a0when a sex worker stole his cellphone from his truck and found the gruesome footage of Henry\u2019s torture and murder. The images were eventually copied onto a memory card, and she turned it over to police. Smith eventually confessed to killing Henry and Abouchuk, whose body had been found earlier but was misidentified. Both Alaska Native women were from small villages in western Alaska and experienced homelessness when living in Anchorage. Authorities identified Henry as the victim whose death was recorded at TownePlace Suites by Marriott in midtown Anchorage. Smith, who worked at the hotel, was registered to stay there from September 2-4, 2019. The first images from the card showed Henry\u2019s body and were time-stamped about 1 a.m. September 4, police said. The last image, dated early September 6, showed Henry\u2019s body in the back of a black pickup. Charging documents said location data showed Smith\u2019s phone in the same rural area south of Anchorage where Henry\u2019s body was found a few weeks later. Videos from the memory card were shown during the trial to the jury but hidden from the gallery. Smith\u2019s face was never seen in the videos, but his distinctive South African accent \u2014 which police eventually recognized from previous encounters \u2014 was heard narrating as if there were an audience. On the tape, he repeatedly urged Henry to die as he beat and strangled her. \u201cIn my movies, everybody always dies,\u201d the voice says on one video. \u201cWhat are my followers going to think of me? People need to know when they are being serial-killed.\u201d During the eight-hour videotaped police interrogation, Smith confessed to killing Abouchuk after picking her up in Anchorage when his wife was out of town. He took her to his home, and she refused when he asked her to shower because of an odor. Smith said he became upset, retrieved a pistol from the garage and shot her in the head, dumping her body north of Anchorage. He told police the location, where authorities later found a skull with a bullet wound in it.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/15/us/brian-steven-smith-alaska-murders/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/17/2024", "section": "us"}}

{"id": "2024_07_16_politics_iran-plot-assassinate-trump-secret-service", "text": "US authorities obtained intelligence\u00a0from a human source\u00a0in recent weeks on a plot by Iran to try to assassinate Donald Trump, a development that led to the Secret Service increasing security around the former president,\u00a0multiple\u00a0people briefed on the matter told CNN. There\u2019s no indication that\u00a0Thomas Matthew Crooks, the would-be assassin who attempted to kill the\u00a0former\u00a0president on Saturday, was connected to the plot, the sources said. The existence of the intelligence threat from a hostile foreign intelligence agency \u2014\u00a0and the enhanced security for Trump \u2014 raises new questions about the security lapses at the Saturday rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, and how a 20-year-old man managed to access a nearby rooftop to fire shots that injured the former president. A US national security official said the Secret Service and Trump campaign were made aware of the threat before Saturday\u2019s rally. \u201cSecret Service learned of the increased threat from this threat stream,\u201d the official told CNN. \u201cNSC directly contacted USSS at a senior level to be absolutely sure they continued to track the latest reporting.\u00a0USSS shared this information with the detail lead, and the Trump campaign was made aware of an evolving threat. In response to the increased threat, Secret Service surged resources and assets for the protection of former President Trump. All of this was in advance of Saturday.\u201d The Trump campaign would not disclose whether it was made aware of the Iran threat.\u00a0\u201cWe do not comment on President Trump\u2019s security detail. All questions should be directed to The United States Secret Service,\u201d the campaign said in a statement. Secret Service officials have warned the Trump campaign repeatedly against holding outdoor rallies, which pose greater risks than events to which the agency can better control access, people briefed on the matter said.\u00a0The warnings have been more general in nature, the sources said. \u201cThe Secret Service and other agencies are constantly receiving new potential threat information and taking action to adjust resources, as needed,\u201d Anthony Guglielmi, an agency spokesman, said on Tuesday. \u201cWe cannot comment on any specific threat stream, other than to say that the Secret Service takes threats seriously and responds accordingly.\u201d At one point during this\u00a0election\u00a0cycle, the campaign stopped holding spontaneous\u00a0off-the-record events where guests weren\u2019t swept by\u00a0Secret\u00a0Service beforehand due to security concerns, a source familiar with the matter told CNN. The FBI, which is conducting the investigation into Saturday\u2019s shooting, declined to comment. NSC spokesperson Adrienne Watson said there\u2019s\u00a0no\u00a0known link between shooter Thomas Matthew Crooks and\u00a0anyone\u00a0else at the moment. \u201cThe investigation of Saturday\u2019s attempted assassination of former President Trump is active and ongoing.\u00a0At this time, law enforcement has reported that their investigation has not identified ties between the shooter and any accomplice or co-conspirator, foreign or domestic,\u201d Watson said. The Permanent Mission of the Islamic Republic of Iran to the United Nations denied there is an Iranian plot to assassinate Trump. \u201cThese accusations are unsubstantiated and malicious. From the perspective of the Islamic Republic of Iran, Trump is a criminal who must be prosecuted and punished in a court of law for ordering the assassination of General Soleimani. Iran has chosen the legal path to bring him to justice,\u201d a spokesperson for the mission told CNN, referencing Qasem Soleimani, the commander of the Iranian military\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, who was killed\u00a0by a US airstrike at Baghdad International Airport in January 2020. CNN\u2019s Fareed Zakaria pressed Iran\u2019s acting Foreign Minister Ali Bagheri Kani on the alleged Iranian assassination plot, asking in an interview if the plot was in retaliation for Soleimani\u2019s killing, which took place during the Trump administration. \u201cI told you explicitly that we would resort to legal and judicial procedures and frameworks at the domestic level and international level in order to bring the perpetrators and military advisers of General Soleimani\u2019s assassination to justice,\u201d Kani told Zakaria in an interview that will air Sunday on CNN\u2019s \u201cFareed Zakaria GPS.\u201d Pressed further if that meant not using violent measures, Kani said, \u201cWe will only resort to Iranian and international legal and judicial procedures.\u201d \u201cUntil now, we have done it, and this is our right and of course we will continue it. And the Americans openly said that, that they assassinated the senior Iranian military commander. So it is our natural right in order to follow this issue, and those who are accused in this case, they should be brought to justice in a \u2014 in a just court,\u201d Kani said. Trump and the Republican vice presidential nominee, Sen. JD Vance of Ohio, will hold their first official campaign rally together on Saturday at an indoor arena in Grand Rapids, Michigan, the campaign announced Tuesday. Surge of threats from Iranian state-backed media Iran has repeatedly vowed revenge for the US military\u2019s killing of Soleimani. And former senior Trump administration officials who worked on national security have had tight security since leaving\u00a0the\u00a0government. In August 2022, the Justice Department announced criminal charges against a member of the IRGC for allegedly trying to orchestrate the assassination of John Bolton, who served as Trump\u2019s national security\u00a0adviser.\u00a0US\u00a0prosecutors said the plot against Bolton was \u201clikely in retaliation\u201d for Soleimani\u2019s assassination. Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was also a target of the Iranian assassination plot, according to a federal law enforcement source familiar with the investigation and a source close to Pompeo. Trump\u2019s former national security adviser, Robert O\u2019Brien, had a US government security detail due to threats from Iran, like Pompeo and other former Trump officials, but that detail was dropped last summer, according to sources familiar with the matter. O\u2019Brien is now paying for his own private security detail, sources said. Lawmakers were not given a specific reason for the decision, which led to frustration. O\u2019Brien did not respond to a request for comment. Bolton still has his Secret Service detail. For months, law enforcement officials have been concerned about the persistent threat of Iran potentially attempting to assassinate former Trump officials and the former president himself, according to multiple sources familiar with the matter. But the recent intelligence suggested a significant uptick in the threat, the sources told CNN. Warnings about that operational planning have coincided with a noticeable surge of online messaging from Iranian accounts and state-backed media mentioning Trump, which has raised security concerns among US officials, one of the sources told CNN.

{"id": "2024_07_16_us_act-college-entrance-test-changes", "text": "Major changes are coming to the ACT college admissions exam in the spring, the CEO of ACT announced Monday. The exam will be evolving to \u201cmeet the challenges students and educators face\u201d \u2013 and that will include shortening the core test and making the science section optional, chief executive Janet Godwin said in a\u00a0post on the non-profit\u2019s website. The changes will begin with national online tests in spring 2025 and be rolled out for school-day testing in spring 2026, Godwin said in the post. The decision to alter the ACT follows changes made to the SAT earlier this year by the College Board, the non-profit organization that develops and administers that test. The SAT was shortened by a third and went fully digital. Science is being removed from the ACT\u2019s core sections, leaving English, reading and math as the portions that will result in a college-reportable composite score ranging from 1 to 36, Godwin wrote. The science section, like the ACT\u2019s writing section already was, will be optional. \u201cThis means students can choose to take the ACT, the ACT plus science, the ACT plus writing, or the ACT plus science and writing,\u201d Godwin wrote. \u201cWith this flexibility, students can focus on their strengths and showcase their abilities in the best possible way.\u201d Students who choose to take the science section will receive a standalone score for that section in addition to a STEM score that combines the math and science sections. Similarly, the optional writing section already yielded its own score. The\u00a0core ACT\u00a0exam will\u00a0be significantly shorter, down from about three hours to two hours, Godwin wrote. \u201cTo achieve this, the test will include shorter passages on the reading and English sections and fewer questions in each section \u2013 44 fewer questions in all \u2013 allowing students more time to answer each question thoughtfully,\u201d Godwin wrote. \u201cThis change is designed to make the testing experience more manageable for students, enabling them to perform at their best without the fatigue that often accompanies longer exams,\u201d she said. The cost of the exam will also go down, Godwin told CNN in an email. Approximately 60% of students who graduated in 2023 took the ACT exam at least once,\u00a0according to the organization. Last fall, the non-profit reported students\u2019 average scores had dropped for a sixth consecutive year. The class of 2023 had an average composite score of 19.5, down from 19.8 by the 2022 graduating class. And about 20.8% met all four benchmarks in English, reading, math and science in 2023, down from 22.1% in 2022, the non-profit said. Benchmarks are what the organization considers minimum scores to indicate a student\u2019s high chance of success in first-year college courses. According to a\u00a0report from Common App, 43% of college students submitted ACT or SAT scores in 2022, following a movement by colleges to make college entrance exams optional. However, some schools have reversed course, requiring students to\u00a0submit their scores again. \u201cAs ACT continues to innovate and adapt, our dedication to providing accessible, reliable, and forward-thinking readiness solutions remains steadfast, ensuring every learner has the opportunity to succeed,\u201d Godwin said in the online post. This year, the company began offering a\u00a0digital version of the exam, though students still can opt to take the ACT with paper and pencil. It also launched \u201cEncourage,\u201d which is a free college and career program. \u201cThrough this change we will provide an avenue for students to demonstrate what they know, not how fast they can tell us what they know,\u201d Godwin told CNN in an email.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/16/us/act-college-entrance-test-changes/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/17/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_07_15_us_religious-groups-women-leaders-blake-cec", "text": "A week after she went on National Public Radio to urge the Southern Baptist Convention to officially accept women as pastors, the\u00a0Rev. Kristen Muse\u00a0received an unusual letter at her church office. The letter, addressed directly to Muse, was stuffed in a large manila envelope along with three pages of scriptural references. The writer asked Muse how she could call herself a pastor when the Apostle Paul said that \u201cI do not permit a woman to teach or have authority over a man; she must be silent\u201d in 1 Timothy 2:11-12. And, by the way, why was she wearing her hair long in church when the Bible clearly states that women should cover their heads or wear their hair short during worship? Muse then looked closer at the signature at the bottom of the letter: It was a woman\u2019s name. \u201cIt hurt,\u201d says Muse, the executive pastor of Hayes Barton Baptist Church in Raleigh, North Carolina. Her church is considering leaving the SBC because the denomination\u2019s statement of faith declares that \u201cthe office of pastor/elder/overseer is limited to men as qualified by scripture.\u201d \u201cIt hurts even more to know that\u2019s a woman is saying that,\u201d adds Muse, whose congregation has skirted the ban on women pastors because the SBC has traditionally allowed individual congregations some autonomy (her church is headed by a male senior pastor). \u201cI just wonder how long her hair is.\u201d Here\u2019s another question the letter writer would not have dared ask: Why do millions of women belong to religious groups like the SBC that do not treat them as equal to men or allow them to have full control of their bodies? Women in some churches face a \u2018stained glass ceiling\u2019 The question is worth asking now because the debate over women clergy has resurfaced since the SBC \u2013 the US\u2019 largest Protestant denomination, with about 13 million members \u2013 made two highly publicized recent decisions involving women. First, its \u201cmessengers,\u201d or lay representatives, voted at their annual meeting last month to adopt a resolution declaring the SBC\u2019s opposition to in vitro fertilization, or IVF, a popular fertility treatment used by couples who cannot naturally conceive. And second, members voted down an amendment that would \u201cclarify that the SBC only cooperates with churches that do not affirm, appoint or employ a woman as a pastor of any kind.\u201d That move, though, may only be temporary. The SBC has already expelled at least three churches, including one this year, for affirming female pastors. And the Rev. Clint Pressley, its newly elected president, supported the amendment. Glance at photos from the SBC\u2019s annual meeting in Indiana this year, and you\u2019ll see what seems like a disconnect: Thousands of women raising their hands to support an amendment that would keep them out of the pulpit and restrict their full bodily autonomy. Many accept the denomination\u2019s official teaching that wives should \u201csubmit\u201d to their husbands because, as the wife of one SBC leader once declared, a woman\u2019s \u201csubmission in the home is actually training ground for submission to the Heavenly Father.\u201d Submission does not mean subservience \u2014 it means honoring the Bible, SBC leaders say. Some Southern Baptist leaders, for example, say they do not oppose women running for political office. But some also say the Bible declares that women should not have spiritual authority over men. \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of biblical commitment, a commitment to the scripture that unequivocally, we believe, limits the office of pastor to men,\u201d R. Albert Mohler Jr., president of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, said last year. \u201cIt is an issue of biblical authority.\u201d This stance toward women, though, is not limited to the SBC. Countless other female churchgoers are limited by what some call the \u201cstained-glass ceiling.\u201d Many religious communities don\u2019t allow them to be ordained as pastors, bishops or priests. The Roman Catholic Church, with roughly 52 million members in the US, does not ordain women as bishops or priests. Neither does one of the nation\u2019s largest predominantly Black Christian groups, the Church of God in Christ (COGIC), or a handful of other conservative denominations. Nor are these restrictions limited to Christian communities. Some Muslim groups consider the prospect of a female imam leading men in prayer within a mosque as heretical.\u00a0 As a rule, orthodox Jewish groups do not accept women rabbis, but there are rare exceptions. We live in an era where Kamala Harris, a woman, is the vice president of the US. Women CEOs lead Fortune 500 companies, run countries and command men in battle. And yet millions of women still give their time and money to church groups that won\u2019t allow them to lead men. One of them is Muse, who remains a member of the Southern Baptist Convention. \u201cThat\u2019s a hard question,\u201d Muse says after a long pause, when asked why she belongs to the SBC given its policy. Muse compares her relationship to the SBC to a close friend. She said that while she may disagree with the friend on some things, she values the relationship because they agree on the big issues. \u201cYou want to guard the relationship, because the things you don\u2019t agree on are minimal compared to the things you do agree with,\u201d Muse says. \u201cThe main thing we agree on is that Jesus Christ is Lord, and we can work through the other things in love.\u201d Some women, however, can\u2019t work through those differences \u2014 and ultimately leave groups like the SBC. So, what\u2019s the difference between them and women like Muse? CNN asked Muse and other Southern Baptist women that question. Here are three reasons why breaking away is hard for some to do. Reason 1: They believe in a \u2018separate but equal\u2019 theology Some outsiders may dismiss women who accept a ban on women clergy as caricatures, as stay-at-home housewives who bobble-head nod \u2018yes\u2019 to everything men say. Many women, though, hold sincere beliefs in a theology called \u201ccomplementarianism.\u201d Complementarians believe that God created men and woman as equals, but with separate roles for each. \u201cWe do not get to dictate what manhood and womanhood are all about. Our Creator does,\u201d is how Mary Kassian, a women\u2019s studies professor at Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, explains her support for complementarianism. Complementarians say that \u201csome governing and teaching roles in the church are restricted to men\u201d and cite scriptures that prohibit women from assuming authority over men. \u201cThey have been convinced that to be a godly woman is to support male leadership, and that if they leave that stance, they will be abandoning biblical truth,\u201d says Beth Allison Barr, author of called \u201cThe Making of Biblical Womanhood: How the Subjugation of Women Became Gospel Truth.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Many women find other ways to assert their leadership. Barr says the SBC has created \u201cempowering mechanisms\u201d that allow women to serve in leadership roles, such as leading music or children\u2019s ministries or preaching sermons toward women. The Roman Catholic Church has also created what some may describe as empowering mechanisms for women. The church does not allow women to be priests, in part because its leaders say that Jesus only chose men as his twelve apostles. Pope Francis, though, changed canon law to allow women to serve as acolytes and lectors \u2014 laypeople who perform functions such as setting up the altar and reading the Bible. Even with this stained-glass ceiling, some women are so charismatic and eloquent that they amass a following. One prominent example is author and speaker Beth Moore, who preaches to arenas filled with women and writes popular books. Moore, though, has become outspoken in recent years about confronting what she describes as widespread sexism and racism within the SBC. She left the SBC in 2021 in part over its emphasis on complementarianism. Critics of complementarianism say it uses semantics to obscure sexism. Separate is never equal, they say. \u201cThe phrase, \u2018separate but equal\u2019 was used a lot during segregation as a tool to continue the power of White supremacy,\u201d says the Rev. Meredith Stone, executive director of Baptist Women in Ministry, a group that works with the SBC and other Baptist groups. \u201cWell, we\u2019re \u2018equal\u2019 but we have to be separate. They\u2019re using the same framework.\u201d Reason 2: Leaving can be traumatic for their family There\u2019s a good reason why congregations often refer to themselves as a family. Infants get baptized in churches. Children join church youth groups. People get married and eulogized in congregations. But imagine all the friendships and support systems that you and your family leaned on being yanked away. That\u2019s the prospect some women face if they leave a church group like the SBC. They get canceled, according to Barr. Barr has experienced that pain. A former SBC member, she drew criticism when she published a book on the subjugation of women in 2021, five years after she says she and her husband abandoned complementarian theology. She left an evangelical church in Texas that wouldn\u2019t allow women clergy. Barr, a history professor who specializes in women and religion at Baylor University, says her family paid a price. \u201cMy husband and I said \u2026 it was worse than divorce,\u201d Barr says. \u201cIt was a traumatic experience. You get labeled liberal, progressive, and not being good Christians or godly.\u201d Research shows that when human beings experience rejection, the brain processes the emotional impact like physical pain. Barr didn\u2019t need a study to confirm that finding. The potential trauma of leaving a church group is so painful that some women decide it\u2019s not worth it, she says. \u201cYou think about wives whose husbands may not agree with them on this issue and they\u2019re being taught that their godly role is to be submissive to their husband\u2019s leadership,\u201d Barr says. \u201cAnd so they stay because their husbands choose to stay, because their children are in that church, and all their friends are in that place. \u201cI mean, it was so disruptive to our children for us to be pulled out. It was trauma in our whole family. I understand why people stay.\u201d The fear of leaving a church group can even shape how a woman approaches having control of her body.  Cait West, author of \u201cRIFT: A Memoir of Breaking Away from Christian Patriarchy,\u201d says she grew up in a \u201cChristian patriarchy movement\u201d that\u2019s become popular in some evangelical and conservative Protestant churches. She says she was not taught sex education, the concept of consent or that she should control her own body. \u201cIf I were to exert any semblance of my own rights to my life and body, I would have been labeled sinful and possibly excommunicated,\u201d she wrote. \u201cFear of abandonment and exile kept me in check.\u201d Sometimes a woman who leaves their church even risks losing the support of family members. \u201cMy mom, she doesn\u2019t really understand it,\u201d says Muse, about her role as an executive pastor, which entails preaching sermons during Sunday morning service. \u201cWe didn\u2019t see women preach or do ministerial things in the churches that we grew up with. But she\u2019s always encouraged me to do what makes me happy and feel led to do even though she\u2019s not understanding it.\u201d Reason 3: The financial benefits of the church outweigh the cost of leaving In one of the most famous passages of the New Testament, Jesus advises his disciples to \u201ccount the cost\u201d of following him. Those who leave the SBC must consider a similar calculus. Plenty of women in the SBC are also working in pastoral roles in SBC churches. Many are on staff and enjoy what some say are hidden perks of SBC membership: good health insurance and retirement plans. A woman might want to leave the SBC because of her principles, but principles won\u2019t help her pay for her kid\u2019s braces. \u201cEven male pastors that have reached out to me,\u201d Barr says, \u201cand they\u2019re like, \u2018I want to support women, but I\u2019m the breadwinner of my family. All of the benefits are through me. We have four kids. If I lose my job, my family loses all of that.\u2019 \u201c Some women don\u2019t see a way out for them or their families, she says. \u201cWhen you are living in that system, it is so oppressive,\u201d Barr says. \u201cThe cost is all you can see.\u201d Muse says her congregation is considering those costs now as well. Her church\u2019s retirement fund is offered through the SBC, which would complicate efforts to leave. Some women find ways to rationalize staying in the SBC even if they don\u2019t agree with its policies. Some take on the full-time work of pastors, minus the title and the salary. Their rationalization: I don\u2019t care what you call me; I know God has called me. But some who left say the price was worth paying. \u201cThe gains are so huge,\u201d Barr says. \u201cOnce you get out of that type of system, you realize how much you have been lied to, how much bigger God is, how small God was made in that church. You realize that throughout church history, women have always served in these roles. You can breathe again.\u201d The debate over women pastors is as old as the Bible Muse knows that church history that Barr alludes to, but that doesn\u2019t stop insecurities from creeping in at times. She says she sometimes experiences imposter syndrome and wonders if she is good enough and deserves her success. She feels this when she receives letters like the one from her woman critic. \u201cWhen somebody does question it, I think we all think, \u2018Am I really believing what I believe?\u2019\u201d Muse says about female pastors. \u201cAnd as a woman, I don\u2019t want to cause conflict in my congregation or for it to be about me or anything like that.\u201d It also stings to know that she is not welcome at some SBC churches in Raleigh, where her church is located. \u201cThere are churches that would not welcome me to even offer a prayer from the pulpit because of who I am,\u201d she says. But when doubts creep in, Muse says she takes refuge in the \u201cmarkers\u201d in her life \u2014 those moments where she felt guided to the pulpit by unseen hands: the exhilarating summer she served as a youth minister; the college professor who assured her she was called to the ministry; a luminous experience she had one night as a young woman when she heard the voice of God say to her about being a pastor, \u201cThis is what I have for your future.\u201d She also takes refuge in the same Bible that those in the SBC cite when arguing against women pastors. She says the Bible is full of women that led or taught men, including Deborah, a prophetess and judge who led ancient Israel; or Lydia, Priscilla and Dorcas, who were praised by the Apostle Paul in various New Testament passages as leaders in the first Christian church. And she also points out that a woman preached the first Easter sermon. It was Mary Magdalene who proclaimed that \u201cHe has risen\u201d on Easter morning. \u201cIf we didn\u2019t have the testimony of these women, our faith would be very different,\u201d Muse says. \u201cI think of women throughout scripture who allowed themselves to be used by God even when they didn\u2019t feel worthy at times.\u201d What Muse doesn\u2019t say is that after Mary proclaimed Jesus\u2019 resurrection to the apostles, she, too, ran into an ancient version of the stained-glass ceiling. The Gospel of Luke says what happened next: \u201cBut they did not believe the women, because their words seemed to them like nonsense.\u201d The Bible says that Jesus then suddenly appeared among them and urged them to look at his hands and feet to prove that he was no ghost. Only then did the disciples believe Mary\u2019s message. Men have been questioning women\u2019s spiritual leadership ever since. And that resurrection story, no matter how often it\u2019s cited, hasn\u2019t convinced enough men that a woman can preach the Gospel to them. That may take another miracle.

{"id": "2024_07_16_us_trump-rally-security-errors-list", "text": "Security errors, lapses and missed opportunities to stop a gunman led to the first shooting of a US president or former president in more than a generation. Here are several issues and problems identified by CNN that could or should have been addressed before the attack on former President Donald Trump. In addition, CNN Chief Law Enforcement and Intelligence Analyst John Miller provided his analysis of some of the issues and their importance. Unsecured rooftop in range of the stage and with clear line of sight The building used by the gunman was outside the \u201chard perimeter\u201d set by the United States Secret Service inside which every person is screened. But less than 500 feet from the stage, the building was within shooting range and had a clear line of sight to where the former president stood to address the crowd. Building access not controlled No one stopped the shooter from reaching the roof of the American Glass Research building. Potential confusion about law enforcement presence Snipers from the Butler County Emergency Services Unit were in the same complex, a source familiar with the ongoing investigation told CNN, but were not aware of the gunman on the roof. They were positioned on the second floor, watching the rally crowd, the source said. Agencies initially blamed each other, unclear who was in charge of that area US Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle told ABC News her agents only \u201cshared support\u201d for the building used for the shooting. \u201cWe sought assistance from our local counterparts for the outer perimeter,\u201d she said. \u201cThere was local police in that building \u2013 there was local police in the area that were responsible for the outer perimeter of the building.\u201d Cheatle said in the same interview that protection for Trump was the responsibility of the Secret Service and \u201cthe buck stops with me.\u201d Crowd flagged gunman on roof almost 2 minutes before shooting Attendees in the crowd noticed the gunman on the roof nearly two minutes before the shots were fired, according to a CNN analysis of witness video and the official video feed of Trump\u2019s speech. As Trump questioned if Biden \u201cwas doing the job,\u201d someone on the video said, \u201cLook they\u2019re all pointing.\u201d One minute and 57 seconds later, gunfire can be heard. \u201cMy wife ran up to law enforcement and was trying to tell them where he was,\u201d Mike DiFrischia, a witness who took video of the shooting, told CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett. \u201cBut they couldn\u2019t seem to see him because they weren\u2019t in the right spot to see him on the roof. They were too close to the building.\u201d Shooter was apparently seen acting suspiciously early by security cordon The shooter was spotted by local law enforcement who thought he might have been acting suspiciously near the magnetometers on Saturday, according to a senior law enforcement official. They put it out over their radio to keep an eye on him \u2013 and that information was passed to Secret Service as well, according to the source. When the shooter left the area of the magnetometers, he apparently wasn\u2019t seen again until people alerted law enforcement in a field outside the event that he was on the rooftop. Local officer unable to tackle gunman before he fired at stage Butler Township police officers were alerted to calls about a suspicious person near the rally on Saturday, the head of another law enforcement agency told CNN. They discovered the man on the roof and one local officer hoisted another to get up to the ledge, Butler County Sheriff Michael T. Slupe said. The shooter turned around, saw the officer peering over and pointed his gun at him. The officer let go of the ledge to \u201ctake cover\u201d and save his life. The gunman then started firing from the rooftop.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/16/us/trump-rally-security-errors-list/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/17/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_07_11_us_taylor-casey-birthday-missing-bahamas-reaj", "text": "The family of Taylor Casey, a Chicago woman who has been missing in the Bahamas for nearly a month, gathered Thursday to mark her birthday and to plead with authorities to continue searching for her. \u201cThe pain I felt 42 years ago while birthing you doesn\u2019t compare to the pain I feel on today with you missing out of our lives,\u201d Colette Seymore, Casey\u2019s mother, said during a news conference in downtown Chicago livestreamed by CNN affiliate WLS. \u201cThe pain, the hurt (and) the agony is practically killing me.\u201d In June, Casey, then 41, traveled to the Bahamas to attend a retreat at Sivananda Ashram Yoga. She was last seen the evening of June 19 around Paradise Island, a small resort enclave just off the shore of the island of New Providence, the most populous island in the Bahamas, the Royal Bahamas Police Force said. Casey\u2019s friends and family described her as a \u201cfixture of Chicago\u2019s transgender community,\u201d in a news release that was shared Wednesday on a social media account dedicated to her disappearance. \u201cTaylor\u2019s disappearance has sent shockwaves through Chicago\u2019s LGBTQ+ community,\u201d the release read. \u201cTaylor\u2019s family and friends are pleading for elected officials, LGBTQ+ leaders and media to elevate her story and pressure elected officials to leverage the federal resources needed to investigate her disappearance.\u201d During the news conference Thursday, Channyn Lynne Parker, CEO of the Brave Space Alliance \u2013 a \u201cBlack-led, trans-led LGBTQ+ center\u201d in Chicago \u2013 said she believes Casey\u2019s identity as a transgender Black woman is stalling the investigation into her disappearance. \u201c(We have) trans women whose lives are being discarded, who are being thought of as nothing but an afterthought. And again, here we are \u2013 having to apply pressure when it should come as second nature and instinct to do what you know to be right,\u201d Parker said. \u201cWe\u2019re here to say right now, emphatically, resoundingly and loudly that we reject that. Black women matter (and) \u2026 Black trans women matter.\u201d Casey was first reported missing on June 20 when she failed to attend morning yoga classes, CNN previously reported. Family and friends have been critical of the way police and the retreat center have handled the investigation into her disappearance. On Thursday, Seymore noted missing person flyers of Casey were not displayed at the Royal Bahamas Police Force Department or at the retreat center. \u201cHow are you looking for my child?\u201d she said. \u201cPeople have to see that somebody is missing and they never put up posters or anything.\u201d Authorities said Casey\u2019s cell phone had been found in the water on June 24, but it was unclear how far the location was from the retreat. \u201cWe have conducted extensive investigation into the matter,\u201d Royal Bahamas Police Force Chief Superintendent Chrislyn Skippings said during a news conference at the time of the discovery. \u201cOur priority is to find Taylor and to find Taylor in good health.\u201d Police have utilized drones, search-and-rescue dogs and divers in the investigation, Skippings said. Amid the investigation into Casey\u2019s disappearance, Michael Johnson, the Royal Bahamas Police Force superintendent in charge of the criminal investigation department, was put on leave pending an investigation, according to a July 5 statement from the police force. CNN reached out to the police force for comment. The Royal Bahamas Police Force posted a release Thursday saying they \u201care aware of an article and video circulating on social media which seeks to imply a correlation between the suspension of (Johnson) and investigations into the missing person, Taylor Casey,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThe information is erroneous and unequivocally unrelated to the investigations.\u201d Emily Williams, a long-time friend of Casey\u2019s, said she traveled to the Bahamas with Casey\u2019s mother to learn more. But upon arriving on the island, Williams said, she knew something was off. \u201cWe weren\u2019t met with caring detectives who wanted to give us an update on where our loved one was. They couldn\u2019t keep details straight, they gave us misinformation and then they tried to push us out,\u201d Williams said during the news conference, adding she and Seymore left early due to feeling \u201cunsafe.\u201d \u201cThey found the phone, but they only found the phone because Taylor\u2019s niece pinged it and gave them the location. They said that they sent out scent dogs, but it came up with nothing. They said that they sent divers and came up with nothing. And what have they done since? We haven\u2019t seen it. They haven\u2019t even reviewed the CCTV footage from the neighboring Atlantis hotel,\u201d Williams continued. Williams and Seymore say they had to \u201cpress\u201d those at the ashram in order to get more information and were not allowed to take pictures or \u201cdisturb\u201d guests. When asked if everyone at the ashram knew of Casey\u2019s disappearance, Williams said the \u201ccolonel overseeing the investigation\u201d told them \u201cmost, but not all\u201d were aware. Jonathan Goldbloom, a representative for the ashram, told CNN Thursday they \u201chave been collaborating fully with the police since we reported that Taylor is missing.\u201d In addition to holding group prayers for Casey, Goldbloom maintained the ashram has provided guests with \u201cregular updates orally and in writing.\u201d Casey\u2019s missing person flyer is posted on their bulletin board, Goldbloom added. \u201cTaylor\u2019s family and friends visit(ed) (sic) the ashram on June 26 for approximately six hours, meeting initially with representatives of the Royal Bahamian police, the US Embassy and the ashram,\u201d Goldbloom wrote to CNN. \u201cDuring Taylor\u2019s friends and family visit, they were asked to not randomly approach guests. The police were clear with their instruction that all guests must consent to speak with them on their own accord.\u00a0We announced their presence to Taylor\u2019s classmates and teachers and invited anyone wanting to meet with them to come forward. Many did, and no one intervened in terms of what individuals are to say.\u201d Casey, who has been practicing yoga for 15 years, went to the yoga retreat \u201cto fulfill a long-term goal of deepening her practice. Eager to return to Chicago, she looked forward to sharing her newfound knowledge and experience with others,\u201d a June 24 release said. A 2023 report on human rights practices in the Bahamas conducted by the US Department of State\u2019s Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor found \u201cLGBTQI+ individuals faced social stigma and discrimination and did not believe they were adequately protected by authorities.\u201d The study also found there was \u201cgenerally low social tolerance for same-sex relationships,\u201d \u201chomophobic epithets were common and socially acceptable,\u201d and a lack of an alternative reporting mechanism of incidents to police and government agents. Williams mentioned in the news conference that the Royal Bahamian Police Force said they will have an update for Casey\u2019s family and friends by Friday. \u201cWe want that update. It\u2019s been three weeks \u2013 we want an update,\u201d she said. Following the news conference a birthday party was held for Casey, that included balloons, snacks and games. \u201cToday is your birthday and we all just want to say happy birthday,\u201d Seymore said to her daughter at the start of Thursday\u2019s news conference. \u201cAlthough, it\u2019s not so happy because you are not here with us.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/11/us/taylor-casey-birthday-missing-bahamas-reaj/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/17/2024", "section": "us"}}
