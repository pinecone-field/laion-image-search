{"id": "2024_06_03_us_edward-blum-fearless-fund-appeal-ruling-reaj", "text": "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th\u00a0Circuit has blocked a Black-owned venture capitalist firm from awarding grants exclusively to Black women entrepreneurs. In an opinion released Monday, the judges ruled that the Fearless Fund\u2019s Fearless Strivers Grant Contest is \u201csubstantially likely to violate\u201d the provisions of\u00a0Title 42 of the US Code, which ensures equal rights under the law and prohibits the use of race when awarding and enforcing contracts. In the ruling, the\u00a0appellate court\u00a0ordered\u00a0a federal court in Georgia to enter\u00a0a preliminary injunction blocking the fund from closing its grant application process while the case continues to be litigated. It also states that the\u00a0fund\u2019s\u00a0program is unlikely to be protected by the First Amendment. The court\u2019s decision marks a victory for anti-affirmative action legal strategist Edward Blum, who filed a lawsuit last August against the fund on behalf of his group American Alliance for Equal Rights. AAER attorneys have argued that their members, who were unnamed in the lawsuit, were excluded from the grant\u00a0program because they weren\u2019t Black and that they faced \u201cadditional harm\u201d from the illegal act of racial discrimination, CNN previously reported. Blum, the legal strategist behind the Supreme Court case that\u00a0dismantled affirmative action\u00a0in college admissions last year,\u00a0said in a statement Monday that he was \u201cgrateful\u201d for the court\u2019s ruling. \u201cOur nation\u2019s civil rights laws do not permit racial distinctions because\u00a0some groups are overrepresented in various endeavors, while others are under-represented,\u201d Blum said. \u201cPrograms that exclude certain individuals because of their race such as the ones the Fearless Fund has designed and implemented are unjust and polarizing. Significant majorities of all Americans believe that an individual\u2019s race should not be a factor in our nation\u2019s public policies.\u201d Arian Simone, CEO and founding partner of Fearless Fund and founder of the Fearless Foundation, said in a statement to CNN Monday that\u00a0the court\u2019s ruling was \u201cdevastating.\u201d \u201cI am shattered for every girl of color who has a dream but will grow up in a nation determined not to give her a shot to live it,\u201d Simone said. \u201cOn their behalf, we will turn the pain into purpose and fight with all our might.\u201d Simone said the ruling sends a message that diversity in corporate America and education should not exist. \u201cAmerica is supposed to be a nation where one has the freedom to achieve, the freedom to earn, and the freedom to prosper,\u201d she said. \u201cYet, when we have attempted to level the playing field for underrepresented groups, our freedoms were stifled.\u201d Eleventh Circuit Judge Robin Rosenbaum issued a dissenting opinion in the case, arguing that Blum\u2019s lawsuit is the equivalent of an athlete \u201cflopping\u201d on the field to draw a foul. \u201cAs American Alliance has portrayed its members\u2019 alleged injuries, it has shown nothing more than flopping on the field,\u201d Rosenbaum wrote in the opinion. \u201cAlthough three of American Alliance\u2019s members pay lip service to the idea they are \u2018ready and able\u2019 to participate in Fearless\u2019 Contest, their declarations show, in context, that none has a genuine interest in actually entering the Contest.\u201d In September 2023, the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta\u00a0granted\u00a0the AAER\u2019s motion for an injunction, which halted the program for the duration of the AAER\u2019s lawsuit. The Fearless Fund later challenged that ruling and its attorneys presented oral arguments to the appeals court in January. The legal battle over the venture capitalist firm\u2019s grant program\u00a0comes amid a\u00a0string of attacks\u00a0against diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs in corporate America, schools and higher education in recent months. Blum and other conservative strategists have filed lawsuits against organizations challenging their race-based programs. In March, the Smithsonian\u2019s National Museum of the American Latino settled a lawsuit with the AAER that required the museum to open its Latino-focused internship program to students of all races and ethnicities. Black business leaders say\u00a0they fear these efforts\u00a0to dismantle DEI programs stand to undo decades of progress toward leveling the playing field for Black and brown people.

{"id": "2024_06_03_politics_bob-menendez-new-jersey-senate-independent", "text": "Indicted Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez of New Jersey filed for reelection Monday as an independent. His decision to file as an independent, first reported by The New Jersey Globe, comes the day before a New Jersey primary in which three Democrats and four Republicans are vying for their parties\u2019 nominations for the seat he currently holds. Menendez, who is facing federal corruption charges and is on trial in New York City, had announced in March that he would not run for a fourth full term as a Democrat, but left open the possibility of an independent bid if exonerated. He faces a Tuesday deadline to file as an independent. New Jersey\u2019s deadline for independent candidates to withdraw from the ballot is August 16. His presence in the race could make the Senate contest in New Jersey more unpredictable, with control of the chamber hanging in the balance. Democrats hold a narrow majority but face a difficult election map this fall. \u201cIt displeases me to have to go this route, thanks to overzealous prosecutors, but I will do what must be done\u00a0to continue to uphold my oath of office for my constituents,\u201d Menendez\u00a0said in a statement Monday evening. \u201cAs I have said before; I have committed no crime. I am more confident than ever that New Jerseyans and the rest of the American public will see me exonerated of what I am being accused of, and I will be re-elected to the Senate once again,\u201d he continued. Rep. Andy Kim, the Democratic front-runner in Tuesday\u2019s primary, criticized what he said were Menendez\u2019s self-interested motives. \u201cAmericans are fed up with politicians putting their own personal benefit ahead of what\u2019s right for the country,\u201d Kim said in a statement. \u201cEveryone knows Bob Menendez isn\u2019t running for the people of New Jersey, he\u2019s doing it for himself. It\u2019s beyond time for change and I\u2019m stepping up to restore integrity back into the U.S. Senate.\u201d Menendez\u2019s federal corruption trial is in its fourth week. The senator, New Jersey businessmen Wael Hana and Fred Daibes, and Menendez\u2019s wife, Nadine, are accused of engaging in a bribery scheme and acting as foreign agents for the Egyptian government. All four have pleaded not guilty. The trial has featured hundreds of text messages, emails, images and voicemails sent between the senator, Nadine Menendez, Hana and an array of friends and business associates with alleged roles in the bribery scheme.

{"id": "2024_05_30_us_minneapolis-incident-officers-injured", "text": "A Minneapolis officer hailed as a hero last year was killed by a gunman who ambushed the officer as he responded to the scene of another shooting, police said. Officer Jamal Mitchell, 36, was one of two people killed Thursday in a pair of shootings that also left four people wounded, authorities said. The gunman, who Minnesota authorities identified on Sunday as Mustafa Ahmed Mohamed, 35, was also killed. Police initially responded to a call about two people shot at an apartment building in Minneapolis\u2019 Whittier neighborhood around 5:15 p.m. Thursday. When officers arrived, someone shot at them immediately, and the officers returned fire, Assistant Police Chief Katie Blackwell said. Mitchell and the suspect were killed and another officer was injured, Blackwell said. She said authorities later found three other civilians who had been shot, one of whom died at the scene. The suspect and the other victim killed, identified as Osman Said Jimale, 32, both died of \u201cmultiple gunshot wounds,\u201d according to the Hennepin County Medical Examiner\u2019s Office. Among the four surviving injured, a Minneapolis police officer and a firefighter suffered non-life-threatening injuries, Blackwell said. They have since been treated and released. The other two suffered life-threatening injuries, including a person who was shot in his vehicle and another who was found in an apartment, Minneapolis police said. They were still in the hospital as of Friday afternoon. \u2018A hero, a son, a father, a fianc\u00e9\u2019 was killed Just three days after he was sworn in to the police department in 2023, Mitchell rushed into a burning, smoke-filled house with another officer to rescue an elderly couple. The rookie Minneapolis cop told CNN he didn\u2019t hesitate to go in. \u201cWe\u2019re not trained to run into fires, but we are trained to put others\u2019 lives in front of ours,\u201d Mitchell told CNN last year. \u201cSo when we found out possibly that someone was in that house, we didn\u2019t second guess running in.\u201d In his final moments Thursday, the young officer responded to a shooting and tried to render first aid to those who had been injured, authorities said. One of the people he was trying to help turned out to be the gunman who would kill him, authorities said. \u201cMitchell was attempting to assist the individual that shot him,\u201d Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension Superintendent Drew Evans said. \u201cIt happened very fast \u2026 he ambushed him.\u201d Mitchell \u201cwas a hero, a son, a father, a fianc\u00e9 and an officer who is so deeply committed to protecting and serving,\u201d Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said. \u201cHe would run towards danger when the rest of us would run in the other direction,\u201d the mayor added. Even though he was a Minneapolis officer for less than two years, Mitchell made a profound impact on the department. \u201cI\u2019ve never met an officer that received an award on the third day on the job,\u201d Blackwell said. And the officer \u201cgave the ultimate sacrifice to protect and save the lives of others,\u201d Frey said. \u201cWe will honor his sacrifice. We will remember his name,\u201d the mayor said. \u201cWe will never forget what he did for the people of our city.\u201d Speaking early Friday morning, Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O\u2019Hara said, \u201cThere are not words to appropriately describe this tragedy.\u00a0It\u2019s the worst call a police chief can receive.\u201d O\u2019Hara says that he had known Mitchell personally. \u201cHe died a hero,\u201d the chief said. \u201cHe died doing what we asked him to do for the rest of us.\u201d The motive remains a mystery It\u2019s still unclear what prompted the gunfire that led to a shootout and two victims killed. Authorities say homicide detectives were trying to determine the motive. Witness Reuben Molina was watching TV with his girlfriend in a third-floor apartment when he heard a \u201cbang.\u201d \u201cThen we heard it again and again and again in rapid succession, and then me and her were like, \u2018Oh, that\u2019s gunshots,\u2019\u201d Molina told CNN affiliate WCCO. He said he thought the sounds came from the floor below them. Molina said they left the apartment to see what was happening. He told WCCO he kept hearing gunshots and saw \u201cpeople shooting,\u201d but couldn\u2019t tell whether those opening fire were officers or civilians. \u201cWhen officers arrived, they received gunfire immediately and they exchanged gunfire,\u201d Blackwell said. Two officers \u2013 Nick Kapinos and Luke Kittock \u2013\u00a0who shot at the suspect are on critical incident leave, according to a Sunday news release from the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension. Kapinos has 10 years of law enforcement experience and Kittock has nine. Kittock was injured during the exchange of gunfire but was later treated and released from the hospital, authorities said. Forensic scientists are collecting evidence, and the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension is working with Minneapolis police to help determine the circumstances surrounding the shooting deaths. Authorities said Friday they are still working on gathering a timeline for the incident that unfolded. \u201cThere is both body-worn and squad car camera video of this incident,\u201d the bureau said in the news release Sunday. \u201cAgents are reviewing all available video as part of their active investigation.\u201d CNN has reached out to the Minneapolis Police Department for more information. \u2018This cannot be the norm\u2019 Across the country, the US has suffered at least 180 mass shootings in just the first five months of this year, according to the\u00a0Gun Violence Archive. Like CNN, the archive defines a mass shooting as one in which four or more people are shot, not including the shooter. And in the first four months of this year, at least 136 officers have been shot in the line of duty \u2013 including 20 who were killed, according to the National Fraternal Order of Police. \u201cThis cannot be the norm,\u201d Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said Thursday night. \u201cIt\u2019s now happened four times in the last couple of months where we\u2019ve had public safety officers responding to the call that people make to 911, rushing into that situation, and in this case being ambushed and a loss of life for Officer Mitchell.\u201d And even though Minneapolis is \u201cstrong\u201d and \u201cresilient,\u201d the mayor said, \u201cWe got to do everything possible to make sure that these tragic events, this epidemic of gun violence, this kind of stuff never happens again.\u201d This is a developing story and will be updated.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/30/us/minneapolis-incident-officers-injured/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/04/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_03_media_pat-mcafee-caitlin-clark-backlash", "text": "ESPN host Pat McAfee has apologized for calling Caitlin Clark a \u201cWhite b*tch\u201d during a Monday show segment over whether race has played a factor in the WNBA rookie\u2019s meteoric rise. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have used \u2018white b*itch\u2019 as a descriptor of Caitlin Clark. No matter the context.. even if we\u2019re talking about race being a reason for some of the stuff happening. I have way too much respect for her and women to put that into the universe,\u201d McAfee\u00a0wrote Monday afternoon on X, formerly known as Twitter. \u201cMy intentions when saying it were complimentary just like the entire segment but, a lot of folks are saying that it certainly wasn\u2019t at all,\u201d he added. \u201cThat\u2019s 100% on me and for that I apologize.\u201d McAfee wrote that he had sent an apology to Clark, as well. The apology came hours after McAfee argued on his program, which airs on both ESPN and YouTube, that it is Clark and Clark alone who is behind the WNBA\u2019s surge in popularity this year, contending that some have argued that it\u2019s because she\u2019s a White player that she\u2019s become so popular. McAfee, the former NFL punter turned shock jock, argued that is not the case, outlining Clark\u2019s dominant television ratings, ticket sales and jersey sales in a game show-style segment he called, \u201cGuess Which WNBA Rookie.\u201d \u201cWhat we\u2019re trying to say is, what the WNBA currently has is what we like to describe as a cash cow. There is a superstar,\u201d McAfee had said. \u201cBut I would like the media people that continue to say, \u2018This rookie class, this rookie class.\u2019 Nah, just call it for what it is. There is one White b*tch for the Indiana team who is a superstar.\u201d McAfee went on to describe how Clark \u201ccarried\u201d Iowa\u2019s basketball program and shattered NCAA scoring records. \u201cIs there a chance people just enjoy watching her play basketball because of how electrifying she is, what she did what she stood for, how she went about going what she went for?\u201d McAfee said. \u201cMaybe. But instead we have to hear people say we only like her because she\u2019s White, and she\u2019s only popular because the rest of the rookie class is doing what they\u2019re doing. Well, that\u2019s a bunch of bulls**t and we think the WNBA \u2014 more specifically their refs \u2014 need to stop trying to screw her over at every single turn. What you have is somebody special and we\u2019re lucky she\u2019s here in Indiana.\u201d While McAfee\u2019s praise of Clark was effusive, his use of the pejorative term \u201cWhite b*tch\u201d and focus on the race of the players drew backlash, including from some ESPN staffers. \u201cThis is just completely unacceptable,\u201d ESPN analyst Kim Adams\u00a0wrote on X. \u201cInterested to see how ESPN handles it. And his entire argument is not conducive to anything going on in the WNBA right now. Just let the women hoop.\u201d \u201cThe men are not ok,\u201d ESPN WNBA reporter Alexa Philippou\u00a0wrote on X,\u00a0shortly after the segment aired. \u201cBeyond unacceptable,\u201d\u00a0wrote\u00a0The Athletic reporter and NBC sports analyst Nicole Auerbach. \u201cReferring to Caitlin Clark as \u2018the white b*tch for Indiana.\u2019 That\u2019s beyond being too comfortable. Just totally unacceptable,\u201d former ESPN host Jemele Hill\u00a0wrote on X. ESPN declined to comment to CNN on the matter. The Indiana Fever did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The backlash wasn\u2019t the first time McAfee has caused headaches for ESPN. Earlier this year, McAfee ignited a torrent of outrage when he allowed the conspiracy-curious New York Jets quarterback Aaron Rodgers to baselessly suggest during his show that ABC late-night talk show host Jimmy Kimmel might be named in documents identifying Jeffrey Epstein associates. McAfee later apologized after Kimmel threatened to take legal action and declared Rodgers would no longer appear on the show for the rest of the season. McAfee also went after former ESPN executive Norby Williamson, accusing the network veteran of \u201csabotage\u201d and calling him a \u201crat,\u201d alleging he leaked false information about McAfee\u2019s show. Just a few months after those attacks, Williamson departed the network. Clark, meanwhile, was named the WNBA Rookie of the Month for May. In 11 games, Clark has averaged 15.6 points, 6.4 assists and 5.1 rebounds.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/03/media/pat-mcafee-caitlin-clark-backlash/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/04/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_03_us_atlanta-boil-water-advisory", "text": "Atlanta remains under a state of emergency Monday as it battles disruptions to its water service that began last week, leaving a swath of a major city under boil-water advisories and highlighting the pervasiveness of problems caused by America\u2019s aging infrastructure. \u201cWe are currently coordinating with the US Army Corps of Engineers. We have sought their assistance because they have the most experience in handling a crisis like this,\u201d Mayor Andre Dickens announced in a statement Monday. \u201cThey will help us develop a plan to assess and evaluate our aging infrastructure.\u201d US Army Corps of Engineers will arrive Tuesday, city officials said. \u201cWhat we have found, in digging and digging and digging and looking at pipes, we are repairing pipes from 1920s, 1930s, 1940s, and our infrastructure is crumbling,\u201d Atlanta Chief Operating Officer LaChandra Burks said at a Monday afternoon city council meeting. City officials plan to partner with federal teams to assess how to improve the city\u2019s infrastructure, she said, adding that while improvements will not prevent water main breaks, they will allow for quicker repairs. The city has been plagued by water woes since Friday, when the first two of a series of water main breaks emerged along two pipes \u2013 one a 36-inch pipe, the other a 48-inch pipe \u2013 that Dickens said were about a century old. One of the pipes that failed was installed in 1910, while another dated to 1930, the mayor said. Repairs were completed on one break near downtown Saturday evening, hours before Dickens declared a state of emergency. On Monday, the city\u2019s watershed management department lifted a boil water advisory that had been in effect since Friday for the area. City officials said public water was safe to use for all purposes. Repairs on the other break, at 11th and West Peachtree streets in Midtown, have yet to be completed, and crews were working on it Monday. Around 1 a.m., crews began turning off water to several blocks within the area, causing a geyser erupting from the break to eventually dissipate, Dickens said at a news conference held at the scene later in the day. His administration is \u201claser-focused\u201d on addressing the issue, he said. A boil water advisory remained in place Monday for that area, city officials said.  Officials were \u201cpleased with the direction that the repairs are going now,\u201d said Al Wiggins Jr., the director of the city\u2019s Department of Watershed Management. He would not provide a timeline for the restoration of service. As of Monday morning, officials did not have a reason to believe the water main breaks were connected, Wiggins said, though he noted crews had not yet been able to conduct a thorough inspection in Midtown. Dickens said there were \u201csome minor breaks\u201d Sunday, two of which he visited: one at 1190 Atlantic Ave., near the Atlantic Station shopping district, and the other in the city\u2019s Candler Park neighborhood. The Department of Watershed Management said repairs were completed on the latter by Sunday afternoon, restoring water to 35 homes. Fire and police officials who also spoke at the Monday news conference said their departments are distributing water in areas where water has been turned off and emphasized that first-responder services have not been impacted. Collectively, the breaks and repairs in progress have left parts of the city without water or under boil water advisories, forcing tourist attractions including the Georgia Aquarium and World of Coca-Cola to shut down. Events, including two Megan Thee Stallion concerts scheduled for Friday and Saturday at State Farm Arena, were postponed. The disruptions prompted Emory University Hospital Midtown to transfer dialysis patients to other hospitals and divert ambulances from its emergency department \u2013 though it resumed normal operations on Sunday, a spokesperson said. Atlanta Public Schools\u2019 summer school and programs were not held Monday, and programs \u201cwill reconvene once the boil water advisories have been lifted,\u201d a notice from the school district said. Non-essential employees have been told to work remotely. \ufeffIn the meantime, the city has designated six fire stations where impacted residents are able to pick up water, according to the Department of Watershed Management. \u201cI know it has been a tough and frustrating day for many of you,\u201d Dickens said Saturday in declaring the state of emergency, which allows the city to expedite access to resources for the repairs. \u201cWe all take\u00a0this matter very seriously.\u201d Atlanta\u2019s troubles in recent days are indicative of a broader issue with decaying infrastructure across the country. In the US and Canada, around\u00a0260,000 water main breaks\u00a0cost $2.6 billion each year, according to a December 2023 study from Utah State University. The study noted the average age of failing water mains is around 53 years and 33% of US and Canadian water mains are over 50 years old. \u2018I take it seriously,\u2019 mayor says of criticism Dickens and the city have faced criticism in the wake of the water main breaks, in part over the pace of the response. The mayor \u2013 who\u2019s up for reelection next year \u2013 said at a news conference this weekend he was in Memphis, Tennessee, on Friday. He was in touch with members of his administration \u201cevery hour,\u201d he said, prior to his return Saturday. \u201cI was gone for less than 24 hours, and then I came right back,\u201d he said. Dickens said he would address the criticism \u201chead on,\u201d telling CNN\u2019s Kate Bolduan he had committed to updates every two hours to keep residents informed through the weekend. \u201cI take it seriously, I take it to heart,\u201d Dickens said of the criticism. \u201cResidents wanted to see more of me Saturday morning before the 2 p.m. press conference. I understand that, and I apologize.\u201d According to a statement from a city spokesperson, when Dickens left Atlanta, officials had not yet realized the severity of the breaks. Dickens did not take questions at Monday\u2019s news conference, which officials abruptly ended after a resident who appeared upset repeatedly asked Wiggins about the status of repairs and when the water would be turned back on. This is a developing story and will be updated.

{"id": "2024_06_03_politics_netanyahu-scheduled-speech-congress", "text": "A date for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s address to Congress remains uncertain after one date initially floated was ruled out because it fell on a Jewish holiday. A US congressional leadership aide initially said Monday that Netanyahu was scheduled to speak on June 13, which falls on\u00a0Shavuot. It also coincides with President Joe Biden\u2019s visit to Italy for a Group of 7 summit. House Speaker Mike Johnson said congressional leaders are looking at various options for Netanyahu to address Congress in light of the scheduling issue. \u201cWe are trying to get this done in the next couple of weeks, and there is a sense of urgency on our side and the prime minister\u2019s, so I hope we can get it done,\u201d the Louisiana Republican told reporters Monday evening. Johnson added, \u201cWe have a couple different options we are looking at \u2014 his staff and mine \u2014 so we will figure it out.\u201d A source familiar with the planning of the visit said Netanyahu is likely to come to Washington in July to address Congress. The top four congressional Republican and Democratic leaders\u00a0extended the invitation\u00a0to Netanyahu last week, but it wasn\u2019t clear at the time whether the prime minister\u2019s visit to Washington would also include a meeting at the White House. Scheduling the speech while Biden is on another continent would have skirted that question. Biden is planning to attend a summit of Group of 7 leaders in Puglia, Italy, which runs from June 13 to 15. The dates have been set for several months. Biden and Netanyahu have spoken by phone regularly since the October 7 attacks by Hamas that set off the current grinding conflict in Gaza, and they last met in person when the president flew to Tel Aviv in the days immediately following the attack. The leaders\u2019 relationship, however, has become strained over Israel\u2019s war plans and over efforts to alleviate humanitarian suffering in the Palestinian enclave. The decision this year to invite Netanyahu to speak to a joint meeting of Congress was not met with unanimous approval among Democrats, some of whom have vowed to boycott the speech. The war in Gaza has divided Democrats; many in the party say Netanyahu has become an obstacle to peace. Even Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer called earlier this year for new elections in Israel, with the implication Netanyahu leave power. But the New York Democrat nonetheless signed on to the letter inviting the prime minister to speak to Congress. \u201cWe join the State of Israel in your struggle against terror, especially as Hamas continues to hold American and Israeli citizens captive and its leaders jeopardize regional stability,\u201d stated the letter from Schumer, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, Johnson and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries. Last week, Biden laid out an Israeli proposal to secure the release of hostages held by Hamas in exchange for a ceasefire, hoping to break a logjam in the stalled negotiations. The move, which was unusual in the level of detail being revealed about another government\u2019s proposal, seemed designed to put Netanyahu on the spot to either support the framework or reject what Biden said was the Israeli government\u2019s own plan. Israel has declined to formally endorse the proposal, however, and Netanyahu told the Knesset\u2019s Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee on Monday that \u201cthe claim that we agreed to a ceasefire without our conditions being met is not true.\u201d He appeared to be referring to the permanent ceasefire outlined in the second phase of the Israeli proposal. Speaking to reporters Monday, White House National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby repeated Biden\u2019s assertion that the proposal the president spelled out was an Israeli plan. \u201cWe\u2019re comfortable that it represents fairly and honestly an Israeli proposal \u2013 a very forward-leaning Israeli proposal, and we\u2019re confident that Hamas needs to take it,\u201d he said.

The 18-story monolith that at one point was the tallest railroad station in the world had fallen derelict, its once opulent halls tattooed with graffiti, stripped for parts, and left scorched and broken. Ronald Butler, who had a 20-year career with the Detroit Fire Department, recalled responding to fires there after it closed in 1988. \u201cWe\u2019ve always been known as the busiest firefighting department in the country,\u201d Butler said. \u201cA lot of that was from buildings being burned by people who needed to get out of a property or burn a property for insurance.\u201d \u201cThere was a sense of hopelessness,\u201d he added. When Detroit became the largest municipality to go bankrupt in 2013, it had fallen hard from its glory days of the early to mid 20th century, when Henry Ford\u2019s arrival and creation of the first-ever moving assembly line vaulted the city into a manufacturing hub and the automotive capital of the world. Now, Michigan Central Station, the neighboring old Book Depository and Butler himself are all symbols of hope for Detroit\u2019s future and its ongoing economic resurgence. Last year, the rehabbed depository was opened to house a blossoming batch of mobility and energy startups, including one helmed by Butler, who started Energy Storage Safety Products International, which makes fire mitigation and prevention technologies for lithium ion batteries. Later this week, Michigan Central Station will reopen to the public as a mixed-used building following a six-year renovation and nearly $1 billion of investment from the Ford Motor Company and its founding family. \u201cCorktown is a very vibrant neighborhood, it\u2019s the oldest neighborhood in Detroit, but there was 30 acres, including this incredible old train station that was literally sitting abandoned and looming over the city as a reminder of the rise and fall of Detroit,\u201d said Mary Culler, a longtime Ford executive and director of the Michigan Central Station innovation district. \u201cIt was a massive project and needed some incredible vision; but \u2026 when I think about what Ford has committed here, it really is incredible, because it is bringing back an asset to the city, along with the 30 acres around it, that is going to be incredibly vibrant,\u201d she added. \u2018You had to fix the place up\u2019 The renewed Michigan Central comes at a critical time in Detroit\u2019s economic recovery, which as been more than a decade in the making, said Kevin Johnson, president and chief executive officer at the Detroit Economic Growth Corporation. The city has come a long way since July 18, 2013, when Detroit was the largest municipality in US history to file for bankruptcy after years of declining revenue, population losses, rising crime, a national financial crisis, automaker struggles and political corruption. \u201cAny city worth its own salt has a vibrant downtown that pumps the blood into the neighborhoods that it needs in order for the revitalization in the neighborhoods to start taking place,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s been a theme in Detroit since 2013. Right when the bankruptcy happened, philanthropic, corporate, neighborhood groups, outside investors began to look at Detroit as a [growth] opportunity, versus an opportunity to close it out and close it down.\u201d And it started with the basics: repairing sidewalks, turning back on streetlights, revitalizing the riverfront, coordinating trash pickup, demolishing homes that were left abandoned, razing industrial facilities that had fallen into ruin. \u201cThe fundamentals of running a city was the core of what started this revitalization,\u201d he said. \u201cYou had to fix the place up.\u201d A resurgence within the automotive industry and Detroit\u2019s \u201cBig Three\u201d helped boost those efforts, Johnson said. \u201cThe automotive industry began to recreate itself into a new and powerful job creator for Detroit,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was a demand from the Big Three that we want you as close to our production base as possible, and that gave rise to those suppliers taking some of those old abandoned facilities and regenerating them.\u201d The economic data speaks volumes of that long road back: The city is adding jobs, generating revenue and, for the first time in decades, adding population. As of April, Detroit\u2019s unemployment rate was 3.8%, a tick better than the US overall rate of 3.9%, Bureau of Labor Statistics data shows. \u201cI look at the unemployment rate to gauge the overall health of the labor market, which I think is an indicator of how the general economy is faring,\u201d said Charles Dougherty, senior economist at Wells Fargo. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty low, and has been low over the past few years.\u201d He added: \u201cI\u2019m not going to say that Detroit is fully on its way to a robust period of economic growth, but there are early indications that Detroit is at the beginning stages of mounting a comeback.\u201d Residents like Butler have had a front row seat to the resurgence. \u201cWhat you look for are cranes in the skylines, and now you see them everywhere, and it\u2019s a beautiful thing because it\u2019s something positive for the city.\u201d he said. \u201cBut, ostensibly, it took for [the bankruptcy] to happen in order to get the investments and get people coming in and seeing the high upsides of the city.\u201d He added: \u201cBut now you see it everywhere, and it\u2019s nowhere more apparent than here at Michigan Central.\u201d Creating beauty from blight The resurrection of Michigan Central Station was no small feat. \u201cIt was the most infamous symbol of Detroit\u2019s decline, the international poster child of \u2018ruin [photography],\u2019\u201d Dan Austin, Michigan Central\u2019s spokesperson who has long chronicled the city\u2019s architectural history on HistoricDetroit.org. Fifteen years ago, the station was the bleak and blighted backdrop for rap artist and native son Eminen\u2019s music video for \u201cBeautiful,\u201d a song about his struggles with drug addiction. The video began with the phrase, \u201cIn 1950, Michigan was 1 of 8 states in America that collectively produced 36% of the world\u2019s GNP. Detroit was the greatest manufacturing city in the world.\u201d When Ford bought Michigan Central Station in 2018 for $90 million, Chairman Bill Ford told CNN\u2019s Poppy Harlow at the time that the building\u2019s decay was \u201clike a knife through my heart.\u201d The vision was to restore the building to its prior state of grandeur, outfit the ground floor with restaurants and retail \u2014 similar to the refurbishment of Denver\u2019s Union Station \u2014 and place offices and a hotel in the stories above. The neighboring building and surrounding acreage would be complementary to the task of creating a high-tech innovation district hubbed by Ford. During the past six years, more than 3,000 skilled tradespeople spent a combined 1.7 million hours to meticulously renovate the building. That painstaking work (including 450 hours dedicated to the hand-carving of a Corinthian column framing the main entrance) involved Ford Motor Company buying and reopening an Indiana quarry that served as the source for the original limestone. \u201cThe amount of love poured into this thing, the attention to detail getting it right \u2026 I don\u2019t know whether there\u2019s ever been a restoration project of this scale,\u201d Austin said. When Michigan Central Station officially reopens this Thursday \u2014 with a sold-out concert produced by Eminem and boasting a lineup of Detroit performers including Diana Ross and Jack White, according to an announcement Monday \u2014 it will serve as the second act of Ford\u2019s billion-dollar innovation district. Last year, the neighboring Book Depository building was reopened as Newlab at Michigan Central, a tech hub for startups and early stage companies. Nearly 100 firms operate there today, including many bridging the energy, mobility and manufacturing sectors. The projects under way include developing streets that charge electric vehicles, robots that can handle last-mile deliveries and a \u201cGoogle Maps for drones.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s really grown into an extraordinary and thriving ecosystem,\u201d said Josh Sirefman, CEO of Michigan Central Station. And with Michigan Central Station coming online, that\u2019s only expected to grow. \u201cThat\u2019s the poetry of those catalytic investments by Ford into physical assets that were symbols of both a past time and then of decline,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd they\u2019re the epicenter of this work that is positioning Detroit once again as a leader.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/03/economy/detroit-michigan-central-station/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/04/2024", "section": "us"}}

Jordan Acker, who serves as a regent for the University of Michigan and partner for Goodman Acker, called the crime \u201can enormously difficult moment for me personally and for this entire community.\u201d\u00a0A regent is a state official elected to a board that oversees the university\u2019s governance. The incident\u00a0is the second in a matter of weeks that Acker said he was targeted. The law office\u00a0was graffitied with\u00a0phrases like, \u201cdivest now,\u201d and \u201cfree Palestine,\u201d on the building itself and on the sidewalk in front\u00a0of the building, pictures from the firm show. One message apparently directed toward the attorney reads, \u201cF**k you Acker.\u201d The Southfield Police Department is investigating the incident as a hate crime, Chief of Police Elvin Barren said at a Monday news conference, calling the vandalism \u201chorrific.\u201d The FBI, University of Michigan police and Huntington Woods police are assisting with the investigation, Barren added. \u201cMake no mistake that targeting individual Jewish elected officials is antisemitism,\u201d Acker said at the news conference. \u201cThis has nothing to do with Palestine, or the war in Gaza, or anything else. This is done as a message to scare Jews.\u201d \u2018An attack on our values and our mission,\u2019 founding partner says In a prior incident, a\u00a0masked intruder came to the door of\u00a0Acker\u2019s\u00a0home on May 15\u00a0at 4:30 a.m.,\u00a0he\u00a0said on\u00a0X, noting his three daughters were asleep at the time. He\u00a0called\u00a0that incident \u201cunacceptable\u201d and said he would not be intimidated. Barry Goodman, a founding partner of the firm, said Monday\u2019s incident \u201cwas not an attack on our office but an attack on our values and our mission.\u201d Goodman\u00a0went on to say the firm is not only owned by Jewish members, but also by Muslims and Christians. \u201cWe proudly serve all faiths, all races, and have been doing so for over 30 years,\u201d Goodman\u00a0said. \u201cThis is absolutely ridiculous; this is a crime.\u201d Goodman\u00a0said protesters are free to walk the sidewalk, hold signs, make statements, \u201ceverything that the Constitution allows, but they can\u2019t do this.\u201d Southfield police officers said a preliminary investigation revealed that four people were captured on surveillance video outside the law office Monday morning at 1:39 am, Barren said during the news conference. The individuals were at the office for about seven minutes, Barren said. CNN has reached out to police for the surveillance video. University of Michigan President Santa J. Ono called the incident \u201cunacceptable\u201d in a statement to CNN. \u201cThe vandalism that occurred at Regent Jordan Acker\u2019s place of business is shocking and unacceptable. Singling out this dedicated public servant and defacing his workplace in the middle of the night is an act of antisemitic cowardice that Southfield police have indicated is being investigated as a hate crime. Such harassment and attempts to intimidate have no place in a civil society and certainly no place in our university community,\u201d Ono said. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer described the vandalism as \u201cabhorrent\u201d in a statement. \u201cViolence, vandalism, threats, and intimidation are unacceptable, and what we saw today in Southfield is abhorrent,\u201d Whitmer said. \u201cWe must remain united in calling out hatred of any kind and continue working together toward peace in Michigan.\u201d Acker on Monday said he was \u201cdeeply grateful\u201d for the support \u201cfrom all walks of life\u201d he\u2019s received in the wake of the incident. \u201cI was not targeted here today because I am a regent.

In an update, NYSE said impacted stocks have reopened and \u201call systems are currently operational.\u201d Intercontinental Exchange, the parent company of NYSE, has found no indication the glitch was caused by a cyberattack, a senior executive at a major bank in touch with ICE told CNN. Instead, an NYSE spokesperson said there was a \u201ctechnical issue\u201d with industry-wide price bands that \u201ctriggered\u201d trading halts on up to 40 symbols listed on NYSE Group exchanges. NYSE noted that those price bands are published by the Consolidated Tape Association\u2019s (CTA) Security Information Processor (SIP). CTA, an industry group, is responsible for publishing real-time trade and quote data. CTA said it\u00a0experienced an issue\u00a0that \u201cmay have been related to a new software release.\u201d\u00a0To fix the issue, the\u00a0industry group said it relied on a secondary data center operating on the older version of the software. Dozens of stocks were paused earlier in the day, an indication they traded outside those so-called limit up-limit down bands, according to\u00a0NYSE\u2019s website. That list includes Chipotle and Berkshire Hathaway, the holding company run by legendary investor Warren Buffett. For nearly two hours, Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s Class A shares were listed as trading at just $185.10 \u2014 a price that would represent a loss of 99.97%. Berkshire closed at $627,400 on Friday. NYSE announced it has decided to \u201cbust,\u201d or cancel, all \u201cerroneous\u201d trades for Berkshire between 9:50 am ET and 9:51 am ET at or below $603,718.30. The exchange said that ruling is not eligible for appeal and indicated it could cancel other trades. \u201cWe are monitoring the issue and engaging with market participants,\u201d a spokesperson for the Securities and Exchange Commission told CNN. Joe Saluzzi, co-founder of Themis Trading, told CNN that the NYSE\u2019s explanation is hard to square with the bizarre trades that hit the tape. \u201cI\u2019m not buying that explanation. That doesn\u2019t make any sense to me,\u201d said Saluzzi, a market structure expert and author of \u201cBroken Markets.\u201d Trading data provided by Refinitiv shows that Berkshire Hathaway changed hands at $620,700 as of 9:44:32 on Monday morning. And then, without any explanation, the stock crashed to just $185.10. \u201cAll of a sudden, there was a $185 print. But there was nothing to take it down level by level, which you would expect to see,\u201d said Saluzzi. \u201cIt makes no sense.\u201d The technical issues did not appear to impact the broader stock market, which moved mostly lower on economic growth concerns. Besides Berkshire, most of the halted stocks and exchanged traded funds (ETFs) were only trading slightly higher or lower.

{"id": "2024_06_03_politics_fauci-trump-rfk", "text": "The public lashing Dr. Anthony Fauci faced on Capitol Hill Monday was illustrative of his enduring unpopularity with the GOP\u2019s conservative base. Yet even as Republicans seek to capitalize on that dislike of the infectious disease expert, former President Donald Trump\u2019s past elevation of Fauci is a potential vulnerability as he fights off an insurgent independent campaign from Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Increasingly, Kennedy\u2019s third-party White House bid is gaining traction\u00a0by attacking Trump\u2019s Covid-19\u00a0policies. He has, for example, accused Trump of \u201cinventing lockdowns\u201d and has questioned the safety of the Covid vaccine his administration helped develop. Kennedy\u00a0has also jabbed Trump over his reliance on Fauci, the former director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases who served on the White House Coronavirus Task Force. He recently launched a line of merchandise tying Trump and Fauci together. \u201cVote for Trump/Fauci 2024,\u201d the new campaign shirts say, along with a tongue-in-cheek slogan: \u201cGive us another shot!\u201d Trump has attempted to downplay Fauci\u2019s role in his administration. In an interview last month with Tim Pool, a podcaster favored by the far right, Trump claimed Fauci \u201cwasn\u2019t a big player in my administration like he was after I left when Biden made him the king of everything.\u201d At Monday\u2019s House subcommittee hearing about the US response to the Covid-19 pandemic, Republicans didn\u2019t mention Trump in their grilling of Fauci \u2014 his first public testimony on the Hill since retiring. But Trump\u2019s party increasingly has made Fauci an avatar of the retribution they are seeking if the Republican returns to office. At the macro-level, his supporters have proposed ideas that would make it easier to fire federal workers, like Fauci. Trump has repeatedly suggested he couldn\u2019t fire Fauci during his term because of laws that protect career civil servants. At one point during Monday\u2019s hearing, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia asserted that Fauci \u201cbelongs in prison\u201d over his time leading the country\u2019s pandemic response, a sentiment that has been echoed by other members of Congress and online by other Trump supporters. After the subcommittee chairman, Rep. Brad Wenstrup of Ohio, thanked Fauci for his years of service Monday, Laura Loomer, a conservative provocateur who operates on the edges of Trump\u2019s political operation, posted on social media: \u201cDr. Fauci is a criminal and needs to be treated like one. Not be thanked by the REPUBLICAN CHAIR of the Select subcommittee on coronavirus.\u201d Kennedy has given quarter to these views. In a recent interview, when conservative commentator Glenn Beck asked him, \u201cWhy isn\u2019t (Fauci) in jail?\u201d Kennedy responded, \u201cHe\u2019s not in jail because Joe Biden is president.\u201d Kennedy isn\u2019t the first to use Fauci in an attempt to drive a wedge between Trump and his base. During the GOP primary, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis regularly invoked the longtime public health expert to attack Trump from the right, noting the former president gave Fauci a commendation on his last day in office. Trumped claimed he didn\u2019t know who gave Fauci the commendation, leading DeSantis to joke: \u201cIs this the immaculate commendation or something like that? Did this just happen out of thin air?\u201d But DeSantis\u2019 efforts ultimately failed to make a dent in Trump\u2019s support with the GOP base. While Kennedy faces an uphill climb to get on the ballot in every state, polling suggests he has nevertheless become a problem for Trump as he centers his campaign around vaccines and the coronavirus response. One recent poll from Monmouth University showed support for Kennedy among Republicans grew slightly\u00a0once they learned of his views on vaccines and Covid. It\u2019s just one datapoint, though it explains the urgency of Trump\u2019s recent attacks on Kennedy. David Robertson, a 50-year-old San Antonio\u00a0real estate developer, voted for Trump in 2020, but told CNN he switched to Kennedy after hearing the independent candidate talk about Covid on Joe Rogan\u2019s podcast. \u201cI just felt like we were misled, you know, and a lot of ways and a lot of stuff that we were told that wasn\u2019t true, we\u2019ve now found out that it is true,\u201d Robertson said. \u201cTowards the end with Covid, the way he handled it, with the lockdowns and everything else, I felt like he just kind of bowed down to what he was told to do.\u201d In the face of this rising threat, Trump has lately stepped up his attacks on Kennedy, labeling him an \u201cextreme liberal\u201d and \u201cfake anti-vaxxer\u201d in a video posted to social media last month.\u00a0Kennedy is a leading purveyor of anti-vaccine misinformation and has long espoused unfounded views of inoculations that doctors and medical authorities have easily debunked. \u201cRFK\u2019s views on vaccines are fake, as is everything else about his candidacy,\u201d the former president said in the video. Trump has long had a fraught relationship with the Covid vaccine, one of the most consequential achievements of his four years in office. As it became less popular among Republicans, Trump stopped mentioning the vaccine. Amid DeSantis\u2019 criticism and Kennedy\u2019s rise, he started telling crowds he would not give \u201cone penny\u201d to a school that requires students to get a Covid vaccine or wear a mask. In a recent interview with Time, Trump both touted the development of the Covid vaccine through Operation Warp Speed while also declining to say if he would push vaccines so aggressively if given the chance again. \u201cI\u2019ve been given a lot of credit for Operation Warp Speed. But most of that credit has come from Democrats,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd I think a big portion of Republicans agree with it, too. But a lot of them don\u2019t want to say it. They don\u2019t want to talk about it.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/03/politics/fauci-trump-rfk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/04/2024", "section": "us"}}

In January, the teacher \u2013 who is not named in the letter \u2013 held an \u201cimpromptu mock slave auction\u201d during a lesson on the Atlantic triangle slave trade, during which slave auctions were discussed, the letter said. \u201cThe educator asked two children sitting in front of the room, who were of color, to stand, and the educator and class discussed physical attributes (i.e., teeth and strength),\u201d Martineau said. The second incident took place in April, and in that instance, the same educator used the N-word while reading a book, which was not part of the fifth-grade curriculum, to students, the letter said. \u201cIt was later brought to the District\u2019s attention that the \u2018N-word\u2019 does not appear in the book,\u201d Martineau said. \u201cDehumanizing words such as slurs should not be spoken by employees or students. Using such words can harm students and negatively impact an open discussion on a particular topic.\u201d Martineau also condemned the teacher\u2019s actions in holding a mock slave auction, calling the action \u201cunacceptable\u201d and a violation of the district\u2019s core values. He also noted the damaging impact that such role-playing methods in lessons on historical atrocities or trauma can have on students of color. Parents of students in the class met with the teacher and the principal to discuss the two incidents in April, but the next day, Martineau said the teacher \u201cinappropriately called out the student who had reported the educator\u2019s use of the racial slur, which is not acceptable.\u201d That is when the district began a formal investigation, and the teacher was placed on paid administrative leave, the letter said. The school\u2019s principal was placed on a 10-day paid administrative leave in May. \u201cCurrently, the District is engaged in due process procedures with the educator who remains on leave. All personnel matters will remain confidential,\u201d Martineau said. Martineau went on to apologize for the events that took place at the school and said the district\u2019s \u201ccultural competency\u201d will improve. \u201cI acknowledge that there were missteps in this process that further complicated the situation. Ultimately, I am responsible for ensuring students are in safe and supportive learning environments,\u201d he said. CNN has reached out to the school and to the school district for further comment.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/01/us/massachusetts-teacher-slave-auction/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/04/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_01_us_louisiana-homeless-high-school-valedictorian-trnd", "text": "A Louisiana high school senior experiencing homelessness recently graduated at the top of his class with the highest-earned GPA. Elijah Hogan, 19, was named valedictorian of Walter L. Cohen High School in New Orleans and graduated May 24 with a 3.93 GPA, he told CNN. Hogan, who became homeless a year and a half ago, says he was in disbelief when he learned of his academic achievement. \u201cI thought they were mistaking me for someone else, but when I looked at it and I was shown evidence that it was me, I was in awe, like, I was jaw dropped,\u201d said Hogan, who was born in New Orleans and raised mostly in Houston. Hogan was one of four Black male students who achieved valedictorian status at their New Orleans schools this spring, CNN affiliate WDSU reported. Hogan, who previously lived with his grandmother since he was 11, says he became homeless after the lease on his grandmother\u2019s house expired when the homeowner decided to sell the property. He and his grandmother were given 30 days to vacate the house, according to Hogan. \u201cFrom there, I made the executive decision to live on my own to lighten my grandmother\u2019s burden,\u201d Hogan told CNN. While his grandmother went to live in a care home for the elderly, Hogan was left without permanent housing. His grandmother told him about the Covenant House, a homeless shelter in New Orleans serving youth and young adults ages 16-22. Hogan has been living at the shelter as part of its transitional housing program since he became homeless, he said. The program allows young people to stay at the shelter up to 24 months rent-free, giving them an opportunity to focus on education or to save money while working, Covenant House New Orleans chief executive officer Rheneisha Robertson told CNN. \u201cIt really allows them to get stable and identify more permanent, stable housing,\u201d said Robertson, who added the homeless shelter had five other high school graduates this year. Hogan, who addressed his graduating class with an uplifting valedictorian speech last week, said dealing with homelessness while completing his education was challenging but he found support from the homeless shelter\u2019s employees and his high school\u2019s staff. \u201cAs time went on, I started to open up to people over at Covenant House as well as Cohen, people were there to support me and give me a guiding hand,\u201d Hogan said. \u201cWithout them, I wouldn\u2019t (have) become who I am today.\u201d He credits his Covenant House case manager, Jarkayla Cobb, with never giving up on him. \u201cShe helped me get through it even when I was showing a lack of faith in myself,\u201d Hogan said. \u201cShe\u2019s been there no matter what I needed.\u201d Hogan, who lost his mother just before he turned 12, says her death encouraged him to push forward with his education for his grandmother\u2019s sake. \u201cI know that\u2019s what (my mother) would have wanted,\u201d he said. Hogan plans to attend Xavier University in New Orleans in the fall to study graphic design and has been granted a scholarship to cover his tuition fees, he says. \u201cElijah\u2019s accomplishments are worth celebrating. We know that they are a product of his character and the choices he made day after day to pursue his dreams,\u201d Jerel Bryant, chief executive officer of Collegiate Academies, which operates Hogan\u2019s former high school, said in a statement. \u201cHis success is also a testament to how capable and excellent our Black youth are, in New Orleans and across this country,\u201d Bryant said. Hogan offered these words of encouragement for other young people: \u201cTo any race, no matter what color or accent you have, you are your own guiding light,\u201d Hogan said. \u201cYou are your own storybook that you write.\u00a0Let yourself be the pen that you write on paper.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/01/us/louisiana-homeless-high-school-valedictorian-trnd/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/04/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_03_tech_tiktok-live-child-safety-utah-lawsuit", "text": "A new Utah lawsuit accuses TikTok of enabling the sexual exploitation of children through its livestreaming feature. TikTok live allows users to post live videos to the platform, where they can interact with viewers and respond to comments in real time. TikTok also allows viewers to send monetary \u201cgifts\u201d\u00a0\u2014\u00a0often represented by colorful emojis \u2014 to users conducting livestreams. TikTok does not allow users under the age of 18 to host livestreams. But the lawsuit, filed by Utah Attorney General Sean Reyes in state court in Utah, alleges that TikTok Live operates \u201clike a virtual strip club\u201d where children may be encouraged by adults to engage in \u201cillicit acts\u201d on camera in exchange for payments from other users. It also claims that TikTok has insufficient age verification and enforcement measures to ensure the app is being used safely. TikTok has known since before December 2023 that there are \u201cpervasive issues with transactional sexual content occurring during LIVE sessions, especially involving kids, through user complaints and internal safety reports,\u201d the complaint, filed Monday in Utah district court, states. TikTok spokesperson Michael Hughes said in a statement that the platform has \u201cindustry-leading policies and measures to help protect the safety and well-being of teens. Creators must be at least 18 years old before they can go LIVE, and their account must meet a follower requirement. We immediately revoke access to features if we find accounts that do not meet our age requirements.\u201d The Monday lawsuit is the second filed by Utah\u2019s attorney general against TikTok for allegedly putting children at risk. In a separate lawsuit last year, Utah accused the app of harming the mental health of young users, mirroring similar claims from Arkansas and New York City against TikTok and other social media platforms. TikTok has repeatedly pushed back on claims that it is harmful to children\u2019s wellbeing, saying it supports young users with various tools such as automatic time limits. It also comes as TikTok faces a potentially existential threat in the United States after President Joe Biden signed a law that requires the Chinese-owned app to be sold to a new company or be banned from US app stores. TikTok has sued to block the law, claiming it violates the First Amendment. The new Utah lawsuit, which is heavily redacted, claims TikTok has been aware of the misuse of its live feature but has failed to take adequate steps to address the issue. \u201cIn September 2022 \u2026 an investigator found that \u2018within minutes of browsing the [LIVE] feed\u2019 they were shown underage girls providing sexually suggestive content in exchange for money and young boys using filters to pose as girls to receive Gifts,\u201d the complaint states. The lawsuit also alleges that children may be manipulated into sending monetary gifts to other users on the live feature, with the promise of \u201clikes, shout outs, goods, or interactions\u201d from livestream hosts. Utah\u2019s attorney general is seeking a jury trial for the case.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/03/tech/tiktok-live-child-safety-utah-lawsuit/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/04/2024", "section": "us"}}

{"id": "2024_06_01_us_atlanta-ga-water-main-breaks", "text": "Atlanta\u2019s mayor has declared a state of emergency following a massive water main break that left parts of the city\u2019s downtown district without water and prompted a major hospital to transfer patients elsewhere. The\u00a0significant disruption\u00a0to water service in Georgia\u2019s capital is the latest dramatic example of how aging infrastructure throughout the United States has impacted electrical grids, bridges and roadways, dams and other vital systems, inconveniencing millions of Americans or placing them in danger. Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens on Saturday declared a state of emergency just a few hours after crews repaired one of two major water main breaks in the city\u2019s downtown area. The other, in the Midtown neighborhood, is still undergoing services with no estimate on when it will be repaired. Repair crews have made \u201csignificant progress in localizing the repairs\u201d as they continue to address the broken water main at the intersection of West Peachtree Street and 11th Street in Midtown, Atlanta\u2019s Department of Watershed Management said early Sunday. Video from CNN affiliate WANF showed water gushing from a pipe onto a blocked-off portion of West Peachtree Street as crews worked to address it. Atlanta Watershed reported another possible water main break in the city earlier Sunday and announced emergency repairs on a 6-inch water main near the Candler Park neighborhood were complete by late Sunday afternoon. Water service was restored to 35 nearby homes and four hydrants, the city agency said. The issues began Friday after breaks on a 48-inch and 36-inch transmission line \u201cthat carries large volumes of water to the metropolitan area,\u201d according to Atlanta Watershed. The water main breaks left parts of downtown Atlanta without water and under boil water advisories, shuttering tourist attractions and forcing events to be postponed. After repairs to the initial water main break downtown were completed, crews fully restored water service to Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, the Fulton County Jail, Atlanta City Detention Center and other facilities, the city agency said. On Sunday, the city distributed water at two city fire stations, limiting cases to one per resident amid ongoing water issues. \u201cWe are currently working on getting more water delivered to all stations,\u201d the City of Atlanta said in a post on X. Meanwhile, the city\u2019s Emory University Hospital Midtown and its ambulances resumed normal operations Sunday after the hospital experienced water pressure issues due to the water main breaks on Saturday, according to Janet Christenbury, director of media relations. The disruptions prompted the hospital on Saturday to transfer dialysis patients to other hospitals and divert ambulances from its emergency department, except for people with urgent heart concerns, a hospital spokesperson told CNN in a statement. \u201cTomorrow, we will operate on regular schedules for outpatient doctor\u2019s appointments, procedures and surgeries,\u201d Christenbury said in a statement. The hospital said it brought in around 58,000 gallons of water in six tanker trucks to use in chillers and cooling towers on Saturday and distributed bottled water to patients for drinking and personal care needs. \u201cWe will continue to provide bottled water to patients, visitors and staff while the hospital remains under a boil water advisory, like many of the affected areas in Atlanta,\u201d Christenbury said. Urgent surgeries were not affected on Saturday, the hospital said. Boil water advisory in still effect Dickens apologized on Saturday for the city\u2019s response to the water main break that began creating concerns Friday morning. \u201cI know it has been a tough and frustrating day for many of you,\u201d Dickens said. \u201cWe all take\u00a0this matter very seriously.\u201d The issues prompted the closure of tourist attractions and the rescheduling of events including Megan Thee Stallion concerts Friday and Saturday. The incident also left many without water or with inadequate water pressure. The Georgia Aquarium and the World of Coca-Cola, two of downtown\u2019s biggest attractions, remained closed Saturday. Atlanta United, the city\u2019s soccer team, said it planned to play its match against Charlotte FC on Sunday at Mercedes-Benz Stadium, but there would be \u201climited food and beverage options\u201d due to the city\u2019s boil water advisory, which remained in effect. \u201cWe ask all fans to utilize hand sanitizing stations around the stadium as an added precaution for health and safety,\u201d the team said in a statement on X. Officials say a decaying pipe that collapsed due to water pressure was the main cause of the break downtown. \u201cWe were actually able to repair the fitting that was leaking,\u201d said Al Wiggins Jr., Commissioner for the Department of Public Works, during a news conference on Saturday. \u201cWe spent a significant amount of time removing pressure from the system in order for us to be able to conduct the necessary repairs,\u201d he said. Crews are slowly pressurizing water flow to ensure no additional damage is done to the water network. Atlanta\u2019s Grady Memorial Hospital, which reported low water pressure on Saturday, is expected to return to normal operations Monday after water service was restored and water pressure has \u201csignificantly increased,\u201d Grady\u2019s administration announced Sunday. The hospital, which said it remained fully operational on Saturday, said it would also continue providing patients and staff with bottled water Sunday amid the ongoing boil water advisory. Water issues have impacted Atlanta before. In June 2020, a water main break on the Georgia Institute of Technology\u2019s campus led to outages and a boil water advisory in the city. Emory University Hospital Midtown used bottled water then. Patient care was not affected. Atlanta\u2019s woes are part of a larger issue of aging infrastructure throughout the US. Here and in Canada, around 260,000 water main breaks cost $2.6 billion each year, according to a December 2023 study from Utah State University. The study noted the average age of failing water mains is around 53 years and that 33% of US and Canadian water mains are over 50 years old.

{"id": "2024_06_03_politics_president-biden-hunter-gun-trial", "text": "In the days and weeks leading up Hunter Biden\u2019s trial on felony gun charges, President Joe Biden made little attempt to distance himself from his son. Instead, Hunter Biden was seen at the White House and in Delaware at his father\u2019s side amid what the president\u2019s allies acknowledge is a difficult moment for both men. They attended a White House state dinner for Kenya last month; marked the ninth anniversary of the death of Beau Biden, the president\u2019s eldest son, at church last week; and cycled together along a trail in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, on Saturday. The president also planned to spend most of Monday in Wilmington, where jury selection for the trial \u2013 the first of a sitting US president\u2019s child \u2013 is underway. He traveled there\u00a0Sunday evening, arriving earlier than originally planned. As proceedings were getting underway, first lady Jill Biden \u2014 who, like her husband, has remained supportive and protective of Hunter amid his addiction and legal problems \u2014 was seen arriving at the courthouse. \u201cI am the President, but I am also a Dad. Jill and I love our son, and we are so proud of the man he is today,\u201d the president said in a statement Monday. \u201cHunter\u2019s resilience in the face of adversity and the strength he has brought to his recovery are inspiring to us. A lot of families have loved ones who have overcome addiction and know what we mean,\u201d he went on. \u201cAs the President, I don\u2019t and won\u2019t comment on pending federal cases, but as a Dad, I have boundless love for my son, confidence in him, and respect for his strength. Our family has been through a lot together, and Jill and I are going to continue to be there for Hunter and our family with our love and support.\u201d Hunter Biden, 54, is accused of illegally purchasing and possessing a gun while abusing or being addicted to drugs, a violation of federal law. He pleaded not guilty to the three charges, though he has been open about\u00a0his struggles\u00a0with alcohol and crack cocaine addiction. For the president, the legal problems facing his son have been reason to pull him close, rather than push him away. Joe Biden has paid little mind to some of his allies who question the approach. Instead, his concern for his son\u2019s well-being surpasses any potential political fallout, advisers have said. That concern has appeared at moments to be all-consuming, including in the darkest moments of Hunter Biden\u2019s addiction, when the president and his family desperately sought to head off a self-destructive cycle. Joe Biden still speaks with or texts with his son almost daily, particularly as his legal issues mounted. The president told an interviewer last year his son had done \u201cnothing wrong,\u201d and that the only way Hunter Biden\u2019s legal issues were affecting his presidency was in creating a surge of fatherly pride. \u201cIt impacts my presidency by making me feel proud of him,\u201d he said on MSNBC. As the gun trial gets underway, Biden will be heading overseas to mark the 80th anniversary of D-Day. There is little question he will remain in regular touch with his son while abroad and will keep abreast of the trial amid a heavy schedule of commemorations, speeches and a state visit in Paris with French President Emmanuel Macron. But neither he nor the White House is expected to speak proactively about the trial. Hunter Biden\u2019s legal team generally operates separately from the president and his campaign, and there are few who believe there would be much benefit in the president weighing in publicly. Prosecutors have said they plan to call about a dozen witnesses for their case. Most notably, they\u2019ve\u00a0lined up testimony\u00a0from three of Hunter Biden\u2019s former romantic partners to testify about his drug use around the time he bought the gun. This includes his ex-wife,\u00a0Kathleen Buhle, and his late brother\u2019s widow,\u00a0Hallie Biden, whom Hunter Biden later dated. Their testimony could bring to life a period that Hunter Biden has described as his rock bottom, during which he was almost always on drugs or trying to get drugs. At his attempted plea hearing last year, Hunter Biden testified that he has been sober since May 2019. There was a time last summer when the president and his orbit believed Hunter Biden\u2019s legal ordeal would end with a plea deal and that the family would be able to close a dark chapter. Those hopes were dashed when the agreement fell apart and, weeks later, a special counsel was appointed to oversee the investigation into the president\u2019s son, opening the prospect of prolonged legal battles overlapping with Joe Biden\u2019s run for reelection. But many in Biden\u2019s orbit suggest his son\u2019s legal issues will not be a driving concern for voters heading into November\u2019s election. Still, few issues are more sensitive inside the Biden White House than the president\u2019s son, from his addiction battles to his legal woes. That has largely left Hunter Biden and his team to go on their own offense, accusing Republicans and others of trying to use his addiction issues for political profit. \u201cThey are trying to, in their most illegitimate way, but rational way, they\u2019re trying to destroy a presidency,\u201d\u00a0Hunter\u00a0Biden said in a podcast released late last year. \u201cAnd so, it\u2019s not about me, and \u2026 what they\u2019re trying to do is they\u2019re trying to kill me, knowing that it will be a pain greater than my father could be able to handle and so therefore destroying a presidency in that way.\u201d CORRECTION: A previous version of this story misidentified a potential prosecution witness.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/03/politics/president-biden-hunter-gun-trial/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/04/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_01_us_chad-daybell-murder-sentencing-death-penalty", "text": "Chad Daybell was sentenced to death Saturday upon the recommendation of the jury that convicted him of first-degree murder and conspiracy charges in the killings of his first wife and two children of his second wife. Daybell was convicted Thursday of first-degree murder and conspiracy charges in the deaths of his first wife, Tammy Daybell, and two of his second wife\u2019s children \u2013 16-year-old Tylee Ryan and 7-year-old Joshua \u201cJJ\u201d Vallow \u2013 in a case prosecutors claim was fueled by power, sex, money and apocalyptic spiritual beliefs. Judge Steven Boyce on Saturday formally imposed the death sentence after a jury, in a lengthy verdict form read in court earlier, said it found that penalty was appropriate under the law. The judge also imposed a 15-year prison sentence for insurance fraud charges. Daybell had a blank expression as Boyce sentenced him to death. The judge said jurors had \u201cfound beyond a reasonable doubt \u2026 that the aggravating circumstances when weighed against the mitigating circumstances do not make the imposition of the death penalty unjust.\u201d The sequestered jury began deliberating his fate Friday afternoon and mulled the case for six hours before ending for the night. Jurors continued deliberations Saturday about 8:30 a.m. MT, and at 10:45 a.m. the Ada County courts announced the verdict had been reached. Jurors heard contrasting portraits of the man from lawyers before beginning deliberations in a case that drew national attention in part because of what prosecutors described as the couple\u2019s \u201cdoomsday\u201d religious beliefs. The sensational triple murder was featured in a Netflix true-crime documentary in 2022. In his opening statement to the jury on Friday, prosecutor Rob Wood asked them to consider aggravating factors that would make Daybell eligible for the death penalty. First, the three murders, he said, were committed for remuneration. Daybell was also convicted of insurance fraud stemming from life insurance policies that allegedly paid him money after his first wife\u2019s death. His second wife, as well as Daybell, also were convicted of grand theft because she continued to draw Social Security benefits for her children after their deaths. Additionally, Wood told the jury, the murders of the three victims were \u201cespecially heinous, atrocious or cruel, manifesting exceptional depravity.\u201d \u201cThis defendant exhibited utter disregard for human life,\u201d Wood added. \u201cThe defendant, by his conduct, whether such conduct was before, during or after the commission of the murders at hand, has exhibited a propensity to commit murder, which will probably constitute a continuing threat to society.\u201d The prosecutor concluded, \u201cIt is your decision whether one or more of these aggravators has been proven. And if it has been, you must decide if, under these circumstances, imposition of the death penalty would be just or unjust.\u201d The verdict came about a year after Daybell\u2019s second wife, Lori Vallow Daybell, was also\u00a0convicted\u00a0of the murder of her children and sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. She was also convicted of conspiring to kill Tammy Daybell. Vallow Daybell has\u00a0appealed her convictions\u00a0to the state Supreme Court, with her legal team raising the issue of whether she was mentally competent to stand trial. Authorities have said they\u00a0believe Tylee and JJ were killed in September 2019\u00a0\u2013 the month they were last reported to have been seen \u2013 and that Tammy Daybell was\u00a0found dead\u00a0in her Idaho home on October 19, 2019, a\u00a0few weeks before Chad Daybell married Vallow Daybell. \u201cThis case has been about speaking for and seeking justice for the lives of three wonderful humans whose lives were cut way too short by the selfish desires of the defendant and his co-defendant Lori Vallow,\u201d Fremont County Prosecutor Lindsey Blake said in a release after the sentencing. The case was challenging, Blake said, both because of the complexities of the investigation and because of her own experience as a new mother during the prosecution. \u201cI can\u2019t begin to imagine the families\u2019 pain,\u201d she said. Wood said in a release after the sentencing that \u201cwhile nothing can undo the immense harm caused, we have worked tirelessly to secure a measure of justice.\u201d Addressing the jury Friday, defense lawyer John Prior portrayed Daybell as a once \u201cquiet, reserved, shy young man\u201d who grew up in Springville, Utah, a small, tight knit \u201ctown of faith.\u201d Daybell, his lawyer said, met his first wife, Tammy, and they were married for 29 years, raising five \u201cwonderful\u201d children \u201cvery deep in their faith, very deep in their commitment to family.\u201d But Daybell\u2019s life changed in late 2018, Prior said, when he met Vallow Daybell, who had already been married multiple times. \u201cEverything that glitters is not gold,\u201d he told jurors. \u201cLori Vallow glittered. She was not gold. She was the trajectory that changed the plan\u2026 Chaos hits and all of these things start cascading and this thing becomes very complicated and difficult.\u201d Prior said the new relationship with Vallow was like \u201cthis bomb dropped\u201d on the life of \u201cthe small town boy from Springville.\u201d \u201cWe have to look back at that,\u201d he said. \u201cYou examine what Chad Daybell\u2019s past was prior to the bomb being dropped, the Lori Vallow bomb being dropped\u2026 If it wasn\u2019t for that trajectory coming in and changing the path, is this where we would be going? It\u2019s not where we\u2019d be going.\u201d \u2018There\u2019s a hole in my heart\u2019 Jurors also heard from relatives of the victims on Friday. \u201cIt makes me angry and it destroys me to know Tammy was treated how she was,\u201d Tammy Daybell\u2019s father, Ron Douglas, told jurors. \u201cI find it comforting to know that Tammy is resting peacefully in Utah, buried alone and near her beloved mother.\u201d Kay Woodcock spoke about her grandson JJ and her step niece Tylee. \u201cI sit here today and try and explain the immense pain that me and everyone in my family continues to endure daily,\u201d she said. \u201cBut how do I do that?\u201d \u201cI can tell you there have been too many situations in the past few years where we were slammed with the fact that JJ won\u2019t hit another milestone,\u201d she said of her grandson. \u201cThe constant question remains: Who would he have become? What kind of man would he have been?\u201d Woodcock remembered Tylee as \u201cthe most precious, blond-haired, blue-eyed little girl\u201d and an \u201cabsolute mama\u2019s girl.\u201d Woodcock added, breaking into tears: \u201cThere\u2019s a hole in my heart, in the hearts of every member of my family, that can never be filled and will remain for the rest of my life.\u201d Tylee\u2019s aunt, Annie Cushing, remembered her walking around the house singing with \u201cthe voice of an angel.\u201d \u201cTylee had her whole life ahead of her. She had dignity, she had dreams, she had goals. This defendant stole all of that,\u201d Cushing said. Kelsee Douglas, Tammy\u2019s sister-in-law, told jurors that \u201cpain, fractured relationships and unhealed wounds are all part of the aftermath\u201d of the murders. \u201cThis is the legacy of anguish and sorrow that will haunt our family for generations,\u201d she added. Tammy\u2019s brother, Michael Douglas, lamented that \u201cthe nightmare fodder I have been provided will last me a lifetime.\u201d Daybell declined to address the court after the victim impact statements. Law enforcement found the remains of Tylee and JJ on Chad Daybell\u2019s Fremont County property\u00a0in June 2020, authorities said. \u201cIt\u2019s a sad day. JJ would have been 12 years old,\u201d JJ\u2019s grandfather, Larry Woodcock, said after the verdict Thursday. Woodcock remembered the victims, and asked the same question, over and over. \u201cWhat did they accomplish? Nothing. What did they do? They destroyed families,\u201d Woodcock said of Daybell and Lori Vallow Daybell. But the defendants, Larry Woodcock said, could not destroy the memories relatives have of the victims. \u201cThey can\u2019t take that,\u201d he added, growing emotional at one point. When he heard the jury verdict in court, he said, he felt like he couldn\u2019t breathe. \u2018Sex, money and power\u2019 were key focuses in the trial During opening statements, the prosecutor and defense attorney painted contrasting portraits of the defendant. The state described him as a power-hungry and grandiose man who would stop at nothing for \u201cwhat he considered his rightful destiny.\u201d His defense lawyer portrayed Daybell as a religious man driven into an unfortunate relationship by a \u201cbeautiful, vivacious woman\u201d who knew \u201chow to get what she wants.\u201d \u201cTwo dead children buried in the defendant Chad Daybell\u2019s backyard,\u201d Wood said in his first words to the jury at the start of trial. \u201cThe next month his wife is found dead in their marital bed. Seventeen days after the death of his wife, Tammy Daybell, this defendant is\u00a0photographed laughing and dancing on a beach in Hawaii at his wedding to Lori Vallow, a woman who was his mistress and the mother of the children buried\u00a0in the graves on his property. Three dead bodies.\u201d When Daybell \u201chad a chance at what he considered his rightful destiny,\u201d Wood said, he \u201cmade sure that no person and no law would stand in his way.\u201d \u201cHis desire for sex, money and power led him to pursue those ambitions,\u201d the prosecutor added. \u201cAnd this pursuit\u00a0led to the deaths of his wife and Lori\u2019s two innocent children.\u201d Tammy Daybell was initially believed to have died in her sleep, and Chad Daybell remarried less than three weeks after her death in 2019. Prior said Daybell\u2019s life began to change after he met Vallow Daybell, a \u201cbeautifully stunning woman\u201d who \u201cstarts giving him a lot of attention\u201d and eventually lured him into an \u201cinappropriate\u201d and \u201cunfortunate\u201d extramarital relationship. Vallow Daybell\u2019s two children from a previous marriage were last seen on different days in September 2019. Tylee Ryan was a \u201cnormal, vibrant teenage girl\u201d who loved her friends and her little brother, JJ, was on the autism spectrum and required special care, according to Wood. In late November 2019, relatives asked police in Rexburg, Idaho,\u00a0to do a welfare check on JJ because they hadn\u2019t talked to him recently. Police didn\u2019t find him at the family\u2019s house but did see Vallow Daybell and Daybell, who said JJ was staying with a family friend in Arizona, according to authorities. When police returned with a search warrant the next day, the couple was gone. They were ultimately found in Hawaii in January 2020. In June 2020, law enforcement officials found the remains of Tylee and JJ on Daybell\u2019s property in Fremont County, Idaho. Vallow Daybell and Daybell were indicted on murder charges in May 2021. Tylee was believed to have been killed between September 8 and 9, 2019, and JJ between September 22 and 23, according to prosecutors. \u201cWe are filled with unfathomable sadness that these two bright stars were stolen from us, and only hope that they died without pain or suffering,\u201d the families of the children said in a statement after the remains were found.

On Monday morning, authorities recovered the body of Reis Melvin Grams, 40, of Lino Lakes, Minnesota, west of the Curtain Falls in the Boundary Waters Canoe Area, according to a Facebook post from the St. Louis County Sheriff\u2019s Office. The body of the other missing canoeist, Jesse Haugen, 41, of Cambridge, Minnesota, was found Friday by crews near Curtain Falls, according to a news release from the St. Louis County Sheriff\u2019s Office obtained by CNN affiliate KBJR. The St. Louis County Sheriff\u2019s Office was first dispatched to Iron Lake near the border of Canada at 7:21 p.m. on May 18, according to a news release. Two canoes had gone over Curtain Falls in the Boundary Waters Canoe Area, the sheriff\u2019s office said. One canoeist was badly injured and two were missing. Shortly after midnight, a helicopter was used to rescue one injured person and one uninjured person, according to the sheriff\u2019s office. The injured person was flown to a hospital with \u201cserious but not life-threatening injuries,\u201d the sheriff\u2019s office said. \u201cFriends, two families and a wide circle of friends are devastated tonight by the events at Curtain Falls,\u201d the St. Louis County Rescue Squad said in a Facebook post Sunday evening. Search efforts were hampered by \u201cmany challenges and setbacks,\u201d including \u201csketchy and unreliable\u201d cell phone and radio communication, according to the Facebook post. Rescuers worked all evening \u201cuntil it was too dark to see, and are sleeping on the ground tonight\u201d to continue searching first thing in the morning, the post said. The search effort included remotely-operated vehicles and drones, according to the sheriff\u2019s office. \u201cCurtain Falls is extremely difficult to access, and we are depending heavily on our aviation partners to transport equipment, supplies, and personnel in and out of the backcountry,\u201d added the rescue group.

{"id": "2024_06_02_us_virginia-colleges-remove-dei-course-requirement-reaj", "text": "When the police killings of Black people, including George Floyd set off racial unrest across the country in 2020, Marie Vergamini decided she wanted to do her part to help address systemic racism. So, Vergamini, a doctoral student and adjunct instructor at Virginia Commonwealth University, joined a committee of faculty and students who were creating a racial literacy curriculum. Vergamini said they created lessons that covered the history of slavery in the United States, the Jim Crow era, racism against Asian Americans, and the nationwide movement to remove Confederate statues, including those in\u00a0the state\u2019s capital, Richmond, which was once the seat of the Confederacy. The curriculum, she said, was designed to benefit students of all races. \u201cAs a White woman, I have a lot of privileges and instead of being complicit in these systems I want to change these systems,\u201d Vergamini said. \u201cMy privileges should be basic human rights for everybody.\u201d The committee\u00a0planned to make the racial literacy curriculum part of general education requirements for incoming students. Students would need to take one three-credit course out of a list of approved classes, faculty members told CNN. But in May, months before the course mandate was set to be rolled out this fall, VCU\u2019s Board of Visitors voted to drop the requirement. The Board, which is made up of 16 members appointed by the governor of Virginia, voted 10 \u2013 5 against making the curriculum mandatory, according to a statement from the University. The university said the board was committed to \u201cupholding academic freedom while empowering students with flexibility and autonomy in their educational journey.\u201d \u201cThis is not about the content of our courses, only the graduation mandate,\u201d VCU Board Rector Todd Haymore said in the statement. The decision came as another Virginia college, George Mason University, announced it would postpone a \u201cJust Societies\u201d diversity-themed course requirement for incoming students that was initially set to take effect in the fall. In a letter addressed to his colleagues, Kenneth D.\u00a0Walsh, George Mason\u2019s interim executive vice president and provost, said the school would delay implementation of the courses to the 2025-26 academic year. \u201cThis is clearly an issue that engenders strong feelings on every side,\u201d Walsh said. \u201cIronically, finding a civil and respectful path forward on this kind of issue is precisely the type of activity the \u2018Just Societies\u2019 courses are meant to support students accomplishing.\u201d The courses will still be optional for students at both universities in the upcoming school year. But the decisions to drop the course requirements at VCU and postpone them at George Mason have faced backlash from faculty and students who say the material is meant to prepare students for the real world by offering a better understanding of the nation\u2019s history of racism and discrimination. Removing the requirement, Vergamini told CNN, means many students will likely not gain that knowledge. \u201cIt\u2019s just not going to have the impact that we need it to have,\u201d she said. Diversity, equity and inclusion programs and curriculum at colleges in Virginia and across the country have faced increased scrutiny from lawmakers in recent years.\u00a0Since 2023, 14 anti-DEI bills that target programs at colleges have been signed into law, according to a tally by the\u00a0Chronicle of Higher Education. Earlier this year, Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin\u2019s administration requested that both VCU and George Mason University provide the syllabi for their diversity-themed courses to \u201cprovide greater clarity around what would be mandated because they were not available online,\u201d Christian Martinez, a spokesperson for Youngkin, told CNN in an email. Martinez said the governor\u2019s office had heard \u201cconcerns from members of the Boards of Visitors, parents, students, alumni, and community members about proposed mandatory courses for undergraduate students.\u201d Youngkin has been a fierce critic of DEI. In 2022, the governor\u00a0banned teaching\u00a0\u201cinherently divisive concepts, including critical race theory\u201d\u00a0in K-12 schools. He later defended\u00a0Martin Brown, his administration\u2019s chief diversity, opportunity and inclusion officer, who faced calls for his resignation for declaring \u201cDEI is dead,\u201d according to\u00a0CNN affiliate WTVR. Universities become a culture war battleground Mignonne Guy,\u00a0an associate professor\u00a0in the Department of African American Studies at VCU, said\u00a0the university\u2019s president first tasked her with creating curriculum to teach students about racial literacy in 2019.  Guy said she established the Committee on Racial Equity faculty group and the Committee on Racial Equity Student Advisory Group to develop criteria for courses that would satisfy a requirement for all undergraduate students at VCU. The criteria, according to the university website, included teaching about \u201cthe historical and current structures of racialized power and privilege, including whiteness,\u201d and the \u201csocial institutions, policies, and practices that contribute to and enable racism.\u201d Guy said having this knowledge is key to addressing systemic racism, or the policies and practices that result in unfair treatment of some people based on their race. Blocking the racial literacy course requirement sends a message to students that \u201cthis is not a priority,\u201d Guy said. \u201cThis was not to change students\u2019 minds, it was to give them the opportunity to have a lens and interrogate our country in ways that we have not adequately done in the past,\u201d Guy said. \u201cAnd not just interrogate it but come up with solutions for a different way of life.\u201d Anesia Lawson, a VCU student and president of university\u2019s NAACP chapter, said she was hopeful the board would support the requirement given all the hard work from the committee. Lawson said she and other students attended the board meeting where the vote took place and were disappointed by the result. \u201cIt was truly heartbreaking,\u201d she said. Lawson said she reviewed the racial literacy curriculum as it was being developed and appreciated that it would teach students how systemic racism intersected with sociology, the sciences, leadership, and\u00a0law, which would benefit her as an aspiring civil rights lawyer. \u201cWe really see things through different lenses and not educating people on race and racism is a disadvantage to our society and moving forward,\u201d she said. Melissa Broeckelman-Post, a professor and the Basic Course Director in the Department of Communication at George Mason, said the \u201cJust Societies\u201d courses were meant to \u201cprepare our students for the contemporary world, and employers and accreditors clearly articulate the need to require these learning outcomes.\u201d \u201cFaculty are deeply concerned that some [board]\ufeff members are trying to interfere with curriculum processes that are clearly in the purview of the faculty,\u201d she said in an email. But where proponents of diversity equity and inclusion see courses like those offered at VCU and George Mason as essential to understanding racial dynamics in the United States, many\u00a0lawmakers and critics who oppose DEI claim the classes amount to \u201cindoctrination.\u201d Former U.S. Amb. Robert Pence, who was appointed to the GMU Board of Visitors by Gov. Youngkin, echoed these claims during a May 2 board meeting,\u00a0adding he understands why students are passionate about diversity, but he takes issue with the courses\u00a0being mandated. \u201cWhat are you afraid of? That people won\u2019t take this course if you don\u2019t force feed \u2019em? That\u2019s what you\u2019re afraid of.\u201d In his letter, Walsh emphasized that the courses in the \u201cJust Societies\u201d curriculum will be offered this coming year, and that the delay will only impact the school\u2019s decision on whether they\u2019re required. \u201cWe have to consider that the concerns being raised by these constituencies suggest that our case to establish this requirement is not as clear and compelling to such communities as they are to our students and faculty,\u201d Walsh wrote. \u201cThe depths of disagreement on this topic call for more work to bring opposing interests more into agreement.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/02/us/virginia-colleges-remove-dei-course-requirement-reaj/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/04/2024", "section": "us"}}

{"id": "2024_06_03_tech_russia-paris-olympics-influence-ops", "text": "Pro-Russian propagandists are ramping up their efforts to denigrate next month\u2019s Paris Summer Olympics and undermine Western support for Ukraine through a series of brazen online and offline stunts, private experts and Western officials told CNN. The stunts have included using artificial intelligence to impersonate the actor Tom Cruise\u2019s voice narrating a fake documentary attacking the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and placing coffins with an inscription invoking the Ukraine war near the Eiffel Tower, sources said. The activity appears to be part of an increasingly frantic effort from Russian operatives to tarnish the Olympics and stall any momentum Ukraine is building to use Western-made weapons to attack Russian territory, experts who track Russian disinformation told CNN. The IOC has placed restrictions on Russian athletes\u2019 participation in the Paris Olympics because of Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine. There is a mix of desperation and opportunism to the recent spate of propaganda, said Gavin Wilde, a former Russia expert at the National Security Council. \u201cFor the tech-savvy propagandists working in Russia, the alternative they\u2019re hedging against isn\u2019t irrelevance \u2014 it\u2019s a one-way trip to the front lines,\u201d Wilde told CNN. Campaign to undermine the West The Russian operatives used the fake Cruise voice, the Netflix logo and even a fake New York Times review to try to lend the documentary legitimacy, according to analysts at Microsoft, who released a\u00a0report\u00a0on the activity on Sunday. The propaganda video, released on social media platform Telegram last year, was \u201cthe first glimpse of what would prove to be an extensive campaign\u201d by the same Russian propaganda actor to smear the Paris Olympics, Microsoft said. Russian propagandists have also been ginning up fake news stories claiming that Parisians are buying property insurance because of fears of terrorism around the Olympics, and fake press releases purporting to come from the CIA and French intelligence warning about terrorism, according to Microsoft. CNN has requested comment from the Russian Embassy in Washington, DC. Not all the recent subterfuge has been online. On Saturday, French police discovered five coffins draped in the French flag, with the words \u201cFrench soldiers in Ukraine,\u201d near the Eiffel Tower. A French military official told CNN they suspect that Russia was involved in the stunt. French police are questioning three men in connection with the incident. French President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s refusal to rule out the possibility of sending French troops to Ukraine has\u00a0infuriated\u00a0the Russian government. In recent days, pro-Russia social media accounts have also shared a doctored video of US State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller commenting on Ukraine\u2019s potential use of US-made weapons in Russia. The video appears to be compiled from two different press appearances by Miller, showing him wearing different ties. It\u2019s unclear who made the video. US officials and private experts have not publicly identified the source of the video. \u201cWhile this video is obviously fake, it is a step towards what counter-disinformation researchers have been warning about \u2013 the use of AI manipulated media to enhance foreign disinformation operations,\u201d the State Department said in a statement to CNN. The Russian Embassy in South Africa shared a version of the video on its X accounts,\u00a0according\u00a0to screenshots captured by a BBC journalist. Hany Farid, a digital forensic expert and professor at UC Berkley, said the video had hallmarks of being manipulate using AI. Farid ran the video through multiple deepfake detection systems and said they indicated that the voices in the video had been created using AI and that the lip movements of the State Department spokesperson in the video had been altered using lip-sync AI software. \u201cEven if the fake is not believed by everyone, the constant bombardment of deepfakes is leading to an overall skepticism of everything we see online,\u201d Farid said. But Lee Foster, another information operations expert, expressed skepticism that the imagery in the video was made using AI. \u201cLooking at it from an analytic standpoint, it doesn\u2019t make sense to use AI to manipulate mouth movements such that they are basically identical to the original,\u201d Foster told CNN. \u201cAI manipulation of the video\u2019s audio remains an unresolved question, however.\u201d Ghosts of Olympics past Russian antagonism toward the IOC has been years in the making. The IOC has prohibited Russian athletes from competing officially under the Russian flag in Paris because of the Kremlin\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Russian athletes have faced similar restrictions at past Olympic games because of Russia\u2019s alleged doping program. Russia\u2019s GRU military intelligence agency was behind a destructive cyberattack on computers used at the opening ceremony of the Winter Olympics in South Korea in 2018,\u00a0according\u00a0to the US Justice Department. Officials at the Paris Olympics are bracing for a similar threat next month. \u201cThe GRU has reserved some its most serious cyberattacks for France and the Olympics, and they carried those out when the geopolitical situation was considerably less strained,\u201d said John Hultquist, chief analyst at the Google-owned cybersecurity firm Mandiant. The Olympic Games in Paris \u201cwill be an incredibly enticing target for these actors,\u201d Hultquist added. \u201cAny attack they cook up will be designed to undermine French prestige and the solidarity at the heart of the event.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/03/tech/russia-paris-olympics-influence-ops/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/04/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_02_us_world-war-two-remains-dna-research-identify", "text": "Minutes before plunging to their deaths, five airmen successfully dropped 14 paratroopers from the 82nd Airborne near their landing mark over Normandy, France from their C-47. It was just after 2:44 a.m. on June 6, 1944. The airmen completed their mission but lost their lives. The remains of the pilot and crew chief were recovered days later but the co-pilot, navigator and radio operator were never found \u2013 possibly until now. Eighty years after the Normandy Invasion known as D-Day, the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency, operating under the Department of Defense, is looking for the three missing airmen with the hope of finally bringing them home. They have found what is believed to be the crash site of the downed C-47, along with the possible remains of the co-pilot, 2nd Lieutenant William Donohue; the radio operator, Staff Sergeant David Madson and the navigator, 2nd Lieutenant Albert Brooks. The remaining three airmen from the 304th Troop Carrier Squadron, 442nd Troop Carrier Group, 50th Troop Carrier Wing were never accounted for but never forgotten. Crew flies mission over France D-Day was the pivotal moment of the war in Europe to tip the balance in favor of the Allied Forces. Commonly referred to as \u201cthe beginning of the end\u201d of World War II, Dr. Eric Klinek, a historian with the agency, said it was the first major attack to move American forces into German-held territory following years of pressure from President Franklin D. Roosevelt to do so. The 101st and 82nd Airborne Divisions led the airborne assault in the earliest stages of Operation Overlord, which included more than 160,000 Allied troops landing along the beaches of Normandy to fight Nazi Germany. Paratroopers were instrumental in getting behind enemy lines to cut off German supply routes and expand Allied capability to take over terrestrial targets. If they survived their jump, they would fight on the ground as infantrymen for as long as it took to complete the mission. Their mode of transportation was the C-47, a military version of the civilian DC-3 airplane. Taking off from England at 11 p.m. on June 5 and crossing the English Channel, the 101st and 82nd Airborne Divisions were to be dropped behind Utah Beach a few hours before the naval invasion, Dr. Klinek said. On the morning of D-Day, there were 821 C-47s carrying more than 13,000 soldiers from the 101st and 82nd Airborne Divisions. Eighteen of them were shot down. Due to poor weather, communication interference and unexpected enemy fire, many of the troop drops were scattered. \u201cSome landed in their drop zones and others landed miles away. If a plane got hit, the best option was for the paratroopers to jump wherever they could,\u201d Dr. Klinek said. Faced with German anti-aircraft fire from an altitude of less than 1,200 feet, Donohue, Madson and Brooks, along with their fellow airmen: the crew chief, Major McKinley McCanless; and the pilot, 1st Lieutenant Samuel Williams Jr., did not have enough time to bail out or maneuver a successful crash landing after dropping their paratroopers. French eyewitnesses say their C-47 \u201cstruck the ground and burst into flames,\u201d killing all five men, according to agency records. A crash site rediscovered In 2016, the agency received a tip the crash site had been rediscovered on farmland in Normandy. They sent a team in 2019 to evaluate the site and what they found was \u201cpart of an air speed indicator and part of a C-47 load adjuster,\u201d Dr. Klinek said, who was part of the initial evaluation on the ground. \u201cWe knew based on all the evidence from the French researchers to all the documents we had that this was the plane,\u201d he said. Dr. Klinek said the agency only pursues crash sites where missing soldiers could be found, so they launched an excavation site on April 12 with the goal of retrieving every possible piece of wreckage or evidence of human remains. At the excavation site, a team of 25 people conducted labor-intensive work every day for six weeks straight. Using an excavator and shovels to create dozens of grids, they swept the area for high concentrations of metal, then pressure washed and sifted every square inch of soil capable of containing even the smallest piece of evidence. \u201cWe actually hit the ground running with findings,\u201d Capt. Brian Foxworth, the search team leader, said. From potential life support items such as \u201cparachute buckles, fragments of headsets, and standard issue flashlights that every service member would be issued and carry on their person,\u201d Foxworth explained, to \u201cpossible osseous material.\u201d Osseous material includes anything related to human remains, Foxworth explained. \u201cWhether it\u2019s bone fragment to teeth, anything that you could potentially link to a person that could provide a DNA sample or provide what\u2019s needed to match up dental records, all of those things, that\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to pull back with us to the lab.\u201d Foxworth and the agency emphasize the word \u201cpossible\u201d with everything they find to maintain extreme precision and a cautious respect for families who have waited for decades to learn about the whereabouts of their loved ones\u2019 remains. Even when excavators are certain about specific items, everything must be sent to an agency lab for proper forensic testing before anything can be verified or concluded. \u201cEverything is possible,\u201d Master Sergeant Raul Castillo, the team\u2019s life support investigator, said. Holding a shining key-shaped metal object on a cloth next to five small items caked with dirt, Castillo said, \u201cWe found this on the surface and it\u2019s in a pretty good state, it\u2019s part of a headset \u2026 it\u2019s all possible from aircrew members \u2026 we won\u2019t know until we get back.\u201d Castillo\u2019s role is to identify each object being pulled from the ground, some of which may have been life support equipment assigned to the flight crew or paratroopers on the C-47. He was able to confirm each item uncovered so far had been from the 1940s. Searching wreckage for a link The excavation team wrapped up their work at the dig site at the end of May. All uncovered items are being transferred to an agency laboratory at Offutt Air Force Base in Nebraska, where they will be cataloged and tested by a team of forensic scientists led by Carrie Brown, lab manager and forensic anthropologist. \u201cA lot of times with these recoveries from Europe \u2026 especially if they have been in the ground for 80 years, you\u2019re getting fragments of bone,\u201d Brown said. She said bones found in Europe are generally well-preserved. \u201cNon-biological items such as watches, boots, ID tags, jewelry, those types of things, would get an analyst,\u201d Brown said, explaining items such as teeth and skeletal material would be separated, inventoried and assigned to analysts as well. To test for DNA samples, Brown said a minimum of one gram of dense bone is needed. The results are then compared to a DNA sample from the missing service member\u2019s medical file. \u201cIn order to make that identification, you have to get both sides to match up. If I don\u2019t have any dental records or medical records or a DNA sample \u2013 it doesn\u2019t matter how much really great data I can collect from what I have in the lab \u2013 I can never match those up,\u201d Brown said. The agency is responsible for doing background research, getting excavation teams out to the field, and conducting lab analysis. The best quality DNA samples are sent to the Armed Forces Medical Examiner System\u2019s DNA identification lab at Dover Air Force Base in Delaware to confirm the identification. Once confirmed, the Army Past Conflict Repatriation Branch connects with family members to collect reference samples to potentially match the DNA. It can take up to a year and a half from conducting the field recovery to making a positive identification. Brown described herself and her team as civil servants dedicated to returning their nation\u2019s fallen. Though the processes can be grueling, and each case may have its own obstacles along the way, \u201cYou can\u2019t get past that human component,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019ve put all these pieces together and now it links up with a person with a story.\u201d Brown said the first thing guests see when they enter the DPAA lab is the part of the Soldier\u2019s Creed, which says, \u201cI will never leave a fallen comrade.\u201d \u201cIt says everything about us as a nation, it says we are not going to give up. And if you\u2019ve fallen overseas, we are going to keep searching for you no matter what it takes,\u201d she said. Reconnecting across generations The families of Donohue, Madson and Brooks have been notified by the agency they are currently looking for their loved ones\u2019 remains, and the process may take time. The agency meets with families of missing service members throughout the year at Family Member Updates to brief relatives about their specific cases and answer any questions people may have about recovery efforts. Paul Stouffer knows firsthand the impact the agency has on families of fallen soldiers who are searching for answers about their loved ones. He is the nephew of a World War II fighter pilot named Lieutenant William McGowan, who was shot down on D-Day in a P-47 single-engine fighter aircraft. McGowan was only 23 years old when he died, and Stouffer spent his whole life watching his mother and grandparents pursue details about his death, and where his remains could have possibly ended up. After the war, the American Graves Registration Service located the P-47 crash site but did not find McGowan\u2019s remains at the time. His name was engraved on the Wall of the Missing at the Normandy American cemetery. In 2009, Stouffer heard about other missing service members being accounted for and reached out to the agency to offer his DNA samples for analysis. In 2018, the agency excavated his uncle\u2019s crash site and recovered human remains, which were identified the following year as McGowan. Stouffer attended his burial service at the American Cemetery in Normandy in 2022 and gave the eulogy for an uncle he had always dreamed about, but never met. \u201cIt was the phone call that I wish my grandparents had got, or even later, I wish my mom had been alive for that moment as well,\u201d Stouffer said. \u201cOne of the things that really stuck with me is knowing that after my mother was gone, that he would not be forgotten.\u201d Stouffer watched during the burial ceremony in Normandy as a rosette was placed on the Wall of the Missing next to McGowan\u2019s name, signifying that he had been found. If ye break faith with us who die, we shall not sleep World War II still has 72,000 American soldiers who are unaccounted for, according to the agency. It\u2019s conducting operations year-round in 45 countries, working to recover the remains of fallen U.S. soldiers and uphold the promise of the United States Military to \u201cleave no man behind.\u201d The agency handles each case of a missing person with dignity and respect for those who gave their lives for their country. They work under strict protocols and protective processes to ensure they get every detail correct, leaving no grain of sand unsifted. When missing service members are identified, the agency gives family members the option to have the remains buried with full military honors back home, or to receive the same honors in a burial abroad where they died. Photos of the three missing airmen were stationed at the dig site, providing what the team calls intrinsic motivation along their search. Foxworth said after 17 years in the Air Force, this was one of his most important missions. He has been on other recovery efforts with the agency, but says this operation hits a little closer to home. \u201cWe sign the dotted line knowing what that means. It may require us sacrificing our own lives. One of the mottoes we have is we\u2019ll never leave an airman behind, so this is us fulfilling that obligation. And it\u2019s an obligation that I\u2019m extremely lucky to be a part of,\u201d Foxworth said. \u201cNo matter how long it takes\u2026 we won\u2019t stop. We\u2019ll keep searching.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/02/us/world-war-two-remains-dna-research-identify/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/04/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_01_us_bald-eagles-nick-nora-texas", "text": "The squawking cries from a pair of bald eagles pierce the treetops of an urban jungle on the edge of a popular lake in Dallas. The beloved eagles are perched 75 feet high over their nest, damaged by a violent storm system that ripped through North Texas on Tuesday. Inside the nest were the bald eagle\u2019s two 9-week-old eaglets, thrown from their sanctuary by hurricane-strength winds. The mother and father have spent the days since the storm circling and searching for their offspring on the ground below. The scene has been heartbreaking to watch for Chris Giblin, an amateur photographer who has spent three years documenting the eagles. \u201cIt hurts,\u201d said Giblin. \u201cIt hurts to see them hurting. Nothing is promised when these storms come through.\u201d This bald eagle family has developed a legion of followers and admirers since they made this spot around White Rock Lake in East Dallas their home nearly three years ago. They came to be known as \u201cNick\u201d and \u201cNora\u201d after the husband-and-wife detective characters in the 1930s film \u201cThe Thin Man.\u201d Their every move has been documented in neighborhood Facebook groups and by a devoted and highly protective contingent of photographers. The eagles have so intensely captured the imagination of the neighbors below them that residents speak of these raptors in mystical terms and their presence as \u201cdivine intervention.\u201d The eagle\u2019s nest sits in a sycamore tree at the end of Krista de la Harpe\u2019s street. She describes the relationship between the birds and the neighborhood as a \u201cthree-year love story.\u201d As the storm hit the city, she could only think about the eagles and their babies surviving the fierce winds and falling trees. \u201cI was in my closet all through the storm, just praying for them,\u201d de la Harpe said as she watched the eagles sitting in the trees this week. \u201cIt\u2019s so heartbreaking.\u201d \u2018I found one\u2019 After the storm passed, neighbors raced out to check on the nest and the eagles. Water was rushing over the banks of the creek below the nest. The fierce winds toppled a mix of large oak, cedar and American elm trees, and the eaglets were nowhere to be seen. Brett Johnson, an urban biologist and conservation manager for the City of Dallas, raced to the park after the storm. He saw half the nest was gone and that the two eaglets were missing. Later that morning, Bryna Thomson searched the creek area with neighbors when she heard her friend shouting, \u201cI found one. I found one. I found one.\u201d The video she captured shows an eaglet shivering and soaked in rain but seemingly not severely injured, even eating a fish it had caught in the floodwaters. \u201cThey were healthy babies,\u201d Thomson said. The neighbor called in to report what they had found. Johnson says he collaborated with state game wardens and US Fish and Wildlife Services to get permission to handle the federally protected bird and move it to a rehabilitation facility that specializes in treating bald eagles. The facility did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for an interview. Sunday morning, specialists with the Blackland Prairie Raptor Center brought the surviving eaglet back to its nesting area around White Rock Lake in hopes it will quickly reunite with its parents. Nick and Nora were seen flying around the area and specialists say they hope the parents will hear the eaglet squawking and return to care for it. The second eaglet has not been found and officials say it\u2019s likely the bird did not survive. Downed trees have made it impossible for searchers to safely access the spots where the eaglet might have fallen. The area is also home to bald eagle predators like coyotes and bobcats. The raptor specialists brought the recovered eaglet to the wooded area in a large crate. The bird\u2019s face was covered in a hood to keep it from seeing and experiencing this confusing environment. Hailey Lebaron, a rehab specialist with the Blackland Prairie Raptor Center, secured the eagle and carried it up the stairs and placed it in a makeshift nest that was made just for this moment. Lebaron removed the hood from the eagle\u2019s head and the bird immediately extended its wings and rustled around the nest. It reacted just the way the specialists wanted it to when the bird realized there was a strange creature \u2013 a human \u2013 so close to it. \u201cLuckily, it was not happy,\u201d Lebaron said. \u201cThe feathers raised up, which is their, \u2018Look at how scary I am.\u2019 It\u2019s a great sign for us.\u201d After the eaglet was recovered Tuesday, rehab specialists gave the raptor a full exam which included x-rays and blood work. The bird was deemed healthy enough to return to the wild after it was monitored for several days. By Friday afternoon, the rehab team knew it was racing against the clock. After a week of separation, it\u2019s more likely the parent eagles would abandon their offspring. \u201cWe had to jump into action,\u201d Lebaron said. \u201cIt\u2019s really, really time sensitive if we wanted it to work. Otherwise, the baby would be rejected by the parents.\u201d Rehab facility volunteers will now work in two-hour shifts until Monday evening to monitor the eaglet from about 100 yards away. If the parents do not return to the eaglet by then, officials say the bird will likely be brought back to the Blackland Prairie Raptor Center. If that happens, facility officials say they will then protect the bird until it can properly fly and learn how to hunt and take care of itself. At that point, the bald eagle would be released into the wild but in a different location, away from its territorial parents. Earlier in the week, Scott Meril, a retired medical doctor, came to the nesting area to capture photographs of the mourning eagle parents. The images show one of the eagles squawking into the sky with its head tilted back in a pose that seemed to capture the bird\u2019s desperation. Meril said he was struck by the eagle\u2019s majestic and powerful stare as they scanned the urban landscape looking for the eaglets. \u201cTo see them in Texas, it\u2019s wild,\u201d Meril said. \u2018You can\u2019t fight this stupid Texas weather\u2019 This isn\u2019t the first time tragedy has struck Nick and Nora\u2019s quest to bring a successful clutch of eggs into the world. In February 2022, the mating bald eagles built a nest in the same area near White Rock Lake. Residents came from across the city to catch a glimpse of the new stars of the neighborhood, waiting for the babies to hatch. But a severe storm with fierce winds ripped the nest and the tree branches apart. The eggs fell to the ground. \u201cThey have been through a lot,\u201d said Johnson. In 2023, Nick and Nora built a second nest around White Rock Lake but abandoned it and never laid eggs. Johnson says the nest was built in an area that was probably too close to the crowds of people who use the lake for recreation. This year, residents thought the eagles had finally succeeded. The eaglets were just a week or two away from being able to fly on their own. At that point, Nick and Nora would teach them how to hunt for their own food. The day before the storm Giblin captured stunning images of the small birds \u201cbranching\u201d out of their nests \u2013 the first attempts to jump from their nests onto nearby tree branches. The cycle of natural life seemed so close to becoming complete, but again nature intervened in a tragic way. \u201cThey just can\u2019t catch a break,\u201d Thomson said. \u201cThey were good parents, and it\u2019s just that you can\u2019t fight this stupid Texas weather.\u201d Yellowstone comes to Dallas While bald eagles can often be found near large cities, it remains rare for eagles to nest and mate in busy urban areas. This is why Giblin and a group of photographers have spent countless hours documenting the couple. Giblin, who works for a merchandising company, estimates he has snapped more than 20,000 pictures of the eagles since they started appearing regularly here three years ago. He\u2019s so dedicated, he once spent 7 hours waiting to capture a single shot of the eagles flying from their nest. He equates the bald eagles\u2019 presence in Dallas to having Yellowstone National Park in the city \u201cIn this metropolis, they chose to nest right here. It\u2019s absolutely crazy,\u201d Giblin said.\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m down here every weekend. I don\u2019t take it for granted.\u201d Thomson, a middle school science teacher, says the bald eagles have brought her neighborhood closer together. She often sets up a spotting scope connected to an iPad, which she calls \u201cEagle TV,\u201d so children can watch the eagles up-close. \u201cThey\u2019re the coolest birds ever,\u201d Thomson said. \u201cI\u2019m not really a bird person, but apparently I am. Because I sure do like the bald eagle.\u201d These Dallas eagle lovers worry years of disappointment might convince Nick and Nora to abandon their lives around their neighborhood lake and look to build a nest elsewhere. The majestic birds don\u2019t realize they\u2019re the main characters in a love story their neighbors don\u2019t want to end.
