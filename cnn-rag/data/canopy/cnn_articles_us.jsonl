{"id": "2024_06_04_us_juror-bribery-feeding-our-future", "text": "A high-profile federal fraud trial in Minneapolis was rocked this week by allegations that someone tried to bribe a juror with more than $120,000. The FBI says the cash bribe was delivered by an unidentified woman to the home of a person identified as Juror #52. The juror\u00a0was dismissed Monday after\u00a0serving for seven weeks in the trial of seven defendants connected to Feeding Our Future, a non-profit organization allegedly used to skim nearly $250 million from federal child nutrition programs. The Minneapolis Star-Tribune\u00a0and CNN affiliate KARE reported that a second juror was dismissed Tuesday after hearing about the bribery attempt. Both dismissed jurors were replaced with alternates. According to an FBI affidavit, a relative answered the door when the cash was delivered to the juror\u2019s home. \u201cThe woman told the relative to tell Juror #52 to say not guilty tomorrow and there would be more of that present tomorrow,\u201d the affidavit said. The person delivering the bribe used the juror\u2019s first name. \u201cWhile the general public did not have access to the personal information of jurors, counsel for the government, counsel for the defense, and the seven defendants on trial had access to this information,\u201d the affidavit states. The FBI seized all seven defendants\u2019 cell phones, but no one has been charged in connection with the attempted bribe. The home of one of the defendants was raided by the FBI Wednesday, KARE reported. Neighbors saw agents carrying bags out of the home of Abdiaziz Farah, the news station reported. An FBI spokesperson did not confirm who lived at the home. \u201cThe FBI was present in Savage, MN conducting court authorized law enforcement activity. I cannot provide or confirm any additional information,\u201d spokesperson Diana Freedman told the Associated Press. CNN reached out to Farah\u2019s attorney, Andrew Birrell, for comment on the search Thursday. He declined to comment to the Associated Press Wednesday. Attorneys for all of the defendants condemned the allegations, the Sahan Journal reported.\u00a0\u201cThe claims about a juror being approached in this way are beyond shocking \u2014they\u2019re un-American,\u201d Birrell told the news outlet earlier this week. Photos taken by police showed multiple stacks of cash \u2013 including $20, $50 and $100 bills \u2013 held together with rubber bands and placed in a large fabric shopping bag decorated with flowers and butterflies. Juror #52 is not accused of any wrongdoing and immediately called 911 after receiving the bag of money, FBI Special Agent Travis Wilmer said. After learning of the allegations, Judge Nancy Brasel ordered all seven defendants on trial to be held without bond and also sequestered the remaining jurors, the Star-Tribune\u00a0reported. Thursday marks the third day of jury deliberations. This story has been updated with additional information.

{"id": "2024_06_06_politics_trump-campaign-trail-conviction", "text": "During his decades in the public eye, Donald Trump has stood before crowds as a builder of skyscrapers and casinos, a best-selling author, a reality television host, a husband and father, a New Yorker and Floridian, and a current and former president of the United States. On Thursday, he addressed an audience for the first time with his newest moniker: Felon. Trump spoke at a town hall in Phoenix, marking his first campaign appearance since a Manhattan jury last week convicted the presumptive Republican nominee on 34 counts related to a scheme to pay off a porn star ahead of the 2016 election \u2014 in a trial that he falsely referred to as \u201crigged\u201d on Thursday. Trump will next head to California for a fundraising swing before a rally in Las Vegas on Sunday, his first since the verdict. The flurry of events signals a new phase of the campaign for Trump with his New York case now largely behind him. No longer tethered to a Manhattan courtroom during the week, Trump is expected to ramp up his activity as he pivots from the trial to the trail. But as he steps back onto the campaign trail as a convicted felon, the urgency for Trump has crystalized. Now staring down a sentence in the hush money case, his best ticket to avoid more serious charges in the three other indictments he faces is convincing Americans to put him in office again. Trump\u2019s allies have responded to the unprecedented moment with escalating calls for retribution \u2013 both in the immediate aftermath of his conviction and if he recaptures the White House. Trump himself has also threatened his political opponents, continuing the retaliatory rhetoric that has permeated from his campaign since the onset. \u201cIt\u2019s a terrible precedent for our country,\u201d Trump said during an interview with Newsmax that aired Tuesday. \u201cDoes that mean the next president does it to them? That\u2019s really the question.\u201d Trump had already galvanized his supporters around his legal troubles long before last week\u2019s verdict. His rallies had become a space for Trump to riff on his multiple indictments, test the boundaries of gag orders, attack the justice system and cast himself as a victim in a conspiratorial plot to keep him from the White House. His campaign believes that messaging has braced the Republican base for this outcome \u2013 and it isn\u2019t expected to stop. His supporters have responded with an unprecedented wave of donations that flooded the Trump campaign\u2019s coffers with $53 million online in the 24 hours after his conviction, his advisers said, and the fundraising appeals centered on his convictions have continued. In text messages Saturday to supporters, Trump\u2019s campaign sent a link to donate and wrote, \u201cI\u2019m still standing. 34 rigged felony convictions can\u2019t keep me down.\u201d Still, Trump can\u2019t soon move out from under the lasting cloud of his felonies nor the uncertainty it has cast over his third White House bid. Chief among the unknowns is how the broader electorate will respond to the first criminal conviction of a former US president. The event in Arizona \u2014 from which 11 people were transported to hospitals after reports of heat exhaustion, according to the Phoenix Fire Department \u2014 was hosted by the conservative group Turning Point Action. Trump\u2019s arrival put him in a state where undecided voters could determine his fate and comes days after President Joe Biden\u2019s latest action to secure the border \u2013 an issue the former president has used to hammer the Democrat with each passing surge of migrant crossings. Biden on Tuesday announced an executive action giving him authority to effectively shut down the US-Mexico border to asylum seekers entering illegally when a daily threshold of crossings is exceeded. Biden and his allies have framed his new policy as moving in the face of Republican inaction, noting that Trump helped kill a bipartisan Senate deal to unleash new resources toward securing the border. \u201cThe American people demand solutions to fix our broken immigration system, but at every step of the way, Donald Trump and MAGA Republicans have made clear they only want chaos and partisan politics as usual,\u201d Biden campaign spokesperson Kevin Munoz said in a statement Tuesday. Trump used the opportunity in Arizona to deliver an extended response to Biden\u2019s asylum action, vowing to rescind it on his first day in office if he wins in November. \u201cJoe Biden wants an invasion. I want a deportation,\u201d Trump said, baselessly calling Biden\u2019s policy \u201cpro-invasion\u201d and \u201cpro-child trafficking.\u201d Much of his prepared remarks focused on immigration, although the event was clearly intended to rally Trump\u2019s base around his recent conviction as well. \u201cPresident Trump has proven time and again that he is an absolute force of nature that the left fears more than any other,\u201d Turning Point Action founder and Trump ally Charlie Kirk said in a statement announcing the town hall. \u201cThey know Joe Biden can\u2019t beat him in a fair fight, so they\u2019ve disgracefully weaponized the justice system.\u201d The Trump campaign, though, was not concerned Trump will muddy the message on immigration by focusing on his legal battles. Trump \u201ccan walk and chew gum,\u201d a source with knowledge of his remarks told CNN prior to the rally. \ufeffThis story has been updated with Trump\u2019s remarks.

{"id": "2024_06_06_us_near-collision-airport-runway-austin", "text": "A FedEx cargo plane trying to land and a Southwest Airlines jet trying to take off nearly collided on an airport runway last year because of an air traffic controller\u2019s faulty assumptions amid heavy fog, investigators with the National Transportation Safety Board said in a hearing Thursday. \u201cIt is an error.\u00a0We\u2019re all human,\u201d said NTSB chairwoman Jennifer Homendy.\u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s why you have technology to provide that extra layer of protection, not just in the tower but also in the cockpit of the airplane.\u201d The hearing concerned one of the country\u2019s closest near-collisions in years as heavy fog enveloped Austin-Bergstrom International Airport in February 2023. Air traffic controllers cleared the FedEx Boeing 767 to land on Runway 18 Left and had also approved the Southwest Airlines Boeing 737 jet to take off using the same runway, the NTSB said. The FedEx crew realized they were about to land on top of the Southwest plane and called for the Southwest crew to abort the takeoff. The FedEx crew then aborted their landing \u2013 averting what could have been a mass disaster. The incident came amid a sharp rise in \u201crunway incursions\u201d last year. The NTSB on Wednesday said that a near-collision between two planes at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York in January 2023 was caused by pilots who were repeatedly distracted in the cockpit. The Federal Aviation Administration responded to the string of incidents with additional controller training and a rare national safety summit.\u00a0There have been at least seven in that top category so far this year \u2013 classified in FAA nomenclature as level A or B. Of the 23 near-collisions last year, Austin was the closest. \u201cThis really could have ended up in catastrophe and the death of 133 people,\u201d Homendy told CNN after the board meeting. Air traffic controller had \u2018inaccurate mental model\u2019 The hearing on Thursday offered further details on the near-collision and recommendations for how to prevent such an incident going forward. The air traffic controller who had cleared both flights, Damian Campbell, later told NTSB investigators that he \u201ccouldn\u2019t see anything\u201d\u00a0on\u00a0the ground through the fog. The NTSB\u2019s new findings show that when the Southwest pilot radioed the tower, the controller \u201cnever determined the accurate position of the airplane\u201d prior to clearing\u00a0its\u00a0takeoff. His incorrect assumption was the Southwest plane could take off before an incoming FedEx jet landed on the same runway. However, taxiing and takeoff take longer in poor weather, and the Southwest plane sat on the runway for 19 seconds performing a procedure\u00a0that is\u00a0required under the weather conditions, the board said. The board concluded\u00a0the controller\u00a0used an \u201cinaccurate mental model\u201d and was biased in his past experience of Southwest pilots promptly departing when he assumed the Southwest jet could make it in time. Ultimately, the FedEx plane was between 150 and 175 feet away from landing atop the Southwest plane before anyone spotted potential disaster. A FedEx pilot said in an NTSB interview he saw the silhouette of the Southwest wing appear through the clouds and quickly pulled away. The weather in Austin that day was so foggy that the controller later told investigators he was listening for the Southwest plane\u2019s engines to know whether it had taken off.\u00a0After the FedEx pilot averted the collision, the controller issued instructions that suggested he believed the Southwest jet was still on the ground, a board member said. \u201cThat is not indicative of a safe aviation system,\u201d Homendy said. \u201cThat\u2019s not safety.\u201d The NTSB issued seven recommendations Thursday based on the Austin incident, including installing technology at all commercial airports to detect movement of planes and vehicles on the ground.\u00a0The technology is currently only in use at a few dozen airports. The NTSB called on the FAA to require pilots to report their position frequently when taxiing in limited visibility conditions. The board also revealed alarming conditions for the weather office at the Austin airport, although the members did not fault the observer on duty. The windowless weather office has no internet access and no cell phone service. And the office has an FAA-issued computer but no password to log on.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/06/us/near-collision-airport-runway-austin/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/07/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_04_us_fort-lupton-colorado-police-suspect-train-crash-settlement", "text": "Local Colorado officials have reached an $8.5 million settlement with a woman who was hospitalized in 2022 after being left handcuffed in a police SUV that was then hit by a train. The city of Fort Lupton and town of Platteville, Colorado, agreed on the settlement with the victim, Yareni Rios-Gonzalez, according to a release from the Fort Lupton Police Department. The settlement amount will be split equally between the town and city and paid by their insurers, according to attorney Eric M. Ziporin, whose office represents the city. Rios, who was a suspect in a road rage case, survived the September 2022 collision but suffered nine broken ribs, a broken arm and other injuries. \u201cThis voluntary settlement is to the mutual satisfaction of the parties, recognizes the gravity of this matter, and allows all parties to move forward,\u201d the Fort Lupton police department said. Fort Lupton police officer Jordan Steinke, who placed Rios in the vehicle, was found guilty last year of reckless endangerment and third-degree assault in the crash and was sentenced to serve 30 months of supervised probation and 100 hours of public service. On the day of the crash, Steinke joined a traffic stop in which officers had pulled over Rios, who authorities said was suspected of brandishing a gun at another driver earlier in the evening. Steinke put Rios into the cruiser of Platteville police officer Pablo Vasquez, who had parked in the middle of a railroad crossing. Body and dash camera video released by police showed Rios screaming for help as the train approached and slammed into the vehicle. Steinke argued during her trial that she didn\u2019t notice the location of the railroad tracks despite several warning signs, including one next to where she parked her vehicle. The officer said she was not fully aware of her surroundings because she was concerned about approaching a suspect who may have a gun. \u201cYou can only divide your attention so much,\u201d Steinke testified. CNN has sought comment from the Town of Platteville and an attorney for Rios regarding the settlement.

{"id": "2024_06_05_us_tennessee-lawsuit-state-statute-misinterpretation", "text": "Two families have filed a federal lawsuit against Tennessee Governor Bill Lee and the Williamson County School District, claiming their middle school kids were arrested, strip-searched, placed in solitary confinement, forced to undergo evaluations and placed on house arrest after officials misinterpreted a\u00a0Tennessee statute\u00a0and claimed that conversations between peers were \u201cthreats of mass violence.\u201d The lawsuit stems from two separate, unrelated incidents in August 2023 where a pair of students were accused of making threatening speech. However,\u00a0according to the lawsuit, the speech used by the middle schoolers in the two separate incidents did not rise to the level of a threat of mass violence nor did it amount to actions \u201cthat a reasonable person would conclude would lead to serious bodily injury\u201d or the death of two or more people, as defined in\u00a0Tennessee statute 39-16-517. The lawsuit challenges the way school officials applied\u00a0Tennessee statute 39-16-517, a 2021 \u201czero tolerance\u201d law\u00a0that addresses communications of threats of mass violence on school property or at school related events and requires districts to expel students for one year if they have been found to have made threats of mass violence. In an August 10, 2023 incident, a 14-year-old boy, identified as B.N., was accused\u00a0by a fellow student\u00a0of making threats about having a gun in his backpack, shooting up the school and having a bomb at home, claims the boy denied. The boy said his only mention of guns was when he told friends about a lunchtime conversation he had with another boy who had described the firearms his grandfather owned. Following interviews with school officials and police, B.N. \u201cwas taken into custody for violating\u201d the Tennessee statute captioned \u201cThreat of Mass Violence on School Property,\u201d the lawsuit said. He was placed on a 24-hour solitary confinement hold, and required to strip down and change into jail attire while an adult male guard was facing away, the lawsuit said. B.N. was incarcerated for four days and later placed under house arrest in the custody of his parents, according to the lawsuit.\u00a0He was \u201ccompletely banned from any Williamson County School grounds,\u201d the lawsuit said. B.N. also faced a 365-day suspension under the zero tolerance rules. According to court documents, after B.N. appealed the suspension, Williamson County Superintendent Jason Golden concluded that B.N created a rumor \u201cof a threat of a weapon\u201d at school, and although the \u201cjoke caused a disruption in school,\u201d he could return. \u201cYou can blame Governor Bill Lee,\u201d Page Middle School Principal Eric Lifsey allegedly told the 14-year-old boy and his mother. \u201cWe don\u2019t think of you as a threat. That was never the case,\u201d the lawsuit said. CNN reached out to Lifsey for comment. A spokesperson for Williamson County Schools said in an email to CNN that the district does not comment on pending litigation. Governor Lee\u2019s office has not responded to CNN\u2019s request for comment. \u201cThe new Tennessee zero tolerance law is being used as bludgeon against children who engage in innocuous conduct typical of all teenagers,\u201d Larry Crain, attorney for the families, said in a statement to CNN. The second incident occurred on August 22, 2023. According to the lawsuit, school officials said the text of a 13-year-old student at Fairview Middle School, identified as H.M., was deemed a \u201cThreat of Mass Violence.\u201d The text, which was sent in a school email group chat, said \u201cOn Thursday, we will kill all the Mexicos.\u201d According to court documents, the full transcript of the chat, later obtained by H.M.\u2019s mother, showed that other girls within the chat were teasing H.M. for \u201clooking Mexican because of her darker complexion.\u201d After one friend asked H.M. what she was doing on Thursday, H.M. \u201cresponded in jest, \u2018on Thursday we kill all the Mexico\u2019s,\u2019\u201d the lawsuit said. H.M. was arrested at school, brought to the Williamson County Juvenile Detention Center, forced to undergo a strip search, take a shower while a camera was trained on her and placed in a cell where she was questioned by individuals who asked if she had ever had sex, an abortion or suicidal thoughts. H.M. was also suspended from school and was ordered to be evaluated for mental illness. She was offered a choice of voluntary or involuntary commitment to determine if she was competent to stand trial, the lawsuit said. The lawsuit said the two students have \u201csuffered a severe and serious emotional injury\u201d and were \u201cunable to adequately cope with the mental stress\u201d from the circumstances surrounding their cases. Since filing the lawsuit, Crain said in his statement to CNN that his office has learned of \u201cseveral more children who have been wrongfully turned over to criminal prosecution\u201d by the school district. \u201cThis lawsuit seeks to declare this new law unconstitutional as applied to innocent acts of these children,\u201d he said. \u201cIt also seeks compensatory damages against the school district for violating its own internal school board policies and routinely referring children for criminal prosecution.\u201d Zero tolerance policies create \u2018threatening climate,\u2019 report says Everytown for Gun Safety released a 2022 report on how to stop shootings and gun violence in schools, in the wake of the mass shooting at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, earlier that year. The report, which calls for the need to take meaningful action against gun violence in US schools, focuses on approaches that have been proven most effective and says most students facing crises will never act out violently and must not be treated like criminals. So-called \u201czero tolerance\u201d policies, such as Tennessee\u2019s, \u201ccan end up punishing students who exhibit behavior that actually requires compassionate intervention,\u201d the report says. According to Everytown research, zero tolerance policies can create a \u201cthreatening climate that instills fear and erodes student trust,\u201d which can deter students from sharing information when they are concerned about classmates. The approach in these policies has had a \u201cprofoundly negative effect\u201d on students of color, the research shows. \u201cOur recommended practice is the opposite of \u2018zero tolerance\u2019 and is not based on a punitive or criminal justice approach and should not rely on exclusionary discipline as a means of intervention,\u201d Everytown\u2019s report says.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/05/us/tennessee-lawsuit-state-statute-misinterpretation/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/07/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_06_us_gilgo-beach-killings-rex-heuermann-indictment", "text": "Gilgo Beach serial killings suspect\u00a0Rex Heuermann\u00a0now faces charges in the deaths of six women spanning three decades and multiple Long Island communities after he was indicted on two new murder charges Thursday \u2014 the latest development in an investigation authorities in New York say is far from over. Heuermann pleaded not guilty to charges of second-degree murder in the 2003 death of Jessica Taylor and the 1993 death of Sandra Costilla. The 60-year-old architect was taken by surprise by Thursday\u2019s charges, and he is \u201cin a bad place in terms of the new charges,\u201d his attorney Michael Brown said after his client appeared in an eastern Long Island courtroom. Heuermann was remanded without bail and is expected in court July 30. \u201cOne murder is obviously horrific, and it\u2019s a difficult thing to defend,\u201d Brown said. \u201cAnd now we\u2019re at six,\u201d Brown said. Gasps were heard in the courtroom as Suffolk County prosecutor Nicholas Santomartino described the disturbing content he said authorities discovered on Heuermann\u2019s devices, including a planning document outlining a strategy for future killings. A Word document Heuermann allegedly created on a laptop in 2000 and modified over several years outlines how to dispose of a body, avoid apprehension and not leave DNA evidence, along with what supplies may be needed to carry out serial murder, according to the bail application. A section called \u201cbody prep\u201d detailed steps to clean, dismember and transport bodies, while a \u201cpost event\u201d section of the document appeared to be a checklist of tasks to avoid apprehension, including having a story set, according to the bail application. \u201cThis was a planning document used by Heuermann to methodically blueprint and plan out his kills with excruciating detail. His intent was specifically to locate these victims, hunt them down to bring them under his control and to kill them,\u201d Suffolk County District Attorney Raymond Tierney\u00a0said in a news conference after the court appearance. Other evidence \u201crevealed Heuermann\u2019s significant collection of violent, bondage, and torture pornography, currently dating back to 1994,\u201d the bail application reads. Taylor\u2019s remains were discovered in part in Manorville in 2003, with more found along Ocean Parkway on Gilgo Beach in 2011. Manorville is around 45 miles northeast of Gilgo and about 40 miles east of Massapequa Park, Heuermann\u2019s hometown. Her remains were found face up, decapitated, with her hands and arms severed below the elbows. A tattoo had been obliterated with a sharp object, Tierney said. Taylor was working as a sex worker in New York City when she went missing, and officials know Heuermann was in the city the last day Taylor was seen there, he added. When Taylor failed to return home for her mom\u2019s birthday, her family alerted law enforcement and some of her body was recovered the next day. Witnesses said they saw a dark-colored pickup near where her body was eventually recovered, according to the bail application. Costilla\u2019s remains were found in North Sea in 1993 by two hunters in the woods, according to the bail application. She was found on her back, with 25 sharp force injuries believed to have been imposed post-mortem, Tierney said. Forensic testing performed on strands of hair found on or near both Taylor and Costilla\u2019s remains found that the 99.96% of the North American population could be excluded as the source of the hairs \u2013\u00a0but Heuermann could not. The bail application highlights that two different forensic laboratories determined hairs recovered on five of the six charged victims were tied to Heuermann, members of his immediate family or to people he lived with, according to the document. \u201cDefendant Heuermann is the individual who murdered, stripped, restrained, and transported the remains of Jessica Taylor and Sandra Costilla, as well as the Gilgo Four, until they were each discovered in 1993, 2003, 2010, and 2011,\u201d the bail application reads. Heuermann was initially arrested in July 2023 and was charged with murder in the killings of four women whose bodies were discovered bound with belts or tape and wrapped in burlap along a stretch of Long Island\u2019s Gilgo Beach in 2010. Those victims \u2013 Melissa Barthelemy, Megan Waterman, Amber Costello and Maureen Brainard-Barnes \u2013 became known as the \u201cGilgo Four.\u201d Heuermann pleaded not guilty to the charges related to all four. The women were among at least 11 sets of remains discovered near the waterfront in Long Island\u2019s Suffolk County since 2010. Authorities have accused Heuermann of leading a double life, with his wife and children away for most of the alleged murders. That allegedly allowed Heuermann \u201cunfettered time to execute his plans for each victim without any fear that his family would uncover or learn of his involvement in these crimes,\u201d prosecutors previously said in an indictment. Less than a week after Heuermann\u2019s arrest, his wife filed for divorce. But she has since said she does not believe Heuermann is capable of the alleged crimes. In January, Brown told reporters the former New York architect claimed he\u2019s \u201cnot guilty of these charges\u201d and looks forward to fighting the charges in court. \u2018We are not near the end of this investigation,\u2019 law enforcement source says Tierney announced Thursday that investigators have discovered a plethora of new evidence at Heuermann\u2019s Massapequa Park house, including cameras, computers, hard drives, cell phones and other devices. Detectives believe, based on \u201coffender characteristics\u201d of serial killers, there may be more alleged killings, according to officials briefed on the investigation. \u201cIn most of these cases, a serial killer does not start killing in his 40s,\u201d said a law enforcement official familiar with the case. That belief spurred investigators to not only expand their attempts to identify unidentified victims, re-examine dump sites and conduct additional searches of Heuermann\u2019s home, but to also begin reexamining unsolved missing persons cases. Investigators are also looking at seemingly unrelated unsolved homicides where there may be similarities among the victims, the crime scenes or condition of the bodies. \u201cWe are not near the end of this investigation,\u201d\u00a0one law enforcement official involved in the sweeping case said. \u201cWe are very much at the beginning.\u201d CNN\u2019s John Miller, Emma Tucker and Ray Sanchez contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/06/us/gilgo-beach-killings-rex-heuermann-indictment/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/07/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_06_politics_bob-menendez-trial-gurbir-grewal", "text": "New Jersey\u2019s top prosecutor and a high-ranking deputy had just finished a 2019 meeting with US Sen. Bob Menendez in the Democrat\u2019s Newark office. After a quiet elevator ride down to their car, Andrew Bruck turned to his boss, state Attorney General Gurbir Grewal, and broke the silence. \u201cWhoa,\u201d Bruck said, \u201cthat was gross.\u201d The unnerving exchange with Menendez, Grewal testified in federal court Thursday, was his second such conversation with the senator, who is being tried on charges that he engaged in a bribery scheme and acted as a foreign agent for the Egyptian government. Like in a previous exchange, months earlier, Menendez told Grewal he was concerned over the treatment of Hispanic defendants \u2013 a worry, the senator said on both occasions, tied to a specific, ongoing case being handled by the attorney general\u2019s office of insurance. Grewal, who left office in 2021, told the court that the initial call had caught him off-guard. He had no personal relationship with the senator, who called him on his private line after obtaining the number through Grewal\u2019s cousin. After some small talk, Grewal said, Menendez pivoted to the matter he would bring up again in his office \u2013 with no one present but him and the two visitors \u2013 on September 6, 2019. On both occasions, Grewal testified, he told Menendez that the defense lawyer in the case, Michael Critchley, should be the one to raise any issues \u2013 and that if he did, they should be directed not to him but to the prosecution team or judge. Menendez, in Grewal\u2019s opinion, seemed surprised that Bruck had come along for the in-person meeting. Once inside, seated at a small circular conference table at the front of Menendez\u2019s sprawling, high-windowed office, the senator again pressed Grewal on the treatment of Hispanic defendants. Grewal said Menendez then, once again, brought up the case of Elvis Parra, who had been indicted on insurance fraud charges. Parra was an associate of businessman Jose Uribe, who was indicted as part of the bribery scheme before striking a plea deal with federal prosecutors earlier this year. Grewal testified that Menendez never explicitly identified the case or defendants by name in either interaction, only telling Grewal it involved Hispanic truckers prosecuted by the insurance fraud division in the attorney general\u2019s office. \u201cI didn\u2019t know the case. I didn\u2019t want to know the case,\u201d Grewal said, telling the court he still does not know the details of the case Menendez was discussing. The meeting ended shortly thereafter, lasting about 15 minutes. Menendez had retreated to small talk, Grewal said, after the attorney general again refused to engage on the specifics. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t an explicit ask,\u201d Grewal told the court, but he had become concerned that Menendez was trying to meddle with the case. He did not tell any of his rank-and-file attorneys about their exchanges. \u201cInsulating the team from any type of pressure or interference from the outside\u201d was an important part of his job, Grewal said, telling the court he believed spreading word of Menendez\u2019s interest risked creating \u201ca chilling effect\u201d around the case. Menendez\u2019s lawyers disputed that notion, repeatedly asking Grewal if their client had in any way threatened or sought to intimidate him. His answer, over and over again, was no. The pressure, Grewal said, was baked into their conversations from the start. Menendez \u201cwas a close political ally of the governor\u2019s, so that was my concern, sort of being on his bad side,\u201d Grewal testified. Grewal is the government\u2019s 14th witness in a trial that is already in its fourth week,\u00a0as prosecutors try to prove Menendez, two co-defendants and the senator\u2019s wife, Nadine, engaged in a global bribery scheme that delivered the Menendezes gold bars, blocks of cash and a new Mercedes in exchange for the senator using his post and power to influence public officials to benefit his associates. \u201cRobert Menendez was a United States senator on the take,\u201d Lara Pomerantz, an assistant US attorney, told the jury in her opening remarks. \u201cMotivated by greed, focused on how much money he could put in his own pocket and his wife\u2019s pocket.\u201d The senator\u2019s team has insisted that he committed no crimes and, to the extent that there had been any unsavory business dealings, Nadine Menendez was the driving force. Nadine\u2019s trial was separated and pushed back to this summer. The senator disclosed last month that she has breast cancer. In testimony a day earlier, an FBI agent combed through a massive trove of communications among the alleged conspirators, including text message exchanges focused on the Parra case. In January 2019, Nadine, who was Menendez\u2019s girlfriend at the time, asked Wael Hana, an Egyptian American businessman and one of the co-defendants, to tell her \u201cwhat the charges are.\u201d (Lawyers for Hana and developer Fred Daibes, the third alleged co-conspirator, declined to cross-examine Grewal.) \u201cThe matter only involves four counts,\u201d Hana replied, and is \u201ca relatively small indictment.\u201d A few minutes later, Nadine called the senator. Uribe is expected to testify Friday.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/06/politics/bob-menendez-trial-gurbir-grewal/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/07/2024", "section": "us"}}

{"id": "2024_06_05_us_brooklyn-man-arrested-illegal-betting-scheme-jontay-porter", "text": "A Brooklyn man was charged with conspiring with three others to defraud a sports betting company by using inside information from an NBA player to successfully bet on the performance of that player, who was later banned from the league, according to a federal complaint filed this week. Long Phi Pham is accused of conspiring with others who bet the player would underperform in a January 26 game and a March 20 game, the document signed by an FBI agent says. Pham and the others knew the player planned to withdraw from those games for purported health reasons, thus rendering those \u201cunder\u201d proposition bets successful, the criminal complaint says. The complaint refers to the player as \u201cPlayer 1,\u201d though after a review of court documents, CNN has determined the player is former Toronto Raptors big man\u00a0Jontay Porter, who two months ago was banned for life from the NBA. Proposition bets, also known as prop bets, can refer to wagers on individual statistics, and betting the \u201cunder\u201d means someone bet that the stat in question would be less than a figure proposed ahead of time by a sports betting company. Pham \u2013 who had been arrested Monday at an New York airport where he authorities say he was about to take a flight to Australia \u2013 appeared in court Tuesday. He initially was ordered detained pending trial, prosecutors in the Eastern District of New York said in a news release, noting that three co-conspirators charged in the scheme remain at large. The names of those three people were redacted in the complaint. In a bail hearing Wednesday, a judge said Pham could be released on a $750,000 bond with home detention and electronic monitoring, once surety for the bond is secured, US attorney\u2019s office spokesperson Danielle Hass said. CNN has sought comment from Pham\u2019s attorney, Michael Soshnick. CNN also has sought comment from a representative for Porter. \u201cWhether on the court or in the casino, every point matters. As alleged, the defendant and his co-conspirators, as well as an NBA player, participated in a brazen, illegal betting scheme that had a corrupting influence on two games and numerous bets,\u201d US Attorney Breon Peace said. \u201cThis prosecution serves as a warning that fraud and dishonesty in professional sports will not be tolerated and those who engage in this flagrant flouting of the law will be prosecuted.\u201d Complaint alleges player told gamblers he would come out of games early The player had significant gambling debts, the court document says, citing text messages, cell phone records and wire transfer evidence. To clear those debts, Pham and others encouraged him to withdraw early from certain games so certain bets on game activities like how many points he scored would be successful, authorities allege. Shortly before the January 26 game, the player told the defendants through a Telegram group chat he would remove himself early from the contest, claiming he was injured, according to the court document. He played just over four minutes in that contest, the court document reads. \u201cAfter playing just four minutes \u2026 and recording zero points, three rebounds and one assist, Player 1 removed himself from the game after he complained to team officials that he had reaggravated\u201d a previous eye injury, prosecutors said. The player communicated a similar message to the defendants before the March 20 game, telling them he would claim to be ill, according to the complaint. The documents say he played three minutes in that game. On April 4, in a group chat with the player, Pham and other defendants, the player wrote the group \u201cmight just get hit w a rico\u201d and asked whether the group had \u201cdelete(d) all the stuff\u201d from their personal cell phones, according to the complaint. The FBI agent believed \u201cthese messages refer to Player 1\u2019s concerns that he and certain of the co-conspirators would be criminally investigated for, among other things, violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act,\u201d known as RICO, \u201cand needed to delete any evidence on their personal cell phones,\u201d the agent wrote in the court document. Porter was banned by the NBA in mid-April, with the league saying an investigation found Porter had violated betting rules. NBA said it investigated unusual betting patterns around Porter The NBA announced in March it had opened an investigation into anomalies involving bets pertaining to Porter after unusual betting patterns around the player emerged. Porter had \u201cviolated league rules by disclosing confidential information to sports bettors, limiting his own participation in one or more games for betting purposes, and betting on NBA games,\u201d NBA officials said. When Porter\u2019s ban was announced, NBA commissioner Adam Silver said Porter was receiving the \u201cmost severe punishment.\u201d \u201cThere is nothing more important than protecting the integrity of NBA competition for our fans, our teams and everyone associated with our sport, which is why Jontay Porter\u2019s blatant violations of our gaming rules are being met with the most severe punishment,\u201d Silver said in a release.

{"id": "2024_06_06_politics_takeaways-day-4-hunter-biden-trial", "text": "The prosecution\u2019s most important witness against Hunter Biden, his sister-in-law-turned-girlfriend Hallie Biden, testified Thursday that she believed he was using drugs when she saw him in October 2018, the month he claimed on a federal background check that he was clean. Jurors\u00a0sat forward in their seats while she was on the witness stand. Some who have rarely taken notes jotted on their notepads as she provided critical testimony that filled in some lingering gaps about the time when Biden bought the gun. Biden, President Joe Biden\u2019s son, is charged with three felonies, stemming from prosecutors\u2019 claim that he was using or addicted to drugs when he bought and owned a revolver in October 2018. He pleaded not guilty. He has spoken openly about his yearslong addiction to crack cocaine, and a key witness already testified that she watched him smoking the drug in September and November 2018. Before court wrapped, special counsel David Weiss\u2019 team announced that they planned to rest their case on Friday, after they present testimony from two experts from the FBI and DEA. That puts the case on track to potentially head to the jury early next week, Hunter Biden\u2019s lead attorney said. Here\u2019s what to know from the trial\u2019s fourth day in Wilmington, Delaware: Star witness Hallie Biden In many ways, Hallie Biden, the widow of Beau Biden who then dated his brother Hunter, was teed up to be the special counsel\u2019s star witness. She\u2019s the only person expected to testify who saw Biden in October 2018, when he returned to Delaware and bought the .38 caliber Colt Cobra revolver. She testified that she believed \u2013 based on her observations and his behavior \u2013 that Biden was using crack cocaine around October 22 and 23, days after he purchased the pistol. However, under cross-examination, she acknowledged she didn\u2019t personally see Biden using drugs in the month of October, a point the defense team has zeroed in on \u2013 trying to carve out October and create reasonable doubt. She also said she didn\u2019t see a lot of Biden in October. Jurors saw messages between the two where she was trying to get ahold of him, and wondering if he was seeing other women. In one message from that time period, she asked, \u201cAre you in New York with Zoe?\u201d referring to Zoe Kestan, who was romantically involved with Biden around the same time and testified about his rampant drug abuse. Biden\u2019s lead attorney Abbe Lowell challenged Hallie Biden repeatedly during his extensive cross-examination. Hallie Biden \u2018panicked\u2019 and threw out the gun Hallie Biden described how events spiraled out of control after she found Biden\u2019s gun on October 23, \u201cpanicked\u201d and drove to a grocery store to throw the pistol in a trashcan. \u201cI panicked and I wanted to get rid of them \u2026 because I didn\u2019t want him to hurt himself or I didn\u2019t want my kids to find it and hurt themselves, and I just panicked and wanted to get rid of it,\u201d she testified. She then drove to Janssen\u2019s Market, a grocery store just a couple minutes away, and threw it in a trash can. Hunter Biden quickly discovered that his gun was missing and things went south, according to text messages shown to the jury. He was very angry, she testified. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to believe anyone is that stupid,\u201d he texted her amid the crisis, according to the messages presented by prosecutors. She later replied, \u201cYou can blame me all you want. I know it was stupid, but your part is dangerous and negligent. And because of this and my stupidity for being worried about you, I\u2019m dealing with insanity and possibly I\u2019m the one going to get in trouble.\u201d During cross-examination, Hallie Biden repeatedly said she didn\u2019t recall details from the day, including around phone calls between her and Hunter Biden or the timing of when she found the gun in his truck and where all she went that day. \u201cThere are some things you remember and many things you don\u2019t,\u201d Lowell told her, pointedly. Hallie Biden\u2019s drug use Early in her testimony, Hallie Biden testified to using drugs, saying that Hunter Biden introduced her to crack cocaine in 2018. \u201cIt was a terrible experience that I went through, and I\u2019m embarrassed and I\u2019m ashamed, and I regret that period of my life,\u201d she said. She said she quit in August 2018. She later said she went to rehab in Pennsylvania in early October 2018. Biden attended some \u201ccounseling\u201d with her as part of the treatment, she said. Lowell suggested this was the reason why Hunter Biden returned from Los Angeles to Delaware \u2013 which is where he bought the gun weeks later. Finding the gun Delaware State Police Lt. Millard Greer later testified about the series of events that led to the recovery of Biden\u2019s gun, after Hallie Biden reported it missing. Through security footage and interviews, investigators learned that an elderly man who liked to rummage around trash bins for recyclables may have taken the gun out of the trashcan that Hallie Biden had dropped it in. Greer said he surveilled the man at a Fidelity Investments storefront in the area, before approaching him later. The man, Thomas Banner, acknowledged that he found something very important in the trash. They went back to his home to retrieve the gun, but Banner was locked out of his house and started \u201cpanicking,\u201d Greer said. They eventually got inside, and Banner led Greer to the gun, which\u00a0Greer said\u00a0was\u00a0stuffed\u00a0in a sock\u00a0inside\u00a0a General Motors lunchbox.\u00a0He also, to Greer\u2019s surprise, handed over a second gun that he said he\u00a0had been\u00a0holding on to for years, and was given\u00a0to him\u00a0by a coworker who needed to get rid of\u00a0it to protect his brother. The 80-year-old Banner later took the stand, and both Lowell and prosecutor Derek Hines stood inches away from him during questioning, speaking in slow, clear words because he was hard of hearing. He described how even while at GM, where he worked for more than 30 years, he would collect aluminum cans and recyclables from trash bins. Banner said he\u2019d drive them up to New York to exchange for money, noting\u00a0he used to get a nickel per can but now could only gets upward of 75 cents for a pound. The retiree also identified a brown pouch he found with the gun. Prosecutors say FBI investigators found a white powder that tested positive for cocaine on the pouch, years after it was found. Hines asked the 80-year-old if anyone in his house used cocaine. \u201cNo,\u201d Banner said.

{"id": "2024_06_05_investing_texas-stock-exchange", "text": "Texas\u2019 famous longhorns are coming for Wall Street\u2019s bulls. A new national stock exchange, based in Dallas, and backed by Wall Street heavyweights like BlackRock and Citadel Securities, is looking to take on the world-famous New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq. The newly formed TXSE Group announced its plans to file for registration with the US Securities and Exchange Commission later this year. The group is backed by more than two dozen investors with $120 million in funding \u2013 that makes it the most well-capitalized exchange entrant to even file with the SEC. \u201cWe\u2019re thrilled to bring to fruition the long-held vision for a national stock exchange in Texas,\u201d\u00a0TXSE Group founder and CEO James Lee said in a statement on Wednesday. \u201cTexas and the other states in the southeast quadrant have become economic powerhouses. Combined with the demand we are seeing from investors and corporations for expanded alternatives to trade and list equities, this is an opportune time to build a major, national stock exchange in Texas.\u201d The group said it was hoping to benefit from the more than 5,200 private equity-sponsored companies in the region that may want to go public. Lee told\u00a0The Wall Street Journal that the group hopes to officially launch its exchange in 2026. The problem with going public America has lost half its public companies since the 1990s. Back in 1996, there were 8,000 companies on US exchanges. Today that count has dropped by more than 50% to just 3,700, according to\u00a0data from\u00a0the Center for Research in Security Prices. It\u2019s not that America has half as many companies as 30 years ago \u2013 it\u2019s that companies are increasingly staying private, largely outside the scrutiny of the public eye and markets. Intensified reporting requirements, higher litigation expenses, costly regulations, overbearing board governance, shareholder activism, heightened public scrutiny and the pressure of quarterly earnings have driven companies away from public markets. There are now about five times as many private equity-backed firms in the US as there are\u00a0publicly held companies, according to economists at Wells Fargo. The trend has been growing for some time. In 1999, the average US technology firm transitioned to the public markets after four years, Wells Fargo research shows. By 2019, that figure increased to 11 years. \u201cCompanies that remain private can avoid the burden and cost of regulatory requirements and focus on long-term strategic plans,\u201d they wrote. Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase, expressed worry about the changes in his annual shareholder letter in April. \u201cThis trend is serious,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe really need to consider: Is this the outcome we want?\u201d The TXSE Group said in a press release on Wednesday that it hopes to help relieve some of that burden. \u201cTXSE\u2019s planned launch comes as changes in the equity markets provide an opportunity for greater alignment and more competition,\u201d they wrote. \u201cCorporate issuers and exchange-traded product sponsors are demanding more stability and predictability around listing standards and associated costs. TXSE intends to expand access to US capital markets for all investors, while providing greater access and alignment for public companies and those seeking access to public capital.\u201d While the most popular exchanges in the US are located in New York City, there are about 13 stock exchanges around the country including in Philadelphia and Miami. This exchange, said Lee, would mostly function to list businesses located in Texas and the southeast quadrant of the United States.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/05/investing/texas-stock-exchange/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/07/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_01_15_us_gilgo-beach-murder-case-timeline", "text": "For more than a decade, a string of unsolved killings known as the Gilgo Beach murders terrorized residents and confounded authorities on Long Island\u2019s South Shore after a woman\u2019s 2010 disappearance led investigators to find 10\u00a0sets of human remains in addition to hers and launched\u00a0the hunt for a possible serial killer. Authorities announced a major breakthrough in the case last summer when they charged\u00a0New York architect Rex Heuermann with murder in the killings of three of the four women who became known as the \u201cGilgo Four.\u201d In January, Heuermann was charged with second-degree murder in the fourth killing, that of Maureen Brainard-Barnes, according to an indictment. Brainard-Barnes was 25 years old when she was last seen in July 2007. Her remains were found along the Long Island shoreline in 2010. Five months later, on Thursday, Heuermann, 60, was charged with second-degree murder in the 2003 death of Jessica Taylor and the 1993 death of Sandra Costilla, according to a bail application. Heuermann was taken into custody in July and indicted on one count of first-degree murder and one count of second-degree murder in each of the three killings of\u00a0Melissa Barthelemy in 2009, and Megan Waterman and Amber Costello in 2010, according to the Suffolk County District Attorney. Heuermann has pleaded not guilty to all charges and \u201chas maintained his innocence since day one,\u201d his attorney, Michael Brown, told reporters after the fourth charge was announced. Once Heuermann was identified as a suspect in early 2022, authorities said, they watched him and his family \u2013 getting DNA samples from items in their trash as they built a case. Here is a timeline of the Gilgo Beach killings, how the investigation unfolded and what ultimately led to Heuermann\u2019s arrest. 2010: Authorities find first remains in Gilgo Beach murders Police discovered the first set of female remains in bushes along an isolated strip of waterfront property on Gilgo Beach while searching for another missing woman: Shannan Gilbert, a 23-year-old from Jersey City, New Jersey who hadn\u2019t been seen since May 2010. The remains of Melissa Barthelemy, 24, were the first to be discovered in the case during the search on December 11, 2010, according to Suffolk County officials. Two days later, investigators discovered the remains of three additional victims \u2013 Maureen Brainard-Barnes, Amber Costello and Megan Waterman \u2013 strewn across a half-mile stretch on Gilgo Beach. The four women, who were wrapped in camouflaged burlap, worked as escorts who advertised on Craigslist and were last seen between July 2007 and September 2010, officials said. After Barthelemy\u2019s disappearance, authorities say her family received multiple taunting calls. In one of the calls, the suspect \u201cadmitted killing and sexually assaulting Ms. Barthelemy,\u201d according to a bail application filed by the Suffolk County district attorney after Heuermann\u2019s arrest. Those calls, authorities say, would later help unravel the case. 2011: More remains found, including a toddler and her mother Police said in January 2011 calls from Barthelemy\u2019s cell phone had been traced to midtown Manhattan, with the two last calls made from around Madison Square Garden and Times Square. The caller hung up too quickly for authorities to pinpoint the exact locations of the calls, police said. On March 29, 2011, the partial skeletal remains of another woman were found several miles east of where the bodies of the \u201cGilgo Four\u201d were discovered. The woman was first known as Jane Doe #5\u00a0before investigators identified her as Jessica Taylor, another escort whose partial remains were previously discovered in Manorville in 2003, police said. The following month, on April 4, 2011, three more sets of remains were found on a stretch of Ocean Parkway in Suffolk County near the beach. They included a female toddler, an unidentified Asian male and a woman initially referred to as Jane Doe #6, investigators said. One week later, two additional sets of human remains were found in Nassau County, about 40 miles east of New York City, one of which was identified as the mother of the toddler through DNA analysis. The mother\u2019s partial remains were first discovered in 1997, officials said. The other set of remains \u201cgenetically matched\u201d with remains found in 1996 on Fire Island, \u201csignificantly expanding the timeline and geographic reach\u201d of the investigation, officials said. In mid-April of the same year, Steve Cohen, an attorney for Barthelemy\u2019s mother, said a man using the victim\u2019s cell phone made taunting calls and claimed he killed Barthelemy,\u00a0CNN reported. \u201cDo you think you\u2019ll ever see her again?,\u201d the unidentified male caller asked Barthelemy\u2019s sister on August 26, 2009, according to Cohen. \u201cYou won\u2019t. I killed her,\u201d he added and hung up. The phone call ended after less than a minute, CNN reported at the time. Another phone call was placed in July 2009 just days after Barthelemy disappeared. It was the first of seven calls he made from Barthelemy\u2019s cell phone. Cohen said in the phone call, the unidentified male caller referred to Barthelemy as a \u201cwhore\u201d in a short conversation with her then-15-year-old sister, Cohen told CNN at the time. In the final call, the man described in graphic detail to the victim\u2019s sister what he had done sexually to Barthelemy, Cohen said. In December 2011, Gilbert\u2019s body\u00a0was found in the wooded marshes\u00a0of Suffolk County\u2019s Oak Beach. The beach is about 9 miles from where the 10 other sets of human remains were found. Authorities later said they believed Gilbert\u2019s death may have been accidental and not related to the Gilgo Beach slayings. 2020: Police release photos of a key clue and ID a victim In January 2020, Suffolk County police released photos of what it said could be a significant piece of evidence: a black leather belt embossed with the letters \u201cWH\u201d or \u201cHM.\u201d The department also launched a website to collect new tips in the investigation. \u201cWe believe the belt was handled by the suspect and did not belong to any of the victims,\u201d former Suffolk County Police Commissioner Geraldine Hart told reporters at the time. On May 28, 2020, New York\u2019s Suffolk County Police Department identified \u201cJane Doe #6\u201d as Valerie Mack, a 24-year-old Philadelphia mother who went missing two decades earlier. The FBI helped identify Mack\u2019s remains using advanced forensic DNA technology, officials said. Using samples from her remains, Suffolk County investigators were able to find Mack\u2019s biological relatives through genetic genealogy, which ultimately led to her adoptive family and son, Hart said to reporters at the time. 2022: Police form task force to find killer In February 2022, Suffolk County Police Commissioner Rodney Harrison formed a multiagency task force to investigate the Gilgo Beach killings. The task force included the Suffolk County Police Department, the Suffolk County Sheriff\u2019s Office, the New York State Police and the FBI. On March 14, 2022, Heuermann was first mentioned as a possible suspect in the Gilgo Beach murder case after a New York state investigator identified him in a database, according to Suffolk County District Attorney Ray Tierney. Investigators then started surveilling him and his family and took pieces of garbage to obtain DNA samples \u2013 even discarded pizza crust. As they closed in on Heuermann, investigators used cell tower records from thousands of possible individuals down to hundreds and then to a handful of people. Next, authorities focused on residents who also matched a physical description provided by a witness who had seen the suspected killer. Authorities zeroed in on anyone with a connection to a green pickup truck a witness had seen the suspect driving, according to two law enforcement sources with knowledge of the case. Later, authorities learned Heuermann drove a green pickup truck registered to his brother, CNN reported. Heuermann matched a witness\u2019s physical description, lived close to the Long Island cell site and worked near the New York City cell sites where other calls were captured. Personal cell phone and credit card billing records revealed numerous instances where Heuermann was in the general locations as burner phones, which authorities say he had with him at the killings. He used the phones to call the three victims and also used \u201cBrainard-Barnes and Barthelemy\u2019s cellphones when they were used to check voicemail and make taunting phone calls after the women disappeared,\u201d Suffolk County prosecutors allege. Authorities said a search of Heuermann\u2019s computer revealed he had scoured the internet at least 200 times for details about the status of the investigation, Tierney said. Heuermann was also compulsively searching for photos of the victims and their relatives, and he was trying to track down relatives, the district attorney said. In late 2022, detectives recovered a cup believed to have been discarded by Heuermann, but they could not get a good DNA sample from it, a law enforcement source close to the investigation told CNN. 2023: Rex Heuermann arrested in some of the killings In January 2023, investigators got a complete sample of Heuermann\u2019s DNA from leftover crust in a pizza box he threw in the trash, a law enforcement source close to the investigation told CNN. During the initial examination of one of the victims\u2019 skeletal remains and materials discovered in the grave, the Suffolk County Crime Laboratory recovered a male hair from the \u201cbottom of the burlap\u201d the killer used to wrap her body, according to prosecutors. Analysis of the DNA found on the victim and the pizza thrown out by Heuermann showed the samples matched. Additionally, hair believed to be from Heuermann\u2019s wife was found on or near three of the murder victims, prosecutors allege in the bail application, citing DNA testing. The DNA came from 11 bottles inside a garbage can outside the Heuermann home, the court document says. On July 13, 2023, a suspect connected to some of the Gilgo Beach murders was taken into custody in New York City, marking the first arrest in the case, according to Harrison. He was transported back to Suffolk County Police headquarters in the hamlet of Yaphank on Long Island, the police commissioner said. A day later, authorities identified the suspect as Heuermann, a registered architect who has owned the New York City-based architecture and consulting firm, RH Consultants & Associates, since 1994, according to his company\u2019s website. The case against Heuermann came together over two years with the restart of the investigation, in which investigators used \u201cthe power of the grand jury,\u201d including more than 300 subpoenas and search warrants, to collect evidence and tie Heuermann conclusively to the murders, Tierney said during a news conference. 2024: Charged in 6 deaths over 3 decades Huermann is indicted on two new murder charges on Thursday, with authorities saying their investigation is far from over. He pleaded not guilty. Taylor\u2019s remains were discovered in Manorville in 2003 and then additional remains along Ocean Parkway on Gilgo Beach in 2011. A hair found underneath Taylor\u2019s remains was linked to Heuermann, according to the bail application. Costilla\u2019s remains were found in North Sea in 1993 by two hunters who were in the woods, according to the bail application. \u201cDefendant Heuermann is the individual who murdered, stripped, restrained, and transported the remains of Jessica Taylor and Sandra Costilla, as well as the Gilgo Four, until they were each discovered in 1993, 2003, 2010, and 2011,\u201d the bail application reads.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/01/15/us/gilgo-beach-murder-case-timeline/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/07/2024", "section": "us"}}

{"id": "2024_06_06_tech_ftc-microsofts-ai-investigation", "text": "The Federal Trade Commission is investigating a recent Microsoft deal with artificial intelligence startup Inflection, according to a person familiar with the matter, as US antitrust regulators ramp up scrutiny of the red-hot AI industry. Microsoft announced in March that it had\u00a0hired Inflection\u2019s co-founders\u00a0and a number of its staff to lead its Copilot program, and Inflection said its AI model\u00a0would be hosted\u00a0on Microsoft\u2019s cloud platform. As part of that deal, Microsoft was\u00a0said to have paid Inflection $650 million. In its announcement at the time, Microsoft described the move as merely a hiring decision, not as an acquisition. The FTC probe into Microsoft concerns whether the company\u2019s investment in Inflection constituted an acquisition that Microsoft failed to disclose to the government, one of the people said. The investigation comes as antitrust officials at the FTC and the Justice Department are nearing a final agreement this week on how to jointly oversee AI giants such as Microsoft, Google, Nvidia, OpenAI and others, two people familiar with the matter told CNN. That agreement, which could be finalized within days, would appoint DOJ as the lead investigator of Nvidia, while the FTC would take responsibility for investigating Microsoft and OpenAI, the people said. DOJ will likely continue its role in overseeing Google, one of the people indicated. Any investigations would focus on whether the companies have used their dominant positions in the AI industry to harm competition through abusive and illegal behavior. The agreement shows enforcers are poised for a broad crackdown on some of the most well-known players in the AI sector, said Sarah Myers West, managing director of the AI Now Institute and a former AI advisor to the FTC. \u201cClearance processes like this are usually a key step before advancing an investigation,\u201d West said. \u201cThis is a clear sign they\u2019re moving quickly here.\u201d Microsoft declined to comment on the DOJ-FTC agreement but, in a statement, defended its partnership with Inflection. \u201cOur agreements with Inflection gave us the opportunity to recruit individuals at Inflection AI and build a team capable of accelerating Microsoft Copilot, while enabling Inflection to continue pursuing its independent business and ambition as an AI studio,\u201d a Microsoft spokesperson said, adding that the company is \u201cconfident\u201d it has complied with its reporting obligations. Inflection and Google didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment; Nvidia and OpenAI declined to comment. The DOJ and FTC declined to comment. The FTC-DOJ agreement was earlier reported by The New York Times; the FTC\u2019s Microsoft probe was earlier reported by The Wall Street Journal. FTC Chair Lina Khan has warned in op-eds and congressional testimony that, left unchecked, artificial intelligence could \u201cturbocharge\u201d fraud and scams. The agency has published numerous reminders and warnings that businesses can be held liable for making misleading claims about their AI tools or for covertly using consumer data to train AI models. The FTC is currently investigating Reddit\u2019s AI content licensing practices, and is separately investigating OpenAI for possible violations of consumer protection law. The US agencies\u2019 division-of-labor agreement opens the door to more intensive probes of a sector that has energized investors, enthralled consumers and raised alarm bells among critics who say AI urgently needs regulation to forestall widespread job displacement, discrimination and fraud. Specifically, it carves out roles for the FTC and DOJ to review whether tech giants and AI companies are behaving in anticompetitive ways. And it highlights how enforcers are increasingly trying to bring existing laws to bear on the industry as prospects for new US laws governing AI have dimmed. The United States is widely viewed as a laggard on AI regulation as others such as the European Union have leapfrogged it with tough rules about how the technology can be used in high-risk contexts. The EU AI Act, for example, outlaws social scoring systems powered by AI and any biometric-based tools used to guess a person\u2019s race, political leanings or sexual orientation. It also bans the use of AI to interpret the emotions of people in schools and workplaces, as well as some types of automated profiling intended to predict a person\u2019s likelihood of committing future crimes. For years, technology critics and regulators have worried that major tech companies may be monopolizing entire sectors of the economy. That has led to high-profile US government antitrust suits targeting Amazon, Apple, Google, Meta and Microsoft. Some fear that tech companies could abuse their powerful roles in business and society to extend their dominance into the fast-growing field of generative AI, which exploded onto the scene in 2022 when OpenAI released ChatGPT. Nvidia\u2019s soaring stock prices have served as a barometer of the AI frenzy, underscoring the company\u2019s position as a leading supplier of computing chips necessary for training advanced AI models. On Wednesday, Nvidia became the second-largest publicly traded company in the United States, ending the day with a market capitalization of more than $3 trillion and edging out Apple. \u201cAI relies on massive amounts of data and computing power, which can give already-dominant firms a substantial advantage,\u201d DOJ antitrust chief Jonathan Kanter said last week\u00a0in a speech at Stanford University, adding that Americans\u2019 reliance on just a handful of technology giants could allow them to \u201ccontrol these new markets.\u201d One way for tech giants to wield anticompetitive influence in the AI sector, critics\u00a0say, is through exclusive partnerships with AI startups. The agreements can potentially \u201clock in\u201d AI developers as customers of large cloud computing services and give the tech giants significant stakes or influence over the development of AI. Those types of deals, including Microsoft\u2019s relationship with OpenAI, are the subject of an ongoing study by the FTC announced in January. The DOJ has also become increasingly vocal on AI issues. In 2022, the agency\u2019s antitrust division hired Susan Athey, a Stanford University professor and AI expert, to be its chief economist. In looking at competition in the AI industry, antitrust enforcers should take lessons on how technology giants have behaved anticompetitively in the past, Athey told CNN at a recent event in Washington hosted by Bloomberg News. That could include gatekeeping or bottlenecking tactics, making it harder for consumers or customers to switch providers, or becoming the biggest buyer of key supplies \u2014 such as AI chips, for example \u2014 and denying those necessary supplies to competing rivals. \u201cWe should look back to historical analogues and see where sources of market power have been and how people have preserved them, and those are the kinds of tactics we might worry about going forward,\u201d Athey said. That the DOJ is picking up oversight of Nvidia from the FTC is particularly notable, West told CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s possible that means criminal penalties are now on the table, because that\u2019s one of the tools DOJ uniquely carries.\u201d This story has been updated with additional context and developments.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/06/tech/ftc-microsofts-ai-investigation/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/07/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_05_us_atlanta-water-service-restoration-wednesday", "text": "Crews in Atlanta have completed repairs to a key water main whose break, among others, contributed to a huge swath of the city spending days without safe drinking water \u2013 though a boil advisory remains in effect for many homes and businesses \u201cout of an abundance of caution,\u201d officials said Wednesday morning. Water service is \u201cslowly being brought back online to allow system pressures to rebuild,\u201d they said in a news release, following a vast, sometimes intermittent breakdown that began Friday and highlighted the decaying infrastructure criss-crossing a major Southern hub and many other major American cities. \u201cThe past few days were a call to action for all of us,\u201d Mayor Andre Dickens said at a Wednesday morning news conference. \u201cEvery city in America has aging infrastructure, and we will rise to meet this moment to ensure that residents and businesses alike have reliable access to water.\u201d A boil water advisory is still in place Wednesday for a portion of Atlanta from downtown to Midtown and across several eastern Atlanta neighborhoods after crews completed repairs to the broken water main at 11th and West Peachtree streets in Midtown, restoring water to nearby customers. The state Environmental Protection Division will notify the city when the advisory can be lifted \u2013 hopefully within 18 hours, the commissioner of the Department of Watershed Management said during the 10 a.m. news conference. That timeline is based on a \u201cincubation\u201d period, Commissioner Al Wiggins Jr. said. \u201cWe cannot rush that timeframe, nor do we want to. We want to ensure that we provide safe drinking water to our residents.\u201d Dickens thanked residents for their patience, acknowledging the \u201cdisruption wasn\u2019t easy for you.\u201d \u201cWe are happy to be on the other side of it,\u201d Dickens said, even as the boil advisory remained in place for tens of thousands. \u201cThat said, I will continue to be out and about this week, continuing to do wellness checks on our senior facilities, as well as speaking with our small business that may have been impacted by this situation,\u201d added Dickens, who has been criticized as slow to respond publicly to the crisis and his administration slammed as ineffective early on in communicating updates. The mayor reiterated the city is developing a $5 million fund to assist affected businesses and a plan to enact recommendations made by the US Army Corps of Engineers, which is helping evaluate Atlanta\u2019s water infrastructure to tackle any vulnerabilities. Wiggins acknowledged the city \u201cwill have more water main breaks,\u201d but said the crisis that unfolded in recent days derived from a \u201cunique set of circumstances.\u201d Indeed, no sooner had the city announced the repair in Midtown than its Department of Watershed Management announced another \u201cinterruption of water service\u201d to the north, on Piedmont Road. Crews had to turn off a 12-inch water main to make repairs, the department said on X, noting the outage \u201cis affecting one apartment complex, and one hydrant.\u201d \u2018Our infrastructure is crumbling\u2019 The city\u2019s water difficulties began midday Friday, when the first two of a series of water main breaks emerged along two pipes that Dickens said were about a century old \u2013 one 36 inches, the other 48 inches. One of the failed pipes was installed in 1910, while another dated to 1930, he told CNN on Monday. Dickens on Saturday declared a state of emergency as a string of breaks left parts of the city without water or under boil advisories and caused significant disruptions to medical and educational facilities in the city. Emory University Hospital Midtown began diverting ambulances from its emergency department and transferred dialysis patients to other hospitals \u2013 though normal operations resumed Sunday. Atlanta Public Schools also canceled many of its summer programs on Monday and Tuesday, saying they would resume once water service returned. Repairs on a break near downtown were finished Saturday, allowing the city to lift a far broader boil water advisory that had been in effect in the area since Friday. \u201cWhat we have found, in digging and digging and digging and looking at pipes, we are repairing pipes from 1920s, 1930s, 1940s, and our infrastructure is crumbling,\u201d Atlanta Chief Operating Officer LaChandra Burks said at a Monday afternoon city council meeting. The US Army Corps of Engineers arrived in the city Tuesday to help \u201cdevelop a plan to assess and evaluate our aging infrastructure,\u201d Dickens said. But while improving the city\u2019s infrastructure will help make repairs faster, Burks noted, it will not prevent future breaks. Atlanta\u2019s woes are part of a larger issue of aging infrastructure throughout Canada and the US, where more than 30% of water mains are over 50 years old, according to a December 2023 study from Utah State University. Failing water mains are on average 53 years old, the study noted. In the US and Canada, around\u00a0260,000 water main breaks\u00a0happen each year, costing about $2.6 billion each year, according to the study. \u2018I wish we had done a better job\u2019 Dickens conceded again Wednesday morning his administration had fallen short early in the crisis on clear and timely communication \u2013\u00a0a response to critics who\u2019ve said the mayor could have responded more effectively Friday. \u201cI wish we had done a better job of communicating from Friday night on into Saturday morning,\u201d said Dickens, who\u2019s up for reelection next year. Initially on Friday, the water main breaks appeared to be a \u201croutine problem,\u201d the mayor said \u2013 the latest of about 500 breaks or leaks over the past year. But each time one fix was in place, another leak would pop up, he said. The city, Dickens said, was waiting to announce the issue as a whole had been resolved. Officials instead should have communicated those \u201cfalse starts\u201d and \u201csetbacks\u201d in real time, he said, adding it was a lesson his administration has learned. \u201cWe won\u2019t learn it again,\u201d he said. \u201cWe got it now.\u201d The mayor also rebutted criticism of a trip he took Friday to Memphis, Tennessee, as the crisis began to unfold. Officials in his administration and scores of Watershed Management employees were working to address the problem at the time, he said. The severity of the problem was not apparent to officials when the mayor left for Memphis, a city spokesperson noted earlier this week, and Dickens was gone for less than 24 hours, the mayor has said. \u201cWhen (I) go away from town, you still have (chief operating officer), deputy (chief operating officer), you still have a commissioner, you also have almost a thousand workers in the Watershed Management Department, you have teams of people,\u201d he said, adding he\u2019d stayed in touch with city officials by phone and virtual meetings during his trip. \u201cIf the mayor of Atlanta can\u2019t leave for 24 hours at any time, that\u2019s a concern,\u201d Dickens said. \u201cWe all can Monday morning quarterback; today, we\u2019re here about the good news that water is running.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/05/us/atlanta-water-service-restoration-wednesday/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/07/2024", "section": "us"}}

The entire 700-foot wide channel is expected to reopen between Saturday and Monday \u2013 a milestone made possible now that the last piece of steel bridge blocking the channel has been removed, according to Unified Command, a group of agencies that responded to the disaster on March 26, after a 213-million pound cargo ship lost power and crashed into one of the bridge\u2019s support columns. Six construction workers were killed. Clearing the final piece of bridge truss \u2013 a structure of interconnected concrete, cables and steel rebar \u2013 was completed earlier this week using concrete breakers, torches and underwater surveys, Unified Command said. Though crews were able to clear a limited, 400-foot avenue for vessels to pass through last month, the complete reopening of the channel will usher a return to full operations at the port \u2013 an essential international cargo destination and employer of thousands of local workers. The vessel remained stuck in the waterway for nearly two months as crews worked to remove a piece of the bridge pinning down its bow, finally hauling the ship away on May 20. The removal of the ship allowed for the temporary 400-foot channel to be opened. And for the first time in two months, cruise ships set sail from the Port of Baltimore on May 27. Multiple agencies have launched investigations to determine who might be responsible for the catastrophe, including the FBI, the US Coast Guard and the National Transportation Safety Board. Meanwhile, Baltimore officials have been working with the federal government to revive the port\u2019s economy, which had supported tens of thousands of jobs before the disaster. \u201cIn 2023, the Port ranked first in the nation in handling automobiles, light trucks, farm and construction machinery, as well as imported sugar and gypsum,\u201d the Maryland government\u2019s website states.

{"id": "2024_06_05_us_negro-league-baseball-willie-mays", "text": "Baseball legend Willie Mays never expected to get 10 more career hits five decades\u00a0after his last game.\u00a0But that\u2019s exactly what happened last week when\u00a0Major League Baseball integrated Negro League statistics into its record books. \u201cSo that\u2019s a very good thing,\u201d Mays told CNN in a statement Wednesday.\u00a0\u201cIt must be some kind of record for a 93-year-old.\u201d The Hall of Famer is considered one of the greatest baseball players of all time. Over the course of his career, he hit 660 home runs and had 3,283 hits in 23 MLB seasons, mostly with the New York Giants. He\u2019s also remembered for making \u201cThe Catch,\u201d an over-the-shoulder grab in Game 1 of the 1954 World Series \u2013 one of the best defensive plays of all time. \u201cThe Say Hey Kid\u201d had something to say about his experience as a teenager with the Negro American League\u2019s Birmingham Black Barons. His 10 hits with the Barons now count, bumping his career hit total to 3,293 \u2013 good for 12th on the all-time hits list. \u201cI was still in high school,\u201d when he joined the team in 1948, Mays told CNN. \u201cOur school did not have a baseball team. I played football and basketball, but I loved baseball.\u00a0So my dad let me to play \u2026 but ONLY if I stayed in school. He wanted me to graduate. I played with the team on weekends until school was out for the summer.\u201d \u201cI thought that was IT; that was the top of the world. Man, I was so proud to play with those guys,\u201d Mays said in the statement. The New York Giants purchased Mays\u2019 contract in 1950 \u2013 three years after Jackie Robinson broke baseball\u2019s color barrier \u2013 and the next season his stellar MLB career began. As a result of the MLB incorporating the statistics of former\u00a0Negro Leagues players into its historical records on its website, legendary leaders in some categories like Babe Ruth and Ty Cobb have now been replaced in the record books by players who were not allowed to play on the same fields as them during segregation. Josh Gibson, one of the greatest sluggers in the history of the Negro Leagues, is now listed as MLB\u2019s all-time career leader in batting average at .372, moving ahead of Cobb at .367. The MLB website shows Gibson also overtaking Ruth in career slugging percentage. The MLB\u2019s action added over 2,300 Negro League players from 1920-1948 to its database. \u201cI\u2019m glad that all the guys who played are getting credit for their hits, because those pitchers were good,\u201d Mays said, mentioning Satchel Paige, considered one of baseball\u2019s greatest pitchers and who is now ranked third place all-time for earned run average in a single season with his performance in 1944 for the Kansas City Monarchs of the Negro American League. Mays called his statistical accomplishment at age 93 \u201camazing.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m very grateful to all the people who looked out for me back then, and to MLB for going back and making sure we got credit for those years,\u201d he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/05/us/negro-league-baseball-willie-mays/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/07/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_05_us_wisconsin-warden-prison-death-investigations", "text": "The warden and eight other staff members at a Wisconsin prison face charges in the death of two inmates in what a sheriff called a mockery of the state\u2019s obligation and vow to take good care of those in its custody. Dodge County Sheriff Dale Schmidt detailed to reporters on Wednesday what he called a litany of failure at Waupun Correctional Institution. He provided details of four inmate deaths since July 2023. Felony charges of misconduct in public office and abuse of residents of penal facilities were filed in two deaths. \u201cAs the sheriff, I am angered at how these men were treated and how they died,\u201d said Schmidt. Warden Randall Hepp was jailed just hours before the news conference, according to the Associated Press. Hepp is charged with felony misconduct, according to Schmidt, in connection with the death of a mentally troubled inmate who died of malnutrition and dehydration. \u201cWe are operating the oldest prison in Wisconsin in a dangerous manner,\u201d said Schmidt, saying the care of inmates and oversight were shoddy. \u201cThere needs to be responsibility from the top down.\u201d  He urged better staffing, training and accountability across the prison system. The sheriff, who appeared with the district attorney, said Waupun staff in various cases failed to provide adequate checks, medication, food and water. Some records were allegedly falsified. Prosecutors said the deaths amounted to neglect rather than homicidal intent. Those arrested were Hepp, six correctional workers and two nurses. Most were arrested in one death, rather than both. Schmidt said the nine accused turned themselves in Wednesday morning and made their first court appearance in the afternoon. They pleaded not guilty, authorities said. Jail Sgt. Chad Riter told the Associated Press that Hepp\u2019s attorney had visited him, but Riter did not know the attorney\u2019s name. Riter didn\u2019t immediately return a follow-up message inquiring if a reporter could speak with Hepp. Four inmates have died at Waupun since June 2023, when Dean Hoffman killed himself in solitary confinement, according to the AP. Hoffman\u2019s daughter filed a federal lawsuit in February alleging that prison officials failed to provide her father with adequate mental health care and medications. No criminal charges were filed in that case. Tyshun Lemons and Cameron Williams were found dead at the facility in October, said the AP. Dodge County Medical Examiner PJ Schoebel said\u00a0Lemons overdosed on acetyl fentanyl, a potent opioid painkiller, and Williams died of a stroke. No charges were filed over Lemons\u2019 death but several prison employees were arrested in Williams\u2019 death, authorities said Wednesday. Schmidt said Williams had labored breathing and lay on a bed with no movement. Staff yelled and banged on his door \u201cwithout a response and no action was taken.\u201d Numerous rounds by staff were skipped or done ineffectively, the sheriff said. A nurse and correctional officer finally decided Williams\u2019 cell needed to be entered. But an incoming nurse decided there was no medical need for a check, authorities said, adding the inmate was likely under dire medical stress at the time of that decision. He was dead for more than 12 hours before staff learned that, Schmidt said. Additional charges were brought in the case of Donald Maier, who was found dead\u00a0at the prison in February. Authorities said the manner of death was homicide and he died because of maltreatment by staff. Hepp is charged in that case. Maier was in a cell with garbage on the floor and sometimes he went without water because it was cut off at various points for varying reasons, the sheriff said. The staff failed to feed him nine of 12 meals when he was housed in restrictive housing, the sheriff said. Maier should have been closely monitored and no medical professional made contact except through a cell door. Schmidt listed medical conditions, dehydration and failure to thrive due to malnutrition as the causes of death. Dodge County District Attorney Andrea Will said the maximum sentence for a conviction would be 18 months confinement and 24 months of extended supervision. The state Department of Corrections\u00a0imposed a lockdown\u00a0at Waupun, and at prisons in Green Bay and Stanley last year due to a shortage of guards, according to AP. Waupun inmates\u00a0filed a federal lawsuit\u00a0in October alleging the conditions amounted to cruel and unusual punishment. That lawsuit is still pending. Stanley resumed normal operations in November. Movement restrictions have eased at Waupun and Green Bay, but as of the department\u2019s latest update in April, in-person visitation had not resumed at Waupun and recreation time was still limited, reported the Associated Press. Prisoners were being allowed to make phone calls and text using electronic tablets, however. Waupun\u2019s problems don\u2019t end there. Gov. Tony Evers\u2019 office said in March that federal investigators were\u00a0looking into a suspected smuggling ring\u00a0involving prison employees. Hepp announced on May 28 that he\u00a0planned to retire\u00a0at the end of June and that Deputy Warden Brad Mlodzik would take over, says the AP. The Department of Corrections (DOC) and federal authorities are doing their own investigations into conditions at Waupun. Sheriff Schmidt said the federal investigation is not looking specifically into the deaths of the inmates. \u201cAs a result of the DOC\u2019s internal investigations at WCI that initially began in March 2023, over 20 individuals remain under internal investigation,\u201d the Department of Corrections said in\u00a0its own statement. \u201cAn additional nine individuals, against whom criminal charges have not been filed at this time, are no longer employed at the department.\u201d The DOC said an additional eight people are on administrative leave in connection with the investigations.

{"id": "2024_06_06_us_wwii-vet-death-d-day-ceremony", "text": "Robert Persichitti, a 102-year-old World War II US Navy veteran, died last week while on his way to France to commemorate the 80th anniversary of D-Day, according to Honor Flight Rochester, a veteran\u2019s organization. Persichitti\u00a0was\u00a0a \u201cwonderful, pleasant, humble\u00a0guy,\u201d who was \u201ceasy know, easy to talk to,\u201d\u00a0said\u00a0Honor Flight Rochester President and CEO\u00a0Richard Stewart, who told CNN he learned of his friend\u2019s death last Friday. \u201cWe miss him,\u201d said Stewart. While Persichitti passed away bound for Normandy \u2014 where the Allied forces\u2019 landing on June 6, 1944, laid the foundation for the defeat of Nazi Germany \u2014 he served in the Pacific as a radioman aboard the USS Eldorado, Stewart said. His tour of duty included Iwo Jima, Okinawa and Guam, according to Stewart and the New York State Senate Veterans Hall of Fame, into which Persichitti was inducted in 2020. Persichitti fell ill\u00a0last week\u00a0during a stop in Germany while headed for Normandy,\u00a0Al DeCarlo, a friend who was traveling with Persichitti, told\u00a0CNN affiliate WHAM.\u00a0Persichitti was airlifted to the hospital\u00a0and\u00a0died soon after, DeCarlo said. \u201cThe doctor was with him. He was not alone, he was at peace and he was comfortable,\u201d DeCarlo said. \u201cShe put his favorite singer, Frank Sinatra, on her phone and he peacefully left us.\u201d Persichitti had heart problems in the past, \u201cbut for 102, I would say he was in superb health,\u201d\u00a0Stewart told CNN. Persichitti was born in a coal mining town outside Pittsburgh, Stewart said, describing his friend Bob\u2019s \u201chumble, poor beginnings.\u201d After the war, Persichitti worked as a carpentry teacher in Rochester, New York, according to the Veterans Hall of Fame, and in 1972 received a degree from SUNY Buffalo. Persichitti enjoyed traveling and speaking with younger generations about his experiences, often visiting schools to talk with students about World War II, his friend, Pastor William Leone, told WHAM. \u201cIt was a privilege to know him, and I will miss him,\u201d Leone told the station. Persichitti was one of the few surviving Americans who served in World War II, a population that is rapidly waning. As of 2023, just 119,550 of the 16.4 million who served \u2013 less than one percent \u2013 were still alive, according to the National WWII Museum in New Orleans. At that time, about 131 World War II veterans were dying each day, the museum said. US President Joe Biden underscored this point Thursday, telling those gathered at this year\u2019s D-Day commemoration in Normandy that it may be the last to involve living veterans. That fact, he said, should push Americans to continue the fight against tyranny. \u201cWe\u2019re not far off from the time when the last living voices of those who fought and bled on D-Day will no longer be with us,\u201d Biden said. \u201cSo we have a special obligation. We cannot let what happened here be lost in the silence of the years to come.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/06/us/wwii-vet-death-d-day-ceremony/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/07/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_06_business_shoppers-are-hyper-focused-on-value-that-doesnt-mean-only-buying-the-cheapest-option", "text": "American households want the biggest bang for their buck right now when they pull their wallets out to shop. That doesn\u2019t mean they want something cheap all the time. They\u2019ve been paying more for goods and services for a while because of higher inflation that stubbornly stuck around. What\u2019s also occurred concurrently is that higher interest rates have made it more expensive for shoppers to borrow money \u2013 on credit cards for example \u2013 for buying things or paying off necessities such as monthly bills. But even as consumers push through these pressures, they\u2019re still shopping, and seeking deals. Bargain retailers like Walmart and Costco have benefitted, as shown by the retailing industry\u2019s recent slew of first-quarter earnings releases. Discount behemoth\u00a0Walmart\u2019s business was buzzing as thrifty shoppers flocked to its big-box stores last quarter to bag deals on groceries and everyday necessities like shampoo, toothpaste, paper towels and toilet paper. Sales at its stores open at least a year increased 3.8% in the quarter from the same time last year. Other discount purveyors such as Ollie\u2019s Bargain Outlet and Costco also enjoyed a jump in their same-store sales in their latest quarter. At the same time, there\u2019s a different kind of deal-seeking happening, too. Perhaps a bit counterintuitively, a bunch of stores that are known for more expensive products that aren\u2019t exactly necessities are also seeing a boom. Which means that Americans are still spending, but selectively, and that \u201cvalue shopping\u201d means different things to different people. It doesn\u2019t necessarily mean cheap. \u201cValue is a watchword for consumers,\u201d said Neil Saunders, retail industry analyst and managing director with GlobalData Retail, in an interview with CNN. \u201cBut value is not just about finding the lowest price. It\u2019s about finding products that people really want and that they will get use out of,\u201d Saunders said. \u201cSo gone are the random impulse buys of things that will be placed at the back of the closet and forgotten, and in are the more considered purchases.\u201d To his point, shoppers are willing to dig deeper if they they feel like they\u2019re getting quality products that are on trend, feel good, and last for a long time, even if it means spending a little bit more. Abercrombie & Fitch enjoyed a stunning 21% surge in its same-store sales last quarter because it hit the fashion trends that its core younger shoppers are craving, such as low-rise baggy jeans and well-tailored wide-legged pants, and then some. The retailer, which also owns the Gen Z-favored Hollister brand, is pushing ahead for the first time into newer lucrative areas such as wedding items like bridal dresses and even pajamas as it strives to become a one-stop destination for its clientele. Williams-Sonoma, which sells pricey kitchenware such as Le Creuset dutch ovens for a few hundred dollars each and $4,000 automatic espresso machines, also reported improving sales in the first quarter. (It also owns upscale home goods and furniture brands Pottery Barn and West Elm.) \u201cOur recent launches with partners, such as LoveShackFancy and Lilly Pulitzer, have driven sales and attracted new customers by tapping into relevant fashion and home decor trends,\u201d Laura Alber, Williams-Sonoma CEO, told analysts during the company\u2019s most recent earnings call. Gap Inc., whose brands include Gap, Old Navy, Banana Republic and Athleta, pulled out same-store sales increases for the first time in years in its most recent quarter across all four brands under new CEO Richard Dickson, who came on board last August. Dickson\u2019s focus has been on getting back to the basics with quality products. This strategy included its newest summer linen clothing collection and surprise marketing moves involving celebrity collaborations. A Gap white shirt dress for Anne Hathaway appeared to thrill shoppers. The dress became a viral moment on social media for the retailer, which Gap quickly seized upon by releasing a limited pre-order for the dress to its shoppers priced at $158. It sold out in under three hours. Shoppers are homing in not just on prices but on the benefits that they hope to receive from products for the price that they\u2019re paying for it, Zak Stambor, senior analyst, retail and ecommerce, with market research firm eMarketer told CNN.   \u201cConsumers are thinking long and hard about where and when they are spending,\u201d Stambor said. \u201cA sizable segment of them are focused on value, however, that doesn\u2019t directly correlate to a low price. Shoppers are willing to spend if they see value in an on-trend, well-made dress from Abercrombie \u2013 or a healthy salad from Sweetgreen.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/06/business/shoppers-are-hyper-focused-on-value-that-doesnt-mean-only-buying-the-cheapest-option/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/07/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_06_media_washington-post-will-lewis-npr", "text": "William Lewis, the new publisher and chief executive of The Washington Post, reportedly tried to kill\u00a0a\u00a0story\u00a0about his alleged involvement in a UK phone hacking scandal coverup, offering an NPR reporter an interview in exchange for squashing the\u00a0forthcoming article. The decade-old UK scandal that engulfed right-wing media mogul Rupert Murdoch\u2019s \u201cNews of the World\u201d tabloid, was revived in recent years in a\u00a0new lawsuit filed\u00a0by Prince Harry and other notable figures including Guy Ritchie and Hugh Grant. At the time, Lewis was a senior executive at Murdoch\u2019s News Corporation. He has repeatedly denied wrongdoing. On Thursday, veteran NPR media reporter David Folkenflik\u00a0reported\u00a0that in December, Lewis, who had just been named publisher and chief executive of the Post, offered him an exclusive interview in exchange for his willingness not to publish a story on Lewis\u2019 potential involvement in the scandal. \u201cIn several conversations, Lewis repeatedly \u2014 and heatedly \u2014offered to give me an exclusive interview about the\u00a0Post\u2019s future, as long as I dropped the story about the allegations,\u201d Folkenflik reported. \u201cAt that time, the same spokesperson, who works directly for Lewis from the U.K. and has advised him since his days at the\u00a0Wall Street Journal \u2014\u00a0confirmed to me that an explicit offer was on the table: drop the story, get the interview.\u201d The Washington Post did not immediately respond to a CNN request for comment. Despite Lewis\u2019 attempt to squash the story, NPR\u00a0published the article\u00a0in late December under the headline \u201cNew \u2018Washington Post\u2019 CEO accused of Murdoch tabloid hacking cover-up,\u201d featuring a 2011 photo of Lewis with Murdoch. The revelation came a day after The New York Times reported that Lewis had\u00a0clashed in recent weeks\u00a0with former Post executive editor Sally Buzbee over a decision to publish an article in May about the hacking scandal that named Lewis. According to the Times, Lewis told Buzbee the story didn\u2019t warrant coverage in the newspaper. \u201cWhen Ms. Buzbee said The Post would publish an article anyway, he said her decision represented a lapse in judgment and abruptly ended the conversation,\u201d\u00a0the Times reported. A person with knowledge of Buzbee\u2019s account confirmed the conversation to CNN, adding that the then-executive editor felt pressured by Lewis over the story. Days later, when the judge in the UK case allowed allegations about Lewis to be included in the lawsuit, the Post\u00a0published another story\u00a0naming him. On Sunday night, the Post\u00a0abruptly announced\u00a0Buzbee was departing the newspaper and was being immediately replaced by former Wall Street Journal editor Matt Murray in a seismic shakeup at the outlet. \u201cSally is an incredible leader and a supremely talented media executive who will be sorely missed,\u201d Lewis said in\u00a0a statement.\u00a0\u201cI wish her all the best going forward.\u201d Notably, Buzbee did not offer a farewell note to staff. Staffers at the Post who spoke to CNN on condition of anonymity said that newsroom morale had plummeted in the wake Buzbee\u2019s departure and published reports about Lewis. The news comes two weeks after Lewis\u00a0unveiled a new plan\u00a0to turn around the beleaguered newspaper, telling staff the company had lost $77 million over the last year and seen a dramatic 50% plunge in audience traffic since 2020. \u201cTo speak candidly,\u201d Lewis told staffers, \u201cwe are in a hole, and we have been for some time.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/06/media/washington-post-will-lewis-npr/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/07/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_06_media_israel-al-jazeera-ban-media-law", "text": "The Israeli government is seeking to\u00a0extend\u00a0its\u00a0controversial\u00a0ban on the Al Jazeera\u00a0news\u00a0network in the country, after a\u00a0court upheld the ban but shortened it by 10 days. In May, Israel banned the\u00a0Qatari-based\u00a0news network from operating in the country for 45 days under a\u00a0sweeping\u00a0new wartime law that allows the Israeli government to ban\u00a0foreign\u00a0media organizations it deems \u201charmful\u201d to the\u00a0nation\u2019s\u00a0security.\u00a0Al Jazeera\u00a0condemned the move\u00a0as a \u201cdark day for democracy\u201d that sets a concerning precedent for other international media outlets operating in Israel. While the ban is not permanent and only valid during the declared period of war, the Israeli government can continue to\u00a0extend the closure for additional 45-day\u00a0periods. On Tuesday, a Tel Aviv District Court ruled that the ban on Al Jazeera could stand but was to be shortened to 35 days, meaning it will expire on Sunday. Al Jazeera said it was notified by the Israeli Ministry of Communications\u00a0on Wednesday\u00a0that it intends to request that the government and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu approve another 45-day ban. Israel has claimed that Al Jazeera \u201charms Israeli security,\u201d and has a \u201cclose connection\u201d with Hamas, the militant group it is waging war against in Gaza. \u201cAl Jazeera reporters harmed Israel\u2019s security and incited against IDF soldiers. It is time to expel the mouthpiece of Hamas from our country,\u201d Netanyahu\u00a0said\u00a0last month. According to Reuters, a Tel Aviv District Court\u00a0judge\u00a0said Tuesday he had been presented evidence of the government\u2019s claims, but\u00a0the\u00a0evidence was not made public. Walid Omary, Al Jazeera\u2019s Jerusalem bureau chief,\u00a0told CNN he had \u201ccynicism, sarcasm and contempt for the court\u2019s decision, and we reject all accusations and excuses.\u201d Last month, Israeli authorities raided\u00a0Al Jazeera offices in Jerusalem, seizing its\u00a0broadcast equipment\u00a0and\u00a0shutting down its operations.\u00a0The network\u2019s\u00a0channels were\u00a0removed from\u00a0Israeli cable and satellite providers and its website was\u00a0blocked\u00a0from within Israel. Weeks later, Israeli authorities also\u00a0seized equipment\u00a0from the Associated Press\u00a0that was used to broadcast the Gaza skyline, claiming the broadcast was\u00a0being provided to\u00a0Al Jazeera and endangered Israeli troops.\u00a0The move\u00a0sparked\u00a0swift condemnation, including from\u00a0press groups,\u00a0Israeli opposition leaders and the US government. Hours after the seizure, Israeli authorities returned AP\u2019s equipment and the\u00a0live\u00a0shot was back on air. Al Jazeera, one of the only networks to have a live, consistent presence from within the blockaded Gaza strip, has denied Israel\u2019s claims\u00a0that it is a threat to the country\u2019s security, calling the allegations \u201cdangerous and ridiculous.\u201d At least six of its staff members have been killed in Gaza since the war began. Earlier this week, the Israeli Supreme Court also heard arguments brought against the law by an Israeli civil rights association, which said among other arguments, that the law infringes on the right to freedom of expression, information and press in Israel. During the hearing, Justice Yitzhak Amit, the head of the panel of judges, said that \u201cthere is no doubt that there is a violation of freedom of expression here,\u201d\u00a0according to\u00a0the Israeli newspaper Haaretz. It\u2019s not clear when the high court will issue its ruling on the law.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/06/media/israel-al-jazeera-ban-media-law/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/07/2024", "section": "us"}}

{"id": "2024_06_06_politics_austin-cnn-interview", "text": "Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin\u00a0told CNN\u00a0Thursday he believed the new policy allowing the Ukrainian military\u00a0to carry out limited strikes inside Russia with US munitions\u00a0will\u00a0be \u201cvery, very helpful to the Ukrainians going forward.\u201d \u201c[W]hat we have done is provided Ukraine the ability to counter fire, to fire back at those Russian troops that are firing at them and to be able to take out their artillery batteries as they\u2019re firing at the Ukrainians,\u201d Austin told CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer\u00a0on\u00a0\u201cThe Situation Room.\u201d Austin spoke with CNN from Normandy, France, where he has joined other world leaders for the 80th\u00a0anniversary of D-Day, including President Joe Biden, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. CQ Brown, and more than 20 other heads of state including French President Emmanuel Macron, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Austin\u2019s comments came days after Biden\u00a0gave Ukraine permission to strike inside Russian territory \u2014 though limiting it to targets close to the border of Kharkiv\u00a0where Russian forces have been concentrating their efforts \u2014 with US munitions. Asked about waning support in the US, Austin said he believed there has been \u201cstrong support for Ukraine\u201d among both political parties, despite how long it took for Congress to pass its security aid package for the embattled country\u00a0and emphasized that\u00a0Russian President Vladimir\u00a0Putin likely won\u2019t stop at Ukraine. \u201cI was confident that the right thing was going to happen, because anytime you see that type of support on both sides of the aisle for a cause, Congress will find a way to get things done. Which is what they did in this case, because it\u2019s the right thing to do,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd Ukraine matters \u2026 not just for Ukraine\u2019s purposes alone, not for Europe alone \u2014\u00a0it matters for to us and it matters to the entire globe.\u00a0So, we have to make sure that Putin doesn\u2019t have the ability to trample Ukraine because as the president said there\u2019s a good chance, almost certain, that Putin won\u2019t stop there. He will continue to move forward in other acts of aggression.\u201d On Thursday, Biden gave a blistering critique of Putin, telling ABC News\u2019 David Muir that Putin is \u201cnot a decent man, he\u2019s a dictator.\u201d Standing in the Normandy American Cemetery, Austin told CNN he believed the \u201cnumber of leaders who lean towards autocracy\u201d around the globe pose the greatest threat to the US, and that the sacrifice so many gave to \u201censure our freedom\u201d should never be forgotten. \u201c[I]t\u2019s those sacrifices that really gave birth to the rules-based international order that served us so well for so many years,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we have to protect that \u2014\u00a0we have to work hard to protect it. Democracy is worth having, but it\u2019s something that you have to work on, you have to fight for.\u201d \u2018Hamas does not equal the Palestinian people\u2019 Austin declined on Thursday to comment on an overnight Israeli strike in Gaza on a UN-run school that was housing displaced people, which killed at least 45 people, saying he would \u201cleave it to Israel to talk about what happened in that strike.\u201d He emphasized though that Israel must take more actions to avoid civilian casualties, and that accomplishing their military objectives and protecting civilians should not be mutually exclusive. \u201cI think the way you ensure long-term success is by making sure that you take the civilian population, eventually strip them away from Hamas, and demonstrate that Hamas does not equal the Palestinian people,\u201d Austin said. Asked if he believes Israel has committed war crimes in its operations against Hamas in Gaza, Austin echoed Biden\u2019s comments that it is \u201cuncertain\u201d and should be investigated, which he said Israel would be doing. \u201cThis is a professional force,\u201d he said, \u201cand we would expect they do the kinds of things that professional forces do, you know, make sure they\u2019re doing the right things to employ the weapons appropriately, and also if there are problems, investigate those problems and learn from that.\u201d So far, Austin said, the US has still not seen Israel begin a \u201cmajor movement into Rafah.\u201d US and China must \u2018continue to have a dialogue\u2019 Austin also spoke briefly on Thursday about challenges in the Indo-Pacific and his recent meeting with his Chinese counterpart, Adm. Dong Jun, in Singapore. He reiterated that it is important for the US and China to \u201ccontinue to have a dialogue\u201d and that he voiced concerns over what is happening in the region. Just two weeks ago, China launched military drills encircling Taiwan after the democratic island swore in a new president. \u201cI voiced my concerns about some of the things that we\u2019ve seen in the region, and we\u2019ll continue to do so going forward,\u201d Austin said. \u201cBut unless you\u2019re talking to each other, you don\u2019t have the ability to prevent miscalculations and address misperceptions. So I think this is a good first step, but there\u2019s a lot more that needs to be done in terms of engaging and in terms of moving things in the right direction.\u201d This story has been updated with\u00a0additional\u00a0details.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/06/politics/austin-cnn-interview/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/07/2024", "section": "us"}}

The public safety officer was injured after being shoved by protesters interfering with a transport vehicle, according to the university. The damage included \u201cextensive graffiti vandalism on the sandstone buildings and columns of the Main Quad,\u201d said an online statement to the Stanford community, adding that it conveyed \u201cvile and hateful sentiments that we condemn in the strongest terms.\u201d Stanford said the \u201carrested students will be immediately suspended and in case any of them are seniors, they will not be allowed to graduate.\u201d \u201cWe are appalled that our students chose to take this action and we will work with law enforcement to ensure that they face the full consequences allowed by law,\u201d the school said in a statement. \u201cWe have consistently emphasized the need for constructive engagement and peaceful protest when there is a disagreement in views. This was not peaceful protest and actions such as what occurred this morning have no place at Stanford.\u201d The university said the protesters \u201cunlawfully entered Building 10, which houses the offices of the president and provost.\u201d The university urged people to stay away from the Main Quad, in the heart of the California campus, and said no other campus operations were affected. About 10 students had been barricaded inside the building while dozens of others linked arms outside, according to the student newspaper, The Stanford Daily. It is the last day of spring classes, according to the university calendar. The university said law enforcement also removed an encampment at White Plaza that had \u201cviolated a number of university policies since its installation\u201d last month. \u201cThe situation on campus has now crossed the line from peaceful protest to actions that threaten the safety of our community,\u201d said the statement from Saller and Provost Jenny Martinez to the university community. \u201cThere continue to be many ways for members of our community to engage in the peaceful expression of diverse viewpoints on important global issues, in a manner consistent with our university policies,\u201d the statement said. Liberate Stanford had said in a statement earlier Wednesday that protesters barricaded in the president\u2019s office would not leave \u201cuntil Stanford Administration and the Stanford Board of Trustees meet our demands and take action to address their role in enabling and profiting from the ongoing genocide in Gaza.\u201d The group disavowed acts of vandalism carried out by some protesters, which include spray-painted messages and what appears to be fake blood spilled on the desk of the president. \u201cThe intentions of this movement are not to create unnecessary labor for service workers, and we refuse to have our uprising hijacked by unknown agitators,\u201d the group said in\u00a0a social media post. The post said the group of students and alumni entered and barricaded themselves in Saller\u2019s office at about 6 a.m. local time. The group accuses Stanford of being unwilling to engage with protestors and their demands, and using \u201cour tuition, our donations and our labor\u201d to \u201cfund apartheid and genocide,\u201d according to the social media post. US colleges have been using law enforcement \u2013 along with academic suspensions and expulsions\u00a0\u2013 t\ufeffo\u00a0quell student demonstrations since\u00a0Hamas\u2019 October attack on Israel,\u00a0in which more than 1,200 people were killed and around 240 were taken hostage. Israel\u2019s response in Gaza has further fueled deeply held views of students and faculty on all sides. This story has been updated with additional information.

Last month, an Oregon grand jury indicted Jesse Lee Calhoun, 39, on three counts of second-degree murder and three counts of abuse of a corpse in the second degree in the deaths of Charity Lynn Perry, 24, Bridget Leanne Webster, 31, and Joanna Speaks, 32, according to a news release from the district attorney. All three women were found dead \u201cunder suspicious circumstances\u201d on different days in April 2023, two of them in Portland and a third in neighboring Washington, according to Multnomah County District Attorney Mike Schmidt. Authorities have not provided information on how they died, and it\u2019s unclear how investigators linked Calhoun to the three deaths. CNN has reached out to the district attorney\u2019s office for additional information. \u201cMr. Calhoun adamantly denies the allegations against him,\u201d Cameron Taylor, Calhoun\u2019s attorney, told CNN in an emailed statement Thursday. Authorities in Oregon last year said they believe the deaths of Perry and Webster were connected to the deaths of two other Oregon women, Kristin Smith and Ashley Real, CNN previously reported. Authorities are \u201cstill very much investigating\u201d their deaths, Senior Deputy District Attorney Melissa Marrero said last month. Calhoun appeared in Multnomah County court after being transferred from Snake River Correctional Institution in eastern Oregon, where he was in custody on unrelated charges, according to previous CNN reporting. Calhoun\u2019s next court appearance is scheduled for July 19.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/06/us/oregon-man-murder-three-women/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/07/2024", "section": "us"}}
