{"id": "2024_05_29_politics_biden-pledge-progressives-supreme-court-vacancies", "text": "President\u00a0Joe\u00a0Biden promised Black voters Wednesday that he would appoint progressives to the US Supreme Court if elected to a second term, suggesting he expects vacancies on the high court over the next four years. \u201cThe next president, they\u2019re going to be able to appoint a couple justices, and I\u2019ll be damned \u2014 if in fact we\u2019re able to change some of the justices when they retire and put in really progressive judges like we\u2019ve always had, tell me that won\u2019t change your life,\u201d he said during a campaign rally in Philadelphia. It was as explicit a warning as Biden could offer about the stakes of the upcoming election, and a clear reminder that some of the nine justices have entered their seventies. Clarence Thomas is 75 and Samuel Alito is 74; both are conservative and appointed by Republican\u00a0presidents.\u00a0Sonia Sotomayor,\u00a0a liberal\u00a0who was nominated by President Barack Obama, turns 70 next month. Retirements of any or all of those justices could provide a key opportunity for either Biden, who has named one\u00a0justice\u00a0to the Supreme Court, or his Republican rival Donald Trump, who named three during his four-year term. The ideological makeup of the court has emerged as one of the defining facets of American political power. The current conservative majority \u2014 made possible by Trump\u2019s three appointments \u2014 overturned in 2022 the nationwide right to abortion enshrined in Roe v. Wade, opening a major front in this year\u2019s election. Gun ownership rights, voter protections and regulatory issues have also come before the panel. Justices rarely signal their intentions to retire before announcing them through the court. And presidents have traditionally tread carefully when speaking publicly about the prospect of retirement-age justices stepping down. At the start of his term, Biden made clear to aides there would be no efforts to pressure Justice Stephen Breyer, then age 83, into retirement, even though many Democrats were eager for the political opening such a vacancy would provide. The hands-off approach was rooted in respect for the\u00a0justice,\u00a0whose confirmation Biden oversaw as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and out of fear an overt pressure campaign might backfire. Liberal groups not affiliated with the White House were more explicit in calls for Breyer to retire. Breyer announced his retirement in January 2022, allowing Biden to fulfill a campaign pledge to nominate a Black woman to the court, Ketanji Brown Jackson. Other presidents have adopted a somewhat similar approach. Trump, through his White House counsel Don McGahn, did not make explicit calls for Justice Anthony Kennedy to retire early in his term. Instead, he consulted the\u00a0justice\u00a0on lower court nominations as a way to cultivate a degree of comfort with the process. Obama is said to have danced around the retirement question with Ruth Bader Ginsburg at a lunch in 2013. Then the court\u2019s oldest member, she did not retire during Obama\u2019s term. She died while still on the bench in 2020, and Trump quickly nominated conservative Amy Coney Barrett to replace her. As he attempts a return to the White House, Trump has made his own\u00a0nominees\u00a0to the court a selling point, and promised additional conservative selections if he were to win. \u201cMany presidents never get the opportunity to appoint a Supreme Court justice. I had three. They are gold,\u201d he said at a 2023 speech at the Moms for Liberty summit. \u201cMaybe we\u2019ll get three or four more.

{"id": "2024_05_29_politics_takeaways-trump-jury-deliberations", "text": "The jury in Donald Trump\u2019s New York hush money trial finished its first day of deliberations Wednesday without reaching a verdict after meeting for more than four-and-a-half hours. Jurors will return on Thursday morning at 9:30 a.m. ET to resume deliberations, but the 12 men and women will also again hear from Judge Juan Merchan. Wednesday afternoon, the jury asked to hear a readback of four separate parts of witness testimony, including from former National Enquirer chief David Pecker and Trump\u2019s former fixer Michael Cohen. Jurors also want to re-hear Merchan\u2019s instructions on the law that he had given them earlier Wednesday morning. The jurors requested four pieces of testimony: Pecker\u2019s testimony about his phone conversation with Trump in June 2016, his testimony about not finalizing Trump\u2019s payment to AMI for Karen McDougal\u2019s life rights, his testimony about the August 2015 Trump Tower meeting, and Cohen\u2019s testimony about the Trump Tower meeting. The testimony the jurors are requesting relates to interactions Trump had directly with Pecker. The testimony from Cohen and Pecker about the 2015 meeting concerns the meeting where Pecker agreed to be the \u201ceyes and ears\u201d of the campaign, while Pecker testified in his call with Trump in June 2016 that he discussed the McDougal story and whether Trump should buy it. The jury will ultimately decide whether a former president is convicted of felony crimes for the first time in American history \u2013 at the same time that Trump is running against President Joe Biden for president this November. Judge\u2019s instructions The political implications of the case were not overtly at issue on Wednesday morning as Merchan spent an hour instructing the jury on the law. He explained the 34 felony counts against Trump for falsifying business records over the reimbursement to Cohen for hush money payments made to porn star Stormy Daniels before the 2016 election, going over the elements of the crime that jurors must decide prosecutors have proven beyond a reasonable doubt to return a guilty verdict. Merchan also reminded jurors they must put aside their biases as they decide the defendant\u2019s fate. \u201cRemember, you have promised to be a fair juror,\u201d the judge said. \u201cA fair juror is a person who will keep their promise to be fair and impartial and who will not permit the verdict to be influenced by a bias or prejudice in favor of or against a person who appeared in this trial.\u201d Merchan has asked the jury to clarify Thursday morning whether they wanted the entire, hourlong presentation to be read back, or if there were just portions of it that they needed to hear one more time. The jury was not given a written copy of Merchan\u2019s charging instructions, something CNN senior legal analyst Elie Honig said is a problem. While most federal judges will send the actual document with the jury as it deliberates, New York state courts forbid this practice. \u201cIt\u2019s the way that New York State courts do it,\u201d Honig said. \u201cThey are obstinate, they are stuck in the past, they are making life difficult for the jury.\u201d While the deliberations are ongoing, Trump and his attorneys are remaining in the courthouse in downtown Manhattan, so they can be ready if the jury returns any additional notes, which could be questions or requests like the one Wednesday afternoon to re-hear testimony. The jurors were also given a laptop that had all of the evidence in the trial, so they could consult it while they deliberate. The judge said the laptop does not have internet access. Meanwhile, the six alternate jurors aren\u2019t yet off the hook. They\u2019ve been asked to come back in the event one of them needs to replace one of the 12 jurors in case they are unable to serve.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/29/politics/takeaways-trump-jury-deliberations/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/30/2024", "section": "us"}}

The posting was shared on a public online hiring website and read \u201cOnly US Born Citizens [white] who are local within 60 miles from Dallas, TX [Don\u2019t share with candidates].\u201d The post prompted the DOJ and Labor Department to launch investigations. The Department of Labor\u2019s Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) launched theirs in April 2023, and the DOJ\u2019s Civil Rights Division\u2019s Immigrant and Employee Rights Section (IER) in May of 2023. \u201cArthur Grand Technologies vehemently denies any guilt or wrongdoing in relation to the discriminatory job posting that appeared in March 2023,\u201d said Arthur Grand Technologies CEO Sheik Rahmathullah in an email to CNN. \u201cThis unauthorized posting was made by an upset employee on a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP) from their personal email address and account.

The four inmates, all held in connection with violent crimes, escaped from the Tangipahoa Parish Jail north of New Orleans, according to a Facebook post from Sheriff Daniel Edwards. Two were taken into custody Monday morning. The sheriff\u2019s office identified the two inmates still at large as Omarion Hookfin, 19, and Jamarcus Cyprian, 20. \u201cWe feel that they\u2019re no longer in Tangipahoa Parish,\u201d Tangipahoa Parish Sheriff\u2019s Office Chief of Operations Jimmy Travis said Monday. He added anyone who assisted the escapees in leaving the area would also face charges. Authorities believe two inmates left the facility in southeastern Louisiana\u2019s Amite City Saturday afternoon and the other two left Sunday afternoon, Travis said at a news conference. The sheriff\u2019s office did not learn the inmates had escaped until Sunday afternoon, when a \u201cconcerned citizen\u201d contacted the warden and reported two of the escapees had come to a relative\u2019s house looking for a \u201cplace to stay,\u201d Jail administrators then realized a total of four inmates were missing. \u201cThe four inmates were able to escape the perimeter fence of the Parish Jail while participating in their recreation time on the yard,\u201d the sheriff said.

{"id": "2024_05_27_us_braintree-massachusetts-amc-movie-theater-stabbing", "text": "A suspect accused of stabbing a man through a McDonald\u2019s drive-through window and then stabbing a woman inside the restaurant was arrested last month on suspicion of assaulting a family member, court records show. Massachusetts police are also investigating whether the assailant at the McDonald\u2019s in Plymouth also stabbed four girls between ages 9 and 17 about an hour earlier at a movie theater in Braintree. Jared Ravizza, 26, is the suspect in \u201cmultiple South Shore stabbing incidents,\u201d the Plymouth County District Attorney\u2019s Office said, though no details were given for the other incidents. Braintree police have said it \u201cappears as though\u201d the attacks at the movie theater and the McDonald\u2019s are related. Ravizza was arrested and faces charges of assault with intent to murder and two counts of assault and battery with a dangerous weapon in connection with the attack at McDonald\u2019s. The suspect is expected to appear in\u00a0court Tuesday, and it was not immediately clear Monday whether Ravizza had an attorney. Last month, Ravizza was arrested on Martha\u2019s Vineyard, accused of assault and battery of a family member and vandalism, according to records at Edgartown District Court. Records show that case has not been adjudicated. Ravizza\u2019s father told officers Jared \u201chad just had a mental break and attacked him\u201d inside his home, The Boston Globe reported, citing a police report on file with the court. The report also said Ravizza allegedly wrecked the father\u2019s home office, according to The Boston Globe. Ravizza was sent to Martha\u2019s Vineyard Hospital for a mental health evaluation, but \u201cdid not meet their standards to be held,\u201d the Boston Globe reported, citing the report. How the weekend stabbings unfolded The first attack happened around 6 p.m. Saturday at an AMC movie theater in Braintree. \u201cWithout saying anything and without any warning, (the assailant) suddenly attacked and stabbed the four young females,\u201d police said. \u201cThe attack appeared to be unprovoked. After the attack, the (suspect) ran out of the theater and left in a vehicle.\u201d The girls were taken to Boston hospitals with non-life-threatening injuries, Braintree police said. The theater was put on lockdown shortly after the incident, an AMC employee told CNN. The suspect fled the theater in what appeared to be a black SUV, and video footage allowed authorities to capture its license plate, authorities said. A vehicle matching the description was \u201creportedly involved in (a) similar assault in Plymouth,\u201d about 25 miles southeast of Braintree, police said. About an hour after the movie theater stabbings, a 21-year-old woman and a 29-year-old man were stabbed at the McDonald\u2019s in Plymouth. Ravizza allegedly arrived at the scene of the Plymouth McDonald\u2019s in a black Porsche Macan SUV, prosecutors said. Surveillance footage from the McDonald\u2019s appears to show Ravizza reach through the drive-through window and stab the male victim with a large knife, prosecutors said. Video then shows the suspect park the car, enter the restaurant and stab the female victim before fleeing in the car, the district attorney\u2019s office said. Both victims from the McDonald\u2019s attack were taken to hospitals with non-life-threatening injuries, officials said. Minutes after the McDonald\u2019s stabbings, state troopers located the suspect\u2019s car and tried to pull it over, authorities said. But the driver failed to stop, and a chase ensued. The suspect\u2019s vehicle eventually crashed in Sandwich, about a 25-minute drive south of Plymouth, police said. Ravizza was being treated for non-life-threatening injuries at a hospital Sunday, the prosecutor\u2019s office said. While Ravizza faces assault charges in connection with the McDonald\u2019s attack, \u201cPreliminary investigation suggests a likely connection to an earlier incident at a movie theater in Braintree resulting in non-life threatening injuries to four juveniles,\u201d state police said. It was not immediately clear whether Ravizza has an attorney. CNN has sought more information from Massachusetts State Police,\u00a0the Plymouth County District Attorney\u2019s Office and the Braintree Police Department. Massachusetts State Police said the investigation is ongoing. Investigators probe another possible link Aside from the Massachusetts stabbings, Connecticut State Police said a suspect linked to a death in the town of Deep River had been taken into custody in Massachusetts. But police in neither state have confirmed whether the Connecticut case is connected to the stabbings in Massachusetts. Connecticut State Police said they responded Saturday afternoon to a \u201cdisturbance\u201d at an address in Deep River. There, police found a \u201cdeceased individual\u201d whose identity has not been confirmed, Connecticut State Police said. \u201cA suspect in this investigation has been taken into custody in the State of Massachusetts and there is no active threat to the public,\u201d Connecticut police said. Authorities did not name that suspect. CNN\u2019s Celina Tebor, Paradise Afshar, Samantha Beech, Artemis Moshtaghian, Caroll Alvarado and Kristina Sgueglia contributed to this report.

Soon, the online fundraiser was spreading to states like Texas, Florida and New Jersey. Within a matter of two weeks, Daken\u2019s fundraiser more than doubled his goal. As of Daken\u2019s fifth grade graduation on Tuesday, the Daken Kramer Legacy Award will now be an annual honor for fifth graders striving to make their own mark. \u201cYour selfless actions will impact dozens of students throughout the district,\u201d Kristi Haley, Daken\u2019s teacher, said as she announced the award in his name. \u201cIt\u2019s not the amount of money you raised, although that was absolutely incredible. It\u2019s your heart, your drive, your determination and your grit to help others that inspires us.\u201d Daken said the award took him aback. \u201cIt was definitely a surprise. I had no idea that they were going to do that,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I definitely started to feel a lot of emotions.\u201d A lunch for an elementary schooler in the Blue Springs School District is $2.55 \u2013 with the reduced price being 40 cents for students in need, according to the district. About 29% of the roughly 15,000 students enrolled in the Blue Springs School District are eligible for a free or reduced lunch, district spokesperson Katie Woolf told CNN Thursday. While Daken\u2019s fundraiser cleared his school\u2019s meal debt, the Blue Springs School District meal debt totals to more than $235,000, according to Woolf. The district includes 20 schools at varying levels. The School Nutrition Association reported among the school districts represented by their members \u2013 about one-fifth of US school districts nationwide \u2013 meal debt ranged from $10 to approximately $1 million, according to the school nutrition directors who are members of their organization and who responded to the association\u2019s 2024 survey. The association collected this data as a part of their lobbying effort to try to get more funding for school meal programs. In November 2023, the median reported district meal debt was about $5,495 among districts represented by members who responded to the survey, which was up from about $5,164 in the survey a year prior, according to the association. Hoping to bring wider attention to the issue of school meal debt, Kramer says she and Daken are now working with a Missouri state representative to see if they can take their efforts to the next level. Seeing the droves of people who reached out with support showed Kramer how one person can make a difference, she said. \u201cEven though this is something that kids don\u2019t need to worry about and don\u2019t have any responsibility (for), I\u2019m very, very proud as his mom that he is mature enough to see that there is an issue and if the people who have the power to make a change won\u2019t change anything, then he will step up and make a change,\u201d she said. Daken, whose favorite school lunch is an orange chicken and rice bowl, says kids don\u2019t have to do extraordinary things to be the next recipient of the Daken Kramer Legacy Award. \u201cThey don\u2019t really need to do anything big to get the award,\u201d Daken said. \u201cIt\u2019s only if they really care about it and they are really, really compassionate about helping the school.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/26/us/missouri-daken-kramer-school-lunch-debt/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/30/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_05_29_us_social-media-children-influencers-cec", "text": "Cam Barrett knows the precise date of her first menstrual period. Her mother posted the news on Facebook. \u201cI was in fourth grade. I was 9 years old. The date was September 9, 2009. And my mom posted \u2026 something like, \u2018Oh my God, my baby girl\u2019s a woman today. She got her first period,\u2019\u201d Barrett said. \u201cA lot of my friends and their parents had social media, so it was super embarrassing.\u201d Barrett\u2019s childhood overlapped with the dawn of the social media era. She said her mother was an avid user of MySpace and Facebook, where she posted details about their lives and many of Barrett\u2019s private moments. Nothing about her life was off-limits, including her tantrums, her medical diagnoses and the fact that she\u2019s adopted, said Barrett, who uses the pronouns she and they. The popularity of her mother\u2019s posts earned them attention and perks from celebrities, such as front-row tickets to a Demi Lovato concert, Barrett said. But the oversharing severely impacted her as a child. In middle school, bullies used the information to mock her, causing her anxiety and other mental health struggles, they said. Sometimes, she hid in her room to avoid appearing on camera. She didn\u2019t confide in adults during her teenage years because she feared her secrets would end up on social media, she said. Her mother did not respond to repeated requests from CNN for comment. Now 25, Barrett is part of a growing movement of young people who are urging lawmakers to protect children whose parents monetize their images, videos and private lives on social media. Though it\u2019s unclear whether her mother earned revenue from the content \u2014 Barrett was too young to understand the process \u2014 the oversharing took a toll on her mental health, she said. The young advocates are calling for financial compensation for these children, and their right to delete unwanted content when they become adults. Posts about her staph infection led to bullying at school, she says Barrett shares with her 240,000 followers\u202fon TikTok\u202fher views on\u202fexploitive \u201csharenting\u201d or family vlogging culture. The term \u201csharenting\u201d is a mashup of sharing and parenting \u2014 involving the publicizing of kids\u2019 personal information \u2014 while vlogging is shorthand for video-led blogging. Barrett, a social media strategist who lives in Chicago,\u202fsaid her life was chronicled so much online\u202fthat a man once sent her a private message on Facebook when she was 12. The message said he\u2019d followed her home as she rode her bike and knew where she lived. The incident increased her anxiety and made her feel like strangers were watching her every move, she said. At a hearing in February 2023, she tearfully urged Washington state lawmakers to pass a law that protects minor children whose private lives are documented by family members on social media. In addition to the details above, she also told lawmakers that when she was 15, she was in a car accident. Instead of extending a comforting hand, her mother shoved a camera in her face, she said. She later told CNN that her mother took photos and videos of her on a hospital gurney and posted them to Facebook. CNN searched her mother\u2019s social media accounts and found one photo that appears to be from the accident. It\u2019s unclear whether she removed the other photos or restricted her Facebook settings. Barrett also testified that in her first year of high school, she got a staph infection that landed her in the hospital. Her mother posted to social media exaggerated accounts of her condition, she said. \u201cWhen I returned to school, my math teacher \u2014 who had seen my mother\u2019s posts \u2014 would taunt me and tell kids to stay away from the infected girl,\u201d Barrett told lawmakers. This led to bullying and eventually to her dropping out of school, she said. \u201cI plead you to be the voice for this generation of children because I know firsthand what it\u2019s like to not have a choice in which a digital footprint you didn\u2019t create follows you around for the rest of your life.\u201d In interviews with CNN, Barrett said the oversharing created a lot of tension between her and her mother, and the two barely talk now. Advocates want legal protections for child influencers Gen Zers like Barrett, who were born between the late 1990s and the early 2010s, have almost never known a world without social media. As adults, they\u2019re now unraveling the effects of having their childhoods documented online. Barrett said she realizes that her mother was navigating new technology at the time and may not have understood the harm caused by her posts.  Today\u2019s parents likely have a better awareness of social media\u2019s effects on children, and the advocates hope their warnings will help provide more insight. Children\u2019s advocates said it\u2019s important for parents to respect their kids\u2019 autonomy and allow them control of their own digital footprint.\u202f They said their biggest concerns are not parents who post occasional photos of their kids but family vloggers and other influencers who seek followers and revenue on platforms such as YouTube and TikTok. These influencers document their families\u2019 most personal moments online, turning their home lives into reality shows. Until recently, no states had laws protecting the privacy and financial\u202finterests of children influencers.  But that\u2019s starting to change. Illinois, Barrett\u2019s home state,\u202fpassed a law\u202flast year that requires parents to compensate child influencers. The bill, which amends the state\u2019s child labor law, mandates parents set aside a percentage of the money they make from content creation to compensate minors who are featured in online videos.\u202f\u00a0The funds must be put into a blocked trust fund and accessible to children when they turn 18 or are emancipated. Several other states are looking into similar proposals. \u201cSocial media happened to us so quickly and changed many of our daily habits and behaviors virtually overnight. It\u2019s like we all started taking a new medication, with no clinical trials or studies and no information about long-term side effects,\u201d said \u202fCaroline Easom, a comedian who posts skits mocking parents who monetize social media content about their children. \u201cAnd now, over a decade later, we\u2019re just starting to realize how reckless that was.\u201d In one of her skits, titled \u201clet\u2019s un-normalize filming children during vulnerable moments,\u201d she uses an example of a friend whipping out a phone to film another friend who\u2019s just announced something\u2019s bothering them. \u201cOne of the biggest lessons we are learning from people who were overshared as children is that social media is not the place to let your guard down, as a viewer or as a creator.\u202f Social media is not a safe space,\u201d said Easom, who has more than 3 million followers on TikTok. \u201cThese platforms invite and reward your vulnerability and authenticity, but that authenticity has lasting consequences, especially when it comes to children. The cost of posting your child for your own validation and attention might be their trust, or worse, their safety.\u201d They\u2019re seeking new laws similar to those governing child actors Family vlogging can be lucrative. Influencers on YouTube can earn about $18 for every 1,000 views, according to a January\u202fpost by Werner Geyser, founder of Influencer Marketing Hub. That number rapidly multiplies for influencers with massive followings. In 2022, the typical compensation for YouTube content creators  in the US was approximately\u202f$1,154\u202fper week, Geyser said. Chris McCarty, 19, a sophomore at the University of Washington, started the organization\u202f\u202fQuit Clicking Kids\u202fto combat the monetizing of kids on social media. Some children of family vloggers are living in homes that feel like sets and with parents who double as their bosses, said McCarty, who uses the pronouns them and they. \u201cI have spoken with some\u2026 child actors, and one of the things that really stood out is that when they were filming as child actors, there was a very clear distinction between when they were on and when they were off camera,\u201d they said. \u201cWhen they were home at the end of the day, they knew they didn\u2019t have to perform anymore. But this new generation of children, there\u2019s no home to go to at the end of the day where they can disconnect, because the camera is inside the house. It\u2019s like living in a movie set all day, every day.\u201d McCarty said family vloggers should be regulated like the film industry, citing as an example\u202fa California law\u202fthat mandates 15% of all child performers\u2019 earnings be set aside in an interest-earning trust. More states are weighing measures to protect children Some states are catching up with internet culture and taking a harder look at the world of child influencers and their families. The Illinois law, which goes into effect in July, will require family content creators to put a portion of their earnings into a blocked trust fund for their children. The bill was inspired by Shreya Nallamothu, a teenager who became increasingly alarmed by how often she saw children featured in family vlogs and wrote a letter to her state senator. In February, both Barrett and McCarty testified before Maryland lawmakers in support of a bill that would require people who use minors in monetized social media content to put a percentage of their income aside in a trust for when the kids turn 18. The bill also would allow adults whose content was posted on social media when they were minors to be able to delete unwanted posts when they come of age. Lawmakers in California, Georgia, Missouri, Ohio, Minnesota and Arizona have considered similar legislation. \u201cEveryone deserves fair compensation for their work, and these children deserve to share in their family\u2019s financial success, especially if it comes at the cost of their privacy,\u201d said state Sen. Steve Padilla, a Democrat from San Diego, in a statement. Padilla introduced a bill last year that would require online family content creators to set aside a share of their income in a trust for their children. McCarty is working with lawmakers in their home state of Washington on a similar bill. \u201cIt\u2019s been so inspiring to see states taking up the mantle, and I hope that we are able to keep this momentum,\u201d McCarty said. \u201cThese kind of simultaneous firecracker moments happening across the US \u2026 give me hope that we can reduce the harmful impacts on a federal level.\u201d But Easom said while financial compensation for child performers is a step in the right direction, there are still other issues that need addressing. For example, she would like to see limits on the number of hours children can shoot content. In September 2022, she\u202fread a letter\u202ffrom the child of a family vlogger who implored her to warn her followers not to subject their kids to monetizing their lives online. \u201cAny money you (parents) get will be greatly overshadowed by years of suffering,\u201d the author of the letter said. \u201c\u2026your child will never be normal.\u201d Parents should think how they\u2019d feel if someone shared their personal details, experts say Jessica Maddox, an assistant professor at the University of Alabama who studies social media influencers, is hopeful other states will follow in Illinois\u2019 footsteps. \u201cMany people don\u2019t view social media content creation and influencing as work, but it takes time and skill to do,\u201d\u00a0Maddox said in an email to CNN. \u201cSocial media has changed the nature of labor, and as a result, the nature of child labor. While it may be fun for a child to want to be in their parents\u2019 videos, children, especially young children, don\u2019t have the capacity to understand how far and wide social media content can go. In cases where their parents are receiving financial compensation for featuring their child, that child has essentially performed as a type of labor.\u201d Advocates said many parents are starting to realize their children deserve control of their own digital footprints. \u201cA lot of people who follow family channels and kid accounts have never zoomed out and asked themselves why they have such intimate access to a kid they\u2019ve never met,\u201d Easom said. \u201cI want people to remember the curated videos (that) family channels are putting out do not necessarily represent what happens when the cameras are off.\u201d CNN reached out to several family vloggers for comments on this issue but they did not respond. McCarty said the most egregious offenders are parents who seek out and even create drama among their children to boost their followings. \u201cImagine a family vlog where instead of antics, intimate details such as mental health issues, grades and personal things like potty training and first periods get shared online, where they live forever,\u201d McCarty said. \u201cParents then use this clip as clickbait to generate intrigue and revenue for a monetized family channel. Some accounts even record and monetize videos in which the parents encourage their kids to fight each other as a prank.\u201d McCarty advises parents to operate under the golden rule of do unto others as you would have them do unto you. \u201cIf your child posted things like, \u2018Oh, you know, my mom just got into a really big fight with her colleague at work the other day.\u2019 \u2018Oh, my mom didn\u2019t close this business deal at work, and she might get fired.\u2019 \u2018Oh, my mom and my dad aren\u2019t getting along because he spends too much time at the bar,\u2019\u201d McCarty said. \u201cIt\u2019s the intimacy of what\u2019s being shared that strangers don\u2019t have any right to know.\u201d Adults would be hurt if someone revealed their most personal details online to make money, McCarty said, adding that parents should\u202fassume their children would be, too.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/29/us/social-media-children-influencers-cec/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/30/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_05_29_us_giant-pandas-return-to-national-zoo", "text": "Two new giant pandas will be arriving at the Smithsonian\u2019s National Zoo in Washington, DC, this year, the zoo announced Wednesday. The bears, named\u00a0Qing Bao\u00a0and\u00a0Bao Li, a pair of 2-year-old black-and-white animals,\u00a0will arrive by the end of 2024 through a partnership with the China Wildlife Conservation Association, the zoo said. In a\u00a0video announcement featuring first lady Jill Biden\u00a0planning a \u201cblack tie,\u201d vegetarian dinner for the iconic bears, the zoo celebrated the news. \u201cI\u2019m so proud to say that this long-standing program and this collaboration with our Chinese colleagues is one of the reasons why giant pandas are no longer listed as endangered, but rather only vulnerable on the global list of species at risk of extinction,\u201d Brandie Smith, director of the zoo\u2019s Conservation Biology Institute, told reporters Wednesday. The institute is seeking $25 million in public and corporate donations\u00a0to support the pandas over the next 10 years. Chinese ambassador Xie Feng touted the journey of the \u201cnewest envoys of friendship\u201d as a symbol of the deepening of \u201cfriendly ties\u201d between the US and China. \u201cChina and the United States should choose to be partners, not rivals,\u201d Feng said. \u201cPanda huggers should not be stigmatized. If there should be any protectionism, then let us protect biodiversity; protect the only home for the entire humanity; protect stable, sound and sustainable China-US relations and protect a better future for the younger generations.\u201d Bao Li has ties to Washington: His mother, Bao Bao, was born at the zoo in 2013 and his grandparents, Tian Tian and Mei Xiang, left an unbearable panda-shaped hole in DC residents\u2019 hearts last year when they bid farewell to the zoo. Last year, the Smithsonian\u2019s three giant pandas \u2013 Tian Tian, Mei Xiang and their youngest cub, Xiao Qi Ji \u2013\u00a0departed the National Zoo, prompting concerns that the 50-year history of the bears being housed in the US capital could be coming to an end. At the time, Smithsonian staff called the departure a \u201chiatus,\u201d but Chinese officials had yet to clarify the future of the program. In a meeting with American business leaders last November in San Francisco, Chinese President Xi Jinping\u00a0suggested China might renew the panda exchange with the United States, calling them \u201cenvoys of friendship between the Chinese and American peoples,\u201d during a visit largely aimed at easing fraught ties between the two powers. \u201cWe are ready to continue our cooperation with the United States on panda conservation and do our best to meet the wishes of the Californians so as to deepen the friendly ties between our two peoples,\u201d Xi said at the time. The return of the bamboo-loving bears may mark a new chapter of decades of \u201cpanda diplomacy.\u201d With tensions rising in the Indo-Pacific \u2013\u00a0notably following large-scale joint Chinese military drills\u00a0around Taiwan following the inauguration of the island\u2019s new president \u2013 the relationship between the US and China hangs in a precarious balance. Zoo Atlanta\u2019s four iconic pandas will depart for China\u00a0later this year, as the zoo\u2019s agreement with China is set to expire in late 2024. Their journey follows the departure of pandas from the San Diego and Memphis zoos. More pandas are set to arrive in other parts of the country, as well. In April, it was announced China would send giant pandas to San Francisco\u2019s zoo for the first time, and the San Diego Zoo announced in February it would welcome two new black-and-white residents.

{"id": "2024_05_29_us_5-things-to-know-for-may-29-severe-weather-trump-trial-gaza-bird-flu-south-africa-election", "text": "The White House has announced new actions to modernize America\u2019s electrical grid, paving the way for clean energy and fewer outages. This comes as weather-related power blackouts are rising thanks to stronger storms putting more pressure on the nation\u2019s outdated infrastructure. Here\u2019s what else you need to know to\u00a0Get Up to Speed and On with Your Day. 1. Severe storms Hundreds of thousands of people in the southern and central US are now contending with widespread power outages after enduring an unrelenting series of storms. Around 500,000 utility customers in Texas were without electricity early today, including more than 240,000 in Dallas County. At least eight people have been killed in the state since Saturday as severe weather pummeled the region over Memorial Day weekend. After a brief reprieve today, another round of powerful storms will rumble back into the same area Thursday, the National Weather Service said. Forecasts show threats of large hail, damaging winds and localized flooding to the Dallas-Fort Worth area. 2. Trump trial The 12-person jury in former President Donald Trump\u2019s criminal hush money trial will begin deliberations today, moving them one step closer to deciding Trump\u2019s legal fate. During closing arguments on Tuesday, the defense and prosecution delivered diametrically opposed stories about the hush money payment made to adult film star Stormy Daniels in 2016 and the subsequent reimbursement to Trump\u2019s ex-lawyer Michael Cohen the following year. Trump has pleaded not guilty to the 34 felony counts for falsifying business records and denied the affair with Daniels. A felony conviction of a former president, and presumptive 2024 Republican nominee, would be unprecedented. 3. Gaza President Joe Biden is not altering his policy toward Israel following the recent Israeli strike that killed more than 45 people at a displacement camp in Rafah, the White House said Tuesday. Despite international outrage over the strike, the White House indicated that the attack did not cross a red line that would affect US support. Notably, munitions made in the US were used in the deadly strike, a CNN analysis has found. Also on Tuesday, the temporary pier constructed by the US military to transport aid into Gaza broke apart in heavy seas, the Pentagon said. The repairs will take more than a week, further delaying efforts to get the maritime corridor fully operating. 4. Bird flu A group of alpacas on a farm in Idaho recently tested positive for H5N1 bird flu for the first time, according to the USDA. The gene sequence of viruses isolated from the alpacas shows it is closely related to the H5N1 viruses currently circulating in dairy cattle. For more than two decades, H5N1 has primarily affected birds. In the past two years, however, the virus has been infecting a wider variety of wild and farmed mammals, raising concern that it could be moving closer to becoming a pathogen that can transmit easily between people. Human cases have been reported sporadically around the globe over the years, including three in the US, but no person-to-person transmission has been reported in the ongoing US cattle outbreak. 5. South Africa election Millions of South Africans will cast their votes today in what is expected to be the most pivotal general election since the end of apartheid. For months, polls have shown the ruling African National Congress party could lose its majority for the first time since Nelson Mandela led it to power in 1994. If support for the ANC drops below 50%, the party will be forced to enter into a coalition government. Almost 28 million people are registered to vote \u2014 the highest number to date, according to the Independent Electoral Commission.

{"id": "2024_05_29_business_mcdonalds-burger-prices", "text": "McDonald\u2019s has a message for America: Rumors of Big Mac inflation are greatly exaggerated. \u201cRecently, we have seen viral social posts and poorly sourced reports that McDonald\u2019s has raised prices significantly beyond inflationary rates. This is inaccurate,\u201d Joe Erlinger,\u00a0president of McDonald\u2019s USA, wrote in an open letter posted to the company\u2019s website on Wednesday. \u201cThe average price of a Big Mac in the U.S. was $4.39 in 2019,\u201d he said. \u201cDespite a global pandemic and historic rises in supply chain costs, wages and other inflationary pressures in the years that followed, the average cost is now $5.29. That\u2019s an increase of 21% (not 100%).\u201d What Erlinger wants customers to know is not that high-priced McDonald\u2019s burgers don\u2019t exist at all. He just wants them to know that the burgers that have been cited as proof of radically higher prices are not the norm. \u201cIt frustrates and worries me, and many of our franchisees, when I hear about an $18 Big Mac meal being sold \u2014 even if it was at one location in the U.S. out of more than 13,700,\u201d he said. \u201cMore worrying, though, is when people believe that this is the rule and not the exception, or when folks start to suggest that the prices of a Big Mac have risen 100% since 2019.\u201d Online, people have been airing their fast food price grievances. But they\u2019re not just griping: Customers are pulling back on spending, too. Diners, frustrated by higher prices, are not going out to eat as often and spending less when they do, causing fast food sales to slow and traffic to dip. Erlinger is fighting back because McDonald\u2019s pricey burgers have become something of a symbol of elevated fast food prices. And being seen as overpriced could hamper sales and reputation, especially at McDonald\u2019s. \u201cIt\u2019s imperative that we continue to keep affordability at the forefront for our customers,\u201d McDonald\u2019s CEO Chris Kempczinski said during an April 30 analyst call. \u201cWe literally wrote the playbook on value, and we are committed to upholding our leadership within the industry.\u201d To win back consumers, the burger chain is also reportedly considering adding a $5 value meal to the menu for a limited time. Earlier this month, the Wall Street Journal reported\u00a0that McDonald\u2019s is planning to start running its $5 meal promotion at the end of June. A recent statement from the National Owner\u2019s Association, a group for McDonald\u2019s franchise operators, indicated that operators were still deciding whether to adopt the promotion, which would include chicken nuggets, fries, a soft drink and either a McDouble or McChicken sandwich for $5. A NOA representative declined to comment on the status of the vote. Erlinger nodded to the possibility of a national $5 value meal in his letter. \u201cI fully expect the prices at your local McDonald\u2019s to be an area of conversation and focus in the coming months,\u201d he said. \u201cAs it does, I hope you\u2019ll see the programs we\u2019re launching nationally and locally as meaningful to you.\u201d \u2014 CNN\u2019s Jordan Valinsky contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/29/business/mcdonalds-burger-prices/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/30/2024", "section": "us"}}

Following a four-month long disappearance, Subway announced Wednesday the \u201ctriumphant return\u201d of the oversized chocolate chip cookie, which was pulled from many restaurants less than two weeks after its January debut because of massive demand. The giant cookie was part of Subway\u2019s new Sidekick lineup, a key part to Subway\u2019s turnaround plans, which also includes a number of other changes to its menus as part of its efforts to keep up with rivals. The lineup also consists of a Cinnabon churro and a soft pretzel from Auntie Anne\u2019s, both of which remained on sale in the past few months. Subway said it has sold more than 5 million cookies since its roll out. The company added\u00a0customization to its menu, doubled down on pushing orders to its app, increased its\u00a0international presence\u00a0and most recently introduced\u00a0freshly sliced meats\u00a0\u2014 a major shift from Subway\u2019s previous method of delivering cold cuts pre-sliced. \u201cThe Footlong Cookie has delighted millions of Americans since their first bites in January, sparking unprecedented demand over the last several months,\u201d\u00a0Paul Fabre, Subway\u2019s senior vice president of culinary and innovation, said in a press release.

Effective immediately, the cookie is available to order on platforms where they were pulled from, including Subway\u2019s website, app and third-party services, like DoorDash and Uber Eats. They can also be ordered in-person. Subway could use a boost: Its location count continues to dwindle, closing more than 400 restaurants in the US last year.

{"id": "2024_05_27_us_hot-dogs-american-favorite-ijgdi-cec", "text": "It\u2019s Memorial Day weekend, the unofficial kickoff of summer in the US, which means Americans are practically required under federal law to gather friends and family, fire up the grill and cook something. For many people, that means scarfing down some hot dogs. I will not be one of those people. In the vast smorgasbord of festive foods, hot dogs have never done it for me. I\u2019m not a vegetarian or a picky eater, and I\u2019m not on some nitrates-free health kick. I just don\u2019t care for them. During peak hot dog season, from Memorial Day to Labor Day, Americans consume an estimated 7 billion hot dogs. That makes me a statistical outlier at best, and at worst, maybe a traitor. Who doesn\u2019t like hot dogs? It\u2019s almost un-American, like disliking football or Dolly Parton. I pass no judgment on hot dog lovers, and I understand the appeal. Hot dogs are cheap, easy to cook, portable and endlessly customizable. They\u2019re the perfect outdoor food accessory: Grab a hot dog in one hand, and you still have another hand free for a cold beverage of your choice. At the famous annual Nathan\u2019s Hot Dog Eating Contest, perennial champ Joey Chestnut once snarfed down 75 of them in 10 minutes. I watched this on TV, and it was a little traumatic. This dislike may have deep roots in my childhood. My mother tells me that when I was about a year old, she cut up a hot dog and put the bite-size pieces on my high chair tray, within reach of my grubby little fingers. I popped one in my mouth and immediately began choking. She held me upside down and shook me until I coughed it up. From then on, my mother says I refused to eat hot dogs. I wasn\u2019t a fussy kid \u2014 I\u2019d heartily gobble up all kinds of vegetables (except for beets, which I didn\u2019t learn to appreciate until deep into adulthood). But hot dogs were a no go. Maybe I had some residual hot dog trauma. As an older kid, I no longer had to suffer through hot dogs at home. But out in the world, it was a different story. At friends\u2019 birthday parties, the parents often served hot dogs, and I didn\u2019t want to be the weird kid sitting there with a few chips on an otherwise empty paper plate. I found that if I drenched a hot dog in enough ketchup, mustard and relish, I could force it down and then turn my eager attention to the birthday cake. Baseball games were another problem. I love baseball, for all the old-timey reasons: Its leisurely rhythms, the surge of the crowd on a ball hit to the warning track, that exhilarating first glimpse of the field when you emerge from the ballpark tunnel. But back in the \u201870s, when I was young, ballparks didn\u2019t offer a vast array of food options. Boston\u2019s Fenway Park, where I saw many of my earliest baseball games, had vendors going up and down the aisles yelling \u201cFenway Franks! Get ya Fenway Franks heeaaah!\u201d Their sales pitches didn\u2019t sway me, but they also sold roasted peanuts. I ate a lot of peanuts. Right about now you might be thinking, \u201cWhy should I care if some guy at CNN doesn\u2019t like hot dogs?\u201d It\u2019s a fair question. But ask yourself: Have you ever disliked something that almost everyone else seems to enjoy? It feels a little lonely. It also can make you question your judgment. Everyone else I knew loved hot dogs \u2014 what was wrong with me? In such existential moments, you\u2019re faced with a choice: You can pretend to like the thing, and feel sort of phony. Or, while everyone else is zigging, you can embrace your zag. Admittedly, hot dogs are low stakes. It\u2019s another thing entirely to announce you don\u2019t like democracy, or true love, or grandmothers. Or maybe pizza. And yet for years, to avoid awkward questions, I hid my distaste. By the time I was in college, I decided to speak my truth. This didn\u2019t always go well. The summer I turned 18, I shared a beach house with three buddies, including two brothers whose mom paid us a visit one weekend and offered to make us lunch. When I learned what was on the menu I exclaimed, \u201cHot dogs? I hate hot dogs!\u201d just as their mother emerged from the kitchen with a steaming plate of franks. She shot me a look. Being the gracious charmer I was, I ate my dog in abashed silence. In case you\u2019re wondering, I have no issues with the many cousins of the humble hot dog. I will happily eat Italian sausages, andouille sausages and chorizo, which to me have more flavor and heft. Bratwurst are fine if slathered in spicy mustard. But by my twenties I\u2019d pretty much stopped eating hot dogs. I just couldn\u2019t get past how they tasted to me:\u00a0 sweaty and sour and vaguely curdled. Now here we are in 2024, and hot dogs \u2014 despite nutritional warnings that eating one could take 36 minutes off your life \u2014 seem as popular as ever. There are plant-based versions, which probably taste even more horrifying. People are having viral debates about whether or not a hot dog is a sandwich. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m allowed to answer that question. When I sat down to write this, it occurred to me that I hadn\u2019t eaten a hot dog in at least several decades. My personal experience with hot dogs was a little out of date. Maybe my taste buds had evolved? There was only one thing to do. In the interest of research, my girlfriend\u2019s dad helped me procure an eight-pack of all-beef franks and some Walmart hot dog buns. Nothing fancy. My girlfriend, her parents and I cooked the dogs up in a hot skillet, plopped them in the buns and squirted them with ketchup and yellow mustard. I took a bite. My three lunchtime companions all stared at me, curious to gauge my reaction. The verdict? Meh. The hot dog was not as terrible as I remembered. But it wasn\u2019t exactly tasty, either. The aftertaste lingered in my mouth like a bad houseguest. I tried my best, and I\u2019m ok with that. Don\u2019t hate me. So on this Memorial Day, I wish all hot dog lovers out there a frankly delicious holiday. Because of oddballs like me, there will be more hot dogs to go around for the rest of you.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/27/us/hot-dogs-american-favorite-ijgdi-cec/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/30/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_05_26_us_braintree-massachusetts-amc-stabbing", "text": "A suspect was arrested Saturday after six people \u2013 including four girls between the ages of 9 and 17 \u2013 were stabbed in separate attacks that Massachusetts authorities say are likely connected. The girls, who were attacked at a movie theater, suffered non-life-threatening injuries and were taken to Boston hospitals for treatment, according to police in Braintree. About an hour later, a 21-year-old woman and a 29-year-old man were stabbed at a Plymouth McDonald\u2019s and taken to hospitals with non-life-threatening injuries. A suspect in the McDonald\u2019s stabbings, Jared Ravizza, was arrested 15 minutes after fleeing the scene Saturday night and faces multiple assault charges, the Plymouth County District Attorney\u2019s Office announced in a news release.  Ravizza, 26, is the suspect in \u201cmultiple South Shore stabbing incidents,\u201d the attorney\u2019s office said, though no details on the other incidents were provided. Braintree police have said it \u201cappears as though\u201d the attacks at the movie theater and McDonald\u2019s, which occurred about an hour apart, are related. The stabbing of the four girls at the AMC happened around 6 p.m. in Braintree. The theater was placed in lockdown shortly after the incident, an AMC employee told CNN. \u201cWithout saying anything and without any warning, he suddenly attacked and stabbed the four young females,\u201d police said of the suspect. \u201cThe attack appeared to be unprovoked. After the attack, the man ran out of the theater and left in a vehicle.\u201d Police discovered the suspect had left the theater in what appeared to be a black SUV, and video footage allowed authorities to capture its license plate, the release says. A vehicle matching the description was \u201creportedly involved in similar assault in Plymouth,\u201d which is about a 30-minute drive south of Braintree, police said. Ravizza allegedly arrived at the scene of the Plymouth McDonald\u2019s stabbings in a black Porsche Macan SUV, according to prosecutors. Police were called to the scene around 7 p.m., about an hour after the AMC attack in Braintree, the district attorney\u2019s office said. Surveillance footage from the McDonald\u2019s appears to show Ravizza reach through the drive-through window and stab the male victim with a large knife, prosecutors allege. Video then shows the suspect park his car, enter the restaurant and stab the female victim before fleeing in the car, according to the district attorney\u2019s office. Within minutes, state troopers located the suspect\u2019s car, but it failed to stop when they tried to pull it over. Police chased the vehicle, which \ufeffcrashed in Sandwich, about a 25-minute drive south of Plymouth, according to police. \u201cPreliminary investigation suggests a likely connection to an earlier incident at a movie theatre in Braintree resulting in non-life threatening injuries to four juveniles,\u201d state police said. Ravizza was being treated for non-life-threatening injuries at a hospital on Sunday, the prosecutor\u2019s office said. Ravizza will face multiple charges related to the McDonald\u2019s stabbings, including assault with intent to murder and two counts of assault and battery with a dangerous weapon, prosecutors said. He is expected to appear in\u00a0court Tuesday. CNN has been unable to identify an attorney for Ravizza but has sought further information from the Massachusetts State Police,\u00a0Plymouth County District Attorney\u2019s Office and Braintree Police. The Massachusetts State Police\u2019s investigation is active and ongoing. Separately, Connecticut State Police said a suspect linked to a death in the town of Deep River had been taken into custody in Massachusetts. Police in neither state have confirmed whether the Connecticut case is connected to those in Massachusetts. In a statement released late Saturday, Connecticut State Police said they responded Saturday afternoon to a \u201cdisturbance\u201d at an address within the town. There, police found a \u201cdeceased individual\u201d whose identity has not been confirmed, Connecticut State Police said. \u201cA suspect in this investigation has been taken into custody in the State of Massachusetts and there is no active threat to the public,\u201d the release said. It did not name the suspect.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/26/us/braintree-massachusetts-amc-stabbing/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/30/2024", "section": "us"}}

The agency made its announcement after the Japanese automaker issued a warning on Wednesday telling vehicle\u00a0owners\u00a0not to drive certain\u00a0vehicles\u00a0- the 2002-2006 model year\u00a0Nissan\u00a0Sentra, 2002-2004\u00a0Nissan\u00a0Pathfinder and 2002-2003 Infiniti QX4 - that were recalled in 2020 but have not been fixed. \u201cIf you have one of these\u00a0vehicles, do not drive it until the repair\u00a0is completed and the defective\u00a0air\u00a0bag\u00a0is replaced,\u201d NHTSA said in a statement, noting that\u00a0Nissan\u00a0dealers are offering free towing, mobile repair\u00a0and in some places loaner\u00a0vehicles. Over\u00a0the past decade, more than 100 million Takata\u00a0air\u00a0bag\u00a0inflators have been recalled worldwide - including 7 million in the United States - in the biggest auto safety callback on record.

The\u00a0air\u00a0bag\u00a0problems have been blamed on propellant that can break down after long-term exposure to high-temperature fluctuations and humidity. NHTSA said that even \u201cminor crashes can result in exploding Takata\u00a0air\u00a0bags that can kill or produce life-altering, gruesome injuries.\u201d Chrysler parent company Stellantis last year\u00a0issued warnings\u00a0to\u00a0owners\u00a0of 29,000 2003 Dodge Ram pickups to immediately\u00a0stop\u00a0driving\u00a0the\u00a0vehicles, pending repairs, after one person was killed when a Takata\u00a0air-bag\u00a0inflator exploded.

{"id": "2024_05_29_investing_graceland-scam", "text": "In yet another twist in the bizarre story of the dubious foreclosure threat against Elvis Presley\u2019s iconic Memphis home, a person purporting to be involved in a scheme to steal Graceland responded to an email from CNN, claiming responsibility for the scam. \u201cI didn\u2019t win this one. I\u2019ve stole (sic) many identities and received monies, we don\u2019t win all,\u201d wrote the self-proclaimed scammer in a mixture of English and Luganda, a language spoken by more than 5 million people primarily in Uganda, according to the United Nations. As with all scammers, it\u2019s unclear whether the person who emailed CNN is actually behind the scheme. But they responded to a CNN request for comment sent to an email address associated with Naussany Investments and Private Lending, a company that tried to foreclose on the famous mansion last week. Graceland was set to go up for auction under the pretext that the late singer\u2019s daughter, Lisa Marie Presley, who died in 2023, failed to pay back a $3.8 million loan she\u2019d secured from\u00a0 Naussany Investments before her passing, and had used Graceland as collateral, according to court documents. But actress Riley Keough, Elvis\u2019 granddaughter and heir, sued to protect the estate from the auction block, alleging fraud and saying Naussany didn\u2019t exist and had no rights to the property. The foreclosure sale was ultimately blocked, and Naussany Investments dropped its foreclosure efforts. A self-proclaimed scam artist CNN reached out to the email address listed as the company representative in Keough\u2019s lawsuit for comment. That person said his company had no claims against anyone affiliated with Graceland and directed CNN to a different email address \u2013 gregoryenaussanyniplflorida@hotmail.com \u2013 supposedly belonging to a person named Gregory Naussany, who responded when contacted by CNN. Other news outlets, including the New York Times, which first reported on the alleged scammer\u2019s admission Tuesday, received similar messages from the same email address. A Luganda-speaking native translated and reviewed the email for CNN. When asked whether the self-proclaimed scammer appeared to be a native speaker or was perhaps using a tool like Google Translate to pose as one, the translator found that while the apparent scammer knew the language, their writing style showed they were not entirely fluent. CNN has been unable to find any evidence to prove the company actually exists. The phone number listed in court documents was not in service. The business was listed in a court document as being located in Kimberling City, Missouri. But the secretary of state had no record of a business by that name when contacted by CNN. The Shelby County Registrar told CNN in an email that \u201cNaussany Investments & Private Lending, LLC, does not have any filings in the Office of the Shelby County Register of Deeds pertaining to Graceland/Elvis Presley.\u201d The self-identified scammer told the New York Times they are based in Nigeria and targeted groups including the dead and elderly. They especially went after victims in Florida and California, using sensitive documents like birth certificates to facilitate their schemes, according to the Times article. \u201cWe use innocents and we steal identity,\u201d said the scammer in an email to CNN. What would lead a scammer to go after the second most visited residence in the US behind the White House remains unknown. \u201cWe figure out how to steal,\u201d the scammer told the Times. \u201cThat\u2019s what we do.\u201d It was a mistake to target Graceland, said Mark Sunderman, a real estate professor at the University of Memphis. \u201cWhy they went after such a high-profile piece of property, that was just very stupid,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know, in terms of Memphis, I can\u2019t think of anything more high profile other than if they tried to go after the Civil Rights Museum.\u201d Court documents show Naussany Investments offered to settle its claimed debt with the Presley estate for $2.85 million, a reduction of $950,000 from the original loan.\u00a0 Sunderman believes that quick payoff may have been the scammer\u2019s goal, not a successful foreclosure on Graceland. \u201cIf they had gone through the foreclosure sale, they would have had much, much greater risk to get caught and had less payoff to them in the long run,\u201d he said. Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti last Thursday said he was looking into possible fraud involving the matter. The Shelby County District Attorney did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment on any possible criminal case.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/29/investing/graceland-scam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/30/2024", "section": "us"}}

But that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019ll get smoother, at least right away \u2014 and some financial firms are preparing to handle any possible bumpiness. The current standard settlement cycle for broker-dealer transactions is \u201cT+2.\u201d That means that it takes two business days from when you buy a stock to when that transaction \u201csettles,\u201d or when the stock is officially transferred to the buyer\u2019s account and cash is delivered to the seller\u2019s account. That\u2019s been the norm since 2017. Starting May 28, that cycle will take just one business day, or \u201cT+1.\u201d \u201cFor everyday investors who sell their stock on a Monday, shortening the settlement cycle will allow them to get their money on Tuesday,\u201d Gary Gensler, chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, said in a press release. \u201cIt will make our market plumbing more resilient, timely and orderly.\u201d These new rules will apply to stocks, bonds, municipal securities, exchange-traded funds, some mutual funds and limited partnerships that trade on an exchange. Broker-dealers and registered investment advisors will also have to follow new recordkeeping rules. Some investors say that a shorter cycle should help free up more liquidity in the market and reduce volatility in margins \u2014 the collateral traders have to show \u2014 since it reduces the chance of default before the transaction goes through. Clearinghouses, which sit between buyers and sellers, collect margins from traders as evidence that they can afford to make the transaction. \u201cAssuming everything goes well and we don\u2019t see any hiccups, the move towards T+1 will be an overall benefit to our ecosystem, institutional investors and retail [investors],\u201d said Rich Lee, head of program trading and execution strategy at Baird. Baird has had a T+1 committee in place since last summer to ensure such hiccups don\u2019t happen, Lee said. Employees have been in discussions with clients about how to assist them through the process. The company has also staffed up to handle their part in clearing trades with a shorter time frame. The shortened settlement cycle is partly in response to the 2021 meme stock frenzy, when investors on Reddit sent shares of GameStop and AMC Entertainment soaring to eye-popping heights in a short span of time. (Meme stocks typically trade less on fundamentals and more on social media frenzy.)  Robinhood and other brokerages in 2021 temporarily suspended buying of GameStop, AMC and other stocks on its platform, blaming in part the T+2 rule that pushed up collateral requirements imposed on brokers like Robinhood. Investors were left waiting for their trades and brokers with their cash locked up until the settlement, unable to allow more purchasing to ensure they had enough funds to cover the trades. \u201cThe existing two-day period to settle trades exposes investors and the industry to unnecessary risk and is ripe for change,\u201d Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev said in a February 2021 release. \u201cThere is no reason why the greatest financial system the world has ever seen cannot settle trades in real time.\u201d Boeing on track to meet FAA deadline to present quality control fixes Boeing will present its plan to fix quality problems with its assembly line to US regulators next week, the company said Thursday. The plan was ordered up by the Federal Aviation Administration in late February after a hole blew open in the side of an airborne 737 Max a month earlier, reports my colleague Gregory Wallace. The FAA said it audited the production line at Boeing and its key 737 Max supplier and found \u201cmultiple instances where the companies allegedly failed to comply with manufacturing quality control requirements.\u201d It gave Boeing 90 days to present a plan \u2014 and that deadline is next week. Boeing chief financial officer Brian West said Thursday that Boeing and the FAA have had \u201clots of dialogue\u201d including two check-ins during the preparation of the plan. \u201cThe engagement is constructive,\u201d he said at a conference organized by Wolfe Research on Thursday. \u201cI expect next week we\u2019re going to get some good feedback.\u201d FAA Administrator Mike Whitaker said separately on Thursday that the plan is \u201cnot the end of the process, it\u2019s the beginning.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a long road to get back to where they need to be making safe airplanes,\u201d Whitaker said in an interview on ABC News.

Meta created an AI advisory council that\u2019s composed entirely of White men Meta this week appointed a group of outside advisors to provide guidance on its artificial intelligence strategy. The four-person advisory group is composed entirely of White men, reports my colleague Clare Duffy. The tech giant said the group, which includes tech entrepreneurs and investors, will periodically consult with Meta\u2019s management \u201con strategic opportunities related to our technology and product roadmap.\u201d The move comes as Meta plans to invest tens of billions of dollars this year in AI infrastructure, research and product development. The council includes Patrick Collison, the co-founder and chief executive of financial technology company Stripe; Nat Friedman, the tech investor and former CEO of GitHub; Tobi L\u00fctke, the founder and CEO of online shopping firm Shopify; and Charlie Songhurst, the tech investor who formerly led corporate strategy and drove several key acquisitions at Microsoft. A Meta spokesperson confirmed the group will not be paid. Despite the group\u2019s significant combined experience, Meta is already taking heat for failing to include women or people of color \u2014 or anyone else outside of the wealthy, White, male, Silicon Valley mold \u2014 in a group advising one of the world\u2019s most powerful tech companies on a revolutionary new technology. The members of the group are also all in their 30s or 40s. The situation mirrors an incident last year at OpenAI when, in the wake of a leadership shakeup, it came under fire for appointing a board composed entirely of White men. Months later, OpenAI added three women directors to the board.

{"id": "2024_05_29_us_scottie-scheffler-court-hearing", "text": "All charges against Scottie Scheffler have been dismissed less than two weeks after the world No. 1 golfer was arrested trying to drive around the scene of a fatal crash on his way to the PGA Championship \u2013 and as video of the arrest aftermath emerged. Scheffler, 27, had been charged with felony second-degree assault on a police officer and the lesser charges of third-degree criminal mischief, reckless driving and disregarding signals from officers directing traffic, Jefferson County court records showed. \u201cBased upon the totality of the evidence, my office cannot move forward in the prosecution of the charges filed against Mr. Scheffler,\u201d County Attorney Mike O\u2019Connell said Wednesday in court. \u201cMr. Scheffler\u2019s characterization that this was, quote, a \u2018big misunderstanding,\u2019 close quote, is corroborated by the evidence.\u201d Jefferson County District Court Judge Anne Delahanty dismissed the matter with prejudice \u2013 meaning it cannot come up again \u2013\u00a0\u201cand it will be ripe for expungement within 60 days,\u201d\u00a0she said. Scheffler on Wednesday afternoon reiterated he believed the incident stemmed from a \u201csevere miscommunication in a chaotic situation\u201d and he held \u201cno ill will\u201d toward the detective who arrested him. \u201cI wish to put this incident behind me and move on, and I hope he will do the same,\u201d Scheffler said in a statement. \u201cPolice officers have a difficult job and I hold them in high regard.\u201d Scheffler and his attorney are \u201cpleased the case was dismissed today,\u201d lawyer Steve Romines told reporters outside court after the hearing. They had been prepared to litigate the case and also were preparing to file a civil suit that Scheffler no longer wants to pursue, Romines said, citing the cost to taxpayers. \u201cHe\u2019s glad it\u2019s over,\u201d Romines said of Scheffler, who lives in Texas and had permission to miss Wednesday\u2019s hearing. The case has faced close scrutiny since the arrest on the early morning of May 17. The arresting detective was disciplined for not turning on his body-worn camera at the time, and some officials had believed the charges should be reduced, police department sources told CNN. \u201cWe respect the County Attorney\u2019s decision, and we respect the judicial process,\u201d the department said Wednesday in a statement. Louisville Metro Police\u00a0Department \u201cwill remain focused on our mission to serve the city of Louisville and mitigate violent crime.\u201d Scheffler had been charged in connection with the incident that occurred while he was arriving at the Valhalla Golf Club. He was accused of dragging a police officer who was directing traffic after a fatal accident that claimed the life of 69-year-old John Mills, a worker with a vendor for PGA of America, the organizer of the PGA Championship. Scheffler has called the episode a \u201cbig misunderstanding,\u201d and Romines on Wednesday strongly denied the officer had been dragged. The golfer\u2019s arrest was a dramatic shakeup for the PGA Championship, given Scheffler \u2013 a new father who one golf writer described as an upstanding, \u201csqueaky clean\u201d player \u2013 was the overwhelming favorite on the heels of winning his second Masters title last month. He ultimately finished eight shots behind the winner, Xander Schauffele, for a share of eighth place. \u201cI did my best to leave that behind me and come out here and compete and do what I love, and the support I got from the fans was amazing,\u201d Scheffler told reporters May 19, following the tournament. \u201cI think they were cheering extra loud for me this week, and I got a lot of support from the players and caddies as well.\u201d Scheffler on Wednesday echoed that gratitude: \u201cI appreciate the support during the past two weeks and want to again encourage everyone to remember the real tragedy of May 17,\u201d he said. \u201cMy thoughts and prayers continue to be with John Mills and his family, and I hope to personally offer my condolences now that the case is over.\u201d Bodycam footage surfaces showing Scheffler at scene Wednesday\u2019s hearing unfolded as body camera footage surfaced showing an initial conversation Scheffler had with a law enforcement officer following his arrest at the scene. It appears to show an officer reading Scheffler his Miranda rights before questioning the golfer about the incident. Scheffler believed another officer had directed him around traffic to enter Valhalla Golf Club, he says. Then a different officer ordered him to stop. \u201cI did not know that he was a police officer,\u201d Scheffler says in the video of a man later identified as Louisville Det. Bryan Gillis. \u201cI thought he was one of the security guards,\u201d the golfer says, acknowledging he was \u201cmistaken.\u201d \u201cWhy does it matter if he\u2019s a security guard or a police officer,\u201d the officer asks, \u201cif somebody\u2019s telling you to stop?\u201d \u201cYes, you\u2019re right. I should have stopped,\u201d Scheffler says. \u201cI did get a little bit impatient because I\u2019m quite late for my tee time.\u201d \u201cAs he was reaching in the car, he grabbed my shoulder and hit me,\u201d the golfer continues, calling it a \u201clittle bit-over-aggressive.\u201d Scheffler says he was afraid because, \u201cI thought he was going to start hitting me, and I didn\u2019t know who he was. He didn\u2019t tell me he was a police officer. All I saw was a yellow jacket.\u201d The officer tells the golfer: \u201cWhat happened is, you kept going and you took him with you. He\u2019s a pedestrian, OK? So you took him with your car, and drug him, which is not a good thing, right?\u201d When Scheffler asks if he can speak with Gillis to explain himself, the officer says no. Asked Wednesday about the footage, Romines said it showed his client being \u201cinterrogated after the most stressful situation of his life,\u201d accusing the officer of asking the golfer \u201cleading questions.\u201d The footage, Romines said, shows the \u201cquality of (Scheffler\u2019s) character, by trying to diffuse the situation.\u201d \u201cHe didn\u2019t have to speak. But again, he asked to talk to the officer, he wanted to explain to him what happened,\u201d Romines said. The blurry footage is legitimate, a spokesperson for the Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg said. \u201cLMPD moved quickly to release footage of Mr. Scheffler\u2019s arrest on May 23rd, just days after the incident occurred,\u201d Scottie Ellis, the mayor\u2019s communications director, said Wednesday in a statement. \u201cAt the press conference where that footage was released, Mayor Greenberg stated that based on a request from the Jefferson County Attorney\u2019s Office, no other video would be released until the conclusion of the legal process,\u201d Ellis said. \u201cIt is unfortunate and very concerning that an individual leaked information that should have remained confidential until the completion of the investigation.\u201d CNN has reached out to Louisville police regarding the claim Scheffler was hit and asked leading questions. \u2018A very chaotic situation\u2019 The arrest unfolded around 6 a.m. on May 17, when Scheffler was trying to drive to the Valhalla Golf Club for the second round of the golf major and came upon heavy traffic near the scene of a fatal crash. Earlier in the morning, a pedestrian \u2013 Mills, whose family said he enjoyed working in security at Valhalla \u2013 was fatally struck by a bus while trying to cross the main road leading to the course, Louisville police spokesperson Dwight Mitchell said. As a result, police had an increased presence around the course\u2019s entrance. Scheffler \u2013 driving a marked player courtesy vehicle, according to ESPN \u2013 was trying to gain access to the course when he was stopped by an officer wearing a full police uniform and a yellow reflective rain jacket, a Louisville police report says. The officer, Detective Bryan Gillis, stopped Scheffler and attempted to give instructions. \u201cSubject refused to comply and accelerated forward, dragging Detective Gillis to the ground,\u201d the report states. The detective suffered pain, swelling and cuts to his left wrist and knee and was taken to a hospital for further treatment, the report states. His uniform pants, valued at about $80, \u201cwere damaged beyond repair,\u201d the report adds. At a news conference last week where video of the incident was released, Louisville Police Chief Jacquelyn Gwinn-Villaroel said the detective failed to turn on his body-worn camera and \u201ccorrective action for the policy violation\u201d has been taken. Scheffler was detained and arrested, but he was later released from jail and returned to the golf course for his tee time four hours later. Scheffler that day said he believed he was following officers\u2019 instructions, according to a statement shared on his Instagram account. Despite spending part of his morning in a jail cell and getting his mug shot taken in an orange jumpsuit, Scheffler played well May 17 and shot 5-under par, leaving him near the top of the leaderboard. But he struggled the next day, leaving himself with too much ground to make up to clinch a second consecutive major. As for his apparent legal troubles, the golfer was unsure what would come next, telling reporters on May 19, \u201cI think it\u2019s all up in the air.\u201d \u201cI think I\u2019m able to get home tonight but we\u2019ll see when I leave here,\u201d he said. \u201cI haven\u2019t really had much chance to assess the situation off the course.\u201d This is a developing story and has been updated.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/29/us/scottie-scheffler-court-hearing/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/30/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_05_29_politics_cybercrime-alleged-ringleader-arrest", "text": "A 35-year-old Chinese man has been arrested in Singapore, and millions of dollars in cars, watches and real estate have been seized as part of a blockbuster raid on a global cybercriminal network that defrauded the US government of billions of dollars, the Justice Department said Wednesday. The Chinese man, YunHe Wang, is accused of helping assemble a vast network of infected computers, known as a botnet, that was used to carry out bomb threats, send child exploitation materials online and conduct financial fraud, among other schemes,\u00a0the department\u00a0alleges. Fraudsters used the botnet to submit tens of thousands of fake applications for federal relief\u00a0during\u00a0the coronavirus pandemic, leading to losses of about $5.9 billion,\u00a0according to statements from the Departments of Justice and Treasury. The alleged cybercriminal conduct and the lavish lifestyle it funded \u201creads like it\u2019s ripped from a screenplay,\u201d Matthew Axelrod, a senior US Commerce Department official involved in the investigation, said in a statement. Law enforcement agents seized about $4 million worth of watches, sports cars and other luxury assets, including a Ferrari and Rolls-Royce, and $30 million in real estate properties across East Asia, the Middle East, the Caribbean and the US, Brett Leatherman, a senior FBI official, told reporters.\u00a0Wang used money he earned from renting the botnet to buy property in those locations, according to an indictment unsealed in the US District Court for the Eastern District of Texas. Authorities in Singapore and Thailand worked with the FBI on the bust, the Justice Department said. Court records did not list an attorney for Wang. Leatherman said the US government was pursuing his extradition to the US and that an investigation into other potential suspects was ongoing. Wang and other alleged members of the criminal network used virtual private networking (VPN) to spread their malicious code, infecting 19 million different IP addresses worldwide, including over 600,000 in the US, according to prosecutors. IP addresses are the unique numbers that correspond to individual devices on the internet. The new charges\u00a0are only the latest\u00a0alleged\u00a0example of\u00a0opportunistic fraud\u00a0that has been rampant across the US since\u00a0Covid-19\u00a0emerged more than four years ago. Fraudsters pounced\u00a0on opportunities to exploit\u00a0the more than $2 trillion federal economic stimulus package known as the CARES Act, a 2020 law that the botnet allegedly\u00a0targeted. The problem got so bad that the Secret Service\u00a0named\u00a0a senior official as National Pandemic Fraud Recovery Coordinator to try to claw back some of the many billions that were stolen. Such frauds are ongoing. The IRS\u00a0said in March\u00a0it had investigated tax and money laundering cases related to Covid-19 fraud potentially worth about $9 billion, with more than half that amount coming from cases opened in the last year.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/29/politics/cybercrime-alleged-ringleader-arrest/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/30/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_05_29_us_harvey-weinstein-ny-court-appearance", "text": "A Manhattan prosecutor said Wednesday a new indictment against Harvey Weinstein is possible as additional accusers have come forward with claims against the powerful Hollywood producer whose downfall became a symbol of the #MeToo movement. Assistant District Attorney Nicole Blumberg told Manhattan Supreme Court Justice Curtis Farber that prosecutors are \u201cactively investigating\u201d the claims by the new accusers and that \u201cnot all are ready to speak out.\u201d When the judge asked if there was a possibility of a new indictment against Weinstein, Blumberg said, \u201cYes, your honor.\u201d Prosecutors are assessing which claims fall under the statute of limitations, Blumberg said. \u201cWe need the survivors\u2019 identities protected,\u201d Blumberg told the court. \u201cThe survivors must feel comfortable.\u201d Wednesday\u2019s hearing ahead of Weinstein\u2019s retrial comes just over a month after the New York Court of Appeals \u2013 by a 4-3 vote \u2013 ruled the testimony of \u201cprior bad acts\u201d witnesses should not have been allowed because it \u201cwas unnecessary to establish defendant\u2019s intent and served only to establish defendant\u2019s propensity to commit the crimes charged.\u201d Weinstein, 72, was\u00a0convicted in 2020\u00a0of first-degree criminal sexual act and third-degree rape, and he was sentenced to\u00a023 years in prison. He has maintained his innocence and denied any nonconsensual sexual activity. On Wednesday, prosecutors again asked the court to remind Weinstein\u2019s lawyers not to make public statements disparaging potential witnesses \u201cthat could materially prejudice the case.\u201d Defense attorney Arthur Aidala, speaking outside court earlier this month, accused witness Miriam \u201cMimi\u201d Haley of lying to jurors about her \u201cfinancial interest\u201d in coming forward with the allegations. He said Haley will be cross-examined on the issue \u201cif she dares to come and show her face here.\u201d Aidala told the court Wednesday, \u201cIn 32 years no one has had to remind me of my ethical obligations.\u201d Aidala said his statements about Haley were \u201caccurate\u201d and that he was not trying to intimidate the witness. The next hearing was set for July 8 and Farber requested that prosecutors alert the defense if they pursue a new grand jury. The defense\u00a0told CNN\u00a0Weinstein may testify before the grand jury if that happens. Weinstein has remained behind bars because he was sentenced last year in Los Angeles to\u00a016 years in prison on charges\u00a0of rape and sexual assault. That trial similarly used \u201cprior bad acts\u201d witnesses and has also been appealed. He was one of the most powerful men in Hollywood and helped produce movies such as \u201cPulp Fiction,\u201d \u201cClerks\u201d and \u201cShakespeare in Love\u201d until a wave of women spoke publicly about the pervasiveness of sexual abuse and harassment in what became known as the #MeToo movement. The ruling overturning Weinstein\u2019s New York conviction led to a range of reactions, with his attorneys saying it confirmed their claim of an unjust trial and his accusers and their advocates calling the decision a step back in holding perpetrators of sexual violence accountable for their crimes. The New York charges were directly based on the testimony of Haley and Jessica Mann. Haley testified that Weinstein forcibly performed oral sex on her in 2006 at his Manhattan apartment, and Mann testified that he raped her in 2013 during what she described as an abusive relationship. In addition, three other women testified at trial as \u201cprior bad acts\u201d witnesses. Prosecutors sought to establish a pattern of abuse. The three women \u2013 Dawn Dunning, Tarale Wulff and Lauren Young \u2013 each said Weinstein used his influence to take advantage of them when they were young and hoping to break into the film industry. After Weinstein was convicted in New York, his attorneys\u00a0appealed the verdict. They argued the \u201cprior bad acts\u201d witnesses should not have been allowed to testify and the court should not have given prosecutors the ability to question Weinstein about instances of verbal abuse and bullying on cross-examination. Weinstein ultimately did not testify. The Court of Appeals agreed with the defense, ruling the trial court erred in admitting \u201cthe testimony of uncharged, alleged prior sexual acts against persons other than the complainants of the underlying crimes because that testimony served no material non-propensity purpose.\u201d The use of \u201cprior bad acts\u201d witnesses has\u00a0increased in recent years\u00a0with the rise of the #MeToo movement. In sexual assault cases, their testimony can turn a difficult \u201che said, she said\u201d case into a more convincing \u201che said, they said\u201d case. In general, evidence that the\u00a0defendant has poor character\u00a0or has done bad things in the past is not allowed at trial amid concerns the jury will be overly influenced by these prior incidents and may ignore actual evidence of the alleged crime.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/29/us/harvey-weinstein-ny-court-appearance/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/30/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_05_23_us_scottie-scheffler-arrest-update-louisville", "text": "Louisville police released two videos Thursday showing some of the arrest of star golfer Scottie Scheffler last week and announced the detective who arrested him was disciplined for not turning on his body-worn camera at the time. One video from a fixed pole camera positioned across the street shows portions of the interaction between Scheffler and police. In the video, a vehicle turns left and an officer wearing reflective gear runs toward the vehicle, which then stops. Police then take the driver out of the car and a group of three people walk across the street. A second video from a police vehicle\u2019s dashcam shows two officers walking with a handcuffed Scheffler. The videos were released a week after Scheffler was arrested, charged with felony assault, released from jail and then made his tee time in a whirlwind few hours at the PGA Championship, one of golf\u2019s four major tournaments. The world no. 1 golfer was attempting to drive to the Valhalla Golf Club in Louisville for the second round of the tournament at about 6 a.m. when he came to the scene of a fatal crash. He allegedly injured a police officer who was directing traffic and was arrested, according to police. Scheffler, 27, a new father with a sterling reputation, was charged with felony second-degree assault on a police officer, along with lesser charges of third-degree criminal mischief, reckless driving and disregarding signals from officers directing traffic, according to Jefferson County court records. After taking a mug shot and warming up in a jail cell, he was released and made it to his tee time at the golf club. He then shot 5-under that day on his way to finishing the tournament in a tie for 8th place. Scheffler described the incident as a \u201cbig misunderstanding\u201d during a \u201cchaotic situation.\u201d After the news conference Thursday, Scheffler\u2019s attorney, Steve Romines, reiterated the golfer still plans to plead not guilty to the charges. \u201cIt won\u2019t impact my case at all. Our position is the same as it was last Friday: Scottie Scheffler didn\u2019t do anything wrong. We\u2019re not interested in settling the case. We will either try it or it\u2019ll be dismissed. It\u2019s very simple,\u201d he said. \u201cAll the evidence that continues to come out just continues to support what Scottie said all along, this was a chaotic situation and a miscommunication and he didn\u2019t do anything wrong.\u201d High-ranking police officials in Louisville have privately voiced concerns a felony charge against Scheffler is excessive, a source familiar with the discussions told CNN. Prosecutors said Thursday they continue to investigate the case. \u201cThe Jefferson County Attorney\u2019s office has continued to receive evidence and has yet to conduct final interviews with investigators regarding the charges filed by LMPD against Mr. Scheffler,\u201d said Josh Abner, a spokesman for the office. \u201cAs we have stated previously, no decisions have been made and our review continues.\u201d Scheffler, meanwhile, teed off for his first round at the Charles Schwab Challenge in Fort Worth, Texas, on Thursday afternoon. Police discipline detective for not activating body-worn camera At a news conference Thursday, Louisville\u2019s mayor and police chief announced an internal investigation of the case led to discipline for the arresting officer, Detective Bryan Gillis. \u201cDetective Gillis should have turned on his body-worn camera, but did not,\u201d Police Chief Jacquelyn Gwinn-Villaroel said. \u201cHis failure to do so is a violation of the LMPD policy on uniforms and equipment, subject category body-worn camera.\u201d The police chief said Gillis did not have his body-worn camera \u201coperationally ready\u201d as required. The detective has received \u201ccorrective action,\u201d said the chief, who did not provide specifics about the discipline at the news conference. A Louisville police memo the department subsequently released Thursday said the detective \u201cwas counseled by a member of his command on May 22, 2024, and a performance observation was completed.\u201d The memo was among documents released related to the detective\u2019s failure to activate his body-worn camera. In one, Gillis explained he \u201cnever powered up\u201d the camera and described his own version of what happened. \u201cWhile directing traffic in front of Gate 1 the PGA personnel stopped a bus from entering Gate 1,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI observed a vehicle traveling in the opposing lanes coming at me. I stopped the driver and advised him he could not proceed because of the bus. He demanded to be let in, and proceeded forward against my directions. I was dragged/knocked down by the driver. I then proceeded to arrest the driver.\u201d Neither Mayor Craig Greenberg nor the police chief took questions from the media at Thursday\u2019s news conference. \u201cActivating body-worn cameras is critically important for our police department to have evidence, to maintain community trust, to be transparent,\u201d Greenberg said. Documents obtained by CNN show Gillis has a history of both reprimands and suspensions within the police department. Gillis, who began his service in 2007,\u00a0has received six reprimands throughout his time with Louisville police, a disciplinary history report shows.\u00a0He has also been suspended on five separate occasions. None of Gillis\u2019 prior suspensions involved failing to turn on his body-worn camera. Records also show Gillis has received several commendations during his career, including back-to-back Meritorious Unit Citations in 2019. The detective\u2019s longest suspension at five days stems from a 2012 incident in which\u00a0Gillis allegedly drove an \u201cintoxicated civilian\u201d in his police vehicle while doing \u201cdonuts\u201d in a business parking lot while his emergency lights were illuminated, according to a 2013 LMPD document. More recently, in 2021, Gillis received a written reprimand for pursuing \u201ca vehicle that did not commit a violent felony or wanted on a warrant,\u201d\u00a0documents show. Additionally, Gillis did not tell dispatchers he was engaging in a vehicle pursuit at the time, according to LMPD documents. The year prior, in 2012, he faced a four-day suspension for failing to appear in court on multiple occasions between 2010 and 2011. Documents show Gillis was also found \u201cat fault\u201d for three crashes, for which he received reprimands and mandatory driver\u2019s training. CNN has reached out to the Louisville Police Department for comment and was told \u201cas this matter is before the courts, commenting further on the participants (defendants, witnesses, and victims alike) is not appropriate for us to do.\u201d Gillis did not immediately respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment Friday. CNN has also reached out to\u00a0the River City Fraternal Order of Police Lodge 614, the union representing LMPD detectives, for comment on Gillis\u2019 past conduct. What we know about the arrest According to a Louisville Metro Police report, Scheffler was trying to drive into the golf course when he was stopped by an officer wearing a full police uniform and a yellow reflective rain jacket. The officer, identified as Gillis, stopped Scheffler and \u201cattempted to give instructions,\u201d the report states. \u201cSubject refused to comply and accelerated forward, dragging Detective Gillis to the ground,\u201d according to the report. The detective suffered pain, swelling and abrasions to his left wrist and knee and was taken to the hospital for further treatment, the report states. His uniform pants, valued at about $80, \u201cwere damaged beyond repair,\u201d the report adds. Romines, Scheffler\u2019s attorney, said the golfer was headed to the course early to prepare to play. \u201cDue to the combination of event traffic and a traffic fatality in the area, it was a very chaotic situation. He was proceeding as directed by another traffic officer and driving a marked player\u2019s vehicle with credentials visible,\u201d Romines said in a statement. \u201cIn the confusion, Scottie is alleged to have disregarded a different officer\u2019s traffic signals resulting in these charges.\u201d Multiple eyewitnesses have said Scheffler \u201cdid not do anything wrong\u201d but drove as directed, according to Romines. \u201cHe stopped immediately upon being directed to and never at any point assaulted any officer with his vehicle,\u201d the statement reads. ESPN\u2019s Jeff Darlington witnessed the encounter and filmed part of it. When Scheffler arrived in a marked player courtesy vehicle, he tried to drive around the crash scene on a median, according to ESPN. Darlington wrote on social media Scheffler \u201ccontinued to drive about 10 to 20 yards toward the entrance\u201d before stopping. \u201cThe police officer attempted to attach himself to Scheffler\u2019s car, and Scheffler then stopped his vehicle at the entrance to Valhalla,\u201d Darlington\u00a0wrote on X. \u201cThe police officer then began to scream at Scheffler to get out of the car. When Scheffler exited the vehicle, the officer shoved Scheffler against the car and immediately placed him in handcuffs.\u201d Police escorted a handcuffed Scheffler into a police vehicle, Darlington\u2019s video shows. \u201cRight now he\u2019s going to jail,\u201d an officer at the scene says in the video. Scheffler\u2019s arraignment was originally scheduled for Tuesday but was delayed to June due to his attorney\u2019s scheduling issue.

{"id": "2024_05_29_politics_trump-vp-dark-horse", "text": "In recent weeks, an increasingly familiar list of Republicans has dominated the not-very-subtle competition to become Donald Trump\u2019s running mate. Trump himself has added to the air of inevitability by floating these names in interviews and appearances over and over. But there\u2019s a steady drumbeat of speculation within Trump\u2019s orbit that the former president\u2019s flair for\u00a0the dramatic will at some point take over. Many around the campaign believe the lack of secrecy surrounding the open audition\u00a0raises the possibility Trump ultimately picks someone off the public\u2019s radar. \u201cHistorically, the more he says a name, the less likely it is to be that person,\u201d one adviser told CNN, but noted that they too were speculating. Trump has batted around the same names for months and many of them have spent their recent weeks making public demonstrations of their loyalty, appearing outside the Manhattan courthouse where Trump is on trial or defending him on television. When asked about his potential options in an interview last week, Trump responded, \u201cWe have so many, I don\u2019t want to do that,\u201d before rattling off several names frequently mentioned as likely contenders: former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, Ohio Sen. J.D.\u00a0Vance and Rep. Elise Stefanik. \u201cBut I could go on for quite a long time,\u201d he added. Trump has also routinely asked allies their thoughts on Gov. Doug Burgum of North Dakota and South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, both of whom have appeared at recent campaign rallies and regularly defend the former president on cable news. Still, a decision is unlikely until right before or at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee in July,\u00a0as Trump and his team try to build anticipation surrounding an announcement to maximize the political impact of the selection. Against that backdrop, the list of names under consideration seems to be growing, not shrinking. Trump\u2019s openness to feedback from donors, allies and advisers has also left room for those in his orbit to pitch their top choices to the former president and the media alike. In recent weeks, that has included new consideration for Florida Rep. Maria Elvira Salazar, Sens. Tom Cotton of Arkansas and Bill\u00a0Hagerty\u00a0of Tennessee,\u00a0former Hawaii Rep.\u00a0Tulsi Gabbard and even former South Carolina\u00a0Gov.\u00a0Nikki Haley. Within Trump\u2019s orbit, a growing number of influential voices have encouraged the former president to consider\u00a0picking a running mate who is Hispanic. The search for a potential bilingual running mate who could help make in-roads with a critical voting bloc has often centered on Rubio, the son of Cuban immigrants who regularly defends Trump in English and Spanish. But two sources with knowledge of these conversations said Salazar\u2019s name has circulated as well. Salazar, a respected television journalist for Univision before\u00a0winning a seat in Congress in 2020, provided a fierce defense of the former president while attending his hush money trial in New York. Salazar likened the legal case against Trump to the political prosecution remembered by the residents of her district, many of Cuban and Venezuelan decent. \u201cI am here of my own volition, I am not on the list of the favorites, I am not looking for a job and I paid for my own way,\u201d Salazar said outside the Manhattan courthouse, before echoing Trump\u2019s claims of political persecution. \u201cThousands of my constituents back in Miami are terrified when the courts in this country are used as weapons to crush our political enemies.\u201d Salazar and Trump interacted at Mar-a-Lago in recent months, a source familiar with their relationship told CNN. Salazar and her husband, Lester Woerner, a wealthy businessman based in Palm Beach, are friendly with members of the Trump family, the source added. Still, Salazar\u2019s relative inexperience would make her a bold, if not unlikely, dark horse to be first in line to the presidency. Salazar also faces the same\u00a0potential Florida residency\u00a0hurdle as Rubio.\u00a0While there is no law preventing a president and vice president of the US being from the same state,\u00a0Article II of the Constitution prevents electors\u00a0from voting for two people from the same state. The rule would be even more relevant in a close election, and the Trump campaign currently predicts that the 2024 race will be close, according to conversations with multiple Trump advisers. Cotton would bring more than a decade of Washington experience to the ticket \u2013 serving one term in the US House before being elected to the US Senate in 2014 \u2013 as well as a military background. Unlike his Senate colleagues who are regularly asked about running alongside Trump, Cotton had flown under the radar until The New York Times last week reported he had emerged as an unexpected contender for the job. A source confirmed Trump floated Cotton\u2019s name during a recent private dinner, surprising some of his guests. The source, though, also walked away from the interaction believing Trump is not close to landing on a running mate and isn\u2019t yet having serious conversations with his team to narrow the potential field of candidates. \u201cThis is all still in Trump\u2019s mind,\u201d the person said. Another source explained the interest in Cotton as stemming from Trump\u2019s willingness to hear from outside voices \u2013 in this case, allies of Cotton hoping to pique Trump\u2019s interest in the senator. One source in Trump\u2019s orbit insisted that Gabbard, a former Democratic presidential candidate,\u00a0remains under consideration. After the two met, Trump had indicated a strong affinity for Gabbard and her party switch has made her an intriguing surrogate to the former president. But she faces an uphill climb after voting to impeach Trump while in Congress \u2013 a fact he was recently reminded of by his aides, sources close to him said. Another name that\u2019s been floated privately is Tennessee\u2019s Hagerty. At a recent fundraiser in New York hosted by billionaire Howard Lutnick,\u00a0Hagerty\u00a0attended as a special guest alongside most of the Republicans regularly mentioned as top-tier veepstakes contenders. Doug Kaplan, president of Kaplan Strategies, released a poll in April on how potential running mates would fare with Trump in four swing states vs.\u00a0President\u00a0Joe Biden and\u00a0Vice President Kamala Harris. Hagerty was included in the poll (though his name was misspelled with two G\u2019s) along with\u00a0Florida\u00a0Gov. Ron DeSantis,\u00a0South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem,\u00a0Carson, Rubio\u00a0and\u00a0Vance. Kaplan told CNN he included Hagerty because he was \u201ctrying to think outside the box.\u201d \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have great name recognition,\u201d Kaplan said. But he added Hagerty is \u201csomeone Trump respects on foreign policy\u201d and is \u201cone of those do no harm guys.\u201d Others said they had only heard Hagerty\u2019s name floated for roles in a potential Trump administration including national security adviser and secretary of state. Hagerty previously served as ambassador to Japan under Trump. Earlier this year, Hagerty was spotted at Trump International Golf Club\u00a0in West Palm Beach with\u00a0the former president. A source close to Trump called it \u201csimply two friends having lunch.\u201d Some Republicans have privately \u2013 and even publicly \u2013 pitched Trump to assemble a team of rivals that would include Haley as his running mate. Despite having dropped out of the race months ago, Haley has continued to win a significant share of the vote in primary contests, including nearly\u00a017% of the vote last month in Pennsylvania, a critical general election battleground. She also won about 22% of the vote in Indiana\u2019s primary earlier this month, a surprising result in a traditionally red state. Trump himself has referred to Haley as \u201ctough\u201d and told one person recently that she put up a good fight during the contentious fight for the Republican nomination. Haley extended an olive branch last week when she said she would vote for the former president in her first public remarks since ending her own White House bid.\u00a0Still,\u00a0despite Trump\u2019s welcoming her support and indicating she could play a part in the campaign, the two have yet to speak. Republican Rep. Ralph\u00a0Norman of South Carolina, who endorsed\u00a0Haley\u00a0in the primary before switching his support to\u00a0Trump, said he believes she should be on the GOP ticket \u2014an argument he made to both Republicans. \u201cFor Nikki\u00a0Haley, in Indiana, to pull over 20% and not be on the ballot is amazing,\u201d\u00a0Norman told CNN. \u201cThat\u2019s why she would make a great VP candidate. And I made that pitch to President\u00a0Trump\u00a0and also to Nikki\u00a0Haley.\u201d Norman said that while\u00a0Haley\u00a0has not expressed interest in joining\u00a0Trump\u2019s ticket, he believes she would consider it. \u201cPolitics is an interesting game,\u201d\u00a0Norman said. \u201cPeople can forget the past and look forward to the future.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/29/politics/trump-vp-dark-horse/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/30/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_05_28_us_spirit-airlines-jamaica-flight-mechanical-issue", "text": "The cabin of a Spirit Airlines flight from Jamaica to Florida became a scene of panic and confusion Sunday when passengers were told to prepare for a possible water landing after the aircraft was turned around due to an apparent mechanical problem, a passenger told CNN. The Airbus plane, which was headed to Fort Lauderdale, reversed course and safely returned to Montego Bay, Jamaica, \u201cout of an abundance of caution following a suspected mechanical issue,\u201d the airline said in a statement.\u00a0The passengers were deplaned and later put on a different plane to reach their destination. The incident happened after a record-breaking start to the holiday weekend for airline travel. The Transportation Security Administration announced it set a new record for most travelers screened in a single day on Friday, according to a post from the agency on X. Passenger Bettina Rogers captured video of the plane\u2019s takeoff in which a chiming signal can be heard twice in the cabin, though the meaning of the signal is unclear. Shortly after the signal, the pilot told passengers there was \u201cnothing to be alarmed about,\u201d Rogers said. About five minutes later, the pilot informed passengers the plane needed to return to the Montego Bay airport, Rogers said. But as the plane turned back, she said, the pilot announced, \u201cPrepare for emergency water landing.\u201d \u201cIt was scary, and people were freaking out and panicking,\u201d Rogers said. After the flight landed safely, the cabin was full of nervous chatter and orange life vests scattered the floor and seats as passengers walked off the plane, video taken by Rogers shows. Passengers exited the plane \u201cunder normal procedures\u201d and a new plane was arranged to take them to Fort Lauderdale, Spirit said in its statement. Rogers was able to make it safely to her destination in Atlanta. \u201cSafety is our top priority, and the aircraft will be thoroughly evaluated by our maintenance team,\u201d the airline said. \u201cWe apologize to our Guests for any inconvenience.\u201d On Monday, a United Airlines flight aborted takeoff from Chicago O\u2019Hare International Airport due to what the Federal Aviation Administration said was a reported engine fire. Also Monday, a Southwest Airlines flight from Denver to Tampa, Florida, was diverted to Colorado Springs after the flight attendants reported \u201ca possible smell of smoke in the cabin,\u201d according to a Southwest statement. \u201cSouthwest flight 1070 diverted safely\u201d the airline said in a statement to CNN, apologizing for the inconvenience. \u201cThe flight crew followed established procedures, landed the aircraft and safely deplaned customers and Crew,\u201d the statement said. Some travelers have expressed a growing sense of unease due to a handful of harrowing aircraft accidents and as well as a string of smaller mishaps and mechanical incidents on planes \u2013 mostly Boeing jets. The midflight blowout of an Alaska Airlines plug door kicked off the year, which has also since seen several severe cases of turbulence, including on a Singapore Airlines flight from London last week that left one person dead and 71 injured. A series of less severe mishaps have also drawn the attention of travelers and air safety regulators. The Federal Aviation Administration announced in March that it\u2019s taking a close look\u00a0at United Airlines after nearly a dozen incidents on its Boeing jets, including a\u00a0missing external panel, flames shooting from an engine after takeoff and a wheel popping off. Though such incidents have raised concern, aviation experts have pointed out that commercial flights remain one of the safest ways to travel in the US. The last major fatal commercial plane accident in the United States was in 2009, and between 2010 and 2022, there have been five commercial flight accident deaths.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/28/us/spirit-airlines-jamaica-flight-mechanical-issue/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/30/2024", "section": "us"}}

The Colleton County Sheriff\u2019s Office had advised residents in a Facebook post Friday a primate was loose somewhere in the Walterboro area, 48 miles west of Charleston. The sheriff\u2019s office said the animal\u2019s owner was attempting to capture it and called in assistance. It is unclear right now how the monkey was captured or where it was found. \u201cThe outpouring of concern and information from Colleton County residents has been overwhelming and we are thankful for the public\u2019s support in helping to locate Bradley,\u201d the animal services news release read. \u201cWe so appreciate the community\u2019s support for animal welfare.\u201d The monkey, named Bradley, is a 15-year-old macaque who has lived in Walterboro for the past six years, according to animal services. \u201cAnimal Control and the Sheriff\u2019s Office have received numerous tips as to Bradley\u2019s location but because of the attention this situation has caused on social media and news channels, people who are trying to get a look at Bradley are sadly hampering the owner\u2019s efforts to catch him,\u201d animal services Director Laura Clark said. Professionals were hired to help reunite Bradley with his owner, Clark added. An image taken by Walterboro resident Tiffany Edenfield seems to show the primate standing in the grass. It has a red face, similar to some species of baboon and macaque monkeys. One Walterboro resident, Kordell Brabham, didn\u2019t believe his grandmother at first when she said she had spotted a \u201cmonkey\u201d in the yard. \u201cNana, I think you need to go inside, it may be a little too hot out here for you,\u201d Brabham said he told her. But soon after, he spotted the animal his grandmother was talking about. In a video shared with CNN, the escapee can be seen walking on top of a shed. Brabham was shocked and said the first thought running through his mind was, \u201cdon\u2019t get too close, that\u2019s a monkey.\u201d The animal eventually climbed down from the shed and went into a nearby yard, Brabham said. Residents had been advised not to approach the primate, which the sheriff\u2019s office said, \u201ccould be stressed,\u201d and only to report sightings. \u201cPlease monitor your pets while they are outside as a precaution,\u201d the sheriff\u2019s office added. The sheriff\u2019s office had received a report of the primate \u201cattempting to attack a resident\u2019s dog in a yard,\u201d according to South Carolina news station WLTX. It\u2019s unclear how the animal got loose or came to live in Walterboro, a city of over 5,000 people. South Carolina law says it\u2019s illegal to purchase or possess great apes \u2013 chimpanzees, gorillas and orangutans. But it is legal to keep other wild animals as pets, according to the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control.

{"id": "2024_05_29_us_chad-daybell-murder-trial-wednesday", "text": "Jury deliberations began Wednesday in the triple murder trial of Chad Daybell, a case Idaho prosecutors claim was fueled by power, sex, money and apocalyptic spiritual beliefs. Daybell has pleaded not guilty to murder and conspiracy charges in the\u00a0deaths of his first wife, Tammy Daybell, and the children of his second wife, Lori Vallow Daybell -\u2013 16-year-old Tylee Ryan and 7-year-old Joshua \u201cJJ\u201d Vallow. Authorities have said they\u00a0believe Tylee and JJ were killed in September 2019\u00a0\u2013 the month they were last reported to have been seen \u2013 and that Tammy Daybell was\u00a0found dead in her Idaho home on October 19, 2019, a\u00a0few weeks before Chad Daybell married Lori Vallow Daybell. Tammy Daybell was initially believed to have died in her sleep. Law enforcement found the remains of Tylee and JJ on Chad Daybell\u2019s Fremont County property\u00a0in June 2020, authorities said. The jury was read its instructions Wednesday morning before closing arguments. During closing arguments, Chad Daybell\u2019s lawyer, John Prior, said there wasn\u2019t enough direct evidence against Daybell and others were responsible for the deaths. If convicted, Daybell could face the death penalty. Vallow Daybell was convicted by a jury\u00a0in May 2023 of the murder of her children and was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. She also was convicted of conspiring to kill Tammy Daybell. Vallow Daybell has\u00a0appealed her convictions\u00a0to the state Supreme Court, with her legal team raising the issue of whether she was mentally competent to stand trial. Jurors concluded the first day of deliberations Wednesday evening and will resume at 8 a.m. Thursday. 2 children and a wife died weeks apart During opening statements, prosecutor Rob Wood\u00a0described Chad Daybell as a \u201cseemingly ordinary man\u201d who wrote books about the apocalypse, a person who \u201ccraves significance\u201d and worked as a sexton in a graveyard. \u201cTwo dead children buried in the defendant Chad Daybell\u2019s backyard,\u201d Wood said in his first words to the jury. \u201cThe next month his wife is found dead in their marital bed. Seventeen days after the death of his wife, Tammy Daybell, this defendant is\u00a0photographed laughing and dancing on a beach in Hawaii at his wedding to Lori Vallow, a woman who was his mistress and the mother of the children buried\u00a0in the graves on his property. Three dead bodies.\u201d When Daybell \u201chad a chance at what he considered his rightful destiny,\u201d Wood said, he \u201cmade sure that no person and no law would stand in his way.\u201d \u201cHis desire for sex, money and power led him to pursue those ambitions,\u201d the prosecutor added. \u201cAnd this pursuit\u00a0led to the deaths of his wife and Lori\u2019s two innocent children.\u201d Tylee Ryan was a \u201cnormal, vibrant teenage girl\u201d who loved her friends and her little brother JJ, who was on the autism spectrum and required special care, according to Wood. In October 2018, Chad Daybell and Vallow Daybell met at a religious conference in Utah and he began to craft an alternate reality where his \u201cobsession for glory was rooted in her adoration for him,\u201d Wood told jurors. Soon, Wood said, they viewed their spouses and even their children as \u201cobstacles\u201d that stood in their way. \u201cAnyone who opposed them were labeled sometimes as dark spirits or even zombies,\u201d the prosecutor said. During opening statements, Prior, the defense attorney, described his client as a religious man who wrote books about his faith, premonitions, good and evil, and the \u201ccoming of the end of things when his savior, in his mind, is going to come back.\u201d Prior said Daybell\u2019s life began to change after he met Vallow Daybell, a \u201cbeautifully stunning woman\u201d who \u201cstarts giving him a lot of attention\u201d and eventually lured him into an \u201cinappropriate\u201d and \u201cunfortunate\u201d extramarital relationship. Prior told the jury about Vallow Daybell\u2019s brother, Alex Cox, who died in December 2019, and his history of violence \u2013 including the shooting and killing of Vallow Daybell\u2019s former husband, Charles Vallow, in July\u00a02019. The Maricopa County medical examiner in Arizona said Cox died of natural causes,\u00a0CNN affiliate KPHO/KTVK\u00a0reported. \u201cAlex Cox was Lori\u2019s protector,\u201d Prior said. \u201cAlex Cox would do anything and everything to protect, aid and assist Lori Vallow \u2026 Whenever there was a problem or a threat to Lori Vallow, you will hear testimony that Alex Cox came to the rescue.\u201d DNA and forensics experts suggested Cox\u2019s fingerprint was found on plastic wrapped around JJ\u2019s body, Daybell\u2019s defense attorney said. No DNA or hair belonging to Chad Daybell was found with the children\u2019s bodies, and the exact cause of Tammy Daybell\u2019s death could not be determined, Prior said. Couple believed they were religious figures Chad Daybell and Vallow Daybell called themselves \u201cJames and Elaina\u201d and believed they were religious figures and had a system of rating people as \u201clight\u201d or \u201cdark,\u201d a prosecutor told jurors during Vallow Daybell\u2019s trial. The state accused the couple of using their \u201cdoomsday\u201d religious beliefs to justify the killings. In particular, Daybell and Vallow Daybell\u00a0exchanged texts about Tammy Daybell \u201cbeing in limbo\u201d and \u201cbeing possessed by a spirit named Viola,\u201d according to the indictment. People close to the couple\u00a0said they had been involved in strong religious ideologies. In addition, Daybell was connected to a religious\u00a0doomsday prepper website\u00a0which described itself as a \u201cseries of lecture events focusing on self-reliance and personal preparation.\u201d The publishers of the site said they decided to pull content featuring either Daybell or Vallow Daybell after the children\u2019s disappearance. The disappearance of the children made national headlines Vallow Daybell\u2019s two children from a previous marriage were last seen on different days in September 2019. In late November 2019, relatives asked police in Rexburg, Idaho, to do a welfare check on JJ because they hadn\u2019t talked to him recently. Police didn\u2019t find him at the family\u2019s house but did see Vallow Daybell and Daybell, who said JJ was staying with a family friend in Arizona, according to authorities. When police returned with a search warrant the next day, the couple was gone. They were ultimately found in Hawaii in January 2020. In June 2020, law enforcement officials found the remains of Tylee and JJ on Daybell\u2019s property in Fremont County, Idaho. Vallow Daybell and Daybell were indicted on murder charges in May 2021. Tylee was believed to have been killed between September 8 and 9, 2019, and JJ between September 22 and 23, according to prosecutors. After Vallow Daybell\u2019s indictment and not guilty plea in 2021, a judge ruled she was incompetent to stand trial, but she was deemed fit to proceed with trial after spending nearly a year in a mental hospital. Vallow Daybell has maintained her innocence. When Vallow Daybell was sentenced last year, she denied having killed her children and cited religious texts and beliefs. She said she had spoken to Jesus, her children and her husband\u2019s wife after their deaths and said they were \u201chappy and extremely busy\u201d in heaven. \u201cJesus Christ knows that no one was murdered in this case,\u201d Vallow Daybell said. \u201cAccidental deaths happen, suicides happen, fatal side effects from medications happen.\u201d Judge Steven W. Boyce said at the sentencing hearing: \u201cI don\u2019t believe that any God in any religion would want to have this happen.\u201d The judge said she justified the killings \u201cby going down a bizarre, religious rabbit hole. And clearly you are still down there.\u201d Vallow Daybell has appealed her convictions to the state Supreme Court, with her legal team raising the issue of whether Vallow Daybell was mentally competent to stand trial.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/29/us/chad-daybell-murder-trial-wednesday/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/30/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_05_24_us_sahana-ramesh-lawsuit-seattle-reaj", "text": "A 16-year-old in Bothell, Washington, suffered from a severe allergic reaction to medication\u00a0for months before\u00a0she collapsed and died in front of her parents. Her family alleges discrimination and negligence contributed to her death. The family of Sahana Ramesh filed a lawsuit\u00a0in Washington\u2019s King County Superior Court against Seattle Children\u2019s hospital, Children\u2019s University Medical Group and\u00a0several unnamed healthcare workers. Sahana\u00a0died from eosinophilic\u00a0myocarditis, an inflammation of the heart muscle,\u00a0in February 2021, according to the complaint. The lawsuit was first filed in 2022 by Sahana\u2019s parents Nalini and Anapathur Ramesh and their son,\u00a0Karthik,\u00a0and alleged negligence but was amended to include racial discrimination allegations,\u00a0according to court documents. Last week, King County Superior Court Judge Elizabeth Berns declined a motion brought by the hospital to dismiss the discrimination claim, court documents show. In her order, Berns wrote the family have \u201cplausibly alleged harm, including dignitary harm, resulting from unlawful discrimination \u2013 not from healthcare.\u201d In August\u00a02020, the family of South Asian descent sought medical treatment at Seattle Children\u2019s\u00a0because Sahana had recurring seizures, which led to a hospital neurologist\u00a0prescribing her lamotrigine, a drug used to prevent or control seizures, the suit says. Sahana\u2019s dosage was doubled shortly after she began taking it and increased by 50 percent that November. She then developed a\u00a0rash on several parts of her body including her hands, stomach, feet and face, the suit says. Within days, the rash worsened, and she was taken to the emergency department of Seattle Children\u2019s,\u00a0where she was diagnosed with a syndrome known as Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms or DRESS, according to the lawsuit. DRESS is a drug allergy that causes fever, rash, facial swelling, enlarged lymph nodes, kidney or liver injury, and in some cases inflammation of organs, according to the\u00a0American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology. Sahana was discharged after the diagnosis, but her symptoms didn\u2019t improve, her family claims in the suit. Over nearly three months, the family sought medical care from the defendants more than a dozen\u00a0times. During that time, her lab results also showed issues with her liver and organ function, the lawsuit says. But\u00a0the \u201cdefendants assured plaintiffs that Sahana could safely be cared for at home,\u201d according to the lawsuit. A spokesperson for Seattle Children\u2019s told CNN, \u201cOur hearts go out to any family mourning the loss of a child and we take our responsibility to provide equitable, high-quality care seriously, but cannot comment on this specific case due to pending litigation.\u201d CNN has reached out to Children\u2019s University Medical Group for comment. Steve Berman, an attorney for the Ramesh family, described Sahana\u2019s death as her family\u2019s \u201cultimate loss\u201d that could have been avoided. \u201cWe believe this was an avoidable tragedy that evidence shows was directly caused by negligence and lack of informed consent, rooted in widespread racism at the hospital,\u201d Berman said in a statement. The lawsuit points to several racial discrimination allegations made against the hospital, including claims that led to\u00a0a 2021 independent review\u00a0of equity, diversity and inclusion policies and practices. The review\u00a0concluded that allegations that a physician called another physician a racist epithet in 2009\u00a0were not adequately investigated by the hospital, and that there was a lack of action to minimize racial disparities in security calls, among other findings, according to a\u00a0summary made public by the hospital. In the lawsuit, attorneys for the family said their clients felt\u00a0ignored and dismissed during their interactions with medical staff and felt \u201cthat they were not welcome, accepted, desired, or solicited at SCH.\u201d The family also alleges in the lawsuit that hospital staff didn\u2019t monitor Sahana\u2019s heart and failed to inform them of the risk of cardiac failure related to DRESS. The Ramesh family requests an unspecified amount of damages.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/24/us/sahana-ramesh-lawsuit-seattle-reaj/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/30/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_05_27_us_bill-walton-death", "text": "Bill Walton, the basketball Hall of Fame center who won two national titles at UCLA, two NBA championships in Portland and Boston and later put the \u201ccolor\u201d in color commentator, died Monday following a prolonged battle with cancer, the NBA announced. Walton was 71. He was surrounded by his family, according to the NBA. \u201cBill Walton was truly one of a kind,\u201d NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said in a statement. \u201cAs a Hall of Fame player, he redefined the center position. His unique all-around skills made him a dominant force at UCLA and led to an NBA regular-season and Finals MVP, two NBA championships and a spot on the NBA\u2019s 50th and 75th Anniversary Teams. \u201cBill then translated his infectious enthusiasm and love for the game to broadcasting, where he delivered insightful and colorful commentary which entertained generations of basketball fans. \u201cBut what I will remember most about him was his zest for life. He was a regular presence at league events \u2013 always upbeat, smiling ear to ear and looking to share his wisdom and warmth. I treasured our close friendship, envied his boundless energy and admired the time he took with every person he encountered.\u201d Walton\u2019s basketball journey began at UCLA, where the 6-foot-11, red-headed center starred under legendary coach John Wooden and led the Bruins to national championships in 1972 and 1973, both in perfect 30-0 seasons. In the \u201973 title game, Walton took 22 shots and missed only one, scoring a championship contest-record 44 points. The team at one point won 88 straight games, a men\u2019s record that still stands. In each of his three varsity seasons, Walton was the national college player of the year and an All-American. Still, Walton and Wooden repeatedly clashed over cultural and political issues, including over Walton\u2019s long hair and his protests against the Vietnam War. In May 1972, Walton was arrested at an antiwar demonstration in the Los Angeles campus. According to a post on the UCLA Library Facebook page, it was Wooden who bailed him out. The big man with the nifty hook shot was the No. 1 pick in the 1974 NBA Draft by the Portland Trail Blazers and led the team to its only NBA championship in 1977. He was named the NBA Finals Most Valuable Player in that playoffs, and the next season he was named the NBA\u2019s regular season MVP. His political remarks made him a controversial figure. In April 1975, Walton called for the rejection of the US government and referred to the FBI, who once questioned him, as \u201cthe enemy,\u201d according to coverage in the New York Times. Hundreds of fans called for him to be traded and team management denounced his statement but kept him on the roster. Walton\u2019s career was derailed due to a series of injuries. He left Portland to play for the San Diego/Los Angeles Clippers from 1979 to 1985 but never reached the heights of those earlier seasons and struggled through foot and knee injuries, which led to almost 40 orthopedic surgeries in his life by his count. He then joined the Boston Celtics, where he rejuvenated his career and in 1986 won the NBA Sixth Man of the Year award as a reliable backup to stars Robert Parish and Kevin McHale. Together, the group won the NBA title in 1986 over the Houston Rockets, the second of Walton\u2019s career. UCLA legend and NBA rival Kareem Abdul-Jabbar said Monday the world feels much heavier with the death of his \u201cgreat friend.\u201d \u201cOn the court, Bill was a fierce player, but off the court he wasn\u2019t happy unless he did everything he could to make everyone around him happy,\u201d he said. \u201cHe was the best of us.\u201d Walton was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1993. From playing to broadcasting Despite growing up with a stutter, Walton went on to a successful broadcasting career as a sometimes outlandish commentator for both NBA and NCAA basketball games, most recently working for ESPN. He was known for bringing a sense of joy, wonder and wackiness to his coverage of the game. A well-known fan of the Grateful Dead, he was often seen wearing tie-dye shirts and sprinkled references to the band in his coverage. He once said on a broadcast, \u201cCome on, that was no foul! It may be a violation of all the basic rules of human decency, but it\u2019s not a foul.\u201d On another: \u201cA lot of people understand what not saying anything means, so, in effect, not saying anything is really saying a lot.\u201d He also liked to flash his intelligence. According to Awful Announcing, one of his best quotes was: \u201cYesterday we celebrated Sir Isaac Newton\u2019s discovery of gravity. Today, Fabricio Oberto is defying it.\u201d He struggled with the consequences of all those injuries, and in 2016 told David Axelrod on the CNN podcast \u201cThe Axe Files\u201d that back pain nearly drove him to suicide in 2008. \u201cWhen you\u2019re in that space, more people commit suicide from back pain than from any other malady. It\u2019s just overwhelming. It destroys every aspect of your life. It destroys every aspect of all the people around you,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd here\u2019s this situation where I had nothing, but then I had this surgery and I\u2019m all better. I take no medication. I have no pain. I go full speed ahead now. I\u2019ve never been busier. I\u2019ve never been happier. I haven\u2019t been this healthy since I was 13 years old. In all these years I never thought that I\u2019d be free of pain, I never thought that I\u2019d be happy in love, and I have both of those today. I am the luckiest guy on earth.\u201d He also told Axelrod how he dealt with his stutter. \u201cI could not say hello. I could not say thank you. I could not say a single word without just, the stammer, the stutter, the hesitation, and I just could not express myself,\u201d he said. \u201cI express myself through\u00a0sports.\u00a0I express myself to reading. I express myself through just being a part of a bigger world that I only dreamed I could ever be a part of.\u201d Famed announced and former track star Marty Glickman helped Walton work through his speech impediment when Walton was 28. \u201cHe took me over in the corner. We stood behind a potted plant and in five minutes, he just laid it out. Bam! Bam! Bam! This is how you learn how to talk,\u201d he said. In the wake of Walton\u2019s death, Axelrod praised Walton was more than a basketball player. \u201cHe was an all-world human being, with a huge heart and infectious enthusiasm for life. He lived through intolerable pain and yet, as an announcer, managed to lift our burdens and make us smile,\u201d he posted on X. UCLA men\u2019s basketball coach Mick Cronin offered his condolences and praised Walton\u2019s legacy in a statement. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to put into words what he has meant to UCLA\u2019s program, as well as his tremendous impact on college basketball,\u201d he said. \u201cBeyond his remarkable accomplishments as a player, it\u2019s his relentless energy, enthusiasm for the game and unwavering candor that have been the hallmarks of his larger than life personality.\u201d Walton is survived by his wife, Lori, and four boys, all of whom played college basketball. Luke Walton won two NBA titles with the Los Angeles Lakers, meaning he and his dad were the first father-son combination with multiple NBA rings. Bill Walton\u2019s brother Bruce, who died in 2019, played in the Super Bowl with the Dallas Cowboys in January 1976, and they were the first siblings to play in NFL and NBA championship games.

Nile Taylor pleaded not guilty Monday to two counts of first-degree attempted assault, two counts of second-degree assault, and three counts of second-degree menacing, according to a complaint by the Manhattan District Attorney\u2019s Office.
