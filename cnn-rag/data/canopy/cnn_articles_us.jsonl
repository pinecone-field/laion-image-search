{"id": "2024_07_20_business_unmarried-couples-living-together-questions-to-ask", "text": "Taking your romantic relationship to the next level \u2014 sharing a home \u2014 is a big deal in so many ways. If you opt to live together instead of marrying, you may think you\u2019re saving money (e.g., no wedding!) and keeping your financial and legal independence from each other. In some ways you may be. But there are a lot of financial and legal considerations that you both should hash out before calling the movers. That is especially the case for couples over 50 \u2014 for whom living together may seem the easier option if they have already had long-term marriages. \u201cMy research has shown that following a gray divorce, women and men are more likely to form a cohabitation than a remarriage, signaling that cohabitation is gaining ground among older adults these days,\u201d said sociology professor Susan Brown, director of the\u00a0National Center for Family & Marriage Research at Bowling Green State University. An analysis of federal data by the Pew Research Center found that in 2016, couples over 50 represented roughly a quarter of adults living together. Those in this age group \u2014 far more than couples in their 20s and 30s \u2014 have already lived complex lives, raised families and saved for and envisioned retirement. They also, much to their chagrin, are more likely to develop health problems during their relationships from hereon out. But while some concerns may be more urgent for older couples, here are some key questions couples of any age should consider when deciding to live together: 1. What are the numbers we\u2019re working with? Mari Adam, a certified financial planner and founder of the educational consultancy Mari Talks Money, recommends partners know the financial basics about each other. This includes your income, assets, debts and credit scores. It also includes what kind of health, disability and long-term care insurance you have. And don\u2019t forget to share with your partner whether and how much you owe in alimony and child support. Surprises and secrets are never welcome in this regard. If you\u2019re the person receiving alimony or child support, figure out the potential consequences of living together on your eligibility for those payments. Every state has its own rulebook. So check in with a divorce attorney. \u201cThere can be all sorts of gotchas,\u201d Adam said. In terms of Social Security benefits, if you are divorced or widowed, you may be entitled to benefits based on your former spouse\u2019s earnings records. But the rules may change if you remarry, based on your age. If, however, you are just cohabitating, that isn\u2019t likely to interfere with your getting those benefits if you\u2019re otherwise eligible, said Steven Rubin, a certified elder care attorney at the firm Drazen Rubin Law. 2. Who pays for what? Figuring out how much each of you will pay for joint living expenses is a conversation worth having, if only to ward off potential resentments in the future. Adam has counseled people to find \u201cfair and equitable\u201d solutions. For some, that may mean splitting expenses 50/50. But for others that may not make sense. For example, if you make three times as much as your partner, you might decide to pay on a proportional basis, with each contributing the same percentage of your incomes for common expenses. Here\u2019s what that can look like: 10% of a $75,000 income ($7,500) is three times less than 10% of $225,000 ($22,500). Beyond dollars and cents, you also might consider what each partner brings to the table in terms of living together \u2014 whether it\u2019s cooking, cleaning, home repairs or taking charge of your social life as a couple. \u201cI\u2019ve seen friends and clients where the woman has money and [her male partner] doesn\u2019t. She pays all the house expenses and he is the handyman,\u201d Adam said. If your partner owns their home and you move in to that house, consider that the financial benefits of anything that improves the home\u2019s value \u2014 such as a new roof or a kitchen renovation \u2014 will only accrue to your partner, since you are not a co-owner, even though you will both enjoy the day-to-day benefits of living in an improved space. \u201cYou can solve anything. But you have to be willing to talk about it and be fair-minded about it,\u201d Adam said. \u201cThere is no one right answer.\u201d She also recommends a \u201cyours, mine and ours\u201d approach to bank accounts. \u201cIt is important to keep money separate \u2014 especially when you have kids. But have a joint account that both parties put money into [for joint living, traveling and entertaining expenses].\u201d 3. What happens if one of us gets sick? No one wants to contemplate this question. (Even writing about it is unpleasant.) But discussing it ahead of time can lessen some of the stress, should a situation arise when a partner gets sick and requires chronic care or becomes terminally ill, Rubin said. Discuss whom each of you wants to legally give a durable power of attorney to \u2014 that is the person you designate to manage your finances if you become incapacitated. Also discuss who you want to be your health care proxies. A medical proxy is the person who will make medical care decisions for you if you become unable to do so for yourself. And make clear how much and what types of medical intervention you want if you become terminally ill \u2014 that is something a proxy will be charged with respecting, even if the person\u2019s family is pushing for something different. All these wishes should be executed through a durable power of attorney form and what is sometimes called an advance health directive or living will. And if your partner is not your chosen health care proxy, include a medical release form in your health care directive naming them as someone who you, essentially, want by your side during a health crisis. \u201c[T]hat will allow doctors and hospitals to communicate with your partner, even if the partner is not the decision maker,\u201d Rubin said. \u201cI also list this in the advance directive that they want the person to have full visitation rights and the decision maker has a fiduciary responsibility to ensure your wishes are met.\u201d 4. What do you want to happen to your assets when you die? While everyone should have a will spelling out how they want their assets to be distributed, it\u2019s especially important for unmarried couples to do so since the law typically confers a lot of automatic benefits to marital spouses and a person\u2019s children than to one\u2019s live-in partner. If one or both of you have kids, both partners need to be clear about how the children and the surviving partner will (or won\u2019t) be provided for in the estate. One concern, for example, may be what happens to the home you share when one of you dies? If you own it jointly, who will inherit the deceased partner\u2019s share? If the person who dies is the sole owner, who will inherit the property? If it\u2019s not the live-in partner, then do you want to have a provision where the partner can stay in the home for a given period of time? All that can be addressed by setting up a trust for the asset, Rubin said. One area where things can get tricky with the home, Rubin said, is if the person who owns the house needs expensive long-term care and tries to qualify for Medicaid, which requires them to have very few assets. Even if the home is jointly owned with one\u2019s live-in partner, the state may or may not require that the home be sold before the sick partner can qualify and if it\u2019s sold then their significant other has to move out. If you were married, Rubin said, the property would be treated as exempt for benefit purposes. That\u2019s why he always counsels couples moving in together to contemplate these kinds of scenarios ahead of time. \u201cThe best thing you can do is plan,\u201d Rubin said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/20/business/unmarried-couples-living-together-questions-to-ask/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/21/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_07_19_business_disneyland-workers-strike-authorization", "text": "Cyn Carranza buffs, cleans, waxes and scrubs Disneyland floors starting at midnight, so that guests coming the next morning feel as if no one had been there before them. But after her shifts working near a sparkling Sleeping Beauty Castle, she went \u201chome\u201d to a car, for about four months last year, because her wages, plus earnings at two other jobs, weren\u2019t enough to afford renting a place with a bed. Now, negotiating better wages and working conditions for Carranza and thousands of other Disneyland employees has gotten messy, to the point where thousands overwhelmingly voted Friday to authorize a potential strike. Now that the vote has passed, it\u2019s up to union leadership to decide whether to hold one. It would be the first at Disney\u2019s original resort in 40 years. \u201cToday Disneyland Park cast members made their voices heard by voting to authorize the Disney Workers Rising bargaining committee to call for a strike to protest unfair labor practices by 99%,\u201d UFCW Local 324 said in a statement. \u201cWe stood up and showed Disney that we won\u2019t sit by and allow them to intimidate, surveil and unlawfully discipline cast members for exercising their rights.\u201d Disneyland Resort spokesperson Jessica Good told CNN in an email late Friday that it remains committed to reaching an agreement. \u201cWe greatly appreciate the important roles our cast members play in creating memorable experiences for our guests, and we remain committed to reaching an agreement that focuses on what matters most to them while positioning Disneyland Resort for growth and job creation,\u201d Good said. \u201cMaster Services Council\u2019s strike authorization is not unusual as part of a negotiations process, and we look forward to continuing discussions at upcoming meetings on Monday, July 22 and Tuesday, July 23. A strike date has not been scheduled, and Disneyland Resort continues to welcome guests.\u201d Disneyland officials previously said that there are plans in place that would allow the parks to continue operating with the same expected level of service, in the event of a strike. Union leaders said if the strike happens, it would likely be of limited duration, unlike open-ended strikes by actors\u2019 and writers\u2019 unions that halted film and TV productions at Disney and other media and tech companies for much of 2023. Strike authorization votes are common, and they typically pass by overwhelming margins. But that does not mean a strike will necessarily happen, as was the case with Teamsters at UPS last year. While this potential strike would officially be about Disney not allowing union buttons to be worn at work, the\u00a0underlying concern among rank-and-file workers is about the current contract that many say does not provide a livable wage. A dream of affordability Carranza \u2018s Disneyland wage is just over $20 per hour, after factoring in a differential for working the overnight shift. Her work is laborious, often dragging 600 feet of PVC hose and working with heavy machinery to buff the floors. \u201cIt\u2019s upsetting that the balloons that we sell in the park are more expensive than [what] I\u2019m making an hour. I have to work an hour and a half if I want to afford one of those Disney balloons,\u201d Carranza said. As of April 1, California\u2019s minimum wage for fast food workers is $20 per hour, which has affected other industries competing for the same workers. Voters in the city of Anaheim in Orange County, CA, where the Disneyland Resort is located, had previously approved a measure that required the resort\u2019s employees to make a $19.90 minimum wage as of January of 2024. But in a county where the 2022 median rent was $2,251 a month, and where about 10% of residents live in poverty, workers said a wage of about $20 an hour is still not enough. After Carranza lived in a car, she moved into a hotel because she could not afford a security deposit or first and last months\u2019 rent for an apartment. Today, she shares an apartment with a roommate. Change at the Disneyland Resort \u2013 and in affordability in Southern California in general \u2013 has been deeply troubling for Coleen Palmer, who has seen been at Disneyland Resort for 37 years. When she first started, Palmer says she was able to rent a $400 a month two-bedroom apartment by herself on the around $650 per month wages she earned. Today, she\u00a0rents a one-bedroom apartment for just a little over $2000 a month, and limits the groceries she buys on the $2800 she says she takes home every month. Then there\u2019s utilities, food, a phone bill, medical care, and other fixed costs. She doesn\u2019t travel anywhere besides work in order to save on gas, and buys items like chicken that can be shared with her dog. \u201cIt does feel very defeating at times. It makes me question my self-worth. And there are times when I think to myself, is it worth it? Should I go somewhere else? But I am a few years away from retirement,\u201d Palmer said. She said she wants to stick it out, especially because she loves the job. She loves talking to kids about what they\u2019ve been doing around the park and telling them they\u2019ve been brave to try the thrill rides. Palmer is happy to see the lowest wage earners get an increase due to the city\u2019s minimum wage laws. But those earning slightly more, with decades of experience, did not get a raise. Palmer said she makes just under $24 an hour after nearly four decades, while an entry-level employee makes $19.90 an hour. Disneyland officials said wages are up more than 40% in the last five years. But much of that increase has followed changes in the state and local minimum wage. Escaping reality, not confronting it A strike would involve about 9,500 employees who work at Disneyland Park, currently under a contract that expired in June. Another 4,500 employees in the same bargaining group work at the Downtown Disney retail and dining district, the Disney hotels, or the resort\u2019s other theme park, Disney California Adventure. Their contract expires in September, and they are not part of the current strike developments. Together, they represent about 40% of the entire resort\u2019s employees. But only the Disneyland Park employees will vote and participate in a strike for now. The unions and Disneyland have two more meetings scheduled on Monday and Tuesday. These groups do not include the character and parade performers who organized in May as part of Actors\u2019 Equity Association and have yet to start their bargaining process. Officially, this potential strike would be over union buttons depicting a raised Mickey fist. SEIU-USWW, Teamsters Local 495, UCFW Local 324 and BCTGM Local 83 filed charges with the National Labor Relations Board against Disney in June for what they say are hundreds of instances of unlawful discipline, intimidation and surveillance of union members wearing these buttons at work. The NLRB is expected to investigate the charges over the next few months, after which a regional NLRB director could decide if the case merits a hearing. Disneyland officials told CNN the wearing of union buttons goes against the parks\u2019 uniform policy and that only a \u201chandful\u201d of employees have been disciplined. Disneyland officials said in a statement that the parks strive to give guests \u201can uninterrupted,\u202fimmersive experience,\u201d and that \u201canything that distracts from the\u202fshow or story, be it a\u202fnon-approved\u202fbutton, pin or sticker worn by a cast member, would be addressed by a leader.\u201d The term \u201ccast member\u201d refers to any Disney employee, as the company treats any experience in front of a guest as a performance. Every employee works toward creating a space where guests escape reality and suspend disbelief, to feel as if they are truly on a Star Wars planet, for example. For the same reason, cast members are not allowed to refer to humans underneath character costumes, because this would break the fa\u00e7ade. Disney\u2019s policy is that a leader would ask the employee to remove the union button to maintain the integrity of the \u201cshow.\u201d Only\u202frepeated violations\u202fwould warrant any\u202fdisciplinary\u202faction, starting with a verbal warning.

{"id": "2024_07_18_us_samantha-woll-case-update", "text": "Jurors returned mixed verdicts Thursday in the trial of a man accused of killing Detroit synagogue president Samantha Woll at her home. Michael Jackson-Bolanos, 29, faced four charges. Jurors deadlocked on the charges of felony murder and home invasion. They found him not guilty of premeditated murder but found him guilty of lying to a police officer. A pretrial hearing on the two deadlocked counts has been scheduled for noon on July 25. Prosecutors could decide to not retry the case but did not immediately comment after the jury\u2019s findings Thursday. The trial, which lasted over a month, was complicated by the replacement of a juror this week. It also included stunning testimony from Woll\u2019s ex-boyfriend Jeffrey Herbstman, who initially told police he \u201cmay have murdered my girlfriend\u201d \u2013 but later testified he had nothing to do with Woll\u2019s death. Defense attorney Brian Brown said his client was frustrated with the verdict. \u201cWe feel that the jury should have come back with a not guilty on the felony murder and also the home invasion first degree. They got it right on the premeditated murder,\u201d Brown said. \u201cMy guy is innocent. You know, there\u2019s no point of going through this all over again.\u201d Brown said there \u201cwas zero evidence that would have put my client inside the home. He never went inside.\u201d The attorney said he was \u201cstill scratching my head\u201d on the deadlocked home invasion count. Wayne County Prosecutor Kym Worthy, in a statement, thanked the jury for its dedication and said her office had been \u201chopeful that a decision could be reached today.\u201d Worthy added, \u201cWe will press on for justice for the Wolls and will determine our next course of action at the pre-trial hearing.\u201d What we know about the attack Woll was the 40-year-old board president of the Isaac Agree Downtown Synagogue in Detroit. The night before her body was found, Woll attended a wedding and appeared normal, police said. She returned home shortly after midnight, and there were no signs of forced entry at her home. A prosecutor told jurors that Woll left her door open, which led to a tragic encounter. In the early morning hours of October 21, 2023, Woll\u2019s body was found fatally stabbed outside her home. Authorities believe she stumbled outside after she was attacked. A medical examiner determined Woll died from \u201cmultiple sharp force wounds with a straight-edge cutting instrument,\u201d Worthy\u2019s office said in a news release. Authorities have said they believe Jackson-Bolanos did not know Woll, and the Wayne County prosecutor has said there was no evidence suggesting the killing was a hate crime. But blood evidence indicated Jackson-Bolanos was the killer, Wayne County Assistant Prosecuting Attorney Ryan Elsey said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t catch him until close to six weeks after her death. But when they did, he still had her blood on a jacket that he wore that night and on a backpack that he wore that night,\u201d Elsey told jurors.\u00a0 Prosecutors accused Jackson-Bolanos of entering Woll\u2019s home and stabbing her multiple times. He also \u201clied to the police by making statements he knew were false and misleading relating to the investigation of the case,\u201d prosecutors said in December. When Jackson-Bolanos was interrogated by Detroit police last year, he insisted he did not know Woll or have any involvement in her death. \u201cI don\u2019t know this woman. I don\u2019t know anything about this woman except when it popped up on the news, bro. That\u2019s it,\u201d Jackson-Bolanos said, according to CNN affiliate WDIV. \u201cThe only thing I know that I was in the wrong place at the wrong time.\u201d In his opening statement, Brown said clues at the scene indicate his client did not kill Woll during a home invasion. \u201cYes, Samantha Woll tragically died on October 21st. However, it was not Michael Jackson-Bolanos who did this. She was stabbed eight times in the neck, in the back of the head, in the back of the neck. To me, that would indicate a crime of passion. This wasn\u2019t just some random person walking into her house, trying to steal anything,\u201d Brown told jurors. \u201cNothing of value was taken from her house. She had valuables. Her purse was in plain view. Credit cards, cell phone, laptops \u2013 plain view,\u201d Brown said. \u201cIf anybody came into this particular house to steal something and to stab her eight times, surely they would have taken something of value.\u201d Ex-boyfriend explains why he once believed he \u2018was responsible for her death\u2019 The case took a bizarre turn when Woll\u2019s ex-boyfriend Herbstman, who previously told police he may have killed Woll but did not remember, took the stand. Herbstman said he dated Woll from August 2022 to July 2023, when the pair broke up amicably. The ex-boyfriend, who said he was diagnosed with depression at least a decade ago, became despondent after learning about Woll\u2019s death last October. \u201cI was devastated \u2026 There were days that I couldn\u2019t get out of bed,\u201d Herbstman testified. Around October, he wasn\u2019t getting relief from one of his usual medications for depression, \u201cso my psychiatrist recommended that I try a new medication\u201d \u2013 starting with a small dose and gradually scaling it up, Herbstman testified. On November 7, Herbstman was on a work trip in Kalamazoo \u2013 about 140 miles west of Detroit \u2013 when he suffered a panic attack in his car. He said he had recently increased the dosage of his new antidepressant and had also smoked cannabis. \u201cMy thoughts began racing \u2026 I couldn\u2019t stop worrying about things,\u201d Herbstman testified. \u201cI began to believe that I was responsible for her death \u2013 that I had somehow killed her and didn\u2019t remember doing it,\u201d Herbstman said. \u201cAnd I couldn\u2019t shake that feeling. And it was disturbing to the extreme.\u201d He called 911, and an officer arrived with her body-worn camera on. In the footage, which was played in court, Herbstman told police: \u201cI\u2019m having a panic attack. \u2026 I may have murdered my girlfriend, and I don\u2019t remember it.\u201d During his testimony last month, Herbstman said he had nothing to do with Woll\u2019s death. He said he stopped taking the new medication immediately after the panic attack and had not had a similar episode since. The ex-boyfriend was eventually cleared as a suspect. Elsey told jurors that \u201cpolice did not find any evidence placing\u201d Herbstman at the scene or any evidence that he left his home that night. The prosecution said Herbstman was granted \u201cuse immunity\u201d during the trial. \u201cThat means that for this time that you\u2019re sitting in this witness chair that anything you say can\u2019t be used against you in a subsequent criminal proceeding,\u201d Elsey told Herbstman. Why the jury had to restart deliberations The trial, which began in early June, lasted longer than initially anticipated. Van Houten said jurors had been asked to be available through July 3, but deliberations did not begin until July 9. Jurors had to restart deliberations Tuesday after one juror had to leave for a pre-scheduled vacation, CNN affiliate WDIV reported. That juror was replaced with an alternate juror, and the original juror\u2019s comments and opinions about the evidence had to be tossed out as deliberations restarted from scratch.

{"id": "2022_01_14_us_gang-members-charged-arroyo-shooting", "text": "Federal prosecutors charged three alleged gang members and one alleged gang associate Thursday in the fatal shooting of off-duty Los Angeles Police Department officer Fernando Arroyos during an attempted robbery. Luis Alfredo De La Rosa Rios, 29, Ernesto Cisneros, 22, and Jesse Contreras, 34, are allegedly members of the F-13 gang, according to a US Justice Department release. Rio\u2019s alleged girlfriend Haylee Marie Grisham, 18, was also charged. According to the complaint, Arroyos was house-hunting on Monday with his girlfriend when a black pickup truck drove up. Rios and Cisneros pointed guns at Arroyos and his girlfriend and removed items from both, including chains from Arroyos\u2019 neck.  There was an exchange of gunfire between Arroyos and the two suspects, after which Arroyos collapsed and the two suspects fled, the release said. Los Angeles County sheriff\u2019s deputies responded to the scene and took Arroyos to a hospital where he died.   The four defendants were in the vehicle and allegedly were at the scene of the robbery and the shooting, the complaint said. They are charged with violent crime in aid of racketeering, which carries a potential death penalty and a minimum sentence of life in federal prison without the possibility of parole.

Arroyos, 27, \u201cwas starting a very promising career,\u201d LAPD Chief Michel Moore said Tuesday. He was with the department for three years and assigned to the Wilshire Division. \u201cHe found himself, after working a series of days in patrol, to have a day off, enjoying it with his girlfriend on a hunt for a house, a place to live, a place to buy and invest in this city and the future of this region,\u201d Moore said. Arroyos is survived by his mother and stepfather. \u201cHe was the only child, he had a promising future, a bright future that was taken away, viciously, over a street robbery,\u201d the chief said.  F-13 is a \u201clarge, multi-generational street gang that previously has been the subject of federal prosecutions, including two large racketeering cases,\u201d the US Attorney\u2019s office said in a news release.

How did the crash unfold? Which systems have recovered, and which ones are still affected? We break it down. (All times Eastern Time.) Late Thursday night and early Friday, 911 centers and transportation services are disrupted Overnight on Thursday and into Friday, several states, including Alaska and Arizona, experience 911 service outages. Some hospitals also begin experiencing technology issues overnight, according to nurses on shift. Between 2 and 3 a.m., the Federal Aviation Administration announces that all Delta and American Airlines flights are grounded. Several minutes later, the FAA says flights from United and Allegiant Airlines have been grounded regardless of their destination. Spirit Airlines says its flight reservation system has also been affected by the outage. A few hours later, between 5 and 6 a.m., public transit systems in the Northeast begin announcing that they have been impacted. Washington, DC, public transportation services \u2014 including trains and buses \u2014 begin experiencing delays, according to the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority. In New York City, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, North America\u2019s largest transportation network, says customer information systems have gone temporarily offline, but train and bus services remain unaffected. At 5:30 a.m., US cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike tells customers that it was \u201caware of reports of crashes\u201d of its software on Microsoft Windows operating systems, according to a company advisory viewed by CNN.\u00a0CrowdStrike\u2019s cybersecurity software \u2014\u00a0used by numerous Fortune 500 companies \u2014\u00a0detects and blocks hacking threats. Between 6 and 7 a.m., the White House investigates and global banks report issues Between 6 and 7 a.m.: A White House National Security Council spokesperson tells CNN they are \u201caware of the incident and are looking into the issue and impacts.\u201d A White House source familiar with the matter tells CNN there are no indications at this time of malicious activity, though the administration is still investigating. Global banks start reporting some service disruptions, including Australia\u2019s Commonwealth Bank, South Africa\u2019s Capitec, and the Bank of Israel. Australian lenders ANZ and Westpac were also impacted, according to Downdetector, a website that tracks cyber outages. Downdetector has also reported issues for New Zealand\u2019s ASB Bank. Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler issues an emergency declaration in response to the outage that affected Bureau of Emergency Communication\u2019s Computer Aided Dispatch system that is used for fielding emergency calls. The bureau begins taking calls manually, according to the mayor\u2019s office. Meanwhile, United Airlines announces that it is resuming \u201csome flights.\u201d Between 8 and 9 a.m., some flights resume but airports brace for a busy day Delta Air Lines resumes some flight departures and issues travel waivers to affected customers. A spokesperson for Atlanta\u2019s Hartsfield Jackson International Airport said that systems were operational and the airport put in place additional customer service personnel to address the challenges they\u2019re facing. The spokesperson urged customers to \u201chave patience. We\u2019re trying to have grace and patience with all of the passengers. We\u2019re asking the same.\u201d Later Friday morning, Charlotte Douglas International Airport, an American Airlines hub, advises passengers to not go to the airport \u201cunless they have confirmed their flight information with the airline.\u201d Officials at Miami International Airport, another American Airlines hub, likewise warn travelers that US Customs and Border Protection operations have been affected nationwide, \u201cso international passenger arrivals are currently being processed manually at a slower pace.\u201d Between 9 a.m. and noon, federal agencies get involved and Biden is briefed A little before 9 a.m., Alaska State Troopers and Phoenix Police Department in Arizona say that service at its 911 centers are once again operational after emergency and non-emergency call centers were impacted. Portland\u2019s Computer Aided Dispatch system also comes back online at 9 a.m. \u201cAt no time was the community\u2019s ability to make 911 calls impacted,\u201d the mayor\u2019s office says in a news release. \u201cThe critical, life-saving services of public safety bureaus, including Police and Fire & Rescue, continue.\u201d The Federal Communications Commission announces it is working with federal agencies to provide assistance and determine the extent of the outage after it was made aware of \u201creports of a systems outage causing disruptions in service, including 911.\u201d President Joe Biden is briefed on the CrowdStrike outage and his team is in touch with CrowdStrike and impacted entities, says a White House official. The president\u2019s team is also engaged with agencies \u201cto get sector by sector updates throughout the day and is standing by to provide assistance as needed,\u201d according to the official. Around this time, an increasing number of federal agencies begin getting involved and reporting service disruptions. The US Department of Homeland Security says in a statement on X they are \u201cworking with CrowdStrike, Microsoft and our federal, state, local and critical infrastructure partners to fully assess and address system outages.\u201d Social Security offices close to the public, as the agency warns the public that \u201clonger wait times on our national 800 number are expected.\u201d In an internal memo viewed by CNN, the US Department of Justice says it is feeling some impact from the technology outage and, while it\u2019s working on workarounds, notes it does not have an \u201cestimated restoration time.\u201d Mail carriers UPS and FedEx tell CNN they were also impacted by the outage. UPS says its airline is operational and its drivers are on the roads, but there may be some service delays. A little after 11 a.m., CrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz says in a post on X, the firm \u201c(understands) the gravity of the situation and are deeply sorry for the inconvenience and disruption,\u201d adding that the incident was not a cyber attack, and that customers\u2019 data remains protected. \u201cThe issue has been identified and a fix has been deployed,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was an issue with a Falcon content update for Windows Hosts.\u201d Late morning through early afternoon: canceled doctors and DMV appointments The Massachusetts Department of Transportation announces that some Registry of Motor Vehicle operations are impacted. Other states also report impacts to their driving services, including Georgia, North Carolina, Texas and Tennessee. Around the same time, several of the nation\u2019s healthcare and hospital systems announce they have been impacted by the global outage, including Mass General Brigham hospital system in Massachusetts, Penn Medicine in Pennsylvania, Northwell Health in New York, and Emory Healthcare in Atlanta. While some hospitals report delays in services, others cancel some non-urgent surgeries and medical office visits. Several cancer centers, including Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston and New York\u2019s Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center say they have paused certain procedures and scheduled appointments. In British Columbia, the Provincial Health Services Authority (PHSA) announces its health system has been impacted, and is working on implementing contingency plans in order to ensure care for patients. Late afternoon sees more medical disruptions Around 4 p.m., New York Blood Center, a supplier of blood to approximately 200 hospitals in the Northeast United States, says it has put in place an emergency driving operation to distribute blood. \u201cThe test tubes are not making it onto planes from yesterday and today, requiring for us to drive them,\u201d New York Blood Center\u2019s senior vice president Andrea Cefarelli told CNN in a phone call. \u201cThere is going to be a 12-24 hour delay in getting the test results.\u201d Blood Centers of America, which rely on shipping companies like FedEx, says it is experiencing delays in reporting test results.\u00a0Executive Vice President Jenny Ficenec says blood usage may be down due to hospitals canceling elective surgeries, so the delay should not cause any shortages unless the problem persists. Blood\u00a0Assurance, which provides blood to hospitals in a number of Southeast states, including Tennessee, Georgia, North Carolina and Virginia, says its planned shipment of at least 20\u00a0platelets has been postponed due to flight delays and cancellations caused by the outage. \u201cWe are asking community members to help through donation,\u201d\u00a0Blood\u00a0Assurance says in an email to CNN. \u201cWe have a fantastic community of donors that always shows up when we need them.\u201d Meanwhile, CrowdStrike CEO Kurtz takes to social media again and promises customers \u201cfull transparency\u201d on how the global IT outage involving the company\u2019s software occurred. CrowdStrike would take steps \u201cto prevent anything like this from happening again,\u201d according to a statement on the company\u2019s website. Saturday morning: massive flight delays In a statement Saturday morning, Microsoft estimates the outage affected 8.5 million Windows devices. That\u2019s less 1% of all Windows machines, according to Microsoft, but the company adds that \u201cthe broad economic and societal impacts reflect the use of CrowdStrike by enterprises that run many critical services.\u201d Various sectors are still feeling the aftershocks of the outage. Although airlines have largely resumed services, many tell customers that they expect disruptions in schedules to continue. As of noon on Saturday, at least 3,375 flights across the United States have been delayed and more than 1,200 canceled, according to data from flight tracker FlightAware. Atlanta\u2019s Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport, the nation\u2019s busiest airport, remains the most affected. Delta Air Lines has canceled more than 500 flights, while United Airlines has canceled almost 300, according to FlightAware.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/20/tech/timeline-crowdstrike-system-outage/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/21/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_07_18_us_dog-days-of-summer-explained-cec", "text": "Bad news, heat haters: The dog days of summer are not, as Florence Welch once sang, over or done. The dog days of summer, the period during which the star Sirius rises alongside the sun,\u00a0run from July 3 to August 11. Ancient people believed that Sirius influenced the weather, among other phenomena, that caused particularly excruciating heat and even drove people and dogs to madness. True, it is especially hot in the summer, but that\u2019s not Sirius\u2019 fault, William Cumiford, associate professor at Chapman University and ancient history scholar. Nor is it the fault of a star that heat can make humans and canines alike volatile. But Sirius, known as the \u201cdog star\u201d to the ancient Greeks, did inspire the saying we still use today. Here\u2019s how the \u201cdog days of summer\u201d went from a feared period in ancient Greece and Rome to an innocent phrase immortalized in film and song. \u2018Dog days\u2019 started with a star It all starts with Sirius, the brightest star in the night sky and the part of the Canis Major that makes up the \u201csnout\u201d of the dog-shaped constellation. And adorably, Sirius seemed to be tailing a certain man-shaped set of stars. \u201cIt seems that the star appeared to form a celestial canine apparition \u2018following\u2019 the constellation of Orion,\u201d Cumiford said. But with astronomy in its infancy and other fields of science still unexplored, people of ancient civilizations \u201clooked to the heavens\u201d to explain the seemingly inexplicable phenomena in their lives, from illness to extreme weather and other disasters, Cumiford said. Enter Sirius. Ancient Egyptians believed that the star co-rising with the sun was related to annual Nile River flooding, Cumiford said. (The river floods annually because of heavy summer rainfall, not because Sirius and the sun cause it.) But Sirius \u2014\u00a0or Sothis, to the Egyptians \u2014\u00a0wasn\u2019t viewed as a destructive force in ancient Egypt, per the Old Farmer\u2019s Almanac. The annual flooding brought silt and fertile soil to parts of the desert, an essential and life-sustaining tradition the Egyptians counted on every year. The Greeks, meanwhile, who named Sirius, believed that Sirius and the sun shining brightly together contributed to the extreme heat of the late summer, said Cumiford. This belief made its way into one of the great Greek epic poems \u2014 Homer\u2019s \u201cIliad,\u201d which compares Achilles, the great Greek warrior of myth, and his shield to \u201cthe star they call Orion\u2019s dog \u2014 brightest of all but a fatal sign emblazoned on the heavens, it brings such killing fever down on wretched men.\u201d The Romans, too, believed in the dangerous power of \u201cthe dog star.\u201d In Virgil\u2019s \u201cAeneid,\u201d he writes, in one translation, of \u201cfiery Sirius, bringer of drought and plague to frail mortals\u201d and the way it \u201crises and saddens the sky with sinister light.\u201d Greeks and Romans also believed that Sirius influenced other weather events, including droughts and thunderstorms, along with poor health, bad luck \u2014\u00a0and dogs gone mad. The dog star and its seemingly destructive powers begat the phrase \u201cdog days of summer.\u201d In extreme heat, dogs and humans alike suffer \u2014\u00a0they\u2019re tired, overheated and in need of cool relief that may not come for months. And among humans, heat really can drive us mad: Research shows that higher temperatures are associated with anger, aggression and even acts of violence. And if we\u2019re suffering in the heat, think of how dogs feel under all that fur. But Sirius and the sun have little to do with each other or with us. Though it\u2019s the brightest star in the night sky, Sirius has no effect on Earth\u2019s weather or climate, Cumiford said. \u2018Dog days\u2019 in pop culture The phrase \u201cdog days\u201d lived on long after the fall of the Roman Empire \u2014\u00a0and after we came to understand that Sirius does not cause madness in people or dogs. And the way we\u2019ve come to understand it has changed, too: Now, it\u2019s used more generally to refer to the unbearably hot, humid, overall unpleasant days of summer. Charles Dickens used it, though, to express just how chilly and cruel his protagonist Ebenezer Scrooge could be to his underlings in \u201cA Christmas Carol\u201d: \u201cHe carried his own low temperatures always about with him; He iced his office in the dog-days, and didn\u2019t thaw it one degree at Christmas.\u201d \u201cDog Day Afternoon,\u201d the classic 1975 crime drama starring Al Pacino, takes place on an excruciatingly hot day in late August (although it\u2019s set on August 22, 11 days after the \u201cdog days of summer\u201d are thought to end), Cumiford noted. Sometimes \u201cdog days\u201d isn\u2019t used to refer to the extreme heat of summer but any difficult period of despair. Florence and the Machine\u2019s breakout single \u201cDog Days Are Over\u201d is a celebration of coming out on the other side of a slump, reaccepting happiness after an emotional drought. We\u2019re around halfway through the dog days of summer if we\u2019re going by the Old Farmer\u2019s Almanac\u2019s end date of August 11. But the heat persists all summer long \u2014\u00a0and it\u2019s just hot enough these days to make you feel like you\u2019re going a bit mad.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/18/us/dog-days-of-summer-explained-cec/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/21/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_07_20_politics_bill-hillary-clinton-donors-biden", "text": "Former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton have been privately encouraging donors in recent weeks to continue financially supporting President Joe Biden\u2019s campaign, according to two sources familiar, in the aftermath of Biden\u2019s disastrous debate performance that has sent the Democratic Party spiraling into chaos. One of the sources said the Clintons are choosing to be \u201cdeferential to Biden\u2019s decision.\u201d However, the second source, who is familiar with the Clintons\u2019 thinking and has spoken with the couple in recent days, insisted that it is more accurate to say they are \u201cdeferential to the process.\u201d According to this source, the Clintons have made clear in private conversations recently that it doesn\u2019t matter what anybody says or thinks \u2014 unless Biden decides he will drop out of the 2024 race or the delegates vote for somebody else, he is the party\u2019s presumptive nominee. This source declined to comment on whether the Clintons have expressed a personal view on whether they believe Biden should continue seeking a second term. Since the CNN debate on June 27,\u00a0big-dollar donors have held back from writing checks amid growing concerns about Biden\u2019s candidacy, raising serious concerns about how long the campaign can continue operating in full force if circumstances don\u2019t change. \u201cI don\u2019t know how you campaign with a broadening electoral map without money. I don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing. I don\u2019t know,\u201d one major Democratic donor told CNN on Friday. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen this strategy where you think you can win without money.\u201d This donor mused that perhaps the campaign can get away with digging in for a few more weeks under the current circumstances, but that anything longer would become extraordinarily difficult. They also noted that the emails from the campaign for events and fundraisers have significantly slowed in recent weeks: \u201cThey seem far and few between,\u201d they said. Still, the Biden campaign has boasted record-breaking grassroots fundraising. On Friday,\u00a0Vice President Kamala\u00a0Harris joined a call with\u00a0donors\u00a0amid ongoing party panic. The vice president was asked to do the call by the West Wing, according to campaign officials.\u00a0Harris\u2019\u00a0aides have repeatedly stressed that there\u2019s no daylight between the vice president and the president, and she maintained her defense of Biden on Friday. Harris attended a fundraiser in Massachusetts on Saturday. The Biden campaign also previewed upcoming fundraisers in Chicago, as well as in Northern and Southern California in the upcoming days and weeks to rake in more cash.\u00a0\u201cHe will be doing big fundraisers and focusing on continuing to bolster grassroots fundraising,\u201d Biden campaign spokesperson Kevin Munoz said on MSNBC on Saturday.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/20/politics/bill-hillary-clinton-donors-biden/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/21/2024", "section": "us"}}

The pilot, who was the only person on board, was conducting parachute operations prior to the crash, Tammy L. Jones, a spokesperson for the FAA, told CNN Saturday. It is unclear how many divers were on board before the crash, Niagara County Sheriff Michael Filicetti said at a news conference Saturday. A brush fire also reportedly began around the crash site, according to the release. The initial responding crew had to put out \u201ca significant fire at that point,\u201d Filicetti said.

{"id": "2024_07_16_us_police-fatally-shoot-man-near-republican-national-convention", "text": "Ohio police officers who were in Milwaukee to help with security at the Republican National Convention shot and killed a 43-year-old man Tuesday who local authorities said had knives in both hands and was trying to attack another man. The officers from Columbus, Ohio, saw a man with two knives involved in an altercation with an unarmed man and went to intervene, Milwaukee Police Chief Jeffrey Norman said at a news conference. The suspect refused commands to drop the knives and charged the other man, and five officers opened fire, killing the assailant, according to the chief. \u201cSomeone\u2019s life was in danger,\u201d Norman said at the news conference. \u201cThese officers, who are not from this area, took (it) upon themselves to act to save someone\u2019s life today.\u201d Two knives were recovered at the scene, Norman said. Authorities believe the initial altercation was not related to the convention. The shooting came a day after the start of the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee and just days after former President Donald Trump was injured in an attempted assassination. Law enforcement officials have set up extensive security measures around the convention at the Fiserv Forum. The shooting happened on the convention\u2019s outer security perimeter, within the zone where their officers were assigned, Columbus Division of Police Chief Elaine Bryant said in a statement. The chief released video from the body-worn camera of one officer involved in the shooting. The 31-second video, which begins partially blurred, starts with the officers engaged in a briefing before turning their attention to an altercation involving two men nearby. \u201cHe\u2019s got a knife. Yes he does,\u201d one officer says in the video. They immediately draw their weapons and run toward the altercation, yelling at the armed man, \u201cDrop the knife!\u201d the video shows. As the officers come near, one man holding something in each hand appears to move toward the other man, the video shows. The officers then shoot at the moving man, and he falls to the ground, the video shows. Man identified as Samuel Sharpe Jr. Samuel Sharpe Jr., 43,\u00a0is the man fatally shot by police on Tuesday, his sister Angelique Sharpe told CNN. She said her brother lived in a tent across the street from where the shooting happened. Although she\u2019s not sure what led to Tuesday\u2019s altercation, she said on Saturday and Tuesday her brother had told his family that\u00a0some other men had been threatening to kill him and his dog. \u201cI saw the bodycam\u00a0video. If they were concerned about him having a knife, then tase the guy and take away the knife and figure out what\u2019s happening,\u201d Angelique Sharpe said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re in a physical altercation and you\u2019re fighting for your life, you\u2019re in that moment. They didn\u2019t even give my brother time to react to their commands.\u201d Sharpe\u2019s sister, who lives in Milwaukee and is a small business owner, told CNN her brother was a devout Bible reader who\u00a0lived with his mother until January, when he moved out with his dog to live among\u00a0unhoused people and spread his faith. \u201cHe wanted to move down there to read the Bible and share with them that God hasn\u2019t forgotten about them, and he wanted to let them know that even though society has forgotten about them, God hasn\u2019t forgotten about them,\u201d she told CNN. \u201cHe was a really loving and compassionate person. When he would get money, he would give it away to other people. He was a chill guy who loved God.\u201d Sharpe is survived by his mother and sister. Mayor and activists react to police shooting Milwaukee Mayor Cavalier Johnson said the shooting was a tragedy that appears to be justified. \u201cAny officer in that same situation where they witness somebody who\u2019s going to cause death or serious bodily harm to somebody with a gun or, in this case, with a knife \u2013 not just one knife, but two knives \u2013 would have taken the exact same action to preserve life,\u201d Johnson told CNN\u2019s Ryan Young. The force from Columbus is in Milwaukee to assist with security for the Republican National Convention, but Johnson said the incident had no connection to the convention. Johnson, a Democrat who has endorsed President Joe Biden for the upcoming election, said Trump called him Tuesday to express appreciation for the city\u2019s public safety efforts hosting the convention. Last year, the US Department of Justice released recommendations for reform of the Columbus Division of Police following a nearly two-year review of its policies. The division requested the review after facing multiple controversies, including criticism over its management of racial justice protests in 2020 and deadly police shootings, including those of\u00a0Andre Hill\u00a0and\u00a0Ma\u2019Khia Bryant. The recommendations were aimed at strengthening the police department\u2019s relationship with the community and included longer training periods for officers and technology improvements. The fatal shooting sparked anger and criticism by local activists. At an evening news conference held by people calling for police accountability, activist Alan Chavoya said, \u201cWe\u2019re not even two days into this RNC and we have a casualty. How is that possible? And guess what, as always, no answers from the MPD. No transparency, no accountability.\u201d \u201cWe want answers, we want to know why was there an out-of-state police officer in this area in the first place,\u201d Pastor Radontae Ashford of the Infinite Church said at the news conference. \u201cThere\u2019s only two reasons \u2026 that any of us that even live in Milwaukee would even be in this area, either for something helpful or something harmful.\u201d In a statement, the American Civil Liberties Union of Wisconsin called for a \u201cfull and transparent\u201d investigation into what led up to the shooting. \u201cMore than 4,000 additional law enforcement officials are in Milwaukee for the RNC, and we\u2019ve long feared how this heavy police presence could increase the risk of deadly police encounters, especially by out-of-state officers who don\u2019t know and aren\u2019t accountable to our community,\u201d the statement from Executive Director Melinda Brennan read. \u201cWe offer our condolences to the friends and family of the person killed.\u201d CNN\u2019s Andy Rose and Eric Levenson contributed to this story.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/16/us/police-fatally-shoot-man-near-republican-national-convention/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/21/2024", "section": "us"}}

Billhimer\u00a0said in a news release. A criminal complaint notes the child was left unattended in the\u00a0parked\u00a0vehicle, which was not running, for\u00a0more than four hours. Officers arrived to find\u00a0Hatzolah Medical Services\u00a0personnel\u00a0attempting to save the child, but she died at the scene, prosecutors said. Excessive heat warnings were in place Monday for portions of New Jersey and Philadelphia, with temperatures reaching over 100 degrees\u00a0in some areas. The investigation determined the child died due to being left unattended in the car, the prosecutor said\u00a0in the release. The child\u2019s father, Avraham\u00a0Chaitovsky, 28, was charged with endangering the welfare of a child,\u00a0according to the\u00a0release. Chaitovsky\u00a0was taken into custody, said the prosecutor. He has since been released,\u00a0Ocean County Jail\u00a0records show.\u00a0It\u2019s unclear whether\u00a0he\u00a0has retained an attorney. In another incident, a 2-year-old girl in Arizona died after being left in a vehicle in her family\u2019s driveway for about three hours, according to the Marana Police Department. The girl\u2019s father,\u00a037-year-old\u00a0Christopher Scholtes,\u00a0told officers he\u00a0arrived home on July 9 and left his daughter sleeping in her car seat inside the vehicle, which\u00a0he said\u00a0was running with the AC on, according to a news release from police. Scholtes\u00a0\u201ctold detectives he did not want to wake his daughter\u00a0up,\u201d the release said. When her mother arrived home, the girl was found in the car \u2013 which was no longer running \u2013 and\u00a0the\u00a0air conditioning\u00a0was off. The mother performed CPR until first responders arrived. The child was taken to Banner University Medical Center, where she was pronounced dead, police said. Detectives used surveillance video from neighbors to determine the girl was left in the vehicle for about three hours, police said. The area was under an excessive heat warning from the National Weather Service in Tucson\u00a0at the time. And in Nebraska, a 5-year-old boy died on July 10 after being\u00a0found unresponsive inside a vehicle, according to the Omaha Police Department. The boy was left unattended inside the vehicle for\u00a0\u201can extended period of time,\u201d\u00a0police said\u00a0in a news release. His foster mother, 40-year-old Juanita Pinon,\u00a0has been charged with child abuse by neglect, resulting in death, and booked into Douglas County Corrections\u00a0with bond set at $2 million, according to\u00a0county court records. CNN has reached out to an attorney for Pinon for comment. Heat safety warning Children left unattended in cars are at risk for heat stroke and possibly death \u2013 and it\u2019s not enough to just crack a window,\u00a0the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says. \u201cTemperatures inside the car can rise almost 20 degrees Fahrenheit within the first 10 minutes, even with a window cracked open\u201d\u00a0and even when it feels cool outside,\u00a0the agency warns. About 1,220 people in the United States are killed by extreme heat every year, according to the CDC. On\u00a0average,\u00a037 children under the age of 15 die each year from heatstroke after being left in a vehicle, according to the\u00a0National Safety Council. With summer off to a scorching start, health officials are reminding people to take extra care in preventing heat-related illnesses. That includes never leaving a child, disabled person\u00a0or pet unattended in a\u00a0car, watching for signs of heat stroke and drinking plenty of water.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/17/us/hot-car-deaths-charges/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/21/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_07_20_economy_china-economy-employment-blue-collar-work-intl-hnk", "text": "Leon Li used to play a discreet but indispensable part at one of China\u2019s biggest tech giants. As an administrative officer, she worked around the clock to schedule meetings, prepare documents and provide her bosses with whatever support they needed. But in February, she quit the company, forgoing a stable career and comfortable salary forsomething a little less stressful \u2014 cleaning homes. \u201cEvery morning when the alarm rang, all I could see was my dull future,\u201d she told CNN, reflecting on her office job. Li, 27, is part of a growing base of Chinese workers swapping high-pressure office jobs\u00a0for flexible blue-collar work. Many of them used to work for some of the biggest companies in the country. But these firms are slowly losing their appeal as China\u2019s economy faces headwinds\u00a0including a property crisis, declining foreign investment and slumping consumption. China\u2019s economy\u00a0grew 4.7% year-on-year in the second quarter of 2024, missing economists\u2019 expectations and marking the weakest growth since the first quarter of last year, according to the\u00a0latest data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) released on Monday. Gruelingly long hours and shrinking resources have prompted employees like Li to\u00a0rethink whether it\u2019s worth trading their time and health for higher pay. \u201cI like cleaning up. As living standards improve (across the country), the demand forhousekeeping services is also surging with an ever-expanding market,\u201d she said. But more importantly, she feels happier. \u201cThe change it brings is that my head no longer feels\u00a0dizzy. I feel less mental pressure. And I am full of energy every day,\u201d she said. Workers reject \u2019996\u2019 culture Li is not the only white-collar worker who has found a better work-life balance by trading\u00a0an office job for manual labor. Alice Wang, 30, who is using an alias for privacy reasons, used to work for one of China\u2019s\u00a0leading live-streaming e-commerce platforms, earning 700,000 yuan ($96,310) per year. But she resigned in April, moving from Hangzhou, a picturesque tech hub, to the\u00a0more laidback city of Chengdu, where rent is cheaper, to take up pet grooming. China\u2019s notorious \u201c996\u201d work culture \u2013 the practice of working from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. six days a\u00a0week that is common among the country\u2019s tech companies, startups and other private businesses \u2013 has been a push factor for many employees who call it quits. Wang recalled feeling physically frail and \u201cvery lifeless and stagnant\u201d at her old job,\u00a0when she used to dedicate most of her time to work. But she feels different now. \u201cThe feeling of growth is relatively good,\u201d she said, adding that\u00a0she\u2019s undertaking grooming training and has ambitions to one day open her own store. \u201cThat\u2019s the longer-term plan,\u201d she said. The trend to move from professional to manual jobs comes amid surging demand for blue-collar workers, according to Chinese recruitment platform Zhaopin. In its latest survey released in June, the platform found that demand for blue-collarjobs \u2013 such as food delivery workers, truck drivers, waiters and technicians \u2013 had surged 3.8 times in the first quarter of the year compared to the same period in 2019. Demand for delivery workers grew the fastest, by 800%, after three years of Covid-related lockdowns\u00a0that gave rise to a takeout food culture. And blue-collar workers\u2019 pay has also gone up, attracting more people to jobs they might have previously avoided. The explosion of online shopping has seen the average monthly salary for a delivery worker\u00a0surge 45.3% since 2019, from 5,581 yuan ($768) to 8,109 yuan ($1,116), according to the survey. For some college graduates though, taking a manual job was not their first choice. As the economy slows, positions for fresh grads have become harder to come by in an increasingly\u00a0competitive corporate job market. The survey also found the number of people under the age of 25 who applied for blue-collar\u00a0jobs in the first quarter of this year surged 165% compared with the same period in 2019. China\u2019s unemployment rate for 16-to-24-year-olds reached a staggering 21.3% in June 2023,\u00a0according to the NBS, which subsequently suspended the release of the figure for months while it adjusted its methodology. The authorities brought back the data in January this year \u2013 excluding from the figure some\u00a062 million students, whose main task, they said, should be to study rather than look for\u00a0jobs. In recent months, the jobless rate for prospective workers aged 16 to 24 years old has hovered\u00a0between 14.2% and 15.3%, according to the NBS. Economists Larry Hu and Zhang Yuxiao, from Macquarie, wrote in a research report last year that\u00a0China\u2019s services sector, private companies and small and medium-sized enterprises used to be\u00a0the major sources of employment for young workers. However, they have been hit hard by\u00a0sluggish consumer demand. David Goodman, director of the University of Sydney\u2019s China Studies Centre, said there hadbeen a mismatch between the kind of graduates that universities churn out and what\u00a0the market really needs. He said China\u2019s economy was shifting towards advanced technology, green tech and service industries, while university education still largely focuses on manufacturing and public service, areas that are outdated or saturated. \u201c(There is) a key problem if the higher education system has not adjusted itself or beenadjusted to meet rapid changes in the structure of the economy,\u201d he explained. Pressure of another kind But some wonder if blue-collar work is truly the stress-free refuge people like Li and Wang\u00a0imagine it to be. A recent video circulated widely on Chinese social media demonstrated how things could go\u00a0wrong. The clip showed a barista in Shanghai losing his temper over a customer who\u00a0threatened to make a complaint against him. In a fit of rage, he threw coffee powder at her, instantly becoming the center of a cafe drama\u00a0that sparked an online debate about the challenges workers in the service industry face. Complaints or bad online reviews can prove disastrous for shops and restaurants in China, as\u00a0many consumers religiously follow recommendations on popular social media platforms such\u00a0as Xiaohongshu and Douyin, China\u2019s version of TikTok. The threat of a bad review puts pressure on low-paid workers to avoid doinganything that may draw negative attention to the company. Some internet users denounced the barista\u2019s poor manner. But many more sympathized with\u00a0him. \u201cThe pay is low to begin with, let alone having to face complaint. May as well just quit (when\u00a0you are) squeezed both by the company and customers,\u201d one online commenter wrote. But for Li, who works just six hours a day cleaning houses on a freelance basis, her\u00a0experience has been positive. She enjoys bonding with her clients and says each cleaning session makes her feel like more\u00a0than just a business transaction. \u201cCustomers will carefully pour water for us to drink. When it is time to eat, they will order\u00a0takeout for us, bring us food, and constantly remind us to drink water and rest,\u201d she said. So far, she said she has no regrets about quitting her office job. \u201cAfter a tiring day, I can go home and eat and do what I like without any extra mental\u00a0pressure,\u201d she said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/20/economy/china-economy-employment-blue-collar-work-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/21/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_07_18_us_keith-gavin-alabama-execution", "text": "Atmore, Alabama (AP) \u2014 A man convicted of fatally shooting a delivery driver during a robbery attempt in 1998 was executed Thursday evening in Alabama. Keith Edmund Gavin was pronounced dead at 6:32 p.m. CDT following a chemical injection at the William C. Holman Correctional Facility in southwest Alabama, authorities said. The 64-year-old inmate was convicted of capital murder in the shooting death of William Clayton Jr. in Cherokee County. Handling his own appeals, Gavin filed a handwritten request Wednesday with the US Supreme Court seeking a stay of execution. But the nation\u2019s high court rejected his request without comment less than an hour before the scheduled 6 p.m. CDT start of the procedure. The state attorney\u2019s general office had responded that the inmate\u2019s arguments that a circuit court had wrongly rejected an earlier appeal were without merit. Clayton, a courier service driver, had driven to an ATM in downtown Centre on the evening of March 6, 1998. He had just finished work and was getting money to take his wife to dinner, according to a court summary of trial testimony. Prosecutors said Gavin shot Clayton during the attempted robbery, pushed him into the passenger seat of the van he was driving and drove off in the vehicle. A law enforcement officer testified that he began pursuing the van and the driver \u2014 a man he later identified as Gavin \u2014 shot at him before running away into the woods. Clayton, 68, was retired from a job at a railroad company and was a Korean War veteran, according to a 1998 obituary published by The Birmingham News. At the time of the killing, Gavin was on parole in Illinois after serving 17 years of a 34-year sentence for murder, according to court records. \u201cThere is no doubt about Gavin\u2019s guilt or the seriousness of his crime,\u201d the Alabama attorney general\u2019s office had written in requesting an execution date for Gavin. Alabama last week agreed in Gavin\u2019s case to forgo a post-execution autopsy, which is typically performed on executed inmates in the state. Gavin, who was Muslim, said the procedure would\u00a0violate his religious beliefs.\u00a0Gavin had filed a lawsuit seeking to stop plans for an autopsy, and the state settled the complaint. A jury convicted Gavin of capital murder and voted 10-2 to recommend a death sentence, which a judge imposed. Most states now require a jury to be in unanimous agreement to impose a death sentence. A federal judge in 2020 ruled that Gavin had ineffective counsel at his sentencing hearing because his original lawyers failed to present more mitigating evidence of Gavin\u2019s violent and abusive childhood. Gavin grew up in a \u201cgang-infested housing project in Chicago, living in overcrowded houses that were in poor condition, where he was surrounded by drug activity, crime, violence, and riots,\u201d US District Judge Karon O. Bowdre wrote. A federal appeals court overturned the decision which allowed the death sentence to stand. Death penalty opponents had delivered a petition Wednesday to Gov. Kay Ivey appealing to her to grant clemency to Gavin. They argued that there were questions about the fairness of Gavin\u2019s trial and said Alabama was going against the \u201cdownward trend of executions\u201d in most states. It was the 10th execution in the US so far this year and the third in Alabama, according to the Death Penalty Information Center. Texas, Georgia, Oklahoma and Missouri also have conducted executions this year. The Washington, DC-based nonprofit takes no position on capital punishment but has criticized the way states carry out executions. The Supreme Court on Tuesday blocked the state of Texas from\u00a0executing\u00a0an inmate 20 minutes before he was scheduled to receive a lethal injection.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/18/us/keith-gavin-alabama-execution/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/21/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_07_18_us_illinois-deputy-charged-911-caller-killed", "text": "An Illinois woman was fatally shot\u00a0inside her home\u00a0this month by a sheriff\u2019s deputy who responded to\u00a0her\u00a0911 call, and the deputy is now charged with murder in the case, a prosecutor said this week. Sonya Massey, 36, called 911 on July 6 because she thought an intruder was in her home in the Springfield area, according to the law office of Ben Crump, the civil rights attorney representing her family. Sangamon County sheriff\u2019s Deputy Sean Grayson and another deputy responded to the call around 12:50 a.m., authorities said. Eventually, as the deputies were in Massey\u2019s home to gather information and make sure the residence was safe, a dispute arose over a pot of hot water, and Grayson drew his gun and eventually fired three times toward her, striking her once in the face, according to a court document filed Thursday by Sangamon County prosecutors. During the dispute before the shooting, Massey at one point apologized with her hands up, and Grayson at another point also yelled at her to put the pot down, prosecutors said in the document. The sheriff\u2019s office said the deputies, who were not injured, reported the shooting around 1:20 a.m. Crump\u2019s office has said Massey was unarmed. An Illinois State Police investigation of the case did \u201cnot support a finding that \u2026 Grayson was justified in his use of deadly force,\u201d the state\u2019s attorney for the county, John Milhiser, said in a Wednesday news release. A Sangamon County grand jury on Wednesday indicted Grayson on three counts of first-degree murder and a count each of aggravated battery with a firearm and official misconduct, Milhiser said. At his arraignment Thursday, Grayson entered a not guilty plea and was denied pretrial release, according to court records. A pretrial hearing is scheduled for August 26. CNN reached out Saturday to Grayson\u2019s attorney, who declined to comment. The sheriff\u2019s department has fired Grayson, the office\u00a0said\u00a0Wednesday. Crump said in a release last week that it was \u201cextremely hard to imagine how a woman who calls police out of fear of an intruder ends up shot \u2026 by the police in her own home.\u201d On Wednesday, Crump said the charges marked \u201can important milestone in the pursuit of justice for Sonya Massey\u2019s family.\u201d \u201cThis news is a step toward justice for Sonya\u2019s loved ones, especially her children, who have endured unimaginable pain and suffering since they were notified of this tragedy. We remain committed to uncovering the truth of what happened and identifying the failures that allowed this tragic death to occur,\u201d Crump said in a Wednesday release. Massey\u2019s funeral will be held Friday morning, according to Crump\u2019s office. How the shooting unfolded, according to prosecutors Massey called 911 to report a possible \u201cprowler,\u201d according to the document that prosecutors filed in a court in Springfield on Thursday. When the two responding deputies encountered Massey, she \u201cappeared to be calm, perhaps unwell, not aggressive,\u201d the court document said. After entering Massey\u2019s home, Grayson \u201cnoticed a pot on the stove,\u00a0and approved of Massey removing the pot to prevent any accidental fires.\u201d The pot \u201capparently contained heated water,\u201d the court document says. What happened next is unclear. Massey set the pot down on a counter in the kitchen, according to the document. Grayson, who was in the living room, then\u00a0\u201cdrew his 9mm firearm and threatened to shoot Ms. Massey in the face,\u201d\u00a0according to the document. \u201cSeeing the drawn weapon, Ms. Massey put her hands in the air and stated, \u2018I\u2019m sorry,\u2019 while ducking for cover behind the counter that separated her and the defendant,\u201d the document says. \u201cWith his firearm still drawn, Grayson went closer to Massey and aggressively yelled at her to put the pot down.\u201d Then, Grayson shot Massey in the face, according to the court document. It wasn\u2019t until after Grayson fatally shot Massey that he activated his body camera, the document says. The other deputy, who was checking the house while the dispute over the pot happened, had activated his body camera when he first arrived on scene, according to the court document. Grayson instructed the other deputy not to retrieve a medical kit \u201cbecause of the severity of the injury,\u201d according to the court document. The other deputy still rendered aid and stayed with Massey until medics arrived. Grayson \u201cat no time attempted to render aid,\u201d the document said. Massey was taken to a hospital, where she was pronounced dead, the sheriff\u2019s department has said. The court document does not explain how prosecutors got details of the incident, but it asks the court to refer to the deputies\u2019 body camera recordings, which prosecutors submitted as an exhibit. The document also does not explain where the other deputy was within the house when the dispute and the shooting happened. Body camera footage to be publicly released next week Massey\u2019s family saw body camera footage of the incident during a meeting with prosecutors and state police on Wednesday, Milhiser said that day. After consulting with the family, officials decided the footage will be released publicly on Monday afternoon, the prosecutor said. Nothing has been redacted \u201cexcept for the blurring of certain images\u201d out of respect, Milhiser said. Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker expressed gratitude Wednesday to prosecutors for bringing the \u201cappropriate charges\u201d in this case. \u201cSonya Massey was concerned for her safety and called law enforcement to her home for protection. Like all Illinoisans, she deserved that protection. Instead, innocent and unarmed, she was gunned down by an officer of the law,\u201d Pritzker said Wednesday in a news release. \u201cMy heart breaks for Sonya\u2019s children, for her family and friends and for all who knew and loved her, and I am enraged that another innocent Black woman had her life taken from her at the hands of a police officer,\u201d the governor said. The sheriff\u2019s office said Wednesday that Grayson\u2019s actions \u201cdo not reflect the values and training of the Sangamon County Sheriff\u2019s Office or law enforcement as a whole,\u201d and that it was \u201cclear that the deputy did not act as trained or in accordance with our standards.\u201d \u201cGood law enforcement officers stand with our community in condemning actions that undermine the trust and safety we strive to uphold. In times like these, it is crucial for leadership across all sides and spectrums to come together to heal our community,\u201d the office said in an online post.

{"id": "2024_07_19_tech_tech-outage-crowdstrike-software", "text": "When computers and tech systems around the world went down Friday, snarling airports, closing Social Security offices and limiting jail operations, many people had one question: How on earth could this happen in 2024? A software update from a single cybersecurity company, US-based CrowdStrike, was the root cause of the chaos, underlining the fragility of the global economy and its dependence on computer systems to which relatively few people give a passing thought. \u201c[M]ost people believe that when the end of the world comes, it will be AI taking over some kind of nuclear power plant and shutting down electricity,\u201d Costin Raiu, a longtime cybersecurity researcher, quipped to CNN. \u201cWhile in reality, it\u2019s more likely to be some kind of a little bit of code in a botched update, causing a cascade reaction in interdependent cloud systems.\u201d Software updates are a critical function in society to keep computers protected from hackers. But the update process itself is crucial to get right and to safeguard from tampering. An inherent \u2014 and some say misplaced \u2014 trust in that process was punctured on Friday. CrowdStrike is everywhere Numerous Fortune 500 companies use CrowdStrike\u2019s cybersecurity software to detect and block hacking threats. Computers running Microsoft Windows \u2014\u00a0one of the most popular software programs in the world \u2014 crashed because of the faulty way a code update issued by CrowdStrike is interacting with Windows. CrowdStrike, a multibillion-dollar firm, has expanded its footprint around the world in its more than decade of doing business. Many more businesses and governments are now protected from cyberthreats because of this, but the dominance of a handful of firms in the anti-virus and threat-detection marketplace creates its own risks, according to experts. \u201cWe trust cybersecurity providers widely but without diversity; we\u2019ve created fragility in our technology ecosystem,\u201d Munish Walther-Puri, the former director of cyber risk for the city of New York, told CNN. \u201c\u2018Winning\u2019 in the marketplace can aggregate risk, and then we all \u2014\u00a0consumers and companies alike \u2014 bear the costs,\u201d Walther-Puri said. CNN has requested comment from CrowdStrike. How to prevent this from happening again The wide swathe of critical infrastructure providers affected by the outage is also likely to raise fresh questions among US officials and corporate executives about whether new policy tools are needed to avoid catastrophe in the future. Anne Neuberger, a senior White House tech and cybersecurity official, spoke of the \u201crisks of consolidation\u201d in the tech supply chain when asked about the IT outage on Friday. \u201cWe need to really think about our digital resilience not just in the systems we run but in the globally connected security systems, the risks of consolidation, how we deal with that consolidation and how we ensure that if an incident does occur it can be contained and we can recover quickly,\u201d Neuberger said at the Aspen Security Forum in response to a question about the IT outage. The chaotic scenario that played out Friday did not involve a malicious actor, but government officials around the world will likely be gaming out what might have been. The infamous hack of the US government using SolarWinds software in 2020, which US officials blamed on Russia, came through a tampered software update. That hack was not nearly as disruptive but another alleged Russian hack in 2017 caused billions of dollars in damage to the global economy because malicious code spread like wildfire. The CrowdStrike episode \u201cdemonstrates the serious damage that could be inflicted by a malicious adversary if they were so minded,\u201d Tobias Feakin, a former ambassador for cybersecurity and critical technology in the Australian foreign ministry, told CNN.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/19/tech/tech-outage-crowdstrike-software/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/21/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_07_20_politics_harris-fundraiser-biden-buttigieg", "text": "Defending Joe Biden and ripping into Donald Trump, Kamala Harris got one of her most roaring responses in years as she spoke at a fundraiser\u00a0Saturday afternoon\u00a0in Provincetown, Massachusetts. The vice president didn\u2019t directly address the turmoil facing her running mate \u2014 whom she referred to at points as \u201cour president\u201d and \u201cone of the most consequential presidents in American history\u201d \u2014 but she did speak to the anxiety pulsing through the white tent in the shadow of the Pilgrim Monument by repeating, \u201cWe are going to win this election,\u201d and asking the crowd to tell that to their friends. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be easy. But we are a group of people who understand anything worthwhile takes a lot of hard work,\u201d Harris said. \u201cIt takes grit. It takes believing in something and then going forward.\u201d The event was scheduled weeks ago, in very different political circumstances. By the time she took the stage, Harris was greeted with the excitement of many in the crowd who clearly believed they might be looking at a replacement nominee and, soon, potential next president. A $1 million fundraising goal for the afternoon was more than doubled; a large oil portrait of Harris\u2019 face was positioned on an easel; toward the back; and a woman shouting out, \u201cGo get \u2018em, Kamala!\u201d was greeted with a huge cheer and applause. Harris \u2014 who stood in front of a giant sign declaring the location to be \u201cVPTOWN,\u201d a riff on the town\u2019s \u201cPtown\u201d nickname \u2014 wasn\u2019t the only one to get a warm reception. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, who is seen by some leading Democrats as a potential running mate should Harris become the nominee, spoke before she did. Buttigieg likewise expressed support for Biden and touted his accomplishments. \u201cWe aren\u2019t so much holding on to a democracy as we are building one, making it more perfect, in this extraordinary American project that will turn 250 years old in 2026, during the president\u2019s next term,\u201d Buttigieg said. Addressing the mood of many Democrats, Buttigieg added, \u201cThat\u2019s what is possible if we say no to the people out there banning books and yes to the people out there building bridges. That\u2019s why I don\u2019t just have dread about the worst that could happen, but hope for what comes next.\u201d Organizers said the event raised more than $2 million, even as some big-dollar donors have held back from writing checks amid growing concerns about Biden\u2019s candidacy, raising serious concerns about how long the campaign can continue operating in full force if circumstances don\u2019t change. Harris, who is being very careful with what she says during this period, did not speak separately to reporters traveling with her. But as she boarded Air Force Two and one shouted to ask whether she has spoken to Biden and whether he\u2019s well, she flashed a thumbs-up and said yes. At the event in front of a largely LGBTQ crowd, Harris talked about\u00a0her record on key issues, including performing same-sex weddings early as San Francisco district attorney in 2004, and contrasting that to her new opponent, Trump\u2019s running mate JD Vance, who opposed marriage equality and gender-affirming care. That, on top of Trump\u2019s own record rolling back LGBTQ protections, Harris charged, is enough reason to oppose them. Harris closed by invoking Harvey Milk, the famed gay political pioneer in San Francisco. \u201cThose who oppose progress will always try to suggest that a movement for freedom is somehow subversive and it undermines who we are as a nation. \u201cHarvey Milk liked to say, \u2018Hope will never be silent \u2014 and neither will we,\u2019\u201d Harris said.

{"id": "2024_07_20_us_flights-canceled-delayed-global-it-outage", "text": "Operations are gradually being restored but delays continue for a second day after \u201cthe largest IT outage in history\u201d disrupted sectors across the globe, leaving thousands of passengers stranded at airports, emergency communication services down and blood donation centers without vital shipments. Airlines, businesses, government agencies, health and emergency services, banks and schools and universities around the world ground to a halt or saw services disrupted due to a flawed software update for Microsoft Windows operating systems issued by the cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike, experts told CNN. CrowdStrike\u2019s CEO said a fix has been deployed, but experts say getting systems back in order will be a lengthy process. The outage affected an estimated 8.5 million Windows devices, less than 1 percent of all Windows machines, according to a Saturday blog post from Microsoft. \u201cWhile the percentage was small, the broad economic and societal impacts reflect the use of CrowdStrike by enterprises that run many critical services,\u201d Microsoft said. According to the tracking website FlightAware, more than 2,300 flights into, out of, or within the US have been\u00a0canceled and more than 6,000 delayed, as of Saturday afternoon. On Friday, more than 3,000 flights were canceled and more than 11,000 were delayed, according to\u00a0FlightAware.com. Worldwide, major airlines have said services are being restored. A majority of\u00a0United\u00a0Airlines\u00a0systems\u00a0have\u00a0recovered\u00a0from Friday\u2019s outage, the airline\u00a0said in a statement. \u201cWhile\u00a0most\u00a0of our\u00a0systems\u00a0have\u00a0recovered\u00a0from the worldwide third-party software outage, we\u00a0may\u00a0continue\u00a0to experience some disruption to our operation, including flight delays and cancellations,\u201d\u00a0United\u00a0said. Delta Air Lines is \u201ccontinuing its operational recovery\u201d after the outage prompted the airline to pause flying on Friday, according to a Saturday\u00a0morning update. Still, over 600 Delta flights have been canceled Saturday. \u201cAdditional cancelations are expected as some of Delta\u2019s technology continues to recover from Friday morning\u2019s vendor-caused issue,\u201d the update said. Jetstar Japan, Hong Kong Express and Cebu Pacific airlines said Saturday their operations are gradually being restored too. Cybercriminals capitalized on the chaos by promoting fake websites filled with malicious software designed to compromise unsuspecting victims, according to warnings from the US government and multiple cybersecurity professionals. Former McAfee CEO Dave DeWalt told CNN a group of private sector and government agencies worked overnight to \u201cascertain the threat\u201d and find a solution to the global outage. The call included the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency and other private and government organizations. CrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz apologized to customers Friday for the outage and said the company is working with those affected. \u201cWe understand the gravity of the situation and are deeply sorry for the inconvenience and disruption,\u201d Kurtz posted on X. \u201cWe are working with all impacted customers to ensure that systems are back up and they can deliver the services their customers are counting on.\u201d But it could be easier said than done: Manual restarts of individual systems take time and expertise some customers don\u2019t have, which is why companies have been slow to recover from the outage. Chaos continues for travelers Frustrated passengers lined up at airports backed up with flight cancellations and delays, some missing life events like funerals and birthdays. At Atlanta\u2019s Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport, long lines of passengers waited for assistance Saturday, with many flights still canceled or delayed. \u201cI was supposed to be in California for my mom\u2019s wedding,\u201d Richard Whitfield of Pasco County, FL told CNN\u2019s Isabel Rosales Saturday. Whitfield and his partner, Jonathan Shade, left Tampa on Thursday and missed their connecting flight in Atlanta due to poor weather conditions, delaying their landing and forcing the plane to refuel in Tallahassee. After their rescheduled flight on Friday was delayed many times, the couple\u00a0decided to cancel the trip and just head home. But with no available flights back to Tampa, Friday night, they spent their second night in an airport hotel. They were unable to get a voucher from Delta for either of their stays. \u201c(Richard has) been on hold for 24 hours,\u201d Shade told CNN. \u201cWhen he eventually got his number in line, it was 2,001.\u201d Two hours later, Richard\u2019s place in Delta Air Lines\u2019 virtual customer service queue was 2,300 in line, Shade said. Delta Air Lines has reported the most cancellations, with\u00a0more than\u00a0850 Delta and Delta Connection flights unable to depart. \u201cIf we can\u2019t do the flight, we will try for the car and if we can\u2019t do the car, it\u2019s just another night in a hotel and we will see what happens,\u201d Shade said. At last check, a rental car back to Tampa would cost the pair $600, Shade and Whitfield said. Amtrak is charging $1,000 for a one-way ticket to Tampa, they added. Whitfield tells CNN the whole ordeal has had an impact on him. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s been the domino effect that it has on humanity and everything that we need to survive: food, sleep, or water, housing,\u201d he said. After spending 48 hours in Atlanta, they found a Saturday evening flight back to Tampa they say they can only hope is not delayed or canceled. For now, there is nothing the couple can do but wait and \u201cget a good stiff drink,\u201d Shade and Whitfield said. In addition to the problems at airports, the outage has also caused delays at hotels and rental car companies. Major hotels, including Marriott International and some Hiltons, were impacted both in regard to payment processing and delays to check in-processes. Even Americans not traveling felt the effects of the outage in various facets of their everyday lives, including while trying to call 911 during emergencies in some areas, getting or renewing their driver\u2019s licenses or shipping or receiving packages. There were reports of 911 outages in various states, like Alaska, and cities, like Phoenix, where the system was down for hours but has since been restored. Driver\u2019s license offices were closed or had limited services in Texas, Tennessee, North Carolina and Georgia. Some hospitals had to cancel appointments and surgeries While most hospitals remained open to treat medical emergencies, some said an inability to access electronic medical records and order lab tests and prescriptions had caused them to cancel patient appointments and surgeries. Hospital workers scrambled to provide needed care to patients without the technology they rely on. Kim Brown was near the end of her shift Thursday night as a labor and delivery nurse at Kaiser Permanente in San Jose, California, when the hospital\u2019s computer systems, which it relies on to care for women in labor and their babies, went down. \u201cAll of our babies get little plastic tags that will set off an alarm if they get too close to an exit or an elevator. That went down,\u201d Brown said. \u201cIt was unnerving because we had zero information. It was just, \u2018Oh, well, everything\u2019s out now.\u2019\u201d With the outage posing a security risk to newborn babies, the hospital called security guards to sit by the elevators to keep them safe. At the postpartum care unit in Dignity Health California Hospital Medical Center in Los Angeles, nurse Laura Topete said she ran into a roadblock trying to get analgesic drugs for a woman who was in pain after delivery, but couldn\u2019t access the doctor\u2019s orders to see what kind of medications she could have. \u201cThe patient was in pain longer than she needed to be,\u201d Topete said. Epic Systems, a company that makes widely used electronic health records systems for hospitals and doctors\u2019 offices, said on Friday its Nebula cloud-based platform had been impacted by the outage overnight and some services, including telehealth visits, were not available during the outage. Another electronic medical records company, Veradigm, also said its systems were impacted by the CrowdStrike outage. A spokesperson for the US Department of Health and Human Services said it was \u201cworking to assess the impact of the CrowdStrike outage on patient care and HHS systems, services, and operations,\u201d along with federal, state, local and private sector partners. In addition to hospitals, blood donation centers experienced challenges and altered blood shipment methods due to flight delays. New York Blood Center, which supplies about 200 hospitals in the Northeast, initiated an emergency driving operation to distribute collected blood. And Blood Assurance was concerned for its planned shipment of at least 20 platelets \u2014 the disc-shaped fragments that help with clotting \u2014 due to flight issues. Government agencies were at a standstill The impacts of the global tech outage were felt across the US as countless government agencies waited for services to get back to normal. The mayor of Portland, Oregon, issued an emergency declaration due to the ongoing outage. It affected the city\u2019s servers in city data centers, employee computers and single sign-on to cloud services, Mayor Ted Wheeler said in a news release. In Southern California, the disruption caused connectivity issues at the Los Angeles County Superior Court and it temporarily limited jail bookings in San Diego County, officials said. Elsewhere, some voting locations in Arizona experienced outages in Maricopa County as early voting continued in the state\u2019s primary, according to the Maricopa County Elections Department. The county is the fourth-most populous in the US and is home to Phoenix, the county website said. The Social Security Administration closed its local offices to the public on Friday after the outage shut down numerous services. The agency said in a statement it expected longer wait times for the national 800 phone number, and some online services may be unavailable.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/20/us/flights-canceled-delayed-global-it-outage/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/21/2024", "section": "us"}}

In a statement, the university said his resignation is effective July 31. \u201cI need to step back for a time and focus more on the needs of my family while we rebuild more stable household systems,\u201d Sasse said, adding that he would continue to teach at the university.

{"id": "2024_07_20_us_texas-houston-power-outage", "text": "Theodore Doyle, an 81-year-old retired manager with the former US Customs Service, was waking up in his hot and muggy northeast Houston apartment in a bed soaked in sweat. Doyle ultimately checked into a $98-a-night hotel room late Tuesday, after enduring a compounding crisis of extreme heat and no power for more than a week with about 200 other seniors at an independent living facility in the Kingwood community. \u201cThere\u2019s no air circulating. It\u2019s just stifling and it\u2019s sort of tough to breathe,\u201d he told CNN before returning to his apartment when power was restored Thursday afternoon. \u201cI just couldn\u2019t take it anymore.\u201d During the outage, a generator powered one elevator and a large, air-conditioned lounge at the complex \u2013 a lifeline for many who are dependent on electric wheelchairs and scooters to get around and oxygen machines for pulmonary disease. At times, as many as 40 residents sought refuge in the lounge. Others remained in their stifling apartments. Some stayed with relatives. \u201cA friend just turned 95 about a month ago,\u201d Doyle said. \u201cAnother friend of mine is over 90 and quite a few of us are all over 80. It\u2019s tough. You\u2019re not as spry as you used to be.\u201d By Saturday evening, about 1,900 customers of Houston\u2019s main utility, CenterPoint Energy, were without power, according to PowerOutage.us. The number fluctuated throughout the day. It\u2019s unclear if those customers have been without power since Beryl hit the Golf Coast July 8 as a hurricane, leaving more than 2 million customers in the dark, mostly in the Houston area. More than 135,000 CenterPoint customers had no power on Monday night. The embattled utility said in a statement that customers without power were \u201cpredominantly isolated instances,\u201d where homes or equipment sustained severe damage from the storm. CenterPoint, which has 2.8 million customers in the Houston area, said some current outages could be related to thunderstorms Saturday morning. \u201cFor safety reasons, our crews pause their work when there is lightning,\u201d the statement said. At least 14 Houston-area deaths were confirmed to be hurricane-related, including seven people \u2013 ranging in age from 50 to 110 \u2013 who died from \u201cheat exposure due to power loss,\u201d according to the Harris County Institute of Forensic Sciences. Overall, more than 20 deaths in Harris and nearby counties were attributed to the storm, according to the Houston Chronicle and other local media outlets. Older people were especially vulnerable and, authorities warned, the number of fatalities could grow. For more than a week, some residents of the nation\u2019s fourth largest city were left to sleep in their cars, shuffle perilously with canes and walkers across dark rooms and corridors, and watch food and medications spoil and critical medical equipment become inoperable. At times, they cried in desperation after discovering the bodies of neighbors who succumbed to the heat following a comparatively mild Category 1 hurricane. \u201cIt is unimaginable this is happening in 2024,\u201d Denise Furlough, who delivered food, batteries and ice to her 86-year-old father during the more than a week without power in his Alameda Plaza home, told CNN Saturday. \u201cI was just frightened I might go over there and he wouldn\u2019t be alive.\u201d \u2018She didn\u2019t have to die\u2019 In Houston\u2019s Museum District on Tuesday, Pat Baker arrived at a condo complex to check on a neighbor with health problems who rented out her daughter\u2019s apartment. The neighbor didn\u2019t answer. \u201cI unlocked the door and found her,\u201d Baker, fighting back tears, told CNN affiliate KHOU. \u201cYou know, it\u2019s just been hot and miserable and I\u2019m just sick of this. I\u2019m just sick of it.\u201d Power was restored at the condo complex later that afternoon after the body was removed from the apartment, the station reported. The latest name on the Harris County list of confirmed Beryl-related deaths was Christine Davis, who had turned 110 in May, according to the 110 Club, a site about super-centenarians. She died Tuesday at Memorial Hermann Hospital Northeast from hyperthermia caused by \u201cenvironmental heat exposure due to power outage,\u201d according to the Harris County Institute of Forensic Sciences. Another confirmed storm victim was Pamela Jarrett, 64, who died of hyperthermia on July 11, days after the hurricane, in her home in Spring, Texas, just north of Houston. Relatives told CNN affiliate KTRK on Wednesday that Jarrett relied on a wheelchair and feeding tube. \u201cIt could have been avoided, and she didn\u2019t have to die,\u201d said her sister Janet, who took care of her and struggled to keep the feeding device charged during the outage. She said she tried to keep Jarrett cool with ice and water until she became unresponsive. \u201cAs much as I tried to save her,\u201d Janet Jarrett told the station, \u201cI couldn\u2019t save her.\u201d Power was restored in the Jarrett home on Tuesday. Utility pledges \u2018thorough review\u2019 In the city of Humble, about 20 miles north of Houston, Christina Bourgeois, her three children \u2013 ages 5 through 9 \u2013 and their dog Mimosa spent the night after the storm in her Dodge Journey outside their home. She kept the Dodge on, the air conditioner running because of the heat. \u201cI slept in the driver\u2019s seat,\u201d she told CNN Friday. \u201cIt was awful. You know, my younger son, I had to get up and take him inside to use the restroom.\u201d The children later stayed with relatives and Bourgeois, 32, spent every night in the car until power was restored on Wednesday. \u201cI would wake up every two or three hours or so to turn the air on and then turn it off,\u201d she said of the nights she spent alone in the Dodge.  \u201cI hadn\u2019t slept. I was exhausted. I was starting to swell. I had bags under my eyes. Any little noise would wake me up because I have the windows down, you know \u2026 Any kind of rustle of the leaves or, you know, even cars passing by, I would just wake up.\u201d Texas Gov. Greg Abbott last Sunday threatened executive action if CenterPoint Energy did not address concerns over the prolonged outage. And the Public Utilities Commission of Texas said it would investigate the company\u2019s response, according to Chairman Thomas Gleason. He told reporters Monday the utility\u2019s ability to maintain its infrastructure and its communication with customers has been called into question. CenterPoint Energy told CNN in a statement it was \u201ccommitted to doing a thorough review of our Hurricane Beryl response.\u201d \u201cWe are engaging with community leaders, elected officials, local clergy leadership and others across the area to learn about how we can be more responsive to their needs and concerns,\u201d the statement said. Doyle, before he returned to his apartment on Thursday, said he had about $150 worth of food on his refrigerator that went bad. He said he was unsure about the condition of some insulin he had left behind. He blamed the utility company for leaving thousands of Houstonians marooned in a broiling nightmare. \u201cYou have no idea how frustrating this is,\u201d he said. \u201cWe should not be subjected to this.\u201d Furlough, whose father, Julius Gordon, is a cancer survivor and has heart disease, said he \u2013 like many Houston residents \u2013 felt hopeless and abandoned until power to his home was restored on Tuesday. Her father told CNN, \u201cYou\u2019re just there. You just vegetate.\u201d CNN\u2019s Amy Simonson and Rebekah Riess contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/20/us/texas-houston-power-outage/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/21/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_07_20_us_global-it-outage-california-forecaster-trnd", "text": "As what was possibly the \u201clargest IT outage in history\u201d impacted computer systems across the globe this week, a Northern California weather forecaster found a creative \u2013 and hands-on \u2013 solution to keep his viewers updated as his news station\u2019s software remained offline. On Friday, many computer systems for healthcare, business, technology and government sectors worldwide crashed after cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike issued a software update for Microsoft Windows operating systems. The widespread disturbance affected 8.5 million Windows devices, or fewer than 1% of all Windows machines, Microsoft said Saturday. The lengthy process of restoring operations continued on Saturday. But early Friday morning, Preston Donion, a forecaster and multimedia journalist for CNN affiliate KRCR in Redding, California, says he woke up to chaos after \u201ceverything had gone completely haywire\u201d with the systems at his job the night before. \u201cThey didn\u2019t end up even running a broadcast on our stations at 10 and 11 (p.m.), so they were really kaput,\u201d Donion told CNN on Saturday. He says he rushed into work to find that, sure enough, they had no weather graphics available. Donion and his producer teamed up to figure out how they could display a weather forecast on air with the systems down, he said. \u201cBecause I have my numbers, I can get my forecast built, but I have no way to communicate that,\u201d recalled Donion, who\u2019s worked at KRCR since June 2022. He says he spent the first half hour of the show pulling up websites or screen sharing from one of the station\u2019s iPads and stepping off the screen to read numbers. \u201cBut I realized that wasn\u2019t very engaging, wasn\u2019t very effective,\u201d Donion said. About 45 minutes into the broadcast, the Washington native says he used a Sharpie and a pen to draw a rough sketch of a map he had saved as a reference for familiarizing himself with California. \u201cI just went to work on the back of a piece of paper that had my rundown on it, and just did my best,\u201d Donion said. His on-air solution to the tech fiasco turned out to be the hand-drawn maps of his coverage area, which he admitted to viewers weren\u2019t \u201cperfect\u201d renderings. \u201cI just drew this up,\u201d Donion can be seen telling local viewers in a video he shared to his X account Friday. \u201cI know Trinity County looks like it\u2019s been on somewhat of a diet there, and things are a little square in Modoc County, but I wanted to give you a visual.\u201d He also shared on air the seven-day forecast using a chart he typed in his phone\u2019s Notes app, the video shows. \u201cI thought it was the best way to just kind of put together some visuals without having computer technology, so it was fun to me,\u201d said Donion. One viewer commented the retro approach to the forecast took them back to the 1970s, when TV meteorologists used paper maps and magnets in their weather centers, he said. \u201cI definitely got some messages on Facebook and on Twitter saying, \u2018Hey, you know, thanks for adapting. We appreciate you just getting the information out,\u2019\u201d Donion said. \u201cOther meteorologists have reached out and said, \u2018You know, I was thinking I\u2019d have to get my magnets out,\u2019\u201d he added. Many of KRCR\u2019s systems were back online by the end of Donion\u2019s shift around 11 a.m. local time Friday, and the evening shows went smoothly, he shared. CNN Meteorologist Elisa Raffa gave kudos to Donion for his quick thinking. While learning about meteorology in school, Raffa says weather students learned to hand-draw fronts and storm systems. \u201cIt\u2019s a skill you never think you\u2019ll need again \u2013 until the computers go out,\u201d Raffa said. \u201cAnd if you ask a 30-plus-year veteran in the industry, they\u2019d be happy to remind us that this was how weather was done before the magic of green screens,\u201d she added. \u201cMarkers, chalk, magnets and a whole lot of paper were used to get a forecast on TV. It\u2019s amazing how much we depend on technology now!\u201d CNN\u2019s Dalia Faheid contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/20/us/global-it-outage-california-forecaster-trnd/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/21/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_07_20_politics_trump-treatment-women", "text": "When Sarah Huckabee Sanders faced what she described as \u201crelentless attacks from the left,\u201d it was former President Donald Trump who comforted her, she said. Trump attorney Alina Habba described the Republican nominee as her \u201cfriend.\u201d And Kai Trump, his oldest grandchild, made a surprise appearance to share \u201cthe side of my grandpa that people don\u2019t often see.\u201d A common theme rang through speeches from women at this year\u2019s Republican National Convention: Despite how Trump\u2019s public treatment of women\u00a0may seem to some, he is an advocate for them behind closed doors. In speech after speech in Milwaukee this week, women spoke of quiet moments when they said Trump comforted them in the wake of Democratic attacks or media criticism, advocated for them professionally or showed compassion or familial care. They described him as a friend and a loving father and grandfather in the moments people don\u2019t see. Trump has long been known for the brash, even vulgar way he sometimes speaks about women. He has also been dogged by allegations about sexual misconduct and extramarital affairs. Accusations of sexism plagued his 2016 presidential campaign, a race he won despite the October release of a video in which he bragged about being able to grab women by their genitals because he\u2019s a celebrity. In 2023,\u00a0a civil court\u00a0found Trump liable\u00a0of sexually abusing writer E. Jean Carroll in the 1990s. The former president was later ordered to pay\u00a0millions of dollars\u00a0in damages for his defamatory statements disparaging Carroll and denying her rape allegations. Speeches from women, including his family members and people who have worked for him, fit into a broader effort at the convention to soften his public image. \u201cI was insulted as a guest at the White House Correspondents Dinner, my family was denied service and kicked out of a restaurant, and a parent at my 3-year-old son\u2019s preschool spit on my car,\u201d Sanders, who served as one of Trump\u2019s White House press secretaries, said during her Tuesday night address. \u201cAnd in those moments, it was President Trump who defended me.\u201d Sanders, now the governor of Arkansas, said at one point the former president\u00a0pulled her aside and\u00a0told her, \u201cSarah, you\u2019re smart, you\u2019re beautiful, you\u2019re tough, and they attack you because you\u2019re good at your job.\u201d Habba, one of Trump\u2019s lawyers, said she wanted to take the audience \u201cbehind the headlines\u201d to reveal \u201chis character, his kindness\u201d and his commitment to the country. \u201cPresident Trump championed my journey, empowering me to be who I became today,\u201d Habba said. Kellyanne Conway, Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign manager and White House senior counselor, praised the former president for elevating women to key roles in his campaign and administration. \u201cHe saw something in me and the other working moms that perhaps we did not see in ourselves,\u201d Conway said. Family members, from his granddaughter \u2013 who said the former president bragged to friends when she made the honor roll \u2013 to his son\u2019s partners shared their personal experiences with him. \u201cI know what you hear out there about Donald Trump,\u201d Lara Trump, the former president\u2019s daughter-in-law and the co-chair of the Republican National Committee, said in her speech. \u201cBut when I look at Donald Trump, I see a wonderful father, father-in-law and, of course, grandfather to my two young children, Luke and Carolina.\u201d History of sexism and misconduct allegations The effort to reframe Trump\u2019s treatment of women was part of a larger push\u00a0to\u00a0soften the former president\u2019s image in the wake of the assassination attempt last weekend. \u201cThe media\u2019s negative portrayal of President Trump and his treatment of women is entirely false,\u201d Karoline Leavitt, the Trump campaign\u2019s national press secretary, said in a statement. \u201cPresident Trump is loved by millions of women across the country, and those who know him personally, myself included, will tell you he\u2019s supportive, generous, and kind.\u201d Leavitt added that during Trump\u2019s first term he supported policies such as expanding access to\u00a0paid family leave\u00a0and child care and that he would do so again. Broadening the former president\u2019s appeal to women will be key in November. Biden\u2019s success in swing states in 2020 is attributable in part to his stronger support among women turned off by Trump\u2019s brashness. In 2020,\u00a0Biden won 57% of women, compared with 42% who backed Trump, according to CNN exit polls. But it\u2019s not clear whether praise of the former president\u2019s private behavior will impact how people perceive years of his public behavior. Trump had faced allegations of sexism since he sought the Republican nomination in 2016. During a 2015 GOP primary debate, moderator Megyn Kelly asked\u00a0then-candidate Trump about his history of referring to women he disagreed with as \u201cfat pigs, dogs, slobs and disgusting animals.\u201d He later\u00a0blasted Kelly and said she had\u00a0\u201cblood coming out of her wherever.\u201d During that first campaign,\u00a0he insinuated that both Carly Fiorina, one of his Republican opponents, and the wife of Sen.\u00a0Ted Cruz of Texas, another 2016\u00a0rival, were unattractive. And in the final weeks of\u00a0that\u00a0election, old Access Hollywood footage of him bragging about being able to\u00a0kiss\u00a0women and grab them\u00a0by their genitals prompted mass condemnation from members of his own party. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, his 2016 Democratic opponent, argued that Trump\u2019s past treatment of women made him unfit to be president. \u201cWhen I think about what we now know about Donald Trump and what he has been doing for 30 years, he sure had spent a lot of time demeaning, degrading, insulting and assaulting women,\u201d Clinton\u00a0said\u00a0at a Florida rally days before the election. Clinton\u2019s loss, and fears over what a Trump presidency would entail,\u00a0prompted global Women\u2019s March protests. Since then, other parts of his background have been scrutinized. Earlier this year, Trump\u00a0was found guilty\u00a0of 34 felony counts of falsifying business records to cover up an alleged extramarital affair with a porn star. And then there is Carroll\u2019s allegation that Trump sexually abused her in a luxury department store dressing room in the spring of 1996. Trump faced no jail time in the civil trial, but he was ordered to pay $88 million total for defamation. Trump has denied the affair at the center of the hush money case and denied assaulting Carroll. The former president has also\u00a0denied about a dozen other sexual misconduct allegations, including groping and sexual harassment, that took place before he took office. In 2017, Trump called the claims \u201cfake news.\u201d Sanders, the White House press secretary at the time, was asked whether the White House\u2019s official position was that all the women were lying. \u201cYeah, we have been clear on that from the beginning, and the president has spoken on it,\u201d she said at an October 2017 press briefing. For much of the 2024 campaign, Democrats have focused their criticisms of Trump on his policies, specifically his appointment of Supreme Court justices who voted to overturn federal abortion protections. But as President\u00a0Joe\u00a0Biden has faced increased pressure within his own party to step aside, he has started to broaden his attacks. During a rally in Detroit earlier this month, Biden referenced both the hush money case and the civil case involving Carroll. \u201cMr. Trump raped her,\u201d Biden said, referencing what the judge in the Carroll case wrote. In Milwaukee, however, Trump\u2019s criminal cases were framed as further evidence of persecution he\u2019s suffered for his supporters. \u201cEvery attack on President Trump only strengthens our movement,\u201d said Habba, who represented Trump in the Carroll defamation suit. \u201cSham indictments and baseless allegations will not deter us, because the only crime President Trump has committed is loving America.\u201d This headline has been updated.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/20/politics/trump-treatment-women/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/21/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_07_18_us_ruben-gutierrez-stay-of-execution", "text": "The US Supreme Court granted a stay of execution for a Texas man 20 minutes before he was to receive a lethal injection Tuesday evening. The inmate has long maintained DNA testing would help prove he wasn\u2019t responsible for the fatal stabbing of an 85-year-old woman during a home robbery decades ago. The nation\u2019s high court issued the indefinite stay shortly before inmate Ruben Gutierrez was to have been taken to the death chamber of a Huntsville prison. Gutierrez\u00a0was condemned for the 1998 killing of Escolastica Harrison at her home in Brownsville in Texas\u2019 southern tip. Prosecutors said the killing of the mobile home park manager and retired teacher was part of an attempt to steal more than $600,000 she had hidden in her home because of her mistrust of banks. Gutierrez has sought DNA testing that he claims would help prove he had no role in her death. His attorneys have said there\u2019s no physical or forensic evidence connecting him to the killing. Two others also were charged in the case. The high court\u2019s brief order, released about 5:40 p.m. CDT, said its stay of execution would remain in effect until the justices decide whether they should review his appeal request. If the court denies the request, the execution reprieve would automatically be lifted. Gutierrez, who had been set to die after 6 p.m. CDT, was in a holding cell near the death chamber when prison warden Kelly Strong advised him of the court\u2019s intervention. \u201cHe was visibly emotional,\u201d prison spokeswoman Amanda Hernandez said, adding he was not expecting the court stay. \u201cWe asked him if he wanted to make a statement but he needed a minute.\u201d \u201cHe turned around to the back of the cell, covered his mouth. He was tearing up, speechless. He was shocked.\u201d She said Gutierrez then prayed with a prison chaplain and added: \u201cGod is great!\u201d Gutierrez has had several previous execution dates in recent years that have been delayed, including\u00a0over issues\u00a0related to\u00a0having a spiritual adviser in the death chamber. In June 2020, Gutierrez was\u00a0about an hour away\u00a0from execution when he got a stay from the Supreme Court. In the most recent appeal, Gutierrez\u2019s attorneys had asked the Supreme Court to intervene, arguing Texas has denied his right under state law to post-conviction DNA testing that would show he would not have been eligible for the death penalty. His attorneys argued that various items recovered from the crime scene \u2014 including nail scrapings from Harrison, a loose hair wrapped around one of her fingers and various blood samples from within her home \u2014 have never been tested. \u201cGutierrez faces not only the denial of (DNA testing) that he has repeatedly and consistently sought for over a decade, but moreover, execution for a crime he did not commit. No one has any interest in a wrongful execution,\u201d Gutierrez\u2019s attorneys wrote in their petition to the Supreme Court. Shawn Nolan, an attorney for Gutierrez, expressed pleasure with the court\u2019s decision late Tuesday. \u201cWe are hopeful that now the Court has stepped in to stop this execution, we can ultimately accomplish the DNA testing to prove that Mr. Gutierrez should not be executed now or in the future,\u201d Nolan said in an emailed statement. Prosecutors have said the request for DNA testing is a delay tactic and that Gutierrez was convicted on various pieces of evidence, including a confession in which he admitted to planning the robbery and that he was inside her home when she was killed. Gutierrez was convicted under Texas\u2019 law of parties, which says a person can be held liable for the actions of others if they assist or encourage the commission of a crime. In their response to Gutierrez\u2019s Supreme Court petition, the Texas Attorney General\u2019s Office and the Cameron County District Attorney\u2019s Office had said state law does not provide \u201cfor postconviction DNA testing to show innocence of the death penalty and, even if it did, Gutierrez would not be entitled to it.\u201d Lower courts have previously denied Gutierrez\u2019s requests for DNA testing. Authorities said Gutierrez befriended Harrison so he could rob her. Prosecutors said Harrison hid her money underneath a false floor in her bedroom closet. Two of Harrison\u2019s nephews and three of their friends were to have witnessed the execution. They declined to comment on the court\u2019s reprieve. Police charged three people in this case: Rene Garcia, Pedro Gracia and Gutierrez. Rene Garcia is serving a life sentence in a Texas prison while Pedro Gracia, who police said was the getaway driver, remains at large.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/18/us/ruben-gutierrez-stay-of-execution/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/21/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_02_22_us_rise-above-movement-ruling-on-hold", "text": "After a federal judge made the rare decision\u00a0to\u00a0dismiss\u00a0a criminal\u00a0case\u00a0against\u00a0two White\u00a0nationalists suspected of inciting violence at political rallies, an appeals court on Thursday put the ruling on hold and one of the men was re-arrested. The\u00a0appeals\u00a0court\u00a0stay came after the\u00a0highly\u00a0unusual\u00a0ruling\u00a0of US District Court Judge Cormac Carney\u00a0to\u00a0dismiss\u00a0the\u00a0case\u00a0against\u00a0Robert Rundo and Robert Boman,\u00a0saying they were being selectively prosecuted while far left groups weren\u2019t. The two men were under indictment for conspiracy, riots, and aiding and abetting. Rundo, who was released after the ruling, was taken back into custody by federal agents, a law enforcement official involved in the investigation told CNN Thursday. Rundo was believed to have traveled to the US-Mexico border after his release, a law enforcement source told CNN. The Justice Department obtained a warrant to take him back into custody, saying he was \u201can extremely serious flight risk.\u201d Rundo will now remain in custody while the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals considers motions involving his release, according to court records. Court records show Rundo\u2019s attorneys had signaled their intention to possibly request Carney\u2019s intervention yet again in the matter involving their client, but in the new order the higher court blocked Carney and other judges from any further action while they consider the matter. \u201cNo lower court may order h\ufeffis release absent further order of this Court,\u201d the Ninth Circuit commanded in their order. Rundo and Boman were\u00a0allegedly members of the\u00a0Rise Above Movement, RAM, which Carney described as \u201ca group of far-right,\u00a0white\u00a0supremacist\u00a0nationalists, who attended several rallies and protests during which they engaged in violent acts.\u201d They were both indicted under the\u00a0federal\u00a0Anti-Riot Act \u2013 referred\u00a0to by Carney as \u201ca-once-rarely-used criminal statute.\u201d The men\u00a0are believed\u00a0to\u00a0have recruited and given combat training\u00a0to\u00a0like-minded members, then incited violence at political rallies in Huntington Beach and Berkeley, California,\u00a0and in Charlottesville, Virginia. \u201cBeginning around March 2017, (Rundo and Boman) agreed\u00a0to\u00a0riot at political rallies and organized demonstrations, where they would assault individuals they believed were associated with Antifa and related far-left groups,\u201d Carney wrote. The defense presented a motion\u00a0to\u00a0dismiss\u00a0the\u00a0case,\u00a0saying the men were the victims of selective prosecution. \u201cIt is not uncommon\u00a0for a defendant\u00a0to\u00a0raise selective prosecution\u00a0as a defense but it is extraordinarily uncommon\u00a0for that defense\u00a0to\u00a0succeed because the defendant has\u00a0to\u00a0prove that other similarity positioned people were not prosecuted,\u201d\u00a0said CNN senior legal analyst Elie Honig. But Carney\u00a0took exception\u00a0to\u00a0what he viewed as an imbalance by\u00a0federal prosecutors in charging\u00a0White\u00a0nationalists\u00a0with crimes under the Anti-Riot Act, but \u2013 in his view \u2013 not similarly charging far left agitators. \u201cThe government cannot prosecute RAM members such as Defendants while ignoring the violence of members of Antifa and related far-left groups because RAM engaged in what the government and many believe is more offensive speech,\u201d wrote Carney. \u201cBy many accounts, members of Antifa and related far-left groups engaged in worse conduct and in fact instigated much of the violence that broke out at these otherwise constitutionally protected rallies to silence the protected speech of the supporters of President Trump,\u201d Carney wrote,\u00a0adding he viewed prosecuting far right rioters while ignoring far left instigators as \u201cconstitutionally impermissible.\u201d \u201cSuch selective prosecution\u00a0leaves the troubling impression\u00a0that the government believes speech\u00a0on\u00a0the left more deserving of protection\u00a0than speech\u00a0on\u00a0the right,\u201d wrote Carney. Following widespread civil unrest in the country in 2020,\u00a0federal\u00a0prosecutors did\u00a0bring more than\u00a0200\u00a0cases\u00a0against\u00a0individuals alleged\u00a0to\u00a0have engaged in violence during protests\u00a0after the police killing of George Floyd. Some\u00a0cases were for riot-related crimes and others for lesser offenses usually handled by local authorities, not\u00a0federal\u00a0prosecutors. At the time, then-Attorney General William Barr urged\u00a0federal\u00a0prosecutors\u00a0to get\u00a0tougher in bringing more\u00a0cases, including exploring using a rarely used sedition law, but some\u00a0federal\u00a0prosecutors were taken aback by the notion\u00a0of charging protestors with violating\u00a0a law that makes it a crime\u00a0to\u00a0conspire\u00a0to\u00a0overthrow the government. Barr\u00a0frequently lashed out at leftist groups, including publicly decrying Antifa, but despite his threats\u00a0to\u00a0go after the group, the Justice Department under his leadership did not bring widespread charges\u00a0against\u00a0so-called Antifa members \u2013 an amalgamation\u00a0of individuals\u00a0holding various views, which, unlike various neo-Nazi and\u00a0White\u00a0supremacist groups, has no formal leadership structure or membership. Attorneys for both Rundo and Boman did not respond to CNN\u2019s multiple requests for comment on the recent court action. Judge Carney is no stranger\u00a0to\u00a0controversial\u00a0rulings. Late last year, he blocked parts of\u00a0a California law that\u00a0would have banned carrying concealed weapons\u00a0in a multitude of public places.\u00a0 And in 2014,\u00a0he deemed California\u2019s death penalty unconstitutional,\u00a0calling the administration\u00a0of the state\u2019s system \u201cdysfunctional.\u201d Carney was\u00a0once the chief judge of the Central District of California, but stepped down after making a\u00a0racially insensitive remark\u00a0about a\u00a0top\u00a0administrative official at the\u00a0court,\u00a0according\u00a0to\u00a0the Los Angeles Times.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/02/22/us/rise-above-movement-ruling-on-hold/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/21/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_07_18_us_seattle-police-officer-fired-jaahnavi-kandula", "text": "A Seattle police officer has been fired over the\u00a0\u201cdehumanizing laughter\u201d\u00a0and\u00a0\u201ccruel comments\u201d\u00a0he made after\u00a0the 2023 death of an\u00a0Indian graduate student\u00a0who was struck by a police vehicle, the police chief says. Seattle interim Police Chief Sue Rahr terminated former officer Daniel Auderer on Wednesday and justified her decision to the department in an internal email, attaching the department\u2019s disciplinary action report alongside it. \u201cThere is no doubt that the named officer\u2019s cruel comments and callous laughter about the tragic death caused deep pain to Ms. Kandula\u2019s family, but also immeasurable damage to the public trust of police in the Seattle community, across the nation, and around the world,\u201d Rahr wrote in the internal memo, noting many in the community said Auderer\u2019s \u201cdehumanizing laughter\u201d heard on video was \u201cmore outrageous and disturbing\u201d even than Kandula\u2019s death. \u201cIt is my duty as the leader of this organization to uphold the high standards necessary to maintain public trust,\u201d Rahr wrote. \u201cFor me to allow the officer to remain on our force would only bring further dishonor to the entire department.\u201d On January 23, 2023, Jaahnavi Kandula, a 23-year-old graduate student from Andhra Pradesh, India, was fatally struck by Seattle Police Officer Kevin Dave\u2019s police patrol vehicle while she on a crosswalk. Eight months after the incident, police released body-worn police camera footage\u00a0that captured a phone conversation in which Auderer, the day after he was sent to the scene to examine if the officer whose vehicle hit her had been impaired, can be heard laughing, saying Kandula\u2019s life had \u201climited value.\u201d \u201cBut she is dead,\u201d Auderer says on the body-worn camera footage, apparently in response to the person on the phone. \u201cNo, it\u2019s a regular person,\u201d Auderer then says. Moments later, he replies: \u201cYeah, just write a check\u201d and laughs. \u201cYeah, $11,000. She was 26 anyway,\u201d he adds, mistaking Kandula\u2019s age. \u201cShe had limited value.\u201d CNN has reached out to Auderer for comment but did not immediately receive a response. The video\u2019s release\u00a0last year sparked\u00a0outrage\u00a0across the nation, especially within the South Asian diaspora \u2013\u00a0inspiring rallies,\u00a0meetings with elected officials\u00a0and\u00a0online petitions\u00a0demanding justice for Kandula. It also grabbed the attention of onscreen celebrities like Priyanka Chopra, Farhan Akhtar and Lilly Singh, who posted online about her death. Auderer, who is also vice president of the Seattle Police Officers Guild, \u201cintended the comment as a mockery of lawyers,\u201d he wrote in an August 8 letter to the city\u2019s Office of Police Accountability\u00a0released by\u00a0the Seattle Police Officers Guild. \u201cI was imitating what a lawyer tasked with negotiating the case would be saying and being sarcastic to express that they shouldn\u2019t be coming up with crazy arguments to minimize the payment.\u201d CNN has reached out to the Seattle Police Officers Guild for comment. \u201cI believe the\u00a0impact\u00a0of his actions is so devastating that it cannot be mitigated by his\u00a0intent\u00a0to keep his conversation private,\u201d Rahr wrote in her email to the police department. \u201cThe hurt his words have inflicted on Ms. Kandula\u2019s family cannot be erased.\u201d \u201cThe actions (of) this individual police officer have brought shame on the Seattle Police Department and our entire profession, making the job of every police officer more difficult,\u201d she continued. The body-worn camera footage was provided to the King County Prosecutor\u2019s Office as part of the fatality case, according to Rahr. The office announced in February it would not file criminal charges against Dave \u2013 whose patrol vehicle struck Kandula \u2013 saying it \u201clacks sufficient evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Officer Kevin Dave was impaired by drugs or alcohol, driving in a reckless manner, or driving with disregard for the safety of others.\u201d The city\u2019s Office of Police Accountability recommended in January that Auderer be terminated following an investigation that found the officer violated the department\u2019s standards and duties policy and bias-free policing policy, a spokesperson told CNN. Kandula was from the Kurnool District in Andhra Pradesh and spoke Telugu, the president of the Telugu Association of North America, Niranjan Srungavarapu, previously told CNN. The group helped return her remains to India in January, he said. She had come to the United States in 2021 to pursue a master\u2019s degree in information systems in the College of Engineering at Northeastern University\u2019s Seattle campus, according to the school. She would have graduated in December. \u201cJaahnavi, a young soul full of dreams and hopes, came to the United States with the aspiration to pursue her master\u2019s degree and be a beacon of support for her family,\u201d the association said in a statement to its Seattle community and members. \u201cHer future was a shining light, cruelly extinguished.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/18/us/seattle-police-officer-fired-jaahnavi-kandula/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/21/2024", "section": "us"}}

Sherry Holtz, who was 50 at the time of her death, was found dead on December 4, 1999, a day after she was last seen at a bar in Sanford, Florida, authorities said at a Friday news conference. A person collecting cans in the woods discovered Holtz\u2019s body lying on a concrete slab about 20 feet into a wood line in Sanford, according to Sanford Police Department spokesperson Bianca Gillett. \u201cThis was \u2026 there\u2019s no other way to describe it but a brutal homicide,\u201d Gillett said. Holtz\u2019s neck was cut and there were signs of strangulation, blunt force trauma and sexual battery, authorities said. A lock blade knife was found near her body with blood and other DNA on it, but since the samples were not large enough, it was difficult to perform testing in 2000, according to Gillett. Investigators preserved the knife and reopened the case in May 2023. Authorities confirmed last month the blood on the knife was Holtz\u2019 and additional DNA on the knife belonged to Gary Durrance, 74. Durrance, who was Holtz\u2019s longtime boyfriend, was arrested on Thursday and charged with second-degree homicide, Gillett said. CNN has been unable to determine if Durrance has obtained legal representation at this time. The couple lived at a home in Sanford with three other people who were interviewed by investigators at the time of the homicide. The roommates said the couple had an argument and on December 2, 1999, Durrance kicked Holtz out of the house. Authorities say Durrance had denied being with Holtz on the night of the homicide. The bar Holtz was last seen at was about half a mile away from where her body was later found, Gillett said. \u201cSherry Holtz was brutally murdered and left behind in the woods as if her life had no value. This was someone\u2019s mother, someone\u2019s daughter,\u201d Sanford police chief Cecil Smith said in a statement. \u201cDurrance will now face justice for the horrible and despicable things that he did,\u201d Smith said. \u201cI hope his arrest brings a little comfort to those that loved Sherry and have waited 24 years for this moment.\u201d Durrance is being held at Seminole County\u2019s John E. Polk Correctional Facility and has a court appearance scheduled for September 10, according to jail records. CNN\u2019s Chenelle Woody and Ashley R.

{"id": "2024_07_16_us_trump-rally-security-errors-list", "text": "Security errors, lapses and missed opportunities to stop a gunman led to the first shooting of a US president or former president in more than a generation. Here are several issues and problems identified by CNN that could or should have been addressed before the attack on former President Donald Trump. In addition, CNN Chief Law Enforcement and Intelligence Analyst John Miller provided his analysis of some of the issues and their importance. Unsecured rooftop in range of the stage and with clear line of sight The building used by the gunman was outside the \u201chard perimeter\u201d set by the United States Secret Service inside which every person is screened. But less than 500 feet from the stage, the building was within shooting range and had a clear line of sight to where the former president stood to address the crowd. \u201cThis is a key factor in protective planning: What structures have a line of sight to the protectee, especially if that also includes high ground, a window, or a rooftop,\u201d Miller explained. \u201cThis building encompassed all those elements,\u00a0and it was within a very viable range for a rifle shot.\u201d Shooter was apparently seen acting suspiciously early by security cordon\n                   The shooter was spotted by local law enforcement who thought he might have been acting suspiciously near the magnetometers on Saturday, according to a senior law enforcement official. They put it out over their radio to keep an eye on him \u2013 and that information was passed to Secret Service as well, according to the source. When the shooter left the area of the magnetometers, he apparently wasn\u2019t seen again until people alerted law enforcement in a field outside the event that he was on the rooftop. About an hour before the incident, a person wearing clothing resembling the gunman\u2019s was also captured on video in front of the building whose roof the shooter later climbed, according to footage obtained by CNN affiliate WTAE. Pennsylvania State Police told WTAE they are looking into the video as a part of the investigation. CNN has reached out\u00a0to the state police for more information. A source told CNN that about 19 minutes before the shooting, law enforcement was trying to locate the shooter, but they could not find him until he was on the roof. Building access not controlled No one stopped the shooter from reaching the roof of the American Glass Research building. Potential confusion about law enforcement presence Snipers from the Butler County Emergency Services Unit were in the same complex but were not aware of the gunman on the roof, a source familiar with the ongoing investigation told CNN. They were positioned on the second floor, watching the rally crowd, the source said. Miller raised questions about the Secret Service\u2019s approach to securing that building: \u201cIn the initial planning to secure this event,\u00a0if that building was identified as a \u2018high-ground threat\u2019 for a potential sniper attack, did the Secret Service set specific requirements for the police about access control around that building, or did they just instruct them to\u00a0\u2018keep an eye out for anything suspicious?\u2019 \u201cThose are going to be key questions in these after-action reviews,\u201d he added. Agencies initially blamed each other The Secret Service was \u201csolely responsible\u201d for implementation of security at the rally, Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle told CNN\u2019s Whitney Wild. \u201cAt that particular site, we divided up areas of responsibility, but the Secret Service is totally responsible for the design and implementation and the execution of the site,\u201d she told CNN Tuesday evening. But Cheatle earlier told ABC News her agents only \u201cshared support\u201d for the building used for the shooting. \u201cWe sought assistance from our local counterparts for the outer perimeter,\u201d she said. \u201cThere was local police in that building \u2013 there was local police in the area that were responsible for the outer perimeter of the building.\u201d Cheatle said in the same interview that protection for Trump was the responsibility of the Secret Service and \u201cthe buck stops with me.\u201d Miller explained: \u201cAs part of the \u2018outer perimeter,\u2019 that building was the responsibility of local law enforcement, but that distinction only goes so far, and the Secret Service concedes that when the director says, \u2018The buck stops here.\u2019\u201d Crowd flagged gunman on roof almost 2 minutes before shooting Attendees in the crowd noticed the gunman on the roof nearly two minutes before the shots were fired, according to a CNN analysis of witness video and the official video feed of Trump\u2019s speech. As Trump questioned if Biden \u201cwas doing the job,\u201d someone on the video said, \u201cLook they\u2019re all pointing.\u201d One minute and 57 seconds later, gunfire can be heard. \u201cMy wife ran up to law enforcement and was trying to tell them where he was,\u201d Mike DiFrischia, a witness who took video of the shooting, told CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett. \u201cBut they couldn\u2019t seem to see him because they weren\u2019t in the right spot to see him on the roof. They were too close to the building.\u201d Local officer unable to tackle gunman before he fired at stage Butler Township police officers were alerted to calls about a suspicious person near the rally on Saturday, the head of another law enforcement agency told CNN. They discovered the man on the roof and one local officer hoisted another to get up to the ledge, Butler County Sheriff Michael T. Slupe said. The shooter turned around, saw the officer peering over and pointed his gun at him. The officer let go of the ledge to \u201ctake cover\u201d and save his life. The gunman then started firing from the rooftop.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/16/us/trump-rally-security-errors-list/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/21/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_07_20_politics_democratic-consensus-harris-should-biden-step-aside", "text": "No one quite knows what the process of picking a new nominee would be if Joe Biden did step aside \u2013 but many Democrats say that any process is likelier than ever to quickly end with Vice President Kamala Harris as the nominee. The informal conversations about how a fight to replace Biden at the top of the ticket would play out have been raging for weeks behind the scenes. But uncertainty about the process has been so unclear it\u2019s given multiple Democrats \u2013 even those with serious concerns about Biden \u2013 pause about coming out against the president\u2019s candidacy,\u00a0given\u00a0that what comes next could be even messier. \u201cF**k it, I\u2019m coconut pilled. I just want this to stop,\u201d said one well-known Democratic operative, referring to the online meme that has taken off from an old video of the vice president telling a story of her mother saying, \u201cYou think you just fell out of a coconut tree?\u201d It\u2019s not that everyone has suddenly\u00a0coalesced \u2013 but exhaustion is gelling into consensus. Internal polls that show Harris would at least be more helpful to boosting Democratic enthusiasm and aiding down ballot races are getting passed around. Arguments that she would\u00a0be fastest to\u00a0put together a campaign are landing harder. Daydreams of her making a more active and vigorous case against Donald Trump are taking root. Many are deliberately holding off talking about hypotheticals as Biden aides say he plans to get back on the campaign trail next week\u00a0once he recovers from Covid-19. But if that suddenly changes, two dozen leading Democratic politicians and operatives told CNN, they can\u2019t realistically see this\u00a0ending\u00a0any other way. Some are pushing for a fast and closed process, where delegates would bless the swap as part of their planned pre-convention virtual nomination plan. Some reject the idea of a coronation, either because they\u00a0prefer others\u00a0or don\u2019t like the way that would look. But \u2013 though there are musings about quickly creating a series of blitz primaries or town halls \u2013 no one can agree how that would work with just over 100 days until the election and much less\u00a0than that before\u00a0Democrats are scheduled to gather in Chicago. Still, it\u2019s an idea some Harris backers support, doubting that anyone serious would challenge her, as much chest puffing as there is behind the scenes. Multiple Democratic members of Congress who have called for Biden to go declined on Friday when asked by CNN if they were ready to say they want Harris to be the nominee. If nothing else, people connected with several of the other possible most serious options and others acknowledge, they would likely feel boxed in by both party loyalty and their own future ambitions. Pressure will be high to unify after the last month of infighting, and anyone who takes her on would be risking torpedoing their reputation with the base in a potential 2028 open primary if she were seen as weakened by that and went on to lose. Some\u00a0Democrats\u00a0believe, even with the threat of early ballot deadlines, it could be settled on the floor of the convention in late August. If this stretches out that long, though, multiple Democrats predicted that the hunger for resolution will only\u00a0intensify. That\u2019s become ever more likely, those politicians and operatives say, both by how much closer they are to Election Day and by how impressed they\u2019ve been by how the vice president has handled these weeks of Democratic crisis.\u00a0They argue the vice president has not been caught scheming, even in private conversations, and instead has showcased being fiery and loyal to Biden at\u00a0a series of campaign stops, which will continue on Saturday at a fundraiser she\u2019s headlining in Provincetown, Massachusetts. \u201cI do believe it has to be the vice president. She\u2019s campaigning vigorously under the mantle and she\u2019s the natural successor. It\u2019s going to be important in the scenario that the president isn\u2019t the nominee that we rally around her immediately,\u201d said one Democratic House member who asked not to be named so as not to be seen undercutting the president. Biden\u2019s hand would matter Few can conceive of Biden stepping aside and not tapping his running mate to take over. To do otherwise would be a devastating insult to her of the sort that pained Biden himself so much when Barack Obama turned to Hillary Clinton\u00a0over him ahead of the 2016 election. He\u2019d also be undercutting his own judgment in picking her four years ago as ready for the job, which he reiterated at his news conference last week. And it would mean passing over a Black vice president after Black voters and Black leaders\u2014 including South Carolina Rep. Jim Clyburn, who has said repeatedly he wants Harris if not Biden \u2014 not only sustained him to victory in 2020 but are some of the ones standing most strongly with him through this now. That kind of support would likely only lead to more, which would be convincing to delegates and voters alike \u2014 and make taking her on, even with her history of a failed 2020 campaign and rocky start in the vice presidency,\u00a0harder and harder. Eleni Kounalakis, the lieutenant governor of California and a Democratic convention delegate who is part of its rules and bylaws committee \u2013 as well as an old friend of Harris \u2013 said that it\u2019s important to remember, if the president were to step down,\u00a0that he won Democratic primaries while talking about \u201cBiden-Harris\u201d accomplishments. \u201cWhen people voted for him as the nominee they were voting for this ticket, so it just has to be concluded that the best way to validate the vote of the primary voters is to support the vice president as our nominee,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s so much respect for President Biden that if he asked delegates to support her, even with a public chaotic media swirl, I believe most delegates would honor his wishes as the person who was chosen through the primary process and as our president.\u201d Thinking like that resonates down-ballot as well. \u201cI think Democratic frontliners know better than anybody else the power of stability. When there is chaos, they\u2019re the ones who suffer the consequences,\u201d an aide to one\u00a0Democrat\u00a0in a frontline district told CNN. \u201cFrontliners are like the stock market.\u201d Democratic politicians and senior aides across national politics fear that unleashing an open process at the convention would be a mess, prolonging the party\u2019s drama and cratering support from the powerful Congressional Black Caucus, a force for mobilizing grassroots support and driving up enthusiasm in November. Even some Democratic members up for reelection in swing districts also see little upside in the party engaging in a weekslong sojourn to battle test a new face of the party and that assumes that anyone would even want to go up against Harris, risking their own political future if they were to be unsuccessful now. \u201cThe internal fight is killing us. There is no world in which you can push Kamala to the side,\u201d one Democratic member told CNN on the condition of anonymity to discuss the difficult political moment Democrats find themselves in. Weaknesses haven\u2019t been forgotten People who have long\u00a0disliked\u00a0Harris haven\u2019t suddenly changed their minds.\u00a0Amnesia hasn\u2019t suddenly set in about her past weaknesses or problems. That\u2019s been part of the calculations Biden is making himself as he deliberates what to do. Texas Rep. Vicente Gonzalez, who is running for reelection in a tough race, told CNN he was surprised by how quickly the conversation had moved from people saying just a few months ago that Harris would be a drag on the ticket and Biden might consider replacing her. \u201cI just don\u2019t understand how we go from that to the idea that she should be leading the ticket,\u201d Gonzalez said. \u201cI have nothing against her, but the facts are just the facts. Not everything changed, right? How did we go from that to this? I mean, nowhere else in the world but this town, right?\u201d Republican operatives\u00a0tell CNN they are\u00a0salivating \u2013 not just at going back through the old attacks and the videos of her word-salad answers\u00a0but asking her over and over\u00a0about what she knew and when she knew it about Biden\u2019s health and effects of aging. They\u2019ll push for Biden to resign, to create more chaos and take her off the trail more. They\u2019ll also question not just the legitimacy of her coming through whatever rushed process is chosen, but of whether she can legally be replaced on the ballot. House Speaker Mike Johnson\u2019s comment in an interview this week that \u201cthere\u2019s some preliminary research being done\u201d is making the rounds, with real concerns that\u00a0ballot access that could be affected if Democrats move ahead with a completely new candidate that comes out of a brokered convention. And already in 2020 when Biden put Harris on the ticket, some went beyond just deliberately mispronouncing her first name, but threatening lawsuits about whether she is constitutionally eligible to serve, hooking the\u00a0flawed\u00a0argument on that neither of her parents were born in America. They\u2019re not the only ones. \u201cIf you think that\u2019s going to be an easy transition, I\u2019m here to tell you that a huge amount of the donor class, a huge amount of the elites, a huge amount of these folks in these rooms that I see that are pushing for Joe Biden to not be the nominee also are not interested in seeing the vice president be the nominee,\u201d New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said on an Instagram live chat on Thursday evening. Some progressives have said behind the scenes, meanwhile, that they trust Biden to be more aligned with their agenda than they do Harris \u2013 and that is part of why so many have stuck with him. \u2018She\u2019s auditioning for the presidency right now\u2019 To others, the political conversation is lagging behind the way this is landing to many outside Washington and the people who obsess over internal polls and donor data. \u201cTo some degree she\u2019s auditioning for the presidency right now,\u201d said Ashley Etienne, her former communications director and a longtime Hill aide still in touch with many current members. \u201cShe\u2019s well positioned to shore up confidence about Joe Biden while assuring people that she\u2019s ready. She needs to do that in more profound ways. The campaign needs to create opportunities for her to do that.\u201d To Rep. Jared Golden, a Maine Democrat who has said he doesn\u2019t think he could vote for the president, thinking of a move toward Harris is just logical. \u201cI think that many Americans are thinking that there\u2019s a very high likelihood that if the Biden-Harris ticket wins, that Kamala will finish that second term, Golden said. \u201cSo, it might beg the question: Why not just settle that matter in this election?\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/20/politics/democratic-consensus-harris-should-biden-step-aside/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/21/2024", "section": "us"}}
