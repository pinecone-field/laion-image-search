{"id": "2024_06_22_us_roe-v-wade-overturned-2-years", "text": "Two years ago, the US Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, ending the constitutional right to an abortion and setting off a fierce fight for reproductive rights at the state level. Abortion has emerged as a key issue in the 2024 election, and as access narrows\u00a0in many states, reproductive freedom advocates are working to get measures preserving reproductive rights on the November ballot to let voters weigh in. Abortion rates reach a decade-long high in the US Two years after Roe v. Wade was overturned,\u00a014 states have total or near-total bans\u00a0on abortion, including Alabama, Texas, Idaho and Tennessee. Despite\u00a0an increase in\u00a0restrictive policies,\u00a0the number and rate of\u00a0abortions\u00a0in 2023 hit their highest point in over a decade, according to\u00a0a report from\u00a0the\u00a0Guttmacher Institute, a\u00a0research and policy non-profit that advocates for sexual and reproductive health rights. The organization estimates\u00a0there were more than 1 million abortions in the\u00a0formal\u00a0US\u00a0healthcare system\u00a0last year, a\u00a011% increase from 2020. States without\u00a0total\u00a0abortion bans saw a\u00a026% increase from 2020, according to the report. The loss of\u00a0abortion\u00a0access in states with bans, the authors noted, was countered by\u00a0\u201cefforts on the part of clinics, abortion funds and logistical support organizations to help people\u2026access care.\u201d Nearly two-thirds of all abortions in 2023, about 642,700, were medication abortions \u2013 not including self-managed medication abortions outside of the healthcare setting, the report says. The authors note a steady increase since 2001, when medication abortions\u00a0accounted for less than 10% of all procedures. Over the years, the US Food and Drug Administration relaxed some of the restrictions for use of the abortion pill, and access to the medication increased. In 2016, the agency deemed the abortion pill safe to use up to 10 weeks into pregnancy, rather than seven, and expanded the pool of providers who could prescribe it. After the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, the FDA allowed for the pill to be dispensed by certified pharmacies and through the mail, rather than just in healthcare settings. States implement increasingly restrictive abortion policies Abortion policies have changed rapidly\u00a0in many\u00a0states since the Supreme Court\u2019s decision\u00a0to overturn Roe. Four states, California, Michigan, Vermont and Ohio, have since\u00a0enshrined rights to reproductive freedom in their constitutions, while lawmakers in\u00a0New York\u00a0and other states implemented policies to protect abortion patients and providers. More than a dozen states passed\u00a0abortion \u201ctrigger\u00a0laws\u201d ahead of\u00a0the court\u2019s decision,\u00a0meant to take effect almost immediately in the event that Roe was overturned,\u00a0and at least seven\u00a0states without trigger laws have followed suit with restrictive reproductive health policies that critics say put patients in danger and leave providers at risk of civil and criminal liability. Patients and providers have struggled to navigate a patchwork of sometimes hastily implemented abortion policies that include\u00a0mandatory waiting periods\u00a0to obtain an abortion in states\u00a0including\u00a0Arizona and Georgia, limits on\u00a0Medicaid coverage\u00a0for abortion, in states including South Dakota, and vague language around\u00a0medical emergency exceptions\u00a0to abortion bans in states including Texas. Lower courts have been asked to take abortion issues up in multiple legal challenges across states. These policies have already had real-world\u00a0effects. For example,\u00a0one woman in Texas\u00a0sued the state to access an abortion for a pregnancy that was threatening her future fertility. Another Texas woman was\u00a0unlawfully charged\u00a0with murder for\u00a0using abortion medication to self-induce an abortion and spent two nights in jail before the charges were dropped.\u00a0Providers say\u00a0that patients in states with abortion bans have been forced to carry pregnancies against their will, leading to compromised fertility and other life-threatening consequences. Last month, Florida replaced its 15-week abortion ban with a\u00a0six-week ban, which falls before many women know they\u2019re pregnant. The move was a major blow to reproductive access in the South, where Florida was a critical access point for people seeking abortions. Providers\u00a0and advocates\u00a0say the restrictive policies have created a\u00a0reproductive care\u00a0\u201cdesert\u201d in the region. Patients cross state lines to access reproductive care More than 171,000 patients travelled for an abortion in 2023, according to the Guttmacher Institute. Many people who traveled to obtain abortions before Roe was overturned were going to states that now have total abortion bans, meaning people are now traveling farther distances \u2013 sometimes crossing multiple state lines \u2013 to access care, the\u00a0organization noted recently. In just the first half of 2023,\u00a0nearly 1 in 5 people\u00a0who had an abortion \u00ad\u2013\u00a0more than 92,000 people \u2013 traveled across state lines for abortion care, according to a\u00a0December\u00a02023\u00a0analysis\u00a0from the\u00a0institute. As the abortion care landscape becomes more and more restrictive, Alexandra Mandado, president of Planned Parenthood in South, East and North Florida,\u00a0says that remaining abortion clinics\u00a0will struggle to absorb the increase in out-of-state patients. Supreme Court takes up other high profile reproductive rights cases The Supreme Court recently\u00a0rejected a challenge\u00a0to access\u00a0to the abortion pill, mifepristone, maintaining widespread access to medication abortion in a ruling that will allow for continued mailing of the pills\u00a0to patients without an in-person doctor\u2019s visit. Experts say abortion pill access could face additional legal challenges in the future. The court is considering another case this summer dealing with\u00a0medical emergency exceptions\u00a0to abortion bans. In the case, the Biden administration sued the state of Idaho,\u00a0where exemptions to its abortion ban are limited to life-threatening situations,\u00a0arguing that federal law requires hospitals receiving Medicare funding to provide stabilizing care, including abortions, when a pregnant person\u2019s health is\u00a0in danger. Access to other reproductive care services is challenged In February,\u00a0the\u00a0Alabama Supreme Court\u00a0ruled that frozen embryos are considered human beings and those who destroy them can be held liable for wrongful death, causing fertility clinics throughout the state to pause in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatments out of fear of legal prosecution. As families across the state lost access to IVF treatments, lawmakers scrambled to meet the widespread demand for a fix. In March,\u00a0the state passed a law\u00a0aimed at protecting IVF patients and providers from the legal liability imposed on them by the state court\u2019s ruling. While some services resumed,\u00a0at least one\u00a0of the state\u2019s limited pool of IVF providers says it will halt services altogether\u00a0by the end of the year, citing litigation concerns. Experts have\u00a0expressed concern\u00a0that other reproductive care services, like contraception, are also on the line amid a swell of misinformation that some say is sown intentionally to create panic,\u00a0like lawmakers conflating emergency contraception\u00a0with abortion, for example. Advocates work to get abortion on state ballots in November Most abortion policies implemented after the Supreme Court overturned Roe were directly triggered by that decision or handed down by lawmakers or state courts. In an effort to\u00a0restore the issue of reproductive health access, organizers across the country have been working to get measures to enshrine reproductive health rights in state constitutions\u00a0on ballots in November. Colorado, Florida, Maryland and South Dakota have secured the measures on their state ballots, with New York and Nevada likely to follow suit. Organizers in at least seven other states are working to do the same. In addition to making it more difficult to challenge access to abortion services, organizers hope that the measures will allow voters to\u00a0send a message to politicians about what they want.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/22/us/roe-v-wade-overturned-2-years/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/24/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_24_politics_haley-voters-biden-trump-aotm-podcast", "text": "My mother used to tell me you only learn when you listen. I think it was her polite way of getting me to shut up, but it\u2019s good advice even if her ultimate goal was a little quiet in the King family kitchen. Listening is a lost art in our politics. And, too often, in our political coverage. Everyday Americans are ignored, or given a quote or soundbite here and there, while most of the attention goes to the ever louder partisan bombast. Don\u2019t get me wrong \u2013 we need to cover what the politicians say. And what their ads say. And fact check it all. But our All Over the Map project is an attempt to shift the balance a bit. To listen. To learn. We have been at it 10 months now, and we are learning a ton from voters who are literally all over the map \u2013 in every way. Now, with a presidential debate looming on Thursday and a consequential election heading into the final stretch, we invite you to listen with us \u2013 in a way that goes beyond what we can do on television or in written dispatches. All Over the Map, in podcast form, comes to CNN Audio today, so we can share our voters\u2019 stories in more detail. You can hear people wrestle with their choices and explain the life experiences shaping their politics. A CNN series that began in Iowa and New Hampshire as the primary season took off now includes voters in South Carolina, Virginia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Georgia, Nevada and Arizona. Mom was right. You learn when you listen. My biggest lesson so far: Yes, there are huge differences in polarized America. But voters are not only willing but eager to have the tough conversations many politicians avoid. Most are willing to discuss the compromises politicians refuse to make. Economic anxiety is easy to find, as are doubts about the candidates. In our first episode, Nikki Haley voters share their thoughts, and their frustrations, with their two choices for president. There are enough supporters of the former South Carolina governor, who ended her GOP primary bid in March, to swing the election \u2013 so we wanted to visit a few in battleground Pennsylvania ahead of the first Biden-Trump debate. You will meet Linda Rooney and Michael Pesce and you will hear the torment of self-identified Reagan Republicans who want their party back from Trump but run afoul of their GOP DNA when they ponder voting to reelect a Democratic president. It is fascinating to listen to voters who start in the same place but take different turns when staring at the Trump-Biden crossroads. Rooney, from Media, Pennsylvania, in the Philadelphia suburbs, gives voice to a theme we hear a ton in our travels. She voted for Trump in 2016 and Biden in 2020. \u201cI\u2019m sad that we only have these two choices honestly,\u201d Rooney told us. \u201cI\u2019m tired of celebrities sort of being in politics. I don\u2019t like Trump, but I have to say we were, for us, personally, we were better off when he was president. I don\u2019t like how he\u2019s so unreliable in some ways. You never know what he\u2019s going to do next. I just want a normal person. Like, I just want someone normal. I don\u2019t want a celebrity, and I don\u2019t have confidence in Biden. So, I feel like I don\u2019t have a choice.\u201d But she promised to vote, and it is not lost on her that the Pennsylvania winner tends to be the national winner. Pesce is both part of the generation that changed American politics 40 years ago and the suburban shift that is reshaping our politics today. He lives in Doylestown, in competitive Bucks County, and, like Rooney, was a Trump voter in 2016 and a Biden voter in 2020. \u201cI became a Republican when I turned 18 because of Ronald Reagan,\u201d said Pesce, a Coast Guard veteran who works in a meat processing plant. \u201cI\u2019m a Reagan Republican. I like that version of conservatism. I like that version of America. His version of \u2018America First.\u2019 That we are the leaders of the free world. We are the leaders of the world military. This is what we stand for. And I\u2019m like, yeah, that\u2019s what I want to be.\u201d Down the road, we visit one of America\u2019s newest presidential battlegrounds and meet two voters whose 2024 choices \u2013 and conversations \u2013 are shaped by Biden\u2019s map-changing 2020 win in Georgia. And we explore the cracks in the Biden coalition that make his reelection math, and map, so challenging. A Palestinian American law school student in Dearborn, Michigan, gives voice to the anger young voters and Arab American voters feel over Biden\u2019s handling of Israel\u2019s war in Gaza. A Black entrepreneur in Milwaukee shares his take on the economic decline in neighborhoods that once offered a path to the middle class through factory jobs. I hope you will consider joining our journey. A few minutes into any voter conversation, you might feel no connection to someone who lives far away from you and perhaps has a very different life experience or political views. My bet, though, is by the end, something will connect you or stir your own thoughts about an issue or the candidates. We are just a bit over four months to Election Day now, and we know that the race is close, that the third-party candidates make the state-by-state math complicated and that voters who don\u2019t much like either major-party candidate will decide who wins. Maybe you fit in this group. Maybe you are certain about your choice and can\u2019t understand that frustration. I hope you can share a little time with us, and learn by listening.

Two other crew members have also been cleared to return overseas, a spokesperson for the ship\u2019s manager said. The news came as the Dali cargo vessel started its journey Monday from Baltimore\u2019s Seagirt Marine Terminal to Norfolk, Virginia, to undergo repairs, said Darrell Wilson, spokesperson for ship manager Synergy Marine. Four crew members stayed on the ship to assist a relief crew during the Dali\u2019s voyage to Norfolk, Wilson said. After the journey is complete, they will join the seven remaining crew members, who must stay in the US indefinitely. The Dali\u2019s crew members, including 20 from India and one from Sri Lanka, had been stuck on the Dali since March 26. During the frigid predawn hours, the 984-foot ship lost power, veered off course and destroyed the Francis Scott Key Bridge,\u00a0killing six construction workers.

{"id": "2024_06_22_us_massachusetts-911-fire-alarm-telegraph", "text": "When the Massachusetts 911 system for emergency calls stopped working on Tuesday afternoon, Boston Police Commissioner Michael Cox noted the city already had a backup solution in place. Use those little-noticed fire alarm red boxes, he said. They rely on that old yet reliable technology: The telegraph. \u201cIf you\u2019re having any issues, medical-related or EMS or fire-related, you can go and pull your local call box,\u201d Cox said in a news conference. \u201cThat\u2019s the red light boxes that the Fire Department has on local streets and corners, to also get medical attention that way.\u201d The Boston Fire Department offered similar advice in a post on X. \u201cIf you have an emergency and need assistance pull your nearest Fire Box,\u201d the department said along with a photo of the device. Yes, the humble fire alarm box remains an emergency option, available for any passersby to use in Boston and in several other major American cities. Attached to street poles and on the sides of buildings, the boxes \u2013 often in faded red paint \u2013 use electronic telegraph technology to relay an emergency alert to Fire Department headquarters. Simply open up the protective lid and pull down the hook. Today, there are still about 1,500 fire alarm boxes around Boston, according to Michael Gerry of the Boston Fire Historical Society. \u201cNow, most people don\u2019t know what they are,\u201d he told CNN in a phone call. \u201cNobody uses them anymore because everyone has a cell phone.\u201d Still, while rarely used, they continue to operate on their own telegraph and power system around the Hub, making for an excellent backup system when power is out or 911 is down. First in the nation system The alarm boxes have a notable history in Boston. Samuel Morse invented the electric telegraph in the 1830s and 40s, allowing users to instantly communicate across long distances, and in the years afterward, Boston residents William Channing and Moses Farmer pushed to use the technology to create a citywide electric fire alarm system. On April 28, 1852, the apparatus was placed into service, making Boston the first city to use such a municipal system. The first alarm was sent and received the next day at 8:25 p.m. to alert a small fire in a building at the corner of Charleston and Causeway streets, according to the Boston Fire Department. The system represented a major improvement over the prior systems of ringing bells or yelling for help, and in 2004 it was commemorated with a plaque in downtown Boston near the old city hall. \u201cInvented by William Channing and Moses Farmer, this system was highly successful in reducing property loss and deaths due to fire and was subsequently adopted throughout the United States and Canada,\u201d the plaque reads. The alarm boxes were installed at different locations around the city, each with its own unique identifying number, according to the Boston Fire Historical Society. When a person pulls on the hook of a fire alarm box, the box then sends a telegraph to the Fire Alarm Office with its number. So, for example, if someone uses Box 2621, then the office would receive the number 2, then 6, then 2, then 1, and know that there is an emergency near that box\u2019s established location. The alarm boxes have changed appearance and usefulness over the interceding 172 years. Yet they remain useful, particularly when more sophisticated systems go down, and systems remain active in cities like New York and San Francisco. \u201cThe higher you get in technology, the more susceptible you are to computer code or something else going wrong,\u201d Gerry told CNN. \u201cWhereas the fire alarm boxes are old technology \u2026 but are not reliant on high-technology information to work.\u201d In December 2018, amid another 911 outage, a Boston resident used an alarm box to report a fire on Endicott Street in the North End, according to CNN affiliate WBZ. \u201cI give credit to the resident for knowing to pull that box,\u201d firefighter Marc Sanders told the affiliate. It was a fortuitous location. That resident used Box 1212 \u2013 the same location as the first ever fire alarm in 1852, according to Gerry. Just last week, firefighters put out a fire at a well-known inn on Cape Cod after a clerk pulled the fire alarm box and called 911, according to The Boston Globe. Yet there is a reason 911 dispatch centers have largely made the old technology obsolete. The fire alarm boxes only allow one-way communication, and there\u2019s no method to communicate any further messages or information. The Fire Department has no way of knowing what they will find when they arrive, whether it be a fire, a medical emergency, a need for law enforcement \u2013 or just a false alarm. Plus, almost everyone nowadays has a cell phone to call 911. On Tuesday, their return to relevance was short-lived. The 911 system came back online after about two hours, again relegating the fire alarm boxes to secondary importance. One person actually pulled a fire box during that period, but investigators did not find anything, according to Boston Fire Department public information officer Brian Alkins. There were no reports of emergencies impacted by the outage, which a preliminary investigation revealed was caused by a computer firewall and not due to a cyberattack or hack. But the exact reason the firewall \u201cstopped calls from reaching dispatch centers remains under review,\u201d the state\u2019s office of public safety and security said\u00a0in a statement on X on Wednesday. Massachusetts\u2019 public safety answering system received an average of 8,800 calls per day in 2023, according to the statement. While many cities have removed the fire alarm boxes, the outage showed why Boston has kept them functioning. \u201cI guess we always will, because of instances just like (Tuesday),\u201d Gerry said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/22/us/massachusetts-911-fire-alarm-telegraph/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/24/2024", "section": "us"}}

The couple went for a swim Thursday afternoon with two of their teens when they got into trouble while in the water, authorities said. The sheriff\u2019s office identified 51-year-old Brian Warter and his partner 48-year-old Erica Wishard as the victims. They were traveling with three children each and were part of a family of eight vacationing in Florida, the sheriff\u2019s office told CNN affiliate WPEC. \u201cThey stepped right into a riptide according to our witnesses and were immediately taken over by the power of the ocean,\u201d Chief Deputy John Budensiek told CNN affiliate WPBF. The teens were able to break free of the current and attempted to help the adults, but when it became too dangerous they were forced to swim ashore, the sheriff\u2019s office said in a release. \u201cThey are teenagers. They\u2019re not even in their 20s yet. They\u2019ve been through two dramatic scenarios,\u201d Budensiek told WPEC. Despite efforts by the Martin County Ocean Rescue, paramedics and doctors at Cleveland Clinic Martin North Hospital, the couple could not be saved. The children were under the watch of the Martin County Sheriff\u2019s Crisis Intervention Team as they waited for other family members to arrive in Florida. \u201cThey\u2019re on the beach and watched them (the parents) drown. They watched the resuscitation efforts on the beach. They were at the hospital watching some resuscitation efforts, so they\u2019re extremely traumatized,\u201d Budensiek added, according to WPEC.

{"id": "2024_06_21_us_rust-baldwin-motion-dismiss-denied-friday", "text": "A New Mexico judge denied a motion Friday from Alec Baldwin\u2019s attorneys asking the court to dismiss the actor\u2019s involuntary manslaughter indictment in a shooting on the set of the film \u201cRust,\u201d in which cinematographer\u00a0Halyna Hutchins died. A separate motion to dismiss from Baldwin\u2019s team will be considered at a hearing on June 24. The case is slated to go to trial in July in Santa Fe. In the first motion to dismiss, an attorney for Baldwin, John Bash, argued the shooting death of Hutchins on set in October 2021 was an accident and Baldwin is \u201cnot criminally liable.\u201d Prosecutor Kari Morrissey countered Baldwin is experienced in the movie business. \u201cMr. Baldwin knew he had a real gun in his hand. Mr. Baldwin specifically asked for the biggest gun that was available. Mr. Baldwin knew and understood that dummy rounds look identical to live ammunition,\u201d Morrissey said. Furthermore, she argued, Baldwin was aware armorer Hannah Gutierrez Reed \u201cwasn\u2019t following the rules\u201d when she was doing gun safety checks on the set of \u201cRust.\u201d Gutierrez Reed was convicted in March of involuntary manslaughter and sentenced to 18 months in prison. She is appealing the conviction. In the second motion to dismiss the case, Baldwin\u2019s team argued the gun used in the shooting was destroyed during forensic testing by the FBI, making it impossible for the defense to attempt to recreate the testing. The judge is set to rule on the motion following a hearing scheduled for next Monday. Judge Mary Marlowe Sommer also denied a motion from the prosecution to provide \u201cuse immunity\u201d for Guiterrez Reed. Use immunity protects a witness from the use of their own testimony against them. Trial set for July Special prosecutors have signaled they intend to portray Baldwin as repeatedly flouting safety protocols on the movie set in the days before the fatal shooting, according to\u00a0a new court filing. In a notice to Baldwin\u2019s attorneys on evidence they intend to present in court next month, prosecutors outlined repeated instances in which Baldwin allegedly acted dangerously between October 12 and October 21, 2021, and a key focus will be the defendant\u2019s \u201creckless behavior.\u201d Prosecutors in the filing argue the evidence \u201cis relevant because it is part of the crime of involuntary manslaughter as it shows defendant\u2019s recklessness or criminal negligence on October 21, 2021, when he shot and killed Halyna Hutchins.\u201d Baldwin has pleaded not guilty to a felony charge of involuntary manslaughter in connection to Hutchins\u2019 death. Luke Nikas, an attorney for Baldwin, had no comment Wednesday about the prosecution document, but referred CNN to the defense\u2019s most recent filing asking the court again to dismiss the indictment and accusing the prosecution of selected disclosure of evidence. In\u00a0a statement\u00a0to CNN\u00a0last month\u00a0following a judge\u2019s refusal to dismiss the charge, Baldwin\u2019s legal team said, \u201cWe look forward to our day in court.\u201d Prosecutors cited video evidence from the set obtained during the state\u2019s criminal investigation, laying out examples of Baldwin\u2019s alleged mishandling of the replica revolver he used\u00a0during\u00a0the movie\u2019s production, according to the court document filed Monday and obtained by CNN. Baldwin, prosecutors alleged, \u201cused his gun as a pointer directing crew members,\u201d \u201cdischarged the revolver after the filming was over and \u2018cut\u2019 was called,\u201d \u201cengaged in horseplay with the revolver\u00a0while making videos,\u201d pointed the gun and fired a blank round at a crew member \u201cwhile using that crew member as a line of site as his perceived target\u201d and \u201cshot several scenes wherein he placed his finger on the trigger of the revolver where the scene did not require any shooting of the firearm.\u201d Baldwin\u00a0previously told CNN\u00a0he did not pull the trigger on the weapon during the deadly incident. \u201cI never took a gun and pointed\u00a0at somebody and clicked the thing,\u201d Baldwin said at the time. The special prosecution team also alleged Baldwin was \u201cinattentive during\u00a0the\u00a0firearms training\u201d conducted by on-set armorer Gutierrez Reed, claiming the actor was texting and video conferencing with family members rather than focusing on the safety briefing. In addition to holding the gun when it fired the fatal round, Santa Fe\u00a0County\u2019s\u00a0district attorney\u00a0previously told\u00a0CNN Baldwin\u2019s\u00a0role as a producer for the film also opens him up to potential liability for the alleged culture\u00a0of unsafe practices on the\u00a0\u201cRust\u201d set. In the filing, special prosecutors repeatedly insisted Baldwin exercised\u00a0complete control over the set and crew\u00a0during instances where alleged unsafe practices were identified on video. Hutchins\u00a0was killed and director Joel Souza injured when a gun held by Baldwin fired a live round during a scene rehearsal on the set of the western.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/21/us/rust-baldwin-motion-dismiss-denied-friday/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/24/2024", "section": "us"}}

The memorial will honor the victims of the mass shooting that left 11 worshippers dead and six others wounded. Most of the synagogue was demolished starting earlier this year, according to CNN affiliate KDKA. \u201cAlmost six years ago, a white supremacist committed the deadliest attack on American Jews in our nation\u2019s history right here,\u201d said second gentleman Doug Emhoff at Sunday\u2019s groundbreaking ceremony. \u201cIt was (an) unspeakable act of terror, of violence, barbarism, fueled by antisemitic hate,\u201d Emhoff said. On October 27, 2018, gunman Robert Bowers burst into the Tree of Life synagogue armed with multiple firearms and shot congregants with an AR-15-style rifle. Four responding police officers were among those injured. Those killed were David and Cecil Rosenthal, 54 and 59; Richard Gottfried, 65; Dr. Jerry Rabinowitz, 66; Irving Younger, 69; Daniel Stein, 71; Joyce Fienberg, 75; Bernice and Sylvan Simon, 84 and 86; Melvin Wax, 87; and Rose Mallinger, 97. Bowers was sentenced to death last August on 22 capital counts, 37 life sentences and 20 years each on four additional counts, CNN previously reported. Pennsylvania Gov.

Shapiro said: \u201cLet this be a place where individuals find strength to bolster the collective and to root out evil.\u201d CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer was also among the speakers at the ceremony in Pittsburgh. \u201cThe new Tree of Life will not only be a tribute to those we lost and a hope for the Pittsburgh Jewish community for generations to come, it will also be a place to teach and share profoundly important lessons,\u201d Blitzer said.

{"id": "2024_06_24_us_los-angeles-synagogue-palestinian-israeli-protest-violence", "text": "A pro-Palestinian protest held outside a Los Angeles synagogue on Sunday devolved into chaotic street violence with pro-Israel counter-protesters in an incident that several officials criticized as antisemitic. The Los Angeles Police Department said it responded to two protests Sunday in the predominantly Jewish neighborhood of Pico Robertson, just south of Beverly Hills. Videos taken at the scene show police pushing pro-Palestinian protesters away from the entrance of the Adas Torah temple, an Orthodox synagogue. Chants of \u201cFree, free Palestine - from the river to the sea,\u201d and \u201clong live intifada,\u201d could be heard from among the pro-Palestinian protesters.\u00a0Participants blocked traffic, and video from the scene shows multiple altercations broke out in the middle of the street and on sidewalks. Protests around the Israel-Gaza war have become common across the US since October, but local and state officials sharply criticized Sunday\u2019s event for its violence and for taking place at a Jewish institution. \u201c(Sunday\u2019s) violence in the Pico-Robertson neighborhood today was abhorrent, and blocking access to a place of worship is unacceptable,\u201d Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said in a statement. \u201cI\u2019ve called on LAPD to provide additional patrols in the Pico-Robertson community as well as outside of houses of worship throughout the city. I\u2019ll be meeting with Chief (Dominic) Choi tomorrow to further discuss the safety of Angelenos.\u201d \u201cI want to be clear that Los Angeles will not be a harbor for antisemitism and violence. Those responsible for either will be found and held accountable,\u201d she added. \u201cThe violent clashes outside the Adas Torah synagogue in Los Angeles are appalling,\u201d California Gov. Gavin Newsom said on X. \u201cThere is no excuse for targeting a house of worship. Such antisemitic hatred has no place in California.\u201d \u201cTargeting a synagogue, or targeting the members of a synagogue, is anti-Semitic,\u201d US Rep. Ted Lieu of California said on X. \u201cI strongly condemn the Pro-Palestinian demonstrators who engaged in anti-Semitism by targeting Adas Torah Synagogue and/or its congregants. Anyone who engaged in violence should be prosecuted.\u201d Both Jewish and Muslim advocacy groups say the war has led to skyrocketing hate crimes and bias incidents. The Anti-Defamation League reports that antisemitic incidents were up 140% in 2023 compared to the prior year. And the Council on American-Islamic Relations said last year marked the highest number of anti-Muslim bias reports it has received in nearly three decades. It\u2019s unclear how the chaos Sunday escalated, but videos shared on social media shows both groups taunting, shoving and grabbing each other outside the synagogue. The groups of demonstrators eventually began flowing down nearby streets, where more scuffles broke out, the videos show. In one video,\u00a0two\u00a0men appear to be wrestling on the ground as\u00a0others\u00a0kick\u00a0at them. Later, one of the men\u00a0\u2013\u00a0holding\u00a0an\u00a0Israeli\u00a0flag \u2013\u00a0appears\u00a0to have a bloodied face and mouth. Additional video showed an egg thrown at a pro-Palestinian activist and a man wearing a keffiyeh, a traditional Palestinian scarf, chased and punched on the ground by a man wearing a Jewish yarmulke or kippah. During many of the altercations, bystanders worked to pull and hold people apart. Los Angeles police began monitoring the situation around 10:30 a.m., Officer Tony Im told CNN. The crowd was ordered to disperse at some point, Im said, though no exact time was provided. He added that the situation appeared \u201cpretty calm\u201d hours later, but that police were closely monitoring the area. Officers arrested a person with a spiked flag, the police department told CNN. They were issued a citation for possessing a prohibited item during a protest and released from custody. \u2018It\u2019s not meant to be intimidating\u2019 One man wearing a red keffiyeh over his face spoke to CNN affiliate KCAL as a counter-protester badgered him to \u201cshow your face.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not meant to be intimidating. Yeah, disruptive, for sure,\u201d the keffiyeh-wearing man said. \u201cThis is intimidating,\u201d he added, pointing at the counter-protester. \u201cWe didn\u2019t get in anyone\u2019s faces.\u201d However, local resident Josh Golcheh disagreed. \u201cThey\u2019ve come to our home. They come and are attacking us. They bear-sprayed my friend who\u2019s standing right over here,\u201d he told KCAL. He said people he knew had been attacked. \u201cIt\u2019s just terrible.\u201d Rabbi Hertzel Illulian of the nearby JEM Community Center in Beverly Hills told KCAL violence \u201cdoesn\u2019t belong here\u201d and lamented what he saw as a double standard. \u201cI don\u2019t think the Jewish people would go in front of a mosque or the Christian people would go in front of a mosque to do such a thing,\u201d he said. \u201cNobody would accept this, but here, when it comes to Jews and Israel, everything is kosher, everything is okay.\u201d In a statement to CNN, the Jewish Federation Los Angeles said they are working to ensure their community is safe. \u201cOur Community Security Initiative (CSI) are monitoring the situation and working with our local law enforcement partners to make sure our community are kept safe. We will continue to monitor the situation and provide further updates as needed,\u201d the statement read.

{"id": "2024_06_22_us_fordyce-arkansas-grocery-store-shooting-saturday", "text": "Families were shopping at a local grocery store in a small Arkansas town on Friday when the sound of gunfire reverberated through the store, sending them running for cover or huddling in a freezer. Katrina Doherty \u2013 who had been shopping for dinner with her 18-year-old daughter and 4-year-old son \u2013 said she first thought she heard the sound of something falling but then saw glass shatter and someone drop to the ground. That\u2019s when she knew shots were being fired. Outside, David Rodriguez was pulling into a gas station when he heard \u201cpops\u201d that he initially thought were fireworks. He then noticed the grocery store\u2019s front windows were broken \u2013 as if they had been \u201cshot open\u201d by gunfire, Rodriguez said. Panicked shoppers then started running away as gunshots were fired rapidly, Rodriguez said. A man had opened fire at the Mad Butcher in Fordyce, killing four people and wounding\u00a0nine\u00a0others.\u00a0Those killed ranged in age from 23 to 81 years old and include one person who police later announced died on Saturday evening. Law enforcement responded to the shooting around 11:30 a.m. and exchanged gunfire with the \u201clone suspect,\u201d according to Arkansas State Police. Cellphone video captured a man in the parking lot aiming a long gun and firing in multiple directions. Not finding an escape route, Doherty and others in the store hurriedly hid in a freezer. Doherty\u2019s daughter and son, who were in a different aisle, reunited with their mother in the back of the store and followed two store workers into the freezer. The 39-year-old mother said she heard about nine or ten rounds before making it into the icy shelter. \u201cWe ran in there really fast. We still heard gunshots keep going off,\u201d Doherty said. \u201cIt was like slow motion. My daughter was like \u2018Mama, pinch me, this can\u2019t be real.\u2019 And I was like, \u2019Baby, it\u2019s real.\u2019\u201d From outside, Rodriguez heard sirens and watched as ambulances and police arrived at the scene. Doherty couldn\u2019t hear what was happening outside, and when they tried to call 9-1-1, there was no service. The group stayed inside, enduring the freezing cold in \u201cpanic mode,\u201d with some praying and others crying, she recalled. Her son started to cry, \u201cbut we finally got him calmed down because I didn\u2019t want the shooter to hear.\u201d \u201cWe were just sitting there and praying. I was in panic mode. My son about froze to death. We tried to get him quiet, but he was saying he wanted his daddy. It felt like we were in there forever,\u201d Doherty said. \u201cWe were in there maybe 15 minutes. I was asking the Lord to protect over everybody. I was just praying. The other lady, she was praying. She was crying.\u201d At one point, one of the workers opened the freezer door, and saw someone dead right outside of it, Doherty said. The door remained shut until one of the store workers heard police outside, and they were then escorted out of the store, Doherty said. Once she was out of the store, Doherty reunited with her 15-year-old twin daughters who were waiting outside in the car during the shooting and ducked down when they heard the gunshots. Shirley Kay Taylor, 62, was one of the four dead, her daughter Angela Atchley told CNN and police confirmed on Saturday. Atchley says her mother, who loved her family and kids, \u201cwas the hardest working woman I know\u201d and a \u201cgreat person.\u201d \u201cWe are completely lost,\u201d Atchley said. Additional civilians killed in the shooting were identified by police as: 23-year-old Callie Weems, 50-year-old Roy Sturgis and 81-year-old Ellen Shrum. A fourth victim died Saturday evening following three previous deaths that were initially counted by police. The country has seen a spate of shootings in the past few weeks, with 21 mass shootings recorded by\u00a0the Gun Violence Archive\u00a0since last Friday. Shootings permeated a Michigan splash pad, a Texas Juneteenth celebration and a Massachusetts car meetup, among other locations. They are among at least 234 mass shootings have taken place in the United States in 2024,\u00a0according to data from the Gun Violence Archive, which, like CNN, defines a mass shooting as one in which four or more people are shot, excluding the shooter. The aftermath of the shooting Matthew Gill, the meat manager at the\u00a0Mad Butcher,\u00a0told CNN a man came into the store with a shotgun and ended up in a shootout with police. Two police officers were wounded in the gunfire, with one released from the hospital Saturday evening and another having minor injuries. The suspected shooter, identified by authorities as 44-year-old Travis Eugene Posey, was also wounded and taken into custody. Posey, a resident of New Edinburg, is expected to be charged with four counts of capital murder, with additional charges pending, according to an Arkansas State Police\u00a0news release. He was taken to the Ouachita County Detention Center and is set to appear in court on Monday, according to Dallas County prosecutor Eric Marks. The injuries to the suspect are not considered life-threatening, according to Mike Hagar, the secretary of public safety and director of Arkansas State Police. He noted the \u201csituation is secured \u2026 contained. There are no active threats to the community.\u201d \u201cThe remaining civilian injuries range from non-life threatening to extremely critical,\u201d he said. Five women and two men from 20 to 65 years old were injured in the shooting. Four of them are still in the hospital, including a woman who is in critical condition. Three victims were treated and released on Friday. Posey was \u201ctreated for non-life-threatening\u00a0injuries after exchanging gunfire with law enforcement, released to ASP custody, and transported to the Ouachita County Detention Center,\u201d ASP said in the release. It is unclear if Posey has retained legal counsel at this point. Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders in a statement on\u00a0X said she had been briefed on the \u201ctragic shooting\u201d in Fordyce and is in \u201cconstant contact\u201d with state police at the scene. Fordyce, a small city in southeast Dallas County,\u00a0had a population\u00a0of just 3,396 in 2020. Fordyce City Council Member Roderick Rogers told CNN affiliate KATV that he was on the phone with someone in the store when the shooting took place. \u201cMan, it was bad,\u201d Rogers said. The council member said that he spoke with survivors of the shooting who \u201care traumatized.\u201d \u201cWe are trying to get some counseling and everything set up at the moment,\u201d he added.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/22/us/fordyce-arkansas-grocery-store-shooting-saturday/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/24/2024", "section": "us"}}

The couple were on vacation at the resort on June 11 when they decided to spend time in the hot tub, the lawsuit said. As soon as Guillen entered the tub, he was \u201cexposed to an electrical current in the water,\u201d it said. \u201cJorge immediately keeled over into the tub and was taken under the surface of the water,\u201d according to the lawsuit. \u201cWitnessing her husband immediately collapse, Lizzette sprang forward from the pool deck to try and grab Jorge\u2019s body \u2026 \u201d Zambrano attempted to rescue him, the suit states, but was also shocked.

{"id": "2024_06_24_politics_supreme-court-to-decide-whether-states-can-restrict-gender-affirming-care-for-minors", "text": "The Supreme Court on Monday agreed to hear the Biden administration\u2019s challenge to a transgender care ban in Tennessee, delving into the complicated and politically fraught issue of gender-affirming care in a substantive way for the first time. The state law, enacted last year, bans hormone therapy and puberty blockers for minors and imposes civil penalties for doctors who violate the prohibitions. It is among a growing number of state laws enacted in recent years targeting transgender care. Nearly half of US states have enacted bans on transgender care for minors, according to the Human Rights Campaign. The case will be heard this fall. \u201cThe Supreme Court was always going to have to resolve how state bans on gender-affirming medical care can be reconciled with its approach to sex-based discrimination,\u201d said Steve Vladeck, CNN Supreme Court analyst and professor at the University of Texas School of Law. \u201cToday\u2019s grant sets up this issue as one of the early blockbusters for the Court\u2019s upcoming term.\u201d Laws in Kentucky and Tennessee were challenged by the Biden administration and families of transgender minors. The Supreme Court only agreed to hear the challenge filed by the Biden administration in Tennessee. In September, the 6th US Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati reversed a district court ruling that blocked the gender-affirming care ban from being enforced. In other words, the appeals court allowed the ban to take effect. Republican lawmakers who support the ban say decisions about care should be made after an individual becomes an adult. Opponents argue that in addition to violating the civil rights of trans youth, the laws also run afoul of parents\u2019 rights to make decisions about their child\u2019s medical care. Tennessee\u2019s law says that medical providers cannot perform procedures that \u201cenable a minor to identify with, or live as, a purported identity inconsistent with the minor\u2019s sex\u201d or \u201ctreat purported discomfort or distress from a discordance between the minor\u2019s sex and asserted identity.\u201d The legal fights over similar bans have been moving through federal courts for more than a year. In April, the Supreme Court allowed Idaho officials to temporarily enforce a strict statewide ban on gender-affirming care for most minors, although it did so on a temporary basis without resolving the underlying questions posed by the case. Several groups that advocate for transgender youth called on the Supreme Court to strike down Tennessee\u2019s law. \u201cIt\u2019s simple: Everyone deserves access to the medical care that they need, and transgender and non-binary young people are no exception,\u201d said Kelley Robinson, president of the Human Rights Campaign. \u201cNo politician should be able to interfere in decisions that are best made between families and doctors, particularly when that care is necessary and best practice.\u201d Lucas Cameron-Vaughn, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union of Tennessee, criticized state lawmakers for using the bans to \u201cfuel divisions for their own political gain.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s crucial to recognize that for trans youth and their families, this isn\u2019t about politics,\u201d Cameron-Vaughn said. \u201cIt\u2019s about the fundamental freedom to access vital, life-saving healthcare.\u201d Tennessee\u2019s attorney general didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.

Lukas McClish, 34, set out for what he thought would be a three-hour hike in the Santa Cruz Mountains on June 11, according to CNN affiliate KGO. But he became lost in the mountains \u2013 partially due to the destruction of local landmarks in recent wildfires. His family officially reported him missing when he didn\u2019t show up for a Father\u2019s Day dinner on June 16, triggering search and rescue efforts, KGO reported. McClish was eventually found on Thursday thanks to a drone from the Santa Cruz Sheriff\u2019s Office, according to an X post from Cal Fire San Mateo, which said McClish was found in Big Basin Redwoods State Park \u2013 California\u2019s oldest state park and home to towering ancient coast redwood trees. \u201cThere were multiple reports of witnesses hearing someone yelling for help, but the location of that person was hard to establish,\u201d said Cal Fire.

And that was about it.\u201d He attributed his survival to drinking lots of water from creeks and waterfalls he found as he hiked through the park each day, calling for help, according to CNN affiliate KSBW. \u201cI just make sure I drank a gallon of water every day, but then after, getting close to the end of it, my body needed food and some kind of sustenance,\u201d McClish told KGO. Seeing the number of search and rescue workers who worked to find him was \u201creally humbling,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was an awesome experience.\u201d Correction: An earlier version of this story misidentified a CNN affiliate that reported on Lukas McClish\u2019s disappearance.

{"id": "2024_06_24_investing_premarket-stocks-trading", "text": "Traders could be forgiven for breaking out their champagne glasses, even though 2024 isn\u2019t halfway done yet. US stocks have leaped from all-time high to all-time high this year: the S&P 500 has surpassed its own record a staggering 31 times since January. That equates to a new all-time high about every four trading days. Investors have shrugged off elevated interest and inflation rates, a chaotic political and global environment and general economic uncertainty to give markets the best start to an election year on record. What\u2019s happening: Presidential election years are typically good for stocks. The S&P 500 alone has generated an average return of 7% during presidential election years since 1952, according to LPL Financial. If you limit that to election years in which the incumbent president is running for reelection, the average jumps to 12.2%. This year, the index has already far surpassed those average gains. The S&P 500 is 14.6% higher year-to-date \u2014 the best start to an election year on record, according to Goldman Sachs \u2014 and up nearly 31% from its October 2023 low at 4,117 points. So why is this election cycle different from all the others that have gone before? Gains are typically higher when incumbent presidents run for reelection, most likely because investors crave stability. And this election is the first since 1892 that the nominees of both major parties have occupied the White House, notes Ed Clissold, chief US strategist at Ned Davis Research. If one incumbent running for office reduces uncertainty, then two incumbents really reduces uncertainty. That could pull the typical year-end election relief rally forward, said Clissold. A reason to celebrate: Not only are stocks up, they\u2019re rarely going down. It\u2019s been 333 days since the S&P 500 recorded a decline of 2% or greater, which is the longest stretch since February 2018, wrote Goldman Sachs\u2019 Scott Rubner in a recent note to clients. His outlook for the latter half of the year remains positive \u2014 a good first half means a \u201cvery good\u201d second half, he wrote. \u201cThe impressive market rally continues, notable not only for its strength but also for its stability,\u201d wrote Nationwide\u2019s chief of investment research, Mark Hackett, in a note Friday. \u201c[T]here is no reason that the steady march higher can\u2019t persist, particularly as we approach the tailwind from election seasonality.\u201d Last week\u2019s rally was broad, assuaging some concerns from investors that recent gains have been concentrated in a few big names like tech darling Nvidia, which is up more than 155% so far this year. The equal-weighted version of the S&P 500 rose 1.12% and the small cap Russell 2000 gained 0.79% while the tech-heavy Nasdaq was flat on the week. The sustained gains are causing some analysts to raise their year-end targets for the S&P 500.  Scott Chronert, research head of US equity strategy at Citigroup, raised his year-end target to 5,600 from 5,100 last week. Analysts at Goldman Sachs, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and UBS have also revised their expectations for the broad-based index higher. Yes, but: Market volatility in an election year tends to pick up in October and there are many months left in this cycle with potential surprises to come. Thursday brings CNN\u2019s televised debate between President Joe Biden and former president Donald Trump. \u201cThere is plenty of scope for big headlines and for the candidates to gather some momentum or see it go into reverse,\u201d wrote Deutsche Bank\u2019s Jim Reid. There\u2019s also the prospect that investors get complacent and begin to take the current bull market for granted. \u201cThe longer optimism remains high, the bigger the risk that it turns into complacency and leaves the market vulnerable to the next piece of negative news,\u201d said Clissold with Ned Davis Research. \u201cAn autumn pullback fits well time wise with potential downside earnings revisions, make-or-break decision time for the Fed, and election uncertainty. The risk is that one or more of those catalysts prove to be longer lasting, turning a pullback into something more,\u201d he said. A global view: The United States isn\u2019t the only country with an upcoming election. France and the UK both face elections in the coming weeks. While opinion polls suggest the opposition centre-left Labour Party is heading for a comfortable victory in the UK on July 4, the situation in France is much more uncertain, and markets have been rattled. French President Emmanuel Macron called a snap parliamentary election after his centrist Renaissance party lost heavily to the far-right opposition in European elections. The first round of the French election will be held on June 30, with a second round on July 7. \u201cPolitical uncertainty is a near-term headwind to both sentiment (reflected through financial markets) and, now, activity,\u201d wrote Katie Nixon, chief investment officer for Northern Trust Wealth Management, of the upcoming elections. Until July, \u201cwe can anticipate volatility in European equity and debt markets.\u201d Alaska Airlines reaches tentative labor deal with flight attendants Alaska Airlines and its 7,000-member flight attendants union reached a tentative labor deal late Friday, concluding talks that lasted more than a year and a half, reports my colleague Chris Isidore. Terms of the deal have not been released, though the union called it a \u201crecord contract.\u201d The deal likely contains a significant pay raise, which has been a common demand across the airline industry and sought by unions whose members in some cases have not seen a pay increase in years. In April, the union announced to members it was seeking pay raises of between 43% to 56%, depending upon seniority, through 2026. Those pay raises would include back pay covering a period dating back a year and a half that they\u2019ve worked under the terms of the previous contract. In February, flight attendants from Alaska \u2014 along with American, United and Southwest \u2014held unprecedented coordinated\u00a0pickets\u00a0demanding new contracts. Since then, flight attendants at Southwest reached a deal that included an immediate 22.3% raise as of May 1 and $364 million in retroactive wages. Meanwhile, flight attendants at American and United are still seeking new deals. American flight attendants have asked to be released from restrictions so they can go on strike, but even if that is granted there would be months of cooling off periods before they could walk out, under the Railway Labor Act. Apple\u2019s new China problem: ChatGPT is banned there Apple is banking on its upcoming AI features to boost iPhone sales especially in China, where demand has been lagging. But there\u2019s a problem, reports my CNN colleague Samantha Murphy Kelly, ChatGPT \u2014 soon to be integrated into Siri \u2014 is banned in China. In a presentation earlier this month, Apple (AAPL) showed off its proprietary technology called Apple Intelligence to power compelling new AI\u00a0features\u00a0and announced a\u00a0partnership with OpenAI\u00a0to also use its viral ChatGPT tool in a limited capacity. (When Siri is activated and needs more assistance answering an inquiry, ChatGPT can step in.) The move signaled how Apple is trying to expedite the latest buzzy technology at a time when tech rivals, such as Microsoft, Google, Meta and Samsung, have already found their AI\u00a0footing. A deal with OpenAI could help Apple close the gap. But\u00a0China\u00a0is one of the first countries in the world to regulate the generative AI technology that powers these popular services. In August, the Cyberspace Administration of China, the country\u2019s top internet watchdog, rolled out\u00a0new guidelines\u00a0for the industry, requiring companies to seek approval before deployment. The organization\u00a0has approved\u00a0more than 100 AI models as of March, all from Chinese companies. According to\u00a0a report\u00a0from the Wall Street Journal Thursday, Apple is looking for a Chinese AI company to partner with ahead of the iPhone\u2019s expected September launch, but it hasn\u2019t reached a deal yet. Apple did not respond to a request for comment. The need to find a partner \u2014 and quickly \u2014 comes at a time when Apple\u2019s smartphone sales\u00a0tumbled\u00a0a stunning 10% in the first quarter of this year, according to market research firm IDC, due largely to iPhone sales sharply dropping in China. The company has lost momentum in China as nationalism, a rough economy and increased competition have also hurt sales.

Here\u2019s what else you need to know to\u00a0Get Up to Speed and On with Your Day. 1. Debate countdown The Biden and Trump campaigns are making their final preparations for CNN\u2019s presidential debate on Thursday. Both teams have spent weeks honing their messages on an array of issues, from the economy to foreign affairs to abortion. President Joe Biden has sought to rally potential voters around reproductive rights, especially young female blocs that are crucial to his reelection chances. His campaign is hosting dozens of events across the country today to mark two years since the Supreme Court\u2019s Dobbs decision, which overturned Roe v. Wade and the federal legal right to an abortion. Meanwhile, former President Donald Trump praised Supreme Court justices over the weekend for their role in tightening state-level restrictions on abortion and limiting access to the procedure. 2. Dagestan attacks Three days of mourning have been declared in Russia\u2019s Dagestan province after at least 19 people were killed Sunday in what appeared to be coordinated attacks against churches, synagogues and police posts. Dagestan is home to a small Christian minority and even smaller Jewish population that appeared to be among the targets. The victims include 15 police officers, an Orthodox priest and four civilians, according to local authorities. No group has yet claimed responsibility. The attacks come three months after ISIS affiliate ISIS-K said it carried out an assault at the Crocus City Hall in Moscow that claimed more than 140 lives in one of Russia\u2019s deadliest terrorist atrocities in years. Russian law enforcement agencies told state-run news agency TASS on Sunday that the gunmen in Dagestan were \u201cadherents of an international terrorist organization.\u201d 3. Middle East Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Sunday that the \u201cintense phase of the war with Hamas (in Gaza) is about to end,\u201d and the military\u2019s focus could then shift to Israel\u2019s northern border with Lebanon. On the ground, around 800,000 people have been displaced from the southern Gaza city of Rafah, where conditions have been described by the United Nations food agency as \u201capocalyptic.\u201d Netanyahu has come under increasing pressure from members of his government and Israel\u2019s allies, including the US, to minimize civilian casualties and allow for more humanitarian aid to reach the Gaza Strip. 4. Hajj heat wave More than 1,300 people died on this year\u2019s Hajj pilgrimage with numerous cases due to heat stress as temperatures exceeded 125 degrees Fahrenheit in Saudi Arabia. More than 1.8 million worshipers took part in the pilgrimage despite the dangerous heat, according to Saudi Arabian authorities. Performing Hajj is one of the five pillars of Islam, which requires every Muslim who is physically and financially able to make the journey to the holy city of Mecca at least once in their life. Many Muslims save for years and complete the pilgrimage in their old age, leaving them especially susceptible to the heat. The Saudi government said a majority of the dead were \u201cunauthorized to perform Hajj\u201d and \u201cwalked long distances under direct sunlight, without adequate shelter or comfort.\u201d 5. Starliner Boeing and NASA have once again delayed the Boeing Starliner capsule\u2019s return to Earth from the International Space Station. Officials have pushed back Starliner\u2019s departure date several times after the vehicle, which launched astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams to the space station on June 5, experienced helium leaks en route. NASA has indicated the return of Starliner\u2019s inaugural crew won\u2019t come until July. \u201cWe are taking our time and following our standard mission management team process,\u201d said Steve Stich, NASA\u2019s Commercial Crew Program manager, in a Friday statement.

{"id": "2024_06_23_cars_eu-china-ev-import-tariffs-talks-intl-hnk", "text": "China\u00a0and the\u00a0European Union have agreed to start talks on the planned imposition of tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles (EVs) being imported into the\u00a0European market, senior officials of both sides said on Saturday. Germany\u2019s Economy Minister Robert Habeck said he had been informed by\u00a0EU\u00a0Commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis that there would be concrete negotiations on tariffs with\u00a0China. The confirmation came after\u00a0China\u2019s Commerce Ministry said its head Wang Wentao, and Dombrovskis, executive vice president of the\u00a0European Commission, had agreed to start consultations over the\u00a0EU\u2019s anti-subsidy investigation into Chinese EVs. \u201cThis is new and surprising in that it has not been possible to enter into a concrete negotiation timetable in the last few weeks,\u201d Habeck said in Shanghai. He said it was a first step and many more will be necessary. \u201cWe are far from the end, but at least, it is a first step that was not possible before.\u201d The minister had said earlier on Saturday that the\u00a0European Union\u2019s door was open for discussions regarding\u00a0EU\u00a0tariffs\u00a0on Chinese exports. \u201cWhat I suggested to my Chinese partners today is that the doors are open for discussions and I hope that this message was heard,\u201d he said in his first statement in Shanghai, after meetings with Chinese officials in Beijing. Habeck\u2019s visit is the first by a senior\u00a0European official since Brussels proposed hefty duties on imports of Chinese-made electric vehicles (EVs) to combat what the\u00a0EU\u00a0considers excessive subsidies. Habeck said there is time for a dialog between the\u00a0EU\u00a0and\u00a0China\u00a0on tariff issues before the duties come into full effect in November and that he believes in open markets but that markets require a level playing field. Proven subsidies that are intended to increase the export advantages of companies can\u2019t be accepted, the minister said. Another point of tension between Beijing and Berlin is\u00a0China\u2019s support for Russia in its war in Ukraine. Habeck noted Chinese trade with Russia increased more than 40% last year. Habeck said he had told Chinese officials that this was taking a toll on their economic relationship. \u201cCircumventions of the sanctions imposed on Russia are not acceptable,\u201d he said, adding that technical goods produced in\u00a0Europe should not end up on the battlefield via other countries. Not a \u2018punishment\u2019 The\u00a0EU\u2019s provisional duties of up to 38.1% on imported Chinese EVs are set to apply by July 4, with the investigation set to continue until November 2, when definitive duties, typically for five years, could be imposed. \u201cThis opens a phase where negotiations are possible, discussions are important and dialog is needed,\u201d Habeck said. Proposed\u00a0EU\u00a0tariffs on Chinese goods are not a \u201cpunishment,\u201d Habeck told Chinese officials earlier in Beijing. \u201cIt is important to understand that these are not punitive tariffs,\u201d he said in the first plenary session of a climate and transformation dialog. Countries such as the United States, Brazil and Turkey had used punitive tariffs, but not the\u00a0EU, he said. \u201cEurope does things differently.\u201d Habeck said the\u00a0European Commission had for nine months examined in detail whether Chinese companies had benefited unfairly from subsidies. Any countervailing duty measure that results from the\u00a0EU\u00a0review \u201cis not a punishment,\u201d he said, adding that such measures were meant to compensate for the advantages granted to Chinese companies by Beijing. Zheng Shanjie, chairman of\u00a0China\u2019s National Development and Reform Commission, responded: \u201cWe will do everything to protect Chinese companies.\u201d Proposed\u00a0EU\u00a0duties on Chinese-made EVs would hurt both sides, Zheng added. He told Habeck he hoped Germany would demonstrate leadership within the\u00a0EU\u00a0and \u201cdo the correct thing.\u201d He also denied accusations of unfair subsidies, saying the development of\u00a0China\u2019s new energy industry was the result of comprehensive advantages in technology, market and industry supply chains, fostered in fierce competition. The industry\u2019s growth \u201cis the result of competition, rather than subsidies, let alone unfair competition,\u201d Zheng said during the meeting.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/23/cars/eu-china-ev-import-tariffs-talks-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/24/2024", "section": "us"}}

On was identified by his mother to CNN as the man in a white hoodie attacking protesters with a long pole in videos distributed across social media. He was arrested on suspicion of felony assault in May. \u201cOur office has completed a thorough review of the incident involving Mr. Edan On who allegedly assaulted another protestor,\u201d Los Angeles County District Attorney George Gasc\u00f3n said in a Friday news release. \u201cWe cannot establish beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. On\u2019s conduct directly caused the victim\u2019s injury. There is no evidence to suggest that Mr. On was working in collaboration with any other individuals; and our investigation found no proof of conspiracy or any organized effort by Mr. On related to the incident,\u201d the district attorney added. \u201cGiven these factors, we believe that the appropriate course of action is to refer the matter to the Los Angeles City Attorney\u2019s Office, which will consider misdemeanor filing.\u201d CNN was the first to identify On, along with other counterprotesters, through a\u00a0review\u00a0of hundreds of hours of video, social media posts and interviews.

{"id": "2024_06_24_business_apple-eu-competition-rules", "text": "European Union regulators have accused Apple of breaking tough new digital competition rules by preventing app developers from freely directing consumers to cheaper services. The European Commission\u2019s preliminary findings stem from an investigation opened in March. If found guilty, the company could face a fine of up to 10% of its $383 billion annual global revenue, the EU\u2019s executive arm said in a statement Monday. The fine can be increased to 20% of the company\u2019s global revenue if it repeats the offense, it added. Monday\u2019s action marks the first time the Commission has accused a company of breaching its landmark Digital Markets Act. The DMA, which came into force in March, is a sweeping set of\u00a0competition rules aimed at curbing the power of Big Tech. That month, the Commission announced that it had launched investigations into Apple (AAPL), Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) and Facebook parent Meta (META) on suspicion they were failing to comply with the DMA. The three companies have been designated as \u201cgatekeepers\u201d by the Commission \u2014\u00a0Big Tech firms crucial to interactions between businesses and consumers through their links to \u201ccore platform services,\u201d such as digital marketplaces and app stores. The Commission must reach the final decision on whether Apple has failed to comply with the DMA within one year from the opening of its investigation on March 25. Apple said in a statement Monday that, over the past few months, it had \u201cmade a number of changes to comply with the DMA in response to feedback from developers and the European Commission. We are confident our plan complies with the law.\u201d More scrutiny The Commission has provisionally found that, according to the rules of Apple\u2019s app store, \u201cdevelopers cannot provide pricing information within the app\u201d or communicate \u201cin any other way\u201d with their customers to steer them toward offers available on alternative platforms. Apple allows so-called \u201csteering\u201d by developers only through links in their apps that redirect customers to a web page, the Commission said. But that \u201clink-out process is subject to several restrictions,\u201d it added. \u201cToday is a very important day for the effective enforcement of the DMA,\u201d Margrethe Vestager, the EU\u2019s competition and digital chief, said in Monday\u2019s statement. \u201cSteering is key to ensure that app developers are less dependent on gatekeepers\u2019 app stores and for consumers to be aware of better offers.\u201d Apple said in its statement: \u201cAll developers doing business in the EU on the App Store have the opportunity to utilize the capabilities that we have introduced, including the ability to direct app users to the web to complete purchases at a very competitive rate. As we have done routinely, we will continue to listen and engage with the European Commission.\u201d The Commission also said it had opened another investigation, into whether Apple\u2019s new contractual requirements for app developers breach the DMA. These requirements include a \u201ccore technology fee,\u201d which charges developers of third-party apps \u20ac0.50 ($0.54) each time their app is installed. The Commission\u2019s initial findings against Apple come only months after it fined the company \u20ac1.84 billion ($1.97 billion) for preventing rival music streaming services such as Spotify from telling iPhone users that they could find cheaper ways to subscribe outside of Apple\u2019s app store. It was the bloc\u2019s first-ever antitrust penalty on the US tech giant. Apple said in a statement at the time that app developers \u201ccompete on a level playing field\u201d on its app store and that it planned to appeal the fine. In January, Apple announced\u00a0changes\u00a0to its handling of apps in the EU in anticipation of the DMA coming into effect. That included plans to allow third-party app stores on iPhones and iPads for the first time\u00a0in\u00a0the company\u2019s history\u00a0and significant cuts to its app store fees.

{"id": "2024_06_08_us_rust-shooting-timeline-alec-baldwin", "text": "The actor Alec Baldwin and several crew members gathered in a church at a New Mexico ranch on October 21, 2021, to rehearse a scene from their upcoming Western film \u201cRust.\u201d Then came the unexpected gunshot. A promising cinematographer was killed, a director was wounded and a film production was left in shambles. Since that day\u2019s fatal shooting of 42-year-old Halyna Hutchins, the film\u2019s armorer and its assistant director have been convicted of criminal charges. And after some back-and-forth legal arguments, Baldwin soon is set to stand trial on charges of involuntary manslaughter. The details of what happened that day have been made public in affidavits, probable cause statements, interviews with the main participants and testimony at criminal trials. Here\u2019s a timeline of the on-set shooting and the resulting legal cases. The shooting May 29, 2020: Baldwin, the three-time Emmy winner for his roles on \u201c30 Rock\u201d and \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d was announced as producer and star of the Western feature film \u201cRust,\u201d based on a story by Baldwin and Joel Souza, Deadline reported. In the film, Baldwin plays a grizzled outlaw on the run from authorities with his 13-year-old grandson. October 6, 2021: Filming of \u201cRust\u201d began at Bonanza Creek Ranch, a movie set outside Santa Fe, New Mexico. October 20, 2021: Several crew members walked off set, citing safety concerns. One crew member stated there had been two accidental weapons discharges and a special effects mess-up that set off explosives around the crew between takes. October 21, 2021: Hannah Gutierrez Reed, the armorer for \u201cRust,\u201d loaded a prop six-shot revolver with what she believed were \u201cdummy\u201d rounds, a term for ammo that contains no explosive elements but appear to be real, according to investigators and her defense attorney. Baldwin and several crew members began rehearsing a scene in a rustic church on set before breaking for lunch. After the break, Baldwin, Souza, Hutchins and a few others returned to the church for rehearsal. Assistant director Dave Halls fetched a prop gun from a cart outside the church and yelled \u201ccold gun,\u201d indicating it was unloaded. He then handed the gun to Baldwin. Baldwin practiced a \u201ccross draw\u201d \u2013 pulling a gun from a holster on the opposite side of his body from his draw hand. The scene required him to point the gun toward the camera, helmed by Hutchins, Souza and a camera operator. Suddenly, they heard a loud bang. Hutchins stumbled backward, slumped to the floor clutching her stomach and said she couldn\u2019t feel her legs. Souza, who had been standing beside her, noticed blood on his shoulder. At 1:48 p.m., the crew reported the shooting to emergency responders. Hutchins was transported by air helicopter to the hospital and was pronounced dead at 3:37 p.m. Souza was treated at the hospital, and a projectile from a live round was removed from his back. Sheriff\u2019s deputies arrived to the scene and began investigating the series of events leading to the shooting. October 22, 2021: Baldwin released a statement calling the death a \u201ctragic accident\u201d and said he is fully cooperating with the police investigation. December 2, 2021: In an interview with ABC, Baldwin said he cocked the gun and let go of the hammer, and the gun then fired. He said he was aiming the gun just to the side of the camera toward Hutchins, as she instructed him to do. \u201cI would never point a gun at anyone and then pull the trigger, never,\u201d he said. The investigations August 14, 2022: FBI testing of the firearm found it could not be fired without pulling the trigger while the gun was cocked, according to a forensics report. The report noted the gun eventually malfunctioned during FBI testing after internal parts fractured, causing the gun to go off in the cocked position without pulling the trigger. August 20, 2022: In an interview with CNN, Baldwin\u00a0placed responsibility\u00a0for Hutchins\u2019 death on Gutierrez Reed, the film armorer and props assistant, and on assistant director Halls, who handed him the gun. October 5, 2022: The family of Hutchins and Baldwin reached an undisclosed settlement in a wrongful death lawsuit filed against the actor and others. As part of the settlement, Matthew Hutchins, the cinematographer\u2019s widower, was named an executive producer on \u201cRust.\u201d January 19, 2023: Prosecutors announced Baldwin and Gutierrez Reed will be charged with involuntary manslaughter in Hutchins\u2019 death. Halls, the assistant director, agreed to plead no contest to negligent use of a deadly weapon, the district attorney\u2019s office announced. The terms of that deal include six months of probation\u00a0and a suspended sentence, prosecutors said. January 31, 2023: Baldwin and Gutierrez Reed were formally charged with involuntary manslaughter. February 23, 2023: Baldwin pleaded not guilty to manslaughter charges and was released on personal recognizance. April 20, 2023: New Mexico special prosecutors dismissed the charges against Baldwin, citing \u201cnew facts\u201d in the case. \u201cThis decision does not absolve Mr. Baldwin of criminal culpability and charges may be refiled,\u201d they said. August 9, 2023: Gutierrez Reed pleaded not guilty to involuntary manslaughter and tampering with evidence. January 19: Baldwin was indicted by a grand jury on charges of involuntary manslaughter. January 31: Baldwin pleaded not guilty to involuntary manslaughter charges for the second time. February 22: The trial of film armorer Gutierrez Reed began. Prosecutors alleged her failures allowed six live bullets to make their way on set, and she did not make vital safety checks that would have caught the problem. Her defense blamed Baldwin for failing to follow common-sense gun safety rules and on the film\u2019s production team for creating a chaotic and unsafe environment. March 1: Souza, the director and screenwriter, testified about the moment he was shot on set while standing behind Hutchins. March 6: Gutierrez Reed was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter after jurors deliberated for nearly three hours. She was acquitted of a charge of evidence tampering. April 15: At her sentencing hearing, Gutierrez Reed said \u201cmy heart aches\u201d for Hutchins\u2019 family and friends, and she asked the judge to sentence her to probation. The judge criticized her statement and sentenced her to the maximum 18 months in prison, saying, \u201cYou alone turned a safe weapon into a lethal weapon.\u201d May 24: A New Mexico judge denied Baldwin\u2019s motion to dismiss the involuntary manslaughter indictment. Baldwin\u2019s attorneys had accused prosecutors of misconduct during the grand jury process. June 3: New Mexico prosecutors asked the court to grant use immunity to Gutierrez Reed and compel her to testify at Baldwin\u2019s trial, according to court documents. Gutierrez Reed invoked her Fifth Amendment right to silence in a pre-trial interview, and prosecutors said if she is not granted immunity then she would not be able to testify in the trial. Gutierrez Reed\u2019s attorney, Jason Bowles, told CNN he will oppose the motion. June 17: Prosecutors signal their intention to portray Baldwin as repeatedly flouting safety protocols on the movie set in the days before the fatal shooting, according to\u00a0a new court filing. Outlining evidence they intend to present, prosecutors highlighted repeated instances in which Baldwin allegedly acted dangerously between October 12 and October 21, 2021. One of\u00a0Baldwin\u2019s attorneys, Luke Nikas, had no comment about the prosecution\u2019s document, but referred CNN to the defense\u2019s most recent filing asking the court again to dismiss the indictment and accusing the prosecution of selected disclosure of evidence. June 21: Judge Mary Marlowe Sommer denied a defense motion asking the court to dismiss the involuntary manslaughter indictment. The defense argued the shooting death was an accident and Baldwin is \u201cnot criminally liable.\u201d The prosecution countered Baldwin is experienced in the movie business and knew he was handling a real gun. A separate motion to dismiss \u2013 in which Baldwin\u2019s team argued the gun used in the shooting was destroyed during forensic testing by the FBI, preventing the defense from recreating the testing \u2013 will be considered at a hearing next week. The judge also denied the prosecution\u2019s motion to grant use immunity to Gutierrez Reed to compel her to testify at Baldwin\u2019s trial.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/08/us/rust-shooting-timeline-alec-baldwin/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/24/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_24_tech_china-huawei-harmony-os-growth-intl-hnk", "text": "Huawei is in the midst of one of the most stunning comebacks in the history of the tech industry. The Chinese giant, which has been a flashpoint in the escalating rivalry between Washington and Beijing, says more than 900 million smartphones now use its in-house operating system Harmony OS. \u201cWe have done in 10 years what our European and American counterparts have done in more than 30 years, and have achieved independent control of the core technology of the operating system,\u201d Richard Yu, the chairman of Huawei\u2019s consumer business group, said at a developer forum on Friday. Harmony, which is called \u201cHongmeng\u201d in Chinese, was first unveiled in 2019, months after Huawei was placed on a US trade blacklist that barred American firms from\u00a0selling tech and software\u00a0to the Chinese tech company without a license. US policymakers have long claimed that Huawei poses a national security risk, alleging that the Chinese government could use the company\u2019s equipment to spy. The company repeatedly denied those allegations, but that didn\u2019t stop some American allies \u2014 such as the UK \u2014 limiting Huawei\u2019s role in building 5G networks. The US ban prevented companies like Google\u00a0(GOOGL)\u00a0from supplying new Huawei devices with its version of Android OS. Those restrictions dealt a huge blow to the Chinese firm\u2019s smartphone ambitions at the time, with some analysts predicting the Huawei phone would become \u201ca brick.\u201d Now the company is once again making its way back to the top. It\u2019s also venturing into new businesses. Last year, it launched an electric sedan to take on Tesla\u2019s Model S. And it has big ambitions in artificial intelligence (AI). Nvidia (NVDA), which is running neck and neck with Microsoft (MSFT) as the\u00a0most valuable public company\u00a0in the world, earlier this year named Huawei a top competitor in a number of areas, including in the\u00a0production of processors\u00a0that power AI systems. Yu said Friday that Huawei\u2019s own AI framework, composed of its Ascend processors, was 1.1 times more effective in training large language models than mainstream international offerings. He did not name the competitors. A surprise development But it\u2019s in smartphones that the revival is so far most obvious. Sales of Huawei\u2019s flagship smartphones rose 72% in the first five months of 2024, compared to the same period a year ago, Yu added, underscoring the company\u2019s ambitions to claw its way back to the top despite severe US restrictions. The Shenzhen-based conglomerate\u2019s popular Mate 60 Pro smartphone made headlines last year when the US government\u00a0sought more information\u00a0about the model, which included a sophisticated processor. Its debut shocked industry experts who questioned how the company could\u00a0acquire\u00a0such  chips following sweeping efforts by the US to restrict China\u2019s access to foreign chip technology because of national security concerns. The company\u2019s net profit soared 564% to $2.71 billion in the first quarter, and that robust jump comes after it recorded its\u00a0fastest revenue growth\u00a0in four years in 2023, thanks to a pick-up in its consumer segment and income from new businesses like smart car components. Huawei is also going after another of the biggest companies in the world. The success of its smartphones in China have directly impacted Apple (AAPL) in the premium segment, according to data from Counterpoint Research in April. The iPhone maker, which led China\u2019s smartphone market with a near 20% share in the first quarter of 2023, fell to third spot in the first three months of\u00a0this\u00a0year, according to Counterpoint. Its market share stood at 15.7%, while Huawei\u2019s jumped to 15.5%, from 9.3% in 2023. Sales of the iPhone began bouncing back in May, after the company aggressively cut prices in its largest overseas market.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/24/tech/china-huawei-harmony-os-growth-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/24/2024", "section": "us"}}

Tamayo Perry, 49, was an \u201ceight-year veteran of Honolulu Ocean Safety and well-known North Shore waterman,\u201d Honolulu Mayor Rick Blangiardi said in a statement. Perry \u201cexemplified bravery, commitment and a deep sense of duty, serving our community with unwavering dedication. His heroic actions and tireless efforts to ensure the safety of our residents and visitors will never be forgotten,\u201d Blangiardi added. Just before 1 p.m. Sunday, Honolulu Ocean Safety and other emergency responders arrived at a beach after a call came in about a surfer who\u2019d been fatally injured in a\u00a0shark\u00a0attack, Honolulu Emergency Medical Services spokesperson Shayne Enright\u00a0said. Honolulu Ocean Safety responded by jet ski and brought Perry to shore, where first responders pronounced him dead. Perry was a lifeguard who was loved by all, a professional surfer known worldwide, and had an \u201cinfectious\u201d personality, Honolulu Ocean Safety acting Chief Kurt Lager said. \u201cAs much as people loved him, he loved everyone else more,\u201d Lager said. Perry made several TV and movie appearances, according to his\u00a0IMBD page. Perry\u2019s bio on the Oahu Surfing Experience\u00a0website lists the \u201cPirates of the Caribbean\u201d movie, \u201cCharlie\u2019s Angels 2,\u201d \u201cBlue Crush,\u201d and hit TV shows \u201cLost\u201d and \u201cHawaii Five-0,\u201d among his credits. Perry also appeared in national and international ad campaigns, he wrote. \u201cWhen I\u2019m not acting, I\u2019m still quite a character, so there\u2019s always a ton of fun to be had,\u201d he said. Perry\u2019s wife, Emilia Perry, was born and raised in Western Australia and competed as a professional bodyboarder before moving to Hawaii, where she met her husband and started surfing competitively, according to her bio on the surfing\u00a0website. \u201cWhen I was 18 years old, I came to Hawaii for a competition and met Tamayo while bodyboarding out at Pipeline. A few years later, I picked up a surfboard, we got married and there was no turning back,\u201d she wrote, adding, \u201cthe vast amounts of ocean knowledge that Tamayo has ingrained in me over the years is priceless.\u201d The University of Florida\u2019s International Shark Attack File lists 120 shark bite incidents in 2023. Of the 36 shark bites that occurred in the US, eight were in Hawaii, one of which was fatal. According to the shark attack file\u2019s 2023 report, surfers experienced 42% of bites worldwide. Though the number of bites and fatalities increased last year, compared to the previous year, the report authors say the numbers are still in line with recent trends. The Honolulu community will provide the necessary support following Perry\u2019s death, the mayor\u00a0said. \u201cAs we grieve this unimaginable loss, we are reminded of the inherent risks faced by our lifeguards daily, and we extend our deepest gratitude for their service,\u201d Blangiardi said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/24/us/tamayo-perry-death-pirates-of-the-caribbean/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/24/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_21_us_fordyce-arkansas-shooting", "text": "Three people were killed and 10 wounded in a shooting at a grocery store in Fordyce, Arkansas, the Arkansas State Police said in a news conference Friday. The 10 people wounded include two police officers. The suspected shooter, identified by authorities as 44-year-old Travis Eugene Posey, was also wounded and taken into custody. Posey, a resident of New Edinburg, is expected to be charged with three counts of capital murder, with additional charges pending, according to an Arkansas State Police news release. Police first received calls about an active shooter at the Mad Butcher grocery store at around 11:30 a.m. local time, Mike Hagar, the Secretary of Public Safety and Director of Arkansas State Police said at the news conference. Law enforcement responded immediately and exchanged gunfire with the \u201clone suspect.\u201d The injuries to the officers and the suspect are not considered life-threatening, according to Hagar. He noted the \u201csituation is secured \u2026contained. There are no active threats to the community.\u201d \u201cThe remaining civilian injuries range from non-life threatening to extremely critical,\u201d he said. Posey was \u201ctreated for non-life-threatening\u00a0injuries after exchanging gunfire with law enforcement, released to ASP custody, and transported to the Ouachita County Detention Center,\u201d ASP said in the release. It is unclear if Posey has retained legal counsel at this point. At least 234 mass shootings have taken place in the United States in 2024, according to data from the Gun Violence Archive, which, like CNN, defines a mass shooting as one in which four or more people are shot, excluding the shooter. The country has seen a spate of shootings in the past few weeks as the summer heat has escalated, with 21 mass shootings recorded by the Gun Violence Archive since last Friday. In a statement on\u00a0X, Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders said she had been briefed on the \u201ctragic shooting\u201d in Fordyce and is in \u201cconstant contact\u201d with state police at the scene. One witness, David Rodriguez, told CNN that he was pulling into a gas station when he heard \u201cpops,\u201d which he thought were fireworks. Shortly after the suspect began firing bullets more rapidly, Rodriguez saw people running from the scene. He then heard sirens and saw ambulances and police arrive at the scene. Rodriguez says the Mad Butcher grocery store\u2019s front windows were broken as if they had been \u201cshot open\u201d by gunfire. Matthew Gill, the meat manager at the\u00a0Mad Butcher,\u00a0told CNN a man came into the store with a shotgun and ended up in a shootout with police. As the shooting unfolded, some people hid in a cooler in the grocery store, Fordyce City Council Member Roderick Rogers told CNN affiliate KATV. He said he was on the phone with someone in the store when the shooting took place. \u201cMan, it was bad,\u201d Rogers said. The council member said that he had talked to survivors of the shooting who \u201care traumatized.\u201d \u201cWe are trying to get some counseling and everything set up at the moment,\u201d he added. Fordyce, a small city in southeast Dallas County, had a population of just 3,396 in 2020.

{"id": "2024_06_23_business_cdk-cyber-attack-global-outage", "text": "Retail software provider CDK Global says it will likely take several days for its software to be back online and operational, as the company grapples with a system\u00a0outage that has paralyzed nearly 15,000 car dealerships across North America since Wednesday. The data provider\u2019s software, which dealerships use to manage everything from scheduling to records, said Saturday it has begun restoring its software. \u201cWe anticipate that the process will take several days to complete, and in the interim we are continuing to actively engage with our customers and provide them with alternative\u00a0ways to conduct business,\u201d a CDK spokesperson told CNN on Saturday. CDK has said it is working to investigate the shutdown after two cyber incidents brought its systems to a standstill. The company has not confirmed who was behind the incidents. Bloomberg previously reported the company was negotiating with an Eastern European-based hacker group demanding tens of millions of dollars in ransom to end the outage. CDK has not responded Sunday to CNN\u2019s request for comment about the reported ransom. Dealers implement temporary solutions Many car manufacturers and dealerships have scrambled to implement temporary solutions to maintain retail operations while their computer software remains offline. In an automated message via its toll-free number Saturday, CDK advised dealership employees to be cautious of phishing scams and take precautions to secure sensitive information such as passwords. Mike Stanton, the president and CEO of the National Automobile Dealers Association, told CNN in a statement the group \u201ccontinues seeking information from CDK on the nature and scope of the cyber incident, so dealers are able to respond appropriately.\u201d \u201cThousands of franchised new-car dealerships rely on CDK to run their businesses and this outage has impacted dealers\u2019 ability to provide a seamless customer experience and process transactions efficiently,\u201d he added. The system shutdown could slow down business and cause shipping delays at dealerships as the summer season gears up. Dealership sales in 2023 topped $1.2 trillion in the United States, according to the National Automobile Dealers Association. Car manufacturer Ford told CNN it is working with dealers to set up alternative software systems and other workarounds. A company spokesperson emphasized the effects of the outage will vary from dealer to dealer. Ford said it encourages customers to contact their local dealership for information. Several dealerships on the East Coast told CNN on Sunday they are manually filling out forms to process sales. Some businesses mentioned they are having issues with registering purchased cars with the state, as they rely on CDK\u2019s software to send registration information to their respective motor vehicle department. One used car dealership told CNN it has been filing paperwork by hand and sending runners to the car registry with the paperwork. Another dealer said they\u2019re still selling cars but can\u2019t complete transactions in a timely manner. In a Friday filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Penske Automotive said while its auto dealers don\u2019t use CDK Global, its Premier Trucking Group division \u2014 which mainly serve businesses \u2014 does use CDK\u2019s dealer management system. Penske said it was working on implementing response plans and its 48 PTG locations remain operational. In another SEC filing, Sonic Automotive said it was also operational but was instating \u201cworkaround solutions to minimize the disruption\u00a0caused by this CDK outage.\u201d The company added the incident will likely negatively impact Sonic\u2019s financial and business operations. Premier Truck Group declined to elaborate on its response plans.

{"id": "2024_06_20_us_baltimore-bridge-collapse-ship-crew-deal", "text": "Twelve weeks after the Dali cargo ship lost power and crashed into a famed Baltimore bridge, the mammoth vessel will soon leave for repairs \u2013 with only a handful of crew on board. The 20 Indians and one Sri Lankan on board have been stuck on the ship since March 26, when the 984-foot ship lost propulsion, veered off course and destroyed the Francis Scott Key Bridge \u2013 killing six construction workers. They\u2019ve been unable to leave for a variety of reasons. But at a Thursday court hearing, a judge approved a deal that would allow eight of the crew members to fly home as early as this week. And on Friday, a spokesperson for the crew\u2019s employer said federal authorities have cleared two more seamen to return home halfway around the world. The two newly cleared crew members are both cadets who were on board as part of a training program when the tragedy unfolded, said Darrell Wilson, a spokesperson for ship manager Synergy Marine. As for the 213-million-pound vessel, which has been docked at Baltimore\u2019s Seagirt Marine Terminal for a month, the Dali is now tentatively scheduled to leave for Norfolk, Virginia, on Monday for repairs. Four crew members will stay on board for the voyage, said the Rev. Joshua Messick, director of the Baltimore International Seafarers\u2019 Center and chaplain for the Port of Baltimore. The crew members who do not have clearance to fly home \u2013 including all the ship\u2019s officers \u2013 must stay in the United States until litigation involving the crash is finished, which could take more than a year, Messick said Thursday. Wilson, the Synergy Marine spokesperson, could not confirm whether the remaining crew members will be forced to stay in the US until the end of litigation. But he said they\u2019re remaining in the US for now \u201cbecause they are participating in the investigation.\u201d The crew members who will stay indefinitely in the US will be moved to hotels or apartments, Messick said. \u201cThey\u2019re anxious, under considerable stress considering they don\u2019t know what the future holds,\u201d Messick said Thursday. \u201cThey don\u2019t know when they\u2019ll see their family again or how they\u2019ll be treated here.\u201d The drama over 8 crew members\u2019 fate While none of the crew members have been charged in connection with the disaster, investigations are underway to determine who might be responsible. Baltimore\u2019s mayor has announced legal action, vowing to \u201chold the wrongdoers responsible.\u201d Attorneys for the city and for a bridge inspector who nearly died in the disaster want to depose the crew members, according to filings in the US District Court of Maryland. But legal technicalities have prevented them from doing so, said Jason Foster, an attorney representing the bridge inspector. The attorneys expressed shock in court documents this week after receiving an email from William Bennett, an attorney representing the ship\u2019s owner and manager, saying eight crew members might soon be able to fly home. \u201cOur clients are in the process of arranging for replacement crew for the DALI,\u201d Bennett wrote in an email to dozens of recipients Tuesday. \u201cWe have been advised that the U.S. Coast Guard will permit certain crew members to return to their home countries but has requested that other crew members remain in the United States.\u201d The eight eligible crew members do not include any officers, Wilson said. They include a cook, a fitter, an oiler and several able-bodied seamen. \u201cAll of these crew members have been interviewed by DOJ and DOJ does not object to their departure from the United States,\u201d Bennett wrote in his email, which was attached to court filings. CNN has reached out to the Department of Justice and the US Coast Guard for comment. Attorneys for the city and the bridge inspector filed emergency motions this week, asking a judge to temporarily ban any crew members from leaving the US because they hadn\u2019t been deposed. But opposing sides reached an agreement late Wednesday that would protect attorneys\u2019 ability to get sworn statements from the crew while allowing some of the seamen to go home. Their depositions \u201cwill be taken in London or elsewhere by written agreement of all parties to the Litigation,\u201d according to terms of the agreement filed in court. The depositions will take place \u201cno sooner than November 2024,\u201d the document states. Synergy Marine and Grace Ocean must make the crew members available for depositions in the months ahead and provide documents including personnel files, employment contracts and training files, according to the terms of the deal. A judge approved the agreement Thursday. But it\u2019s still unclear exactly when those eight seamen will get to leave, Wilson said. Why the crew wasn\u2019t deposed earlier No civil lawsuits can get underway because of a pending request by the ship\u2019s owner and manager to limit their financial liability, said Foster, one of the attorneys representing the bridge inspector. Foster said his client narrowly escaped and lost six friends in the bridge collapse. Six days after the catastrophe, Grace Ocean and Synergy Marine filed a petition in federal court\u00a0asking for a $43.6 million cap\u00a0on potential liability payouts. But a decision on that request probably won\u2019t happen anytime soon, since potential claimants have until September 24 to come forward, Foster told CNN Wednesday. And due to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Foster and other attorneys weren\u2019t able to depose the crew members until all of the potential claimants had come forward \u2013 in other words, possibly September or later. But with the new agreement approved Thursday, the eight crew members\u00a0can leave the country before they\u2019re deposed. And if the ship\u2019s owner or manager violates any terms of the agreement, they could face sanctions by the court. How the crew is faring now Despite months-long separation from their families, the seafarers are in good spirits, said Wilson, the Synergy Marine spokesperson. He said the company \u201clooks after them on a daily basis,\u201d helping make sure they have the supplies they need. And local seafarers\u2019 organizations have \u201cbeen tremendous in helping to look after the crew,\u201d Wilson told CNN on Wednesday. The seamen have had pizza and catered foods delivered as well as access to cricket matches broadcast from their home countries \u2013 \u201cyou know, small touches that mean a lot to the crew,\u201d Wilson said. The fate of 11 crew members who must stay in the US remains in limbo. It\u2019s not clear how many more weeks or months they\u2019ll have to stay half a world away from their loved ones. \u201cAs soon as we can get them cleared,\u201d Wilson said, \u201cwe\u2019d like to return them to their families as well.\u201d CNN\u2019s  Mary Kay Mallonee and Jeff Winter contributed to this report.

{"id": "2024_06_22_us_stoic-philosophers-election-anxiety-cec", "text": "Some people obsessively monitor presidential election polls. Others ignore any political news like an overdue bill. And a few probably wish they could just press a button and fast-forward past this November. Americans have devised all sorts of strategies to deal with the unrelenting stress of this year\u2019s presidential race. The rematch between President Biden and former President Trump has been called \u201cthe most dreaded election in modern political history.\u201d As the two rivals prepare to debate on Thursday, about six in 10 American adults say they are already\u00a0worn out\u00a0by campaign coverage. But there\u2019s another way to cope with anxiety about the future \u2014 by turning to the past. Mention the\u00a0Stoic philosophers\u00a0of ancient Greece and Rome, and it may conjure images of\u00a0boring, bearded White men in togas who lived thousands of years ago. But sages like\u00a0Epictetus\u00a0and\u00a0Marcus Aurelius\u00a0offer plenty of practical advice for today\u2019s voters who are navigating the relentless grind of this year\u2019s presidential election. Stoic philosophy, which\u00a0teaches\u00a0that it is impossible to live a happy life without living virtuously, also talks a lot about confronting one\u2019s worse fears. The definition of Stoicism varies, but bestselling author\u00a0Ryan Holiday\u00a0describes it as the a \u201ctool in the pursuit of self-mastery, perseverance and wisdom.\u201d The first Stoic school was founded in Athens by a philosopher named\u00a0Zeno\u00a0of Citium around the beginning of the 3rd\u00a0century BC. Zeno, who lost his entire fortune in a shipwreck, found consolation in philosophy. He later quipped, \u201cMy most profitable journey began on the day I was shipwrecked and lost my entire fortune.\u201d We too can begin such a journey, Holiday says. He says that like us, the Stoics also knew something about dealing with loss, political instability and living in a time when many people felt politically powerless. He cites Aurelius, a Stoic follower who became one of Rome\u2019s greatest emperors. He led Rome during a\u00a0global pandemic\u00a0that killed at least 10 million people and grappled constantly with war and murderous political divisions. \u201cAurelius experienced this devastating global pandemic that ravaged society,\u201d says Holiday, who just released\u00a0\u201cRight Thing, Right Now,\u201d\u00a0the third installment in his bestselling book series on Stoic virtues. \u00a0\u201cBut he would have also seen what it [the pandemic] did to people: the tribalism, the fear, the anger along with the flights of fancy. He saw everything that we just saw over the last couple of years.\u201d CNN talked to Holiday and\u00a0Massimo Pigliucci, author of \u201cHow to Be a Stoic: Using Ancient Philosophy to Live a Modern Life.\u201d Both authors, through books, videos and podcasts, are two of the most popular modern-day interpreters of Stoicism. They offered three pieces of Stoic advice for handling the anxiety of this year\u2019s election. Don\u2019t let the future destroy the present It pays to look ahead in the world of politics. Pollsters predict trends. Pundits gauge the potential impact of political gaffes. Party leaders assess the implications of court decisions. Worry about the future is constant. That type of worry, though, spreads like a contagion to voters. People obsess about what will happen to them if the wrong candidate is elected. Some fixate on nightmare scenarios about the country descending into civil war. This grinding anxiety echoes Shakespeare\u2019s famous\u00a0line\u00a0from \u201cJulius Caesar\u201d: \u201cA coward dies a thousand times, a hero dies but once.\u201d Stoics only die once, though, because they reject fixating on the future. Stoicism teaches people to separate what they can control from what they cannot. Their advice: don\u2019t become engulfed by nightmare political scenarios that may or may not come to pass. \u201cThe Stoics say that he who suffers before it is necessary, suffers more than is necessary,\u201d Holiday says. \u201cThe idea that you should wake up every day in miserable anticipation of a thing that may or may not happen is to punish yourself on top of whatever the pain that will come from that thing actually happening,\u201d Holiday says. Pigliucci says Stoics coped with the political turbulence of their day by focusing on what they could control: their emotions. He cites the\u00a0Serenity Prayer,\u00a0which is often recited at 12-step programs. The prayer is attributed to\u00a0Reinhold Niebuhr, a towering Christian theologian from the 20th century, and asks God to \u201cgrant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, courage to change the things I can, and wisdom to know the difference.\u201d \u201cSeems like excellent advice for the upcoming presidential elections,\u201d Pigliucci\u00a0says. \u201cHave the courage to do your duty as a citizen; vote, maybe send money or volunteer for a campaign; then accept the outcome because it will be what it will be.\u201d Don\u2019t be too cynical to get involved Maybe you\u2019ve met this type of person. They don\u2019t vote because they say it won\u2019t make a difference.\u00a0 You might hear them in a barbershop or perched on a barstool, griping.\u00a0All politicians are corrupt. The\u00a0Illuminati\u00a0control everything. Pass me a beer. Some people deal with the anxiety of the election by checking out of politics altogether. The ancient Athenians had a word for citizens that refused to exercise their right to vote. They called them\u00a0\u201cidiotai,\u201d\u00a0from which the word \u201cidiot\u201d is derived. Many Stoic leaders would never be labeled as \u201cidiotai.\u201d They were passionately involved in politics and the pursuit of justice. That may surprise people. Stoics get a bad rap because of the way the way the word is\u00a0defined: someone \u201cindifferent to pain or pleasure,\u201d not showing \u201cpassion or feeling.\u201d But ancient Stoic leaders would have been at home jousting on Sunday morning political talk shows or marching in a Black Lives Matter protest. Holiday says Aurelius wrote constantly about justice in his classic book,\u00a0\u201cMeditations.\u201d \u201cHe talks about the\u00a0common good\u00a0more than 80 times in \u2018Meditations,\u201d\u00a0 Holiday says. \u201cHe talks about it more than just about anything. He actually says the whole purpose of life is good character and acts for the common good.\u201d The stereotype of the dispassionate, uninvolved Stoic is \u201cas wrong as it could possibly be,\u201d Holiday says. \u201cIf you look at the actual lives of Stoics, these are people who got married, had families, ran for public office and fought for causes,\u201d Holiday says. \u201cThere was a generation of Stoics that were such a perpetual thorn in the side of emperors that they were known as the\u00a0Stoic Opposition.\u00a0At one point, all of them are kicked out of Rome because they won\u2019t go along to get along.\u201d Cynicism can be masked cowardice \u2014 some cynics are afraid of the risks that come with getting involved. But the Stoic leaders were known for their courage in standing up to political tyrants. Pigliucci tells a famous\u00a0story\u00a0about political courage that centers on \u00a0Helvidius Priscus,\u00a0a Stoic philosopher. When the Roman emperor Vespasian threatened\u00a0Priscus, the Stoic philosopher, with execution for speaking out against political tyranny, Priscus responded by saying: \u201cWell, when have I ever claimed to you that I\u2019m immortal? You fulfill your role, and I\u2019ll fulfill mine. It is yours to have me killed, and mine to die without a tremor; it is yours to send me into exile, and mine to depart without a qualm.\u201d Be kind, even to your political enemies It\u2019s hard not to be cynical when it comes to US presidential politics. Candidates brazenly lie on the campaign trail. Partisan websites and social media platforms spread so much disinformation that\u2019s hard to know what to believe. Politicians who once loudly opposed certain candidates now bend the knee to curry their favor. It\u2019s easy for our dislike for our political opponents to morph into hatred. But Holiday suggests we consider how Aurelius dealt with political treachery in his time.\u00a0 Aurelius survived an attempted coup from his most trusted general. He had unlimited power and could have devised an array of sadistic measures to torment or kill his traitor. \u00a0But he refused to do so. \u201cIn fact, he wept when he was deprived of the chance to grant clemency to his former enemy,\u201d Holiday writes in an\u00a0essay\u00a0on Aurelius. \u201cThe best revenge, Marcus would write \u201cis to not be like that.\u201d When family or friends insult you or stop talking to you because of a political disagreement, it\u2019s easy to respond in kind. The Stoics, though, have two words of advice, Holiday says: Be kind. That may sound na\u00efve when personal attacks have become the norm in modern-day politics and this year\u2019s presidential race. But Epictetus\u00a0said\u00a0that \u201cAny person capable of angering you becomes your master.\u201d \u201cThe Stoics said we should try to see every person we meet as an opportunity for kindness,\u201d Holiday writes in his new book. Holiday says that when Aurelius was on his deathbed, he had one regret: He was still chastising himself over the times he had had lost his temper and been unkind to others. Holiday says he\u2019s had to apply that Stoic advice to his own personal life.\u00a0He has risen in prominence in part because he\u2019s sold a\u00a0reported\u00a06 million books on Stoicism. He\u2019s also built a mini-empire around Stoicism that includes YouTube videos, an Instagram feed and a Stoic newsletter. His elevated public profile has led to some personal challenges. He says he and his family have been constantly harassed because they have taken stands against book banning, in support of women\u2019s rights, and for the removal of Confederate monuments. A friend betrayed him. Holiday says a younger version of himself would have \u201cwanted blood\u201d for those who have tried to hurt him. Instead he considered the actions of Stoic leaders like Aurelius, drawing a direct link between the \u201cdark energy\u201d that the Stoic leaders faced in their time and what he sees in the 2024 presidential election cycle. \u201cThere is this energy across all societies that is driven by hatred, fear, and that wants to protect what it has and prevent other people from getting their piece of it,\u201d Holiday tells CNN. \u201cAnd that energy was certainly there in Roman times. \u201c But solutions to that dark energy are there, too. Stoic leaders may seem like distant figures encased in marble, but we can learn from them, Holiday says. They wrestled with and ultimately defeated the same dark energy that drove the political tribalization of their day. So can we.

First responders found two people with gunshot wounds when they arrived at the scene outside H20 Lounge at 12:47 a.m., the Louisville Police Metro Department said in a statement. One of the victims, a man, was later pronounced dead. The second person was taken to a hospital with critical, life-threatening injuries, police said. Medical staff later reported that another six victims, all adults, showed up at area hospitals following the shooting.

{"id": "2024_06_24_politics_us-ukraine-textbook-funding", "text": "The United States will fund the printing of more than three million textbooks for Ukrainian students to use in the coming school year amid escalated Russian attacks on Ukrainian printing facilities that are part of Moscow\u2019s war \u201cagainst the Ukrainian people,\u201d US senior administration officials told CNN. \u201cBy striking Ukrainian printing presses, Russia is seeking to disrupt the production of Ukrainian textbooks and the education of Ukrainian children,\u201d national security adviser Jake Sullivan said in a statement to CNN. \u201cWe will not let Russia succeed. That is why we are providing assistance to print more than three million textbooks for Ukrainian elementary school students ahead of this school year.\u201d \u201cOur message is clear: We will continue to stand with the Ukrainian people as they defend against Russia\u2019s barbaric war of aggression,\u201d he said. The roughly $8 million in funding for the textbook printing comes as the Biden administration has adjusted its policies in an effort to fortify Ukraine\u2019s military fight against Russia. The administration has\u00a0shifted its policy to allow US weapons\u00a0to be used in strikes into Russian territory where Russian forces are engaging in cross-border attacks into Ukraine \u2013 a change that was first publicly acknowledged in late May as Ukraine worked to push back Russian advances toward the northeastern city of Kharkiv. The administration is also\u00a0prioritizing critical air defense capabilities\u00a0for Ukraine over other countries. \u201cThis all kind of fits together in terms of helping the Ukrainian military to defend its skies but also helping to ensure that Ukraine is able to educate its students and its children,\u201d a senior administration official said. \u201cIt\u2019s not enough to just support their military. Of course, we\u2019re doing that,\u201d the official told CNN. \u201cBut we also recognize that Russia is trying to do something broader than that, which is target Ukraine\u2019s culture and history and identity and we need to respond to that as well.\u201d In late May, Ukraine\u2019s largest printing facility, Faktor Druk, was hit in a Russian missile attack on Kharkiv. The US assessed that it will take six to eight months for Ukraine to repair Faktor Druk, according to the official. The day after the attack, in a daily internal meeting on Ukraine, Sullivan directed his team to address the fallout from the strike, making it \u201can urgent priority\u201d for the US to help ensure that the educational materials make it to the Ukrainian students, the official told CNN. After coordination between the National Security Council, US Embassy in Kyiv, US Agency for International Development (USAID) and the Ukrainian government, it was decided that by \u201cusing existing resources and programs\u201d the US, through USAID, will provide roughly $8 million to fund the printing of the textbooks, the official said. \u201cWe really focused in on hardcover textbooks for first and second graders in Ukraine as an area where they identified the most urgent need, and working with them to identify facilities where these materials can be prepared and printed,\u201d the official said. \u201cSo we really sprang into action in that regard and also sprang into action to allocate supplemental resources to go toward this initiative.\u201d The 3.2 million textbooks will be manufactured at other Ukrainian printing houses in time for the start of the school year in September 2024, the official described. They will be distributed \u201cto approximately 12,700 schools throughout Ukraine,\u201d they added. The Ukrainian Ambassador to the US, Oksana Markarova, called the funding for printing the textbooks \u201cextremely timely and very much valued by the people of Ukraine.\u201d \u201cIt is especially important that funding will be provided to Ukrainian printing houses. It is another investment in our future, and our fight for justice and humanity,\u201d she said in a statement to CNN. \u201cLike so much needed support with defense and weapons, this is yet another sign of strong strategic friendship between our nations.

{"id": "2024_06_23_us_arkansas-grocery-store-shooting-investigation", "text": "The suspect in a mass shooting at a grocery store in Arkansas was armed with a pistol, a 12-gauge shotgun and had a bandolier with dozens of extra shotgun rounds, authorities said. It was one of at least 14 mass shootings in the US since Friday, including one in Ohio, in which 10 people \u2013 including two minors \u2013 were shot. The US has suffered at least 247 mass shootings in just the past six months, according to the Gun Violence Archive, which defines mass shootings as those in which four or more victims are shot. In recent weeks, gunfire erupted at a\u00a0Michigan splash pad, a\u00a0Texas Juneteenth celebration\u00a0and a\u00a0Massachusetts car meetup, among other seemingly innocuous locations. The suspect in the Arkansas grocery store shooting, Travis Eugene Posey, 44, allegedly opened fire at the Mad Butcher in Fordyce on Friday, killing four people ages 23 to 81 and wounding\u00a0nine\u00a0others. \u201cThe suspect arrived at the Mad Butcher armed,\u201d Secretary of Public Safety and Director of Arkansas State Police Mike Hagar said. \u201cWe believe that most, if not all the rounds, fired by the suspect were from the shotgun.\u201d Authorities believe the suspect \u201cimmediately began engaging victims in the parking lot after exiting his truck and then proceeded into the store,\u201d Hagar said. Once inside the grocery store, the suspect \u201cwas firing indiscriminately at both customers and employees,\u201d Hagar said. Law enforcement responded to the shooting around 11:30 a.m. and exchanged gunfire with the suspect, Arkansas State Police said. Officers arrived less than three minutes from the time the first shot was fired, Hagar said. \u201cWhen law enforcement arrived on scene, the suspect exited the store, and the officers redirected his attention towards them,\u201d he said. \u201cHe immediately engaged in a firefight with law enforcement, where they were able to stop the threat,\u201d Hagar said. Posey was \u201ctreated for non-life-threatening\u00a0injuries after exchanging gunfire with law enforcement\u201d and taken to the Ouachita County Detention Center, state police said in a release. Posey is expected to be charged with four counts of capital murder, with additional charges pending, Arkansas State Police said in a\u00a0news release. He is set to appear in court Monday, Dallas County prosecutor Eric Marks said. The suspect\u2019s motive is not yet clear, Hagar said, noting that his criminal history is \u201cvery limited \u2013 if there is any at all.\u201d It was not clear whether Posey had retained legal counsel. Victims include an infant\u2019s mother and a selfless great-grandparent The four people killed in the shooting were identified as Callie Weems, 23; Roy Sturgis, 50; Shirley Taylor, 62; and Ellen Shrum, 81. Weems, the youngest victim, leaves behind her 10-month-old daughter Ivy, according to a GoFundMe page set up by family friends to help with her funeral expenses. \u201cCallie\u2019s life was tragically took yesterday way (too) soon,\u201d reads the campaign, verified by GoFundMe. \u201cWith Ivy being left behind this is a great way for Helen (Callie\u2019s mother) to also do something for her future. She loved her child and everyone witnessed her being a phenomenal mom. Pray for Helen, Ivy and family the days to come will be the hardest.\u201d The young victim\u2019s mother, Helen Browning, is also mourning the death of another victim. She said Sturgis, a logger and a loving father, was part of her extended family, the Associated Press reported. \u201cRoy was as country as cornbread,\u201d Browning told The Associated Press. \u201cHe lived a simple life. He was a simple man.\u201d The oldest victim, Ellen \u201cJanie\u201d Shrum, leaves behind her husband of 63 years, their three children and numerous grandchildren and great-grandchildren, who knew her lovingly as \u201cGrammie.\u201d \u201cShe was completely selfless,\u201d her son, Tait Shrum, told CNN. \u201cShe didn\u2019t have a selfish bone in her body.\u201d Janie Shrum was a devoted Christian and served as a foster parent for several children. An avid gardener, she always shared what she canned, baked and cooked with others. \u201cLove was the key to life for her,\u201d her daughter, Teresa Shrum Crutchfield said. \u201cShe wanted to share that love with others.\u201d Early on in her retirement, Janie Shrum worked as a cashier for a few months at the Mad Butcher \u2013 the store where the mass shooting happened. \u201cWhen she retired she couldn\u2019t stay retired,\u201d Tait said. \u201cShe needed that connection with people, that\u2019s where she got her happiness.\u201d Taylor\u2019s daughter, Angela Atchley, told CNN her mother loved her family and kids and was \u201cthe hardest working woman I know.\u201d \u201cWe are completely lost,\u201d Atchley said. In addition to the victims killed, seven civilians ages 20 to 65 years were injured by gunfire. Four of them were still hospitalized as of Sunday, including a woman who is in critical condition, Arkansas State Police said. Two police officers were also shot and wounded, authorities said, including a Fordyce police officer who was released from a hospital Saturday evening. \u201cI can tell you from what we\u2019ve seen that there appears to be no personal connection to the shooter of any of the victims,\u201d Hagar said. \u201cHe simply started engaging victims indiscriminately \u2014 just as targets of opportunity.\u201d \u2018Mama, pinch me. This can\u2019t be real\u2019 Katrina Doherty was shopping for dinner with her 18-year-old daughter and 4-year-old son when she thought she heard the sound of something falling. Then she saw glass shatter and someone drop to the ground. That\u2019s when she knew gunfire had erupted. Not finding an escape route, Doherty and others followed two store employees and darted into a freezer. The 39-year-old mother said she heard about nine or 10 rounds before making it into the icy shelter. \u201cWe ran in there really fast. We still heard gunshots keep going off,\u201d Doherty told CNN. \u201cIt was like slow motion. My daughter was like \u2018Mama, pinch me. This can\u2019t be real.\u2019 And I was like, \u2019Baby, it\u2019s real.\u2019\u201d Outside, David Rodriguez was pulling into a gas station when he heard \u201cpops.\u201d At first, he thought they were fireworks. Then he noticed the grocery store\u2019s front windows were broken \u2013 as if they had been \u201cshot open\u201d by gunfire, Rodriguez said. Panicked shoppers then sprinted out of the store as gunfire rang out in rapid succession, Rodriguez said. Inside the store\u2019s freezer, frigid customers and employees couldn\u2019t call 911 because there was no service, Doherty said. Her son started to cry, \u201cbut we finally got him calmed down because I didn\u2019t want the shooter to hear,\u201d she told CNN. At one point, one of the employees inside the freezer opened the door, but promptly closed it after seeing a dead body immediately outside, Doherty said. The door remained shut until one of the workers heard police outside, and those in the freezer were escorted out.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/23/us/arkansas-grocery-store-shooting-investigation/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/24/2024", "section": "us"}}
