He was only 12 years old at the time, unaware of the looming war that would soon upend his life. It was April 9, 1948, and Jewish militias had just attacked Deir Yassin, a village about a mile northeast of Zarqa\u2019s home in Ein Karem in what was then the British Mandate of Palestine. At least 100 people, including women and children, were killed \u2013 many stripped, lined up and shot with automatic fire, according to reports from the time archived by the United Nations. The massacre is among the events that led to al-Nakba, or \u201cthe catastrophe,\u201d when roughly 700,000 Palestinians fled or were expelled from their homes by armed Jewish groups seeking to establish the state of Israel. \u201cWe thought we were going to be next,\u201d Zarqa, now 88, tells CNN from his home in New Jersey. \u201cMy father said, \u2018We cannot stay here. They\u2019re going to come and massacre us.\u2019 We had nothing, no weapons, nothing to defend ourselves. That\u2019s the day we became refugees.\u201d On Wednesday, Zarqa joins millions of Palestinians across the world to mark Nakba Day with protests and community events intended to honor the memory of the Palestinians killed and displaced in 1948 and the brutal war unfolding today in Gaza. Part of that commemoration includes a commitment to storytelling, Zarqa says, whereby survivors of the Nakba generation continue to share their experiences with younger Palestinians so the dream of liberation and return never dies. He believes it\u2019s the only way to understand the current war and work toward a just and lasting peace in the region. \u201cMy heart is bleeding,\u201d he says softly. \u201cAt my age, I\u2019m still dreaming of going back home. Palestine is something that is still implanted in my heart and my body. It\u2019s where I was born. It\u2019s where I have my memories. It\u2019s my country.\u201d Yearning for home Zarqa, along with his parents and six siblings, fled Ein Karem on foot, taking very little with them. They walked from village to village, searching for food and sheltering in the homes and garages of kind strangers. The atrocities he witnessed along the way are seared in his memory. \u201cI saw the most horrific things in my life: women coming in with torn clothes and uncovered heads crying, screaming, saying that the Jews \u2013 they weren\u2019t called Israelis at the time \u2013 attacked their village and massacred everybody,\u201d Zarqa says. More than 15,000 Palestinians were killed and 531 towns and villages destroyed during al-Nakba, according to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics, an institute of the Palestinian Authority. Jewish leaders declared independence and the creation of the state of Israel on May 14, sparking a military response from Egypt, Syria and Jordan. The family hoped the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, as it would come to be known, would end in a swift victory for the Arabs. After several weeks, Zarqa\u2019s family returned to Ein Karem. But when they entered the village, they found it had been ransacked and its residents cast out by Jewish militias, Zarqa says. With nothing left to salvage, they fled to Jordan to wait out the war, he recalls. The family initially lived in squalor, surviving off the generosity of strangers and local mosques. They shared a home with other Palestinian refugees in Jabal Al Weibdeh, a neighborhood in Amman, Zarqa says. It had a dirt floor and there were no windows, doors or bathrooms. They often couldn\u2019t shower for months at a time. By March 1949, Israel had won the war and forbidden the hundreds of thousands of Palestinian refugees who had fled or were expelled from returning to their homes and ancestral lands. Zarqa\u2019s family was among them. The family began to build a new life in Jordan, one marked by struggle and poverty, as they patiently waited for permission to return to Ein Karem. But it never came, and decades later Zarqa found himself living in the United States \u2013 even further from his homeland \u2013 trying to raise a small family of his own. \u201cWe made a life in the US, but this still isn\u2019t home. You never forget that you had a house and somebody kicked you out of it,\u201d Zarqa says. \u201cWe will never stop wanting to return.\u201d A responsibility to teach Neither time nor distance has blurred Zarqa\u2019s memories of Palestine. He has passed onto his four children and eight grandchildren every bittersweet memory of Ein Karem, from its acres of orchards to the hilltop where he could see the mountains and Mediterranean sea in the distance. Zarqa remembers Ein Karem so vividly that despite his decades of absence, he was able to give his grandson, Zach Matari, who visited the village in 2019, directions over FaceTime to his old home, now in present-day Israel. An Israeli family is living there. \u201cI remember every inch of my village. If you go there I can tell you there was this apricot tree here, and there was a fig tree there, and that\u2019s the stairs we used to climb,\u201d he says. Jenan Matari, another one of his grandchildren, is a writer and social media influencer who uses her platform to educate followers about Palestinian history, culture and current events, including the war in Gaza. She loves listening to her grandfather\u2019s stories and says her work, which is rooted in his Nakba experience, is a form of resistance. All Palestinians in the diaspora, she says, should use their voices too. \u201cI get really sad for my grandfather, because if I\u2019m feeling triggered by the things that are happening in Gaza, and I\u2019m feeling this depleted and in so much pain watching this, I can only imagine what it\u2019s doing to him and his generation to watch what they lived through happening again, but on an even greater scale,\u201d Matari, 33, tells CNN. Talking about al-Nakba isn\u2019t easy, Zarqa confesses. He often pauses mid-sentence or changes the subject when it hurts a bit too much. But he refuses to be silenced by his grief and even invites other Nakba survivors to his home to share their experiences with family, friends and the wider community Dawud Assad, one of those survivors, lives just 10 miles away. He narrowly survived the Deir Yassin massacre, which he says claimed the lives of 47 family members, including his grandmother and 2-year-old brother. \u201cI was supposed to be dead,\u201d says Assad, who is now 92 and nicknamed Al-shaheed Al-hay, or \u201cthe living martyr.\u201d Assad survived by hiding in a shallow trench near his home, crouching and quietly praying for mercy as bullets grazed his hair. \u201cIt did not begin on October 7. What we went through is exactly what we\u2019re seeing now in Gaza and Rafah,\u201d Assad says, referring to Israel\u2019s ongoing war there. Videos of dead children are especially triggering because they remind him of his slain brother. Israel launched its war in Gaza after Hamas\u2019 brutal attack in Israel on October 7, in which 1,200 people were killed and hundreds of others taken hostage, Israeli officials say. In the seven months since that attack, Israel\u2019s bombing campaign and ground offensive in Gaza has killed more than 35,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health. It also has imposed a siege and razed entire communities, rendering nearly 90% of the population displaced and everyone food insecure. Israel says its military tactics are necessary to defeat Hamas and return the hostages. The International Court of Justice says it\u2019s \u201cplausible\u201d Israel is committing genocide, though a final ruling in the case could take years. Israel \u201cutterly rejects\u201d the allegation. For Zarqa and Assad, the war is reminiscent of the horrors they endured during al-Nakba, and it\u2019s important for them to draw that parallel for young Palestinians in the diaspora, as well as anyone else trying to make sense of the violence. \u201cAl-Nakba never ended,\u201d Zarqa says. They point to recent statements from Israeli officials that have alluded to another Nakba through suggestions of mass killing and displacement, or outright calling for it. In a November interview with Israel\u2019s Channel 12 news, Minister of Agriculture Avi Dichter described the war as \u201cthe Nakba of Gaza 2023.\u201d Following Dichter\u2019s comments, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reportedly urged ministers to choose their words more carefully. \u201cWe must be sensitive,\u201d he said, according to The Times of Israel. Hope for the future Zarqa\u2019s heart remains torn between nostalgia and grief as he concedes he may never again see his beloved Palestine, stroll through the quiet streets of Ein Karem or taste its delicious apricots. But he\u2019s sure his descendants will. There are some 5.9 million Palestinian refugees worldwide, most of them descendants of that 1948 generation of exiles, according to the United Nations. It is \u201cthe world\u2019s longest-standing protracted refugee crisis,\u201d the UN said at a 2023 event marking the 75th anniversary of al-Nakba as it urged a solution grounded in international law. While some countries, including the United States and United Kingdom, skipped the commemoration after Israel called for a boycott, Zarqa elsewhere sees hope: The anti-war protests taking over city streets and college campuses across the world. \u201cI am so proud of them,\u201d Zarqa says. \u201cYou pass on your stories to your children and then they carry the banner and continue to teach their children, and eventually their own grandchildren.\u201d \u201cPalestinians will never forget.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/us/nakba-day-anniversary-palestinians/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "us"}}

William Lawson, a long-time civil rights advocate and founder of Wheeler Avenue Baptist Church in Houston, has died, according to an obituary posted on the church\u2019s website.\u00a0He was 95. Lawson\u00a0was known as \u201cHouston\u2019s Pastor;\u201d a\u00a0trusted voice in the community who\u00a0ushered the city through\u00a0times of crisis and change. In 1962, he\u00a0founded\u00a0the Wheeler Avenue Baptist Church where he was the pastor for more than 40 years. He later joined the\u00a0civil rights movement led by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.,\u00a0whom he considered to be a close friend, the church\u2019s obituary stated. Lawson also set up a local chapter of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), a civil rights organization that was instrumental during the civil rights movement. \u201cLawson, in particular, was known to help build bridges between the powerful and the powerless, as a champion of social justice and community service,\u201d\u00a0the\u00a0church posted. Houston Mayor John Whitmire\u00a0held\u00a0a moment of silence at\u00a0Houston City Hall on Tuesday\u00a0to honor Lawson.\u00a0He encouraged\u00a0Houstonians to \u201cstrive for a fair, safe, and equal Houston in his honor and memory.\u201d \u201cHe is one of the reasons our city is so great,\u201d Whitmire said. \u201cHe helped us during civil rights and social justice like probably no other individual in the country because Houston benefited from his leadership and character.\u201d \u201cI like so many Houstonians, I am deeply saddened by the passing of Rev. William Lawson-a Houstonian icon and pillar of our community,\u201d Democratic Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee said in a\u00a0post\u00a0on X. In a statement to CNN,\u00a0Harris County Commissioner Rodney Ellis\u00a0called Lawson a \u201ctowering figure in our community.\u201d \u201cHe was a pioneering force in the Civil Rights movement, courageously hosting the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. at his church and supporting the brave Texas Southern University students during the sit-ins that spurred integration in our city. His commitment to justice and equality knew no bounds.\u201d Ellis\u00a0also noted that the city\u00a0recently named a park in honor of Rev. Lawson and his late wife. \u201cThe Reverend William and Audrey Lawson Park will serve as a lasting tribute to their shared commitment to uplifting every member of our community,\u201d the statement read. In 2021,\u00a0Rice University honored\u00a0the longtime pastor\u00a0by naming part of its campus \u201cThe Reverend William A. Lawson Grove.\u201d \u201cIf there\u2019s anything that I\u2019d like for my legacy to be, it is for the different cultures of humankind to get to know each other, to respect each other and, if possible, to love each other,\u201d\u00a0Lawson said at the\u00a0unveiling. His daughter,\u00a0Melanie Lawson, an anchor\u00a0with ABC13\u00a0in Houston, was by his side at the ceremony. \u201cWhen it\u2019s your Dad,\u00a0you don\u2019t really think how special they are.

Fotios Geas and Paul J. DeCologero are accused by prosecutors of bludgeoning Bulger to death as fellow defendant Sean McKinnon acted as a lookout in October 2018, just hours after the gangster was transferred to the US Penitentiary Hazelton in Bruceton Mills. The three men have agreed to plead guilty, according to motions filed by prosecutors Monday. The filings do not indicate to which counts they are pleading but say the defendants \u201cagree to cooperate with the United States Probation Office.\u201d Each of the men had been charged with conspiracy to commit first-degree murder. Geas and DeCologero also face first-degree murder and assault charges, according to the filings. McKinnon was charged with making false statements to a federal agent regarding what he knew about Bulger\u2019s murder. A federal judge must approve the plea agreements. Prosecutors are asking for the court to schedule a change of plea hearing, combined with a sentencing hearing. Bulger ruled over Boston\u2019s infamous Winter Hill gang during the 1970s and \u201980s, committing what a judge would later describe as \u201cunfathomable\u201d acts that terrorized the city. He became one of the most wanted men in America as he evaded arrest for 16 years on racketeering and murder charges, gaining him a spot on the FBI\u2019s most-wanted list. Bulger was finally arrested in 2011 and sentenced to life in prison in 2013 after a jury concluded he was responsible for 11 killings, among other crimes. His criminal reign inspired Jack Nicholson\u2019s character in Martin Scorsese\u2019s 2006 film, \u201cThe Departed.\u201d \u201cHe lived violently and he apparently died violently,\u201d said Dick Lehr, author of \u201cWhitey: The Life of America\u2019s Most Notorious Mob Boss\u201d when Bulger was killed at age 89. \u201cIt marks the full circle of a terrible life.\u201d Bulger\u2019s family\u00a0sued prison employees\u00a0after his death, alleging prison wardens and other correctional officers were \u201cintentional or deliberately indifferent\u201d to the danger Bulger faced in prison, and it appeared Bulger was \u201cdeliberately sent to his death.\u201d A judge dismissed the lawsuit in January 2022. However, a December 2022 report by the Justice Department\u2019s Office of the Inspector General detailed a series of missteps by prison officials that may have put Bulger at risk when he was transferred to the West Virginia facility. Among the mistakes outlined was the decision to place Bulger \u2013 one of the most well-known organized figures at the time \u2013 into the general population after prison guards spoke of his impending arrival in the presence of inmates. Inmates\u2019 prior knowledge of his arrival, the report says, dramatically increased the likelihood Bulger faced imminent harm at Hazelton. Recorded phone calls and emails at the time included in the report show how inmates were prepared for what might happen when Bulger arrived. In the report, one inmate interviewed said because other inmates had a \u201cbeef\u201d with Bulger and because he was viewed as a \u201crat\u201d for working with the FBI, \u201cboth the inmates and the staff were speculating about \u2013 and inmates were betting money on \u2013 how long Bulger would stay alive at Hazelton.\u201d CNN\u2019s Hannah Rabinowitz, Ray Sanchez and Kristina Sgueglia contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/14/us/james-whitey-bulger-killing-suspects-guilty-pleas/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "us"}}

As part of a plea deal, the teens were sentenced to serve five years in detention followed by five years of supervised probation, with an additional 20 years in detention suspended, Bentley said. CNN is not naming the defendants because they are minors. A third defendant,\u00a0Mikhi Jackson, who was a minor when the shooting happened but is now 18, was charged with being a minor in possession of a firearm and was sentenced Monday to serve one\u00a0year in prison followed by\u00a0two\u00a0years of supervised probation, according to Bentley. An additional four years of his prison sentence were suspended. A fourth defendant, 18-year-old Tristan Brian Jackson, is awaiting trial on seven counts each of conspiracy to commit first-degree murder and attempted murder, as well as 41 other charges. The shooting disrupted an annual neighborhood celebration known as Brooklyn Day. Aliyah Gonzalez, 18, and Kylis Fagbemi, 20, were killed and 28 others had gunshot wounds, police said. Most of the injured ranged in age from 13 to 19, police said.

What does he know about anything?\u201d Brown said. \u201cThe situation that this kid is in is the situation that thousands of people like him are in here in Baltimore and so many other places. It\u2019s the guns. There is a proliferation of guns in a lot of urban areas and when these young people have access to these guns havoc ensues.\u201d \u201cHe just wants to go home to his grandmother who raised him,\u201d Brown said. Brown said prosecutors did not provide sufficient evidence to show his client shot anybody, but did show evidence he fired multiple shots into a group of people, causing them to flee. CNN has sought comment from attorneys for Jackson and the 16-year-old defendant. Mikhi Jackson, in addition to his year in prison and two years of probation, will be required to participate in a community violence intervention program organized by the local organization Roca, which says it aims to work with 16- to 24-year-olds in Baltimore to address cycles of violence, incarceration and racism.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/14/us/baltimore-block-party-shooting-guilty-pleas/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_05_15_business_china-russia-ties-ukraine-war-intl-hnk-dg", "text": "As countries around the world ramped up sanctions on Russia in the wake of Vladimir Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, it became clear that the Russian president still had a powerful friend in Xi Jinping. The Chinese leader, who declared a \u201cno limits\u201d partnership with Russia weeks before the full-scale invasion, set a policy of decrying sanctions and continuing to strengthen ties with Putin. This week, Xi is welcoming him to China for a two-day state visit \u2014 their fourth in-person meeting since Russia\u2019s onslaught in Ukraine began. The war has driven the two leaders and their economies closer together \u2014 with trade hitting record levels last year as Russia upped its imports of key commodities from China and Chinese buyers lapped up discounted Russian fuel. The United States has said Chinese exports of products like machine tools and microelectronics are enabling Russia to bolster the defense industrial base powering its war in Ukraine, and official data show hefty increases of related goods that are consistent with those claims. China has repeatedly\u00a0defended its trade\u00a0with Russia as part of normal bilateral relations. It also says it maintains a neutral position on the war and plays no other role than seeking peace. Here\u2019s how the two sides have upgraded their ties since February 2022. Sanctions\u00a0drive economies closer The European Union, the US and many of its allies and others across the world have imposed a range of sanctions targeting Russian entities and the flow of goods to and from the warring country. Those have included efforts to limit its revenue from key exports like fuel, as well as its access to technologies and goods with military applications. Despite these efforts to isolate Putin\u2019s government and reduce its war coffers, Russia\u2019s economy blew past expectations to grow by 3.6% in 2023, according to data from the International Monetary Fund. That followed a contraction in 2022, according to Russian state media. The sanctions have caused a sweeping shift in who Russia trades with \u2014 and China has emerged as a key economic lifeline, greatly expanding trade ties with its northern neighbor.\u00a0The two countries last year racked up $240 billion in bilateral trade, hitting a target to exceed $200 billion in two-way trade by 2024 ahead of schedule \u2014 a feat lauded by both Putin and Xi. That\u2019s driven China to rank as Russia\u2019s top trade partner, Putin declared last year, with his presidential aide later confirming to Russian state media that the country\u00a0had surpassed the EU to take that spot. As the EU slashed purchases of Russian fuel and limited exports ranging from high-tech goods to transportation equipment, China bolstered its own exports of\u00a0industrial and commercial goods to the country, such as vehicles, machinery and home appliances, data and official statements show. Russia has also become China\u2019s main oil supplier, overtaking Saudi Arabia, according to official Chinese trade data. China, however, is not alone in taking advantage of Russia\u2019s need to find new markets for its fuel, with India also among buyers upping imports in the wake of the war. Governments warn against support for Russia\u2019s war effort The wartime surge in trade, and growing purchases of oil, have sparked criticism in the West that China was helping to fund Russia\u2019s war. Western governments and independent analysts also raised alarm that dual-use goods with potential military applications are part of these surging imports. White House officials in recent weeks have confronted China on what they believe is Beijing\u2019s substantial support for Russia\u2019s defense industrial base, including through exports like semiconductors, materials and machine tools they say are enabling Russia to ramp up production of tanks, munitions and armored vehicles. In a visit to Beijing late last month, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned Chinese leaders that the US and other countries would act if Beijing didn\u2019t move to stem this flow. French President Emmanuel Macron and his European Commission counterpart Ursula von der Leyen also pressed Xi on such supplies during the leader\u2019s state visit to France last week, with Von der Leyen saying after the meeting that \u201cmore effort is needed to curtail delivery of dual-use goods to Russia that find their way to the battlefield.\u201d Beijing has previously slammed the US as making \u201cgroundless accusations\u201d over \u201cnormal trade and economic exchanges\u201d between China and Russia. But analysts have pointed to nascent, potential signs that China may be seeking to dial down such imports \u2014 with China\u2019s monthly exports to Russia declining in both March and April compared with the same periods in 2023, according to official Chinese customs data. Putin and Xi\u2019s high-level friendship Xi and Putin\u2019s relationship has also appeared to strengthen as both leaders consolidated power,\u00a0rewriting\u00a0previous term limits in recent years to extend their\u00a0respective lengthy rules. The war has not changed that dynamic. Putin\u2019s overseas travel has declined since the outbreak of the conflict, but this trip marks his second to China since the invasion and the two leaders\u2019 fourth in-person meeting in that time. Xi has made a single known phone call to Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky during that period and met US President Joe Biden in person twice on the sidelines of international summits since Biden took office in 2021. Xi and Putin have a history of marking milestones together. This week\u2019s visit is Putin\u2019s symbolic first international visit since his victory in a tightly controlled election in March. It mirrors Xi\u2019s state visit to Russia in March 2023, which was the Chinese leader\u2019s first overseas trip after starting a norm-shattering third term as president.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/business/china-russia-ties-ukraine-war-intl-hnk-dg/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_05_15_investing_gamestop-short-sellers-nightcap", "text": "The only bet riskier than buying meme stocks like GameStop may be cheering for their decline. That\u2019s the lesson Wall Street\u2019s short-sellers are learning the hard way this week. See here: For the first four months of the year, GameStop short-sellers \u2014 investors who bet on a stock\u2019s decline \u2014 were sitting on $392 million in gains, up nearly 50%. But with this week\u2019s surge, those gains have vanished and left shorts with more than $1.2 billion in paper losses, according to research from S3 Partners. Nearly $1 billion of that was wiped out Monday alone. To understand the meme stock phenomenon, it helps to understand a bit of the tribalism underpinning it. When meme stocks first emerged in 2021, the day traders running up the price of GameStop weren\u2019t a bunch of anti-establishment marauders attacking Wall Street generally \u2014 they were going for the short-sellers, regarded by many, from retail investors to CEOs like Elon Musk, to be the most reviled traders in finance. After all, no one likes the guy who gets rich off of others\u2019 failings. (Short-sellers argue, however, that they play an important role in preventing market bubbles.) Disgust for short-sellers fueled GameStop\u2019s 2,000% surge that ultimately squeezed firms like Citron Research to retire from the short-selling game and, a year later, forced the hedge fund Melvin Capital to fold entirely. The Reddit community that originated the frenzy, WallStreetBets, preached an us-vs.-them investing style, often using profane language and memes to paint the short-sellers as the enemy. If you were one of the Apes (as the day traders called themselves), inflicting financial pain on the shorts was just as important, if not more important, than lining your own pockets. Meme mania 2.0? Although the meme fever is rising this week \u2014 set off by a single, wordless social media post by the GameStop stock guru RoaringKitty \u2014 we\u2019re unlikely to see a repeat of the frenzy that gripped Wall Street three years ago. At that time, GameStop\u2019s \u201cshort interest,\u201d aka the number of shares sold short relative to its total public float, was a staggering 140%, meaning some shares had been shorted more than once. Today, short interest is just 24% \u2014 firmly in negative sentiment territory, but nowhere near the absurd levels of January 2021. Today\u2019s GameStop shorts aren\u2019t likely to hang on and repeat the mistakes of their Melvin Capital brethren. Then again, shorts and their meme-pushing long-positioned enemies share a reputation for relentlessness. Looking at the fundamentals of GameStop \u2014 a mall-based retailer that\u2019s burning through cash and has already slashed expenses to stay in business \u2014 it\u2019s easy to understand why folks are wagering that it\u2019s on the decline. \u201cBuy to cover\u201d trades will force a lot of shorts out of their positions and push GameStop\u2019s stock price higher than the day traders could on their own, wrote Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of predictive analytics at S3 Partners, in a note Tuesday. \u201cBut there will also be new short sellers entering the ring, with GME\u2019s stock price over $30 being an attractive entry point.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/investing/gamestop-short-sellers-nightcap/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_05_15_us_baltimore-bridge-collapse-house-hearing", "text": "The cargo ship Dali experienced two blackouts while moored in the Port of Baltimore a day before its catastrophic collision with the Francis Scott Key Bridge, and efforts to resolve those blackouts may have impacted the ship\u2019s operations, the head of the National Transportation Safety Board said in a congressional hearing Wednesday. After the two in-port blackouts on March 25, the ship\u2019s crew switched to a different transformer and set of breakers from those that had been in use for several months, according to NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy. That may have impacted the ship\u2019s operations when it left the port a day later, she said. \u201cSwitching breakers is not unusual but may have affected operations the very next day on the accident voyage,\u201d Homendy said. The comments, which add further context to the focus of the NTSB investigation, came during a hearing for the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure reviewing and analyzing the federal response to the collapse of the Key bridge on March 26. On Tuesday, the NTSB released a 24-page preliminary report detailing investigators\u2019 early factual findings. The Dali struck the bridge with enough force to bring down the 1.6-mile-long steel structure, killing six construction workers on the bridge and severing access to critical shipping routes in and out of the Port of Baltimore. The report found the Dali was just three ships\u2019 lengths from the bridge when it suffered a pair of catastrophic electrical failures, which\u00a0caused several pumps required for the ship\u2019s propeller and rudder to stop working. The emergency generator activated but was not configured to power the ship, the report said. At Wednesday\u2019s hearing, Homendy described the ship as \u201cessentially drifting\u201d before crashing into the bridge. The NTSB report found that the Dali had experienced two blackouts a day earlier while still moored in the port. \u201cThe NTSB is still investigating the electrical configuration following the first in-port blackout and potential impacts on the events during the accident voyage,\u201d the report states. Homendy said Wednesday the NTSB has been working closely with Hyundai, which manufactures the ship equipment, to try to replicate some of the electrical problems of that day and understand better what happened. An NTSB preliminary report does not conclude a probable cause. Those findings will be part of a final report that could take investigators up to two years to complete. Officials estimate cost and timeline of replacement bridge The House committee hearing Wednesday featured testimony from Homendy, Coast Guard Vice Adm. Peter Gautier, Army Corps of Engineers Major Gen. William H. Graham and Federal Highway Administration Administrator Shailen Bhatt. The officials offered several estimates for the steps ahead. The Dali is expected to be refloated and removed from the port early next week, Gautier said, and the full channel is on track to be open by the end of May, Graham said. Further, a new replacement bridge is estimated to be open in 2028 and cost about $1.7 to $1.9 billion, Bhatt said. In the meantime, Homendy recommended that bridge operators and owners reexamine how US bridges are protected from incoming ships, noting the increasing size of cargo ships over the decades. \u201cIn this situation, you have a bridge that began operations in 1977, and if it was built today it would be built differently,\u201d she said. Video footage from moments before the crash showed plumes of black smoke coming from the 213-million pound vessel as well as the lights\u00a0flickering on and off. The NTSB report details the frantic efforts of those on the Dali to stop the ship and warn those on the bridge of potential disaster. The report also highlights the near-catastrophic experiences of a crew member on the ship and a road maintenance inspector on the bridge. The crew member was on the bow of the ship at the time of the crash. \u201c(He) told investigators that, as he was releasing the brake on the port anchor, he had to escape from the falling bridge before he was able to reapply the brake,\u201d the report states. The inspector on the bridge had been walking the span when the ship struck. \u201cHe ran north and made it to the nearest surviving span before the rest of the bridge collapsed,\u201d the report states. Six construction workers\u00a0who were filling potholes on the bridge were killed in the disaster. The victims were immigrants from El Salvador, Mexico, Guatemala and Honduras\u00a0who worked\u00a0to support their families.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/us/baltimore-bridge-collapse-house-hearing/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_05_13_us_baltimore-bridge-collapse-demolition-monday", "text": "The trapped cargo ship Dali will \u201chopefully\u201d be refloated this week after authorities set off charges at a key portion of the collapsed Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore on Monday evening, an official said. The charges helped demolish a portion of the bridge wreckage that was resting on the ship \u2013 a move meant to help free the vessel, nearly seven weeks after it struck the bridge and caused the span to collapse. During the planned detonation, a chunk of the collapsed structure appeared to fall away from the ship and into the water, though a portion of wreckage remained on top of the ship, video showed. Officials are \u201cvery pleased\u201d with the demolition but will be conducting surveys with divers to make sure nothing fell and damaged the hull of the cargo vessel, US Army Corps of Engineers Col. Estee Pinchasin told reporters. Additionally, before the ship can be refloated, officials must verify that all the charges went off, Pinchasin said. A loud explosion rung out and dark plumes of smoke surrounded the wreckage after the charges were set off. A \u201ctremendous amount of steel\u201d was removed from the Dali, Pinchasin said. Authorities would now examine how the remaining debris sat on the bow of the ship, the colonel said. While teams are prepared to move the remaining wreckage, Pinchasin doesn\u2019t believe more explosives will be used, she said. The targeted explosion took place just after 5 p.m. ET after inclement weather, including lightning, had forced the operation to be postponed over the weekend. The demolition, which included using small explosives to break apart a massive chunk of the\u00a0Baltimore bridge\u00a0that collapsed on a cargo ship nearly seven weeks ago, was originally set for Saturday, but bad weather forced officials to push the operation to Sunday before it was eventually rescheduled for Monday, the Coast Guard said. After necessary assessments and surveys, the plan is to remove ballast to make the ship buoyant on its own and then use four tugboats to pull it out into the channel and escort it to the pier, US Coast Guard Capt. David O\u2019Connell said. Additional wreckage and containers will be removed from the Dali at the pier and the ship will undergo necessary, temporary repairs before more permanent ones can be made. \u201cHopefully we\u2019re going to refloat the Dali in the next few days. We still anticipate to be on time to open full channel by the end of the month,\u201d O\u2019Connell said. The 213-million-pound Dali cargo ship, veered off course March 26 and struck a pillar of the Francis Scott Key Bridge, causing the bridge to fall into the Patapsco River below. The collapse killed\u00a0six construction workers\u00a0and destroyed a key thoroughfare, threatening the economy at the Port of Baltimore. It also sparked multiple investigations into what went wrong and who is responsible. Monday\u2019s planned demolition comes days ahead of a Wednesday hearing scheduled by the\u00a0House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, with\u00a0testimony expected\u00a0from the chair of the National Transportation Safety Board and officials from the Coast Guard, Army Corps of Engineers and the US Department of Transportation. \u201cWe will absolutely not sacrifice safety for speed,\u201d the Coast Guard\u2019s Nick Ameen said Sunday of the weather delay. \u201cWhenever there\u2019s a lightning strike in the area, that pushes the clock back, and so that clock just kept getting pushed back and pushed back.\u201d Officials began moving forward with the demolition process after the body of the sixth victim was recovered from the water last week. The 21 members of the ship\u2019s crew \u2013 who have not left the ship in the almost seven weeks since it struck the bridge \u2013 remained onboard during the operation, according to Darrel Wilson, a spokesperson for Synergy Marine Group, which manages the Dali. The crew members \u201care all safe and standing by to continue assisting the response,\u201d Wilson said. \u2018Safest and swiftest method to remove the bridge piece\u2019 \u201cThe safest and swiftest method to remove the bridge piece from on top of the M/V Dali is by precision cuts made with small charges,\u201d the Key Bridge Response Unified Command said in\u00a0a news release last week. \u201cThis is an industry-standard tool in controlled demolition that will break the span into smaller pieces,\u201d it added, \u201cwhich will allow the work of refloating the vessel and removing it from the federal channel.\u201d The US Army and the US Army Corps of Engineers had said the demolition process would \u201clook like multiple puffs of smoke and sound like fireworks,\u201d in an infographic. Nearby communities were to receive a \u201ccellular notification\u201d beforehand, according to\u00a0Unified Command, which includes\u00a0state and federal authorities, the US Coast Guard and Army Corps of Engineers among them. Ship\u2019s crew have not left since collision While engineers tackle the logistics of clearing a tangled mess of metal to free the Dali, members of Baltimore\u2019s seafaring community remain concerned for the crew\u2019s well-being given the length of time they\u2019ve been aboard the ship. \u201cThey will have a safe place on the vessel where they can shelter during the controlled explosion,\u201d Wilson, with Synergy Marine Group, said, adding the crew was \u201cholding up well\u201d despite the stress of recent weeks. \u201cEven though they are not sailing, they are still performing\u00a0their normal crew duties,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cThis is still a large, complicated piece of equipment and there is a lot they have to look after.\u201d The Singapore Maritime Officers\u2019 Union and the Singapore Organization of Seamen issued a joint statement over the weekend saying they are concerned about \u201cthe potential criminalization\u201d of seafarers aboard the ship as the investigation unfolds. The crew is well taken care of but feels disconnected from the rest of the world, Rev. Josh Messick, executive director of the Baltimore International Seafarers\u2019 Center, told CNN. They have internet access, thanks to hotspots Messick\u2019s group helped deliver, but they do not have their cell phones. The FBI had confiscated the crew\u2019s cell phones as part of the investigation, Messick said. That has kept the crew members disconnected from their families and unable to access critical resources, the unions say. \u201cThey are a little anxious because of the phone situation. We are trying to get their cell phones back to them,\u201d Messick said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just a phone, they can\u2019t access their online banking, their finances, their contacts, they can\u2019t look at photos of their loved ones before they go to sleep at night. It\u2019s a lot more than just a phone.\u201d According to the unions, their representatives were aboard the Dali in April to ensure the crew\u2019s well-being. They are requesting the crew\u2019s visas be extended or renewed to allow for shore leave. The unions are also requesting expedited repatriation for crew members not required for further investigation and the return of their electronics. \u201cHowever long the investigation takes, the crew\u2019s rights and welfare should not be infringed upon during its course,\u201d said Dave Heindel, president of the Seafarers International Union.

{"id": "2024_05_14_us_top-baby-names-2023-cec", "text": "There\u2019s a new arrival on the list of the most popular baby names in the US. Mateo made it into the boys\u2019 top 10 list for the first time, becoming the sixth-most popular boys\u2019 name in 2023 and edging Benjamin off the list, according to recently released data from the Social Security Administration. \u201cMateo had a huge jump. \u2026 The fact that Mateo went from No. 11 in 2022 to No. 6 in 2023 is insane. We don\u2019t see that very often at the top of the charts,\u201d says Sophie Kihm, editor-in-chief of the baby name website Nameberry. Names leading the list don\u2019t tend to shift quickly, Kihm says. Liam and Olivia are topping the rankings for the fifth consecutive year. And Mateo is the only new name to reach the highest tier. The name\u2019s inclusion on the boys\u2019 top 10 list also marks a milestone, Kihm says. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty much the first identifiably Latino name, too, at least on the boys\u2019 side,\u201d she says. More than 11,000 babies in the US were named Mateo last year, the highest number on record, according to the Social Security Administration. The name, which means \u201cgift of God,\u201d began ranking in the top 1,000 in 1995, Kihm says. Two decades later, it had reached the top 100. And in recent years, its popularity has intensified at an even faster rate, Kihm says. Kihm, who also works as a consultant helping people name and rename their babies, points to several trends she suspects are contributing to Mateo\u2019s rise. The name\u2019s rising popularity is likely linked to the growing Latino population in the US, says Kihm, who notes it\u2019s become increasingly common for people of many different backgrounds to turn to their heritage when naming their babies. But Mateo also has cross-cultural appeal, as do all names that reach the top tier of the Social Security Administration\u2019s list, she says. \u201cIt feels friendlier and more accessible than Matthew. It has that nice \u2018-o\u2019 ending, which people really like right now. \u2026 It feels very fresh, but it still is traditional,\u201d she says. Pop culture and social media are shaping name trends Mateo\u2019s arrival on the top 10 list wasn\u2019t the only surprise in the latest rankings. Officials also pointed out that pop culture is having an impact on the list of baby names that are rising in popularity the fastest. Kaeli was the fastest-rising girls\u2019 name last year, jumping to No. 678 in the rankings. In a news release Friday, the Social Security Administration credited a social media influencer for inspiring the trend. \u201cParents must have really smashed the \u2018like\u2019 button for YouTube and TikTok star Kaeli McEwen (also known as Kaeli Mae), who routinely promotes a clean, tidy, and neutral-aesthetic lifestyle,\u201d the news release said. Word that her name was rising in popularity came as a surprise for McEwen, who has 14.7 million followers on TikTok but so far hasn\u2019t heard of anyone naming a child after her. \u201cI was a little shocked to see that for sure. \u2026 Growing up & even now, I don\u2019t know any other \u2018Kaeli\u2019s\u2019!\u201d she told CNN in an emailed statement.\u00a0 \u201cI do love the spelling of my name, so it\u2019s pretty cool to see it become more popular!\u201d Kihm of Nameberry says social media may also have fueled the growing popularity of the second fastest rising girls\u2019 name in 2023: Alitzel. \u201cThere was a really popular TikTok in Spanish that was putting out all of these indigenous American girl names, and Alitzel was the first one, and it had more than 1 million views,\u201d she says. The boys\u2019 name Chozen also saw its popularity skyrocket, to No. 813 on the list, after a character with that name became a hero in the latest season of \u201cCobra Kai,\u201d the Social Security Administration said. Kihm traces the name\u2019s rising popularity back even earlier, to 2015, when NFL player Cam Newton named his son Chosen. But one pop culture icon didn\u2019t see a big bump on the baby name list last year, despite the box-office success of the movie that featured her: Barbie. Just 32 people in the United States named their child Barbie last year, according to official data, only a slight increase from the previous year. The name didn\u2019t crack the \u201ctop 1,000\u201d baby name list last year.

The 24-page report details investigators\u2019 early factual findings on the March 26 disaster that took down the 1.6-mile long steel structure, killing six construction workers on the bridge and severing access to critical shipping routes in and out of the Port of Baltimore. According to the report, the two power outages occurred three ships\u2019 lengths from the bridge and were\u00a0triggered by the tripping of two critical circuit breakers, which\u00a0caused several pumps required for the ship\u2019s single propeller and its single rudder to stop working. The emergency generator was not configured to power the ship, the report said. The ship at the time of the failure was under the control of an apprentice pilot, who was accompanied by a senior pilot. When the pilots boarded, the captain reported the ship was in good working order, according to the report. NTSB investigators said the crewmembers tested negative for drugs and alcohol, and the fuel tested negative for contaminants three times. About 10 hours earlier, while the ship was still moored in the Port of Baltimore, it experienced two onboard blackouts, one caused by a crew error, according to the report. \u201cThe NTSB is still investigating the electrical configuration following the first in-port blackout and potential impacts on the events during the accident voyage,\u201d the report states. The FBI and Coast Guard are looking into whether the crew failed to report the\u00a0in-port power outage as part of a criminal investigation, according to a US official familiar with the matter. An NTSB preliminary report does not conclude a probable cause. Those findings will be part of a final report that could take investigators up to two years to complete. The report notes several areas that are still being investigated, including \u201cthe design and operation of the Dali\u2019s power distribution system (including its breakers).\u201d The report took 49 days to publish, longer than the typical month it takes for the agency\u2019s investigators to publish such a report.

Video footage from moments before the crash showed plumes of black smoke coming from the vessel as well as the lights flickering on and off, likely due to an emergency generator activating after an initial blackout. Six construction workers\u00a0who were filling potholes on the bridge were killed in the disaster. The victims were immigrants from El Salvador, Mexico, Guatemala and Honduras who worked to support their families. The NTSB report details the near-catastrophic experiences of a crew member on the ship and a road maintenance inspector on the bridge. The crew member was on the bow of the ship at the time of the crash. \u201c(He) told investigators that, as he was releasing the brake on the port anchor, he had to escape from the falling bridge before he was able to reapply the brake,\u201d the report states. The inspector on the bridge had been walking the span when the ship struck. \u201cHe ran north and made it to the nearest surviving span before the rest of the bridge collapsed,\u201d the report states. The bridge\u2019s collapse also has strangled the regional infrastructure. The wreckage of the bridge has clogged the port, a major shipping channel for the sugar and automotive industries. In addition, the Key Bridge was a critical thoroughfare, with 30,000 commuters relying on it every day, Maryland Gov. Wes Moore said. Officials have vowed to rebuild the bridge \u2013 but the exact cost remains unclear. A spokesperson for the Insurance Information Institute has estimated the bridge alone could be worth more than $1.2 billion. President Joe Biden has said he\u2019s committed to helping rebuild the bridge as soon as possible and said the federal government will bear the costs. Multiple investigations are underway to try to determine who might be responsible for the catastrophe. Last month, Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott announced a probe \u201cto hold the wrongdoers responsible and to mitigate the immediate and long-term harm\u201d to residents. The ship\u2019s Singaporean owner, Grace Ocean Private Limited, and manager, Synergy Marine PTE LTD, filed a petition in federal court last month asking for a $43.6 million limit on potential liability payouts. The city of Baltimore has asked the court to deny that request. It also filed a legal claim against Grace Ocean and Synergy Marine, accusing both companies of having an \u201cincompetent crew\u201d aboard the Dali that lacked proper skill and training, Darrell Wilson, a spokesperson for the ship\u2019s owner and manager, declined to comment to CNN \u201cout of respect for the ongoing investigations and any future legal proceedings.\u201d This is a developing story and will be updated.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/14/us/baltimore-bridge-collapse-ntsb-report/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "us"}}

Despite a surge in hiring last year, new data from the FAA shows air traffic control stations nationwide are still about 3,000 controllers short. Here\u2019s what else you need to know to\u00a0Get Up to Speed and On with Your Day. 1. Trump trial Former President Donald Trump\u2019s ex-attorney and fixer Michael Cohen continued his fiery testimony Tuesday in Trump\u2019s criminal hush money trial. Cohen detailed the hush money scheme involving adult film actress Stormy Daniels before the 2016 election and walked the jury through the $130,000 he says he paid at Trump\u2019s direction \u2014 all of which Trump denies. Meanwhile, Tuesday saw the biggest group of Republican politicians appearing outside the Manhattan courthouse to show their support for the former president. The list included House Speaker Mike Johnson, Trump\u2019s onetime presidential-rival-turned-VP-hopeful North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance, Florida Reps. Byron Donalds and Cory Mills, and former presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy. 2. Israel The Biden administration on Tuesday began the process to move ahead with a new $1 billion weapons deal for Israel. The potential arms sale comes as the administration has paused the shipment of 2,000-pound bombs and 500-pound bombs to Israel, citing opposition to the weapons being used in the densely populated areas of Rafah \u2014 where more than 1 million people are sheltering. The move, however, signals the Biden administration will continue to make sure that Israel has the military capacity to defend itself, indicating that longer-term weapons deals are not going to be halted at this time. 3. Bus crash Eight farm workers are dead and 45 others were injured in a bus crash in north-central Florida on Tuesday. The bus carrying \u201capproximately 53 farm workers\u201d and a pickup truck sideswiped each other about 15 miles west of Ocala, the Florida Highway Patrol said in a statement. The driver of the pickup truck has been charged with eight counts of \u201cDriving Under the Influence \u2014 manslaughter,\u201d local officials said. In a news conference Tuesday evening, Juan Sabines, the Mexican consul in Orlando, said the victims were all from Mexico and were in the US on temporary agricultural worker visas. 4. Tariffs President Joe Biden is increasing tariffs on $18 billion in Chinese imports across a handful of sectors deemed strategic to national security \u2014 an attempt to cripple Beijing\u2019s development of critical technologies and instead prioritize US production. The increases will apply to imported steel and aluminum, legacy semiconductors, electric vehicles, battery components, critical minerals, solar cells, cranes and medical products. The new tariff rates will take place over the next two years. This follows other recent attempts by Washington to limit Chinese companies\u2019 influence on US consumers and national security, especially ahead of the presidential election in November. 5. Canadian wildfires More than 100 raging wildfires in Canada are forcing thousands to evacuate as flames encroach on communities. Roads out of Fort McMurray in Alberta were crammed with evacuating cars Tuesday as an out-of-control 51,000-acre wildfire creeps toward the city\u2019s edge. The approaching flames are worrying residents who lived through the 2016 fires, which forced 90,000 people to evacuate and wrought billions of dollars in damage on homes and businesses. Despite wet weather on the horizon, firefighting will remain a challenge in several provinces through midweek due to gusty winds. Hazardous smoke from the blazes has also been wafting into the US and reducing air quality.

The boat fits the description of the one that hit Ella Adler, and is in custody, authorities said on Tuesday. The boat\u2019s owner is cooperating with the investigation, the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission said. The vessel didn\u2019t stop after striking the teenager, and a $20,000 reward is being offered for information leading to an arrest in the case. Ella, the granddaughter of US Ambassador to Belgium Michael M.

{"id": "2024_05_12_us_wildfire-smoke-from-british-columbia-causing-dangerous-air-quality", "text": "More than 100 blazes are burning across Canada Monday, with several major wildfires prompting evacuations for hundreds of residents and threatening to swallow up communities. In the province of Manitoba, in eastern Canada, a massive fire had charred more than 86,000 acres by Monday evening and was less than a mile away from the community of Cranberry Portage, local authorities said. More than 500 residents there had been evacuated, according to Manitoba officials. \u201cI\u2019ve been working in wildfires for 40 years, I\u2019ve never seen a fire move like this fire moved,\u201d Manitoba Wildfire Service Director Earl Simmons said in a Monday news conference. In Western Canada, the Parker Lake Fire in northeastern British Columbia more than tripled in size over the weekend to 13,000 acres and is now on the doorstep of the small community of Fort Nelson. The blaze was less than 1.5 miles west of the town Monday morning, and gusty winds are expected to linger in the coming days and could bring the flames even closer. \u201cThe next 48 hours will be a challenging situation,\u201d said Bowinn Ma, BC minister of emergency management and climate readiness. \u201cWe may begin to see volatile wildfire activity later this afternoon.\u201d As of Monday morning, roughly 4,700 people were under evacuation orders, including in the town of Fort Nelson and Fort Nelson First Nation, Ma said. People across 80 other properties were also asked to evacuate, the official added. Evacuation alerts are also in effect for parts of Alberta as\u00a0wildfire\u00a0MWF-017 burns about 10 miles southwest of the city of Fort McMurray \u2013 an area that was devastated by a wildfire in 2016. By Monday evening, that blaze had grown to more than 16,200 acres. An\u00a0evacuation alert\u00a0was issued for residents in Fort McMurray, Saprae Creek, Gregoire Lake Estates, Fort McMurray 468 First Nation and Anzac, according to Alberta officials. The blazes also prompted the Canadian National Railway Company to suspend services in some areas. \u201cCN has suspended service on our network between Fort St. John and Fort Nelson in British Columbia and north of High Level, Alberta due to wildfire activity,\u201d spokeswoman Ashley Michnowski told CNN. \u201cWe are working with impacted customers as our crews assess damages and identify any required repairs.\u201d Warming climate helps fire conditions Extremely dry conditions and winds gusting up to 25 mph are driving the fire Monday, but the seeds of fire activity were sown over the winter and in past years as the world continues to warm because of human-driven climate change. \u201cThis region has experienced multiple years of drought, with a below normal snowpack this past winter,\u201d said Ben Boghean, fire behavior specialist for the BC Wildfire Service. \u201cAs a result of this, our forests in the Fort Nelson zone are very receptive\u00a0to new fire ignitions and rapid rates of spread.\u201d Declining snow, increasing temperatures and worsening droughts are all hallmarks of climate change and are projected to keep driving larger and more intense fires across Canada, according to Environment Canada. Last year was Canada\u2019s most devastating fire season on record, including in British Columbia, where fires burned through hundreds of homes and an area the size of Maryland, according to the BC Wildfire Service. The Parker Lake Fire is not alone. There are more than 100 fires burning across Canada, 39 of which are considered out of control, according to the Canadian Interagency Fire Centre. Some of the blazes are so-called \u201choldover fires\u201d also known colloquially as \u201czombie fires,\u201d the smoldering remains of last season\u2019s epic blazes, burning deep in the ground throughout the winter and reigniting when exposed to warmer temperatures in the spring. \u201cIn the past, the winter conditions are what put out a lot of holdover fires,\u201d Ma said. \u201cIn this case, what we\u2019ve seen is that due to higher temperatures and persistent drought through the last year, many of these holdover fires were not put out like they normally are.\u201d Two \u201czombie\u201d fires, the Patry Creek Fire and the Nogah Creek wildfire, are growing rapidly to the north and east of Fort Nelson and contributing to the evacuation orders. Evacuation alerts are also in place for parts of Alberta as the MWF-017 wildfire burns out of control near Fort McMurray in the northeastern area of the province, officials said. The fire had burned about 16,000 acres as of Sunday morning. Hazardous smoke creeps into the US Smoke from the infernos has caused Environment Canada\u00a0to issue a special air quality statement extending from British Columbia to Saskatchewan. It has also caused smoke to waft down into the northern tier of the US for the first time this year, and for air quality alerts to be issued for Wisconsin, Minnesota and Iowa. Air quality reached \u201cunhealthy\u201d levels in all three states Monday, including Minneapolis-St. Paul, according to AirNow.gov. On Monday afternoon, the Twin Cities had the eighth-worst air quality of 119 major cities tracked by IQAIR, a company tracking air quality worldwide. Particulate matter levels this high can cause issues for sensitive groups or anyone spending prolonged time outdoors, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. Wildfire smoke has been linked to increases in certain cancers and heart-related issues, among other ailments. Just last year, smoke from Canadian\u00a0wildfires made its way to parts of the United States and caused dangerous air conditions across the country. In 2023, 19 counties in 11 states had days with \u201cvery unhealthy\u201d and \u201chazardous\u201d air quality \u2014 given at least a \u201ccode purple\u201d alert on the US Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s Air Quality Index. Poor air quality conditions are expected to linger in the US through Monday, and likely longer in parts of Canada closer to the fires, including Alberta and British Columbia.  Canadian officials warned those at higher risk of experiencing health effects from\u00a0wildfire\u00a0smoke include people with lung disease such as asthma, people with heart disease, along with older adults, children, those who are pregnant and people who work outdoors. They also recommended those who spend time outdoors wear a mask to help reduce exposure to fine particles of smoke.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/12/us/wildfire-smoke-from-british-columbia-causing-dangerous-air-quality/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "us"}}

Dr. Larry Robinson told the university\u2019s board of trustees at a special meeting, \u201cI wanted it to be real and ignored some warning signs along the way.\u201d Robinson said he recommended last week that the university should cease engagement with the donor,\u00a0Batterson Farms Corp.

A\u00a0report\u00a0from Politico noted Batterson Farms is a comparatively small company, and its private shares are unlikely to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars. In 2020, a notable deal involving a donor later identified as Gerami fell apart. South Carolina\u2019s Coastal Carolina University had announced a $95 million donation from an anonymous donor, who then backed out months later.

Dr. Shawnta Friday-Stroud, one of the signatories on an agreement between the university and Gerami accepting the gift, has since resigned as vice president of university advancement, according to Robinson. Friday-Stroud will continue with the university as dean of the School of Business and Industry. \u201cI fully support your decision to cease this transaction.

{"id": "2024_05_15_politics_desantis-bill-climate-change-florida", "text": "As Florida copes with rising seas and record temperatures, lawmakers are going to exceptional lengths to delete many mentions of climate change from state laws in a new bill that Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis signed into law on Wednesday, according to his official X account. The wide-ranging law makes several changes to the state\u2019s energy policy \u2013 in some cases deleting entire sections of state law that talk about the importance of cutting planet-warming pollution. The bill would also give preferential treatment to natural gas and ban offshore wind energy, even though there are no wind farms planned off Florida\u2019s coast. The bill deletes the phrase \u2018climate\u2019 eight times \u2013 often in reference to reducing the impacts of global climate change through its energy policy or directing state agencies to buy \u2018climate friendly\u2019 products when they are cost-effective and available. The bill also gets rid of a requirement that state-purchased vehicles should be fuel efficient. \u201cFlorida rejects the designs of the left to weaken our energy grid, pursue a radical climate agenda, and promote foreign adversaries,\u201d DeSantis said in a post on X, posting a graphic that said the law would protect the state from \u201cgreen zealots.\u201d \u201cWhat Florida is really doing is saying we\u2019re going to deemphasize any policies that would help mitigate climate change,\u201d said Emily Hammond, a professor of law at George Washington University. It\u2019s certainly not the first time Republican politicians have deleted the phrase \u2018climate change\u2019 \u2013 erasing the phrase from government websites was a commonplace activity during the Trump administration. But experts said few other states have passed bills to move away from clean energy and erase climate mentions from their laws. \u201cIt goes further than any other state has gone in repealing its existing climate laws,\u201d Michael Gerrard, founder of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University, told CNN. Last year was the hottest year on record for Florida, breaking yet another heat record in the state. South Florida in particular observed scorching heat index temperatures that reached as high as 113 degrees Fahrenheit. Sea levels have risen as much as eight inches higher than they were in 1950, already leading to increased flooding from storms and tides alike. \u201cFlorida is one of the most vulnerable states in the country,\u201d Gerrard said. \u201cAll of South Florida is at great peril from sea level rise. They should be the last state to stand in the way of fighting climate change.\u201d Even as Florida politicians are erasing mentions of climate change from their laws, they are also increasingly focused on helping a storm and flood-prone state withstand climate impacts. DeSantis and state lawmakers have poured over $1.1 billion into increasing community resilience to flooding and storms, according to a 2023 news release from the governor\u2019s office. In 2019, DeSantis appointed the state\u2019s first chief resilience officer Julia Nesheiwat \u2013 who explicitly referenced climate change and sea level rise as a \u201csignificant challenge\u201d to the state. (Nesheiwat has since left her post and replaced by the state\u2019s current chief resilience officer Wesley Brooks). Florida has also accepted millions of dollars in federal funding to help reconstruct a state highway in Miami Beach \u2013 elevating the pavement and installing new pump stations to help clear the road of water during flooding events. When it comes to other federal climate and clean energy funding, however, the state hasn\u2019t been eager to accept. DeSantis vetoed over $29 million dollars in federal energy rebates and energy efficiency grants from the Inflation Reduction Act and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. Florida was one of five states that declined to compete for $4.6 billion in federal climate grants, although numerous Florida metropolitan areas including Jacksonville, Miami, Fort Lauderdale, and Tampa have raised their hands for the funding instead. Hammond and Gerrard said this approach from Florida politicians to fund programs dealing with climate impacts without acknowledging its root cause isn\u2019t surprising. Hammond called focusing on adapting to climate change and hardening infrastructure without attribute it to a warming planet \u201cconsistent to the conservative approach.\u201d \u201cThey don\u2019t want to acknowledge that climate change is happening; they acknowledge they have flooding,\u201d Gerrard said. \u201cIf it\u2019s about moving away from fossil fuels, they don\u2019t like it.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/politics/desantis-bill-climate-change-florida/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "us"}}

The teen has been charged with \u201cterrorizing\u201d and two counts of possession of a firearm by a juvenile, police said. The teen was \u201csuspiciously dressed and armed\u201d when he entered the church\u2019s vestibule and was stopped by parishioners from entering further after a woman noticed the teen had a handgun on his hip, Rev. Louis J. Richard said in the Monday statement. Richard said the teen claimed \u201cthat he had learned there was a disturbed person who was planning to come to this Mass to attack a priest\u201d and he \u201chad come to stop this attacker.\u201d CNN has inquired with authorities about the claim. The potentially dangerous encounter comes just a week after a man walked into a Pennsylvania church service, pointed a gun at the pastor and pulled the trigger. The pastor was spared injury when the gun jammed, and the man was restrained until police arrived and placed him under arrest. In Louisiana, video of the church service streamed online shows associate pastor\u00a0Father Nicholas DuPr\u00e9 leading Mass when someone approached the altar and interrupted him mid-prayer to\u00a0whisper in his ear. Some parishioners in the front pews\u00a0appeared\u00a0concerned and turned around to look\u00a0toward the back of the church, the video shows. DuPr\u00e9\u00a0asked the congregation to sit and join him in repeating the Hail Mary prayer several times as a group of male parishioners moved along the center and front aisles of the church, frequently glancing toward the back of the room, the video shows. Once the suspect was apprehended, \u201claw enforcement entered the church to make sure there was no additional danger,\u201d the church\u2019s message said. \u201cThis understandably caused panic.\u201d The video shows parishioners began to get out of their seats, and the priest, still praying, could no longer be heard over the sound of the crowd. An armed law enforcement officer in a bulletproof vest entered the back of the sanctuary as the priest and deacon ducked behind the altar.\u00a0Altar\u00a0boys ran across the sanctuary one after the other. As panic began to take hold of the crowd, someone announced over a PA system, \u201cJust get a hold of your child.\u00a0Go slowly. We did apprehend a young man. He\u2019s in custody. \u2026 Calm down and just get next to your child and go slowly.\u201d \u201cWhile we realize this was a frightening experience for those in attendance, we are incredibly grateful to both parishioners and police officers for acting quickly to ensure the safety of all,\u201d the church statement said. The church said it will have uniformed officers at all upcoming Masses \u201cout of an abundance of cautious,\u201d the statement said. Abbeville Police Chief Mike Hardy extended thanks to the clergy and parishioners \u201cfor their quick response and remaining calm\u201d throughout the ordeal. The church said investigators are receiving assistance from the FBI. CNN has sought more information from police and the FBI. CNN also reached out to\u00a0St. Mary Magdalen\u00a0Church for more information. A\u00a0prayer was posted\u00a0on the church\u2019s Facebook page early Sunday morning. \u201cHoly Spirit, comforter of hearts, heal your people\u2019s wounds and transform brokenness into wholeness,\u201d\u00a0the\u00a0post\u00a0said. \u201cGrant us courage and wisdom, humility and grace, to act with justice. Breathe wisdom into our prayers.\u00a0 Grant that all harmed by the threat of violence may find peace in justice.\u201d St. Mary Magdalen\u00a0Parish\u00a0was established in 1842, according to the\u00a0congregation\u2019s history, and the church, along with its rectory and cemetery, is listed on the\u00a0National Register of Historic Places.

Bryan Maclean Howard, 41, faces eight charges of DUI manslaughter stemming from Tuesday\u2019s fatal crash, in which authorities said the 2001 Ford Ranger he was driving traveled toward the center line along Highway 40 west of Ocala and struck a bus carrying more than 50 farm workers. The bus left the roadway, went through a fence and overturned, according to the Florida Highway Patrol. In addition to the eight dead, at least 40 people were injured. Howard pleaded not guilty on Wednesday, online records show. He has been denied bond. CNN has reached out to the public defender\u2019s office for comment. The six\u00a0victims identified\u00a0in\u00a0the arrest\u00a0report were Evarado Ventura Hern\u00e1ndez, 30; Cristian Salazar Villeda, 24; Alfredo Tovar S\u00e1nchez, 20; Isa\u00edas Miranda Pascal, 21; Jos\u00e9 Heriberto Fraga Acosta, 27, and Manuel Perez R\u00edos, 46.

Dell, who sustained a minor wound, was caught in the middle of the shooting in Sanford and had no connection to the gunman, Seminole County Sheriff Dennis Lemma said at a news conference Monday afternoon. Sanford is about 20 miles north of Orlando. A judge moved the suspect, Christopher Bouie Jr., from juvenile to adult circuit court on Monday, according to a news release from the Office of the State Attorney for the 18th\u00a0Judicial Circuit. Bouie is charged with five counts of attempted second-degree murder while discharging a firearm and one count of possession of a firearm by a minor in connection with the shooting, court records show. Lemma said nine of the 10 people who were shot have been released from the hospital with minor wounds. The last victim should be released soon, he said. Investigators believe the juvenile pulled out a 9mm handgun following a physical altercation and began firing, according to the sheriff. The search continues for a second person who may have fired in self-defense, Lemma said. \u201cSo what we have is two people engaged in gunfire on the left and right side of the physical altercation that is going on,\u201d he said. The state attorney said Tuesday an investigation into additional shots fired by another patron of the club is \u201cactive and ongoing.\u201d Bouie was transferred to the Seminole County Jail and will be held without bond, the release said. His first appearance in Seminole County Court is scheduled for Tuesday afternoon, according to court records. CNN has reached out to Bouie\u2019s attorney for comment. Lemma said the actions of a security guard who tackled the suspect to the ground and turned him in to\u00a0police \u201ctook a very dangerous situation and made it less significant than what the potential could have been.\u201d About 200 people were at the event, including Dell, who was invited by promoters. It was being held at Cabana Live, which is open to the public as a restaurant and bar. The venue also is leased out for private events and parties, the sheriff said. Promoters had 10 armed security members on site. The sheriff said he does not know how the suspect made it into the party, and the investigation is ongoing. He added the gun recovered was legally purchased\u00a0in Miami in 2018, but does not know how the teen allegedly obtained it.

The flare \u2013 deemed an X8.7, with the X-class denoting the most intense flares possible \u2013 came from the same region that triggered the geomagnetic storm and stunning display of auroras, or Northern Lights, around the world. That storm was the most extreme geomagnetic storm since 2003, the center said. \u201cA flare is an eruption of energy from the Sun that generally lasts minutes to hours. Flares of this magnitude are not frequent,\u201d the center noted. Tuesday\u2019s intense flash of ultraviolet light was photographed by NASA\u2019s Solar Dynamics Observatory, which said the flare peaked at 12:51 p.m. ET. Solar flares usually take place in active regions of the Sun that include the presence of strong magnetic fields. They\u00a0can impact radio, power grids and communications. Users of\u00a0high frequency radio signals may experience temporary or complete loss of signal. However, due to the Sun\u2019s rotation, the sun spot in question is no longer directing this energy in the Earth\u2019s direction, which will minimize impacts. Flares can also pose threats to astronauts and spacecraft \u2013 though NASA found there was no risk to astronauts aboard the International Space Station last week.

{"id": "2024_05_12_us_win-rozario-nypd-killing", "text": "\u201cPlease don\u2019t shoot,\u201d Notan Eva Costa, a 48-year-old Bangladeshi immigrant living in Queens, begged the two New York City police officers who entered her home after her teenage son called 911. Lying on the floor, the mother of two stretched her hand out to the officers, terror and distress audible in her voice. It was too late. One of the police officers fired his gun at least four times, fatally wounding 19-year-old Win Rozario. Less than two minutes had passed since police entered the family\u2019s home. The officers \u201ckilled my son in minutes,\u201d Costa said through an interpreter at a Wednesday news conference. \u201cBefore they came, everything was calm. Then they came and created chaos and murdered him in front of me.\u201d In the weeks since Rozario\u2019s death, the shooting has attracted scrutiny from social justice and mental health advocates, particularly after the state attorney general\u2019s office released footage from body cameras worn by the two responding officers and announced it is investigating the case. Critics say the police\u2019s use of lethal force was unnecessary and reflects a pattern of violence against people with mental illness. In a news release, the NYPD said it is \u201cfully cooperating\u201d with the investigation as well as conducting its own probe, adding, \u201cWe continually seek to improve how we respond to requests for assistance, and we acknowledge that there is much work to be done. New Yorkers expect and deserve nothing less.\u201d The two officers are on \u201cmodified assignment,\u201d meaning they\u2019re still working but not carrying firearms or shields. Rozario\u2019s family, as well as local organizations like the Justice Committee and Desis Rising Up and Moving, have called for the officers to be fired and prosecuted. They also have goals far beyond penalizing the officers who killed Rozario. They\u2019re calling for New York City to radically shift its approach to responding to people in crisis. Rather than sending armed police officers to respond to every 911 call, they envision a world where trained mental health responders could respond to people experiencing crises, helping to deescalate tense situations and connect patients with health care. Mental health crisis intervention programs have already been implemented in cities like Eugene, Oregon, and Denver, Colorado, as well as across 23 counties in South Dakota and elsewhere across the country. In New York, a similar but limited pilot program called \u201cB-Heard\u201d dispatches EMTs and trained mental health responders to some emergency calls. Speaking through a translator in front of dozens of supporters holding images of Rozario, his mother described her son as a \u201cquiet and polite\u201d teenager who dreamed of one day joining the military \u201cbecause he wanted to do something for this country.\u201d He loved to cook for his mother and help her with her beading handicrafts, she recalled. \u201cThat is who the police stole from us,\u201d she said, tearing up at times as she described her son. \u201cI tried to protect my son. I begged the police not to shoot, but the police still killed him.\u201d \u201cWin Rozario would be alive today if the NYPD had already been removed from mental health,\u201d said Loyda Col\u00f3n, executive director of the Justice Committee, at a Wednesday news conference. 2 minutes, 4 gunshots, and a young life cut short Rozario was in the throes of an apparent mental health crisis when he called 911 on March 27. \u201cHe\u2019s having an episode,\u201d his younger brother, Utsho, told the two police officers who arrived. \u201cHe don\u2019t even know what he\u2019s doing, to be honest.\u201d In the apartment, the officers found Rozario standing in the kitchen with his mother nearby. When an officer moved toward the kitchen, Rozario seemed to become distressed and picked up a pair of kitchen scissors, which his mother tried to take from his hand. Rozario moved toward the officers again with the scissors, prompting one officer to fire a taser at him and the other to draw his gun. Rozario\u2019s mother clutched him as an officer shouted, \u201clet go of him and back up,\u201d and appeared to fire a taser again at the teenager, who collapsed to the floor. Rozario\u2019s mother then moved away from him and toward officers, holding the scissors. She walked back to Rozario, seemingly trying to comfort him, prompting an officer to yell, \u201cTell her to get the f**k out of the way!\u201d  \u201cDon\u2019t shoot,\u201d she said to the officers. An officer again fired a taser at Rozario, who grabbed the scissors and again moved toward the officers. Utsho moved in and all three family members held each other as the officers continued to shout for them to get out of the way. Rozario\u2019s mother and brother both fell to the floor. Rozario was standing and holding the scissors, seemingly several feet away from the officers, when one officer appeared to begin shooting at him. He fell to the floor after multiple shots. Col\u00f3n said the footage shows the responding officers \u201crecklessly escalated the situation multiple times,\u201d endangering Rozario\u2019s mother and brother as well. \u201cThey had multiple opportunities to de-escalate, to detain, and they did not do that,\u201d Col\u00f3n said. Officers shouted \u201cput it down\u201d multiple times at Rozario but did not otherwise talk to him during the body camera footage. \u201cThere was no danger happening at all, until those officers arrived with their guns,\u201d the family\u2019s attorney said at the news conference. Michael Alcazar, a retired NYPD detective and adjunct professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, told CNN he saw multiple ways the officers could have possibly avoided shooting Rozario. Before entering the home or when Rozario\u2019s mother took the scissors from him, they could have asked his mother and brother to leave the apartment, leaving just Rozario inside, and then called emergency services. This is consistent with the \u201cisolate and contain\u201d protocol NYPD advises officers to use when dealing with \u201cmentally ill or emotionally disturbed persons.\u201d Additionally, the officers could have used nonlethal weapons, like nightsticks, to gain control of Rozario and take the scissors away, according to Alcazar. Another vision for crisis intervention Rozario wasn\u2019t the first New Yorker to die at the hands of police while experiencing a mental health crisis. Community Access, a non-profit supporting people with mental health concerns in New York, says at least 26 New Yorkers experiencing mental health crises have been shot and killed by police since 2007. Situations involving \u201cemotionally disturbed persons\u201d are the second most common situation in which police officers use force, according to the NYPD\u2019s 2022 use of force report. Officers used force in 1,740 encounters with emotionally disturbed persons in 2022, the report showed. The report does not include data on lethal force used against emotionally disturbed persons. The NYPD told CNN they respond to approximately 155,000 \u201cemergency calls involving people in the throes of an emotional or mental health crisis\u201d each year. Fewer than 1% of those calls result in police using any form of force and fewer involve deadly force, the NYPD reports. Although they are uncommon, deaths like those of Rozario, Kawaski Trawick, Deborah Danner, and Mohamed Bah have drawn scrutiny to the dangers of using police to respond to people experiencing acute crisis, and what an alternative system of support might look like. In Eugene and Springfield, Oregon, for instance, specialized crisis responders and medics have responded to crisis calls for more than 30 years through a mobile intervention program called CAHOOTS, an acronym for \u201cCrisis Assistance Helping Out On The Streets.\u201d The program diverts between 3% and 8% of calls which would otherwise be handled by police, according to the Eugene Police Department, including providing care for people who are \u201cintoxicated, mentally ill, or disoriented.\u201d Jeremy Gates, the executive director of the White Bird Clinic, which runs CAHOOTS, told CNN part of the program\u2019s success lies in the trust its responders have built with clients over the years. \u201cPeople will call and say, I don\u2019t want the police, I want CAHOOTS,\u201d he said. And in Colorado, one former deputy was convicted of reckless endangerment, another pleaded guilty to two misdemeanors and six other officers are currently facing charges for shooting and killing a man experiencing a mental health crisis, a similar program called Support Team Assisted Response, known as STAR, operates in Denver. \u201cWe respond in a trauma-informed and empathetic manner,\u201d STAR Program Specialist Evan Thompkins told CNN in an interview. \u201cWe come in a kind and caring way, where we can kind of meet people where they\u2019re at, really get down on their level and provide more of a non-authoritarian approach.\u201d He noted for some people and communities, just the presence of uniformed police members can cause a situation to \u201cescalate.\u201d Some \u201ccommunities are afraid of the police and don\u2019t want to interact with the police,\u201d he said. Fountain House, a non-profit providing support for people living with serious mental illness in New York, has also highlighted Rozario\u2019s death to call for a vast expansion of the city\u2019s mental health intervention programs. Mental illness is primarily \u201ca public health issue, not a public safety issue,\u201d Arvind Sooknanan, a member of the board of directors at Fountain House, told CNN. The organization has laid out a plan for New York to \u201cmove as many mental health crisis calls as possible out of the 911 system\u201d and integrate the existing 988 mental health hotline \u201cwith the social service system to help people address root cause stressors.\u201d For Sooknanan, Rozario\u2019s case hits particularly close to home: Sooknanan has been living with serious mental illness since he was 15 and also comes from a South Asian background, like Rozario. The case \u201chas eaten away at me the past few weeks,\u201d he said. \u201cHe was only 19 years old. There was no reason for him to die.\u201d \u201cI want other people to have the same opportunities I did, to move forward with their lives, to find meaning, to find community,\u201d said Sooknanan, who is also working to help develop crisis intervention programs in other states. Ken Zimmerman, Fountain House\u2019s CEO, told CNN he envisions a future in which \u201cthe knowledge and awareness of what serious mental health conditions are is so much more widespread, that the kind of stigma and fear that drives so much is hugely diminished.\u201d Additionally, he emphasized the importance of expanding the city\u2019s resources and infrastructure for mental health care \u2013 a process that might take years. And those resources and planning need to take into account the lived experience of people living with serious mental illnesses themselves, he said. For the Rozario family, the fight to provide an alternative to police response for people in mental health crisis is powered by a dream that no other family should have to experience the anguish they\u2019ve felt. \u201cNo mother should have to go through the pain I\u2019m going through,\u201d Rozario\u2019s mother said. \u201cI hope no other mothers go through this in the future.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/12/us/win-rozario-nypd-killing/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_05_15_economy_consumer-price-index-inflation-april", "text": "All three major indexes surged to record highs Wednesday after new data showed that inflation cooled in April after ticking up recently.  The S&P 500, tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite and blue-chip Dow all closed at new record highs after the latest Consumer Price Index showed that prices were up 3.4% for the 12 months ended in April, easing from 3.5% the month before. The broad-market S&P 500 gained more than 1.2% on Wednesday and cracked the 5,300-level for the first time, closing at 5,308.15. The Nasdaq was about 1.4% higher, setting a new record at 16,742.39. The Dow, meanwhile, was up 350 points or 0.9% and teetered near the key 40,000-level, closing at 39,908. All three major indexes are tracking toward a winning week. Investors believe that the cooler inflation reading, coupled with a separate report showing weak retail sales in April, increases the likelihood that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates this year. \u201cTaken [together with retail sales] this supports a Fed rate cut in the fall,\u201d Gary Pzegeo, head of fixed income at CIBC Private Wealth US, wrote in a note to clients Wednesday. \u201cMarkets are discounting a cut in September and have moved to price in a second cut by December.\u201d Wednesday\u2019s report landed mostly in line with economists\u2019 expectations, which is a welcome turnabout from January, February and March, when CPI (and other inflation gauges) came in hot, hot, and hot. \u201cThis was a good report in the context of three hotter-than-expected [CPI] reports, and it makes it look like potentially those were bumps in the road rather than a really stagnant inflation environment,\u201d Tyler Schipper, economics professor at the University of St. Thomas in Minnesota, told CNN in an interview. On a monthly basis, prices rose 0.3%, a slower pace of growth than the 0.4% seen in the two months prior, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 CPI report. Economists were expecting a 0.4% monthly increase and an annual gain of 3.4%, according to FactSet consensus estimates. Rising gasoline and shelter costs accounted for more than 70% of the monthly increase in overall inflation, according to the report. While elevated housing costs and high prices at the pump continue to weigh on Americans, Wednesday\u2019s report did provide some welcome news on another staple spending area: Grocery prices fell for the first time in a year, dropping 0.2% from March. A closely watched underlying measurement of inflation showed even more progress. Core CPI, which strips out the more volatile categories of energy and food, slowed from 3.8% to 3.6%, its lowest rate since April 2021. From the month before, core CPI ticked up by 0.3%, its slowest pace since the end of last year. Prices are cooling but some pain points remain In addition to grocery prices falling for the month, overall food prices and the cost of going out to eat saw some easing as well. Food price inflation held pat at 2.2% annually, while food away from home inflation ticked down to 4.1%, its lowest rate since May 2021. New and used car prices continued to fall from record heights; but, especially in this period of high interest rates, they remain costly endeavors \u2014 not only to purchase but also to maintain. Motor vehicle insurance continued its painful rise in April, climbing 1.8% for the month and rising to 22.6% annually. Repair and maintenance costs were flat for the month but are still running well above overall inflation at 7.6% annually. Apparel prices jumped higher for the month, with some categories such as men\u2019s shirts and women\u2019s suits up nearly 3%. For those to leap higher at a time when goods prices are seeing disinflation (in some cases, outright deflation), could be a reflection of broader trade problems globally and a potential issue for consumers \u2014 and incumbents \u2014 later this year, Schipper said. \u201cIt might not be particularly problematic now; but if you think about the fall, when it\u2019s election season, and people are doing back-to-school shopping, that could be a category that becomes politically problematic,\u201d Schipper said. A slow drift downward However, April\u2019s report did show some slight progress on what\u2019s been the biggest Achilles heel: Shelter inflation eased to 5.5%, its lowest annual rate since May 2022. Housing costs \u201chave been a pretty persistent area of pain over the past several years,\u201d John Sedunov, professor of finance and real estate at Villanova University, told CNN. The housing component of the CPI has proved frustrating for economists and other observers because the government\u2019s measurement of shelter costs come with a considerable lag. Private sector sources of real estate data have shown a cooling rental market. When taking those housing costs out of the equation, a closely watched \u201csupercore\u201d index measuring services inflation that excludes shelter costs rose just 0.2% for the month, its slowest pace since last summer. The Federal Reserve has been wanting to see meaningful process on inflation before it starts trimming back interest rates. Those rates are at a 23-year high following an aggressive, yearslong rate-hiking campaign by the central bank to throw water on smoldering demand and tame decades-high inflation. \u201cThe last month or two had looked like maybe the improvement was stalling, and this [report] looks like it\u2019s continuing at a slow pace,\u201d Erica Groshen, a former BLS commissioner who serves as senior economics adviser at the Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations, told CNN. Inflation has cooled considerably after spiking to 9.1% annually in June 2022, and the economy has remained resilient in the process \u2014 although there are signals that the once-rampant pace of spending activity has cooled.

{"id": "2024_05_12_us_general-william-sherman-civil-war-auction", "text": "At first,\u00a0it was the rare binding that caught the eye of Danielle Linn, a senior book specialist with Fleischer\u2019s Auctions. While cataloging items once owned by the Union Army General, William Tecumseh Sherman, she came across a copy of a memoir written by Ulysses S. Grant. The book had been made with rare \u201ctree calf\u201d binding \u2013 leather chemically treated to create the likeness of a tree on the cover. Linn set it aside, but later picked it up to check the publication date. The specialist opened the back cover accidentally, she said, and that\u2019s where she found Sherman\u2019s handwriting. Not only was it a first edition of the 1885 memoir, it was full of Sherman\u2019s personal notes and recollections. The Civil War general, who would go down in history for his \u201cMarch to the Sea,\u201d became close friends with the future President Grant during the war, writing,\u00a0\u201cFrom the day I reported to him from Paducah till his death our relations were as brothers rather than as commander and commanded.\u201d The historical find is significant because it contains Sherman\u2019s annotations, including a recollection of his first meeting with President Abraham Lincoln, in a book that\u2019s considered one of the finest memoirs by a president or general. Born in Lancaster, Ohio, Sherman played a key role in the Civil War. His\u00a0\u201chard war\u201d military strategy for the Union\u00a0included the destruction of infrastructure and some personal property through the South in his famous march. Sherman is also known for his Special Field Order 15, often referred to as \u201c40 acres and a mule\u201d \u2013 an initial attempt at reparations for newly freed slaves. But the auction, which will take place on Tuesday, isn\u2019t without controversy. One official at a museum dedicated to the Sherman family worries the items will land in private hands, and out of the view of the public. Nonetheless, the find has been personally satisfying to Linn, who, upon her discovery, shouted for the auction house\u2019s founder, Adam Fleischer. He, too, was surprised. \u201cThis is probably the most important offering of Civil War antiques that have been sold in recent memory,\u201d Fleischer said, noting the major general was \u201cone of the most significant figures of the Civil War in American history.\u201d Fleischer and Linn also found more notes, ranging from corrections to Sherman\u2019s own opinions on\u00a0events in other books. \u201cBeing able to open up these books and seeing that he had inscribed and signed his name on so many of them was a real moment of discovery,\u201d Linn told CNN. The collection belonging to Sherman\u2019s descendants, which has never been offered for sale before, was valuable even before Linn\u2019s accidental discovery. It includes the general\u2019s wartime sword, the rank insignia from his uniform during the war and his family Bible. Sherman\u2019s descendants said they are offering the relics \u201cwith great pride and anticipation.\u201d \u201cWe are confident they will be cherished and preserved by new custodians, who will continue to honor the remarkable contributions of General William Tecumseh Sherman for years to come,\u201d they said in a statement. Fleischer said he\u2019s already seen a great deal of enthusiasm from museums and institutions, and the auction house estimates the entire collection could sell for over $100,000 \u2013 or a great deal more. Online bidding has begun, and the sword alone has an estimate of between $40,000 and $60,000. The\u00a0Sherman House Museum in Lancaster, Ohio, is watching the auction closely. In a March 21 statement, the museum\u2019s director, Michael Johnson, said winning bids by private collectors might mean the items would no longer be available for public view. \u201cThe thought of these amazing pieces of history being stored away in a collector\u2019s basement is disheartening,\u201d the statement read. Johnson told CNN many people have said they\u2019re hoping the museum will get a hold of the items.\u00a0In an effort to do so, the museum began accepting pledges and over the past month, they\u2019ve raised around $90,000, Johnson said. \u201cAs the only museum in the country dedicated to the Sherman family, we would love to see as many of these as possible displayed in our museum,\u201d he said. If the museum isn\u2019t able to acquire the relics, Johnson said he hopes a private buyer would be willing to loan the items to the museum \u2013 especially Sherman\u2019s sword. After some criticism from private collectors, Johnson apologized for the initial statement, noting, \u201cWe have had amazing collectors in the museum presenting their items for our round tables and I greatly appreciate their efforts.\u201d Fleischer said the auction house \u201ccan\u2019t give any preference to private or public buyers, but we hope that everything will go in the hands of responsible custodians.\u201d Still flush from the historical find, Fleisher and Lin are expecting a large crowd for the auction. \u201cI don\u2019t know if there\u2019s anything quite so significant in my career,\u201d Linn said. \u201cIt was a real privilege to feel like a detective finding these clues and opening up and finding an American treasure.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/12/us/general-william-sherman-civil-war-auction/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "us"}}

Harvard\u00a0has agreed to hold reinstatement proceedings \u201cfor the over 20 students and student workers suspended by the University for their alleged participation in the encampment,\u201d the group said. For 60 students and student workers facing disciplinary procedures, the university has agreed to expedite their cases \u201cin line with precedents of leniency for similar actions in the past,\u201d according to\u00a0Harvard\u00a0Out of Occupied Palestine (HOOP), the organization behind the encampment. The agreement \u2013 which the Harvard Jewish Alumni Alliance described as an example of \u201cmis-governance\u201d by the university \u2013 comes as college officials around the country have called in law enforcement to clear pro-Palestinian encampments and quell demonstrations in recent weeks. Alan Garber, Harvard\u2019s interim president, in a message to the university community, said he has asked schools to \u201cpromptly initiate applicable reinstatement proceedings for all individuals who have been placed on involuntary leaves of absence.\u201d Garber did not say how many students were involved. Garber also said he has asked the \u201cdisciplinary boards within each School to evaluate expeditiously, according to their existing practices and precedents, the cases of those who participated in the encampment.\u201d Garber \u201cwill ask the schools to adjudicate disciplinary matters promptly,\u201d according to a university spokesperson, adding that he will also request that reinstatement requests be processed expeditiously. Harvard University has 12 graduate and professional schools, the undergraduate Harvard College, and the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study. HOOP said the university will meet with the protesters \u201cto begin discussions on disclosure, divestment, and reinvestment.\u201d\u00a0Harvard\u00a0will also engage in conversations about creating a \u201cCenter for Palestine Studies at\u00a0Harvard,\u201d the group said. Garber said he will \u201cfacilitate a meeting with the chair of the Corporation Committee on Shareholder Responsibility and other University officials to address questions about the endowment.\u201d The Harvard Crimson reported May 6 that Garber has repeatedly stated that the endowment will not be used as a tool for political means. The university has also repeatedly stated its position resisting calls for divestment. The university president and the dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences will also meet with students \u201cto hear their perspectives on academic matters related to longstanding conflicts in the Middle East,\u201d according to Garber\u2019s message. \u201cI acknowledge the profound grief that many in our community feel over the tragic effects of the ongoing war,\u201d Garber said. \u201cThere will continue to be deep disagreements and strongly felt emotions as we experience pain and distress over events in the wider world.\u201d The encampment at the Cambridge,\u00a0Massachusetts, campus lasted 20 days, according to the group. Harvard began placing students connected to the encampment on \u201cinvoluntary\u201d leaves of absence, the Harvard Crimson\u00a0reported\u00a0Friday, citing an Instagram post\u00a0from HOOP. The move came after protesters\u00a0rejected an offer\u00a0from Garber to avoid being placed on leave in exchange for taking down the encampment. The Harvard Jewish Alumni Alliance, in a message to members, described the agreement as \u201cgross mis-governance\u201d that \u201cundermines the stated mission\u201d of the university. The group accused the interim president of \u201cgiving preferential treatment to students, faculty and staff whose conduct not only targeted Jews but also disrupted and imperiled the wider Harvard community.\u201d The alumni alliance urged members to withhold donations to Harvard, and join a campaign to \u201cdonate one dollar, and no more, to the University for the foreseeable future \u2014 not in anger, but in sadness and in hope.\u201d The Ivy League school has experienced a period of historic turmoil in recent months.

Coined \u201cOperation Dissertation Before Baby,\u201d the plan included Brevard-Rodriguez completing her dissertation and having her baby in time to celebrate graduation and the summer with family. In that order. Brevard-Rodriguez\u2019s dissertation presentation \u2013 for her doctorate at Rutgers Graduate School of Education \u2013 focused on the beauty pressures placed on Black college women while enrolled at predominantly White educational institutions. But while she was in the middle of fine-tuning the dissertation early on March 25, things went decidedly off-plan. After working for a few hours and lying down to get some rest, Brevard-Rodriguez\u2019s water broke. While this was a happy moment, she was scheduled to deliver her dissertation that very day. Tamiah\u2019s wife, Alyza Brevard-Rodriguez, tried to calm her. \u201cI\u2019ve witnessed her work so hard, tirelessly working on the presentation, a six-year program, a two-year study.\u00a0I\u2019m just like, \u2018don\u2019t let today be the day,\u2019\u201d Alyza told CNN. \u201cI walk into the bathroom and I look at her and she is just shaking in tears. As much as I knew that this was a happy moment for the both of us, I can see the sadness on her that you know her day was possibly going to be ruined.\u201d They were planning to go to a birthing center, but their doula told them to get to the hospital quickly. Alyza helped Tamiah to the car and they sped down the highway in the dark, in what Alyza called a \u201crace to the finish line.\u201d When Tamiah started to go into labor, Alyza worried they wouldn\u2019t make it to the hospital in time for the baby\u2019s birth. They didn\u2019t. Tamiah had given birth in the car. \u201cWhen I looked over, she had the baby in her left hand and the umbilical cord in her right,\u201d Alyza said. They got to the hospital with baby Enzo. Doctors and nurses checked him out and cut his umbilical cord, joking that Tamiah \u201cdid all the hard work for us.\u201d Now was the time to rest, but Tamiah still had a dissertation to present. Alyza discussed possibly rescheduling the meeting with Tamiah\u2019s mentor. However, Tamiah worried if they rescheduled, it wouldn\u2019t happen in the time frame needed to graduate this year. \u201cAs I was laying there, I was just thinking to myself, \u2018I can do it,\u2019\u201d Tamiah recalled.\u00a0\u201cThe baby\u2019s here. Let\u2019s just get this over with.\u201d And so she did. Alyza brought her clothes, laptop and a makeup bag. \u201cI took a nap, ate a meal and then I was ready to rock and roll,\u201d Tamiah said. As she logged onto her laptop from her hospital bed, the only person who knew about her delivery earlier that morning was her mentor.\u00a0He didn\u2019t want anyone to give her sympathy, so he kept quiet. For about twenty to thirty minutes, she gave a stellar presentation, Tamiah says. With the presentation over, she took down her Rutgers background on Zoom, revealing the hospital. \u201cEveryone was in complete shock,\u201d Tamiah said. Tamiah\u2019s graduation ceremony is this Sunday, on Mother\u2019s Day. She says she will celebrate with a dinner with family and friends. Alyza also finished her doctorate recently, and their daughter Aubriel is soon graduating from preschool. \u201cIt\u2019s incredible to uplift women and show how incredibly powerful they are,\u201d Alyza said. \u201cI hope that people really take away from this that women are strong and resilient, tenacious, ambitious grit and they can do anything.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/11/us/rutgers-phd-student-dissertation-birth/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_05_15_politics_supreme-court-louisiana-black-voters-congressional-district", "text": "The Supreme Court paused a chaotic legal fight over\u00a0Louisiana\u2019s congressional districts\u00a0in a brief order Wednesday that will likely allow the state to use a map in this year\u2019s election that creates a second majority-Black district and benefits Democrats. The court\u2019s three liberal justices publicly dissented from the decision. In the short term, the decision allows the state to move forward in this year\u2019s election with a map that will make a second of its six districts competitive for Democrats. That could have enormous consequences given the razor-thin majority Republicans have in the US House of Representatives. Louisiana state Sen. Cleo Fields, a Democrat and former member of Congress running in the new Black-majority district crafted by state lawmakers, said the high court\u2019s ruling \u201cwas the outcome that was needed for the state.\u201d \u201cThe people of Louisiana now know what their congressional lines look like,\u201d he told CNN. On that point, at least, Fields and other Democrats in the state were aligned with Republican officials and a group of Black voters who had asked for the court\u2019s intervention. In a statement, Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill, a Republican, said that she was grateful the Supreme Court ensured \u201da stable election season.\u201d Although Black residents make up roughly a third of Louisiana\u2019s population, the state currently has just one Black lawmaker \u2013 also the lone Democrat \u2013 in its current six-member US House delegation. But the decision may represent something of a pyrrhic\u00a0victory for voting rights groups who fear the court\u2019s justification for allowing the new map could have far-reaching consequences in future redistricting battles. The ruling will have an impact beyond the Louisiana district, which likely explains the vote count, said CNN Supreme Court analyst Steve Vladeck. \u201cThis ruling is a short-term win for Black voters in Louisiana, and, thus, Democrats, but a long-term expansion of a deeply controversial approach to how federal courts handle election-year voting cases \u2013 which is a big part of why the justices seem to all have ended up in unpredictable positions here,\u201d said Vladeck, a professor at the University of Texas School of Law. Purcell principle politics Louisiana officials specifically asked the Supreme Court last week to rely on a legal doctrine\u00a0known as the Purcell principle, which it sometimes invokes to stay out of last-minute election lawsuits. The majority cited Purcell in its brief order Wednesday but did not otherwise explain its reasoning. The Supreme Court has never defined what constitutes a \u201clast-minute\u201d election decision that should bar courts from weighing into such disputes. And the court\u2019s conservatives have faced blowback in recent years for applying that doctrine in a way critics see as inconsistent. Louisiana won\u2019t hold its congressional primary election until November. In a brief dissent, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson said it was premature for the Supreme Court to intervene in the case. She said that Purcell \u201chas no role to play here.\u201d \u201cRather than wading in now, I would have let the District Court\u2019s remedial process run its course before considering whether our emergency intervention was warranted,\u201d Jackson wrote. Jackson, in other words, would have waited for the lower courts or the state Legislature to draw a new map. \u201cOne of the biggest criticisms of Purcell is that it\u2019s deeply subjective with regard to how close to an election federal courts should stay their hand,\u201d Vladeck said. \u201cToday\u2019s ruling only compounds that critique, because it expressly applies it more than five months before an election without any explanation for why. That will make Purcell both broader and more malleable in lower courts going forward.\u201d Case watched for how Supreme Court looks at redistricting and gerrymandering The new district at issue in the case slashes diagonally from Shreveport in the northwest of the state to Baton Rouge in the southeast for some 250 miles to create a district where Black residents make up some 54% of the district\u2019s voters \u2013 up from about 24% under the old lines. The map lawmakers approved carved up the district of Rep. Garret Graves, a Republican who had endorsed Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry\u2019s opponent in last year\u2019s gubernatorial primary. The case has been watched closely by civil rights groups and election experts for its potential national impact. At its most basic level, the proposed map would give Democrats a chance to add a second member to their delegation. But the fight also implicates deeper and more long-standing controversies that could reach beyond the Bayou State, including how the Supreme Court handles similar redistricting cases and how state mapmakers are supposed to consider race as they eke as much political advantage as they can from the boundaries of each district they draw. Louisiana came to the Supreme Court caught between two lower court orders. One court said state lawmakers likely violated the Voting Rights Act by drawing only one majority-Black district out of six. A second court found the state\u2019s attempt to fix the problem with a second majority-Black district was unconstitutional because lawmakers relied on race in a way that violated the equal protection clause. The second map was challenged by a group of voters who have identified themselves in court as \u201cnon-African American,\u201d though the list of plaintiffs includes a number of prominent White Republicans. Those voters argued their \u201cpersonal dignity\u201d was injured because the new map with two majority-Black districts \u201cracially stigmatizes,\u201d \u201cracially stereotypes\u201d and \u201cracially maligns\u201d them. Caught in the middle was a group of Black voters who felt the new map, while imperfect, was at least better than the one used in the 2022 midterm elections that included only a single majority-Black district. Two years ago, the Supreme Court allowed that map to be used in the midterm even though a lower court said it was likely illegal. The Black voters and Republican Louisiana officials both urged the Supreme Court to step in and pause the lower court proceedings \u2013 arguing the state needed an answer on which map to use by today. But the White voters said there was plenty of time for the state legislature or the lower court to draw a new map. \u201cOur fight for a fair congressional map has carried on for years,\u201d\u00a0Michael McClanahan, president of the NAACP Louisiana State Conference, said in a statement Wednesday. \u201cToday, we celebrate our communities\u2019 opportunity to have a voice in this year\u2019s elections, that can lead to the representation we need to make positive change in the years ahead. This is a day for hope.\u201d The attorneys for the voters who challenged the map with the two Black-majority districts said they are confident they ultimately will prevail if the Supreme Court agrees to hear an appeal on the merits of the case. \u201cThe state of Louisiana enacted a brutal racial gerrymander that segregates its voters based on their race,\u201d Edward Greim and Paul Hurd said in a joint statement. \u201cAs a result, their constituents may well vote in November 2024 districts segregated by race.\u201d This story has been updated with additional details.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/politics/supreme-court-louisiana-black-voters-congressional-district/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_05_15_politics_nikki-haley-donor-retreat", "text": "More than two months after ending her presidential bid, Nikki Haley did not directly address the topic of Donald Trump\u00a0or her political future\u00a0during a two-day gathering of some of her key donors in Charleston, South Carolina,\u00a0this week.\u00a0Instead,\u00a0the former South Carolina governor\u00a0and her top political aides\u00a0answered\u00a0questions\u00a0about policy\u00a0from those donors and ran through the numbers of how her now-suspended 2024\u00a0campaign raised and spent its money. Since leaving the race, she has kept a relatively low profile, conspicuously refraining from endorsing Trump or encouraging her Republican supporters \u2013 who continue to show up to the primary polls, even with the former president set to win the nomination \u2013\u00a0to oppose him. The donor retreat was one of the biggest signals Haley has given since dropping out of the race that she hopes to keep some presence in national politics.\u00a0The former governor, according to multiple attendees, opted against weighing in on any of the larger questions concerning what comes next for her,\u00a0but she did discuss policy related questions and thank some of her top donors for fueling her campaign. The\u00a0retreat was described as similar to an \u201cinvestor conference,\u201d according to one attendee.\u00a0Haley did not say at any point whether she would endorse Trump, be willing to run as Trump\u2019s vice presidential nominee if offered, or run for president in the future, according to multiple attendees of the donor retreat. But those attendees came away from the event with the impression that Haley herself did not have a firm answer to any of those questions. The discussion also veered at one point to Haley backers who are still voting for her in\u00a0the primary even though she\u2019s dropped out of the race.\u00a0On Tuesday night, for example, during the second day of the donor retreat, Trump won the Maryland Republican primary with 80% of the vote;\u00a0 almost 20% of GOP voters chose Haley. Haley didn\u2019t directly say whether she wanted her backers to keep voting for her or to just vote for Trump. She\u2019s deliberately not saying that, one attendee said, but she indicated that she wanted her supporters and attendees at the retreat to \u201cvote your conscience, vote however you want to vote.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s for you to decide,\u201d Haley said, according to one attendee. During the event,\u00a0 Haley did not directly address\u00a0her ongoing support in the primary\u00a0or offer any direct plans about her political future or running again, according to Eric J. Tanenblatt, a top donor who attended the conference. \u201cI don\u2019t think she\u2019s made any decisions about her future,\u201d Tanenblatt said. Also during the retreat, longtime Haley adviser Jon Lerner and Haley campaign manager Betsy Ankney gave a presentation about how the campaign raised and spent money while the former governor and UN ambassador was running. \u201c[Ankney and Lerner] walked through how the money was spent and how they did what they did. There was obviously a lot of talk about what people would\u00a0like\u00a0her to do. But again she hasn\u2019t made any decisions. I think it\u2019s fair to say, though, that she\u2019s 52 years old, so she\u2019s got some years ahead of her,\u201d Tanenblatt said. Haley also fielded questions from donors on specific issues, including\u00a0abortion, the state of American democracy and the national debt, according to multiple attendees.\u00a0She reiterated her support for Israel in the ongoing war in Gaza when asked during the retreat about the conflict. \u201cWell, she\u2019s been an ardent supporter of Israel and has not wavered at all. Remember at one of the debates when she said \u2018finish them\u2019 referring to Hamas. I think she still feels very strongly about that,\u201d Tanenblatt said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/politics/nikki-haley-donor-retreat/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "us"}}
