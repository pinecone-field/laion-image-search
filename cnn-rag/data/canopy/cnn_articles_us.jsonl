{"id": "2024_05_26_business_tennis-popularity-zendaya-challengers", "text": "It\u2019s not Zendaya\u2019s fault you can\u2019t stop thinking about tennis. Her magnetic performance in \u201cChallengers,\u201d a movie about a m\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois that happens to have tennis in the background, might seem to have thrust the sport into the spotlight, but it\u2019s becoming more popular in the past few years that it\u2019s hard to escape. The sport is surging on a global scale, with its biggest names fronting luxe fashion campaigns from Louis Vuitton to Loewe and stars gracing the cover of Vogue. Of course, there\u2019s a TikTok angle, with the rise of #tenniscore videos garnering tens of millions of views, and yes, even that buzzy film, which was number one at the box office in its debut weekend. In a world of megawatt sports stars, ESPN went with tennis and chose 23-time grand slam winner Serena Williams to host this year\u2019s ESPY Awards, airing on ABC in July, perhaps as a testament that the sport is actually a draw again. Tennis had its heydey in the 1970s and 80s but a resurgence began at the height of Covid-19 when it was one of the few activities people could play safely while socially distanced. Its popularity has only grown since, as there\u2019s a changing of the guard among the top-ranked players that it\u2019s attracting new eyes and corporate interests, like fashion and Hollywood, fueling a boon. Not only are people just watching it, they\u2019re actually hitting the courts: The United States Tennis Association (USTA) said that nearly 24 million people are currently playing tennis, marking four consecutive years of growth. Brands are serving The money is following: In the past year, the number of sponsorships jumped 41% and the number of brands advertising in tennis soared 40%, according to SponsorUnited, a sports and entertainment research platform,\u00a0growing faster than many other sports including MLB, MLS and the NBA. That\u2019s the result of a \u201cconvergence of a few important factors,\u201d according to Bob Lynch, CEO of SponsorUnited, including rising TV ratings for the Tennis Channel and major tournaments, the docuseries \u201cBreak Point\u201d that had a two-season run on Netflix plus the growth of tennis players\u2019 social media accounts. Tennis is one the rare sports that plays nearly year-round with weekly tournaments across the world, so it \u201cattracts a diverse, global and localized fan base, which gives brands the ability to target very specific audiences for specific reasons,\u201d Lynch told CNN. Want to promote Swiss tourism around the world? The country tapped its greatest tennis export Roger Federer to star in a campaign for just that, with one viral ad starring Anne Hathaway that garnered more than 100 million views on YouTube. Or want to advertise to an affluent audience? That explains all the banking logos surrounding the courts at Roland Garros in Paris. Tennis is also going through a change of guard, especially on the men\u2019s side with Rafael Nadal likely playing his final season and Novak Djokovic, who is still the world\u2019s no. 1 men\u2019s player, lately struggling. Popular players on the woman\u2019s tour such as the Williams sisters have either retired, struggled with injuries or have taken a maternity leave such as former no. 1 Naomi Osaka. That\u2019s prompted an opening for many players, especially younger ones, including 2023 Wimbledon winner Carlos Alcaraz, who is just 21 years old, and Iga \u015awi\u0105tek, the 22-year-old from Poland who has already won four grand slam titles, to become global superstars. \u201cDigitally native and content savvy younger players like Coco Gauff are becoming more prominent,\u201d Lynch said. \u201cFans have more access to tennis athletes and their lives, interests and journeys than ever before due to the increased social exposure they receive, which allows them to become more influential to fans and brands alike.\u201d A scroll through Gauff\u2019s Instagram page, where the 2023 US Open women\u2019s final winner has nearly 2 million followers, shows her various sponsors mixed with photos from her personal life. Posts on her feed range from Barilla (the pasta maker signed her in 2019 to include its logo on her clothing), to speaking about how technology helps her practice in a Microsoft ad. How players cash in Another brand featured heavily on Gauff\u2019s Instagram is New Balance, her official on-court outfitter that signed her when she was just 14 years old, which has since expanded to include a lineup of shoes that the 20-year-old helps design. When Gauff won her first Grand Slam title last year, not only was she wearing a New Balance outfit designed for the US Open, but after winning, she donned a \u201cCall Me Coco Champion\u201d T-shirt that sold out within a few hours. Although she\u2019s the brand\u2019s biggest player, she\u2019s also part of a select few athletes that the privately owned apparel maker has deals with, trailing bigger outfitters such as Nike and Adidas. \u201cWe say no a lot,\u201d admits Evan Zeder, director of global sports marketing for New Balance\u2019s tennis and baseball units. \u201cWe\u2019re not looking to just sign a bunch of athletes to have a bunch of athletes.\u201d Its players, which also includes no. 14 men\u2019s player Tommy Paul, get various forms of payment including retainers and bonuses from New Balance and clothes and footwear to wear on and off the court. Tennis is different because the athlete is wearing the brand head to toe and is the center of attention since it\u2019s largely a solo sport. Choosing a tennis player to sponsor takes trust on both sides, with New Balance having to prove that its clothes and shoes perform \u201con the highest levels of the sport\u201d and avoid a public relations nightmare currently happening in baseball, but it\u2019s \u201cultimately waiting for the right opportunities for the brand,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cThe opportunity for us to story tell with the athletes is more unique than any other sport out there because they\u2019re not wearing a team or jersey, they\u2019re wearing New Balance,\u201d he said. Fashion on the forefront While New Balance is a relatively new clothier to enter the sport, others have been involved for decades. Lacoste, the French luxury brand, was born with tennis in mind since its start in 1933. After all, founder Ren\u00e9 Lacoste created the \u201cpolo shirt\u201d that was made for tennis. \u201cLacoste\u00a0undoubtedly benefits from the greatest legitimacy in this universe thanks to its sporting roots, particularly in tennis,\u201d said Lacoste\u2019s Deputy CEO Catherine Spindler. The crocodile-adorned brand has two of the biggest names in tennis who faced off against each other in the 2023 US Open men\u2019s final: Djokovic and Daniil Medvedev, with the former easily winning. Lacoste\u2019s polo shirts have become a major part of the \u201ctennis aesthetic,\u201d or the luxury athleticism #tenniscore trending on social media. That\u2019s perhaps not a surprise to Spindler because the sport \u201chas always been associated with elegance, including from a sartorial point of view.\u201d \u201cRecently, the influence of tennis on fashion has strengthened even further, and many are adopting the codes of this sport,\u201d she told CNN. \u201cPieces from the tennis universe are highly praised and serve as sources of inspiration for everyone.\u201d Zendaya recently wore a custom-made Lacoste silhouette ensemble for her \u201cChallengers\u201d press stop in Australia, which is \u201cfurther proof of the inspiration generated by tennis,\u201d Spindler said. Big business for booze Tennis has not only raised the profile for clothing, but it\u2019s a magnet for premium spirit brands too. The Australian Open serves up the Aperol Spritz. Roland Garros in Paris, which starts Sunday, has its Mo\u00ebt & Chandon champagne and no visit to Wimbledon, near London, is complete without a Pimm\u2019s. However, arguably the most popular cocktail in tennis is at the US Open: the Honey Deuce. The $22 drink mixes Grey Goose vodka, lemonade and Chambord and is topped with a honeydew melon ball. In 2023, a record-breaking 450,000 of these drinks were sold. Alcohol brands trying to crack the US market see the growing popularity of tennis as an opportunity to introduce themselves to drinkers. Take Maestro Dobel, a tequila brand sold in the US since 2008 but overshadowed by its celebrity-backed competitors. Dobel became the US Open\u2019s official tequila sponsor last year, bringing alongs its Ace Paloma cocktail that it sells at other tennis tournaments it sponsors. But the brand\u2019s attraction to tennis \u201cwasn\u2019t something that happened overnight,\u201d said Lander Otegui, the chief marketing officer for Proximo, noting that the brand has sponsored tournaments in Mexico for more than a decade. Dobel, in recent years, expanded north to become sponsors of elite-level tournaments in Miami, Indian Wells and Cincinnati \u2014 all places where Otegui said Dobel sees an \u201cuptick\u201d in sales following the tournament. The fans that tennis attracts are \u201cpretty wide\u201d in regards to ages but the affluent audience that frequent the events \u201cgoes hand-and-hand with the brand,\u201d Otegui said. Otegui declined to reveal specific financial numbers on sponsoring a tournament, but said it\u2019s a \u201cmulti-million dollar investment\u201d that involves paying a hefty fee and additional money for displays and, at the US Open, a starry suite. Last year, it had a suite at Arthur Ashe Stadium, the US Open\u2019s biggest court, where it attracted A-list stars like Charlize Theron and Katie Holmes, which in return, gave the brand even more publicity. \u201cIt\u2019s been an incredible time for tennis in the last few years, and with record attendance\u00a0for pretty much every event in the US and globally,\u201d he said. \u201cThe sport is in a really good place and it\u2019s also helped us solidify\u00a0our presence in it.\u201d As for the future, growth won\u2019t fault if the USTA has its way: The organization wants to grow the number of people playing to 35 million, or 10% of the US population, within the next decade.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/26/business/tennis-popularity-zendaya-challengers/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/27/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_05_25_us_primate-escape-walterboro-south-carolina", "text": "The search for a pet primate who escaped last week from his habitat in South Carolina was ongoing Sunday, a news release from Colleton County Animal Services said. The Colleton County Sheriff\u2019s Office advised residents in a Facebook post Friday that a primate is loose somewhere in the Walterboro area, 48 miles west of Charleston. The animal\u2019s owner \u201cis attempting to capture it and has called in assistance, the sheriff\u2019s office said. The monkey, whose name is Bradley, is a 15-year-old Macaque who has lived in Walterboro for the past six years, according to animal services. Bradley\u2019s owner and animal services had not been able to locate him as of 10:30 a.m. ET Sunday. \u201cAnimal Control and the Sheriff\u2019s Office have received numerous tips as to Bradley\u2019s location but because of the attention this situation has caused on social media and news channels, people who are trying to get a look at Bradley are sadly hampering the owner\u2019s efforts to catch him,\u201d animal services Director Laura Clark said. Professionals have been hired to help reunite Bradley with his owner, Clark added. An image taken by Walterboro resident Tiffany Edenfield seems to show the primate standing in the grass. It has a red face, similar to some species of baboon and macaque monkeys. One Walterboro resident, Kordell Brabham, didn\u2019t believe his grandmother at first when she said she had spotted a \u201cmonkey\u201d in the yard. \u201cNana, I think you need to go inside, it may be a little too hot out here for you,\u201d Brabham said he told her. But soon after, he spotted the animal his grandmother was talking about. In a video shared with CNN, the escapee can be seen walking on top of a shed. Brabham was shocked and said the first thought running through his mind was, \u201cdon\u2019t get too close, that\u2019s a monkey.\u201d The animal eventually climbed down from the shed and went into a nearby yard, Brabham said. Residents are advised not to approach the primate, which the sheriff\u2019s office said, \u201ccould be stressed,\u201d and only to report sightings. \u201cPlease monitor your pets while they are outside as a precaution,\u201d the sheriff\u2019s office added. The sheriff\u2019s office received a report of the primate \u201cattempting to attack a resident\u2019s dog in a yard,\u201d according to South Carolina news station WLTX. It\u2019s unclear how the animal got loose or came to live in Walterboro, a city of over 5,000 people. South Carolina law says that it\u2019s illegal to purchase or possess great apes \u2013 chimpanzees, gorillas and orangutans. But it is legal to keep other wild animals as pets, according to the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control. Smaller primates like monkeys and baboons seem to fall outside the state\u2019s law on possessing wildlife.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/25/us/primate-escape-walterboro-south-carolina/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/27/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_05_23_us_minneapolis-police-hit-and-run-mosque", "text": "The Minneapolis Police Department is investigating a hit-and-run incident as a potential bias crime after a driver struck a man in the parking lot of a mosque while driving toward him at high speed, police said. The 36-year-old victim had non-life-threatening injuries and was transported to a local hospital, a news release from the police department said. Just before noon on Wednesday, the man was in the parking lot of the Alhikma Islamic Center in south Minneapolis retrieving items from his car when a minivan drove toward him at a high speed, police said. He attempted to run when the driver of the minivan swerved and struck him, according to police. \u201cBased on the information gathered by our investigators so far, I am concerned that this crime may have been motivated by bias,\u201d Police Chief Brian O\u2019Hara said. \u201cWe won\u2019t tolerate any crime in our city. But hate crimes and crimes against our houses of worship are particularly troubling because of the very real widespread fear they generate and the potential division they create among our residents.\u201d The hit-and-run comes amid a surge in reported anti-Muslim bias incidents across the US in recent months \u2013 an increase the Council on American-Islamic Relations has called \u201cunprecedented.\u201d Last month, CAIR said it received 8,061 complaints of\u00a0anti-Muslim bias\u00a0incidents in 2023 \u2013 the highest number in the 28 years CAIR has tracked hate. Officers are working to locate the suspect and the van, according to the release. Police patrols have also been increased to protect those who enter and leave from the house of worship. Police department leadership is in communication with the imam and staff at the mosque, as well as community leaders, according to O\u2019Hara. Investigators are familiar with the suspect, O\u2019Hara said, as he has a \u201chistory of trespassing and acting erratically at the mosque and in the neighborhood.\u201d CNN has reached out to the Minneapolis Police Department for more information. The Minnesota chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations says the victim is one of its staffers who was targeted by a man who CAIR alleges has harassed the mosque and worshipers many times in the past three years. \u201cThis apparently intentional attack outside a religious institution must be investigated as a possible hate crime,\u201d\u00a0said Jaylani Hussein, executive director of CAIR-Minnesota. \u201cWe urge stepped-up security and increased vigilance at Islamic institutions statewide.\u201d The department describes the suspect as \u201ca light complected, black male in his late 30s wearing a brown shirt and black glasses\u201d and driving a 2002 Silver Windstar minivan. The department has asked for tips from the public. The hit-and-run comes just over a year after a man allegedly set\u00a0fires at two Minneapolis mosques.

{"id": "2024_05_25_us_harrison-butker-speech-response", "text": "In his first public comments following a controversial speech at a recent college commencement, Kansas City Chiefs kicker Harrison Butker defended his address and emphasized his Catholic faith. \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t clear that the timeless Catholic values are hated by many, it is now,\u201d Butker said during a speech at the \u201cCourage Under Fire\u201d gala in Nashville on Friday night. The Nashville speech was\u00a0posted to X by right-wing media outlet The Daily Wire. This is the first time the three-time Super Bowl champion\u00a0has spoken publicly about his commencement address at Benedictine College, a small Catholic college in Kansas, on May 11. During his address, Butker made comments interpreted by many as homophobic and sexist, including calling Pride Month a \u201cdeadly sin\u201d and saying that a woman\u2019s accomplishments in the home are more valuable than any academic or professional goals, among other things. Friday night\u2019s gala was hosted by\u00a0Regina Caeli Academy \u2013 a hybrid campus/homeschool Catholic school group with several locations across the country. The gala boasted several other speakers including right-wing media personality and host at the Daily Wire, Matt Walsh. \u201cOver the past few days, my beliefs, or what people think I believe, have been the focus of countless discussions around the globe,\u201d Butker, who is on the school\u2019s\u00a0board of directors, said. Regina Caeli Academy\u00a0did not immediately respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment. \u201cAt the outset, many people expressed a shocking level of hate. But as the days went on, even those who disagreed with my viewpoints shared their support for my freedom of religion,\u201d Butker said Friday. Butker reaffirmed his commitment to his Catholic faith, saying, \u201cOur love for Jesus and thus our desire to speak out should never be outweighed by the longing of our fallen nature to be loved by the world.\u201d During his speech, Butker referred to Saint Daniel, the biblical prophet who was thrown into a lion\u2019s den for committing to prayer to God, despite a law that condemned worshipers to death. \u201cI can\u2019t help but tremble at the thought of the courage many saints have shown in their lives,\u201d Butker said. Daniel was spared by God due to his commitment to faith, according to the Old Testament. \u201cWould I be so bold if the repercussion was what Daniel faced in being fed to lions? In reality, any courage I\u2019ve shown will lead to some small suffering. And it will lead to some people maybe never liking me, but that could be God\u2019s will,\u201d the Chiefs kicker said. The NFL issued a statement earlier this month, saying Butker\u2019s comments don\u2019t reflect the views of the league. Butker\u2019s May 11 speech sparked criticism from LGBT advocacy organization GLAAD, which called his comments \u201ca clear miss\u201d and \u201cwoefully out of step with Americans about Pride, LGBTQ people and women.\u201d The sisters of Mount St. Scholastica monastery, a\u00a0founding institution\u00a0and sponsor of Benedictine College, also distanced themselves from Butker\u2019s message. \u201cThe sisters of Mount St. Scholastica do not believe that Harrison Butker\u2019s comments in his 2024 Benedictine College commencement address represent the Catholic, Benedictine, liberal arts college that our founders envisioned and in which we have been so invested,\u201d they said\u00a0in a statement. \u201cInstead of promoting unity in our church, our nation, and the world, his comments seem to have fostered division.\u201d Fellow Chiefs star, Travis Kelce, recently responded to the commencement address, saying\u00a0he does not agree with \u201cjust about any\u201d of Butker\u2019s views but values him as a teammate. \u201cI cherish him as a teammate. I think Pat (Mahomes) said it best where he is every bit of a great person and a great teammate,\u201d\u00a0Kelce said on the latest episode of the \u201cNew Heights\u201d podcast he hosts with his brother, Jason.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/25/us/harrison-butker-speech-response/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/27/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_05_23_us_marilyn-mosby-baltimore-sentencing", "text": "A federal judge has sentenced Baltimore\u2019s former top prosecutor Marilyn Mosby to time served and 12 months of home confinement \u2013 to be served concurrently with 3 years of supervised release \u2013 for mortgage fraud and perjury. In addition, Mosby was ordered to complete 100 hours of community service, according to the judgment. Mosby, who gained national prominence for charging six police officers in connection with the 2015 death of Freddie Gray in a police van, was convicted in two trials of making a false mortgage application and perjury. US prosecutors had asked the court to sentence Mosby, 44, to 20 months in prison, followed by a supervised release, according to a May 9 sentencing memorandum. That sentence, the memo says, would \u201cmake clear that those who break the law, including those in positions of public trust, will be held accountable.\u201d Mosby has claimed she is innocent and the charges against her are politically motivated. Her attorneys\u00a0argued in a May 16 response she \u201chas been punished enough,\u201d asking for a sentence of time served with one year of supervised release. US District Court Judge Lydia Griggsby said she took into account that two juries found Mosby did something wrong and \u201cbreached a public trust,\u201d according to CNN affiliate WBAL-TV, which had a reporter in court. The judge also said the fact that Mosby is a mother of two weighed heavily on the court, according to the news station. In addition to Thursday\u2019s sentence, Griggsby ordered Mosby to forfeit 90% of her interests in the Longboat Key, Florida, condo connected to her conviction on making a false mortgage application. A preliminary order filed Thursday authorized the government to seize the property. Once sold, Mosby could receive up to $47,600 plus 10% of the home\u2019s appreciation value. Mosby walked out of court with her two daughters and alongside a group of supporters, including civil rights attorney Ben Crump, who chanted, \u201cJustice for Marilyn.\u201d Mosby told the crowd she was \u201ceternally grateful\u201d for all her supporters and advocates. \u201cThis is not over,\u201d she said. \u201cBut God was here today and I know he\u2019s with me, he touched the heart of this judge and has allowed me to go home to my babies.\u201d In a statement sent to CNN after the sentencing, the United States Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of Maryland said, \u201cAs always, we respect the judgment of the court.\u201d Where the convictions stem from Mosby\u2019s trials, convictions and sentence mark\u00a0a remarkable undoing for a prosecutor who took office just months before\u00a0Gray died\u00a0from spinal injuries suffered while in police custody in the back of a van. Three officers were acquitted, leading Mosby to\u00a0drop the charges\u00a0against the rest. Her\u00a0sentencing follows Mosby\u2019s conviction on three charges across two trials. Mosby was first found guilty in November of two counts of perjury after prosecutors accused her of falsely claiming in 2020 she experienced \u201cadverse financial consequences\u201d as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic to withdraw $90,000 in retirement funds. At the time, she earned a gross salary of $247,955.58, the indictment said, and her pay was never reduced. Mosby then was found guilty in February of making a false mortgage application stemming from the purchase of a Florida condo, the Justice Department said. At trial, prosecutors presented evidence showing Mosby falsely stated she had gotten a $5,000 gift from her husband to be applied to the purchase of the property to get a lower interest rate. In fact, the Justice Department said, Mosby sent her husband $5,000, which he then transferred back to her. The jury in that trial acquitted Mosby of a second charge of making a false mortgage application stemming from the purchase of another Florida home. This is a developing story and will be updated.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/23/us/marilyn-mosby-baltimore-sentencing/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/27/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_05_23_us_unc-dei-policy-vote-reaj", "text": "The Board of Governors for the University of North Carolina System  voted Thursday to repeal and replace its existing diversity and inclusion policy that applies to the 17 schools the board oversees. The new policy reverses one that was adopted in 2019 that sought to \u201cfoster an inclusive environment\u201d\u00a0and required each school to submit diversity and inclusion reports to the board of trustees every year. The new policy now requires UNC schools to \u201censure equality of all persons & viewpoints,\u201d and promote \u201cnondiscrimination in employment practices.\u201d It also mandates that all UNC schools comply with a series of amendments passed by the North Carolina General Assembly in the past year that limit what can be discussed or taught about race, racism and sex in government institutions. The policy passed with two board members \u2013 Joel Ford and Sonja Phillips Nichols \u2013 voting no. Both Ford and Nichols are Black. As the meeting convened, dozens of protestors gathered outside to rally against the proposed changes to the DEI policy. Andy Wallace, director of media relations for the UNC system, confirmed to CNN that two people were arrested outside the meeting Thursday morning. Ahead of the vote, board secretary Pearl Burris-Floyd and board member Gene Davis discussed their support for the new policy. Burris-Floyd said she retired from the field of DEI and believes there have been flaws in the way DEI has been taught. \u201cAnd that has hurt the fabric and ability to carry things forward, but it does not mean that we stop,\u201d Burris-Floyd said. The new policy, she said, will \u201cmake that path forward clearer for all people.\u201d Davis acknowledged that DEI has helped marginalized groups feel more welcomed on campus and ensures that schools are reflection of the state\u2019s diversity. Still, Davis said he had concerns. \u201cI have been made aware of things that have been done in the name of DEI that make me uncomfortable and that I believe actually result in our university communities being less welcoming to all,\u201d Davis said. He did not provide examples of the instances that made him \u201cuncomfortable.\u201d Davis said the commitments in the new policy are \u201cheartfelt by the members of this board and by the university leadership.\u201d But some students felt outraged over the board\u2019s decision, and what it signals for the future of diversity and inclusion in the UNC system. Pragya Upreti, a rising junior at UNC Chapel Hill, told CNN she attended the student press conference, as well as the protest outside the UNC Board of Governors meeting on Thursday morning. She told CNN she believes the decision to repeal the DEI policy sends a message that the board doesn\u2019t value Black and brown students. \u201cTruly this administration has failed us, and it will continue to fail generations of students who saw opportunity in diversity, equity, and inclusion,\u201d Upreti said. Chantal Stevens, executive director of the ACLU of North Carolina, called the Board\u2019s vote \u201cdeeply troubling\u201d in a statement and she asked the board to reconsider. \u201cOur university campuses must be environments where students feel included and are able to fully engage academically, and DEI programs serve an important role in achieving this,\u201d Stevens wrote in the statement. \u201cPulling funding from these programs undermines these efforts and sends a worrying message about how committed our universities are to protecting the rights of students to be free from discrimination on the basis of their\u00a0race, ethnicity, disability, or other protected classes.\u201d The vote by the 24-member UNC System Board Thursday comes as diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives at public universities and corporations across the country are facing a string of attacks from critics and conservative lawmakers. The new policy follows similar moves by state governments in Florida and Texas to ban DEI efforts from public colleges and universities. Schools in the UNC System are required to comply with the new policy by September 1. The proposal does not indicate how many DEI jobs might be impacted. Earlier this month, the Board of Trustees for the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill\u00a0passed a separate proposal to divert $2.3 million from DEI programs to public safety. One trustee pointed to recent protests on campus as part of the reason the Board voted to advance the proposal to shift funding to public safety measures. \u201cWe talk about peaceful protest, but when you destroy property, or you take down the US flag, and you have to put up gates around it costs money, or deploy officers to do that,\u201d Marty Kotis the vice chair of the board\u2019s budget and finance committee said. \u201cNorth Carolinians are watching all of this and they are not happy. And\u00a0[I] think it\u2019s imperative that we have the proper resources for our law enforcement to protect the campus, and that means our property and that means our flag as well.\u201d Major universities including the University of Florida and University of Texas at Austin have been forced to dismantle their DEI offices and programs and cut jobs to comply with state laws and regulations. Since 2023, 14\u00a0anti-DEI bills that\u00a0target programs at colleges have been signed into law,\u00a0according to a tally by the Chronicle of Higher\u00a0Education. North Carolina lawmakers passed a bill last year that bans diversity statements from state agencies, the University of North Carolina system, and community colleges. \u2018You will be able to feel the difference\u2019 The anti-DEI proposals at both the system-wide level and UNC at Chapel Hill\u2019s campus have left students worried about the future of diversity programs on campus if they are enacted. Ahead of the meeting, UNC System students gathered in Raleigh to speak out against the proposed changes.\u00a0 \u201cTo gut the DEI policy is to deny students both present and future of their right to a high-quality education,\u201d one student said, according to CNN affiliate WRAL. \u201cDiversity and equity and inclusion are foundational to education.\u201d\u00a0 Another student said she attends UNC Ashville and is concerned that enrollment will decline at UNC System schools because DEI programs are banned.\u00a0 \u201cPassing this anti-DEI policy will be a kiss of death for some of these systems and institutions,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd will be monumentally detrimental to future student interest to apply for and much less attend these UNC System Schools\u2026. We will all suffer.\u201d Toby Posel, co-policy chair for UNC Chapel Hill\u2019s Affirmative Action Coalition and a co-founder of the student organization TransparUNCy, said he was \u201cextremely disgusted and disappointed\u201d at both the UNC System and UNC board members for going against DEI. Posel said he is\u00a0concerned that the UNC system\u2019s anti-DEI policy leaves room for interpretation and it is unknown how jobs, programs and offices might be impacted. But regardless, Posel said the absence of DEI will make the campuses unwelcoming for people of color, LGBTQ+ students and first-generation college students. \u201cYou will be able to feel the difference,\u201d Posel said. \u201cIt will be significantly less welcoming, less safe, less supportive. Their academic lives are going to suffer, social lives are going suffer. This is a very clear statement from the highest level of university governance in North Carolina that (they) don\u2019t care about those students.\u201d Julian Taylor, executive board member of the Affirmative Action Coalition and a co-founder of TransparUNCy,\u00a0said he believes both boards are taking a political stance against DEI that aligns with a conservative movement instead of being neutral. The UNC Board of Governors is made up of 24 members who are elected by the Republican-led North Carolina General Assembly. The UNC Chapel Hill Board of Trustees has 15 members, including eight elected by the Board of Governors, six appointed by the General Assembly and one spot for the president of student government. Taylor said DEI initiatives have allowed UNC Chapel Hill to reckon with its history of slavery on campus. He worries that cutting DEI programs will impact curriculum and prevent this history from being taught. \u201cDEI is a small step in serving racial justice,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cBut a lot of this is about the larger, overarching debate about what we do to try to rectify past injustices. And this is a pretty clear answer from UNC and the UNC Board of Trustees saying that the answer to that question is \u2018absolutely nothing.\u2019\u201d CNN\u2019s Devon M.

{"id": "2024_05_26_politics_rfk-jr-nominated-libertarian-party", "text": "Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was eliminated from contention for the Libertarian Party\u2019s presidential nomination during the party\u2019s convention Sunday. In a surprise move earlier Sunday, Kennedy was put up for consideration as a nominee to represent the party in 2024, but he was eliminated in the first round of voting after receiving support from 19 delegates, or just 2.07%. Kennedy, who spoke at the party\u2019s national convention in Washington, DC, on Friday, was nominated by a delegate Sunday on the convention floor, where his candidacy was met with boos from other delegates. Donald Trump was also nominated on the convention floor Sunday, but Libertarian Party Chair Angela McArdle ruled the former president was not qualified because he did not submit nominating papers. Trump spoke Saturday at the convention, where he was loudly and consistently booed, particularly when he asked attendees to \u201cnominate me or at least vote for me.\u201d Trump received votes from six delegates as a write-in candidate. In a rebuke of the former president, adult film actress Stormy Daniels \u2013 whose alleged affair with Trump is at the center of his hush money trial in New York \u2013 received a vote from one delegate. (Trump has denied the affair and pleaded not guilty in the case.) Candidates who received less than 5% of the vote were eliminated in the first round. In all subsequent rounds, the candidate with the lowest vote total will be eliminated. After Kennedy\u2019s elimination, he urged Libertarians to back his campaign even though \u201cwe may not agree on every downstream issue.\u201d The independent candidate said in a social media post Sunday that addressing the convention was \u201ca high point of my campaign.\u201d \u201cWhat an unexpected honor to wake up this morning to a groundswell in the Libertarian Party seeking to nominate me. I would have accepted the nomination if offered because independents and third parties need to unite right now to reclaim our country from the corrupt two-party system,\u201d Kennedy said. Kennedy told CNN last week that he did not intend to seek the party\u2019s nomination at the convention this weekend. Tim O\u2019Brien, a Libertarian delegate from New Jersey, said he felt Kennedy was trying to use the party for his own gain without respecting its values. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a lot of people come into the party, they\u2019ll run, they\u2019ll make a big stink and then leave. And I guarantee you, he may come here; he\u2019s not going to be here after the election,\u201d O\u2019Brien said. \u201cWe want people that are willing to say, full force, \u2018We\u2019re Libertarians, we\u2019re staying with you guys,\u2019\u201d he added. \u201cHe has no need for us. He wants to get ballot access.\u201d Kennedy, a former Democrat, began courting Libertarian officials even before he left his party to run as an independent, meeting with McArdle in July and February to discuss their shared beliefs. The Libertarian ticket was seen as a possible pathway for Kennedy to circumvent ballot-access hurdles and take advantage of the party\u2019s access to ballots in dozens of states. Kennedy is on the ballot in six states so far, compared with 38 states for the Libertarians. Kennedy\u2019s running mate, Nicole Shanahan, told CNN on Sunday that the Libertarian Party is \u201cmore relevant than ever\u201d and that \u201cthere\u2019s a great deal of possibility of success of us working together.\u201d The Silicon Valley attorney and entrepreneur\u2019s comments marked the first time she has taken questions from a major news outlet since she joined Kennedy\u2019s campaign in March. Shanahan, who was expected to make remarks at the convention Sunday, will no longer be speaking after Kennedy was eliminated from contention for the Libertarian nomination, according to two people familiar with the scheduling of her appearance. Kennedy told CNN last week following a rally in Colorado that his views on the environment, foreign policy and Covid-19 will appeal to Libertarian voters. \u201cMy approach is a free-market approach, which appeals to Libertarians,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m against war, which I think is another important issue for Libertarians. I support constitutional rights. President Trump dismantled our constitutional rights during Covid. So I think Libertarians are probably more inclined to support me if they follow their philosophies.\u201d Trump and Kennedy in recent weeks have ramped up their attacks on each other, as the independent\u2019s White House bid is increasingly viewed by the former president\u2019s advisers as a potential problem in an election expected to be decided by a narrow margin in a handful of states. Kennedy\u2019s support in national surveys has reached double digits \u2013 at 16% in a\u00a0CNN poll conducted last month by SSRS\u00a0\u2013 with strong indications that he is siphoning support from both Trump and President Joe Biden. As the threat has crystalized, so have Trump\u2019s attacks on Kennedy. The former president now regularly attacks Kennedy in public remarks and on social media. Earlier this month, Trump released a lengthy video that labeled Kennedy a \u201cDemocrat plant.\u201d This story and headline have been updated with additional developments.

The monument\u00a0in Tyrrell County, North Carolina, features a Confederate soldier on top of a pedestal with the inscription \u201cIn appreciation of our faithful slaves\u201d written underneath. The lawsuit, filed in the Eastern District of North Carolina, was brought by\u00a0a group called\u00a0The Concerned Citizens of Tyrrell County. The plaintiffs\u00a0claim the public monument is in violation of\u00a0the\u00a0Equal\u00a0Protection\u00a0Clause of the 14th\u00a0Amendment\u00a0because it \u201cexpresses a racially discriminatory message.\u201d The inscription on the statue promotes a \u201cpro-slavery message\u00a0and a pro-Confederate\u00a0message,\u201d according to the lawsuit. Jaelyn Miller, an attorney for the plaintiffs, told CNN she feels county commissioners have a responsibility to ensure that racist messages are not being displayed to the Black community. \u201cThis is sort of the only monument in the country on public land that textually\u00a0endorses slavery,\u201d Miller said. Ian Mance, another attorney for the plaintiffs, said the historical record is clear that the monument was meant to send a message. \u201cIt was put up in the front yard of what was soon to be the\u00a0Tyrrell\u00a0County Courthouse, which opened a few months later, to communicate to people that members of the Black community could not expect to get justice inside of that courthouse,\u201d he said. The lawsuit alleges the construction of the monument and the county\u2019s continued maintenance \u201ccommunicates, on behalf of local government, the idea that Tyrrell\u2019s institutions regard Black people\u2019s rightful place as one of subservience and obedience\u201d and that \u201cBlack people who were enslaved in Tyrrell County preferred their slavery to freedom.\u201d The lawsuit also claims that the county\u2019s display of the message has \u201cincite(d) racial hostility\u201d and endangers the plaintiffs\u2019 safety. The monument has been standing since 1902 and\u00a0the lawsuit\u00a0is the latest move in a decades-long battle to have it removed\u00a0from courthouse grounds.

Millions of Americans have taken to the skies, hit the road, fired up the barbecue grill and jumped into the pool this weekend to celebrate the start of summer 2024. Analysts are expecting the Memorial Day weekend to usher in yet another summer of strong consumer spending on travel and other leisure activities. The season is already off to a solid start: The Transportation Security Administration said that Thursday was its second-busiest day at airports in history, adding that five of its 10 busiest days ever were this month. AAA projected earlier this month that 43.8 million Americans are driving at least 50 miles this weekend, up 4% from last year\u2019s total and close to the all-time record of 44 million during the 2005 Memorial Day weekend. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen Memorial Day weekend travel numbers like these in almost 20 years,\u201d Paula Twidale, senior vice president at AAA Travel, said in a release. Royal Caribbean\u2019s first-quarter earnings results topped expectations, thanks to strong bookings and robust onboard spending. Company executives said in a earnings call that they\u2019re optimistic for the remainder of the year. If this momentum persists throughout the summer, that would mean solid revenue for leisure businesses such as Royal Caribbean, hotels, restaurants and theme parks, also providing an economic boost to cities with a big tourism scene. A Bank of America Institute analysis released last week expects that to be the case. In a virtual presentation to reporters, the bank\u2019s analysts said the outlook for leisure spending this summer looks promising, based on trends reflected in the bank\u2019s card data, results from a survey of 2,010 respondents and other resources from across the bank. Spending this summer will likely be a little softer than last year\u2019s, they said, but still strong. \u201cThe strength of the data already speaks to it being a solid summer,\u201d David Tinsley, senior economist at the Bank of America Institute, said during the presentation. The bank\u2019s consumer travel survey showed that 72% of people said they\u2019re planning to travel, with 36% saying they\u2019ve already planned their trip. It showed that more younger Americans are planning to take an international trip than older generations, while also planning for longer trips and to spend more. From January through April, spending using a Bank of America card per household was the highest for Japan, South Korea, Switzerland, Colombia and Costa Rica. In April, the share of total in-person international spending through Bank of America was the highest for Europe (32%), followed by Canada and Mexico (23%), then the Caribbean (13%). Domestically, California and Florida have seen some momentum recently when it comes to spending at restaurants. In the first four months of the year, spending rose more than 5% in California from the same period a year ago, while it was mostly flat in Florida. But compared to 2019, restaurant spending in California and Florida is up roughly 15% in each state. Even among respondents making less than $75,000 a year, more than 60% said they\u2019re planning to travel this summer. That figure is north of 80% for respondents making more than $150,000 a year. But the good times may not last forever. Americans have come increasingly under pressure with household debt continuing to climb and delinquencies rising, according to New York Fed data. \u201cIn the first quarter of 2024, credit card and auto loan transition rates into serious delinquency continued to rise across all age groups,\u201d Joelle Scally, regional economic principal within the Household and Public Policy Research Division at the New York Fed, said in a statement. Inflation is also still taking a bite out of people\u2019s budgets and interest rates remain perched at a two-decade high. Economists aren\u2019t expecting a recession this year, but many are estimating the economy will slow over the next 12 months: The latest figures on employment came in weaker than expected. For some, this year\u2019s summer splurge could well be the last hurrah.

{"id": "2024_05_15_us_nakba-day-anniversary-palestinians", "text": "Mohammad Zarqa trembled with fear as he watched panicked crowds of people, screaming and covered in blood, rush into his small village on the outskirts of Jerusalem. \u201cYou have to run,\u201d he remembers a woman crying out, shocking Zarqa out of a daze and sending him racing home to warn his family. He was only 12 years old at the time, unaware of the looming war that would soon upend his life. It was April 9, 1948, and Jewish militias had just attacked Deir Yassin, a village about a mile northeast of Zarqa\u2019s home in Ein Karem in what was then the British Mandate of Palestine. At least 100 people, including women and children, were killed \u2013 many stripped, lined up and shot with automatic fire, according to reports from the time archived by the United Nations. The massacre is among the events that led to al-Nakba, or \u201cthe catastrophe,\u201d when roughly 700,000 Palestinians fled or were expelled from their homes by armed Jewish groups seeking to establish the state of Israel. \u201cWe thought we were going to be next,\u201d Zarqa, now 88, tells CNN from his home in New Jersey. \u201cMy father said, \u2018We cannot stay here. They\u2019re going to come and massacre us.\u2019 We had nothing, no weapons, nothing to defend ourselves. That\u2019s the day we became refugees.\u201d On Wednesday, Zarqa joins millions of Palestinians across the world to mark Nakba Day with protests and community events intended to honor the memory of the Palestinians killed and displaced in 1948 and the brutal war unfolding today in Gaza. Part of that commemoration includes a commitment to storytelling, Zarqa says, whereby survivors of the Nakba generation continue to share their experiences with younger Palestinians so the dream of liberation and return never dies. He believes it\u2019s the only way to understand the current war and work toward a just and lasting peace in the region. \u201cMy heart is bleeding,\u201d he says softly. \u201cAt my age, I\u2019m still dreaming of going back home. Palestine is something that is still implanted in my heart and my body. It\u2019s where I was born. It\u2019s where I have my memories. It\u2019s my country.\u201d Yearning for home Zarqa, along with his parents and six siblings, fled Ein Karem on foot, taking very little with them. They walked from village to village, searching for food and sheltering in the homes and garages of kind strangers. The atrocities he witnessed along the way are seared in his memory. \u201cI saw the most horrific things in my life: women coming in with torn clothes and uncovered heads crying, screaming, saying that the Jews \u2013 they weren\u2019t called Israelis at the time \u2013 attacked their village and massacred everybody,\u201d Zarqa says. More than 15,000 Palestinians were killed and 531 towns and villages destroyed during al-Nakba, according to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics, an institute of the Palestinian Authority. Jewish leaders declared independence and the creation of the state of Israel on May 14, sparking a military response from Egypt, Syria and Jordan. The family hoped the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, as it would come to be known, would end in a swift victory for the Arabs. After several weeks, Zarqa\u2019s family returned to Ein Karem. But when they entered the village, they found it had been ransacked and its residents cast out by Jewish militias, Zarqa says. With nothing left to salvage, they fled to Jordan to wait out the war, he recalls. The family initially lived in squalor, surviving off the generosity of strangers and local mosques. They shared a home with other Palestinian refugees in Jabal Al Weibdeh, a neighborhood in Amman, Zarqa says. It had a dirt floor and there were no windows, doors or bathrooms. They often couldn\u2019t shower for months at a time. By March 1949, Israel had won the war and forbidden the hundreds of thousands of Palestinian refugees who had fled or were expelled from returning to their homes and ancestral lands. Zarqa\u2019s family was among them. The family began to build a new life in Jordan, one marked by struggle and poverty, as they patiently waited for permission to return to Ein Karem. But it never came, and decades later Zarqa found himself living in the United States \u2013 even further from his homeland \u2013 trying to raise a small family of his own. \u201cWe made a life in the US, but this still isn\u2019t home. You never forget that you had a house and somebody kicked you out of it,\u201d Zarqa says. \u201cWe will never stop wanting to return.\u201d A responsibility to teach Neither time nor distance has blurred Zarqa\u2019s memories of Palestine. He has passed onto his four children and eight grandchildren every bittersweet memory of Ein Karem, from its acres of orchards to the hilltop where he could see the mountains and Mediterranean sea in the distance. Zarqa remembers Ein Karem so vividly that despite his decades of absence, he was able to give his grandson, Zach Matari, who visited the village in 2019, directions over FaceTime to his old home, now in present-day Israel. An Israeli family is living there. \u201cI remember every inch of my village. If you go there I can tell you there was this apricot tree here, and there was a fig tree there, and that\u2019s the stairs we used to climb,\u201d he says. Jenan Matari, another one of his grandchildren, is a writer and social media influencer who uses her platform to educate followers about Palestinian history, culture and current events, including the war in Gaza. She loves listening to her grandfather\u2019s stories and says her work, which is rooted in his Nakba experience, is a form of resistance. All Palestinians in the diaspora, she says, should use their voices too. \u201cI get really sad for my grandfather, because if I\u2019m feeling triggered by the things that are happening in Gaza, and I\u2019m feeling this depleted and in so much pain watching this, I can only imagine what it\u2019s doing to him and his generation to watch what they lived through happening again, but on an even greater scale,\u201d Matari, 33, tells CNN. Talking about al-Nakba isn\u2019t easy, Zarqa confesses. He often pauses mid-sentence or changes the subject when it hurts a bit too much. But he refuses to be silenced by his grief and even invites other Nakba survivors to his home to share their experiences with family, friends and the wider community Dawud Assad, one of those survivors, lives just 10 miles away. He narrowly survived the Deir Yassin massacre, which he says claimed the lives of 47 family members, including his grandmother and 2-year-old brother. \u201cI was supposed to be dead,\u201d says Assad, who is now 92 and nicknamed Al-shaheed Al-hay, or \u201cthe living martyr.\u201d Assad survived by hiding in a shallow trench near his home, crouching and quietly praying for mercy as bullets grazed his hair. \u201cIt did not begin on October 7. What we went through is exactly what we\u2019re seeing now in Gaza and Rafah,\u201d Assad says, referring to Israel\u2019s ongoing war there. Videos of dead children are especially triggering because they remind him of his slain brother. Israel launched its war in Gaza after Hamas\u2019 brutal attack in Israel on October 7, in which 1,200 people were killed and hundreds of others taken hostage, Israeli officials say. In the seven months since that attack, Israel\u2019s bombing campaign and ground offensive in Gaza has killed more than 35,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health. It also has imposed a siege and razed entire communities, rendering nearly 90% of the population displaced and everyone food insecure. Israel says its military tactics are necessary to defeat Hamas and return the hostages. But in a March report for the United Nations\u2019 Human Rights Council, the UN Special Rapporteur on human rights in the Palestinian territories, Francesca Albanese, said there are \u201creasonable grounds\u201d to believe Israel is committing the crime of genocide against Palestinians in Gaza. Israel said it \u201cutterly rejects\u201d the report, which it said \u201cbrings shame\u201d on the council. For Zarqa and Assad, the war is reminiscent of the horrors they endured during al-Nakba, and it\u2019s important for them to draw that parallel for young Palestinians in the diaspora, as well as anyone else trying to make sense of the violence. \u201cAl-Nakba never ended,\u201d Zarqa says. They point to recent statements from Israeli officials that have alluded to another Nakba through suggestions of mass killing and displacement, or outright calling for it. In a November interview with Israel\u2019s Channel 12 news, Minister of Agriculture Avi Dichter described the war as \u201cthe Nakba of Gaza 2023.\u201d Following Dichter\u2019s comments, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reportedly urged ministers to choose their words more carefully. \u201cWe must be sensitive,\u201d he said, according to The Times of Israel. Hope for the future Zarqa\u2019s heart remains torn between nostalgia and grief as he concedes he may never again see his beloved Palestine, stroll through the quiet streets of Ein Karem or taste its delicious apricots. But he\u2019s sure his descendants will. There are some 5.9 million Palestinian refugees worldwide, most of them descendants of that 1948 generation of exiles, according to the United Nations. It is \u201cthe world\u2019s longest-standing protracted refugee crisis,\u201d the UN said at a 2023 event marking the 75th anniversary of al-Nakba as it urged a solution grounded in international law. While some countries, including the United States and United Kingdom, skipped the commemoration after Israel called for a boycott, Zarqa elsewhere sees hope: The anti-war protests taking over city streets and college campuses across the world. \u201cI am so proud of them,\u201d Zarqa says. \u201cYou pass on your stories to your children and then they carry the banner and continue to teach their children, and eventually their own grandchildren.\u201d \u201cPalestinians will never forget.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/us/nakba-day-anniversary-palestinians/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/27/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_05_25_politics_libertarian-party-trump-convention-speech", "text": "Former President Donald Trump was loudly and consistently booed throughout his speech Saturday at the Libertarian Party\u2019s national convention, particularly when he asked attendees to \u201cnominate me or at least vote for me.\u201d The heckling began the moment the former president took the stage, and some of his supporters in the room tried to drown out the boos with chants of \u201cWe want Trump.\u201d \u201cNow I think you should nominate me or at least vote for me, and we should win together,\u201d Trump said. \u201cBecause the Libertarians want to vote for me \u2026 and it\u2019s very important because we have to get rid of the worst president in history.\u201d Trump added, \u201cOnly do that if you want to win; if you want to lose, don\u2019t do that. Keep getting your 3% every four years.\u201d (In 2016, Libertarian presidential nominee\u00a0Gary Johnson\u00a0earned more than 3% of the popular vote \u2013 a high point in the party\u2019s history.) Trump left the stage after 34 minutes, marking one of his shortest campaign speeches to date. The Libertarian Party is expected to select its presidential nominee Sunday. Trump\u2019s stop at the Libertarian convention marked an unconventional one for a presumptive Republican nominee, but it is illustrative of\u00a0his campaign\u2019s intensifying concern\u00a0over third-party candidates. The outreach to Libertarians follows weeks of stepped-up attacks by Trump aimed at\u00a0Robert F. Kennedy Jr., whose high-profile independent White House bid is increasingly viewed by the former president\u2019s advisers as a potential problem in an election expected to be decided by a narrow margin in a handful of states. Kennedy, who spoke at the convention on Friday, was nominated by a delegate Sunday on the convention floor, where his candidacy was met with boos from other delegates. He was eliminated as a potential nominee in the first round of voting after receiving support from 19 delegates, or just 2.07% of delegates. Trump was also nominated on the convention floor Sunday, but Libertarian Party Chair Angela McArdle ruled the former president was not qualified because he did not submit nominating papers. \u201cThe reason I didn\u2019t file paperwork for the Libertarian Nomination, which I would have absolutely gotten if I wanted it (as everyone could tell by the enthusiasm of the Crowd last night!), was the fact that, as the Republican Nominee, I am not allowed to have the Nomination of another Party,\u201d Trump posted Sunday on Truth Social. \u201cRegardless, I believe I will get a Majority of the Libertarian Votes.\u201d According to Trump\u2019s campaign, a Republican presidential candidate can\u2019t be nominated by two political parties in most states. The scene inside the Washington Hilton was at times raucous Saturday, as Trump supporters and Libertarians clashed. McArdle, the party chair, took the stage ahead of Trump\u2019s speech to tell supporters of the former president sitting in the front rows to make room for the Libertarian delegates. \u201cI don\u2019t want to, like, fight with people or beg and plead. Let\u2019s just make room for the delegates, because those are the people you\u2019re trying to persuade, right? You are already sold. Our delegates are not sold, and President Trump is here to try to sell them,\u201d McArdle said. \u201cThose of you who are Donald Trump supporters, I think what I would like to see tonight is for us to all get along and come to an understanding and find areas of agreement even if we don\u2019t agree to vote for the same person,\u201d she added. Also ahead of the speech, Secret Service agents confiscated rubber chickens that the super PAC aligned with Kennedy\u2019s presidential campaign had passed out to attendees. \u201cNo lighters, no water bottles, no noisy chickens,\u201d one agent yelled to attendees waiting to go through the security checkpoint. Tony Lyons, the co-chair of the pro-Kennedy American Values 2024 super PAC, confirmed to CNN that the group had distributed the rubber chickens at the convention Saturday. Libertarians in the crowd at times confronted Trump supporters, and some audience members were escorted out of the venue. One Libertarian critic of Trump was forced to leave after CNN observed him throwing a punch at a Trump-supporting audience member. Several people toward the front of the room turned their backs to Trump as he spoke. One of Trump\u2019s few loud applause lines Saturday came when he announced that if elected, he would commute the sentence of Ross Ulbricht, the creator of the underground website Silk Road, which let users anonymously buy and sell anything from drugs to hacking tutorials. Ulbricht was sentenced to life in prison in 2015 following his conviction on seven counts ranging from money laundering to drug trafficking, and many attendees at the Libertarian convention have been arguing for his pardon. Trump also received cheers when he said he would put a Libertarian in his Cabinet and appoint Libertarians to senior positions in his administration in a potential second term. Prior to the speech, the Trump campaign said it anticipated getting an unfriendly reception from some attendees \u2013 former GOP presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, now a Trump surrogate, received loud boos when he mentioned the former president in his speech at the convention Friday. \u201cDo we know that it\u2019s not exactly home base? Absolutely. There will be people who want him to be there and people who don\u2019t want him to be there, but we\u2019re on offense and competing for nontraditional votes in order to unite the country,\u201d Trump campaign spokesman Jason Miller told CNN. Meanwhile, Biden\u2019s campaign cast Trump as \u201canti-freedom\u201d ahead of his address. \u201cDonald Trump says his Republican Party is the party of freedom, but tell that to the women who have had the freedom to make their own health care decisions ripped away and their pregnancies monitored by the government,\u201d Biden campaign spokesperson Kevin Munoz said in a statement Saturday. Biden was also invited to speak at the convention but didn\u2019t respond, McArdle told CNN earlier. At a news conference immediately following Trump\u2019s speech,\u00a0Chase Oliver, a Libertarian presidential candidate, said that he believed it was a mistake to invite Trump but that he was proud that Libertarians heckled the former president during his remarks. \u201cI don\u2019t like having a war criminal on this stage. I don\u2019t feel he deserves a spot on this stage,\u201d Oliver said. \u201cWhile I think it was a mistake to have invited Donald Trump, I\u2019m glad he got to see a glimpse of what a real Libertarian reception feels like.\u201d Michael Rectenwald, another Libertarian presidential candidate, said he believed the party achieved some gains by inviting Trump to the convention, pointing to the former president\u2019s commitment to commute Ulbricht\u2019s sentence. \u201cWe got a major political party candidate to say that he would free Ross Ulbricht,\u201d Rectenwald said at the news conference. \u201cWe moved the needle toward liberty.\u201d Still, Rectenwald acknowledged that Trump\u2019s remarks were unlikely to persuade Libertarians to vote for the former president. \u201cThere are no people in this room in the Libertarian Party at risk for falling for Trump\u2019s bullsh*t,\u201d he said. Trent Nestle, a Libertarian delegate from Tennessee, told CNN that Trump\u2019s pledge to commute Ulbricht\u2019s sentence wouldn\u2019t be enough to convince him to back the former president. \u201cI want to see it happen,\u201d Nestle said. \u201cIt won\u2019t change my vote in November.\u201d This story has been updated with additional developments.

{"id": "2024_05_22_us_california-half-moon-bay-farms-settlements", "text": "Two mushroom farms in Northern California agreed to pay more than $450,000 in back wages and damages for dozens of employees stemming from a federal work- and living-conditions investigation that started after seven people were fatally shot there in 2023, the US Department of Labor said this week. The investigation into California Terra Gardens and Concord Farms Inc. in Half Moon Bay found the employers underpaid workers and provided unsafe housing conditions with mold and insect infestation, the Labor Department said in a news release Monday. The back wages and damages are part of administrative settlements the department reached with the two farms for multiple violations of the\u00a0Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act\u00a0and the\u00a0Fair Labor Standards Act, the department said. \u201cOur investigators found workers at California Terra Gardens and Concord Farms housed in sickening conditions, forced to sleep near garbage and with insects all around,\u201d Alberto Raymond, the department\u2019s wage and hour division assistant district director, said in the release. At California Terra Gardens, investigators uncovered that 39 workers were housed in cramped cargo containers, garages and dilapidated trailers, according to the department. They were forced to sleep on filthy mattresses and were exposed to insects and trash, according to the labor department. The farm\u2019s owners deducted money from workers\u2019 pay for the substandard housing illegally, the department determined. Two miles away, investigators found workers at Concord Farms were housed in moldy, makeshift rooms in a greenhouse infested with insects, the department said. That farm\u2019s owner shortchanged workers by not paying overtime past 40 hours worked in a week, and by not paying for work off the clock, the department said. The federal investigation started after a shooting in which authorities allege a California Terra Gardens worker, Chunil Zhao, killed seven workers and injured another at the two farms on January 23, 2023. Zhao, a Chinese citizen who was 66 at the time, was arrested that month and pleaded not guilty this year to seven counts of first-degree murder and one count of attempted murder. He is awaiting trial. Zhao was a coworker or former coworker of the victims, and evidence indicated the attack was an instance of workplace violence in which specific people were targeted, the San Mateo County sheriff said at the time. After the shooting, officials including the state\u2019s governor criticized living conditions on the farms, and state and federal investigations into the conditions were launched. In June, the farms were cited by the California Division of Occupational Safety and Health for \u201cserious\u201d health and safety violations. Following the federal Labor Department investigation, Concord Farms agreed to pay $370,107 in overtime wages and liquidated damages to 10 workers, $4,242 in late wages to 23 workers and $29,049 in civil money penalties, the release said. California Terra Gardens agreed to pay $84,074 to 39 workers for illegal housing deductions and $42,494 in civil money penalties, the department said. CNN has sought comment from California Terra Gardens and Concord Farms. \u201cThe Department of Labor is determined to hold employers accountable when they ignore their legal responsibilities to provide suitable housing when required and pay workers all their legally earned wages for the hard work they do in difficult conditions,\u201d Raymond said. \u201cWe are committed to enforcing these workplace protections that ensure a safe and suitable living conditions for seasonal workers.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/us/california-half-moon-bay-farms-settlements/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/27/2024", "section": "us"}}

The priest, identified as Father Fidel Rodriguez, initially refused to give the woman Communion bread on May 19 and told her \u201cshe did not do the prior steps necessary\u201d to receive the bread when he encountered her at a Mass held earlier that day at St. Thomas Aquinas Catholic Church, according to police. A statement provided by the Diocese of Orlando states Rodriguez gave the woman a blessing at the 10 a.m. Mass and \u201cadvised her to receive the Sacrament of Penance (Confession) before coming back to receive Holy Communion (Eucharist).\u201d The woman told police she returned to the church for the noon Mass and informed the priest she had in fact done the necessary steps and \u201cis now accepted by God, thus, granting her the ability to participate in communion,\u201d the affidavit states. The priest asked the woman if she \u201chad been to the Sacrament of Penance (Confession), to which she stated it was not his business,\u201d according to the statement from the Diocese. The woman told police Rodriguez allegedly \u201cbecame upset and tried to ram the \u2018cookie\u2019 in her mouth,\u201d according to the affidavit. She said she then attempted to grab another Communion bread, which the priest was holding, when he grabbed and bit her arm, the affidavit states. \u201cFather Rodriguez offered the woman Holy Communion on the tongue. At that point, the woman forcefully placed her hand in the vessel and grabbed some sacred Communion hosts, crushing them,\u201d according to the Diocese\u2019s statement on the incident. \u201cHaving only one hand free, Father Rodriguez struggled to restrain the woman as she refused to let go of the hosts. When the woman pushed him and reacting to a perceived act of aggression, Father Rodriguez bit her hand so she would let go of the hosts she grabbed,\u201d the statement continued. The woman was asked to leave, according to the Diocese, which added the priest had not met her before. When interviewed by police, the priest told the investigating officer the woman had pushed him and \u201cwould not let go of the communion tray and the only way he thought to extract her from it was to bite her arm,\u201d according to the affidavit. \u201cIn the Catholic Tradition, the Eucharist is considered \u2018the source and summit\u2019 of worship and faith. The act of participation in Holy Communion therefore calls for a proper understanding, reverence, and devotion,\u201d the statement from the Diocese reads. \u201cIt is not something a person can arbitrarily demand and is certainly not a mere \u2018cookie\u2019 as the complainant called it,\u201d the statement adds. The woman refused medical attention and police photographed the bite mark, according to the affidavit. St. Cloud Police have forwarded the affidavit summary of events to the State Attorney\u2019s Office for review.

Daken paid off the entire meal debt and then some, for his elementary school in Blue Springs, Missouri, after turning in a check for more than $7,300. Daken\u2019s original goal was $3,500, which was just over\u00a0the total of the school\u2019s debt, according to Daken\u2019s mother, Vanessa Kramer. The remaining amount was given to Blue Springs High School, another school in the district. \u201cChildren in elementary school should not have debt tied to their name. We have found out that there are high schools that keep seniors from attending prom or walking at graduation if they have stuff like student lunch debt,\u201d Kramer said. \u201cSome families can\u2019t help it. They can\u2019t pay it off.\u201d In a video shared to his mom\u2019s Facebook, Daken had challenged \u201cfriends, family and local businesses to donate what they can to this cause.\u201d Upon Daken\u2019s request, Kramer reached out to Blue Springs School District to get information about the school\u2019s meal debt. Soon, the fundraiser was spreading to states like Texas, Florida and New Jersey. Within a matter of two weeks, Daken\u2019s fundraiser more than doubled his goal. As of Daken\u2019s fifth grade graduation on Tuesday, the Daken Kramer Legacy Award will now be an annual honor for fifth graders striving to make their own mark. \u201cYour selfless actions will impact dozens of students throughout the district,\u201d Kristi Haley, Daken\u2019s teacher, said as she announced the award in his name. \u201cIt\u2019s not the amount of money you raised, although that was absolutely incredible. It\u2019s your heart, your drive, your determination and your grit to help others that inspires us.\u201d Daken said the award took him aback. \u201cIt was definitely a surprise. I had no idea that they were going to do that,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I definitely started to feel a lot of emotions.\u201d A lunch for an elementary schooler in the Blue Springs School District is $2.55 \u2013 with the reduced price being 40 cents for students in need, according to the district. About 29% of the roughly 15,000 students enrolled in the Blue Springs School District are eligible for a free or reduced lunch, district spokesperson Katie Woolf told CNN Thursday. While Daken\u2019s fundraiser cleared his school\u2019s meal debt, the Blue Springs School District meal debt totals to more than $235,000, according to Woolf. The district includes 20 schools at varying levels. The School Nutrition Association reported among the school districts represented by their members \u2013 about one-fifth of US school districts nationwide \u2013 meal debt ranged from $10 to approximately $1 million, according to the school nutrition directors who are members of their organization and who responded to the association\u2019s 2024 survey. The association collected this data as a part of their lobbying effort to try to get more funding for school meal programs. In November 2023, the median reported district meal debt was about $5,495 among districts represented by members who responded to the survey, which was up from about $5,164 in the survey a year prior, according to the association. Hoping to bring wider attention to the issue of school meal debt, Kramer says she and Daken are now working with a Missouri state representative to see if they can take their efforts to the next level. Seeing the droves of people who reached out with support showed Kramer how one person can make a difference, she said. \u201cEven though this is something that kids don\u2019t need to worry about and don\u2019t have any responsibility (for), I\u2019m very, very proud as his mom that he is mature enough to see that there is an issue and if the people who have the power to make a change won\u2019t change anything, then he will step up and make a change,\u201d she said. Daken, whose favorite school lunch is an orange chicken and rice bowl, says kids don\u2019t have to do extraordinary things to be the next recipient of the Daken Kramer Legacy Award. \u201cThey don\u2019t really need to do anything big to get the award,\u201d Daken said. \u201cIt\u2019s only if they really care about it and they are really, really compassionate about helping the school.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/26/us/missouri-daken-kramer-school-lunch-debt/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/27/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_05_23_us_norfolk-southern-settlement-ohio-train-derailment", "text": "The Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Justice have reached a $310 million settlement agreement with Norfolk Southern after last year\u2019s train derailment that spilled more than a million pounds of hazardous chemicals into the soil, water and air in Ohio. \u201cIf the settlement is approved by the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, Norfolk Southern will be required to take measures to improve rail safety, pay for health monitoring and mental health services for the surrounding communities, fund long-term environmental monitoring, pay a $15 million civil penalty, and take other actions to protect nearby waterways and drinking water resources,\u201d the EPA said Thursday. The\u00a0February 2023\u00a0derailment ignited a dayslong inferno, spewed poisonous fumes into the air,\u00a0killed thousands of fish\u00a0and left residents wondering if it\u2019s safe to live in East Palestine. In the weeks following the disaster, officials said tests showed the air quality and municipal water were safe. But some residents reported a variety of health problems after the derailment, including rashes, nausea, bloody noses and trouble breathing. Thursday\u2019s announcement stems from a civil lawsuit filed in March 2023. The DOJ sued Norfolk Southern on behalf of the EPA, alleging violations of the Clean Water Act from the discharge of pollutants and hazardous materials into waters. Norfolk Southern issued a statement Thursday saying it has reached an agreement with the DOJ, the EPA and the US Department of the Interior \u201cto resolve all their claims and investigations arising from the derailment in East Palestine, Ohio.\u201d The agreement, which is subject to court approval, \u201cbuilds on the significant financial commitments that the company has already made,\u201d Norfolk Southern said. In fact, Norfolk Southern said the costs associated with the agreement \u201chave either been previously estimated \u2026 or are included as part of the company\u2019s ongoing financial outlook.\u201d When asked whether the $15 million civil penalty is enough, EPA Administrator Michael Regan told reporters Norfolk Southern is \u201cgoing above and beyond and actually doing things they had not planned to do,\u201d and \u201cso I think it is a strong step forward.\u201d What Norfolk Southern must do Under the settlement, the EPA said, Norfolk Southern has agreed to: \u2022 Spend an estimated $235 million for past and future costs to help ensure the company \u2013 not taxpayers \u2013 is on the hook for all cleanup costs \u2022 Pay a $15 million civil penalty to resolve the alleged violations of the Clean Water Act \u2022 Pay $25 million for a 20-year community health program that includes medical monitoring for qualified individuals, mental health services for those living in affected counties as well as first responders who worked at the site, and a community facilitation plan to help community members in using the benefits of the program \u2022 Spend about $15 million to implement long-term monitoring of groundwater and surface water for a period of 10 years \u2022 Pay $15 million for a private drinking water monitoring fund that will continue the existing private drinking water well monitoring program for 10 years \u2022 Implement a \u201cwaterways remediation plan,\u201d with an estimated budget of $6 million, for projects in Leslie Run and Sulphur Run that will prioritize addressing historical pollution, reduce non-point source pollution through infrastructure upgrades and stormwater management projects, and restore aquatic and riparian habitat \u2022 Pay $175,000 for natural resource damages to restore, rehabilitate, replace, or acquire the equivalent of the natural resources injured as a result of the derailment \u2022 Undertake projects to improve the safety of transporting hazardous materials by rail, including the installation of \u201cadditional devices to detect overheated wheel bearings early enough to prevent derailments like the one that happened in East Palestine,\u201d the EPA said. Company reaches $600M agreement for residents In addition to the federal civil lawsuit, Norfolk Southern has reached a tentative, $600 million settlement agreement that would resolve all lawsuits covering thousands of residents within 20 miles of the site of the derailment. The agreement, which needs final approval from a judge, would also resolve personal injury claims within a 10-mile radius from the derailment, Norfolk Southern said last month. \u201cIndividuals and businesses will be able to use compensation from the settlement in any manner they see fit to address potential adverse impacts from the derailment,\u201d the company said. \u201cThis could include healthcare needs and medical monitoring, property restoration and diminution, and compensation for any net business loss.\u201d But the settlement agreement does not \u201cconstitute any admission of liability, wrongdoing, or fault,\u201d Norfolk Southern said. This week, a judge gave preliminary approval for that settlement agreement. Now, lawyers for the plaintiffs will meet residents in the coming weeks to answer questions about the settlement and how residents can submit claims for compensation. Residents and businesses within 20 miles of the derailment should expect to hear from Kroll Settlement Administration, a third party hired to execute the paymentsr. Residents and businesses that want to file a claim must do so by August 22. A hearing for final approval of the settlement is scheduled for September 25. What caused the disaster, and what\u2019s next? The National Transportation Safety Board has been investigating the cause of the derailment and has posted hundreds of pages of reports, interview transcripts and other information related to the probe. So far, the investigation has focused on a failing, flaming wheel bearing. A preliminary NTSB report said sensors detected a wheel bearing heating up miles before it eventually failed and caused the train to derail. But the detectors didn\u2019t alert the crew until it was too late. NTSB board members will return to East Palestine next month to hold a public meeting and vote on the final findings, probable cause and recommendations. \u201cWe\u2019re not just going to focus on the immediate wheel bearing issue\u201d at the June 25 meeting, NTSB\u00a0Chairwoman Jennifer Homendy told CNN in February. \u201cWe\u2019re going to look at hazmat impacts to the community,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to make safety-critical recommendations to make sure communities don\u2019t have to live through that again.\u201d This story has been updated with additional information.

{"id": "2024_05_23_us_scottie-scheffler-arrest-update-louisville", "text": "Louisville police released two videos Thursday showing some of the arrest of star golfer Scottie Scheffler last week and announced the detective who arrested him was disciplined for not turning on his body-worn camera at the time. One video from a fixed pole camera positioned across the street shows portions of the interaction between Scheffler and police. In the video, a vehicle turns left and an officer wearing reflective gear runs toward the vehicle, which then stops. Police then take the driver out of the car and a group of three people walk across the street. A second video from a police vehicle\u2019s dashcam shows two officers walking with a handcuffed Scheffler. The videos were released a week after Scheffler was arrested, charged with felony assault, released from jail and then made his tee time in a whirlwind few hours at the PGA Championship, one of golf\u2019s four major tournaments. The world no. 1 golfer was attempting to drive to the Valhalla Golf Club in Louisville for the second round of the tournament at about 6 a.m. when he came to the scene of a fatal crash. He allegedly injured a police officer who was directing traffic and was arrested, according to police. Scheffler, 27, a new father with a sterling reputation, was charged with felony second-degree assault on a police officer, along with lesser charges of third-degree criminal mischief, reckless driving and disregarding signals from officers directing traffic, according to Jefferson County court records. After taking a mug shot and warming up in a jail cell, he was released and made it to his tee time at the golf club. He then shot 5-under that day on his way to finishing the tournament in a tie for 8th place. Scheffler described the incident as a \u201cbig misunderstanding\u201d during a \u201cchaotic situation.\u201d After the news conference Thursday, Scheffler\u2019s attorney, Steve Romines, reiterated the golfer still plans to plead not guilty to the charges. \u201cIt won\u2019t impact my case at all. Our position is the same as it was last Friday: Scottie Scheffler didn\u2019t do anything wrong. We\u2019re not interested in settling the case. We will either try it or it\u2019ll be dismissed. It\u2019s very simple,\u201d he said. \u201cAll the evidence that continues to come out just continues to support what Scottie said all along, this was a chaotic situation and a miscommunication and he didn\u2019t do anything wrong.\u201d High-ranking police officials in Louisville have privately voiced concerns a felony charge against Scheffler is excessive, a source familiar with the discussions told CNN. Prosecutors said Thursday they continue to investigate the case. \u201cThe Jefferson County Attorney\u2019s office has continued to receive evidence and has yet to conduct final interviews with investigators regarding the charges filed by LMPD against Mr. Scheffler,\u201d said Josh Abner, a spokesman for the office. \u201cAs we have stated previously, no decisions have been made and our review continues.\u201d Scheffler, meanwhile, teed off for his first round at the Charles Schwab Challenge in Fort Worth, Texas, on Thursday afternoon. Police discipline detective for not activating body-worn camera At a news conference Thursday, Louisville\u2019s mayor and police chief announced an internal investigation of the case led to discipline for the arresting officer, Detective Bryan Gillis. \u201cDetective Gillis should have turned on his body-worn camera, but did not,\u201d Police Chief Jacquelyn Gwinn-Villaroel said. \u201cHis failure to do so is a violation of the LMPD policy on uniforms and equipment, subject category body-worn camera.\u201d The police chief said Gillis did not have his body-worn camera \u201coperationally ready\u201d as required. The detective has received \u201ccorrective action,\u201d said the chief, who did not provide specifics about the discipline at the news conference. A Louisville police memo the department subsequently released Thursday said the detective \u201cwas counseled by a member of his command on May 22, 2024, and a performance observation was completed.\u201d The memo was among documents released related to the detective\u2019s failure to activate his body-worn camera. In one, Gillis explained he \u201cnever powered up\u201d the camera and described his own version of what happened. \u201cWhile directing traffic in front of Gate 1 the PGA personnel stopped a bus from entering Gate 1,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI observed a vehicle traveling in the opposing lanes coming at me. I stopped the driver and advised him he could not proceed because of the bus. He demanded to be let in, and proceeded forward against my directions. I was dragged/knocked down by the driver. I then proceeded to arrest the driver.\u201d Neither Mayor Craig Greenberg nor the police chief took questions from the media at Thursday\u2019s news conference. \u201cActivating body-worn cameras is critically important for our police department to have evidence, to maintain community trust, to be transparent,\u201d Greenberg said. Documents obtained by CNN show Gillis has a history of both reprimands and suspensions within the police department. Gillis, who began his service in 2007,\u00a0has received six reprimands throughout his time with Louisville police, a disciplinary history report shows.\u00a0He has also been suspended on five separate occasions. None of Gillis\u2019 prior suspensions involved failing to turn on his body-worn camera. Records also show Gillis has received several commendations during his career, including back-to-back Meritorious Unit Citations in 2019. The detective\u2019s longest suspension at five days stems from a 2012 incident in which\u00a0Gillis allegedly drove an \u201cintoxicated civilian\u201d in his police vehicle while doing \u201cdonuts\u201d in a business parking lot while his emergency lights were illuminated, according to a 2013 LMPD document. More recently, in 2021, Gillis received a written reprimand for pursuing \u201ca vehicle that did not commit a violent felony or wanted on a warrant,\u201d\u00a0documents show. Additionally, Gillis did not tell dispatchers he was engaging in a vehicle pursuit at the time, according to LMPD documents. The year prior, in 2012, he faced a four-day suspension for failing to appear in court on multiple occasions between 2010 and 2011. Documents show Gillis was also found \u201cat fault\u201d for three crashes, for which he received reprimands and mandatory driver\u2019s training. CNN has reached out to the Louisville Police Department for comment and was told \u201cas this matter is before the courts, commenting further on the participants (defendants, witnesses, and victims alike) is not appropriate for us to do.\u201d Gillis did not immediately respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment Friday. CNN has also reached out to\u00a0the River City Fraternal Order of Police Lodge 614, the union representing LMPD detectives, for comment on Gillis\u2019 past conduct. What we know about the arrest According to a Louisville Metro Police report, Scheffler was trying to drive into the golf course when he was stopped by an officer wearing a full police uniform and a yellow reflective rain jacket. The officer, identified as Gillis, stopped Scheffler and \u201cattempted to give instructions,\u201d the report states. \u201cSubject refused to comply and accelerated forward, dragging Detective Gillis to the ground,\u201d according to the report. The detective suffered pain, swelling and abrasions to his left wrist and knee and was taken to the hospital for further treatment, the report states. His uniform pants, valued at about $80, \u201cwere damaged beyond repair,\u201d the report adds. Romines, Scheffler\u2019s attorney, said the golfer was headed to the course early to prepare to play. \u201cDue to the combination of event traffic and a traffic fatality in the area, it was a very chaotic situation. He was proceeding as directed by another traffic officer and driving a marked player\u2019s vehicle with credentials visible,\u201d Romines said in a statement. \u201cIn the confusion, Scottie is alleged to have disregarded a different officer\u2019s traffic signals resulting in these charges.\u201d Multiple eyewitnesses have said Scheffler \u201cdid not do anything wrong\u201d but drove as directed, according to Romines. \u201cHe stopped immediately upon being directed to and never at any point assaulted any officer with his vehicle,\u201d the statement reads. ESPN\u2019s Jeff Darlington witnessed the encounter and filmed part of it. When Scheffler arrived in a marked player courtesy vehicle, he tried to drive around the crash scene on a median, according to ESPN. Darlington wrote on social media Scheffler \u201ccontinued to drive about 10 to 20 yards toward the entrance\u201d before stopping. \u201cThe police officer attempted to attach himself to Scheffler\u2019s car, and Scheffler then stopped his vehicle at the entrance to Valhalla,\u201d Darlington\u00a0wrote on X. \u201cThe police officer then began to scream at Scheffler to get out of the car. When Scheffler exited the vehicle, the officer shoved Scheffler against the car and immediately placed him in handcuffs.\u201d Police escorted a handcuffed Scheffler into a police vehicle, Darlington\u2019s video shows. \u201cRight now he\u2019s going to jail,\u201d an officer at the scene says in the video. Scheffler\u2019s arraignment was originally scheduled for Tuesday but was delayed to June due to his attorney\u2019s scheduling issue.

The girls, who were attacked at a movie theater, suffered non-life-threatening injuries and were taken to Boston hospitals for treatment, according to police in Braintree. A 21-year-old woman and a 29-year-old man who were stabbed about an hour later at a Plymouth McDonald\u2019s were taken to hospitals with non-life-threatening injuries. Separately, Connecticut State Police said a suspect linked to a death there had been taken into custody in Massachusetts. Police in neither state have confirmed whether the Connecticut case is connected to those in Massachusetts. While the two attacks happened about an hour apart in different towns, it \u201cappears as though the crimes are related,\u201d Braintree police said in a news release, noting the four girls were stabbed without warning in an AMC Theater around 6 p.m. The theater was placed in lockdown shortly after the incident, an AMC employee told CNN. \u201cWithout saying anything and without any warning, he suddenly attacked and stabbed the four young females,\u201d police said of the suspect. \u201cThe attack appeared to be unprovoked. After the attack, the man ran out of the theater and left in a vehicle.\u201d Police discovered the suspect had left the theater in what appeared to be a black SUV, and video footage allowed authorities to capture its license plate, the release says. A vehicle matching the description was \u201creportedly involved in similar assault in Plymouth,\u201d which is about a 30-minute drive south of Braintree, police said. About an hour after the first attack, around 7:04 p.m., police were called to a reported stabbing at a McDonald\u2019s in Plymouth, according to a news release from Massachusetts State Police. State troopers soon located a vehicle matching the description of one driven by the suspect, state police said, but it failed to stop when state troopers tried to pull it over. Massachusetts State Police chased the vehicle, which ended in a crash in Sandwich, about a 25-minute drive south of Plymouth, according to police. \u201cPreliminary investigation suggests a likely connection to an earlier incident at a movie theatre in Braintree resulting in non-life threatening injuries to four juveniles,\u201d state police said. The suspect, who has not been identified, is being treated at an area hospital, state police said. The investigation remains \u201cactive and ongoing\u201d by state and local police, the release said. In the meantime, police in Connecticut are investigating a death in the town of Deep River. In a statement released late Saturday, Connecticut State Police said they responded Saturday afternoon to a \u201cdisturbance\u201d at an address within the town. There, police found a \u201cdeceased individual\u201d whose identity has not been confirmed, Connecticut State Police said. \u201cA suspect in this investigation has been taken into custody in the State of Massachusetts and there is no active threat to the public,\u201d the release said.

{"id": "2024_05_23_us_katrina-twins-graduate-honore", "text": "The milestone unfolding here this week would have seemed unfathomable in the chaos nearly 19 years ago, when the US Army lieutenant general with the booming voice first met the twin babies. The infant boys were starving and dehydrated, nearly limp in the suffocating heat in the days after Hurricane Katrina defeated New Orleans\u2019 levee system, flooded its streets and killed many of the 1,392 people across the region who\u2019d ultimately succumb to its horrors. Their mom, Alexandria Wheeler, had run out of formula to feed them and so decided finally to venture out for help that by then clearly wasn\u2019t coming for her. \u201cIt was like being in a third world country on United States soil,\u201d she recalled to CNN. She walked a long time to get to dry land. Then, she saw him: combat uniform, black beret, aviator glasses. \u201cThis man comes around the corner to our rescue,\u201d Wheeler said of a moment that soon would become an icon of the Crescent City\u2019s freshly ravaged streets. \u201cIt was like God just coming in, stepping in out of nowhere.\u201d Lt. Gen. Russel Honor\u00e9 and his crew quickly scooped up A\u2019Mari and J\u2019Mari Reynolds, each in nothing but a diaper and a tiny navy baseball cap. The encounter didn\u2019t last long, but it would prove momentous: a young family\u2019s first step toward a future that would include another flood but also many bright twists before the latest chapter came into focus hundreds of miles away with the Reynolds twins again poised to meet Honor\u00e9. This time they wore navy mortarboards and matching gowns as they got ready to line up for their graduation from Eagle\u2019s Landing High School near Atlanta. But first, they had to take a video call, one almost two decades in the making. Before they walked across the stage Wednesday to collect their diplomas, they had to deliver a message to a certain Bronze Star recipient \u2013 now 76 and retired \u2013 about how grateful they were to him. They had to tell him how his legacy was now wrapped up in the plans they had for their own futures. Their mom wanted to see his face when they told him. A\u2019Mari and J\u2019Mari stared at the laptop on a picnic table near the commencement venue when his image blinked onto the screen from Louisiana: open collar, dark suspenders, a few more creases around his brown eyes. \u201cWow! Nineteen years ago, boys! Now, look at you two young men,\u201d Honor\u00e9 said before diving right back to the moment they met: \u201cYou were toddlers on Poydras and Convention street when your mom was walking down the street with you, one in each arm. \u201cAnd as we walked up toward her, myself and two soldiers, she started to lower her arms,\u201d he told them. \u201cShe had become exhausted from carrying you.\u201d \u2018Put those weapons down, dammit!\u2019 In those desperate, sweltering, early days of New Orleans\u2019 great flood of 2005, Wheeler \u2013 like so many survivors \u2013 had been far more concerned for her children than herself. \u201cWe hadn\u2019t eaten in maybe six days\u201d when the mother started making her way to the makeshift shelter at the Superdome \u2013 one 6 \u00bd-month-old strapped to her chest, the other on her back. Wheeler waded through murky water that hid horrors, including one she bumped under the surface: \u201cIt was two bodies, collided,\u201d she told CNN a few years later. \u201cTheir arms were stretched out. They were full of water, and they raised up to the top from me lifting my leg up.\u201d When mom and boys finally made it to the stadium, though, supplies were scant. So, a desperate Wheeler headed to Harrah\u2019s casino a couple blocks away. But military personnel with guns drawn stopped them. Terror and confusion hit Wheeler. \u201cWe\u2019re the victims,\u201d she recalled thinking. \u201cWhat are you pulling guns on us for?\u201d That\u2019s when she first heard his voice: \u201cPut those weapons down, dammit!\u201d It was Honor\u00e9, the Louisiana native dispatched to lead the Defense Department\u2019s response to Hurricanes Katrina and soon Rita; CNN cameras captured the moment. \u201cHe was like God\u2019s angel,\u201d Wheeler said. Firearm barrels lowered. Then, Honor\u00e9 saw the mom with her tiny sons: \u201cMe and my team, I knew we had to reach out and help these babies.\u201d \u2018There\u2019s no question. We would have died\u2019 Their rescue, in Honor\u00e9\u2019s view, had been fate: In a city without drinkable water or electricity, a US Coast Guard vessel had docked just two blocks away; a medevac aircraft was available; and a system was in place to spirit the most dire patients to Louisiana\u2019s capital, then on to Texas, for aid. \u201cThis was meant to happen,\u201d he said, hesitating even to imagine an alternative too \u201cunconscionable to think about.\u201d The lieutenant general then spent about four hours with Wheeler and her twins, cradling A\u2019Mari and J\u2019Mari before the family was en route to San Antonio, she said. \u201cThey were completely dehydrated. Their veins \u2013 everything \u2013 it was really hard for them to put in IVs,\u201d Wheeler recalled, adding her sons were in the hospital for a week and a half. \u201cA\u2019Mari actually coded blue, and then J\u2019Mari went directly after him.\u201d Honor\u00e9 is the only reason they made it, Wheeler said. She is sure of it. \u201cWe would have died,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s no question. We would have died.\u201d Meanwhile, Honor\u00e9\u2019s encounter with the Reynolds twins left him \u201cinspired \u2026 to move faster,\u201d he said this week. \u201cWe had to do this quicker, faster, better \u2026 because I knew that there would be other babies out there that were not as lucky as us to have this moment where all things came together.\u201d \u2018You guys grew up in 12 years!\u2019 A\u2019Mari and J\u2019Mari grew up recounting the story of their deliverance, telling and retelling it with their mom and watching and rewatching the video of their tiny selves getting handed to Honor\u00e9 and his team before their flight to safety. But it would take another dozen years \u2013 and another monster storm \u2013 to give the boys and their mother the chance to thank Honor\u00e9 for all he\u2019d done to help them. Hurricane Harvey threatened the family\u2019s Houston apartment in 2017 as it directly killed 68 people in Texas and did more than $150 billion in damage. The storm\u2019s aftermath also drew a certain lieutenant general, by then retired but still vocal about how best to respond to the changing climate\u2019s power to destroy \u2013 and still known for leading with his heart. Thankfully, Harvey\u2019s water didn\u2019t enter Wheeler\u2019s home. But when she heard Honor\u00e9 was in Texas, she sent him a message on social media. He responded. The four of them reunited, with the twins rushing to the military man to thank him \u201cfor saving our lives.\u201d Honor\u00e9 put his arms around them all. \u201cBoy, you guys grew up in 12 years!\u201d he said. Then, the decorated soldier \u2013 with degrees from Southern University and A&M College and Troy State University \u2013 quizzed the twins in a key category for middle school students, cultivating a seed already taking root in their young minds: Where did they plan to go to college? Though the boys and Honor\u00e9 stayed in touch from then on, it would be another seven years before they could give him answers to that critical question. \u2018Why I\u2019m still standing here today\u2019 Sitting at the picnic table outside Atlanta in their graduation gowns, the Reynolds twins leaned into the laptop screen Wednesday to speak directly to the man whose lessons they\u2019d begun to learn long before either could remember. A\u2019Mari spoke to Honor\u00e9 first: \u201cI would like to take a moment to give you my deepest gratitudes because your kindness, commitment and bravery during Hurricane Katrina is the reason why I\u2019m still standing here today. \u201cThanks to you, it inspired me,\u201d he said, \u201cand you played a pivotal role in my life, and thanks to you, I\u2019ll be a future addition to the United States Marine Corps.\u201d \u201cOoh-rah!\u201d the career Army man responded with the other branch\u2019s battle cry. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna learn how to say that word: Ooh-rah. \u201cCongratulations,\u201d he continued. \u201cThat\u2019s a great move. Best marines in the world. You\u2019re going to a great outfit, and you\u2019ll come out stronger than you went in.\u201d Next up was J\u2019Mari: \u201cI would also like to \u2026 thank you so much for your bravery and your help that I was able to survive. You gave me at least a bunch of hope that there\u2019s still good in the world, and it gave me a chance to change mentally and physically, where I would be nice to other people, I would help others in need of help. \u201cI\u2019m going to college to do automotive engineering,\u201d he declared. \u201cI want to help other people and make sure everything is safe for them.\u201d Honor\u00e9 retook the floor \u2013 and again raised the stakes: \u201cWell, thank you and good luck. I look forward to you inventing things that will make the world safer from climate change \u2026 because the opportunities are there to change the world with the education you\u2019re gonna get and help save the planet.\u201d Wheeler, for her part, watched it all unfold, including the look on the retired lieutenant general\u2019s face. He also had a message for her: \u201cYou done good!\u201d he told A\u2019Mari\u2019s and J\u2019Mari\u2019s mom. \u201cThey\u2019re here today because of you and your tenacity and your willingness to fight for them. \u201cWhen we saw you on the streets of New Orleans, you motivated the entire United States military to do more and do it quicker and do it better. We are here with admiration today because you inspired us.\u201d Wheeler thanked him, too \u2013 for insisting those soldiers put down their guns, for affirming their survival in Houston, for \u201cchanging our lives forever.\u201d They could never find words enough to thank him, she said, or do enough to repay him. The score, however, didn\u2019t seem like one that needed settling. The first steps of the paths the Reynolds twins now had chosen might well have been lain right there at the corner of Poydras Street, when their exhausted mom happened upon an angel in fatigues. \u201cI feel so gratified,\u201d Honor\u00e9 said. \u201cThe engineer \u2026 can have the capability to change the world, and the Marine that\u2019s going into national service to help protect our freedom and our democracy. \u201cThese young men,\u201d the retired Army man said of the babies he once saved from the teeth of a deadly flood, \u201cwill be game changers.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/23/us/katrina-twins-graduate-honore/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/27/2024", "section": "us"}}

{"id": "2024_05_22_us_uvalde-school-district-police-chief-resignation", "text": "The chief of police for Uvalde schools has submitted his resignation more than a year after he replaced the man who held the position during the 2022 school massacre in the Texas city, according to a school official\u2019s statement obtained by CNN affiliate KSAT Tuesday. The resignation of Joshua Gutierrez, chief of police for the Uvalde Consolidated Independent School District, will be presented for approval at a June 17 school board meeting, according to district spokesperson Anne Marie Espinoza. If approved, his last day will be June 26, according to the KSAT report. Details about the reasons for the resignation weren\u2019t immediately available. CNN has sought comment from Gutierrez and the school district. \u201cWe thank Chief Gutierrez for his dedicated leadership and guidance in reestablishing the Uvalde CISD Police Department,\u201d Espinoza said in the statement. \u201cHis contributions have been instrumental in enhancing the safety and well-being of our students, staff, and school community.\u201d Gutierrez replaced Pete Arredondo, who was fired in August 2022 following scrutiny of his actions during the May 2022 shooting in which 19 students and two teachers were killed at Robb Elementary School. Law enforcement officers waited more than an hour before entering adjoining classrooms where the gunman was and killing him. A US Department of Justice report said officers had many opportunities to intervene to stop the bloodshed far earlier. Arredondo was\u00a0seen on police body-worn cameras\u00a0giving orders and receiving information during the response, but he has said he did not see himself as the incident commander. Gutierrez was approved unanimously as the interim police chief in November 2022, and was named\u00a0permanent\u00a0chief in March 2023. \u201cThis is our first step (we are) taking to rebuild our school district police force,\u201d Gary Patterson, then the interim superintendent, said when Gutierrez was named interim chief. As interim police chief, Gutierrez focused on hiring qualified officers, conducting tactical cross-training with local law enforcement and engaging students and the community, according to KSAT, which reported he\u2019d previously worked at several other school districts. \u201cI have the ability to come out here and help the community heal, help our community heal, and the abilities to reestablish a good foundation for our police department,\u201d Gutierrez said in December 2022, according to KSAT. The district has begun a search to replace Gutierrez and has posted the job on its website. \u201cUnder general supervision, this officer performs tasks related to ensuring the safety of UCISD students, staff, and visitors,\u201d the posting says. \u201cAdditionally, the officer provides classroom presentations, counsels students and parents, engages students through mentoring, and serves as a positive role model to help promote healthy relationships between youth and law enforcement.\u201d Among the requirements for the position, the district is looking for someone with a minimum of five years of senior level experience directing law enforcement operations, according to the posting. A candidate should have the \u201cability to effectively deal with personal danger which may include sudden exposure to armed persons,\u201d the posting says. \u201cWe are committed to finding a successor who will continue to uphold the standards of safety and security that our school community deserves,\u201d Espinoza said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/us/uvalde-school-district-police-chief-resignation/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/27/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_05_24_business_nissan-suv-driveway-explosion", "text": "In the early morning of May 14, Vicki Hill was startled awake by the sound of explosions outside her home in Bethesda, Maryland. The loud bangs, she learned later, had come from the airbags of the family\u2019s SUV, a 2015 Nissan Murano that was parked in the driveway. It was on fire. \u201cI thought someone was trying to get into our house with a sledgehammer and I woke my husband up and I said something\u2019s wrong,\u201d she told CNN. \u201cAnd he ran downstairs and shouted up, \u2018Call 911, the car\u2019s on fire!\u2019\u201d Video from the home\u2019s doorbell camera,\u00a0which the family provided to CNN,\u00a0shows smoke before the fire erupts and then\u00a0engulfs the car. The cause of the fire in the Murano remains unknown. The fire is\u00a0under investigation\u00a0by Nissan. The National Highway Traffic Administration is gathering information\u00a0on the fire, as well. \u201cThe safety and security of our customers is our primary concern,\u201d a Nissan spokesperson said in a statement in response to an email asking about the fire. \u201cWe have opened an investigation into this incident.\u201d The\u00a0Hills\u2019 Murano was recalled by Nissan\u00a0in 2016 and 2019, to fix a problem that could allow brake fluid to leak and start a fire, even while the vehicle is parked. At the time, owners were warned to park their vehicles outside and away from buildings until the issue was repaired because of fire risks. A search on NHTSA\u2019s website indicated there was an outstanding unrepaired recall on the Hills\u2019 Murano. The couple said a local fire investigator suggested the unrepaired recall could have caused the fire. But the Hills remember getting the work done and provided CNN with a photograph of the receipt from a local Nissan dealership that showed the repair was made. CNN has not confirmed whether the receipt is authentic. The Hills said that because the recall work had been done, the possibility of a fire wasn\u2019t something that crossed their minds. Philip Hill had been fixing the garage, so the couple\u2019s two cars were parked in the driveway. Otherwise, the Murano would have been parked inside the garage adjoining the house. \u201cAs you can see from the video, that vehicle is so close to the house,\u201d Philip Hill told CNN. \u201cMinutes later, the house could have gone up.\u201d As it was, the garage door melted from the flames, they said. The Hills credit a neighbor\u2019s dog with saving them and their three children. The neighbor was able to call 911 before the Hills, after being alerted by her dog. The intense flames from the burning Nissan also damaged the side of the family\u2019s other car, a 2012 Mercedes C-class, leaving it unusable. Initially, the Hills were concerned they might have been victims of vandalism. But\u00a0they said\u00a0the video footage from their Nest doorbell camera\u00a0clearly\u00a0showed the vehicle spontaneously combusting. Nissan took possession of the Murano on Wednesday to study it more closely, the Hills said. As surprising as the Hills\u2019 situation may seem, vehicle fires are not uncommon. In 2022, an estimated 188,500 car and truck fires blazed in the United States, an average of more than 500 a day, according to the National Fire Protection Association. Vehicle fires caused 610 civilian deaths that year, according the NFPA.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/24/business/nissan-suv-driveway-explosion/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/27/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_05_26_us_alexander-williams-wrongful-execution-lawsuit-reaj", "text": "For 85 years Susie Williams Carter believed her brother was guilty of the crime he\u2019d been convicted of and executed for: A brutal murder of a White woman at a Pennsylvania youth detention center. In 1931, Alexander McClay Williams became the youngest person to be executed in Pennsylvania, when his death sentence was carried out by electric chair at the age of 16. Alexander was convicted of murdering Vida Robare, the matron\u00a0at the Glen Mills School, a\u00a0youth detention facility where he was housed located just outside of Philadelphia. Carter, who was a year old at the time of her brother\u2019s execution, told CNN her family rarely discussed Alexander as it was painful for her mother and father to relive the anguish and heartbreak of his execution. But in 2015, all that changed. That\u2019s when Carter, the only living sibling of the family of 13 children, was presented with evidence that shifted an image she held of her brother\u00a0for decades. Now, more than 90 years after his execution, Carter and her family\u00a0are suing the county for damages, alleging that Alexander was \u201cimproperly arrested and subjected to the horrors of imprisonment, unfairly tried, wrongfully convicted and ultimately executed in the electric chair for a crime he did not commit,\u201d according to the lawsuit filed last week in the district court for eastern Pennsylvania. CNN has reached out to the district attorney\u2019s office for comment on the lawsuit. Carter, who is 94,\u00a0told CNN she wants to raise awareness that wrongful convictions continue to plague young\u00a0people of color across the US.  \u201cI want them (the public) to realize that these things are still going on,\u201d Carter said. \u201cSomething should be done to stop it.\u201d \u2018They made no effort to hide what they did\u2019 On Oct. 3, 1930, Robare\u2019s body was discovered by her ex-husband Fred, who also worked at the Glen Mills School, according to the\u00a0complaint. She \u201chad been stabbed 47 times with an ice pick and suffered two broken ribs and a skull fracture,\u201d according to the Death Penalty Information Center, a nonprofit that maintains an extensive database on capital punishment cases in the United States. \u00a0\u00a0A local newspaper, The Chester Times, \u201creported that district attorneys and detectives had reviewed the ranks of Glenn Mills\u2019 students and decided to question\u201d Alexander, according to the complaint. It\u2019s unclear why he was singled out from the group. William Ridley, the first African American admitted to the Bar of Delaware County, represented Alexander at trial. \u00a0His great-grandson, Sam Lemon, told CNN he\u2019s been enthralled by Ridley\u2019s trailblazing career since he was a child. So much so, he lives in Ridley\u2019s home in Media, Pennsylvania, about 20 miles outside of Philadelphia. \u201cI wanted to know, why did he (Ridley) lose probably the most important law case of his entire legal career?\u201d Lemon said. \u201cIt was a little bit of a debt of honor, trying to figure out why that was and (find) some way to see if I could explain that to the Williams family or make that better.\u201d So, in 1989 Lemon began writing letters, collecting documentation and visiting the Philadelphia Historical Society to view archival records about the case. He\u00a0acquired death certificates and digested genealogy through ancestry archives \u2013 all to better understand how Alexander was convicted.  As he researched, Lemon found the 1930 death certificate from the prison doctor and, he said, it appeared someone had altered the boy\u2019s age to make it read that he was 18 years old when he was, in fact, 16. \u201cBut they forgot to change the birth year to make the math work,\u201d Lemon said. Lemon said he also noticed it listed the day she died as Oct. 3 and an autopsy was completed the following day. Robare\u2019s cause of death was written in black ink: \u201cpuncture wounds of the heart,\u201d a document in the family\u2019s complaint shows. But somebody, in what appears to be different handwriting, wrote \u201ccaused by ice pick in the hands of Alexander McClay Williams\u201d in blue ink, Lemon said. But Alexander hadn\u2019t been convicted yet.\u00a0The complaint notes this discrepancy as well. Reading over the document made him nauseous, Lemon said. \u201cIt made me physically ill; I thought I was gonna have to reach for a trash can,\u201d he said. There weren\u2019t any eyewitnesses to the crime or physical or forensic evidence that connected Alexander with the murder, the complaint states. An\u00a0adult\u2019s\u00a0bloody handprint was found at the murder scene, but\u00a0that evidence was not introduced at trial and an officer later testified that he did not observe any blood on Alexander, according to the complaint.  But, Lemon said, it wasn\u2019t until he reviewed the original 300-page transcript from the trial that all the pieces fell into place. \u201cWhen I read that, it was just stunning,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cBut what really astonished me was, they made no effort to hide what they did.\u201d On the day of the murder, a school officer asked Alexander and another boy to get shovels that were \u201clocated between one and two blocks away.\u201d He then asked Alexander run a separate errand \u2013 a task that the officer said took the boy 20 minutes to complete, according to the complaint. At trial, the Commonwealth argued that within those 20 minutes, Alexander committed the murder, according to the complaint. Lemon said when he outlined all\u00a0the teen was accused of doing within that short time frame he counted 15 separate actions. \u201cThat\u2019s when I hit this eureka moment that this was impossible,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, I started doing\u00a0these walking tests, time trials around my hometown in Media and I measured distances with my car and a stopwatch, and it came to me that it was just impossible. It was impossible for him to do all these things in 20 minutes and then go back to work without any blood on him whatsoever.\u201d After two decades of research, Lemon decided he had collected enough information to present his findings to Carter and her family. He prepared a 45-minute PowerPoint presentation for the Williams family, who listened politely and quietly in the living room of a family home, he said, as he revealed why he believed Alexander was wrongfully convicted. \u201cThey were kind of stunned because they didn\u2019t know about this stuff,\u201d Lemon said. Lemon made a promise to Carter and her family that he was going to help them clear Alexander\u2019s name. \u201cThere was a lot of shame associated with the family in addition to kind of having to suffer in silence,\u201d Lemon said. \u201cI feel honored that these people took this stranger out of the blue and trusted me, talking about probably the most important family memory that they had and an extremely painful one at that.\u201d \u2018We cannot undo the past\u2019 It took more than two weeks for Alexander to be appointed an attorney, during which time he was interrogated at least five times \u201cwithout the benefit of an attorney or parent present,\u201d according to the complaint. Alexander initially denied involvement\u00a0but eventually\u00a0\u201cconfessed\u201d to the crime\u00a0three times,\u00a0but the complaint alleges the confessions were coerced. At trial, Alexander \u201cfaced an all-White jury, which found him guilty in less than four hours,\u201d according to a 2022 statement from the county\u2019s district attorney\u2019s office. In 2017, the case against Alexander Williams was reopened\u00a0thanks to the legal advocacy from Lemon and attorney Robert Keller, who posthumously represented the teen in court proceedings as Lemon and the family sought to overturn his conviction. In June 2022,\u00a0a judge from the Delaware County Court of Common Pleas\u00a0ordered a retrial\u00a0and the Delaware County District Attorney\u2019s office declined to bring the case. The case was dismissed in, \u201can acknowledgement that the charges against him should never have been brought,\u201d according to the statement from the district attorney\u2019s office at the time. \u201cSadly, we cannot undo the past,\u201d District Attorney Jack Stollsteimer said in the statement. \u201cWe cannot rewrite history to erase the egregious wrongs of our forebearers. However, when, as here, justice can be served by publicly acknowledging such a wrong, we must seize that opportunity.\u201d In October 2022 \u2013 more than 90 years after he was sentenced to death \u2013 Alexander was exonerated by then-Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf, according to the Philadelphia Inquirer. More than 150 people were exonerated in the US in 2023. Of those, nearly 84% were people of color, nearly 61% of the exonerees were Black and the most frequent factor in the exonerations\u00a0was official misconduct, according to data from The National Registry of Exonerations. The Emmett Till Legacy Foundation, which honors the memory of the 14-year-old Black teen who was\u00a0kidnapped, brutally beaten and\u00a0murdered in 1955\u00a0by two White men\u00a0after he was accused of assaulting a White woman,\u00a0offered a statement of support to the Williams family, saying they are inspired by their \u201clong and overdue quest for truth, justice and accountability.\u201d \u201cNo family should endure the type of historical and generational trauma that their family, ours and so many others have experienced for this long,\u201d the statement said. \u201cUnfortunately, it is a continuous throughline of injustice, across this country that still impacts us today.\u201d Carter said she has continued to\u00a0fight to clear her brother\u2019s name \u2013 even after all this time \u2013 because she wants to raise awareness that what happened to him, continues to happen to others. She imagined her parents sitting through her brother\u2019s trial with great difficulty, hearing about the things Alexander was accused of doing, knowing that their son was innocent. \u201cAnd yet (the commonwealth) let him die,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s a terrible thing to do a family.\u201d CNN\u2019s Justin Gamble contributed to this report.

{"id": "2024_05_26_politics_democrats-immigration-border-security-elections", "text": "Laura Grant has been keeping tabs on what Congress has done \u2013 or not done \u2013 to overhaul US immigration and border policy. The 47-year-old insurance agent said she\u2019s concerned about the deteriorating situation at the border.\u00a0The Phoenix resident\u00a0wants a more streamlined process for migrants but said she doesn\u2019t trust either party to solve the issue. Democrats didn\u2019t seem to grasp the severity of the situation, she said. And Republicans rejected a bipartisan border security bill she supported. \u201cI just don\u2019t know what their agenda is anymore,\u201d Grant told CNN during a recent interview at her home\u00a0here.\u00a0\u201cThey\u2019re for it. They\u2019re not for it. So we\u2019re just kind of in the middle now.\u201d Ahead of the November election, President Joe Biden and many Democratic campaigns are hoping to chip away at what polls have shown is a Republican\u00a0advantage on immigration, particularly in battleground states such as Arizona. The centerpiece of Democrats\u2019 approach has been the bipartisan border bill.\u00a0In February, Republicans blocked a border deal and foreign aid package\u00a0despite\u00a0demanding last year that Democrats pair border security with Ukraine aid. The border security legislation, which failed for a second time in the Senate last week in a vote GOP senators called a political stunt, has given Democrats a concrete example to point to as they seek to portray Republicans as unwilling to address the issue. But the strategy, an effort to triangulate between liberal and conservative policies to appeal directly to results-driven voters, has also reignited an ongoing debate within the Democratic coalition over how to address migration and the border. Democratic campaigns, which have mostly been on defense on immigration policy\u00a0since Donald Trump entered the political scene, have pointed to New York Rep. Tom Suozzi\u2019s February special election win as a sign that campaigning on border security as well as legal pathways for migration is a winning approach for the party.\u00a0Polling has also shown\u00a0voters\u00a0want Congress to pass\u00a0the bipartisan border deal. But some members of the Democratic coalition \u2013 including progressives, members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus who were excluded from negotiations over the border bill and migrant advocacy groups in swing states \u2013 have warned that Democrats need to emphasize pro-immigrant policies to draw a clear contrast with Republicans.\u00a0They have argued for a course correction from the party and a bigger push toward work permits for long-term residents. Both sides of the debate argue their approach is key to helping Biden win, particularly in swing states like Arizona, where immigration is top of mind for voters and polling has shown Biden trailing Trump. Alejandra Gomez, the executive director of Living United for Change in AZ, or LUCHA, said it would be difficult for her organization\u2019s canvassers to talk to voters about Biden\u2019s immigration policies. For now, the organization is focusing on down ballot races and local issues. But Gomez also framed the\u00a02024\u00a0election as a binary choice. \u201cThere is accountability that has to happen, but that accountability won\u2019t exist under a Trump administration,\u201d she said. Grant, who was visited by a LUCHA canvasser knocking on doors for US House candidate Raquel Ter\u00e1n on a recent Friday, said she would ultimately vote for Biden because of his stance on abortion rights. Arizona lawmakers recently repealed a near-total abortion ban and advocates are gathering signatures for a ballot initiative that would enshrine abortion rights in the state Constitution. Damon, a 57-year-old Phoenix resident and Department of Veterans Affairs employee who declined to give his last name, also cited abortion as a reason he plans to vote for Biden in an interview after a visit from a LUCHA canvasser. But he said he felt Biden had waited too long into his presidency to take action on the border. \u201cIf we\u2019re going to cut right to the chase here, I think he lost the election for us already,\u201d he said. A binary choice Ahead of next month\u2019s first presidential debate, mainstream Democrats are doubling down on\u00a0a\u00a0border security-focused strategy and the effort to shift blame to Republicans. \u201cTrump killed it \u2013 not once, but twice,\u201d Biden campaign spokeswoman Fabiola Rodriguez said in a statement to CNN after Thursday\u2019s vote. A recent memo from House Democrats\u2019 campaign arm said candidates would go \u201con the offensive against disingenuous far-right political attacks from Republicans\u201d on border policy. House Republicans have said the bipartisan border proposal doesn\u2019t go far enough but have also signaled a reluctance to grant Biden an election year victory. Trump said earlier this year that a border deal now would be a political \u201cgift\u201d for Democrats. The White House is considering other options to display a tougher stance on migration, including sending Biden to visit the border and issuing a new executive order limiting asylum claims,\u00a0CNN reported earlier this month. \u201cWhat the average American wants, including the average Latino, is a well secured and well managed border,\u201d said Matt Barreto, a pollster who focuses on\u00a0Latino voters\u00a0and who worked with Biden\u2019s 2020 campaign. Those same voters also support Democratic immigration priorities such as permanent legal status for Dreamers, who were brought to the country illegally as children, Barreto said, adding that he expects the president\u2019s campaign to focus on those policies ahead of the election. For now, calling Republicans on their bluff is also a winning issue, Barreto said. \u201cI think part of the political strategy is, you\u2019ve got the Republicans cornered on the border,\u201d he said. \u201cSo why not keep talking about it?\u201d California Rep. Robert Garcia, a national advisory board member for Biden\u2019s campaign, acknowledged the frustration of immigration advocates but argued that Trump presents the \u201cworst possible choice.\u201d Trump has proposed swift and severe changes to the immigration system, including increasing the number of ideological screenings, expanding the ban to travel from predominantly Muslim countries and ending birthright citizenship for the children of undocumented migrants (which many legal observers believe is unconstitutional and likely implausible). He has also promised to launch the \u201clargest domestic deportation operation in American history.\u201d Trump has coined the term \u201cBiden Migrant Crime\u201d as he and other Republicans highlight crimes committed by migrants to falsely argue that migrants have fueled a crime wave. The bipartisan border bill,\u00a0introduced in February, was designed to appease Republicans who said they wouldn\u2019t approve foreign aid to Ukraine and Israel without a border security component. The legislation would have sped up the asylum process and expanded the president\u2019s ability to limit migrant crossings at the US-Mexico border. Trump\u00a0came out against the deal before it was introduced, dooming the initial vote. On Thursday, Senate Democrats\u2019 second attempt to pass the bill failed by an even larger margin \u2013 43-50 \u2013 and lost the backing of two of the key negotiators,\u00a0independent\u00a0Sen. Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona and Republican Sen. James Lankford of Oklahoma. \u201cToday is not a bill. Today is a prop,\u201d Lankford said ahead of the vote. Finding middle ground For months, polls have shown immigration and the border as a top issue for voters, behind the economy and inflation. A\u00a0CBS News/YouGov poll released this month\u00a0found that 61% of likely Arizona voters said the US-Mexico border was a major factor in how they would vote, compared with 82% who pointed to\u00a0the economy\u00a0and 78% who\u00a0named\u00a0inflation. Trump led Biden in the poll by 5 points. Among registered voters, 68% said they did not think the Biden administration\u00a0was\u00a0taking steps to reduce the number of migrants crossing into the US. Asked how recent immigrants from Mexico and Latin America had shaped life in Arizona, 52% said they\u2019d made life worse, 13% said they\u2019d made life better and 35% said they saw no impact. To address those divides, Democrats \u2013 from the Biden campaign down to Senate and House Democrats\u2019 campaign arms \u2013 have tried to find a middle ground. Biden has\u00a0frequently referred to the bipartisan border bill as the \u201ctoughest\u201d set of reforms in decades. But he has highlighted his efforts to push comprehensive immigration reform in the first days of his presidency at Democratic campaign events. Allies\u00a0also\u00a0note that even the border security bill\u00a0contains\u00a0pro-immigrant policies, including a pathway to citizenship for Afghans; 250,000 new green cards, raising the cap for the first time in more than 30 years; relief for children who came to the US on a parent\u2019s work visa; and funding for immigration lawyers for children. Supporters have also pointed to the administration\u2019s efforts to expand protections to migrants through regulations and executive actions,\u00a0including Biden\u2019s broad use of humanitarian parole authority to allow various groups to stay in the country. \u201cThe theory I think that this administration is really operating under is creating lawful pathways so that we have people coming with a visa and not with a smuggler, and that they\u2019re coming for a purpose,\u201d\u00a0said Angela Kelley, a former volunteer with the Biden-Harris transition team and chief adviser at the American Immigration Lawyers Association.\u00a0\u201cThey\u2019re coming to work, they\u2019re coming to reunite with a family member, they are coming because they\u2019re seeking protection.\u201d Broken promises Immigrant rights advocates \u2013 and Democratic lawmakers critical of their party\u2019s border-first strategy \u2013 say the risk heading into the fall is that organizers will feel deflated, and some voters will ultimately choose to stay home if Democrats don\u2019t develop a more distinctive message that celebrates the contributions of immigrants and focuses on their positive impact on the economy. They cite a recent projection by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office that GDP will increase by about $7 trillion from 2023 to 2034 and revenues will be greater by about $1 trillion due largely to immigration. \u201cThe Democratic\u00a0Party\u00a0is making it really hard for us to do our job,\u201d Luis Zaldivar, the Georgia state director for CASA in Action, a progressive group that mobilizes voters around immigrant rights issues, told CNN. \u201cThe immigrant voice has not been heard through the process.\u201d Illinois\u00a0Rep. Delia Ramirez,\u00a0a progressive\u00a0who has continued to oppose the border bill,\u00a0says it\u2019s\u00a0not enough to say the former president\u2019s policies would be worse. \u201cI think we have this assumption: Let\u2019s just move to the center and sound more Republican.\u00a0We\u2019ll get people to vote for us,\u201d Ramirez said. \u201cIt\u2019s not working. We\u2019re sounding just like the other guy, so what ends up winning is apathy.\u201d The risk is losing voters like Abigail Gutierrez, a 22-year-old EMT from Phoenix who voted for Biden in 2020. Gutierrez told CNN that immigration is her top issue because she\u2019d seen how much federal policies have affected\u00a0her community. She hoped to see something done to help migrants who are already in the country \u201cso people aren\u2019t scared to be here.\u201d Asked about Biden, Gutierrez said she\u2019s not sure if\u00a0she will\u00a0back him again this November. \u201cI just think there were a lot of promises that were made that weren\u2019t kept,\u201d she said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/26/politics/democrats-immigration-border-security-elections/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/27/2024", "section": "us"}}

{"id": "2024_05_26_politics_tony-gonzales-uvalde-congress-runoff", "text": "Rep. Tony Gonzales called his GOP opponent in Texas a \u201cneo-Nazi\u201d and an \u201canarchist\u201d intent on \u201cburning the place down\u201d \u2014 and said Republican hardliners seeking to oust him are a bunch of \u201cscumbags\u201d and MAGA wannabes. In an interview with CNN, the two-term Texas GOP congressman said the outcome of Tuesday\u2019s runoff against gun activist Brandon Herrera will send a clear message to Republicans amid a period of bitter intraparty infighting that has led to an ousted speaker, a stalled agenda and roiled relations across the House GOP Conference. \u201cAre we going to be the party that governs and gets things done in a conservative manner?\u201d Gonzales said. \u201cOr are we going to be the party that has jesters that come up here and say wild and crazy outrageous things and just try to burn the place down?\u201d Gonzales\u2019 runoff underscores the intense GOP divide in the narrowly divided House, where hard-right members have grown more emboldened and willing to derail their party\u2019s agenda if there\u2019s a whiff of compromise with Democrats. And the fight is playing out in GOP primaries across the country, the outcome of which will have major ramifications for the direction of the House Republican Conference and the agenda it pursues in\u00a0the next Congress. Gonzales\u2019 race has become ground zero for that fight. Gonzales, whose district includes Uvalde, which witnessed one of the worst school shootings in history two years ago, later voted for a bipartisan gun safety bill that has become a centerpiece of Herrera\u2019s campaign against him. Gonzales said, \u201cI don\u2019t regret any of my votes.\u201d \u201cSomething has to change,\u201d he said, noting his constituents were clamoring for action and that even his kids wear bulletproof backpacks to school. \u201cIt\u2019s unfair.\u201d But it was that vote that has generated backlash on the right \u2014 on top of his handling of talks over a GOP immigration bill last year that grew tense and that some hardliners haven\u2019t forgotten. And the insults Gonzales has leveled have only enraged his GOP critics. \u201cHe is a RINO-establishment moderate who is about to be voted out of office by his constituents who are going to vote for Brandon Herrera,\u201d said Rep. Bob Good, the leader of the hard-right House Freedom Caucus, whom Gonzales referred to as one of the \u201cscumbags\u201d in Congress. Gonzales said if he wins Tuesday, he plans to respond in kind by campaigning in the districts of Good and Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz, both of whom are backing Herrera and also led the charge to oust Kevin McCarthy from the speakership last fall. Gonzales said that after Tuesday he will seek to purge the party of mischief-making members. \u201cI plan to spend a lot of time in Pensacola,\u201d Gonzales said, referring to the city in Gaetz\u2019s Florida Panhandle. \u201cI plan to spend a lot of time in Virginia and some of these other places. So I think my race is only the beginning, right?\u00a0You can send everything you got at me. You\u2019re never going to beat me, right? You\u2019re just not.\u201d Herrera declined to be interviewed for this story. Money pours into Texas race Gonzales\u2019 massive district \u2014 which spans the border with Mexico \u2014 has emerged as one of the most expensive House primaries in the country, with nearly $8 million spent on TV ads. His situation is part of a larger trend of House GOP members seeking to purge their own colleagues in their primaries, even though that has long been viewed as a serious breach of protocol. \u201cIt\u2019s\u00a0never good to be shooting inside the tent,\u201d said Gonzales, 43, a military veteran who has been in Congress since 2021. So far, hard-right candidates have been unsuccessful in defeating their more moderate opponents this cycle.\u00a0An effort to take out\u00a0GOP Rep. Don Bacon in Nebraska failed earlier this month when\u00a0he defeated his conservative challenger,\u00a0Dan Frei, who was endorsed by Good. In Illinois, GOP Rep. Mike Bost won after Gaetz tried to prop up his challenger, a fight that prompted Speaker Mike Johnson to lobby former President Donald Trump\u00a0to intervene on Bost\u2019s behalf. In South Carolina, members of the House Freedom Caucus are rallying around conservative state Rep. Adam Morgan, who is trying to knock off Rep. William Timmons in the\u00a0June 11\u00a0primary.\u00a0In Virginia, center-right Republicans and McCarthy are seeking some payback in helping Republican challenger John McGuire ahead of the\u00a0June 18\u00a0primary against Good, one of\u00a0eight Republicans\u00a0who voted to oust McCarthy last fall. Ahead of Tuesday\u2019s race, Republican backers of Gonzales are optimistic, but low-turnout runoffs make such contests hard to handicap. \u201cIt\u2019s just going to add more to the dysfunction in the House,\u201d said Rep. Michael McCaul of Texas, referring to a potential Herrera victory. \u201cI don\u2019t see him being a productive member of Congress, and (he) will be an agent of chaos.\u201d Rep. Richard Hudson, the chairman of National Republican Congressional Committee, added: \u201cI wish Republicans would focus on beating Democrats and growing the majority. You know, any time an incumbent is in a runoff primary we\u2019re concerned, but I\u2019m very confident Tony will prevail.\u201d GOP Rep. Max Miller of Ohio said he thinks it\u2019s\u00a0\u201cdisgusting\u201d\u00a0that Gaetz is targeting Gonzales. \u201cYou have over 200 Republicans that need to work together every single day,\u201d Miller said. \u201cAnd if you\u2019re in an environment where you have to work with somebody on legislation to move the country forward in a pragmatic and sensible way, and they\u2019re literally trying to take you out to replace you because \u2026 you\u2019re not hard-core enough. What the hell does that even mean anymore?\u201d Gonzales\u2019\u00a0vote in 2022 for a gun safety law that was enacted in the wake of the Uvalde school shooting is in part to blame for GOP hardliners\u2019\u00a0beef with\u00a0him.\u00a0Gonzales\u00a0also tangled with his right flank as they were negotiating the House Republicans\u2019 immigration proposal, even as he voted for the final product. And in 2022, the Texas Republican voted with a minority of his conference to codify same-sex marriage. \u201cTony Gonzales called the tough border protections that we were looking for un-Christian; that\u2019s not how voters feel in his district,\u201d Gaetz said. Asked about Gonzales calling him a \u201cscumbag,\u201d Gaetz said: \u201cSo, you know, the personal insults against me, that\u2019s not going to solve any problems for voters in Texas.\u201d Rep. Chip Roy, a fellow Texas Republican who sparred with Gonzales over border legislation, said he is staying neutral in the primary. Asked about Gonzales, Roy said: \u201cHe\u2019s made some comments that I don\u2019t think are particularly helpful.\u201d One of those comments \u2014 calling his detractors \u201cscumbags\u201d \u2014 was something that \u201creally upset\u201d GOP Rep. Eli Crane of Arizona, who endorsed Herrera and who described Gonzales\u2019 comments as \u201cgarbage\u201d that is \u201cso beneath the conference.\u201d \u201cYou got the largely\u00a0conservative\u00a0House Freedom\u00a0Caucus, going up against moderates in the conference,\u201d Crane told CNN. \u201cWe\u2019re outnumbered. \u2026 That\u2019s why my voters sent me up here to try and change the way this town works. And I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to change it with guys like Tony.\u201d Gonzales said he doesn\u2019t take back his harsh words against some of his GOP colleagues. \u201cNot all of them are rewarding citizens, productive members of society here. And some of them are scumbags. I mentioned a couple of them. There\u2019s probably a laundry list of folks,\u201d Gonzales said, declining to name other names. He added: \u201cSome of these people that are running throughout the country, they\u2019re not MAGA folks. \u2026 Bob Good, he\u2019s not a MAGA guy that\u2019s supporting my opponent, and some other people \u2026 they\u2019re basically libertarians or anarchists or they just want to see the place burn down.\u201d \u2018I will never bow down to these people\u2019 Gonzales was in El Paso when he received a text about the mass shooting that killed\u00a019 children and two teachers. He drove to Uvalde that night after speaking with the sheriff there. Two years later, Gonzales said he thinks a lot needs to change but argues there have been positive developments. \u201cWhat I\u2019ve learned is this: You can do all the things that they want you to do, and it will never be enough. And I will never bow down to these people. I will always do what I think is right,\u201d\u00a0Gonzales said. Herrera, a gun rights activist with a YouTube\u00a0channel with millions of subscribers, has seized on Gonzales\u2019 vote on the gun safety bill in his campaign to oust Gonzales in the\u00a0runoff, arguing it\u2019s an infringement of the Second Amendment. But Gonzales said he was \u201cgetting calls from people nonstop\u201d in the wake of the Uvalde massacre. \u201cThe calls were, \u2018Tony, you have to do something, but don\u2019t take\u00a0my guns away,\u2019\u201d he said. Ultimately, what transpired was a compromise that fell short of restricting weapons and imposing universal background checks but authorized grants for states to bolster \u201cred flag\u201d laws; included money for school safety and mental health programs; expanded background checks for gun purchasers under 21; and toughened gun-trafficking penalties. Gonzales said he \u201cgot a lot of flak\u201d for his support. \u201cCrazy people should not have access to guns, period,\u201d he said. \u201cOverall, people are angry and they\u2019re angry for a reason,\u201d Gonzales said of voters. \u201cBut are they going to be angry and then they want to see outrage by setting stuff on fire? Or are we going to help quell that anger by delivering results? That is what\u2019s at stake, not only in this race, but \u2026 other races across the country.\u201d CNN\u2019s Sheden Tesfaldet and Morgan Rimmer contributed to this story.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/26/politics/tony-gonzales-uvalde-congress-runoff/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/27/2024", "section": "us"}}
