{"id": "2024_06_22_politics_secret-service-rnc-security-perimeter", "text": "The US Secret Service on Friday laid out the security measures for the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee next month, including a perimeter that will prevent protesters from gathering at a large park near the venue. Pere Marquette Park \u2013 which is a few blocks from the Fiserv Forum, where the convention will be held \u2013 now falls under the \u201chard\u201d security perimeter, which will permit only credentialed attendees and volunteers and\u00a0will not allow weapons inside, Audrey Gibson-Cicchino, US Secret Service RNC coordinator,\u00a0said at a news conference. The park had been the subject of security\u00a0discussions\u00a0between the Secret Service and the RNC as recently as last week, with a Donald Trump campaign adviser praising the proposed expansion of the hard perimeter to include the\u00a0park,\u00a0CNN previously reported. The security plans\u00a0include two stages on\u00a0either side of the hard perimeter that will be reserved for protest speeches, said Nick DeSiato, chief of staff at the Milwaukee\u00a0mayor\u2019s office. Friday\u2019s announcement\u00a0comes\u00a0after a\u00a0monthslong dispute between the Secret Service and the GOP\u00a0over security measures around the convention, which will take place from July 15 to 18. The party had accused the agency of ignoring its concerns, while the Secret Service said Republicans were undermining efforts to keep the event safe. In April, Republican National Committee counsel Todd Steggerda\u00a0sent a letter\u00a0asking the Secret Service to keep protesters farther back from the convention\u00a0than what had been planned at the time. He wrote that the city\u2019s proposal \u201ccreates an elevated and untenable safety risk to the attending public\u201d and would place demonstrators in a one-block park that\u00a0\u201cwill\u00a0force thousands of peaceful attendees and demonstrators \u2026 to be in extremely close, consistent and unavoidable proximity.\u201d The RNC letter came during a peak in\u00a0pro-Palestinian rallies at major universities\u00a0across the US. The committee said in the letter that\u00a0\u201crecent\u00a0college and university campus clashes\u201d have shown that forced proximity causes heightened tensions and increases the risk of confrontations and law enforcement intervention. US Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle, responding to a question from CNN on Friday regarding recent comments from Trump ally Steve Bannon calling for\u00a0\u201cvictory or death\u201d\u00a0this election year, said the remark, as well as \u201ccomments that are made across the board,\u201d are considered but have not yet resulted in any changes to convention security. \u201cI don\u2019t think that you\u2019ll see that it\u2019s had a great impact at this point; we\u2019re still continuing forward with the plans as we\u2019ve designed them,\u201d Cheatle said.

{"id": "2024_06_22_us_shane-desguin-fl-fdle-wrongful-termination-claim", "text": "A former top official for the Florida Department of Law Enforcement (FDLE) is accusing the agency and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis of retaliating against him after he disclosed alleged misconduct by them. Shane Desguin says he was forced to resign from his job as chief of staff last year after he refused to comply with \u201cdirectives\u201d he felt violated the law or were inappropriate, according to a whistleblower lawsuit filed this week in Leon County Circuit Court. He also accuses DeSantis and FDLE officials of violating the privacy rights of migrants, withholding public records and calling for the arrests of neo-Nazi protesters in what Desguin argued would have been a violation of their First Amendment rights. \u201c(Desguin) was subjected to disparate treatment, different terms and conditions of employment, and held to a different standard because he reported Defendants\u2019 misfeasance, malfeasance, gross misconduct and unlawful employment activities and was subject to retaliation thereafter,\u201d the 16-page lawsuit states. \u201cFDLE has not been noticed  of this suit and we do not comment on any pending litigation. However, an internal investigation evidenced numerous acts of gross misconduct by Desguin,\u201d FDLE said in a statement to CNN. \u201cAs evidenced by the findings of this investigation (which included the testimonies of dozens of employees), Shane Desguin and Patricia Carpenter created workplace chaos, endangered the safety of other employees, and acted dishonestly and unprofessionally. \u201cThis included sexual harassment, workplace discrimination, and brandishing a firearm inside an office. We are glad that our association with these bad actors has ended, considering the disturbing allegations that were substantiated after a thorough investigation,\u201d the statement said. Desguin supervised Carpenter and the pair were also involved in an extramarital relationship, according to their attorney. Beginning in September 2021, Desguin alleges he was ordered multiple times over a six-month period by DeSantis\u2019 \u201cpublic safety czar\u201d Lawrence Keefe and other administration and FDLE officials to get \u201cphotographs, biometric data, and any other pertinent information by engaging with\u201d migrants arriving in Jacksonville, Florida, on US government-chartered flights from the US southern border. Desguin says he objected, and on numerous times told Keefe that he worried carrying out such an order was against the law, according to the complaint. \u201cFDLE could not legally conduct name checks, capture photographs, or compile intelligence files without a criminal predicate or reasonable suspicion,\u201d according to the lawsuit. As a result, Desguin claims he experienced a \u201cstrain\u201d in his work relationship with Keefe. Keefe \u201cconveyed that failure to comply with his directives would result in adverse consequences,\u201d the lawsuit says. Desguin also raised potential false imprisonment or kidnapping concerns when DeSantis staff officials discussed relocating migrants outside of Florida, the lawsuit says. In August of 2023, Desguin claims DeSantis\u2019 staff pressured the FDLE to arrest neo-Nazi protesters in Orlando, Florida. DeSantis, who was running for president at the time, wanted those protesters arrested under a new law that prohibits people from projecting images onto a building or property without permission, according to the lawsuit. Desguin said the FDLE could not arrest a person for simply participating in First Amendment-protected activity. In response, Desguin said DeSantis\u2019 Chief of Staff Alex Kelly told him, \u201cI don\u2019t think you understand. If you look hard enough, you can find a way. The Governor (DeSantis) wants someone arrested today. He (Defendant DeSantis) will stand by you in any arrest,\u201d according to the lawsuit. Desguin said DeSantis and other officials continued to press for an arrest over the objections of FDLE employees who argued they could not arrest someone simply because DeSantis \u201cdesired it.\u201d In September 2023, the FDLE and the Florida Highway Patrol (FHP) announced the arrest of a 48-year-old man for hanging swastikas and other antisemitic banners on a bridge. Also, last fall, Desguin and other FDLE officials began to disagree with DeSantis\u2019 team about the release of the governor\u2019s travel records. They were eventually informed that none of the governor\u2019s travel records would be released. Desguin, along with FDLE counsel Janine Robinson, disagreed and said withholding the records was a violation of the law. Robinson threatened to resign over the issue and was eventually denied a promotion and a pay raise, according to the complaint. CNN reached out to Robinson for comment. Shortly afterward, Desguin was placed on administrative leave. Jeremy Redfern, press secretary for DeSantis, did not respond directly to any of the allegations raised in the lawsuit. Instead, Redfern provided CNN with a 129-page FDLE Internal Affairs report from May 2024 that found Desguin and Carpenter created a hostile work environment for others. In one instance highlighted in the report, Desguin allegedly handled a firearm in his office during a defensive tactics demonstration and pointed it at Carpenter. Marie Mattox, the attorney representing both Desguin and Carpenter, claims Desguin was forced to retire and told CNN the Internal Affairs report was completed after her client separated from FDLE. Desguin\u2019s affidavit of separation said the reason for his separation was retirement and that it did not involve misconduct. The complaint states that the allegations against Desguin were sent to the State Attorney\u2019s Office for possible prosecution, but they declined to bring charges. \u201cIf you look at the time line,\u00a0it is clear that both FDLE and DeSantis doubled down on him after he left to smear his good name. They really have no choice but to try to cast doubt on his character because they cannot defend the charges that he made on the merits.\u00a0So what do they do? They point the finger at him AFTER he was cleared of wrongdoing,\u201d Mattox said in a statement to CNN. In a phone call to CNN, Mattox also denied accusations included in the Internal Affairs report that Desguin created a hostile work environment by pointing a gun at Carpenter during a demonstration. She said, \u201cIt never happened, nothing even remotely close to that incident took place.\u201d According to Mattox, Carpenter is also a whistleblower and was fired with no reason given just days after her whistleblower complaint. Mattox said Carpenter is expected to file her own lawsuit soon. Desguin is requesting a jury trial, compensatory damages, legal fees and job reinstatement.

{"id": "2024_06_22_business_malls-lack-windows-curious-consumer", "text": "Decades ago, Americans flocked to Main Street to shop. A string of small family-owned stores stood next to each other along a tree-lined block or two, displaying their goods through large welcoming windows. Then in 1956 something happened that forever changed that shopping experience. A new retailing format packed up the hustle and bustle of Main Street commerce and recreated it inside of a very large boxy building that was \u2013 deliberately \u2013 devoid of windows. The birth of the American mall ushered in an era of \u201cwindowless\u201d shopping that\u2019s largely still here. The strategy was clever and little details in the planning \u2013- from the no-frills shoebox architecture to potted plants \u2013 were carefully thought out. These were cost-saving measures for mall operators that were also designed to influence mallgoers to spend freely. The unnaturally bright artificial lighting strived to create a perpetual daytime environment. This way, mall visitors would stay longer than they had expected to and spent more than they would have wanted to. Another reason for malls shunning windows did have something to do with the merchandising, Burt Flickinger, retail expert and managing director of retail consultancy Strategic Resource Group told CNN. Fewer windows and more walls, he said, meant more space for retailers to add shelves and rods to stock their products and maximize sales per square foot in their stores that would otherwise be lost to a dull view of a mall parking lot. But the sneakiest reason why malls limit windows could be to make shoppers lose track of time. \u201cShoppers can\u2019t see the rain storm or snow storm blowing in without windows. Windowless shopping creates an environment of consumption without distractions,\u201d Flickinger said. \u201cWhen people have a sense of timelessness and comfort, families spend more because they can focus just on the stores and the mall experience.\u201d Shock-and-awe on the inside The first fully enclosed mall \u2013 the Southdale Center in Minneapolis \u2013 opened in 1956. It became the prototype going forward as indoor climate-controlled malls that could stay open year-round popped up in suburbs across the country. The architect of the 1.2 million square feet Southdale Center was Austria-born Victor Gruen, considered the pioneer of modern mall design. He established Gruen Associates, a legacy architecture, planning and landscape firm still in existence and based in Los Angeles. He wanted to wow shoppers with shock-and-awe once they entered the building and took in the brightly-lit shops and cafes, even artwork exhibited around the mall. At the center of the mall layout would be a fountain or a skylight, possibly the only entry point to natural light coming into the expansive space. He added plants and music to create an inviting sensory experience. The structure of the traditional mall was either a T-shape, or a cross shape with the four anchor stores on either sides, Stephanie Cegielski, vice president of research with the International Council of Shopping Centers, told CNN. \u201cWhen you are walking around that \u2018T\u2019 everything is facing into you. As a shopper, you are perpetually looking at what is coming next and opposed to what\u2019s going on in the outside world,\u201d she said. Because all of the activity faced in, Cegielski said it didn\u2019t make sense for there to be windows per se, \u201cunless you were looking at a department store that has its own separate entrance into the mall that would create that window to the outside,\u201d she said. The exterior look was another story. The Southdale mall was functional and drab to look at and that is the blueprint that all traditional enclosed malls have continued to follow. \u201cMalls are really built to have the landscape on the inside. All of the architectural energy that we normally see on the outside of a building in an urban setting is focused internally. A mall is a machine for selling,\u201d Alexandra Lange, an architecture critic and author of \u201cMeet me by the fountain: An inside history of the mall\u201d said in an interview with CNN. The first round of malls in the mid-to-late 1950s did have more architecture on the outside, Lange said. \u201cBut the mall owners found that there was no increase in consumer interest based on that so let\u2019s  not waste money on that,\u201d she said. Fewer windows means lower energy bill As an added bonus, \u201cit was a lot less expensive for mall developers to not put multiple windows facing on the outside because it would make it cheaper to heat and cool the big-box space,\u201d said Thomas McMillan, director with the Center of Retailing Studies at Texas A&M University\u2019s Mays Business School, in an interview with CNN. Energy costs typically are the second-highest operating expense for retailers after labor costs. \u201cThe sophistication of double-pane energy-efficient windows wasn\u2019t ubiquitous when a lot of the malls were built in America during and after the 1970s energy crisis. So air conditioning could seep through the window panes,\u201d said Flickinger. The mall design inspired another type of store. Other shopping destinations that incorporate a windowless boxy venue are supermarkets. \u201cA typical grocery store layout has all of the fresh food around the outside that tends to be refrigerated. It\u2019s good for it to be next to a wall where there is power,\u201d Lange said. \u201cIf you cut windows into the wall, you have less space for refrigerated cases.\u201d Today, there are about 1,122 enclosed malls in the US, according to the International Council of Shopping Centers. That\u2019s down from around 1,400 regional malls that existed around 15 years ago, according to Kristin Mueller, president, retail property management with\u00a0JLL, a real estate and investment management services firm, in an interview with CNN. But even with fewer enclosed malls in existence today, and just a handful of new malls built over the last decade (including the 3 million square foot American Dream Mall which opened in East Rutherford, New Jersey in 2019) that still abide by Gruen\u2019s blueprint, shoppers, especially Gen Z and Millennials, don\u2019t appear to be put off by their windowless aesthetic, she said. On average, 54% of US adult shoppers have visited a mall at least once a month in 2023 and spent an average of a little more than $300 each month last year, according to the latest data from the ICSC. As many as 70% of those shoppers were GenZers and 66% of them Millennials, according to the group. Mall retailing is evolving, however, said Cegielski. Families head to malls for entertainment as much as shopping, with people enjoying restaurants, movies, mini golf, pickleball courts and large indoor amusement centers that have been retrofitted inside of existing shopping centers. Some of these adaptive uses of traditional malls might be creating a practical need for windows after all, she said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/22/business/malls-lack-windows-curious-consumer/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/23/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_18_us_justin-harris-georgia-hot-car-prison-release", "text": "Justin Ross Harris, a Georgia father whose murder\u00a0conviction\u00a0for the hot-car death of his 22-month-old son was\u00a0overturned\u00a0by the state\u2019s Supreme Court in 2022, has been released from prison, according to prison records. Harris was released from Macon State Prison on Father\u2019s Day \u2013 nearly 10 years to the day since his son, Cooper, died after his father left him strapped inside a car for seven hours on a hot day while he went to work \u2013 according to the Georgia Department of Corrections website. The father was convicted of Cooper\u2019s murder in 2016 after prosecutors convinced a jury Harris killed his son to escape the burdens of his marriage and fatherhood. But the life sentence was overturned in 2022 by the Georgia Supreme Court, which ruled 6-3 that evidence submitted by prosecutors of Harris\u2019 extramarital relationships \u2013 which the state had portrayed as the motivation behind his alleged decision to kill his son \u2013 had an unfair prejudicial impact on the jury. Though the murder charges were nullified, the court left in place three other counts relating to his electronic exchanges of lewd material\u00a0with an underage girl. Harris was sentenced to a total of 12 years on those three charges: 10 years for one count of attempt to commit sexual exploitation of a child, and one year each for two counts of dissemination of harmful material to a minor, according to the ruling. Prison records state his maximum release date as June 18, 2024, on the sexual exploitation charge and marks his confinement status as \u201cinactive.\u201d After his release from prison Sunday, he was transferred to the Cobb County Adult Detention Center to serve the two additional years on the other charges, according to the Office of the Cobb County District Attorney. Cooper\u2019s death and his father\u2019s trial captivated the nation, in part because hot-car death cases rarely lead to murder charges against grieving parents who insist leaving their child in a hot car was nothing more than a tragic accident. After prosecutors announced last year they would not retry the murder case against Harris, his attorney said Harris was relieved and \u201cthankful that today\u2019s dismissal may begin to restore Cooper\u2019s legacy as a child much loved by his parents.\u201d \u201cRoss has always accepted the moral responsibility for Cooper\u2019s death. But after all these years of investigation and review, this dismissal of charges confirms that Cooper\u2019s death was unintentional and therefore not a crime,\u201d attorney Carlos Rodriguez said in May 2023. \u201cThroughout the course of representing Ross, we have learned that these tragic accidents often happen while the child is in the care of a loving parent. Ross was no different,\u201d Rodriguez said. Cooper\u2019s mother, Leanna Taylor, has stood by her belief that Harris did not intend to kill their child that sweltering day. She said after the Georgia Supreme Court ruling that she hoped it would change how their son is remembered. \u201cThat he was wanted, that he was loved and that he is missed every single day,\u201d she said in a statement released by her attorney. While the trial revealed that on the day their son died, Harris exchanged sexual messages and photos with five women and a 16-year-old minor, Taylor maintained that Harris remained a loving father despite failing their marriage. The couple has since divorced. \u201cRoss was a loving and proud father to Cooper. At the same time Ross was being a terrible husband. These two things can and did exist at the same time.\u201d CNN\u2019s Ray Sanchez contributed to this report.

Wade was overturned,\u00a014 states have total or near-total bans\u00a0on abortion, including Alabama, Texas, Idaho and Tennessee. Despite\u00a0an increase in\u00a0restrictive policies,\u00a0the number and rate of\u00a0abortions\u00a0in 2023 hit their highest point in over a decade, according to\u00a0a report from\u00a0the\u00a0Guttmacher Institute, a\u00a0research and policy non-profit that advocates for sexual and reproductive health rights. The organization estimates\u00a0there were more than 1 million abortions in the\u00a0formal\u00a0US\u00a0healthcare system\u00a0last year, a\u00a011% increase from 2020. States without\u00a0total\u00a0abortion bans saw a\u00a026% increase from 2020, according to the report. The loss of\u00a0abortion\u00a0access in states with bans, the authors noted, was countered by\u00a0\u201cefforts on the part of clinics, abortion funds and logistical support organizations to help people\u2026access care.\u201d Nearly two-thirds of all abortions in 2023, about 642,700, were medication abortions \u2013 not including self-managed medication abortions outside of the healthcare setting, the report says. The authors note a steady increase since 2001, when medication abortions\u00a0accounted for less than 10% of all procedures. Over the years, the US Food and Drug Administration relaxed some of the restrictions for use of the abortion pill, and access to the medication increased. In 2016, the agency deemed the abortion pill safe to use up to 10 weeks into pregnancy, rather than seven, and expanded the pool of providers who could prescribe it. After the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, the FDA allowed for the pill to be dispensed by certified pharmacies and through the mail, rather than just in healthcare settings. States implement increasingly restrictive abortion policies Abortion policies have changed rapidly\u00a0in many\u00a0states since the Supreme Court\u2019s decision\u00a0to overturn Roe. Four states, California, Michigan, Vermont and Ohio, have since\u00a0enshrined rights to reproductive freedom in their constitutions, while lawmakers in\u00a0New York\u00a0and other states implemented policies to protect abortion patients and providers. More than a dozen states passed\u00a0abortion \u201ctrigger\u00a0laws\u201d ahead of\u00a0the court\u2019s decision,\u00a0meant to take effect almost immediately in the event that Roe was overturned,\u00a0and at least seven\u00a0states without trigger laws have followed suit with restrictive reproductive health policies that critics say put patients in danger and leave providers at risk of civil and criminal liability. Patients and providers have struggled to navigate a patchwork of sometimes hastily implemented abortion policies that include\u00a0mandatory waiting periods\u00a0to obtain an abortion in states\u00a0including\u00a0Arizona and Georgia, limits on\u00a0Medicaid coverage\u00a0for abortion, in states including South Dakota, and vague language around\u00a0medical emergency exceptions\u00a0to abortion bans in states including Texas. Lower courts have been asked to take abortion issues up in multiple legal challenges across states. These policies have already had real-world\u00a0effects. For example,\u00a0one woman in Texas\u00a0sued the state to access an abortion for a pregnancy that was threatening her future fertility. Another Texas woman was\u00a0unlawfully charged\u00a0with murder for\u00a0using abortion medication to self-induce an abortion and spent two nights in jail before the charges were dropped.\u00a0Providers say\u00a0that patients in states with abortion bans have been forced to carry pregnancies against their will, leading to compromised fertility and other life-threatening consequences. Last month, Florida replaced its 15-week abortion ban with a\u00a0six-week ban, which falls before many women know they\u2019re pregnant. The move was a major blow to reproductive access in the South, where Florida was a critical access point for people seeking abortions. Providers\u00a0and advocates\u00a0say the restrictive policies have created a\u00a0reproductive care\u00a0\u201cdesert\u201d in the region. Patients cross state lines to access reproductive care More than 171,000 patients travelled for an abortion in 2023, according to the Guttmacher Institute. Many people who traveled to obtain abortions before Roe was overturned were going to states that now have total abortion bans, meaning people are now traveling farther distances \u2013 sometimes crossing multiple state lines \u2013 to access care, the\u00a0organization noted recently. In just the first half of 2023,\u00a0nearly 1 in 5 people\u00a0who had an abortion \u00ad\u2013\u00a0more than 92,000 people \u2013 traveled across state lines for abortion care, according to a\u00a0December\u00a02023\u00a0analysis\u00a0from the\u00a0institute. As the abortion care landscape becomes more and more restrictive, Alexandra Mandado, president of Planned Parenthood in South, East and North Florida,\u00a0says that remaining abortion clinics\u00a0will struggle to absorb the increase in out-of-state patients. Supreme Court takes up other high profile reproductive rights cases The Supreme Court recently\u00a0rejected a challenge\u00a0to access\u00a0to the abortion pill, mifepristone, maintaining widespread access to medication abortion in a ruling that will allow for continued mailing of the pills\u00a0to patients without an in-person doctor\u2019s visit. Experts say abortion pill access could face additional legal challenges in the future. The court is considering another case this summer dealing with\u00a0medical emergency exceptions\u00a0to abortion bans. In the case, the Biden administration sued the state of Idaho,\u00a0where exemptions to its abortion ban are limited to life-threatening situations,\u00a0arguing that federal law requires hospitals receiving Medicare funding to provide stabilizing care, including abortions, when a pregnant person\u2019s health is\u00a0in danger. Access to other reproductive care services is challenged In February,\u00a0the\u00a0Alabama Supreme Court\u00a0ruled that frozen embryos are considered human beings and those who destroy them can be held liable for wrongful death, causing fertility clinics throughout the state to pause in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatments out of fear of legal prosecution. As families across the state lost access to IVF treatments, lawmakers scrambled to meet the widespread demand for a fix. In March,\u00a0the state passed a law\u00a0aimed at protecting IVF patients and providers from the legal liability imposed on them by the state court\u2019s ruling. While some services resumed,\u00a0at least one\u00a0of the state\u2019s limited pool of IVF providers says it will halt services altogether\u00a0by the end of the year, citing litigation concerns. Experts have\u00a0expressed concern\u00a0that other reproductive care services, like contraception, are also on the line amid a swell of misinformation that some say is sown intentionally to create panic,\u00a0like lawmakers conflating emergency contraception\u00a0with abortion, for example. Advocates work to get abortion on state ballots in November Most abortion policies implemented after the Supreme Court overturned Roe were directly triggered by that decision or handed down by lawmakers or state courts. In an effort to\u00a0restore the issue of reproductive health access, organizers across the country have been working to get measures to enshrine reproductive health rights in state constitutions\u00a0on ballots in November. Colorado, Florida, Maryland and South Dakota have secured the measures on their state ballots, with New York and Nevada likely to follow suit. Organizers in at least seven other states are working to do the same. In addition to making it more difficult to challenge access to abortion services, organizers hope that the measures will allow voters to\u00a0send a message to politicians about what they want.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/22/us/roe-v-wade-overturned-2-years/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/23/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_22_politics_trump-faith-and-freedom-philadelphia-rally", "text": "Former President Donald Trump, in keeping with his preference for shunning traditional debate prep, spent his last Saturday before his first one-on-one showdown with President Joe Biden on the campaign trail. Trump addressed a gathering of Christian conservatives Saturday afternoon in Washington, DC, touching upon his familiar campaign messages while emphasizing his efforts to undo the federal right to an abortion by nominating the justices who helped overturn Roe v. Wade. Later Saturday, he traveled to Philadelphia for a more traditional campaign rally in a key battleground state. The back-to-back public appearances stand in stark contrast to Biden\u2019s approach to the first of two presidential debates, hosted by CNN on Thursday. The president and his team are spending the weekend before the debate at Camp David, poring over briefing binders and holding mock debate sessions as he crams for his high-stakes meeting with Trump. While Trump has held informal briefing sessions with advisers and allies, he has also kept up an active campaign schedule. He held a rally in Racine, Wisconsin, on Tuesday and attended a fundraiser Thursday night in Ohio. Trump\u2019s campaign is relishing the juxtaposition of the two candidates\u2019 preparation styles. \u201cWhile Joe Biden\u2019s advisors force him to hide away at Camp David for some much-needed rest, President Trump is keeping up with his busy campaign schedule,\u201d Trump spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said. Speaking to reporters at a Philadelphia sandwich shop Saturday, Trump said, \u201cI look forward to Thursday. I know he\u2019s locked up in a log cabin someplace. You can imagine what he\u2019s doing,\u201d referring to Biden. Earlier Saturday, the former president attended the annual \u201cRoad to Majority\u201d conference hosted by the Faith & Freedom Coalition, a group founded by leading evangelical voice Ralph Reed. Trump has addressed the conference nine times over the years, though his appearance Saturday came as he has tried to distance himself from the strident anti-abortion positions of Christian groups \u2013 like Faith & Freedom. After arguing for a federal abortion ban and leading the charge to overturn Roe v. Wade, Trump now says future fights over access to the procedure should be left to the states. His reversal on abortion comes after Trump blamed the issue for the GOP\u2019s underwhelming midterm performance in 2022 and before his party will vote on its first platform since the fall of Roe at its convention next month. Reed told CNN he doesn\u2019t believe Trump\u2019s position is at odds with faith voters. \u201cThe president\u2019s position simply reflects the short-term political reality for both sides,\u201d he said. \u201cNeither side has the votes to pass federal legislation that reflects their values and aspirations.\u201d Reed added: \u201cThe long-term political reality is whoever wins that battle at the state level will build the momentum and gain the votes to achieve what they want at the federal level.\u201d Democrats have campaigned aggressively and spent millions of dollars reminding voters of Trump\u2019s role in eliminating the constitutional right to an abortion. The Biden campaign slammed Trump\u2019s appearance at the Washington\u00a0event as proof of where he stands on the issue. \u201cYou are the company you keep,\u201d Biden campaign spokeswoman Sarafina Chitika said, \u201cand Donald Trump\u2019s position is clear: he \u2018proudly\u2019 worked alongside extremists to overturn Roe, he promised to work \u2018side by side\u2019 with a group promising to \u2018eradicate\u2019 abortion, and this Saturday, he\u2019ll deliver the keynote address to fellow extremists committed to banning abortion nationwide.\u201d Trump\u2019s rally in Philadelphia on Saturday evening marked his fourth appearance in Pennsylvania this year as the race for one of the top battlegrounds heats up. The Trump campaign has sought to drive a wedge between Biden and his birth state by hammering the president over inflation and crime. Trump homed in on crime in his remarks Saturday, saying Philadelphia was being \u201cravaged by bloodshed\u201d and highlighting the attendance of family members of slain Maryland mother Rachel Morin, whose suspected killer authorities say illegally crossed the US-Mexico border last year. Southeast Pennsylvania has become a hotbed of activity from both presidential campaigns. Trump held a rally in Lehigh Valley in April, and in February, he released a gym shoe at SneakerCon in Philadelphia as part of his outreach to minority communities. Biden won 92% of Black voters in Pennsylvania four years ago en route to capturing the state \u2013 key to his overall victory. But a recent poll from the The New York Times, The Philadelphia Inquirer and Siena College found his support in the state among Black voters had fallen to 50%. Ahead of Trump\u2019s Saturday rally, the Democratic National Committee unveiled new ads it said were aimed at highlighting \u201cTrump\u2019s history of failing Black Americans and how he\u2019s left the Black community behind.\u201d The counter-messaging push comes as polls show that Black men are more open to supporting the Republican nominee in this year\u2019s election than they have historically been. Along with a billboard in Philadelphia, the DNC planned to deploy at the former president\u2019s rally a mobile billboard that highlighted the higher unemployment rates for Black Americans under the Trump administration compared with the Biden administration. The committee planned \u201cpro-Biden kiosks\u201d around Temple University, where Trump\u2019s rally was held, that highlighted the student loan debt relief and increase in public education funding delivered under the Biden administration. \u201cDonald Trump was a disaster for minority communities \u2013 particularly Black Americans. He says he\u2019s not racist, but his record says differently. Over and over again, he has insulted cities with significant Black communities, and during his time in office, jobs disappeared, unemployment more than doubled for Black Americans during the pandemic, and his tax scam widened the racial wealth gap,\u201d DNC spokesperson Abhi Rahman said in a statement. Trump, meanwhile, pledged at the rally to \u201cwork to lift up Black, Hispanic and other communities in Philadelphia and all across the United States.\u201d This story has been updated with additional developments.

{"id": "2024_06_22_business_alaska-airlines-labor-deal-flight-attendants", "text": "Alaska Airlines and its 7,000-member flight attendants union reached a tentative labor deal late Friday, concluding talks that lasted more than a year and a half. Terms of the deal have not been released, though the union called it a \u201crecord contract.\u201d The deal likely contains a significant pay raise, which has been a common demand across the airline industry and sought by unions whose members in some cases have not seen a pay increase in years. In April, the union announced to members it was seeking pay raises of between 43% to 56%, depending upon seniority, through 2026. Those pay raises would include back pay covering a period dating back a year and a half that they\u2019ve worked under the terms of the previous contract. \u201cYour actions over the last two years of bargaining \u2026 ensured we had the leverage to extract every last dollar from Alaska Airlines management,\u201d the union said Friday in a statement to its members. Alaska Airlines said it was pleased to have reached an agreement and thanked union negotiators. \u201cWith our combined efforts, we\u2019ve been able to reach an agreement that provides quality of life and continued career growth at Alaska,\u201d the airline said in a statement. The agreement still needs the approval of union leadership and rank-and-file members to go into effect. In February, rank-and-file members voted 99.5% in favor of authorizing a strike. However, under the Railway Labor Act, the labor law that covers airline workers, its members could not go on strike, even though their contract had reached its scheduled end date in December 2022. Instead, the union members continued to work under the terms and pay dictated by that contract. Such restrictions on striking don\u2019t exist for most private sector employees. In February, flight attendants from Alaska \u2014 along with American, United and Southwest \u2014held unprecedented coordinated pickets demanding new contracts. Since then, flight attendants at Southwest reached a deal that included an immediate 22.3% raise as of May 1 and $364 million in retroactive wages. Meanwhile, flight attendants at American and United are still seeking new deals. American flight attendants have asked to be released from restrictions so they can go on strike, but even if that is granted there would be months of cooling off periods before they could walk out, under the Railway Labor Act. Steve Maller, a flight attendant for nearly 20 years, was among those on the picket lines in February. Maller was one of the flight attendants on the Alaska Airlines Flight 1282, which drew international attention on January 5 when a door plug blew off, leaving a gaping hole in the side of the plane. Maller told CNN in February that he and the other members of the flight crew were commended by Alaska Airlines\u2019 top management for their actions in the plane, which landed without serious injuries. But he said he picketed because the existing contract did not provide a livable wage for too many flight attendants. Maller said he has worked at times as a bartender and that most flight attendants he knows also have second jobs. \u201cYou have to have something to have livable pay, to make ends meet,\u201d he said. Maller said he\u2019s also worried the airline is losing too many veteran flight attendants who have gone years with little or now wage increase. \u201cIt was unheard of five years ago (for flight attendants to) quit their jobs,\u201d he said. \u201cNow we have 20, 25, 30 a month (quitting).\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/22/business/alaska-airlines-labor-deal-flight-attendants/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/23/2024", "section": "us"}}

{"id": "2024_06_20_us_donkey-elk-herd-california-cec", "text": "When Diesel the donkey ran away on a hike near his home outside Sacramento, California, five years ago, his owners assumed the worst. \u201cHe\u2019s not aggressive, he\u2019s a lover,\u201d Terrie Drewry told CNN affiliate KOVR in 2019, days after Diesel\u2019s great escape. \u201cBut right now, he\u2019s scared.\u201d Years passed without a sign of life from Diesel \u2014\u00a0until earlier this year, when a hunter spotted and filmed a herd of at least a dozen elk in the northern California wilderness. Among them, strangely, was a wild burro. Drewry is positive that the donkey in the hunter\u2019s video is her Diesel. \u201cFinally we saw him,\u201d Drewry told KOVR this month after the Instagram video began making headlines. \u201cFinally, we know he\u2019s good. He\u2019s living his best life. He\u2019s happy. He\u2019s healthy, and it was just a relief.\u201d The Drewry family adopted Diesel from the Bureau of Land Management, and he lived on their ranch in peace for the first few years of his life alongside chickens, a llama and a miniature donkey. But on a fateful hike in April 2019, Diesel noticed something that spooked him and took off running, dragging Drewry\u2019s husband Dave through the bushes behind him, she told KOVR at the time. For weeks they searched for Diesel in the Cache Creek Wilderness, a rugged area northwest of Sacramento made up of nearly 30,000 acres. They thought they spotted him on a trail camera and once found some tracks that may have matched his hooves, but they never found him. Enter Max Fennell, a professional triathlete who occasionally hunts in wild California with a bow and arrow. On a hunting trip in March, Fennell stumbled upon the elk herd \u2014 and was stunned to see a donkey among them. In a video shot by Fennell, which Drewry said was taken mere miles from where Diesel bolted in 2019, the herd is seen moving in unison. When Fennell spots them, they stop to stare at him. The animals don\u2019t move again until the donkey apparently gives the all-clear: After sizing up a disbelieving Fennell, the burro turns its head and trots off. The elk quickly follow. \u201cProbably one of my wildest hunting trips to date,\u201d Fennell wrote in the caption of the video on Instagram. \u201cI can\u2019t get over seeing it and I\u2019m amazed that the donkey looks happy and healthy!\u201d In addition to clearing land, pulling wagons and providing general cuteness, donkeys can protect livestock on farms. The pack animals fiercely defend their flocks by braying, kicking wildly and charging, teeth bared, at potential predators. Drewry suspects that, if the donkey Fennell spotted is indeed Diesel, he\u2019s merely doing his donkey duty and protecting his deer friends. \u201cThey learned to get along and be each other\u2019s family,\u201d she told KOVR. A video shared in September last year also purported to show Diesel with his elk kin. The donkey in that clip looked utterly content, trotting through tall yellow grass in the dappled sunlight. Though she misses him, Drewry said she won\u2019t try to catch Diesel and bring him back. As grazing animals, donkeys in the wild can usually find plenty to eat. And the donkey in Fennell\u2019s video appears to be thriving in the wilderness, with friends by his side. \u201cHe\u2019s truly a wild burro now,\u201d she said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/20/us/donkey-elk-herd-california-cec/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/23/2024", "section": "us"}}

{"id": "2024_06_08_us_rust-shooting-timeline-alec-baldwin", "text": "The actor Alec Baldwin and several crew members gathered in a church at a New Mexico ranch on October 21, 2021, to rehearse a scene from their upcoming Western film \u201cRust.\u201d Then came the unexpected gunshot. A promising cinematographer was killed, a director was wounded and a film production was left in shambles. Since that day\u2019s fatal shooting of 42-year-old Halyna Hutchins, the film\u2019s armorer and its assistant director have been convicted of criminal charges. And after some back-and-forth legal arguments, Baldwin soon is set to stand trial on charges of involuntary manslaughter. The details of what happened that day have been made public in affidavits, probable cause statements, interviews with the main participants and testimony at criminal trials. Here\u2019s a timeline of the on-set shooting and the resulting legal cases. The shooting May 29, 2020: Baldwin, the three-time Emmy winner for his roles on \u201c30 Rock\u201d and \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d was announced as producer and star of the Western feature film \u201cRust,\u201d based on a story by Baldwin and Joel Souza, Deadline reported. In the film, Baldwin plays a grizzled outlaw on the run from authorities with his 13-year-old grandson. October 6, 2021: Filming of \u201cRust\u201d began at Bonanza Creek Ranch, a movie set outside Santa Fe, New Mexico. October 20, 2021: Several crew members walked off set, citing safety concerns. One crew member stated there had been two accidental weapons discharges and a special effects mess-up that set off explosives around the crew between takes. October 21, 2021: Hannah Gutierrez Reed, the armorer for \u201cRust,\u201d loaded a prop six-shot revolver with what she believed were \u201cdummy\u201d rounds, a term for ammo that contains no explosive elements but appear to be real, according to investigators and her defense attorney. Baldwin and several crew members began rehearsing a scene in a rustic church on set before breaking for lunch. After the break, Baldwin, Souza, Hutchins and a few others returned to the church for rehearsal. Assistant director Dave Halls fetched a prop gun from a cart outside the church and yelled \u201ccold gun,\u201d indicating it was unloaded. He then handed the gun to Baldwin. Baldwin practiced a \u201ccross draw\u201d \u2013 pulling a gun from a holster on the opposite side of his body from his draw hand. The scene required him to point the gun toward the camera, helmed by Hutchins, Souza and a camera operator. Suddenly, they heard a loud bang. Hutchins stumbled backward, slumped to the floor clutching her stomach and said she couldn\u2019t feel her legs. Souza, who had been standing beside her, noticed blood on his shoulder. At 1:48 p.m., the crew reported the shooting to emergency responders. Hutchins was transported by air helicopter to the hospital and was pronounced dead at 3:37 p.m. Souza was treated at the hospital, and a projectile from a live round was removed from his back. Sheriff\u2019s deputies arrived to the scene and began investigating the series of events leading to the shooting. October 22, 2021: Baldwin released a statement calling the death a \u201ctragic accident\u201d and said he is fully cooperating with the police investigation. December 2, 2021: In an interview with ABC, Baldwin said he cocked the gun and let go of the hammer, and the gun then fired. He said he was aiming the gun just to the side of the camera toward Hutchins, as she instructed him to do. \u201cI would never point a gun at anyone and then pull the trigger, never,\u201d he said. The investigations August 14, 2022: FBI testing of the firearm found it could not be fired without pulling the trigger while the gun was cocked, according to a forensics report. The report noted the gun eventually malfunctioned during FBI testing after internal parts fractured, causing the gun to go off in the cocked position without pulling the trigger. August 20, 2022: In an interview with CNN, Baldwin\u00a0placed responsibility\u00a0for Hutchins\u2019 death on Gutierrez Reed, the film armorer and props assistant, and on assistant director Halls, who handed him the gun. October 5, 2022: The family of Hutchins and Baldwin reached an undisclosed settlement in a wrongful death lawsuit filed against the actor and others. As part of the settlement, Matthew Hutchins, the cinematographer\u2019s widower, was named an executive producer on \u201cRust.\u201d January 19, 2023: Prosecutors announced Baldwin and Gutierrez Reed will be charged with involuntary manslaughter in Hutchins\u2019 death. Halls, the assistant director, agreed to plead no contest to negligent use of a deadly weapon, the district attorney\u2019s office announced. The terms of that deal include six months of probation\u00a0and a suspended sentence, prosecutors said. January 31, 2023: Baldwin and Gutierrez Reed were formally charged with involuntary manslaughter. February 23, 2023: Baldwin pleaded not guilty to manslaughter charges and was released on personal recognizance. April 20, 2023: New Mexico special prosecutors dismissed the charges against Baldwin, citing \u201cnew facts\u201d in the case. \u201cThis decision does not absolve Mr. Baldwin of criminal culpability and charges may be refiled,\u201d they said. August 9, 2023: Gutierrez Reed pleaded not guilty to involuntary manslaughter and tampering with evidence. January 19: Baldwin was indicted by a grand jury on charges of involuntary manslaughter. January 31: Baldwin pleaded not guilty to involuntary manslaughter charges for the second time. February 22: The trial of film armorer Gutierrez Reed began. Prosecutors alleged her failures allowed six live bullets to make their way on set, and she did not make vital safety checks that would have caught the problem. Her defense blamed Baldwin for failing to follow common-sense gun safety rules and on the film\u2019s production team for creating a chaotic and unsafe environment. March 1: Souza, the director and screenwriter, testified about the moment he was shot on set while standing behind Hutchins. March 6: Gutierrez Reed was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter after jurors deliberated for nearly three hours. She was acquitted of a charge of evidence tampering. April 15: At her sentencing hearing, Gutierrez Reed said \u201cmy heart aches\u201d for Hutchins\u2019 family and friends, and she asked the judge to sentence her to probation. The judge criticized her statement and sentenced her to the maximum 18 months in prison, saying, \u201cYou alone turned a safe weapon into a lethal weapon.\u201d May 24: A New Mexico judge denied Baldwin\u2019s motion to dismiss the involuntary manslaughter indictment. Baldwin\u2019s attorneys had accused prosecutors of misconduct during the grand jury process. June 3: New Mexico prosecutors asked the court to grant use immunity to Gutierrez Reed and compel her to testify at Baldwin\u2019s trial, according to court documents. Gutierrez Reed invoked her Fifth Amendment right to silence in a pre-trial interview, and prosecutors said if she is not granted immunity then she would not be able to testify in the trial. Gutierrez Reed\u2019s attorney, Jason Bowles, told CNN he will oppose the motion. June 17: Prosecutors signal their intention to portray Baldwin as repeatedly flouting safety protocols on the movie set in the days before the fatal shooting, according to\u00a0a new court filing. Outlining evidence they intend to present, prosecutors highlighted repeated instances in which Baldwin allegedly acted dangerously between October 12 and October 21, 2021. One of\u00a0Baldwin\u2019s attorneys, Luke Nikas, had no comment about the prosecution\u2019s document, but referred CNN to the defense\u2019s most recent filing asking the court again to dismiss the indictment and accusing the prosecution of selected disclosure of evidence. June 21: Judge Mary Marlowe Sommer denied a defense motion asking the court to dismiss the involuntary manslaughter indictment. The defense argued the shooting death was an accident and Baldwin is \u201cnot criminally liable.\u201d The prosecution countered Baldwin is experienced in the movie business and knew he was handling a real gun. A separate motion to dismiss \u2013 in which Baldwin\u2019s team argued the gun used in the shooting was destroyed during forensic testing by the FBI, preventing the defense from recreating the testing \u2013 will be considered at a hearing next week. The judge also denied the prosecution\u2019s motion to grant use immunity to Gutierrez Reed to compel her to testify at Baldwin\u2019s trial.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/08/us/rust-shooting-timeline-alec-baldwin/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/23/2024", "section": "us"}}

On was identified by his mother to CNN as the man in a white hoodie attacking protesters with a long pole in videos distributed across social media. He was arrested on suspicion of felony assault in May. \u201cOur office has completed a thorough review of the incident involving Mr. Edan On who allegedly assaulted another protestor,\u201d Los Angeles County District Attorney George Gasc\u00f3n said in a Friday news release. \u201cWe cannot establish beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. On\u2019s conduct directly caused the victim\u2019s injury. There is no evidence to suggest that Mr. On was working in collaboration with any other individuals; and our investigation found no proof of conspiracy or any organized effort by Mr. On related to the incident,\u201d the district attorney added. \u201cGiven these factors, we believe that the appropriate course of action is to refer the matter to the Los Angeles City Attorney\u2019s Office, which will consider misdemeanor filing.\u201d CNN was the first to identify On, along with other counterprotesters, through a\u00a0review\u00a0of hundreds of hours of video, social media posts and interviews. Video shows the 18-year-old striking a pro-Palestinian protester with a pole and continuing to strike him even when he was down, as fellow counterprotesters piled on. The UCLA Police Department previously confirmed On was on the UCLA campus on April 30\u00a0and \u201cwas seen on video assaulting encampment occupants with a wooden pole.\u201d He was arrested by UCLA Police in Beverly Hills on May 23 and released\u00a0on\u00a0$30,000 bail the next day. On\u2019s mother initially boasted in a now-deleted social media post about her son\u2019s participation in the violent event, circling an image of him and writing \u201che is all over the news channels.\u201d She later told CNN her son denied being at UCLA that night. Law enforcement stood by for hours as counterprotesters attacked the encampment, one of dozens that erupted at college campuses to protest Israel\u2019s war in Gaza. While law enforcement did not track injuries fro\ufeffm the attack, the encampment\u2019s organizers previously said at least 25 protesters were taken to local emergency rooms for treatment for their injuries from April 30, which included fractures, severe lacerations and chemical-induced injuries. On is the first individual facing charges in connection with the violent attack. A criminal investigation into the events on April 30 at the UCLA campus is ongoing, according to the district attorney\u2019s office.

{"id": "2024_06_20_us_columbia-university-protesters-trespass-dismissed", "text": "A New York judge on Thursday dismissed trespassing cases against 30 individuals who were among the\u00a0dozens arrested\u00a0inside Columbia University\u2019s Hamilton Hall during a pro-Palestinian protest in April, with prosecutors citing a lack of evidence. Of the 46 initially arrested, 15 defendants still face charges, the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office said. Dozens of pro-Palestinian protesters were accused of unlawfully entering the university\u2019s Hamilton Hall on April 30 and barricading themselves inside before the university asked for assistance from the New York Police Department. After being removed from the building, many were charged with criminal trespass in the third degree, a class B misdemeanor. Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg said at the time he intended to look at each case and make decisions based on facts and the law. In the past, the Manhattan DA\u2019s office has declined to prosecute or deferred prosecution cases where large numbers of people were arrested as part of civil disobedience. During Thursday\u2019s court hearing, Judge Kevin McGrath dismissed 30 cases of trespass against those who have no criminal history. One other defendant previously had their case dismissed, for a total of 31 individuals no longer facing charges. \u201cAt the time of the charged conduct, the defendants were either staff employed by, or students enrolled in, Columbia University, and are now subject to student or staff disciplinary proceedings,\u201d according to the Manhattan DA\u2019s news release. In calling for the dismissal of charges Thursday, Assistant District Attorney Stephen Millan cited what he called \u201cextremely limited video,\u201d adding that \u201cthe security cameras were immediately covered by certain defendants,\u201d who prosecutors have been unable to identify. The available video evidence \u201cfails to establish or prove\u201d the 31 people participated in damaging university property or causing harm to anyone, making it difficult for prosecutors to prove anything other than trespassing at trial, the DA\u2019s office said. Also complicating matters, students inside Hamilton Hall were wearing face masks, making it difficult to tie students to specific acts, according to a law enforcement official. Columbia University on Thursday declined to comment on the court proceedings when contacted by CNN. Protesters \u2018unanimously\u2019 reject deals Fourteen of the defendants still facing charges \u2013 12 of whom were neither staff nor students at Columbia \u2013 have been offered Adjournments in Contemplation of Dismissal (ACD), the Manhattan DA\u2019s office said. An ACD allows a court to defer a defendant\u2019s case \u2013 with the potential that the defendant\u2019s charge will be dismissed \u2013 if the defendant does not engage in additional criminal conduct. But those defendants have refused the offer, they said at a news conference held outside the courtroom after Thursday\u2019s hearing, speaking to demonstrators wearing keffiyehs, a traditional Palestinian scarf. \u201cWe stand here today united by our action and the Palestinian cause,\u201d one of the protesters said. \u201cThe state has attempted, once again, to divide us \u2013 dismissing some of our cases and offering others deals in accordance with their outside agitator narrative,\u201d adding they reject the division they say is intended to \u201cpreserve the sanctity of Columbia University, not an institution in the city of New York but always above and apart from it.\u201d \u201cAll of us who took part in the liberation of Hind\u2019s Hall were driven by the same necessity to escalate, to escalate for Gaza, to resist the savage genocide of our siblings in Palestine,\u201d the protester continued, referring to Hamilton Hall by another name bestowed on it by protesters. \u201cWe exercised our shared right to oppose the US war machine by putting our bodies upon the years of Columbia, one of its most well-oiled domestic components.\u201d The protester said the defendants unanimously rejected deals to present a \u201cunited front against state repression.\u201d The 14 defendants are scheduled to appear back in court on July 25. \u201cThe only allegation that\u2019s different is they weren\u2019t currently enrolled as a student or weren\u2019t employed by the university,\u201d said public defender Matthew Daloisio, who is representing 43 defendants. Daloisio argued those defendants experienced the same police raid and got the same injuries as anyone else during the NYPD raid. A 15th defendant, James Carlson, 40, was arrested on burglary charges at Columbia University, is facing a charge of criminal trespass in the third degree from the Manhattan DA, according to court records. He is also facing an arson charge from a separate incident. He\u2019s pleaded not guilty in both cases, court records show. On Thursday, Carlson went before the judge, where the prosecutor recounted how he is being accused of involvement in the Hamilton Hall protest. Carlson is accused of damaging a NYPD camera and being involved in burning an Israeli flag. When the prosecutor described the flag burning in court, some supporters in the courtroom snickered, prompting the court officer to reprimand them, telling them to be quiet. The district attorney said there are ongoing school disciplinary proceedings for the students who had their case dismissed.

{"id": "2024_06_22_us_fordyce-arkansas-grocery-store-shooting-saturday", "text": "Families were shopping at a local grocery store in a small Arkansas town on Friday when the sound of gunfire reverberated through the store, sending them running for cover or huddling in a freezer. Katrina Doherty \u2013 who had been shopping for dinner with her 18-year-old daughter and 4-year-old son \u2013 said she first thought she heard the sound of something falling but then saw glass shatter and someone drop to the ground. That\u2019s when she knew shots were being fired. Outside, David Rodriguez was pulling into a gas station when he heard \u201cpops\u201d that he initially thought were fireworks. He then noticed the grocery store\u2019s front windows were broken \u2013 as if they had been \u201cshot open\u201d by gunfire, Rodriguez said. Panicked shoppers then started running away as gunshots were fired rapidly, Rodriguez said. A man had opened fire at the Mad Butcher in Fordyce, killing three people and wounding 10 others. Law enforcement responded around 11:30 a.m. and exchanged gunfire with the \u201clone suspect,\u201d according to Arkansas State Police. Cellphone video captured a man in the parking lot aiming a long gun and firing in multiple directions. Not finding an escape route, Doherty and others in the store hurriedly hid in a freezer. Doherty\u2019s daughter and son, who were in a different aisle, reunited with their mother in the back of the store and followed two store workers into the freezer. The 39-year-old mother said she heard about nine or ten rounds before making it into the icy shelter. \u201cWe ran in there really fast. We still heard gunshots keep going off,\u201d Doherty said. \u201cIt was like slow motion. My daughter was like \u2018Mama, pinch me, this can\u2019t be real.\u2019 And I was like, \u2019Baby, it\u2019s real.\u2019\u201d From outside, Rodriguez heard sirens and watched as ambulances and police arrived at the scene. Doherty couldn\u2019t hear what was happening outside, and when they tried to call 9-1-1, there was no service. The group stayed inside, enduring the freezing cold in \u201cpanic mode,\u201d with some praying and others crying, she recalled. Her son started to cry, \u201cbut we finally got him calmed down because I didn\u2019t want the shooter to hear.\u201d \u201cWe were just sitting there and praying. I was in panic mode. My son about froze to death. We tried to get him quiet, but he was saying he wanted his daddy. It felt like we were in there forever,\u201d Doherty said. \u201cWe were in there maybe 15 minutes. I was asking the Lord to protect over everybody. I was just praying. The other lady, she was praying. She was crying.\u201d At one point, one of the workers opened the freezer door, and saw someone dead right outside of it, Doherty said. The door remained shut until one of the store workers heard police outside, and they were then escorted out of the store, Doherty said. Once she was out of the store, Doherty reunited with her 15-year-old twin daughters who were waiting outside in the car during the shooting and ducked down when they heard the gunshots. Shirley Kay Taylor, 63, was one of the three dead, her daughter Angela Atchley told CNN on Saturday. Atchley says her mother, who loved her family and kids, \u201cwas the hardest working woman I know\u201d and a \u201cgreat person.\u201d \u201cWe are completely lost,\u201d Atchley said. The country has seen a spate of shootings in the past few weeks, with 21 mass shootings recorded by\u00a0the Gun Violence Archive\u00a0since last Friday. Shootings permeated a Michigan splash pad, a Texas Juneteenth celebration and a Massachusetts car meetup, among other locations. They are among at least 234 mass shootings have taken place in the United States in 2024,\u00a0according to data from the Gun Violence Archive, which, like CNN, defines a mass shooting as one in which four or more people are shot, excluding the shooter. The aftermath of the shooting Matthew Gill, the meat manager at the\u00a0Mad Butcher,\u00a0told CNN a man came into the store with a shotgun and ended up in a shootout with police. Two police officers were wounded in the gunfire. The suspected shooter, identified by authorities as 44-year-old Travis Eugene Posey, was also wounded and taken into custody. Posey, a resident of New Edinburg, is expected to be charged with three counts of capital murder, with additional charges pending, according to an Arkansas State Police\u00a0news release. He is set to appear in court on Monday, according to Dallas County prosecutor Eric Marks. The injuries to the officers and the suspect are not considered life-threatening, according to Mike Hagar, the secretary of public safety and director of Arkansas State Police. He noted the \u201csituation is secured \u2026 contained. There are no active threats to the community.\u201d \u201cThe remaining civilian injuries range from non-life threatening to extremely critical,\u201d he said. Posey was \u201ctreated for non-life-threatening\u00a0injuries after exchanging gunfire with law enforcement, released to ASP custody, and transported to the Ouachita County Detention Center,\u201d ASP said in the release. It is unclear if Posey has retained legal counsel at this point. Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders in a statement on\u00a0X said she had been briefed on the \u201ctragic shooting\u201d in Fordyce and is in \u201cconstant contact\u201d with state police at the scene. Fordyce, a small city in southeast Dallas County,\u00a0had a population\u00a0of just 3,396 in 2020. Fordyce City Council Member Roderick Rogers told CNN affiliate KATV that he was on the phone with someone in the store when the shooting took place. \u201cMan, it was bad,\u201d Rogers said. The council member said that he spoke with survivors of the shooting who \u201care traumatized.\u201d \u201cWe are trying to get some counseling and everything set up at the moment,\u201d he added.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/22/us/fordyce-arkansas-grocery-store-shooting-saturday/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/23/2024", "section": "us"}}

{"id": "2024_06_21_business_teamsters-president-speaking-republican-convention-trump", "text": "Teamsters President Sean O\u2019Brien will speak to the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee in July, a sign that former President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign is hoping to peel off the support of union members from President Joe Biden. But unlike other speakers at the RNC, O\u2019Brien\u2019s appearance does not represent an endorsement of Trump, according to Teamsters union spokesperson Kara Deniz. O\u2019Brien has requested the opportunity to also speak at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in August. The DNC has yet to accept that request, Deniz said. Trump posted the announcement Friday afternoon on his Truth Social platform. \u201cOur GREAT convention will unify Americans and demonstrate to the nation\u2019s working families they come first,\u201d Trump wrote. \u201cWhen I am back in the White House, the hardworking Teamsters, and all working Americans, will once again have a country they can afford to live in and be respected around the world. Sean, I look forward to seeing you represent the Teamsters in Milwaukee. Together we can Make America Great Again.\u201d Deniz said in an email that the union was happy Trump extended the invitation. \u201cThis is truly unprecedented since it will be the very first time a Teamsters General President has addressed the RNC,\u201d she said in an email. \u201cOur 1.3 million members\u00a0represent every political background, and their message needs to be heard by as wide an audience as possible, and that includes all political candidates running for elected office. We appreciate former President Trump\u2019s openness to inviting a labor leader to speak on behalf of working families.\u201d \u201cWe sincerely hope the DNC will also respond to our request with an invitation,\u201d she said. Trump and O\u2019Brien met at the former president\u2019s Mar-a-Lago resort in early January. Trump then met with the union\u2019s leadership on January 31. Some other union leaders objected to the meetings, with John Palmer \u2014 the group\u2019s international vice president at-large \u2014 writing a letter at that time denouncing Trump as \u201ca known union buster, scab, and insurrectionist.\u201d \u201cWe should never entertain dialogue with a candidate with such an anti-union record,\u201d he wrote. Biden has a very pro-union record. He became the first sitting president to appear on the picket line to support strikers during the United Auto Workers union\u2019s strike against the nation\u2019s three unionized automakers. He has regularly voiced support for unions and has appointed a very pro-union leadership to the National Labor Relations Board, which has been much friendlier to union positions during his administration. He also met with the Teamsters leadership in March. But so far, the Teamsters have endorsed neither candidate, unlike the AFL-CIO and many powerful unions, such as the UAW and the National Education Association. And the union\u2019s political arm gave similar size donations of hundreds of thousands of dollars to committees of both the Democratic and Republican parties earlier this year. O\u2019Brien has had his own harsh criticism of some other Republicans, if not Trump. At a Senate hearing in November, he and Sen. Markwayne Mullin, a Republican from Oklahoma, both said they were prepared to engage in a fist fight in the middle of a hearing until Sen. Bernie Sanders, the committee chair, ordered them to stop. The DNC said it has yet to settle on its set of speakers for its convention in August. \u201cWe are building a convention in Chicago that will tell our story to the American people, including the stories of labor and union leaders and workers that President Biden has been delivering\u00a0for as the most pro-union president in modern history,\u201d said DNC spokesperson Matt Hill. \u2013 CNN\u2019s Gregory Krieg and Kristen Holmes contributed to this report", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/21/business/teamsters-president-speaking-republican-convention-trump/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/23/2024", "section": "us"}}

{"id": "2024_06_22_business_ups-delivery-vans-air-conditioning", "text": "This was supposed to be the year that air conditioning came to UPS delivery vans. It hasn\u2019t worked out that way. Despite a promise in the contract reached with the Teamsters union last year, UPS has not yet purchased any new vans with AC, even as temperatures soar across the country and the dangers of extreme heat put workers in harms way in and out of doors. Almost none of the nearly 100,000 brown package vans have AC. Temperatures inside the trucks, both the cab and especially the cargo space where drivers need to go to fetch and drop off packages, can regularly get well over 120 degrees, according to the Teamsters union, which represents more than 300,000 UPS employees. The union\u2019s demand for relief from the heat for its nearly 100,000 members working as delivery drivers was a major sticking point in contract negotiations last year between the union and the package delivery giant.\u00a0It was far more than an issue of comfort; it was a worker safety issue, according to the union. Drivers have been known to suffer heatstroke, with some coming close to death, while on the job in the vans. And as part of the contract reached in late July of last year, UPS agreed that all vans purchased after January 1 would include air conditioning. UPS also agreed to retrofit existing vans with fans in the cab, heat shields under the cargo area and what are known as \u201cscoop air intakes\u201d in the cargo area. The fans have been installed in all the vans, UPS said. About two thirds have been retrofitted with the heat shields and air scoops, reducing the temperature in the rear cargo by about 17 degrees on average, according to the company. But there have been no vans purchased this year, so no additional AC vans are on the roads. The company said van purchase decisions are based on package volume and the need to replace existing fleet, and there has been no need to make purchases so far. The Teamsters are not pleased by the lack of progress on the AC. \u201cWe are midway\u00a0into the summer, and frankly UPS is not moving fast enough,\u201d said the union in a statement to CNN. \u201cWe are aware that UPS has installed all contractually required second fans, and UPS is ahead of schedule in the installation of heat shields and air induction scoops for package compartment ventilation. But it\u2019s not enough.\u201d There are a small number of vans \u2013 in the hundreds \u2013 that have AC. Those are electric vans, or specialized vans for rural area that can go on gravel roads, UPS said. But they make up only a small fraction of the 94,000 UPS package vans on American roads. The number of vans with AC was bound to grow slowly. Some vans can last for more than 15 years. Retrofitting the existing fleet was going to bring more immediate relief. UPS told CNN it is very concerned with workers\u2019 safety and that AC was never going to be key to its heat mitigation efforts. In addition to the heat shield and air scoops, it has installed an additional 1,500 ice machines and 1,700 water fountains in its facilities. It said it also provided specialized cooling gear for UPS drivers and inside staff\u00a0to wear, as well as water jugs for drivers. And for inside workers it has installed additional fans in its buildings\u00a0and will install more. But AC is still a rarity in the UPS vans on the road.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/22/business/ups-delivery-vans-air-conditioning/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/23/2024", "section": "us"}}

It will be the first time in history, according to organizers, that content creators will be able to cover the convention alongside traditional media outlets. Convention committee officials said in a statement that they are making the move in part because content creators have \u201crevolutionized the way Americans consume information and content.\u201d \u201cWe are leveling the playing field between content creators and traditional media and ensuring that more Americans than ever before are able to experience and engage with this critical part of our Democratic process,\u201d said Cayana Mackey-Nance, Democratic National Convention Committee director of digital strategy. It\u2019s a clear move from the convention organizing committee to try to reach young voters, who increasingly get their news from nontraditional sources. A\u00a0recent survey from\u00a0the Harvard Institute of Politics that polled adults ages 18-29 showed that 25% get their news from YouTube, 25% from Instagram and 23% from\u00a0TikTok. \u201cWe are meeting Americans where they are and making sure they know what\u2019s on the line in November, no matter how or where they see their content,\u201d said Matt Hill, the DNCC\u2019s senior director of communications. Young voters will be a key deciding bloc in the 2024 election. A\u00a0recent poll\u00a0from The New York Times/Siena College showed President Joe Biden with a 2% lead over Donald Trump among likely voters ages 18-29, well within the poll\u2019s margin of error. CNN exit poll results from 2020 show voters in that age bracket broke 60% for Biden and 36% for Trump. The convention, which takes place from August 19 to 22,\u00a0is expected to draw a crowd of 50,000 visitors \u2013 including delegates, media and vendors \u2013 to Chicago, where Democrats are poised to nominate\u00a0Biden\u00a0for reelection.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/22/politics/democratic-national-convention-content-creators/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/23/2024", "section": "us"}}

The couple went for a swim Thursday afternoon with two of their teens when they got into trouble while in the water, authorities said. The sheriff\u2019s office identified 51-year-old Brian Warter and his partner 48-year-old Erica Wishard as the victims. They were traveling with three children each and were part of a family of eight vacationing in Florida, the sheriff\u2019s office told CNN affiliate WPEC. \u201cThey stepped right into a riptide according to our witnesses and were immediately taken over by the power of the ocean,\u201d Chief Deputy John Budensiek told CNN affiliate WPBF. The teens were able to break free of the current and attempted to help the adults, but when it became too dangerous they were forced to swim ashore, the sheriff\u2019s office said in a release. \u201cThey are teenagers. They\u2019re not even in their 20s yet. They\u2019ve been through two dramatic scenarios,\u201d Budensiek told WPEC. Despite efforts by the Martin County Ocean Rescue, paramedics and doctors at Cleveland Clinic Martin North Hospital, the couple could not be saved. The children were under the watch of the Martin County Sheriff\u2019s Crisis Intervention Team as they waited for other family members to arrive in Florida. \u201cThey\u2019re on the beach and watched them (the parents) drown. They watched the resuscitation efforts on the beach. They were at the hospital watching some resuscitation efforts, so they\u2019re extremely traumatized,\u201d Budensiek added, according to WPEC. Rip currents are localized currents that flow away from the shoreline toward the ocean, and a person caught in it, even a very strong swimmer, can be swept away from the shore very quickly, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The United States Life Saving Association says rip currents typically form at breaks in sandbars and near structures such as jetties and piers, and account for more than 80% of rescues performed by surf beach lifeguards.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/21/us/rip-current-florida-drowning-hutchinson-island/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/23/2024", "section": "us"}}

{"id": "2024_06_22_us_stoic-philosophers-election-anxiety-cec", "text": "Some people obsessively monitor presidential election polls. Others ignore any political news like an overdue bill. And a few probably wish they could just press a button and fast-forward past this November. Americans have devised all sorts of strategies to deal with the unrelenting stress of this year\u2019s presidential race. The rematch between President Biden and former President Trump has been called \u201cthe most dreaded election in modern political history.\u201d As the two rivals prepare to debate on Thursday, about six in 10 American adults say they are already\u00a0worn out\u00a0by campaign coverage. But there\u2019s another way to cope with anxiety about the future \u2014 by turning to the past. Mention the\u00a0Stoic philosophers\u00a0of ancient Greece and Rome, and it may conjure images of\u00a0boring, bearded White men in togas who lived thousands of years ago. But sages like\u00a0Epictetus\u00a0and\u00a0Marcus Aurelius\u00a0offer plenty of practical advice for today\u2019s voters who are navigating the relentless grind of this year\u2019s presidential election. Stoic philosophy, which\u00a0teaches\u00a0that it is impossible to live a happy life without living virtuously, also talks a lot about confronting one\u2019s worse fears. The definition of Stoicism varies, but bestselling author\u00a0Ryan Holiday\u00a0describes it as the a \u201ctool in the pursuit of self-mastery, perseverance and wisdom.\u201d The first Stoic school was founded in Athens by a philosopher named\u00a0Zeno\u00a0of Citium around the beginning of the 3rd\u00a0century BC. Zeno, who lost his entire fortune in a shipwreck, found consolation in philosophy. He later quipped, \u201cMy most profitable journey began on the day I was shipwrecked and lost my entire fortune.\u201d We too can begin such a journey, Holiday says. He says that like us, the Stoics also knew something about dealing with loss, political instability and living in a time when many people felt politically powerless. He cites Aurelius, a Stoic follower who became one of Rome\u2019s greatest emperors. He led Rome during a\u00a0global pandemic\u00a0that killed at least 10 million people and grappled constantly with war and murderous political divisions. \u201cAurelius experienced this devastating global pandemic that ravaged society,\u201d says Holiday, who just released\u00a0\u201cRight Thing, Right Now,\u201d\u00a0the third installment in his bestselling book series on Stoic virtues. \u00a0\u201cBut he would have also seen what it [the pandemic] did to people: the tribalism, the fear, the anger along with the flights of fancy. He saw everything that we just saw over the last couple of years.\u201d CNN talked to Holiday and\u00a0Massimo Pigliucci, author of \u201cHow to Be a Stoic: Using Ancient Philosophy to Live a Modern Life.\u201d Both authors, through books, videos and podcasts, are two of the most popular modern-day interpreters of Stoicism. They offered three pieces of Stoic advice for handling the anxiety of this year\u2019s election. Don\u2019t let the future destroy the present It pays to look ahead in the world of politics. Pollsters predict trends. Pundits gauge the potential impact of political gaffes. Party leaders assess the implications of court decisions. Worry about the future is constant. That type of worry, though, spreads like a contagion to voters. People obsess about what will happen to them if the wrong candidate is elected. Some fixate on nightmare scenarios about the country descending into civil war. This grinding anxiety echoes Shakespeare\u2019s famous\u00a0line\u00a0from \u201cJulius Caesar\u201d: \u201cA coward dies a thousand times, a hero dies but once.\u201d Stoics only die once, though, because they reject fixating on the future. Stoicism teaches people to separate what they can control from what they cannot. Their advice: don\u2019t become engulfed by nightmare political scenarios that may or may not come to pass. \u201cThe Stoics say that he who suffers before it is necessary, suffers more than is necessary,\u201d Holiday says. \u201cThe idea that you should wake up every day in miserable anticipation of a thing that may or may not happen is to punish yourself on top of whatever the pain that will come from that thing actually happening,\u201d Holiday says. Pigliucci says Stoics coped with the political turbulence of their day by focusing on what they could control: their emotions. He cites the\u00a0Serenity Prayer,\u00a0which is often recited at 12-step programs. The prayer is attributed to\u00a0Reinhold Niebuhr, a towering Christian theologian from the 20th century, and asks God to \u201cgrant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, courage to change the things I can, and wisdom to know the difference.\u201d \u201cSeems like excellent advice for the upcoming presidential elections,\u201d Pigliucci\u00a0says. \u201cHave the courage to do your duty as a citizen; vote, maybe send money or volunteer for a campaign; then accept the outcome because it will be what it will be.\u201d Don\u2019t be too cynical to get involved Maybe you\u2019ve met this type of person. They don\u2019t vote because they say it won\u2019t make a difference.\u00a0 You might hear them in a barbershop or perched on a barstool, griping.\u00a0All politicians are corrupt. The\u00a0Illuminati\u00a0control everything. Pass me a beer. Some people deal with the anxiety of the election by checking out of politics altogether. The ancient Athenians had a word for citizens that refused to exercise their right to vote. They called them\u00a0\u201cidiotai,\u201d\u00a0from which the word \u201cidiot\u201d is derived. Many Stoic leaders would never be labeled as \u201cidiotai.\u201d They were passionately involved in politics and the pursuit of justice. That may surprise people. Stoics get a bad rap because of the way the way the word is\u00a0defined: someone \u201cindifferent to pain or pleasure,\u201d not showing \u201cpassion or feeling.\u201d But ancient Stoic leaders would have been at home jousting on Sunday morning political talk shows or marching in a Black Lives Matter protest. Holiday says Aurelius wrote constantly about justice in his classic book,\u00a0\u201cMeditations.\u201d \u201cHe talks about the\u00a0common good\u00a0more than 80 times in \u2018Meditations,\u201d\u00a0 Holiday says. \u201cHe talks about it more than just about anything. He actually says the whole purpose of life is good character and acts for the common good.\u201d The stereotype of the dispassionate, uninvolved Stoic is \u201cas wrong as it could possibly be,\u201d Holiday says. \u201cIf you look at the actual lives of Stoics, these are people who got married, had families, ran for public office and fought for causes,\u201d Holiday says. \u201cThere was a generation of Stoics that were such a perpetual thorn in the side of emperors that they were known as the\u00a0Stoic Opposition.\u00a0At one point, all of them are kicked out of Rome because they won\u2019t go along to get along.\u201d Cynicism can be masked cowardice \u2014 some cynics are afraid of the risks that come with getting involved. But the Stoic leaders were known for their courage in standing up to political tyrants. Pigliucci tells a famous\u00a0story\u00a0about political courage that centers on \u00a0Helvidius Priscus,\u00a0a Stoic philosopher. When the Roman emperor Vespasian threatened\u00a0Priscus, the Stoic philosopher, with execution for speaking out against political tyranny, Priscus responded by saying: \u201cWell, when have I ever claimed to you that I\u2019m immortal? You fulfill your role, and I\u2019ll fulfill mine. It is yours to have me killed, and mine to die without a tremor; it is yours to send me into exile, and mine to depart without a qualm.\u201d Be kind, even to your political enemies It\u2019s hard not to be cynical when it comes to US presidential politics. Candidates brazenly lie on the campaign trail. Partisan websites and social media platforms spread so much disinformation that\u2019s hard to know what to believe. Politicians who once loudly opposed certain candidates now bend the knee to curry their favor. It\u2019s easy for our dislike for our political opponents to morph into hatred. But Holiday suggests we consider how Aurelius dealt with political treachery in his time.\u00a0 Aurelius survived an attempted coup from his most trusted general. He had unlimited power and could have devised an array of sadistic measures to torment or kill his traitor. \u00a0But he refused to do so. \u201cIn fact, he wept when he was deprived of the chance to grant clemency to his former enemy,\u201d Holiday writes in an\u00a0essay\u00a0on Aurelius. \u201cThe best revenge, Marcus would write \u201cis to not be like that.\u201d When family or friends insult you or stop talking to you because of a political disagreement, it\u2019s easy to respond in kind. The Stoics, though, have two words of advice, Holiday says: Be kind. That may sound na\u00efve when personal attacks have become the norm in modern-day politics and this year\u2019s presidential race. But Epictetus\u00a0said\u00a0that \u201cAny person capable of angering you becomes your master.\u201d \u201cThe Stoics said we should try to see every person we meet as an opportunity for kindness,\u201d Holiday writes in his new book. Holiday says that when Aurelius was on his deathbed, he had one regret: He was still chastising himself over the times he had had lost his temper and been unkind to others. Holiday says he\u2019s had to apply that Stoic advice to his own personal life.\u00a0He has risen in prominence in part because he\u2019s sold a\u00a0reported\u00a06 million books on Stoicism. He\u2019s also built a mini-empire around Stoicism that includes YouTube videos, an Instagram feed and a Stoic newsletter. His elevated public profile has led to some personal challenges. He says he and his family have been constantly harassed because they have taken stands against book banning, in support of women\u2019s rights, and for the removal of Confederate monuments. A friend betrayed him. Holiday says a younger version of himself would have \u201cwanted blood\u201d for those who have tried to hurt him. Instead he considered the actions of Stoic leaders like Aurelius, drawing a direct link between the \u201cdark energy\u201d that the Stoic leaders faced in their time and what he sees in the 2024 presidential election cycle. \u201cThere is this energy across all societies that is driven by hatred, fear, and that wants to protect what it has and prevent other people from getting their piece of it,\u201d Holiday tells CNN. \u201cAnd that energy was certainly there in Roman times. \u201c But solutions to that dark energy are there, too. Stoic leaders may seem like distant figures encased in marble, but we can learn from them, Holiday says. They wrestled with and ultimately defeated the same dark energy that drove the political tribalization of their day. So can we.

The swapped photo appeared in East Brunswick High School\u2019s 2024 yearbook that was handed out to the senior class \u2013 prompting an independent investigation that started on June 6 and was completed on Tuesday, according to attorney Yaacov Brisman, whose law firm was retained\u00a0by the school district\u00a0to conduct the probe. Seniors who received the yearbooks had been asked to return them so that the errant page can be replaced, CNN previously reported. An unidentified school staff member who served as a Yearbook Club advisor placed the incorrect image in the yearbook, Brisman said in the report. \u201cI conclude that the use of the incorrect photograph was not purposeful, but rather was a highly unfortunate error,\u201d Brisman wrote in the findings, adding the staff member\u2019s actions were \u201cat best careless\u201d but \u201ccan also be considered negligent.\u201d \u201c\u2026 I have no basis to find that she acted out of any animus, racial, religious, or political, towards Jewish or Muslim students,\u201d he said\u00a0in the report.
