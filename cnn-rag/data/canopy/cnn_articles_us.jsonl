{"id": "2024_07_16_us_tuskegee-syphilis-study-whistleblower-peter-buxtun-death", "text": "New York (AP) \u2014 Peter Buxtun, the whistleblower who revealed that the US government allowed hundreds of Black men in rural Alabama to go untreated for syphilis in what became known as the Tuskegee study, has died. He was 86. Buxtun died May 18 of Alzheimer\u2019s disease in Rocklin, California, according to his attorney, Minna Fernan. Buxtun is revered as a hero to public health scholars and ethicists for his role in bringing to light the\u00a0most notorious medical research scandal\u00a0in US history. Documents that Buxtun provided to The Associated Press, and its subsequent investigation and reporting, led to a public outcry that ended the study in 1972. Forty years earlier, in 1932, federal scientists began studying 400 Black men in Tuskegee, Alabama, who were infected with syphilis. When antibiotics became available in the 1940s that could treat the disease, federal health officials ordered that the drugs be withheld. The study became an observation of how the disease ravaged the body over time. In the mid-1960s, Buxtun was a federal public health employee working in San Francisco when he overheard a co-worker talking about the study. The research wasn\u2019t exactly a secret \u2014 about a dozen medical journal articles about it had been published in the previous 20 years. But hardly anyone had raised any concerns about how the experiment was being conducted. \u201cThis study was completely accepted by the American medical community,\u201d said Ted Pestorius of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, speaking at a 2022 program marking the 50th anniversary of the end of the study. Buxtun had a different reaction. After learning more about the study, he raised ethical concerns in a 1966 letter to officials at the CDC. In 1967, he was summoned to a meeting in Atlanta, where he was chewed out by agency officials for what they deemed to be impertinence. Repeatedly, agency leaders rejected his complaints and his call for the men in Tuskegee to be treated. He left the US Public Health Service and attended law school, but the study ate at him. In 1972, he provided documents about the research to Edith Lederer, an AP reporter he had met in San Francisco. Lederer passed the documents to AP investigative reporter Jean Heller, telling her colleague, \u201cI think there might be something here.\u201d Heller\u2019s story was published on July 25, 1972, leading to congressional hearings, a class-action lawsuit that resulted in a $10 million\u00a0settlement\u00a0and the study\u2019s termination about four months later. In 1997, President Bill Clinton formally\u00a0apologized\u00a0for the study, calling it \u201cshameful.\u201d The leader of a group dedicated to the memory of the study participants said Monday they are grateful to Buxtun for exposing the experiment. \u201cWe are thankful for his honesty and his courage,\u201d said Lille Tyson Head, whose father was in the study. Buxtun was born in Prague in 1937. His father was Jewish, and his family immigrated to the US in 1939 from Nazi-occupied Czechoslovakia, eventually settling in Irish Bend, Oregon, on the Columbia River. In his complaints to federal health officials, he drew comparisons between the Tuskegee study and medical experiments Nazi doctors had conducted on Jews and other prisoners. Federal scientists didn\u2019t believe they were guilty of the same kind of moral and ethical sins, but after the Tuskegee study was exposed, the\u00a0government put in place new rules\u00a0about how it conducts medical research. Today, the study is often blamed for the unwillingness of some African Americans to participate in medical research. \u201cPeter\u2019s life experiences led him to immediately identify the study as morally indefensible and to seek justice in the form of treatment for the men. Ultimately, he could not relent,\u201d said the CDC\u2019s Pestorius. Buxtun attended the University of Oregon, served in the US Army as a combat medic and psychiatric social worker and joined the federal health service in 1965. Buxtun went on to write, give presentations and win awards for his involvement in the Tuskegee study. A global traveler, he collected and sold antiques, especially military weapons and swords and gambling equipment from California\u2019s Gold Rush era. He also spent more than 20 years trying to recover his family\u2019s properties confiscated by the Nazis and was partly successful. \u201cPeter was wise, witty, classy and unceasingly generous,\u201d said David M. Golden, a close friend of Buxtun\u2019s for over 25 years. \u201cHe was a staunch advocate for personal freedoms and spoke often against prohibition, whether it be drugs, prostitution or firearms.\u201d Another longtime friend, Angie Bailie, said she attended many of Buxtun\u2019s presentations about Tuskegee. \u201cPeter never ended a single talk without fighting back tears,\u201d she said Buxtun himself could be self-effacing about his actions, saying he did not anticipate the vitriolic reaction of some health officials when he started questioning the study\u2019s ethics. At a Johns Hopkins University forum in 2018, Buxtun was asked where he got the moral strength to blow the whistle. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t strength,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was stupidity.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/16/us/tuskegee-syphilis-study-whistleblower-peter-buxtun-death/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/20/2024", "section": "us"}}

The Association of Professional Flight Attendants, which represents the flight attendants, said the deal addresses their concerns about compensation, work rules and retroactive pay. It did not offer more details. Reached after more than three years of negotiations, the tentative agreement will be sent to the union\u2019s board for review. Once the board approves the deal, members will vote on ratifying it. \u201cIf approved, this agreement will put billions of additional dollars into compensation and work rules for our flight attendant workgroup,\u201d said union head Julie Hedrick. The White House had been closely monitoring the talks in recent months and had been concerned about the impact of a work stoppage. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and acting Labor Secretary Julie Su had earlier been involved in the talks. President Joe Biden on Friday praised the deal saying it \u201caverts a strike that would have been devastating for the industry and consumers\u201d and demonstrates \u201conce again that collective bargaining benefits workers, companies, and our economy.\u201d American said the contract will provide immediate financial and quality-of-life improvements for the employees.

American\u2019s flight attendants had authorized their union to call a strike if there wasn\u2019t a deal. The union had proposed an immediate raise of about 33%, saying the flight attendants had not had a pay raise in over five years and endured a lot since the pandemic, notably unruly passengers. The contract negotiations started in January 2020 but paused at the height of the pandemic.

I was powerless. I couldn\u2019t do anything,\u201d the two-time Super Bowl champion told CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett on Wednesday. The incident happened Saturday at the end of a flight from Denver to Orange County, California. Davis, 51, was flying with his wife, two sons and daughter when one of the sons asked for a cup of ice during beverage service, Davis wrote on Instagram. A flight attendant \u201ceither didn\u2019t hear or ignored his request and continued past our row,\u201d the post read. \u201cI calmly reached behind me and lightly tapped (the attendant\u2019s) arm to get his attention to again ask for a cup of ice for my son,\u201d Davis wrote.  \u201cHe shouted, \u2018Don\u2019t hit me,\u2019 and left the cart to hurriedly approach the front of the plane. I was confused, as were the passengers in front of me who witnessed the exchange. I thought nothing of it other than this particular employee was incredibly rude and blatantly wrong in his accusations of me hitting him.\u201d Davis said he did not see or interact with the attendant for the rest of the flight. After the plane landed in Orange County, the pilot asked passengers to remain seated, and FBI and law enforcement agents went to Davis\u2019s seat, put him in handcuffs and took him off the plane \u2013 with the scene \u201crecorded by multiple passengers,\u201d he wrote. \u201cMy boys were there. And my daughter was there. And my wife is there,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cI\u2019m wondering what\u2019s going on. They didn\u2019t ask me any questions. I had no chance to even explain.\u201d Davis\u2019 wife, Tamiko Davis, said she knew her husband couldn\u2019t even question why he was being handcuffed and taken away. \u201cTerrell knows better. Unfortunately, historically, in these situations, interaction with law enforcement as a Black man \u2026 you can\u2019t ask,\u201d she told CNN. \u201cSo thank God my husband has the wherewithal, the class, the understanding to know, in that moment, all he could do was sit there and comply and be humiliated in front of his sons and the 200 \u2026 however many people were on that plane. They didn\u2019t give him any other options.\u201d Wife and kids were left \u2018to fend for ourselves\u2019 Davis said he strives to be a positive role model for his kids and teach them to do the right thing \u2013 which makes the sight of him getting taken away in handcuffs even more heartbreaking. \u201cWe did the right thing. We didn\u2019t do anything. Yet I found myself with handcuffs, being paraded off a plane and being treated like a convict,\u201d Davis said. After Davis was taken off the plane, \u201cWe were just left to fend for ourselves on a flight with everyone staring at us,\u201d his wife said told ABC\u2019s \u201cGood Morning America\u201d earlier Wednesday. Later, \u201cDuring questioning, it was rightfully determined by the agents that this flight attendant was inaccurate in his accusations and the agents profusely apologized,\u201d Davis wrote. United Airlines has \u201cremoved the flight attendant from duty while we closely review this matter,\u201d the company said in an email to CNN Monday evening. \u201cThis is clearly not the kind of travel experience we strive to provide, and we have reached out to Mr. Davis\u2019 team to apologize,\u201d United Airlines\u2019 email read. Davis is still waiting for a direct apology from United Airlines, he told \u201cGMA\u201d Wednesday morning. \u201cThey have not reached out to me to apologize,\u201d he told ABC. \u201cThey have reached out to my attorney, but I have not heard from them directly. And so that, to me, is a problem.\u201d CNN reached out to United Airlines for comment after Davis\u2019 remarks Wednesday. \u201cWe have nothing new to share,\u201d United\u2019s media relations department said. \u2018We are held to a different standard\u2019 The Davises said they\u2019re not certain what race the flight attendant is. But they said Black men are often treated differently \u2013 and they\u2019re raising their sons to beware of that cruel reality. \u201cThe traumatizing experience of my two sons, my daughter and my wife watching me being placed in handcuffs \u2013 without due process or any explanation \u2013 cannot be undone,\u201d Davis wrote on Instagram. \u201cI certainly felt like that wouldn\u2019t have happened if I were a White person,\u201d Davis told CNN. \u201cThat\u2019s what I felt. Whether that\u2019s true or not, that\u2019s a different conversation.\u201d The FBI\u2019s Los Angeles field office acknowledged Monday that agents and law enforcement partners respond to a report of an incident with a flight that landed Saturday at Orange County\u2019s John Wayne Airport. A person who was detained for questioning \u201cwas cooperative with law enforcement and was released to continue his travels,\u201d the FBI office said. The FBI does not provide details of incidents or names of people who might have been interviewed unless charges are filed publicly, FBI field office spokesperson Laura Eimiller said. What happened on the flight \u201cis appalling and disturbing to say the least,\u201d Parker Stinar, managing partner of the Chicago-based law firm representing Davis told CNN this week. \u201cWe plan on fully investigating\u00a0the events that took place and are actively contacting United Airlines in this matter,\u201d Stinar wrote. Now, instead of vacationing with his children, Davis is using his clout to raise awareness about mistreatment and hopefully \u201caffect change,\u201d he told \u201cGMA.\u201d As one of only eight running backs to have rushed more than 2,000 yards in an NFL season, Davis played seven seasons in the NFL \u2013 all with the Broncos \u2013 from 1995 to 2001, and helped the Broncos win two Super Bowls in January 1998 and January 1999. He was named MVP of that first title game, rushing for 157 yards and scoring three touchdowns in the Broncos\u2019 31-24 win over the Green Bay Packers. The three-time Pro Bowler was enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2017. But despite his fame, Davis said he and other Black men are often treated differently. He wants his sons to keep an open mind if they feel they\u2019re being perceived differently \u2013 \u201cI always try to go through a checklist of things that it could be, and I always try to use race as like the last sort of possible thing,\u201d Davis told CNN. \u201cBut I always tell them: What applies to everybody else doesn\u2019t apply to you,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re always trying to teach them that there\u2019s consequences, but we are held to a different standard.\u201d CNN\u2019s Jason Hanna, Raja Razek, Cindy Von Quednow and Kelly McCleary contributed to this report.

{"id": "2024_07_19_politics_democratic-defections-joe-biden", "text": "President Joe Biden faced a new round of defections Friday from Democratic lawmakers publicly calling on him to leave the presidential race, even as his campaign sought to project a message that he isn\u2019t going anywhere. One day after the Republican National Convention, new public calls for Biden to drop out from a dozen lawmakers \u2013 including Democratic Sen. Martin Heinrich of New Mexico and California Rep. Zoe Lofgren, a close ally to former Speaker Nancy Pelosi \u2013 grew the list of congressional Democrats to more than 30. Two House Democrats close to Pelosi, speaking on condition of anonymity given the sensitivity and rawness in the party right now, attributed Friday\u2019s new statements \u2013 especially Lofgren\u2019s letter to Biden \u2013 to the former speaker and her belief that it is critical for the president and his allies to understand the effort to push him aside is not going away after the Republican convention, despite the campaign\u2019s efforts to quash it. The president is described by a source with direct knowledge as \u201cseething\u201d at Pelosi. This source said the sentiment only grew Friday when Lofgren, Pelosi\u2019s longtime close lieutenant, released her letter urging Biden to step aside. CNN has reached out to Pelosi\u2019s camp and the Biden campaign for comment on this reporting. It is a remarkable break between two powerful party elders and longtime allies in enacting key elements of the Biden agenda. Aides to Vice President Kamala Harris inside and outside the campaign have also expressed unhappiness with Pelosi and her talk of a quick process to find a new candidate should Biden step aside. To them, \u201cprocess\u201d means trying to bypass the vice president in the event the president stepped aside.\u00a0Harris, who has staunchly defended Biden publicly and tried to show unity, spoke with donors on a call Friday afternoon, which she was asked to do by the West Wing, according to campaign officials. Biden\u2019s campaign hoped to force party unity Friday, releasing a statement from Biden saying he was looking forward to hitting the campaign trail next week after being sidelined with Covid-19. And Biden campaign chair Jen O\u2019Malley\u00a0Dillon went on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe\u201d Friday morning to say Biden was \u201cabsolutely\u201d in the race. \u201cAbsolutely the president\u2019s in this race. You heard him say that time and time again, and I think we saw on display last night exactly why,\u201d she said. \u201cJoe\u00a0Biden\u00a0is more committed than ever to beat Donald Trump.\u201d Instead, there was a stream of new statements from House Democrats. The dynamic has played out repeatedly this week, as more and more Democrats have made public their desire for Biden to leave the race \u2013 in addition to reports of congressional Democratic leaders pushing Biden about his chances \u2013 even as the president repeatedly says he has no intention to drop out. A Democratic lawmaker\u00a0told CNN that House\u00a0Democratic Leader\u00a0Hakeem Jeffries and his team are not discouraging members from continuing to speak out against Biden\u2019s candidacy. The source said it was their impression that\u00a0members were privately being encouraged to make such statements if they felt that way. For some of those who want Biden to step down, this source said that there is a fear that the public pile-on, which is expected to grow, is overkill and making Biden mad and potentially even more dug in. This source, who is in touch with the White House, said\u00a0that while Biden is now more open to the conversation about potentially stepping aside, he \u201ccould go either way\u201d and that the people he is listening to aren\u2019t talking publicly. That concern didn\u2019t stop more calls for Biden to leave the race on Friday. Lofgren, who served on the House January 6 committee, released a letter she sent to Biden urging him to step aside.\u00a0\u201cSimply put, your candidacy is on a trajectory to\u00a0lose the White House and potentially impact crucial House and Senate races down ballot,\u201d she wrote. Heinrich was the third senator to publicly call for Biden to leave the race, saying he believed it was \u201cin the best interests of our country\u201d for Biden to step aside. \u201cBy passing the torch, he would secure his legacy as one of our nation\u2019s greatest leaders and allow us to unite behind a candidate who can best defeat Donald Trump and safeguard the future of our democracy,\u201d\u00a0Heinrich said in a statement. Rep. Greg Landsman, an Ohio Democrat, told Dana Bash on CNN\u2019s \u201cInside Politics\u201d Friday that it was time for Biden to drop out. \u201cPassing the torch is the right thing to do,\u201d Landsman said. \u201cThat is the way to ensure that Donald Trump doesn\u2019t win the presidency.\u201d And four other House Democrats \u2013 Reps. Jared Huffman and Mark Pocan; a member of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, Chuy Garcia; and a member of the Congressional Black Caucus, Marc Veasey \u2013 released a joint statement Friday, using the same \u201cpass the torch\u201d rhetoric. \u201cPassing the torch would fundamentally change the trajectory of the campaign,\u201d they said. \u201cIt would reinvigorate the race and infuse Democrats with enthusiasm and momentum heading into our convention next month.\u201d Lawmakers urging Biden to stay in the race have warned about the unchartered waters that the party would enter if Biden were to drop out.\u00a0Biden\u2019s campaign released a new memo Friday saying that there \u201cis no plan for an alternative nominee.\u201d DNC officials met by phone Friday for a convention rules committee meeting, where they\u00a0shared few details on when a virtual roll call to renominate Biden. During the meeting, party leaders reiterated that voting wouldn\u2019t start before August 1, but didn\u2019t set a specific date. Instead, under the proposed plan, it will be up to party leadership to pick a date at a later time. The rules committee didn\u2019t take any steps to approve the plan Friday but will meet again next week.

Seven men and two women ranging in age from 23 to 38 were wounded when an assailant fired on a group of people in Cleveland\u2019s Warehouse District shortly before 2:30 a.m. on July 9, 2023. Jaylon Jennings, after pleading no contest in court, was found guilty by a judge of every charge he faced: nine counts of attempted murder, 18 counts of felonious assault, two counts of having a weapon under disability, and one count each of grand theft and receiving stolen property, the Cuyahoga County\u00a0prosecutor\u2019s office\u00a0in Ohio said Wednesday. Jennings\u2019 plea is \u201ca firm reminder that gun violence is unacceptable\u201d and his office will hold \u201cviolent crime offenders\u201d accountable, Prosecutor Michael C. O\u2019Malley said in a release. Jennings is scheduled to be sentenced at the Cuyahoga County Justice Center on September 3. CNN has sought comment from Jennings\u2019 attorney, Fernando Mack. An investigation conducted by Cleveland police revealed the shooting was targeted and not random, according to the prosecutor\u2019s office. Eight of the victims appeared to be part of a targeted group of friends, and the ninth was struck while standing nearby, officials said. \u201cWhat was supposed to be a fun night out in the heart of downtown Cleveland quickly turned into a nightmare for these nine individuals and dozens of others on West 6th Street,\u201d O\u2019Malley said. \u201cIt is a miracle that no one was killed, and more people were not injured. Our community continues to be plagued by gun violence.\u201d Jennings was arrested on July 11, 2023, and a second man was arrested on July 15 in connection with the shooting. After Jennings and Kevin Del Valle-Salaman, 24,\u00a0left a bar and lounge on West 6th\u00a0Street on July 9, 2023, Jennings retrieved a firearm from\u00a0Del Valle-Salaman\u2019s car, officials said. Jennings then waited for some of the victims to exit the bar before firing multiple shots in their direction, according to the release. Afterward, both men ran back to the vehicle and fled the scene, according to the prosecutor\u2019s office. Del Valle-Salaman pleaded guilty in early January to\u00a0one count of tampering with evidence and one count of obstructing justice, according to the release. Del Valle-Salaman\u00a0will be sentenced at the Cuyahoga County Justice Center on a later date.\u00a0His attorney, Kevin Cafferkey, had no comment when reached by CNN. The incident was one of 656 mass shootings that happened in 2023, according to the\u00a0Gun Violence Archive, which, like CNN, defines a mass shooting as one in which four or more people are shot, excluding the shooter. US Rep. Shontel Brown\u00a0\u2013 who represents Cleveland, part of Ohio\u2019s 11th District \u2013 urged Congress in a statement following the shooting to do more to stem gun violence, specifically calling for universal background checks, banning assault weapons and addressing gun trafficking, among other measures. \u201cGun violence is devastating Northeast Ohio and Clevelanders deserve to be safe,\u201d Brown said last year. \u201cThis epidemic is tearing at the fabric of our communities, and it will not end without significant legislative action.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/17/us/cleveland-mass-shooting-conviction-nine-injured/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/20/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_07_16_us_trump-rally-security-errors-list", "text": "Security errors, lapses and missed opportunities to stop a gunman led to the first shooting of a US president or former president in more than a generation. Here are several issues and problems identified by CNN that could or should have been addressed before the attack on former President Donald Trump. In addition, CNN Chief Law Enforcement and Intelligence Analyst John Miller provided his analysis of some of the issues and their importance. Unsecured rooftop in range of the stage and with clear line of sight The building used by the gunman was outside the \u201chard perimeter\u201d set by the United States Secret Service inside which every person is screened. But less than 500 feet from the stage, the building was within shooting range and had a clear line of sight to where the former president stood to address the crowd. \u201cThis is a key factor in protective planning: What structures have a line of sight to the protectee, especially if that also includes high ground, a window, or a rooftop,\u201d Miller explained. \u201cThis building encompassed all those elements,\u00a0and it was within a very viable range for a rifle shot.\u201d Shooter was apparently seen acting suspiciously early by security cordon\n                   The shooter was spotted by local law enforcement who thought he might have been acting suspiciously near the magnetometers on Saturday, according to a senior law enforcement official. They put it out over their radio to keep an eye on him \u2013 and that information was passed to Secret Service as well, according to the source. When the shooter left the area of the magnetometers, he apparently wasn\u2019t seen again until people alerted law enforcement in a field outside the event that he was on the rooftop. About an hour before the incident, a person wearing clothing resembling the gunman\u2019s was also captured on video in front of the building whose roof the shooter later climbed, according to footage obtained by CNN affiliate WTAE. Pennsylvania State Police told WTAE they are looking into the video as a part of the investigation. CNN has reached out\u00a0to the state police for more information. A source told CNN that about 19 minutes before the shooting, law enforcement was trying to locate the shooter, but they could not find him until he was on the roof. Building access not controlled No one stopped the shooter from reaching the roof of the American Glass Research building. Potential confusion about law enforcement presence Snipers from the Butler County Emergency Services Unit were in the same complex but were not aware of the gunman on the roof, a source familiar with the ongoing investigation told CNN. They were positioned on the second floor, watching the rally crowd, the source said. Miller raised questions about the Secret Service\u2019s approach to securing that building: \u201cIn the initial planning to secure this event,\u00a0if that building was identified as a \u2018high-ground threat\u2019 for a potential sniper attack, did the Secret Service set specific requirements for the police about access control around that building, or did they just instruct them to\u00a0\u2018keep an eye out for anything suspicious?\u2019 \u201cThose are going to be key questions in these after-action reviews,\u201d he added. Agencies initially blamed each other The Secret Service was \u201csolely responsible\u201d for implementation of security at the rally, Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle told CNN\u2019s Whitney Wild. \u201cAt that particular site, we divided up areas of responsibility, but the Secret Service is totally responsible for the design and implementation and the execution of the site,\u201d she told CNN Tuesday evening. But Cheatle earlier told ABC News her agents only \u201cshared support\u201d for the building used for the shooting. \u201cWe sought assistance from our local counterparts for the outer perimeter,\u201d she said. \u201cThere was local police in that building \u2013 there was local police in the area that were responsible for the outer perimeter of the building.\u201d Cheatle said in the same interview that protection for Trump was the responsibility of the Secret Service and \u201cthe buck stops with me.\u201d Miller explained: \u201cAs part of the \u2018outer perimeter,\u2019 that building was the responsibility of local law enforcement, but that distinction only goes so far, and the Secret Service concedes that when the director says, \u2018The buck stops here.\u2019\u201d Crowd flagged gunman on roof almost 2 minutes before shooting Attendees in the crowd noticed the gunman on the roof nearly two minutes before the shots were fired, according to a CNN analysis of witness video and the official video feed of Trump\u2019s speech. As Trump questioned if Biden \u201cwas doing the job,\u201d someone on the video said, \u201cLook they\u2019re all pointing.\u201d One minute and 57 seconds later, gunfire can be heard. \u201cMy wife ran up to law enforcement and was trying to tell them where he was,\u201d Mike DiFrischia, a witness who took video of the shooting, told CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett. \u201cBut they couldn\u2019t seem to see him because they weren\u2019t in the right spot to see him on the roof. They were too close to the building.\u201d Local officer unable to tackle gunman before he fired at stage Butler Township police officers were alerted to calls about a suspicious person near the rally on Saturday, the head of another law enforcement agency told CNN. They discovered the man on the roof and one local officer hoisted another to get up to the ledge, Butler County Sheriff Michael T. Slupe said. The shooter turned around, saw the officer peering over and pointed his gun at him. The officer let go of the ledge to \u201ctake cover\u201d and save his life. The gunman then started firing from the rooftop.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/16/us/trump-rally-security-errors-list/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/20/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_07_19_us_houston-surrogacy-escrow-company-fraud-scheme-lawsuit", "text": "Arielle Mitton\u2019s world turned upside down when she learned the $50,000 she borrowed to pay for surrogacy had disappeared from her escrow account. \u201cThat was the hardest day for me,\u201d she told CNN in a video chat. \u201cI couldn\u2019t eat. I couldn\u2019t sleep.\u201d Her surrogate was 12 weeks pregnant, and in a cloud of emotional confusion, she remembers reporting the alleged fraud to at least 10 federal and state law enforcement agencies and calling her bank asking for loan forgiveness. But she says the answer was the same. No one could help her. \u201cI just felt alone. I felt abandoned,\u201d she said. The lawsuit claims Surrogacy Escrow Account Management LLC, or SEAM, and its owner, Dominique Side, systemically misappropriated millions of escrow dollars, allegedly using the funds to enrich herself and fund side businesses \u2013 including a clothing line and a career as a rap and R&B singer and producer. Mitton is one of nearly two dozen families listed\u00a0in a lawsuit accusing the owner of a Houston-based surrogacy escrow company of stealing millions of dollars from their accounts, intended to pay their surrogates and cover medical expenses, to fund her lavish lifestyle. The escrow funds also paid for Side\u2019s \u201clavish trips all over the world,\u201d designer clothing, luxury vehicles, real estate, and membership at the \u201cSoho House,\u201d a chain of private clubs, the filing alleges. The lawsuit was initially filed by one family last month, but 22 additional families across the country \u2013 as well as prospective parents in France and Italy \u2013 asked to join the lawsuit, the plaintiffs\u2019 attorney announced Tuesday, claiming there are \u201chundreds more families\u201d victimized by SEAM\u2019s conduct. The lawsuit alleges Side and the other defendants \u201chave lured families and their surrogates into entering into a fiduciary relationship with SEAM so they could steal their escrow funds\u201d for their benefit. SEAM provides surrogacy escrow account management services to couples and women who have agreed to act as their surrogates. The company has an obligation as the intended parents\u2019 escrow agent to hold escrow funds, review the expenses incurred by their surrogates and distribute payments to the surrogate, the lawsuit states. During a court hearing on Wednesday, a judge issued a temporary injunction, ordering funds and assets of the defendants be frozen for the duration of the lawsuit. A trial in the case has been scheduled to begin in January 2025, according to the judge\u2019s order. Last month, the FBI\u00a0said in a news release\u00a0it was \u201cseeking to identify potential victims\u201d of SEAM and asked any other\u00a0potential victims to fill out an online form. The lawsuit, filed in June in the district court of Harris County in Texas, names Side as a defendant, along with one of her business partners, Anthony Hall and Life Escrow, LLC,\u00a0an escrow company created by Hall. The judge\u2019s order says in March, Hall formed a new escrow company called Life Escrow, LLC, which is located at the same business address as SEAM. Dominique and SEAM \u201cmay have transferred any escrow funds remaining in SEAM\u2019s accounts\u201d as of June 14 to bank accounts in the name of Life Escrow, according to the judge\u2019s order. CNN has reached out to Hall for comment on the lawsuit and\u00a0did not receive a response.\u00a0But in a statement posted on his Facebook page, Hall said he defended himself from the accusations in court and has agreed \u201cto turn over specific assets I control that can be traced to the alleged mismanagement by Ms. Side. \u201cI also presented a sworn affidavit from Ms. Side that states I have no insight or access to any of the funds or, processes of SEAM. Also, it states that no monies have been transferred to me fraudulently,\u201d Hall said. Hall added Life Escrow was a passion project he started in 2023, \u201chas no financial accounts, or clients,\u201d and was \u201cnot a front for illegal activity.\u201d In an automatic reply to an email sent by CNN, Side said she and her company \u201chave been notified that we are subject to an active investigation by federal authorities.\u201d \u201cUnder advice of counsel, I am not permitted to respond to any inquiries regarding the investigation,\u201d her reply continued. In a statement on behalf of the families, attorney Marianne Robak said: \u201cThis is an important step for our legal team as we fight to help those affected by this scheme receive the recovery and answers they deserve.\u201d \u201cWe will continue to investigate where the money went and the best course of action to hold the defendants accountable for their deceitful actions,\u201d the statement continued. Defendants\u2019 actions \u2018nothing short of evil,\u2019 lawsuit says The lawsuit describes the defendants\u2019 actions as \u201cnothing short of evil,\u201d and says more than 800 families who belong to a private Facebook group for victims of the alleged scheme have been defrauded by SEAM and its owner for over $16 million. Mindy and Aaron Herstein, who are not part of the lawsuit but who are members of the\u00a0Facebook\u00a0group, told CNN they are down $50,000 after using SEAM\u2019s escrow services to pay a surrogate who is now 24 weeks pregnant.\u00a0They say after a devastating stillbirth and health problems, they chose surrogacy as it was still their dream to have a child. \u201cWe are heartbroken and\u00a0devastated\u00a0about losing the money that was supposed to be safely managed in a trusted escrow account for our surrogate, as that is how she was paid. Now we are down 50K, and I do not see this money ever being returned. I feel for everyone going through this at this time,\u201d Mindy told CNN. The families each\u00a0deposited between $31,000 and $100,000 into a SEAM escrow account, only some of which was used to pay surrogates, the lawsuit said. \u201cTroubles with SEAM came to light in June when expectant parents who had each deposited tens of thousands of dollars to pay women carrying their children learned instead that their money was apparently lost,\u201d the plaintiffs\u2019 attorney said in a Tuesday news release. \u201cInitially, it looked as though millions had vanished.\u201d The families were notified by SEAM on June 4 their accounts had been put \u201con hold\u201d by Capital One Bank due to \u201cfraudulent charges,\u201d the judge\u2019s order states. Ten days later, Side informed all the company\u2019s clients in an email: \u201cDue to legal action all operations have been placed on hold. At this time, I am unable to provide further details regarding the matter,\u201d according to the order. Arielle Mitton says she and her husband Andrew have three children and after struggling for three years with infertility, found a road to surrogacy to complete her family. They connected with their surrogate in November 2023 and established their escrow account with SEAM in March by depositing $50,000. One month later, the embryo was successfully transferred to the surrogate and the pregnancy was confirmed in May. \u201cI was elated. I was so happy,\u201d Arielle told CNN. But her joy would soon turn to deep worry when the monthly payments from SEAM stopped in June. Since then, Arielle says she started picking up extra shifts at work, is in talks with her surrogate about an alternative payment plan, and has set up a\u00a0GoFundMe\u00a0page. But the page has only raised about $5,000 of her $38,000 goal. SEAM owner used funds to launch music career, clothing line, suit says The judge cited evidence showing SEAM\u2019s escrow accounts do not have enough funds to pay the families\u2019 escrow fees, and the 23 families incurred damages ranging from roughly $12,400 to $90,400 \u2013 totaling over $1 million, not including attorney fees. \u201cThe evidence shows that it is likely \u2013 and probable \u2013 that SEAM misappropriated millions of its clients\u2019 escrow funds,\u201d the judge wrote. The judge determined the intended parents have a probable right to recovering their claims because it appears likely the defendants transferred SEAM\u2019s assets \u201cin order to hinder, delay or defraud SEAM\u2019s creditors.\u201d The families\u2019 forensic accountant reviewed bank records showing SEAM transferred the escrow funds into an operating account, most of which was then transferred to other bank accounts, the order says. Bank records show Side transferred more than $2.2 million to launch her career as \u201cDom,\u201d a \u201cracy rap and R&B singer and music producer,\u201d according to the filing. She allegedly used some of the funds to create music videos and social media content. The records also show SEAM transferred nearly $5 million to pay for a credit card, which \u201cappears to be related\u201d to a music studio owned by Side and Hall, along with $275,000 to Side\u2019s clothing line. In October 2023, a designer clothing company named Nikki Green, LLC \u2013 partially owned by Side and Hall \u2013 showcased its clothing line at Fashion Week in Las Vegas, which was funded with the parents\u2019 escrow funds, the lawsuit says. The lawsuit alleges the defendants committed fraud by failing to disclose the whereabouts and the status of their client\u2019s funds, as part of a larger scheme to defraud the families of their escrow funds. Arielle says her heart aches for all the families in the Facebook group for victims, especially one family who had two failed embryo transfers and now may never have a baby. \u201cEvery story is terrible, but that one just really got to my heart. You know, I feel lucky that my surrogate is pregnant,\u201d Arielle said. She wants to take a break from it all, she says, but can\u2019t stop thinking about the owner of the company who allegedly stole her money. \u201cIf she\u2019s out there listening, I would just ask her, \u2018how do you sleep at night doing this to people who have already gone through so much pain in their lives?\u2019\u201d Arielle said. But Arielle said what Side can\u2019t take away is her \u201cjoy,\u201d which is of being the mother to a new baby girl who will one day call her mom.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/19/us/houston-surrogacy-escrow-company-fraud-scheme-lawsuit/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/20/2024", "section": "us"}}

{"id": "2024_07_18_us_illinois-deputy-charged-911-caller-killed", "text": "An Illinois woman was fatally shot\u00a0inside her home\u00a0this month by a sheriff\u2019s deputy who responded to\u00a0her\u00a0911 call, and the deputy is now charged with murder in the case, a prosecutor said this week. Sonya Massey, 36, called 911 on July 6 because she thought an intruder was in her home in the Springfield area, according to the law office of Ben Crump, the civil rights attorney representing her family. Sangamon County sheriff\u2019s Deputy Sean Grayson and another deputy responded to the call around 12:50 a.m., authorities said. Eventually, as the deputies were in Massey\u2019s home to gather information and make sure the residence was safe, a dispute arose over a pot of hot water, and Grayson drew his gun and eventually fired three times toward her, striking her once in the face, according to a court document filed Thursday by Sangamon County prosecutors. During the dispute before the shooting, Massey at one point apologized with her hands up, and Grayson at another point also yelled at her to put the pot down, prosecutors said in the document. The sheriff\u2019s office said the deputies, who were not injured, reported the shooting around 1:20 a.m. Crump\u2019s office has said Massey was unarmed. An Illinois State Police investigation of the case did \u201cnot support a finding that \u2026 Grayson was justified in his use of deadly force,\u201d the state\u2019s attorney for the county, John Milhiser, said in a Wednesday news release. A Sangamon County grand jury on Wednesday indicted Grayson on three counts of first-degree murder and a count each of aggravated battery with a firearm and official misconduct, Milhiser said. At his arraignment Thursday, Grayson entered a not guilty plea and was denied pretrial release, according to CNN affiliate WICS. A pretrial hearing is scheduled for August 26, WICS reported. CNN sought comment Thursday from Grayson\u2019s attorney and Milhiser\u2019s office. The sheriff\u2019s department has fired Grayson, the office\u00a0said\u00a0Wednesday. Crump said in a release last week that it was \u201cextremely hard to imagine how a woman who calls police out of fear of an intruder ends up shot \u2026 by the police in her own home.\u201d On Wednesday, Crump said the charges marked \u201can important milestone in the pursuit of justice for Sonya Massey\u2019s family.\u201d \u201cThis news is a step toward justice for Sonya\u2019s loved ones, especially her children, who have endured unimaginable pain and suffering since they were notified of this tragedy. We remain committed to uncovering the truth of what happened and identifying the failures that allowed this tragic death to occur,\u201d Crump said in a Wednesday release. Massey\u2019s funeral will be held Friday morning, according to Crump\u2019s office. How the shooting unfolded, according to prosecutors Massey called 911 to report a possible \u201cprowler,\u201d according to the document that prosecutors filed in a court in Springfield on Thursday. When the two responding deputies encountered Massey, she \u201cappeared to be calm, perhaps unwell, not aggressive,\u201d the court document said. After entering Massey\u2019s home, Grayson \u201cnoticed a pot on the stove,\u00a0and approved of Massey removing the pot to prevent any accidental fires.\u201d The pot \u201capparently contained heated water,\u201d the court document says. What happened next is unclear. Massey set the pot down on a counter in the kitchen, according to the document. Grayson, who was in the living room, then\u00a0\u201cdrew his 9mm firearm and threatened to shoot Ms. Massey in the face,\u201d\u00a0according to the document. \u201cSeeing the drawn weapon, Ms. Massey put her hands in the air and stated, \u2018I\u2019m sorry,\u2019 while ducking for cover behind the counter that separated her and the defendant,\u201d the document says. \u201cWith his firearm still drawn, Grayson went closer to Massey and aggressively yelled at her to put the pot down.\u201d Then, Grayson shot Massey in the face, according to the court document. It wasn\u2019t until after Grayson fatally shot Massey that he activated his body camera, the document says. The other deputy, who was checking the house while the dispute over the pot happened, had activated his body camera when he first arrived on scene, according to the court document. Grayson instructed the other deputy not to retrieve a medical kit \u201cbecause of the severity of the injury,\u201d according to the court document. The other deputy still rendered aid and stayed with Massey until medics arrived. Grayson \u201cat no time attempted to render aid,\u201d the document said. Massey was taken to a hospital, where she was pronounced dead, the sheriff\u2019s department has said. The court document does not explain how prosecutors got details of the incident, but it asks the court to refer to the deputies\u2019 body camera recordings, which prosecutors submitted as an exhibit. The document also does not explain where the other deputy was within the house when the dispute and the shooting happened. Body camera footage to be publicly released next week Massey\u2019s family saw body camera footage of the incident during a meeting with prosecutors and state police on Wednesday, Milhiser said that day. After consulting with the family, officials decided the footage will be released publicly on Monday morning, the prosecutor said. Nothing has been redacted \u201cexcept for the blurring of certain images\u201d out of respect, Milhiser said. Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker expressed gratitude Wednesday to prosecutors for bringing the \u201cappropriate charges\u201d in this case. \u201cSonya Massey was concerned for her safety and called law enforcement to her home for protection. Like all Illinoisans, she deserved that protection. Instead, innocent and unarmed, she was gunned down by an officer of the law,\u201d Pritzker said Wednesday in a news release. \u201cMy heart breaks for Sonya\u2019s children, for her family and friends and for all who knew and loved her, and I am enraged that another innocent Black woman had her life taken from her at the hands of a police officer,\u201d the governor said. The sheriff\u2019s office said Wednesday that Grayson\u2019s actions \u201cdo not reflect the values and training of the Sangamon County Sheriff\u2019s Office or law enforcement as a whole,\u201d and that it was \u201cclear that the deputy did not act as trained or in accordance with our standards.\u201d \u201cGood law enforcement officers stand with our community in condemning actions that undermine the trust and safety we strive to uphold. In times like these, it is crucial for leadership across all sides and spectrums to come together to heal our community,\u201d the office said in an online post.

{"id": "2024_07_18_us_ruben-gutierrez-stay-of-execution", "text": "The US Supreme Court granted a stay of execution for a Texas man 20 minutes before he was to receive a lethal injection Tuesday evening. The inmate has long maintained DNA testing would help prove he wasn\u2019t responsible for the fatal stabbing of an 85-year-old woman during a home robbery decades ago. The nation\u2019s high court issued the indefinite stay shortly before inmate Ruben Gutierrez was to have been taken to the death chamber of a Huntsville prison. Gutierrez\u00a0was condemned for the 1998 killing of Escolastica Harrison at her home in Brownsville in Texas\u2019 southern tip. Prosecutors said the killing of the mobile home park manager and retired teacher was part of an attempt to steal more than $600,000 she had hidden in her home because of her mistrust of banks. Gutierrez has sought DNA testing that he claims would help prove he had no role in her death. His attorneys have said there\u2019s no physical or forensic evidence connecting him to the killing. Two others also were charged in the case. The high court\u2019s brief order, released about 5:40 p.m. CDT, said its stay of execution would remain in effect until the justices decide whether they should review his appeal request. If the court denies the request, the execution reprieve would automatically be lifted. Gutierrez, who had been set to die after 6 p.m. CDT, was in a holding cell near the death chamber when prison warden Kelly Strong advised him of the court\u2019s intervention. \u201cHe was visibly emotional,\u201d prison spokeswoman Amanda Hernandez said, adding he was not expecting the court stay. \u201cWe asked him if he wanted to make a statement but he needed a minute.\u201d \u201cHe turned around to the back of the cell, covered his mouth. He was tearing up, speechless. He was shocked.\u201d She said Gutierrez then prayed with a prison chaplain and added: \u201cGod is great!\u201d Gutierrez has had several previous execution dates in recent years that have been delayed, including\u00a0over issues\u00a0related to\u00a0having a spiritual adviser in the death chamber. In June 2020, Gutierrez was\u00a0about an hour away\u00a0from execution when he got a stay from the Supreme Court. In the most recent appeal, Gutierrez\u2019s attorneys had asked the Supreme Court to intervene, arguing Texas has denied his right under state law to post-conviction DNA testing that would show he would not have been eligible for the death penalty. His attorneys argued that various items recovered from the crime scene \u2014 including nail scrapings from Harrison, a loose hair wrapped around one of her fingers and various blood samples from within her home \u2014 have never been tested. \u201cGutierrez faces not only the denial of (DNA testing) that he has repeatedly and consistently sought for over a decade, but moreover, execution for a crime he did not commit. No one has any interest in a wrongful execution,\u201d Gutierrez\u2019s attorneys wrote in their petition to the Supreme Court. Shawn Nolan, an attorney for Gutierrez, expressed pleasure with the court\u2019s decision late Tuesday. \u201cWe are hopeful that now the Court has stepped in to stop this execution, we can ultimately accomplish the DNA testing to prove that Mr. Gutierrez should not be executed now or in the future,\u201d Nolan said in an emailed statement. Prosecutors have said the request for DNA testing is a delay tactic and that Gutierrez was convicted on various pieces of evidence, including a confession in which he admitted to planning the robbery and that he was inside her home when she was killed. Gutierrez was convicted under Texas\u2019 law of parties, which says a person can be held liable for the actions of others if they assist or encourage the commission of a crime. In their response to Gutierrez\u2019s Supreme Court petition, the Texas Attorney General\u2019s Office and the Cameron County District Attorney\u2019s Office had said state law does not provide \u201cfor postconviction DNA testing to show innocence of the death penalty and, even if it did, Gutierrez would not be entitled to it.\u201d Lower courts have previously denied Gutierrez\u2019s requests for DNA testing. Authorities said Gutierrez befriended Harrison so he could rob her. Prosecutors said Harrison hid her money underneath a false floor in her bedroom closet. Two of Harrison\u2019s nephews and three of their friends were to have witnessed the execution. They declined to comment on the court\u2019s reprieve.

Law\u00a0enforcement officers were patrolling outside the convention Monday morning and spotted\u00a0Donnell Tinsley\u00a0\u201cwearing black pants, a long sleeve tan sweatshirt, black gloves, a ski mask, and carrying a large black tactical backpack,\u201d\u00a0according to a criminal complaint released Wednesday by the Milwaukee County district attorney\u2019s office. The arrest took place the day former President Donald Trump first appeared at the RNC with a bandaged ear after surviving an assassination attempt at a campaign rally over the weekend \u2013 which prompted a heightened security presence around the convention. The officers saw\u00a0Tinsley \u201cwalking away from an RNC security checkpoint\u201d with a backpack \u201changing low,\u201d suggesting the contents inside were heavy,\u00a0the complaint said. Two special agents \u2013 one from Homeland Security Investigations and another from the United States Capitol Police \u2013 pulled up to Tinsley and started a conversation, according to the complaint.\u00a0When asked if he had a firearm, Tinsley replied \u201cno\u201d and informed the special agent he could search him. While searching the backpack, one of the agents \u201cimmediately observed a concealed AK-47 pistol,\u201d according to the complaint.\u00a0The agent asked if Tinsley had a concealed carry permit, and Tinsley acknowledged he didn\u2019t. Tinsley was then taken into custody, the complaint stated. Milwaukee police said the suspect did not hold a concealed weapon permit in Wisconsin or any other state. Additional items were also discovered inside the backpack including \u201ca fully loaded magazine, containing 7.62X39 caliber rifle ammunition,\u201d the complaint stated. \u201cA flashlight, two sets of black gloves with rubber fingertips, a pair of sunglasses, an Allied Universal Security uniform shirt \u2026 and multiple empty designer marijuana bags\u201d were also found in the backpack, according to the complaint, and agents found two cellphones after a secondary pat down of Tinsley. Tinsley is now facing one misdemeanor charge and could face up to nine months in prison with an additional $10,000 fine, the complaint said. CNN has reached out to a lawyer for Tinsley as indicated on court records. According to Wisconsin Circuit Court records, Tinsley was called for a competency examination Wednesday morning by video. The doctor\u2019s report is to be returned to the court August 6. Allied Universal Security, the company whose uniform was in Tinsley\u2019s possession, told CNN he was not working for them at the time of the incident but is a former employee. \u201cAs with all Allied Universal security professionals, as a condition of employment, he passed an industry-leading, pre-hire background screening process before being assigned to an unarmed position,\u201d spokesperson Kari Garcia said. \u201cHis alleged behavior is wholly inconsistent with Allied Universal values and is not representative of our dedicated employees who work to keep communities safe.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/17/us/milwaukee-rnc-ak-47-arrest/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/20/2024", "section": "us"}}

Take a look back at the beloved Starbucks era when baristas would handwrite customers\u2019 names on their drink orders as smooth jazz music played in the background. Here\u2019s what else you need to know to\u00a0Get Up to Speed and On with Your Day. 1. Republican convention Former President Donald Trump accepted his third GOP nomination for president at the Republican National Convention on Thursday night. His lengthy acceptance speech was his first public address since an attempt to assassinate him at a rally in Pennsylvania last week. Trump called for unity and outlined key campaign promises on the economy and the border, but repeated numerous false election claims. Elsewhere, as President Joe Biden remains in Delaware after testing positive for Covid-19, he is growing increasingly isolated from many parts of the Democratic Party. Many senior-ranking White House and campaign officials now privately believe that he must abandon his campaign for a second term \u2014 and soon. 2. Cyber outages Flights around the world were grounded today after a global computer outage hit airlines and businesses. Major US carriers including Delta, United and American Airlines have been impacted, resulting in widespread delays and cancellations. The outage appears to stem at least partly from a software update issued by cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike, experts tell CNN. The firm said the issue that caused airlines to ground flights was \u201cnot a security incident or cyberattack\u201d and a fix has been deployed. Banks and telecom companies in Australia and New Zealand have also been affected, while Israel\u2019s hospitals and health services are facing a computer \u201cmalfunction,\u201d authorities said. 3. Ukraine aid Germany plans to halve its military aid to Ukraine next year, despite concerns that US support for Kyiv could diminish if Republican candidate Donald Trump returns to the White House. This comes as Germany\u2019s military stocks, already run down by decades of underinvestment, have been further depleted by arms supplies to Kyiv. Germany hopes Ukraine will be able to meet the bulk of its military needs with the $50 billion in loans from the proceeds of frozen Russian assets approved by the Group of Seven, and that funds earmarked for armaments will not be fully used. At the same time, many people in Europe are looking at Trump\u2019s VP pick, Sen. JD Vance, with anxiety. Vance opposes military aid for Ukraine and warned that Europe will have to rely less on the US to defend the continent should the GOP regain control of the White House. 4. Olympics security Final preparations are underway for the 2024 Paris Olympics set to kick off in one week. French officials are ramping up security measures in the capital as the Olympic Village begins to welcome the first athletes into their housing facilities. On Thursday, however, a police officer was attacked and injured in central Paris, sparking alarm ahead of millions of tourist arrivals. The attack occurred in the eighth arrondissement known for iconic sites including the Champs Elys\u00e9es. This is the second violent incident against French security agents this week after a soldier was stabbed on Monday in a Paris train station. French officials said they will continue to strengthen security ahead of the Games, which are expected to draw around 15 million visitors, according to the European Union. 5. Climate protests Five activists of the Just Stop Oil environmental campaign were sentenced to years in prison for blocking a major London highway in 2022. The climate justice group, which demands the UK government forge an international, legally binding treaty to end the extraction and burning of oil and coal by 2030, has staged high-profile protests in recent years \u2014 including spray painting cultural heritage sites, targeting pieces of artwork and disrupting major sporting events. The latest sentences have drawn criticism from environmental agencies and scientists, with the Just Stop Oil group describing the decision as \u201can obscene perversion of justice.\u201d BREAKFAST BROWSE A dangerous hobby: Couple enjoys illegally scaling the world\u2019s tallest buildings togetherA Netflix documentary shows a pair of rooftoppers climbing impossible heights while navigating their own romantic ups and downs.

The\u00a0call between the\u00a0two leaders, who have had\u00a0a\u00a0complicated relationship, marks\u00a0their first conversation since Trump left the White House\u00a0and comes the day after he formally accepted the Republican Party\u2019s nomination for president. It\u00a0also comes\u00a0amid\u00a0concerns in Europe\u00a0about what Trump\u2019s policy toward\u00a0the\u00a0Russia-Ukraine war would be if he were to win the presidential election in November. \u201cPresident Zelenskyy of Ukraine and I had a very good phone call earlier today. He congratulated me on a very successful Republican National Convention and becoming the Republican nominee for President of the United States,\u201d\u00a0Trump said in a post on Truth Social.\u00a0\u201cHe condemned the heinous assassination attempt last Saturday and remarked about the American people coming together in the spirit of Unity during these times.\u201d Trump continued, \u201cI appreciate President Zelenskyy for reaching out because I, as your next President of the United States, will bring peace to the world and end the war that has cost so many lives and devastated countless innocent families. Both sides will be able to come together and negotiate a deal that ends the violence and paves a path forward to prosperity.\u201d In a post on X describing the call, Zelensky said he congratulated Trump on his nomination and condemned the \u201cshocking assassination attempt in Pennsylvania.\u201d \u201cI wished him strength and absolute safety in the future,\u201d he said. \u201cI noted the vital bipartisan and bicameral American support for protecting our nation\u2019s freedom and independence.\u201d Zelensky concluded, \u201cWe agreed with President Trump to discuss at a personal meeting what steps can make peace fair and truly lasting.\u201d Since Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Trump has repeatedly said he could settle the Ukraine war in a day, but it remains unclear how he would pursue peace. In\u00a0last month\u2019s CNN\u00a0presidential\u00a0debate, Trump said that Putin\u2019s terms for an agreement \u2013 which would include Ukraine ceding the four territories currently occupied by Russia \u2013 are \u201cnot acceptable.\u201d But the former president and his allies have also criticized\u00a0sending\u00a0US military aid to Kyiv. But the former president and his allies have also criticized US military aid to Kyiv. Trump has long been\u00a0critical of NATO defense spending. In February, the former president said he would encourage Russia to do \u201cwhatever the hell they want\u201d to any NATO member country that doesn\u2019t meet spending guidelines on defense, alarming many leaders in Washington and\u00a0Europe. Trump and Zelensky also have their own history. Nearly five years ago,\u00a0Trump repeatedly pushed for Zelensky to investigate his political rival Joe Biden and his son, Hunter,\u00a0on a call\u00a0ahead of the 2020 election. That \u201cperfect phone call,\u201d in Trump\u2019s words, led to\u00a0his\u00a0first impeachment. European diplomats have been preparing\u00a0for Trump\u2019s potential return to the White House, CNN previously reported, working to set up guard rails for NATO and trying to ensure lasting support for Ukraine in its war with Russia. Last week, when Zelensky was in the US, he said that\u00a0\u201ceveryone is waiting for November,\u201d including Putin.\u00a0He also said that Biden and Trump are \u201cvery different\u201d but both support democracy, which is why he claimed: \u201cI think Putin will hate both of them.\u201d This story has been updated with additional reporting.

{"id": "2024_07_17_us_navy-exonerates-black-sailors-port-explosion", "text": "The US Navy has exonerated 256 Black sailors who were found to be unjustly punished in 1944 following a horrific port explosion that killed hundreds of service members and exposed racist double standards among the then-segregated ranks. On July 17, 1944, munitions being loaded onto a cargo ship detonated, causing secondary blasts that ignited 5,000 tons of explosives at Port Chicago naval weapons station near San Francisco. The explosion killed 320 sailors and civilians, nearly 75% of whom were Black, and injured another 400 personnel. Surviving Black sailors had to pick up the human remains and clear the blast site while White officers were granted leave to recuperate. The pier was a critical ammunition supply site for forces in the Pacific during World War II, and the job of loading those ships was left primarily to Black enlisted sailors overseen by White officers. Before the explosion, the Black sailors working the dock had expressed concerns about the loading operations. Shortly after the blast, they were ordered to return to loading ships even though no changes had been made to improve their safety. The sailors refused, saying they needed training on how to more safely handle the bombs before they returned. What followed affected the rest of their lives, including punishments that kept them from receiving honorable discharges even as the vast majority returned to work at the pier under immense pressure and served throughout the war. Fifty sailors who held fast to their demands for safety and training were tried as a group on charges of conspiracy to commit mutiny and were convicted and sent to prison. The whole episode was unjust, and none of the sailors received the legal due process they were owed, Navy Secretary Carlos Del Toro said in an interview with The Associated Press. It was \u201ca horrific situation for those Black sailors that remained,\u201d Del Toro said. The Navy\u2019s office of general counsel reviewed the military judicial proceedings used to punish the sailors and found \u201cthere were so many inconsistencies and so many legal violations that came to the forefront,\u201d he said. Thurgood Marshall, who was then a defense attorney for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, defended the 50 sailors who were convicted of mutiny. Marshall went on to become the first Black justice on the Supreme Court. On Wednesday, the 80th anniversary of the Port Chicago disaster, Del Toro signed paperwork officially clearing the sailors, who are now deceased. Del Toro handed the first pen to Thurgood Marshall Jr., the late justice\u2019s son. The exonerations \u201care deeply moving,\u201d Marshall Jr. said. \u201cThey, of course, are all gone, and that\u2019s a painful aspect of it. But so many fought for so long for that kind of fairness and recognition.\u201d President Joe Biden said the decision to exonerate is \u201crighting a historic wrong.\u201d In the appeal of their courts martial convictions, then-NAACP attorney Marshall wrote that \u201cjustice can only be done in this case by a complete reversal of findings,\u201d Biden said in a statement. \u201cWith this action, we are answering that call.\u201d The events have stung surviving family members for decades, but an earlier effort in the 1990s to pardon the sailors fell short. Two additional sailors were previously cleared \u2013 one was found mentally incompetent to stand trial, and one was cleared on insufficient evidence. Wednesday\u2019s action goes beyond a pardon and vacates the military judicial proceedings carried out in 1944 against all of the men. \u201cThis decision clears their names and restores their honor and acknowledges the courage that they displayed in the face of immense danger,\u201d Del Toro said. The racism\u00a0that the Black sailors faced reflected the military\u2019s views at the time \u2013 ranks were segregated, and the Navy had only reluctantly opened some positions it considered less desirable to Black service members. The official court of inquiry looking into why the explosion occurred cleared all the White officers and praised them for the \u201cgreat effort\u201d they had to exert to run the dock. It left open the suggestion that the Black sailors were to blame for the accident. Del Toro\u2019s action converts the discharges to honorable unless there other circumstances surrounded them. After the Navy upgrades the discharges, surviving family members can work with the Department of Veterans Affairs on past benefits that may be owed, the Navy said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/17/us/navy-exonerates-black-sailors-port-explosion/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/20/2024", "section": "us"}}

Alex Chronis, then 76 years old, sustained third-degree burns on his body at the Econo Lodge\u00a0in Erlanger, Kentucky, which ultimately resulted in his \u201cuntimely and wrongful death,\u201d on June 19, 2022. according to the complaint filed by Chronis\u2019 niece. On November 19, 2021, Chronis attempted to take a shower but was \u201calmost immediately bombarded with scalding hot water which knocked him to the floor of the shower tub where the water continued to scald him,\u201d\u00a0the complaint\u00a0states. Two associates of Chronis rushed to\u00a0his aid after\u00a0hearing\u00a0his\u00a0fall and screams, according to the complaint. The shower delivered water at an \u201cextremely excessive temperature,\u201d the complaint stated. The temperature was more than 150 degrees, according to Chronis\u2019 family attorney, N. Jeffrey Blankenship. Most adults will suffer third-degree burns if exposed to 150-degree water for two seconds, according to the\u00a0Consumer Product Safety Commission. Chronis, a food vendor visiting the Cincinnati region for work,\u00a0initially\u00a0used nonprescription medicine for his burns\u00a0before working at a\u00a0local festival, according to Blankenship. He\u00a0went to a nearby hospital but\u00a0left to return to work, Blankenship added. Two days later, Chronis returned\u00a0to the hospital for skin graft surgery and remained hospitalized for nearly five months, according to the complaint. In April 2022, Chronis was\u00a0transferred to a rehabilitation facility in his hometown of Knoxville, Tennessee, Blankenship said. He\u00a0spent months in the hospital after the incident, underwent numerous medical procedures, and endured \u201csubstantial conscious pain and suffering\u201d before\u00a0ultimately dying from his injuries on June 19, 2022, according to the complaint. The jury found the motel owner, Sanjay Patel, \u201cfailed to exercise ordinary care in inspecting and maintaining their hotel rooms in a reasonably safe condition for the use of their guests,\u201d according to the trial order and judgment.

{"id": "2024_07_19_investing_election-markets-your-money", "text": "Stocks are soaring this year, but that could soon change as election chaos takes the market on a rollercoaster ride. The S&P 500 is up more than 15% since January and hasn\u2019t fallen by 2% in more than 353 trading sessions. That\u2019s the longest such streak since 2007 (right before the financial collapse). But this has been a destabilizing week for US stocks and the market trajectory could be shifting. Investors have struggled to find their footing in recent days as they contend with an assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump, rising odds that President Joe Biden will drop out of the election, attacks on Big Tech and chipmakers from both sides of the aisle and a global computer outage affecting airports, banks, hospitals and other businesses. The Dow fell 378 points, or 0.9%, on Friday as the tech outage continued to rattle investors. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite were down 0.7% and 0.8%, respectively. It\u2019s the latest session to see stocks oscillating this week, reaching new highs before swinging back down again. The S&P 500 posted a new record high on Tuesday. By Thursday, the index had logged its worst two-day decline since April \u2014 when Iran launched an attack on Israel. On Wednesday, the Nasdaq had its worst day since 2022. The selloff \u201ccame amidst intense political uncertainty,\u201d wrote Jim Reid at Deutsche Bank, \u201cas speculation continues to mount that President Biden will stand down as the Democratic nominee, perhaps before Monday according to many reports, which has the potential to completely upend the dynamics of the presidential election in November.\u201d Investors crave stability, and with about 100 days left until the election, they\u2019re worried that market mayhem has set in. So what does that mean for your money? The standard advice for investors is to invest for the long term and to avoid making any short-sighted election-inspired trades. \u201cWe do not favor making meaningful portfolio changes based on who you think might win the November election,\u201d said Scott Wren, senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo. \u201cThe economy\u2019s trend seems to be a clearer signal for an investor than trying to predict the eventual market impact of any election.\u201d Still, some argue that we\u2019re in the midst of a larger market rotation. Small-sized stocks prevail For the last two years, the stock market has been tied to the Federal Reserve\u2019s actions. Inflation and interest rates have been a guiding light for markets: A higher-than-expected inflation reading or tough speech from Fed Chair Jerome Powell have frequently thrown stocks into freefall. Meanwhile, any data that shows signs of a crack in the job market has sent stocks soaring as investors bet on impending rate cuts. Now, investors are parrying that central bankers will finally cut interest rates in September after first signaling a move last December. And they\u2019re celebrating. Liz Young Thomas, head of investment strategies at SoFi, said she also thinks that investors might be more certain about the election than before, as President Donald Trump has seen better polling in the days following an attempt on his life. One clear indication of that celebration is the return of small-cap stocks. Smaller companies typically outperform large caps in declining-interest-rate environments because it\u2019s cheaper for them to borrow money and grow. This makes them more attractive to investors looking for better returns. In just seven trading days, the Russell 2000 (a small-cap index) has moved nearly 10% over the last month. \u201cThe new information has been a combination of lower US Treasury yields, cooler inflation data, and increased risk appetite on the possibility of a more certain US election outcome,\u201d said Young Thomas. The earnings data helps to confirm that the move has fundamental support from the index, but likely wasn\u2019t the driving force.\u201d Tech selloff Part of the reckoning between large-cap and small-cap stocks has been due to the sudden tech selloff. As expectations increase that the Fed will begin cutting rates in the fall, investors are starting to move out of the Magnificent Seven tech stocks that fueled record highs this year. Tech stocks took an additional pummeling this week after Bloomberg reported Tuesday that the Biden administration is mulling plans to impose more sanctions on Chinese tech firms and to heighten semiconductor trade restrictions between the US and China. Former President Donald Trump, meanwhile, said in an interview with Bloomberg that Taiwan should pay for its own defense. \u201cThey did take about 100% of our chip business,\u201d Trump said. Shares of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing are down more than 12% over the past five days. On Friday, a massive global outage of Microsoft\u2019s Windows operating system, caused by a faulty update from cybersecurity company \u200b\u200bCrowdStrike, furthered the tech stock rout. Shares of CrowdStrike dropped more than 11% on Friday. Shares of Nvidia, Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Amazon, Apple and Alphabet all closed the week lower. The bright side Investors have been largely resilient this year and some financial bigwigs say the election won\u2019t change that. JPMorgan Chase CFO Jeremy Barnum said during an earnings call last week that even though the election cycle is making big news, it isn\u2019t \u201cfinancially material in the context of earnings.\u201d The current economic environment, he said, is \u201cno different than any other.\u201d As stocks settle after the trading day, levels might change slightly.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/19/investing/election-markets-your-money/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/20/2024", "section": "us"}}

Steven Craig Johnson, who had been convicted of sexual abuse charges, escaped from a prison work detail at the Mill Creek Correctional Facility in Salem, Oregon, on November 29, 1994, according to officials. He had been in Oregon Department of Corrections custody since June 1989. Johnson, now 70, was arrested Tuesday afternoon at an apartment complex in Macon, Georgia, by the US Marshals Service and one of its fugitive task forces, according to the service. He had been living at the apartment complex under the name of William Cox since 2011, the service said in a release. An investigation revealed that Johnson had stolen the identity of a child who died in Texas in January 1962, according to the release. Johnson obtained a copy of the child\u2019s birth certificate and was eventually able to get a Social Security number in Texas in 1995, according to officials. Johnson obtained a Georgia driver\u2019s license three years later. In 2015, the Marshals Service adopted the case at the request of the Oregon Department of Corrections, according to the release. The discovery of the stolen identity came after new investigative technology employed by the US State Department\u2019s Diplomatic Security Service developed new leads in the case this year, the Marshals Service said without elaborating about the technology. Johnson was booked into Georgia\u2019s Bibb County jail and is awaiting extradition back to Oregon, according to the Oregon Department of Corrections. It is unknown if he has an attorney.

{"id": "2024_07_19_media_evan-gershkovich-espionage-trial-verdict-intl", "text": "Evan Gershkovich, the first American journalist to be arrested on espionage charges in Russia since the Cold War, has been found guilty of spying and sentenced to 16 years in prison by a Russian court, in a case that the US government, his newspaper and supporters have denounced as a sham. The court in Yekaterinburg announced the guilty verdict and sentencing on Friday shortly after 3 p.m. local time (8 a.m. ET). The court heard closing arguments and 32-year-old Gershkovich, a Wall Street Journal reporter, delivered his closing remarks behind closed doors on Friday morning. The case\u2019s rapid conclusion comes just weeks after Gershkovich first appeared in a glass cage with his head recently shaved at the start of his trial on June 26. On that day, Gershkovich stood cross-armed, occasionally smiling and waving to the crowd of reporters. The speed of the trial has raised questions over whether the Kremlin is intending to use him as part of a prisoner swap deal with the United States, suggestions which spokesman Dmitry Peskov left without comment when asked about them on a Friday conference call ahead of the verdict announcement. In June,\u00a0Moscow\u00a0confirmed again\u00a0that contacts are ongoing regarding a potential prisoner exchange deal for Gershkovich, but Peskov\u00a0repeatedly\u00a0insisted that those conversations were to be carried out in \u201cabsolute silence\u201d to prevent complications. Gershkovich was arrested while reporting for the WSJ, during a trip to Yekaterinburg in March 2023, and later accused of spying for the CIA.\u00a0Russian authorities have never offered any public evidence to support their claims. Within two weeks of his arrest in March 2023, the US State Department designated him as wrongfully detained and called for his immediate release. In a statement following Friday\u2019s sentencing, Gershkovich\u2019s employer said: \u201cThis disgraceful, sham conviction comes after Evan has spent 478 days in prison, wrongfully detained, away from his family and friends, prevented from reporting, all for doing his job as a journalist. \u201cWe will continue to do everything possible to press for Evan\u2019s release and to support his family,\u201d the statement from Dow Jones CEO and Wall Street Journal Publisher Almar Latour and Wall Street Journal Editor in Chief Emma Tucker continued. \u201cJournalism is not a crime, and we will not rest until he\u2019s released. This must end now,\u201d it added. At the United Nations Security Council on Friday, US Ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield Ambassador also raised Gershkovich\u2019s case. \u201cLet me begin with the news coming out of Russia this morning. Evan Gershkovich was sentenced to 16 years. He has committed no crime. He is being punished because he is a journalist, and he is an American. Simple as that,\u201d she said. Journalist advocacy group, the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), joined the chorus of criticism, pointing out Russia\u2019s current record as the world\u2019s fourth-worst jailer of journalists, with at least 22 currently behind bars. \u201cJournalists are not pawns in geopolitical games. It\u2019s time to stop hostage diplomacy and free him immediately,\u201d CPJ Director Carlos Martinez de la Serna said in a statement. 15 days to appeal The verdict has yet to enter into force, and the defense can appeal the conviction within 15 days, judge Andrey Mineyev said while delivering his verdict.\u00a0The court also ordered Gershkovich to pay procedural costs of 6,708 rubles ($77), and for some of his personal items, including an iPhone and a notepad, to be destroyed. According to the judge, the time Gershkovich has already spent in detention since last March will count towards his sentence. Following his arrest, Gershkovich\u00a0was held in Moscow\u2019s notorious Lefortovo prison, spending almost every hour of the day in a small cell,\u00a0before being transferred to the city of Yekaterinburg in the Urals more than 1,100 miles east of the capital. He passed the time by writing letters to his friends and family, his parents said in an interview with the WSJ, adding that he was allowed just one hour of walking per day. Gershkovich, the US government, and the WSJ have vehemently denied the charges against him. US and Western officials have accused Russia of using Gershkovich and other jailed foreigners as bargaining chips for possible prisoner exchanges. A high-profile swap\u00a0in 2022 saw US basketball star Brittney Griner exchanged for arms dealer Viktor Bout. But Russia\u00a0refused\u00a0to release another jailed US citizen, Paul Whelan, as it was seeking a former colonel from Russia\u2019s domestic spy organization in return. Whelan told CNN on Friday that he feels \u201csympathy and empathy\u201d for Gershkovich, but expressed hope that the latest developments could open the door for a deal to secure both of their release. Whelan, who called CNN from his remote prison camp in Mordovia Friday, said he was able to watch a news broadcast about the sentencing. \u201cThe only thing I could think about was, when I was standing in court, listening to the judge read the false tale of my conviction and hearing that I would have to serve 16 years in prison. And there\u2019s surreal experience of knowing that you were 100% innocent, and that\u00a0this, this, stage show, this drama was going on around you,\u201d Whelan said. Russian President Vladimir Putin has previously suggested \u201can agreement can be reached\u201d with the United States to release Gershkovich and alluded to the case of a Russian national convicted of carrying out an assassination in Berlin in 2019, in an interview with right-wing US media personality Tucker Carlson in February. The trial of Gershkovich, the American-born son of Soviet-era emigres to the US, has highlighted the extent to which Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine has harmed relations between Moscow and Washington. In their indictment, Russian prosecutors said that \u201cunder instructions from the CIA\u201d and \u201cusing painstaking conspiratorial methods,\u201d Gershkovich \u201cwas collecting secret information\u201d about a Russian tank factory.

{"id": "2024_07_18_us_dog-days-of-summer-explained-cec", "text": "Bad news, heat haters: The dog days of summer are not, as Florence Welch once sang, over or done. The dog days of summer, the period during which the star Sirius rises alongside the sun,\u00a0run from July 3 to August 11. Ancient people believed that Sirius influenced the weather, among other phenomena, that caused particularly excruciating heat and even drove people and dogs to madness. True, it is especially hot in the summer, but that\u2019s not Sirius\u2019 fault, William Cumiford, associate professor at Chapman University and ancient history scholar. Nor is it the fault of a star that heat can make humans and canines alike volatile. But Sirius, known as the \u201cdog star\u201d to the ancient Greeks, did inspire the saying we still use today. Here\u2019s how the \u201cdog days of summer\u201d went from a feared period in ancient Greece and Rome to an innocent phrase immortalized in film and song. \u2018Dog days\u2019 started with a star It all starts with Sirius, the brightest star in the night sky and the part of the Canis Major that makes up the \u201csnout\u201d of the dog-shaped constellation. And adorably, Sirius seemed to be tailing a certain man-shaped set of stars. \u201cIt seems that the star appeared to form a celestial canine apparition \u2018following\u2019 the constellation of Orion,\u201d Cumiford said. But with astronomy in its infancy and other fields of science still unexplored, people of ancient civilizations \u201clooked to the heavens\u201d to explain the seemingly inexplicable phenomena in their lives, from illness to extreme weather and other disasters, Cumiford said. Enter Sirius. Ancient Egyptians believed that the star co-rising with the sun was related to annual Nile River flooding, Cumiford said. (The river floods annually because of heavy summer rainfall, not because Sirius and the sun cause it.) But Sirius \u2014\u00a0or Sothis, to the Egyptians \u2014\u00a0wasn\u2019t viewed as a destructive force in ancient Egypt, per the Old Farmer\u2019s Almanac. The annual flooding brought silt and fertile soil to parts of the desert, an essential and life-sustaining tradition the Egyptians counted on every year. The Greeks, meanwhile, who named Sirius, believed that Sirius and the sun shining brightly together contributed to the extreme heat of the late summer, said Cumiford. This belief made its way into one of the great Greek epic poems \u2014 Homer\u2019s \u201cIliad,\u201d which compares Achilles, the great Greek warrior of myth, and his shield to \u201cthe star they call Orion\u2019s dog \u2014 brightest of all but a fatal sign emblazoned on the heavens, it brings such killing fever down on wretched men.\u201d The Romans, too, believed in the dangerous power of \u201cthe dog star.\u201d In Virgil\u2019s \u201cAeneid,\u201d he writes, in one translation, of \u201cfiery Sirius, bringer of drought and plague to frail mortals\u201d and the way it \u201crises and saddens the sky with sinister light.\u201d Greeks and Romans also believed that Sirius influenced other weather events, including droughts and thunderstorms, along with poor health, bad luck \u2014\u00a0and dogs gone mad. The dog star and its seemingly destructive powers begat the phrase \u201cdog days of summer.\u201d In extreme heat, dogs and humans alike suffer \u2014\u00a0they\u2019re tired, overheated and in need of cool relief that may not come for months. And among humans, heat really can drive us mad: Research shows that higher temperatures are associated with anger, aggression and even acts of violence. And if we\u2019re suffering in the heat, think of how dogs feel under all that fur. But Sirius and the sun have little to do with each other or with us. Though it\u2019s the brightest star in the night sky, Sirius has no effect on Earth\u2019s weather or climate, Cumiford said. \u2018Dog days\u2019 in pop culture The phrase \u201cdog days\u201d lived on long after the fall of the Roman Empire \u2014\u00a0and after we came to understand that Sirius does not cause madness in people or dogs. And the way we\u2019ve come to understand it has changed, too: Now, it\u2019s used more generally to refer to the unbearably hot, humid, overall unpleasant days of summer. Charles Dickens used it, though, to express just how chilly and cruel his protagonist Ebenezer Scrooge could be to his underlings in \u201cA Christmas Carol\u201d: \u201cHe carried his own low temperatures always about with him; He iced his office in the dog-days, and didn\u2019t thaw it one degree at Christmas.\u201d \u201cDog Day Afternoon,\u201d the classic 1975 crime drama starring Al Pacino, takes place on an excruciatingly hot day in late August (although it\u2019s set on August 22, 11 days after the \u201cdog days of summer\u201d are thought to end), Cumiford noted. Sometimes \u201cdog days\u201d isn\u2019t used to refer to the extreme heat of summer but any difficult period of despair. Florence and the Machine\u2019s breakout single \u201cDog Days Are Over\u201d is a celebration of coming out on the other side of a slump, reaccepting happiness after an emotional drought. We\u2019re around halfway through the dog days of summer if we\u2019re going by the Old Farmer\u2019s Almanac\u2019s end date of August 11. But the heat persists all summer long \u2014\u00a0and it\u2019s just hot enough these days to make you feel like you\u2019re going a bit mad.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/18/us/dog-days-of-summer-explained-cec/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/20/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_07_19_politics_blinken-nuclear-weapon-breakout-time", "text": "US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Friday said that Iran\u2019s breakout time \u2013 the amount of time needed to produce enough weapons grade material for a nuclear weapon \u2013 \u201cis now probably one or two weeks\u201d as Tehran has continued to develop its nuclear program. The assessment marks the shortest breakout time that US officials have ever referenced and comes as Iran has taken steps in recent months to boost its production of fissile material. \u201cWhere we are now is not in a good place,\u201d the top US diplomat said at the Aspen Security Forum Friday. \u201cIran, because the nuclear agreement was thrown out, instead of being at least a year away from having the breakout capacity of producing fissile material for a nuclear weapon, is now probably one or two weeks away from doing that,\u201d he said. \u201cThey haven\u2019t produced a weapon itself, but that\u2019s something of course that we track very, very carefully,\u201d Blinken added. Blinken said the policy of the US is to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, and that the administration would prefer to stop that from happening through diplomacy. Over a year ago a top US Defense Department official said that Iran could now produce \u201cone bomb\u2019s worth of fissile material\u201d in \u201cabout 12 days.\u201d The Biden administration engaged in more than a year of indirect negotiations with Iran aimed at reviving the Iran nuclear deal, from which the US withdrew in 2018 under the Trump administration. Those efforts collapsed in late 2022, as the US accused Iran of making \u201cunreasonable\u201d demands related to a probe by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), a UN nuclear watchdog, into unexplained traces of uranium found at undisclosed Iranian sites. In the months that followed, the administration maintained that the Iran nuclear deal was \u201cnot on the agenda.\u201d Iran\u2019s new president has suggested they are open to engagement with the West. However, a senior State Department official told CNN that they no longer believe that there can be a return to the nuclear deal because Iran has engaged in too many escalatory acts in the years since talks broke down. \u201cWe\u2019re in a very different world, a lot of time has elapsed, Iran has done a lot of things that make a return to JCPOA non-viable,\u201d the official said. The State Department also said that there is no anticipation that the recent election in Iran will change the country\u2019s behavior. \u201cWe have no expectations that this election will lead to a fundamental change in Iran\u2019s direction or its policies,\u201d State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said earlier this month. \u201cAt the end of the day, it\u2019s not the president that has the ultimate say over the future of Iran\u2019s policy; it is the supreme leader, and of course we have seen the direction that he has chosen to take Iran in.\u00a0 Obviously, if the new president had the authority to make steps to curtail Iran\u2019s nuclear program, to stop funding terrorism, to stop destabilizing activities in the region, those would be steps that we would welcome. But needless to say, we don\u2019t have any expectations that that\u2019s what\u2019s likely to ensue.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/19/politics/blinken-nuclear-weapon-breakout-time/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/20/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_07_19_us_taylor-casey-bahamas-missing-chicago", "text": "It\u2019s been a month since anyone reported seeing Taylor Casey. She was last spotted near Paradise Island in the Bahamas on June 19. Still, her loved ones are making sure she is being seen \u2013 by publicly campaigning for her safe return. Chicagoan Casey is described by friends and family as someone who defies \u201cboundaries and definitions,\u201d and a person \u201ceveryone notices when she enters a room.\u201d When members of her community gathered July 11 to mark Casey\u2019s 42nd birthday, plead with Bahamian police to keep searching for her and ask federal agencies to provide assistance, the event included balloons, snacks, games and bubbles. One reason support for finding Casey has been so monumental is that she is an \u201camazing, amazing friend,\u201d said Jacqueline Boyd, Casey\u2019s close friend and \u201cchosen family\u201d member for 17 years. \u201cAnybody that has been in a room with her is really, really devastated right now, personally impacted and motivated to action,\u201d Boyd told CNN.  \u201cAnd it is fully a reflection of how Taylor shows up for us.\u201d Casey is an artist, a hairstylist, an Air Force veteran, a community worker and a woman of faith, Boyd said. She was born in south suburban Harvey, Illinois, and most recently lived in Rogers Park in Chicago. Casey had worked at the Chicago Freedom School as a program manager developing youth programs and had done some work with Howard Brown Health in HIV testing and prevention, her close friend Emily Williams told CNN. \u201cTaylor\u2019s favorite things are flowers and gardens and just peace,\u201d said her mother, Colette Seymore. \u201cTaylor is a very gentle spirit. Taylor just loves people, loves to help people, cares about people, cares about justice (and) fairness.\u201d \u201cLove is an action,\u201d Seymore said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just a word \u2026 and Taylor was good for that (and) showing you that she loved you.\u201d Seymore told CNN she and Casey have outings together to carnivals and restaurants and go on nature walks. She recounts a time she didn\u2019t know Casey had stopped by her house until Seymore got a call. \u201cShe called me and said, \u2018Mom, look outside your door.\u2019 And I looked outside my door, and it was one little flower,\u201d Seymore said. \u201cTaylor had come and planted a flower on the side of my side door.\u201d Casey was getting a yoga instructor certification at Sivananda Ashram Yoga when she went missing. She was last seen at the ashram and was reported missing when she didn\u2019t show up for morning classes on June 20. Nature, especially the beach, was Casey\u2019s \u201cplace of peace,\u201d and why her circle was so excited to see her go to the ashram, said Williams. \u201cTaylor had been looking forward to it for a long time, and it seemed really idyllic.\u201d Williams said she wishes \u201cwe could have been there to protect Taylor.\u201d Police found her phone in the water near a boating dock on June 24, but have been unable to access its contents, authorities said. Investigators in the Bahamas asked American authorities for help unlocking the phone, but they also had no luck, Police Commissioner Clayton Fernander said at a news conference. It\u2019s unclear where the Royal Bahamas Police Force investigation stands. CNN has reached out to the Bahamian police for comment and has received no response. According to Seymore and Williams, they have received minimal updates from authorities. However, they thanked the staff for US senators from Illinois for keeping in contact with them. Casey\u2019s family were told to expect an update last week from the Bahamian authorities but have not heard back, according to Williams and Seymore. A\u00a0July 14 statement\u00a0from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on behalf of the Consul General of the Bahamas notes the Royal Bahamas Police Force is cooperating with the family and conducting a full and thorough investigation, which remains open. \u201cWe want to receive these updates about the full investigation that they\u2019re doing and the thorough work that (they\u2019re) doing. We want to hear that. The fact of the matter is that we haven\u2019t heard that from them. So, I think that that\u2019s telling,\u201d Williams told CNN. \u201cThis, for us, is about finding Taylor. It\u2019s not about anything else,\u201d she continued. \u201cEverything that we have talked about (and) everything that we have shared has been with the intention of finding Taylor.\u201d A complex identity Casey is described as a \u201cfixture of Chicago\u2019s transgender community,\u201d in a\u00a0news release shared\u00a0July 10 on a social media account dedicated to finding her. \u201cTaylor\u2019s disappearance has sent shockwaves through Chicago\u2019s LGBTQ+ community,\u201d the release read. The first week or so after Casey\u2019s disappearance, Boyd said, was filled with \u201cconfusion and shock.\u201d Yet, the first order of business was to make sure there was a thorough investigation. Casey\u2019s loved ones chose to wait until widely sharing Casey\u2019s gender identity in connection with her case. Amid the devastation and initial communication with authorities, Boyd said family and friends asked themselves: \u201cHow can we talk about the person we love so much whose gender is more complex than most people can understand \u2013 and do that lovingly?\u201d They decided that during \u201cshock and grief (was) not the time,\u201d Boyd said. \u201cI can\u2019t even express to folks who are not part of the community how frequently we lose our women (and) how frequently our Black trans women are just gone, usually due to some form of violence or something really, really unfortunate happening,\u201d Boyd told CNN. \u201cYou\u2019re really hoping against hope that there\u2019s some other reason why this person\u2019s gone. So, protecting her privacy (and) protecting her ability to speak for herself about her own gender \u2013 that she never wanted on a national stage \u2013 for me, that was top priority.\u201d Boyd said Casey\u2019s gender is more to her than just that of a transgender woman, adding how others understand their own gender is \u201cdeeply personal.\u201d \u201cWhile Taylor is a Black trans woman, there are worlds within that that are not a neat compartmentalization,\u201d Boyd said, explaining that Casey\u2019s views are more \u201cgender expansive.\u201d Many close to Casey believe her gender identity has impacted the investigation. For a missing young White woman, Williams says, there is much media coverage and resources. \u201cTaylor is just as deserving (of that),\u201d she told CNN. Casey is \u2018not a person that just gives up\u2019 Apart from Casey\u2019s return, Boyd hopes the ongoing investigation will lead to getting involvement and assistance from federal authorities. That way family and friends \u201ccan know every stone has been turned over,\u201d she said. The US State Department is aware of reports of a missing US citizen in the Bahamas, a spokesperson told CNN but declined to comment on Casey\u2019s case specifically. When a US citizen is missing, the department works with local authorities and communicates with families openly, the spokesperson said. When asked for comment, the FBI referred CNN to the Royal Bahamas Police Force. For Seymore, every day gets harder. \u201cWhen somebody dies, the longer it is (and) as time goes by, it gets easier. Not really easier, but it gets easier,\u201d she said. \u201cBut this is not getting easier for me \u2026 I wake up every morning just so sad.\u201d She does have hope and believes Casey is alive, added Seymore. It also puts \u201ca smile on (her) face\u201d when she thinks of all the community work her daughter has done. \u201cI hope that people take this opportunity to have a different conversation about how we see each other and understand each other\u2019s identities,\u201d Boyd said. \u201cThat\u2019s my other hope; that Taylor is honored from a place of letting people be curious, nuanced and open to seeing people as a whole person, not just one identity.\u201d Williams takes solace in the fact that Casey is \u201cstrong\u201d mentally and physically. \u201cI believe that it\u2019s those things that are keeping her alive and that would give us the best chance of finding her and bringing her home,\u201d she said. \u201cTaylor doesn\u2019t give up. Taylor is not a person that just gives up,\u201d Seymore told CNN. Seymore also hopes to get the financial resources to hire a lawyer and a private investigator since \u201cthe people over in the Bahamas are not doing all that they can to find my child, so we need help.\u201d \u201cTaylor is somebody who we all keep looking for \u2026 this is not going to drop. Chicago is a city of workers and organizers, and we are ready to do absolutely everything we can to find her, and she deserves that. She deserves that from our country,\u201d Boyd said.

{"id": "2024_07_19_business_delta-american-airlines-flights-outage-intl-hnk", "text": "Thousands of US flights were grounded Friday as a technical disaster\u00a0plagued government agencies and\u00a0businesses worldwide\u00a0\u2013 leading to countless stranded passengers, canceled medical procedures and\u00a0disrupted 911 services. A cybersecurity company said the debacle is \u201cnot a security incident or cyberattack.\u201d But the technical fiasco has paralyzed airlines, banks, state agencies and even emergency services around the world. As of Friday evening, more than 3,000 flights into, out of or within the United States had been canceled and more than 11,000 delayed, according to FlightAware.com. Charlotte Douglas International Airport in North Carolina told passengers not to come to the airport unless they had confirmed their flights. Bewildered travelers at the world\u2019s busiest airport in Atlanta were stranded as they tried to get to urgent events. \u201cTomorrow, I have a funeral in the afternoon,\u201d said Ty Kelley, who was stuck at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport \u2013 which had the most cancellations Friday morning. \u201cAnd then on Sunday, I have my sister\u2019s 50th birthday party,\u201d Kelley said. But it\u2019s not clear when or if she\u2019ll make it to those events: \u201cIt\u2019s really chaotic. It\u2019s frustrating. And I\u2019ve never experienced anything like this.\u201d Live updates: Global tech outages hit airlines, banks and businesses The Federal Aviation Administration \u201cis closely monitoring a technical issue impacting IT systems at U.S. airlines,\u201d the agency posted on social media. \u201cSeveral airlines have requested FAA assistance with ground stops until the issue is resolved.\u201d CrowdStrike, a cybersecurity firm that has Microsoft among its clients, \u201cis actively working with customers impacted by a defect found in a single content update for Windows hosts,\u201d CEO George Kurtz posted on X. \u201cThis is not a\u00a0security\u00a0incident or\u00a0cyberattack.\u201d Kurtz promised customers \u201cfull transparency\u201d on how the outage occurred. He said CrowdStrike would take steps \u201cto prevent anything like this from happening again,\u201d according to a statement on CrowdStrike\u2019s website. \u201cWe have mobilized all of CrowdStrike to help you and your teams\u201d to recover from the outage, the CEO told customers. But that could be easier said than done: Manual restarts of individual systems take time and expertise that some customers don\u2019t have, which is why companies are slow to recover from the outage. Former McAfee CEO Dave DeWalt told CNN that a group of private sector and government agencies worked overnight to \u201cascertain the threat\u201d and find a solution to the global outage.\u00a0He said he was on the call, which included the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency and other private and government organizations. Microsoft released a statement midday explaining the situation. \u201cYesterday, CrowdStrike released an update that began impacting IT systems globally,\u201d Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella posted on X. \u201cWe are aware of this issue and are working closely with CrowdStrike and across the industry to provide customers technical guidance and support to safely bring their systems back online.\u201d What US airlines are saying \u2013 Delta Air Lines \u201cpaused its global flight schedule this morning due to a vendor technology issue that is impacting several airlines and businesses around the world,\u201d it said in a statement Friday morning. Delta later said it was resuming some flights. The airline apologized to impacted customers and said a travel waiver would be issued. \u2013 JetBlue operations \u201cremain normal and we are not experiencing any system-wide delays or cancelations,\u201d the airline said in an email to CNN. However, \u201cCustomers should monitor their flight status and build in extra time in the event that this outage has impacted specific airports due to outages at other airlines, airport operators, or government agencies.\u201d \u2013 American Airlines said it has resolved the issue affecting its operations. \u201cEarlier this morning, a technical issue with a vendor impacted multiple carriers, including American. As of 5 a.m. ET, we have been able to safely re-establish our operation,\u201d American said in a statement. \u201cWe apologize to our customers for the inconvenience.\u201d \u2013 Spirit Airlines said in a travel advisory its reservation system was impacted by the outage. The\u00a0airline asked passengers to check back for updates and apologized \u201cfor any inconvenience this may cause.\u201d \u2013 Southwest Airlines told CNN the outage hasn\u2019t impacted its operations. \u2013 Frontier Airlines and some competitors were brought to a standstill for hours after a\u00a0significant\u00a0Microsoft outage Thursday. The ground stop for those airlines has been lifted, and Frontier offered refunds to inconvenienced passengers. \u2013 United Airlines said it was resuming \u201csome flights\u201d early Friday morning. United cautioned travelers they might experience delays and issued waivers for eligible customers to change their travel plans. \u2013 Allegiant Air and Sun Country Airlines said they were having difficulties involving booking, check-in and trip-managing functions online. The FAA announced Friday morning all Allegiant flights would be grounded. \u2013 Numerous international airlines reported technical disruptions, including Virgin Australia and Qantas, along with airports across Europe and Asia-Pacific. Federal services and health care are stymied\n                  \n                   The calamity also struck hospitals and federal agencies, forcing each to scramble for solutions. \u201cMany of our Microsoft-based computer systems have been affected by the worldwide technology outage,\u201d Cincinnati Children\u2019s hospital posted on X. \u201cOur teams are working hard to minimize disruption to patient care and system operations, and we are bringing systems back up as quickly as possible.\u201d At Harris Health System in Houston, \u201celective hospital procedures are being canceled today and will be rescheduled when the information systems issues are resolved.\u201d At Mass General Brigham in Boston, \u201call previously scheduled non-urgent surgeries, procedures, and medical visits are cancelled today,\u201d the health care system told CNN in a statement. \u201cMass General Brigham remains open to provide care to patients with urgent health concerns in our clinics and emergency departments, and we continue to care for all patients currently receiving care in our hospitals.\u201d And in Canada\u2019s British Columbia, the Provincial Health Services Authority announced the health system was affected by the IT outage. \u201cWe have implemented contingency plans to ensure that our health care services remain operational, and that patient care is not disrupted to the best of our ability,\u201d said the organization. In addition to hospitals, blood donation centers have experienced challenges due to flight cancellations and delays. One center, Blood Assurance, told CNN that a planned shipment was postponed due to flight delays and cancellations. \u201cWe are asking community members to help through donation,\u201d Blood Assurance said in an email. \u201cWe have a fantastic community of donors that always shows up when we need them.\u201d Elsewhere, New York Blood Center, a supplier of blood to approximately 200 hospitals in the Northeast, has put in place an emergency driving operation to distribute collected blood, said Andrea Cefarelli, the senior vice president of New York Blood Center Enterprises. Test tubes of blood sent to be tested before they\u2019re distributed \u201care not making it onto planes from yesterday and today, requiring for us to drive them,\u201d Cefarelli told CNN in a phone call. \u201cThere is going to be a 12-24 hour delay in getting the test results.\u201d The American Red Cross has reassured patients and donors that they are not impacted by the global IT outage as they do not use CrowdStrike software. The US Department of Justice was searching for workarounds Friday, according to an internal memo viewed by CNN. The memo said the CrowdStrike issue \u201cis significant and there is currently no estimated restoration time.\u201d And due to the Microsoft and CrowdStrike debacle, \u201clocal Social Security offices are closed to the public today,\u201d the Social Security Administration\u2019s website said. Some 911 services went down as Portland issues an emergency declaration The technical disaster affected some 911 operations in the United States; mass transit in New York and Washington, DC; banking in Australia, South Africa and the United Kingdom; Hong Kong\u2019s Disneyland; and the Israeli health service. In Oregon, Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler issued an emergency declaration. \u201cCity services that rely on Microsoft Operating Systems using Crowdstrike Endpoint Protection, including certain essential City service providers, are impacted by the problem including emergency communications,\u201d the mayor\u2019s office said, though 911 operations were not impacted. But in Alaska, many\u00a0911\u00a0and non-emergency call centers weren\u2019t working properly, Alaska State Troopers said. Hours later, the agency said 911 services had been restored. In New Hampshire, some\u00a0911\u00a0services were down across the state overnight but have since been restored, New Hampshire\u00a0911\u00a0said in a\u00a0post. Phoenix police said the technical problems impacted the department\u2019s computerized\u00a0911\u00a0dispatch center. \u201cOur\u00a0911\u00a0center remains operational. If you need to call\u00a0911, stay on the line if you are put on a brief hold,\u201d Phoenix police posted on X Friday morning. Later in the morning, the department said its \u201csystems have been restored.\u201d In New York City,\u00a0911\u00a0services are operational, the mayor\u2019s press secretary told CNN. \u201cFDNY IT and Communication teams implemented our redundancy procedures upon notification of the CrowdStrike outage,\u201d New York fire department spokesperson Jim Long told CNN Friday. CNN has reached out to the Federal Communications Commission for more information on nationwide\u00a0911\u00a0outages. \u201cWe\u2019re aware of reports of a systems outage causing disruptions in service, including 911,\u201d the FCC posted late Friday morning on X. \u201cWe\u2019re working closely with other federal agencies to provide assistance and determine the extent of these service disruptions.\u201d State agencies are hit hard, too In some states, driver services ground to a halt due to the technical problems. North Carolina\u2019s driver\u2019s license and plate services are \u201cunable to assist customers this morning due to the current global Microsoft and CrowdStrike outage,\u201d the North Carolina Department of Transportation said. The agency said services will resume \u201conce the global outage has been repaired.\u201d Georgia\u2019s Department of Driver Services said operations were unavailable \u201cDue to the Microsoft/CrowdStrike Global outage.\u201d And in Tennessee, driver services centers might not be able to process transactions, state officials said Friday morning. Residents in Texas were not able to get IDs or driver\u2019s licenses on Friday. \u201cThe Department of Safety and Homeland Security will provide updates as information becomes available,\u201d the agency said. \u201cWe apologize for the inconvenience the outage has caused.\u201d In New York City, arrival information for trains and buses went down for hours before being restored Friday afternoon, according to the MTA. Some airports are \u2018absolutely insane\u2019 The situation at Philadelphia International Airport is \u201cabsolutely insane\u201d as thousands of people cram together, waiting for answers, traveler William Sikora III said. \u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s getting really hot in here,\u201d Sikora told CNN on Friday morning. He was trying to make the cross-country journey from Philadelphia to Los Angeles, but feared repeated delays would eventually turn into cancellations. His sentiments were echoed by would-be passengers in Atlanta, where airport officials told CNN they expected 300,000 passengers to pass through the world\u2019s busiest airport. \u201cNobody was really giving us answers. They just said our system\u2019s down, our system\u2019s down,\u201d New Jersey resident Jennifer Small told CNN. She slept at the airport overnight and has had her flight canceled twice. \u201cI want to get home to my son,\u201d Small said. But she doesn\u2019t think she\u2019ll be able to go home until Saturday. Spirit Airlines customer Miya Haney was stuck in Atlanta with her toddler daughter, trying to get to Boston for a birthday party. \u201cI\u2019m just beyond frustrated,\u201d Haney said. Spirit Airlines was using a manual check-in process, with \u201ca person going up and down shouting \u2018Boston here, flight number here,\u2019\u201d Haney said. \u201cI have no idea when we are going to get called.\u201d Hotels are also feeling the impact of the outages: Marriott International says some of its hotel systems have been impacted by the ongoing outage. \u201cWe are actively working with our vendors to resolve issues that have impacted certain hotel systems,\u201d the company, which has 8,900 properties in 141 countries and territories, said in a statement Friday afternoon. \u201cWe apologize for any inconvenience that guests may experience.\u201d This is a developing story and has been updated.

{"id": "2024_07_16_us_hannah-gutierrez-reed-rust-dismissal", "text": "Attorneys for \u201cRust\u201d movie armorer Hannah Gutierrez Reed \u2013 convicted of involuntary manslaughter in the 2021 on-set fatal shooting of a cinematographer \u2013 have filed a motion for a new trial or to have her case thrown out after the related case against actor Alec Baldwin was dismissed in dramatic fashion last week. The attorneys filed the motion Tuesday in New Mexico\u2019s Santa Fe First Judicial District Court, citing \u201cegregious prosecutorial misconduct\u201d and multiple\u00a0allegations of \u201csevere and ongoing discovery violations by the state.\u201d Gutierrez Reed\u2019s attorneys ask the court to order her prison release and to remove Kari Morrissey as the case\u2019s special prosecutor \u201cfor the misconduct that has been found, and the violations committed in Ms. Gutierrez Reed\u2019s case.\u201d On Friday, the involuntary manslaughter\u00a0case against Baldwin \u2013 who authorities said held the prop gun that fired the shot that killed cinematographer Halyna Hutchins in October 2021 \u2013 was dismissed\u00a0after the judge overseeing the case ruled prosecutors did not properly turn over evidence to the defense. Legal experts had said the collapse of the actor\u2019s case could result in Gutierrez Reed being freed from the New Mexico state prison, where she\u2019s serving an 18-month sentence following her March conviction. In Tuesday\u2019s filing, Gutierrez Reed\u2019s attorneys argue that her case should be thrown out or retried in part because of the judge\u2019s determination of withheld evidence in Baldwin\u2019s case; what they assert was Morrissey lying in court about the evidence on Friday; and what they say were other instances of suppressed evidence in the armorer\u2019s case. In a statement Wednesday to CNN, Morrissey said she would respond \u201cin writing\u201d to the defense motions. \u201cI have always been the subject of personal attacks from Mr. Bowles (Gutierrez Reed\u2019s attorney) and Mr. Baldwin\u2019s legal team, so nothing new there,\u201d Morrissey said. The shooting, and defense attorneys\u2019 allegations The shooting happened October 21, 2021. Baldwin was on the set at a ranch outside Santa Fe practicing a \u201ccross draw\u201d with a prop gun \u2013 pulling it from a holster on the opposite side of his body from his draw hand \u2013 when it fired a live round, killing Hutchins and injuring director Joel Souza. As the armorer, Gutierrez Reed was responsible for firearm safety and storage. At her\u00a0trial, prosecutors argued she repeatedly violated safety protocol and acted without caution in performing her duties, ultimately leading to Hutchins\u2019 death. Gutierrez Reed\u2019s defense attorney argued she has been scapegoated for the safety failures of film set management and other crew members. The evidence that imploded Baldwin\u2019s trial came to light last week, when a crime scene technician testified that a man had delivered a box of ammunition to the Santa Fe County Sheriff\u2019s Office in March right after Gutierrez Reed\u2019s conviction. The man, Troy Teske, a retired police officer and friend of the armorer\u2019s father, told investigators he obtained the ammunition from prop supplier Seth Kenney, and believed the ammunition could be associated with the \u201cRust\u201d incident, the technician testified. However, the technician testified the items were catalogued separately from Baldwin\u2019s case and were not included in the \u201cRust\u201d case inventory or tested to see if they matched the lethal round. Baldwin\u2019s attorneys, in a filing last week asking for the case to be dismissed, claimed that this could point to \u201can external source of the live ammunition (prop supplier\u00a0Seth Kenney)\u201d on set. The Baldwin team\u2019s filing alleged prosecutors didn\u2019t disclose the evidence because it \u201cwould be favorable to Baldwin,\u201d last week\u2019s filing shows. Baldwin was unaware of the risk live ammunition had been brought to the \u201cRust\u201d set, and for prosecutors to establish a link between Baldwin and the live ammunition source, they would have to show Gutierrez Reed, the armorer, had brought the rounds to set, according to the motion filed last week. \u201cEvidence that the live rounds came from Kenney is therefore favorable to Baldwin, which is why the state buried it,\u201d last week\u2019s document states. During a chaotic, hourslong hearing Friday, investigators testified they and Morrissey determined the ammo was not relevant to the \u201cRust\u201d case and so did not turn it over to the defense. Morrissey also testified, saying investigators had determined the ammunition was not a match to those found on the \u201cRust\u201d set and had no evidentiary value. The lead investigator, however, testified the rounds looked \u201csimilar\u201d to the dummy rounds on the film\u2019s set. Judge Mary Marlowe Sommer ruled prosecutors did not properly turn over evidence to the defense. She dismissed Baldwin\u2019s case with prejudice, meaning it cannot be brought again. In Tuesday\u2019s filing, Gutierrez Reed\u2019s attorneys said prosecutors \u2013 and even Gutierrez Reed\u2019s defense team itself \u2013 was aware of the ammunition Teske had before he gave it to the sheriff\u2019s office in March. Her attorneys wrote an email to Morrissey in January saying it was \u201cimportant to compare the powder of the Teske rounds to the powder in the powder in the live rounds found on the Rust set,\u201d Tuesday\u2019s filing reads. Morrissey wrote back that she didn\u2019t plan to retrieve or test the rounds, because she found them visually dissimilar and not relevant, Gutierrez Reed\u2019s attorneys said in Tuesday\u2019s filing. But on Friday during Baldwin\u2019s trial, Morrissey claimed that Gutierrez Reed\u2019s attorneys did not want rounds that Teske had because they incriminated their client, Tuesday\u2019s filing reads. \u201cThat is an absolute falsehood. \u2026 Far from distancing (themselves) from the Teske rounds, defense counsel recognized their potential exculpatory value had the state tested them,\u201d the court filing said. Teske had turned the rounds over to the sheriff\u2019s office in March, hoping that it would test the rounds \u201cwhile Gutierrez Reed pursued her appeal,\u201d Tuesday\u2019s filing says. \u201cInstead, the state placed them in a separate case file and attempted to hide them,\u201d Gutierrez Reed\u2019s attorneys wrote in Tuesday\u2019s filing. In Tuesday\u2019s court filing, the attorneys claimed an interview with Kenney, the prop supplier, was suppressed \u2013 and that the attorneys would have used his statements in cross examination in Gutierrez Reed\u2019s trial had they known about them. In that interview, Kenney spoke about her experience and had not heard allegations that she was unsafe, among other things, the attorneys wrote. A report conducted by state firearms experts was likewise not made available to Gutierrez Reed\u2019s attorneys, and the state revealed it to Baldwin\u2019s defense team only after Gutierrez Reed was convicted, Tuesday\u2019s filing says. The report said the gun used on the \u201cRust\u201d set had \u201cunexplained toolmarks on critical surfaces of the trigger and sear,\u201d Tuesday\u2019s filing says. Gutierrez Reed\u2019s attorneys previously made that argument in a separate court filing, which Reuters reported on last month, asking that a court release her from prison. The firearms experts\u2019 finding is evidence that the gun could have accidentally fired and could have led to her not being found guilty in the case, Gutierrez Reed\u2019s attorney Jason Bowles said last month, according to Reuters. Gutierrez Reed\u2019s defense team \u201chas also become aware of another possible 900 or so pages of material\u201d related to state\u2019s witnesses that was disclosed to Baldwin\u2019s attorneys shortly before his trial, but not to Gutierrez Reed\u2019s attorneys, Tuesday\u2019s filing reads. Her lawyers were \u201cstill reviewing these at the time of the filing of this motion,\u201d the filing reads. \ufeffThe state violated Gutierrez Reed\u2019s due process rights because it failed to disclose evidence, her attorneys wrote in Tuesday\u2019s filing. \u201cThis court stated on July 12 that the integrity of the judicial system demanded that the court dismiss Mr. Baldwin\u2019s case with prejudice,\u201d the filing said. \u201cHow can it be any different with Ms. Gutierrez Reed\u2019s case, with this proven litany of serious discovery abuses?\u201d \u201cThe intentional withholding of crucial evidence \u2026 by the state has compromised the integrity of the entire judicial process,\u201d the filing continued. Gutierrez Reed\u00a0previously filed an appeal of\u00a0her conviction in May. CNN\u2019s Dalia Faheid contributed to this story.

{"id": "2024_07_19_tech_tech-outage-crowdstrike-software", "text": "When computers and tech systems around the world went down Friday, snarling airports, closing Social Security offices and limiting jail operations, many people had one question: How on earth could this happen in 2024? A software update from a single cybersecurity company, US-based CrowdStrike, was the root cause of the chaos, underlining the fragility of the global economy and its dependence on computer systems to which relatively few people give a passing thought. \u201c[M]ost people believe that when the end of the world comes, it will be AI taking over some kind of nuclear power plant and shutting down electricity,\u201d Costin Raiu, a longtime cybersecurity researcher, quipped to CNN. \u201cWhile in reality, it\u2019s more likely to be some kind of a little bit of code in a botched update, causing a cascade reaction in interdependent cloud systems.\u201d Software updates are a critical function in society to keep computers protected from hackers. But the update process itself is crucial to get right and to safeguard from tampering. An inherent \u2014 and some say misplaced \u2014 trust in that process was punctured on Friday. CrowdStrike is everywhere Numerous Fortune 500 companies use CrowdStrike\u2019s cybersecurity software to detect and block hacking threats. Computers running Microsoft Windows \u2014\u00a0one of the most popular software programs in the world \u2014 crashed because of the faulty way a code update issued by CrowdStrike is interacting with Windows. CrowdStrike, a multibillion-dollar firm, has expanded its footprint around the world in its more than decade of doing business. Many more businesses and governments are now protected from cyberthreats because of this, but the dominance of a handful of firms in the anti-virus and threat-detection marketplace creates its own risks, according to experts. \u201cWe trust cybersecurity providers widely but without diversity; we\u2019ve created fragility in our technology ecosystem,\u201d Munish Walther-Puri, the former director of cyber risk for the city of New York, told CNN. \u201c\u2018Winning\u2019 in the marketplace can aggregate risk, and then we all \u2014\u00a0consumers and companies alike \u2014 bear the costs,\u201d Walther-Puri said. CNN has requested comment from CrowdStrike. How to prevent this from happening again The wide swathe of critical infrastructure providers affected by the outage is also likely to raise fresh questions among US officials and corporate executives about whether new policy tools are needed to avoid catastrophe in the future. Anne Neuberger, a senior White House tech and cybersecurity official, spoke of the \u201crisks of consolidation\u201d in the tech supply chain when asked about the IT outage on Friday. \u201cWe need to really think about our digital resilience not just in the systems we run but in the globally connected security systems, the risks of consolidation, how we deal with that consolidation and how we ensure that if an incident does occur it can be contained and we can recover quickly,\u201d Neuberger said at the Aspen Security Forum in response to a question about the IT outage. The chaotic scenario that played out Friday did not involve a malicious actor, but government officials around the world will likely be gaming out what might have been. The infamous hack of the US government using SolarWinds software in 2020, which US officials blamed on Russia, came through a tampered software update. That hack was not nearly as disruptive but another alleged Russian hack in 2017 caused billions of dollars in damage to the global economy because malicious code spread like wildfire. The CrowdStrike episode \u201cdemonstrates the serious damage that could be inflicted by a malicious adversary if they were so minded,\u201d Tobias Feakin, a former ambassador for cybersecurity and critical technology in the Australian foreign ministry, told CNN.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/19/tech/tech-outage-crowdstrike-software/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/20/2024", "section": "us"}}
