{"id": "2024_05_17_business_boeing-whistleblower-suicide-police-investigation", "text": "Boeing whistleblower John Barnett died by suicide, according to a police report released on Friday, bringing to end an investigation of the shocking death of a longtime employee who raised concerns about the airplane manufacturer\u2019s safety and production standards \u2013 and who sued the company, claiming Boeing illegally retaliated against him. Barnett, 62, was found dead in a vehicle on March 9 from a self-inflicted gunshot wound in Charleston, South Carolina. Officers had been dispatched to conduct a welfare check on Barnett at a Holiday Inn when he failed to show up to a deposition in his case against Boeing, according to his lawyers and a police incident report. When they arrived, responding officers found Barnett dead in the driver\u2019s seat of\u00a0a truck in the parking lot. He was holding a handgun. The initial police report also said there was a note in the truck. But Barnett\u2019s lawyers said in a statement following his death that his deposition was nearing an end and he appeared to be in good spirits. \u201cWe didn\u2019t see any indication he would take his own life. No one can believe it,\u201d his lawyers, Robert Turkewitz and Brian Knowles, said in a statement on March 12. \u201cThe Charleston police need to investigate this fully and accurately and tell the public what they find out.\u201d The Charleston Police Department on Friday concluded their investigation into Barnett\u2019s death, saying the Charleston County Coroner\u2019s Office determined that Barnett had killed himself. The investigation found that Barnett was shot in the head at close range and the weapon was found in his right hand. There was also a notebook found in the front seat of the car that showed signs that \u201che was going through a period of\u00a0serious personal distress,\u201d according to a media release about the police investigation. Police shared with CNN an image of a note left in the car, which had multiple disparaging messages directed at Boeing. \u201cAs this investigation comes to a close, we should not forget it represents the loss of Mr. Barnett\u2019s life,\u201d police said, \u201cWe extend our deepest sympathies to his family during this difficult time and hope they continue to find the strength to persevere in absence.\u201d Boeing could not immediately be reached for comment. In March, the company said it was saddened by Barnett\u2019s death. \u201cOur thoughts are with his family and friends,\u201d the company said. Accusations of safety lapses Barnett, a former quality manager who had worked at Boeing for decades, told the New York Times in 2019 that he had discovered unsafe wiring clusters in Boeing\u2019s manufacturing processes that, if severed by nearby metal slivers, could have led to the catastrophic failure of an aircraft. \u201cAs a quality manager at Boeing, you\u2019re the last line of defense before a defect makes it out to the flying public,\u201d Barnett told the Times. \u201cAnd I haven\u2019t seen a plane out of Charleston yet that I\u2019d put my name on saying it\u2019s safe and airworthy.\u201d In a statement sent to the plant\u2019s employees and provided to CNN at the time, Brad Zaback, a site leader at the plant and general manager of the 787 program, said the Times\u2019 report \u201cpaints a skewed and inaccurate picture of the program and of our team (at the plant).\u201d Zaback, who said the Times declined an invitation to visit the plant, said \u201cquality is the bedrock of who we are,\u201d adding that the plant delivers \u201cthe highest quality airplanes.\u201d Since Barnett\u2019s initial public warnings about Boeing, the company has had several high-profile safety and quality lapses, including the blowout of a door plug on a 737 Max shortly after takeoff in January. That led the US Justice Department to announce this week that Boeing could face criminal prosecution for its history of safety problems.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/17/business/boeing-whistleblower-suicide-police-investigation/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "us"}}

{"id": "2024_05_18_politics_trump-nra-convention-guns", "text": "In May 2016, near the zenith of its political sway, the National Rifle Association endorsed Donald Trump for president in a symbolic but forceful show of support for a Republican whose commitment to gun owners was still largely unknown. The group then spent more than $30 million to help elect Trump that November. Trump arrived here Saturday for the NRA\u2019s annual convention having proved himself a reliable ally of Second Amendment activists over the intervening eight years. Significantly less clear, though, is how much the NRA can help Trump\u2019s bid to win the White House once again. The NRA enters the 2024 election cycle with its future uncertain and relevance in question. A series of cascading scandals related to financial misconduct have badly damaged the reputation and coffers of the nation\u2019s most prominent gun rights group, culminating in February with\u00a0a New York jury finding the organization and top executives liable in a civil corruption case. Amid the turmoil, the NRA\u2019s longtime CEO, Wayne LaPierre, stepped down. After several years of internal power struggles, the organization will attempt this weekend to install new leadership. It\u2019s a stunning fall for a group that at its peak commanded enough Republican votes in Congress to stall almost any action to restrict firearms, even amid periods of national grief over mass shootings. \u201cI haven\u2019t heard anything about the NRA since I literally can\u2019t remember when,\u201d said one veteran Republican strategist, who nevertheless\u00a0asked not to be named in order to speak freely. \u201cIt\u2019s been years, plural. I\u2019ve heard nothing. Full stop, nothing.\u201d The strategist added: \u201cI just think they\u2019re not relevant anymore.\u201d Trump, for his part, has publicly stood by the embattled organization. Political organizers affiliated with the NRA were among a recent gathering of conservative groups at Mar-a-Lago arranged by the Trump campaign to plot a grassroots strategy for the fall, a source with knowledge of the meeting told CNN. The campaign did not respond to questions about the looming NRA leadership vote, but two close allies, South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem and the former president\u2019s son Donald Trump Jr., have at various times been linked to the top job. Addressing the NRA\u2019s annual meeting Saturday, Trump said the rights of gun owners were \u201cunder siege\u201d and urged them to get active this political cycle. \u201cGun owners don\u2019t vote. What is that all about? I\u2019ve heard that. \u2026 If gun owners voted, we would swamp them at levels that nobody\u2019s ever seen before. So I think you\u2019re a rebellious bunch, but let\u2019s be rebellious and vote this time, OK?\u201d he said. Trump, who was endorsed by the NRA\u2019s political arm Saturday, boasted that as president he stood by the organization and did not bow to pressure to implement new gun restrictions. \u201cWe\u2019re under siege, but they didn\u2019t move us an inch, and we have to stand strong,\u201d he said. Trump\u2019s appearance put him in a firmly red state in front of a loyal crowd on one of the few days he\u2019s not required in Manhattan for his criminal hush money trial. It follows another campaign\u00a0stop outside the battleground map last weekend in reliably blue New Jersey. Trump will also speak at a Libertarian Party conference in Washington, DC, next weekend. However, the former president has also used his days off from court to raise money as his campaign continues an aggressive push to catch up to President Joe Biden\u2019s growing war chest. Trump has spent the majority of his time outside the courtroom hosting and attending fundraisers \u2014 including one Friday in Minnesota and three others this week. Despite the NRA\u2019s recent tumult and Trump\u2019s limited opportunities to campaign, the annual gathering of gun enthusiasts remains a critical constituency for fundraising, said Bryan Lanza, a Republican lobbyist who was part of the former president\u2019s\u00a02016 campaign. \u201cDonald Trump has funded his campaign primarily on small-dollar\u00a0donations,\u201d Lanza said. \u201cThe NRA is a small-dollar organization that has built a behemoth,\u00a0if not a political giant,\u00a0in the United States. Their convention draws in 20,000, maybe even 30,000 folks,\u00a0who are passionate about guns,\u00a0who spend money. That seems like the audience I\u2019d want to be speaking to,\u00a0even if it was in Wyoming.\u201d The NRA did not respond to a request for comment. As he seeks a second term, Trump has promised to remain an unflinching supporter of the NRA and its agenda to unravel four years of Biden\u2019s\u00a0actions\u00a0on guns. Biden\u2019s campaign has branded Trump \u201cthe greatest defender of the Second Amendment to ever occupy the White House.\u201d Trump\u2019s speech was short on specifics about what he would do to protect or expand gun rights in a second term, but he promised to \u201croll back every Biden attack on the Second Amendment.\u201d He sought to remind the friendly crowd of his administration\u2019s accomplishments while arguing that another four years of Biden\u2019s leadership would result in more firearms and gun owners being targeted. The Biden campaign and gun safety groups are eager to remind voters of Trump\u2019s alliance with the NRA and opposition to certain gun restrictions, believing it could motivate suburban parents worried about the next school shooting and minority communities that deal with daily gun violence. Trump\u2019s position on guns is expected to become a \u201chuge\u201d part of this campaign in the coming months, one Biden official familiar with the strategy told CNN. \u201cDonald Trump is winning no new voters when he boasts about doing nothing about gun violence during his presidency. Period,\u201d said Nick Suplina, a senior vice president at Everytown for Gun Safety, a group founded in the aftermath of the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. Suplina said Trump\u2019s NRA appearance \u201cshows that both the organization and the man are a bit desperate for each other. Trump needs the crowd, the NRA needs the political relevance.\u201d As with many issues, Trump\u2019s stance on gun control has shifted throughout his decades in the public spotlight. Prior to running for office, Trump supported an assault weapons ban, but he\u00a0backed away from that stance during his first presidential campaign. After a gunman opened fire at a Parkland, Florida, high school in 2018, killing 17 students and staff, Trump appeared to briefly embrace a host of measures to restrict gun sales,\u00a0only to quickly pivot again amid intense lobbying from the NRA. Trump did address one concern of gun safety activists when his administration moved unilaterally to ban bump stocks, devices that enable a rifle to fire hundreds of rounds of ammunition per minute. The Supreme Court earlier this year heard oral arguments in a case seeking to overturn the Trump-era regulation. \u201cIf President Trump regrets that decision, that\u2019s something he should come out and say because gun owners are not going to forget that,\u201d said Aidan Johnston, a lobbyist for the Gun Owners of America, an organization that has at times criticized the NRA for not being vigilant enough in pushing for fewer gun restrictions. Trump\u2019s relative inaction stood at the heart of the stark divisions that emerged between Biden and Trump over firearms during their 2020 race. Among both gun safety advocates and gun rights groups, there\u2019s little disagreement about the stakes in 2024. Johnston called Biden \u201cperhaps the most anti-gun president in American history.\u201d Suplina said the current commander in chief was \u201cthe strongest gun-sense president in history.\u201d Biden as president has championed new restrictions on firearms, including bipartisan passage in 2022 of the most comprehensive gun safety legislation in three decades \u2013 a sweeping bill to strengthen background checks. Biden has\u00a0also created the White House Office\u00a0of Gun Violence Prevention and has issued a range of modest executive measures aimed at reducing gun violence. Among them are new regulations on the makers of \u201cghost gun\u201d kits, which allow people to build untraceable guns at home, requiring the same compliance with federal laws imposed on commercially sold firearms. If reelected, Biden has said he would continue to pursue a long-sought ban on the AR-15, the firearm linked to many of America\u2019s deadliest mass shootings. Trump in February vowed to undo any steps taken by Biden to regulate guns \u201cmy very first week back in office, perhaps my first day.\u201d A top priority is halting a proposed rule from the Biden administration to bar hunters from using lead ammunition on certain federal lands. \u201cFirearm owners, gun manufacturers, and our beautiful 2A community know President Trump is the only one who has and will proudly stand for their Second Amendment rights guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution \u2013 which shall not be infringed,\u201d Trump campaign spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said in a statement to CNN.

{"id": "2024_05_08_us_johnny-cash-daisy-bates-us-capitol-statues", "text": "The US Capitol will soon officially welcome two new, iconic figures. A statue of Daisy Bates, a civil rights journalist and activist who is perhaps best known for her role as a mentor to the Little Rock Nine \u2013 a group of Black students who were the first to desegregate schools and break Arkansas\u2019 color barrier \u2013 is replacing one of Uriah M. Rose, an attorney and former president of the Arkansas Bar Association. Another statue \u2013 of James Paul Clarke, the state\u2019s 18th governor \u2013 is set to be replaced in September by one of country music icon Johnny Cash. The statues of Clarke and Rose have been in the US Capitol for more than a century, with Rose being installed in 1917 and Clarke in 1921. The National Statuary Hall\u2019s collection includes two statues from all 50 states.  Bates\u2019 statue was installed in the hall on May 3 and officially unveiled on Wednesday, during a ceremony organized by the office of House Speaker Mike Johnson.  The bill to replace Rose and Clarke\u2019s statues was signed in April 2019 by then-Gov. Asa Hutchinson. Soon after, Bates and Cash were chosen as their replacements, CNN reported. Many had called for taking down the previous Arkansas statue representatives, including Clarke\u2019s own great-great-grandson, Democratic state Sen. Clarke Tucker. Citing statements made by Clarke, including his 1894 proclamation that the people of the South had looked to the Democratic Party to \u201cpreserve the white standards of civilization,\u201d Tucker said the change was needed. \u201cIn the context of who represents Arkansas in Statuary Hall, the time has come to move in a new direction,\u201d he said. Rose, meanwhile, had stayed loyal to Confederate Arkansas throughout the Civil War, according to the hall\u2019s website. Cash and Bates were Arkansas natives. Cash was born in Kingsland before his family moved to Dyess in east Arkansas. After moving away for much of his professional career, Cash returned in 1968 to play the \u201cJohnny Cash Homecoming Show,\u201d and again in 1969 to play at Cummins Prison. Bates grew up in Huttig, but moved to Little Rock in 1941, where she and her husband, Lucious Christopher \u201cL.C.\u201d Bates, started the Arkansas State Press, a newspaper devoted to the fight for civil rights. During her time as president of the Arkansas chapter of the NAACP, Bates led the charge for school desegregation, emerging as a key civil rights advocate during the 1957 desegregation of Central High School. Bates died in Little Rock in 1999. \u201cRemoving these kinds of statues isn\u2019t denying history as much as it\u2019s saying, \u2018We acknowledge the true history of it. We acknowledge this was wrong,\u2019\u201d said Benjamin Victor, the sculptor of Bates\u2019 statue. Victor said he sees the replacements as the \u201cright thing to do,\u201d noting the previous statues represent a time in American history \u201cthat was very ugly and awful.\u201d It\u2019s not the first time the US Capitol has had Confederate statues removed from the Statuary Hall. In 2016, Florida state lawmakers voted to replace its statue of Confederate Gen. Edmund Kirby Smith with one of civil rights leader, Mary McLeod Bethune. The statue was officially installed in July 2022, with Bethune making history as the first Black person to have a state-commissioned statue in the Statuary Hall. Victor, an artist from Idaho, has other statues on display in the collection \u2014 including Nevada\u2019s Sarah Winnemucca, Nebraska\u2019s Chief Standing Bear and Iowa\u2019s Norman E. Borlaug. He is the only living artist to have three (now four) permanent portrait sculptures displayed in the Capitol, notes the Nebraska Commission of Indian Affairs \u2013 an organization that helped secure Chief Standing Bear\u2019s statue in 2019. Little Rock-based artist Kevin Kresse, designer of Cash\u2019s statue, has his installation and dedication tentatively scheduled for late September, said Shane Broadway, chairman of the National Statuary Hall Steering Committee. Kresse is a lifelong, self-proclaimed\u00a0\u201cArkansawyer\u201d\u00a0and Cash fan. In choosing the details of Cash\u2019s statue, Kresse included a Bible tucked in his hand and Cash\u2019s signature guitar, which he referred to as Cash\u2019s \u201cbackpack that took him all over the world.\u201d Kresse \u2013 who is 62 now but was 59 at the time of the Capitol commission \u2013 said when Cash was his age, \u201chis star was starting to dim, but he didn\u2019t know at the time that some of his most impactful work was right around the corner\u201d \u2013 much like Kresse\u2019s own career, he said. Kresse doesn\u2019t want the full significance of the moment to be forgotten, he said. \u201c(Both Daisy and Johnny are) two people who stood up for those who are overlooked, passed over and pushed off to the side,\u201d Kresse told CNN. \u201cThey both came from abject poverty and some real trauma and tragedy early in their life and I think it really (caused) both of them to never forget where they came from.\u201d The artists for both statues were selected through a national competition organized by the committee and the Arkansas Capitol Arts and Grounds Commission under the endorsement of Secretary of State John Thurston who also serves as chairman of the commission, Broadway said. While the state of Arkansas handled the entire process of selecting a statue, choosing sculptors, and raising funds, \u201cThe Architect of the Capitol\u2019s Curator oversees the process from Congress\u2019 perspective and coordinates heavily with the states,\u201d Grace White, communications director for the US Committee on House Administration, told CNN in a statement. As a finalist, Victor traveled to Little Rock where he explained his vision to the selection committee while presenting a model of the statue. Victor didn\u2019t know who Bates was prior to entering the competition but felt compelled to help share her story after learning of her \u201cfearlessness.\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s this sort of unsung hero in US history that I love to celebrate,\u201d Victor told CNN. \u201cThis type of hero that everyone should know but relatively few people do know of. And we\u2019re changing that with each of these statues.\u201d Throughout her 1987 memoir \u201cThe Long Shadow of Little Rock,\u201d Bates likens her life to that of a red rose, which Victor incorporated on the statue\u2019s lapel, he said. Above the rose sits a NAACP pin. Victor believes the new statue\u2019s imprint in history will be monumental. \u201cIn that room in Statuary Hall, you got the spot where (Daisy) replaced Uriah Rose (and) it\u2019s right next to (Confederate President) Jefferson Davis. It\u2019s going to be a really powerful setting for Daisy to be included in because Jefferson Davis\u2019s statue is sort of scowling. It looks kind of negative. \u201cAnd Daisy Bates is smiling and striding forward right next to him,\u201d Victor said. \u201cI think it\u2019s this powerful juxtaposition and I hope Mississippi changes their statue (of Davis) soon. But for now, it\u2019s everything we could do to bring somebody like this into the Capitol, change out that corner, and change out that area.\u201d Staring across from Bates, as Victor describes, are statues of Bethune and Rosa Parks. \u201cYou\u2019ve got (figures like) Daisy Bates, Rosa Parks, and Chief Standing Bear (there) because they helped people instead of trying to hurt people,\u201d Victor said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to describe that feeling when (Bates) was installed in the room and the entire change of the room because of it.\u201d CNN\u2019s Katie Bernard, Alex Rogers, Rikki Klaus, Devon M. Sayers, Annie Grayer and Clare Foran contributed to this report.

{"id": "2024_05_18_politics_paul-pelosi-attacker-david-depape-sentencing-reopen", "text": "A federal judge has granted a motion to reopen the sentencing in the case against David DePape, the man convicted of the 2022 attack on House Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi\u2019s husband, Paul, because he did not get a chance to speak during his sentencing\u00a0hearing Friday. The judge will reopen the sentencing portion of the case on May 28 at 9:30 a.m. In a motion filed Saturday, the court admitted to the mistake, stating that federal rules require the \u201ccourt, prior to imposing a sentence, to \u2018address the defendant personally in order to permit the defendant to speak or present any information to mitigate the sentence.\u2019 At the May 17, 2024 sentencing proceeding, no party brought to the Court\u2019s attention that it had not done so. Nonetheless,\u00a0it was the Court\u2019s responsibility to personally ask Mr. DePape if he wanted to speak. As the Court did not do so, it committed clear error.\u201d The judge\u00a0sentenced DePape on Friday to 30 years for assault and 20 years for attempted kidnapping, which would run concurrently, for the attack at the Pelosis\u2019 San Francisco home. That same day, federal prosecutors filed a motion to reopen the sentencing for \u201cthe limited purpose of addressing the defendant to permit him to\u00a0allocute, if he so chooses, prior to sentencing.\u201d DePape was not required to speak during the hearing, the motion states, but the record shows he didn\u2019t get the opportunity to do so. DePape\u2019s attorneys told prosecutors they opposed the motion. They separately filed a notice of appeal regarding the \u201cjudgment\u00a0and sentence entered in this matter.\u201d In November,\u00a0DePape\u00a0was convicted in a federal court in San Francisco on one count of assault on the immediate family member of a federal official and a second count of attempted kidnapping of a federal official. At the time, DePape\u2019s attorneys conceded that their client attacked the then-83-year-old Paul Pelosi, but argued that his motivation for the assault did not match the charges against him. Testifying in his own defense, DePape recalled that he was looking for Nancy Pelosi and that her husband was not on his list of targets. He was \u201csurprised and confused,\u201d he testified, when he found out the congresswoman was not home. \u201cI\u2019m telling him, \u2018I have other targets, but if you stop me, I\u2019ll go through you,\u2019\u201d DePape said, recounting a conversation with Paul Pelosi, adding that he then hit Pelosi \u201cin the head,\u201d because his plan was \u201cbasically ruined.\u201d Pelosi, who underwent surgery to repair a skull fracture and injuries to his hand and arm, told jurors that his recovery has been difficult. \u201cI\u2019ve made the best effort I possibly can to not revisit this,\u201d he said at the time. A state case against\u00a0DePape\u00a0that includes charges of attempted murder, burglary and assault is expected to go to trial this summer.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/18/politics/paul-pelosi-attacker-david-depape-sentencing-reopen/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "us"}}

William Lawson, a long-time civil rights advocate and founder of Wheeler Avenue Baptist Church in Houston, has died, according to an obituary posted on the church\u2019s website.\u00a0He was 95. Lawson\u00a0was known as \u201cHouston\u2019s Pastor;\u201d a\u00a0trusted voice in the community who\u00a0ushered the city through\u00a0times of crisis and change. In 1962, he\u00a0founded\u00a0the Wheeler Avenue Baptist Church where he was the pastor for more than 40 years. He later joined the\u00a0civil rights movement led by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.,\u00a0whom he considered to be a close friend, the church\u2019s obituary stated. Lawson also set up a local chapter of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), a civil rights organization that was instrumental during the civil rights movement. \u201cLawson, in particular, was known to help build bridges between the powerful and the powerless, as a champion of social justice and community service,\u201d\u00a0the\u00a0church posted. Houston Mayor John Whitmire\u00a0held\u00a0a moment of silence at\u00a0Houston City Hall on Tuesday\u00a0to honor Lawson.\u00a0He encouraged\u00a0Houstonians to \u201cstrive for a fair, safe, and equal Houston in his honor and memory.\u201d \u201cHe is one of the reasons our city is so great,\u201d Whitmire said. \u201cHe helped us during civil rights and social justice like probably no other individual in the country because Houston benefited from his leadership and character.\u201d \u201cI, like so many Houstonians, I am deeply saddened by the passing of Rev. William Lawson-a Houstonian icon and pillar of our community,\u201d Democratic Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee said in a\u00a0post\u00a0on X. In a statement to CNN,\u00a0Harris County Commissioner Rodney Ellis\u00a0called Lawson a \u201ctowering figure in our community.\u201d \u201cHe was a pioneering force in the Civil Rights movement, courageously hosting the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. at his church and supporting the brave Texas Southern University students during the sit-ins that spurred integration in our city. His commitment to justice and equality knew no bounds.\u201d Ellis\u00a0also noted that the city\u00a0recently named a park in honor of Rev. Lawson and his late wife. \u201cThe Reverend William and Audrey Lawson Park will serve as a lasting tribute to their shared commitment to uplifting every member of our community,\u201d the statement read. In 2021,\u00a0Rice University honored\u00a0the longtime pastor\u00a0by naming part of its campus \u201cThe Reverend William A. Lawson Grove.\u201d \u201cIf there\u2019s anything that I\u2019d like for my legacy to be, it is for the different cultures of humankind to get to know each other, to respect each other and, if possible, to love each other,\u201d\u00a0Lawson said at the\u00a0unveiling.

{"id": "2024_05_18_business_retirement-plan-insurance-annuities", "text": "More Americans are turning 65 this year than ever before, and that number is set to creep even higher over the next few years. It\u2019s fueling a huge rollout of new retirement products \u2014 but they\u2019re not all golden tickets. An average of 11,200 Americans will reach that traditional retirement age each day in 2024, according to a recent report by the Alliance for Lifetime Income. This surge, along with new legislation that took effect recently, has led to a growing number of financial products that promise paychecks for life, no matter how long you live. But some options are difficult to reverse and, since some plans are so new, the benefits and shortfalls have not been thoroughly researched. From pensions to 401(k) plans Although she plans to stop working in about a decade, Jennifer Messina, a 51-year-old administrative assistant in Nutley, New Jersey, said she isn\u2019t worried about retirement because her husband\u2019s job affords them a union-sponsored annuity (an insurance product that pays out income) and a pension plan. With defined benefit pensions, the burden of saving and investing for retirement falls on the employer, not on employees. These plans generally offer employees payments for life, depending on that person\u2019s salary and how long they were with the company. \u201cI\u2019m really fortunate,\u201d Messina said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t really save much of anything.\u201d However, jobs offering pension plans are harder to come by compared to previous decades. Over the past 40 years, defined contribution plans, also known as 401(k) plans, have taken their place. Americans currently hold over $7 trillion in 401(k) plans, according to data from the Investment Company Institute, a trade association. These types of retirement plans put the job of saving and investing on the employee. With 401(k) plans, it\u2019s up to retirees to ensure they don\u2019t run out of money. Many people aren\u2019t able to save adequately for retirement so that potentially leaves them heavily reliant on the Social Security benefits they accrued in their working years \u2013 and those benefits aren\u2019t huge. The average retiree\u2019s monthly check this year is $1,915, according to the Social Security Administration. And even retirees with the highest earnings during their careers are getting somewhere between $2,710 and $4,873 depending on the age they are when they retire. In addition, millions of employees don\u2019t have access to a workplace savings plan or don\u2019t participate if they do. Nearly 50% of people don\u2019t have any money saved in a retirement account, according to Federal Reserve data from 2022. \u201cIt is structurally flawed,\u201d Teresa Ghilarducci, a labor economist and professor at The New School for Social Research, said of the 401(k) system. Financial companies are jumping in to fill the void However, this year has brought some changes to employer-sponsored plans. A new law, known as Secure Act 2.0, allows companies to now offer their employees access to lifetime annuity products in their 401(k)s. Enter financial companies offering new investments that echo the promise of a traditional pension: a paycheck you can count on for life. In April, BlackRock unveiled a new fund offering called LifePath Paycheck, which is a target-date retirement fund, which invests in less risky assets the closer you get to retirement. The new twist: It comes with an option to purchase annuities recommended by BlackRock. People who are in BlackRock\u2019s target date fund and elect to purchase an annuity through their workplace plan are not subject to the typical sales commission fees usually associated with buying an annuity. But they can only be in the fund if they have a managed account within their 401(k) plan and pay a management fee based on their assets. Nationwide is also offering a new target-date fund with an annuity option for 401(k) participants called Income America 5ForLife, although it\u2019s structured differently from BlackRock\u2019s product. By being in the fund you automatically will get annuity payments in retirement and those payments will be based on 5% of your balance when you retire. The product promises to continue paying that amount, even if you outlive the account\u2019s balance. Unlike a traditional annuity, you can pull your money out of the plan without penalty if you no longer wish to receive annuity payments. \u201cThis is a whole new burgeoning segment,\u201d Eric Stevenson, Nationwide\u2019s president of retirement solutions, told CNN. \u201cThis isn\u2019t your father\u2019s annuity.\u201d What are the downsides? Both products can be used with tax-deferred 401k savings or after-tax Roth 401(k) savings. For now, they are only available to employees at companies that offer them and only if they have managed accounts within the workplace savings plan. Ghilarducci cautioned that these products won\u2019t be free. And she advised that, when possible, retirees should opt to manage their savings on their own. \u201cThen you\u2019re not subject to any fees and you\u2019re not paying somebody else\u2019s profits,\u201d she said.  But for retirees looking for a guarantee that they won\u2019t run out of money, some of these new offerings may be appealing. There may be other downsides, however: As with other annuities, the monthly paychecks you get may be smaller if you elect to pass the benefit on to your spouse after you pass away, and annuities generally don\u2019t allow payments to pass on to children without incurring an additional cost. And annuities can be confusing to navigate \u2014 and with many it is difficult to remove your money after you\u2019re locked in. There\u2019s also the issue of inflation. Annuities do not necessarily offer inflation-adjusted payments, which means the value of your guaranteed paycheck will decline over time as you get older. In other words, it\u2019s always buyer beware. A steady paycheck, even one that emulates a traditional pension, might not be a perfect solution. Though she said she\u2019s not worried about her finances after retiring, Messina, the administrative assistant in New Jersey, conceded that she and her husband will likely have to downsize, even with the benefits of a pension and annuity. \u201cEven with the amount of money we\u2019ll be getting, we can\u2019t stay here in New Jersey,\u201d she said. Their next hurdle is deciding where to settle before they retire. Messina wants to relocate to South Carolina, while her husband wants to move to North Dakota.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/18/business/retirement-plan-insurance-annuities/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_05_16_us_ucla-student-protests-counterprotesters-invs", "text": "A young man in a white plastic mask beats a pro-Palestinian protester. Another in a maroon hoodie strikes a protester with a pole. A local instigator pushes down barricades. Law enforcement stood by for hours as counterprotesters attacked the pro-Palestinian encampment at UCLA on April 30,\u00a0which erupted into\u00a0the worst violence stemming from the ongoing college protests around the country over Israel\u2019s war in Gaza. While a criminal investigation is underway into the assaults that occurred at UCLA, the identities of the most aggressive counterprotesters have gone largely unknown. A CNN review of footage, social media posts, and interviews found that some of the most dramatic attacks caught on camera that night were committed by people outside UCLA \u2013 not the university students and faculty who were eventually arrested. Many at the scene appeared dedicated to the pro-Israel cause, according to social media and their own words that night. The violent counterprotesters identified by CNN, which included an aspiring screenwriter and film producer and a local high school student \u2013 were joined by unlikely allies, several of whom are known throughout southern California for frequenting and disrupting a variety of protests and public gatherings. The young man sporting the white mask and a white hoodie in widely shared video clips is Edan On, a local 18-year-old high school senior, his mother confirmed to CNN, though she later said he denies being at UCLA. Video shows On joining the counterprotesters while waving a long white pole. At one point, he strikes a pro-Palestinian protester with the pole, and appears to continue to strike him even when he was down, as fellow counterprotesters piled on. \u201cEdan went to bully the Palestinian students in the tents at UCLA and played the song that they played to the Nukhba terrorists in prison!\u201d his mother boasted in Hebrew on Facebook, referencing Hamas. She circled an image of him that had been broadcast on the local news. \u201cHe is all over the news channels,\u201d his mother wrote in a now-deleted post. Some counterprotesters had been spotted on campus days earlier, drawn by a high-profile pro-Israel rally as inflammatory videos and claims rapidly spread across social media. Many at the scene\u00a0Tuesday hid their faces behind masks and scarves. Some attackers sprayed protesters with chemical irritants, hit them with wooden boards, punched and kicked them and shot fireworks into the crowd of students and supporters huddled behind umbrellas and wooden planks, attempting to stay safe. For hours, they sought to pull away pieces of the barrier, scooping up fallen wooden planks and poles to use as makeshift weapons, lunging toward pro-Palestinian protesters who emerged from the camp to protect it from being breached. As protesters chanted, \u201cWe\u2019re not leaving\u201d from the encampment, some counterprotesters shouted back, \u201cYou are terrorists, you are terrorists!\u201d Video footage shows that some counterprotesters instigated the fighting, while others did little to intervene. Then\u00a0police did\u00a0little as a large group of counterprotesters calmy walked away, leaving behind bloody, bruised students and other protesters. The Los Angeles Police Department and California Highway Patrol referred all questions about the incident to the UCLA Police Department, which did not respond to multiple requests for comment. Law enforcement did not track injuries from the attack. But according to the encampment\u2019s organizers, more than 150 students \u201cwere assaulted with pepper spray and bear mace,\u201d and at least 25 protesters ended up being transported to local emergency rooms to receive treatment for injuries including fractures, severe lacerations and chemical-induced injuries. \u201cI actually thought someone would get killed,\u201d said Rabbi Chaim Seidler-Feller, UCLA Hillel\u2019s Director Emeritus, who called 911 around midnight as he watched the violence on live TV. \u201cThey came to beat people up.\u201d The next day, Hillel at UCLA posted an open letter from student leaders denouncing what it called \u201cfringe members of the off-campus Jewish community\u201d who did not represent \u201cthe estimated 3,000 Jewish Bruins at UCLA.\u201d \u201cWe cannot have a clearer ask for the off-campus Jewish community: stay off our campus,\u201d it stated. \u201cYour actions are harming Jewish students.\u201d \u2018You guys are about to get f\u2014ed up\u2019 In one of the more dramatic videos of the night, a protester wearing the colors of the Palestinian flag underneath an LA Kings jersey was knocked to the ground and beaten by multiple counterprotesters as he guarded the encampment. One of those assailants was On, who rushed into the middle of the fray with his pole. When CNN showed On\u2019s mother a\u00a0video\u00a0of him attacking the protester,\u00a0she said Edan, who she confirmed is a senior at Beverly Hills High School, was only defending himself. His mother \u2013 who previously described a smaller group of UCLA students protesting the war last year as \u201chuman animals\u201d on social media \u2013 said dozens of his schoolmates had also gone to campus on the 30th and that her son intends to join the Israel Defense Forces. The school district said federal law prohibits sharing information about students, including confirming their identities. On could not be reached for comment directly. When CNN contacted On\u2019s mother for an interview with him, she replied that her son was in Israel and that he claimed he wasn\u2019t at UCLA despite her earlier confirmation. The man in the LA Kings jersey was ultimately dragged into a group of counterprotesters and kicked by an aspiring Los Angeles screenwriter\u00a0and\u00a0producer\u00a0who CNN identified as Malachi Marlan-Librett, according to a review of social media photos, footage from the protest and interviews with multiple people who knew him.\u00a0According to his LinkedIn, he graduated from UC Santa Cruz in 2019 and attended a UCLA professional film and television program the following year. A man in a maroon hoodie joined Marlan-Librett in dragging the protester into the mob. The protester was later seen in a video receiving treatment for a bloody head injury at the encampment. Marlan-Librett and the man in the maroon hoodie, along with other counterprotesters, such as an unmasked man wearing a red bandana around his neck, were seen committing multiple acts of violence throughout the night. They became prime targets for online researchers who told CNN they had created internal nicknames such as #UCLARedBandana, #UCLANeffHat and #UCLAMaroonHoodie as they attempted to identify them. In one violent episode captured on video, Marlan-Librett is seen carrying the end of a broom in his hand, using it to strike a protester in the head before kicking him. Even after the protester retreats, Marlan-Librett sneaks up on him from behind and strikes him in the head once again. Marlan-Librett didn\u2019t respond to calls and texts from CNN. In another video, the man in the maroon hoodie runs toward the encampment yelling, \u201cYou guys are about to get f**ked up.\u201d In the over 3-hour-long livestream, the young man is in the thick of the scrum and can be seen hitting another man with a pole before arming counterprotesters with wood planks. The man could\u00a0be heard yelling at protesters, \u201cF**k\u00a0you, f**king terrorists,\u201d\u00a0then, \u201cThe score is 30,000\u201d \u2013 a reference to the number of\u00a0Palestinians\u00a0killed\u00a0by Israel\u2019s bombing campaign and ground offensive\u00a0in Gaza. Just minutes earlier, the man pepper-sprayed a journalist in the face, while she was filming the crowd. \u201cI had to walk off because I literally could not see anything,\u201d the local journalist, Dolores Quintana, told CNN. \u201cAnd it was getting in my mouth. And so, I was starting to choke.\u201d She said a volunteer came out of the encampment to wash out her eyes with water and saline. Quintana took a selfie when she could open her eyes again. In the photo, her face was drenched and pale, with red blotches on her forehead. \u201cThis was the worst situation I ever found myself in as a journalist,\u201d she said. \u201cI was afraid they were going to kill somebody.\u201d Local provocateurs in the fray According to multiple acquaintances of the man in the maroon hoodie, he attended Los Angeles Valley College with his brother. Both brothers were enrolled at USC in the fall 2023 semester for a couple weeks before disenrolling, according to the school. CNN could not reach the man in the maroon hoodie, and he did not have any apparent connection to UCLA. Neither did Tom Bibiyan, a 42-year-old who was once a local Green Party official. Bibiyan was stabbed at a KKK rally where he was a counter-protester in 2016 and has since become an ardent Trump supporter. His colorful Instagram page is a mix of right-wing memes, numerous posts defending famous men against sexual assault allegations and pro-Israel content. Video footage shows Bibiyan among those at the front line of people rushing the encampment in an attempt to remove protective metal barriers, as campus security guards watched the violence unfold. \u201cThe moment we rushed the terrorist encampment last night at ucla to take it apart,\u201d he captioned a video he posted to Instagram. \u201cF**k them kids,\u201d he said in a separate post, which has since been deleted. A CNN journalist reached Bibiyan outside his home, wearing the same jacket he had worn at UCLA, but he refused to say why he had taken part in the violence. \u201cYou\u2019re being a little rude, and I\u2019m going to call the police if you don\u2019t leave,\u201d he said. Other older men spotted among the mob looked familiar to local public school mom Angie Givant as she followed what happened that Tuesday night on social media: a group of right-wing provocateurs who she\u2019d seen protesting LGBTQ rights in public schools at school board and city council meetings around Los Angeles. \u201cAs soon as there were rumors that, you know, things were going to go down at UCLA, there was a mobilization of very familiar reactionary extremists,\u201d she told CNN. One of the older men, Narek Palyan, joined the group of counterprotesters despite having posted anti-Jewish tropes on his social media accounts. Palyan, who didn\u2019t appear to engage in the violence, claimed to CNN he has a child at UCLA, though a student was not seen accompanying him that night. \u201cI was definitely keeping the peace, at least trying to,\u201d he said. Student journalists attacked UCLA junior and student journalist Catherine Hamilton said that when a firework landed a few feet away from where she was standing and she saw the men approaching in masks, it was clear to her that they were about to do something they didn\u2019t want to be recognized for. \u201cIn that moment when that firework went off and started ringing in my ears, I was like, something very bad is going to happen on this campus,\u201d she said. When the police finally arrived hours later to break up the chaos, Hamilton and her colleagues regrouped to head back to their newsroom. As they walked past a line of cops and along a well-lit street in the center of campus, just before 3:30 am, she says they were encircled by a small group of\u00a0counterprotesters\u00a0mainly dressed in black. She told CNN the man leading the group was someone whom she immediately recognized. He was a counterprotester who had previously verbally harassed her and taken a photo of her press badge,\u00a0she said. Within seconds, they sprayed the student journalists with a type of mace or pepper spray and flashed lights in their faces. As she tried to get away, Hamilton said, she was repeatedly struck in the chest and abdomen. One of the journalists\u00a0confronted the attackers and shoved one before he was pummeled to the ground and beaten, according to video footage of the incident. \u2018I was expecting us to start working on an obituary\u2019 The day after the attack, UCLA\u2019s chancellor called the events\u00a0\u201ca\u00a0dark\u00a0chapter\u201d in the school\u2019s history that \u201chas shaken our campus to its core.\u201d A\u00a0parent\u00a0who was at the encampment with\u00a0their\u00a0child, a UCLA student, also described\u00a0the night\u00a0as feeling like \u201ca civil war movie\u201d with embers raining down and the wounded being treated all around.\u00a0The parent said they were\u00a0frantic to find help, calling UCLA campus police six times in a row. One fourth-year UCLA student \u2013 who requested anonymity due to safety concerns \u2013 told CNN he was hit in the corner of his forehead with a traffic cone. Minutes later, video captured a counterprotester smashing a wooden plank into the back of his head. With two deep cuts on his head, he said he rushed to the hospital and ultimately received 14 staples and three stitches for the injuries. The violence directed at the protesters and his access to medical treatment reminded him of why they had set up the encampment in the first place,\u00a0trying to raise awareness about the mass deaths and destruction from Israel\u2019s war in Gaza, and calling for the university to divest from any financial ties with Israel.\u00a0\u201cI had the privilege of going to a hospital,\u201d he said. \u201cIn Gaza, there are zero fully functioning hospitals.\u201d Thistle Boosinger, a 23-year-old member of the encampment who is not a UCLA student, had her hand smashed the night of the violence. She described how her assailant took a piece of wood above his head before slamming it down on her hand. \u201cAt first, I just screamed,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd then after like five minutes where my adrenaline wore off, it was so extremely painful.\u201d In a video call, Boosinger held up her hand wrapped in gauze and described her injury. \u201cMy bone is broken totally in half below my knuckle \u2026 [which is] shattered into a bunch of pieces and jumbled up.\u201d Dylan Kupsh, a UCLA graduate student, said he linked arms with other protesters in an attempt to defend the encampment and keep people safe. \u201cWe were \u2026 trying to keep the barricade wall up because that was literally protecting our lives,\u201d Kupsh said. It wasn\u2019t long before he was pepper sprayed, forcing him to seek medical treatment as the attacks continued. Kupsh and others still wonder what would have happened had the encampment been breached that night. \u201cI hate to say it,\u201d said Catherine Hamilton, the student journalist, \u201cbut I was expecting us to start working on an obituary the next day because I thought something that serious would happen to the students in the encampment.\u201d Do you have information to share about the attack at UCLA?

{"id": "2024_05_16_us_angelo-quinto-death-police-antioch-settlement", "text": "A Northern California city has agreed to pay $7.5 million to the family of a 30-year-old man who died days after police restrained him in 2020, the parties announced Wednesday, settling a wrongful death claim that the family filed. Angelo Quinto\u2019s family filed the claim against the city of Antioch in February 2021, alleging he was undergoing a mental health episode and died days after police officers kneeled on the back of his neck for nearly five minutes to subdue him. A year later, the\u00a0Contra Costa County District Attorney\u2019s office said\u00a0an internal examination determined Quinto\u2019s neck area had no damage; that it saw \u201cno evidence of criminal offense by Antioch police officers\u201d in Quinto\u2019s death; and that the officers had \u201cengaged with Quinto in a manner that was lawful and objectively reasonable under the circumstances.\u201d \u201cWhile there are conflicting medical opinions as to the cause of death, the accounts of what transpired in the bedroom are consistent among all witnesses in that no police officer applied pressure to Quinto\u2019s neck,\u201d the district attorney\u2019s office said in 2022. Police restrained Quinto at the family\u2019s home in Antioch on December 23, 2020, after his sister called police because he had a mental health episode and she feared he would hurt their mother, the family\u2019s attorneys had said. Quinto lost consciousness, and was taken to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead three days later, the family attorneys said in the claim. Quinto\u2019s cause of death \u201cwas Excited Delirium Syndrome due to drug intoxication, psychiatric conditions, physical exertion, and cardiac arrest,\u201d\u00a0an autopsy\u00a0performed five days after Quinto was restrained by the officers found, the district attorney\u2019s office said in 2022. On Wednesday,\u00a0an attorney for Quinto\u2019s family, Ben Nisenbaum, said that Quinto\u2019s family was the \u201cmoving force\u201d behind\u00a0legislation\u00a0eventually signed by Gov. Gavin Newsom banning excited delirium and other similar terms to be listed as cause of death in California. He said a coroner inquest listed excited delirium \u2013 which is \u201ccharacterized by agitation, aggression, acute distress and sudden death,\u201d\u00a0according to\u00a0the National Library of Medicine \u2013 as Quinto\u2019s cause of death. John L. Burris,\u00a0another lawyer for the family, said the settlement shows something positive can come out of a tragedy. \u201cThis is a case where the family, from day one, took the tragedy and the loss and the circumstances surrounding Angelo\u2019s death and tried to turn it into a positive good, and they did so,\u201d Burris said. \u201cThe real plus that comes from this case is the collective efforts on their part, and the willingness on the part of the city officials, including the mayor\u2019s office \u2026 to bring about a positive change,\u201d Burris said. Antioch Mayor Lamar Hernandez-Thorpe said that while two people died in police custody during the first 30 days of his administration, he \u201cwas left with the impression that this wasn\u2019t a big deal.\u201d \u201c$7.5 million later \u2013 and that\u2019s never enough to make up for somebody\u2019s loved\u00a0one \u2013 we recognized that it was a bigger issue than what we understood,\u201d the mayor said at Wednesday\u2019s news conference, adding that the city council had previously fought against body-worn cameras for police officers. \u201cYears of, frankly, failed leadership brought us to this moment, but I am happy to say that we\u2019ve done an enormous job in terms of changing the culture, not just at the police department, but at the city as well, and taking these concerns serious,\u201d the mayor said. \u201cWe\u2019ve done a lot in terms of establishing reforms that I think build a safer community for every single segment of our city and to ensure that people do have justice when we are wrong.\u201d During the news conference, Quinto\u2019s stepfather, Robert Collins, thanked the mayor and the city council for listening to his family\u2019s calls for change. \u201cWe found a city that has listened to a lot of our pleas and has begun to make the necessary changes that we need to have,\u201d Collins said. \u201cIt\u2019s a process of change. We\u2019re not done here. It\u2019s a process that will take many years.\u201d Thanks to the family\u2019s claim, police body cameras \u201care now a reality in Antioch,\u201d and a non-police mental health response team \u201chas prevented other people from dying,\u201d Collins said. Quinto\u2019s sister,\u00a0Isabella Collins,\u00a0described her brother as \u201cmultifaceted.\u201d He was artistic, loved to cook and was always trying to better himself, she said. \u201cThis is some semblance of justice that we\u2019ve been able to work toward positive reforms and positive change \u2013 legislative and advocacy change,\u201d\u00a0Isabella Collins said. \u201cI think that if my brother couldn\u2019t have life, that perhaps this is what he would choose, this impact on other people\u2019s lives and other people\u2019s legacies, the ability to pave the way toward some justice and justice for others.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/16/us/angelo-quinto-death-police-antioch-settlement/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_05_18_us_helms-ategeka-college-acceptance-cec", "text": "Helms Ategeka wants to be a pop star. But when he told his dad he planned to pursue a music degree after his graduation next month from high school, his father wasn\u2019t exactly thrilled. So last fall, the Oakland, California, teenager took a different approach: He started applying to colleges. More than 150 of them. Before long, he got an acceptance letter. Then another. And another. The trickle became a flood until there were 122 of them \u2014 along with some $5.3 million in proposed grants and scholarship offers. (CNN has viewed the acceptance letters.) His father says he\u2019s proud of Helms\u2019 3.94 GPA and had hoped his son would pick a career with financial stability, like medicine or computer technology. Or maybe Helms might follow in his own footsteps as a mechanical engineering graduate from the University of California, Berkeley. But as he watched the mountain of acceptance letters in his son\u2019s room get bigger with every mail delivery, Chris Ategeka\u2019s hope dimmed. The messages on the multicolored envelopes beckoned with undeniable enthusiasm.\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re in!\u201d one said. \u201cOur family welcomes your family! read another. \u201cHe\u2019s so confident that music is what he wants to do, it would be a disservice for me to try to guide him otherwise \u2026 that\u2019s why he applied to a gazillion colleges to prove a point,\u201d Ategeka says. \u201cI told him, \u2018You want to be a musician? It takes a lot of hard work.\u2019 And his reaction was, I\u2019ll use my determination to do this to show you how hard I can work.\u201d But how does an 18-year-old begin narrowing down such a massive list of options? And so began a journey that came with tough lessons on change and compromise \u2014 for both father and son. He had a key requirement for the colleges he applied to Helms\u2019 life revolves around music. At Head-Royce High School in Oakland he\u2019s part of an a cappella group that meets every week to belt out covers of popular pop music. His room is stacked with CDs by Beyonc\u00e9, Prince and Bruno Mars. Before he starts college in the fall, he\u2019s taking a summer trip to Peru with a choir to perform in churches and communities. \u201cI live for music. I spend most of my time either listening to music, making music or out there performing,\u201d Helms says. \u201cI feel the most alive and fulfilled when I\u2019m doing something related to music.\u201d So when he started his college application journey, he had one key requirement: The school needed to have a strong music program. He mostly used universities\u2019 online portals for his applications, he says, which made it easier to copy and paste his information to multiple places. His father paid the application fee required by some universities. Helms spent many hours writing essays for different schools, although most were variations of the same personal story. In his essays, he highlighted his passion for music and his background as an immigrant. A small group of schools, including Brown, Wesleyan and Colgate, rejected him or placed him on their waiting list. But the much longer list of schools that said yes spans the country, from big state universities to smaller private colleges: Bard College, Drexel, Howard, Loyola Marymount, Sarah Lawrence College \u2014 and yes, UC Berkeley. He moved to the US just before the pandemic shut down everything Ategeka immigrated to the US from his homeland in Uganda in late 2000s to attend the University of California, Berkeley. He left Helms with his mother in the western Ugandan town of Fort Portal, where he lived until he joined his father in California five years ago. Soon after Helms came to the US in 2019, the world largely shut down due to the coronavirus pandemic. He attended his new school via Zoom and missed out on a big part of interacting with others and learning the nuances of American culture. As a result, he wasn\u2019t sure his college applications would resonate or meet a lot of the requirements, he says. \u201cI gave it my all with the application process. I reached out to the schools to make sure that they\u2019ve received my application and made sure I gave my essays my best shot. But I did not expect so many schools to say yes, so I was not prepared,\u201d Helms says. His modern drama teacher, Ricky Lapidus, is not surprised that Helms has received so many offers. \u201cHelms loves learning \u2014 he\u2019s interested in other people as much as he is in grades,\u201d says Lapidus, head of the Upper School at Head-Royce High School.\u00a0\u201cHe is a deeply empathetic person and that\u2019s how he approaches school \u2014 how do I learn more so I can understand others more? What makes him stand out for a college is a combination of his brains, sure, but also his joy and willingness to explore new things.\u201d He used his father\u2019s words against him Helms spent the past few months studying the websites and social media accounts of schools that accepted him. He\u2019s watched videos of their music programs on YouTube and TikTok to get a sense of where he fits in. And most importantly, he\u2019s had candid conversations with his father about the realities of a career in music. \u201cAs an immigrant parent, I was thinking, \u2018How are you going to pay your bills?\u2019 But he\u2019s a driven kid \u2026 and he used my words against me,\u201d Ategeka says. Through this process, Ategeka says he realized he was viewing his son\u2019s academic quest through what he describes as an \u201cAfrican immigrant mentality\u201d that prioritizes certain lucrative careers as markers of success. \u201cI always tell him that he can be whatever he wants to be and can do anything he puts his mind to. And he was like, \u2018Yeah, this is what I really want to do.\u2019\u201d Ategeka says he\u2019s slowly been embracing his son\u2019s dream to study music and become a pop singer.\u00a0He says he still worries about his future, because he knows how difficult it is to become famous enough to earn a living from your talent. But he admires Helms\u2019 determination and focus, as does his mother in Uganda. Chris Ategeka says his son proved he\u2019s serious about a music career by getting accepted to so many colleges. \u201cHe is really highlighting the idea that he\u2019s not a kid who is failing out of school or running away from home to live in the subway to make the music thing work,\u201d Ategeka says. \u201cHe\u2019s sent the message that, \u2018I know I\u2019m smart. I got the grades. I can get into college. I can do whatever I want. But this is my passion, this is my drive, this is what I chose.\u201d His college choice has a connection to his dad After months of research, Helms made his choice: He will stay nearby and study music at his dad\u2019s alma mater, UC Berkeley. A spokesperson for Berkeley confirmed that he\u2019s been accepted. \u201cI created a spreadsheet, and I wrote out the pros and the cons for each of the schools and really tried to weigh my priorities,\u201d he says. \u201cIf I would like to be close to home, what kind of program each school has or doesn\u2019t have, that kind of stuff.\u201d Watching social media videos of the schools\u2019 concerts and other musical events revealed the quality and diversity of the programs offered, which helped in making his decision, he says. Videos of musical events at Berkeley had a certain joie de vivre, he says, which helped him see himself there. The school also has a wide variety of musical programs, including African music ensembles and a brass quintet. As an immigrant, Helms is part of a growing demographic. Children born abroad or in the US to an immigrant parent accounted for 58% of the increase in the nation\u2019s college enrollment between 2000 and 2018, a study by the Migration Policy Institute shows. \u201cThe face of US higher education is changing,\u201d the study says. \u201cStudents are more likely to come from immigrant families than in the past.\u201d Helms\u2019 new chapter comes at a precarious time for US colleges and universities as Berkeley and other schools grapple with the aftermath of pro-Palestinian student protests that have led to disruptions, arrests and debates about the limits of free speech. But Ategeka says his son\u2019s journey has reminded him to be open to new possibilities and ways of thinking. He believes Helms will find appropriate ways to be a part of difficult campus conversations. \u201cCollege is not about conforming to status quo \u2026 it is ground zero for training leaders who shape the future. It is in college that the young minds rethink the old and build the new for humanity and our planet,\u201d he says. Helms is excited to follow in his father\u2019s footsteps at Berkeley, which has an admission rate of about 12%. Of the nearly 126,000 students who applied in fall of 2023, only about 15,000 were accepted. But most importantly, he says, he\u2019s looking forward to taking the next step toward being a professional musician.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/18/us/helms-ategeka-college-acceptance-cec/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_05_18_business_under-armour-kevin-plank-shoes", "text": "It was once hyped as a worthy rival to Nike. But at present, Under Armour, founded by a 23-year-old former college athlete, is struggling  to  \u201cjust do it.\u201d Instead, the brand that\u2019s championed on the basketball court by Stephen Curry and on the golf course by Jordan Spieth, is now struggling \u2014 badly \u2014 to find its footing in an increasingly competitive and crowded sportwear marketplace for regular folks, where younger shoppers are more googly-eyed over newer entrants like Hoka and On running shoes. Under Armour\u2019s annual sales have been sluggish at best for the past several years, while its stock has plunged 88% from its all-time high in 2015. Industry experts said the company is mired in an unpleasant mix of problems, which include an identity crisis, several management controversies, ignoring evolving market trends to its detriment, and a rotating carousel of CEOs in quick succession. One of them is Kevin Plank, its founder, who is back at the helm for a second time as CEO after being replaced in 2019. Similar to Starbucks founder Howard Schultz\u2019s past returns to Starbucks and Disney chief Bob Iger\u2019s recent return as CEO, Plank aims to right the ship at Under Armour. \u201cWhen Under Armour was growing at 20% plus numbers, people saw it as a legitimate competitor to Nike,\u201d said David Swartz, senior equity analyst with research firm Morningstar, in an interview with CNN. \u201cIt was like On or Hoka but 10 years ago. It was the upstart athletic brand that was making real inroads against Nike, the dominant name in the industry. People saw it as a company that actually could break through and take market share from Nike among the hardcore athletes,\u201d Swartz said. \u201cThat actually did happen for a while, but then that didn\u2019t last.\u201d Plank launched Under Armour in 1996 to be what the name suggests \u2014 a protective layer of clothing worn by competitive athletes sweating it out in the heat of the game. The first product was a fitted T-shirt called \u201cThe Shorty,\u201d made from moisture-wicking fabric for elite athletes to wear under their uniforms to keep them dry. Its iconic Under Armour intertwined \u201cU\u201d and \u201cA\u201d logo was strategically placed on the neckline, to keep it conspicuous. The T-shirt eventually launched the brand to the masses after it quickly gained fandom among the ranks of professional athletes. The startup\u2019s fast track to success led to Under Armour going public in 2005. It\u2019s early slogan: \u201cProtect This House.\u201d By 2010, the business had crossed $1 billion in sales. Five years later, sales surpassed $4 billion. But then the momentum started to wane. Protracted period of pain The past eight years for Under Armour have been a struggle that doesn\u2019t appear to be abating. The company on Thursday announced a restructuring of its business as its North America sales in its most recent quarter tumbled 10%. Looking ahead, the company cast a dour forecast for its current fiscal year, expecting sales to drop 15% to 17%. Layoffs will be part of the effort to right the ship but executives did not specify how many employees will lose their jobs. Under Armour also announced a $500 million share buyback, a move to reward shareholders. Plank told analysts during the earnings call on Thursday that he will shepherd a reset of the business that centers on selling fewer but more innovative products to meet the needs of athletes, significantly accelerating product development, refocusing on its men\u2019s apparel category and reducing discounts of its products. \u201cWe are simply doing too much stuff. There are too many products, too many initiatives. To reconstitute this brand, we must be highly focused and prioritize what needs to get done so that our teams know exactly what to do with a clear definition of success for them,\u201d Plank said. It can\u2019t be ignored that management issues, too, have plagued the business for years, Swartz said. \u201cThe company has essentially had five CEOs in the past five years, if you count Kevin Plank twice,\u201d said Swartz. Plank was announced as CEO \u2014 again \u2014 in March, ending the very brief year-long tenure of Stephanie Linnartz. Plank conceded during the analysts call Thursday that frequent C-suite turnover had become a serious impediment to success. \u201cWith several CEOs and heads of product, marketing in North America over the past half-decade, ongoing turnover of critical leadership has been central to our inability to stay agile and decisive,\u201d he said. String of controversies The period from 2016 onward is when \u201cthings really started to fall apart\u201d at Under Armour, Swartz said. A huge issue arose when an important channel of distribution for the brand went bankrupt and closed stores. A bulk of Under Armour products are sold through sporting goods retailers and department stores, including Macy\u2019s and Kohl\u2019s, and online. \u201cWhen Sports Authority went bankrupt in 2016 it really hurt Under Armour. It was a major customer of the brand, as is Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods,\u201d Schwartz said. In 2020, UCLA sued Under Armour for ending a $280 million sponsorship deal. The suit alleged that Under Armour was struggling before Covid-19 and that it used the pandemic as a reason to get out of the deal. The 15-year sponsorship deal, signed in 2016, was the\u00a0largest in the history\u00a0of college sports at the time. In exchange for the $280 million, UCLA\u2019s student athletes and personnel would wear and use Under Armour\u00a0(UA)-supplied products exclusively. The company reached a settlement with UCLA. The following year, Under Armour paid $9 million to settle a multi-year investigation with the US Securities and Exchange Commission into its past accounting practices, according to Footwear News. Outside of other bad press for Plank, competitors were gaining ground on Under Armour, whose high-performance sportwear offerings weren\u2019t best suited for the Lululemon-driven athleisure trend that had emerged and then dominated the way consumers dressed through the pandemic. \u201cUnder Armour has failed to latch upon streetwear, or sports style that catapulted On or Hoka or Merrell,\u201d said Zak Stambor, senior analyst, retail and ecommerce, with market research firm eMarketer, in an interview with CNN. \u201cIt needs to figure out what is next. If it can\u2019t do that, then it needs to quickly latch upon what another brand has identified as the next big thing.\u201d Stambor questioned Plank\u2019s decision to pull back from discounts at a time when consumers are hyper focused on value. \u201cIt carries the risk of decreasing demand particularly when you don\u2019t have a must-have product,\u201d he said. Stambor said this decision also stands in stark contrast to a recent move that rival Adidas has made to roll out cheaper versions of their must-have shoes. Despite it\u2019s significant challenges, Stambor said Under Armour can remain relevant in the market. \u201cIt is a very large company with huge revenue. It\u2019s not as though the brand has fully diminished in standing. It\u2019s a bit stuck,\u201d he said. \u201cUnder Armour needs to identify what it is that consumers want and lean heavily in that direction. It hasn\u2019t fully shown an ability to do so over the past few years,\u201d he said. One area that\u2019s going strong is the brand\u2019s long-term celebrity-brand partnerships, said Eric Smallwood, president of Apex Marketing Group, a sports and entertainment firm that evaluates sponsorships and advertising campaigns. \u201cUnder Armour\u2019s relationship with the \u2018The Rock\u2019, Dwayne Johnson, has been pretty effective. They\u2019ve expanded to the United Football League, which is the football league that Johnson co-owns,\u201d Smallwood said. \u201cTheir uniforms are Under Armour.\u201d Golf is another area where the brand is making inroads while the Stephen Curry partnership has kept the brand visible in the basketball world, Smallwood said. The basketball superstar Curry, arguably the best shooter in history, famously signed with Under Armour instead of Nike in 2013. Meanwhile, the brand\u2019s other major NBA star, Joel Embiid, quit Under Armour in 2023 a few months after he was named the league\u2019s most valuable player. Embiid signed a shoe deal with Skechers last month. Under Armour reportedly bid hard for a shoe deal with WNBA phenom Caitlin Clark, who many expect will sign with Nike. \u201cThe bottomline for Under Armour is for the brand to be clear about its identity,\u201d he said. \u201cAre they a shoe company? Are they an apparel company? At one point everyone else copied their mositure-wicking undershirt. Then maybe they had an identity crisis. It\u2019s going to come down to deciding if they want to evolve into a lifestyle brand or stay in performance-based products.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/18/business/under-armour-kevin-plank-shoes/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "us"}}

The four giant pandas housed at Zoo Atlanta, Lun Lun, Yang Yang, Ya Lun and Xi Lun will be sent to China later this year, as the zoo\u2019s agreement with China is set to expire in late 2024, the zoo announced in a\u00a0news release\u00a0Friday. \u201cZoo Atlanta has applied for the\u00a0pandas\u2019 international travel permit, and the bears are expected to travel to China sometime in the fourth quarter of 2024,\u201d the zoo said, noting the exact timing of their return has yet to be determined and \u201cwill be identified collaboratively with official partners in China.\u201d \u201cWhile Zoo Atlanta remains committed to the stewardship and long-term conservation of the species, no discussions have yet taken place with partners in China as to the future of the Zoo\u2019s giant\u00a0panda\u00a0program following the expiration of Zoo Atlanta\u2019s current agreement,\u201d the release added. Zoo Atlanta pointed out its\u00a0panda\u00a0program has been \u201cnotably successful in terms of future contributions to the population of the species,\u201d with seven giant\u00a0pandas born at the zoo since 2006, including two pairs of twins.

But more pandas are set to arrive in different parts of the United States. In April, it was announced China would send giant\u00a0pandas to live at San Francisco\u2019s zoo for the first time. And the San Diego Zoo announced in February it would receive two giant pandas from China, marking the first time the country has granted new\u00a0panda\u00a0loans in the US in two decades. Pandas have served as something of an unofficial barometer of China-US relations since 1972, when Beijing gifted a pair of the bears to the Smithsonian National Zoo, following US President Richard Nixon\u2019s historic ice-breaking trip to China. Chinese leader Xi Jinping said in 2023 the bamboo-eating bears serve as \u201cenvoys of friendship between the Chinese and American peoples.\u201d Just over 1,800 giant pandas remain in the wild, according to the World Wildlife Fund, which lists the species as vulnerable and describes them as the world\u2019s rarest bear.

We can point fingers at who\u2019s at fault, who has failed to make the ultimate contact, but in all reality, we all could have done better \u2014 from the sheriff\u2019s office to the Army to the family,\u201d said James Herling, Card\u2019s brother-in-law. Documents shared with CNN by the Sagadahoc County Sheriff\u2019s Office showed Card\u2019s family had called the department as far back as May 2023, voicing concerns over his well-being and access to firearms. The US Army previously told CNN a health and wellness check was requested by the shooter\u2019s unit \u201cout of an abundance of caution after the unit became concerned for his safety.\u201d An independent review last year concluded the sheriff\u2019s office acted \u201creasonably\u201d but recommended improvements to the department\u2019s strategy. Card, a US Army reservist and certified firearms instructor, went on two shooting rampages at a bar and bowling alley in Lewiston, killing 18 people and wounding 13 others with an assault rifle. After a 48-hour manhunt following the shootings, Card was found dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head near a river some 10 miles from Lewiston. The Concussion Legacy Foundation said in March that tissue samples from Card\u2019s brain showed evidence of traumatic brain injury and suggested he had been exposed to \u201cthousands of low-level blasts\u201d during his time at an Army hand grenade training range. \u201cI am hoping that this commission will find that the DOD needs to enhance the protection of our soldiers because when they release them as civilians, they are releasing them without proper care,\u201d Herling said. \u201cThis is not an excuse for the behavior and action that Robbie committed. It was a wrongful act of evil. My brother-in-law was not this man. His brain was hijacked.\u201d Nicole Herling, Card\u2019s sister, testified about the \u201csignificant challenge\u201d to contact Card\u2019s chain of command in the Army for help when he began showing signs of mental illness. \u201cThe Department of Defense\u2019s negligence regarding traumatic brain injury must be addressed, and they must be held accountable for change,\u201d Nicole Herling said. \u201cIt\u2019s important to acknowledge that Robbie\u2019s decline involved other factors, and I\u2019m not here to excuse his behavior,\u201d she added. \u201cIf we appeared silent, it wasn\u2019t because we lacked empathy.

Kasko,\u00a0who serves as the chair of the Academic Senate, called on colleagues to \u201ctry to find common ground\u201d in a\u00a0statement issued\u00a0following the votes. \u201cAs we all process the results of the votes by the Legislative Assembly on May 16, 2024, on the resolutions of no confidence and censure of the Chancellor, it is clear that we are not united in how we view the major events of the past weeks and the campus response to them,\u201d Kasko said. CNN has reached out to Block and UCLA for comment. As part of a movement that swept university campuses throughout the nation, pro-Palestinian protesters set up an encampment at UCLA in an effort to raise awareness about the mass deaths and destruction in Gaza, and calling for the university to divest from any financial ties with Israel. On April 30, law enforcement stood by for hours as counterprotesters attacked the pro-Palestinian encampment,\u00a0which erupted into\u00a0the worst violence stemming from the ongoing college protests around the country over Israel\u2019s war in Gaza. More than 150 students \u201cwere assaulted with pepper spray and bear mace,\u201d and at least 25 protesters ended up being transported to local emergency rooms, according to the encampment\u2019s organizers. While a criminal investigation is still underway into the assaults, a CNN review of footage, social media posts, and interviews found that some of the most dramatic attacks caught on camera that night were committed by people outside UCLA \u2013 not the university students and faculty who were eventually arrested. After the violence and as the university faced criticism, Block announced UCLA\u2019s security operations would change. He said it is clear that \u201curgent changes are needed in how we administer safety operations\u201d in order to best protect the school community. The university also said it is investigating \u201ca group\u00a0of\u00a0instigators\u201d who attacked the encampment, according to a statement from Block. \u201cHolding the instigators\u00a0of\u00a0this attack accountable and enhancing our campus safety operations are both critical. Our community members can only learn, work and thrive in an environment where they feel secure,\u201d Block said in the May 6 statement. Other universities and their leaders have faced backlash over their response to campus protests as well. This week, arts and sciences faculty at Columbia University passed a vote of no confidence in the school\u2019s president, Minouche Shafik, who has been under\u00a0intense scrutiny for her handling\u00a0of campus protests and her congressional testimony on the subject. Last week, the University of Southern California\u2019s faculty senate voted 21-7 to censure USC President Carol Folt and Provost Andrew Guzman over the removal of a protest encampment from campus and the use of Los Angeles police to arrest protesters, among other issues. Faculty and staff express disapproval Hundreds of University of California faculty and staff signed a letter addressed to Block \u201cdecrying the horrific violence perpetrated against our students on April 30, and calling on him to fully protect our students\u2019 safety and security, and to honor their first amendment rights to free speech.\u201d Days later, more than 900 University of California faculty and staff signed a letter demanding Block\u2019s resignation following the arrests at the campus. \u201cFollowing the violent and aggressive police sweep of the Palestine Solidarity Encampment on May 2, 2024, resulting in more than 200 students, faculty, and staff arrested while peacefully protesting, it has become obvious that Chancellor Block has failed our university,\u201d the letter said. The United Auto Workers 4811, which represents 48,000 University of California academic workers, has authorized a strike \u201cif circumstances justify,\u201d citing \u201cnumerous, egregious unfair labor practices committed\u201d during on-campus protests.\u00a0Specifically, the union mentioned the handling of protests on April 30 and May 1 at UCLA. \u201cAt the heart of this is our right to free speech and peaceful protest,\u201d said Rafael Jaime, a graduate worker in the English department and president of UAW 4811.\u00a0\u201cIf members of the academic community are maced and beaten down for peacefully demonstrating on this issue, our ability to speak up on all issues is threatened.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/18/us/ucla-faculty-rejects-censure-gene-block/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_05_16_us_university-of-washington-protests-antisemitic-graffiti", "text": "Pro-Palestinian encampments have been cleared from more US college campuses as school officials have called in law enforcement in recent weeks to quell mounting demonstrations\u00a0over the institutions\u2019 ties to Israel amid its\u00a0military action in Gaza. Here are the latest developments: Arts and sciences faculty at Columbia University have passed a vote of no confidence in the Ivy League school\u2019s president, Minouche Shafik, who has been under intense scrutiny for her handling of campus protests over the Israel-Hamas war and her congressional testimony on the subject. Sixty-five percent of participants said they had no confidence in Shafik, a spokesperson for the New York university confirmed to CNN on Thursday, adding some 900 of its 4,600 full-time faculty voted. Among their concerns were that Shafik\u2019s leadership had \u201cnot only endangered our students; more broadly, it represents a serious threat to the core values of the university: academic freedom, shared governance, freedom of expression, and the right to peaceful assembly,\u201d the Barnard College and Columbia University Chapters of the American Association of University Professors said in a Thursday news release. Shafik \u201ccontinues to consult regularly with members of the community, including faculty, administration, and trustees, as well as with state, city, and community leaders,\u201d Columbia spokesperson Ben Chang said in a statement. Shafik a day earlier sent a message to graduates \u2013 after their university-wide commencement ceremony was canceled following weeks of Gaza war protests \u2013 wishing \u201cthat the challenges you faced during this difficult era will inspire you and make you stronger.\u201d \u201cI know that the last few weeks have been very difficult,\u00a0and\u00a0I am sorry that we were unable to celebrate your commencement in the traditional manner,\u201d she said in her message. Columbia cited security concerns in canceling the large event, a school official told CNN, and instead is holding smaller ones. Acknowledging \u201can extraordinary and tragic set of events\u201d in the Middle East and that \u201cas a great\u00a0university, we must engage with these issues,\u201d the polarization\u00a0at Columbia has caused conflict\u00a0on\u00a0campus, Shafik said. \u201cCanceling the traditional\u00a0commencement\u00a0ceremony was\u00a0one of the toughest calls in a year of many tough calls,\u201d Shafik wrote in an op-ed in the\u00a0Columbia\u00a0Daily Spectator, noting her top priority has been the safety of students, faculty and staff. \u201cThe conflict between the rights of pro-Palestinian protesters and the impact that their protests have had\u00a0on\u00a0some members of our Jewish community is what makes this moment singularly fraught,\u201d she said. UC Irvine returns to in-person classes after nearly 50 protesters detained: The University of California, Irvine, will resume in-person instruction and campus operations will return to normal on Friday, according to a school spokesperson. Classes went remote Thursday after law enforcement personnel used zip ties to restrain demonstrators the prior evening at the university before escorting them\u00a0away from a pro-Palestinian protest encampment and toward a parking lot. University spokesperson Tom Vasich said 47 people were arrested, including 26 students, two employees and 19 other individuals. Those who were arrested were taken to the Orange County Jail, where booking and processing were completed. \u201cThey were then released on citation,\u201d Vasich said. Vasich had earlier told CNN 50 people were arrested, but revised the number to 47 later Thursday. Most of those taken into custody were cited for failure to disperse after a direct police order and a few were arrested for trespassing, Vasich said, adding a full breakdown of how many of those arrested are students or faculty is expected to be released later on Thursday. \u201cA group of several hundred protestors entered the UC Irvine campus and began surrounding\u201d the school\u2019s Physical Sciences Lecture Hall at\u00a0around 2:30 p.m., Wednesday, the school said in an emergency update. The\u00a0university\u00a0put out a mutual aid call to local law\u00a0enforcement\u00a0and got help from the\u00a0Irvine\u00a0Police Department and Orange County Sheriff\u2019s Department, it said. Authorities cleared\u00a0what looked like at least half\u00a0of student protesters at\u00a0the encampment, aerial footage from\u00a0CNN affiliate KABC\u00a0showed. Pro-Palestinian protesters had set up a campus encampment on April 29, when the university also\u00a0called in\u00a0local law enforcement. Days later, the school\u2019s chancellor said the university would continue to negotiate with student protesters demanding their university cut financial ties to Israel over the nation\u2019s military action in Gaza. UC Berkeley Pro-Palestinian protesters arrested after occupying building: Law enforcement arrested at least 12 people Thursday evening as they cleared a condemned building at the University of California, Berkeley, that was being occupied by pro-Palestinian protesters, school spokesperson Dan Mogulof told CNN. Protesters broke into the university\u2019s Anna Head complex with sticks and bolt cutters on Wednesday, where they broke windows and spray-painted walls, police said. The university on Thursday estimated about 60 people were in the building and said the occupation was \u201cnot nonviolent civil disobedience.\u201d The protesters were arrested on suspicion of destruction of property, breaking and entering and trespassing, according to Mogulof. During the occupation, a Palestinian flag hung from the building, where protesters had set up tents, footage from CNN affiliate KGO shows. Images from the Jewish Community Relations Council\u00a0Bay Area show the building\u2019s interior walls covered in what the group called \u201cantisemitic graffiti,\u201d reading, \u201cZionism is Nazism\u201d and \u201cMartyrs never die.\u201d \u201cThe Star of David, the most recognizable symbol in Judaism, is seen equated with a swastika,\u201d the council said Wednesday in an X post. \u201cThis is not protest, this is pure hate.\u201d The building\u2019s takeover came a day after the UCB Divest Coalition\u00a0agreed to end its campus encampment following discussions with university leadership. The coalition did not initiate the break-in at the Anna Head complex, Mogulof said. UC Berkeley\u2019s chancellor was relieved to bring the encampment protests to a peaceful end, noting the school\u2019s leadership does not support full divestment from Israel at this time, she said. \u201cThe sale of direct investments is not within the authority of the Office of the Chancellor but rather lies with the UC Regents,\u201d Carol Christ wrote Tuesday in a letter\u00a0to the Free Palestine Encampment. If all divestment demands by students were met, the University of California system would have to sell $32 billion of its $175 billion portfolio, UC\u2019s Chief Investment Officer Jagdeep Singh Bachher said Tuesday during an Investments Committee meeting held as part of this week\u2019s monthly UC Board of Regents meeting at its Merced campus. University of Washington president calls for encampment break-up as antisemitic graffiti found on campus: After\u00a0protests escalated at the University of\u00a0Washington\u00a0\u2013 with \u201coffensive\u00a0graffiti\u00a0across multiple\u00a0buildings\u00a0all\u00a0over\u00a0campus, some quite clearly both antisemitic\u00a0and\u00a0violent\u201d \u2013 the school\u2019s president is calling again for the voluntary dismantling\u00a0of\u00a0a pro-Palestinian encampment on\u00a0the Seattle campus. Students and faculty on Wednesday discovered the graffiti, which has \u201ccreat(ed) an unwelcome\u00a0and fearful environment for many students, faculty\u00a0and staff, especially those who are Jewish,\u201d President Ana Mari Cauce said later that day in a statement, calling the situation \u201cuntenable.\u201d Cauce asked for the tent camp to break up, echoing her entreaty last week to demonstrators \u201cto dismantle the encampment\u00a0voluntarily for everyone\u2019s safety.\u201d \u201cMuch to my dismay, given the relatively cordial tone\u00a0of\u00a0many\u00a0of\u00a0our discussions, the representatives also said the new\u00a0graffiti\u00a0is an intentional escalation to compel the\u00a0University\u00a0to agree to their demands,\u201d she said Wednesday, adding university officials \u201chave engaged sincerely\u00a0and\u00a0openly.\u201d Among protesters\u2019 \u201cescalating demands\u201d is \u201ca new department that would have an \u2018anti-Zionist\u2019 litmus test for faculty hiring,\u201d Cauce said in the statement. \u201cMany\u00a0of\u00a0these demands, especially the most recent, are contrary to academic freedom\u00a0and/or to state or federal law.\u201d \u201cWhile I strongly support free speech\u00a0and\u00a0peaceful\u00a0protest, I also strongly support the rights\u00a0of\u00a0all\u00a0our community members to live, learn\u00a0and\u00a0work without fear,\u201d she\u00a0said. \u201cThe\u00a0University\u2019s response to students\u2019\u00a0calls\u00a0for change will not be based on an encampment.\u201d DePaul\u00a0University protest\u00a0encampment removed by police: Police in riot gear moved protesters away and dismantled tents Thursday morning at a pro-Palestinian protest encampment at DePaul University in Chicago, video from\u00a0CNN affiliate WLS\u00a0shows.  Two protesters accused of blocking nearby traffic were arrested, school spokesperson Russell Dorn told CNN, adding no arrests were made in the campus quad. The decision to dismantle the encampment came after \u201cgood faith efforts\u201d to negotiate with organizers, DePaul President Robert Manuel said. \u201cFrom the beginning of the\u00a0encampment, I have said that\u00a0we would protect free speech and the ability to dissent until it either prevented us from carrying out the operations of our university or threatened the safety of the members of our community,\u201d Manuel\u00a0said\u00a0in an open letter to students and employees. \u201cI am deeply saddened to say the encampment has crossed that\u00a0line.\u201d University buildings have been vandalized with graffiti, and the cost to repair the physical damage to the quad, which will be \u201cclosed to everyone\u201d until further notice, appears to be nearly $180,000, Manuel said in his letter. The DePaul Divestment Coalition \u2013 a multiethnic, multifaith student group \u2013 has been calling on DePaul to \u201cdivest from killing and harm abroad\u201d since its encampment was set up April 30. \u201cDePaul\u2019s administration chose to use violence to disperse the encampment and unilaterally withdrew from negotiations,\u201d Benjamin Meyer, an attorney representing the coalition said. \u201cThe students sent administration a calendar invite for a meeting on Monday, in which none of the administrators attended.\u201d Morehouse College could stop graduation if Biden\u2019s speech is disrupted: Morehouse College\u2019s president has vowed to combat any disruptive behavior during President Joe Biden\u2019s scheduled graduation speech Sunday at the preeminent historically Black institution by shutting down commencement \u201con the spot.\u201d \u201cSo, for example, prolonged shouting down of the president as he speaks,\u201d Morehouse College President David A. Thomas told CNN\u2019s Victor Blackwell on Thursday.\u00a0\u201cI have also made a decision that we will also not ask police to take individuals out of commencement in zip ties. \u201cIf faced with the choice, I will cease the ceremonies on the spot if we were to reach that position.\u201d Biden\u2019s visit to the Atlanta campus approaches as he seeks to convince young voters to send him to the White House for another term, even as many have expressed frustration for his administration\u2019s continued support of Israel\u2019s military campaign in Gaza.

Union City Police arrested Atlanta police officer Koby Minor Wednesday, according to a news release from the Atlanta Police Department. Minor resigned from the department later that day. Minor was charged with murder and aggravated assault after shooting his Lyft driver, a release from the Union City Police Department said. The Lyft driver was identified by authorities as Reginald Folks and was pronounced dead at the scene. The affidavit said he was shot in the head. \u201cOur hearts are with Mr. Folks\u2019 loved ones as they confront this unspeakable tragedy, and we have reached out to offer our support during this difficult time,\u201d Lyft said in a statement shared with CNN. \u201cWe stand ready to assist law enforcement with any investigation and have permanently banned the rider\u2019s account from the Lyft community.\u201d A passerby who saw Minor waving his hand on the side of Stonewall Tell Road in Union City called police, the affidavit said. Minor told the passerby he believed he was getting kidnapped by Folks, according to the affidavit. Minor recounted to police he had gotten in the Lyft after leaving another police officer\u2019s home that evening. He told officers Folks was talking on the phone through his car\u2019s Bluetooth in an unknown language and Minor said he \u201cheard what he thought was another voice in his ear talking to him but did not say what the voice said.\u201d Minor told police he then asked Folks to stop the car but he continued to drive. When they came to a red light, Minor tried to unlock and open the door but he could not get the door open. He then added Folks turned around and attempted to reach in the back seat, which is when Minor shot him. He fired approximately three shots, broke the window of the vehicle, and exited. Minor is being held in Fulton County Jail. CNN has been unable to determine if Minor has obtained legal representation. The Atlanta Police Department hired Minor in 2018 and was on unpaid administrative leave during the time of his arrest this week, the department statement said. He was previously arrested in Milton in December 2023, and he was relieved of his department-issued firearm as a result, according to the statement, which did not specify the nature of that arrest.

{"id": "2024_05_17_us_school-segregation-brown-v-board-dg", "text": "Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas \u2013 the landmark Supreme Court decision that declared \u201cseparate but equal\u201d education unconstitutional in the United States\u00a0\u2013\u00a0remains one of the most consequential court cases in American history. As the nation commemorates the ruling\u2019s 70th anniversary, civil rights leaders and advocates tell CNN the case may have paved the way for more equal and integrated schools, but\u00a0fierce \u2013 and continued \u2013 opposition to integration means the ruling in no way assured the end of segregated education in the United States. Although progress has undoubtedly been made over the decades, research shows many school districts today are racially segregated because they are divided along residential and economic lines. At times, federal courts have intervened, ordering some school districts to execute plans to integrate Black and Latino students with their White counterparts to improve educational opportunities. Gary Orfield, a professor at UCLA and co-director of the university\u2019s Civil Rights Project, said although there\u2019s been a steady increase in enrollment of non-White students in public schools, his research shows more students attend schools that are \u201cintensely segregated\u201d now than they did 30 years ago. That\u2019s when the Supreme Court ruled in Board of Education of Oklahoma City v. Dowell that court-ordered desegregation plans were \u201cnot intended to operate in perpetuity,\u201d allowing more segregation to take place over time as school districts reverted to neighborhood zoning. De facto segregation persists today, Orfield said,\u00a0because many states have abandoned efforts to enforce integration.  \u201cThere are many places where courts ended desegregation orders that had been accepted. A great many of the magnet schools that had been integrated for decades under court orders were resegregated,\u201d he said. \u201cThese were such tragic changes, throwing away real successes in a very polarized country.\u201d A \u2018massive resistance\u2019 to integration Historically, efforts to desegregate schools were at times met with violent resistance from White Americans. In response to the Brown decision, 101 southern lawmakers \u2013 roughly a fifth of Congress \u2013 signed what would become known as the \u201cSouthern Manifesto,\u201d which encouraged states to \u201cresist forced integration by any lawful means.\u201d \u201cIf we can organize the Southern States for massive resistance to this order, I think that in time the rest of the country will realize that racial integration is not going to be accepted in the South,\u201d Virginia\u00a0Sen. Harry Flood Byrd said in the days after the ruling was announced. That \u201cmassive resistance\u201d campaign spread throughout southern states. In 1957, three years after the Brown ruling, all eyes turned to Little Rock Central High in Arkansas as nine Black students were escorted into the school by soldiers in the US Army\u2019s 101st Airborne Division. The students are known today as the Little Rock Nine. Then, in 1965, a legal battle over integration in Mississippi began that would last more than 50 years. That year, Dianna Cowan White\u2019s parents listed her as the plaintiff in a lawsuit against the Bolivar County Board of Education, now the Cleveland School District, in Cleveland, Mississippi, because the district still forced Black students to attend an all-Black school. The district fought the lawsuit for more than five decades and in 2016, it would become one of the last in the country to officially desegregate, CNN previously reported. That ruling, advocates say, signaled that the fight to integrate schools was far from over. According to Orfield\u2019s research, which examines school integration across the country, desegregation efforts peaked in the 1980s and there\u2019s since been a decline in the percentage of Black students attending majority-White schools. Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall \u2013 who argued the original Brown v. Board of Education case as a lawyer\u00a0\u2013 wrote the dissenting opinion in Board of Education of Oklahoma City v. Dowell, the 1991 Supreme Court decision that released school districts from desegregation orders. \u201cThe majority today suggests that 13 years of desegregation was enough,\u201d Marshall wrote, adding that in his view, an order to lift any desegregation decree \u201cmust take into account the unique harm\u201d associated with racially segregated schools and \u201cmust expressly demand the elimination of such schools.\u201d But even in schools that are integrated, racist bullying and discrimination persists. From 2018 to 2022, more than 4,300 hate crimes were reported in schools, with the largest number of alleged offenses being motivated by anti-Black bias, according to a report from the Department of Justice released in January. \u2018Vestiges of segregation\u2019 As of 2020, more than 700 school districts and charter schools were under a legal desegregation order or voluntary agreement to desegregate, according to the Century Foundation, an independent think tank that works toward equity in education, among other goals. Leslie Fenwick, dean emeritus and professor at the Howard University School of Education, told CNN the decades of opposition to integration efforts has also led to a decrease in the number of Black educators. She explores\u00a0the unintended consequences to the Brown decision in her book,\u00a0\u201cJim Crow\u2019s Pink Slip: The Untold Story of Black Principal and Teacher Leadership.\u201d \u201cWe never define segregation the right way. In everybody\u2019s mind still, when we say segregation, we\u2019re only focused on students,\u201d she told CNN.  \u201cThe great failing, not of the decision, but of massive resistance to the decision, was that we wiped out 100,000 Black principals and teachers who were fired, dismissed and demoted.\u201d The original Brown v. Board of Education case was also litigated by lawyers with the NAACP\u2019s Legal Defense Fund, the nation\u2019s first civil rights law firm, which Marshall founded in 1940. Since the Brown ruling, the civil rights legal group says it has \u201csued hundreds of school districts across the country to vindicate the promise of Brown.\u201d Today, there are more than 200 open school desegregation cases currently on the federal dockets, according to the LDF, which estimates its lawyers are handling about a hundred of those cases. Michaele Turnage Young, senior counsel and co-manager of the Equal Protection Initiative at the LDF, said these lawsuits are necessary because the \u201cvestiges of school segregation\u201d still exist today.  Young said many majority-White schools are often better equipped with educational resources and better trained staff than majority-Black schools in the same school district. She noted other disparities include a lack of screenings for gifted programs, college prep programs and extracurricular activity offerings, and lower graduation rates. The anniversary of Brown v. Board of Education comes nearly a year after the Supreme Court gutted affirmative action in higher education, which sparked a conservative-led movement to outlaw diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs at public colleges and universities. Some critics of DEI say the programs are discriminatory against White Americans. But civil rights advocates and legal scholars tell CNN that arguments to end affirmative action and curb DEI are often premised on the idea that America has already achieved racial equality in education \u2013 a notion they say is far from the truth. NAACP President and CEO Derrick Johnson said he hasn\u2019t been surprised by the culture war that\u2019s now playing out in school districts across the country because \u201chistory has taught us that progress is not made in a straight line.\u201d \u201cWe will continue to see these reactions until more citizens realize that equal protection under the law, our ability to grow and prosper as a nation, will be based on our diversity and not on a single culture or racial identity,\u201d Johnson said. Dianna Cowan White told CNN her parents were able to enroll her in an all-White school while their legal case against the Bolivar School District wound through the courts. More than 50 years later, she says she can still recall how her 6th grade\u00a0classmates taunted her, often saying \u201cgo back to where you came from\u201d or, \u201cdid you paint your skin black?\u201d \u201cThey did not want me there,\u201d White told CNN. \u201cI felt like I was alone.\u201d But she also recalled the all-White school had better quality books, and was teaching a curriculum that was far more advanced than the Black school she had previously attended in the same district. The experience ultimately influenced her decision to send her children to racially diverse schools, despite the racism she encountered, because she felt they would have better opportunities. White said\u00a0when she learned of the judge\u2019s ruling to desegregate the school district in 2016 her first reaction was, \u201cit was about time.\u201d \u201cWe are in the 21st century, when do you let it go?\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/17/us/school-segregation-brown-v-board-dg/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "us"}}

Authorities have not provided information on how they died and it\u2019s unclear how investigators linked Calhoun to the three deaths. \u201cI want to acknowledge the families of these women,\u201d Multnomah County District Attorney Mike Schmidt said in a news conference Friday. \u201cThis community holds you in our hearts and is here to support you.\u201d Calhoun, who was arrested on an unrelated charge, is expected to be transferred to the custody of Multnomah County for arraignment, the release reads. An arraignment date has not been set yet. CNN is working to identify and contact an attorney for Calhoun. Last year, authorities in\u00a0Oregon said they believed the\u00a0deaths\u00a0of Perry and Webster were connected to the deaths of two other\u00a0Oregon women, Kristin Smith and Ashley Real. Senior Deputy District Attorney Melissa Marrero\u00a0said Friday that authorities are \u201cstill very much investigating\u201d their deaths. \u201cJust because not all\u00a0of\u00a0these girls have their\u00a0charges\u00a0have been\u00a0brought up yet\u2014for\u00a0the other families\u2014does not mean that we are not still standing beside them,\u201d a member of Perry\u2019s family said\u00a0during the\u00a0news\u00a0conference.\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019re still together, the whole way, all the way.\u201d Smith\u2019s mother spoke about the cases of her daughter and Real, saying, \u201cWe just keep going. We keep waiting, we keep praying and stay hopeful \u2026 that we soon can get justice\u00a0for\u00a0them as well.\u201d What we know about the deaths of the 3 women On April 27, 2023, the\u00a0Multnomah County Sheriff\u2019s Office posted\u00a0about Perry\u2019s \u201csuspicious death,\u201d saying her body was found near a highway just northeast of Portland three days earlier. \u201cThe last known area that Perry was known to frequent was downtown Portland \u2026 at the beginning of March,\u201d the sheriff\u2019s office said. Days later, the body of Webster was found on April 30 near Mill Creek, which is about 50 miles southwest of Portland, according to the\u00a0Polk County Sheriff\u2019s Office. The office called Webster\u2019s death \u201csuspicious,\u201d and asked anyone who knew her or had information about her death to contact authorities. \u201cThe last known area that Webster was known to frequent was the Portland metro area, particularly Portland, Oregon City, and Milwaukie,\u201d the sheriff\u2019s office said in a Facebook post. Speaks was found earlier that month, when officers responded to a call in Ridgefield, Washington, on April 8, according to Portland police. \u201cBased on information developed in that investigation, there is reason to believe that the homicide happened in Portland,\u201d the Portland Police Bureau said in November 2023.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/18/us/oregon-women-deaths-indictment/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "us"}}

No foul play is suspected, and officers believe a medical emergency occurred. \u201cAlice was a very dear friend and colleague to all of us at CNN,\u201d Mark Thompson, the network\u2019s CEO, said in an email to staff Saturday. \u201cA political veteran and an Emmy Award-winning journalist who brought an incomparable spark to CNN\u2019s coverage, known across our bureaus not only for her political savvy, but for her unwavering kindness. Our hearts are heavy as we mourn such an extraordinary loss.\u201d Stewart was born on March 11, 1966, in Atlanta. Stewart started her career as a local reporter and producer in Georgia before moving to Little Rock,\u00a0Arkansas,\u00a0to be\u00a0a news anchor, she told\u00a0Harvard International Review. She went on to serve as the communications director in then-Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee\u2019s office before assuming a similar role for his presidential run in 2008. She also served as the communications director for the 2012 Republican presidential bids of former Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann and then former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum, also a former CNN commentator. Most recently, Stewart was the communications director for Texas Sen. Ted Cruz\u2019s 2016 GOP presidential campaign. \u201cAlice was wonderful and talented and a dear friend,\u201d Cruz said in a post on X. \u201cShe lived every day to the fullest, and she will be deeply missed.\u201d CNN hired Stewart as a political commentator ahead of the 2016 election, and she appeared on air frequently to provide insight on the political news of the day, including as recently as Friday on \u201cThe Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer.\u201d \u201cWe always invited her to come on my show because we knew we would be a little bit smarter at the end of that conversation,\u201d Blitzer told Jessica Dean on \u201cCNN Newsroom.\u201d \u201cShe helped our viewers better appreciate what was going on and that\u2019s why we will miss her so much.\u201d CNN anchor and chief political correspondent Dana Bash, who knew Stewart for nearly two decades after first meeting her when Stewart worked for the Huckabee campaign, remembered her Saturday as \u201csomebody who told it straight.\u201d \u201cOne of the many reasons why she was so valuable to us on our political panels \u2026 is because she brought that experience,\u201d Bash added. \u201cShe brought that understanding of how Republican politics, Republican campaigns work and she never, ever did it with anything other than a smile.\u201d Speaking about her role as a commentator for the network, Stewart told\u00a0Harvard Political Review\u00a0in 2020 that she brings \u201ca perspective that I think CNN appreciates.\u201d \u201cMy position at CNN is to be a conservative voice yet an independent thinker,\u201d Stewart said. \u201cI\u2019m not a Kool-Aid drinker; I\u2019m not a never-Trumper, and I didn\u2019t check my common sense and decency at the door when I voted for (Trump).\u201d Former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson on Saturday remembered Stewart as \u201csomeone that believes that politics was about making friends and not creating enemies.\u201d He shared with CNN that Stewart \u201cwas one of the first ones to call me and encourage me\u201d after he\u00a0suspended his presidential campaign\u00a0earlier this year, and that they spoke just last week \u201cabout the mess that we see in our politics today.\u201d \u201cShe was trying to change that and we\u2019ll miss her,\u201d Hutchinson added. Stewart was a co-host of the\u00a0podcast \u201cHot Mics From Left to Right,\u201d alongside fellow CNN commentator Maria Cardona. \u201cI just can\u2019t believe that she\u2019s gone,\u201d Cardona said on \u201cCNN Newsroom,\u201d adding that the two were going to record an episode of their podcast Saturday. \u201cI want everyone to know what a special person she was, especially in this industry. As you know, today\u2019s politics can be indecent and so dirty, and Alice was just such a loving, shining light.\u201d Stewart also served on the\u00a0senior advisory committee\u00a0at the Institute of Politics at Harvard University\u2019s Kennedy School, where she\u00a0previously was a fellow.

{"id": "2024_05_18_politics_fafsa-problems-low-income-families", "text": "At Robert M. La Follette High School in Madison, Wisconsin, some college-bound seniors are still scrambling to submit their federal financial aid forms \u2013 but it\u2019s not for lack of trying. One student and his father, for example, spent more than three hours sitting with a high school counselor in early May trying to submit the FAFSA, the Free Application for Federal Student Aid. But no matter what they tried, they couldn\u2019t find a way around a technical glitch. And it wasn\u2019t the student\u2019s first attempt. He sat with a high school counselor several times since January to try to submit the FAFSA. \u201cYou just feel terrible,\u201d said Vanessa Hlavacka, a counselor for multilingual students at La Follette High School. \u201cIt was the dad\u2019s only day off, and he spent it in my office trying to figure this out,\u201d she said. A botched rollout of an updated version of the FAFSA \u2013 which must be submitted if a student wants to qualify for certain loans, grants and scholarships \u2013 has resulted in multiple problems and delays this year. Submissions across the country are way down, and many students are stuck in limbo, waiting for financial aid information from schools even after the traditional May 1 college decision deadline has come and gone. For many students, the problems with this year\u2019s FAFSA have made a previously frustrating process even more stressful. But for some low-income students, who are most reliant on financial aid, the ripple effects could be long-lasting. Although La Follette has ramped up its support services, roughly half as many of the school\u2019s seniors have been able to successfully submit the FAFSA so far compared with last year\u2019s senior class. \u201cWe are so concerned and worried that these students will not make it to college in the fall,\u201d said Annie Hank Braga, a teacher and co-coordinator of La Follette\u2019s college readiness program. \u201cI worry about the long-term impact it will have on their ability to make a living,\u201d she said. Racing against the clock The congressionally mandated overhaul of the FAFSA was long overdue. The changes were meant to make the form simpler and help more students qualify for federal student aid. While the form is now much shorter, the glitches students are facing this year have made the process for some families more challenging than usual. Plus, the form wasn\u2019t available until late last year, about three months later than it\u2019s typically released. There\u2019s a lot on the line, especially for students at La Follette High School where more than half come from low-income families and more than one-third speak something other than English as their first language. The concern is that some students may give up trying to complete the FAFSA and ultimately skip college altogether because they can\u2019t afford it without the help of federal loans and grants. Others may forgo enrolling at their preferred four-year school and instead decide to enroll in a community college with a more flexible enrollment timeline. Though hundreds of colleges\u00a0have pushed back their decision deadlines this year, not every college has pushed the date past May 1. \u201cI think it\u2019s inevitable that we will see students\u2019 decisions impacted because of this FAFSA rollout,\u201d Hank Braga said. High school ramps up support Once the issues with this year\u2019s FAFSA became apparent, La Follette High School ramped up support services for families of college-bound seniors. When the school held its first FAFSA workshop in January, most families walked away without successfully completing the form. At the time, there were several glitches that applicants were experiencing. \u201cThat\u2019s when our eyes really opened to the roller coaster we were jumping on,\u201d Hank Braga said. Given the way things went, the school counselors decided to offer a second FAFSA workshop in April \u2013 but many families still didn\u2019t have success. Plus, students have experienced hourslong wait times when they call the government\u2019s FAFSA helpline. Counselors have been sitting down one-on-one with students and parents to help guide them through the application process. The school has also partnered with outside organizations like the Fair Opportunity Project, a federally funded group that offers free, virtual FAFSA guidance to students. Some immigrant families face extra hurdles One problem is specifically impacting mixed-status families \u2013 those where a student is documented but one or both parents do not have Social Security numbers. Documented students are eligible for federal student aid, regardless of their parents\u2019 immigration status. But a technical glitch initially prevented students from mixed-status families from submitting the form altogether. Later, the Department of Education provided some workarounds so that a parent without a Social Security number could enter his or her information, but it wasn\u2019t seamless. By the time the department issued a fix to the problem, it was already April 30. Some La Follette students from mixed-status families have had success since then submitting the FAFSA, but others are still having problems. Now, they\u2019re running into issues other students faced months ago and had more time to resolve. Hank Braga is concerned that some of these families, who tend to already be wary of filling out government firms, will just give up. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to try to continue to reassure them that this is safe and this is worth it when it\u2019s not working well,\u201d she said. Tears of frustration and joy The Department of Education has increased its support for students applying for financial aid this year. It provided $50 million in grants to organizations that help students file the FAFSA in early May. The Biden administration has faced criticism for the botched rollout from both Republican and Democratic lawmakers, as well as from college financial aid groups. At the request of some Republican members of Congress, the Government Accountability Office has started an investigation into the new form\u2019s implementation. And some lawmakers are concerned about whether the problems with the FAFSA will be fixed in time for next year. Nationally, the percentage of high school seniors who have filed the FAFSA is down more than 17% compared with last year\u2019s class at this point, according to the National College Attainment Network. And there has a been a bigger decline at lower-income schools and schools with a higher percentage of minority students. Students at La Follette are behind the national trend, but they have had more success filing the FAFSA in recent weeks. Just a few days after the frustrating, three-hour session in Hlavacka\u2019s office with a student and his father, the family was able to successfully submit the FAFSA. \u201cSuddenly we were able to submit it. No problem. We can\u2019t figure out why,\u201d Hlavacka said. The initial problem had occurred when the student invited his father to fill out part of the form. Despite trying different ways to send the virtual invitation, the father\u2019s account wouldn\u2019t provide the ability to access the form. It\u2019s a glitch that several other La Follette students have experienced. \u201cWhen he was able to submit, I started crying. I was just so happy for him,\u201d Hlavacka said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/18/politics/fafsa-problems-low-income-families/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "us"}}

After weeks of salvage operations, the Dali can finally be relocated thanks to a\u00a0series of controlled explosions\u00a0which broke apart a massive piece of the Francis Scott Bridge that had been stuck atop the ship\u2019s bow, officials said. An estimated 500-foot section of the bridge weighing 8-12 million pounds was removed from the ship. \u201cThe\u00a0refloat\u00a0and transit sequence is deliberately designed to ensure all response personnel around the M/V Dali maintain control of the vessel, from\u00a0refloat, transit to, and berthing at a local marine terminal,\u201d Unified Command said in a\u00a0news release\u00a0Saturday. Conditions permitting, the massive ship\u2019s journey will begin around 5 a.m. on Monday during peak high tide, according to Unified Command. Crews will begin prepping the ship about 18 hours before \u2013 about midday on Sunday \u2013 to take full advantage of the high tide, officials added. Up to five tugboats will then tow and push the Dali about two and a half miles to the\u00a0Seagirt Marine Terminal in Baltimore, the release said. It will take an estimated three hours to transport the 984-foot, 106,000-ton ship. The cargo ship collided with the bridge in the early hours of March 26, killing six maintenance workers and causing most of the structure to collapse into the Patapsco River. The disaster shut down most shipping to and from the Port of Baltimore. The crash has prompted multiple investigations, including by the FBI and the US Coast Guard. The ship\u2019s 21-member crew has remained onboard since the collapse, including during the planned explosions on May 13.

{"id": "2024_05_14_us_florida-farm-worker-bus-crash", "text": "The driver of a pickup truck involved in a Tuesday morning crash that killed eight farm workers and left at least 40 people injured in north-central Florida has been charged with eight counts of \u201cDriving Under the Influence - manslaughter,\u201d according to a news release from the\u00a0Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles. The 2010 International Bus carrying \u201capproximately 53 farm workers\u201d and a 2001 Ford Ranger sideswiped each other around 6:35 a.m., about 15 miles west of Ocala, the Florida Highway Patrol said in a statement. The Ford, \u201cfor unknown reasons, traveled toward the center line\u201d before the vehicles struck each other, Lt. Patrick Riordan of the Florida Highway Patrol said during a news conference at the scene. The bus then left the roadway, went through a fence and overturned. Bryan Maclean Howard, the driver of the Ford Ranger, was arrested Tuesday afternoon, Dave Kerner, the executive director of the highway safety department, said in a statement. CNN has not yet been able to determine if Howard has an attorney. Eight people are dead while 45 injured were taken to medical facilities, including eight in critical condition, James Lucas with Marion County Fire Rescue said earlier in the day. \u201cThere\u2019s a high probability this may be beyond eight fatalities,\u201d Riordan said, noting some of the injured, including the driver of the pickup truck, are in \u201cvery serious condition.\u201d \u201cIdentities of the deceased will be released pending next of kin notification,\u201d Kerner said in his statement. \u201cOur sympathies and prayers are with the families of the deceased. Consistent with our duties, the Florida Highway Patrol will conduct both a thorough and exhaustive traffic crash and criminal investigation.\u201d Footage captured by CNN affiliate WESH showed the bus \u2013 which Riordan said was taking the workers to a farm in the area \u2013 lying on its side in a field, with first responders\u2019 vehicles parked nearby, their lights flashing. Marion County Sheriff Billy Woods indicated authorities believe the bus passengers were migrant workers, telling reporters, \u201cWe\u2019re a very big agricultural county. So this time of year, we always have migrant workers that are in our county, that are on buses just like this.\u201d In a news conference Tuesday evening, Juan Sabines, the Mexican consul in Orlando, said the victims were all from Mexico and were in the United States on temporary agricultural worker visas. \u201cPlease pray for these nationals,\u201d Sabines said. \u201cWe hear a lot of bad things of the immigrants all the time, in the reality, these people (are) good people. (They are) very good people, young people.\u201d \u201cThey stay in this country just for work, with (a) visa,\u201d he added. \u201cThese (are) very good people and now they lost the main support of their family.\u201d \u201cWith regret, I confirm the death of 8 agricultural workers,\u201d said Mexico\u2019s Foreign Affairs Secretary Alicia B\u00e1rcena Tuesday in a\u00a0post in Spanish on X. B\u00e1rcena said her country\u2019s consul \u201cwill provide all the support to our compatriots and their families.\u201d Woods noted there were challenges with language barriers, but said bilingual sheriff\u2019s office personnel and support staff were assisting in the investigation.

{"id": "2024_05_18_business_college-graduations-pro-palestinian-protests", "text": "Universities across the United States have adopted a number of tactics in recent weeks to prevent disruptions by pro-Palestinian protesters at graduation ceremonies. Some universities have reached agreements with on-campus demonstrators, while others have cited safety concerns and canceled, postponed or relocated their schoolwide ceremonies. Several schools continue to grapple with pro-Palestinian protesters ahead of their spring commencement, subjecting themselves to internal scrutiny and public criticism. Protesters arrested at UPenn On Friday night, University of Pennsylvania police arrested 19 individuals, including seven students, following an attempt by pro-Palestinian demonstrators to occupy a university building, a\u00a0university spokesperson told CNN Saturday. Penn Against the Occupation announced their intention to occupy Fisher-Bennet Hall in\u00a0a post on the group\u2019s Instagram\u00a0Friday night, calling for people to \u201cflood UPenn for Palestine.\u201d The group called on the school\u2019s administration, in part, to divest from corporations \u201cthat profit from Israel\u2019s war on Gaza and occupation in Palestine and academically from Israel institutions, condemning the scholasticide of Palestinian scholars and universities,\u201d according to another Instagram post. Friday\u2019s arrests follow\u00a0the arrest of at least 33 people\u00a0on May 10 when law enforcement broke down a pro-Palestinian encampment erected on campus. The latest campus arrests also come just a few days before Monday\u2019s universitywide commencement ceremony, where students and their families will be subject to additional safety procedures\u00a0described as\u00a0\u201cairport-style security screening,\u201d the university said in a safety update earlier this month. Guests and graduates\u00a0will not be allowed\u00a0to bring signs, posters, flags and artificial noisemakers, according to school officials. UCLA and Sonoma State face internal division On Thursday, the Academic Senate at the University of California, Los Angeles rejected resolutions of no confidence and censure brought against Gene Block, the school\u2019s chancellor. The resolutions were brought forward in the\u00a0wake of an attack by counterprotesters\u00a0on an on-campus pro-Palestinian encampment on April 30, and claimed Block \u201cfailed to ensure the safety of our students and grievously mishandled\u201d the situation. The no-confidence resolution failed after only 43% of members voted in its favor. The resolution to censure failed to get the majority of votes required to pass by the senate. In all, 88 members voted in favor of the censure, while 88 opposed it, three abstained and 15 were present but didn\u2019t vote. \u201cIt is clear that we are not united in how we view the major events of the past weeks and the campus response to them,\u201d Chair Andrea M. Kasko said Friday in a statement. \u201cI hope that we can try to find common ground as colleagues, and have the courage to listen with open minds and open hearts even when we do not agree.\u201d Also Friday, Mildred Garc\u00eda, the chancellor of the California State University System, announced Sonoma State University President Mike Lee would be stepping down after he sent a message \u201cconcerning an agreement with campus protesters \u2026 sent without the appropriate approvals.\u201d The statement sent by Lee to the Sonoma State campus community on Tuesday included agreements to set up an advisory council of Students for Justice in Palestine as well as a review of the university\u2019s vendor contracts and investments, according to a copy of the message obtained by CNN. \u201cSSU will not pursue or engage in any study abroad programs, faculty exchanges, or other formal collaborations that are sponsored by, or represent, the Israeli state academic and research institutions,\u201d Lee wrote, adding study abroad programs in Israel will be \u201cterminated until further notice.\u201d On Wednesday, Garc\u00eda announced Lee had been placed on administrative leave for \u201cinsubordination.\u201d Morehouse threatens to shut down ceremony \u2018on the spot\u2019 In Atlanta, Morehouse College President David A. Thomas said he would shut down Sunday\u2019s commencement ceremonies \u201con the spot\u201d rather than allow police to remove student protesters during President Joe Biden\u2019s highly anticipated graduation speech. \u201cWhat we won\u2019t allow is disruptive behavior that prevents the ceremony or services from proceeding in a manner that those in attendance can partake and enjoy,\u201d Thomas told CNN\u2019s Victor Blackwell in an interview Thursday. \u201cSo, for example, prolonged shouting down of the president as he speaks.

Thomas said the college will not allow \u201chate speech,\u201d meaning any \u201ccalls for violence against another group or individual.\u201d He said Morehouse is a place that \u201ccan hold the tensions\u201d that have come to a boil at campuses across the nation. \u201cI would rather be the first president to have a failed commencement than to say you are less important than the ceremonies of this institution,\u201d Thomas told CNN. \u201cI thought about it from the vantage point of how should Morehouse show up as an institution. And we should never put the ego of the institution above our values. And one of our values is to see the humanity in all,\u201d he added. Thomas said Morehouse faculty members earlier Thursday voted to award Biden an honorary degree. He said Biden\u2019s decades as a public servant as well as a domestic and international leader whose body of work \u201cmerits an honorary degree from Morehouse College.\u201d \u201cWe need some place in this country that can hold the tensions that threaten to divide us,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cWe look around some of the most venerable institutions of higher education have canceled commencement, canceled valedictorian speakers because of their having spoken out and exercised their rights to free speech.\u201d Thomas said the college would allow silent, non-disruptive protest, even students turning their chairs or theirs backs on Biden \u2013 which, he said, would embarrass him. \u201cAs long as you don\u2019t conduct yourselves in a way that deprives others from being able to participate, consume and celebrate this moment,\u201d said Thomas, who has led Morehouse since 2018. \u201cSilent protests. You want to walk across the stage in a piece of garment that identifies your moral connection to either side of this conflict because we also have Jewish students here, you can do that.\u201d CNN has reached out to the White House for comment. Protests have erupted at college campuses across the country as students have demanded that universities divest from Israel. Commencement ceremonies are taking place against a backdrop of police barricades and heightened law enforcement presence, metal detectors and other security measures. Biden has been\u00a0confronted by some protests\u00a0during his own speeches and campaign events. A Biden speech on abortion rights at George Mason University in Virginia earlier this year was marred by more than a dozen protests over his administration\u2019s support of Israel. Biden is also expected to deliver a commencement address at the United States Military Academy at West Point on May 25.

{"id": "2024_05_16_us_daniel-perry-texas-pardon-recommendation", "text": "Daniel Perry, a former US Army sergeant who was convicted of murdering a protester at a Black Lives Matter rally in 2020, was released from prison Thursday after he was pardoned by Texas Gov. Greg Abbott. Abbott\u2019s decision comes after the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles voted unanimously Thursday to recommend a full pardon and the restoration of firearm rights for Perry, who was sentenced last year to 25 years in prison. Shortly after he was pardoned, Perry was released from Texas Department of Criminal Justice custody, a spokesperson for the agency told CNN. Abbott asked the board to conduct an investigation in April 2023, and in a statement on Thursday, the board said its \u201cinvestigative efforts encompassed a meticulous review of pertinent documents, from police reports to court records, witness statements, and interviews with individuals linked to the case.\u201d Perry faced between five and 99 years in prison for fatally shooting 28-year-old Air Force veteran Garrett Foster at an Austin, Texas, racial justice rally two months after the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Shortly after Perry\u2019s conviction in April 2023, Abbott said he wanted to pardon Perry and issued an unusual request for the state Board of Pardons and Paroles to expedite a review of the case before a sentence was handed down. \u201cAmong the voluminous files reviewed by the Board, they considered information provided by the Travis County District Attorney, the full investigative report on Daniel Perry, plus a review of all the testimony provided at trial,\u201d Abbott said in a statement. \u201cTexas has one of the strongest \u2018Stand Your Ground\u2019 laws of self-defense that cannot be nullified by a jury or a progressive District Attorney. I thank the Board for its thorough investigation, and I approve their pardon recommendation,\u201d Abbott said. The governor can only pardon Perry if the Board of Pardons and Paroles recommends it, according to Texas law. Foster\u2019s mother, Sheila Foster, said she learned of the pardon from a social media post by the governor and couldn\u2019t believe it. \ufeff\u201cEverything that has happened is wrong on so many levels, and I don\u2019t understand why,\u201d Sheila Foster told CNN\u2019s Laura Coates Thursday. \u201cIt is so crystal clear to me that this man needs to be in prison for the rest of his life \u2013 not a mere 25 years. Why he wouldn\u2019t even have to serve a year? I don\u2019t understand.\u201d Doug O\u2019Connell, an attorney for Perry, said in a statement his client is \u201cthrilled\u201d to be free and thanked Abbott and the Texas Board of Pardons and Parole. \u201cI spoke with Daniel this afternoon. He is thrilled and elated to be free. Daniel is also optimistic for his future,\u201d O\u2019Connell said in a statement obtained by CNN. \u201cHe wishes that this tragic event never happened and wishes he never had to defend himself against Mr. Foster\u2019s unlawful actions. At the same time, Daniel recognizes that the Foster family is grieving.\u00a0We are anxious to see Daniel reunited with his family and loved ones.\u201d Prosecutors said Perry, who was stationed at Fort Hood, initiated the fatal encounter when he ran a red light and drove his vehicle into a crowd gathered at the protest. Foster was openly carrying an assault-style rifle \u2013 legal in Texas \u2013 and approached Perry\u2019s car and motioned for him to lower his window, at which point Perry fatally shot him with a handgun, prosecutors said. \u201cToday, a convicted murderer will walk the streets of Texas. Texas Republicans have once again proven that they cannot keep the public safe, they are not the party of \u2018tough on crime,\u2019 and they are not the party of \u2018law and order,\u2019\u201d Texas Democratic Party Chair Gilberto Hinojosa said in a statement responding to the pardon. He added: \u201cMake no mistake: Daniel Perry is a murderer who was on a mission to commit violence against Texans, and today our justice system was hijacked for political gain.\u201d In a statement on Thursday, Foster\u2019s former fianc\u00e9e, Whitney Mitchell, said she is \u201cheartbroken by this lawlessness,\u201d adding Abbott has shown that \u201conly certain lives matter.\u201d \u201cHe has made us all less safe. Daniel Perry texted his friends about plans to murder a protestor he disagreed with,\u201d she said. \u201cAfter a lengthy trial, with an abundance of evidence, 12 impartial Texans determined he that he carried out that plan, and murdered the love of my life.\u201d \u201cWith this pardon, the Governor has desecrated the life of a murdered Texan, impugned that jury\u2019s just verdict, and declared that citizens can be killed with impunity as long as they hold political views that are different from those in power,\u201d Mitchell said. During Perry\u2019s sentencing hearing last May, the prosecution asked that he be sentenced to at least 25 years in prison. They highlighted a stream of racist and inflammatory social media posts Perry wrote prior to the shooting and the defense\u2019s own analysis of his mental disorders and mindset. \u201cThis man is a loaded gun ready to go off on any perceived threat that he thinks he has to address in his black and white world and his us versus them mentality,\u201d a prosecutor said. Perry\u2019s defense team asked for a sentence of 10 years, citing his lack of criminal history, his psychological issues, including complex post-traumatic stress disorder, and praise from several of his military colleagues. They argued his actions were\u00a0justified as self-defense. Perry told police during an interview that he believed Foster was going to aim the firearm at him, according to\u00a0CNN affiliate KEYE. Foster\u2019s mother was \u201cin shock\u201d after learning of Abbott\u2019s pardon, according to Quentin Brogdon, the family\u2019s former attorney who spoke with the mother on Thursday. \u201cTo say that she is devastated is an understatement,\u201d\u00a0Brogdon\u00a0told CNN in a phone interview. The family had pursued a civil case against Perry\u00a0but dropped the case after he was convicted last year, satisfied with the jury \u201cholding him accountable,\u201d Brogdon said, adding the family will be considering any possible legal avenues but the prospects are \u201cgrim.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s hard to believe that the issuance of this pardon does not have some kind of political motivation,\u201d Brogdon said, citing Abbott\u2019s involvement in the case after conservative commentators criticized Perry\u2019s conviction last year. Perry diagnosed with complex PTSD and autism For the defense, Greg Hupp, a forensic psychologist who examined Perry twice in 2023, testified during his sentencing he diagnosed him with complex post-traumatic stress disorder and autism spectrum disorder. Combined with his military experience, Perry had an \u201cus versus them\u201d mentality in which his mindset was, \u201cI protect myself. I am ready for any imminent attack and anything out there can be a potential threat,\u201d Hupp said. On cross-examination, the prosecution noted that military records did not indicate either of these psychological issues. During Perry\u2019s sentencing, Mitchell testified through tears how her life had changed since his death. Mitchell is a quadruple amputee and said Foster had been her sole caretaker for the past 11 years, helping her get ready for the day, eat and work as a costume designer. They had bought a house in Austin together, and she said it\u2019s difficult to stay there without him. \u201cIt\u2019s hard every day that I\u2019m there. It\u2019s hard to sleep in my bed because he\u2019s not there,\u201d she said. \u201cHe was my main caregiver for 11 years and I\u2019ve had friends who have been taking care of me and have to learn how to do all that stuff that Garrett was doing for me for a decade, and it\u2019s hard because I had to get comfortable being vulnerable.\u201d Perry made comments on social media about killing protesters, documents show Documents related to the case that were unsealed by a Travis County judge following Perry\u2019s conviction show he had a yearslong history of making racist comments in messages and social media posts. In a Facebook message from May 2020, just weeks before the shooting, Perry told a friend he \u201cmight have to kill a few people\u201d who were rioting outside his apartment. The documents also contain a May 2020 text sent by Perry that said, \u201cI might go to Dallas to shoot looters.\u201d Some messages included \u201cwhite power\u201d memes. Perry wrote in a 2019 message that it was \u201cto bad we can\u2019t get paid for hunting Muslims in Europe.\u201d In a June 1, 2020, social media comment, Perry compared the Black Lives Matter movement to \u201ca zoo full of monkeys that are freaking out flinging their sh*t,\u201d the documents show. Clint Broden, Perry\u2019s attorney, criticized the release of the documents in a statement to CNN, calling it a political decision by prosecutors. CNN\u2019s Eric Levenson, Lucy Kafanov, Joe Sutton and Nouran Salahieh contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/16/us/daniel-perry-texas-pardon-recommendation/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_05_18_us_covid-victims-death-memorial-website", "text": "Four years ago, Jody Settle and his partner toasted over Guinness beers and a takeout meal they had picked up from a normally bustling Irish pub in New York City left deserted by the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic. It was the last St. Patrick\u2019s Day meal the couple would share. Settle, 58, died from the virus 33 days later, on April 19, 2020, one of nearly 1.2 million people in the United States who have succumbed to Covid-19 since 2020. Ed Koenig, Settle\u2019s longtime partner, remembers Settle\u2019s peaceful face as he visited him in the hospital for the last time. Willie Nelson\u2019s version of \u201cAlways On My Mind\u201d played nearby as Koenig kissed Settle\u2019s forehead through his protective gear. A year ago, the World Health Organization declared an end to Covid-19 as a global public health emergency. The United States allowed its own public health emergency to expire nearly a week after the WHO\u2019s announcement.  Stay-at-home orders have long ended, and much of society has moved on from the pandemic.  But Covid-19-related grief lingers for millions. On the fourth anniversary of Settle\u2019s death \u2013 and driven by a need to mourn \u2013 Koenig wrote about his former partner on the Covid-19 remembrance website WhoWeLost. In part, he shared: \u201cYes, indeed, you will always be on my mind.\u201d The website, launched in 2020 in Kentucky and home to around 2,000 published and yet-to-be-published stories, serves as a digital haven for Koenig and hundreds of others. Those still grieving can write about their losses in a comment-free environment without interactions, judgment, internet trolls and the sometimes toxic nature of social media conversations surrounding the virus \u2013 including whether Covid-19 is even real, according to the website\u2019s founder, Martha Greenwald.  \u201cIt\u2019s their sacred space to say what they need without someone throwing all this cruelty at them,\u201d Greenwald, a poet and former English professor from New Jersey, said of her nonprofit website. Greenwald, who lives in Louisville, Kentucky, started The WhoWeLost Project for bereaved Kentuckians, inspired by the state\u2019s public health commissioner, who in October 2020 called on state residents to share their Covid-19 concerns with him. The project offers writing prompts and guidance for those looking to share their memories. Greenwald expanded the website nationally after a 2021 story on the website from an NPR affiliate garnered widespread praise.  \u201cI think the need for the site, in a way, is larger because less people are paying attention (to Covid-19),\u201d Greenwald told CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the last places that are still paying attention.\u201d Coping with Covid-19-related grief Researchers studying the pandemic\u2019s repercussions have found that grieving relatives of Covid-19 victims experienced higher rates of a prolonged grief disorder when compared with pre-pandemic periods. In general, the disorder, characterized by acute and insistent grief, impacts between 7% and 10% of adults and between 5% and 10% of children, according to the American Psychiatric Association. In a 2023 study, researchers in the United Kingdom found people were more than three times as likely to exhibit prolonged grief disorder symptoms 13 months after losing a loved one during the pandemic than compared with pre-pandemic times. \u201cThere\u2019s this lingering sense that their loved ones and their own grief were never allowed to exist, so it\u2019s very repressed and kind of still simmering under the surface for a lot of them,\u201d Greenwald said of the writers on WhoWeLost.org. \u201c(For) the people whose loved ones died early on during Covid, there were no funerals, so all the stories that could have been told at that wake that didn\u2019t happen. They can write those stories down here.\u201d New York City resident Wiandy Santiago\u2019s 65-year-old brother Wilmard Santiago died of Covid-19 in April 2020, a week after being placed on a ventilator. The family, limited to 10 funeral attendees standing 6 feet apart, couldn\u2019t hold a service for him until two months after his death. She says she wasn\u2019t able to mourn her brother in person with family. \u201c(We) grieved through a Zoom call,\u201d Wiandy Santiago told CNN. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing like being able to sit next to your loved one and grieve your brother, your sister, your spouse, your child.\u201d Her stepson, Alberto Locascio, died of the virus in September 2021, a week before his 40th birthday. \u201cUnless you went through it, you don\u2019t understand why it doesn\u2019t go away,\u201d she said of what she described as \u201ca complicated grief\u201d in a post on WhoWeLost.org. As she spoke, her eyes moistened. She says she has often wondered about her big brother\u2019s final thoughts. He died alone in a Bronx hospital without his wife and two sons by his side. \u201cWhat was he feeling? Was he scared?\u201d Santiago said amid tears, her voice quivering with the pain of never getting to say goodbye. She says she\u2019s sought solace in writing about her late relatives through the WhoWeLost project. Over the past two years, she\u2019s used the site to write poignant stories about the lives of her brother and stepson \u2013 like how Wilmard loved photography and the Yankees, or how Locascio was a kind and gentle soul who their family considered their protector. Scrolling Facebook through recent prom photos of Locascio\u2019s son brought a mix of emotions, she recently wrote on the website. \u201cI was sad for Nicholas who would have loved to have his dad there with him. So happy, yet so sad,\u201d Santiago wrote. She opens up about her lingering grief in many of the posts. \u201cI feel that healing comes from writing, releasing those emotions,\u201d she said. Greenwald agrees. She\u2019s a special adviser for Rituals in the Making, a research project by the anthropology department at George Washington University that has in part examined the ways in which those in mourning adapt when their normal rituals, like funerals, are interrupted. \u201cRituals can really help the surviving family and friends to feel that loss is recognized,\u201d said Sarah Wagner, a principal investigator on Rituals in the Making. \u201cWhen that does not happen, there\u2019s all kinds of ways that mourning stretches on and intensifies, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing with the pandemic.\u201d A safe place to grieve on their own terms Before discovering WhoWeLost, Koenig turned to social media for support from others grieving Covid-19-related deaths, but he says problems often arose in these settings as trolls bombarded\u00a0mourners\u00a0with horrendous comments. \u201cCovid isn\u2019t real, they died of something else.\u201d Koenig says that was a typical response in social media posts. Even as Covid-19 deaths climbed into the tens of thousands during the pandemic, a misinformation-led sector of society, fueled by political polarization, disregarded the virus\u2019s seriousness. Others denied its existence despite evidence from public health experts showing otherwise. A 2020 YouGov study found 13% of people polled in the US believed the coronavirus, or the virus that causes Covid-19, did not exist. The Poynter Institute\u2019s fact-checking website Politifact labeled claims that denied, downplayed or spread disinformation about Covid-19 as its \u201clie of the year\u201d in 2020. Koenig says the most offensive remarks he saw were expletive-filled death wishes hurled toward the LGBTQ+ community. \u201cAll you perverts are going to hell anyway, so what difference does it make?\u201d Koenig recalled reading. On WhoWeLost.org, those coping with prolonged grief are free to share their experiences away from those negative online conversations, Greenwald says. Many of the comments Greenwald says she has seen have involved shaming victims afflicted by more than one condition or disease at a time. \u201cIf someone posted that their mother died of cancer, they would get the usual \u2018sorry for your loss,\u2019 but if they posted that their mother died of Covid, then the comments might be something like, \u2018well, didn\u2019t she have cancer?\u2019 or \u2018she had a heart problem,\u2019 or \u2018she was a smoker,\u2019\u201d Greenwald said. Even when no one is shaming them about comorbidities or denying Covid-19\u2019s existence, Greenwald says the bereaved may feel no one wants to hear about what they\u2019re going through. The WhoWeLost project is still listening, Greenwald says. \u201cI know so many people who will say, \u2018my co-workers don\u2019t want to hear about it, or they tiptoe around the subject,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re still wanting to hear what you have to say even though everybody else wants you to shut up.\u201d Paige Gavin, a master\u2019s student also working on Rituals in the Making, said of WhoWeLost: \u201cThe ability for mourners to reflect on the positiveness of seeing their loved one \u2013 not just in their death, but in the life that they lived \u2013 I think that\u2019s been one of the benefits alongside having a place to tell that story.\u201d Wagner described WhoWeLost as a space for the bereaved to memorialize on their own terms. \u201cGiven that there was so much politicization, I think it is an opportunity for people to reflect on how Covid didn\u2019t define their loved one,\u201d Wagner said. \u201cCovid was so polarizing, and yet, it\u2019s a space that doesn\u2019t have to be about Covid at all.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/18/us/covid-victims-death-memorial-website/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_05_14_us_westminster-dog-show-winner-sage-poodle-cec", "text": "Sage the Miniature Poodle has won best in show at the 2024 Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show. The all-black ball of fluff claimed the non-sporting group earlier in the event, and cemented herself as a new feminist hero by being the first female Best in Show winner since 2020. Mercedes the German Shepherd, winner of the herding group, claimed second honors of the night as Reserve Best in Show. Poodles have an illustrious record at Westminster. Twelve standard poodles have taken home the top prize over the years. Poodles of all sizes were also one of the most represented breeds at this year\u2019s event, with 43 entrants. However, Sage isn\u2019t just a poodle. She\u2019s a Miniature Poodle, and is the 4th of her kind to claim Westminster\u2019s Best in Show. The Westminster Dog Show has been delighting lovers of finely-groomed pups since 1877, making it the second-oldest continuously held sporting event in the US after the Kentucky Derby. Every year, about 3,000 dogs and their handlers compete in the storied show. The main competition focuses on how well purebred dogs conform to their breed\u2019s standards. Dogs from every background also compete in the Masters Agility Championship and the Masters Obedience Championship. Of course, Best in Show is the real gem of the event. The winning dog is chosen from among seven group winners. Each group comprises breeds with similar traits, like a kind of dog astrology. This years group winners were: Herding group: Mercedes the German Shepherd Hound Group: Louis the Afghan Hound Non-sporting group: Sage the Miniature Poodle Sporting group: Micha the Black Cocker Spaniel Terrier group: Frankie the Bull Terrier (Colored) Toy group: Comet the Shih Tzu Woking group: Monty the Giant Schnauzer Those unfamiliar with the intricacies of fine dog shows may be surprised to know the fate of the Westminster hopefuls rests in just a few hands. Only one judge makes the winning decision for each of the seven groups, culling (figuratively) one top dog from hundreds. Likewise, there is only one judge for Best in Show. This year, the honor went to Kennel Club judge Rosalind Kramer. As the Best in Show judge, Kramer was sequestered before the final round and didn\u2019t know which dogs she would be judging until she stepped into the ring. \u201cThis is the most incredible lineup of dogs, it\u2019s absolutely glorious,\u201d she said before announcing Best in Show. The Westminster Dog Show is also the perfect place to learn fun facts about dogs, like the fact that three US presidents have owned Scottish Terriers or that dogs from Canada hold six Westminster \u201cBest in Show\u201d titles. But not this year. This year, the crown will be worn by a fluffy little lady from Houston, Texas. \u201cNo words, I\u2019m so happy. Exciting,\u201d Sage\u2019s breeder and handler Kaz Hosaka said after the win, in what is his last show after 45 Westminster competitions. \u201cWalked in this ring tonight, she\u2019s kind of not sure, but then she get used to it and then she gave a great performance for me. I\u2019m proud of this dog and thank you very much.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/14/us/westminster-dog-show-winner-sage-poodle-cec/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_05_15_us_law-enforcement-detains-protesters-university-of-california-irvine-encampment", "text": "Police detained at least a dozen pro-Palestinian demonstrators at the University of California, Irvine, as they cleared an encampment in front of a lecture hall on Wednesday. \u201cA group of several hundred protestors entered the UC Irvine campus and began surrounding\u201d the school\u2019s Physical Sciences Lecture Hall at\u00a0around 2:30 p.m., the\u00a0university\u00a0said in an emergency update. The\u00a0university\u00a0put out a mutual aid call to local law\u00a0enforcement\u00a0and received assistance from the\u00a0Irvine\u00a0Police Department and Orange County Sheriff\u2019s Department, it said. The protesters moved \u201cin a coordinated fashion \u2026 out of the encampment to the Physical Sciences Lecture Hall, where a small group barricaded themselves in, supported by a large group of community members who had gathered for a scheduled rally,\u201d said Chancellor Howard Gillman in a statement after the police action. \u201cWhat a sad day for our university. I\u2019m brokenhearted,\u201d Gillman said. \u201cAfter weeks when the encampers assured our community that they were committed to maintaining a peaceful and nondisruptive encampment, it was terrible to see that they would dramatically alter the situation in a way that was a direct assault on the rights of other students and the university mission.\u201d Authorities cleared\u00a0what looked like at least half\u00a0of student protesters at\u00a0the encampment, aerial footage from CNN affiliate KABC showed. At least a dozen people were seen being detained in the video. Law enforcement used zip ties to restrain protesters and escorted them\u00a0away from the encampment toward a parking lot. It\u2019s unclear exactly how many people were detained during the incident. CNN has reached out to the Irvine Police Department, the Orange County Sheriff\u2019s Department and UC Irvine to confirm the number of protesters who were detained. Law\u00a0enforcement\u00a0started breaking up the\u00a0encampment\u00a0at\u00a0the\u00a0university shortly after 5:10 p.m. Wednesday, aerials show. The aerial footage shows a large cluster of police officers surrounding the group of tents outside the hall as they face a line of several protesters, and a number of protesters can be seen getting detained. Protesters seemingly attempted to reestablish a barrier\u00a0taken down earlier by law enforcement\u00a0by piling wood panels and tents on top of one another.\u00a0Live pictures from KABC show\u00a0law enforcement\u00a0dismantling these structures. A sign on the building behind the encampment says \u201cUC Divest from genocide\u201d and another under it appears to say \u201cdrop suspensions defend students.\u201d A large sign hung next to those on the building reads \u201cAlex Odeh Hall,\u201d seemingly referencing the Palestinian activist who served as the West Coast regional director of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee. The\u00a0majority of the protesters have dispersed from\u00a0their encampment, but a small group of people remained scattered in a grassy area nearby, footage from KABC and KCAL show. \u201cProtest activity continues in the Physical Science Quad and Aldrich Park areas,\u201d the university said. \u201cPlease avoid the area until further notice.\u201d Classes were canceled for the remainder\u00a0of\u00a0the day Wednesday and the\u00a0university\u00a0urged people to stay away from campus, according to the emergency update. The university initially asked anyone in the area to shelter in place, but later said they should leave the area. Classes will be\u00a0held\u00a0remotely Thursday, the university said in an\u00a0emergency update. Divestment negotiations were ongoing Pro-Palestinian protesters had established an encampment on the campus on April 29. That day, the university called in local law enforcement officials to assist campus police with the protest. Days later, Gillman said in a statement to the campus community that the university would continue to negotiate with pro-Palestinian demonstrators on campus over issues of divestment. Student protesters opposing Israel\u2019s military action in Gaza have largely demanded their universities sell investments in companies with financial ties to Israel. The university presented a proposal to student leaders and received a counterproposal in early May. Gillman expressed concerns over some of the requests included in the counterproposal, according to the statement. \u201cThe counterproposal calls for ending numerous external partnerships that support our students through scholarships and facilitate long-standing research collaborations,\u201d Gillman said. \u201cIt also demands an end to a wide-range of academic and research collaborations with Israeli organizations and individuals. This would violate fundamental principles of academic freedom and would require us to discriminate based on a person\u2019s nationality, which goes against our commitment to anti-discrimination and our principles of diversity, equity, and inclusion.\u201d In the statement, Gillman also thanked student protesters for ensuring that their encampment \u201cremains peaceful and minimally disruptive of university activities.\u201d \u201cAs long as this remains the situation, there is no cause to involve law enforcement, except as needed to help ensure the safety of the protestors and others in the area,\u201d he said at the time. In his Wednesday statement, Gillman said UC Irvine \u201calong with most other UC campuses, received the latest \u2018demands\u2019 from the protesters\u201d earlier that day. The demands \u201cattempted to dictate that anyone who disagreed with them must conform to their opinions,\u201d Gillman said. \u201cBut my concern now is not the unreasonableness of their demands. It is their decision to transform a manageable situation that did not have to involve police into a situation that required a different response,\u201d Gillman said in the statement. Irvine Mayor says protests are \u201cnot a threat\u201d In response to UC Irvine\u2019s law enforcement presence, Irvine Mayor Farrah N. Khan said protesters don\u2019t threaten campus security and shouldn\u2019t be met with violence. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame that peaceful free speech protests are always responded to with violence. Taking space on campus or in a building is not a threat to anyone,\u201d Khan said in a post on X Wednesday. \u201cUCI leadership must do everything they can to avoid creating a violent scenario here. These are your students w/ zero weapons.\u201d The United Auto Workers 4811, which represents 48,000 University of California academic workers, has authorized a strike \u201cif circumstances justify,\u201d citing \u201cnumerous, egregious unfair labor practices committed\u201d during on-campus protests. Specifically, the union mentioned the handling of protests on April 30 and May 1 at the University of California, Los Angeles. The union said in a press release that 19,780 teaching assistants, readers, tutors, student researchers, postdocs and academic researchers at all eleven campuses of the University of California participated in a strike authorization vote, resulting in 79% of participating members voting to authorize the executive board to call a strike if it\u2019s justified. During such a strike, \u201cnot all represented workers are called to go on strike at the same time. Certain campuses may be called to go out on strike at certain times,\u201d the union added. \u201cAt the heart of this is our right to free speech and peaceful protest,\u201d said Rafael Jaime, a graduate worker in the English department and president of UAW 4811.\u00a0\u201cIf members of the academic community are maced and beaten down for peacefully demonstrating on this issue, our ability to speak up on all issues is threatened.\u201d On Friday, the union\u2019s executive board will \u201cevaluate and announce\u201d whether or not they will call on the first campus or campuses to strike, the\u00a0UAW 4811 posted on X.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/us/law-enforcement-detains-protesters-university-of-california-irvine-encampment/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_05_18_us_baltimore-bridge-dali-ship-crew", "text": "When the Rev. Mark Nestlehutt boarded the Dali cargo ship a week after it crashed into a Baltimore bridge, anxious questions emerged among the 21 crew members: \u201cWhen will I get off the ship? When will I be able to get home?\u201d More than a month later, crew members still don\u2019t know the answers. They\u2019ve been confined to the ill-fated Dali ever since it lost power, veered off course and crushed the Francis Scott Key Bridge on March 26, killing six construction workers. Since then, the 20 Indians and one Sri Lankan on board have mourned the deaths of those lives lost, had their cell phones confiscated by the FBI and endured a series of controlled explosions to break apart a massive piece of bridge stuck atop the ship\u2019s bow. \u201cIt has been tough for the seafarers, primarily (because) they know that there\u2019s been loss of life,\u201d said Gwee Guo Duan, assistant general secretary of the Singapore Maritime Officers\u2019 Union, one of the unions representing crew members on the Singaporean-flagged ship. \u201cIt is tough for them, being on board and having to look at the accident site every single day.\u201d But it could be weeks or even months before they can leave, due to an array of complications \u2013 including US visas that expired while they\u2019ve been trapped. Here\u2019s why they\u2019re still stuck on board \u2013 and how they\u2019re coping with unimaginable stressors: Maritime rules say the ship must be staffed A massive vessel like the 984-foot, 106,000-ton Dali requires constant care \u2013 even if it\u2019s not moving. And a ship stuck on a river still faces a host of potential hazards, said Philip C. Schifflin Jr., director of the Center for Mariner Advocacy. \u201cYou can take on water. There\u2019s machinery running \u2026 anytime machinery is running, there\u2019s a particular risk of something failing and causing a fire or something like that,\u201d Schifflin said. \u201cSo seafarers need to be on board ready to respond to those various hazards. And that\u2019s by law.\u201d The United States has \u201cminimum requirements for the manning of vessels,\u201d according to the Office of the Federal Register, and similar international regulations have been widely adopted. \u201cBy international maritime regulations, there has to be some crew left on the vessel,\u201d said Nestlehutt, president and executive director of The Seamen\u2019s Church Institute, which promotes the safety and welfare of mariners. The nonprofit responds to seamen in distress around the world, including those afflicted by hurricanes, pirate incidents or deaths at sea. When Nestlehutt visited the Dali crew on April 1, he immediately noticed their \u201csense of great loss and sadness\u201d about the construction workers killed, and the seamen \u201cwanted to let their own family members know that they were safe,\u201d he said. But days later, the crew lost contact with their families when the FBI seized the crew\u2019s cell phones on April 15 as part of its ongoing investigation into the crash. \u2018Unfounded fear\u2019 among the crew members After the FBI boarded the Dali and seized the seamen\u2019s cell phones, a wave of anxiety permeated the ship, according to a joint statement from the Singapore Maritime Officers\u2019 Union, which represents the ship\u2019s officers, and the Singapore Organisation of Seamen, which represents the other crew members. The seafarers have since received new cell phones, Duan told CNN Thursday. But the FBI has only returned some of the crew members\u2019 SIM cards, he said. Although investigators have not blamed any individual for the power outages that led up to the fatal crash, seamen have felt an \u201cUnfounded fear of personal criminal liability,\u201d the two unions representing the crew members said. \u201cHowever long the investigation takes, the crew\u2019s rights and welfare should not be infringed upon during its course,\u201d\u00a0Dave Heindel, president of the Seafarers International Union, said in a statement. \u201cWe call on the authorities to be mindful that seafarers utilize mobile devices to conduct personal business for bill payments and more importantly, transfer money to their home country to sustain families,\u201d he said. \u201cCrew members are becoming demoralized without the basic tools we all take for granted.\u201d \u201cThe prolonged detention of MV Dali seafarers aboard their vessel and the failure by authorities to return their personal communication devices are unjust,\u201d Don Marcus, president of the International Organization of Masters, Mates & Pilots, said in a statement last weekend. \u201cOur hearts go out to the Master, Officers and Crew of the M/V Dali, who not only suffered a mortifying and tragic experience resulting in the loss of six lives, but who continue to remain in isolation from their loved ones.\u201d Stationary, but not sedentary While they await news about their fates, the crew members are staying busy \u2013 not just with their ship duties but also by helping investigators and salvage crews. \u201cObviously, this is not a normal environment for them. But they\u2019re all professional seafarers, so they\u2019re doing what they need to do,\u201d said Darrell Wilson, spokesperson for Synergy Marine Group \u2013 the company that manages the Dali vessel. \u201cTheir days are full. They have normal duties on board. They need to look after the ship, look after equipment, make sure everything is working and functioning that needs to. They\u2019re also assisting with the salvors.\u201d The seafarers play a critical role in helping the salvage crews because \u201cthey know all the\u00a0passageways. They know where everything is on the ship,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cSo if somebody has a question about where can we hook up to get running water,\u201d the seafarers can help, Wilson said. \u201cThe crew is essentially just assisting in any way possible.\u201d As for who\u2019s helping the crew members with food, toiletries and other day-to-day necessities, Synergy Marine \u201cdispatched reps here immediately \u2026 making sure they have everything they need, helping bring extra supplies on board or arranging for extra supplies to be brought on board,\u201d Wilson said. In addition, \u201cthey have coordinated to have visits by some of the seafarers\u2019 organizations. Some of the seafarers\u2019 ministries have been on. The two respective embassies have been in contact with the crew and even made a visit to the ship,\u201d he said. Synergy has also provided mental health services for the crew, which Duan\u00a0\u2013 the Singapore Maritime Officers\u2019 Union official \u2013\u00a0credits for helping a seaman who was traumatized after he frantically tried to search for survivors the night of the deadly crash. \u201cOne of them actually ran to the front of the vessel, which is the bow, to actually try to look for survivors from the accident\u201d \u2013 despite the heaps of debris from the bridge that could fall at any moment, Duan said. On Monday, after six weeks atop the bow of the Dali, a massive piece of the Key Bridge was blown apart in a series of controlled explosions \u2013 with the crew still on board. Many hoped the removal would mean the crew might be able to set sail or at least get off the ship soon. But more hurdles loom. Their visas expired while they\u2019ve been stuck In addition to the staffing regulations, the ongoing investigations and questions about whether the Dali is fit to sail, the crew members can\u2019t even set foot on US soil. Their one-month visas expired during the nearly two months they\u2019ve been trapped on the Dali, Duan said. Even the ship\u2019s management company doesn\u2019t know when the crew can leave. \u201cThey\u2019re going to be on for the foreseeable future,\u201d Wilson told CNN Wednesday. \u201cWe\u2019re working to refloat the vessel in a few days and move it to a local terminal here. And then at some point in the future \u2013 and I don\u2019t have that date \u2013 the company will look for guidance from the authorities on the next steps with the crew.\u201d Duan,\u00a0who visited the crew April 24 and communicates with the captain regularly, said he doesn\u2019t expect the ship to leave the Baltimore area until authorities have completed their investigation. The National Transportation Safety Board released a preliminary report about the crash earlier this week, which did not include a probable cause. Those findings will be part of a final report that could take investigators up to two years to complete. \u201cWithout the final report, I don\u2019t think the vessel is going anywhere\u201d far from Baltimore, Duan said. In the meantime, he hopes nonessential crew members will be allowed to get off the ship and stay temporarily on dry land to \u201cease their mental stress.\u201d The crew members\u2019 unions have publicly called for the extension or renewal of the seamen\u2019s visas. Duan also hopes US authorities will re-evaluate who must stay on the ship, and who might be able to fly home. \u2018We take their sacrifices for granted\u2019 The plight of the Dali\u2019s crew highlights the personal sacrifices made by workers who often leave their families for months at a time to provide goods that many consumers use every day. \u201cI think most of us think of the items that we use on a daily basis show up on Amazon or \u2026 Walmart, etc. The reality is 90% of the cargo in the world is carried on vessels,\u201d said Schifflin, the director of the Center for Mariner Advocacy. \u201cVessels are manned by seafarers. And to most of us \u2013 the vast majority of us \u2013 they\u2019re invisible. We don\u2019t even know they\u2019re there. And I think a lot of times, we take their sacrifices for granted.\u201d CNN\u2019s Gloria Pazmino contributed to this report.

{"id": "2024_05_16_us_brown-pelicans-california-coast", "text": "Droves of starving brown pelicans have been found stranded on the California coast since late April and the root cause of the event remains a mystery, wildlife watchers say. Arriving dehydrated, starved and injured from fishing lines and hooks, the pelicans are mostly turning up in the Monterey and Santa Cruz areas in Northern California, International Bird Rescue, a nonprofit conservation organization, said on its website. They\u2019re also popping up in \u201codd spots\u201d in Southern California, including a lake at Inglewood\u2019s SoFi Stadium and a fire station in Malibu, the group said The California Department of Fish and Wildlife is \u201cperforming postmortem examinations on brown pelicans sent to our laboratories in Sacramento and Santa Cruz.\u00a0Preliminary findings indicate emaciation as the primary issue contributing to this stranding event,\u201d department spokesperson Tim Daly told CNN in a statement. International Bird Rescue reported more than 260 brown pelicans \u2013 a once endangered species \u2013 have arrived at the organization\u2019s California treatment centers since April 20. \u201cDiagnostic testing has not revealed any evidence of diseases such as bird flu that may be causing these strandings. Bird Rescue\u2019s staff and volunteers are working tirelessly to provide the affected birds with the best care they desperately need to recover and return to the wild,\u201d the group said on its website. The nonprofit said Friday they\u2019re overwhelmed with public donations of surgical tape, syringes, pet hair blow-dryers, waterfowl food, rubber floor mats, gloves and more. Still needed are donations for the cost of fish to feed the pelican patients. The seabirds have displayed this behavior before \u2013 almost exactly two years ago \u2013 in the same areas. And the recovery effort is expensive. In May 2022, the crisis cost the rescue group $45 per day for food, medicine and staff and $2,000 in fish, it said. Before 2022, the last great influx of brown pelicans to International Bird Rescue was in 2012. Two years ago, testing also showed symptoms of starvation in the nearly 800 pelicans that arrived in rehabilitation centers. \u201cIn Spring 2022, the precise factors that contributed to reduced prey intake by the pelicans was not determined although scientists concluded the pelicans likely had difficulty reaching prey fish in the ocean as they normally would,\u201d Daly\u2019s statement said. \u201cIn 2022 and in this current event, strong storm systems occurred in the southern California region in the spring preceding the events, and it\u2019s possible these conditions impacted the pelican\u2019s ability to access prey fish under the water\u2019s surface.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/16/us/brown-pelicans-california-coast/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_05_18_business_price-gouging-explained", "text": "Emily Miller lucked out. Of the millions of fans \u2014 and bots \u2014 flooding Ticketmaster\u2019s site in hopes of purchasing tickets to Taylor Swift\u2019s Eras Tour, the 22-year-old managed to score $200 floor seats to see the mega pop star perform in Pittsburgh last summer. Now, Miller dreams of seeing Swift perform again when her tour returns to the US later this year. But despite entering 10 accounts to get a code that would give her the chance to buy tickets at face value through Ticketmaster\u2019s presale, she was unsuccessful. On the resale market, nosebleed-seat tickets behind the stage are already listed for thousands of dollars. \u201cPeople are taking advantage of fans and their vulnerability because people like me who have been fans of Taylor for so, so long would do genuinely anything just to be inside that stadium,\u201d Miller, who is currently in an accelerated nursing degree program in Cleveland, told CNN. The resellers are price gouging the fans, she said. The term has been used a lot lately to describe so much more than just hiking gasoline prices during a hurricane. At the core of the increasingly common accusation of price gouging is the sense that the consumer is being exploited. But it\u2019s not as cut and dry as you may think. In fact, economists \u2014 and even President Joe Biden \u2014 can\u2019t agree on a definition of it. But there\u2019s one thing everyone agrees on: Just about everything costs more than it used to a few years ago, a consequence of inflation. Although the pace of price increases has cooled substantially, we\u2019re still paying more. It doesn\u2019t help that prices can rise in seconds thanks to technology, unlike times when hikes would require, for instance, printing new menus. Consumers are taking to social media more to draw attention to times they feel like they are being ripped off. When, in effect, they may more likely be victims of inflation \u2014 or good old supply and demand. Price gouging is in the eye of the bidder Gavin Roberts, chair of Weber State University\u2019s economics department and who studies the effect of anti-price gouging laws, said the laws themselves often don\u2019t define what price gouging is. Biden has been quite vocal about cracking down on price gouging, which he uses interchangeably with \u201ccorporate greed,\u201d both of which he claims are a contributing factor to inflation. At the same time, Biden hasn\u2019t defined what price gouging is and what it isn\u2019t. A White House spokesperson declined to weigh in on that, and instead referred CNN to comments Biden made, including: \u201cTo any corporation that has not brought their prices back down \u2014 even as inflation has come down, even supply chains have been rebuilt \u2014 it\u2019s time to stop the price\u00a0gouging,\u201d Biden said last year. Corporations charging as much as they can, as painful as it may be for consumers, doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re necessarily price gouging, said Roberts. In Roberts\u2019 view, price gouging occurs when there\u2019s a scarcity of a good or service, lack of competition and the consumer has very little information about the price they\u2019ll be charged or doesn\u2019t have the ability to shop around for better prices. All that could lead them to be taken advantage of. The best example of this, he said, would be someone going to the emergency room in dire need of care and months later receiving a bill for thousands of dollars. It wouldn\u2019t, in his view, be price gouging if a situation arose during which someone had the only attainable bottle of water and auctioned it off to a crowd of people for the highest possible price. That\u2019s because people had upfront information about how the price was set, he said. Steven Suranovic, an economics professor at George Washington University who has also published research on price gouging, sees it differently. \u201cI define it as the use of market power to secure a higher price than what would occur with free competition,\u201d he said. \u201cFor example, Martin Shkreli was a price gouger when he set ridiculously high prices on some pharmaceutical drugs his company controlled.\u201d When Shkreli was CEO of the company formerly known as Turing Pharmaceuticals, the price of the lifesaving drug Daraprim used by AIDS patients was raised from $13.50 a pill to $750 a pill, in 2015, sparking a public outcry. CNN reached out to Shkreli, who was later convicted of securities fraud and conspiracy, over LinkedIn. Shkreli responded to CNN in a message on LinkedIn: \u201cwe dont talk to snitches.\u201d Price gouging or dynamic pricing? Waiting to order an Uber until you make your way to the lobby of a building could cost you 20% more than the price you saw when you first opened the app. That\u2019s the essence of the Uber business model, a practice known as dynamic pricing where there is no fixed rate for how much your ride will cost. Rather, it is tied to the supply of drivers in a given area and the demand for rides. Uber, like its main competitor Lyft, has come under scrutiny for allowing prices to surge at times when public transit is severely disrupted. In some instances, the companies suspended surge pricing temporarily. (Neither company responded to requests for comment.) Surge pricing was in full effect, though, on New Year\u2019s Eve of 2011 when Uber experienced what was then its highest demand in New York City, causing rides to spike above $100. That invited a slew of price gouging accusations. Travis Kalanick, the CEO at the time, later penned a blog post noting, \u201cNobody is required to take an Uber, but having a reliable option is what we\u2019re shooting for. It\u2019s not about gouging.\u201d Suranovic said surge pricing can simply be a product of \u201ca competitive market.\u201d But he acknowledged that sudden price increases are more likely to lead consumers to believe they\u2019re being price gouged and \u201cblame business for profiteering.\u201d \u201cHigher costs due to inflation is a cause of gradual price increases, but I wouldn\u2019t consider that gouging,\u201d he told CNN. Consumer protections Experts in pricing strategy warn that surprise increases can generate a backlash. \u201cPrice gouging is a subjective emotion of a consumer feeling that they are being taken advantage of by an unfairly high price,\u201d said Rafi Mohammed, who founded a pricing strategy consultancy firm called Culture of Profit. \u201cWhen setting a price, managers need to understand and anticipate that their prices will elicit emotional reactions ranging from \u2018that\u2019s cheap\u2019 to \u2018this is unfair.\u2019\u201d To avoid that, his philosophy has been to set prices in a manner that could elicit a response from customers along the lines of \u201cThank you! I looked around at various offerings and determined that your product and price offered me the best value.\u201d That said, if you do believe you\u2019re being price gouged, your state may be able to step in \u2014 as many did during the pandemic, even for goods like toilet paper, by capping prices. (Though Roberts\u2019 research suggests some anti-price gouging laws are to blame if you couldn\u2019t find toilet paper.) Still, Teresa Murray, director of the consumer watchdog division of US PIRG, a nonprofit consumer advocacy research group, wrote in a blog post that \u201cif you aren\u2019t sure whether a product is priced too high, it\u2019s better to report problematic items to the company and your attorney general.\u201d Perhaps state attorneys general should consider a special division dedicated to Swifties, too.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/18/business/price-gouging-explained/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "us"}}
