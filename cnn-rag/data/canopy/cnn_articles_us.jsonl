Kristi Noem as a \u201cterrific person\u201d when asked in an interview about the backflash she received over\u00a0revelations in her new book that she shot and killed\u00a0her 14-month-old dog. \u201cShe had a bad week. We all have bad weeks,\u201d Trump told radio hosts Clay Travis and Buck Sexton in an interview that aired Tuesday. \u201cCouple of rough stories, there\u2019s no question about it,\u201d the former president said.\u00a0\u201cUntil this week, she was doing incredibly well. And she got hit hard and sometimes you do books and you have some guy writing a book and you maybe don\u2019t read it as carefully, you know. You have ghost writers do it, they help you, and they, in this case, didn\u2019t help too much.\u201d Noem became the subject of intense criticism for disclosing in her new book, \u201cNo Going Back: The Truth on What\u2019s Wrong with Politics and How We Move America Forward\u201d that she shot and killed her dog, Cricket, because the puppy was \u201cuntrainable,\u201d \u201cdangerous\u201d and \u201cless than worthless \u2026 as a hunting dog.\u201d Noem also said in the book that President Joe Biden\u2019s dog Commander should suffer a similar fate to Cricket. Commander, Biden\u2019s German shepherd, has bitten Secret Service personnel in 24 separate incidents at the White House and other locations, according to CNN\u2019s reporting from February. The dog was\u00a0removed from the White House\u00a0in October. Controversy over the book also extended to other disclosures. For example, Noem falsely claimed that she once met North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un. The book\u2019s publisher announced earlier this month that the relevant passage would be removed in reprints. CNN previously reported that Noem had already fallen off Trump\u2019s vice presidential candidate shortlist long before the latest controversy began. Still, Noem is slated to attend a Tuesday fundraiser for Trump in Manhattan, which will include others said to be under running mate consideration. Trump\u2019s praise also comes amid escalating tensions between Noem and tribal leaders in South Dakota over her previous remarks about Native American communities. After Trump\u2019s interview aired, Biden campaign spokesperson James Singer said in a statement, \u201cAt the Biden campaign, we are proudly anti-puppy-killing and don\u2019t think those who murder puppies are \u2018terrific.\u2019\u201d This story and headline have been updated.

The suspect, identified by the Euclid Police Department as 24-year-old Deshawn Anthony Vaughn, was found dead inside a residence in Shaker Heights, Ohio, US Marshals spokesperson Peter J. Elliott said during a Sunday evening news conference. Shaker Heights is about 9 miles south of the city of Euclid, where the officer was killed. \u201cThe manhunt is now over,\u201d Elliott said. The suspect, who was considered \u201chighly armed,\u201d had fled on foot to Shaker Heights after the ambush on Saturday, authorities said. Officials did not confirm the manner of Vaughn\u2019s death during Sunday\u2019s news conference. Euclid police officer Jacob Derbin, 23, was shot Saturday as officers responded to a disturbance call at a home shortly before 10 p.m. in Euclid \u2013 about 12 miles north of Cleveland \u2013 the Euclid Police Department said in a news release. \u201cThe complainant stated that her child\u2019s father threatened to harm her and her mother,\u201d Euclid Police Chief Scott Meyer said during Sunday\u2019s news conference. The woman told responding officers the suspect was on foot and possibly nearby, according to Meyer. \u201cOfficers went to check the backyard and were ambushed by gunfire from the suspect,\u201d Meyer said. Derbin was shot and taken to the hospital but died of his injuries, authorities said. No other officers were injured. \u201cHis kind heart and enormous smile were infectious,\u201d Meyer said of Derbin, speaking with emotion. \u201cThe world was a better place with him in it and he will be desperately missed by all who knew him.\u201d Derbin, who was engaged and set to be married in July, was sworn into the department in last July. His father is also a Euclid police officer, according to Meyer. Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine ordered flags to be flown at half-staff to honor Derbin\u2019s life and service on Sunday. The United States and State of Ohio flags will remain in that position until sunset on the day of Derbin\u2019s funeral, according to an announcement from DeWine. \u201cThe Euclid Police Department asks that you keep the fallen officer, his family, loved ones and our agency in your thoughts and prayers,\u201d police said in a statement.

{"id": "2024_05_14_us_florida-farm-worker-bus-crash", "text": "The driver of a pickup truck involved in a Tuesday morning crash that killed eight farm workers and left at least 40 people injured in north-central Florida has been charged with eight counts of \u201cDriving Under the Influence - manslaughter,\u201d according to a news release from the\u00a0Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles. The 2010 International Bus carrying \u201capproximately 53 farm workers\u201d and a 2001 Ford Ranger sideswiped each other around 6:35 a.m., about 15 miles west of Ocala, the Florida Highway Patrol said in a statement. The Ford, \u201cfor unknown reasons, traveled toward the center line\u201d before the vehicles struck each other, Lt. Patrick Riordan of the Florida Highway Patrol said during a news conference at the scene. The bus then left the roadway, went through a fence and overturned. Bryan Maclean Howard, the driver of the Ford Ranger, was arrested Tuesday afternoon, Dave Kerner, the executive director of the highway safety department, said in a statement. CNN has not yet been able to determine if Howard has an attorney. Eight people are dead while 45 injured were taken to medical facilities, including eight in critical condition, James Lucas with Marion County Fire Rescue said earlier in the day. \u201cThere\u2019s a high probability this may be beyond eight fatalities,\u201d Riordan said, noting some of the injured, including the driver of the pickup truck, are in \u201cvery serious condition.\u201d \u201cIdentities of the deceased will be released pending next of kin notification,\u201d Kerner said in his statement. \u201cOur sympathies and prayers are with the families of the deceased. Consistent with our duties, the Florida Highway Patrol will conduct both a thorough and exhaustive traffic crash and criminal investigation.\u201d Footage captured by CNN affiliate WESH showed the bus \u2013 which Riordan said was taking the workers to a farm in the area \u2013 lying on its side in a field, with first responders\u2019 vehicles parked nearby, their lights flashing. Marion County Sheriff Billy Woods indicated authorities believe the bus passengers were migrant workers, telling reporters, \u201cWe\u2019re a very big agricultural county. So this time of year, we always have migrant workers that are in our county, that are on buses just like this.\u201d In a news conference Tuesday evening, Juan Sabines, the Mexican consul in Orlando, said the victims were all from Mexico and were in the United States on temporary agricultural worker visas. \u201cPlease pray for these nationals,\u201d Sabines said. \u201cWe hear a lot of bad things of the immigrants all the time, in the reality, these people (are) good people. (They are) very good people, young people.\u201d \u201cThey stay in this country just for work, with (a) visa,\u201d he added. \u201cThese (are) very good people and now they lost the main support of their family.\u201d Woods noted there were challenges with language barriers, but said bilingual sheriff\u2019s office personnel and support staff were assisting in the investigation. The National Transportation Safety Board is monitoring the situation, it said, and the US Department of Transportation\u2019s Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration similarly said it was aware of the crash. \u201cOur sincere thoughts are with the victims, their families, and the community as FMCSA assesses currently available information in support of state and local safety officials,\u201d an agency spokesperson said. Westbound lanes on Highway 40 will be closed \u201cfor most of the day,\u201d the Marion County Sheriff\u2019s Office said on its Facebook page, asking motorists to take alternate routes.

{"id": "2024_05_12_us_win-rozario-nypd-killing", "text": "\u201cPlease don\u2019t shoot,\u201d Notan Eva Costa, a 48-year-old Bangladeshi immigrant living in Queens, begged the two New York City police officers who entered her home after her teenage son called 911. Lying on the floor, the mother of two stretched her hand out to the officers, terror and distress audible in her voice. It was too late. One of the police officers fired his gun at least four times, fatally wounding 19-year-old Win Rozario. Less than two minutes had passed since police entered the family\u2019s home. The officers \u201ckilled my son in minutes,\u201d Costa said through an interpreter at a Wednesday news conference. \u201cBefore they came, everything was calm. Then they came and created chaos and murdered him in front of me.\u201d In the weeks since Rozario\u2019s death, the shooting has attracted scrutiny from social justice and mental health advocates, particularly after the state attorney general\u2019s office released footage from body cameras worn by the two responding officers and announced it is investigating the case. Critics say the police\u2019s use of lethal force was unnecessary and reflects a pattern of violence against people with mental illness. In a news release, the NYPD said it is \u201cfully cooperating\u201d with the investigation as well as conducting its own probe, adding, \u201cWe continually seek to improve how we respond to requests for assistance, and we acknowledge that there is much work to be done. New Yorkers expect and deserve nothing less.\u201d The two officers are on \u201cmodified assignment,\u201d meaning they\u2019re still working but not carrying firearms or shields. Rozario\u2019s family, as well as local organizations like the Justice Committee and Desis Rising Up and Moving, have called for the officers to be fired and prosecuted. They also have goals far beyond penalizing the officers who killed Rozario. They\u2019re calling for New York City to radically shift its approach to responding to people in crisis. Rather than sending armed police officers to respond to every 911 call, they envision a world where trained mental health responders could respond to people experiencing crises, helping to deescalate tense situations and connect patients with health care. Mental health crisis intervention programs have already been implemented in cities like Eugene, Oregon, and Denver, Colorado, as well as across 23 counties in South Dakota and elsewhere across the country. In New York, a similar but limited pilot program called \u201cB-Heard\u201d dispatches EMTs and trained mental health responders to some emergency calls. Speaking through a translator in front of dozens of supporters holding images of Rozario, his mother described her son as a \u201cquiet and polite\u201d teenager who dreamed of one day joining the military \u201cbecause he wanted to do something for this country.\u201d He loved to cook for his mother and help her with her beading handicrafts, she recalled. \u201cThat is who the police stole from us,\u201d she said, tearing up at times as she described her son. \u201cI tried to protect my son. I begged the police not to shoot, but the police still killed him.\u201d \u201cWin Rozario would be alive today if the NYPD had already been removed from mental health,\u201d said Loyda Col\u00f3n, executive director of the Justice Committee, at a Wednesday news conference. 2 minutes, 4 gunshots, and a young life cut short Rozario was in the throes of an apparent mental health crisis when he called 911 on March 27. \u201cHe\u2019s having an episode,\u201d his younger brother, Utsho, told the two police officers who arrived. \u201cHe don\u2019t even know what he\u2019s doing, to be honest.\u201d In the apartment, the officers found Rozario standing in the kitchen with his mother nearby. When an officer moved toward the kitchen, Rozario seemed to become distressed and picked up a pair of kitchen scissors, which his mother tried to take from his hand. Rozario moved toward the officers again with the scissors, prompting one officer to fire a taser at him and the other to draw his gun. Rozario\u2019s mother clutched him as an officer shouted, \u201clet go of him and back up,\u201d and appeared to fire a taser again at the teenager, who collapsed to the floor. Rozario\u2019s mother then moved away from him and toward officers, holding the scissors. She walked back to Rozario, seemingly trying to comfort him, prompting an officer to yell, \u201cTell her to get the f**k out of the way!\u201d  \u201cDon\u2019t shoot,\u201d she said to the officers. An officer again fired a taser at Rozario, who grabbed the scissors and again moved toward the officers. Utsho moved in and all three family members held each other as the officers continued to shout for them to get out of the way. Rozario\u2019s mother and brother both fell to the floor. Rozario was standing and holding the scissors, seemingly several feet away from the officers, when one officer appeared to begin shooting at him. He fell to the floor after multiple shots. Col\u00f3n said the footage shows the responding officers \u201crecklessly escalated the situation multiple times,\u201d endangering Rozario\u2019s mother and brother as well. \u201cThey had multiple opportunities to de-escalate, to detain, and they did not do that,\u201d Col\u00f3n said. Officers shouted \u201cput it down\u201d multiple times at Rozario but did not otherwise talk to him during the body camera footage. \u201cThere was no danger happening at all, until those officers arrived with their guns,\u201d the family\u2019s attorney said at the news conference. Michael Alcazar, a retired NYPD detective and adjunct professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, told CNN he saw multiple ways the officers could have possibly avoided shooting Rozario. Before entering the home or when Rozario\u2019s mother took the scissors from him, they could have asked his mother and brother to leave the apartment, leaving just Rozario inside, and then called emergency services. This is consistent with the \u201cisolate and contain\u201d protocol NYPD advises officers to use when dealing with \u201cmentally ill or emotionally disturbed persons.\u201d Additionally, the officers could have used nonlethal weapons, like nightsticks, to gain control of Rozario and take the scissors away, according to Alcazar. Another vision for crisis intervention Rozario wasn\u2019t the first New Yorker to die at the hands of police while experiencing a mental health crisis. Community Access, a non-profit supporting people with mental health concerns in New York, says at least 26 New Yorkers experiencing mental health crises have been shot and killed by police since 2007. Situations involving \u201cemotionally disturbed persons\u201d are the second most common situation in which police officers use force, according to the NYPD\u2019s 2022 use of force report. Officers used force in 1,740 encounters with emotionally disturbed persons in 2022, the report showed. The report does not include data on lethal force used against emotionally disturbed persons. The NYPD told CNN they respond to approximately 155,000 \u201cemergency calls involving people in the throes of an emotional or mental health crisis\u201d each year. Fewer than 1% of those calls result in police using any form of force and fewer involve deadly force, the NYPD reports. Although they are uncommon, deaths like those of Rozario, Kawaski Trawick, Deborah Danner, and Mohamed Bah have drawn scrutiny to the dangers of using police to respond to people experiencing acute crisis, and what an alternative system of support might look like. In Eugene and Springfield, Oregon, for instance, specialized crisis responders and medics have responded to crisis calls for more than 30 years through a mobile intervention program called CAHOOTS, an acronym for \u201cCrisis Assistance Helping Out On The Streets.\u201d The program diverts between 3% and 8% of calls which would otherwise be handled by police, according to the Eugene Police Department, including providing care for people who are \u201cintoxicated, mentally ill, or disoriented.\u201d Jeremy Gates, the executive director of the White Bird Clinic, which runs CAHOOTS, told CNN part of the program\u2019s success lies in the trust its responders have built with clients over the years. \u201cPeople will call and say, I don\u2019t want the police, I want CAHOOTS,\u201d he said. And in Colorado, one former deputy was convicted of reckless endangerment, another pleaded guilty to two misdemeanors and six other officers are currently facing charges for shooting and killing a man experiencing a mental health crisis, a similar program called Support Team Assisted Response, known as STAR, operates in Denver. \u201cWe respond in a trauma-informed and empathetic manner,\u201d STAR Program Specialist Evan Thompkins told CNN in an interview. \u201cWe come in a kind and caring way, where we can kind of meet people where they\u2019re at, really get down on their level and provide more of a non-authoritarian approach.\u201d He noted for some people and communities, just the presence of uniformed police members can cause a situation to \u201cescalate.\u201d Some \u201ccommunities are afraid of the police and don\u2019t want to interact with the police,\u201d he said. Fountain House, a non-profit providing support for people living with serious mental illness in New York, has also highlighted Rozario\u2019s death to call for a vast expansion of the city\u2019s mental health intervention programs. Mental illness is primarily \u201ca public health issue, not a public safety issue,\u201d Arvind Sooknanan, a member of the board of directors at Fountain House, told CNN. The organization has laid out a plan for New York to \u201cmove as many mental health crisis calls as possible out of the 911 system\u201d and integrate the existing 988 mental health hotline \u201cwith the social service system to help people address root cause stressors.\u201d For Sooknanan, Rozario\u2019s case hits particularly close to home: Sooknanan has been living with serious mental illness since he was 15 and also comes from a South Asian background, like Rozario. The case \u201chas eaten away at me the past few weeks,\u201d he said. \u201cHe was only 19 years old. There was no reason for him to die.\u201d \u201cI want other people to have the same opportunities I did, to move forward with their lives, to find meaning, to find community,\u201d said Sooknanan, who is also working to help develop crisis intervention programs in other states. Ken Zimmerman, Fountain House\u2019s CEO, told CNN he envisions a future in which \u201cthe knowledge and awareness of what serious mental health conditions are is so much more widespread, that the kind of stigma and fear that drives so much is hugely diminished.\u201d Additionally, he emphasized the importance of expanding the city\u2019s resources and infrastructure for mental health care \u2013 a process that might take years. And those resources and planning need to take into account the lived experience of people living with serious mental illnesses themselves, he said. For the Rozario family, the fight to provide an alternative to police response for people in mental health crisis is powered by a dream that no other family should have to experience the anguish they\u2019ve felt. \u201cNo mother should have to go through the pain I\u2019m going through,\u201d Rozario\u2019s mother said. \u201cI hope no other mothers go through this in the future.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/12/us/win-rozario-nypd-killing/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "us"}}

{"id": "2024_05_11_us_missing-korean-war-soldier-identified", "text": "Sub-zero temperatures. Frigid winds. Snow falling across a \u201ctundra-like\u201d plain. These were the conditions soldiers faced in the Battle of the Chosin Reservoir. For some 17 days in late 1950, they fought through blistering cold in the North Korean mountains. With limited logistics and no hope of reinforcement, 30,000 UN soldiers faced over 120,000 Chinese troops in a battle considered one of the most brutal of the Korean War. There among the Americans was 19-year-old Cpl. John Albert Spruell, a son and brother from Cortez, Colorado. His unit \u2013 Battery B, 57th Field Artillery Battalion, 7th Infantry Division \u2013 went into combat near\u00a0the village of Hagaru-ri at the reservoir\u2019s edge. The fighting and the cold killed hundreds. Many others \u2013 as after US military clashes across the world for centuries \u2013 were deemed unaccounted for. When the horrors at the Chosin Reservoir had waned, the teenage warrior from Colorado was not recorded among the fallen. But nor was there evidence Spruell been taken prisoner, the Army said. So, on December 6, 1950, the branch issued its finding: \u201cMissing In Action.\u201d Back home in Cortez, Spruell\u2019s family was left to wonder what had happened to their soldier. His mother, Pauline Sleeper, probably didn\u2019t want to admit what her relatives decades later would say she almost certainly knew even then: Her child was dead. Still, though, she and her family had nothing to bury. A lack of proof and a mother\u2019s faith Soon after the war, the opposing nations embarked on Operation Glory, a 1954 exchange of thousands of sets of remains of Korean War dead. Among those recovered was one reportedly found near where the 57th\u00a0Field Artillery had fought at the Chosin Reservoir. A \u201ctentative association\u201d was made between the set and Spruell, the US Defense Department\u2019s Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency said. But there was no definitive proof. So, like all the others, the set of remains was given a code \u2013 Unknown X-15754 \u2013 sent to Honolulu and buried at the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific, often called the Punchbowl because it lies in an extinct volcano, the agency said. Spruell\u2019s name also was recorded, it said, at the cemetery\u2019s Courts of the Missing, where the names of 8,210 Americans lost in the Korean War were listed when it was dedicated in 1966. In time, the lost corporal\u2019s family moved forward. His eldest brother had a family of his own, naming one of his sons after his sibling who never came home from Korea. But the brother rarely spoke of the young man last seen halfway around the world near the Chosin Reservoir, said another one of his children, Dennis Spruell. \u201cI didn\u2019t hardly know anything about my uncle,\u201d Dennis Spruell said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t talk about it.\u201d But Sleeper never gave up on the hope her son lost in the war would return, said Dennis\u2019 cousin, Donna Lee Bailey, who was born after John Spruell last was seen on the battlefield. \u201cHis mother,\u201d she told CNN, \u201calways said he would come home.\u201d A DNA specimen and a fated phone call The Army, all the while, had Spruell listed as missing. And in its ongoing effort to close such cases, it had reached out to Dennis Spruell, he told CNN, for a sample of his DNA, which thanks to developments in science had become key to unlocking all kinds of mysteries long gone cold. Meantime, the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency in the summer of 2018 proposed disinterring 652 Korean War Unknowns buried at the Punchbowl to try again to identify them and return them to their families. The agency since 1982 has identified over 450 Americans killed in the Korean War, along with the initial 2,000 whose remains were returned at the war\u2019s close, it said, as over 7,500 US soldiers from the conflict remain unaccounted for. Three years passed before the agency could unearth the remains designated X-15754 and send them\u00a0to a laboratory for analysis. Nearly 70 years after they were sent back from the Chosin Reservoir zone, scientists used dental, anthropological, chest radiographs/x-rays \u2013 and DNA \u2013 to test the Unknown X-15754\u00a0specimens. Then last August, the agency made a positive ID. More recently, it called Dennis Spruell with the news. The remains known for decades only as X-15754 were what the tentative link had suggested: those of his uncle, Cpl. John A. Spruell. And now, Bailey said, \u201che\u2019s coming home.\u201d While most of Spruell\u2019s closest relatives have passed away, his childhood friend, Charles Haley, is still alive. He recalls Spruell didn\u2019t enroll for their senior year in high school. \u201cEverybody said, \u2018Well, he joined the Army\u2019 and that was kind of the end of it because we never heard any more,\u201d said Haley, who later joined the Army as well and was stationed in Japan. He remembers being silly with his friend as a kid, often playing pranks. Haley has also always made sure there was a flag on the headstone honoring Spruell in Cortez cemetery, switching them out when one got tattered or disappeared. \u201cTo suddenly find out that they identified the body and that they\u2019re going to be able to have a service. I know his folks are both gone,\u201d he said. \u201cI think is a real great relief to know that they know what happened to him.\u201d The makings of a mother and child reunion \u201cWhat the Army has done is gone above and beyond anything I could have ever imagined to honor a (lost) soldier,\u201d Dennis Spruell told CNN. Spruell\u2019s remains soon will be buried in Cortez, Colorado, the MIA/POW agency and his family said. A rosette will be placed next to his name at the Courts of the Missing to show he has been accounted for. And he finally will get the military decorations he\u2019s due, including the Purple Heart, US Army Mortuary Affairs Officer James Bell told CNN. The confirmation of John Spruell\u2019s remains, of course, is also bittersweet: \u201cI am sad that (his) siblings, which were my aunts and uncles and dad, did not survive long enough to know his history,\u201d Bailey said. Though Sleeper has died, a relative has her ashes. And with her warrior son\u2019s remains finally headed back home, the stage is set for the reunion his mother always knew would come. \u201cThey\u2019re hoping,\u201d Bailey said, \u201cto be able to bury them together.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/11/us/missing-korean-war-soldier-identified/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "us"}}

Bob Menendez will not allow a psychiatrist to testify at trial about a condition his defense attorneys say could explain the hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash investigators found during a raid of the New Jersey Democrat\u2019s home. The judge, Sidney Stein, made several rulings on witnesses Tuesday as testimony is expected to kick off in federal court in New York later this week. After two days of jury selection, Stein told the defense teams and prosecutors that he expects a jury to be selected and sworn in by the end of Wednesday morning, with opening statements beginning that afternoon. Prosecutors will present their case first, followed by the defense. Menendez is accused of taking bribes, including gold bars, cash and a luxury car, while acting as an agent of a foreign government. He\u2019s standing trial with two co-defendants, New Jersey businessmen Wael Hana and Fred Daibes. Menendez\u2019s wife, Nadine, has also been charged but will be tried separately. All four have pleaded not guilty.

{"id": "2024_05_14_business_boeing-justice-department-criminal-prosecution", "text": "The US Justice Department on Tuesday notified Boeing that it breached terms of\u00a0its\u00a02021 agreement in which the company avoided criminal charges for two fatal 737 Max crashes. After a series of safety missteps earlier this year, including a door plug that blew off an Alaska Airlines flight shortly after takeoff in January, the Department of Justice said Boeing is now subject to criminal prosecution. \u201cFor failing to fulfill completely the terms of and obligations under the [deferred prosecution agreement], Boeing is subject to prosecution by the United States for any federal criminal violation of which the United States has knowledge,\u201d the Justice Department said in a letter to US District Judge Reed O\u2019Connor in Fort Worth, Texas, who oversaw the prior agreement. The Biden administration said in its letter that it has not yet determined how it will proceed, however, and Boeing will have an opportunity to respond to its breach of the agreement \u2013 and steps it has taken to remediate the situation \u2013 by June 13. It will let the court know by July 7 how it will proceed with the case. The notification comes as the Justice Department conducts a new investigation into Boeing\u2019s operations in the wake the door plug incident. The earlier deal had resolved a fraud investigation related to the company\u2019s development of its 737 Max aircraft. Under its deferred prosecution agreement from January 2021, Boeing paid $2.5 billion in penalties and promised to improve its safety and compliance protocols. Families of victims of the October 2018 Lion Air 737 Max crash and the March 2019 Ethiopian Airlines 737 Max crash had long denounced the delayed prosecution agreement, arguing it denied them justice for the deaths of their loved ones. Families of victims and lawyers representing them met with the Justice Department late last month to persuade the Biden administration to end the agreement in light of multiple safety lapses at Boeing this year and in past years after the 2021 agreement was reached. Following the April 2024 meeting, attorney Paul Cassell, who represents the victims\u2019 families, said at a press conference that the deferred prosecution agreement was \u201crigged\u201d and brokered without families\u2019 say. Cassell pledged to hold Boeing accountable for its \u201cfraud and misconduct.\u201d On Tuesday, Cassell said, \u201cThis is a positive first step, and for the families, a long time coming. But we need to see further action from DOJ to hold Boeing accountable, and plan to use our meeting on May 31 to explain in more detail what we believe would be a satisfactory remedy to Boeing\u2019s ongoing criminal conduct.\u201d The Justice Department in its letter said it notified the families that Boeing breached its agreement, and it will continue to confer with families of the crash victims as well as other airline customers about next steps. The Department of Justice plans to meet with the families next on May 31. In Thursday\u2019s letter to the federal judge overseeing the prior agreement, the Justice Department said it had notified the company that \u201cthe government has determined that Boeing breached its obligations\u201d in multiple parts of the 2021 deal \u201cby failing to design, implement, and enforce a compliance and ethics program to prevent and detect violations of the U.S. fraud laws throughout its operations.\u201d Boeing safety issues following its agreement Despite pledging to clean up its act, Boeing had a seemingly endless run of quality and safety lapses in the years since its deferred prosecution agreement. On September 20, 2021, just months after its agreement, Boeing disclosed it found\u00a0empty tequila bottles\u00a0inside one of the two 747 jets being refurbished for use as the next generation of Air Force One. In April 2023, Boeing announced its supplier used a \u201cnon-standard manufacturing process,\u201d delaying deliveries of the 737 Max. In February 2024, a month after the door plug incident, a preliminary National Transportation Safety Board investigation found that the plane left a Boeing factory missing the four bolts needed to secure the door plug. Later that month, the Federal Aviation Administration issued a report sharply\u00a0critical of the culture\u00a0at Boeing, citing \u201cgaps in Boeing\u2019s safety journey,\u201d and gave Boeing 90 days\u00a0to come up with a plan to fix its problems. Subsequent FAA reports found multiple problems\u00a0with Boeing\u2019s production practices following a six-week audit. In March, the FAA identified more\u00a0potential safety issues\u00a0with the engines of the 737 Max and 787 Dreamliner. Last month, the FAA announced an investigation into\u00a0a whistleblower\u2019s complaint\u00a0that the company took shortcuts when manufacturing its 777 and 787 Dreamliner jets and that those risks could become catastrophic as the airplanes age. The company disputed the complaint.

{"id": "2024_05_14_tech_google-ai-gmail-photos-developers-conference", "text": "A day after OpenAI impressed with a startlingly improved ChatGPT AI model, Google showed off an equally stunning vision for how AI will improve the products that billions of people use every day. The updates, announced at its annual Google I/O developer conference, come as the company is trying to push beyond its core advertising business with new devices and AI-powered tools. Artificial intelligence was so top of mind during the event, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said at the end of the presentation the term \u201cAI\u201d was said 120 times \u2013 as counted by none other than its AI platform Gemini. During the keynote, Google showed how it wants its AI products to become a bigger part of users\u2019 lives, such as by sharing information, interacting with others, finding objects around the house, making schedules, shopping and using an Android device. Google essentially wants its AI to be part of everything you do. Pichai kicked off the event by highlighting various new features powered by its latest AI model Gemini 1.5 Pro. One new feature, called Ask Photos, allows users to search photos for deeper insights, such as asking when your daughter learned to swim or recall what your license plate number is, by looking through saved pictures. He also showed how users can ask Gemini 1.5 Pro to summarize all recent emails from your child\u2019s school by analyzing attachments, and summarizing key points and spitting out action items. Meanwhile, Google executives took turns demonstrating other capabilities, such as how the latest model could \u201cread\u201d a textbook and turn it into a kind of AI lecture featuring natural-sounding teachers that answer questions. Just one day before, OpenAI \u2014 one of the tech industry\u2019s leaders in artificial intelligence \u2014 unveiled a new AI model that it says will make chatbot ChatGPT smarter and easier to use. GPT-4o aims to turn ChatGPT into a digital personal assistant that can engage in real-time, spoken conversations and interact using text and \u201cvision.\u201d It can view screenshots, photos, documents or charts uploaded by users and have a conversation about them. Google also showed off Gemini\u2019s latest abilities to take different kinds of input \u2014 \u201cmultimodal\u201d capabilities to take in text, voice or images \u2014 as a direct response to ChatGPT\u2019s efforts. A Google executive also demoed a virtual \u201cteammate\u201d that can help stay on top of to-do lists, organize data and manage workflow. The company also highlighted search improvements by allowing users to ask more natural or more focused questions, and providing various versions of the responses, such as in-depth or summarized results. It can also make targeted suggestions, such as recommending kid friendly restaurants in certain locations, or note what might be wrong with a gadget, such as a camera, by taking a video of the issue via Google Lens. The goal is to take the legwork out of searching on Google, the company said. The company also briefly teased Project Astra, developed by Google\u2019s DeepMind AI lab, which will allow AI assistants to help users\u2019 everyday lives by using phone cameras to interpret information about the real world, such as identifying objects and even finding misplaced items. It also hinted at how it would work on augmented reality glasses. Google said that later this year it will integrate more AI functions into phones. For example, users will be able to drag and drop images created by AI into Google Messages and Gmail and ask questions about YouTube videos and PDFs on an Android device. And in a move that will likely appeal to many, a new built-in tool for Android will help detect suspicious activity in the middle of a call, such as a scammer trying to imitate a user\u2019s bank. According to analyst Jacob Bourne, from market research firm Emarketer, it\u2019s no surprise AI took center stage at this year\u2019s Google developer conference. \u201cBy showcasing its latest models and how they\u2019ll power existing products with strong consumer reach, Google is demonstrating how it can effectively differentiate itself from rivals,\u201d he said. He believes the reception of the new tools will be an indicator of how well Google can adapt its search product to meet the demands of the generative AI era. \u201cTo maintain its competitive edge and satisfy investors, Google will need to focus on translating its AI innovations into profitable products and services at scale,\u201d he said. As the company grows its AI footprint, it said it will introduce more protections to cut down on potential misuse. Google is expanding its existing SynthID feature to detect AI-generated content. Last year, the tool added watermarks to AI-generated images and audio. Google said it is also partnering with experts and institutions to test and improve the capabilities in its new models. Although the company has doubled down on artificial intelligence in the past year, it also met significant roadblocks. Last year, shortly after introducing its generative AI tool \u2014 then called Bard and since renamed Gemini \u2014 Google\u2019s share price dropped after a demo video of the tool showed it producing a factually inaccurate response to a question about the James Webb Space Telescope. More recently, the company hit pause in February on Gemini\u2019s ability to generate images of people after it was blasted on social media for producing historically inaccurate images that largely showed people of color in place of White people. Gemini, like other AI tools such as ChatGPT, is trained on vast troves of online data. Experts have long warned about the shortcomings around AI tools, such as the potential for inaccuracies, biases and the spreading of misinformation. Still, many companies are forging ahead on AI tools or partnerships. Apple may be interested in licensing and building Google\u2019s Gemini AI engine, which includes chatbots and other AI tools, into upcoming iPhones and its iOS 18 features, Bloomberg reported in March. The company is also reportedly talking to ChatGPT creator OpenAI.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/14/tech/google-ai-gmail-photos-developers-conference/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "us"}}

{"id": "2024_05_12_us_baltimore-bridge-collapse-demolition-ship", "text": "The planned demolition to remove a portion of the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Maryland has been rescheduled to Monday afternoon due to inclement weather conditions, according to the United States Coast Guard. Crews were expected Sunday evening to use small explosives to break apart a massive chunk of the Baltimore bridge that collapsed on a cargo ship six weeks ago after the US Coast Guard previously pushed back the controlled demolition by an hour. The operation was originally to take place Saturday, but officials on Friday announced it would be postponed due to an adverse weather forecast. The explosion is now slated to take place at 5 p.m. ET on Monday, according to the Coast Guard. The planned demolition is aimed at helping officials remove debris and ultimately free the 213-million-pound Dali cargo ship, which veered off course March 26 and struck a pillar of the Francis Scott Key Bridge, causing it to fall into the water below. The collapse killed six construction workers and destroyed a key thoroughfare, threatening the economy at the Port of Baltimore. Sunday\u2019s weather in the Baltimore area \u2013 which included lightning strikes \u2013 is what led officials to hold off on the demolition. \u201cWe were all set to do the precision cuts \u2026 today,\u201d Nick Ameen with the US Coast Guard told reporters Sunday. \u201cThere\u2019s several factors, environmental factors among them, that have unfortunately pushed that event until tomorrow.\u201d Ameen called the process a \u201cdynamic\u201d one and said, \u201cWe will absolutely not sacrifice safety for speed.\u201d He added: \u201cWhenever there\u2019s a lightning strike in the area, that pushes the clock back, and so that clock just kept getting pushed back and pushed back.\u201d Officials last week recovered the sixth and final body, allowing them to proceed with the plan to free the Dali. If the operation succeeds this weekend, the ship could be refloated and returned to the Port of Baltimore as soon as this week, The Baltimore Sun\u00a0and CNN affiliate\u00a0WBAL\u00a0previously reported. \u201cThe safest and swiftest method to remove the bridge piece from on top of the M/V Dali is by precision cuts made with small charges,\u201d the Key Bridge Response Unified Command said in a news release last week. \u201cThis is an industry-standard tool in controlled demolition that will break the span into smaller pieces,\u201d it added, \u201cwhich will allow the work of refloating the vessel and removing it from the federal channel.\u201d According to an infographic from the US Army and the US Army Corps of Engineers, the process will \u201clook like multiple puffs of smoke and sound like fireworks.\u201d Nearby communities should receive a \u201ccellular notification\u201d beforehand, according to\u00a0Unified Command, which includes\u00a0state and federal authorities, the US Coast Guard and Army Corps of Engineers among them. The 21 members of the ship\u2019s crew \u2013 who have not left the ship since it struck the bridge in late March \u2013 will remain onboard during the operation, according to Darrel Wilson, a spokesperson for Synergy Marine Group, which manages the Dali. \u201cThey will have a safe place on the vessel where they can shelter during the controlled explosion,\u201d Wilson said, adding that the crew was \u201cholding up well\u201d despite the stress of recent weeks. \u201cEven though they are not sailing, they are still performing\u00a0their normal crew duties,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cThis is still a large, complicated piece of equipment and there is a lot they have to look after.\u201d While the Dali\u2019s management company has tried to support the crew on board, members of Baltimore\u2019s seafaring community remain concerned for their wellbeing given the length of time they\u2019ve been aboard the ship. Rev. Josh Messick, executive director of the Baltimore International Seafarers\u2019 Center, told CNN the crew is well taken care of but feels disconnected from the rest of the world. They have internet access, thanks to hotspots Messick\u2019s group helped deliver, but they do not have their cellphones, which were confiscated by authorities as part of the investigation. \u201cThey are a little anxious because of the phone situation. We are trying to get their cellphones back to them,\u201d Messick said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just a phone, they can\u2019t access their online banking, their finances, their contacts, they can\u2019t look at photos of their loved ones before they go to sleep at night. It\u2019s a lot more than just a phone.\u201d In the meantime, several investigations continue into the cause of the disaster and who is responsible. The House Committee on Transportation & Infrastructure\u00a0plans to hold a hearing Wednesday\u00a0on the catastrophe, with testimony expected from the chair of the National Transportation Safety Board and officials from the Coast Guard, Army Corps of Engineers and the US Department of Transportation.

{"id": "2024_05_14_us_baltimore-bridge-collapse-ntsb-report", "text": "The cargo ship Dali that crashed into Baltimore\u2019s Key Bridge in March had a pair of catastrophic electrical failures minutes before the crash and had experienced two blackouts a day earlier, according to a preliminary report released Tuesday by the National Transportation Safety Board. The 24-page report details investigators\u2019 early factual findings on the March 26 disaster that took down the 1.6-mile long steel structure, killing six construction workers on the bridge and severing access to critical shipping routes in and out of the Port of Baltimore. According to the report, the two power outages occurred three ships\u2019 lengths from the bridge and were\u00a0triggered by the tripping of two critical circuit breakers, which\u00a0caused several pumps required for the ship\u2019s single propeller and its single rudder to stop working. The emergency generator was not configured to power the ship, the report said. The ship at the time of the failure was under the control of an apprentice pilot, who was accompanied by a senior pilot. When the pilots boarded, the captain reported the ship was in good working order, according to the report. NTSB investigators said the crewmembers tested negative for drugs and alcohol, and the fuel tested negative for contaminants three times. About 10 hours earlier, while the ship was still moored in the Port of Baltimore, it experienced two onboard blackouts, one caused by a crew error, according to the report. \u201cThe NTSB is still investigating the electrical configuration following the first in-port blackout and potential impacts on the events during the accident voyage,\u201d the report states. The FBI and Coast Guard are looking into whether the crew failed to report the\u00a0in-port power outage as part of a criminal investigation, according to a US official familiar with the matter. An NTSB preliminary report does not conclude a probable cause. Those findings will be part of a final report that could take investigators up to two years to complete. The report notes several areas that are still being investigated, including \u201cthe design and operation of the Dali\u2019s power distribution system (including its breakers).\u201d The report took 49 days to publish, longer than the typical month it takes for the agency\u2019s investigators to publish such a report. On Wednesday, NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy will testify on the bridge collapse before the House Committee on Transportation & Infrastructure. Other witnesses include officials from the US Coast Guard and the Army Corps of Engineers.  6 workers died, and others narrowly escaped The ship, weighing about 213 million pounds, had lost engine and electrical power shortly before hitting the bridge, officials said. Video footage from moments before the crash showed plumes of black smoke coming from the vessel as well as the lights flickering on and off, likely due to an emergency generator activating after an initial blackout. Six construction workers\u00a0who were filling potholes on the bridge were killed in the disaster. The victims were immigrants from El Salvador, Mexico, Guatemala and Honduras who worked to support their families. The NTSB report details the near-catastrophic experiences of a crew member on the ship and a road maintenance inspector on the bridge. The crew member was on the bow of the ship at the time of the crash. \u201c(He) told investigators that, as he was releasing the brake on the port anchor, he had to escape from the falling bridge before he was able to reapply the brake,\u201d the report states. The inspector on the bridge had been walking the span when the ship struck. \u201cHe ran north and made it to the nearest surviving span before the rest of the bridge collapsed,\u201d the report states. The bridge\u2019s collapse also has strangled the regional infrastructure. The wreckage of the bridge has clogged the port, a major shipping channel for the sugar and automotive industries. In addition, the Key Bridge was a critical thoroughfare, with 30,000 commuters relying on it every day, Maryland Gov. Wes Moore said. Officials have vowed to rebuild the bridge \u2013 but the exact cost remains unclear. A spokesperson for the Insurance Information Institute has estimated the bridge alone could be worth more than $1.2 billion. President Joe Biden has said he\u2019s committed to helping rebuild the bridge as soon as possible and said the federal government will bear the costs. Multiple investigations are underway to try to determine who might be responsible for the catastrophe. Last month, Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott announced a probe \u201cto hold the wrongdoers responsible and to mitigate the immediate and long-term harm\u201d to residents. The ship\u2019s Singaporean owner, Grace Ocean Private Limited, and manager, Synergy Marine PTE LTD, filed a petition in federal court last month asking for a $43.6 million limit on potential liability payouts. The city of Baltimore has asked the court to deny that request. It also filed a legal claim against Grace Ocean and Synergy Marine, accusing both companies of having an \u201cincompetent crew\u201d aboard the Dali that lacked proper skill and training, Darrell Wilson, a spokesperson for the ship\u2019s owner and manager, declined to comment to CNN \u201cout of respect for the ongoing investigations and any future legal proceedings.\u201d This is a developing story and will be updated.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/14/us/baltimore-bridge-collapse-ntsb-report/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "us"}}

Sanford is about 20 miles north of Orlando. A judge moved the suspect, Christopher Bouie Jr., from juvenile to adult circuit court on Monday, according to a news release from the Office of the State Attorney for the 18th\u00a0Judicial Circuit. Bouie is charged with five counts of attempted second-degree murder while discharging a firearm and one count of possession of a firearm by a minor in connection with the shooting, court records show. Lemma said nine of the 10 people who were shot have been released from the hospital with minor wounds. The last victim should be released soon, he said. Investigators believe the juvenile pulled out a 9mm handgun following a physical altercation and began firing, according to the sheriff. The search continues for a second person who may have fired in self-defense, Lemma said. \u201cSo what we have is two people engaged in gunfire on the left and right side of the physical altercation that is going on,\u201d he said. The state attorney said Tuesday an investigation into additional shots fired by another patron of the club is \u201cactive and ongoing.\u201d Bouie was transferred to the Seminole County Jail and will be held without bond, the release said. His first appearance in Seminole County Court is scheduled for Tuesday afternoon, according to court records. CNN has reached out to Bouie\u2019s attorney for comment. Lemma said the actions of a security guard who tackled the suspect to the ground and turned him in to\u00a0police \u201ctook a very dangerous situation and made it less significant than what the potential could have been.\u201d About 200 people were at the event, including Dell, who was invited by promoters. It was being held at Cabana Live, which is open to the public as a restaurant and bar. The venue also is leased out for private events and parties, the sheriff said. Promoters had 10 armed security members on site. The sheriff said he does not know how the suspect made it into the party, and the investigation is ongoing. He added the gun recovered was legally purchased\u00a0in Miami in 2018, but does not know how the teen allegedly obtained it.

Harvard\u00a0has agreed to hold reinstatement proceedings \u201cfor the over 20 students and student workers suspended by the University for their alleged participation in the encampment,\u201d the group said. For 60 students and student workers facing disciplinary procedures, the university has agreed to expedite their cases \u201cin line with precedents of leniency for similar actions in the past,\u201d according to\u00a0Harvard\u00a0Out of Occupied Palestine (HOOP), the organization behind the encampment. The agreement \u2013 which the Harvard Jewish Alumni Alliance described as an example of \u201cmis-governance\u201d by the university \u2013 comes as college officials around the country have called in law enforcement to clear pro-Palestinian encampments and quell demonstrations in recent weeks. Alan Garber, Harvard\u2019s interim president, in a message to the university community, said he has asked schools to \u201cpromptly initiate applicable reinstatement proceedings for all individuals who have been placed on involuntary leaves of absence.\u201d Garber did not say how many students were involved. Garber also said he has asked the \u201cdisciplinary boards within each School to evaluate expeditiously, according to their existing practices and precedents, the cases of those who participated in the encampment.\u201d Garber \u201cwill ask the schools to adjudicate disciplinary matters promptly,\u201d according to a university spokesperson, adding that he will also request that reinstatement requests be processed expeditiously. Harvard University has 12 graduate and professional schools, the undergraduate Harvard College, and the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study. HOOP said the university will meet with the protesters \u201cto begin discussions on disclosure, divestment, and reinvestment.\u201d\u00a0Harvard\u00a0will also engage in conversations about creating a \u201cCenter for Palestine Studies at\u00a0Harvard,\u201d the group said. Garber said he will \u201cfacilitate a meeting with the chair of the Corporation Committee on Shareholder Responsibility and other University officials to address questions about the endowment.\u201d The Harvard Crimson reported May 6 that Garber has repeatedly stated that the endowment will not be used as a tool for political means. The university has also repeatedly stated its position resisting calls for divestment. The university president and the dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences will also meet with students \u201cto hear their perspectives on academic matters related to longstanding conflicts in the Middle East,\u201d according to Garber\u2019s message. \u201cI acknowledge the profound grief that many in our community feel over the tragic effects of the ongoing war,\u201d Garber said. \u201cThere will continue to be deep disagreements and strongly felt emotions as we experience pain and distress over events in the wider world.\u201d The encampment at the Cambridge,\u00a0Massachusetts, campus lasted 20 days, according to the group. Harvard began placing students connected to the encampment on \u201cinvoluntary\u201d leaves of absence, the Harvard Crimson\u00a0reported\u00a0Friday, citing an Instagram post\u00a0from HOOP. The move came after protesters\u00a0rejected an offer\u00a0from Garber to avoid being placed on leave in exchange for taking down the encampment. The Harvard Jewish Alumni Alliance, in a message to members, described the agreement as \u201cgross mis-governance\u201d that \u201cundermines the stated mission\u201d of the university. The group accused the interim president of \u201cgiving preferential treatment to students, faculty and staff whose conduct not only targeted Jews but also disrupted and imperiled the wider Harvard community.\u201d The alumni alliance urged members to withhold donations to Harvard, and join a campaign to \u201cdonate one dollar, and no more, to the University for the foreseeable future \u2014 not in anger, but in sadness and in hope.\u201d The Ivy League school has experienced a period of historic turmoil in recent months.

He will face the winner of a three-way Democratic primary. The West Virginia Senate seat\u00a0has long been seen as the most likely\u00a0to flip this cycle and will be key to GOP hopes of winning the Senate this November. Manchin\u2019s decision to retire was a harsh blow to Democrats\u2019 hopes of retaining their narrow majority\u00a0in the chamber.

National Republicans, including former President Donald Trump, largely coalesced in the West Virginia Republican primary around Justice, who was barred by term limits from seeking reelection as governor. Still, in the closing weeks, the Senate contest turned bitter as Justice and Mooney traded sharp jabs on air. Mooney launched blistering spots\u00a0accusing\u00a0Justice of supporting \u201cpro-transgender legislation\u201d and\u00a0claiming\u00a0that he \u201cpushed the biggest tax hike in West Virginia history.\u201d Meanwhile, Justice, the owner of the Greenbrier resort\u00a0who turned a coal mining business he inherited into a sprawling empire,\u00a0rebutted some of Mooney\u2019s criticism with\u00a0testimonials in his ads\u00a0from West Virginia coal miners.

The flare \u2013 deemed an X8.7, with the X-class denoting the most intense flares possible \u2013 came from the same region that triggered the geomagnetic storm and stunning display of auroras, or Northern Lights, around the world.

Tara Louise Baker was found dead in her Athens, Georgia, home by Athens-Clarke County firefighters on January 19, 2001, a day before her 24th birthday, according to a news release from the Georgia Bureau of Investigation. On Thursday, state and county investigators said Edrick Lamont Faust, 48, was arrested and faced several charges in connection with Baker\u2019s death, including felony murder, aggravated assault, arson and aggravated sodomy, the news release says. Faust, a resident of Athens, remains in jail on a $15,000 bond, according to Clarke County Sheriff\u2019s Office jail records. CNN could not determine whether Faust has an attorney. \u201cBiological evidence and DNA science\u201d led to the arrest, Chris Hosey, director of the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, said at a press conference Monday. Hosey declined to comment on what led them to Faust, only saying, \u201cinvestigative work by the cold case unit\u201d and local investigators led to this update. No connection was discovered between the victim and suspect, he added. \u201cTara Louise Baker was a hardworking student with a bright future ahead of her,\u201d Hosey said in a statement Thursday. \u201cTara\u2019s life was stolen from her in a horrific act of violence.\u201d Baker, a first-year law student from East Point, Georgia, was last seen alive by a friend at the UGA Law School Library on January 18, 2001, around 7:30 p.m., according to GBI\u2019s unsolved homicide webpage on the case. Authorities say Baker, while still at the library, called the same friend around 9:46 p.m. to make sure they had arrived home safely. Baker told her friend she planned to leave the library around 10 p.m. The homicide investigation into Baker\u2019s death ran cold for 23 years. The victim\u2019s mother, Virginia Baker, speaking through tears, with a large photo of her deceased daughter just behind her, said she was \u201cso grateful\u201d for the arrest. \u201cI am Tara\u2019s mother. I always will be Tara\u2019s mother,\u201d she said Monday. She thanked everyone for their prayers and told other families whose loved ones have been killed to hold onto hope. The GBI\u2019s Cold Case Unit partnered with the Athens-Clarke County Police Department in September 2023 \u201cto conduct an in-depth review and analysis of the ongoing investigation into Baker\u2019s death,\u201d according to the news release. Athens-Clarke County police chief Jerry Saulters, who was an officer at the crime scene in January 2001, said in a statement that he\u2019d hoped for years Baker\u2019s family would find justice. \u201cI remember being there during that horrific time,\u201d Saulters said. \u201cSeeing this case now full circle, I appreciate the hard work of the detectives, from then and now. Knowing that the evidence collected at that time contributed to the arrest today gives me tremendous pride in all the officers who worked this case over the years.\u201d 2023 act named for Baker helps her case The Baker family says they have long waited for an arrest announcement, but \u201cit is not a day without grief and unanswered questions,\u201d they said in a statement provided by Athens true crime podcast host Cameron Jay Harrelson, who covered the student\u2019s story in a series on the Classic City Crime podcast. \u201cOur family is eternally grateful to the Cold Case Unit with the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, the Athens-Clarke County Police Department and Federal Bureau of Investigation for their dedication and diligence in bringing us closer to the truth that has eluded us for 23 years,\u201d the family\u2019s statement read. Harrelson, who connected with Baker\u2019s family four years ago through a mutual friend with Baker\u2019s sister, said the family has long advocated for progress in the cold case. \u201cA mother\u2019s heart never gives up, she never gave up on seeking the truth,\u201d Harrelson told CNN of Virginia Baker, Tara Louise Baker\u2019s mother. The late law student, who in May 2003 was posthumously awarded her law degree from UGA\u2019s School of Law, is remembered by family, friends, colleagues and classmates as a \u201cchampion of justice\u201d who was \u201cfiercely loyal,\u201d according to Harrelson, who said he interviewed hundreds of those who knew Baker for the podcast series. \u201cShe believed in the application of the law. She believed in fighting for people that were less fortunate or whose society might consider to be underdogs, or the left behind and forgotten,\u201d Harrelson said. \u201cI\u2019ve heard many stories of how she was never afraid to say what she felt, but always with kindness,\u201d he added. Georgia\u2019s Coleman-Baker Act, which established a new cold case unit within the GBI, according to CNN affiliate WRDW, was passed last year and named in honor of Baker and Rhonda Sue Coleman, an 18-year-old high school student who was killed in Jeff Davis County, Georgia, in 1990. The arrest of Faust in Baker\u2019s case makes it the first case solved by the GBI\u2019s new cold case unit, a GBI spokesperson told CNN on Saturday. Harrelson says he along with the Baker and Coleman families advocated for the law. \u201cWe did not have any knowledge that this bill would ever affect change for the Baker family themselves,\u201d Harrelson said. \u201cThe way we spoke about it often was that even if this doesn\u2019t help Tara\u2019s case, there are countless families out there that with a second look, (the bill) could help.\u201d He added: \u201cI could not have thought of a better way to honor Tara Baker\u2019s life and legacy, a legacy of fighting for justice and believing in the law, than for this bill to have not only been named after her but to have brought about justice for her.\u201d CNN\u2019s Devon M.

{"id": "2024_05_14_economy_inflation-new-china-tariffs-biden-example", "text": "Countries have long imposed tariffs as a means of protecting and shoring up domestic industries. However, history and research have shown that the economic effects often fail to live up to the hype. On Tuesday, the Biden administration announced the latest iteration of American import taxes: a wave of new and heightened tariffs on Chinese exports across a slew of industries deemed strategic to national security. Economists expect that the newly announced $18 billion in tariffs likely will have a minimal near-term impact on GDP, inflation and monetary policy \u2014 some equating it to a mere \u201crounding error.\u201d However, on a broader level, the picture could be more complex. \u201cThe tariffs announced on China by the Biden administration foreshadow what is going to be a long, cold winter of economic conflict between the US and China,\u201d economist Joe Brusuelas at RSM US told CNN. The latest tariffs build upon former President Donald Trump\u2019s sweeping $300 billion program in 2018 and 2019, which levied tariffs heavily against China and a variety of other trading partners and is still in effect. Trump has made campaign trail promises for even steeper tariffs if he were elected \u2014 not just for China but an across-the-board 10% tariff on all imports, which economists have said would not only result in significant job losses in the US but also stoke inflation. Economic growth, inflation and the Fed The latest tariffs, which would roll out some time between\u00a0now\u00a0and 2026, come amid a solid job market, robust economic growth and strong consumer spending \u2014 but also a continuing battle against decades-high\u00a0inflation\u00a0that is keeping interest\u00a0rates\u00a0higher. Biden\u2019s tariff plan likely won\u2019t move the needle for monetary policy, said Ryan Sweet, chief US economist at Oxford Economics. \u201cThe additional tariffs are essentially a rounding error for inflation and GDP, carrying no implications for monetary policy,\u201d Sweet wrote in a note issued Monday, when reports first indicated that changes to the US tariff policy were forthcoming. \u201cThe Fed will not make a mountain out of a mole hill, so the tariffs will not provide additional ammunition to justify keeping interest rates high for longer.\u201d On Tuesday, after learning the fuller scope of the Biden administration\u2019s tariffs, Sweet told CNN those expectations shouldn\u2019t change significantly. Domestic manufacturing In 2002, when President George W. Bush placed tariffs on imported steel and aluminum products, studies show that while it only cost the economy $30 million, it resulted in higher prices for American steel-consuming industries and led to a steep loss of jobs throughout the steel industry, especially among smaller firms that didn\u2019t have the market power to influence prices. Seven years later, when President Barack Obama increased tariffs on tires imported from China, the initiative was credited with saving about 1,200 jobs in the US tire manufacturing industry, but came at a $1.1 billion cost to Americans in the form of higher prices, the Peterson Institute for International Economics found. The 2018 tariffs imposed by Trump did not result in an immediate boost to manufacturing employment but instead led to a net loss of jobs and rising prices for consumers due to higher input costs and retaliatory tariffs, Federal Reserve economists noted in a 2019 paper. Costs to consumers Tariffs typically make more political sense than economic sense, Sweet noted. \u201cMost economists view tariffs as a bad idea because they prevent a country from reaping the benefits of specialization, disrupt the movement of goods and services, and lead to a misallocation of resources,\u201d Sweet wrote. \u201cConsumers and producers often pay higher prices when tariffs are implemented.\u201d That\u2019s because tariffs tax imports when they come ashore, adding costs for US distributors, retailers and, ultimately, consumers. The US International Trade Commission said in a\u00a02023 study\u00a0that US importers \u201cbore nearly the full cost\u201d of the Trump tariffs. Worse, some businesses appeared to take advantage of the trade war by bumping up prices even higher. Goldman Sachs found that tariffs allowed US producers and non-Chinese exporters to the US market to \u201copportunistically raise their prices as well.\u201d The New York Fed found that the 2018 tariffs cost US households $419 per year because of higher tax burdens and market efficiency losses. Researchers estimated that would double as the tariffs went into effect in 2019. As more time has passed, the positive economic effects have become even less clear cut. The net economic effect of the import tariffs, retaliatory tariffs and agricultural subsidies \u201cwas at best a wash, and it may have been mildly negative,\u201d to US jobs and businesses, economists wrote in a National Bureau of Economic Research working paper published in January 2024. The trade war did appear to have political benefits in strengthening support for the Republican party in the US heartland and communities most affected by the tariffs, researchers noted in the NBER working paper. \u201cResidents of tariff-protected locations became less likely to identify as Democrats and more likely to vote for President Trump,\u201d they wrote. \u201cVoters thus appear to have responded favorably to the extension of tariff protections to local industries despite their economic cost.\u201d The flow of imports The Covid-19 pandemic\u2019s discombobulating effects on supply chains distort the full picture of how the 2018-2019 tariffs affected US manufacturing and trade. US importers had started to substitute away from Chinese goods, but once the pandemic struck and US consumer demand increased, domestic inventory levels drew down quickly and China imports ramped back up, Wells Fargo economists wrote in an April note. However, by the end of 2023, imports from China were down 3% relative to 2019 while there was a 50% growth in imports from South Korea, Singapore, Taiwan and Vietnam, Nicole Cervi, an economist at Wells Fargo, told CNN in an interview. \u201cThere\u2019s definitely some data to suggest that we\u2019ve seen stronger imports from countries outside of China, and some of it may be that Chinese businesses are perhaps relocating some of their operations to these other countries that are not being affected by the Section 301 tariffs,\u201d Cervi said. Recent ocean and air freight data gives further rise to suspicions that China may be trying to circumvent US tariffs via Mexico, said Peter Sand, chief analyst with Xeneta, an ocean and air freight analytics and logistics company. Container shipping imports from China to Mexico rocketed higher by 60% in January and 34% for the first quarter, Xeneta data shows. \u201cThat\u2019s a lot,\u201d Sand told CNN in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s staggering.\u201d What was once an immature trade lane is now one of the busiest in the world, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s obvious that imports to this extent are not only for domestic purposes in Mexico,\u201d he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/14/economy/inflation-new-china-tariffs-biden-example/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_05_13_us_baltimore-bridge-collapse-demolition-monday", "text": "The trapped cargo ship Dali will \u201chopefully\u201d be refloated this week after authorities set off charges at a key portion of the collapsed Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore on Monday evening, an official said. The charges helped demolish a portion of the bridge wreckage that was resting on the ship \u2013 a move meant to help free the vessel, nearly seven weeks after it struck the bridge and caused the span to collapse. During the planned detonation, a chunk of the collapsed structure appeared to fall away from the ship and into the water, though a portion of wreckage remained on top of the ship, video showed. Officials are \u201cvery pleased\u201d with the demolition but will be conducting surveys with divers to make sure nothing fell and damaged the hull of the cargo vessel, US Army Corps of Engineers Col. Estee Pinchasin told reporters. Additionally, before the ship can be refloated, officials must verify that all the charges went off, Pinchasin said. A loud explosion rung out and dark plumes of smoke surrounded the wreckage after the charges were set off. A \u201ctremendous amount of steel\u201d was removed from the Dali, Pinchasin said. Authorities would now examine how the remaining debris sat on the bow of the ship, the colonel said. While teams are prepared to move the remaining wreckage, Pinchasin doesn\u2019t believe more explosives will be used, she said. The targeted explosion took place just after 5 p.m. ET after inclement weather, including lightning, had forced the operation to be postponed over the weekend. The demolition, which included using small explosives to break apart a massive chunk of the\u00a0Baltimore bridge\u00a0that collapsed on a cargo ship nearly seven weeks ago, was originally set for Saturday, but bad weather forced officials to push the operation to Sunday before it was eventually rescheduled for Monday, the Coast Guard said. After necessary assessments and surveys, the plan is to remove ballast to make the ship buoyant on its own and then use four tugboats to pull it out into the channel and escort it to the pier, US Coast Guard Capt. David O\u2019Connell said. Additional wreckage and containers will be removed from the Dali at the pier and the ship will undergo necessary, temporary repairs before more permanent ones can be made. \u201cHopefully we\u2019re going to refloat the Dali in the next few days. We still anticipate to be on time to open full channel by the end of the month,\u201d O\u2019Connell said. The 213-million-pound Dali cargo ship, veered off course March 26 and struck a pillar of the Francis Scott Key Bridge, causing the bridge to fall into the Patapsco River below. The collapse killed\u00a0six construction workers\u00a0and destroyed a key thoroughfare, threatening the economy at the Port of Baltimore. It also sparked multiple investigations into what went wrong and who is responsible. Monday\u2019s planned demolition comes days ahead of a Wednesday hearing scheduled by the\u00a0House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, with\u00a0testimony expected\u00a0from the chair of the National Transportation Safety Board and officials from the Coast Guard, Army Corps of Engineers and the US Department of Transportation. \u201cWe will absolutely not sacrifice safety for speed,\u201d the Coast Guard\u2019s Nick Ameen said Sunday of the weather delay. \u201cWhenever there\u2019s a lightning strike in the area, that pushes the clock back, and so that clock just kept getting pushed back and pushed back.\u201d Officials began moving forward with the demolition process after the body of the sixth victim was recovered from the water last week. The 21 members of the ship\u2019s crew \u2013 who have not left the ship in the almost seven weeks since it struck the bridge \u2013 remained onboard during the operation, according to Darrel Wilson, a spokesperson for Synergy Marine Group, which manages the Dali. The crew members \u201care all safe and standing by to continue assisting the response,\u201d Wilson said. \u2018Safest and swiftest method to remove the bridge piece\u2019 \u201cThe safest and swiftest method to remove the bridge piece from on top of the M/V Dali is by precision cuts made with small charges,\u201d the Key Bridge Response Unified Command said in\u00a0a news release last week. \u201cThis is an industry-standard tool in controlled demolition that will break the span into smaller pieces,\u201d it added, \u201cwhich will allow the work of refloating the vessel and removing it from the federal channel.\u201d The US Army and the US Army Corps of Engineers had said the demolition process would \u201clook like multiple puffs of smoke and sound like fireworks,\u201d in an infographic. Nearby communities were to receive a \u201ccellular notification\u201d beforehand, according to\u00a0Unified Command, which includes\u00a0state and federal authorities, the US Coast Guard and Army Corps of Engineers among them. Ship\u2019s crew have not left since collision While engineers tackle the logistics of clearing a tangled mess of metal to free the Dali, members of Baltimore\u2019s seafaring community remain concerned for the crew\u2019s well-being given the length of time they\u2019ve been aboard the ship. \u201cThey will have a safe place on the vessel where they can shelter during the controlled explosion,\u201d Wilson, with Synergy Marine Group, said, adding the crew was \u201cholding up well\u201d despite the stress of recent weeks. \u201cEven though they are not sailing, they are still performing\u00a0their normal crew duties,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cThis is still a large, complicated piece of equipment and there is a lot they have to look after.\u201d The Singapore Maritime Officers\u2019 Union and the Singapore Organization of Seamen issued a joint statement over the weekend saying they are concerned about \u201cthe potential criminalization\u201d of seafarers aboard the ship as the investigation unfolds. The crew is well taken care of but feels disconnected from the rest of the world, Rev. Josh Messick, executive director of the Baltimore International Seafarers\u2019 Center, told CNN. They have internet access, thanks to hotspots Messick\u2019s group helped deliver, but they do not have their cell phones. The FBI had confiscated the crew\u2019s cell phones as part of the investigation, Messick said. That has kept the crew members disconnected from their families and unable to access critical resources, the unions say. \u201cThey are a little anxious because of the phone situation. We are trying to get their cell phones back to them,\u201d Messick said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just a phone, they can\u2019t access their online banking, their finances, their contacts, they can\u2019t look at photos of their loved ones before they go to sleep at night. It\u2019s a lot more than just a phone.\u201d According to the unions, their representatives were aboard the Dali in April to ensure the crew\u2019s well-being. They are requesting the crew\u2019s visas be extended or renewed to allow for shore leave. The unions are also requesting expedited repatriation for crew members not required for further investigation and the return of their electronics. \u201cHowever long the investigation takes, the crew\u2019s rights and welfare should not be infringed upon during its course,\u201d said Dave Heindel, president of the Seafarers International Union.

{"id": "2024_05_12_us_wildfire-smoke-from-british-columbia-causing-dangerous-air-quality", "text": "More than 100 blazes are burning across Canada Monday, with several major wildfires prompting evacuations for hundreds of residents and threatening to swallow up communities. In the province of Manitoba, in eastern Canada, a massive fire had charred more than 86,000 acres by Monday evening and was less than a mile away from the community of Cranberry Portage, local authorities said. More than 500 residents there had been evacuated, according to Manitoba officials. \u201cI\u2019ve been working in wildfires for 40 years, I\u2019ve never seen a fire move like this fire moved,\u201d Manitoba Wildfire Service Director Earl Simmons said in a Monday news conference. In Western Canada, the Parker Lake Fire in northeastern British Columbia more than tripled in size over the weekend to 13,000 acres and is now on the doorstep of the small community of Fort Nelson. The blaze was less than 1.5 miles west of the town Monday morning, and gusty winds are expected to linger in the coming days and could bring the flames even closer. \u201cThe next 48 hours will be a challenging situation,\u201d said Bowinn Ma, BC minister of emergency management and climate readiness. \u201cWe may begin to see volatile wildfire activity later this afternoon.\u201d As of Monday morning, roughly 4,700 people were under evacuation orders, including in the town of Fort Nelson and Fort Nelson First Nation, Ma said. People across 80 other properties were also asked to evacuate, the official added. Evacuation alerts are also in effect for parts of Alberta as\u00a0wildfire\u00a0MWF-017 burns about 10 miles southwest of the city of Fort McMurray \u2013 an area that was devastated by a wildfire in 2016. By Monday evening, that blaze had grown to more than 16,200 acres. An\u00a0evacuation alert\u00a0was issued for residents in Fort McMurray, Saprae Creek, Gregoire Lake Estates, Fort McMurray 468 First Nation and Anzac, according to Alberta officials. The blazes also prompted the Canadian National Railway Company to suspend services in some areas. \u201cCN has suspended service on our network between Fort St. John and Fort Nelson in British Columbia and north of High Level, Alberta due to wildfire activity,\u201d spokeswoman Ashley Michnowski told CNN. \u201cWe are working with impacted customers as our crews assess damages and identify any required repairs.\u201d Warming climate helps fire conditions Extremely dry conditions and winds gusting up to 25 mph are driving the fire Monday, but the seeds of fire activity were sown over the winter and in past years as the world continues to warm because of human-driven climate change. \u201cThis region has experienced multiple years of drought, with a below normal snowpack this past winter,\u201d said Ben Boghean, fire behavior specialist for the BC Wildfire Service. \u201cAs a result of this, our forests in the Fort Nelson zone are very receptive\u00a0to new fire ignitions and rapid rates of spread.\u201d Declining snow, increasing temperatures and worsening droughts are all hallmarks of climate change and are projected to keep driving larger and more intense fires across Canada, according to Environment Canada. Last year was Canada\u2019s most devastating fire season on record, including in British Columbia, where fires burned through hundreds of homes and an area the size of Maryland, according to the BC Wildfire Service. The Parker Lake Fire is not alone. There are more than 100 fires burning across Canada, 39 of which are considered out of control, according to the Canadian Interagency Fire Centre. Some of the blazes are so-called \u201choldover fires\u201d also known colloquially as \u201czombie fires,\u201d the smoldering remains of last season\u2019s epic blazes, burning deep in the ground throughout the winter and reigniting when exposed to warmer temperatures in the spring. \u201cIn the past, the winter conditions are what put out a lot of holdover fires,\u201d Ma said. \u201cIn this case, what we\u2019ve seen is that due to higher temperatures and persistent drought through the last year, many of these holdover fires were not put out like they normally are.\u201d Two \u201czombie\u201d fires, the Patry Creek Fire and the Nogah Creek wildfire, are growing rapidly to the north and east of Fort Nelson and contributing to the evacuation orders. Evacuation alerts are also in place for parts of Alberta as the MWF-017 wildfire burns out of control near Fort McMurray in the northeastern area of the province, officials said. The fire had burned about 16,000 acres as of Sunday morning. Hazardous smoke creeps into the US Smoke from the infernos has caused Environment Canada\u00a0to issue a special air quality statement extending from British Columbia to Saskatchewan. It has also caused smoke to waft down into the northern tier of the US for the first time this year, and for air quality alerts to be issued for Wisconsin, Minnesota and Iowa. Air quality reached \u201cunhealthy\u201d levels in all three states Monday, including Minneapolis-St. Paul, according to AirNow.gov. On Monday afternoon, the Twin Cities had the eighth-worst air quality of 119 major cities tracked by IQAIR, a company tracking air quality worldwide. Particulate matter levels this high can cause issues for sensitive groups or anyone spending prolonged time outdoors, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. Wildfire smoke has been linked to increases in certain cancers and heart-related issues, among other ailments. Just last year, smoke from Canadian\u00a0wildfires made its way to parts of the United States and caused dangerous air conditions across the country. In 2023, 19 counties in 11 states had days with \u201cvery unhealthy\u201d and \u201chazardous\u201d air quality \u2014 given at least a \u201ccode purple\u201d alert on the US Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s Air Quality Index. Poor air quality conditions are expected to linger in the US through Monday, and likely longer in parts of Canada closer to the fires, including Alberta and British Columbia.  Canadian officials warned those at higher risk of experiencing health effects from\u00a0wildfire\u00a0smoke include people with lung disease such as asthma, people with heart disease, along with older adults, children, those who are pregnant and people who work outdoors. They also recommended those who spend time outdoors wear a mask to help reduce exposure to fine particles of smoke.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/12/us/wildfire-smoke-from-british-columbia-causing-dangerous-air-quality/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "us_beach-read-summer-books-cec", "text": "Summer is almost here, and you\u2019re looking forward to that long-awaited vacation. You can even picture it: \ufeffThe sun is shining, the waves are rolling gently and you\u2019re curling up with a book. Perhaps you\u2019re diving into a steamy romance novel or losing yourself in a page-turning thriller. Maybe a work of romantasy is captivating you instead. Whatever your flavor of escapism, it\u2019s likely that it could be classified as a \u201cbeach read\u201d \u2014 that oft-dismissed, unofficial category of books that readers gravitate toward in the warmer months. But what exactly constitutes a beach read? And where did that idea come from? Here\u2019s what to know about the popular term. What makes a \u2018beach read\u2019 A beach read is, naturally, the sort of book one might read at the beach \u2014 or at a lake, a resort or another typical summer destination. The books populating \u201cbeach read\u201d round-ups from booksellers, publishers and periodicals generally fall into the category of commercial fiction, designed to lure in readers with their saturated covers and playful illustrations. They\u2019re also almost always marketed to women. Amanda Bergeron, who acquires contemporary and historical book club fiction for Penguin Random House\u2019s imprint Berkley, has published several authors whose books frequently appear on \u201cbeach read\u201d lists: Carley Fortune, Jasmine Guillory and Emily Henry, to name a few. When looking for the next big summer read, Bergeron says she\u2019s drawn to fast-paced stories with compelling characters. If it transports the reader to another location, all the better. \u201cIt\u2019s something that you\u2019re excited to spend time with and you can\u2019t put down \u2014 something that you\u2019re just so eager to get back to that it will go with you wherever you go, whether that\u2019s the park, the pool, the couch, your yard or even the beach,\u201d she says. Some books just scream summer, presenting an obvious opportunity to be marketed as a beach read, according to Bergeron. If it takes place in the summer, perhaps on an island or another breezy locale, there\u2019s a good chance it could be a beach read. Sometimes, the \u201cbeach read\u201d designation is so fitting that it announces itself in the title, like Fortune\u2019s 2022 romance novel \u201cEvery Summer After,\u201d Jenn McKinlay\u2019s 2023 rom-com \u201cSummer Reading\u201d or Henry\u2019s aptly named 2020 \u201cBeach Read.\u201d While the romance genre tends to dominate the \u201cbeach read\u201d landscape, the label isn\u2019t limited to romance, says Bergeron. A beach read can just as easily be a suspenseful thriller or a puzzle-box mystery novel \u2014 at least for Bergeron, it\u2019s a book that readers will want to discuss with others and bring along with them on vacation. In other words, a beach read doesn\u2019t ask the reader to ponder the grim realities of the modern world or plunge into the depths of the human experience. Rather, it offers a break from the slog of daily life and the constant drumbeat of depressing news stories. \u201cFor God\u2019s sake, I do not want to be challenged,\u201d Celeste Ballard declared in a 2014 humor column for The New Yorker about how to pick a summer read. \u201cNo \u2018hard\u2019 literature that I have to slog through to discover a deep and twisted meaning.\u201d Why some dislike the term \u2018beach read\u2019 Even though the \u201cbeach read\u201d designation can go hand in hand with commercial success (books labeled as such frequently make bestseller lists), it\u2019s also a loaded term. Author Jennifer Weiner, whose books are often categorized as beach reads, rejected the label for years before eventually embracing it \u2014 an internal conflict she examined in a 2020 essay for Goodreads. \u201cIt\u2019s not hard to discern a whiff of Coppertone-scented sexism in the label,\u201d she wrote. \u201cFast-paced, diverting books that are by or for men are called thrillers or mysteries or sometimes just plain old books, while the ladies get every kind of label, from chick lit to women\u2019s fiction to upmarket women\u2019s fiction to domestic fiction to, well, beach books.\u201d Books labeled as beach reads tend to emphasize plot and characters over elegant prose and heavier themes. To some, the implication is that the book is less serious or less worthy of one\u2019s time. Dakota Johnson, who launched a book club earlier this year, seemed to echo that assumption in an interview with Bustle: \u201cOur book club is literary fiction. It\u2019s not beach reads. It\u2019s not silly,\u201d she said. Though the term \u201cbeach read\u201d is commonly associated with frothy romance novels, Bergeron says that notion can be reductive. Beach reads can absolutely be frivolous \u2014 sometimes, that\u2019s exactly what you need \u2014 but some of the most celebrated beach reads of the past few years explore weightier topics all while delivering on the promise of fun. For instance, Fortune\u2019s 2023 bestseller \u201cMeet Me at the Lake\u201d depicted postpartum anxiety and the loss of a family member, while Kiley Reid\u2019s buzzy 2019 debut \u201cSuch A Fun Age\u201d dealt with race and privilege. \u201cA Love Like the Sun,\u201d a forthcoming novel from Riss M. Neilson, includes representation of chronic illness. \u201cThe fact that writers are able to do all that and offer readers an escape or a big heart hug is just really exciting,\u201d Bergeron says. The \u2018summer read\u2019 is a 19th century invention The term \u201cbeach read\u201d first appeared in literary periodicals around 1990, according to an article by the Los Angeles Public Library \u2014 though it\u2019s unclear who coined it. The concept of the summer read goes back much further, says Donna Harrington-Lueker, a professor of English and communications at Salve Regina University and author of Books for Idle Hours: Nineteenth-Century Publishing and the Rise of Summer Reading. Though now ingrained in our culture, the notion of summer reading was actually a 19th century invention of the publishing industry that sprung up in response to the creation of the summer vacation. Summer reading was initially a ritual enjoyed by rich men, who could afford to engage in leisure travel and unwind with poetry and literature, according to Harrington-Lueker. That changed in the mid-to-late 19th century as the US rapidly industrialized after the Civil War. The construction of railroads and grand hotels made summer vacations more accessible for the middle classes, giving rise to what Harrington-Lueker calls the \u201csummer novel.\u201d The summer novel was specifically geared toward women, Harrington-Lueker explains. The books generally took place over the summer at a resort and tended to follow the rhythms of the season: There might be scenes anchored around a picnic or a fireworks display, with detailed descriptions of what the female characters were wearing. Typically, the books ended with the heroine getting engaged. \u201cThese become lessons in how you practice summer leisure, and they become very popular,\u201d Harrington-Lueker says. The proliferation of the summer novel also generated backlash from some religious leaders who considered them a temptation and devoid of morality. The Reverend T. De Witt Talmage notably declared in an 1876 sermon that \u201cthere is more pestiferous trash read among the intelligent classes in July and August than in all the other ten months of the year.\u201d \u201cWould it not be an awful thing for you to be struck with lightning some day when you had in your hand one of these paper-covered romances\u2014the hero a Parisian rou\u00e9, the heroine an unprincipled flirt \u2026 ?\u201d he chided at the time. But throughout the late 1800s, the publishing industry worked to counter such notions and present summer reading as something desirable, Harrington-Lueker says. Magazines such as The Atlantic Monthly or Harper\u2019s ran advertisements with women clad in muslin dresses, novel in hand, while literary critics extolled the benefits of lighter reading. \u201cThe cakes and ale of literature have their legitimate time and place after the more solid intellectual dishes of the past season have been digested,\u201d an 1887 editorial in the literary review Book Buyer reads. Much like today, summer reads at the time were seen as an escape from the turmoil of the real world. One 1885 magazine column Harrington-Lueker encountered in her research called that summer\u2019s novels \u201cpeculiarly trivial\u201d and hypothesized that publishers were responding to the cholera epidemic, believing \u201cthat the general mind will be so far distraught by anxiety as to have no attention to spare for being critical.\u201d Reading for escape vs reading for enrichment As publishers solidified the association between summer and light reading, some institutions promoted more serious reading during the season, Harrington-Lueker said. One notable example is the Chautauqua movement, a late 19th and early 20th century educational program that sought to help Americans improve themselves through reading. From schools requiring students to read so-called classics in the summer to the anti-racist reading lists that were ubiquitous in 2020, the idea of summer as a time for personal enrichment persists today. Indeed, some people reach for heftier titles during vacation precisely because they finally have the time to dig into them. \u201cSummer reading becomes a point where people automatically begin to think, \u2018How should we be spending our summer? Should we be spending it with escapist fiction that\u2019s going to renew us, that\u2019s going to give us this time apart from a more difficult world? Or should we be using it to engage with topics of more consequence?\u2019\u201d Harrington-Lueker says. That push and pull between reading as escapism and reading as enrichment has long been a part of American culture, Harrington-Lueker adds. In recent years, she says she\u2019s observed that the titles appearing on summer reading lists from The New York Times, Oprah\u2019s Book Club and other cultural tastemakers seem less escapist than they were in previous years.

The announcement of Sutskever\u2019s departure comes one day after OpenAI unveiled its latest artificial intelligence model, GPT-4o, in a presentation that impressed onlookers with its capabilities. Sutskever\u2019s role at OpenAI will be filled by Jakub Pachocki, previously the company\u2019s director of research, according to the company. Sutskever made headlines nearly six months ago when he voted to remove Altman as chief executive and chairman of the board. CNN contributor Kara Swisher previously reported that the decision to fire Altman was driven by Sutskever\u2019s concerns that Altman had pushed AI technology \u201ctoo far, too fast.\u201d Days after Altman\u2019s ouster, Sutskever had a change of heart: He signed an employee letter calling for the entire board to resign and for Altman to return. Altman did not stay on the outs for too long. Five days after his firing, Altman returned to the company as CEO, and Sutskever issued a public apology for his role in the corporate drama. \u201cI deeply regret my participation in the board\u2019s actions,\u201d Sutskever wrote on X in November. \u201cI never intended to harm OpenAI. I love everything we\u2019ve built together and I will do everything I can to reunite the company.\u201d In the months since, OpenAI has continued to push advancements of its flagship product, ChatGPT. Its latest model, announced Monday, will be available to unpaid customers and can effectively turn ChatGPT into a digital personal assistant that can engage in real-time spoken conversations. Sutskever played a defining role in OpenAI\u2019s rise to power in the AI scene. In 2019, Altman, Sutskever and Greg Brockman\u00a0jointly formed\u00a0OpenAI LP, a for-profit entity within the larger nonprofit company\u2019s structure. A few years later, the company earned a valuation of $90 billion. In a statement, Altman said the news of Sutskever\u2019s departure was \u201cvery sad.\u201d \u201cI am forever grateful for what he did here and committed to finishing the mission we started together,\u201d Altman said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/14/tech/openai-chief-scientist-ilya-sutskever-departs/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_05_11_us_rutgers-phd-student-dissertation-birth", "text": "In late March, Tamiah Brevard-Rodriguez had a plan leading up to her April 24 due date. Coined \u201cOperation Dissertation Before Baby,\u201d the plan included Brevard-Rodriguez completing her dissertation and having her baby in time to celebrate graduation and the summer with family. In that order. Brevard-Rodriguez\u2019s dissertation presentation \u2013 for her doctorate at Rutgers Graduate School of Education \u2013 focused on the beauty pressures placed on Black college women while enrolled at predominantly White educational institutions. But while she was in the middle of fine-tuning the dissertation early on March 25, things went decidedly off-plan. After working for a few hours and lying down to get some rest, Brevard-Rodriguez\u2019s water broke. While this was a happy moment, she was scheduled to deliver her dissertation that very day. Tamiah\u2019s wife, Alyza Brevard-Rodriguez, tried to calm her. \u201cI\u2019ve witnessed her work so hard, tirelessly working on the presentation, a six-year program, a two-year study.\u00a0I\u2019m just like, \u2018don\u2019t let today be the day,\u2019\u201d Alyza told CNN. \u201cI walk into the bathroom and I look at her and she is just shaking in tears. As much as I knew that this was a happy moment for the both of us, I can see the sadness on her that you know her day was possibly going to be ruined.\u201d They were planning to go to a birthing center, but their doula told them to get to the hospital quickly. Alyza helped Tamiah to the car and they sped down the highway in the dark, in what Alyza called a \u201crace to the finish line.\u201d When Tamiah started to go into labor, Alyza worried they wouldn\u2019t make it to the hospital in time for the baby\u2019s birth. They didn\u2019t. Tamiah had given birth in the car. \u201cWhen I looked over, she had the baby in her left hand and the umbilical cord in her right,\u201d Alyza said. They got to the hospital with baby Enzo. Doctors and nurses checked him out and cut his umbilical cord, joking that Tamiah \u201cdid all the hard work for us.\u201d Now was the time to rest, but Tamiah still had a dissertation to present. Alyza discussed possibly rescheduling the meeting with Tamiah\u2019s mentor. However, Tamiah worried if they rescheduled, it wouldn\u2019t happen in the time frame needed to graduate this year. \u201cAs I was laying there, I was just thinking to myself, \u2018I can do it,\u2019\u201d Tamiah recalled.\u00a0\u201cThe baby\u2019s here. Let\u2019s just get this over with.\u201d And so she did. Alyza brought her clothes, laptop and a makeup bag. \u201cI took a nap, ate a meal and then I was ready to rock and roll,\u201d Tamiah said. As she logged onto her laptop from her hospital bed, the only person who knew about her delivery earlier that morning was her mentor.\u00a0He didn\u2019t want anyone to give her sympathy, so he kept quiet. For about twenty to thirty minutes, she gave a stellar presentation, Tamiah says. With the presentation over, she took down her Rutgers background on Zoom, revealing the hospital. \u201cEveryone was in complete shock,\u201d Tamiah said. Tamiah\u2019s graduation ceremony is this Sunday, on Mother\u2019s Day. She says she will celebrate with a dinner with family and friends. Alyza also finished her doctorate recently, and their daughter Aubriel is soon graduating from preschool. \u201cIt\u2019s incredible to uplift women and show how incredibly powerful they are,\u201d Alyza said. \u201cI hope that people really take away from this that women are strong and resilient, tenacious, ambitious grit and they can do anything.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/11/us/rutgers-phd-student-dissertation-birth/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "us"}}

{"id": "2024_05_11_us_northern-lights-how-to-watch", "text": "In case you missed the stunning nighttime spectacle of multicolored auroras dancing in the skies across the Northern Hemisphere, there is still a chance Sunday evening to catch a glimpse \u2013 but not for everyone. The auroras that have been visible starting Friday are a result of increased solar activity, including a series of solar flares and coronal mass projections from the sun, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\u2019s Space Weather Prediction Center. The dazzling curtains of green, red and purple lights were spotted from Maine to California and as far south as Alabama, Georgia and Florida on Friday and Saturday. However, people hoping for another sighting in the South and portions of the central United States may be out of luck. \u201cNo more vibrant aurora for Florida or any other \u2018unusual\u2019 places,\u201d said CNN meteorologist Allison Chinchar. \u201cToday is when we see the big shift back to the north for the lights,\u201d Chinchar said. \u201cSo all the usual places you would see the aurora, like Iceland, Canada, Scandinavian countries, etc. \u2026. that\u2019s where the focus will be going forward.\u201d In general, it\u2019s good to start looking during the time right after sunset. Weather, of course, is key, as cloud cover may limit the visibility of the aurora. Mostly clear conditions are expected in the northern portion of the US including Minneapolis and Fargo, North Dakota \u2013 some of the locations with the greatest chance of seeing the auroras on Sunday evening, according to Chinchar. But thicker cloud cover may inhibit viewing opportunities in a few spots in the Pacific Northwest and around the Great Lakes region. Green Bay, Wisconsin, is included in the area with the best viewing opportunities but those may be hampered by a chance of clouds and rain Sunday night, Chinchar said. New York City; Seattle, Washington; and Chicago are among locations where the auroras will possibly be visible on Sunday. The Space Weather Prediction Center, a division of the National Weather Service, observed conditions of an extreme geomagnetic storm at 6:54 p.m. ET on Friday evening, reaching a level 5 out of 5 severity. The last time a solar storm of this magnitude reached Earth was in October 2003, resulting in power outages in Sweden and damaged power transformers in South Africa, according to the center. Signs of a severe geomagnetic storm, or level 4, were first observed by scientists at the center at 12:37 p.m. ET, when a major disturbance was detected in Earth\u2019s magnetic field. Previously, the center issued a geomagnetic storm watch on Thursday evening, the first such watch issued since January 2005. But the forecast was upgraded after scientists observed G5, or extreme geomagnetic storm, conditions Friday evening. As the sun nears the peak of activity in its 11-year cycle, known as\u00a0solar maximum, later this year, researchers have observed increasingly intense solar flares erupting from the fiery orb. Increased solar activity causes auroras that dance around Earth\u2019s poles, known as the northern lights, or aurora borealis, and southern lights, or aurora australis. When the energized particles from coronal mass ejections reach Earth\u2019s magnetic field, they interact with gases in the atmosphere to create different colored light in the sky. The extreme geomagnetic storm will continue and persist through at least Sunday, according to the Space Weather Prediction Center. \u201cThe aurora will be more widespread and seen at lower latitudes\u201d during periods of stronger geomagnetic storm conditions, the center said Sunday. \u201cWe are less certain about how much of an Earth-directed impact we will have with the next pending (coronal mass ejection\u2019s) arrival as compared to our high level of certainty with the previous (coronal mass ejections) and extreme geomagnetic storms,\u201d said Shawn Dahl, a service coordinator with the Space Weather Prediction Center, on Sunday. \u201cTherefore, people wanting to see the aurora should keep checking our webpage and social media presence for news/updates of a new CME arrival,\u201d Dahl said in a statement to CNN. \u201cThe solar wind environment remains highly disturbed as passing CME influences continue, but gradually weaken,\u201d Dahl said. \u201cStill, it will not take much of any new CME arrival for geomagnetic storm levels to reach G3-G4 levels tonight.\u201d The storm\u00a0could affect the power grid\u00a0as well as satellite and high-frequency radio communications. The Biden administration\u00a0said it is monitoring the possibility of impacts. Bill Nye the Science Guy, an educator and engineer, said the massive solar storm could cause problems in a world that relies so much on electricity. Nye noted that a solar storm in 1859, known as the Carrington Event, lasted a week and severely affected telegraph communications, which at the time were state of the art. \u201cThe other thing, everybody, that is a real danger to our technological society, different from 1859, is how much we depend on electricity and our electronics and so on,\u201d Nye said. \u201cNone of\u00a0us really in the developed\u00a0world could go very long without electricity.\u201d There are systems in place to minimize the impact but \u201cstuff might go wrong,\u201d said Nye, noting not all transformers are equipped to withstand a massive solar event. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s just like the April 8th total solar eclipse. It really brings the fact that we live on a planet that\u2019s orbiting a star that\u2019s in a galaxy to our front door. It brings it down to earth,\u201d Dr. Hakeem Oluseyi, an astrophysicist, told CNN. \u201cIf you ask me, I\u2019d say a total solar eclipse is clearly number one. But next to a bright comet, aurorae are pretty amazing to see. And if you\u2019re near the northern extremes or the southern extremes, we cannot just get the colors in the sky, but the actual undulating curtains of nebulosity. That\u2019s pretty awesome. So the fact that that\u2019s going to extend to more people around the world, that\u2019s pretty cool.\u201d Nye added, \u201cLet\u2019s celebrate this.\u201d This story has been updated with additional information.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/11/us/northern-lights-how-to-watch/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "us"}}
