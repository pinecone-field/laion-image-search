{"id": "2024_05_09_us_adam-montgomery-harmony-sentencing", "text": "The New Hampshire man convicted of murdering his 5-year-old daughter Harmony Montgomery was sentenced Thursday to 45 years to life in prison in a case that spurred an investigation into the actions of the child protective services system and rattled relations between Massachusetts and New Hampshire. Adam Montgomery was found guilty in February of second-degree murder in the 2019 death of his daughter Harmony, who was reported missing in 2021. He was also found guilty of second-degree assault, witness tampering, falsifying physical evidence and abuse of a corpse, according to court documents. He was sentenced to 45 years to life for the murder charge, 4 to 8 years for assault, 3.5 to 7 years for witness tampering, and 3.5 to 7 years for falsifying evidence. He also received a 12-month suspended sentence for abuse of a corpse. The charges will be served consecutively, meaning one after the other, for a total minimum of 56 years in prison, the judge ruled. The sentencing comes five years after a Massachusetts judge placed Harmony, who had cycled in and out of foster care as a child, in Montgomery\u2019s custody in New Hampshire \u2013 a decision that has come under intense scrutiny. Her mother last spoke to Harmony in spring of 2019 in a FaceTime call but then was unable to reach her. According to the prosecution\u2019s sentencing memo, Montgomery beat Harmony to death on December 7, 2019, and then engaged in the \u201ctransportation and consolidation of her body over three months\u201d before disposing of her corpse on March 4, 2020. He then lied about her whereabouts for more than two years, according to prosecutors. In 2022, the Massachusetts Office of the Child Advocate wrote a 101-page report on Harmony\u2019s case and found state officials prioritized Harmony\u2019s parents\u2019 rights over the girl\u2019s well-being. \u201cBy not putting her and her needs first, our system ultimately failed her,\u201d OCA director Maria Mossaides said. \u201cWe owe it to her to make the changes necessary to allow our system to do better in the future.\u201d Harmony\u2019s remains still have not been found, though a judge declared her legally dead in March at the request of her mother, Crystal Sorey, CNN affiliate WMUR reported. \u2018I love Harmony. I miss her.\u2019 In court Thursday, several people spoke to provide victim impact statements. Harmony\u2019s mother, Crystal Sorey, talked about her love for her daughter and hatred for the \u201cmonster\u201d and \u201ccoward\u201d who killed her. \u201cShe lit up a room when she walked in, she made a mark wherever she went, and you couldn\u2019t stand it,\u201d she said to Montgomery. The couple who adopted Harmony\u2019s younger brother read a moving statement from the 7-year-old boy. \u201cI love Harmony. I miss her. I hope I get to see her again,\u201d Johnathan Bobbitt-Miller read on the boy\u2019s behalf. \u201cMy sister had beautiful blue eyes and we smile alike. I liked having fun with her on the playground. She gave me a broken Elmo toy that was hers. I still have that, but I have the Minnie Mouse pillow and a new Elmo that\u2019s not broken. I keep it in my closet for her. \u201cI\u2019m really sad she\u2019s an angel. I miss her. She was my best friend. I hope she can see me playing basketball, being silly with my brothers, and I wish I could bring Harmony to my school to meet my friends and my teacher,\u201d he read. In a sentencing memo, prosecutors had asked that Montgomery be sentenced to 56 years to life in prison for all of the crimes. Senior Assistant Attorney General Ben Agati said in court they would lower their sentencing recommendations to the minimum if Montgomery told them where Harmony\u2019s body is buried. The prosecutor then paused for a period, and Montgomery stayed silent. \u201cTime and time again \u2013 and about 30 seconds ago \u2013 the defendant chose to be heartless, immoral, selfish and unapologetic,\u201d the prosecutor said. Meanwhile, the defense requested he receive a sentence less than the state\u2019s recommendation and that the charges be served concurrently. Defense attorney Caroline Smith called the prosecution\u2019s offer of a lower sentence a \u201cstunt.\u201d \u201cThey were seeking a reaction today from Adam Montgomery in the courtroom by their stunt,\u201d she said. Montgomery did not speak, but Smith said he maintained his innocence on the murder charge. \u201cAdam Montgomery did not kill his daughter, but when he discovered his daughter\u2019s death he broke and he did inexplicable things,\u201d she said. \u201cEven he can\u2019t explain his actions, but eventually he pulled it together and was able to say goodbye to his daughter, and that\u2019s what he did.\u201d A life in and out of foster care The\u00a0101-page report by the Massachusetts Office of the Child Advocate detailed Harmony\u2019s time bouncing between her mother\u2019s care and foster care before a judge decided to award custody to Montgomery in 2019. Harmony was born in June 2014 and was blind in one eye and had other medical concerns, according to the report. That summer, a Department of Children and Families office received reports of neglect while the baby was living with her mother, who was struggling with substance abuse, according to the report. Her father was incarcerated at the time of her birth and \u201cnot involved in Harmony\u2019s life,\u201d the report said. Harmony was legally removed from her mother\u2019s care and placed in a foster home, the report said, and she cycled between her mother\u2019s care and the care of the Department of Children and Families over several years. Montgomery had inconsistent contact and supervised visits with his daughter over the next couple of years, but in October 2018 he asked for Harmony to be placed in his care, according to the report. In February 2019, a judge awarded him full custody and ruled a home study about Montgomery under the Interstate Compact of the Placement of Children (ICPS) \u2013 an agreement between all states governing the placement of children across borders \u2013 did not apply for constitutional reasons because he had been found to be a fit parent. Montgomery then took his daughter to New Hampshire roughly a week after the hearing and the Department of Children and Families involvement ended, the report said. Sorey reported Harmony missing in November 2021, saying she hadn\u2019t seen her daughter since a FaceTime call in the spring of 2019. Manchester Police then announced a search for her whereabouts, leading to Montgomery\u2019s arrest in early 2022. The judge\u2019s decision to place Harmony with her father has come under intense scrutiny. New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu wrote a scathing letter to the chief justice of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court about the decision. Sentencing memo describes beatings In the prosecution\u2019s sentencing memo, prosecutors said some of the charges stemmed from an episode in 2019, in which Montgomery struck Harmony \u201cwith such force that he altered the profile of her face.\u201d Montgomery attacked Harmony several times on December 7 after she had a bathroom accident, ultimately killing her, the memo states. \u201cThe defendant struck Harmony numerous times while driving, stopping at lights several times to continue the attack. He only stopped striking Harmony when he felt something \u2018different\u2019 and acknowledged out loud that he believed he \u2018really hurt her this time,\u2019\u201d the sentencing memo reads. It\u2019s possible that Montgomery could have spared Harmony some pain, or even saved her, by getting her help after the attacks, prosecutors said. The fact that he chose not to, they argued, displayed a level of \u201ccruelty and depravity\u201d that warrants more than just the minimum sentence. In the two years after murdering Harmony, prosecutors said Montgomery told others, including law enforcement officers, that his daughter was alive and well with her mother in Massachusetts. Montgomery then embarked on a \u201cstrategy of blaming others for Harmony\u2019s injuries and death,\u201d the sentencing memo states. Prosecutors said he made up a lie about what happened to Harmony and beat her stepmother, Kayla Montgomery, ordering her to stick to the story. Kayla Montgomery pleaded guilty in 2022 to lying to a grand jury about her whereabouts the last time her stepdaughter was seen, according to a parole hearing and\u00a0court records. She testified against her estranged husband in February and was granted parole in March. In the sentencing memo, prosecutors argued that Montgomery\u2019s \u201cextensive\u201d criminal history, which includes threatening a teenager with a knife and shooting a person in the face during a robbery, should be considered in his sentencing.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/09/us/adam-montgomery-harmony-sentencing/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_05_10_economy_us-consumer-sentiment-plunges", "text": "Consumer sentiment plunged to the lowest level in six months as price increases reaccelerated, according to the latest University of Michigan survey of consumers, released Friday. Additionally, consumers are bracing for even higher price increases in the year ahead compared to readings from prior months, the survey found. The gauge, which is closely tracked by the Biden administration, plunged 13% from April\u2019s 77.2% reading, to 67.4%. That\u2019s the biggest one-month drop since mid-2021. Economists polled by FactSet were expecting consumer expectations to fall to just 76.9%. However, the latest reading is still better than last May, when inflation was running at 4%, versus the latest reading of 3.5%. Even though inflation is lower compared to a year ago, it\u2019s been moving in the wrong direction recently, shifting expectations for a rate cut from the Federal Reserve to the back burner. Perhaps the most daunting piece of the report for the Fed was year-ahead inflation expectations rising to 3.5% from 3.2% in April, even further away from the central bank\u2019s 2% target. Long-run inflation expectations also rose, to 3.1% from 3.0% in April. Since inflation expectations can effectively control the pace of price hikes, businesses take those expectations into account when pricing goods and services. The survey suggests that the recent optimism consumers had about the state of the economy is waning. Beyond inflation, they\u2019re also concerned about higher rates of unemployment, Joanne Hsu, the university\u2019s Surveys of Consumers director, said in a release. Bill Adams, chief economist at Comerica Bank, found the survey particularly troubling since, in his view, \u201cthere\u2019s no single smoking gun explaining why consumers were more downbeat.\u201d Concerns about avian bird flu, which is driving up the price of chicken and beef, could partially explain the soured mood, he said. But there are also anxieties about geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, immigration and recent stock market declines. \u201cAnother potential issue is the end of tax season. Many Americans were likely surprised by higher tax bills this year after big gains in the stock market in 2023 and higher interest income from bank deposits and bonds last year,\u201d Adams said in a note Friday. Trouble ahead? The economy right now is performing very well by historical standards. For instance, the nation\u2019s unemployment rate has stayed below 4% for over two years, the longest such streak since the late 1960s. But it\u2019s tomorrow\u2019s economy that\u2019s worrying people even more than usual lately. The Michigan survey, as well as the most recent Conference Board survey on consumers\u2019 attitudes toward the economy, underpin heightened uncertainty about the latter half of this year, Jeffrey Roach, chief economist at LPL Financial, said in a Friday note. In particular, \u201cuncertainty about the inflation path could suppress consumer spending in the coming months,\u201d Roach said, adding that he sees a rising risk of stagflation \u2014 when inflation rises while economic growth slows. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, however, said he is not worried in the least. He told reporters last week that he doesn\u2019t see \u201cthe stag or the \u2018flation.\u201d Consumers are expecting mortgage rates to continue climbing and are indefinitely putting off purchasing a home, according to a New Fed survey released earlier this week. Renting is also far from a bargain these days. Consumers are gearing up for even bigger increases compared to the expected rise in mortgage rates over the next year, the survey found. Additionally, in many parts of the country, the pace of rent increases is eroding recent wage gains. Another worrying sign is the rising rate of consumers becoming delinquent on expenses such as auto loans, credit card bills and rent. The New York Fed will release new data on household borrowing and indebtedness on Tuesday at 11 am ET.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/10/economy/us-consumer-sentiment-plunges/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_05_10_success_college-tuition-payment-options", "text": "The good news is your child got into college and is preparing to enroll this fall. The bad news is that you\u2019ve just learned the aid package your child\u2019s school is offering is much smaller than you\u2019d hoped. That means your share of the total cost of college may be larger than what you have at the ready. The gap for some parents and students can be much worse if you consider top schools in New England, where the annual sticker price before aid is now $90,000 or more. The total average annual cost came to $60,420 at private four-year colleges in 2023, according to the College Board. After accounting for the average aid offer to offset tuition costs, students and their parents were still on the hook to pay an average of nearly $35,000. But even when students enroll in less expensive public universities, for any parent who doesn\u2019t have a fat 529 college savings and investment plan, or any at all, it\u2019s sobering to realize that in the next few months you\u2019re going to have to come up with a lot more money than you were expecting. Exactly how to do that is the question. \u201cThere is no magic bullet,\u201d said Beth Walker, founder of the Center for College Planning Solutions and author of \u201cNever Pay Retail for College.\u201d But here are some suggestions that may help, or at least buy you a little time to figure out how to handle all the education expenses coming due in the next four years \u2014 or longer, if you have younger kids who are also planning to go to college. Your child may have to borrow money. Try not to feel guilty If you never wanted your children to be saddled with debt before graduating from college, you might rethink that. Freshmen can take out a $5,500 federal Stafford loan at a favorable interest rate. Currently it\u2019s 5.50% but it resets every July. Over four years of college, students can take out a total of up to $27,000. What\u2019s more, they don\u2019t have to pay the money back while they\u2019re in school, and they can get a favorable income-driven repayment plan after graduating. \u201cIt\u2019s their best financing tool available,\u201d Walker said. If it really pains you to see them assume debt, remember you can plan now to help them pay it off once they\u2019ve graduated, she noted. Other borrowing options Beyond Stafford loans, there are other borrowing options, but they all come with big caveats: Private student loans: Some students may also take out a private student loan, which doesn\u2019t provide any of the flexible repayment protections they have with federal loans, and could come with a much higher interest rate. But if your child doesn\u2019t have a credit history, you will need to cosign the loan. So you should think about whether you can assume the risks of repaying that money if your child can\u2019t pay it off, especially if the loan you choose doesn\u2019t allow you to defer payment until your child graduates. Parental loans: Parents can also take out a federal Direct PLUS loan. But Joseph Bogardus, a certified financial planner who specializes in college cost planning, is not a big fan because of its high fees (over 4% of the loan amount), the fact that there is no real break on the interest rate (currently 8.05%) and parents may have to start repaying it while the student is in school, unless they request a deferment. As he put it, \u201cIf you can\u2019t afford to pay $500 a month now, what makes you think you\u2019ll be able to pay $1,000 a month later?\u201d Your 401(k): Taking a withdrawal from your retirement savings may be tempting, but it\u2019s never a great idea. No one is going to fund your retirement if you don\u2019t. But if you are thinking of using some retirement money, make sure to first directly roll over the amount from your 401(k) into an IRA. You will have to pay income taxes on the money, but if you\u2019re under 59-1/2 you will not be hit with a 10% early withdrawal penalty in an IRA if you use the money for qualified educational expenses, Bogardus said. Your credit card: A bad idea. Skip to the next options. The average credit card rate is north of 20%.\u00a0And if you can\u2019t pay off a large sum right away or you can only make the minimum payments due every month, you risk never getting out of that debt cycle. Home equity line of credit: If you\u2019re in a real pinch for your child\u2019s freshman year, and you have substantial equity in your home, Walker said, you might consider an interest-only home equity line of credit as a short-term cash-flow option. \u201cThat\u2019s cash-flow friendly while your child is in college,\u201d Walker said. \u201cYou\u2019re renting money on the cheap to buy time to figure out how you\u2019ll do this.\u201d So, say you take out a $20,000 interest-only HELOC at 8%. That means you\u2019ll only have to pay roughly $133 a month in interest, or $1,600 for the year. You will, however, have to pay the principal back after a given term \u2014 typically 10 years. And if you can\u2019t do so in full, you will have to pay interest and principal on the remaining balance until it\u2019s paid off. Redirect current spending and savings Even smaller measures can help somewhat in closing the funding gap if you\u2019re looking to raise some cash between now and the fall. Quantify how much a teenager at home costs: Walker said parents often overlook the expense of having their children under the same roof. She recommends evaluating how much your college-bound student costs you while they are at home. Think food, gas, entertainment, incidentals, etc. That\u2019s money you\u2019ll be able to redirect toward college costs when they leave home. Redirect discretionary income to savings: During the few months before the bill for the first semester comes due, temporarily cut back on your discretionary spending (e.g., travel and entertainment) and redirect that money into a high-yield savings account. Temporarily pause or reduce some retirement contributions: It\u2019s not optimal, but if you feel you\u2019re doing okay in terms of your retirement savings, you might temporarily redirect the money from your paycheck that would have gone into your 401(k) or IRA for the next three months and put it into the college kitty instead. But, Bogardus cautioned, \u201cYou don\u2019t want it to be a crutch. Think of the oxygen mask analogy: When doing this, parents should be in a good position first for their own future, then concern themselves with their student\u2019s college costs.\u201d Be honest about what you can afford College is among the biggest financial investments parents and their children will ever make. Ideally, key questions like \u201cHow much can we afford?\u201d should be raised no later than when your child is a sophomore in high school, at which point you can better set expectations of the kind of school you (and they) can afford, Walker said. So if you find yourself in a bind with your first-born this summer, you can at least be better prepared when your second child starts thinking about college. You both should take a hard look at different colleges\u2019 costs, Walker suggested, and ask: Is a Bachelor\u2019s degree from a school that costs two to three times as much as another really going to be worth two to three times as much when the child graduates? Also, Bogardus suggests checking to see if your state offers a tuition aid plan or subsidized loan rates for educational expenses. For instance, he said, see if your state has a program that offers a year or two of free in-state community college, the credits from which can be transferred to the state university from which your child could earn their degree.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/10/success/college-tuition-payment-options/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "us"}}

Henry Cuellar\u2019s\u00a0former\u00a0campaign manager and another political operative\u00a0have agreed to\u00a0plead guilty to federal crimes and are cooperating with the Justice Department\u2019s prosecution of the Texas\u00a0Democrat, according to court\u00a0documents unsealed Wednesday. Mina\u00a0Colin Strother, Cuellar\u2019s\u00a0former\u00a0campaign manager and former chief of staff, and Florencio \u201cLencho\u201d Rendon, a political consultant and businessman from San Antonio,\u00a0agreed to\u00a0plead guilty to conspiracy to commit money laundering in March. Cuellar and his wife,\u00a0Imelda,\u00a0were indicted last week on suspicion of accepting nearly $600,000 in bribes from two foreign entities \u2013\u00a0a\u00a0bank\u00a0headquartered in Mexico City\u00a0and an oil and gas company owned by the government of Azerbaijan. Both the congressman and his wife have pleaded\u00a0not guilty. Cuellar has publicly asserted his innocence, saying\u00a0in a statement last week\u00a0that \u201cboth my wife and I are innocent of these allegations. Everything I have done in Congress has been to serve the people of South Texas.\u201d According to court documents, Rendon and Cuellar concocted the bribery scheme in 2015 after learning that the Mexican bank\u00a0needed help\u00a0doing business within the United States. Rendon signed on to a phony \u201cconsulting agreement\u201d with the bank for $15,000 per month, prosecutors say. Most of the money was eventually sent to the Cuellars, prosecutors allege, but Rendon didn\u2019t think it was a good idea to send money directly to Imelda. Cuellar then suggested recruiting Strother as a middleman,\u00a0prosecutors say. The alleged plot\u00a0evolved into an arrangement where\u00a0Rendon would send $11,000 per month to Strother, who in turn would send $10,000 to\u00a0a company owned by\u00a0Imelda Cuellar, according to court documents. From March 2016 to February 2018, Strother transferred nearly $215,000 to\u00a0Cuellar\u2019s wife, according to court filings. The Cuellars are not named in Strother\u2019s and Rendon\u2019s plea deal agreements, but both of their case numbers are listed as related cases to Cuellar\u2019s in court records. Specific details laid out in the plea agreements also exactly match details in the indictment against Cuellar. Cuellar\u2019s attorney, Chris Flood, told CNN in a statement, \u201cAs long as\u00a0Strother and Rendon tell the truth, we are not worried. As we all know, the government can convince people to tell them what they want to hear rather than the truth. I don\u2019t know what they are saying, but as long as they stick to the truth, we are not worried.\u201d CNN has reached out to attorneys for Rendon and Strother for comment.

{"id": "2024_05_10_business_apple-labor-unions-stores-retail-strike", "text": "Apple faces plenty of challenges this year including regulatory scrutiny in Washington, sluggish sales in China and a competitive landscape in AI. Now, its leaders also have to contend with labor unrest. Apple store workers in Towson, Maryland, made history in June 2022 when they voted to form the first union at one of the tech giant\u2019s sleek US stores. Since 2023, the worker group outside of Baltimore has been in contract negotiations with Apple management. Now, workers are weighing a strike. Saying management has yet to meet their core demands, the Maryland workers are holding a strike authorization vote on Saturday, one of the strongest labor actions taken against the Big Tech company yet. And it\u2019s far from the only labor challenge Apple is battling in the US. Employees in New Jersey are holding a union election this weekend. In addition, the National Labor Relations Board this week upheld a decision alleging Apple\u2019s union-busting tactics in New York City. The company also has unfair labor practice complaints against it in front of labor judges right now (Apple denies these allegations). The labor wave that has hit Apple retail stores echoes the mass organizing that began at other influential companies in the United States, such as Starbucks and Amazon. As Apple grew to become the world\u2019s first $3 trillion company, a tight labor market coming out of the Covid-19 pandemic exposed labor conditions and inequalities front-facing workers in places such as stores and warehouses faced. \u201cIt speaks to a growing frustration among workers and also a contagion in labor activity, which is when one group of workers stands up and inspires others,\u201d Kate Bronfenbrenner, the Director of Labor Education Research at Cornell\u2019s School of Industrial and Labor Relations, said. So far, workers at two Apple store locations \u2013 Towson, Maryland and Oklahoma City \u2013 have voted to unionize. But the union vote in New Jersey this weekend, along with other efforts across the country, could just be the beginning. Apple is a high profile company \u2013 and many, many Americans have at least one Apple product. \u201cThis whole segment of the economy that didn\u2019t have a lot of activity, suddenly has activity. The Apple workers (possibly) going on strike is going to be a spark for other workers,\u201d Bronfenbrenner said. \u201cAt Apple we work hard to provide an excellent experience for our retail team members and empower them to deliver exceptional service for our customers. We deeply value our team members and we\u2019re proud to provide them with industry leading compensation and exceptional benefits. As always, we will engage with the union representing our team in Towson respectfully and in good faith,\u201d an Apple spokesperson said in an emailed statement to CNN. A possible strike The Maryland workers are considering a strike because after over a year of negotiations, management had yet to come up with solutions to core issues such as \u201cwork-life balance, unpredictable scheduling practices that disrupt personal lives, and wages that do not reflect the cost of living in the area,\u201d a release by the union said. A strike sanction vote doesn\u2019t mean the store is going on strike. It\u2019s one step of a longer process that ends with a final strike authorization vote. The workers at the Maryland Apple store are members of the\u00a0International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers Coalition of Organized Retail Employees (IAM COTE). \u201cThis strike sanction vote sends a strong message that the workers want Apple to recognize the need for an equitable and respectful work environment for all its employees,\u201d\u00a0IAM District 4 Directing Business Representative Jay Wadleigh said in a statement. The Maryland store has an ongoing complaint filed against Apple, which alleges the company provided improved health and education benefits to non-union employees and not the unionized employees. Bronfenbrenner said a big motivation behind organizing is the gap between corporate profits in America\u2019s biggest companies \u2013 such as Apple, Amazon and Google \u2013 and worker wages and benefits, especially for workers in retail stores or warehouses. \u201cThere\u2019s just a lot of anger. And the corporations like Apple have made huge profits while the workers feel like their wages have stagnated,\u201d Bronfenbrenner said. Union drives in full swing Apple, like other big companies, is cracking down on union activities. The NLRB found that Apple went too far in trying to crack down on a union drive in New York City. The NLRB\u00a0ruled this month that Apple unlawfully interrogated employees and confiscated and prohibited union flyers while allowing non-union materials at the World Trade Center location in 2022. The NLRB held up the US Labor Board judge\u2019s decision from last year \u2013 which was the first time a labor judge ruled against Apple. The affirmation from the NLRB is a win for labor organizers. But across the river in New Jersey, there is a union election for employees in Short Hills, a New York City suburb. There are other unfair labor practice complaints against Apple before labor judges at the moment. Similar to New York City, workers in Atlanta issued a complaint in 2022 alleging Apple illegally interrogated employees about union support and tried to convince them not to join one. The labor action is not just taking place at Apple\u2019s front-facing retail stores. In its Cupertino, California, headquarters, a decision is pending for a complaint that alleged Apple illegally fired, disciplined, threatened and interrogated an employee for \u201cengaging in protected concerted activity.\u201d Big Tech, traditionally seen as a prestigious and secure field, has been hit with mass layoffs.

Israel would fight with its \u201cfingernails\u201d if necessary, Netanyahu said in response. The Israeli military added it has the weapons it needs for its missions in Gaza, including a Rafah invasion.

Stormy Daniels The testimony of adult film actress Stormy Daniels, a central figure in the criminal case against former President Donald Trump, wrapped on Thursday after Trump\u2019s lawyers continued their attack on her credibility. Daniels pushed back on claims she was untruthful about her alleged sexual encounter with Trump in 2006, saying that the story was true, even as she was confronted with inconsistencies in some of the small details of her account. Trump has denied the affair. At the end of the day, Judge Juan Merchan denied two defense motions, one for a mistrial based on the argument that Daniels\u2019 changed her story about the alleged encounter, and one seeking a modification on a gag order so the former president could talk publicly about Daniels. 3. Health care cyberattack A cyberattack is disrupting clinical operations at a major health care nonprofit, forcing staff to divert ambulances from \u201cseveral\u201d hospitals. The cyberattack on Ascension, a St. Louis-based nonprofit network that includes 140 hospitals in 19 states, is causing issues with electronic health records, some phone systems and \u201cvarious systems utilized to order certain tests, procedures and medications,\u201d Ascension said Thursday. The incident follows other widespread hacks in recent months that have hobbled health care networks across the US. A February ransomware attack on Change Healthcare caused billing disruptions at pharmacies nationwide and threatened to put some health providers out of business. Its parent company paid a $22 million ransom to the cybercriminals to protect patient data in that case. 4. Plane safety The Senate on Thursday passed a Federal Aviation Administration reauthorization bill ahead of a key deadline today. The bill would renew authority for the FAA for the next five years and allocate billions of dollars to improve aviation safety, enhance protections for passengers and workers and invest in airport and air travel infrastructure nationwide. Among a wide range of provisions, the legislation seeks to address the nation\u2019s shortage of air traffic controllers with directives aimed at expanding hiring and strengthening consumer protections for refunds for flight cancellations and delays. On the heels of several airline safety mishaps, it would also implement technology to reduce the risk of runway collisions. The House will next need to pass the legislation, which currently has broad bipartisan support. 5. Ukraine Western intelligence believes Russia is seeking to exploit what it sees as a \u201cwindow of opportunity\u201d to further step up air and ground attacks on Ukraine as the country awaits further US aid. This comes as Russia unleashed a massive missile and drone attack on Ukraine this week. Ukrainian authorities say Russia fired more than 50 missiles and 20 drones, targeting its energy infrastructure. Ukraine\u2019s largest power company said this was the fifth time Russia has attacked its facilities in the last six weeks. Meanwhile in Russia, President Vladimir Putin presided over a choreographed Victory Day parade to display his military might. An estimated 9,000 personnel took part, including a thousand currently serving in the full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

{"id": "2024_05_08_us_johnny-cash-daisy-bates-us-capitol-statues", "text": "The US Capitol will soon officially welcome two new, iconic figures. A statue of Daisy Bates, a civil rights journalist and activist who is perhaps best known for her role as a mentor to the Little Rock Nine \u2013 a group of Black students who were the first to desegregate schools and break Arkansas\u2019 color barrier \u2013 is replacing one of Uriah M. Rose, an attorney and former president of the Arkansas Bar Association. Another statue \u2013 of James Paul Clarke, the state\u2019s 18th governor \u2013 is set to be replaced in September by one of country music icon Johnny Cash. The statues of Clarke and Rose have been in the US Capitol for more than a century, with Rose being installed in 1917 and Clarke in 1921. The National Statuary Hall\u2019s collection includes two statues from all 50 states.  Bates\u2019 statue was installed in the hall on May 3 and officially unveiled on Wednesday, during a ceremony organized by the office of House Speaker Mike Johnson.  The bill to replace Rose and Clarke\u2019s statues was signed in April 2019 by then-Gov. Asa Hutchinson. Soon after, Bates and Cash were chosen as their replacements, CNN reported. Many had called for taking down the previous Arkansas statue representatives, including Clarke\u2019s own great-great-grandson, Democratic state Sen. Clarke Tucker. Citing statements made by Clarke, including his 1894 proclamation that the people of the South had looked to the Democratic Party to \u201cpreserve the white standards of civilization,\u201d Tucker said the change was needed. \u201cIn the context of who represents Arkansas in Statuary Hall, the time has come to move in a new direction,\u201d he said. Rose, meanwhile, had stayed loyal to Confederate Arkansas throughout the Civil War, according to the hall\u2019s website. Cash and Bates were Arkansas natives. Cash was born in Kingsland before his family moved to Dyess in east Arkansas. After moving away for much of his professional career, Cash returned in 1968 to play the \u201cJohnny Cash Homecoming Show,\u201d and again in 1969 to play at Cummins Prison. Bates grew up in Huttig, but moved to Little Rock in 1941, where she and her husband, Lucious Christopher \u201cL.C.\u201d Bates, started the Arkansas State Press, a newspaper devoted to the fight for civil rights. During her time as president of the Arkansas chapter of the NAACP, Bates led the charge for school desegregation, emerging as a key civil rights advocate during the 1957 desegregation of Central High School. Bates died in Little Rock in 1999. \u201cRemoving these kinds of statues isn\u2019t denying history as much as it\u2019s saying, \u2018We acknowledge the true history of it. We acknowledge this was wrong,\u2019\u201d said Benjamin Victor, the sculptor of Bates\u2019 statue. Victor said he sees the replacements as the \u201cright thing to do,\u201d noting the previous statues represent a time in American history \u201cthat was very ugly and awful.\u201d It\u2019s not the first time the US Capitol has had Confederate statues removed from the Statuary Hall. In 2016, Florida state lawmakers voted to replace its statue of Confederate Gen. Edmund Kirby Smith with one of civil rights leader, Mary McLeod Bethune. The statue was officially installed in July 2022, with Bethune making history as the first Black person to have a state-commissioned statue in the Statuary Hall. Victor, an artist from Idaho, has other statues on display in the collection \u2014 including Nevada\u2019s Sarah Winnemucca, Nebraska\u2019s Chief Standing Bear and Iowa\u2019s Norman E. Borlaug. He is the only living artist to have three (now four) permanent portrait sculptures displayed in the Capitol, notes the Nebraska Commission of Indian Affairs \u2013 an organization that helped secure Chief Standing Bear\u2019s statue in 2019. Little Rock-based artist Kevin Kresse, designer of Cash\u2019s statue, has his installation and dedication tentatively scheduled for late September, said Shane Broadway, chairman of the National Statuary Hall Steering Committee. Kresse is a lifelong, self-proclaimed\u00a0\u201cArkansawyer\u201d\u00a0and Cash fan. In choosing the details of Cash\u2019s statue, Kresse included a Bible tucked in his hand and Cash\u2019s signature guitar, which he referred to as Cash\u2019s \u201cbackpack that took him all over the world.\u201d Kresse \u2013 who is 62 now but was 59 at the time of the Capitol commission \u2013 said when Cash was his age, \u201chis star was starting to dim, but he didn\u2019t know at the time that some of his most impactful work was right around the corner\u201d \u2013 much like Kresse\u2019s own career, he said. Kresse doesn\u2019t want the full significance of the moment to be forgotten, he said. \u201c(Both Daisy and Johnny are) two people who stood up for those who are overlooked, passed over and pushed off to the side,\u201d Kresse told CNN. \u201cThey both came from abject poverty and some real trauma and tragedy early in their life and I think it really (caused) both of them to never forget where they came from.\u201d The artists for both statues were selected through a national competition organized by the committee and the Arkansas Capitol Arts and Grounds Commission under the endorsement of Secretary of State John Thurston who also serves as chairman of the commission, Broadway said. While the state of Arkansas handled the entire process of selecting a statue, choosing sculptors, and raising funds, \u201cThe Architect of the Capitol\u2019s Curator oversees the process from Congress\u2019 perspective and coordinates heavily with the states,\u201d Grace White, communications director for the US Committee on House Administration, told CNN in a statement. As a finalist, Victor traveled to Little Rock where he explained his vision to the selection committee while presenting a model of the statue. Victor didn\u2019t know who Bates was prior to entering the competition but felt compelled to help share her story after learning of her \u201cfearlessness.\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s this sort of unsung hero in US history that I love to celebrate,\u201d Victor told CNN. \u201cThis type of hero that everyone should know but relatively few people do know of. And we\u2019re changing that with each of these statues.\u201d Throughout her 1987 memoir \u201cThe Long Shadow of Little Rock,\u201d Bates likens her life to that of a red rose, which Victor incorporated on the statue\u2019s lapel, he said. Above the rose sits a NAACP pin. Victor believes the new statue\u2019s imprint in history will be monumental. \u201cIn that room in Statuary Hall, you got the spot where (Daisy) replaced Uriah Rose (and) it\u2019s right next to (Confederate President) Jefferson Davis. It\u2019s going to be a really powerful setting for Daisy to be included in because Jefferson Davis\u2019s statue is sort of scowling. It looks kind of negative. \u201cAnd Daisy Bates is smiling and striding forward right next to him,\u201d Victor said. \u201cI think it\u2019s this powerful juxtaposition and I hope Mississippi changes their statue (of Davis) soon. But for now, it\u2019s everything we could do to bring somebody like this into the Capitol, change out that corner, and change out that area.\u201d Staring across from Bates, as Victor describes, are statues of Bethune and Rosa Parks. \u201cYou\u2019ve got (figures like) Daisy Bates, Rosa Parks, and Chief Standing Bear (there) because they helped people instead of trying to hurt people,\u201d Victor said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to describe that feeling when (Bates) was installed in the room and the entire change of the room because of it.\u201d CNN\u2019s Katie Bernard, Alex Rogers, Rikki Klaus, Devon M. Sayers, Annie Grayer and Clare Foran contributed to this report.

{"id": "2024_05_10_cars_hyundai-kia-auto-theft-stolen-cars", "text": "Two Hyundai models and one Kia were the three most-stolen vehicles last year, according to a report from the National Insurance Crime Bureau. Hyundai Elantra compact cars were stolen more than 48,000 times last year while Hyundai Sonata sedans were stolen almost 43,000 times, according to the report. Kia Optima sedans were stolen more than 30,000 times according to the report, which only counted police-reported thefts. These theft numbers far outstripped those of the fourth most stolen model, the Chevrolet Silverado 1500 pickup, one of the best-selling vehicles in America. Silverado pickups were stolen about 24,000 times, according to the report. In all, six of the top 10 most-stolen vehicles in America last year were Hyundai and Kia models. The list included the Kia Soul, Kia Forte, and Kia Sportage. Other vehicles on the list were the Honda Accord, Honda Civic and the Ford F-150 pickup. The NICB reports raw numbers of police-reported thefts that are gathered through the National Crime Information Center. The numbers are not adjusted for the population of a given model on the road so, to a certain extent, some vehicles may be more commonly stolen simply because there are more of them available to steal. Why Hyundai and Kia cars are top targets By the first half of 2023, thefts of older Hyundai and Kia models had increased by 1,000% since 2020, according to a report by the Highway Loss Data Institute early this year. Certain older Hyundai and Kia models made before 2023 are particularly vulnerable to car thieves. Less expensive versions of vehicles such as those cars equipped with turn-key ignitions \u2014 as opposed to cars that only require a button press to start \u2013 are roughly twice as likely to be stolen as other vehicles of a similar age, according to the HLDI. These vehicles can lack some of the basic auto theft prevention technologies, such as electronic immobilizers, included in most other vehicles even in those years, according to the HLDI. Electronic immobilizers rely on a computer chip in the car and another in the key that communicate to confirm that the key is authentic and belongs to that vehicle. Techniques to steal these cars spread through social media channels. As theft claims for Hyundai and Kia vehicles have incrased since 2020, \u201cvandalism\u201d insurance claims on them have also gone up, according HLDI data. That\u2019s presumably a result of these models being targeted for theft but left damaged when some attempts fail, according to HLDI. Hyundai and Kia operate as separate companies in the United States, but Hyundai Motor Group owns a large stake in Kia, and various Hyundai and Kia models share much of their engineering. More recent models from these automakers are less vulnerable to theft. Earlier this year, Hyundai and Kia agreed to a\u00a0$200 million settlement\u00a0with as many as 9 million vehicle owners to settle claims that the automakers didn\u2019t do enough to make the vehicles secure. Along with payments for stolen and damaged vehicles, the settlement also included installation of anti-theft software and the costs of other theft-preventative measures. \u201cIn response to this situation, Kia continues\u00a0to\u00a0take\u00a0comprehensive\u00a0action\u00a0to enhance the security of our vehicles in an effort to prevent criminals from using methods of theft popularized on social media to break the law and steal or attempt to steal certain vehicle\u00a0models,\u201d Kia spokesman James Bell said in an emailed statement. More than 1.1 million Kia vehicles nationwide have had anti-theft software installed, according to Kia. The company is also providing free steering wheel locks for vehicles that are not able to accept the anti-theft software. Hyundai said it has retroactively added various anti-theft measures on 1.3 million of its vehicles.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/10/cars/hyundai-kia-auto-theft-stolen-cars/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "us"}}

The victim was identified as 37-year-old Jos\u00e9 Mynor L\u00f3pez of Baltimore, Maryland. CNN has previously reported Lopez has three children and was the main provider of his family. \u201cInvestigators from the Maryland State Police, along with an FBI Victim Specialist and linguist, and a team of mental health professionals notified family members after a positive identification was confirmed,\u201d the Unified Command, a joint task force composed of police, Coast Guard and other government agencies to respond to the disaster, said in a statement online. The Francis Scott Key Bridge collapsed after a 213-million-pound cargo vessel lost power and slammed into the structure, killing six construction workers repairing potholes on it. The bridge was used by some 30,000 Marylanders every day. The six construction workers were immigrants from four countries \u2013 Honduras, El Salvador, Mexico and Guatemala. Alongside L\u00f3pez, they include 49-year-old Miguel Angel Luna Gonzalez; 35-year-old Alejandro Hernandez\u00a0Fuentes;\u00a026-year-old Dorlian Ronial Castillo Cabrera; 38-year-old Maynor Yassir Suazo Sandoval; and Carlos Daniel Hernandez Estrella, according to authorities. A GoFundMe created in March for L\u00f3pez\u2019s widow and her family wrote they now face an \u201cuncertain future\u201d without their \u201cmain provider and pillar of strength.\u201d \u201c(L\u00f3pez) worked tirelessly to ensure his family had everything they needed,\u201d according to the GoFundMe page, which no longer appears to be active. \u201cHis sudden absence has left a void that cannot be filled, both emotionally and financially.\u201d Both the recovery process and the work to remove wreckage from the bridge collapse site have been incredibly difficult tasks, state and federal leaders have said. In April, the US Army Corps of Engineers\u00a0said it plans to fully reopen\u00a0the \u201c700-foot-wide by 50-foot-deep federal navigation\u201d channel leading to the Baltimore port by the end of this month. On Monday, Maryland Gov. Wes Moore hosted federal officials on a tour of the ongoing operations at the channel. \u201cSecuring federal funding to rebuild the Francis Scott Key Bridge \u2014 fundamental to restoring the traffic system for the greater Baltimore region and principal route for all hazardous materials traveling along the I-95 corridor \u2014 is critical to addressing the economic, social and community impacts felt across the state, region, and country since the bridge collapsed,\u201d Moore\u2019s office said in a statement. \u201cGovernor Moore has repeatedly engaged with Maryland\u2019s federal delegation and critical members of Congress to help ensure full federal support to rebuild.\u201d So far, Maryland has received $60 million in emergency relief funds toward the project, the office said.

{"id": "2024_05_10_tech_cyberattack-ascension-ambulances-hospitals", "text": "A\u00a0major US health care system said Thursday that it is diverting ambulances from \u201cseveral\u201d of its hospitals following a cyberattack this week. The cyberattack on Ascension, a St. Louis-based nonprofit network that includes 140 hospitals in 19 states, is also disrupting access to electronic health records, some phone systems and \u201cvarious systems utilized to order certain tests, procedures and medications,\u201d Ascension said in a\u00a0statement\u00a0distributed Thursday evening. The sprawling health care network, which also owns 40 senior living facilities, said that it would be using \u201cdowntime procedure for some time,\u201d because of the cyberattack. Downtime procedures are typically when health providers revert to backup processes, including paper records, that allow them to care for patients when computers are down. Four sources briefed on the investigation told CNN that Ascension suffered a ransomware attack, in which cybercriminals typically try to lock computers and steal data for extortion. Those sources said that the type of ransomware used in the hack is known as Black Basta, which hackers have used repeatedly to attack health care organizations in recent years. Black Basta, also the name of a broad criminal group that uses the ransomware, includes Russian-speakers, according to the Department of Health and Human Services. On Friday, the Health Information Sharing and Analysis Center, a cyber threat sharing group for big health care providers worldwide,\u00a0published an advisory warning that hackers using Black Basta ransomware have \u201crecently accelerated attacks against the healthcare sector.\u201d That includes at least two health care organizations in Europe and the US that in the last month\u00a0have \u201csuffered severe operational disruptions\u201d because of Black Basta ransomware,\u201d the advisory said, without naming the health care organizations. News of the hack of Ascension broke\u00a0on Wednesday, and Ascension has in the last 24 hours followed a familiar playbook for many American organizations that have been assaulted by cybercriminals. Ascension has notified federal authorities of the incident, hired prominent US cybersecurity firm Mandiant to recover from the incident and shut down systems to try to keep the incident under control. Senior US officials have been in repeated contact with Ascension CEO Joseph Impicciche since the ransomware attack to understand how the hack might impact patient care, two sources familiar with the matter told CNN. \u201cWe are actively supporting our ministries as they continue to provide safe, patient care with established downtime protocols and procedures, in which our workforce is well trained,\u201d Ascension said in its statement Thursday evening. It was not clear how many Ascension hospitals were sending ambulances to other locations because of the cyberattack. Ascension spokesperson Gene Ford did not respond to calls and emails seeking comment. It\u2019s only the latest major hacking incident that has hobbled a big US health care network and sent US officials scrambling to offer support. A February ransomware attack on Change Healthcare, a subsidiary of health care giant UnitedHealth Group, caused billing disruptions at pharmacies across the US and\u00a0threatened to put\u00a0some health providers out of business. A third of Americans may have had their personal data swept up in the hack, UnitedHealth CEO Andrew Witty\u00a0estimated\u00a0in testimony to Congress this month. UnitedHealth paid a $22 million ransom to the cybercriminals to try to protect patient data, Witty said. That Change Healthcare hack incensed US lawmakers and prompted questions across the federal government about the vulnerability of America\u2019s health care system to disruptive cyberattacks with cascading impacts \u2014\u00a0questions that the cyberattack on Ascension will do nothing to assuage.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/10/tech/cyberattack-ascension-ambulances-hospitals/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "us_amish-people-rumspringa-explained-cec", "text": "The idea of \u201cRumspringa\u201d has a specific spot in the American imagination. A rite of passage for young people in some Amish communities, Rumspringa is seen by most outsiders as a wild time away from strict Amish rules, when teenagers can experiment with the modern vices of the world. While that may be true for some Amish communities, Rumspringa is actually a much more general \u2014 and generally more tame \u2014 term for an important time of discernment in an Amish youth\u2019s life. Like so many cultural practices, the specifics vary from group to group. This in turn reveals another truth: Amish culture itself is far from a monolith. The basics of Amish culture Before understanding what Rumspringa is, one has to understand the basics of Amish communities in America. The Amish are described by some historians as an ethnoreligious group, meaning their identity is tied to both their religion and their common culture and ancestry. In this case, the Amish are traditional Anabaptists (a specific type of Christianity) with German, Swiss, Dutch and other European roots who are living in the United States. Amish beliefs originated in Switzerland during the Protestant reformation, a time of great change in Christian religious practices during the 16th century. In the early 1700s, Amish people began emigrating from Europe to the United States, settling mostly in the state of Pennsylvania before eventually inhabiting nearby states and parts of southeastern Canada. Amish communities share general beliefs, but their practices may differ depending on region, levels of religious and cultural conservatism and the specific heritage of different communities. Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, has the largest Amish population in the US, numbering around 30,000. Among this population, there are roughly 229 different Amish districts, each with their own subcultures. Generally, their lifestyles are characterized by simple living inspired by an interpretation of the Bible that teaches a rejection of worldly goods and comforts. Amish communities are built around rural activities like farming and handcraft, and the family unit is of utmost importance. It\u2019s not uncommon to see large families living together and sharing community responsibilities. Amish people value traits like obedience, pacifism and humility. Their clothing is plain and they do not wear jewelry or other ornamentations RELATED ARTICLE: What do Mormons believe?  What Rumspringa actually looks like The word \u201cRumspringa\u201d itself is of Pennsylvania German origin, borrowing from the German word \u201cherumspringen,\u201d which means \u201cto run/jump around.\u201d The rite of Rumspringa starts for teens around 16, and is considered a time between childhood and adulthood. During Rumspringa, these teens are usually subjected to fewer rules than younger members of the community, and may partake in activities that would usually be discouraged. Contrary to documentaries and pop culture references that paint Rumspringa as a free-for-all for Amish teens, it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean leaving home for spring break-style partying. In the broadest sense, Amish people use the term to simply describe adolescence. Richard A. Stevick, a professor at Messiah University in Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania, has been an expert on Amish culture for 40 years. He says many teenagers going through the roughly two-year period of Rumspringa don\u2019t leave home or significantly change their behavior during this period. \u201cThe public interest in Rumspringa would be a lot less if books and documentaries didn\u2019t focus on the most extreme examples,\u201d he says. \u201cFor most Amish teenagers, Rumspringa is a time to explore Amish life without being considered under the rule of their parents. Because remember, family and hierarchy are extremely important.\u201d Some young people may take part in sports and social gatherings, or attend functions typically reserved for adults in their community. It\u2019s also, Stevick says, a time for courting and, depending on the community, setting up future marriages. During this time, an Amish teenager may also join a social group of peers within their community. Their Rumspringa experience, then, would be heavily influenced by the type of group they join. The point of Rumspringa, Stevick says, is for young people to make an informed decision about whether they want to commit to the Amish lifestyle as an adult. \u201cJust being born into an Amish community doesn\u2019t qualify one for entry into the Amish lifestyle,\u201d Stevick says. \u201cAdults have to freely choose to be baptized into their communities, and the rite of Rumspringa is the time for that discernment.\u201d The modern challenges of Rumspringa Stevick is particularly interested in how social media and modern thought have influenced the concept of Rumspringa, both for Amish teens and for those curious about this seemingly mysterious rite of passage. \u201cMost youth who move through Rumspringa will go on to enter fully into their communities as adults, but the amount they can learn about the outside world has grown a hundredfold over the last few decades,\u201d he says. \u201cThose who choose to leave could be swayed by modern technologies, but they could also be swayed by what modern technology allows them to learn \u2014 namely, other ways of living or other, more progressive styles of faith.\u201d While it\u2019s hard to find numbers for exactly how many Amish teens leave their communities after Rumspriga, Stevick estimates the numbers overall are low. The stricter the community, he says, the better the retention rate. \u201cThe ones that are in the greatest danger of leaving are the ones that carry phones or somehow get access to phones, because it opens up so many possibilities of understanding the world outside of their tradition,\u201d Stevick says. While this may seem like a recipe for tension and unhappiness, Stevick says, in his decades of working with Amish people, he is continually moved by their strength of spirit, the caring they show toward each other and the overall sense of satisfaction they seem to have in life. \u201cAll groups have people with problems, or people with little conscience,\u201d he says. \u201cBut they live a life full of challenges and joys.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/us/amish-people-rumspringa-explained-cec/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "us"}}

The baby, identified as Davell Gardner, was killed last July on the sidewalk in front of Brooklyn\u2019s Raymond Bush Playground.   Less than a year after that shooting, Dashawn Austin, 25, and Akeem Artis, 24, were arrested and charged in connection with the shooting and Davell\u2019s death. Both men are members of a local street gang called the Hoolies and the violence was motivated by gang rivalry and retaliation, according to the Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez\u2019s office.   Artis was the driver of a car from which Austin and a second shooter, who was not named, exited and then allegedly fired into a crowd attending a cookout on July 12, 2020, according to the indictment. Four people were shot, including the infant. The other victims, all innocent bystanders, survived.  The men are also two of 18 charged in a 63-count indictment for gang-related activity including multiple counts of murder and weapons charges.   CNN is working to confirm the legal representation for the suspects.   Between May 2018 and September 2020, members of the Hoolies gang are accused of committing four murders and eight non-fatal shootings that involved nine victims, according to a new release from Gonzalez\u2019s office.  Seven of the 13 victims were innocent people who were not rivals of the gang, the release said.   \u201cInsidious gang violence as we allege in this case has taken and traumatized far too many lives, including many innocents such as Davell Gardner \u2013 a bright and loved baby boy with his whole life ahead of him,\u201d Gonzalez said.   New York City Police Commissioner Dermot Shea says the alleged gang members were willing to kill \u201cwithout regard for innocent people caught in the crossfire.\u201d   \u201cThis violence has to stop and cases like these are only made more solid when NYPD detectives and Assistant District Attorneys work hand-in-glove to build them from the beginning,\u201d Shea said.

{"id": "2024_05_10_us_college-campus-protests-encampments-cleared", "text": "Pro-Palestinian encampments were cleared from at least three college campuses early Friday, marking some of the latest examples of schools using law enforcement to respond to demonstrations that have popped up across the country in recent weeks. Here are the latest developments: Police tear down tents at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology: Law enforcement began clearing the encampment early Friday, days after the university announced a \u201cset of disciplinary consequences\u201d for students who remained following a deadline to leave. \u201cAll clear\u201d announced at The University of Arizona: \u201cLoud munitions\u201d and \u201cchemical munitions\u201d were used as the school\u2019s police department worked to clear an encampment from campus early Friday, the university said. \u201cA structure made from wooden pallets and other debris was erected on campus property,\u201d a violation of school policy, officials said. The university is set to hold a commencement ceremony Friday evening, according to its website. Police dismantle protest encampment at University of Pennsylvania: Police ordered protesters to leave their encampment Friday morning. The student newspaper\u00a0The Daily Pennsylvanian reported\u00a0that university police gave protesters a two-minute warning to disperse shortly before 6 a.m. The encampment, now cleared, had been up 16 days. Protesters were given multiple warnings and offered the opportunity to voluntarily leave, according to a university spokesperson. About 33 people were\u00a0arrested\u00a0without incident\u00a0and cited for defiant trespass. Police with riot gear and batons were seen moving into the encampment and dismantling tents,\u00a0according to CNN affiliate WPVI. People were seen being taken into custody. The encampment has been taken down and the area closed off for clean up. Philadelphia police, which the university said assisted in the operation, referred questions to Penn police. The police operation came less than 24 hours after Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro called for the encampment to be disbanded, saying the situation at UPenn\u00a0\u201chas gotten even more unstable and out of control.\u201d University of Massachusetts Amherst commencement speaker withdraws: Author Colson Whitehead will no longer speak at the school\u2019s May 18 commencement due to the \u201cevents of May 7 on campus,\u201d the university said in a statement. On Tuesday night into Wednesday, police cleared an encampment and arrested several protesters at the university, CNN previously reported. \u201cWe respect Mr. Whitehead\u2019s position and regret that he will not be addressing the Class of 2024,\u201d UMass Amherst spokesperson Ed Blaguszewski said. The ceremony will now be held without a\u00a0commencement\u00a0speaker, the university said. CNN has reached out to Whitehead for comment. Xavier University cancels UN ambassador\u2019s commencement speech: The HBCU in Louisiana is the second institution to reverse course on inviting US Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield to speak, according to multiple reports. The decision was made in response to a student-led petition expressing anger at US policy supporting Israel in its war against Hamas and its vote against a ceasefire at the UN, university President Reynold Verret said. The New School won\u2019t pursue criminal charges against student protesters: More than 40 people were arrested during a pro-Palestinian demonstration at the New York City university on May 3, CNN has reported. But school officials have asked prosecutors to drop all charges, interim President Donna Shalala said in a message to the university community that also announced the Faculty Senate has asked to reactivate an Advisory Committee on Investor Responsibility. MIT encampment dismantled Demonstrators chanted messages such as, \u201cFree Palestine\u201d as police dismantled the pro-Palestinian encampment on the Cambridge, Massachusetts, campus early Friday, video from CNN affiliate WFXT showed. The university had\u00a0been\u00a0trying this week to clear\u00a0the encampment, and on Monday enacted\u00a0a \u201cset of disciplinary consequences\u201d for students who remained\u00a0after being ordered to peacefully clear the area. On\u00a0Thursday, fewer than 10 students were arrested on campus,\u00a0according to the university.

{"id": "2024_05_09_politics_takeaways-from-day-14-of-the-donald-trump-hush-money-trial", "text": "Former President Donald Trump\u2019s lawyers continued their attack on the credibility of Stormy Daniels for several hours on Thursday, with defense attorney Susan Necheles\u00a0accusing the adult film star of making up the story of having sex with Trump to make money. Daniels pushed back on claims she was untruthful about her sexual encounter with Trump, saying that the story was true, even as she was confronted with inconsistencies in some of the small details of her account. \u201cIf that story was untrue, I would have written it to be a lot better,\u201d Daniels said of her encounter with Trump. One of Trump\u2019s former White House aides later took the stand, testifying about the comings and goings in the West Wing and breaking down in tears about how she lost her job and her book that was highly positive toward the former president. At the end of the day, the proceedings heated back up as Trump\u2019s attorneys argued, out of the presence of the jury, for a mistrial and to lift Trump from the gag order from speaking about Daniels. Judge Juan Merchan denied both motions. Here are the takeaways from Day 14 of the Trump hush money trial: Another day of contentious Stormy Daniels testimony Daniels returned to the witness stand Thursday morning for a second day of cross examination, in which she combatively and defiantly responded to questions from Necheles and insisted her story about her sexual encounter with Trump was true. Trump has denied the affair. Trump\u2019s attorney asked about inconsistencies in interviews Daniels has given about how her dinner with Trump was arranged, whether they had dinner and the notion that she felt threatened by Trump during the encounter. She noted that Daniels saw men and women naked regularly through her work in adult film movies \u2013 questioning why then, allegedly seeing Trump on his bed in boxers and a T-shirt \u201cwas so upsetting that you got light-headed, the blood left your hands and feet and you almost fainted?\u201d \u201cIf I came out of the bathroom and saw an older man in his underwear that I wasn\u2019t expecting to see there, yeah,\u201d Daniels responded. Necheles also asked how she described the encounter, pointing to a prior interview in which she said Trump told her \u201ccome here\u201d and they started kissing on the bed. He did say \u201ccome here,\u201d Daniels said in response. \u201cYou made all this up, right?\u201d Necheles said. \u201cNo,\u201d Daniels responded. Necheles continued again with the insinuation turning to Daniels\u2019 work as a writer of adult films. \u201cYou have a lot of experience of making phony stories about sex appear to be real,\u201d Necheles asked. Wow,\u201d Daniels said with a pause. \u201cThat\u2019s not how I would put it. The sex in the films is very much real just like what happened to me in that room.\u201d Prosecutors, defense spar over Daniels\u2019 financial situation Beyond the details of the alleged encounter itself, Trump\u2019s attorneys and prosecutors had Daniels tell conflicting accounts of her financial situation. Necheles continued to suggest that Daniels was making money off of saying she had sex with Trump, pointing to a tweet where she said she\u2019d earned $1 million and others where she directed her supporters to her online store after Trump was indicted. \u201cYou\u2019re celebrating the indictment by selling things from your store,\u201d Necheles asked. \u201cNot unlike Mr. Trump,\u201d Daniels responded. Trump\u2019s attorney also questioned Daniels about her \u201cMake America Horny Again\u201d strip club tour in 2018 \u2013 showing posters she had promoted \u2013 and about the money she made through an NBC documentary, in which the filmmakers paid for the rights to her book. During re-direct, prosecutors had Daniels recount how telling her story has also cost her, from having to move her daughter and hire security to the lawyers\u2019 fees she was ordered to pay after she sued Trump and lost. \u201cOn balance has your publicly telling the truth about your experiences with Mr. Trump been net positive or net negative in your life?\u201d \u201cNegative,\u201d Daniels said. Former Trump aide describes inner White House operations Former White House aide Madeleine Westerhout described the inner-workings of Trump\u2019s West Wing, where she worked for more than two years sitting just outside the Oval Office. Westerhout \u00a0was asked about a list of Trump\u2019s contacts she received from his longtime Trump Organization assistant Rhona Graff \u2013 a list that included everyone from television news personalities like Joe Scarborough and Jeanine Pirro (who was at the courthouse Thursday) to sports legends Serena Williams and Tom Brady. Eventually working at a desk with a direct line of sight to the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office, Westerhout explained how she learned Trump\u2019s work habits. Trump liked sharpies, for instance, and printouts of documents. He preferred the Oxford comma. And the former president, she said, \u201cliked speaking to people in person or on the phone.\u201d Asked how many people Trump would typically speak to in a day, she couldn\u2019t cite a specific number. \u201cA lot,\u201d Westerhout said. He would take calls as early as 6 a.m. and \u201clate into the night\u201d after she had gone to bed, she testified. The prosecution walked Westerhout through the checks she would receive from the Trump Org. in New York, in which she described bringing Trump a manilla envelope of checks each month to sign. She then sent them back to New York. Westerhout did not testify to direct knowledge of the checks that Trump signed to his former fixer Michael Cohen, which are cited in the charges that Trump falsified business records, but her story did add one more voice to the prosecution\u2019s narrative that Trump was involved in signing of the checks in 2017. When asked to explain how she left the White House in 2019, Westerhout testified that she said some things she shouldn\u2019t have and that she was \u201cvery regretful of my youthful indiscretion.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve grown a lot since then,\u201d she said as she started crying. She was still sniffling as defense started cross examination, in which Necheles asked Westerhout about the book she wrote after leaving the White House, \u201cOff the Record.\u201d Westerhout said she \u201cthought it was real important to share with the American people the man that I got to know.\u201d \u201cPresident Trump forgave you, right?\u201d Necheles asked. \u201cHe did,\u201d\u202fWesterhout\u202fsaid. \u201cHe was a really good boss.\u201d Westerhout also offered jurors a contrast to Daniels\u2019 account, testifying that Trump was close to his wife Melania and his family. The former president smiled as she described Melania Trump often texting her, \u201cMadeline, it\u2019s past dinner time. When is my husband coming home?\u201d Trump doesn\u2019t get carve-out from gag order Trump\u2019s lawyers asked Merchan both to declare a mistrial and modify the gag order against him after Daniels was off the stand. The judge rejected both requests. Trump attorney Todd Blanche asked for Trump to be allowed to publicly defend himself against Daniels\u2019 allegations, arguing the former president currently is forced to stay silent in response to the suggestion that there was a non-consensual sexual encounter between her and Trump. Blanche argued that Daniels has changed her story by suggesting that this \u201ccompletely made-up encounter with President Trump may not have been consensual.\u201d Yet, Blanche said, \u201che is not allowed to say \u2018I did not do that\u2019\u201d for voters who are seeing media coverage of the testimony. Merchan denied the request, saying he must protect the integrity of the proceedings and he doesn\u2019t trust Trump not to violate an order if he were to modify it. \u201cThe reason why the gag order is in place to begin with is precisely because of the nature of these attacks, the vitriol,\u201d Merchan said. \u201cThese were very real, very threatening attacks on potential witnesses.\u201d \u201cYour client\u2019s track record speaks for itself here \u2013 I can\u2019t take your word for it\u201d that Trump will stick to disputing the facts, the judge also said. Merchan denies another mistrial motion Merchan also denied Trump\u2019s renewed motion for a mistrial over the salacious testimony Daniels gave that his attorneys say unfairly prejudices the jury against Trump. The judge said Trump\u2019s outright denial of the incident and his legal team\u2019s attack on her credibility opened the door for prosecutors to bring in Daniels\u2019 testimony that turned salacious. \u201cThe more specificity Ms. Daniels can provide about the encounter, the more the jury can weigh whether the encounter did occur and if so whether they choose to credit Ms. Daniels\u2019 story,\u201d Merchan said. Merchan pointed the finger at Necheles who opted not to object to several salacious lines of questioning that the defense later used as reasons the judge should declare a mistrial. Blanche argued that Daniels\u2019 testimony at trial was a new version of the alleged events \u2013 a point Merchan disagreed with. Prosecutor Josh Steinglass said Trump was aware of the \u201cmessy details\u201d of the encounter in 2016 and that shows motive for the hush money payment and cover up. Blanche argued that the level of detail prosecutors elicited from Daniels went too far. But Merchan said \u201cdetails like items in the bathroom, the weight of the furniture,\u201d add a \u201csense of credibility if the jury chooses to believe them,\u201d even as he acknowledged there were some details he would have preferred stayed out.

{"id": "2024_05_08_us_houston-police-chief-retires-suspended-investigations", "text": "Houston\u2019s police chief unexpectedly retired from the force\u00a0Tuesday\u00a0night amid questions about a department policy that allowed hundreds of thousands of\u00a0cases\u00a0to be suspended, including sexual abuse cases,\u00a0according to the mayor\u2019s office. Troy Finner had served as the chief of the Houston Police Department since 2021, capping off a 34-year career with the department. \u201cI consider Troy Finner a friend. It was tough to accept his retirement, but it was in the best interest of Houstonians,\u201d Houston\u00a0Mayor John Whitmire\u00a0said\u00a0in an impromptu news conference Wednesday. The retirement announcement came hours after an internal email obtained by CNN affiliate KHOU showed Finner referring to an investigation being suspended due to \u201clack of personnel,\u201d in 2018, three years before he had said he was aware of the policy. Finner was executive assistant chief over patrol operations at the time the email was written. At a February news conference, Finner said he didn\u2019t know about the practice until 2021, the year he became chief, when he ordered the department\u2019s Special Victims Division to stop using the \u201clack of personnel\u201d code to suspended investigations. Finner\u00a0said\u00a0in April\u00a0the police department\u00a0had made progress\u00a0reviewing\u00a0about 264,000 investigations that\u00a0were suspended since 2016 citing only lack of personnel. More than 4,000 of those cases involved allegations of adult sex crimes.\u00a0An independent review committee is also investigating. In a\u00a0statement\u00a0issued\u00a0Tuesday\u00a0night after the KHOU report aired, Finner said, \u201cI have always been truthful and have never set out to mislead anyone about anything, including this investigation.\u201d The outgoing chief said he did not know about the \u201csuspended lack of personnel\u201d codes used\u00a0by Houston police\u00a0at the time, despite it being mentioned in the email. Finner\u2019s\u00a0statement promised he would \u201caddress the media and the public\u201d once the investigation was complete. The mayor informed the city council of Finner\u2019s retirement later that night. Larry Satterwhite was appointed acting police chief by Whitmire Wednesday. Satterwhite served as executive assistant chief under Finner. The mayor declined to say whether he had asked for Finner\u2019s retirement. \u201cIt was affecting operations at HPD. That\u2019s the bottom line,\u201d Whitmire\u00a0told reporters\u00a0Wednesday. \u201cI dealt with it because it was a distraction to the mission of the men and women in HPD.\u201d Finner did not immediately respond to a request for comment from CNN. As of\u00a0Wednesday afternoon, the police department had not officially announced the change of leadership.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/08/us/houston-police-chief-retires-suspended-investigations/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_05_07_us_delaware-state-university-shooting-arrests", "text": "Two men have been arrested in connection with the killing of Camay Mitchell De Silva, an 18-year-old woman who was fatally shot last month during a nearby argument at the dorms of Delaware State University, police in Dover said Monday. De Silva, who was not a student there, was shot during an altercation between two groups of men on the campus \u2013 and had not been the intended target of the gunfire, authorities say. She was on campus visiting her best friend, family members told CNN affiliate WPVI.  Destry Jones, 20, and Damien Hinson, 18, were arrested last week and have each been charged with one count of first-degree murder, two counts of first-degree attempted murder, one count of first-degree conspiracy and two firearm-related charges. \u201cCamay\u2019s family has been in our thoughts from the moment this senseless act of violence occurred and our hope is that these apprehensions can help begin the process of healing,\u201d Dover Police Chief Thomas Johnson Jr. said in a release. The suspects are not students at the university and are not affiliated with the school, police said. It is unclear if either man has obtained an attorney. The shooting unfolded shortly after 1:30 a.m. on April 21, according to police. Dover police officers heard what they believed to be gunshots, and around the same time, the university\u2019s police department received a report of shots fired on campus. Another call reported a woman was on the ground near some dormitories, the department said. Responding officers found De Silva with a gunshot wound to her head, near a breezeway that connects two sections of a dorm. She was taken to a nearby hospital but died of her injuries, authorities said. Investigators believe Jones and Hinson were involved in a physical altercation outside a dormitory with two other men, police said. Jones and Hinson \u201cdisengaged from the physical fight and took part in firing the shots that claimed the life of Miss De Silva,\u201d police alleged. \u201cMiss De Silva was not involved in this altercation and we do not believe she was the intended target of the gunfire which originated from the breezeway area,\u201d Dover police said. Jones, who was arrested Thursday in New York, is awaiting extradition on his charges, and Hinson, who was arrested Thursday in Dover, is in custody with cash bail set at more than $3 million, police said. A mass shooting forced De Silva to flee another college De Silva\u2019s family members described her as encouraging, smart and comical, and said she intended to pursue a career in cybersecurity, WPVI reported. De Silva started college last year at Morgan State University in Baltimore, but a shooting there in October 2023 that left five people injured frightened her so much that she decided to go closer to home, according to WPVI. \u201cThe day she was at Morgan State and they had an unfortunate shooting there, she let us all know she was OK.

{"id": "2024_05_08_us_george-washington-university-protesters-arrested", "text": "The Metropolitan Police Department in Washington, DC, cleared out a pro-Palestinian encampment on George Washington University\u2019s campus early Wednesday and arrested 30 protesters there and three others in a separate altercation, Metro Police Chief Pamela A. Smith said. The action took place hours before Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser and Smith were set to testify at Congress for the House Oversight Committee on the response to the encampment. Yet after police cleared the encampment, House Oversight Chair James Comer, a Republican from Kentucky, announced the hearing was canceled and took credit for spurring action. \u201cI am pleased that the potential Oversight hearing led to swift action by Mayor Bowser and MPD Chief Smith. We will continue to hold DC officials accountable to ensure our nation\u2019s capital is safe for all,\u201d Comer said in a statement. GW is one of a number of universities across the country at which pro-Palestinian protesters have set up unauthorized camps and demonstrated against Israel\u2019s war in Gaza and US support for the country. Police have arrested more than 2,400 people on US campuses since mid-April amid polarized debates over the right to protest, the limits of free speech and accusations of antisemitism. GW\u2019s encampment was set up about two weeks ago in the University Yard, a grassy square on campus surrounded by a food hall and university buildings. A partner community of tents spread on the neighboring public street, and the two demonstrations merged after protesters, in an act of defiance, removed metal barriers erected around the initial encampment. The encampment has drawn criticism from GW President Ellen Granberg, who said it was \u201cunauthorized,\u201d disrupted normal academic activities and created safety concerns. Early Wednesday morning, Metro Police said in a statement they had \u201cworked to pursue non-arrest methods to deescalate tensions\u201d to protect students and the GW campus, but there has been a \u201cgradual escalation in the volatility of the protest.\u201d \u201cTherefore, this morning, working closely with the GW administration and police, MPD moved to disperse the demonstrators from the GW campus and surrounding streets,\u201d police said. Police said the arrests were for assault on a police officer and unlawful entry. Officers deployed pepper spray three times Smith said there were signs Monday that the demonstration was becoming \u201cmore volatile and less stable,\u201d highlighting an assault reported to GW Police, the presence of \u201ccovert\u201d counter-protesters in the crowd, students from other universities joining the encampment and \u201citems that could potentially be used for offensive and defensive weapons \u2026 being gathered.\u201d Protesters were given six warnings to disperse, and many complied,\u00a0Smith said. As police cleared the encampment, officers deployed pepper spray during a skirmish at a nearby intersection, Smith told reporters. MPD Executive Assistant Chief Jeffery Carroll said law enforcement used pepper spray three times as demonstrators tried to push past officers to reach other people who had been arrested. GW was notified that police were going to clear the protest encampment when GW Police Department\u2019s chief got a call from MPD at 1:30 a.m. Wednesday, according to a source with knowledge of the school and police communications. The university issued a statement midday Wednesday describing the police action as \u201corderly and safe.\u201d \u201cWe do not have any reports of serious injuries during this operation, and we are grateful for MPD\u2019s assistance in this matter,\u201d GW said. Ahmed El Masry, a demonstrator at the GW encampment, said he left the encampment at about 2 a.m. but rushed back about two hours later when he heard police were working to clear the space. He said that when he arrived, he found \u201cover 20\u201d police cars and said, \u201cIt looked like a warzone.\u201d \u201cI come back at 4, and the whole camp is gone, and I\u2019m seeing people that I protested with \u2026 being rounded up in vans,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m angry, like we\u2019ve been here peacefully protesting,\u201d he said. \u201cThis was our camp\u2026 It became a community, like we were here speaking up for something noble.\u201d Dante O\u2019Hara, a lead organizer of DC for Ceasefire Now Coalition, a group critical of Israel\u2019s war in Gaza, issued a statement calling on the House Oversight Committee to halt military aid to Israel. \u201cCongress is creating this crisis. Pressuring local elected officials and university leaders to increase police action deflects from Congress\u2019s own responsibility for causing the protests like at GWU,\u201d O\u2019Hara said. The university is open and final exams will go on as scheduled, but police and security personnel will maintain a presence on University Yard and the surrounding area, the school said. The yard will remain closed through the end of commencement on May 19. Police action at UMass-Amherst and FIT Also Tuesday night into Wednesday, police cleared out encampments and arrested protesters at the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York City and at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst. At FIT, 50 people were arrested on Tuesday evening after a large crowd gathered outside the school during a pro-Palestinian protest, according to the NYPD. The arrests came after the school issued a 7 p.m. deadline \u2013 later extended to 9 p.m. \u2013 to dismantle an encampment in the school\u2019s courtyard and end the occupation of the school museum\u2019s lobby, according to a statement from FIT President Joyce F. Brown. Before the deadline, spokespeople for the protesting students called for a rally in front of the school, and a group of protesters heeded their call, according to Brown. \u201cThe NYPD maintained crowd control and tried to ensure that the rally did not escalate further. However, as expected, the insistence by some students to continue the occupation resulted in further action by the NYPD,\u201d Brown said. The NYPD was not able to confirm how many of those arrested were students. The UMass-Amherst arrests occurred after the chancellor\u00a0asked police to dismantle an encampment, the Massachusetts Daily Collegian reported. \u201cMoments ago, I asked the University of Massachusetts Police Department to begin dispersing the crowd and dismantling the encampment. Let me be clear \u2013 involving law enforcement is the absolute last resort,\u201d wrote Chancellor Javier Reyes\u00a0in a message to students obtained by the paper. In a Wednesday statement obtained by CNN affiliate WGGB, Reyes called the decision to bring in police a \u201cdifficult\u201d one, but said it was guided by values of \u201csafety and well-being of our students and other members of our campus community.\u201d According to the chancellor\u2019s statement, 132 people were arrested \u2013 70 of whom were UMass Amherst students and 6 of whom were faculty.  \u201cI know how challenging these events have been for everyone. Safety, wellbeing, and a sense of belonging are paramount for our community\u2019s ability to thrive, and I recognize that there is work to do as we restore trust with those who feel harmed by the university\u2019s actions,\u201d the statement added. CNN is reaching out to Reyes\u2019 office for a copy of the statement.  At universities across the country, police have used a range of tactics to disperse demonstrators from occupied school buildings and take down on-campus encampments. Law enforcement experts told CNN police have been largely measured in their approach and showed restraint in using force \u2013 a direct result of lessons learned during the widespread protests after the police killing of George Floyd nearly four years ago.

{"id": "2024_05_10_politics_biden-challenges-2024-analysis", "text": "If Joe Biden wins a second term later this year, he will have defied one of the most complex political environments for a president seeking reelection in years. At home and abroad, he is facing the kind of headwinds that would normally cast severe doubt on his chances of convincing voters that they should send him back to the White House. Biden\u2019s difficult dynamic was on show in an exclusive interview with CNN this week, in the swing state of Wisconsin, which he only won by around 20,000 votes in 2020 and that could be decisive again in November. The president is facing wars in the Middle East and Ukraine that carry a constant threat of escalation and repeatedly throw up challenges to his credibility as a leader. At home, Biden is beset by campus protests triggered by the Israeli offensive in Gaza and a revolt by some progressive and young voters vital to his coalition. More broadly, the electorate isn\u2019t yet buying his \u201cmorning in America\u201d vibe. They\u2019re suffering from high prices and interest rates that confound his reassurances that the economy is in great shape and mask a strong legislative record that stands comparison with any recent president. Then there\u2019s the challenge of being the oldest president in history, running for a second term that would end when he is 86. Biden\u2019s saving grace, however, may be that Donald Trump \u2013 his opponent in a 2020 election rematch that Americans have repeatedly told pollsters they don\u2019t want \u2013 may be saddled with even more vulnerabilities than he is. Trump spent this week in a Manhattan court listening to embarrassing testimony about an alleged liaison he had with an adult film star in 2006 that is now at the center of a hush money trial. New York prosecutors claim he falsified business records to hide a payment to Stormy Daniels in an early act of election interference in 2016. He\u2019s denied the affair and pleaded not guilty in the case. Trump also has a habit of alienating the key suburban voters likely to decide which of the two one-term presidents wins a second mandate in November. His recent warnings that he couldn\u2019t rule out violence after the 2024 election, and his refusal to say he\u2019d accept the result, revived dark memories of his attempt to steal the 2020 election and underscored his fundamental threat to democracy. Trump\u2019s base voters have no problems either with his criminal trials or his false claims that he was cheated out of office. But the most recent midterm and presidential elections suggest that he does scare off large sectors of the general electorate. Trump has also talked himself into a difficult corner on abortion \u2013 one of the few issues where Biden outpolls him and which Democrats believe could enthuse their voters and produce the kind of turnout that could swamp the ex-president in November. Trump\u2019s role in building a generational conservative majority on the Supreme Court is coming back to haunt him after the justices overturned the constitutional right to an abortion. While Trump insists the issue must be left to the states, it\u2019s offering Democrats an opening every time a Republican legislature or conservative court delivers an extreme new anti-abortion measure or decision. Israel may be far from the biggest worry for Trump\u2019s campaign Polls consistently show that voters care most about the economy. And the president\u2019s ratings on the issue are underwater. A CNN poll in April showed that Biden had a 34% rating on the economy \u2014 and 29% on inflation \u2014 as voters say economic concerns are more important to them when choosing a candidate than they were in each of the past two presidential elections. And voters who say the economy is very important to their vote backed Trump over Biden 62% to 30%. This deficit for the president comes despite three years of solid growth and job creation numbers. But inflation, a corrosive political force that can ruin political careers and that only voters who remember the early 1980s have experienced before, has bequeathed a period of high interest rates. This is proving punishing to home and car buyers, for instance. And many Americans still get a shock every time they go to the grocery store. In his interview with CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett, the president pushed back on the notion that the economy is in poor shape while expressing some understanding for the pain caused by high prices. But he was still defensive on the issue \u2014 recalling some previous presidents who appeared irked that voters weren\u2019t appreciating their efforts. Asked by Burnett when he would restore consumer confidence, Biden replied: \u201cWe have already turned it around,\u201d then added, \u201cThe polling data has been wrong all along. You guys do a poll at CNN. How many folks you have to call to get one response? The idea that we\u2019re in a situation where things are so bad \u2026 we have created more jobs. We have made \u2013 we\u2019re in a situation where people have access to good-paying jobs.\u201d Biden has also balked at Trump\u2019s efforts to conjure nostalgia for the economy in his first term \u2013 before jobs and growth went into free fall during a once-in-a-century pandemic. \u201cLet me say it this way, when I started this administration, people were saying there\u2019s going to be a collapse of the economy. We have the strongest economy in the world. Let me say it again, in the world,\u201d the president said. But telling voters things are great when they don\u2019t feel they are is a questionable political strategy. Any time a president looks like he isn\u2019t fully in touch with the reality of voters\u2019 lives, he\u2019s on dangerous ground. In 1992, for instance, President George H.W. Bush was running for reelection. He was asked in a campaign debate, \u201cHow can you find a cure for the economic problems of the common people if you have no experience of what is ailing them?\u201d Bush got off to a bad start by looking at his watch, making it look like he\u2019d rather be anywhere else in the world. He then offered a halting and confusing answer that ended with: \u201cOf course you feel it when you are president of the United States and that is why I am trying to do something about it.\u201d His rival, Bill Clinton, then stood up and gave a national audience a taste of his burning \u201cfeel your pain\u201d political talent. He directly addressed the questioner, said that as Arkansas governor he knew by name many people who lost their jobs, and told the nation: \u201cThis decision better be about what kind of economic theory you want. Not just people saying I want to go fix it.\u201d A few months later, Clinton was in the White House. Biden has more time than Bush to convince voters that better economic times are ahead, and he\u2019d be considerably helped if the Federal Reserve begins to ease rates in the summer. He\u2019s been contrasting his own humble origins with Trump\u2019s billionaire lifestyle in recent weeks, trying to puncture the idea that the ex-president cares more about working Americans than he does, while warning his predecessor would destroy the Affordable Care Act if he gets back in the Oval Office. \u201cI look at it from a position \u2013 not being facetious \u2013 from a Scranton perspective,\u201d Biden told Burnett. \u201cHe looks at it from a Mar-a-Lago perspective. He wants to give more significant tax cuts to the super wealthy.\u201d And Biden is fortunate in that he faces a rival with his own massive liabilities, rather than a young rising star with a gift for coining a middle-class economic narrative like Clinton. Biden\u2019s path becomes even more complex But if anything, the president\u2019s path to reelection is becoming even more complicated.\u00a0He\u2019s now locked in a showdown with the prime minister of Israel \u2014 always a treacherous proposition for US leaders. This crisis risks playing into Trump\u2019s contention that the world and the nation is spinning out of control and needs a strongman to fix it. The fracture with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu occurred after the president warned in the CNN interview that he would halt the transfer of some weapons to Israel if it went ahead with a major offensive into the Gazan city of Rafah. Biden has been under enormous pressure from progressive activists, supporters on Capitol Hill and Arab American voters in the key swing state of Michigan to rein in Netanyahu after the deaths of many thousands of Palestinian civilians in Israel\u2019s war against Hamas following the October 7 terror attacks that killed 1,200 people. Campus protests have, meanwhile, caught Biden between young and progressive voters who are furious with his support for Israel in the war, and moderates who might be susceptible to his predecessor\u2019s chaos narrative. It\u2019s not clear that heated Republicans attacks on Biden over Israel Thursday will seriously wound him with his own voters. But the tone of the criticism bolstered a wider Republican narrative that Biden is weak and incapable of stabilizing an increasingly restless world. \u201cThat\u2019s a failure of leadership. That is cowardice, that is answering, trying to make a political calculus here that it helps him get out from underwater,\u201d Republican Sen. Thom Tillis said. The North Carolinian\u2019s colleague from Missouri, GOP Sen. Josh Hawley, added: \u201cThis is the message to our allies that, you know, if it\u2019s politically inconvenient for the president to send you arms then, you know, sorry, you\u2019re on your own.\u201d Biden has tried to insulate himself from the political impact of the protests with centrist voters by arguing that while the right to demonstrate is constitutionally guaranteed, any property damage from students occupying college buildings is unacceptable. And in a speech on Capitol Hill memorializing victims of the Holocaust earlier this week, he condemned examples of antisemitism reported at some of the protests. He warned that too many people were \u201cdenying, downplaying, rationalizing and ignoring the horrors of the Holocaust and October 7.\u201d Still, polls show that the Israel-Hamas conflict is well down the list of issues that most concern voters \u2014 including the young voters most often cited as deserting Biden in droves over the conflict. But in an election that could come down to thousands of votes in a few states, the potential for defections or no shows from angry Democratic voters is an alarming one for the president.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/10/politics/biden-challenges-2024-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_05_09_us_roger-forston-florida-airman-shot", "text": "A Florida sheriff publicly released bodycam footage from a deputy who fatally shot a Black airman in his home last week \u2013 and disputed claims from the victim\u2019s family that the deputy had gone to the wrong apartment. Okaloosa County Sheriff Eric Aden showed the video during a Thursday news conference,  shortly after an attorney for the 23-year-old airman\u2019s family called for its public release, saying the victim\u2019s girlfriend was FaceTiming with him and believes the deputy was at the wrong unit. The victim was identified by his family as Roger Fortson, an \u200bactive-duty senior airman, according to attorney Ben Crump, who held a news conference earlier Thursday. Crump and Fortson\u2019s mother described him as a patriot who respected authority and hoped to buy his mother and younger siblings a house. The sheriff, who met with Fortson\u2019s family shortly before his news conference, said he asked the Florida Department of Law Enforcement Division to handle the criminal investigation, as is required. While that probe is ongoing, he said, \u201cno determination has been made as to whether the deputy\u2019s actions were justified or not.\u201d The deputy has been placed on administrative leave. \u201cWhat we do know at this time is that the deputy did announce himself, not once but twice,\u201d Aden said. \u201cMr. Fortson\u2019s comments indicate that he did acknowledge it was law enforcement at the door and he arrived at the door with a firearm in his hand. The deputy knocked on the correct door, he did not cover the peephole or otherwise obscured its view in any way.\u201d But Fortson\u2019s family reiterated their belief that authorities went to the wrong door. \u201cWe remain adamant that the police had the wrong apartment as Roger was on the phone with his girlfriend for a substantial amount of time leading up to the shooting, and no one else was in the apartment,\u201d Fortson\u2019s family said in a statement following the release of the footage. What the bodycam footage shows Deputies responded last Friday to an apartment after receiving a call for \u201ca disturbance in progress,\u201d Aden said in a previous statement. \u201cHearing sounds of a disturbance, (a deputy) reacted in self-defense after he encountered a 23-year-old man armed with a gun and after the deputy had identified himself as law enforcement,\u201d the sheriff said. \u201cThe deputy shot the man, who later succumbed to his injuries,\u201d said the sheriff. The deputy involved in the shooting has not been identified by officials. The bodycam footage, dated May 3, begins at roughly 4:28 p.m. with a deputy arriving at what appears to be an apartment complex. A woman at the complex is heard telling the deputy there was a\u00a0disturbance in\u00a0apartment 1401 and that it was \u201cgetting out of hand.\u201d The same woman tells the deputy she previously walked by the apartment and heard yells and \u201ca slap,\u201d but added she wasn\u2019t sure where it came from. The deputy takes the elevator to the fourth floor and knocks on a door three times. The\u00a0apartment\u00a0number \u201c1401\u201d is visible in the footage. He announces himself twice, saying, \u201cSheriff\u2019s office, open the door.\u201d\u00a0There is nothing heard on the footage from inside the apartment. Within seconds of the apartment\u2019s door opening, the deputy says \u201cstep back\u201d and is\u00a0then\u00a0seen firing his weapon. Fortson is seen standing at the door with his hands down and what appears to be a lowered firearm in his right hand. He immediately falls to the floor as the deputy fires. At least\u00a0five\u00a0shots are heard. While Fortson is on the floor, the deputy yells \u201cdrop the gun\u201d twice. Fortson is heard saying, \u201cIt\u2019s over there,\u201d and then, \u201cI don\u2019t have it.\u201d The deputy continues to point his weapon at Fortson and tells him not to move, while Fortson remains on the floor. The deputy continues pointing his weapon at Fortson while calling for EMS. Deputies communicated with dispatch that Fortson had been shot six times with multiple gunshot wounds to the chest with one exit wound, according to police dispatch calls, obtained by CNN affiliate WEAR. Fortson\u2019s family said after the video\u2019s release, \u201cIt is very troubling that the deputy gave no verbal commands and shot multiple times within a split second of the door being opened, killing Roger.\u201d \u201cAs the officer didn\u2019t tell Roger to drop the weapon before shooting, was the officer trained to give verbal warnings? Did the officer try to initiate life-saving measures? Was the officer trained to deal with law-abiding citizens who are registered gun owners?\u201d their statement added. Footage released from FaceTime call during shooting Later Thursday, Crump also released nearly four minutes of the FaceTime call he says Fortson was on with his girlfriend when he was shot. The video shows what appears to be the ceiling of an apartment as a man \u2013 presumably Fortson \u2013 can be heard\u00a0groaning and\u00a0saying, \u201cI can\u2019t breathe.\u201d Another man \u2013 presumably\u00a0the\u00a0deputy \u2013 tells him: \u201cDo not move. Stop movin\u2019.\u201d The deputy can then be heard saying, \u201cHang on man, we\u2019ve got an ambulance comin\u2019 for you. Don\u2019t move.\u201d Presumably speaking\u00a0to others, the deputy then says, \u201cWe\u2019re good. He had a gun since he opened the door.\u201d\u00a0The deputy is heard shouting but much of it is inaudible. Another person can later be heard detailing Fortson\u2019s wounds saying, \u201cWe\u2019ve got three gunshot wounds, one exit,\u201d before another voice says, \u201cYeah, he\u2019s shot up.\u201d Eventually, someone is heard saying Fortson has six gunshot wounds. Fortson was pronounced dead\u00a0at a hospital. Fortson was playing video games, family attorney says In their earlier news conference Thursday, Crump and Fortson\u2019s mother described him as a responsible young man and a patriot who had long dreamed of serving in the US Air Force. \u201cTo the sheriff\u2019s department that took my gift \u2026 I need you guys to tell the truth about my son. I need you to get his reputation right,\u201d Fortson\u2019s mother said. \u201cI know my son did not do anything to you guys. If he scared you, or if you guys wasn\u2019t trained properly, I apologize,\u201d she said. \u201cBut please clean my baby\u2019s reputation.\u201d Fortson entered active duty in November 2019 and was assigned to the 4th Special Operations Squadron, according to a statement from the Air Force, which noted the shooting occurred at the airman\u2019s off-base residence. US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin is \u201cclosely\u201d following the reports of the shooting, Pentagon spokesperson Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder said Thursday. Crump said the 23-year-old had been home for about 30 minutes and playing video games prior to the shooting. Fortson heard two separate knocks at the door and when no one could be seen through the peephole, he retrieved his gun, Crump said, citing Fortson\u2019s girlfriend. Crump said Fortson\u2019s gun was legally owned. The girlfriend said law enforcement responded to the wrong apartment, and there was no disturbance there at the time, Crump said. Fortson was alone at the time, Crump said, citing Fortson\u2019s girlfriend. \u201c(Fortson) was on the phone with his girlfriend in the apartment by himself with his dog,\u201d Crump told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper Thursday evening. \u201cThey had the wrong apartment.\u201d Shooting calls to mind past incidents While details about the shooting remain murky, the incident echoes other shootings in recent years, in which a Black man or woman was killed by law enforcement in their home. In 2019, a former Dallas police officer was sentenced to 10 years in prison after\u00a0fatally shooting Botham Jean\u00a0in his apartment the year prior. The officer \u2013 off duty but still in uniform \u2013 lived on the floor below Jean\u2019s and said she approached what she believed to be her own apartment when she saw Jean inside. Atatiana Jefferson was killed that same year when a Fort Worth officer, responding to what police believed to be a burglary, shot her through her bedroom window. The former Fort Worth officer was\u00a0sentenced to nearly 12 years in prison\u00a0in 2022.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/09/us/roger-forston-florida-airman-shot/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "us"}}

Jose Antonio Ibarra, 26, was indicted on 10 counts in all: malice murder, three counts of felony murder, kidnapping with bodily injury, aggravated assault with intent to rape, aggravated battery, obstructing a person making an emergency call, tampering with evidence and peeping Tom, according to the indictment. Riley, a 22-year-old Augusta University College of Nursing student, was killed on February\u00a022 while out for a run on the University of Georgia\u2019s campus. Ibarra struck Riley in the head with a rock multiple times and asphyxiated her, according to the indictment. In addition, he was charged under Georgia\u2019s \u201cpeeping Tom\u201d law for allegedly going to a University of Georgia apartment building on the same day as the murder, looking through the window and spying on a student, the indictment states. Ibarra was arrested a day later and had been charged with\u00a0felony murder, false imprisonment and kidnapping and concealing the death of another, according to jail records. The public defender\u2019s office representing Ibarra declined to comment on the indictment. Ibarra, of Athens, Georgia, is an undocumented immigrant from Venezuela who was not a university student. Investigators said there was no evidence they knew each other, and police described the killing as a \u201cvery isolated incident.\u201d The killing and suspect\u2019s immigration status renewed debate on the country\u2019s immigration policies at the highest level. President Joe Biden held up a pin with Riley\u2019s name on it at the State of the Union address in March. \u201cLaken Riley, an innocent young woman who was killed by an illegal. That\u2019s right, but how many thousands of people are killed by legals?\u201d Biden said. \u201cTo her parents, I say, my heart goes out to you, having lost children myself, I understand.\u201d He later told MSNBC he should have used the term \u201cundocumented\u201d rather than \u201cillegal.\u201d Spurred by the killing, Georgia officials signed into law immigration enforcement legislation last week. The law requires local and state law officials to verify the immigration status of those over the age of 18 who have been arrested, those in detention or those who an \u201cofficer has probable cause to believe\u201d have committed a crime. Many researchers crunching the numbers\u00a0have found there\u2019s no connection\u00a0between immigration and crime. Some have even found that immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than people born in the US.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/08/us/laken-riley-killing-indictment/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "us"}}

The 213-million-pound Dali cargo ship veered off course on March 26 and plowed into a pillar of the Francis Scott Key Bridge, killing six construction workers, destroying the key thoroughfare and crippling the economy at the Port of Baltimore. Now, after the discovery of the final construction worker lost in the tragedy, crews will proceed with the next step in removing the massive debris and freeing the nearly 1,000-foot vessel. \u201cThe safest and swiftest method to remove the bridge piece from on top of the M/V Dali is by precision cuts made with small charges,\u201d according to Unified Command, which includes state and federal agencies responding to the disaster. \u201cThis is an industry-standard tool in controlled demolition that will break the span into smaller pieces, which will allow the work of refloating the vessel and removing it from the federal channel.\u201d The removal is expected to take place Saturday, though \u201cthe exact time of the precision cuts will depend on multiple environmental and operational factors,\u201d Unified Command said.

{"id": "2024_05_08_us_antisemitism-hearing-schools", "text": "David Banks, the chancellor of New York City Public Schools, said at a congressional hearing Wednesday that his district has removed, disciplined or is in the process of disciplining at least a dozen staff and school leaders over alleged antisemitism, pushing back strongly against Republicans\u2019 accusations that the school system was failing to take action for hate speech and incidents against Jewish students and faculty. \u201cKeeping schools safe is in my DNA,\u201d Banks testified at a hearing held by the House Subcommittee on Early Childhood, Elementary and Secondary Education. \u201cWhen antisemitism rears its head, I believe we must respond. And we have.\u201d Banks said the discipline against faculty includes removing a principal in the middle of the school year. He added that New York City Public Schools has suspended at least 30 students, called in the New York City Police Department when necessary and retrained all 1,600 principals on the discipline code. Banks added that suspending students and faculty alone won\u2019t solve the problem, stressing that engagement with the community and teaching are crucial. \u201cThe true antidote is to teach,\u201d he said. Banks was combative in his tone, frequently talking over and correcting members of Congress who accused New York school system of doing too little to fight antisemitism. He questioned Republicans\u2019 motivations for the hearing and urged Congress to take steps to \u201cbring us together\u201d to find solutions to fight hate beyond just holding hearings. \u201cThis convening, for too many Americans in education, feels like the ultimate gotcha moment,\u201d Banks said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t sound like people who are actually trying to solve for something that, I believe, we should be doing everything we can solve for.\u201d Avoiding past mistakes Banks\u2019 testimony highlighted a two-hour-long grilling of the leaders of three school districts in liberal cities about alleged antisemitic incidents. It marked the first such Congressional hearing to focus on K-12 schools. His fiery demeanor avoided the past mistakes of Ivy League school presidents who have also been hauled before Congress for tough questioning on campus antisemitism. The presidents of Harvard University and the University of Pennsylvania were toppled in the wake of a December hearing after failing to say whether calls on campus for genocide of Jews would violate school rules. By contrast, Columbia\u2019s president last month was criticized by many faculty and students for being overly conciliatory to demands of right-wing members of Congress. Wednesday\u2019s hearing gave Republicans a chance to confront officials from New York City; Berkeley, California; and Montgomery County, Maryland, about reports of antisemitism in their districts. It\u2019s no coincidence that the witnesses at Wednesday\u2019s hearing represent school districts in liberal cities. Republicans have sought to score political points by attacking \u201cwoke\u201d policies that they say allow for hate speech. A separate House committee had planned to hold a hearing about reports of antisemitism on George Washington University\u2019s campus. Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser and DC Metropolitan Police Chief Pam Smith were set to testify before about their response to an encampment on campus. But after that encampment was cleared Wednesday morning, and police arrested dozens of people, the committee called off the hearing. Queens high school in focus Lawmakers at the hearing focused in particular on an\u00a0incident\u00a0from last fall at Hillcrest High School in Queens, where a pro-Israel teacher reportedly hid for hours from hundreds of protesting students. Banks condemned the incident. \u201cI condemn clearly: What happened at Hillcrest was a complete act of antisemitism. It will not stand on my watch,\u201d Banks said. \u201cWe responded. And I don\u2019t know how to make it any clearer.\u201d Banks, who graduated from Hillcrest, said the principal of the school was removed and has not been transferred to lead another school. But New York Republican Rep. Elise Stefanik tussled with Banks over the fact that the principal had been reassigned \u2013 but not fired. Stefanik, citing local media reports, said the principal of Hillcrest High School in Queens was given a senior position, working on a team led by the school district\u2019s deputy chancellor. Banks said he could not confirm the former principal\u2019s current role, but he acknowledged the principal was removed from his job but reassigned elsewhere in the district. He testified that the principal was removed for failing to provide proper supervision. \u201cThat\u2019s concerning to me that you have him in a senior position,\u201d Stefanik told Banks. \u201cWe\u2019re getting lip service but a lack of enforcement and a lack of accountability.\u201d New York Republican Rep. Brandon Williams also slammed Banks for not firing the principal. \u201cHow can Jewish students feel safe at New York City Public Schools when you can\u2019t even manage to terminate the principal of Open-Season-on-Jews High School?\u201d Williams asked Banks during a fiery exchange. \u201cHow can Jewish students go to school knowing that he is still on your payroll?\u201d Banks explained that every employee has due process rights and stressed everything is done to make sure teachers and students are safe. \u201cWe don\u2019t always get it right,\u201d Banks acknowledged. Under questioning from lawmakers, Banks said Hillcrest High School was not \u201cradicalized.\u201d \u201cBut the kids who were responsible\u2026engaged clearly in an act of antisemitism. And I dealt with it,\u201d he said, noting that \u201cwe suspended students, we removed the principal from the school.\u201d \u201cA Jewish teacher was targeted in a frightening episode. We didn\u2019t accept that. We pushed back on that tremendously,\u201d he said. A \u2018deeply troubling\u2019 incident Stefanik also questioned Banks on allegations that students marched in the hallway of Origins High School in Brooklyn chanting \u201cdeath to Jews.\u201d Banks said an investigation showed no evidence that was chanted in the halls, although he noted what the probe revealed was \u201cdeeply troubling,\u201d and a number of students at the school were suspended. Banks said he couldn\u2019t provide details of what happened at Origins, because the incident was under litigation. He also noted a principal at another school was disciplined after assigning a teacher to go with a student to an anti-Israel protest. Banks called that action \u201ccompletely inappropriate\u201d and said both the principal and teacher were disciplined, but not fired. Berkeley under investigation The hearing came a day after the US Department of Education said in a letter reviewed by CNN that it is investigating Berkeley Unified School District in California for allegations of discrimination based on a shared Jewish ancestry or being Israeli. A copy of the letter, sent to the Anti-Defamation League and the Brandeis Center, says the department\u2019s Office for Civil Rights will investigate whether the district complied with Title VI requirements to prevent discrimination and harassment. The department is also investigating whether the Berkeley district retaliated against two parents who complained about harassment based on Jewish ancestry. CNN has reached out to the school district for a comment. The Education Department referred questions to a list of schools currently under investigation for shared ancestry claims. However, that list does not currently include the Berkeley school district. The complaint filed by the Brandeis Center details dozens of incidents at Berkeley, including students allegedly shouting: \u201ckill the Jews,\u201d and \u201cF\u2014 the Jews\u201d as well as \u201cKKK.\u201d Enikia Ford Morthel, superintendent of the Berkeley Unified School District in California, testified Wednesday that there have been allegations of antisemitism in her district but denied that the problem is widespread. \u201cOur babies sometimes say harmful things. We are mindful that all kids make mistakes,\u201d Ford Morthel said, referring to students. \u201cWe know that our staff are not immune to mistakes either. And we don\u2019t ignore them when they occur.\u201d Since the October 7 terror attack against Israel, there have been formal complaints alleging antisemitism linked to nine incidents in the school district, Ford Morthel told lawmakers. \u201cHowever, antisemitism is not pervasive in the Berkeley Unified School District,\u201d she said. Ford Morthel noted that the district does not share actions the school district takes against students or teachers because this information is protected under federal and state law. \u201cAs a result, some believe we do nothing. That is not true,\u201d she said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/08/us/antisemitism-hearing-schools/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_05_10_politics_steve-bannon-appeal-denied", "text": "A federal appeals court on Friday upheld the contempt-of-Congress conviction of Steve Bannon, the ex-adviser to former President Donald Trump who was found guilty after failing to comply with a subpoena from the House January 6 committee. Bannon\u2019s conviction \u2014 and now, the DC Circuit\u2019s affirmation of that conviction \u2014 is a boost to Congress\u2019 leverage in its efforts going forward to obtain cooperation in its investigations. The US DC Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously rejected several challenges Bannon made to the case, including his claim that the trial court excluded evidence he should have been allowed to put before the jury in his defense. Bannon was sentenced to four months in federal prison, and that sentence was also upheld Friday by the appeals court. The ruling could pave the way for Bannon to eventually report to prison, though the timing is unclear. The judge who presided over Bannon\u2019s trial previously agreed to let him hold off from serving his sentence while his appeal played out. In its ruling Friday, the three-judge appeals panel gave Bannon time to appeal its ruling to the full DC-based appeals court before it formally notifies the trial judge that the conviction was upheld. Bannon could also turn directly to the Supreme Court for additional appeals, possibly further delaying when he needs to start serving his prison term. Bannon\u2019s attorneys did not immediately respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment. In the DC Circuit\u2019s new ruling, Judge Bradley Garcia, an appointee of President Joe Biden, backed the trial judge\u2019s exclusion of an advice-of-counsel defense, as Bannon had claimed he had rebuffed the subpoena because of supposed executive privilege concerns expressed to him by his lawyer. \u201cThis exact \u2018advice of counsel\u2019 defense is no defense at all,\u201d Garcia wrote, noting that the contempt law only required proof that Bannon \u201cdeliberately and intentionally\u201d did not respond to the subpoena. His opinion was joined by Judge Cornelia Pillard, an appointee of former President Barack Obama, and Trump-appointed Judge Justin Walker. The appeals court noted that \u201cthe communications from former President Trump\u2019s counsel\u201d that Bannon had tried to rely on to defend his conduct did not purport \u201cto authorize Bannon\u2019s refusal to produce any documents or appear for his deposition.\u201d The DC Circuit also rejected Bannon\u2019s argument that the House select committee that investigated the January 6 insurrection was improperly formed. \u201cThese objections suffer from a common defect,\u201d the judges wrote. \u201cBannon did not raise them before the Select Committee and therefore forfeited them.\u201d Bannon is one of two former members of Trump\u2019s inner circle who faced prosecution for not participating in the House January 6 probe. The second, former Trump White House aide Peter Navarro, is currently serving a four-month prison sentence for his 2023 conviction. When the now-defunct House panel sought documents and testimony from Bannon in 2021, it pointed to alleged communications between Bannon and Trump in the days leading up to the January 6 Capitol attack, as well as comments Bannon made on his podcast the day before the riot that \u201call hell is going to break loose tomorrow.\u201d Bannon for some time served in Trump\u2019s White House, but by the time of Trump\u2019s crusade to overturn his 2020 electoral loss, Bannon had long left the federal government.

{"id": "2024_05_09_us_nyc-homeless-men-stabbing-sentencing", "text": "A 42-year-old man was sentenced to 25 years to life in prison for a string of stabbing attacks on homeless people in New York City that left one dead and two critically injured in the summer of 2022. Trevon Murphy pleaded guilty in January to one count of second-degree murder and two counts of attempted second-degree murder for the attacks on the three men, who were sleeping outside in the city. \u201cNew Yorkers who face the painful and difficult experience of being unhoused shouldn\u2019t have to simultaneously fear for their safety,\u201d Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg said in a news release Wednesday. CNN has reached out to Murphy\u2019s attorney for comment. The first attack was on July 5, 2022, when Murphy stabbed a person sleeping on a bench inside Hudson River Park shortly after 3 a.m. The victim died soon after being admitted to Bellevue Hospital, the release said. On July 9, Murphy sat across from a man sleeping on a bench in Midtown Manhattan and watched him for 20 minutes before stabbing him with a large knife and fleeing the scene, the district attorney said. The final attack took place around 3:30 a.m. on July 11, when Murphy stabbed a man sleeping in a basketball court around the Upper East Side of Manhattan, the release said. Murphy told officers he specifically targeted the lower abdomen of each victim, calling it the \u201cstabber\u2019s choice,\u201d according to Bragg. Then-NYPD Commissioner Keechant Sewell said at the time Murphy was wanted on an outstanding warrant in Tennessee and should not have been on the streets when the attacks took place. Murphy was arrested on July 13, 2022. He had a knife in his pants pocket when he was taken into custody, police said. Murphy allegedly assaulted another homeless person in the Queens shelter where he was staying in April 2022, NYPD Chief Joseph Kenny told reporters at the time of Murphy\u2019s arrest. \u201cWhile today\u2019s sentence will not bring back an innocent life lost and cannot undo the pain two New Yorkers face, I hope it provides a sense of comfort and closure,\u201d Bragg said Wednesday.

{"id": "2024_05_09_us_shenandoah-county-confederate-school-names-reaj", "text": "School board members in Virginia\u2019s Shenandoah County voted early Friday to restore the names of two schools that previously honored Confederate leaders \u2013 four years after those names had been removed. The 5-1 vote came after hours of public comment during a meeting that began Thursday evening from people speaking on both sides of the issue. Vice Chairman Kyle L. Gutshall was the sole opposing vote. \u201cI ask that when you cast your vote, you remember that Stonewall Jackson and others fighting on the side of the Confederacy in this area were intent on protecting the land, the buildings and the lives of those under attack,\u201d said a woman urging the board to restore the Confederate names. \u201cPreservation is the focus of those wishing to restore the names.\u201d Gene Kilby, the last surviving son of James Wilson Kilby, a Virginia civil rights activist who helped desegregate schools in Virginia, criticized the move to keep the names. \u201cWhy are\u00a0we\u00a0here\u00a0tonight\u00a0to\u00a0go\u00a0back\u00a0to\u00a0a\u00a0time\u00a0in\u00a0history that\u00a0was\u00a0very\u00a0cruel, where\u00a0hatred\u00a0and\u00a0racism\u00a0continued\u00a0throughout\u00a0this\u00a0county\u00a0and\u00a0throughout\u00a0the\u00a0 United States?\u201d Kilby said. \u201cIs this the type of legacy that you want to put in Shenandoah County\u2019s public school buildings?\u201d In the years since the 2020 killing of George Floyd, the names of Confederate leaders, Confederate monuments and symbols have been removed from numerous schools, universities, military facilities and even the Washington National Cathedral\u2019s windows. Nearly four years ago, the Shenandoah County School Board made such a decision and moved to rename Stonewall Jackson High School and Ashby Lee Elementary School. The schools had been named after Confederate Gens. Thomas \u201cStonewall\u201d Jackson, Robert E. Lee and Turner Ashby. That 2020 move was part of a resolution condemning racism and affirming the district\u2019s \u201ccommitment to an inclusive school environment,\u201d according to school board documents. The schools have been called Mountain View High School and Honey Run Elementary School since July 2021, according to board documents. But the composition of the school board is different now than it was during the 2020 decision \u2013 all six seats are held by different people. Changes could be a six-figure expense After a group of residents named The Coalition for Better Schools asked the board last month to consider restoring the original school names, members discussed the issue in a work session, heard public comments and scheduled this week\u2019s vote. In an April 22 work session meeting, the six board members criticized how the names were changed in 2020, saying it was wrongly done, was rushed and lacked public input. Board member Gloria E. Carlineo said in the work session that it also \u201ceroded\u201d confidence in the school board. Carlineo told CNN her vote\u00a0would be based on how the names were changed in 2020. \u00a0A decision that, she said, took place within days and with Covid-19 restrictions that limited the community\u2019s input. \u201cSo, for me, the main consideration is whether we, as a democratic nation of laws, will choose to ignore a decision made by a governmental body that exploited the tragedy of COVID or will rectify a wrongful action that has deeply divided our community.\u00a0I choose the latter,\u201d Carlineo told CNN before Thursday\u2019s meeting. CNN reached out to the other five board members for comment ahead of Thursday\u2019s meeting. Jessica Sager, a spokeswoman for Shenandoah County Public Schools, had said the district has not yet obtained quotes on the estimated cost of a\u00a0name change. In 2021, the district estimated it would spend more than $304,000 in costs related to\u00a0changing the two school names and a middle school mascot,\u00a0according to district documents. Those costs\u00a0were related to\u00a0uniforms and equipment for athletic teams,\u00a0resurfacing of a gym floor, signage in buildings and scoreboards, among other items, former Shenandoah County Public Schools Superintendent Mark Johnston told board members during a meeting last year. The motion says that if approved, private donations would be used for the restoration of the school names and not by \u201cthe school system or government tax funds, though the SCPS will oversee disbursements relating to restoration costs,\u201d according to Thursday\u2019s meeting agenda. Some residents refuse to move on, parent says Parents and residents expressed their opposition and support to restoring the school names. In an April 3 letter to the school board, the Coalition for Better Schools said it\u00a0believed \u201cthat revisiting this decision is essential to honor our community\u2019s heritage and respect the wishes of the majority.\u201d The group told CNN before the vote took place that it \u201chas full confidence in our current school board to listen to the voice of its constituents and follow the wishes of the majority in the county. Unfortunately, the previous school board did not take those things into consideration. We believe that \u2018We the People\u2019 is an important part of our Constitution and should be upheld at every level of our government.\u201d Sarah Kohrs, a mother of two\u00a0students attending schools in the district, is among several parents and residents who\u00a0said ahead of the vote that they were opposed to restoring the Confederacy-tied names and were frustrated\u00a0it was being considered. \u201cIt\u2019s very frustrating to know that here we are four years after that, and we still have a small portion of the community that just refuses to move on,\u201d Kohrs told CNN. She said attention should be focused on what students want and need to succeed, like repairing leaking roofs, a sound system for track meets, or having enough varsity letters with the current school names. \u201cWe still don\u2019t even have all of\u00a0our athletic equipment from the name change in 2020. We\u2019re still utilizing old hurdles, sometimes that have the name of Stonewall on them,\u201d Kohrs told CNN. Shenandoah County Public Schools serves more than 5,600 students, and about 75% are White, 18% Hispanic and 3% Black, data from the state\u2019s department education shows.
