{"id": "2024_05_20_us_family-heirloom-reunited-social-media", "text": "When her mother died two years ago, Celia Bashaw began dreaming about art, and not just any art. Her thoughts were fixed on an heirloom her great uncle, Chuck Perkins, had carved. Her mother and grandmother had loved it. But Bashaw couldn\u2019t find it. She knew it had been picked up after her grandmother\u2019s death when the family was going through her belongings, 15 years ago. And she knew her great uncle, who lived in Vermont, had given it away there, hoping the new owners would hold on to it. As it turned out, they sold it. So she decided to make a Facebook post in a group for Vermonters, hoping she could track down the buyers and get the piece back. \u201c(My mom) had a whole chest of photos. A bunch of photographs of everybody in the family and all the things that were really special to her.\u201d Bashaw told CNN. \u201cIn those photos, there were very good, prominent photos of the family heirloom that I was looking for. Before, I hadn\u2019t had any good photos of it. I just had a description.\u201d Bashaw attached three photos of the engraving, which portrayed a leopard lounging in a tree. The post was shared about 600 times, according to CNN affiliate WCAX. Some commenters noted the piece looked different from the one Bashaw had originally posted. Bashaw replied while it had been through some wear and tear, she was able to confirm it was the same work from her great uncle\u2019s woodburned signature on the back. \u201cIt\u2019s really a one-of-a-kind engraving, so when this man sent me a picture of it, I was like, \u2018There\u2019s no way somebody did something so identical to my uncle\u2019s carving,\u2019\u201d Bashaw said. \u201cIt\u2019s got to be the one, like there\u2019s no way I can let this go.\u201d Then, in Rutland, Vermont, Chris McKirryher and her partner, Phil Matte, saw the Facebook post and realized they had the solution to Bashaw\u2019s long-shot quest. At a yard sale in Pittsford, Vermont, the couple had bought the carving. They arranged a meeting and Bashaw made the two-and-a-half hour drive from Plattsburgh, New York, to Vermont. She told CNN McKirryher and Matte were \u201cjust so darling\u201d and she \u201cloved them immediately.\u201d Despite being nervous about meeting strangers from the internet, Bashaw found the duo were \u201cso nice and such great people.\u201d \u201cWith all the bad news and everything going around, it\u2019s good to see something really nice,\u201d Matte told WCAX, who agreed to sell it back to Bashaw. In an updated post to the Facebook group, Bashaw shared her excitement at being reunited with her great uncle\u2019s artwork, thanking her friends, family and community for sharing and helping her find the piece. \u201cI\u2019m over the moon happy (and) lucky.\u201d she wrote. Now, Bashaw feels like a piece of her mother and grandmother has come back home. \u201cIt\u2019s really nice because I don\u2019t have very many things of my mother or my grandmother and actually, it\u2019s been extremely hard for me to even find a picture of me and my grandmother together. We were so close, and it just makes me so sad.\u201d she said. \u201cHaving a piece of art that was so important to them finally be back and in my grasp\u2026 I wish I could tell my mom about it because she would just scream, just like I did \u2026 I hope she can see it now that I have it back because she was looking for it too,\u201d she added. Bashaw, an artist herself, plans to put the carving back in her grandfather\u2019s house instead of in her own. \u201cHe has the wall still where there\u2019s like, almost a frame outline of where it used to be, so it\u2019s like as soon, I put it there, it\u2019s just supposed to be there. So, I think it\u2019ll bring some solace to my grandpa, too.\u201d she said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/20/us/family-heirloom-reunited-social-media/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/21/2024", "section": "us"}}

Union City Police arrested Atlanta police officer Koby Minor Wednesday, according to a news release from the Atlanta Police Department. Minor resigned from the department later that day. Minor was charged with murder and aggravated assault after shooting his Lyft driver, a release from the Union City Police Department said. The Lyft driver was identified by authorities as Reginald Folks and was pronounced dead at the scene. The affidavit said he was shot in the head. \u201cOur hearts are with Mr. Folks\u2019 loved ones as they confront this unspeakable tragedy, and we have reached out to offer our support during this difficult time,\u201d Lyft said in a statement shared with CNN. \u201cWe stand ready to assist law enforcement with any investigation and have permanently banned the rider\u2019s account from the Lyft community.\u201d A passerby who saw Minor waving his hand on the side of Stonewall Tell Road in Union City called police, the affidavit said. Minor told the passerby he believed he was getting kidnapped by Folks, according to the affidavit. Minor recounted to police he had gotten in the Lyft after leaving another police officer\u2019s home that evening. He told officers Folks was talking on the phone through his car\u2019s Bluetooth in an unknown language and Minor said he \u201cheard what he thought was another voice in his ear talking to him but did not say what the voice said.\u201d Minor told police he then asked Folks to stop the car but he continued to drive. When they came to a red light, Minor tried to unlock and open the door but he could not get the door open. He then added Folks turned around and attempted to reach in the back seat, which is when Minor shot him. He fired approximately three shots, broke the window of the vehicle, and exited. Minor is being held in Fulton County Jail. CNN has been unable to determine if Minor has obtained legal representation. The Atlanta Police Department hired Minor in 2018 and was on unpaid administrative leave during the time of his arrest this week, the department statement said. He was previously arrested in Milton in December 2023, and he was relieved of his department-issued firearm as a result, according to the statement, which did not specify the nature of that arrest.

{"id": "2024_05_19_us_dorothy-tillman-chicago-arizona-state", "text": "By age 14, Dorothy Jean Tillman had obtained an associate\u2019s, bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degree. Despite the impressive achievements, Tillman remembers turning to her mother and saying, \u201cI think I want to pursue a doctorate degree.\u201d Her mother,\u00a0Jimalita\u00a0Tillman, was surprised. They were in the middle of the Covid-19 pandemic. And Dorothy was a year into launching a science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics (STEAM) camp startup, and she was looking for funding for the organization. She was busy. \u201cI was just like, \u2018why?\u2019 I thought you were done,\u201d Jimalita told CNN. But after Dorothy explained that her mission was to positively impact young people when it came to their mental health, Jimalita understood and lent her support. Fast-forward two years, when 17-year-old Dorothy\u00a0successfully delivered her dissertation. Now, at 18, she is officially Dr. Dorothy Jean Tillman after walking at Arizona State University\u2019s College of Health Solutions convocation on May 8. Jimalita\u00a0told CNN that seeing her daughter achieve so much is humbling. \u201cI knew what it took for her to go through that. She had to sacrifice a lot. A lot of her fears and going through different things during the pandemic,\u201d she said. \u201cShe emerged as a leader without fear, showing them how to navigate online schooling.\u201d From a young age, Dorothy excelled in her academic pursuits. By age 7, she was already doing high school work. At that point, she started to take college level module tests and apply the credits toward higher education. \u201cIt was always a very hard thing to kind of stomach mentally being so young. When you get out of college, you\u2019re thinking, \u2018what do I do next?\u2019 Now I am able to sit in the comfortability of being a teenager and being OK with the fact that I don\u2019t have to figure out what comes next,\u201d Dorothy said. She studied integrated behavioral health at Arizona State University. For her dissertation, she explored the stigma that prevents university students from getting mental health treatment. In addition to her school work, Dorothy also devotes her time to running the\u00a0Dorothy Jeanius\u00a0STEAM Leadership Institute, which inspires hundreds of underserved young people in Chicago, as well as abroad in countries like Ghana and South Africa, to pursue STEAM careers. The program includes guest speakers and open conversations around each of the five areas of STEAM. \u201cWe just want to provide them with all the resources possible and the best foundation to be able to start walking on that pathway to their dreams,\u201d she said. While so many people marvel at the success she\u2019s achieved, Tillman says she is still a normal teen who spends time with family and friends. She gives credit to her mother as one of her greatest motivators. \u201cI definitely couldn\u2019t have gotten this far without her, like she\u2019s definitely the best teammate, the best supporter,\u201d she said. Another inspiration for Tillman is her grandmother, former Chicago alderwoman Dorothy Tillman, who worked alongside Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. during the civil rights movement. After graduating from ASU, Tillman hopes to continue developing her camps and start applying her studies on integrated behavioral health into her work. There is a potential for franchising the camps one day so more kids gain something, she says.\u00a0She also hopes to work more with kids in Africa. \u201cI\u2019ve been focusing on my studies a lot and I don\u2019t go nearly as much as I should,\u201d Tillman said. \u201cNow I\u2019m glad to have the time for things like that.\u201d While she\u00a0has achieved a lot at her age, Tillman tells people it\u2019s all about having\u00a0a supportive family around her. \u201cIt\u2019s teamwork that makes the dream work,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is a village that builds the land. It\u2019s having those people there with you that is going to, you know, uphold you at the end of the day.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/19/us/dorothy-tillman-chicago-arizona-state/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/21/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_05_19_us_scottie-scheffler-arrest-pga-championship", "text": "The world\u2019s top golfer was being booked and fingerprinted before the second round of the PGA Championship in Louisville, Kentucky, when a police officer asked an unusual question: \u201cSo do you want the full experience today?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know how to answer that,\u201d Scottie Scheffler told one of several officers who had now started to razz the Masters champion arrested early Friday in the alleged assault of another officer in a traffic incident outside the Valhalla Golf Club. \u201cCome on, man, you want a sandwich?\u201d the officer at the jail asked during a light moment on a day that started with tragedy. \u201cSure, I\u2019ll take a sandwich,\u201d Scheffler, who had yet to have breakfast, recalled saying. Under \u201cplace of employment/occupation,\u201d the Louisville Metro Police Department report for inmate No. 00654436 read \u201cPROFESSIONAL GOLFER,\u201d though officers didn\u2019t immediately recognize him. The time and place of arrest were listed as 6:20 a.m. at Gate 1 of the Valhalla Golf Club on Shelbyville Road, near where a 69-year-old man named John Mills had earlier been fatally struck by a bus while crossing the street to work for a tournament vendor. Over four surreal hours, Scheffler, 27, a man of faith who once proclaimed his \u201cidentity isn\u2019t a golf score,\u201d was charged with felony assault for allegedly dragging a police officer with his car while arriving at the course in the predawn hours. He was handcuffed and taken away in an arrest captured on video that was widely circulated on social media. He took a mug shot in an orange jumpsuit and rushed back to the course in time to shoot a stellar 5-under par that left him near the top of the leaderboard. Scheffler struggled on Saturday, knocking himself out of contention for the championship. \u201cI definitely never imagined ever going to jail, and I definitely never imagined going to jail the morning before one of my tee times for sure,\u201d Scheffler told reporters Friday. Scheffler called the incident a \u201cbig misunderstanding.\u201d \u2018I feel for them. I\u2019m sorry\u2019 One of the strangest days in the history of professional golf began to unfold at 5:07 a.m. Friday, when police said a pedestrian was struck by a shuttle bus in front of Gate 2 at Valhalla. The pedestrian was later identified as Mills. He was described by Mayor Craig Greenberg as \u201ca Louisvillian who will be greatly missed by his family and our community.\u201d Mills had been \u201cenjoying his time at Valhalla while working security,\u201d his family told CNN affiliate WDRB in a statement. \u201cHe liked to stay busy in retirement. We love him and will miss him,\u201d Mills\u2019 family said. \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate for the person that did pass away earlier today. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s getting talked about enough, or at all,\u201d golfer Collin Morikawa lamented hours after the accident. At a news conference after competing on Friday Scheffler talked immediately about Mills\u2019 family. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine what they\u2019re going through this morning,\u201d he said. \u201cOne day he\u2019s heading to the golf course to watch a tournament. A few moments later he\u2019s trying to cross the street, and now he\u2019s no longer with us. I can\u2019t imagine what they\u2019re going through. My heart \u2013 I feel for them. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d After Mills was struck, police shut down traffic outside the course. At 6:16 a.m., Scheffler pulled up to stalled traffic in a black 2024 Lexus and steered the PGA player courtesy vehicle into the opposite lane in an attempt to get around the backup. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what \u2026 happened at the time other than there was an accident,\u201d Scheffler said. \u201cI didn\u2019t know that it was fatal.\u201d On the dark and rainy morning, Det. Bryan Gillis was directing traffic into Valhalla. \u201cDetective Gillis was in the middle of the westbound lanes, in full LMPD uniform and a hi-visibility yellow reflective rain jacket,\u201d the police report read. \u201cDetective Gillis stopped subject and attempted to give instructions.\u201d Scheffler \u201crefused to comply and accelerated forward, dragging Detective Gillis to the ground,\u201d according to the police report. \u201cDetective Gillis suffered pain, swelling, and abrasions to his left wrist and knee. He was transported to the hospital for further medical treatment by emergency medical personnel. Detective Gillis\u2019 uniform pants, valued at approximately $80, were damaged beyond repair.\u201d \u2018No idea he was even Scottie Scheffler\u2019 ESPN\u2019s Jeff Darlington witnessed the encounter. He wrote on social media that Scheffler \u201ccontinued to drive about 10 to 20 yards toward the entrance\u201d before stopping. \u201cThe police officer attempted to attach himself to Scheffler\u2019s car, and Scheffler then stopped his vehicle at the entrance to Valhalla,\u201d Darlington\u00a0wrote on X. \u201cThe police officer then began to scream at Scheffler to get out of the car. When Scheffler exited the vehicle, the officer shoved Scheffler against the car and immediately placed him in handcuffs.\u201d Darlington attempted unsuccessfully to intervene. He was only several feet away when the golfer was arrested. At one point, Darlington said on ESPN, Scheffler saw the journalist and said, \u201cCan you help?\u201d Darlington on video is seen briefly following officers as they took Scheffler away. Police tell him to step back. \u201cYou need to get out of the way. Right now, he\u2019s going to jail. He\u2019s going to jail and there\u2019s nothing you can do about it,\u201d one officer told Darlington, referring to Scheffler. \u201cThe police officers around the patrol car in which Scottie Scheffler was in had no idea he was even Scottie Scheffler,\u201d Darlington said on air. \u201cI say that because one police officer came up to me with his pad and said \u2026 \u2018Can you tell me the name of the person who was just arrested?\u2019\u201d \u2018I was pretty rattled\u2019 Scheffler\u2019s attorney, Steven Romines, said his client was headed to the golf course early to prepare for his tee time. \u201cDue to the combination of event traffic and a traffic fatality in the area it was a very chaotic situation. He was proceeding as directed by another traffic officer and driving a marked player\u2019s vehicle with credentials visible,\u201d Romines said in a statement, referring to Scheffler. \u201cIn the confusion, Scottie is alleged to have disregarded a different officer\u2019s traffic signals resulting in these charges.\u201d Multiple eyewitnesses have said Scheffler \u201cdid not do anything wrong\u201d but drove as directed, according to Romines. \u201cHe stopped immediately upon being directed to and never at any point assaulted any officer with his vehicle,\u201d the statement reads. \u201cWe will plead not guilty and litigate this matter as needed.\u201d Scheffler \u2013 a new father who has called golf a way for him \u201cto glorify God\u201d \u2013 would be seen over the course of the day on video wearing gym shorts and a T-shirt as he was led away in handcuffs and in an orange jail shirt for his mug shot. \u201cI was pretty rattled, to say the least,\u201d Scheffler said. \u201cI was shaking for like an hour.\u201d Scheffler was booked at 7:28 a.m. Friday. He was charged with felony second-degree assault on a police officer, along with lesser charges of third-degree criminal mischief, reckless driving and disregarding signals from officers directing traffic, according to Jefferson County court records. Josh Abner, a spokesperson for the office of Jefferson County Attorney\u00a0Mike O\u2019Connell, told CNN prosecutors are \u201cstill obtaining information in the case of Mr. Scheffler and will review and proceed accordingly.\u201d Scheffler has a court hearing scheduled for Tuesday. \u201cMy situation will get handled. It was a chaotic situation and a big misunderstanding,\u201d Scheffler told reporters, declining to comment on the specifics of what happened leading up to his arrest. He sat in the back of a police car and could hear an officer trying to figure out his identity. \u201cAt no point did I try to name-drop myself,\u201d Scheffler said. The golfer said \u201ca nice chat\u201d with the officer who drove him to the jail helped calm his nerves. At the jail at one point he asked the same officer, \u201c\u2018Hey, excuse me, can you just come hang out with me for a few minutes so I can calm down.\u2019 I was never angry. I was just in shock.\u201d He got ready to play while in police custody Scheffler recalled some officers cracking jokes about how he ended up behind bars before his tee time at the PGA, one of golf\u2019s four major tournaments. He said he looked out from his cell at one point and saw himself getting arrested on ESPN. \u201cI did spend some time stretching in a jail cell. That was a first for me. That was part of my warmup,\u201d he said. \u201cI started going through my routine and I tried to get my heart rate down as much as I could.\u201d Later that morning, an officer came to the holding cell and said, \u201cLet\u2019s go\u2026 Get ready,\u201d motioning for Scheffler to roll up his mat. \u201cI poked my head at the TV and I was like, \u2018Oh, I might be able to get there. We\u2019ll see how bad the traffic is getting in and out,\u2019\u201d Scheffler said. Just before his 10:08 a.m. tee time, Scheffler walked down to the tee box holding an umbrella under a light rain.  Chants of \u201cScottie! Scottie! Scottie!\u201d broke out among the spectators. \u201cFree Scottie!\u201d one man yelled, eliciting cheers from the crowd. Scheffler struck his first shot of the day with a crisp click of the club, sending the ball soaring toward the cloudy sky and unleashing applause and another round of cheers from the spectators. Some had scrawled the words \u201cFree Scottie\u201d with markers on their shirts. After 18 holes and his move up the leaderboard, he summed up his feelings at the news conference. \u201cIt was nice to be able to get inside the ropes,\u201d he said, \u201cand do what I love to do.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/19/us/scottie-scheffler-arrest-pga-championship/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/21/2024", "section": "us"}}

Over the last few years,\u00a0pandas from the San Diego Zoo, Memphis Zoo and Smithsonian National Zoo in Washington, DC were also returned to China. But more pandas are set to arrive in different parts of the United States. In April, it was announced China would send giant\u00a0pandas to live at San Francisco\u2019s zoo for the first time. And the San Diego Zoo announced in February it would receive two giant pandas from China, marking the first time the country has granted new\u00a0panda\u00a0loans in the US in two decades. Pandas have served as something of an unofficial barometer of China-US relations since 1972, when Beijing gifted a pair of the bears to the Smithsonian National Zoo, following US President Richard Nixon\u2019s historic ice-breaking trip to China. Chinese leader Xi Jinping said in 2023 the bamboo-eating bears serve as \u201cenvoys of friendship between the Chinese and American peoples.\u201d Just over 1,800 giant pandas remain in the wild, according to the World Wildlife Fund, which lists the species as vulnerable and describes them as the world\u2019s rarest bear.

{"id": "2024_05_20_politics_trump-trial-takeaways", "text": "The prosecution rested their case against Donald J. Trump on Monday in the former president\u2019s hush money trial, which is barreling toward a conclusion as soon as next week. Michael Cohen\u2019s testimony finally wrapped up Monday after four days \u2013 and 17 hours \u2013 on the witness stand as the final witness in the prosecution\u2019s case alleging that Trump falsified business records when he reimbursed Cohen for the hush money payment made to adult film actress Stormy Daniels in the final days of the 2016 campaign. It wasn\u2019t long after the defense began its case on Monday for things to get heated \u2013 Judge Juan Merchan admonished a witness for the defense, Robert Costello, and threatened to remove him from the stand\u00a0after he audibly complained when the judge sustained objections to the questions he was being asked. Merchan even cleared the courtroom of the press briefly after dressing down Costello. It was an unexpectedly contentious moment for a trial that is quickly nearing a close. While the defense appears likely to rest its case on Tuesday, Merchan said he\u2019s planning to have closing arguments next Tuesday, May 28, out of concern with having a four-day weekend for the jury when it could be deliberating (court is dark on Friday because of a juror\u2019s travel, and Monday is Memorial Day). Regardless of the break, the Trump hush money trial is near its end \u2013 and roughly a week away from being in the hands of the jury. Here are the takeaways from Day 19: Prosecution rests Prosecutors from the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office rested their case Monday afternoon after calling 20 witnesses over the course of 15 days, including Cohen, Daniels, former Trump aide Hope Hicks and ex-publisher of the National Enquirer David Pecker. The trial started on April 15 with jury selection, and the prosecution\u2019s first witness, Pecker, was called a week later on April 22. Cohen was the key witness, spending more than 17 hours on the witness stand over four days before wrapping up on Monday. He testified in detail, accusing his former boss of directing him to pay Daniels\u2019 attorney in October 2016 and approving of the reimbursement plan at the heart of the criminal case. Under cross-examination, Trump attorney Todd Blanche sought to poke holes in Cohen\u2019s credibility, alleging that he made up conversations where he said Trump directed him to pay Daniels. Trump\u2019s former fixer\u2019s testimony may be the key in determining how the jury ultimately rules on the case. But over the course of roughly a month, prosecutors also introduced a host of evidence to try to corroborate his allegations that Trump directed Cohen\u2019s repayment, through both expert witnesses and documents. Defense witness infuriates the judge, who clears courtroom Trump\u2019s attorneys called Costello as a way to try to rebut Cohen\u2019s testimony about the pressure he was receiving in 2018 when the FBI searched his home and office. Costello advised Cohen in the weeks after the search, though Cohen did not sign a retainer agreement and did not pay Costello, who touted in email communications his close connections with Rudy Giuliani. The former New York mayor also joined Trump\u2019s legal team in 2018. Costello described his initial 2018 meeting with Cohen, in which he said Cohen told him, \u201cI swear to God, Bob, I don\u2019t have anything on Donald Trump.\u201d But once on the stand, Costello quickly got on the wrong side of the judge, speaking over Merchan as the judge sustained objections in response to questions from Trump attorney Emil Bove. Then Costello began audibly protesting the sustained objections. \u201cRidiculous,\u201d he could be heard saying while the attorneys approached the judge after one objection. He later let out an audible \u201cjeez\u201d following the judge\u2019s ruling. After another sustained objection,\u202fCostello\u202flet out an audible sigh and rolled his eyes, side glancing at the judge. The judge then asked the jury to step out of the courtroom. Once jurors left, Merchan said, \u201cI want to discuss proper decorum in my courtroom.\u201d \u201cWhen there\u2019s a witness on the stand, if you don\u2019t like my ruling, you don\u2019t say \u2018jeez,\u2019\u201d Merchan said to Costello. \u201cYou don\u2019t give me a side eye and you don\u2019t roll your eyes,\u201d Merchan said, his voice showing his anger. When\u202fCostello\u202fheld a long glare at the judge, Merchan asked, \u201cAre you staring me down?\u201d The judge then cleared the courtroom of the media, who were held in the hallways for several minutes. Inside the courtroom, Merchan threatened to remove Costello from the stand and strike his testimony. \u201cI\u2019m\u00a0putting you on notice that your conduct is contemptuous,\u201d\u00a0Merchan said to Costello, according to a transcript. \u201cIf\u00a0you try to stare me down one more time, I will remove you from the stand.\u201d Costello tried to explain: \u201cCan I say something, please?\u201d \u201cNo. No,\u201d Merchan responded. \u201cThis is not a conversation.\u201d Once\u00a0the jury and the press were\u00a0let back inside, Bove\u2019s questions continued without incident, though the judge did urge Costello after several objections to just answer the question that had been asked and not elaborate further. Costello will be back on the stand when court resumes at 9:30 a.m. Tuesday, under cross-examination by prosecutor Susan Hoffinger. Trial endgame comes into focus Trump\u2019s side began its defense case Monday afternoon \u2013 and the former president\u2019s lawyers appear likely to rest on Tuesday. The defense first called a paralegal to introduce call records between Cohen and Costello, before Costello took the stand. He\u2019s expected to be off the stand by mid-morning Tuesday, and Trump\u2019s attorneys said that \u2013 as of now \u2013 they don\u2019t plan to call any other witnesses after him. That would mean that Trump does not plan to testify in his own defense, although the judge noted that the plans from Trump\u2019s team could always change. Trump\u2019s team had also planned to call a campaign finance expert, but Merchan limited the expert\u2019s testimony, which apparently caused Trump\u2019s lawyers to change their mind. Merchan could have pushed to have closing arguments this week and give the case to the jury \u2013 but that left open a likely possibility that the jury would begin deliberations only to have a four-day weekend for Memorial Day (one of the jurors has a flight Friday so Merchan, has already said court will be dark that day). Instead, Merchan said he expects to have closings next Tuesday. Once the defense rests its case, he will hold a conference with the two parties to discuss the instructions the judge will give to the jury before deliberations. As a result, the trial could be dark for a week, although Merchan still has not said what will happen on Thursday. Cohen admits he stole from Trump Org. Cohen admitted in the final stretch of cross-examination Monday that he stole $60,000 from the Trump Organization by telling then-Chief Financial Officer Allen Weisselberg he needed to be reimbursed for a payment he made on Trump\u2019s behalf to a tech company. Cohen said he had told various prosecutors about this, prompting Blanche to question why he had never been charged with larceny. Trump was engaged throughout this line of questioning, smirking when Cohen admitted to stealing. Hoffinger touched on the theft briefly during redirect examination to confirm that Cohen knew stealing was wrong. Cohen called it \u201cself-help\u201d because he was angry Trump shorted him on his bonus that year. \u201cI just felt it was almost like self-help. I wasn\u2019t going to let him have the benefit this way as well,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cBut you admitted on cross that it was wrong,\u201d Hoffinger asked. \u201cIt was,\u201d Cohen said. Cohen also acknowledged on cross-examination that he has a financial stake in the outcome of Trump\u2019s trial. \u201cI talk about it on my podcasts, I talk about it on TikTok, and they make money, and that\u2019s how I was viewing your question, whether Mr. Trump is ultimately determined innocent or guilty is not going to affect whether I speak about it or not,\u201d he said. Asked if he would make more money if Trump is found guilty, Cohen said: \u201cIt\u2019s better if he\u2019s not, for me, because it gives me more to talk about in the future.\u201d Hoffinger questioned Cohen for less than an hour on redirect examination midday Monday, hitting points to clarify what prosecutors felt Blanche might have muddied over three days of questioning Trump\u2019s former fixer. Cohen made clear that he had no doubt that Trump told him to work out his reimbursement with Weisselberg and that Trump gave him approval to make the payment to Daniels. \u201cWould you have paid Stormy Daniels the $130,000 had Mr. Trump not signed off?\u201d Hoffinger asked Cohen on redirect examination. \u201cNo, ma\u2019am,\u201d Cohen said. Hoffinger also replayed a recorded phone call between Cohen and Daniels\u2019 former lawyer Keith Davidson from 2018. Cohen can be heard saying, \u201cAnd I can\u2019t \u2013 I can\u2019t even tell you how many times he said to me, you know, \u2018I hate the fact that we did it.\u2019 And my comment to him was, \u2018But every person that you\u2019ve spoken to told you it was the right move.\u2019\u201d \u201cHe\u201d is Trump, Cohen testified, saying, \u201cI was referring to the payment to Keith Davidson that I made on behalf of Mr. Trump for the Stormy Daniels matter for the nondisclosure agreement.\u201d Cohen said that his life had been upended by the situation with Trump. \u201cI lost my law license, my businesses, my financial security,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cMy family\u2019s happiness, which was probably paramount, just to name a few.\u201d Blanche, in another round of questioning, clarified with Cohen that he had also pleaded guilty to tax crimes unrelated to Trump and any felony would get a New York lawyer disbarred. Still, Cohen said he largely blames Trump. Hoffinger later tried to distance Cohen\u2019s federal guilty plea from his testimony at this trial. \u201cMy life was on the line, my liberty, and here I\u2019m just a non-party subpoenaed witness,\u201d Cohen said. Prosecutors, defense spar over Cohen call with Trump During their redirect of Cohen, prosecutors sought to push back on one of the most effective blows Blanche landed knocking his credibility, when he accused Cohen of making up a phone call with Trump ahead of the October 2016 payment to Daniels. Blanche had confronted Cohen with text messages suggesting he called Keith Schiller, Trump\u2019s former bodyguard, at 8:02 p.m. on October 24, 2016, about a harassing prank caller \u2013 and not to update Trump about the Daniels payment. Hoffinger sought to rebut that testimony with a photo pulled from C-SPAN\u2019s video of Trump\u2019s rally that same night \u2013 showing Schiller with Trump when he left the stage just five minutes before the Cohen call. That prompted a long fight between the two parties over admitting the photo into evidence \u2013 including plans to bring the C-SPAN archivist back from Louisiana \u2013 but it was ultimately admitted with a stipulation both sides agreed to. Once the photo was admitted into evidence, Cohen told Hoffinger he spoke with Trump \u201cmore than 20 times\u201d about Daniels in October 2016. Cohen testified that records \u201chelped to refresh my memory,\u201d about when he spoke to Trump\u202fabout\u00a0Daniels. The comment prompted a smile from Trump. Blanche questioned Cohen one more time about the Schiller call before Cohen left the witness stand, asking whether he really could have asked Schiller about the prank call from a teenager and updated Trump on Daniels all in the span of a 90-second call. \u201cYour testimony is still \u2026 just so I understand \u2026 in that 90 seconds you spoke with Mr. Schiller about the problem you were having with the 14-year-old, got him to agree to take care of it, told him you would send him the number, which you did, but also had time for Mr. Schiller to pass the phone to Mr. Trump and update him on everything going on?\u201d Blanche asked. \u201cYes, sir,\u201d Cohen said. In his final question, Blanche asked, \u201cYour testimony remains the same as you gave it last Tuesday, that notwithstanding everything that you said over the years, you have a specific recollection of having conversations on the phone with then-candidate Donald J. Trump about the Stormy Daniels matter?\u201d \u201cYes sir,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cNo doubt in your mind?\u201d Blanche asked. \u201cNo doubt,\u201d Cohen said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/20/politics/trump-trial-takeaways/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/21/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_05_18_us_baltimore-bridge-dali-ship-crew", "text": "When the Rev. Mark Nestlehutt boarded the Dali cargo ship a week after it crashed into a Baltimore bridge, anxious questions emerged among the 21 crew members: \u201cWhen will I get off the ship? When will I be able to get home?\u201d More than a month later, crew members still don\u2019t know the answers. They\u2019ve been confined to the ill-fated Dali ever since it lost power, veered off course and crushed the Francis Scott Key Bridge on March 26, killing six construction workers. Since then, the 20 Indians and one Sri Lankan on board have mourned the deaths of those lives lost, had their cell phones confiscated by the FBI and endured a series of controlled explosions to break apart a massive piece of bridge stuck atop the ship\u2019s bow. \u201cIt has been tough for the seafarers, primarily (because) they know that there\u2019s been loss of life,\u201d said Gwee Guo Duan, assistant general secretary of the Singapore Maritime Officers\u2019 Union, one of the unions representing crew members on the Singaporean-flagged ship. \u201cIt is tough for them, being on board and having to look at the accident site every single day.\u201d But it could be weeks or even months before they can leave, due to an array of complications \u2013 including US visas that expired while they\u2019ve been trapped. Here\u2019s why they\u2019re still stuck on board \u2013 and how they\u2019re coping with unimaginable stressors: Maritime rules say the ship must be staffed A massive vessel like the 984-foot, 106,000-ton Dali requires constant care \u2013 even if it\u2019s not moving. And a ship stuck on a river still faces a host of potential hazards, said Philip C. Schifflin Jr., director of the Center for Mariner Advocacy. \u201cYou can take on water. There\u2019s machinery running \u2026 anytime machinery is running, there\u2019s a particular risk of something failing and causing a fire or something like that,\u201d Schifflin said. \u201cSo seafarers need to be on board ready to respond to those various hazards. And that\u2019s by law.\u201d The United States has \u201cminimum requirements for the manning of vessels,\u201d according to the Office of the Federal Register, and similar international regulations have been widely adopted. \u201cBy international maritime regulations, there has to be some crew left on the vessel,\u201d said Nestlehutt, president and executive director of The Seamen\u2019s Church Institute, which promotes the safety and welfare of mariners. The nonprofit responds to seamen in distress around the world, including those afflicted by hurricanes, pirate incidents or deaths at sea. When Nestlehutt visited the Dali crew on April 1, he immediately noticed their \u201csense of great loss and sadness\u201d about the construction workers killed, and the seamen \u201cwanted to let their own family members know that they were safe,\u201d he said. But days later, the crew lost contact with their families when the FBI seized the crew\u2019s cell phones on April 15 as part of its ongoing investigation into the crash. \u2018Unfounded fear\u2019 among the crew members After the FBI boarded the Dali and seized the seamen\u2019s cell phones, a wave of anxiety permeated the ship, according to a joint statement from the Singapore Maritime Officers\u2019 Union, which represents the ship\u2019s officers, and the Singapore Organisation of Seamen, which represents the other crew members. The seafarers have since received new cell phones, Duan told CNN Thursday. But the FBI has only returned some of the crew members\u2019 SIM cards, he said. Although investigators have not blamed any individual for the power outages that led up to the fatal crash, seamen have felt an \u201cUnfounded fear of personal criminal liability,\u201d the two unions representing the crew members said. \u201cHowever long the investigation takes, the crew\u2019s rights and welfare should not be infringed upon during its course,\u201d\u00a0Dave Heindel, president of the Seafarers International Union, said in a statement. \u201cWe call on the authorities to be mindful that seafarers utilize mobile devices to conduct personal business for bill payments and more importantly, transfer money to their home country to sustain families,\u201d he said. \u201cCrew members are becoming demoralized without the basic tools we all take for granted.\u201d \u201cThe prolonged detention of MV Dali seafarers aboard their vessel and the failure by authorities to return their personal communication devices are unjust,\u201d Don Marcus, president of the International Organization of Masters, Mates & Pilots, said in a statement. \u201cOur hearts go out to the Master, Officers and Crew of the M/V Dali, who not only suffered a mortifying and tragic experience resulting in the loss of six lives, but who continue to remain in isolation from their loved ones.\u201d Stationary, but not sedentary While they await news about their fates, the crew members are staying busy \u2013 not just with their ship duties but also by helping investigators and salvage crews. \u201cObviously, this is not a normal environment for them. But they\u2019re all professional seafarers, so they\u2019re doing what they need to do,\u201d said Darrell Wilson, spokesperson for Synergy Marine Group \u2013 the company that manages the Dali. \u201cTheir days are full. They have normal duties on board. They need to look after the ship, look after equipment, make sure everything is working and functioning that needs to. They\u2019re also assisting with the salvors.\u201d The seafarers play a critical role in helping the salvage crews because \u201cthey know all the\u00a0passageways. They know where everything is on the ship,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cSo if somebody has a question about where can we hook up to get running water,\u201d the seafarers can help, Wilson said. \u201cThe crew is essentially just assisting in any way possible.\u201d As for who\u2019s helping the crew members with food, toiletries and other day-to-day necessities, Synergy Marine \u201cdispatched reps here immediately \u2026 making sure they have everything they need, helping bring extra supplies on board or arranging for extra supplies to be brought on board,\u201d Wilson said. In addition, \u201cthey have coordinated to have visits by some of the seafarers\u2019 organizations. Some of the seafarers\u2019 ministries have been on. The two respective embassies have been in contact with the crew and even made a visit to the ship,\u201d he said. Synergy has also provided mental health services for the crew, which Duan\u00a0\u2013 the Singapore Maritime Officers\u2019 Union official \u2013\u00a0credits for helping a seaman who was traumatized after he frantically tried to search for survivors the night of the deadly crash. \u201cOne of them actually ran to the front of the vessel, which is the bow, to actually try to look for survivors from the accident\u201d \u2013 despite the heaps of debris from the bridge that could fall at any moment, Duan said. On May 13, after six weeks atop the bow of the Dali, a massive piece of the Key Bridge was blown apart in a series of controlled explosions \u2013 with the crew still on board. Many hoped the removal would mean the crew might be able to set sail or at least get off the ship soon. But more hurdles loom. Their visas expired while they\u2019ve been stuck In addition to the staffing regulations, the ongoing investigations and questions about whether the Dali is fit to sail, the crew members can\u2019t even set foot on US soil. Their one-month visas expired during the nearly two months they\u2019ve been trapped on the Dali, Duan said. Even the ship\u2019s management company doesn\u2019t know when the crew can leave. \u201cThey\u2019re going to be on for the foreseeable future,\u201d Wilson told CNN Wednesday. \u201cWe\u2019re working to refloat the vessel in a few days and move it to a local terminal here. And then at some point in the future \u2013 and I don\u2019t have that date \u2013 the company will look for guidance from the authorities on the next steps with the crew.\u201d Duan,\u00a0who visited the crew April 24 and communicates with the captain regularly, said he doesn\u2019t expect the ship to leave the Baltimore area until authorities have completed their investigation. The National Transportation Safety Board\u2019s preliminary report about the crash did not include a probable cause, which will be part of a final report that could take investigators up to two years to complete. \u201cWithout the final report, I don\u2019t think the vessel is going anywhere\u201d far from Baltimore, Duan said. On Monday, several tugboats towed the vessel to the Port of Baltimore\u2019s Seagirt Marine Terminal \u2013 the same spot the Dali departed from on its ill-fated voyage almost eight weeks ago. There, the ship will undergo\u00a0any necessary, temporary fixes\u00a0before more permanent repairs can be made, officials have said. In the meantime, Duan hopes nonessential crew members will be allowed to get off the ship and stay temporarily on dry land to \u201cease their mental stress.\u201d The crew members\u2019 unions have publicly called for the extension or renewal of the seamen\u2019s visas. Duan also hopes US authorities will re-evaluate who must stay on the ship, and who might be able to fly home. \u2018We take their sacrifices for granted\u2019 The plight of the Dali\u2019s crew highlights the personal sacrifices made by workers who often leave their families for months at a time to provide goods that many consumers use every day. \u201cI think most of us think of the items that we use on a daily basis show up on Amazon or \u2026 Walmart, etc. The reality is 90% of the cargo in the world is carried on vessels,\u201d said Schifflin, the director of the Center for Mariner Advocacy. \u201cVessels are manned by seafarers. And to most of us \u2013 the vast majority of us \u2013 they\u2019re invisible. We don\u2019t even know they\u2019re there. And I think a lot of times, we take their sacrifices for granted.\u201d CNN\u2019s Gloria Pazmino contributed to this report.

It was the last St. Patrick\u2019s Day meal the couple would share. Settle, 58, died from the virus 33 days later, on April 19, 2020, one of nearly 1.2 million people in the United States who have succumbed to Covid-19 since 2020. Ed Koenig, Settle\u2019s longtime partner, remembers Settle\u2019s peaceful face as he visited him in the hospital for the last time. Willie Nelson\u2019s version of \u201cAlways On My Mind\u201d played nearby as Koenig kissed Settle\u2019s forehead through his protective gear. A year ago, the World Health Organization declared an end to Covid-19 as a global public health emergency. The United States allowed its own public health emergency to expire nearly a week after the WHO\u2019s announcement.  Stay-at-home orders have long ended, and much of society has moved on from the pandemic.  But Covid-19-related grief lingers for millions. On the fourth anniversary of Settle\u2019s death \u2013 and driven by a need to mourn \u2013 Koenig wrote about his former partner on the Covid-19 remembrance website WhoWeLost. In part, he shared: \u201cYes, indeed, you will always be on my mind.\u201d The website, launched in 2020 in Kentucky and home to around 2,000 published and yet-to-be-published stories, serves as a digital haven for Koenig and hundreds of others. Those still grieving can write about their losses in a comment-free environment without interactions, judgment, internet trolls and the sometimes toxic nature of social media conversations surrounding the virus \u2013 including whether Covid-19 is even real, according to the website\u2019s founder, Martha Greenwald.  \u201cIt\u2019s their sacred space to say what they need without someone throwing all this cruelty at them,\u201d Greenwald, a poet and former English professor from New Jersey, said of her nonprofit website. Greenwald, who lives in Louisville, Kentucky, started The WhoWeLost Project for bereaved Kentuckians, inspired by the state\u2019s public health commissioner, who in October 2020 called on state residents to share their Covid-19 concerns with him. The project offers writing prompts and guidance for those looking to share their memories. Greenwald expanded the website nationally after a 2021 story on the website from an NPR affiliate garnered widespread praise.  \u201cI think the need for the site, in a way, is larger because less people are paying attention (to Covid-19),\u201d Greenwald told CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the last places that are still paying attention.\u201d Coping with Covid-19-related grief Researchers studying the pandemic\u2019s repercussions have found that grieving relatives of Covid-19 victims experienced higher rates of a prolonged grief disorder when compared with pre-pandemic periods. In general, the disorder, characterized by acute and insistent grief, impacts between 7% and 10% of adults and between 5% and 10% of children, according to the American Psychiatric Association. In a 2023 study, researchers in the United Kingdom found people were more than three times as likely to exhibit prolonged grief disorder symptoms 13 months after losing a loved one during the pandemic than compared with pre-pandemic times. \u201cThere\u2019s this lingering sense that their loved ones and their own grief were never allowed to exist, so it\u2019s very repressed and kind of still simmering under the surface for a lot of them,\u201d Greenwald said of the writers on WhoWeLost.org. \u201c(For) the people whose loved ones died early on during Covid, there were no funerals, so all the stories that could have been told at that wake that didn\u2019t happen. They can write those stories down here.\u201d New York City resident Wiandy Santiago\u2019s 65-year-old brother Wilmard Santiago died of Covid-19 in April 2020, a week after being placed on a ventilator. The family, limited to 10 funeral attendees standing 6 feet apart, couldn\u2019t hold a service for him until two months after his death. She says she wasn\u2019t able to mourn her brother in person with family. \u201c(We) grieved through a Zoom call,\u201d Wiandy Santiago told CNN. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing like being able to sit next to your loved one and grieve your brother, your sister, your spouse, your child.\u201d Her stepson, Alberto Locascio, died of the virus in September 2021, a week before his 40th birthday. \u201cUnless you went through it, you don\u2019t understand why it doesn\u2019t go away,\u201d she said of what she described as \u201ca complicated grief\u201d in a post on WhoWeLost.org. As she spoke, her eyes moistened. She says she has often wondered about her big brother\u2019s final thoughts. He died alone in a Bronx hospital without his wife and two sons by his side. \u201cWhat was he feeling? Was he scared?\u201d Santiago said amid tears, her voice quivering with the pain of never getting to say goodbye. She says she\u2019s sought solace in writing about her late relatives through the WhoWeLost project. Over the past two years, she\u2019s used the site to write poignant stories about the lives of her brother and stepson \u2013 like how Wilmard loved photography and the Yankees, or how Locascio was a kind and gentle soul who their family considered their protector. Scrolling Facebook through recent prom photos of Locascio\u2019s son brought a mix of emotions, she recently wrote on the website. \u201cI was sad for Nicholas who would have loved to have his dad there with him. So happy, yet so sad,\u201d Santiago wrote. She opens up about her lingering grief in many of the posts. \u201cI feel that healing comes from writing, releasing those emotions,\u201d she said. Greenwald agrees. She\u2019s a special adviser for Rituals in the Making, a research project by the anthropology department at George Washington University that has in part examined the ways in which those in mourning adapt when their normal rituals, like funerals, are interrupted. \u201cRituals can really help the surviving family and friends to feel that loss is recognized,\u201d said Sarah Wagner, a principal investigator on Rituals in the Making. \u201cWhen that does not happen, there\u2019s all kinds of ways that mourning stretches on and intensifies, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing with the pandemic.\u201d A safe place to grieve on their own terms Before discovering WhoWeLost, Koenig turned to social media for support from others grieving Covid-19-related deaths, but he says problems often arose in these settings as trolls bombarded\u00a0mourners\u00a0with horrendous comments. \u201cCovid isn\u2019t real, they died of something else.\u201d Koenig says that was a typical response in social media posts. Even as Covid-19 deaths climbed into the tens of thousands during the pandemic, a misinformation-led sector of society, fueled by political polarization, disregarded the virus\u2019s seriousness. Others denied its existence despite evidence from public health experts showing otherwise. A 2020 YouGov study found 13% of people polled in the US believed the coronavirus, or the virus that causes Covid-19, did not exist. The Poynter Institute\u2019s fact-checking website Politifact labeled claims that denied, downplayed or spread disinformation about Covid-19 as its \u201clie of the year\u201d in 2020. Koenig says the most offensive remarks he saw were expletive-filled death wishes hurled toward the LGBTQ+ community. \u201cAll you perverts are going to hell anyway, so what difference does it make?\u201d Koenig recalled reading. On WhoWeLost.org, those coping with prolonged grief are free to share their experiences away from those negative online conversations, Greenwald says. Many of the comments Greenwald says she has seen have involved shaming victims afflicted by more than one condition or disease at a time. \u201cIf someone posted that their mother died of cancer, they would get the usual \u2018sorry for your loss,\u2019 but if they posted that their mother died of Covid, then the comments might be something like, \u2018well, didn\u2019t she have cancer?\u2019 or \u2018she had a heart problem,\u2019 or \u2018she was a smoker,\u2019\u201d Greenwald said. Even when no one is shaming them about comorbidities or denying Covid-19\u2019s existence, Greenwald says the bereaved may feel no one wants to hear about what they\u2019re going through. The WhoWeLost project is still listening, Greenwald says. \u201cI know so many people who will say, \u2018my co-workers don\u2019t want to hear about it, or they tiptoe around the subject,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re still wanting to hear what you have to say even though everybody else wants you to shut up.\u201d Paige Gavin, a master\u2019s student also working on Rituals in the Making, said of WhoWeLost: \u201cThe ability for mourners to reflect on the positiveness of seeing their loved one \u2013 not just in their death, but in the life that they lived \u2013 I think that\u2019s been one of the benefits alongside having a place to tell that story.\u201d Wagner described WhoWeLost as a space for the bereaved to memorialize on their own terms. \u201cGiven that there was so much politicization, I think it is an opportunity for people to reflect on how Covid didn\u2019t define their loved one,\u201d Wagner said. \u201cCovid was so polarizing, and yet, it\u2019s a space that doesn\u2019t have to be about Covid at all.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/18/us/covid-victims-death-memorial-website/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/21/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_05_20_tech_openai-pausing-flirty-chatgpt-voice", "text": "Actress Scarlett Johansson said in a statement shared with CNN on Monday that she was \u201cshocked, angered and in disbelief\u201d that OpenAI CEO Sam Altman would use a synthetic voice released with an\u00a0update to ChatGPT \u201cso eerily similar\u201d to hers. The statement comes after OpenAI said it is hitting the pause button on the update after comparisons with a fictional voice assistant portrayed in the quasi-dystopian film \u201cHer\u201d by Johansson. The retreat by OpenAI follows a backlash to the artificial voice, known as Sky, which critics described as being overly familiar with users and sounded as if it had emerged from a male developer\u2019s fantasy. It was widely mocked for its flirtatious tone. \u201cWe\u2019ve heard questions about how we chose the voices in ChatGPT, especially Sky,\u201d OpenAI said in a post on X Monday. \u201cWe are working to pause the use of Sky while we address them.\u201d Johansson said Altman offered to hire her last September to voice the ChatGPT 4.0 system.\u00a0She said she declined the offer for \u201cpersonal reasons.\u201d \u201cTwo days before the ChatGPT 4.0 demo was released, Mr. Altman contacted my agent, asking me to reconsider. Before we could connect, the system was out there.\u201d Johansson said she hired legal counsel, and said OpenAI \u201creluctantly agreed\u201d to take down the \u201cSky\u201d voice after her counsel sent Altman two letters. \u201cIn a time when we are all grappling with deepfakes and the protection of our own likeness, our own work, our own identities, I believe these are questions that deserve absolute clarity. I look forward to resolution in the form of transparency and the passage of appropriate legislation to help ensure that individual rights are protected,\u201d Johansson wrote. CNN has reached out to OpenAI for comment on Johansson\u2019s statement. The voice in question is not derived from Johansson\u2019s, the company said in a blog post Sunday, but instead \u201cbelongs to a different professional actress using her own natural speaking voice.\u201d OpenAI said that with each of its AI voices, it tried to create \u201can approachable voice that inspires trust,\u201d one that contains a \u201crich tone\u201d and is \u201cnatural and easy to listen to.\u201d The ChatGPT voice mode that used the Sky voice had not yet been widely released, but videos from the product announcement and teasers of OpenAI employees speaking with it went viral online last week. Some who heard Sky derided it as perhaps too easy to listen to. Last week, the controversy inspired a segment on The Daily Show in which senior correspondent Desi Lydic described Sky as a \u201chorny robot baby voice.\u201d \u201cThis is clearly programmed to feed dudes\u2019 egos,\u201d Lydic said. \u201cYou can really tell that a man built this tech.\u201d Even Altman appeared to acknowledge the widespread parallels users were drawing with Johansson when he posted to X on the day of the product\u2019s announcement: \u201cher.\u201d Johansson said Altman used this post to insinuate \u201cthe similarity was intentional.\u201d \u201cHer\u201d is the title of the 2013 film in which Johansson portrays an artificially intelligent voice assistant with whom the protagonist, played by Joaquin Phoenix, falls in love, only to be left heartbroken when the AI admits she is also in love with hundreds of other users and later becomes inaccessible altogether. Questions about leadership The criticism surrounding Sky highlights broader societal concerns about the potential biases of a technology designed by tech companies largely led or funded by White men. The announcement came after OpenAI leaders were forced to defend their safety practices over the weekend after a departing employee called the company\u2019s priorities into question. Jan Leike, who formerly led a team focused on long-term AI safety but left OpenAI last week along with Co-Founder and Chief Scientist Ilya Sutskever, posted a thread on X Friday claiming that \u201cover the past years, safety culture and processes have taken a backseat to shiny products\u201d at OpenAI. He also raised concerns that the company was not devoting enough resources to preparing for a possible future \u201cartificial general intelligence\u201d (AGI) that could be smarter than humans. Altman quickly responded saying he appreciated Leike\u2019s commitment to \u201csafety culture\u201d and added: \u201cHe\u2019s right we have a lot more to do; we are committed to doing it.\u201d The company also confirmed to CNN that in recent weeks it had begun to dissolve the team Leike led, and instead was integrating members of the team across its various research groups. A spokesperson for the company said that structure would help OpenAI better achieve its safety objectives. OpenAI President Greg Brockman responded in a longer post on Saturday, which was signed with both his name and Altman\u2019s, laying out the company\u2019s approach to long-term AI safety. \u201cWe have raised awareness of the risks and opportunities of AGI so that the world can better prepare for it,\u201d Brockman said. \u201cWe\u2019ve repeatedly demonstrated the incredible possibilities from scaling up deep learning and analyzed their implications; called for international governance of AGI before such calls were popular; and helped pioneer the science of assessing AI systems for catastrophic risks.\u201d He added that as AI becomes smarter and more integrated with humans\u2019 daily lives, the company is focused on having in place \u201ca very tight feedback loop, rigorous testing, careful consideration at every step, world-class security, and harmony of safety and capabilities.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/20/tech/openai-pausing-flirty-chatgpt-voice/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/21/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_05_19_us_pennsylvania-pastor-glenn-germany-church-safety", "text": "In the years Pastor Glenn Germany has been leading the small congregation at Jesus\u2019 Dwelling Place, keeping the Pennsylvania church\u2019s doors open has been a struggle. Germany, a full-time bus driver and full-time pastor, knows how important this church is to its community. In addition to religious services, the church \u2013 in the North Braddock borough southeast of Pittsburgh \u2013 provides its primarily low and fixed-income congregants with housing advice, domestic violence and mental health awareness programs, and seminars on everything from improving health to credit scores. To keep it all running, Germany and his family give more than $1,000 out of pocket every month. And now, it seems there\u2019s another critical expense, though one this small church hardly could afford: security. It\u2019s been exactly two weeks since an armed intruder walked into Jesus\u2019 Dwelling Place, pointed a gun at Germany\u2019s head and pulled the trigger, the horrific scene captured via a livestream of the Sunday service. When the gunman tried to fire, though, his weapon jammed, giving the pastor and a cameraman enough time to rush and subdue the suspect until authorities came. Police have not shared what may have motivated the gunman to target the pastor. Germany has said the shooter told him \u201cspirits\u201d got into his head. Then less than a week later, parishioners in south Louisiana helped remove a 16-year-old boy who walked into a Catholic church armed with a gun. The two incidents came roughly three months after law enforcement killed a woman who opened fire inside Lakewood Church in Houston; a 57-year-old man and the shooter\u2019s 7-year-old son were wounded. Now, Germany wants to hire security experts to assess his church\u2019s vulnerability and see how they can secure it. But in the two weeks since the thwarted attack, the church has only been able to raise just over $1,000 in donations, the pastor said. Experts told CNN safety additions such as vulnerability assessments, training, cameras and security personnel can cost several thousand dollars. \u201cIt costs money to hire people, and we don\u2019t have the money,\u201d Germany said. It\u2019s a challenge for religious communities across the US as churches, synagogues, mosques and other places of worship face threats or come under attack in a nation with more guns than people and where shots often explode in places that should be safe. US Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer this month announced an additional $400 million in federal money to help boost security at places of worship. Many places of worship have struggled to balance security while maintaining a warm, welcoming feeling for their attendees. And Germany\u2019s challenges highlight just how much harder conversations around security can be for smaller congregations. \u2018Nothing is sacred, secure or safe\u2019 In San Antonio, the faithful at Pastor Kevin Nelson\u2019s Calvary Baptist Church began new conversations around security after the attack on Lakewood Church, the megachurch of famed televangelist Joel Osteen. Nelson\u2019s church already has cameras and an alarm system \u2013 but those were primarily installed to thwart car break-ins, he said. Calvary Baptist, with roughly 300 regular service attendees, also enlists deacons and other church members who carry concealed weapons to monitor the single entrance it keeps open during services, Nelson said. And it hosts active shooter trainings led by the local sheriff\u2019s office. But now, all that doesn\u2019t feel like enough. \u201cI don\u2019t want our church to become almost like a bank, to where you pull up and you see the police, so I\u2019m really wrestling,\u201d Nelson, a former deputy with the sheriff\u2019s department, told CNN. \u201cBut in the same sense, God\u2019s people and God\u2019s house have to be protected.\u201d Not too far away is an ever-persistent reminder of the threat: Calvary Baptist is just about a 40-minute drive from Sutherland Springs, where a shooter killed 26 people inside a community church in 2017.\u00a0It remains the state\u2019s deadliest mass shooting. Nelson\u2019s church is now considering hiring armed guards, he said. Its leaders are also looking into the federal grant money Schumer announced, though it is a new process requiring time and research, Nelson said. And since the Lakewood Church shooting, during which the attacker walked in with her young son and a rifle, churchgoers at Calvary Baptist have been instructed to be watchful of families entering services, he said. \u201cWhat we\u2019re discovering,\u201d Nelson said, \u201cis nothing is sacred, secure or safe.\u201d Donell Trusty Jr., who provides security and firearms training for places of worship in Maryland through his company Trusty Training Solutions, has seen an uptick in phone calls from churches\u00a0since the attempted shooting in Pennsylvania two weeks ago, he said. Trusty, who is also an elder in his Baltimore church, said he also helps churches contract security officers. He also helps train church volunteers who are licensed to carry weapons in firearm safety, self-defense and situational awareness, he told CNN. Typically, Trusty said, hiring security personnel can cost between $35 and $50 per person hourly. Training courses usually cost $250 to $300 per person, he said. To help out local congregations, Trusty\u2019s company has begun offering free active shooter training to places of worship. \u201cIt is our way of giving back to the local assemblies because it\u2019s what\u2019s needed,\u201d he said. \u201cWe understand the financial crises of the pandemic, membership has been low in a lot of churches \u2026 (and) they don\u2019t really have the finances to put out for some expensive training program.\u201d And active shooter training can help save lives. Rabbi Charlie Cytron-Walker has credited his training in this arena for helping him make a daring escape in 2022 after a hostage-taker joined a worship service at Congregation Beth Israel in Texas. As the attack approached its 11th hour, the rabbi spotted a key moment when the gunman\u2019s guard was down \u2013 just as he had learned in training \u2013 and told others to run, then grabbed a chair and threw it at the assailant, giving the hostages enough time to escape with their lives. Churches now should take an opportunity to renew conversations around safety, conduct risk assessments and reevaluate their security procedures, said Bishop Vashti Murphy McKenzie, president and general secretary of the National Council of the Churches of Christ in the USA, which represents more than 100,000 congregations. Among factors to consider are identifying church members with a background in law enforcement, the military or security, McKenzie said. Other key steps include conducting drills, ensuring all church members know where the nearest exit is or where to go during an emergency, and knowing who would contact authorities if needed, McKenzie said. \u201cSurely, we would all love to believe that it\u2019s not going to happen here, it\u2019s not going to be us. But why take the chance? Let\u2019s prepare,\u201d she said. Every year, the Churches of Christ council hosts discussions \u2013 including about security \u2013 for leaders of Jewish, Muslim, Hindu, Christian and other faiths, McKenzie said. In those spaces, she added, religious leaders have an opportunity to \u201ccompare notes\u201d and learn from each other. A difficult balance for many pastors Nelson, in San Antonio, often thinks about nearby smaller congregations that typically don\u2019t have the financial or human resources to bolster security measures in the same way his church can, he said. He encourages churches to station at least one person to monitor each entrance, and he has tried to spread the word about the federal grant program. Schumer, too, noted the additional challenges smaller congregations face. \u201cFEMA has people who will help if you\u2019re a small synagogue or a small church or a small mosque and you don\u2019t have a grant writer, you don\u2019t know what to do,\u201d he said. Schumer\u2019s May 5 news conference followed a series of hoax bomb threats the prior day against New York synagogues, he said. Places of worship that apply for federal money for bolstered security, such as guards and fences, may be able to get those resources within \u201cmonths,\u201d Schumer said, pointing potential grant recipients to the agency\u2019s website and urging them to apply by Tuesday. Florida-based security company SecureTek Service Group Inc. has been helping low-resource places of worship, including Germany\u2019s church, navigate applications for grants and other types of funding, its founder Rico Reed told CNN. Often, churches with little funding don\u2019t know what kinds of resources are available, and security additions can be costly, with vulnerability assessments in some cases reaching up to $2,000, while camera systems can cost several thousand dollars, he said. \u201cA House of Worship is supposed to be a safe place,\u201d Reed said. \u201cBut it\u2019s actually a soft target. And it takes a while for people that are part of the congregation to understand that times have changed. And it\u2019s really dangerous.\u201d In Tennessee, Lori Morrison has long been talking about the importance of church security, on both her website and her podcast. A former private investigator and now a volunteer on her own church\u2019s security team, Morrison said there\u2019s a tough balance between keeping a church secure and welcoming. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to lock the doors and issue passes,\u201d she said. \u201cBut you can take those common sense precautions.\u201d At her church, team members observe people as they arrive, while others check badges in sensitive areas, like the children\u2019s section, to ensure only approved members enter. There are also trainings throughout the year on safety and preparation for medical emergencies, Morrison said. \u201cWe are supposed to look out for (congregants\u2019) well-being, and so we have to make sure that we\u2019re doing that at the same time that we\u2019re maintaining that openness,\u201d she said. In Pennsylvania, Germany admits he worried before the attempted shooting some parishioners would feel uncomfortable with officers around, or added security could make the church less welcoming. But two weeks ago, someone tried to kill him, he said. And he worries it may happen again. Now, his focus is to make his church safe. He hopes to raise more money, get help to apply for grants, and take all the measures necessary to ensure his community can practice its faith in peace. He hopes other churches \u2013 big and small \u2013 do the same. \u201cI would encourage other churches to use our video as just a springboard to start having thoughts about church security,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause you never think it\u2019s going to happen to you \u2013 until it happens to you.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/19/us/pennsylvania-pastor-glenn-germany-church-safety/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/21/2024", "section": "us"}}

{"id": "2024_05_20_business_trump-media-quarterly-results", "text": "Trump Media & Technology Group lost more than $300 million during the first quarter and generated very little revenue, the owner of Truth Social announced in a press release Monday. The results will raise additional questions about the multi-billion dollar valuation on the newly public company, which is majority owned by former President Donald Trump. Trump Media (DJT) reported a loss of $327.6 million during the first three months of the year driven mostly by one-time losses linked to the deal that brought the company public earlier this year. The company lost $210,300 a year earlier. The company blamed the losses on non-cash expenses from the conversion of promissory notes and the elimination of previous liabilities. Trump Media reported an operating loss of $12.1 million, with a chunk of that being driven by one-time payments related to the closing of its merger with a blank-check company earlier this year. The company generated just $770,500 of revenue, marking the second-straight quarter where its revenue totaled less than $1 million. \u201cI can\u2019t emphasize enough how unusual it is for a company with this little revenue to have this high a valuation,\u201d Matthew Kennedy, senior IPO market strategist at Renaissance Capital, told CNN in an email. In the press release, Trump Media said that at this \u201cearly stage\u201d in its development, the company \u201cremains focused on long-term product development, rather than quarterly revenue.\u201d It acknowledged that its advertising business is just getting off the ground and expressed confidence that new products like streaming will boost its results in the future. \u201cBut if they\u2019re not focused on revenue, public investors have very little to go on. What metrics can we look at? How can investors determine if the company is on the right track?\u201d Kennedy said. \u201cThe company does not provide user\u00a0metrics (though we could look at app downloads or Trump\u2019s followers). It requires a lot of trust, and for now, shareholders seem to be willing to extend an enormous amount of trust. That can quickly change, as we saw in early April.\u201d Trump Media said that it has \u201csufficient\u201d cash to fund the business \u201cfor the foreseeable future.\u201d The company listed a cash balance of $274 million as of the end of March \u2014 a sum boosted by its deal to go public. \u201cAfter an unprecedented, years-long process, we have consummated our merger and dispensed with the vast bulk of merger-related expenses, leaving the Company well-capitalized and supported by a legion of retail shareholders who believe in our mission to provide a free-speech beachhead against Big Tech censorship,\u201d Trump Media CEO Devin Nunes said in a statement. ` Nunes even said Trump Media\u2019s cash balance gives the company the opportunity to explore potential mergers and acquisitions. Experts have said the price tag on Trump Media stock defies logic given the company\u2019s financial results and small footprint in social media. Jay Ritter, a finance professor at the University of Florida\u2019s Warrington College of Business, said \u201crevenue is still anemic\u201d for Trump Media. \u201cAlthough the company is not burning through its ample cash reserves rapidly, it is not generating much revenue, suggesting that there is no reason to think that the company will turn the corner and become profitable in the foreseeable future,\u201d Ritter said. Despite all the fanfare for the public listing earlier this year, Truth Social\u00a0remains a very tiny player in social media. In April, the conservative-friendly social network experienced a 19% year-over-year drop in average daily active US users on iOS and Android to just 113,000, according to market research firm Similarweb. Rival X (formerly known as Twitter) had more than 34 million users on iOS and Android, while Instagram\u2019s Threads had 3.5 million. Trump Media said its financials were reviewed by Semple, Marchal & Cooper, its newly hired accounting firm. The company\u2019s previous accounting firm was\u00a0accused of \u201cmassive fraud\u201d\u00a0by federal regulators this month.

In a statement Monday, Biden called the ICC\u2019s efforts \u201coutrageous.\u201d \u201cLet me be clear,\u201d the president said in the statement, \u201cwhatever this prosecutor might imply, there is no equivalence \u2013 none \u2013 between Israel and Hamas.\u201d Speaking at a White House reception marking Jewish American Heritage Month later Monday, Biden reiterated his stance that the ICC\u2019s pursuit of an arrest warrant is without merit. \u201cIt\u2019s clear Israel wants to do all it can to ensure civilian protection,\u201d Biden said. \u201cLet me be clear: What\u2019s happening is not genocide.\u201d Khan\u2019s pursuit of the warrants gave Biden \u2013 a longtime supporter of Israel and its right to exist \u2013 a chance to speak strongly in favor of the US\u2019 top Middle Eastern ally at a time of tense relations between the president and Israeli leadership. In an interview with CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett earlier this month, Biden put conditions on US aid to Israel for the first time over Israel\u2019s planned invasion of Rafah in southern Gaza. Biden has also had multiple frank phone calls with the Israeli prime minister in recent months as he tries to cajole Netanyahu into pursuing options that don\u2019t involve a military operation in a population center. The announcement marks the first time that the ICC has sought an arrest warrant for the leader of a top US ally, and places Netanyahu in the company of Russian President Vladimir Putin and the late Libyan despot Moammar Gadhafi \u2013 both of whom were subjects of arrest efforts by the ICC. Khan, the ICC prosecutor, batted down criticisms over the tribunal\u2019s efforts to secure the warrants. \u201cNobody is above the law,\u201d he told Amanpour. Neither the US nor Israel are members of the ICC. But if the court were to grant an arrest warrant for Netanyahu or Gallant, the decision would make it extremely difficult for either Israeli leader to travel to any of the 124 countries that are party to the court\u2019s laws, including top US allies such as Britain and Germany, which would compel member nations to cooperate with efforts to extradite those subjected to the warrants. News that the ICC is seeking warrants for the Israeli leaders sent reverberations of condemnation across the world. Britain said the court\u2019s efforts were \u201cnot helpful\u201d in reaching a pause in fighting. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the United States \u201cfundamentally rejects\u201d the court\u2019s announcement, saying it \u201ccould jeopardize\u201d efforts to reach a ceasefire and hostage release deal between the warring parties. Biden administration officials also questioned whether the ICC had the jurisdiction to seek those arrests. House Speaker Mike Johnson, describing the ICC\u2019s efforts as \u201cbaseless and illegitimate,\u201d said House GOP leaders would look at sanctions in response to the court\u2019s decision. National Security Council spokesperson\u00a0John Kirby said the Biden administration plans to stay in close touch with members of Congress but stopped short of committing support for any Republican effort to levy new sanctions on the ICC. Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont \u2014 who caucuses with Democrats even as his position on Israel is frequently at odds with Biden\u2019s \u2014 said he supported the ICC\u2019s decision. Sanders is one of the country\u2019s most prominent Jewish politicians and has been critical of Israel\u2019s war effort. \u201cThe ICC prosecutor is right to take these actions,\u201d Sanders said in a statement, adding it is \u201cimperative that the global community uphold international law.\u201d Despite strong condemnation of the ICC efforts from Biden and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, several senior Senate Democrats pointedly refused to take a position, underscoring the growing rift within the party over Israel\u2019s handling of the war. Asked if she agreed with the ICC decision, Sen. Debbie Stabenow of Michigan told CNN\u2019s Manu Raju: \u201cI would say that I\u2019m not supportive of Netanyahu or Hamas, and I think we\u2019d be able to move forward a lot better if both were to go.\u201d But others aligned themselves with Biden. Sen. Sherrod Brown, who faces a tough reelection in Ohio, criticized the ICC prosecutor. \u201cI don\u2019t see any moral equivalence between the democratic government of Israel and a terrorist group like Hamas, none,\u201d he told CNN. The condemnation of the ICC\u2019s efforts puts the United States in a delicate position. The United States is supporting a separate effort by the ICC to document and investigate Russian war crimes related to its continued operations in Ukraine. Kirby said the US would continue to support those efforts. \u201cI would remind everybody that it is an actual war aim of Mr. Putin to kill innocent Ukrainian people,\u201d Kirby told reporters Monday. \u201cI mean, he\u2019s deliberately targeting civilian infrastructure with the aim of killing innocent civilians. \u201cThat is not what the IDF is doing,\u201d Kirby added. Still, Kirby acknowledged, the United States continues to urge the Israeli government to be \u201cmore discriminative, more targeted, [and] more precise\u201d in its Gaza operations.

{"id": "2024_05_20_economy_fdic-chair-gruenberg-resigns", "text": "Martin Gruenberg, head of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, will step down following a scathing independent investigation detailing pervasive sexual harassment, discrimination and bullying at the agency charged with regulating the banking sector. \u201cIn light of recent events, I am prepared to step down from my responsibilities once a successor is confirmed,\u201d Gruenberg said in a statement on Monday. \u201cUntil that time, I will continue to fulfill my responsibilities as Chairman of the FDIC, including the transformation of the FDIC\u2019s workplace culture.\u201d Gruenberg\u2019s announcement of his intent to resign comes hours after Sen. Sherrod Brown, a top Democrat who leads the Senate Banking Committee, called for \u201cnew leadership\u201d at the FDIC. \ufeffGruenberg joined the FDIC board of directors almost two decades ago. He\u2019s served as chair of the agency for nearly 10 of the past 13 years. President Joe Biden will \u201csoon\u201d announce a new nominee to lead the FDIC, White House Deputy Press Secretary Sam Michel said in a statement on Monday following the news. \u201cWe expect the Senate to confirm the nominee quickly,\u201d he added. However, there\u2019s no guarantee that will happen, since confirmation processes have been known to drag on for months or longer, at which point Biden may no longer be in office. With Gruenberg remaining\u00a0until a successor is named,\u00a0there won\u2019t be\u00a0a situation where Vice Chair Travis Hill, a Republican appointee, automatically becomes chair, leaving the agency deadlocked with one other Republican and two Democratic members on the FDIC\u2019s board of directors. That would have likely stalled significant and controversial banking regulations, such as ramped-up capital requirements, from taking effect. Michel said the administration is grateful for \u201chis willingness to stay at FDIC until his successor is confirmed in order to continue to safeguard our nation\u2019s financial stability during this time of transition.\u201d Sen. Tim Scott, the top-ranking Republican on the Senate Banking Committee, slammed Gruenberg\u2019s decision not to resign immediately as well as Democrats for not putting more pressure on him to do so. \u201cThis draw-it-out strategy makes it clear that this administration is prioritizing their political agenda over protecting workers,\u201d Scott said in a statement. The FDIC commissioned a report by law firm Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton, which ultimately spurred Gruenberg\u2019s resignation. It confirmed the findings of a November Wall Street Journal investigation revealing a long-standing problematic culture. It did not find that Gruenberg alone was responsible for the issues described in depth in the report based on interviews with over 500 employees. However, it documented several instances where Gruenberg lashed out at subordinates \u201cparticularly when being delivered bad news or conveyed views with which he disagrees.\u201d That caused staffers to delay delivering news they feared would upset him. Gruenberg\u2019s temperament \u201cmay hinder his ability to establish trust and confidence in leading meaningful culture change,\u201d the report added. Gruenberg testified before lawmakers last week in a previously scheduled hearing with other top financial regulators, saying he takes \u201cfull responsibility\u201d for the findings of the report. \u201cI also acknowledge my own failures as Chairman, both in failing to recognize how my temperament in meetings impacted others and for not having identified deeper cultural issues at the FDIC sooner,\u201d he said. The FDIC declined to comment beyond Gruenberg\u2019s statement on Monday. A tricky political manuever While most Democrats stopped short of calling for Gruenberg to resign or be replaced, many expressed outrage at the mid-May hearings in the House and Senate that Gruenberg testified at. \u201cI\u2019m pissed off\u2026 If it was me in my office, I\u2019d probably be run out,\u201d said Rep. Gregory Meeks, a New York Democrat during the hearing. \u201cIt just saddens me greatly,\u201d he added, referring to the findings of the independent report. However, Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren labeled the calls Gruenberg received to resign \u201cpurely political exercise.\u201d \u201cYour resignation would do nothing to improve the culture of the FDIC but it would give Republicans a veto over bank policy,\u201d she said at the Senate hearing where Gruenberg testified. For her, it appeared it would be sufficient for him to see through implementing all the recommendations of the report, which he said he would.

{"id": "2024_05_16_us_daniel-perry-texas-pardon-recommendation", "text": "Daniel Perry, a former US Army sergeant who was convicted of murdering a protester at a Black Lives Matter rally in 2020, was released from prison Thursday after he was pardoned by Texas Gov. Greg Abbott. Abbott\u2019s decision comes after the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles voted unanimously Thursday to recommend a full pardon and the restoration of firearm rights for Perry, who was sentenced last year to 25 years in prison. Shortly after he was pardoned, Perry was released from Texas Department of Criminal Justice custody, a spokesperson for the agency told CNN. Abbott asked the board to conduct an investigation in April 2023, and in a statement on Thursday, the board said its \u201cinvestigative efforts encompassed a meticulous review of pertinent documents, from police reports to court records, witness statements, and interviews with individuals linked to the case.\u201d Perry faced between five and 99 years in prison for fatally shooting 28-year-old Air Force veteran Garrett Foster at an Austin, Texas, racial justice rally two months after the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Shortly after Perry\u2019s conviction in April 2023, Abbott said he wanted to pardon Perry and issued an unusual request for the state Board of Pardons and Paroles to expedite a review of the case before a sentence was handed down. \u201cAmong the voluminous files reviewed by the Board, they considered information provided by the Travis County District Attorney, the full investigative report on Daniel Perry, plus a review of all the testimony provided at trial,\u201d Abbott said in a statement. \u201cTexas has one of the strongest \u2018Stand Your Ground\u2019 laws of self-defense that cannot be nullified by a jury or a progressive District Attorney. I thank the Board for its thorough investigation, and I approve their pardon recommendation,\u201d Abbott said. The governor can only pardon Perry if the Board of Pardons and Paroles recommends it, according to Texas law. Foster\u2019s mother, Sheila Foster, said she learned of the pardon from a social media post by the governor and couldn\u2019t believe it. \ufeff\u201cEverything that has happened is wrong on so many levels, and I don\u2019t understand why,\u201d Sheila Foster told CNN\u2019s Laura Coates Thursday. \u201cIt is so crystal clear to me that this man needs to be in prison for the rest of his life \u2013 not a mere 25 years. Why he wouldn\u2019t even have to serve a year? I don\u2019t understand.\u201d Doug O\u2019Connell, an attorney for Perry, said in a statement his client is \u201cthrilled\u201d to be free and thanked Abbott and the Texas Board of Pardons and Parole. \u201cI spoke with Daniel this afternoon. He is thrilled and elated to be free. Daniel is also optimistic for his future,\u201d O\u2019Connell said in a statement obtained by CNN. \u201cHe wishes that this tragic event never happened and wishes he never had to defend himself against Mr. Foster\u2019s unlawful actions. At the same time, Daniel recognizes that the Foster family is grieving.\u00a0We are anxious to see Daniel reunited with his family and loved ones.\u201d Prosecutors said Perry, who was stationed at Fort Hood, initiated the fatal encounter when he ran a red light and drove his vehicle into a crowd gathered at the protest. Foster was openly carrying an assault-style rifle \u2013 legal in Texas \u2013 and approached Perry\u2019s car and motioned for him to lower his window, at which point Perry fatally shot him with a handgun, prosecutors said. \u201cToday, a convicted murderer will walk the streets of Texas. Texas Republicans have once again proven that they cannot keep the public safe, they are not the party of \u2018tough on crime,\u2019 and they are not the party of \u2018law and order,\u2019\u201d Texas Democratic Party Chair Gilberto Hinojosa said in a statement responding to the pardon. He added: \u201cMake no mistake: Daniel Perry is a murderer who was on a mission to commit violence against Texans, and today our justice system was hijacked for political gain.\u201d In a statement on Thursday, Foster\u2019s former fianc\u00e9e, Whitney Mitchell, said she is \u201cheartbroken by this lawlessness,\u201d adding Abbott has shown that \u201conly certain lives matter.\u201d \u201cHe has made us all less safe. Daniel Perry texted his friends about plans to murder a protestor he disagreed with,\u201d she said. \u201cAfter a lengthy trial, with an abundance of evidence, 12 impartial Texans determined he that he carried out that plan, and murdered the love of my life.\u201d \u201cWith this pardon, the Governor has desecrated the life of a murdered Texan, impugned that jury\u2019s just verdict, and declared that citizens can be killed with impunity as long as they hold political views that are different from those in power,\u201d Mitchell said. During Perry\u2019s sentencing hearing last May, the prosecution asked that he be sentenced to at least 25 years in prison. They highlighted a stream of racist and inflammatory social media posts Perry wrote prior to the shooting and the defense\u2019s own analysis of his mental disorders and mindset. \u201cThis man is a loaded gun ready to go off on any perceived threat that he thinks he has to address in his black and white world and his us versus them mentality,\u201d a prosecutor said. Perry\u2019s defense team asked for a sentence of 10 years, citing his lack of criminal history, his psychological issues, including complex post-traumatic stress disorder, and praise from several of his military colleagues. They argued his actions were\u00a0justified as self-defense. Perry told police during an interview that he believed Foster was going to aim the firearm at him, according to\u00a0CNN affiliate KEYE. Foster\u2019s mother was \u201cin shock\u201d after learning of Abbott\u2019s pardon, according to Quentin Brogdon, the family\u2019s former attorney who spoke with the mother on Thursday. \u201cTo say that she is devastated is an understatement,\u201d\u00a0Brogdon\u00a0told CNN in a phone interview. The family had pursued a civil case against Perry\u00a0but dropped the case after he was convicted last year, satisfied with the jury \u201cholding him accountable,\u201d Brogdon said, adding the family will be considering any possible legal avenues but the prospects are \u201cgrim.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s hard to believe that the issuance of this pardon does not have some kind of political motivation,\u201d Brogdon said, citing Abbott\u2019s involvement in the case after conservative commentators criticized Perry\u2019s conviction last year. Perry diagnosed with complex PTSD and autism For the defense, Greg Hupp, a forensic psychologist who examined Perry twice in 2023, testified during his sentencing he diagnosed him with complex post-traumatic stress disorder and autism spectrum disorder. Combined with his military experience, Perry had an \u201cus versus them\u201d mentality in which his mindset was, \u201cI protect myself. I am ready for any imminent attack and anything out there can be a potential threat,\u201d Hupp said. On cross-examination, the prosecution noted that military records did not indicate either of these psychological issues. During Perry\u2019s sentencing, Mitchell testified through tears how her life had changed since his death. Mitchell is a quadruple amputee and said Foster had been her sole caretaker for the past 11 years, helping her get ready for the day, eat and work as a costume designer. They had bought a house in Austin together, and she said it\u2019s difficult to stay there without him. \u201cIt\u2019s hard every day that I\u2019m there. It\u2019s hard to sleep in my bed because he\u2019s not there,\u201d she said. \u201cHe was my main caregiver for 11 years and I\u2019ve had friends who have been taking care of me and have to learn how to do all that stuff that Garrett was doing for me for a decade, and it\u2019s hard because I had to get comfortable being vulnerable.\u201d Perry made comments on social media about killing protesters, documents show Documents related to the case that were unsealed by a Travis County judge following Perry\u2019s conviction show he had a yearslong history of making racist comments in messages and social media posts. In a Facebook message from May 2020, just weeks before the shooting, Perry told a friend he \u201cmight have to kill a few people\u201d who were rioting outside his apartment. The documents also contain a May 2020 text sent by Perry that said, \u201cI might go to Dallas to shoot looters.\u201d Some messages included \u201cwhite power\u201d memes. Perry wrote in a 2019 message that it was \u201cto bad we can\u2019t get paid for hunting Muslims in Europe.\u201d In a June 1, 2020, social media comment, Perry compared the Black Lives Matter movement to \u201ca zoo full of monkeys that are freaking out flinging their sh*t,\u201d the documents show. Clint Broden, Perry\u2019s attorney, criticized the release of the documents in a statement to CNN, calling it a political decision by prosecutors.

{"id": "2024_05_20_politics_hunter-biden-gun-trial", "text": "Hunter Biden is once again trying to delay his fast-approaching trial on felony gun charges, which is scheduled to begin in two weeks. The president\u2019s son has already tried \u2013 and failed \u2013 to postpone the proceedings, which are expected to kick off June 3 at the federal courthouse in Wilmington, Delaware. His lawyers on Monday asked a federal appeals court to rehear his bid to throw out the indictment. A three-judge panel unanimously\u00a0rejected his appeal\u00a0earlier this month, but he\u2019s now asking for the full 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals to review the case. Biden\u2019s legal team also asked the 3rd Circuit to pause any trial proceedings while it considers his new appeal petitions. \u201cThere is no urgency in having an immediate trial of Robert Hunter Biden, but the district court is pressing forward with a June 3, 2024 trial and imposing all the pretrial burdens that come with that,\u201d his lawyers wrote in the filing. The special counsel prosecutors who charged Biden claim he illegally purchased and possessed a revolver in 2018, which allegedly violated federal law because he was using illicit drugs at the time. He has pleaded not guilty to all three felony counts. He is also challenging the constitutionality of the gun statute at the heart of the case and has alleged the charges were politically motivated. In addition to the gun case, Biden is facing a federal tax indictment in California. He is also pursuing appeals in that case and\u00a0trying to delay\u00a0that trial, which is scheduled to begin in late June after the expected conclusion of the gun trial. Special counsel David Weiss filed both cases against President Joe Biden\u2019s son \u2013 the first-ever criminal prosecutions against the child of the sitting US president. Weiss was previously the Trump-appointed US attorney in Delaware but was elevated to special counsel status last year by Attorney General Merrick Garland, a Biden appointee. Hunter Biden wants judge to prohibit testimony about his \u2018alleged extravagant lifestyle\u2019 at trial Hunter Biden wants to block prosecutors from presenting testimony at his gun trial about his \u201calleged extravagant lifestyle,\u201d as they did in his\u00a0separate tax indictment\u00a0in which they described his past spending sprees on luxury cars, strippers, escorts and drugs while he struggled with addiction, his attorneys wrote in a filing. \u201cAny reference to this issue \u2026 would not be relevant to the issues or charges in the Delaware gun case and would be prejudicial beyond any probative value and pose a danger of confusing the issues and misleading the jury,\u201d his lawyers wrote. They proposed witnesses could be directed to stick to the bare bones of the facts and not delve into salacious details. They wrote: \u201cFor example, a witness who testifies to meeting Mr. Biden at a hotel room or having dinner with him, should not be asked such questions as whether the hotel room or meal was extravagant, or how much the hotel room or meal cost.\u201d The filing was part of the routine pretrial maneuvering by both sides in a criminal case. District Judge Maryellen Noreika ultimately gets to decide what can be presented to the jury. Biden\u2019s legal team also wants the judge to prevent prosecutors from telling jurors in the Delaware gun trial that he is facing a separate tax indictment in California. Lawyers for the president\u2019s son also want to make sure that the jury doesn\u2019t hear about his\u00a0paternity dispute\u00a0with the mother of one of his children. The attorneys said Weiss was unlikely to bring up the paternity dispute at the gun trial, but they asked the judge anyway to formally make it out of bounds. Biden initially denied paternity, but a DNA test confirmed he was the girl\u2019s father. The parents later fought over child-support payments and settled the matter last year. The saga put President Biden in an uncomfortable spot, and he publicly\u00a0acknowledged his granddaughter\u00a0for the first time last summer. The girl\u2019s mother, Lunden Roberts, who lives in Arkansas with her daughter, and her attorney Clint Lancaster have both been subpoenaed to potentially testify at Hunter Biden\u2019s tax trial in California, Lancaster told CNN. They previously cooperated with Weiss\u2019 investigation, and the indictment described payments from Biden to Roberts that were part of his alleged tax-evasion scheme. Their subpoenas were first reported by the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette. What both sides want to ask potential jurors Jury selection in the Delaware gun case is scheduled to begin June 3. During the process, Biden and Weiss want to ask potential jurors about heated political topics such as the 2024 election and gun rights, according to a court filing. The opposing sides submitted a joint filing to the judge with a list of questions they agree should be posed to potential jurors. The judge gets the final say on which questions are asked. They want to know whether potential jurors think Biden \u201cis being prosecuted in this case because his father is the President of the United States and a candidate for President\u201d and whether jurors think he is being protected from prosecution for \u201cother crimes\u201d because his father is the president. Biden\u2019s team has argued he is being unfairly targeted because of his famous political family, while some GOP critics claim he\u2019s getting soft treatment because of his father. Both sides also want to know whether potential jurors are closely following the 2024 election, whether they donate to any politicians, or whether they have participated in any campaigns. And they want to know whether members of the jury pool can still be \u201cfair and impartial\u201d despite paying attention to the election. In addition, they want to ask whether potential jurors have ever bought a gun and how they feel about various restrictions on gun possession. One of the proposed questions says: \u201cDo you have any strong views about gun ownership in this country, the gun lobby, or the Second Amendment?\u201d This story has been updated with additional information.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/20/politics/hunter-biden-gun-trial/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/21/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_05_20_us_baltimore-bridge-collapse-ship-relocation", "text": "After 55 days stuck in the Patapsco River, the Dali cargo ship was hauled away from the site of\u00a0its catastrophic crash into the Francis Scott Key Bridge \u2013 a crucial step toward fully reopening the busy Port of Baltimore. The ship\u2019s removal will now allow for \u201call pre-collapse deep-draft commercial vessels to enter and exit the Port of Baltimore,\u201d according to a Monday afternoon news release from the Unified Command, a joint task force composed of multiple government agencies responding to the disaster. The temporary federal channel will \u201csoon be\u201d 400 feet wide and 50 feet deep, the news release said. Officials have said they plan to open the permanent 700-foot-wide by 50-foot-deep federal navigation channel by the end of this month. \u201cThis marks the resumption of commercial vessel transits in and out of the Port of Baltimore,\u201d the task force said in a Monday statement. \u201cThis truly signifies the next chapter in restoring the waterway commerce in this region, which also serves as the economic engine for thousands of workers and their families who depend on commerce traveling through the Port of Baltimore.\u201d Several tugboats started pulling the 106,000-ton vessel at around 7 a.m. Monday, officials said. The ship traveled about 1 mph to the\u00a0Seagirt Marine Terminal in Baltimore. By late Monday morning, the Dali was docked at the terminal \u2013 the same spot it departed from on its ill-fated voyage almost eight weeks ago. There, the ship will undergo any necessary, temporary fixes before more permanent repairs can be made, officials have said. In the meantime, crews will remove any remaining bridge wreckage from the crash site until the channel can be fully reopened, Unified Command said. \u201cWe have refloated and moved the Dali \u2013 achieving in weeks what many thought would take months,\u201d Maryland Gov. Wes Moore said Monday on X. \u201cBut our work isn\u2019t done. We must continue to clear the full 700 foot federal channel, support the workers, businesses, and families affected by the collapse, and rebuild the Key Bridge.\u201d President Joe Biden called the removal a \u201cmark of progress and a promise kept.\u201d Authorities probe the cause of the calamity Federal authorities are still investigating why the cargo ship lost power, veered off course and smashed into the Key Bridge on March 26 \u2013 killing six construction workers. Multiple investigations are underway to try to determine who might be responsible. Last month, Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott announced a probe \u201cto hold the wrongdoers responsible and to mitigate the immediate and long-term harm\u201d to residents. The ship\u2019s Singaporean owner, Grace Ocean Private Limited, and manager, Synergy Marine PTE LTD, filed a petition in federal court last month asking for a $43.6 million limit on potential liability payouts. The city of Baltimore has asked the court to deny that request. The FBI, the US Coast Guard and the National Transportation Safety Board are also investigating.  Last week, the NTSB released a preliminary report saying the Dali had a pair of electrical failures minutes before the collision, as well as two blackouts while the ship was in port one day earlier. One of those in-port blackouts was caused by a crew error, the report said. The FBI and Coast Guard are looking into\u00a0whether the crew failed to report the\u00a0in-port power outage, according to a US official familiar with the matter. The crew has been stuck for nearly 2 months The Dali\u2019s 21-member crew has been confined to the ship since March 26 and will likely have to stay on board \u201cfor the foreseeable future,\u201d the ship\u2019s management company said. There is no immediate plan for what the 20 Indian and one Sri Lankan crew members will do after the Dali is relocated Monday, said Barbara Shipley, mid-Atlantic labor representative for the International Transport Workers\u2019 Federation. The seamen\u2019s one-month visas expired during the nearly two months they\u2019ve been trapped on board, according to one of the unions representing the crew members. The seafarers have been without their cell phones for more than a month because the FBI confiscated the devices as part of their ongoing investigation, Shipley said. \u201cIt\u2019s important to get these gentlemen back home to their families,\u201d she said.

Faculty members were divided Thursday while mulling whether \u201cChancellor Block failed to ensure the safety of our students and grievously mishandled the events.\u201d On the motion to censure Block, 50% of votes cast were in favor. The motion of no confidence in Block garnered 43% of votes in favor. After the vote, University\u00a0of\u00a0California President Michael V. Drake said in a statement: \u201cThese are\u00a0extraordinarily complex\u00a0and\u00a0unprecedented times for American universities. I appreciate\u00a0Chancellor\u00a0Block\u2019s dedication\u00a0and\u00a0commitment\u00a0to\u00a0the University during these difficult times. We will continue\u00a0to\u00a0provide our\u00a0chancellors with the support\u00a0and\u00a0resources they need\u00a0to\u00a0respond\u00a0to\u00a0these ever-evolving situations.\u201d Andrea M. Kasko,\u00a0who serves as the chair of the Academic Senate, called on colleagues to \u201ctry to find common ground\u201d in a\u00a0statement issued\u00a0following the votes. \u201cAs we all process the results of the votes by the Legislative Assembly on May 16, 2024, on the resolutions of no confidence and censure of the Chancellor, it is clear that we are not united in how we view the major events of the past weeks and the campus response to them,\u201d Kasko said. CNN has reached out to Block and UCLA for comment. As part of a movement that swept university campuses throughout the nation, pro-Palestinian protesters set up an encampment at UCLA in an effort to raise awareness about the mass deaths and destruction in Gaza, and calling for the university to divest from any financial ties with Israel. On April 30, law enforcement stood by for hours as counterprotesters attacked the pro-Palestinian encampment,\u00a0which erupted into\u00a0the worst violence stemming from the ongoing college protests around the country over Israel\u2019s war in Gaza. More than 150 students \u201cwere assaulted with pepper spray and bear mace,\u201d and at least 25 protesters ended up being transported to local emergency rooms, according to the encampment\u2019s organizers. While a criminal investigation is still underway into the assaults, a CNN review of footage, social media posts, and interviews found that some of the most dramatic attacks caught on camera that night were committed by people outside UCLA \u2013 not the university students and faculty who were eventually arrested. After the violence and as the university faced criticism, Block announced UCLA\u2019s security operations would change. He said it is clear that \u201curgent changes are needed in how we administer safety operations\u201d in order to best protect the school community. The university also said it is investigating \u201ca group\u00a0of\u00a0instigators\u201d who attacked the encampment, according to a statement from Block. \u201cHolding the instigators\u00a0of\u00a0this attack accountable and enhancing our campus safety operations are both critical. Our community members can only learn, work and thrive in an environment where they feel secure,\u201d Block said in the May 6 statement. Other universities and their leaders have faced backlash over their response to campus protests as well. This week, arts and sciences faculty at Columbia University passed a vote of no confidence in the school\u2019s president, Minouche Shafik, who has been under\u00a0intense scrutiny for her handling\u00a0of campus protests and her congressional testimony on the subject. Last week, the University of Southern California\u2019s faculty senate voted 21-7 to censure USC President Carol Folt and Provost Andrew Guzman over the removal of a protest encampment from campus and the use of Los Angeles police to arrest protesters, among other issues. Faculty and staff express disapproval Hundreds of University of California faculty and staff signed a letter addressed to Block \u201cdecrying the horrific violence perpetrated against our students on April 30, and calling on him to fully protect our students\u2019 safety and security, and to honor their first amendment rights to free speech.\u201d Days later, more than 900 University of California faculty and staff signed a letter demanding Block\u2019s resignation following the arrests at the campus. \u201cFollowing the violent and aggressive police sweep of the Palestine Solidarity Encampment on May 2, 2024, resulting in more than 200 students, faculty, and staff arrested while peacefully protesting, it has become obvious that Chancellor Block has failed our university,\u201d the letter said.

{"id": "2024_05_20_business_what-went-wrong-at-red-lobster", "text": "Last summer, Red Lobster made $20 endless shrimp a permanent menu item. Endless shrimp was a successful annual limited-time offer for Red Lobster for 20 years. But Red Lobster\u2019s latest major shareholder, Thai Union, a Bangkok-based canned seafood company, saw the promotion as a way to sell off the mountains of shrimp it was catching and turned it into an everyday item. (Thai Union became Red Lobster\u2019s largest investor in 2020.) The change cost Red Lobster $11 million. Red Lobster filed for bankruptcy Sunday, and the bankruptcy filing sheds new light on Thai Union\u2019s role in the endless shrimp mishap. Red Lobster said it is investigating the circumstances of that promotion, which Red Lobster management opposed. Under a CEO appointed at the direction of Thai Union, Red Lobster eliminated two of its breaded shrimp suppliers, leaving Thai Union with an exclusive deal to provide shrimp for the chain, the filing said. That led to higher costs, and it did not comply with the company\u2019s typical decision-making process for picking suppliers based on projected demand, according to the chain\u2019s filing. \u201cThis decision created both operational and financial issues for [Red Lobster]\u2026 saddling the company with burdensome supply obligations\u201d to Thai Union, Red Lobster said in the filing. Thai Union did not immediately respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment. Endless shrimp alone didn\u2019t doom Red Lobster. The American poster child for seafood was dragged down by a range of factors, say former leaders at the chain and restaurant analysts \u2014 including handoffs between a mix of investors and corporate parents and Thai Union\u2019s mismanagement. \u201cCertain operational decisions by former management have harmed [Red Lobster\u2019s] financial situation in recent years,\u201d Red Lobster said in its bankruptcy filing. The explosive growth and popularity of fast-casual chains like Chipotle and quick-service chains like Chick-fil-A over the past two decades also squeezed Red Lobster. And years of underinvestment in Red Lobster\u2019s marketing, food quality, service and restaurant upgrades hurt the chain\u2019s ability to add Millennials to its core Baby Boomer customer base. \u201cRed Lobster was the foundation of casual dining. They had a position of power and prominence and revolutionized how American consumers eat seafood,\u201d said Alex Susskind, a professor of food and beverage management at Cornell University, in a previous interview with CNN. But the company didn\u2019t build on that foundation, Susskind said. \u201cRed Lobster had incredible popularity among Baby Boomers. They didn\u2019t bring in a newer generation.\u201d Owned by General Mills When the first Red Lobster opened in 1968 in Lakeland, Florida, an hour south of Orlando, casual dining was in its infancy. The brand was started by southern restaurateurs Bill Darden and Charley Woodsby. Darden owned several Howard Johnson\u2019s restaurants, one of the first casual dining concepts. \u201cOur motto was informal and family prices,\u201d Woodsby\u00a0later said. They saw an opportunity to bring seafood to landlocked people at more affordable prices than fine-dining restaurants. \u201cIn most of middle America, you couldn\u2019t get decent seafood. Red Lobster brought it to the masses,\u201d said Jonathan Maze, the editor in chief at Restaurant Business Magazine, a trade publication. \u201cRed Lobster was part of this casual dining revolution.\u201d Just two years into Darden and Woodsby\u2019s venture, General Mills acquired the brand. General Mills owned brands like Wheaties, Cheerios and Betty Crocker, and the company wanted to enter the restaurant industry with Red Lobster\u2019s five no-frills restaurants. By the early 1970s, with General Mills\u2019 advertising muscle behind it, Red Lobster opened restaurants across the South. Red Lobster rose quickly and was the first casual dining chain to advertise on network television, according to a Harvard Business School\u00a0study. Red Lobster also developed the first national seafood distribution system in the 1970s. \u201cMany diners preferred their seafood fried in those days, and Red Lobster\u2019s hush puppies could be considered an early \u2018signature item,\u2019\u201d Joe Lee, the first general manager at Red Lobster and later its president, said in a journal\u00a0article. \u201cFamilies were welcomed with high chairs and a 59-cent child\u2019s plate.\u201d By 1978, Red Lobster had 236 restaurants and $291 million in sales. It had 372 restaurants and $834 million in sales in 1985. In 1995, General Mills spun off its restaurant division into a new company, Darden Restaurants, named for Red Lobster founder Bill Darden. The company initially included the legacy Red Lobster chain and Olive Garden, an upstart chain General Mills had started in 1982. Red Lobster stalls But Red Lobster fell behind its sister brand Olive Garden under Darden. By 2008, Olive Garden\u2019s sales had eclipsed Red Lobster\u2019s. Darden also acquired fast-growing chains such as Longhorn Steakhouse, Capital Grille and Yard House. \u201cDarden stopped investing in Red Lobster. Things slowly deteriorated,\u201d Les Foreman, a director of operations and divisional vice president at Red Lobster from 2002 to 2022, told CNN. Red Lobster\u2019s sales began declining and Darden prioritized investments in its other brands. Darden soon faced pressure from activist investors pushing the company to split in two. Darden responded to activist pressure by announcing plans in 2013 to\u00a0sell Red Lobster, separating the chain from the rest of its business. The following year, Darden\u00a0sold Red Lobster\u00a0to Golden Gate Capital, a private equity firm, for $2.1 billion. To help fund the deal, Red Lobster spun off its real estate assets in a transaction known as a sale leaseback agreement. Red Lobster had long owned its own real estate but would now be paying rent to lease its restaurants. Sale leasebacks are very common in the restaurant industry, but the arrangement wound up hurting Red Lobster because it became stuck with leases it no longer could afford to pay. \u201cThat produced cost pressures on Red Lobster that they\u2019ve never had before,\u201d said analyst John Gordon. \u201cIt became a problem.\u201d At the same time, fast-casual and quick-service restaurants grew with lower prices, thousands of new drive-thru locations and online delivery. These chains pressured the casual dining sector. Casual dining has slipped from 36% of total restaurant industry sales in 2013 to 31% in 2023, according to Technomic, a restaurant research firm. \u2018Cutting costs everywhere\u2019 Red Lobster\u2019s controlling shareholder Thai Union also hurt the brand, say former employees and analysts. Thai Union was a top supplier of shrimp to Red Lobster for more than 20 years. In 2016, Thai Union took a $575 million minority stake in the brand. In 2020, Thai Union deepened its financial interest in Red Lobster. Thai Union saw an opportunity to grow its business and also become a bigger supplier to Red Lobster. It also tested squeezing Red Lobster\u2019s waitstaff to the breaking point to save on labor costs, switching from waiters covering three tables to 10. Red Lobster executives began to run for the doors under Thai Union\u2019s management, resulting in a huge amount of C-suite churn. In 2021 and 2022, Red Lobster brought on a new CEO, chief marketing officer, chief financial officer and chief information officer. All left the company within two years. Then came the all-you-can-eat shrimp mishap last year. \u201cWe were expecting an increase of 20% in customer traffic, but the actual number was up to 40%,\u201d Thai Union CEO Thiraphong Chansiri said in November. Two months later, Thai Union said it would divest from Red Lobster and take a $530 million loss on its investment. The company blamed the pandemic, as well as \u201csustained industry headwinds, higher interest rates and rising material and labor costs.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m going to stop eating lobster,\u201d Chansiri said this year.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/20/business/what-went-wrong-at-red-lobster/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/21/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_05_18_us_helms-ategeka-college-acceptance-cec", "text": "Helms Ategeka wants to be a pop star. But when he told his dad he planned to pursue a music degree after his graduation next month from high school, his father wasn\u2019t exactly thrilled. So last fall, the Oakland, California, teenager took a different approach: He started applying to colleges. More than 150 of them. Before long, he got an acceptance letter. Then another. And another. The trickle became a flood until there were 122 of them \u2014 along with some $5.3 million in proposed grants and scholarship offers. (CNN has viewed the acceptance letters.) His father says he\u2019s proud of Helms\u2019 3.94 GPA and had hoped his son would pick a career with financial stability, like medicine or computer technology. Or maybe Helms might follow in his own footsteps as a mechanical engineering graduate from the University of California, Berkeley. But as he watched the mountain of acceptance letters in his son\u2019s room get bigger with every mail delivery, Chris Ategeka\u2019s hope dimmed. The messages on the multicolored envelopes beckoned with undeniable enthusiasm.\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re in!\u201d one said. \u201cOur family welcomes your family! read another. \u201cHe\u2019s so confident that music is what he wants to do, it would be a disservice for me to try to guide him otherwise \u2026 that\u2019s why he applied to a gazillion colleges to prove a point,\u201d Ategeka says. \u201cI told him, \u2018You want to be a musician? It takes a lot of hard work.\u2019 And his reaction was, I\u2019ll use my determination to do this to show you how hard I can work.\u201d But how does an 18-year-old begin narrowing down such a massive list of options? And so began a journey that came with tough lessons on change and compromise \u2014 for both father and son. He had a key requirement for the colleges he applied to Helms\u2019 life revolves around music. At Head-Royce High School in Oakland he\u2019s part of an a cappella group that meets every week to belt out covers of popular pop music. His room is stacked with CDs by Beyonc\u00e9, Prince and Bruno Mars. Before he starts college in the fall, he\u2019s taking a summer trip to Peru with a choir to perform in churches and communities. \u201cI live for music. I spend most of my time either listening to music, making music or out there performing,\u201d Helms says. \u201cI feel the most alive and fulfilled when I\u2019m doing something related to music.\u201d So when he started his college application journey, he had one key requirement: The school needed to have a strong music program. He mostly used universities\u2019 online portals for his applications, he says, which made it easier to copy and paste his information to multiple places. His father paid the application fee required by some universities. Helms spent many hours writing essays for different schools, although most were variations of the same personal story. In his essays, he highlighted his passion for music and his background as an immigrant. A small group of schools, including Brown, Wesleyan and Colgate, rejected him or placed him on their waiting list. But the much longer list of schools that said yes spans the country, from big state universities to smaller private colleges: Bard College, Drexel, Howard, Loyola Marymount, Sarah Lawrence College \u2014 and yes, UC Berkeley. He moved to the US just before the pandemic shut down everything Ategeka immigrated to the US from his homeland in Uganda in late 2000s to attend the University of California, Berkeley. He left Helms with his mother in the western Ugandan town of Fort Portal, where he lived until he joined his father in California five years ago. Soon after Helms came to the US in 2019, the world largely shut down due to the coronavirus pandemic. He attended his new school via Zoom and missed out on a big part of interacting with others and learning the nuances of American culture. As a result, he wasn\u2019t sure his college applications would resonate or meet a lot of the requirements, he says. \u201cI gave it my all with the application process. I reached out to the schools to make sure that they\u2019ve received my application and made sure I gave my essays my best shot. But I did not expect so many schools to say yes, so I was not prepared,\u201d Helms says. His modern drama teacher, Ricky Lapidus, is not surprised that Helms has received so many offers. \u201cHelms loves learning \u2014 he\u2019s interested in other people as much as he is in grades,\u201d says Lapidus, head of the Upper School at Head-Royce High School.\u00a0\u201cHe is a deeply empathetic person and that\u2019s how he approaches school \u2014 how do I learn more so I can understand others more? What makes him stand out for a college is a combination of his brains, sure, but also his joy and willingness to explore new things.\u201d He used his father\u2019s words against him Helms spent the past few months studying the websites and social media accounts of schools that accepted him. He\u2019s watched videos of their music programs on YouTube and TikTok to get a sense of where he fits in. And most importantly, he\u2019s had candid conversations with his father about the realities of a career in music. \u201cAs an immigrant parent, I was thinking, \u2018How are you going to pay your bills?\u2019 But he\u2019s a driven kid \u2026 and he used my words against me,\u201d Ategeka says. Through this process, Ategeka says he realized he was viewing his son\u2019s academic quest through what he describes as an \u201cAfrican immigrant mentality\u201d that prioritizes certain lucrative careers as markers of success. \u201cI always tell him that he can be whatever he wants to be and can do anything he puts his mind to. And he was like, \u2018Yeah, this is what I really want to do.\u2019\u201d Ategeka says he\u2019s slowly been embracing his son\u2019s dream to study music and become a pop singer.\u00a0He says he still worries about his future, because he knows how difficult it is to become famous enough to earn a living from your talent. But he admires Helms\u2019 determination and focus, as does his mother in Uganda. Chris Ategeka says his son proved he\u2019s serious about a music career by getting accepted to so many colleges. \u201cHe is really highlighting the idea that he\u2019s not a kid who is failing out of school or running away from home to live in the subway to make the music thing work,\u201d Ategeka says. \u201cHe\u2019s sent the message that, \u2018I know I\u2019m smart. I got the grades. I can get into college. I can do whatever I want. But this is my passion, this is my drive, this is what I chose.\u201d His college choice has a connection to his dad After months of research, Helms made his choice: He will stay nearby and study music at his dad\u2019s alma mater, UC Berkeley. A spokesperson for Berkeley confirmed that he\u2019s been accepted. \u201cI created a spreadsheet, and I wrote out the pros and the cons for each of the schools and really tried to weigh my priorities,\u201d he says. \u201cIf I would like to be close to home, what kind of program each school has or doesn\u2019t have, that kind of stuff.\u201d Watching social media videos of the schools\u2019 concerts and other musical events revealed the quality and diversity of the programs offered, which helped in making his decision, he says. Videos of musical events at Berkeley had a certain joie de vivre, he says, which helped him see himself there. The school also has a wide variety of musical programs, including African music ensembles and a brass quintet. As an immigrant, Helms is part of a growing demographic. Children born abroad or in the US to an immigrant parent accounted for 58% of the increase in the nation\u2019s college enrollment between 2000 and 2018, a study by the Migration Policy Institute shows. \u201cThe face of US higher education is changing,\u201d the study says. \u201cStudents are more likely to come from immigrant families than in the past.\u201d Helms\u2019 new chapter comes at a precarious time for US colleges and universities as Berkeley and other schools grapple with the aftermath of pro-Palestinian student protests that have led to disruptions, arrests and debates about the limits of free speech. But Ategeka says his son\u2019s journey has reminded him to be open to new possibilities and ways of thinking. He believes Helms will find appropriate ways to be a part of difficult campus conversations. \u201cCollege is not about conforming to status quo \u2026 it is ground zero for training leaders who shape the future. It is in college that the young minds rethink the old and build the new for humanity and our planet,\u201d he says. Helms is excited to follow in his father\u2019s footsteps at Berkeley, which has an admission rate of about 12%. Of the nearly 126,000 students who applied in fall of 2023, only about 15,000 were accepted. But most importantly, he says, he\u2019s looking forward to taking the next step toward being a professional musician.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/18/us/helms-ategeka-college-acceptance-cec/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/21/2024", "section": "us"}}

The statues of Clarke and Rose have been in the US Capitol for more than a century, with Rose being installed in 1917 and Clarke in 1921. The National Statuary Hall\u2019s collection includes two statues from all 50 states.  Bates\u2019 statue was installed in the hall on May 3 and officially unveiled on Wednesday, during a ceremony organized by the office of House Speaker Mike Johnson.  The bill to replace Rose and Clarke\u2019s statues was signed in April 2019 by then-Gov. Asa Hutchinson. Soon after, Bates and Cash were chosen as their replacements, CNN reported. Many had called for taking down the previous Arkansas statue representatives, including Clarke\u2019s own great-great-grandson, Democratic state Sen. Clarke Tucker. Citing statements made by Clarke, including his 1894 proclamation that the people of the South had looked to the Democratic Party to \u201cpreserve the white standards of civilization,\u201d Tucker said the change was needed. \u201cIn the context of who represents Arkansas in Statuary Hall, the time has come to move in a new direction,\u201d he said. Rose, meanwhile, had stayed loyal to Confederate Arkansas throughout the Civil War, according to the hall\u2019s website. Cash and Bates were Arkansas natives. Cash was born in Kingsland before his family moved to Dyess in east Arkansas. After moving away for much of his professional career, Cash returned in 1968 to play the \u201cJohnny Cash Homecoming Show,\u201d and again in 1969 to play at Cummins Prison. Bates grew up in Huttig, but moved to Little Rock in 1941, where she and her husband, Lucious Christopher \u201cL.C.\u201d Bates, started the Arkansas State Press, a newspaper devoted to the fight for civil rights. During her time as president of the Arkansas chapter of the NAACP, Bates led the charge for school desegregation, emerging as a key civil rights advocate during the 1957 desegregation of Central High School. Bates died in Little Rock in 1999. \u201cRemoving these kinds of statues isn\u2019t denying history as much as it\u2019s saying, \u2018We acknowledge the true history of it. We acknowledge this was wrong,\u2019\u201d said Benjamin Victor, the sculptor of Bates\u2019 statue. Victor said he sees the replacements as the \u201cright thing to do,\u201d noting the previous statues represent a time in American history \u201cthat was very ugly and awful.\u201d It\u2019s not the first time the US Capitol has had Confederate statues removed from the Statuary Hall. In 2016, Florida state lawmakers voted to replace its statue of Confederate Gen. Edmund Kirby Smith with one of civil rights leader, Mary McLeod Bethune. The statue was officially installed in July 2022, with Bethune making history as the first Black person to have a state-commissioned statue in the Statuary Hall. Victor, an artist from Idaho, has other statues on display in the collection \u2014 including Nevada\u2019s Sarah Winnemucca, Nebraska\u2019s Chief Standing Bear and Iowa\u2019s Norman E. Borlaug. He is the only living artist to have three (now four) permanent portrait sculptures displayed in the Capitol, notes the Nebraska Commission of Indian Affairs \u2013 an organization that helped secure Chief Standing Bear\u2019s statue in 2019. Little Rock-based artist Kevin Kresse, designer of Cash\u2019s statue, has his installation and dedication tentatively scheduled for late September, said Shane Broadway, chairman of the National Statuary Hall Steering Committee. Kresse is a lifelong, self-proclaimed\u00a0\u201cArkansawyer\u201d\u00a0and Cash fan. In choosing the details of Cash\u2019s statue, Kresse included a Bible tucked in his hand and Cash\u2019s signature guitar, which he referred to as Cash\u2019s \u201cbackpack that took him all over the world.\u201d Kresse \u2013 who is 62 now but was 59 at the time of the Capitol commission \u2013 said when Cash was his age, \u201chis star was starting to dim, but he didn\u2019t know at the time that some of his most impactful work was right around the corner\u201d \u2013 much like Kresse\u2019s own career, he said. Kresse doesn\u2019t want the full significance of the moment to be forgotten, he said. \u201c(Both Daisy and Johnny are) two people who stood up for those who are overlooked, passed over and pushed off to the side,\u201d Kresse told CNN. \u201cThey both came from abject poverty and some real trauma and tragedy early in their life and I think it really (caused) both of them to never forget where they came from.\u201d The artists for both statues were selected through a national competition organized by the committee and the Arkansas Capitol Arts and Grounds Commission under the endorsement of Secretary of State John Thurston who also serves as chairman of the commission, Broadway said. While the state of Arkansas handled the entire process of selecting a statue, choosing sculptors, and raising funds, \u201cThe Architect of the Capitol\u2019s Curator oversees the process from Congress\u2019 perspective and coordinates heavily with the states,\u201d Grace White, communications director for the US Committee on House Administration, told CNN in a statement. As a finalist, Victor traveled to Little Rock where he explained his vision to the selection committee while presenting a model of the statue. Victor didn\u2019t know who Bates was prior to entering the competition but felt compelled to help share her story after learning of her \u201cfearlessness.\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s this sort of unsung hero in US history that I love to celebrate,\u201d Victor told CNN. \u201cThis type of hero that everyone should know but relatively few people do know of. And we\u2019re changing that with each of these statues.\u201d Throughout her 1987 memoir \u201cThe Long Shadow of Little Rock,\u201d Bates likens her life to that of a red rose, which Victor incorporated on the statue\u2019s lapel, he said. Above the rose sits a NAACP pin. Victor believes the new statue\u2019s imprint in history will be monumental. \u201cIn that room in Statuary Hall, you got the spot where (Daisy) replaced Uriah Rose (and) it\u2019s right next to (Confederate President) Jefferson Davis. It\u2019s going to be a really powerful setting for Daisy to be included in because Jefferson Davis\u2019s statue is sort of scowling. It looks kind of negative. \u201cAnd Daisy Bates is smiling and striding forward right next to him,\u201d Victor said. \u201cI think it\u2019s this powerful juxtaposition and I hope Mississippi changes their statue (of Davis) soon. But for now, it\u2019s everything we could do to bring somebody like this into the Capitol, change out that corner, and change out that area.\u201d Staring across from Bates, as Victor describes, are statues of Bethune and Rosa Parks. \u201cYou\u2019ve got (figures like) Daisy Bates, Rosa Parks, and Chief Standing Bear (there) because they helped people instead of trying to hurt people,\u201d Victor said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to describe that feeling when (Bates) was installed in the room and the entire change of the room because of it.\u201d CNN\u2019s Katie Bernard, Alex Rogers, Rikki Klaus, Devon M. Sayers, Annie Grayer and Clare Foran contributed to this report.

{"id": "2024_05_16_us_brown-pelicans-california-coast", "text": "Droves of starving brown pelicans have been found stranded on the California coast since late April and the root cause of the event remains a mystery, wildlife watchers say. Arriving dehydrated, starved and injured from fishing lines and hooks, the pelicans are mostly turning up in the Monterey and Santa Cruz areas in Northern California, International Bird Rescue, a nonprofit conservation organization, said on its website. They\u2019re also popping up in \u201codd spots\u201d in Southern California, including a lake at Inglewood\u2019s SoFi Stadium and a fire station in Malibu, the group said The California Department of Fish and Wildlife is \u201cperforming postmortem examinations on brown pelicans sent to our laboratories in Sacramento and Santa Cruz.\u00a0Preliminary findings indicate emaciation as the primary issue contributing to this stranding event,\u201d department spokesperson Tim Daly told CNN in a statement. International Bird Rescue reported more than 260 brown pelicans \u2013 a once endangered species \u2013 have arrived at the organization\u2019s California treatment centers since April 20. \u201cDiagnostic testing has not revealed any evidence of diseases such as bird flu that may be causing these strandings. Bird Rescue\u2019s staff and volunteers are working tirelessly to provide the affected birds with the best care they desperately need to recover and return to the wild,\u201d the group said on its website. The nonprofit said Friday they\u2019re overwhelmed with public donations of surgical tape, syringes, pet hair blow-dryers, waterfowl food, rubber floor mats, gloves and more. Still needed are donations for the cost of fish to feed the pelican patients. The seabirds have displayed this behavior before \u2013 almost exactly two years ago \u2013 in the same areas. And the recovery effort is expensive. In May 2022, the crisis cost the rescue group $45 per day for food, medicine and staff and $2,000 in fish, it said. Before 2022, the last great influx of brown pelicans to International Bird Rescue was in 2012. Two years ago, testing also showed symptoms of starvation in the nearly 800 pelicans that arrived in rehabilitation centers. \u201cIn Spring 2022, the precise factors that contributed to reduced prey intake by the pelicans was not determined although scientists concluded the pelicans likely had difficulty reaching prey fish in the ocean as they normally would,\u201d Daly\u2019s statement said. \u201cIn 2022 and in this current event, strong storm systems occurred in the southern California region in the spring preceding the events, and it\u2019s possible these conditions impacted the pelican\u2019s ability to access prey fish under the water\u2019s surface.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/16/us/brown-pelicans-california-coast/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/21/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_05_16_us_university-of-washington-protests-antisemitic-graffiti", "text": "Pro-Palestinian encampments have been cleared from more US college campuses as school officials have called in law enforcement in recent weeks to quell mounting demonstrations\u00a0over the institutions\u2019 ties to Israel amid its\u00a0military action in Gaza. Here are the latest developments: Arts and sciences faculty at Columbia University have passed a vote of no confidence in the Ivy League school\u2019s president, Minouche Shafik, who has been under intense scrutiny for her handling of campus protests over the Israel-Hamas war and her congressional testimony on the subject. Sixty-five percent of participants said they had no confidence in Shafik, a spokesperson for the New York university confirmed to CNN on Thursday, adding some 900 of its 4,600 full-time faculty voted. Among their concerns were that Shafik\u2019s leadership had \u201cnot only endangered our students; more broadly, it represents a serious threat to the core values of the university: academic freedom, shared governance, freedom of expression, and the right to peaceful assembly,\u201d the Barnard College and Columbia University Chapters of the American Association of University Professors said in a Thursday news release. Shafik \u201ccontinues to consult regularly with members of the community, including faculty, administration, and trustees, as well as with state, city, and community leaders,\u201d Columbia spokesperson Ben Chang said in a statement. Shafik a day earlier sent a message to graduates \u2013 after their university-wide commencement ceremony was canceled following weeks of Gaza war protests \u2013 wishing \u201cthat the challenges you faced during this difficult era will inspire you and make you stronger.\u201d \u201cI know that the last few weeks have been very difficult,\u00a0and\u00a0I am sorry that we were unable to celebrate your commencement in the traditional manner,\u201d she said in her message. Columbia cited security concerns in canceling the large event, a school official told CNN, and instead is holding smaller ones. Acknowledging \u201can extraordinary and tragic set of events\u201d in the Middle East and that \u201cas a great\u00a0university, we must engage with these issues,\u201d the polarization\u00a0at Columbia has caused conflict\u00a0on\u00a0campus, Shafik said. \u201cCanceling the traditional\u00a0commencement\u00a0ceremony was\u00a0one of the toughest calls in a year of many tough calls,\u201d Shafik wrote in an op-ed in the\u00a0Columbia\u00a0Daily Spectator, noting her top priority has been the safety of students, faculty and staff. \u201cThe conflict between the rights of pro-Palestinian protesters and the impact that their protests have had\u00a0on\u00a0some members of our Jewish community is what makes this moment singularly fraught,\u201d she said. UC Irvine returns to in-person classes after nearly 50 protesters detained: The University of California, Irvine, will resume in-person instruction and campus operations will return to normal on Friday, according to a school spokesperson. Classes went remote Thursday after law enforcement personnel used zip ties to restrain demonstrators the prior evening at the university before escorting them\u00a0away from a pro-Palestinian protest encampment and toward a parking lot. University spokesperson Tom Vasich said 47 people were arrested, including 26 students, two employees and 19 other individuals. Those who were arrested were taken to the Orange County Jail, where booking and processing were completed. \u201cThey were then released on citation,\u201d Vasich said. Vasich had earlier told CNN 50 people were arrested, but revised the number to 47 later Thursday. Most of those taken into custody were cited for failure to disperse after a direct police order and a few were arrested for trespassing, Vasich said, adding a full breakdown of how many of those arrested are students or faculty is expected to be released later on Thursday. \u201cA group of several hundred protestors entered the UC Irvine campus and began surrounding\u201d the school\u2019s Physical Sciences Lecture Hall at\u00a0around 2:30 p.m., Wednesday, the school said in an emergency update. The\u00a0university\u00a0put out a mutual aid call to local law\u00a0enforcement\u00a0and got help from the\u00a0Irvine\u00a0Police Department and Orange County Sheriff\u2019s Department, it said. Authorities cleared\u00a0what looked like at least half\u00a0of student protesters at\u00a0the encampment, aerial footage from\u00a0CNN affiliate KABC\u00a0showed. Pro-Palestinian protesters had set up a campus encampment on April 29, when the university also\u00a0called in\u00a0local law enforcement. Days later, the school\u2019s chancellor said the university would continue to negotiate with student protesters demanding their university cut financial ties to Israel over the nation\u2019s military action in Gaza. UC Berkeley Pro-Palestinian protesters arrested after occupying building: Law enforcement arrested at least 12 people Thursday evening as they cleared a condemned building at the University of California, Berkeley, that was being occupied by pro-Palestinian protesters, school spokesperson Dan Mogulof told CNN. Protesters broke into the university\u2019s Anna Head complex with sticks and bolt cutters on Wednesday, where they broke windows and spray-painted walls, police said. The university on Thursday estimated about 60 people were in the building and said the occupation was \u201cnot nonviolent civil disobedience.\u201d The protesters were arrested on suspicion of destruction of property, breaking and entering and trespassing, according to Mogulof. During the occupation, a Palestinian flag hung from the building, where protesters had set up tents, footage from CNN affiliate KGO shows. Images from the Jewish Community Relations Council\u00a0Bay Area show the building\u2019s interior walls covered in what the group called \u201cantisemitic graffiti,\u201d reading, \u201cZionism is Nazism\u201d and \u201cMartyrs never die.\u201d \u201cThe Star of David, the most recognizable symbol in Judaism, is seen equated with a swastika,\u201d the council said Wednesday in an X post. \u201cThis is not protest, this is pure hate.\u201d The building\u2019s takeover came a day after the UCB Divest Coalition\u00a0agreed to end its campus encampment following discussions with university leadership. The coalition did not initiate the break-in at the Anna Head complex, Mogulof said. UC Berkeley\u2019s chancellor was relieved to bring the encampment protests to a peaceful end, noting the school\u2019s leadership does not support full divestment from Israel at this time, she said. \u201cThe sale of direct investments is not within the authority of the Office of the Chancellor but rather lies with the UC Regents,\u201d Carol Christ wrote Tuesday in a letter\u00a0to the Free Palestine Encampment. If all divestment demands by students were met, the University of California system would have to sell $32 billion of its $175 billion portfolio, UC\u2019s Chief Investment Officer Jagdeep Singh Bachher said Tuesday during an Investments Committee meeting held as part of this week\u2019s monthly UC Board of Regents meeting at its Merced campus. University of Washington president calls for encampment break-up as antisemitic graffiti found on campus: After\u00a0protests escalated at the University of\u00a0Washington\u00a0\u2013 with \u201coffensive\u00a0graffiti\u00a0across multiple\u00a0buildings\u00a0all\u00a0over\u00a0campus, some quite clearly both antisemitic\u00a0and\u00a0violent\u201d \u2013 the school\u2019s president is calling again for the voluntary dismantling\u00a0of\u00a0a pro-Palestinian encampment on\u00a0the Seattle campus. Students and faculty on Wednesday discovered the graffiti, which has \u201ccreat(ed) an unwelcome\u00a0and fearful environment for many students, faculty\u00a0and staff, especially those who are Jewish,\u201d President Ana Mari Cauce said later that day in a statement, calling the situation \u201cuntenable.\u201d Cauce asked for the tent camp to break up, echoing her entreaty last week to demonstrators \u201cto dismantle the encampment\u00a0voluntarily for everyone\u2019s safety.\u201d \u201cMuch to my dismay, given the relatively cordial tone\u00a0of\u00a0many\u00a0of\u00a0our discussions, the representatives also said the new\u00a0graffiti\u00a0is an intentional escalation to compel the\u00a0University\u00a0to agree to their demands,\u201d she said Wednesday, adding university officials \u201chave engaged sincerely\u00a0and\u00a0openly.\u201d Among protesters\u2019 \u201cescalating demands\u201d is \u201ca new department that would have an \u2018anti-Zionist\u2019 litmus test for faculty hiring,\u201d Cauce said in the statement. \u201cMany\u00a0of\u00a0these demands, especially the most recent, are contrary to academic freedom\u00a0and/or to state or federal law.\u201d \u201cWhile I strongly support free speech\u00a0and\u00a0peaceful\u00a0protest, I also strongly support the rights\u00a0of\u00a0all\u00a0our community members to live, learn\u00a0and\u00a0work without fear,\u201d she\u00a0said. \u201cThe\u00a0University\u2019s response to students\u2019\u00a0calls\u00a0for change will not be based on an encampment.\u201d DePaul\u00a0University protest\u00a0encampment removed by police: Police in riot gear moved protesters away and dismantled tents Thursday morning at a pro-Palestinian protest encampment at DePaul University in Chicago, video from\u00a0CNN affiliate WLS\u00a0shows.  Two protesters accused of blocking nearby traffic were arrested, school spokesperson Russell Dorn told CNN, adding no arrests were made in the campus quad. The decision to dismantle the encampment came after \u201cgood faith efforts\u201d to negotiate with organizers, DePaul President Robert Manuel said. \u201cFrom the beginning of the\u00a0encampment, I have said that\u00a0we would protect free speech and the ability to dissent until it either prevented us from carrying out the operations of our university or threatened the safety of the members of our community,\u201d Manuel\u00a0said\u00a0in an open letter to students and employees. \u201cI am deeply saddened to say the encampment has crossed that\u00a0line.\u201d University buildings have been vandalized with graffiti, and the cost to repair the physical damage to the quad, which will be \u201cclosed to everyone\u201d until further notice, appears to be nearly $180,000, Manuel said in his letter. The DePaul Divestment Coalition \u2013 a multiethnic, multifaith student group \u2013 has been calling on DePaul to \u201cdivest from killing and harm abroad\u201d since its encampment was set up April 30. \u201cDePaul\u2019s administration chose to use violence to disperse the encampment and unilaterally withdrew from negotiations,\u201d Benjamin Meyer, an attorney representing the coalition said. \u201cThe students sent administration a calendar invite for a meeting on Monday, in which none of the administrators attended.\u201d Morehouse College could stop graduation if Biden\u2019s speech is disrupted: Morehouse College\u2019s president has vowed to combat any disruptive behavior during President Joe Biden\u2019s scheduled graduation speech Sunday at the preeminent historically Black institution by shutting down commencement \u201con the spot.\u201d \u201cSo, for example, prolonged shouting down of the president as he speaks,\u201d Morehouse College President David A. Thomas told CNN\u2019s Victor Blackwell on Thursday.\u00a0\u201cI have also made a decision that we will also not ask police to take individuals out of commencement in zip ties. \u201cIf faced with the choice, I will cease the ceremonies on the spot if we were to reach that position.\u201d Biden\u2019s visit to the Atlanta campus approaches as he seeks to convince young voters to send him to the White House for another term, even as many have expressed frustration for his administration\u2019s continued support of Israel\u2019s military campaign in Gaza.

{"id": "2024_05_20_politics_biden-fundraising-april", "text": "President Joe Biden\u2019s political operation raised $51 million in April \u2014 a significant decline from its March fundraising, according to totals released by his campaign Monday. Biden\u2019s campaign and affiliated committee still ended the month with $192 million in the bank, according to his aides \u2014 a war chest they described as the highest cash-on-hand figure for any Democratic candidate in history and one they say positions the president to compete effectively with former President Donald Trump. Trump\u2019s aides announced earlier this month that he had raised more than $76 million for his campaign and allied committees in April, after the GOP\u2019s presumptive nominee ramped up his joint fundraising operation with the Republican National Committee and headlined high-dollar fundraisers, even as he spends parts of his week on trial in a Manhattan criminal court. Biden\u2019s political operation had announced raising more than $90 million in March, bookended by a fiery State of the Union speech at the start of the month and a high-profile fundraiser in New York at the month\u2019s end that featured him with two of his predecessors, former Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama. Fundraising has been one of the bright spots for Biden\u2019s campaign as he battles persistently low poll numbers and close contests in key battleground states. His aides on Monday took pains to try to cast the slower fundraising pace in a better light, pointing to what they said were signs of enduring small-dollar support and organizational strength. In a statement, Biden campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez said the April haul reflected \u201cstrong consistent grassroots enthusiasm for reelecting\u201d Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris. She said Trump\u2019s campaign \u201ccontinues to burn through cash\u201d and has \u201cno ground game.\u201d Biden\u2019s campaign said April was the strongest month for recurring donors so far, with those contributors giving more than $5.5 million. They also said the campaign added a million more supporters to its email lists last month. The Biden team said it has used its money to build a ground operation with more than 150 offices and more than 500 staffers across key battleground states. Monday is the deadline for presidential campaigns and the national political parties to file monthly reports on fundraising and spending with federal election regulators. Trump\u2019s campaign aides have not released cash-on-hand totals for all the committees affiliated with his election effort, but Trump\u2019s campaign report, filed Monday night, shows it ended April with $49.1 million remaining in the bank, only modestly better than the $45.1 million the campaign had in its war chest at the end of March. Both candidates have been hitting the money-raising circuit in recent weeks. Biden is slated to appear at a Los Angeles fundraiser next month with Obama and actors George Clooney and Julia Roberts.

I\u2019m brokenhearted,\u201d Gillman said. \u201cAfter weeks when the encampers assured our community that they were committed to maintaining a peaceful and nondisruptive encampment, it was terrible to see that they would dramatically alter the situation in a way that was a direct assault on the rights of other students and the university mission.\u201d Authorities cleared\u00a0what looked like at least half\u00a0of student protesters at\u00a0the encampment, aerial footage from CNN affiliate KABC showed. At least a dozen people were seen being detained in the video. Law enforcement used zip ties to restrain protesters and escorted them\u00a0away from the encampment toward a parking lot. It\u2019s unclear exactly how many people were detained during the incident. CNN has reached out to the Irvine Police Department, the Orange County Sheriff\u2019s Department and UC Irvine to confirm the number of protesters who were detained. Law\u00a0enforcement\u00a0started breaking up the\u00a0encampment\u00a0at\u00a0the\u00a0university shortly after 5:10 p.m. Wednesday, aerials show. The aerial footage shows a large cluster of police officers surrounding the group of tents outside the hall as they face a line of several protesters, and a number of protesters can be seen getting detained. Protesters seemingly attempted to reestablish a barrier\u00a0taken down earlier by law enforcement\u00a0by piling wood panels and tents on top of one another.\u00a0Live pictures from KABC show\u00a0law enforcement\u00a0dismantling these structures. A sign on the building behind the encampment says \u201cUC Divest from genocide\u201d and another under it appears to say \u201cdrop suspensions defend students.\u201d A large sign hung next to those on the building reads \u201cAlex Odeh Hall,\u201d seemingly referencing the Palestinian activist who served as the West Coast regional director of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee. The\u00a0majority of the protesters have dispersed from\u00a0their encampment, but a small group of people remained scattered in a grassy area nearby, footage from KABC and KCAL show. \u201cProtest activity continues in the Physical Science Quad and Aldrich Park areas,\u201d the university said. \u201cPlease avoid the area until further notice.\u201d Classes were canceled for the remainder\u00a0of\u00a0the day Wednesday and the\u00a0university\u00a0urged people to stay away from campus, according to the emergency update. The university initially asked anyone in the area to shelter in place, but later said they should leave the area. Classes will be\u00a0held\u00a0remotely Thursday, the university said in an\u00a0emergency update. Divestment negotiations were ongoing Pro-Palestinian protesters had established an encampment on the campus on April 29. That day, the university called in local law enforcement officials to assist campus police with the protest. Days later, Gillman said in a statement to the campus community that the university would continue to negotiate with pro-Palestinian demonstrators on campus over issues of divestment. Student protesters opposing Israel\u2019s military action in Gaza have largely demanded their universities sell investments in companies with financial ties to Israel. The university presented a proposal to student leaders and received a counterproposal in early May. Gillman expressed concerns over some of the requests included in the counterproposal, according to the statement. \u201cThe counterproposal calls for ending numerous external partnerships that support our students through scholarships and facilitate long-standing research collaborations,\u201d Gillman said. \u201cIt also demands an end to a wide-range of academic and research collaborations with Israeli organizations and individuals. This would violate fundamental principles of academic freedom and would require us to discriminate based on a person\u2019s nationality, which goes against our commitment to anti-discrimination and our principles of diversity, equity, and inclusion.\u201d In the statement, Gillman also thanked student protesters for ensuring that their encampment \u201cremains peaceful and minimally disruptive of university activities.\u201d \u201cAs long as this remains the situation, there is no cause to involve law enforcement, except as needed to help ensure the safety of the protestors and others in the area,\u201d he said at the time. In his Wednesday statement, Gillman said UC Irvine \u201calong with most other UC campuses, received the latest \u2018demands\u2019 from the protesters\u201d earlier that day. The demands \u201cattempted to dictate that anyone who disagreed with them must conform to their opinions,\u201d Gillman said. \u201cBut my concern now is not the unreasonableness of their demands. It is their decision to transform a manageable situation that did not have to involve police into a situation that required a different response,\u201d Gillman said in the statement. Irvine Mayor says protests are \u201cnot a threat\u201d In response to UC Irvine\u2019s law enforcement presence, Irvine Mayor Farrah N. Khan said protesters don\u2019t threaten campus security and shouldn\u2019t be met with violence. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame that peaceful free speech protests are always responded to with violence. Taking space on campus or in a building is not a threat to anyone,\u201d Khan said in a post on X Wednesday. \u201cUCI leadership must do everything they can to avoid creating a violent scenario here. These are your students w/ zero weapons.\u201d The United Auto Workers 4811, which represents 48,000 University of California academic workers, has authorized a strike \u201cif circumstances justify,\u201d citing \u201cnumerous, egregious unfair labor practices committed\u201d during on-campus protests. Specifically, the union mentioned the handling of protests on April 30 and May 1 at the University of California, Los Angeles. The union said in a press release that 19,780 teaching assistants, readers, tutors, student researchers, postdocs and academic researchers at all eleven campuses of the University of California participated in a strike authorization vote, resulting in 79% of participating members voting to authorize the executive board to call a strike if it\u2019s justified. During such a strike, \u201cnot all represented workers are called to go on strike at the same time. Certain campuses may be called to go out on strike at certain times,\u201d the union added. \u201cAt the heart of this is our right to free speech and peaceful protest,\u201d said Rafael Jaime, a graduate worker in the English department and president of UAW 4811.\u00a0\u201cIf members of the academic community are maced and beaten down for peacefully demonstrating on this issue, our ability to speak up on all issues is threatened.\u201d On Friday, the union\u2019s executive board will \u201cevaluate and announce\u201d whether or not they will call on the first campus or campuses to strike, the\u00a0UAW 4811 posted on X.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/us/law-enforcement-detains-protesters-university-of-california-irvine-encampment/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/21/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_05_15_us_william-lawson-houston-obituary-reaj", "text": "Rev. William Lawson, a long-time civil rights advocate and founder of Wheeler Avenue Baptist Church in Houston, has died, according to an obituary posted on the church\u2019s website.\u00a0He was 95. Lawson\u00a0was known as \u201cHouston\u2019s Pastor;\u201d a\u00a0trusted voice in the community who\u00a0ushered the city through\u00a0times of crisis and change. In 1962, he\u00a0founded\u00a0the Wheeler Avenue Baptist Church where he was the pastor for more than 40 years. He later joined the\u00a0civil rights movement led by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.,\u00a0whom he considered to be a close friend, the church\u2019s obituary stated. Lawson also set up a local chapter of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), a civil rights organization that was instrumental during the civil rights movement. \u201cLawson, in particular, was known to help build bridges between the powerful and the powerless, as a champion of social justice and community service,\u201d\u00a0the\u00a0church posted. Houston Mayor John Whitmire\u00a0held\u00a0a moment of silence at\u00a0Houston City Hall on Tuesday\u00a0to honor Lawson.\u00a0He encouraged\u00a0Houstonians to \u201cstrive for a fair, safe, and equal Houston in his honor and memory.\u201d \u201cHe is one of the reasons our city is so great,\u201d Whitmire said. \u201cHe helped us during civil rights and social justice like probably no other individual in the country because Houston benefited from his leadership and character.\u201d \u201cI, like so many Houstonians, I am deeply saddened by the passing of Rev. William Lawson-a Houstonian icon and pillar of our community,\u201d Democratic Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee said in a\u00a0post\u00a0on X. In a statement to CNN,\u00a0Harris County Commissioner Rodney Ellis\u00a0called Lawson a \u201ctowering figure in our community.\u201d \u201cHe was a pioneering force in the Civil Rights movement, courageously hosting the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. at his church and supporting the brave Texas Southern University students during the sit-ins that spurred integration in our city. His commitment to justice and equality knew no bounds.\u201d Ellis\u00a0also noted that the city\u00a0recently named a park in honor of Rev. Lawson and his late wife. \u201cThe Reverend William and Audrey Lawson Park will serve as a lasting tribute to their shared commitment to uplifting every member of our community,\u201d the statement read. In 2021,\u00a0Rice University honored\u00a0the longtime pastor\u00a0by naming part of its campus \u201cThe Reverend William A. Lawson Grove.\u201d \u201cIf there\u2019s anything that I\u2019d like for my legacy to be, it is for the different cultures of humankind to get to know each other, to respect each other and, if possible, to love each other,\u201d\u00a0Lawson said at the\u00a0unveiling. His daughter,\u00a0Melanie Lawson, an anchor\u00a0with ABC13\u00a0in Houston, was by his side at the ceremony. \u201cWhen it\u2019s your Dad,\u00a0you don\u2019t really think how special they are. It\u2019s only through the vision of other people that you realize what a difference he made,\u201d\u00a0she said at the event. Rice University President Reginald DesRoches said Rev. Lawson\u2019s legacy will resonate through generations. \u201cMay future generations be reminded of his enduring impact as a beacon in the civil rights movement every time they walk through the grove named in his honor on the Rice campus,\u201d\u00a0President DesRoches said on the school\u2019s\u00a0remembrance\u00a0page. Rev. Lawson will lie in state at Wheeler Avenue Baptist Church Thursday.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/us/william-lawson-houston-obituary-reaj/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/21/2024", "section": "us"}}
