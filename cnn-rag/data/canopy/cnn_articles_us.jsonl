{"id": "2024_06_13_us_washington-makah-tribe-harpoon-whales", "text": "The United States granted the Makah Indian Tribe in Washington state a long-sought waiver Thursday that helps clear the way for its first sanctioned whale hunts since 1999 and sets the stage for renewed clashes with animal rights activists. The Makah, a tribe of 1,500 people on the northwestern tip of the Olympic Peninsula, is the only Native American tribe with a treaty that specifically mentions a right to hunt whales. But it has faced more than two decades of court challenges, bureaucratic hearings and scientific review as it seeks to resume hunting for gray whales. The decision by NOAA Fisheries grants a waiver under the Marine Mammal Protection Act, which otherwise forbids harming marine mammals. It allows the tribe to hunt up to 25 Eastern North Pacific gray whales over 10 years, with a limit of two to three per year. There are roughly 20,000 whales in that population. The tribe celebrated the decision but said it took far too long. \u201cWhaling remains central to the identity, culture, subsistence, and spirituality of the Makah people, and we regard the Gray Whale as sacred,\u201d Makah Tribal Council Chairman Timothy J. Greene Sr. said in a written statement. \u201cIn the time since our last successful hunt in 1999, we have lost many elders who held the knowledge of our whaling customs, and another entire generation of Makahs has grown up without the ability to exercise our Treaty right or experience the connections and benefits of whaling that our ancestors secured for us.\u201d The hunts will be timed to avoid harming endangered Western North Pacific gray whales that sometimes visit the area \u2014 about 200 to 300 remain \u2014 as well as a group of about 200 gray whales that generally spend summer and fall feeding along the Northwest coast. Nevertheless, some hurdles remain. The tribe must enter into a cooperative agreement with the agency under the Whaling Convention Act, and it must obtain a permit to hunt, a process that involves a monthlong public comment period. Animal rights advocates, who have long opposed whaling, could also challenge NOAA\u2019s decision in court. DJ Schubert, a senior wildlife biologist with the Washington, DC-based Animal Welfare Institute, said his organization would object to the issuance of the hunt permit but likely wait until final approvals are given before deciding whether to sue. He noted that while the Eastern North Pacific gray whale population appears healthy now, it has fluctuated wildly in recent years, and no one knows how the whales will fare as climate change continues to affect the Arctic. Scientists estimate that as much as\u00a040% of the population died off\u00a0from 2018 to last year before it began to recover. \u201cWe completely respect the tribe\u2019s cultural practices and traditions,\u201d Schubert said. \u201cWe just fundamentally disagree that they need to hunt whales to continue those traditions. We hope that as this decision-making process plays out, perhaps the Makah Tribe and the government could reconsider the need to hunt whales and advocate for protection instead of persecution.\u201d Archeological evidence shows that Makah hunters in cedar canoes killed whales for sustenance from time immemorial, a practice that ceased only in the early 20th century after commercial whaling vessels depleted the population. By 1994, the Eastern Pacific gray whale population had rebounded, and they were removed from the endangered species list. Seeing an opportunity to reclaim its heritage, the tribe announced plans to hunt again. The Makah trained for months in the ancient ways of whaling and received the blessing of federal officials and the International Whaling Commission. They took to the water in 1998 but didn\u2019t succeed until the next year, when they harpooned a gray whale from a hand-carved cedar canoe. A tribal member in a motorized support boat killed it with a high-powered rifle to minimize its suffering. It was the tribe\u2019s first successful hunt in 70 years. The hunts drew protests from animal rights activists, who sometimes threw smoke bombs at the whalers and sprayed fire extinguishers into their faces. Others veered motorboats between the whales and the tribal canoes to interfere with the hunt. Authorities seized several vessels and made arrests. After animal rights groups sued, the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals overturned federal approval of the tribe\u2019s whaling plans. The court found that the tribe needed to obtain a waiver under the 1972 Marine Mammal Protection Act. Eleven Alaska Native communities in the Arctic have such a waiver for subsistence hunts, allowing them to kill bowhead whales \u2014 even though bowheads are listed as endangered. The Makah Tribe applied for a waiver in 2005. The process repeatedly stalled as new scientific information about the whales and the health of their population was uncovered. Some of the Makah whalers became so frustrated with the delays that they went on a rogue hunt in 2007, killing a gray whale that got away from them and sank. They were convicted in federal court.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/13/us/washington-makah-tribe-harpoon-whales/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/14/2024", "section": "us"}}

But the man and his former attorney say he has never stepped foot in Spain and have insisted he is innocent. David Knezevich, 36, was arraigned and pleaded not guilty on Monday to a kidnapping charge in federal court in Miami \u2013 four months after his wife was last seen in Madrid, according to court records. His wife, Ana Maria Knezevich Henao, has not been heard from since February 2, the day a man wearing a face covering and helmet \u2013 who prosecutors allege was Knezevich \u2013 entered her apartment building in Madrid and spray-painted the lens of a building surveillance camera. About an hour later, the man emerged from an elevator with a suitcase, according to the criminal complaint. Before Knezevich\u2019s arrest in Florida in May, his attorney at the time, Kenneth Padowitz, told CNN that his client \u201chas never been to Spain\u201d and had nothing to do with the incident. But investigators allege Knezevich has been tied to the crime using the can of spray paint, security camera footage, stolen license plates and rental car records, as well as messages he sent to a woman he\u2019d met on a dating app. If convicted, the husband faces a maximum sentence of life in prison. How FBI investigators built their case Knezevich\u2019s current attorney, Jayne C. Weintraub, filed a request on Monday to the court for a hearing on the court\u2019s order of detention, asking to cross-examine an FBI agent regarding new evidence and allegations in the case since a detention hearing last month. The couple had lived in Florida and were planning to divorce, but the separation had become tense because Knezevich didn\u2019t want to evenly split their assets, the criminal complaint said. Padowitz, however, told CNN in February that the split was amicable. Henao had moved to Spain in December and had been living in an apartment in an apartment in Madrid\u2019s upscale Salamanca neighborhood, court documents said. When Henao disappeared from her apartment in February, Knezevich was far away in his native Serbia, Knezevich\u2019s former attorney Padowitz has said. But federal officials said records show Knezevich flew from Miami to Turkey in January and then went to Belgrade, Serbia, where he rented a small car on January 29. The owner of the rental car agency told investigators that when the car was returned in mid-March, someone had tinted its windows and added a new license plate frame, and it had traveled nearly 4,800 miles, the criminal complaint said. Toll booth cameras captured images of the same model Peugeot, with tinted windows, near Madrid in the late night and early morning of February 2 and 3. It had\u00a0license plates stolen from another vehicle on the Madrid street where Henao was living, the complaint said. Shortly after 9 p.m. the night of Henao\u2019s disappearance, a man wearing a face covering and helmet but with \u201cphysical characteristics\u201d resembling Knezevich entered her apartment building and partially obscured the surveillance camera with spray paint, investigators said. Spanish investigators identified the brand of spray paint and determined that a Madrid retailer had sold the same paint, along with two rolls of duct tape, to a man who resembled Knezevich the same day Henao was last seen, the criminal complaint said. Henao, a US citizen originally from Colombia, was in constant communication with her loved ones while overseas. She was planning a trip to Barcelona with her friends on February 5, her brother told CNN, but she abruptly stopped communicating and never showed up for the trip. Two days before the trip, her friend Sanna Rameau received a puzzling WhatsApp message from Henao indicating she was abruptly leaving town with a man she had just met. The message, seen by CNN, read: \u201cI met someone wonderful!! He has a summer house about 2h (hours) from Madrid. We are going there now and I will spend a few days there. Signal is spotty. I\u2019ll call you when I get back.\u201d Henao and Rameau had spoken by phone just hours before her disappearance but she had not mentioned meeting a dreamy stranger, Rameau told CNN. Investigators allege the texts sent from Henao\u2019s phone were really sent by her husband. He is believed to have asked another Colombian woman whom he had met on a dating app to help translate the messages into Colombian, court documents said. The message he sent to the unidentified Colombian woman to translate was the same one sent from Henao\u2019s phone saying she\u2019d met a new guy, court documents said.

Survivors Hughes Van Ellis, Viola Fletcher and Lessie Benningfield Randle initally filed the lawsuit in 2021. Ellis died last year at the age of 102. The lawsuit was previously dismissed by an Oklahoma district court judge, who agreed with the city of Tulsa that \u201csimply being connected to a historical event does not provide a person with unlimited rights to seek compensation.\u201d The plaintiffs appealed the case to the state\u2019s Supreme Court which acknowledged Wednesday that the \u201cgrievance with the social and economic inequities created by the Tulsa Race Massacre is legitimate and worthy of merit.\u201d \u201cHowever, the law does not permit us to extend the scope of our public nuisance doctrine beyond what the Legislature has authorized to afford Plaintiffs the justice they are seeking,\u201d the court wrote in its decision. Ellis, Fletcher and Benningfifeld Randle had argued that they had a right for reparations under the city\u2019s public nuisance statute. They also said the city of Tulsa was getting \u201cunjust enrichment\u201d by promoting the site of the massacre as a tourist attraction \u201cwithout returning any of those benefits to members of the community.\u201d \u201cThe destruction of forty-square blocks of property on the night of May 31, 1921 through murder and arson clearly meets the definition of a public nuisance under Oklahoma law.\u00a0Faithful application of the law compels the conclusion that Mother Randle and Mother Fletcher have stated a claim for relief,\u201d attorneys for Fletcher and Benningfield Randle said in a statement after the decision. \u201cThey are entitled\u00a0to\u00a0a trial.\u00a0Yet the Court held that Mother Randle and Mother Fletcher have asked the Court\u00a0to\u00a0decide a \u2018political\u2019 question that is beyond the purview of the Court,\u201d the attorneys added. In 1921, the Greenwood neighborhood was a thriving Black-owned business district in Tulsa, Oklahoma. On May 31, 1921, a White mob laid waste to about 35 blocks of the neighborhood within 16 hours, arresting thousands of Black residents, while robbing, beating and killing others, CNN previously reported. Historic photos show entire blocks gutted by flame and people lying in the street. Insurance companies later denied many claims filed by Black business owners over what today would be worth tens of millions of dollars in property damage, including the destruction of two Black hospitals and 1,256 residences, according to the Greenwood Cultural Center, CNN previously reported. Attorneys for Fletcher and Benningfield Randle said in their statement that they plan to file a petition for rehearing with the Oklahoma Supreme Court, asking the Court\u00a0to\u00a0reconsider its decision. They also called on the US Department of Justice\u00a0to\u00a0open an investigation into the\u00a0massacre\u00a0under the Emmett Till Unsolved Civil Rights Crime Act of 2007. Viola Ford\u00a0Fletcher, 109, previously told CNN if she and her family had not been forced to leave their home and community with essentially just the clothes on their backs, \u201cI would\u2019ve gotten an education, to where I could get a better job, especially being a nurse.\u201d Fletcher told CNN she \u201cnever got over\u201d what she experienced that day and still remembers \u201cpeople getting killed, houses, property, schools, churches, and stores getting destroyed with fire.\u201d \u201cIt just stays with me, you know, just the fear. I have lived in Tulsa since but I don\u2019t sleep all night living there.\u201d Lessie Benningfield Randle\u2019s family previously urged the court to \u201chonor\u201d the survivors \u201cwhile they are still with us.\u201d\u00a0They noted that Ellis, also\u00a0known as Uncle Redd, \u201cwaged this (legal) battle until his final breath.\u201d \u201cWe must not allow the stories of the LAST TWO SURVIVORS to be buried alongside them. Justice for Mother Randle and Mother Fletcher is overdue!\u201d In a previous legal brief filed in the case, Attorney Damario Solomon-Simmons aruged the Oklahoma Supreme Court could be the survivors remaining opportunity to receive justice after all these years. \u201cThere is no going to the United States Supreme Court. There is no going to the federal court system.

{"id": "2024_06_12_us_pamela-smart-case-timeline", "text": "A forbidden relationship between a teacher and her student started with an affair and ended in the 1990 killing of the teacher\u2019s husband. Pamela Smart, then 22, was a high school media director when she began an affair with 15-year-old Billy Flynn. In her trial, prosecutors said Smart then coaxed Flynn into carrying out the murder plot with two teenage friends. Flynn admitted to killing Gregg Smart, along with two accomplices, and all three worked out plea bargains. Smart\u2019s trial \u2014 one of the first in the US to allow cameras in the courtroom \u2014 riveted the world with its mixture of sex, adultery and the story of the intimate relationship between an adult and a juvenile. More than 20 years later, the story is back in focus with Smart, who is serving life in prison, accepting responsibility for her husband\u2019s killing for the first time. Here\u2019s a timeline of Pamela Smart\u2019s murder conspiracy plot, the resulting legal cases and convictions. The shooting May 1, 1990: On this evening, teenager Flynn said, he and a friend ambushed Gregg Smart, Pamela\u2019s husband, as he arrived home to his condo in Derry, New Hampshire. The husband was on his knees, begging for his life, according to prosecutors. Flynn fired a bullet into Smart\u2019s head in a hallway where his wife later found his body. The teenagers made the scene look like a break-in. Pamela Smart\u2019s storyline was part of the inspiration for Joyce Maynard\u2019s 1992 novel \u201cTo Die For,\u201d which was later adapted into a 1995 movie starring Nicole Kidman and Joaquin Phoenix. August 1, 1990: Smart was arrested three months after the shooting. Her mother, Linda Wojas, said she was never told her daughter was a suspect at the time, she told CNN\u2019s Larry King in 1991. A riveting trial January 28, 1991: Flynn, 17, and two accomplices, Patrick Randall, 17, and Vance Lattime Jr., 18, pleaded guilty to the shooting death of Gregory Smart, according to the Associated Press. All were facing first-degree murder charges but pleaded guilty to charges related to second-degree murder and were given lighter sentences in exchange for testimony against Smart, CNN reported. That same night, Raymond Fowler, 19, was arrested in connection with the plot, according to the AP. Police said the charges were from a separate attempt on Gregory Smart\u2019s life before the actual murder. March 4, 1991: Oral arguments began in Smart\u2019s murder conspiracy trial in the Rockingham County Superior Court in Exeter, New Hampshire. Smart was on trial on suspicion of plotting the murder of her husband just before their first wedding anniversary. Prosecutors alleged Smart was after her husband\u2019s $140,000 life insurance policy. Smart allegedly seduced Flynn and threatened to stop having sex with him unless he killed her husband, prosecutors said. The trial drew a lot of attention \u2014 people lined up and had to have tickets to enter the courtroom. People who couldn\u2019t get in watched from TV monitors in another room, while television crews and reporters crammed into the press room. Convictions March 22, 1991: Smart was convicted of being an accomplice to first-degree murder, conspiracy to commit murder and tampering with a witness. She was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. August 20, 1992: Flynn was sentenced to 28 years to life in prison for second-degree murder as part of his negotiated plea deal, according to CNN affiliate WMUR. Flynn had sobbed on the witness stand during Smart\u2019s trial, saying he didn\u2019t want to lose her, who he called his first love, so he went forward with her plan, as reported by CNN. August 23, 1992: Randall, one of the accomplices, was sentenced to 40 years to life in prison with 12 years of the minimum sentence deferred for second-degree murder, according to WMUR. His sentence was later reduced. The getaway car driver, Lattime, was sentenced to 18 years to life in prison, as part of his plea deal, according to WMUR. Fowler, a passenger in the car, was sentenced to 15 to 30 years in prison as part of his plea deal. The appeals July 2005: The state\u2019s Executive Council denies Smart\u2019s request for a pardon hearing, according to WMUR. May 15, 2019: The Executive Council voted to deny Smart of a commutation hearing, according to WMUR. New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu agreed with the council\u2019s decision. March 23, 2022: The Executive Council rejected Smart\u2019s third request, according to the AP. Smart went to the state Supreme Court, which dismissed the petition. Freedom for some March 12, 2015: After serving 25 years in prison, Flynn was paroled, according to WMUR. It was his 41st birthday. Flynn and Randall were released on parole on June 4, 2015, according to WMUR. And Fowler and Lattime were out on parole the year prior. Accepting responsibility June 11, 2024: For the first time, Smart accepted full responsibility for the death of her husband in a videotaped statement Tuesday, according to the AP. The video was released as a part of her most recent request for a sentence reduction. Smart asked Gov. Sununu and the state\u2019s Executive Council for a commutation hearing, as she has exhausted her other court appeals options. Smart is serving life in prison at Bedford Hills Correctional Facility in Westchester County, New York.

{"id": "2024_06_13_business_faa-boeing-oversight-too-hands-off", "text": "Federal Aviation Administration chief Mike Whitaker said his agency is partly responsible for the safety problems at Boeing, admitting that it had been \u201ctoo hands off\u201d in its oversight of the troubled aircraft manufacturer. In testimony Thursday before the Senate Commerce Committee, Whitaker said that his agency now had far more inspectors on the ground at Boeing factories and the factory of its primary supplier, Spirit AeroSystems. He said it will continue to push Boeing to improve its safety culture in the wake of the January 5 incident in which a door plug blew off during an Alaksa Airlines flight, leaving a gaping hole in the side of the Boeing 737 Max. But he also said that the FAA was not blameless in that incident. \u201cLet me also acknowledge the FAA should have had much better visibility into what was happening at Boeing before January 5,\u201d he said in his opening remarks to the committee. \u201cThe FAA\u2019s approach was too hands off, too focused on paperwork audits and not focused enough on inspections. We have changed that approach over the last several months. And those changes are permanent,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have now moved to a more active, comprehensive oversight model - the audit plus inspection approach.\u201d Whitaker, who was confirmed to his job heading the nation\u2019s primary aviation regulator in October, said he will be visiting Boeing\u2019s South Carolina factory himself tomorrow, and its plant that makes the 737 Max in Renton, Washington in September. Whitaker said that the FAA previously had 24 inspectors at Boeing and Spirit and that the number was in the low 30s now. Its target is 55 inspectors, although he did not give a date for when that would be in place. And he said that number could change over time. \u201cWe can no longer afford to remain reactive,\u201d he said. A preliminary report by the National Transportation Safety Board has found that bolts necessary to keep the door plug on the Alaska Air plane in place were missing from the plane at the time it left the Boeing factory in Washington roughly two months before the flight. Under questions at Thursday\u2019s hearing, Whitaker said the FAA did not have any inspectors in the factories at that time when the piece was put in. Instead the FAA staff was focused on paperwork audits instead of actual inspections. \u201cWe clearly did not have enough folks to see what was going on in that factory,\u201d he said. Safety experience\u2026 in the dairy industry But finding the inspectors could be a problem. Sen. Maria Cantwell, the Washington Democrat who is chair of the committee, questioned the backgrounds of some of the safety inspectors. \u201cI\u2019m definitely hearing \u2018We don\u2019t have enough aviation inspectors.\u2019 And \u2018We don\u2019t even have enough qualified instructors at schools,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cOne story I heard was that they said, \u2018Yes, I have safety experience. But it\u2019s in the dairy industry.\u2019 We need an aviation inspector on the floor who has aviation experience, not just safety experience.\u201d Whitaker responded that while the agency is having to provide some training for new hires, it is finding the experienced inspectors it needs for Boeing. \u201cWith respect to Boeing, we\u2019re putting our most experienced and best people on this,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly the most important issue we\u2019re dealing with right now.\u201d But for years the FAA has relied on employees of Boeing and other manufacturers to inspect their own companies, then report to the FAA, under what is known as \u201cdelegation of authority.\u201d That structure is still in place, even with more FAA employees now on the floor at Boeing factories. That reliance on self-inspection and self-certification first started getting attention in 2019 after two fatal crashes of the 737 Max that killed 346 people and led to a 20-month grounding of the plane. The fact that much of the certification of the Max, a relatively new aircraft, was done by Boeing employees, not FAA staff, raised questions in Congress and an outcry among families of some of the crash victims. In January, after the Alaska Air flight, Whitaker joined those who suggested the process needed to be changed. \u201cIt is time to re-examine the delegation of authority and assess any associated safety risks,\u201d said Whitaker a week after the incident. \u201cThe grounding of the 737-9 and the multiple production-related issues identified in recent years require us to look at every option to reduce risk.\u201d In February the FAA gave Boeing 90 days to come up with a plan to improve safety. And in late May when the plan was submitted, the FAA announced it was leaving a limit on production levels in place until safety improves. \u201cThere must be a fundamental shift in the company\u2019s safety culture in order to holistically address its quality and safety challenges,\u201d Whitaker said on Thursday. \u201cThis is about systemic change, and there\u2019s a lot of work to be done.\u201d But he said there has been a shift in tone in discussions between the FAA and Boeing executives since the January incident. \u201cMy focus has been on making it clear this is a very long-term journey. You don\u2019t change the culture of an organization. We\u2019ve seen an increasing recognition that this is a long journey ahead.\u201d Boeing also said it has made significant changes since January. \u201cWe listened to our employees, engaged transparently with our regulator, welcomed the findings and recommendations from the FAA \u2026. and invited scrutiny from customers and independent experts,\u201d it said in a statement when asked for a comment on Thursday\u2019s hearing. \u201cWe will work under the FAA\u2019s oversight and uphold our responsibility to the flying public to continue delivering safe, high-quality airplanes.\u201d  This story has been updated with additional reporting and context.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/13/business/faa-boeing-oversight-too-hands-off/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/14/2024", "section": "us"}}

Detectives tell Lorincz no one they had interviewed had made statements about Owens saying that she wanted to kill Lorincz. \u201cThese people said that she was saying to come outside,\u201d the video shows one detective telling Lorincz. \u201cShe wanted to confront you about something, she wanted you to come outside.\u201d The Owens family previously told CNN Lorincz harassed Owens and her children and used racial slurs toward them prior to the killing. Lorincz admitted using racial slurs against neighborhood children in the past, according to an\u00a0arrest affidavit. The video also shows detectives asking Lorincz whether she had searched Florida laws on self-defense and \u201cstand your ground,\u201d to which she replied she had searched the topic earlier in the day, after she saw \u201cthey had it up on Facebook.\u201d \u201cI know what you\u2019re thinking \u2013 that I looked at the laws so I could do something. No,\u201d Lorincz tells detectives. Before placing Lorincz under arrest, detectives explain that her actions the day of the shooting did not appear reasonable. \u201cFrom everything I\u2019ve seen, it doesn\u2019t rise to the level for you to justify shooting through a closed door and with a firearm, OK. And I think you know that that wasn\u2019t reasonable what you did,\u201d one of the detectives says, questioning why the shot that killed Owens was fired only two minutes after Lorincz got off the phone with a dispatcher while calling 911 and requesting police. \u201cTwo minutes \u2013 to me it was much longer,\u201d Lorincz says. At the end of the interrogation, the video shows Lorincz being given the opportunity to write Owens\u2019 children a note, which she does while waiting for deputies to return. When deputies return to transport Lorincz to jail, the video shows she initially refuses arrest, repeatedly saying \u201cI can\u2019t do this,\u201d and exclaiming \u201cI don\u2019t care. Kill me!\u201d She eventually stands up and is handcuffed. Jury selection in the case against Lorincz is set to begin June 17, court records show.

{"id": "2024_06_12_us_big-5-sporting-goods-shooting-washington", "text": "An armed man who \u201ctook it upon himself\u201d to conduct surveillance outside a sporting goods store in suburban Seattle has been charged with murder after he fatally shot in the back a teenager who had an airsoft gun in his pocket, prosecutors said. Aaron Brown Myers, 51, was charged with second-degree murder and second-degree assault in the killing of the 17-year-old, identified as H.R., according to court documents. The teen was shot once in the side and at least six times in the back, and he died at the scene, the documents state. \u201cIn this case the defendant attacked three teenagers who had not committed any crime and at every stage of the interaction chose to escalate with more and more violence until it culminated in the defendant taking the life of 17-year-old H.R.,\u201d King County senior deputy prosecuting attorney Lauren M. Burke wrote in a case summary and request for bail. In a statement on Wednesday, attorneys for Myers said he was a \u201cprofessional security consultant\u201d and argued he fired in self-defense. \u201cWe are confident that over the course of this investigation the evidence will show that Mr. Myers\u2019 only intent that day was to protect himself and others from serious harm or death,\u201d attorneys Michelle Scudder and Zachary Wagnild said in an email to CNN. The incident began the evening of June 5 when H.R. and two other teenagers approached a Big 5 Sporting Goods store in Renton, Washington, according to the court documents. H.R. had an airsoft gun in a pocket, and a teenage friend, identified as B.A., had an airsoft gun in his coat pocket, according to court documents.  Myers, who is not a member of law enforcement, had decided to conduct \u201coverwatch\u201d at the parking lot and \u201cimmediately assumed\u201d the three teens were about to commit a violent robbery, the prosecutor wrote. Overwatch is a military term for surveilling a location. He exited his vehicle and pointed his pistol at the trio, commanding them to stop, drop their guns and get on the ground, the documents state. The teens complied and B.A. put the airsoft gun on the ground, saying it was just a \u201cBB gun,\u201d according to the prosecutor. The 51-year-old then tackled B.A. and pinned him to the ground, the documents state. H.R. had his hands in the air and was backing away, and Myers then shot at him at least seven times, killing the teen, according to the case summary. Myers was arrested at the scene and remains in custody at the King County Correctional Facility on $2 million bail, according to jail records. His arraignment is set for June 24. His attorneys said he acted because he believed he was witnessing a crime in progress. \u201cMr. Myers and his family are devastated by this tragedy and the fact that it resulted in the loss of a young man\u2019s life,\u201d the attorneys wrote. \u201cOn the evening in question Mr. Myers sincerely believed that he was witnessing the beginning of an armed robbery when he observed three young men pass his truck on their way into a store that was adjacent to the location where his son was attending a martial arts class. \u201cWhen he saw one of the men remove a firearm from his waistband Mr. Myers, a professional security consultant, intervened quickly in the hope of stopping the robbery before anyone got hurt.\u00a0Unfortunately, during the confrontation Mr. Myers became in fear for his own life and fired his duty weapon to defend himself.\u201d Incident was captured on surveillance video According to a probable cause document filed by the Renton Police Department, parts of the incident were captured on surveillance video from the Big 5 store and a martial arts business. CNN is working to obtain the videos, which have not been released publicly. According to the document, the video shows Myers approaching two of the teens and pointing a pistol at them, causing B.A. to put down the airsoft pistol and show his empty hands. H.R. also had his fingers extended to show his hands were empty and started to turn his body, the document states. Both his hands were initially raised over his head, and his right arm then briefly lowered before Myers \u2013 who was straddling B.A. on the ground \u2013 opened fire, the document states. B.A. told detectives he and H.R. liked to go into the woods and shoot things, but H.R.\u2019s airsoft gun was having issues, so they were going to the sporting goods store to exchange or return it, the document states. B.A. said his airsoft gun had been in his coat pocket, and H.R. did not take out his airsoft gun, according to the documents. \u201cB.A. said that they told Myers numerous times that the guns were BB guns,\u201d the document states. After he was shot, H.R. called out for his mom, the third teenager, identified as S.A., told investigators. In an interview with police, Myers said he conducts \u201coverwatch\u201d at the location and \u201chas seen numerous crimes occur in the parking lot in the past,\u201d according to a probable cause affidavit. Myers stated he saw three males walk in front of his parked vehicle and noticed one had a gun, and he believed they were going to commit an armed robbery, the affidavit says. \u201cMyers said that he felt like he did not have time to call 911, and that he felt he had a duty to act to stop the individuals from hurting someone innocent,\u201d the affidavit states. The affidavit states that \u201cmany\u201d of the details Myers told police were \u201cnot consistent\u201d with the surveillance video. Myers had previously been involved in a March 2022 incident in which he chose to \u201cintervene\u201d when he mistakenly believed someone was armed, according to the document. In that case, Myers called 911 to report that a person on a bicycle was pointing a gun at people, and Myers said he had a pistol and may have to intervene, the affidavit states. Myers then followed the bicyclist and told police he thought he might have to shoot the person. Officers arrived at the scene and determined the bicyclist\u2019s item was not a gun but \u201ca silver metal object that was possibly a part to a bicycle,\u201d the document states. Burke, the prosecutor, wrote that this prior incident \u201cestablishes that this self-imposed \u2018duty to intervene\u2019 is part of the defendant\u2019s regular approach to interacting with the public.\u201d \u201cOnly a high bail, electronic home detention, and surrender of all firearms will protect the community from an untrained civilian who believes he has a duty to shoot people who have not hurt anyone,\u201d she wrote.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/12/us/big-5-sporting-goods-shooting-washington/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/14/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_11_us_ucla-campus-palestine-protests-arrests", "text": "A total of 27 people were arrested after setting up multiple pro-Palestinian encampments on\u00a0UCLA\u2019s\u00a0campus Monday that police said were unlawful, according to a\u00a0statement\u00a0from\u00a0UCLA\u00a0leadership. At least six University of California Police Department personnel and other safety officers were injured during confrontations with protesters, including one person with a head injury, said Rick Braziel, UCLA\u2019s associate vice chancellor for campus safety, in\u00a0a release Tuesday.  UCPD Capt. Scott Scheffler said at least five of those arrested reported minor injuries, including soreness, bruises and shoulder pain. As a result of the encampments, the group damaged a fountain, spray-painted brick walkways, tampered with fire safety equipment, damaged patio furniture, stripped wire from electrical fixtures and vandalized vehicles, police said. Of the 27 arrested, 18 are UCLA students and two are faculty members, police said Wednesday. Of the other seven, one is a former student, and the rest are not affiliated with the university, according to police. Monday\u2019s incidents were \u201ccompletely unacceptable,\u201d Braziel said Tuesday. \u201cThe demonstration activity disregarded our values as a community, violated our campus policies and broke the law. These actions injured people, threatened the safety of our community and vandalized our campus,\u201d Braziel said. While protests spread at college campuses this spring denouncing Israel\u2019s handling of its war against Hamas in Gaza, UCLA\u2019s campus turned into a scene of brutality on April 30 when violent counterprotesters attacked pro-Palestinian demonstrators. A CNN analysis found that some of the most dramatic attacks caught on camera that night were committed by people outside UCLA \u2013 not the university students and faculty who were eventually arrested. But on Monday, a group of about 100 people associated with a\u00a0UCLA\u00a0registered student organization set up an encampment at the top of the Janss Steps around 3:15 p.m., UCPD said. The group resisted leaving the area after initial warnings but left after UCPD issued multiple dispersal orders. The protesters relocated to the Kerckhoff patio, where they \u201cset up an unauthorized and unlawful encampment with tents, canopies, and barricades with patio furniture,\u201d police said. The group also entered Moore Hall and disrupted nearby final exams, police said. Another round of dispersal orders led the group to the courtyard between Dodd Hall and the School of Law, where they set up a third encampment, according to police. UCLA Associate Professor Graeme Blair, a member of Faculty for Justice in Palestine, said one student went to a hospital after getting wounded by a rubber bullet \u2013 which Blair said was fired when students were in the camp near Dodd Hall, the Los Angeles Times reported. Blair, who has participated in the protests, criticized authorities, saying students had been following dispersal orders throughout the evening. CNN has reached out to Blair for comment. A UC police representative declined to comment on the arrests or say whether \u201cless than lethal\u201d weapons were used, the Times reported. UCLA police did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment Tuesday about the arrests and whether rubber bullets were used. On Monday evening, about 25 people were arrested around 8 p.m. for willful disruption of university operations, the police statement said. Those people were cited, issued a 14-day stay-away order from\u00a0UCLA\u00a0property and released, police said. Another person was previously arrested during the setup of the first encampment for interfering with a police officer. That person was cited and released, UCPD said. About 150 protesters remained in the area as of 10:30 p.m. Monday. The university expects more protests at various locations during commencement ceremonies but they \u201cwill not tolerate violence,\u201d Braziel said, adding university policies \u201csupport advocacy that does not jeopardize safety or disrupt university operations.\u201d \u201cProtecting UCLA faculty, staff, students and visitors and creating an environment conducive to teaching, learning, working and living continues to be our priority. The campus community belongs to all of us and we must model the respect we expect to receive from others,\u201d Braziel said. Tensions have simmered on the UCLA campus over how the university has responded to protesters and counterprotesters in recent months. Faculty members have been divided over whether Chancellor Gene Block \u201cfailed to ensure the safety of our students and grievously mishandled the events.\u201d This story has been updated with additional information CNN\u2019s Amanda Musa contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/11/us/ucla-campus-palestine-protests-arrests/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/14/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_12_us_atlanta-bus-hijacking-how-it-unfolded", "text": "Atlanta police had barely finished briefing the community about a shooting inside a downtown food court Tuesday afternoon when calls began to come in about a bus hijacking. A gunman had hijacked a commuter bus with 17 people inside and shot one of them with the passenger\u2019s own gun, authorities said, prompting others to frantically text loved ones and call 911 for help. But as police arrived on the scene and tried to confront the gunman, identified as 39-year-old felon Joseph Grier, the suspect held the bus driver at gunpoint and forced him to speed away, according to Atlanta Police Chief Darin Schierbaum. The ensuing rush-hour police chase zig-zagged across highway lanes and suburban streets as the bus led authorities across at least two counties, at times careening into other cars and crossing into opposing traffic. Inside, a passenger surreptitiously stayed on the line with 911, allowing authorities to hear the commotion, Schierbaum said. Mayor Andre Dickens said the chaos sounded like a movie scene as the suspect had \u201ca gun to the head of a bus driver saying, \u2018Don\u2019t stop this bus or else worse will happen.\u2019\u201d When the bus finally ground to a halt on a tree-lined street in the suburb of Stone Mountain, passengers streamed out and Grier was arrested without incident, police said. A passenger found shot aboard the bus was taken to a hospital, where they later died, officials said. He was identified Wednesday as 58-year-old Ernest Byrd Jr., according to the Fulton County Medical Examiner\u2019s Office, which ruled his death a homicide. The suspect \u2013 who, in a twist, was at the scene of Tuesday afternoon\u2019s shooting downtown and spoke to local news outlets moments before the hijacking \u2013 now faces a slew of charges in connection to Tuesday\u2019s incident, according to jail records. They include one count of murder, 14 counts of kidnapping, 13 counts of aggravated assault, one count of first-degree hijacking of a motor vehicle, one count of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon and one count of possession of a firearm or knife during the commission of or attempt to commit certain felonies. Grier waved his initial court appearance, according to a spokesperson for the Fulton County Sheriff\u2019s Office. He has 19 prior felony convictions, police said, though no further details were provided. CNN has been unable to determine whether the suspect has an attorney. How the harrowing incident unfolded The hijacked Gwinnett County Transit bus is part of a web of commuter routes that bring people to and from Atlanta\u2019s sprawling suburbs, including passenger Paulette Gilbert, who called her husband from inside the bus as the chase began to unfold. Paulette Gilbert seemed stunned and frightened as she described a man who had boarded the bus and began acting strangely, said her husband, Johnny Gilbert. She said the man got into a confrontation with another passenger and shot them, possibly in the leg. \u201cShe said the guy got on the bus and seemed kinda crazy,\u201d Gilbert said, recounting his wife\u2019s story. \u201cHe was being disruptive or getting on people\u2019s nerves,\u201d he added. The husband urged his wife to get off the phone in case the shooter thought she was calling 911, fearful he may shoot her next. \u201cI said put the phone down, put it away. Just sit still.\u201d Grier was \u201cengaging with passengers\u201d when he got into a fight with one of them, a male, who pulled a gun, according to the Georgia Bureau of Investigation. \u201cGrier took the gun from the passenger and began threatening passengers with it,\u201d the GBI said in a news release, citing preliminary information from its investigation. \u201cGrier then shot the passenger and ordered the bus driver to flee the scene while threatening passengers with the gun.\u201d At around 4:30 p.m., police received the first 911 call from a passenger reporting that a gunman was holding the bus hostage on Ivan Allen Boulevard and that there may have been shots fired, Schierbaum said. Then the line went silent. Soon after, another call came in from the family of a passenger who had texted them that the bus had been hijacked. An officer arrived at the scene within about a minute of the first 911 call and tried to confront the suspect, who then \u201cforced the bus driver to drive off,\u201d Schierbaum said. A third 911 call \u2013 this time from another passenger \u2013 stayed on the line throughout the entire chase, allowing dispatchers to feed information to several law enforcement agencies involved in the pursuit, the chief said. The bus led a fleet of law enforcement vehicles along Atlanta\u2019s Interstate 85 as rush hour commuters sped by. It crossed through several suburban areas before coming to a halt in the city of Stone Mountain. The large bus struck several vehicles during the pursuit, police said, though it is unclear whether any drivers were hurt. Officers were able to disable the vehicle using several tactics, including positioning an armored vehicle at one of its sides, preventing it from maneuvering in that direction, police said. The GBI said law enforcement flattened tires on the bus during the chase, but it continued to move. Ultimately, a Georgia state trooper fired his rifle into the engine compartment of the bus, the GBI said, causing the bus to halt on Hugh Howell Road in Stone Mountain. As the bus came to a halt, passengers began to unload themselves and Grier was arrested without incident, police said. A joint investigation into the hijacking will be conducted by the Atlanta Police Department and the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, which will also investigate the police use of force. Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis said Wednesday an employee of her office was on the hijacked bus, a witness to the incident, so she can\u2019t prosecute the suspect. Willis has asked Georgia\u2019s prosecuting attorneys council to assign a different jurisdiction to prosecute the suspect, writing in the letter her office is \u201cconflicted because it has been determined that a victim/witness in this case is a current employee of the Office of the District Attorney for the Atlanta Judicial Circuit.\u201d A violent day for Atlantans The hijacking was one of two violent incidents in downtown Atlanta Tuesday, just four blocks apart.\u00a0Though police say the incidents do not appear to be connected, their alarming proximity \u2013 and the suspects\u2019 extensive criminal records \u2013 have drawn condemnation and concern from local officials. About two hours before the hijacking, a man shot and wounded three people in a busy Atlanta food court. Police said the 34-year-old suspect in that shooting, who was quickly arrested, is a convicted felon who has been arrested 11 times. Interviews with local news stations showed Grier at the scene, claiming in disjointed statements that he witnessed the shooting at Peachtree Center. \u201cI got knives. I got all this sh*t on me. I protect myself. I can\u2019t get a gun,\u201d Grier said in an interview with CNN affiliate WXIA, adding he had previous felony convictions and was on probation. A CNN crew at the scene of the aftermath of the shooting saw Grier being belligerent and interfering with police officers during their investigation. Police are looking into Grier\u2019s presence at the earlier shooting. \u201cToday has been a very active day, but let me be clear, we\u2019re talking about gun violence that is as a result of too many people having guns in their hands,\u201d Mayor Dickens said in a Tuesday evening news conference. \u201cYou\u2019re talking about people that should not have been on the streets with guns.\u201d Dickens said the spate of gun violence shows \u201csomething more needs to be done\u201d but noted violent crime in the city has been decreasing. \u201cSo, this day is not indicative of all the days in the city of Atlanta, but this is a day we\u2019ll never forget,\u201d the mayor said.

{"id": "2024_06_13_economy_biden-nominates-new-fdic-head", "text": "President Joe Biden has nominated Christy Goldsmith Romero as chair of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The announcement comes after current FDIC Chair Martin Gruenberg said he intended to resign once a successor is confirmed by the Senate following a scathing independent investigation detailing pervasive sexual harassment, discrimination and bullying at the agency charged with regulating the banking sector. Goldsmith Romero, a Democrat, served as special inspector general for the Troubled Asset Relief Program at the Treasury Department that was borne out of the Great Recession. In that role, she was responsible for overseeing efforts to crack down on banks\u2019 misuse of funds they received from the program. In a statement released Thursday, the White House said Goldsmith Romero \u201chas more than 20 years of experience as a career federal attorney and leader in financial regulation, serving under four Presidents\u201d and touted her experience promoting \u201cfinancial stability and market resiliency, integrity, and vibrancy.\u201d An agency under scrutiny She also has the advantage of having been unanimously confirmed by the Senate twice for previous positions, which may improve her odds of getting confirmed a third time. That contributed to why Biden chose to nominate her, a person familiar with the matter told C\ufeffNN. Republican and Democratic senators were briefed on Biden\u2019s intent to nominate her prior to Thursday\u2019s announcement, they added. As incoming head of the FDIC, she will largely be viewed as the figure responsible for fixing the longstanding problematic culture at the agency. Goldsmith Romero was picked instead of promoting someone internally at the FDIC because there was a general sense that it would take someone perceived as having a clean slate to usher in lasting change, the person said. An independent investigation commissioned by the FDIC released in early May confirmed the Wall Street Journal\u2019s reporting from last year. Among the findings were many women receiving sexually explicit messages as well as unwanted advances from male coworkers who were often in more senior roles. Minorities and women reported being passed over for promotions. A Hispanic employee said they were \u201casked by a colleague to recite the Pledge of Allegiance to prove that they were American.\u201d Many FDIC employees who partook in the investigation expressed a fear of retaliation for speaking out against alleged misconduct in addition to a lack of disciplinary actions taken against wrongdoers. Gruenberg\u2019s exit Under pressure from the top-ranking Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, Sherrod Brown of Ohio, Gruenberg announced he would vacate the position once a new chair is confirmed. The move drew sharp rebuke from Republicans, who viewed it as politically motivated because if Gruenberg resigned immediately then Vice Chair Travis Hill, a Republican appointee, would have automatically become chair. That would have left the agency deadlocked with one other Republican and two Democrat members on the FDIC\u2019s board of directors, which would likely prevent controversial banking regulations, such as ramped-up capital requirements, from taking effect.

{"id": "2024_06_12_us_atlanta-food-court-shooting-suspect", "text": "Authorities have identified the suspected gunman in Tuesday\u2019s shooting at a downtown Atlanta food court as Jeremy Malone, according to a\u00a0news release\u00a0from the Georgia Bureau of Investigation. Malone, 34, is accused of wounding three people during a shooting at the Peachtree Center, a popular downtown Atlanta food court. The Morrow, Georgia, resident is a convicted felon who has served prison time for an armed robbery and has \u201c11 previous arrest cycles,\u201d Atlanta Police Chief Darin Schierbaum said. \u201cThis is an individual that should never have been possessing a gun and an individual that should never have placed this community in harm,\u201d Schierbaum said. Malone was shot by an Atlanta Police officer at the food court before he was taken into custody. He was transferred to a local hospital but has since been discharged. He is currently in the Fulton County Jail facing several charges including aggravated assault, reckless conduct, possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, and possession of a firearm or knife during the commission of or attempt to commit certain felonies. The victims, all three of whom are being treated at area hospitals, include a 47-year-old man, a 69-year-old woman and a 70-year-old woman. They are all expected to survive, authorities said. Shortly before 2:15 p.m. Tuesday, Malone entered the food court armed with a handgun and had a \u201cbrief altercation\u201d with a person before shooting that individual, the police chief said in a news conference, later clarifying the shooter \u201cphysically attacked\u201d the person before shooting them. The suspect then went on to shoot two other people who were in the food court, Schierbaum said. It\u2019s unclear how Malone may have been connected to the individual he first attacked. Peachtree Center, at the heart of the city\u2019s downtown, boasts more than 1.5 million square feet of office space across four buildings, as well as 50 restaurants and retail shops and three hotels, according to\u00a0its website. The building was placed on lockdown after the shooting but had reopened by late Tuesday afternoon, Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens said. He had earlier warned residents to \u201cavoid the area.\u201d Just over two hours after the shooting unfolded,\u00a0another man in Atlanta\u00a0held the driver of a commuter bus at gunpoint, leading police on a rush-hour chase while more than a dozen passengers remained in the vehicle, police said. The suspect in that case was taken into custody, and one person who was found shot on the bus has died, police said. Authorities said they don\u2019t believe the two incidents are connected. Malone waived his initial court appearance, Natalie Ammons, Fulton County Sheriff spokesperson, told CNN. It\u2019s unclear if he has legal representation at this time.

The two measures \u2013 Musk\u2019s pay package from 2018 and moving the car company\u2019s incorporation state \u2013 were completed at the company\u2019s annual meeting Thursday afternoon. But the outcome of the the votes had already been revealed by Musk in a tweet overnight, when he said both measures had the support they need to pass. Tesla did not give the exact vote results, but it said preliminary results showed that Musk\u2019s pay package and the move to Texas had both passed. The compensation package, 303 million options to buy Tesla shares at a drastically reduced price, was worth $51 billion when it was voided by a Delaware judge nearly five months ago. The package was worth $48.3 billion as of Thursday\u2019s market close, due to a steady decline in Tesla share price (TSLA) this year. Tesla did not respond to a request for comment on his post and had no tweet of its own or announcement on its investor sites. It did file with the Securities and Exchange Commission a collection of tweets on the subject, including the tweet from Musk. Tesla\u2019s board had said that if the shareholders didn\u2019t approve the pay package, the company won\u2019t get the attention it needs from Musk as it faces several challenges: Tesla\u2019s stock price has slid by more than half from its peak as a trillion-dollar company in late 2021, its sales have fallen short of forecasts and its profits are squeezed by a global price war for EVs that Musk started himself. The shareholders approved the original compensation package back in 2018, with 73% voting in favor. But Delaware Chancery Court Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick in January ruled in favor of shareholders who challenged the package. She wrote the process that Tesla board used to award the package was \u201cdeeply flawed\u201d and that Musk and the board had failed to meet \u201cthe burden of proving that the compensation plan was fair.\u201d She criticized the board for being too close to the controversial CEO to represent the interests of shareholders, writing that the board committee that came up with the package included Antonio Gracias, a personal friend of Musk\u2019s who often took family vacations with the Tesla CEO, as well as Todd Maron, \u201cMusk\u2019s former divorce attorney and whose admiration for Musk moved him to tears during his deposition.\u201d In her decision throwing out the original package, McCormick rejected the argument that Musk would be uncompensated if the package was thrown out, writing, \u201cMusk\u2019s preexisting equity stake provided him tens of billions of dollars for his efforts.\u201d Trying to keep Musk\u2019s attention on Tesla Tesla\u2019s filings argue it must keep the pay package in place to keep Musk fully engaged running Tesla and not focusing on his other companies. He is also the head of SpaceX, Neuralink and the Boring Company. And in addition to being the primary shareholder of those companies, he\u2019s the owner of X, formerly known as Twitter. \u201cThis is obviously not about the money,\u201d Tesla Chair Robyn Denholm wrote in a letter to shareholders. \u201cWe all know Elon is one of the wealthiest people on the planet, and he would remain so even if Tesla were to renege on the commitment we made in 2018. Elon is not a typical executive, and Tesla is not a typical company.\u201d Rather it\u2019s about \u201cwhat will motivate him to continue to create value for stockholders,\u201d she wrote. \u201cWhat we recognized in 2018 and continue to recognize today is that one thing Elon most certainly does not have is unlimited time,\u201d Denholm wrote. \u201cNor does he face any shortage of ideas and other places he can make an incredible difference in the world. We want those ideas, that energy and that time to be at Tesla, for the benefit of you, our owners. But that requires reciprocal respect.\u201d Some of the supporters of the pay package include Cathie Wood, CEO and chief investment officer of Ark Invest and a long-time Tesla bull, and Ron Baron, CEO of Baron Capital, which has Tesla as one of its top holdings with a stake worth more than $2 billion. \u201cElon is the ultimate \u2018key man,\u2019\u201d said Baron in a recent statement. \u201cWithout his relentless drive and uncompromising standards, there would be no Tesla.\u201d But there are some major shareholders who have said they voted against the deal, including the California State Teachers Retirement Fund as well as the Norwegian sovereign wealth fund, which has 28 million shares of Tesla stock, according to its most recent filing. \u201cWhile we appreciate the significant value generated under Mr. Musk\u2019s leadership since the grant date in 2018, we remain concerned about the total size of the award,\u201d said a statement from the Norwegian fund. Part of the problem with winning support is that Musk is far more controversial now than he was in 2018 and appears to be far less focused on simply running Tesla. He famously bought social media platform Twitter for $44 billion in 2022, selling $22.9 billion of his Tesla shares to help fund that purchase. He has been accused in multiple shareholder suits of improperly selling $7.5 billon of those shares late that year, knowing that Tesla was due to soon report disappointing sales that would reduce the company\u2019s share price. Under his management of Twitter, now known as X, he\u2019s restored accounts for users who had been banned for hate speech, advocacy of violence or misinformation. Meanwhile, allegations about widespread antisemitism on the platform and Musk\u2019s own endorsement of an antisemitic tweet have driven away many advertisers. His management of X isn\u2019t the only way he\u2019s become more controversial. This week former employees of SpaceX, of which he is also CEO and primary shareholder, filed a lawsuit allegeding they were illegally fired for raising concerns about gender discrimination and sexual harassment at the rocket company. But perhaps a more serious concern among Tesla shareholders is the pioneering electric car company itself. While shares shot up more than 1,700% between when the original package was approved in 2018 and their high point in November 2021, making Musk the richest person in the world at that time, it has lost more than half of that value since, including a 30% drop this year. Tesla has been forced to cut prices in the face of weaker demand and increased competition from other automakers offering their own EVs. One of Musk\u2019s fans on X, who tweets under the handle \u201cWholeMarsCatalog,\u201d retweeted Musk\u2019s tweet announcing the shareholder support and commented: Okay @elonmusk we got you the options. Now you have to make Tesla the most valuable company on Earth. Deal?\u201d To which Musk responded with his own tweet, \u201cYes.\u201d The ear\ufeffly market reaction to the vote was positive. Shares of Tesla rose 3% in Thursday trading. Even with Musk\u2019s pay package again endorsed by shareholders, the Delaware court could still have the final say. Tesla attorneys have told the Delaware court that the move of its incorporation to Texas is not an effort to evade Delaware jurisdiction.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/13/business/elon-musk-tesla-pay-billions-vote/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/14/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_12_us_sandy-hook-survivors-graduate-high-school", "text": "High school seniors Emma Ehrens and Grace Fischer will hear their names read out today as they are called to collect their diplomas and start the next chapter of their lives. But they are also steeling themselves to hear 20 other names of former classmates who never got to leave first grade, let alone plan for college and grow into adulthood. Today is the day that the 20 children massacred at Sandy Hook Elementary School in December 2012 would have graduated, perhaps cheered on by the six teachers and administrators also killed in the deadliest K-12 shooting in US history. \u201cIt\u2019s just going to be heartbreaking,\u201d Grace told CNN. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine that 20 kids are not graduating with us and that they\u2019re not having the opportunity to walk across the stage.\u201d Emma said she\u2019s trying to prepare herself for a range of emotions \u2013 the joy at leaving school, nerves about what\u2019s next and reflecting on what should have been. \u201cThinking about all the what ifs: what if they were sitting next to me at graduation, what if we were still friends, where would we be? It\u2019s just going to be a lot of what ifs in my head,\u201d she said. With gun violence the leading cause of death for children in the United States, and with shootings inside schools continuing to claim the lives of students and teachers while devastating communities in places like Uvalde, Texas; Parkland, Florida; Nashville, Tennessee; and Santa Fe, Texas \u2013 all since Newtown \u2013 many other students may be faced with their own \u201cwhat ifs.\u201d Newtown High School\u2019s Class of 2024 will be wearing green and white ribbons on their graduation gowns, each inscribed with \u201cForever In Our Hearts\u201d to remember the children and adults who were killed while the new graduates survived, because they happened to be in a different classroom or got an extra few seconds to escape. Emma was six years old and looking forward to making gingerbread houses when the 20-year-old gunman armed with a semi-automatic assault-style rifle and two handguns shot his way into the school. Emma, like many other students, thought the popping noises were from roof construction work at the school, until she came face to face with the horror. \u201cA guy \u2013 armed \u2013 came into my classroom and started shooting all of my friends and my teachers and my classmates,\u201d she said. \u201cHis gun jammed and a friend of mine, Jesse Lewis, yelled at us to run and that\u2019s what we did.\u201d Jesse Lewis, just six years old, shown in family photos with rosy cheeks and a smile full of baby teeth, was killed. But his quick thinking and desire to help his friends propelled Emma and a few other children to bump past the gunman and get out. \u201cI remember vividly running out of the room and then, in the hallway right by the main entrance, there were chairs \u2026 and under the chairs were people, because of the force of impact of the bullets, they were blown under the chairs.\u201d She led her classmates out of the school and eventually was found by a family friend and taken to safety. Grace hid with her friends in the cubbies in another classroom, feeling scared, she said, but not really sure about what, until police officers escorted them out to safety at the fire station next door. \u201cWhen we got to the firehouse, we had to line up by grade and that\u2019s when my teacher was like, this is really not OK,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause when we lined up by grade, half our grade was missing.\u201d That night, Grace learned that Jessica Rekos, a horse-loving fellow Girl Scout in her small troop, had died, though she said she could not comprehend what death meant then. \u201cThat day really took a lot of my childhood away from me,\u201d she said. Both Grace and Emma clearly still carry the grief from the massacre but also seem propelled by their experiences to make their country safer. Grace will attend Hamilton College in upstate New York, with plans to focus on law and justice. Rationally, she says it\u2019s a choice she is making but she also acknowledges she feels an obligation. \u201cI really want to make sure that they know I\u2019m doing something,\u201d she said of her classmates who had no chance to graduate. \u201cEven though they\u2019re not here anymore, there are people who survived that are really trying to push for them. Because their lives were lost so early and I went through that at such an early age, I feel like it\u2019s my purpose to continue my life in honor of them.\u201d Grace and Emma are part of the Junior Newtown Action Alliance (Junior NAA) to share their stories and campaign for gun violence prevention. They\u2019ve met with Vice President Kamala Harris and other national leaders, as well as survivors and victims\u2019 families from other school shootings, perhaps driving Emma\u2019s desire to become a \u201clawyer, senator, politician\u201d after she graduates from her legal studies program at Roger Williams University in Rhode Island. \u201cI have thought about \u2026 if I\u2019m not doing something big, did I survive for the right reasons?\u201d she said, talking about the survivor\u2019s guilt she feels she has had her whole life. \u201cWhen I was little, I don\u2019t remember feeling it that much, but now that I\u2019m graduating and going to college and doing all this stuff with Junior NAA, I\u2019ve been feeling it a lot,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m graduating, I\u2019m going to college, I get to go home, I get to see my dog, I get to do all this when they don\u2019t.

{"id": "2024_06_12_us_nova-music-festival-exhibition-protest-in-new-york-called-heartbreaking", "text": "The Hate Crimes Task Force of the New York Police Department is investigating several reports of antisemitic vandalism at the homes of Jewish board members of the Brooklyn Museum \u2013 including its director, a New York City law enforcement official told CNN Wednesday. Five homes \u2013 three in Manhattan and two in Brooklyn \u2013 were vandalized Tuesday night, police said. \u201cWe are deeply troubled by these horrible acts,\u201d Taylor Maatman, Brooklyn Museum\u2019s spokesperson, told CNN. Tuesday night\u2019s vandalism comes as the US saw the highest number of antisemitic incidents reported since The Anti-Defamation League began tracking\u00a0data in 1979, according to the organization\u2019s annual audit of antisemitism released in April. NYC Comptroller Brad Lander\u00a0posted photos on X of the vandalism Wednesday saying, \u201cThe cowards who did this are way over the line into antisemitism, harming the cause they claim to care about, and making everyone less safe.\u201d The images shared by Lander show the entryway of a home with its front doors and windows splattered in red paint and a sign hanging in the entrance filled with red handprints that reads, \u201cAnne Pasternak Brooklyn Museum White Supremacist Zionist.\u201d Pasternak is the Brooklyn Museum\u2019s director. Additionally, red inverted triangles were painted on the windows and doors of the home, a symbol used by the military wing of Hamas in the recent conflict in Gaza to indicate Israeli military targets, according to the\u00a0Anti-Defamation League. The symbol, sometimes used in the form of an emoji, is used in some cases to \u201csignify support for violent Palestinian resistance against Israel.\u201d New York Gov. Kathy Hochul called the graffiti \u201can abhorrent act of antisemitism,\u201d writing on X that New York stands \u201cwith the Jewish community in the face of hate and will continue to fight antisemitism wherever it rears its ugly head.\u201d New York Mayor Eric Adams echoed the sentiment saying the vandalism \u201cis not peaceful protest or free speech,\u201d he wrote on X. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to Anne Pasternak and members of @brooklynmuseum\u2019s board who woke up to hatred like this,\u201d he said. \u201cI spoke to Anne this morning and committed that this hate will not stand in our city.\u201d The NYPD Task Force is actively investigating the incidents, poring through surveillance footage, and speaking with witnesses to gather more information. Protests outside exhibition for those killed at Israeli music festival The vandalism comes just one day after political leaders, locally and nationally, condemned a Monday protest outside an exhibition in Manhattan commemorating the lives of those killed at an Israeli music festival last year. \u201cIt was pretty surreal that this protest took place outside of exhibition commemorating hundreds of lives of people that were lost,\u201d the spokesperson, Michelle Rojas, told CNN Monday. The exhibition commemorates those killed at the Nova Music Festival in Israel during the October 7 attacks by Hamas. At least 260 people\u00a0died\u00a0during the festival attack, according to Israeli rescue service Zaka. Some attendees were taken hostage, and seen in social media videos being seized by their armed captors. The outdoor festival was supposed to be an all-night dance party, celebrating the Jewish holiday of Sukkot. The New York City protest was part of a \u201cCitywide Day of Rage for Gaza,\u201d in which pro-Palestinian protesters demonstrated outside museums across the city on Monday. The protests were organized by the activist group Within Our Lifetime \u201cin response to the ongoing genocide being carried out against the Palestinian people,\u201d and called on demonstrators to \u201ctake autonomous action all day,\u201d then gather at Union Square at 5 p.m. \u201cAcross the city, the Brooklyn Museum and cultural institutions like it are drenched in the blood of Palestine\u2019s martyrs. In their name and in their memory we call for autonomous action against these institutions all day,\u201d the group said on X. Israel launched ongoing attacks in Gaza after the Hamas attacks in October killed 1,200 people. More than 37,000 Palestinians have been\u00a0killed\u00a0in Gaza since Israel\u2019s war against Hamas started in October, according to figures from the enclave\u2019s health ministry. Multiple protesters in New York City were taken into custody,\u00a0and 23 were released with criminal court summons, according to the New York City Police Department. It\u2019s unclear exactly how many protesters were arrested. The protest was despicable and inhumane, Hochul told CNN\u2019s Laura Coates on Wednesday. \u201cThis is not who New Yorkers are, and we should not descend into this chaos and allow any tolerance for this disgusting, abhorrent behavior,\u201d Hochul said. Adams\u00a0called the demonstration \u201cpure\u00a0anti-Semitism.\u201d \u201cAny New Yorker who stands for peace cannot stand next to those waving Hamas and Hezbollah flags, especially at an exhibit commemorating the victims of the\u00a0Nova\u00a0Music Festival massacre,\u201d he said in a post on X. \u201cThe NYPD has overseen thousands of peaceful protests, but it is our duty to arrest anyone who breaks the law,\u201d Adams added. \u201cNew Yorkers will always be safe here.\u201d The White House condemned the demonstration outside the New York exhibit along with New York Rep. Ritchie Torres, a Democrat, who\u00a0called the protesters\u00a0\u201canti-Israel bigots\u201d on X, and\u00a0Manhattan Borough President Mark Levine who called the demonstration\u00a0\u201crepulsive and vile.\u201d \u201cThe events at yesterday\u2019s memorial to those murdered at the Nova music festival are outrageous and heartbreaking,\u201d White House spokesman Andrew Bates said in a statement. Bates added, \u201cProfane banners of terrorist organizations should not be flown anywhere, especially not on American streets. Antisemitism has no place in the United States.\u00a0This horrifying behavior is all the more reason for \u2018Americans to stand united against antisemitism and hate in all its forms,\u2019 like President Biden urgently called for at the Holocaust Memorial Museum last month.\u201d \u201cOn the citywide Day of Rage for Gaza today we flooded the streets, took over the subway and shut down the Nova Exhibition,\u201d Within Our Lifetime posted on X. The exhibit has been extended until June 22 as a result of the demonstrations to make sure more people come down to support it, Rojas said. \u201cIt\u2019s incredibly important for people to see that this impacted so many facets, not only in Israel but truly around the world, different countries, different communities around the world were impacted by what happened at a music festival,\u201d Rojas said.

{"id": "2024_06_12_us_southern-baptists-ivf", "text": "Indianapolis (AP) \u2014\u00a0Southern Baptist\u00a0delegates expressed alarm Wednesday over the way in vitro fertilization is routinely being practiced, approving a resolution lamenting that the creation of surplus frozen embryos often results in \u201cdestruction of embryonic human life.\u201d They\u00a0urged members\u00a0to carefully weigh the ethical implications of the technology while also expressing sympathy with couples \u201cwho experience the searing pain of infertility.\u201d The resolution \u2014 approved near the end of the Southern Baptist Convention\u2019s two-day annual meeting \u2014 affirms that embryos are human beings from the moment of fertilization, whether in the womb or generated in the laboratory via IVF. That\u2019s the same position held by the Alabama Supreme Court in ruling that frozen embryos have the full rights of people. In the wake of that decision, Alabama passed a law shielding IVF providers from prosecution and lawsuits \u2014 reflecting that even in a state with strong anti-abortion sentiment, there is support for a technology used by many couples facing infertility. The resolution also urged couples to adopt surplus frozen embryos that would otherwise be destroyed. Did the resolution condemn IVF or call for its banning? Not in a blanket way. What it did was denounce the routine practice of creating multiple embryos, frozen for potential use but often with surplus embryos destroyed. It also denounced the use of embryos for experiments, as well as \u201cdehumanizing methods for determining suitability for life and genetic sorting, based on notions of genetic fitness and parental preferences.\u201d Kristen Ferguson, chair of the committee on resolutions, said after the vote that the resolution amounts to the SBC\u2019s first foray into a new ethnical frontier but rooted in their longstanding belief in \u201cthe sanctity of the human embryo.\u201d IVF \u201cis not respecting the sanctity of the human embryo \u2026 in the way it is routinely practiced,\u201d she said. \u201cRight now we\u2019re trying to open the conversation, remind Southern Baptists of our long-held beliefs of the sanctity of human life and allow them to begin to think through the ethical implications.\u201d She anticipated there may be resolutions with \u201cmuch stronger language\u201d and more specific applications in the future, such as how these issues relate to the medical community, she said. \u201cBut we are not speaking to that at this time, because Southern Baptists aren\u2019t ready to speak to that yet,\u201d she said. \u201cThey wanted to say an affirmation of the human embryo and that it has implications for IVF. \u201d Why is this an important issue for Southern Baptists? Ever since the nation\u2019s largest Protestant body took a conservative turn in the 1980s, it has made opposing abortion a top priority. With the overturning of the Roe v. Wade decision that legalized abortion, new issues have reached the forefront, including IVF. This resolution makes clear that Southern Baptists\u2019 belief that life begins at conception extends to embryos generated via IVF. Do Southern Baptists and other conservative evangelicals have consensus on IVF? No.\u00a0On the convention floor, some delegates gave impassioned testimony to how IVF enabled couples to have long-sought children. Others said that despite that laudable goal, the practice is ethically unacceptable. Some believe it\u2019s ethical to use IVF to create only the number of embryos intended for implantation. Albert Mohler, a prominent SBC seminary president and conservative activist, made a hardline denunciation of IVF at a sideline event before the SBC meeting on Monday, calling IVF a \u201ccommodification of the embryo\u201d that assaults human dignity. He also criticized it for enabling people to have children outside of heterosexual marriage. Did the resolution call for a government ban on IVF? No. It calls for government to \u201crestrain actions inconsistent with the dignity of \u2026 frozen embryonic human beings.\u201d But it doesn\u2019t prescribe specific measures. \u201cI think especially after the Alabama Supreme Court decision, there\u2019s been a rush at state level as well as federal level to protect IVF or to even expand IVF access, often with very little thought to some of the other realities at stake,\u201d said Jason Thacker, a Southern Baptist ethicist who advised the resolutions committee. \u201cWe\u2019re not naive enough to say that we can just ban this technology, full stop,\u201d he said. \u201cWhile that would be the goal, because that\u2019s consistent with dignity of the human embryo in many ways,\u201d he said he recognized that there are others who believe there are ethical ways to apply IVF technology. What\u2019s essential, he said, is laws that respect embryos\u2019 human dignity.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/12/us/southern-baptists-ivf/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/14/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "business_apple-lawsuit-gender-pay-discrimination", "text": "Two female employees at Apple sued the company on Thursday, alleging the company paid women less than men for the same work. The women are proposing a class action, seeking to represent more than 12,000 current and former female employees in the engineering, marketing and AppleCare divisions. Apple is not the first major tech company to face legal challenges for alleged gender discrimination. Google in 2018 agreed to pay $118 million to settle a class action gender discrimination lawsuit, and Oracle agreed to pay $25 million to settle a class action alleging underpaying female employees. Neither company admitted wrongdoing. The lawsuit centers on Apple\u2019s hiring practices and performance evaluations, which the women allege pushed a wage gap between men and women. California made it illegal for employers to ask job candidates about their prior pay in 2018. Instead, since January 2018, Apple asked about pay expectations, the lawsuit says. The lawsuit alleges that Apple used the pay expectation information to set starting salaries, which had lower pay rates for women compared to men who did similar work. The lawsuit also claims that the performance evaluations are biased against women, because parameters such as teamwork and leadership tend to reward men and punish women. This can affect women\u2019s promotions and bonuses, the lawsuit alleged. Justina Jong, a customer and technical training instructor and one of two plaintiffs, said in a release from her attorneys that she noticed a W-2 left on the office printer by a male colleague. \u201cI noticed that he was being paid almost $10,000 more than me, even though we performed substantially similar work. This revelation made me feel terrible,\u201d Jong said in a statement. The lawsuit also alleges that Jong was forced to work in a hostile work environment next to a co-worker who had sexually harassed her. The other plaintiff, Amina Salgado, said she complained to Apple numerous times about the wage gap, according to the lawsuit. Salgado has worked in several roles for Apple since 2012, according to the suit. Eventually, she said, Apple hired a third-party firm to conduct an investigation, which found that she was paid less. \u201cAs a result of the third-party investigation, in late 2023, Apple increased Ms. Salgado\u2019s compensation prospectively, but failed and refused to pay Ms. Salgado back pay for the years during which she was paid less than men performing substantially similar work,\u201d the lawsuit alleged. The lawsuit claims the class members are entitled to compensation from the loss of fair wages, as well as declaratory and injunctive relief.

Alexander Morris says he was\u00a0put in\u00a0a restraining jacket and\u00a0initially denied treatment for a medical emergency after he arrived at the hospital in an ambulance. He is also suing a nurse and a security guard who\u00a0worked for the hospital. According to the lawsuit, the hospital and nurse \u201cblatantly refused to provide (Morris)\u00a0with medical treatment due to his race and/or perceived mental disability. Instead, (Morris)\u00a0received a deliberate misdiagnosis and received a lower standard of medical care based on his race that amounted to racial discrimination and delayed his actual diagnosis.\u201d On April 7, 2023, Morris was transported\u00a0to Ascension Macomb Oakland Hospital\u00a0in an\u00a0ambulance\u00a0and \u201cpresented to the emergency room\u00a0with difficulty breathing and chest pain, he was on oxygen, and he had a significant known history of cardiac disease including the placement of stints and defibrillator,\u201d the lawsuit states. At the hospital,\u00a0Morris \u201cinformed a nurse and a security guard that he was a member of the famous Motown group the \u2018Four Tops\u2019,\u00a0and that he\u00a0had current security\u00a0concerns due to stalkers and fans,\u201d\u00a0according to the lawsuit. The lawsuit claims the nurse, security guard and an emergency room doctor\u00a0\u201cracially profiled him and/or profiled him based upon a perceived disability and placed an order for a psychological evaluation\u201d because they didn\u2019t believe Morris was \u201ca singer or member of the \u2018Four Tops.\u2019\u201d CNN has reached out to Ascension Macomb Oakland Hospital for comment. An ER doctor decided to \u201cremove him from oxygen and pursue a psychiatric evaluation instead, despite his clear symptoms of cardiac distress and significant medical history,\u201d the lawsuit alleges. The lawsuit states \u201ca security guard was instructed to ensure he was placed into a restraining jacket and/or a four-point restraint mechanism.\u201d Morris told CNN he told the hospital staff,\u00a0\u201cI have never been so demeaned, so dehumanized and so disrespected in all my life.\u201d According to the lawsuit, Morris attempted to prove his identity, offering to show his identification, but was told by the security guard, who is White,\u00a0to \u201csit his Black a** down.\u201d The lawsuit states Morris\u00a0\u201casked to have the restraint device removed and asked for his personal belongings back so he could leave and seek treatment at another hospital,\u201d\u00a0but was told\u00a0he was not free to leave. Morris\u2019 attorney Maurice Davis told CNN his client\u00a0was going through\u00a0\u201ca clear medical emergency where he\u2019s having chest pain, he has a history of heart problems, a history of strokes. \u00a0A situation like that calls for\u00a0swift medical intervention,\u201d\u00a0Davis said. According to the lawsuit, Morris was denied medical care until a nurse allowed him to show her a video of a Four Tops performance\u00a0at the Grammys. The lawsuit states, \u201cThe restraint jacket was finally removed, and he was placed back on oxygen.\u00a0(Morris) was restrained for approximately an hour and a half.\u201d Morris\u00a0said\u00a0his identity was proven almost four hours after he arrived at the hospital. \u201cI said, all it took was two minutes to verify that\u00a0I am who I am,\u201d\u00a0Morris told CNN. \u201cInstead of you verifying who I am, you tell me I\u2019m crazy and want to send me to the psych evaluation department.\u201d The lawsuit states\u00a0Morris was offered a $25 gift card to a supermarket\u00a0as an apology by the hospital, but he refused\u00a0the offer. \u201cMy anxiety, everything, was through the roof.\u00a0\u00a0I would not eat, I was afraid to eat anything brought to me that was not sealed,\u201d\u00a0he told CNN. Morris\u00a0said he believed he was\u00a0\u201cclose to death\u201d\u00a0because of his health history. \u201cBecause I had several heart attacks and things like that \u2026 my heart was already compromised,\u201d\u00a0Morris told CNN. Morris\u00a0said\u00a0he\u00a0had three seizures and stayed in Ascension Macomb Oakland Hospital for about five days because he was too sick to be moved to another hospital. It\u2019s unclear if the alleged actions by the hospital contributed to Morris\u2019 subsequent medical issues. \u201cIf a person is coming in for help, I don\u2019t care what their nationality, their ethnicity, their religious beliefs or their sexual orientation \u2014 if they come to your emergency room for help, help them first,\u201d Morris said. Davis told CNN the hospital should compensate Morris for what his client endured.\u00a0 According to the lawsuit, Morris is seeking compensation for damages from the defendants to be determined by a jury in\u00a0excess of $75,000.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/13/us/alexander-morris-four-tops-hospital-lawsuit-reaj/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/14/2024", "section": "us"}}

Timothy Muller, 43, is charged with making interstate threats and influencing, impeding or retaliating against a federal official.\u00a0If convicted, he faces up to 10 years in prison. While court documents do not name the FBI agent who was the target of\u00a0the\u00a0threats, a person familiar with the matter told CNN the agent is a member of special counsel David Weiss\u2019 team investigating the president\u2019s son. An attorney for Muller did not immediately respond to a request for comment. He has not yet entered a formal plea in court. The charges come as the Justice Department and federal agents report increased violent threats \u2013 many of which are related to high-profile investigations and prosecutions like that of Hunter Biden. Attorney General Merrick Garland lambasted the rise of \u201cbaseless, personal and dangerous\u201d threats in a \u00a0Washington Post op-ed\u00a0Tuesday, saying that department employees are being \u00a0\u201cthreatened for simply doing their jobs.\u201d Muller\u2019s alleged threats against the FBI\u00a0agent appear to fall into that category. According to court documents, Muller called the FBI\u00a0agent hours after a Delaware federal jury found President Joe Biden\u2019s son Hunter guilty of three felony gun charges. In a minute long voicemail, Muller allegedly threatened to kill the agent and their family, saying, \u201cYou can run, but you can\u2019t f**king hide.\u201d The message continued with lies about the 2020 presidential election being stolen, according to court documents, and expletive-laden threats, saying that \u201cthe guns will come out, and we\u2019ll hunt you\u201d down \u201cand slaughter you like the traitorous dogs you are in your own f**king homes.\u201d Mueller then allegedly followed up in several texts to the agent\u2019s phone, writing, \u201cHow\u2019s the family?

{"id": "2024_06_13_politics_senate-ivf-bill-vote", "text": "Senate Republicans\u00a0voted Thursday\u00a0to block\u00a0a bill put forward by Democrats that would guarantee access to in vitro fertilization nationwide. The legislation failed to advance in a procedural vote by a tally of 48-47.\u00a0It needed 60 votes to advance.\u00a0Republicans criticized the Democrat-led legislation as\u00a0unnecessary overreach and a political show vote. \u201cWhy should we vote for a bill that fixes a non-existent problem? There\u2019s not a problem. There\u2019s no restrictions on IVF, nor should there be,\u201d Republican Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, told reporters. The vote is part of a broader push by Senate Democrats to draw a contrast with Republicans over reproductive health care in the run up to the November elections. Democrats are highlighting the issue this month, which marks the two-year anniversary of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer slammed Republicans who voted against the bill, saying that they are being \u201cpushed by the MAGA hard right.\u201d \u201cThese are the very same people who pushed to get rid of Roe in the Dobbs decision,\u201d Schumer told CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett on \u201cOutFront\u201d Thursday evening, referring to the blockbuster 2022 Supreme Court decision that overturned a constitutional right to abortion. \u201cWe know what they\u2019re up to. They want to get rid of IVF, they\u2019re afraid to say it.\u201d Biden attacked Senate Republicans after the vote. \u201cOnce again, Senate Republicans refused to protect access to fertility treatments for women who are desperately trying to get pregnant,\u201d Biden said in a written statement. \u201cAnd just last week, Senate Republicans blocked nationwide protections for birth control. The disregard for a woman\u2019s right to make these decisions for herself and her family is outrageous and unacceptable.\u201d Republicans have criticized the Democrat-led legislation as\u00a0unnecessary overreach and a political show vote. The legislation the Senate will take up \u2013 the Right to IVF Act \u2013 would enshrine into federal law a right for individuals to receive IVF treatment as well as for doctors to provide treatment, which would override any attempt at the state level to restrict access. The bill seeks to make IVF treatment more affordable by mandating coverage for fertility treatments under employer-sponsored insurance and certain public insurance plans. It would also expand coverage of fertility treatments, including IVF, under US military service members and veterans\u2019 health care. The IVF legislative package was introduced by Democratic Sens. Patty Murray of Washington state, Tammy Duckworth of Illinois and Cory Booker of New Jersey. The vote comes after Alabama\u2019s Supreme Court said, in a first-of-its-kind ruling earlier this year, that frozen embryos are children and those who destroy them can be held liable for wrongful death \u2013 a decision that reproductive rights advocates warned could have a chilling effect on\u00a0infertility treatments. While the state\u2019s legislature took action aimed at protecting IVF in the wake of the ruling, Democrats argue that this is only one example of how access to reproductive health care is under threat across the nation. Southern Baptist delegates, for instance, expressed alarm Wednesday over the way in vitro fertilization is routinely being practiced, approving a resolution lamenting that the creation of surplus frozen embryos often results in \u201cdestruction of embryonic human life.\u201d The IVF vote is the latest move by Democrats to bring up a bill expected to be blocked by Republicans. Last week, Senate Republicans voted to block a Democrat-led bill that would guarantee access to contraception. Most Republicans dismissed the effort as a political messaging vote that was unnecessary and overly broad, though GOP Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine crossed over to vote with Democrats in favor of advancing the bill. Republicans have introduced their own bills on IVF and contraception.\u00a0GOP Sens. Katie Britt of Alabama and Ted Cruz of Texas have introduced a bill called the IVF Protection Act\u00a0and Republican Sen. Joni Ernst of Iowa has\u00a0put forward\u00a0a separate bill to promote access to contraception. Cruz and Britt attempted to pass their IVF legislation on the Senate floor Wednesday through a unanimous consent request, but Democrats blocked the effort. Murray, who objected to the request, criticized the GOP bill, arguing that states could \u201cenact burdensome and unnecessary requirements and create the kind of legal uncertainty and risk that would force clinics to once again close their doors.\u201d Under the IVF bill from Britt and Cruz, states would not be eligible for Medicaid funding if they prohibit access to IVF, but the legislation \u201cpermits states to implement health and safety standards regarding the practice of IVF,\u201d according to a press release.

{"id": "2024_06_13_politics_trump-closed-door-meeting-house-gop", "text": "Former President Donald Trump led House Republicans through a gripe-filled closed-door meeting on Capitol Hill\u00a0on Thursday,\u00a0airing grievances about his legal and electoral challenges, attacking his critics in the room, and only briefly addressing policy matters\u00a0like abortion and taxes,\u00a0according to multiple GOP lawmakers in the room. In his first time returning to the Capitol campus area since leaving office\u00a0after the January 6, 2021, riot, the former president met with lawmakers for over an hour. In between rants about Taylor Swift and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Trump went after his detractors \u2013 those who have since lost their seats and some who were in the room \u2013 as he warned\u00a0Republicans\u00a0to not be afraid of the hot button issue of\u00a0abortion. In a sign that the former president is reveling in how the party has fallen in line behind him, Trump bragged that\u00a0most of the 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach him were no longer in office and singled out one of the remaining two GOP lawmakers left: GOP Rep. David Valadao of California. \u201cI never loved him,\u201d Trump said\u00a0of Valadao, according to a GOP member. As a number of House Republicans find themselves in competitive primary races, the former president said he wanted to do tele-town halls, but acknowledged his help would not be welcomed by some, given that he had endorsed their primary opponents. Trump did not shy away from acknowledging the bad blood between House Speaker Mike Johnson and GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, who unsuccessfully tried to oust Johnson against Trump\u2019s wishes. The former president playfully asked Greene, a staunch ally of his who he strongly supports,\u00a0to be nice to the speaker. \u201cHe\u2019s always so sweet, recognizing me, and he said \u2018are you being nice to Speaker Johnson?\u2019 He was joking. And I said \u2018eh,\u2019\u201d as she gestured with her hands. \u201cHe said \u2018OK be nice to him\u2019 and I nodded my head,\u201d she added. Johnson, after the meeting, said the former president told him that he was doing \u201ca very good job\u201d and that he plans to be \u201cfully prepared\u201d to implement Trump\u2019s plans if he wins in November. The former president\u2019s conviction\u00a0also\u00a0hung\u00a0heavy\u00a0over\u00a0Thursday\u2019s\u00a0meeting. Trump\u2019s allies on Capitol Hill immediately sprung into action following the guilty verdict \u2013proposing to defund the Department of Justice and even shut down the government. House Republicans voted to hold Attorney General Merrick Garland in contempt of Congress on Wednesday. And\u00a0one legislative proposal Republican leaders are now actively pursuing is a bill that would allow current and former presidents to move state-level cases to federal court. The legislation passed out of committee last September, but GOP leaders only started formally whipping the bill this week \u2013 on the eve of Trump\u2019s Capitol Hill visit and two weeks\u00a0after his conviction. In his meeting with GOP lawmakers,\u00a0Trump\u00a0called the Department of Justice\u00a0\u201cdirty no good bastards,\u201d\u00a0according to another\u00a0source in the room. GOP Rep. Kevin Hern of Oklahoma said the former president expressed he was \u201cgravely concerned\u201d about the federal government being weaponized. In a news conference after the meeting, House Majority Whip Tom Emmer said that the former president\u2019s felony convictions have only energized the party that will propel them to victory in November. \u201cAnybody who thought that this President was going to be down after the sham trial, after that crooked trial that we saw in New York, I think, again, it\u2019s only given him even more energy,\u201d Emmer said. \u201cAnd what he did for us upstairs just now is, he showed us that energy and he showed us that positive outlook, despite all the garbage they\u2019ve been throwing at him with their lawfare and their nonsense.\u201d Trump tells GOP lawmakers to \u2018follow your own heart\u2019 on abortion Trump had a direct message for House Republicans on how to approach abortion leading into November, an issue Republicans have struggled to unify around in the wake of Roe v. Wade being overturned. Johnson relayed that Trump told the group to \u201cexercise your own conscience to talk about it, share your conviction, and do that in a way that makes sense to people. And I think he had made a good point.\u201d Trump, in a low voice, advised Republicans to not be afraid of the issue, according to sources in room, and claimed that Democrats are the extreme ones on the topic. He called on Republicans to follow their convictions but cautioned how they address the matter on the campaign trail and advocated for exceptions. \u201cHe talked and pushed for exceptions for rape, life of the mother and incest. He talked about the way that we need to talk about it, quote correctly, his words, not mine,\u201d GOP Rep. Nancy Mace told CNN. \u201cAnd I really appreciated his comments as a woman, as a suburban mom.\u201d Trump also talked about how Roe v. Wade finally put the decision to the states as they always wanted, though he noted some of them made \u201cnot so good\u201d decisions. \u201cBut like Ronald Reagan, you have to have three choices: life of mother, rape and incest you have to do, but you have to follow your own heart,\u201d Trump said, according to a source in the room. Trump\u2019s message came as the\u00a0Supreme\u00a0Court\u00a0rejected a lawsuit\u00a0challenging the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s approach to regulating the abortion pill mifepristone with a ruling that will continue to allow the pills to be mailed to patients without an in-person doctor\u2019s visit. The former president also ticked through a handful of other priorities, including his proposal to eliminate taxes on tips, building the southern border, and halting further aid for Ukraine, even though a number of lawmakers in his party support it. Trump off topic There were a number of moments where the former president went off topic. As Trump was ranting about crime rates and so-called election integrity issues, the former president called Milwaukee \u2013 where Republicans are holding their convention this summer \u2013 \u201chorrible,\u201d according to a source in the room. Rep. Derrick Van Orden, a Wisconsin Republican who was in the room, made clear to CNN that Trump was \u201cspecifically referring to crime in Milwaukee\u201d and not the city itself. In one bizarre moment,\u00a0Trump called Pelosi\u2019s daughter a \u201cwacko\u201d and then claimed her daughter once told him that he and the former House speaker would have had a \u201cgreat romance\u201d in another life, according to a lawmaker in the room.. In response to Trump\u2019s comments, one of Pelosi\u2019s daughters\u00a0posted\u00a0on X: \u201cspeaking for all 4 Pelosi daughters \u2014 this is a LIE. His deceitful, deranged obsession with our mother is yet another reason Donald Trump is unwell, unhinged and unfit to step foot anywhere near her \u2014 or the White House.\u201d He also questioned why popstar Taylor Swift would support President Joe Biden over him, whom he referred to as a \u201cdope.\u201d \u201cWhy would she endorse this dope,\u201d Trump said, according to a member in the room. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t know how to get off a stage.\u201d The former president even said at one point of Hannibal Lecter: \u201cNice guy \u2026 he even had a friend over for dinner.\u201d At the start of the meeting, House Republicans sang happy birthday to the former president, whose birthday is Friday, and presented him with the game ball and bat from the congressional baseball game that Republican won on Wednesday, according to a source in the room. Senate meeting striking a more unifying tone A few hours later, Trump met with Senate Republicans behind closed doors and \u2013 lawmakers said \u2013 struck a unifying tone. Senate Minority Leader Mitch\u00a0McConnell, who has had a distant and icy relationship with the former president and has not spoken directly to him since December 2020, said that he shook hands with Trump and that the meeting was positive. \u201cI can\u2019t think of anything to tell you out of it that was negative,\u201d he said. Trump praised McConnell during the meeting, crediting the Kentucky Republican for his work to elect more GOP senators, according to a source in the room. The former president sat between McConnell and Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, who also has had a rocky relationship with the former president. \u201cHe is the choice of our voters overwhelmingly. It shows that he is absolutely the leader of the party,\u201d Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri said of Trump. \u201cI mean, you had people who have vociferously opposed him, who were sitting right next to him in the room.\u201d Trump himself praised a \u201cgreat meeting\u201d with Senate Republicans, saying there\u2019s \u201ctremendous unity\u201d in the GOP. Trump made a point of saying he\u2019ll stand behind GOP lawmakers in their own races, telling the senators beside him, \u201cYou\u2019re all either elected or you\u2019re going to be elected again and reelected, and I\u2019m with every one of you and you know that.\u201d Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida characterized the meeting as \u201cgetting the team back together\u201d and providing the state of the former president\u2019s campaign. \u201cOptimism, but a lot of work to be done,\u201d Rubio said. Meanwhile,\u00a0Sen. John Cornyn of Texas said the former president \u201cexpressed frustration\u201d over his recent conviction. \u201cHe expressed frustration over the recent trial, you can imagine, and justifiably in my view,\u201d Cornyn said. He said Trump did not bring up January 6. This story has been updated with additional developments.

Officers stopped Judd Sanson after noticing a\u00a0blacked-out license plate on the Black Ford Explorer he was driving around 1:30\u00a0a.m., according to NYPD. The officers ended up finding a large cache of\u00a0weapons, handcuffs, NYPD uniform items and a New York City transit vest, NYPD Chief of Department Jeffrey B. Maddrey told reporters Wednesday. Sanson, 27, was taken into custody and now faces charges of criminal possession of a weapon \u2013 a loaded firearm, criminal possession of a weapon, unlawful possession of ammo feed device, and an obscured license plate, the NYPD told CNN in an email. In court Thursday, his lawyer entered a not guilty plea and Sanson was remanded into custody. His next hearing is set for Monday. During their search of Sanson\u2019s car, officers also found a 9-millimeter Glock, 100 rounds of ammunition, a stun gun, multiple knives, a weighted whip, an expandable baton, heavy body armor and two axes, Maddrey said. The man allegedly had a bullet-proof vest with an NYPD patch on the front as well as an orange MTA vest typically worn by workers in New York City subways, according to police officials with knowledge of the investigation. Police displayed the items at a news conference on Wednesday, including the Guy Fawkes mask made popular by the movie \u201cV for Vendetta.\u201d According to an affidavit released Thursday, police found an expandable baton with the words \u201cleft me no choice,\u201d \u201cyou gon learn today\u201d (sic) and \u201castaghfirullah\u201d written in marker. That latter phrase is Arabic for \u201cI seek forgiveness in God,\u201d the affidavit states. Sanson also told an officer, in sum and substance, \u201cSorry, I\u2019ll take it off. There\u2019s a lot of drunk people nowadays,\u201d according to the affidavit. Questions about motive After the court hearing Thursday, Queens District Attorney Melinda Katz said investigators would look through all of Sanson\u2019s social media accounts to find out his true motives. \u201cWhen someone is driving around with 11 different weapons, all of this ammunition, language on the baton that sounds threatening, transit uniforms that can be used almost anywhere in our subway system or in our transit system, we have reason to be concerned,\u201d Katz said. A day earlier, Maddrey said \u201cit\u2019s still too early\u201d in the active investigation to determine if the incident is related to terrorism. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be very thorough with this investigation,\u201d Maddrey said. \u201cIt will be investigated by the detective bureau along with our intel unit to just see what else we can learn about this arrest.\u201d Police sources said investigators from the NYPD\u2019s Intelligence Division and the Joint Terrorism Task Force were brought in because of the number and types of weapons, the gun, the amount of ammunition and vests with police and transit symbols. Investigators are also examining writings found in the car and on social media, the police sources said. \u201cMembers of this department make gun arrests, weapons arrests, arrests for knives every day. But an arrest of this magnitude \u2013 the amount of ammunition, NYPD paraphernalia\u00a0in the car, was significant,\u201d Maddrey said Wednesday. New York\u00a0Gov. Kathy Hochul said officials take the case \u201cvery seriously,\u201d but could not say whether the man was plotting an attack. \u201cThere is no tolerance for this behavior, this is criminal, and I have confidence\u00a0in\u00a0our system that this\u00a0individual will be prosecuted and handled to the fullest extent\u00a0of\u00a0the law,\u201d Hochul told CNN\u2019s Laura Coates\u00a0Wednesday night. \u201cThis is unacceptable\u00a0in\u00a0the State\u00a0of\u00a0New York, it\u2019s frightening but it\u2019s important to know that the police are\u00a0on\u00a0top\u00a0of\u00a0this and more will be reported as we are able to disclose this to the public,\u201d she said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/13/us/new-york-arrest-weapons-nypd/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/14/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_12_us_southern-baptists-women-pastors-vote", "text": "Southern Baptists narrowly rejected a proposal Wednesday to enshrine a ban on churches with women pastors in the denomination\u2019s constitution after opponents argued it was unnecessary because the denomination already has a way of ousting such churches. The vote received support from 61% of the delegates but failed to get the required two-thirds supermajority. The action reversed a preliminary vote last year in favor of the official ban. But it still leaves the Southern Baptist Convention with its official doctrinal statement saying the office of pastor is limited to men. Even the opponents of the ban said they favored that doctrinal statement but didn\u2019t think it was necessary to reinforce it in the constitution. Opponents noted that the SBC already can oust churches that assert women can serve as pastors \u2014 as it did\u00a0last year\u00a0and again\u00a0Tuesday night. The vote was perhaps the most highly anticipated of the annual meeting, reflecting years of debate in the United States\u2019 largest Protestant denomination. It is the final day of the SBC\u2019s two-day annual meeting in Indianapolis. Since 2000, the SBC\u2019s nonbinding statement of faith has declared that only men are qualified for the role of pastor. It\u2019s interpreted differently across the denomination, with some believing it doesn\u2019t apply to associate pastors so long as the senior pastor is male. The proposed amendment, which received preliminary approval last year, would formally exclude churches that have women in any pastoral positions, from lead pastor to associates, or even affirms them in that role. Supporters believe it is biblically necessary, estimating hundreds of Southern Baptist churches have women in those roles. The rejected amendment would have said any church deemed in \u201cfriendly cooperation\u201d \u2014 the official term for SBC affiliation \u2014 must be one that \u201caffirms, appoints, or employs only men as any kind of pastor or elder as qualified by Scripture.\u201d Opponents argued the convention already has the power to remove churches over this issue, and the amendment will have unintended consequences, including disproportionately affecting Black Southern Baptist congregations, which tend to have women on their pastoral staffs. But the motion went swiftly to a vote after only brief debate. Ryan Fullerton, pastor of Immanuel Baptist Church in Louisville, Kentucky, said the measure is \u201cnot about preventing women from exercising their gifts\u201d in the church, in roles on church staff such as \u201cchildren\u2019s ministers.\u201d But he said the Bible is clear that the office of pastor is for men. He said there is \u201cconfusion about gender\u201d in the wider culture and cited what he called \u201cthe ravages of the LGBTQIA agenda.\u201d But Spence Shelton, pastor of Mercy Church in Charlotte, North Carolina, argued that it was unnecessary. He said there is no doubt that Southern Baptists are \u201ccomplementarian,\u201d as they describe the view that men and women have equal value but different roles that complement one another. But he noted that the convention voted to affirm the ouster of a historic Virginia church Tuesday and two other churches last year, including the California megachurch Saddleback, which all have women pastors and affirmed they could hold top pastoral positions. The reason for ousting them was that they didn\u2019t have a faith and practice consistent with the Baptist Faith and Message, the document approved in 2000 that includes the affirmation that the pastoral position is reserved for men. \u201cY\u2019all, we have shown the mechanisms we currently have are sufficient to deal with this question,\u201d Shelton said. Mike Law, pastor of Arlington Baptist Church in Virginia and author of the amendment, cited a report that there are about 1,800 women pastors working in the denomination. He cited Bible verses limiting the pastoral office to men. \u201cOur culture may see this prohibition as harsh, but our God is all wise, and wrote this word for the flourishing of both men and women,\u201d he said. \u201cThis amendment is not about women in ministry,\u201d Law added. \u201cIt\u2019s specifically about women in the pastoral office.\u201d He did not spell out the difference in his brief floor speech. The denomination can\u2019t tell its independent churches what to do or whom to appoint as a pastor. But they can say which churches are in and which are out. Last year, Southern Baptists refused to take back Saddleback, one of the convention\u2019s largest congregations, and a small Kentucky church over the issue. Both churches, which had women in top pastoral positions, appealed their ouster to the 2023 annual meeting and were overwhelmingly rejected by the delegates. A similar scenario played out in Indianapolis on Tuesday, when messengers voted overwhelmingly to kick out First Baptist Church of Alexandria in Virginia, which has a woman in an associate position and also asserted that women can hold the top job. Supporters of the amendment say it probably won\u2019t result in an immediate, large-scale purge, but opponents expressed concern it would burden SBC volunteers and staff with numerous investigations of churches. Delegates also elected a North Carolina pastor and longtime denominational statesman to be the next president of their convention in a contest between six candidates that went into two run-off votes. Clint Pressley, who is senior pastor of Hickory Grove Baptist Church in Charlotte, will be the next Southern Baptist Convention president after winning 56% of votes in the final run-off race. The SBC president \u2014 one of the most prominent faces of the conservative evangelical network of churches \u2014 presides over the annual meeting and appoints members to the denomination\u2019s committees. Pressley\u2019s nearest opponent, Tennessee pastor, Dan Spencer, received 44 percent of the votes after four other candidates were eliminated in earlier rounds. Pressley has said he favors a measure being voted on later Wednesday to amend the SBC constitution to ban churches with women pastors. Pressley earned a master of divinity from New Orleans Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisiana, one of the SBC\u2019s official seminaries. He has led Hickory Grove since 2011 after pastoring churches in Alabama and Mississippi. Pressley was first vice president of the SBC in 2014-15 and served on numerous other denominational boards. Messengers early Wednesday rejected a proposal to abolish the SBC\u2019s public policy agency, the Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission. The measure reflected the views of some that the staunchly conservative commission wasn\u2019t conservative enough.

{"id": "2024_06_12_us_arizona-man-indicted-plan-attack-targeting-black-people-atlanta-concert", "text": "An Arizona man was indicted by a federal grand jury this week on several firearms charges, having been accused by the US Justice Department of planning a mass shooting targeting Black people and other minorities at a May Atlanta concert in hopes of inciting a race war before the upcoming presidential election. Mark Prieto, 58, had seven guns when he was arrested on May 14 while driving east from Arizona through New Mexico, the US Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of Arizona said in a news release Tuesday. He faces charges of firearms trafficking, transfer of a firearm for use in a hate crime and possession of an unregistered firearm, the release said. The indictment against Prieto alleges he discussed his plans between January and May with two people whom he believed \u201cshared his racist beliefs,\u201d unaware they were working with the FBI, the US Attorney\u2019s Office said. He then sold an AK-style rifle and an AR-style rifle to one of those individuals within the span of a month, all while under FBI surveillance, the release said. Prieto was targeting a concert scheduled for May 14 and May 15 at State Farm Arena in downtown Atlanta, according to a statement of probable cause attached to the federal complaint. While it does not specify whose concert Prieto allegedly targeted, a schedule for the venue shows Puerto Rican rapper and singer Bad Bunny was slated to perform there on those dates. After his arrest, Prieto denied he was going to Atlanta, but he did admit to knowing the two people who were working with the FBI, and told agents he had no intentions of carrying out the attack, the federal complaint states. CNN has reached out to Prieto\u2019s public defender in New Mexico for comment. If convicted, the charges of firearms trafficking and transfer of a firearm for use in a hate crime each carry a maximum sentence of 15 years in prison and a $250,000 fine, the US Attorney\u2019s Office said. A conviction for possession of an unregistered firearm carries a sentence of up to 10 years and a $250,000 fine. Indictment outlines monthslong undercover operation One of the individuals Prieto confided in was an undercover FBI agent, while the other was a confidential source who\u2019d spoken with Prieto more than a dozen times at different gun shows over the last three years, according to the complaint. That source told the FBI in late 2023 that Prieto had made comments advocating for a mass shooting targeting \u201cblacks, Jews, or Muslims,\u201d the complaint says. Prieto wanted to carry the shooting out prior to the election in November, the complaint says, because he believed martial law would be in place afterwards, making the attack impossible. The source and the undercover agent met with Prieto at four different gun shows in each of the months between January and May, the complaint states. At the first, Prieto allegedly shared his plans to carry out a shooting in Atlanta \u2013 specifically at a rap concert, the complaint says, because Prieto believed there would be a high concentration of Black people. Prieto said he was focused on Georgia because of what he perceived as its shifting politics; he attributed this to its Black population, which he referred to using the n-word, the complaint says. Over the next few months, Prieto allegedly provided more and more detail about his attack, outlining which weapons and types of ammo he wanted the group to use and what they would wear, the complaint shows. He also allegedly expressed a desire to travel to Atlanta prior to the shooting to set up weapon caches. Prieto wanted to ensure the attack was seen as racially motivated, saying he wanted to leave Confederate flags at the scene and say things like, \u201cwhities out here killing,\u201d and \u201cKKK all the way,\u201d according to the complaint. He \u201calso emphasized that the most important thing was a high body count,\u201d the complaint states. At a fifth gun show in early May, Prieto told the source he was going to leave for Atlanta to conduct reconnaissance and they would meet again at another gun show scheduled for the weekend of June 1, the complaint says. After being read his Miranda rights on May 14, the complaint says, Prieto denied he was going to Atlanta, telling investigators he was bound for Florida to visit his mother. He admitted to knowing both the undercover agent and the confidential source and to having discussed an attack at a \u201crock\u201d concert, the complaint says, but he told agents he did not intend to carry out the attack.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/12/us/arizona-man-indicted-plan-attack-targeting-black-people-atlanta-concert/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/14/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_13_us_cal-state-palestinian-protests", "text": "Pro-Palestinian protesters who entered and barricaded themselves in a building at California State University, Los Angeles, on Wednesday cleared out by early Thursday, a spokesperson for the school told CNN. Most protesters left the Student Services Building of their own accord around 1:15 a.m. local time and returned to an unauthorized encampment on campus. No arrests were made, university spokesperson Erik Frost Hollins said. A small group remained inside but the university\u2019s Department of Public Safety officers entered the building and asked them to leave, and they complied, Hollins said. University President Berenecea Johnson Eanes, whose office is in the building, according to the university\u2019s website, was among dozens of employees who remained inside during the takeover. She and other administrators were safely escorted out after midnight Thursday, Hollins said. The group of 50 to 100 protesters barricaded the exits on the first floor on Wednesday and blocked off areas around the building, Hollins told the Los Angeles Times. The university asked employees on the upper floors to shelter in place, Hollins said. Video from CNN affiliate\u00a0KABC showed protesters moving furniture on the first floor of the building with signs on windows and plywood spray-painted with the messages, \u201cThe time to escalate is now!\u201d and \u201cCSU stop funding genocide.\u201d Demonstrators \u201cdon\u2019t want folks inside the building,\u201d a protester told KABC, saying, \u201cThis is not a hostage situation.\u201d The university called the Los Angeles Police Department to assist, CNN affiliate\u00a0KCAL/KCBS reported. \u201cSignificant\u201d damage including broken glass and graffiti was observed on the interior and exterior of the building, primarily the first four floors, according to Hollins. All classes and operations at\u00a0the university\u2019s main campus will be held remotely until further notice, according to a message posted on its\u00a0website. \u201cPlease do not come to main campus,\u201d the Protest Action Alert reads. Meanwhile, operations on Cal State\u2019s downtown campus will remain normal, the alert said. An assessment will be done to determine the overall cost of the damage and when the building, which houses services like financial aid and student support, will reopen. \u201cIt will take time to recover and to provide these services in the same way that we were able to before, and that\u2019s deeply unfortunate,\u201d Hollins said. On Thursday, Eanes ordered the encampment that has been on the campus for the past 40 days to be dismantled following what she referred to in a statement as \u201cviolence and destruction\u201d that unfolded Wednesday night, according to the university. \u201cKnow that we will recover from this, but also know that I am committed to doing everything we can to ensure this will never be allowed to repeat,\u201d the university\u2019s president said. \u201cThe Encampment has crossed a line. Those in the Encampment must leave.\u201d Eanes did not give a timeline of when the encampment will be dismantled or if the university would request assistance from law enforcement. Three employees and a student were reportedly assaulted during the protest \u2013 one person was assaulted as the protesters entered the university building, another as they were leaving, one was \u201caccosted on a walkway\u201d and another who was looking at damage, said Eanes, who did not say if they were injured. The demonstrations escalated due to frustration with university officials who sent a message regarding encampments, which \u201creiterated something \u2026 said 20 days ago,\u201d a protester told KABC. The protesters\u2019 actions at Cal State, Los Angeles, come as some American campuses continue to be convulsed by pro-Palestinian demonstrations denouncing Israel\u2019s handling of its war against Hamas in Gaza. Protests late this spring gripped schools across the country, but they have persisted in some places, including at UCLA \u2013 some 20 miles west of Cal State, Los Angeles \u2013 where 27 people were arrested Monday after setting up multiple pro-Palestinian encampments that police said were unlawful. Additionally, at least six University of California Police Department personnel and other safety officers were injured in confrontations with the protesters, including one person with a head injury, Rick Braziel, UCLA\u2019s associate vice chancellor for campus safety, said in\u00a0a news release Tuesday. Of those arrested at UCLA, 18 were students, and two were faculty, police said. Another was a former student, while the rest were not affiliated with the university.

{"id": "2024_06_13_us_amy-donofrio-florida-teacher", "text": "A former Jacksonville, Florida, teacher who said she was fired for displaying a Black Lives Matter flag outside her high school classroom will be able to reapply for her teaching license, an attorney representing the teacher confirmed to CNN. Attorney Mark Richard said a five-member panel of Florida\u2019s Education Practices Commission agreed with an administrative judge\u2019s recommendation that Amy Donofrio receive a written reprimand after state officials accused the teacher of bringing her personal views into the classroom. \u201cBlack students matter, and they are worth fighting for 100 percent every single day,\u201d Donofrio said after the hearing. \u201cTeachers across the state feel that way too.\u201d Donofrio said her goal remains to return to the classroom. Her contract with the school was not renewed after the 2020-21 school year. \u201cIt\u2019s a big day in Florida for teachers,\u201d Richard told CNN. \u201cYou can stand up to a system that\u2019s been attacking teachers and prevail.\u201d Thursday\u2019s hearing was prompted by administrative law judge Suzanne Van Wyk\u2019s April recommendation that Donofrio receive a written reprimand for\u00a0wearing and displaying face masks that read \u201cRobert E. Lee was a gang member\u201d as the district was in the process of renaming six schools. Donofrio was a beloved and highly regarded high school teacher in Jacksonville, where for years\u00a0she\u00a0sought to empower students and advocate for racial justice. Outside the room where she taught English to mostly Black students at the former Robert E. Lee High School she had placed a sign that read, \u201cHate Has No Home Here,\u201d according to the April order by an administrative law judge. \u201cMs. Donofrio was a pillar for us,\u201d former student Diamond Wallace, 24, told CNN this week. \u201cShe acted as a rock for us and she was more like a mom, like a second mom to all of us students.\u201d  At the start of the 2020 school year,\u00a0in the aftermath of\u00a0George Floyd\u2019s murder\u00a0at the hands of\u00a0police in Minneapolis, Donofrio,\u00a0who is White, put up a large \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d banner outside her classroom.\u00a0She had displayed\u00a0a BLM sign and t-shirt in her classroom as early as 2018, according to\u00a0findings in\u00a0the administrative judge\u2019s\u00a0recommendation. Administrators\u00a0asked her to remove it,\u00a0and expressed concern the display might violate school district\u00a0policy. Donofrio refused. She said she believed the policy did not apply to the banner.\u00a0On March 23, 2021, a school administrator removed the banner \u2013\u00a0about five months after she was first asked to bring it down. A day later Donofrio was reassigned to a work at a district warehouse. School officials had also voiced concerns that Donofrio\u00a0displayed Robert E. Lee face masks in her classroom\u00a0\u2013 which they considered to be an expression of her personal view. At the time the school district was in the process of renaming six schools named for Confederate generals.\u00a0Donofrio denied the masks \u2013 which were common during the pandemic \u2013 were on display. She said the logo \u201cI am not a gang member\u201d was a phrase students use as part of their advocacy of racial justice, according to the administrative judge\u2019s findings. Van\u00a0Wyk\u2019s order noted in part that the \u201coffense was not severe\u201d and there was no danger or harm to the public or students. The judge determined there was no evidence that Donofrio\u00a0\u201cfailed to distinguish between her personal views and those of the School, or District\u201d when she displayed the Black Lives Matter banner or that it went against district policy, according to her findings. The five-person panel of the Education Practices Commission \u2013 a member of law enforcement, a parent and three teachers \u2013 had the final say and could have revoked her teaching license. The quasi-judicial state agency imposes discipline on teachers and school administrators. \u201cI\u2019m not doing the thing that I was born to do, that I loved more than anything and I\u2019m having to fight to get it back,\u201d Donofrio, who taught at the school for nine years but has not been allowed back in a Florida classroom since 2021, told CNN earlier this week. She added, \u201cSchool is supposed to be a safe place for students. It\u2019s about them.\u201d Florida Education officials didn\u2019t respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment ahead of the hearing. The decision on Donofrio\u2019s future as a teacher came at a time when Florida\u2019s classrooms have become front lines in Gov. Ron DeSantis\u2019 culture wars, which have taken aim at\u00a0every aspect of education from\u00a0formal classroom\u00a0instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity to what\u00a0public\u00a0schools teach about racism and American history to what books students can read and what\u00a0bathrooms they can use. \u201cOur school system should be about educating kids not indoctrinating kids,\u201d\u00a0DeSantis told reporters in May 2023. \u2018I\u2019m a passionate, quality teacher\u2019 In 2021, the BLM banner\u00a0hanging over\u00a0Donofrio\u2019s\u00a0classroom door, as well as her outspokenness on racial justice,\u00a0became\u00a0a political flash point across the state. Her advocacy of racial justice was\u00a0brought up in discussions\u00a0about whether the school should abandon its Confederate namesake. The school was renamed Riverside High School in\u00a0June\u00a02021. Days before the banner was taken down, the district published a memo that stated \u201cemployees are not permitted to display flags, banners or other signage representing a particular social cause or movement in a manner that may be interpreted as District speech,\u201d and identified \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d as \u201can expression of support for a social justice movement,\u201d according to the administrative judge\u2019s\u00a0recommended\u00a0order. Florida\u2019s former education commissioner\u00a0called it an example of \u201cindoctrination\u201d and \u201ccritical race theory\u201d in schools \u2013 even though the discipline was not part of Donofrio\u2019s curriculum. \u201cThere was an entire classroom memorialized to Black Lives Matter,\u201d the former commissioner, Richard Corcoran, told reporters at the time. \u201cWe made sure she was terminated.\u201d Donofrio was not fired even as she defied multiple requests from school officials to take down the flag. She also challenged the district on its treatment of Black students and staff. Her students responded by collecting nearly 18,000 signatures on a public petition calling for her return. \u201cI wasn\u2019t removed for anything having to do with my teaching,\u201d Donofrio said. \u201cNo one has ever been able to say anything.\u00a0Nor of my test scores, right, reflected anything but that I\u2019m a passionate, quality teacher.\u201d Donofrio eventually sued Duval County Public Schools and its regional high school superintendent in federal court, alleging that the district retaliated against her \u201cfor her protected speech, her complaints about discrimination, and, more broadly, her support of Black students\u2019 lives,\u201d according to a complaint\u00a0filed in April 2021. The school board paid $300,000 to settle the lawsuit in 2021, according to CNN affiliate WJXT. \u201cI really thought that things were kind of moving forward and then suddenly, we turned human compassion into something that\u2019s controversial,\u201d Donofrio said. Donofrio\u2019s outspokenness on racial justice was not new. Even before she put out the Black Lives Matter flag, she had led a course for several years to empower Black students through professional development, college preparation and civic engagement. \u201cFor her to be able to make teenagers feel comfortable enough to come in her classroom and express the trauma that they have gone through voluntarily, that\u2019s a gift,\u201d said Wallace\u2019s mother, Renita Turner. Donofrio and her students\u00a0earned national attention, and the course eventually became the organization known as the\u00a0EVAC Movement.\u00a0Students traveled to the White House in 2016 and met with congressional leaders. Then-President Barack Obama met with them when he visited Jacksonville. \u201cIt is honestly the most beautiful thing I have ever been a part of,\u201d Donofrio recalled this week,\u00a0referring to the EVAC movement\u00a0and the attention it garnered for her students. \u201cTeachers have gathered to swing back in the name of teaching honest history, teaching honestly to their students,\u201d said Donofrio\u2019s lawyer, Mark Richard. \u201cWe do not want to be caught in these culture wars.\u201d Donofrio added, \u201cMy students matter, teachers who care about students matter \u2026 I have no doubt that with or without me, they\u2019re going to change the world.\u201d CNN\u2019s Harmeet Kaur contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/13/us/amy-donofrio-florida-teacher/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/14/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_12_us_mount-rainier-missing-skier-death", "text": "A female skier who had been missing for a month was found dead at the base of a waterfall in Washington state\u2019s Mount Rainier National Park, officials say. Rangers found her body Saturday. The search for the skier had been ongoing since May 19, with groups of rangers and volunteers scouring the park for tracks, the National Park Service said in a news release. An unresponsive person was spotted from a helicopter and rangers recovered the body using \u201ctraditional crevasse rescue methods,\u201d the release said. The woman appeared to have fallen roughly 200 feet to the base of Moraine Falls, above the area of Paradise, according to the release. It did not identify the woman. Favorable weather was needed for the helicopter search and the recovery of the body to take place, park officials said. The skier\u2019s body was taken to the Pierce County Medical Examiner\u2019s Office for evaluation. It\u2019s the second death reported in the park in less than a month. Brian Harper, 41, who collapsed near the summit of Mount Rainier on May 31, was in a climbing group led by Alpine Ascents International, a licensed guide service, the park service said. Efforts to perform CPR were unsuccessful, according to a news release. Weather conditions did not become suitable for Harper\u2019s body to be brought down until the next day. A cause of death has not yet been released by the Pierce County Medical Examiner. Another man died at Mount Rainier in August 2022 while descending the Disappointment Cleaver route. Chun Hui Zhang of Surrey, British Columbia was 52. Mount Rainier is an active volcano standing at more than 14,410 feet above sea level. Paradise is about two hours from Seattle. Correction: An earlier version of this story incorrectly identified the capital of Washington. The state capital is Olympia.
