Daken paid off the entire meal debt and then some, for his elementary school in Blue Springs, Missouri, after turning in a check for more than $7,300. Daken\u2019s original goal was $3,500, which was just over\u00a0the total of the school\u2019s debt, according to Daken\u2019s mother, Vanessa Kramer. The remaining amount was given to Blue Springs High School, another school in the district. \u201cChildren in elementary school should not have debt tied to their name. We have found out that there are high schools that keep seniors from attending prom or walking at graduation if they have stuff like student lunch debt,\u201d Kramer said. \u201cSome families can\u2019t help it. They can\u2019t pay it off.\u201d In a video shared to his mom\u2019s Facebook, Daken had challenged \u201cfriends, family and local businesses to donate what they can to this cause.\u201d Upon Daken\u2019s request, Kramer reached out to Blue Springs School District to get information about the school\u2019s meal debt. Soon, the online fundraiser was spreading to states like Texas, Florida and New Jersey. Within a matter of two weeks, Daken\u2019s fundraiser more than doubled his goal. As of Daken\u2019s fifth grade graduation on Tuesday, the Daken Kramer Legacy Award will now be an annual honor for fifth graders striving to make their own mark. \u201cYour selfless actions will impact dozens of students throughout the district,\u201d Kristi Haley, Daken\u2019s teacher, said as she announced the award in his name. \u201cIt\u2019s not the amount of money you raised, although that was absolutely incredible. It\u2019s your heart, your drive, your determination and your grit to help others that inspires us.\u201d Daken said the award took him aback. \u201cIt was definitely a surprise. I had no idea that they were going to do that,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I definitely started to feel a lot of emotions.\u201d A lunch for an elementary schooler in the Blue Springs School District is $2.55 \u2013 with the reduced price being 40 cents for students in need, according to the district. About 29% of the roughly 15,000 students enrolled in the Blue Springs School District are eligible for a free or reduced lunch, district spokesperson Katie Woolf told CNN Thursday. While Daken\u2019s fundraiser cleared his school\u2019s meal debt, the Blue Springs School District meal debt totals to more than $235,000, according to Woolf. The district includes 20 schools at varying levels. The School Nutrition Association reported among the school districts represented by their members \u2013 about one-fifth of US school districts nationwide \u2013 meal debt ranged from $10 to approximately $1 million, according to the school nutrition directors who are members of their organization and who responded to the association\u2019s 2024 survey. The association collected this data as a part of their lobbying effort to try to get more funding for school meal programs. In November 2023, the median reported district meal debt was about $5,495 among districts represented by members who responded to the survey, which was up from about $5,164 in the survey a year prior, according to the association. Hoping to bring wider attention to the issue of school meal debt, Kramer says she and Daken are now working with a Missouri state representative to see if they can take their efforts to the next level. Seeing the droves of people who reached out with support showed Kramer how one person can make a difference, she said. \u201cEven though this is something that kids don\u2019t need to worry about and don\u2019t have any responsibility (for), I\u2019m very, very proud as his mom that he is mature enough to see that there is an issue and if the people who have the power to make a change won\u2019t change anything, then he will step up and make a change,\u201d she said. Daken, whose favorite school lunch is an orange chicken and rice bowl, says kids don\u2019t have to do extraordinary things to be the next recipient of the Daken Kramer Legacy Award. \u201cThey don\u2019t really need to do anything big to get the award,\u201d Daken said. \u201cIt\u2019s only if they really care about it and they are really, really compassionate about helping the school.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/26/us/missouri-daken-kramer-school-lunch-debt/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/31/2024", "section": "us"}}

{"id": "2024_05_28_us_braintree-amc-stabbing-suspect-tuesday", "text": "Jared Ravizza, the suspect linked to stabbings this weekend at a Massachusetts movie theater and a McDonald\u2019s,\u00a0also will face criminal charges in Connecticut in connection to a killing in the town of Deep River, authorities said Tuesday. Ravizza was arraigned Tuesday in Plymouth District Court on four charges stemming from the McDonald\u2019s attack Saturday evening, including armed assault with intent to murder, two counts of assault and battery with a dangerous weapon and indecent exposure. The prosecution filed a motion for Ravizza, 26, to be held without bail, alleging the defendant was tied to another stabbing Saturday of four girls at a Braintree movie theater, as well as facing pending charges in Connecticut related to a homicide. By Tuesday afternoon, Ravizza had appeared in court a second time, where a doctor who evaluated the defendant\u2019s mental health said Ravizza did not \u201cdemonstrate the rational capacity\u201d to work with a defense attorney. The court subsequently ordered Ravizza sent to Bridgewater State Hospital and ordered a further evaluation. Sean O\u2019Neill, an attorney for Ravizza, said he had no comment at this time. The victims at McDonald\u2019s and the movie theater all suffered non-life-threatening injuries, authorities previously said. Connecticut State Police on Tuesday morning said Ravizza will face criminal charges stemming from a homicide in Deep River, which was also discovered Saturday. State troopers, responding around 3:30 p.m. to a reported disturbance, discovered a man identified as Bruce Feldman, 70, outside a home on Maritone Lane in Deep River, Connecticut State Police said in a news release. He was pronounced dead at the scene. \u201cDuring the initial investigation, Troopers developed information indicating that a second individual, who was no longer at the scene, had been present\u201d at the address \u201cearlier in the day,\u201d the release said. \u201cThe second individual was identified as Jared Ravizza.\u201d The investigation in Deep River remains ongoing, it added. \u2018Unprovoked\u2019 theater stabbing preceded McDonald\u2019s attack The two other attacks unfolded later that evening, beginning around 6 p.m. Saturday at an AMC movie theater in Braintree, some 10 miles south of Boston. \u201cWithout saying anything and without any warning, (the assailant) suddenly attacked and stabbed the four young females. The attack appeared to be unprovoked,\u201d Braintree police said in a news release, noting the girls were taken to Boston hospitals. The suspect then fled in what appeared to be a black SUV, police said, and video footage allowed authorities to capture its license plate. Soon after, \u201ca vehicle matching the description was reportedly involved in (a) similar assault in Plymouth,\u201d Braintree police said. In that incident, reported about an hour after the movie theater attack, a 21-year-old woman and a 29-year-old man were stabbed at a McDonald\u2019s. Assistant District Attorney David Cutshall identified both victims as employees at Tuesday\u2019s arraignment, telling the court Ravizza allegedly entered the restaurant\u2019s drive through in a black Porsche, stepped out of the vehicle and publicly urinated. Ravizza was \u201cargumentative\u201d with a male employee, then allegedly stabbed the employee in the forearm with \u201cwhat appeared to be a long kitchen knife.\u201d Ravizza parked the car, Cutshall said, before going inside and allegedly stabbing the female employee in her arm. Both victims are in stable condition, Cutshall added. Minutes later, Massachusetts state troopers identified the vehicle and tried to pull it over, but the driver failed to stop, state police said previously. A chase ensued, and the vehicle eventually crashed in Sandwich, south of Plymouth. Suspect is a self-described philanthropist and business owner Meanwhile, more details about Ravizza\u2019s background are emerging, including the fact the defendant was arrested last month in Martha\u2019s Vineyard, accused of assault and battery of a family member and vandalism, according to court records at Edgartown District Court. Records show the case has not been adjudicated. Ravizza\u2019s father told officers Jared \u201chad just had a mental break and attacked him\u201d inside his home,\u00a0The Boston Globe\u00a0reported, citing a police report on file with the court. The report also said Ravizza allegedly wrecked the father\u2019s home office, according to The Boston Globe. Ravizza was sent to Martha\u2019s Vineyard Hospital for a mental health evaluation, but \u201cdid not meet their standards to be held,\u201d the Boston Globe reported, citing the report. Ravizza is a self-described philanthropist, professional skier, business owner and artist, according to Ravizza\u2019s social media pages and newspaper reports. According to Ravizza\u2019s business website, Ravizza owns a digital marketing and social media management agency called \u201cRavizza Jones,\u201d which is\u00a0registered in Massachusetts. On its website, the business is described as a \u201cleading global digital marketing & social media management agency representing leading companies, brands and individuals in digital media and online marketing.\u201d Media outlets\u00a0such as\u00a0the\u00a0Martha\u2019s Vineyard Times\u00a0and SNOW Magazine\u00a0have previously interviewed Ravizza, who recalled past\u00a0philanthropy, activism and career as a professional skier. In a 2021 article, the\u00a0Martha Vineyard\u2019s Times described Ravizza as a professional skier who created a global initiative as \u201ca resource for people with autism, disabilities, and illnesses\u201d and said Ravizza \u201cworks with adults and athletes, providing mentorship and exercise, among other things.\u201d \u201cWe spend a lot of time on the Vineyard, in Massachusetts, and I just want people to know the accessibility to me,\u201d Ravizza told\u00a0The Martha Vineyard\u2019s Times in 2021. \u201cI also hope this story will inspire someone to start an initiative of their own \u2026 maybe you\u2019re someone on the Vineyard and you want to start helping people,\u201d Ravizza said. The suspect\u2019s Instagram account also includes several photos of Ravizza driving around in expensive cars, including the\u00a0same kind of\u00a0Porsche Ravizza allegedly drove\u00a0from the AMC theater to the McDonald\u2019s.

The release did not say how the monkey was captured or where it was found, but animal services expressed gratitude \u201cfor the public\u2019s support\u201d in finding him. \u201cWe so appreciate the community\u2019s support for animal welfare,\u201d the release said. The Colleton County Sheriff\u2019s Office had advised residents in a Facebook post last Friday a primate was loose somewhere in the Walterboro area. The sheriff\u2019s office said the animal\u2019s owner was attempting to capture it and called in assistance. The monkey had lived in Walterboro for the past six years, according to animal services. \u201cAnimal Control and the Sheriff\u2019s Office have received numerous tips as to Bradley\u2019s location but because of the attention this situation has caused on social media and news channels, people who are trying to get a look at Bradley are sadly hampering the owner\u2019s efforts to catch him,\u201d said animal services director Laura Clark. Professionals were hired to help reunite Bradley with his owner, Clark added. An image taken by Walterboro resident Tiffany Edenfield seems to show the primate standing in the grass. It has a red face, similar to some species of baboon and macaque monkeys. One Walterboro resident, Kordell Brabham, didn\u2019t believe his grandmother at first when she said she had spotted a \u201cmonkey\u201d in the yard. \u201cNana, I think you need to go inside, it may be a little too hot out here for you,\u201d Brabham said he told her. But soon after, he spotted the animal his grandmother was talking about. In a video shared with CNN, the escapee can be seen walking on top of a shed. Brabham was shocked and said the first thought running through his mind was, \u201cdon\u2019t get too close, that\u2019s a monkey.\u201d The animal eventually climbed down from the shed and went into a nearby yard, Brabham said. Residents had been advised not to approach the primate, which the sheriff\u2019s office said \u201ccould be stressed,\u201d and only to report sightings. \u201cPlease monitor your pets while they are outside as a precaution,\u201d the sheriff\u2019s office added. The sheriff\u2019s office had received a report of the primate \u201cattempting to attack a resident\u2019s dog in a yard,\u201d according to South Carolina news station WLTX. It\u2019s unclear how the animal got loose or came to live in Walterboro, a city of over 5,000 people. South Carolina law says it\u2019s illegal to purchase or possess great apes \u2013 chimpanzees, gorillas and orangutans. But it is legal to keep other wild animals as pets, according to the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control. Smaller primates like monkeys and baboons seem to fall outside the state\u2019s law on possessing wildlife. CNN has reached out to officials for more information.

{"id": "2024_05_30_us_michigan-state-trooper-samuel-sterling-murder-charge", "text": "A Michigan State Police detective has been charged with murder after investigators say he fatally struck a fleeing suspect with an unmarked SUV last month near Grand Rapids, state prosecutors announced. Detective Sgt. Brian Keely on April 17 tried to arrest the suspect, 25-year-old Samuel Sterling, but Sterling fled and was chased by law enforcement officers by vehicle and on foot, according to the Michigan Department of the Attorney General. As Sterling was running through a fast food restaurant parking lot in the suburb of Kentwood, the detective \u2013 driving an unmarked SUV \u2013 turned and struck Sterling with the vehicle, prosecutors said. Sterling fell to the ground and began yelling and groaning about pain in his back, body-worn police camera footage shows. He was taken to a hospital where he died from his injuries, the attorney general\u2019s office said. Keely, 50, has been charged with one count of second-degree murder, which carries a life sentence, as well as an alternative charge of involuntary manslaughter, Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel announced Tuesday. Alternative charges are typically lesser charges brought by prosecutors as a backup in case they can\u2019t prove the most serious offense. \u201cDetective Sergeant Keely\u2019s actions that day were legally, grossly negligent and created a very high risk of death or great bodily harm, which could have otherwise been prevented,\u201d Nessel said. Keely was suspended from his position following the incident, Michigan State Police Director Col. James Grady II said last month. CNN has sought comment from state police on his employment status following the murder charge. The case comes amid a national push for greater scrutiny of police use of force, especially against people of color. Grady announced in April the agency would investigate the fatal collision and acknowledged the pain many in the community were grappling with. \u201cAs an African American male and a father, it\u2019s not lost on me that this is the death of another young African American male following an interaction with police,\u201d Grady said. After the charges against Keely were announced, Sterling family attorney Ven Johnson said, \u201cWe applaud and appreciate Attorney General Dana Nessel for doing the right thing based on the overwhelming evidence that Keely\u00a0broke the law when he ran over Samuel Sterling.\u201d Keely\u2019s attorney, Marc Curtis, said in a release, \u201cIt is unfortunate that in this time of political correctness,\u00a0Michigan\u2019s Attorney General has chosen to ignore the facts of this incident and rely on political pressure.\u201d Video shows moment SUV hits Sterling On May 10, state police announced the investigation was complete and all evidence had been turned over to the attorney general\u2019s office. That same day, the agency released an edited compilation of body-worn and dashboard camera footage of the incident. The footage shows at least one officer chasing Sterling on foot into a Burger King parking lot when a large grey SUV veers into the lot and hits Sterling, appearing to pin him against the restaurant wall. After the SUV reverses away from him, several officers converge on Sterling and order him to put his hands behind his back. Sterling repeatedly screams, \u201cMy back,\u201d and groans in pain. After his hands are cuffed in front of him, Sterling continues to complain that his back and entire body hurt. \u201cDon\u2019t move man,\u201d an officer says. Officers ask him where he feels pain and repeatedly tell him not to move until emergency medical personnel arrive. Another officer says, \u201cWe don\u2019t want you to move your back.\u201d Sterling\u2019s family was \u201cstunned and appalled\u201d when they watched the footage, their attorney said in a\u00a0statement to CNN affiliate\u00a0WWMT. \u201cNo one person should be able to appoint themselves as judge, jury and executioner, yet deaths from\u00a0police\u00a0brutality and excessive force continue to occur too often. We will continue to seek justice for his family and hold accountable those responsible for his death,\u201d Johnson said. While the basic standard is that law enforcement officers can only use deadly force against a suspect if they pose an imminent threat of death or serious injury, this case presents an unusual set of circumstances, said CNN\u2019s Chief Law Enforcement and Intelligence Analyst John Miller. \u201cThe case will hinge on several factors: Would a reasonable person with Keely\u2019s police training believe that hitting Sterling with the car would have a likelihood of causing serious injury or death? Was that use of force reasonable under the circumstances?\u201d he said. The law requires officers to consider the \u201ctotality of circumstances,\u201d Miller noted. \u201cFor instance, in the case of chasing a burglary suspect or shoplifter, deadly force should not be used to stop them,\u201d Miller said.\u00a0\u201cBut if police located a serial killer or an armed active shooter who was running away and their escape posed an imminent threat to others that they might attack or kill, the use of deadly force to stop them could be justified.\u201d At the time of the encounter, law enforcement officers representing multiple departments, including the US Marshals Service, \u201cwere working a fugitive arrest operation\u201d in an attempt to arrest Sterling, who \u201cwas wanted on multiple warrants,\u201d Grady\u00a0said\u00a0in April. Authorities did not reveal the nature of the charges. Keely\u2019s attorney said Sterling\u2019s loss of life is \u201ctragic and can never be replaced\u201d but argued his death was \u201can accident that could have been avoided had Mr. Sterling simply turned himself in\u201d before a task force was assigned to catch him. \u201cThis accident could have also been avoided if Mr. Sterling would have simply complied with the commands of the Detectives,\u201d Curtis said. Keely will be arraigned in Kentwood district court, though the date has not been set.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/30/us/michigan-state-trooper-samuel-sterling-murder-charge/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/31/2024", "section": "us"}}

The competition\u2019s final round kicked off Thursday night at Gaylord National Resort & Convention Center in National Harbor, Maryland, following preliminary, quarterfinal and semifinal segments on Tuesday and Wednesday. The competition\u2019s start this year also featured a short video message from first lady Dr. Jill Biden, who shared she was also once a school Spelling Bee competitor. \u201cThe President and I can\u2019t wait to cheer you on,\u201d she said in the message. The finalists included: YY Liang, 12, from New York; Aditi Muthukumar, 13, from Colorado; Shrey Parikh, 12, from California; Ananya Rao Prassanna, 13, from North Carolina; Rishabh Saha, 14, from California; Kirsten Tiffany Santos, 13, from Texas; Bruhat Soma, 12, from Florida; and Faizan Zaki, 12, from Texas. Saha and Liang were eliminated in the final\u2019s first round after spelling their words \u2013 desmotrope and immanent, respectively \u2013 incorrectly. You can watch the finalists compete on ION \u2013 which can be watched for free over the air, and is also available through most cable, satellite and streaming platforms. They are hoping to succeed 2023 winner Dev Shah, who became ruler of the hive with the word psammophile. Contestants are now in the second round, the vocabulary round, which was introduced to the Bee in 2021. Each speller will have to select the correct definition of a word from a multiple choice list. All other rounds of competition consist of traditional word oral spelling. This year\u2019s spellers \u2013 all age 15 or under \u2013 came from all 50 states as well as the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, the US Virgin Islands and Department of Defense Schools in Europe. The Bahamas, Canada and Ghana were also represented among the spellers, according to the Bee\u2019s official website. If a winner is not secured during the final one-person, one-word round, a spell-off can be activated, wherein a speller would have 90 seconds to spell as many words as they can from a predetermined list. 2022 winner Harini Logan earned her title of queen bee this way, spelling 22 words in a minute and a half. While there have been many co-winners, including an eight-person tie in 2019, the spell-off round seeks to weed out the competition to just one champion. According to the 2024 rulebook, there are many instances where a spell-off will be activated, all involving the possibility of no winner at the end of the live broadcast. While all finalists will receive a monetary prize plus other perks, the winner gets more than $50,000 cash, the official trophy, a reference library from Merriam-Webster and reference works from Encyclopedia Britannica, among other buzzworthy prizes. But the sting of losing can\u2019t be too bad as 65 spellers returned this year from previous Bees, including finalists Muthukumar, Parikh, Prassanna, Santos, Soma and Zaki.

Daybell had pleaded not guilty to the charges in the\u00a0deaths of his first wife, Tammy Daybell, and the children of his second wife, Lori Vallow Daybell -\u2013 16-year-old Tylee Ryan and 7-year-old Joshua \u201cJJ\u201d Vallow. Wearing a light blue shirt and yellow tie, Daybell showed no emotion as the verdict was read just after 2 p.m. local time. Authorities have said they\u00a0believe Tylee and JJ were killed in September 2019\u00a0\u2013 the month they were last reported to have been seen \u2013 and that Tammy Daybell was\u00a0found dead\u00a0in her Idaho home on October 19, 2019, a\u00a0few weeks before Chad Daybell married Lori Vallow Daybell. Tammy Daybell was initially believed to have died in her sleep. Law enforcement found the remains of Tylee and JJ on Chad Daybell\u2019s Fremont County property\u00a0in June 2020, authorities said. The state is seeking the death penalty. That phase of the case began Thursday afternoon, with Judge Steven Boyce giving jurors preliminary instructions. Proceedings were to resume Friday morning. After the verdict, JJ\u2019s grandfather, Larry Woodcock, told reporters, \u201cIt\u2019s a sad day. JJ would have been 12 years old, guys. For what?\u201d Woodcock remembered the victims, and asked the same question, over and over. \u201cWhat did they accomplish? Nothing. What did they do? They destroyed families,\u201d Woodcock said of Daybell and Lori Vallow Daybell. But the defendants, Woodcock said, could not destroy the memories relatives have of the victims. \u201cThey can\u2019t take that,\u201d he added, growing emotional at one point. When he heard the jury verdict in court, he said, he felt like he couldn\u2019t breathe. Deliberations began Wednesday and lasted for a little more than two hours. Deliberations resumed just after 8 a.m. local time on Thursday. After deliberating about two hours, the jury asked the court for a missing instruction related to the first-degree murder count in the death of Tammy Daybell. They resumed deliberations shortly after receiving the instruction from the court. Idaho prosecutors claim the killings were fueled by power, sex, money and apocalyptic spiritual beliefs. The prosecutors wrote in a court document that each homicide was \u201cespecially heinous, atrocious or cruel, manifesting exceptional depravity.\u201d Defense attorney John Prior in closing arguments Wednesday said there wasn\u2019t enough direct evidence against Daybell and others were responsible for the deaths. His wife, Vallow Daybell, was\u00a0convicted by a jury\u00a0in May 2023 of the murder of her children and was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. She also was convicted of conspiring to kill his former wife, Tammy Daybell. Vallow Daybell has\u00a0appealed her convictions\u00a0to the state Supreme Court, with her legal team raising the issue of whether she was mentally competent to stand trial. \u2018Sex, money and power\u2019 were key focuses in the trial During opening statements, the prosecutor and defense attorney painted contrasting portraits of the defendant. The state described him as a power-hungry and grandiose man who would stop at nothing for \u201cwhat he considered his rightful destiny.\u201d His defense lawyer portrayed Daybell as a religious man driven into an unfortunate relationship by a \u201cbeautiful, vivacious woman\u201d who knew \u201chow to get what she wants.\u201d \u201cTwo dead children buried in the defendant Chad Daybell\u2019s backyard,\u201d prosecutor Rob Wood said in his first words to the jury. \u201cThe next month his wife is found dead in their marital bed. Seventeen days after the death of his wife, Tammy Daybell, this defendant is\u00a0photographed laughing and dancing on a beach in Hawaii at his wedding to Lori Vallow, a woman who was his mistress and the mother of the children buried\u00a0in the graves on his property. Three dead bodies.\u201d When Daybell \u201chad a chance at what he considered his rightful destiny,\u201d Wood said, he \u201cmade sure that no person and no law would stand in his way.\u201d \u201cHis desire for sex, money and power led him to pursue those ambitions,\u201d the prosecutor added. \u201cAnd this pursuit\u00a0led to the deaths of his wife and Lori\u2019s two innocent children.\u201d Tammy Daybell was initially believed to have died in her sleep, and Chad Daybell remarried less than three weeks after her death in 2019. Prior, the defense attorney, said Daybell\u2019s life began to change after he met Vallow Daybell, a \u201cbeautifully stunning woman\u201d who \u201cstarts giving him a lot of attention\u201d and eventually lured him into an \u201cinappropriate\u201d and \u201cunfortunate\u201d extramarital relationship. Vallow Daybell\u2019s two children from a previous marriage were last seen on different days in September 2019. Tylee Ryan was a \u201cnormal, vibrant teenage girl\u201d who loved her friends and her little brother JJ, who was on the autism spectrum and required special care, according to Wood. In late November 2019, relatives asked police in Rexburg, Idaho,\u00a0to do a welfare check on JJ because they hadn\u2019t talked to him recently. Police didn\u2019t find him at the family\u2019s house but did see Vallow Daybell and Daybell, who said JJ was staying with a family friend in Arizona, according to authorities. When police returned with a search warrant the next day, the couple was gone. They were ultimately found in Hawaii in January 2020. In June 2020, law enforcement officials found the remains of Tylee and JJ on Daybell\u2019s property in Fremont County, Idaho. Vallow Daybell and Daybell were indicted on murder charges in May 2021. Tylee was believed to have been killed between September 8 and 9, 2019, and JJ between September 22 and 23, according to prosecutors. \u201cWe are filled with unfathomable sadness that these two bright stars were stolen from us, and only hope that they died without pain or suffering,\u201d the families of the children said in a statement after the remains were found. During the preliminary hearing, Wood said Daybell helped hide evidence. \u201cThose bodies were concealed, one of them was destroyed, they were located on Chad Daybell\u2019s property,\u201d Wood said. Prior, however, argued the state didn\u2019t \u201ccome close\u201d to having enough evidence to prove Daybell concealed the bodies of JJ or Tylee. \u201cThere\u2019s been no indication of any evidence that this act took place on the night of the 22nd or 23rd, or whatever day it was,\u201d Prior said. Couple believed they were religious figures During opening statements, Wood\u00a0described Chad Daybell as a \u201cseemingly ordinary man\u201d who wrote books about the apocalypse, a person who \u201ccraves significance\u201d and worked as a sexton in a graveyard. In October 2018, Chad Daybell and Vallow Daybell met at a religious conference in Utah and he began to craft an alternate reality where his \u201cobsession for glory was rooted in her adoration for him,\u201d Wood told jurors. Soon, Wood said, they viewed their spouses and even their children as \u201cobstacles\u201d that stood in their way. \u201cAnyone who opposed them were labeled sometimes as dark spirits or even zombies,\u201d the prosecutor said. During opening statements, Prior described his client as a religious man who wrote books about his faith, premonitions, good and evil, and the \u201ccoming of the end of things when his savior, in his mind, is going to come back.\u201d  Chad Daybell and Vallow Daybell called themselves \u201cJames and Elaina\u201d and believed they were religious figures and had a system of rating people as \u201clight\u201d or \u201cdark,\u201d a prosecutor told jurors during Vallow Daybell\u2019s trial. The state accused the couple of using their \u201cdoomsday\u201d religious beliefs to justify the killings. In particular, Daybell and Vallow Daybell\u00a0exchanged texts about Tammy Daybell \u201cbeing in limbo\u201d and \u201cbeing possessed by a spirit named Viola,\u201d according to the indictment. People close to the couple\u00a0said they had been involved in strong religious ideologies. In addition, Daybell was connected to a religious\u00a0doomsday prepper website\u00a0called \u201cPreparing a People,\u201d which described itself as a \u201cseries of lecture events focusing on self-reliance and personal preparation.\u201d The publishers of the site said they decided to pull content featuring either Daybell or Vallow Daybell after the children\u2019s disappearance. Defense points to Vallow Daybell\u2019s brother Prior told the jury about Vallow Daybell\u2019s now-deceased brother, Alex Cox, who\u00a0died in December 2019, and his history of violence \u2013 including the shooting and killing of Vallow Daybell\u2019s former husband, Charles Vallow, in July\u00a02019. The Maricopa County medical examiner in Arizona said Cox died of natural causes,\u00a0CNN affiliate KPHO/KTVK\u00a0reported. \u201cAlex Cox was Lori\u2019s protector,\u201d Prior said. \u201cAlex Cox would do anything and everything to protect, aid and assist Lori Vallow \u2026 Whenever there was a problem or a threat to Lori Vallow, you will hear testimony that Alex Cox came to the rescue.\u201d DNA and forensics experts suggested Cox\u2019s fingerprint was found on plastic wrapped around JJ\u2019s body, Daybell\u2019s defense attorney said.  No DNA or hair belonging to Chad Daybell was found with the children\u2019s bodies, and the exact cause of Tammy Daybell\u2019s death could not be determined, Prior said. How it compares to Vallow Daybell\u2019s trial After Vallow Daybell\u2019s indictment and not guilty plea in 2021, a judge ruled she was incompetent to stand trial, but she was deemed fit to proceed with trial after spending nearly a year in a mental hospital. Vallow Daybell has maintained her innocence. When\u00a0Vallow Daybell was sentenced last year, she denied having killed her children and cited religious texts and beliefs. She said she had spoken to Jesus, her children and her husband\u2019s wife after their deaths and said they were \u201chappy and extremely busy\u201d in heaven. \u201cJesus Christ knows that no one was murdered in this case,\u201d Vallow Daybell said. \u201cAccidental deaths happen, suicides happen, fatal side effects from medications happen.\u201d Judge Steven W. Boyce said at the sentencing hearing: \u201cI don\u2019t believe that any God in any religion would want to have this happen.\u201d The judge said she justified the killings \u201cby going down a bizarre, religious rabbit hole. And clearly you are still down there.\u201d Vallow Daybell has\u00a0appealed her convictions\u00a0to the state Supreme Court, with her legal team raising the issue of whether Vallow Daybell was mentally competent to stand trial.

{"id": "2024_05_30_business_boeing-safety-plan-faa", "text": "Boeing executives presented sweeping changes to the company\u2019s production process and safety systems in a three-hour meeting with the Federal Aviation Administration on Thursday.\u00a0The plan is meant to reassure the public, airline customers and regulators that the troubled company\u2019s planes are safe to fly. \u201cThis is a guide for a new way for Boeing to do business,\u201d FAA Administrator Mike Whitaker said after the meeting. He said he expected the company to produce \u201csystemic change.\u201d Going forward, Boeing and FAA leaders said they will meet weekly on progress implementing the plan and the FAA will conduct monthly reviews. The plan includes several compo\ufeffnents to improve employee training, clarify instructions for assembly line employees, prevent suppliers from shipping defective components to Boeing and go through additional FAA audits, the agency said. The FAA had ordered outgoing Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun and his aides to develop the roadmap after two reviews in February found serious issues at the planemaker. The meeting included Calhoun and other leaders at the company, the FAA said. Whitaker said the meeting included an \u201cextensive PowerPoint presentation that broke the plan into components.\u201d Whitaker said he expects the company to build \u201crobust\u201d safety and quality management plans. He said the FAA will not allow Boeing to increase the number of planes coming off of its Max assembly line each month until it is satisfied on production quality. \u201cI don\u2019t think it will happen in the next few months,\u201d Whitaker said. He said Boeing has not asked the FAA to release it from the limits.\u00a0\u201cWe have not even had preliminary discussions on that point,\u201d he said. And Boeing\u2019s CFO was at an industry conference last week and signaled the company is nowhere close to being ready for increases. Whitaker said the FAA has changed the way it monitors work on the Boeing assembly line. \u201cWe\u2019ve changed that model,\u201d he said, from paperwork audits to inspectors on the assembly line. Whitaker said the FAA and Boeing will have \u201cconstant engagement,\u201d ranging from FAA inspectors on Boeing\u2019s factory floor daily to weekly senior meetings and quarter meetings between the CEO and FAA administrator. Boeing\u2019s planned fixes Work at Boeing has begun on its quality improvement plan, which includes hundreds of hours of new employee training and more time for managers to spend supervising production line work. The improvements include 7,500 new tools and equipment, 400 improved work instructions, and 300 hours of employee training material, the company said. Boeing says it is increasing employee coaching and eliminated some responsibilities so that managers can spend more time supervising employees on the factory floor. \u201cMany of these actions are underway and our team is committed to executing on each element of the plan,\u201d Calhoun said. His deputy who oversees the commercial airplane program, Stephanie Pope, urged employees in a company email today to \u201ccontinue to Speak Up\u201d on safety issues.\u00a0That company has said an earlier request for feedback drove a five-fold increase in reports, and some of those are reflected in the new plan. \u201cWe will succeed as a team and execute with safety, quality, and compliance in everything we do,\u201d wrote Pope, the CEO of Boeing Commercial Airplanes. Boeing says it will prevent safety lapses on its 737 assembly line by preventing planes under production from moving to the next station until all previous work is complete. The so-called \u201cMove Ready\u201d change is procedural but addresses an important concern of the Federal Aviation Administration:\u00a0That basic factory procedures were falling apart. The company has also identified the number of jobs left incomplete when a plane moves to the next station as one of six key numbers it will watch to determine if the remediation plan is working. The change is described in an 11-page executive summary of Boeing\u2019s plan to fix quality and safety issues that the company presented on Thursday to the Federal Aviation Administration. Turbulent year for Boeing Boeing has seen a string of bad news this year, from a mid-air fuselage blowout in January to probes from regulators to a report faulting Boeing for major quality issues. The new report is meant to show that the company \u2013 and Calhoun \u2013 can turn around what was once an international hallmark of manufacturing quality. Boeing\u2019s plan could also shed new light on the findings of FAA inspectors at Boeing\u2019s Renton, Washington, facility that builds the 737 Max, as well as the Wichita, Kansas, plant of key supplier Spirit AeroSystems. The FAA provided the findings to both companies but shielded the report from public view and has so far declined CNN requests for a copy. Neither the FAA nor Boeing has made public the actual plan.\u00a0Whitaker said the plan is Boeing\u2019s, and it can decide how to publicize it. The plan is seen as a crucial step to rebuilding the safety culture and practices of the nation\u2019s single largest exporter. Boeing has begun implementing changes within its production process that it says will produce safer airplanes. The changes include clearer instructions for the assembly line, training improvements and more tools.\u00a0The company says it has also ordered each station be completed before a plane moves on the assembly line and directed Spirit to not ship defective fuselages to Boeing\u2019s Renton plant. Whitaker ordered the plan from Boeing after reviewing the findings of FAA auditors who visited the company\u2019s 737 Max assembly line.\u00a0The auditors were deployed in response to the January 5 door plug blowout on Alaska Airlines flight 1282, a months-old Max.\u00a0The National Transportation Safety Board believes Boeing delivered the plane to the airline without critical bolts that hold the door plug in place, and Calhoun admitted to a \u201cquality escape.\u201d After the blowout, the FAA grounded Max 9s for three weeks and ordered inspections of each door plug. It was the second grounding since the first 737 Max delivery in 2017. The Max 8 spent 20 months grounded after crashes in 2018 and 2019 that killed 346 people. The plan may be one of Boeing\u2019s last major milestones under Calhoun, who announced in the wake of the blowout he would join other senior managers in leaving the company this year.\u00a0The corporate board has a search underway for a new chief executive. A previous safety culture review \u2013 including FAA and outside experts \u2013 was broader than the Max assembly line and found a \u201cdisconnect between Boeing\u2019s senior management and other members of the organization on safety culture.\u201d\u00a0The timing could not have been worse for the company:\u00a0The panel was wrapping up its work around the time of the door plug blowout and it landed on desks at the FAA at the same time as the initial production line audit results.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/30/business/boeing-safety-plan-faa/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/31/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "politics_trump-trial-election-calendar-dg", "text": "Donald Trump is juggling a busy court and campaign schedule as he defends himself in several criminal cases while also vying for a second term in the White House. The jury in Trump\u2019s New York hush money trial found the former president guilty on all 34 felony counts. The charges stem from his alleged falsification of business records\u202fwith the intent to conceal illegal conduct connected to his 2016 presidential campaign. Judge Juan Merchan set a sentencing hearing for July 11, a week before the Republican National Convention. The trial start date in Trump\u2019s classified documents case in Florida had been set for late May, but the judge overseeing that case said on May 7 that the trial is \u201cindefinitely postponed.\u201d The trial date in the Fulton County election subversion case is not yet set. That trial is also in limbo while Trump and several of his co-defendants try to disqualify the Atlanta-area district attorney who brought the charges. The Georgia Court of Appeals said on May 8 it will consider this effort. The judge overseeing Trump\u2019s federal election subversion case scrapped the previously set March 4 trial start date while Trump\u2019s claims of presidential immunity were being weighed by an appeals court. The Supreme Court has now taken up the issue, and the trial remains on hold pending the high court\u2019s resolution of Trump\u2019s claims. The justices could rule on the case before their term ends in June. Meanwhile, Trump clinched the Republican nomination for president in March, and by the time the Republican National Convention rolls around in mid-July, voters and Trump will likely know the former president\u2019s fate in at least one of these four criminal cases.", "source": "http://cnn.com/politics/trump-trial-election-calendar-dg/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/31/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_05_30_economy_us-economic-data-report-inflation", "text": "US economic data released Thursday was broadly disappointing. America\u2019s economy expanded at a weaker pace earlier this year than initially reported. The decline in home sales based on contract signings last month was much steeper than economists expected. And mortgage rates inched higher this week, thrusting the average rate back above the psychological 7% threshold. Treasury yields slipped after the release of the government\u2019s latest measure of economic growth in the first quarter, which also showed that consumer spending was softer than previously estimated. The benchmark 10-year US Treasury yield slid below 4.6%. Thursday\u2019s batch of economic figures shows that the economy isn\u2019t heating back up and has instead struggled under the weight of the highest interest rates in more than two decades. And while Thursday\u2019s indicators point to some economic pressure being felt by American consumers, it also bodes well for an eventual lowering of high borrowing costs. This silver lining is especially important after the slowdown in inflation stalled in the first quarter. Signs of inflation being stuck raised fears that the Federal Reserve could hike rates again this year or not cut them at all. Now, the possibility of rate cuts happening sometime in 2024 is back in the conversation. And\u00a0the\u00a0latest GDP data also showed that inflation in the first quarter was revised lower, including a measure that excludes volatile food and energy prices. That also helps strengthen the case for rate cuts. \u201cMonthly data beyond March generally point to a continued, albeit gently cooling, economic expansion,\u201d Oren Klachkin, financial markets economist at Nationwide, said in a note Thursday. \u201cSome warning signs regarding the economic outlook are visible beneath the surface, but nothing that makes us pessimistic about the road ahead.\u201d Economic growth The Commerce Department\u2019s second estimate of first-quarter gross domestic product, which measures all the services and goods produced in the economy, registered at a 1.3% annualized rate, down from the 1.6% reflected in the first estimate. That was largely due to a downward revision to consumer spending, which accounts for about 70% of the US economy. Spending advanced 2% in the January-through-March period, compared to the initial rate of 2.5%. The latest GDP report also showed that corporate profits, before taxes, fell 0.6% in the first quarter, the first decline in a year and down sharply from the 4.1% increase in the prior three-month period. Still, while most corporate earnings results this quarter proved decent, companies indicated it\u2019s become increasingly difficult for them to pass on costs to consumers. Housing Housing data released Thursday mostly showed that the market remains tough, especially for first-time buyers. The standard 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 7.02% this week, up slightly from last week\u2019s average of 6.94%, according to Freddie Mac data. Mortgage rates are higher than anything seen in the decade leading up to 2022, when the Fed began to hike rates in a bid to tame inflation. They\u2019re not expected to fall meaningfully anytime this year because inflation is still stubbornly elevated. So long as this remains the case, the Fed isn\u2019t likely to reduce rates by much in 2024 \u2014 at least not enough to give Americans a break. The Fed doesn\u2019t directly set mortgage rates, but its actions, which influence yields, do. Mortgage rates track the 10-year yield. Pending home sales slumped 7.7% in April to a reading of 72.3, the lowest level in four years, according to data from the National Association of Realtors released Thursday. Despite some welcome improvement in housing supply over the past few months, tough borrowing costs are spooking buyers and keeping the country\u2019s housing market frozen. \u201cThe impact of escalating interest rates throughout April dampened home buying, even with more inventory in the market,\u201d Lawrence Yun, NAR\u2019s chief economist, said in a statement. \u201cBut the Federal Reserve\u2019s anticipated rate cut later this year should lead to better conditions, with improved affordability and more supply.\u201d Jobs Weekly data on applications for jobless benefits, released every Thursday and often seen as the earliest sign of any shift in the job market, hasn\u2019t been concerning, but they\u2019ve been trending higher over the past few weeks. There were 219,000 first-time claims filed during the week ended May 25, according to Labor Department data released Thursday. Last week\u2019s filings were up by 3,000 from the upwardly revised tally the week before but were mostly in line with economists\u2019 forecasts. Economists were expecting 218,000 initial claims, according to FactSet consensus estimates. Continuing claims ticked higher by 4,000 to 1.791 million for the week ended May 18. The four-week average of 222,500 is the highest since mid-September of last year. Weekly jobless claims data, considered a proxy for layoff activity, can be highly volatile and is frequently revised. The Dow closed 331 points lower, or 0.9%. The S&P 500 was down 0.6% and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 1.1% Thursday.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/30/economy/us-economic-data-report-inflation/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/31/2024", "section": "us"}}

Trump, while lambasting the\u00a0prosecution in his New York hush money criminal trial\u00a0as a \u201cdisgrace,\u201d similarly pointed to this fall\u2019s presidential election. \u201cThe real verdict is going to be November 5 by the people. And they know what happened here, and everybody knows what happened here,\u201d Trump told reporters outside the\u00a0Manhattan\u00a0courtroom. News of Trump\u2019s conviction on 34 felony charges of falsifying business records, sent shockwaves through campaigns up and down the ballot. Republican candidates in races for governor, Senate and House largely aligned themselves with Trump, while Democrats largely avoided the specifics of the case but said justice had prevailed. The former president\u2019s allies on Capitol Hill were quick to rally around him, with top Republicans attacking the justice system in the wake of the verdict \u2013 while also highlighting the importance of the\u00a02024\u00a0election and making fundraising appeals of their own. House Speaker Mike Johnson decried what he described as \u201cthe weaponization of our justice system,\u201d\u00a0saying in a statement, \u201cPresident Trump will rightfully appeal this absurd verdict \u2014 and he WILL WIN.\u201d House Majority Leader Steve Scalise wrote on\u00a0social media, \u201cI won\u2019t stand by while the leader of our party is ambushed by our own government. Will you stand with Trump before midnight tonight and condemn this witch hunt once and for all?\u201d\u00a0The Louisiana Republican\u00a0included a link to a fundraising site. New York\u00a0Rep. Elise Stefanik, the House GOP\u00a0Conference\u00a0chair\u00a0and a potential Trump running mate pick, slammed what she referred to as a\u00a0\u201csham trial.\u201d \u201cWe must redouble our efforts and work around the clock to ensure President Trump is victorious this November to save America from Biden\u2019s failed Far Left Democrat agenda,\u201d\u00a0she said in a statement. Senate GOP candidates back Trump Republican Senate candidates also quickly sided with the former president. Tim Sheehy,\u00a0who is\u00a0challenging Democratic Sen. Jon Tester in Montana, issued a statement declaring the verdict \u201cRIGGED\u201d and called\u00a0the case\u00a0\u201cstate-sponsored political persecution.\u201d Kari Lake, the Republican poised to face Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego in Arizona\u2019s Senate race, said Americans had \u201cjust witnessed the most egregious example of election interference and an outright mockery of the rule of law in the 246-year history of our Republic. This entire process right down to the verdict itself has been nothing but a shameful political stunt.\u201d \u201cThis is a terrible day for America and for trust in our justice system,\u201d said\u00a0Pennsylvania\u00a0Republican Dave McCormick, who is challenging Democratic Sen. Bob Casey. \u201cThis case should never have been brought in the first place, and this miscarriage of justice is despicable.\u201d Democrats, meanwhile, offered more muted reactions \u2014 and many didn\u2019t comment at all in the immediate aftermath of the verdict. \u201cI respect our justice system and the rule of law. The process played out, and we should always demand accountability from our elected leaders,\u201d Gallego\u00a0said on\u00a0social media. And some anti-Trump Republicans kept their distance from the former president Thursday. When news broke that the jury had reached a verdict, Maryland Senate candidate Larry Hogan, who\u2019s been critical of Trump, called for Americans to \u201crespect the verdict and the legal process.\u201d \u201cAt this dangerously divided moment in our history, all leaders \u2013 regardless of party \u2013 must not pour fuel on the fire with more toxic partisanship,\u201d the former Maryland governor said\u00a0on social media. That post elicited a terse response later from Trump senior adviser Chris LaCivita: \u201cYou just ended your campaign.\u201d Presidential rivals\u2019 reactions Not only is Trump the first former president to be found guilty of a felony, he\u2019s also the first major-party presidential nominee to be convicted of a crime in the\u00a0middle\u00a0of a campaign for the White House. If he defeats Biden in November,\u00a0Trump would\u00a0be the first sitting president in history to be a convicted felon. The Biden campaign said in a statement\u00a0that\u00a0the verdict in New York showed\u00a0that\u00a0\u201cno one is above the law.\u201d \u201cThe threat Trump poses to our democracy has never been greater. He is running an increasingly unhinged campaign of revenge and retribution,\u201d\u00a0campaign spokesman Michael Tyler\u00a0said.\u00a0\u201cA second Trump term means chaos, ripping away Americans\u2019 freedoms and fomenting political violence \u2013 and the American people will reject it this November.\u201d The Biden campaign also sent a text message to supporters warning that Trump was likely \u201csetting fundraising records\u201d following Thursday\u2019s verdict. Independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who learned of the verdict while speaking with reporters ahead of his appearance at a cryptocurrency convention in Austin, Texas, dismissed the importance of the case. \u201cI\u2019ve been disciplined about not commenting on the court cases and talking about issues that I think are of deep concern to Americans, and not the issues that, you know, are being used to divide us, the culture war issues. I\u2019m not going to comment on it,\u201d Kennedy said. This story has been updated with additional information.

{"id": "2024_05_27_us_hot-dogs-american-favorite-ijgdi-cec", "text": "It\u2019s Memorial Day weekend, the unofficial kickoff of summer in the US, which means Americans are practically required under federal law to gather friends and family, fire up the grill and cook something. For many people, that means scarfing down some hot dogs. I will not be one of those people. In the vast smorgasbord of festive foods, hot dogs have never done it for me. I\u2019m not a vegetarian or a picky eater, and I\u2019m not on some nitrates-free health kick. I just don\u2019t care for them. During peak hot dog season, from Memorial Day to Labor Day, Americans consume an estimated 7 billion hot dogs. That makes me a statistical outlier at best, and at worst, maybe a traitor. Who doesn\u2019t like hot dogs? It\u2019s almost un-American, like disliking football or Dolly Parton. I pass no judgment on hot dog lovers, and I understand the appeal. Hot dogs are cheap, easy to cook, portable and endlessly customizable. They\u2019re the perfect outdoor food accessory: Grab a hot dog in one hand, and you still have another hand free for a cold beverage of your choice. At the famous annual Nathan\u2019s Hot Dog Eating Contest, perennial champ Joey Chestnut once snarfed down 75 of them in 10 minutes. I watched this on TV, and it was a little traumatic. This dislike may have deep roots in my childhood. My mother tells me that when I was about a year old, she cut up a hot dog and put the bite-size pieces on my high chair tray, within reach of my grubby little fingers. I popped one in my mouth and immediately began choking. She held me upside down and shook me until I coughed it up. From then on, my mother says I refused to eat hot dogs. I wasn\u2019t a fussy kid \u2014 I\u2019d heartily gobble up all kinds of vegetables (except for beets, which I didn\u2019t learn to appreciate until deep into adulthood). But hot dogs were a no go. Maybe I had some residual hot dog trauma. As an older kid, I no longer had to suffer through hot dogs at home. But out in the world, it was a different story. At friends\u2019 birthday parties, the parents often served hot dogs, and I didn\u2019t want to be the weird kid sitting there with a few chips on an otherwise empty paper plate. I found that if I drenched a hot dog in enough ketchup, mustard and relish, I could force it down and then turn my eager attention to the birthday cake. Baseball games were another problem. I love baseball, for all the old-timey reasons: Its leisurely rhythms, the surge of the crowd on a ball hit to the warning track, that exhilarating first glimpse of the field when you emerge from the ballpark tunnel. But back in the \u201870s, when I was young, ballparks didn\u2019t offer a vast array of food options. Boston\u2019s Fenway Park, where I saw many of my earliest baseball games, had vendors going up and down the aisles yelling \u201cFenway Franks! Get ya Fenway Franks heeaaah!\u201d Their sales pitches didn\u2019t sway me, but they also sold roasted peanuts. I ate a lot of peanuts. Right about now you might be thinking, \u201cWhy should I care if some guy at CNN doesn\u2019t like hot dogs?\u201d It\u2019s a fair question. But ask yourself: Have you ever disliked something that almost everyone else seems to enjoy? It feels a little lonely. It also can make you question your judgment. Everyone else I knew loved hot dogs \u2014 what was wrong with me? In such existential moments, you\u2019re faced with a choice: You can pretend to like the thing, and feel sort of phony. Or, while everyone else is zigging, you can embrace your zag. Admittedly, hot dogs are low stakes. It\u2019s another thing entirely to announce you don\u2019t like democracy, or true love, or grandmothers. Or maybe pizza. And yet for years, to avoid awkward questions, I hid my distaste. By the time I was in college, I decided to speak my truth. This didn\u2019t always go well. The summer I turned 18, I shared a beach house with three buddies, including two brothers whose mom paid us a visit one weekend and offered to make us lunch. When I learned what was on the menu I exclaimed, \u201cHot dogs? I hate hot dogs!\u201d just as their mother emerged from the kitchen with a steaming plate of franks. She shot me a look. Being the gracious charmer I was, I ate my dog in abashed silence. In case you\u2019re wondering, I have no issues with the many cousins of the humble hot dog. I will happily eat Italian sausages, andouille sausages and chorizo, which to me have more flavor and heft. Bratwurst are fine if slathered in spicy mustard. But by my twenties I\u2019d pretty much stopped eating hot dogs. I just couldn\u2019t get past how they tasted to me:\u00a0 sweaty and sour and vaguely curdled. Now here we are in 2024, and hot dogs \u2014 despite nutritional warnings that eating one could take 36 minutes off your life \u2014 seem as popular as ever. There are plant-based versions, which probably taste even more horrifying. People are having viral debates about whether or not a hot dog is a sandwich. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m allowed to answer that question. When I sat down to write this, it occurred to me that I hadn\u2019t eaten a hot dog in at least several decades. My personal experience with hot dogs was a little out of date. Maybe my taste buds had evolved? There was only one thing to do. In the interest of research, my girlfriend\u2019s dad helped me procure an eight-pack of all-beef franks and some Walmart hot dog buns. Nothing fancy. My girlfriend, her parents and I cooked the dogs up in a hot skillet, plopped them in the buns and squirted them with ketchup and yellow mustard. I took a bite. My three lunchtime companions all stared at me, curious to gauge my reaction. The verdict? Meh. The hot dog was not as terrible as I remembered. But it wasn\u2019t exactly tasty, either. The aftertaste lingered in my mouth like a bad houseguest. I tried my best, and I\u2019m ok with that. Don\u2019t hate me. So on this Memorial Day, I wish all hot dog lovers out there a frankly delicious holiday. Because of oddballs like me, there will be more hot dogs to go around for the rest of you.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/27/us/hot-dogs-american-favorite-ijgdi-cec/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/31/2024", "section": "us"}}

The Dow has fallen by around 1,000 points over the last three days alone \u2014 and the negative momentum didn\u2019t let up Thursday. The Dow closed 331 points lower, or 0.9%. The S&P 500 was down 0.6% and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 1.1% as lackluster earnings results from Salesforce (CRM) worried investors. Shares of the customer relationship management company fell 19.7% after it reported a revenue miss and lowered expectations for the year ahead, notching its worst day in two decades. That comes after a bad Wednesday for the broader market, with all 11 sectors of the S&P 500 closing lower. The Dow fell by more than 300 points, driven largely by a tick down of shares of chipmaking giant Nvidia (NVDA), pulling large tech stocks down along with it. This week\u2019s downturn has been fueled by a range of factors, including earnings and stronger-than-expected economic data. Bonds have taken a particular hit as concerns about inflation mount and after a weak Treasury auction on Wednesday. The 10-year Treasury yield climbed to its highest level since late April. Robust economic data has also spooked investors, who worry that signs of a stronger economy could push the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates higher for longer as it battles to bring down inflation. The S&P 500 has finished higher for 23 of the last 30 weeks, marking a joint record since 1989, but it\u2019s now tracking toward a negative week. \u201cThere had already been a relentless run of gains in recent weeks that was always going to be tough to maintain,\u201d wrote Deutsche Bank analysts on Thursday. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that the momentum is now more negative.\u201d New economic data on Thursday showed that US gross domestic product in the first quarter was revised lower (1.3% from 1.6%) and that personal consumption is slowing. That\u2019s a sign that economic expansion is cooling \u2014 which some analysts view as a double-edged sword. The data \u201ccould be a concern for companies and stock market investors, but on the other hand, slowing consumption and economic growth could be just the news we need to see in order for the rate of inflation to keep coming down and allow the Fed to reduce interest rates after all,\u201d wrote Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Independent Advisor Alliance, on Thursday.

{"id": "2024_05_29_us_giant-pandas-return-to-national-zoo", "text": "Two new giant pandas will be arriving at the Smithsonian\u2019s National Zoo in Washington, DC, this year, the zoo announced Wednesday. The bears, named\u00a0Qing Bao\u00a0and\u00a0Bao Li, a pair of 2-year-old black-and-white animals,\u00a0will arrive by the end of 2024 through a partnership with the China Wildlife Conservation Association, the zoo said. In a\u00a0video announcement featuring first lady Jill Biden\u00a0planning a \u201cblack tie,\u201d vegetarian dinner for the iconic bears, the zoo celebrated the news. \u201cI\u2019m so proud to say that this long-standing program and this collaboration with our Chinese colleagues is one of the reasons why giant pandas are no longer listed as endangered, but rather only vulnerable on the global list of species at risk of extinction,\u201d Brandie Smith, director of the zoo\u2019s Conservation Biology Institute, told reporters Wednesday. The institute is seeking $25 million in public and corporate donations\u00a0to support the pandas over the next 10 years. Chinese ambassador Xie Feng touted the journey of the \u201cnewest envoys of friendship\u201d as a symbol of the deepening of \u201cfriendly ties\u201d between the US and China. \u201cChina and the United States should choose to be partners, not rivals,\u201d Feng said. \u201cPanda huggers should not be stigmatized. If there should be any protectionism, then let us protect biodiversity; protect the only home for the entire humanity; protect stable, sound and sustainable China-US relations and protect a better future for the younger generations.\u201d Bao Li has ties to Washington: His mother, Bao Bao, was born at the zoo in 2013 and his grandparents, Tian Tian and Mei Xiang, left an unbearable panda-shaped hole in DC residents\u2019 hearts last year when they bid farewell to the zoo. Last year, the Smithsonian\u2019s three giant pandas \u2013 Tian Tian, Mei Xiang and their youngest cub, Xiao Qi Ji \u2013\u00a0departed the National Zoo, prompting concerns that the 50-year history of the bears being housed in the US capital could be coming to an end. At the time, Smithsonian staff called the departure a \u201chiatus,\u201d but Chinese officials had yet to clarify the future of the program. In a meeting with American business leaders last November in San Francisco, Chinese President Xi Jinping\u00a0suggested China might renew the panda exchange with the United States, calling them \u201cenvoys of friendship between the Chinese and American peoples,\u201d during a visit largely aimed at easing fraught ties between the two powers. \u201cWe are ready to continue our cooperation with the United States on panda conservation and do our best to meet the wishes of the Californians so as to deepen the friendly ties between our two peoples,\u201d Xi said at the time. The return of the bamboo-loving bears may mark a new chapter of decades of \u201cpanda diplomacy.\u201d With tensions rising in the Indo-Pacific \u2013\u00a0notably following large-scale joint Chinese military drills\u00a0around Taiwan following the inauguration of the island\u2019s new president \u2013 the relationship between the US and China hangs in a precarious balance. Zoo Atlanta\u2019s four iconic pandas will depart for China\u00a0later this year, as the zoo\u2019s agreement with China is set to expire in late 2024. Their journey follows the departure of pandas from the San Diego and Memphis zoos. More pandas are set to arrive in other parts of the country, as well. In April, it was announced China would send giant pandas to San Francisco\u2019s zoo for the first time, and the San Diego Zoo announced in February it would welcome two new black-and-white residents.

{"id": "2024_05_30_business_jeep-reveals-its-first-american-ev", "text": "Jeep, widely known for making rugged off-road vehicles, has unveiled its first fully electric SUV for the North American market. Jeep already offers the small Avenger EV in Europe but the Wagnoneer S, unveiled Thursday night, will be available in the US and Canada later this year before being sold in other markets, becoming Jeep\u2019s first \u201cglobal\u201d EV. The Wagoneer S will test the appetite of Jeep customers for a fully electric model. It comes at a time of waning interest in electric vehicles, even as regulatory requirements for them become more stringent. The new SUV embodies Jeep parent company Stellantis\u2019s flexible strategy toward developing and building EVs. New Stellantis vehicles are designed so the same basic engineering can be used to build gas-powered, plug-in hybrid or fully electric models, allowing the automaker to pivot quickly to meet market demand, executives have said. Jeep chief executive Antonio Filosa did not rule out a possible future plug-in hybrid versions of the Wagoneer S with technology similar to the Ram Ramcharger pickup if the company sees demand. Unlike most plug-in hybrids, the Ramcharger is capable of driving a long way on electricity only before running on a gas-powered engine. For now, that\u2019s not planned, though. The new Wagoneer S has a sleeker, more aerodynamic shape than the Jeep Wagoneer models sold today. The SUV will produce up to 600 horsepower from two electric motors and will be able to accelerate to 60 miles an hour in just 3.4 seconds, Stellantis announced. It will also be able to drive more than 300 miles on a fully charged battery pack before needing to recharge, according to Stellantis. While off-road capability is a core part of Jeep\u2019s brand image, Stellantis did not boast of off-road capability in its unveiling of the Wagoneer S. But the company revealed a concept version called the Wagoneer S Trailhawk, with large off-road tires and raised suspension, alongside the planned production model. Jeep is working on putting the Wagoneer S Trailhawk into production, Filosa said in an interview with CNN. \u201cThat will be in the range with the most capable Jeep that we have out there,\u201d he said. Jeep\u2019s product plans already include a rugged off-road capable EV called the Recon which will be available early next year. In part due to environmental concerns, the Wagoneer S will not have wood or leather inside and no chrome on the exterior. It will be the first model in Stellantis\u2019s move away from using chrome on its vehicles, Gilles said, because of concerns over the chemicals used in its production. \u201cStellantis is going to back out of chrome over time,\u201d said Gilles. \u201cHexavalent chrome, we know, is not the most amazing thing for the planet, so as we go we\u2019re going to be killing it off.\u201d In place of leather inside the vehicle will be synthetic materials that, Gilles promised, will have the feel of actual leather. Since Jeep\u2019s trademark seven-slot grille isn\u2019t needed to cool a gas engine, it will light up instead to illuminate a walking path toward the SUV at night. Drivers can select from five \u201cdrive modes \u201d \u2014 Auto, Sport, Eco, Snow, and Sand \u2014 that will automatically adjust things like power output to individual wheels and the response of traction control systems. The Wagoneer S will go on sale later this year at a starting price of around $72,000 for well-equipped \u201cLaunch Edition\u201d models. Less expensive and more expensive versions, as well, could become available later, executives said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/30/business/jeep-reveals-its-first-american-ev/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/31/2024", "section": "us"}}

The jury might still be deliberating, but Donald Trump\u2019s media allies have already delivered a verdict to their audiences Throughout the duration of the Manhattan hush-money trial, Fox News and the rest of MAGA Media have set the stage to absolve Trump in the historic case. Day after day, week after week, popular personalities such as Sean Hannity, Laura Ingraham, and Steve Bannon have lampooned the judicial system, portraying Trump as an innocent victim of political persecution. Inside this alternate media universe, the actual facts of the case never penetrate the bubble that shields its audiences from detrimental developments for Trump. Instead, alternate dishonest storylines are disseminated as the gospel truth. Not only is Trump entirely innocent of any and all wrongdoing in the MAGA Media world, but President Joe Biden is guilty of nefariously weaponizing government to wage \u201clawfare\u201d on his political opponent. Audiences are told that Biden cannot win a fair fight with Trump, so he has resorted to illegal \u201celection interference\u201d by rigging the judicial system against Trump. It goes without saying that these narratives are built on foundations of lies and innuendo that do not hold water. Biden does not control the judicial system. The hush-money case is taking place in New York state court with charges brought by the Manhattan district attorney. And it isn\u2019t Trump\u2019s left-wing enemies who have been making headlines testifying against the GOP candidate in the case, it\u2019s his former allies, such as one-time fixer Michael Cohen and former National Enquirer boss David Pecker. Nevertheless, millions consuming right-wing media have been fed these deceptive storylines, impacting how voters perceive current events and, more importantly, cast their ballots. In the Republican Party, voters absorb their information from outlets like Fox News, which has dishonestly run defense for Trump over the course of the trial. \u201cWHERE\u2019S THE CRIME?\u201d demanded a banner on Ingraham\u2019s prime time show Wednesday along with a graphic showing images of Biden, Judge Juan Merchan, and Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg \u201cTHE REAL FRAUDS.\u201d In the following hour, Jesse Watters accused Merchan in an on-screen graphic of \u201cLEADING THE JURY\u201d and intimated how \u201cvery fishy\u201d it was that a \u201cstop Trump\u201d judge was selected to preside over the case. The progressive Media Matters said in a study published this week that Fox News has leveled at least 200 attacks on Merchan alone since the trial commenced \u2014 a staggering number that does not include the attacks on others associated with the case. And the study only accounted for Fox News, not the host of other entities that make up the right-wing media universe. It can be tempting to ignore the torrent of attacks Trump\u2019s media allies are launching in their unrelenting efforts to undermine the case. But those forces are shaping how a large swath of the country understands the high-stakes and unprecedented trial taking place in lower Manhattan. And they\u2019re a reminder that if Trump were to return to power, he has a powerful propaganda apparatus at his disposal that will do everything in its power to sanitize his actions \u2014 whatever they may be.", "source": "http://cnn.com/business/media/fox-news-right-wing-media-trump-trial-verdict/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/31/2024", "section": "us"}}

The four inmates, all held in connection with violent crimes, escaped from the Tangipahoa Parish Jail north of New Orleans, according to a Facebook post from Sheriff Daniel Edwards. Two were taken into custody Monday morning. The sheriff\u2019s office identified the two inmates still at large as Omarion Hookfin, 19, and Jamarcus Cyprian, 20. \u201cWe feel that they\u2019re no longer in Tangipahoa Parish,\u201d Tangipahoa Parish Sheriff\u2019s Office Chief of Operations Jimmy Travis said Monday. He added anyone who assisted the escapees in leaving the area would also face charges. Authorities believe two inmates left the facility in southeastern Louisiana\u2019s Amite City Saturday afternoon and the other two left Sunday afternoon, Travis said at a news conference. The sheriff\u2019s office did not learn the inmates had escaped until Sunday afternoon, when a \u201cconcerned citizen\u201d contacted the warden and reported two of the escapees had come to a relative\u2019s house looking for a \u201cplace to stay,\u201d Jail administrators then realized a total of four inmates were missing. \u201cThe four inmates were able to escape the perimeter fence of the Parish Jail while participating in their recreation time on the yard,\u201d the sheriff said. A section of the fence was found in an inspection to be \u201cvulnerable and easily maneuvered\u201d\u00a0as to allow \u201ca small statured body\u201d to slide through, the Facebook post said. The two captured inmates, Avery Guidry, 19, and Travon Johnson, 21, were found hiding in the dumpster Monday morning, the sheriff\u2019s office reported. They were unarmed when found, Travis said. Hookfin, Guidry and Johnson were charged in connection to a 2022 home invasion that left a man dead and his 12-year-old daughter injured, CNN affiliate\u00a0WDSU reported. They were awaiting trial. Cyprian was \u201cserving time for armed robbery and weapon charges,\u201d the sheriff said. It is \u201cvery concerning\u201d authorities did not realize the inmates were missing until someone reached out, Travis said. \u201cIf the proper headcounts had been conducted, we would have known about it immediately.\u201d Travis said \u201clack of correctional supervision\u201d as well as corroded wire in a perimeter fence made the escapes possible. \u201cWe\u2019re short-staffed \u2013 it\u2019s no excuse \u2013 but we\u2019re short-staffed,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s a failure.

{"id": "2024_05_30_us_kohberger-idaho-killings-pretrial-hearings", "text": "After yet another pre-trial hearing in Bryan Kohberger\u2019s quadruple murder trial in early May, the family of one of the victims openly criticized the slow pace of the proceedings. \u201cThis case is turning into a hamster wheel of motions, hearings, and delayed decisions,\u201d the \u201cincredibly frustrated\u201d family of slain University of Idaho student Kaylee Goncalves said in a statement. The criticism stemmed from the long and winding road ever since four University of Idaho students \u2013 Goncalves, Ethan Chapin, Xana Kernodle and Madison Mogen \u2013 were fatally stabbed in the overnight hours of November 13, 2022, at a home just off the school\u2019s main campus in Moscow. Kohberger, a Washington State University graduate student in criminology, was arrested in the killings on December 30, 2022, in his home state of Pennsylvania. A\u00a0not guilty plea was entered on his behalf one year ago this month, and his\u00a0attorneys have indicated the 29-year-old intends to present an alibi as part of his defense. Prosecutors have said they will seek the death penalty. The progression of the case has been slowed by a series of pre-trial motions and hearings, and a trial date still has not been set. Latah County Judge John Judge said in April he wants a \u201chearing at least every month,\u201d noting the importance of \u201ccleaning up\u201d the legal proceedings. The hearings largely fall into a few different buckets. One relates to the defense attorneys\u2019 access to evidence, particularly how the prosecution used investigative genetic genealogy in building the case. A second set of hearings concerns Kohberger\u2019s proposed alibi for his innocence. Third, there have be a number of hearings related to a gag order that restricts what the parties can publicly say about the case. Here\u2019s a timeline of some of the notable pre-trial hearings and decisions so far: June 9, 2023: A coalition of media organizations and the family of a murder victim came to court to challenge the gag order placed on the parties in the case. June 23, 2023: The judge denied both requests but issued a revised gag order that allows the parties to discuss topics that do not have a \u201csubstantial likelihood of materially prejudicing or otherwise influencing the outcome of the case.\u201d August 2, 2023: Kohberger\u2019s attorneys said they would\u00a0use an alibi defense but couldn\u2019t pin down their client\u2019s specific location on the night of the killings because he was \u201cdriving during the late night and early morning hours.\u201d \u201cMr.\u00a0Kohberger\u00a0is not claiming to be at a specific location at a specific time; at this time there is not a specific witness to say precisely where Mr.\u00a0Kohberger\u00a0was at each moment of the hours\u201d of the attacks, his attorneys said in a court filing. October 26, 2023: The judge denied a\u00a0request to dismiss the grand jury indictment after the defense argued there was an error in the grand jury instructions. December 18, 2023: The judge denied a second motion to dismiss the indictment after the defense argued prosecutors failed to comply fully with state rules on jury selection and the jury questionnaire. February 28, 2024: Defense attorney Anne C. Taylor asked the court to allow three defense experts and others to view the investigative genetic genealogy evidence, which has been sealed, to understand the full timeline of how police began to focus on Kohberger. Genetic genealogy is a practice that blends DNA analysis in the lab with genealogical research, such as tracing a person\u2019s family tree. In this case, investigators found a single source of male DNA on the button snap of a leather knife sheath left at the crime scene,\u00a0according to a probable cause affidavit. FBI investigators loaded the DNA profile to public genealogy sites to search for a match and then sent a tip to investigate Kohberger, according to a prosecution court filing. The judge declined to give the defense investigators extended access to the investigative genetic genealogy, saying he would rather the experts already approved to view the material give justification for digging deeper. April 4, 2024: The judge criticized Kohberger\u2019s defense attorney, saying she commissioned phone surveys to potential jurors that could hinder Kohberger\u2019s ability to get a fair trial. However, Taylor said the judge violated her client\u2019s right to due process by ordering a stop to the anonymous survey without hearing the defense\u2019s side first. April 17, 2024: Kohberger\u2019s defense lawyers filed a court document saying they plan\u00a0to offer a cell phone tower and radio frequency expert to partially corroborate\u00a0his proposed alibi that he was out driving west of Moscow\u00a0on the night of the slayings. April 19, 2024: The judge allowed surveys conducted with potential jurors to continue \u201cwithout modification\u201d after temporarily pausing them. April 29, 2024: The prosecution asked the court to deny Kohberger the opportunity to add to his alibi and to preclude anyone other than the defendant to testify as to his whereabouts on the night of the murders. May 2, 2024: Kohberger\u2019s defense had asked for an upcoming evidentiary hearing with witnesses be made public, while the prosecution asked that it be sealed. The judge ruled that it will be closed to the public. May 23, 2024: Taylor, the defense attorney, questioned a Moscow police detective about the preparation of visual cell phone logs and methods for searching for certain videos. The testimony was related to two motions to compel prosecutors to share discovery with the defense, but the contents of the motions are sealed, so it was not clear what they were requesting. May 30, 2024: The Moscow police detective leading the investigation and a defense expert in cell phone location data testified that the defense has not received some key evidence in the case. Cpl. Brett Payne, the lead investigator on the case, testified he and other investigators collected thousands of hours of video surveillance as they tried to locate a white Hyundai Elantra connected to the suspect. The videos are saved on various thumb drives, but there is no central inventory of the videos, he testified. He also said investigators did not see on any of the videos the Elantra going south from Moscow toward Pullman, Washington, in the early morning hours after the killings. The probable cause affidavit used in the case alleges Kohberger drove south toward Pullman after he committed the four killings. Sy Ray, an expert on cell phone geolocation data, testified that he has not been provided the underlying AT&T source data and list of nearby cell towers that was used by detectives to create a map of Kohberger\u2019s movements with his cell phone. Based on the data he had received, he believed some statements in the records were not accurate, and he said the missing data could be helpful to the defense. \u201cBecause of the piecemealing of the data, because of the missing data, because of data that I\u2019m reviewing that is incredibly inaccurate, everything that is missing is absolutely to the benefit of the defense right now,\u201d he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/30/us/kohberger-idaho-killings-pretrial-hearings/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/31/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_05_29_us_harvey-weinstein-ny-court-appearance", "text": "A Manhattan prosecutor said Wednesday a new indictment against Harvey Weinstein is possible as additional accusers have come forward with claims against the powerful Hollywood producer whose downfall became a symbol of the #MeToo movement. Assistant District Attorney Nicole Blumberg told Manhattan Supreme Court Justice Curtis Farber that prosecutors are \u201cactively investigating\u201d the claims by the new accusers and that \u201cnot all are ready to speak out.\u201d When the judge asked if there was a possibility of a new indictment against Weinstein, Blumberg said, \u201cYes, your honor.\u201d Prosecutors are assessing which claims fall under the statute of limitations, Blumberg said. \u201cWe need the survivors\u2019 identities protected,\u201d Blumberg told the court. \u201cThe survivors must feel comfortable.\u201d Wednesday\u2019s hearing ahead of Weinstein\u2019s retrial comes just over a month after the New York Court of Appeals \u2013 by a 4-3 vote \u2013 ruled the testimony of \u201cprior bad acts\u201d witnesses should not have been allowed because it \u201cwas unnecessary to establish defendant\u2019s intent and served only to establish defendant\u2019s propensity to commit the crimes charged.\u201d Weinstein, 72, was\u00a0convicted in 2020\u00a0of first-degree criminal sexual act and third-degree rape, and he was sentenced to\u00a023 years in prison. He has maintained his innocence and denied any nonconsensual sexual activity. On Wednesday, prosecutors again asked the court to remind Weinstein\u2019s lawyers not to make public statements disparaging potential witnesses \u201cthat could materially prejudice the case.\u201d Defense attorney Arthur Aidala, speaking outside court earlier this month, accused witness Miriam \u201cMimi\u201d Haley of lying to jurors about her \u201cfinancial interest\u201d in coming forward with the allegations. He said Haley will be cross-examined on the issue \u201cif she dares to come and show her face here.\u201d Aidala told the court Wednesday, \u201cIn 32 years no one has had to remind me of my ethical obligations.\u201d Aidala said his statements about Haley were \u201caccurate\u201d and that he was not trying to intimidate the witness. The next hearing was set for July 8 and Farber requested that prosecutors alert the defense if they pursue a new grand jury. The defense\u00a0told CNN\u00a0Weinstein may testify before the grand jury if that happens. Weinstein has remained behind bars because he was sentenced last year in Los Angeles to\u00a016 years in prison on charges\u00a0of rape and sexual assault. That trial similarly used \u201cprior bad acts\u201d witnesses and has also been appealed. He was one of the most powerful men in Hollywood and helped produce movies such as \u201cPulp Fiction,\u201d \u201cClerks\u201d and \u201cShakespeare in Love\u201d until a wave of women spoke publicly about the pervasiveness of sexual abuse and harassment in what became known as the #MeToo movement. The ruling overturning Weinstein\u2019s New York conviction led to a range of reactions, with his attorneys saying it confirmed their claim of an unjust trial and his accusers and their advocates calling the decision a step back in holding perpetrators of sexual violence accountable for their crimes. The New York charges were directly based on the testimony of Haley and Jessica Mann. Haley testified that Weinstein forcibly performed oral sex on her in 2006 at his Manhattan apartment, and Mann testified that he raped her in 2013 during what she described as an abusive relationship. In addition, three other women testified at trial as \u201cprior bad acts\u201d witnesses. Prosecutors sought to establish a pattern of abuse. The three women \u2013 Dawn Dunning, Tarale Wulff and Lauren Young \u2013 each said Weinstein used his influence to take advantage of them when they were young and hoping to break into the film industry. After Weinstein was convicted in New York, his attorneys\u00a0appealed the verdict. They argued the \u201cprior bad acts\u201d witnesses should not have been allowed to testify and the court should not have given prosecutors the ability to question Weinstein about instances of verbal abuse and bullying on cross-examination. Weinstein ultimately did not testify. The Court of Appeals agreed with the defense, ruling the trial court erred in admitting \u201cthe testimony of uncharged, alleged prior sexual acts against persons other than the complainants of the underlying crimes because that testimony served no material non-propensity purpose.\u201d The use of \u201cprior bad acts\u201d witnesses has\u00a0increased in recent years\u00a0with the rise of the #MeToo movement. In sexual assault cases, their testimony can turn a difficult \u201che said, she said\u201d case into a more convincing \u201che said, they said\u201d case. In general, evidence that the\u00a0defendant has poor character\u00a0or has done bad things in the past is not allowed at trial amid concerns the jury will be overly influenced by these prior incidents and may ignore actual evidence of the alleged crime.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/29/us/harvey-weinstein-ny-court-appearance/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/31/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_05_30_politics_donald-trump-hush-money-trial-verdict", "text": "A Manhattan jury found Donald Trump guilty of all 34 charges\u00a0of falsifying business records Thursday, an unprecedented and historic verdict that makes Trump the first former president in American history to be convicted of a felony. Not only is Trump the first former president to be found guilty of a felony, he\u2019s also the first major-party presidential nominee to be convicted of a crime in the midst of a campaign for the White House.\u00a0And if he defeats President Joe Biden in November, he will be the first sitting president in history to be a convicted felon. The verdict in the hush money trial was announced after jurors deliberated for nearly 12 hours over two days. It will ultimately be up to voters in November to decide the significance of the guilty verdict delivered by 12 ordinary New Yorkers, which, on a legal basis, does not prevent him from being elected president again. \u201cThis was a rigged, disgraceful trial. The real verdict is going to be November 5, by the people, and they know what happened here and everybody knows what happened here,\u201d Trump said after leaving the courtroom, slamming the presiding judge and the prosecutor who brought the case. \u201cWe didn\u2019t do anything wrong. I\u2019m a very innocent man,\u201d he said as he vowed to continue fighting. Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, a Democrat, announced charges against Trump last year and presenting the first indictment of a former president, accusing him of falsifying the repayment of his former lawyer Michael Cohen in order to cover up a $130,000 payment Cohen made to adult film star Stormy Daniels to keep her from speaking out about an alleged affair with Trump before the 2016 election. (Trump has denied the affair.) At a news conference Thursday evening, Bragg acknowledged the historic nature of the case and the conviction. While Trump is a defendant \u201cunlike any other in American history,\u201d the district attorney said the verdict was arrived at \u201cin the same manner as every other case that comes through the courtroom doors\u201d \u2013 \u201cby following the facts and the law and doing so without fear or favor.\u201d \u201cThe 12 everyday jurors vowed to make a decision based on the evidence and the law, and the evidence and the law alone. Their deliberations led them to a unanimous conclusion beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant Donald J. Trump is guilty of 34 counts of falsifying business records in the first degree, to conceal a scheme to corrupt the 2016 election,\u201d he said. Throughout the seven-week trial, the district attorney\u2019s office brought in 20 witnesses to illustrate to jurors how the hush-money payment to Daniels was part of a pattern of payoffs to keep negative stories about Trump out of view before the election, and how Trump was concerned about the impact to the campaign when the payment was made in October 2016. Cohen was the prosecution\u2019s key witness, describing how Trump directed him to pay Daniels and then approved the scheme to repay him in $35,000 monthly installments in 2017, an amount that was \u201cgrossed up\u201d in part to account for taxes Cohen would have to pay. Judge Juan Merchan set Trump\u2019s sentencing date for July 11, 2024, at 10 a.m, just days before the start of the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee. Moments after Trump was found guilty, Biden said the only way to defeat his GOP rival is at the ballot box, with his campaign stressing the stakes of the 2024 election. \u201cThere\u2019s only one way to keep Donald\u00a0Trump\u00a0out of the Oval Office: At the ballot box,\u201d\u00a0Biden\u00a0wrote\u00a0on X, linking to a fundraising page. His campaign said in a statement that the verdict showed \u201cno one is above the law.\u201d \u201cThe threat Trump poses to our democracy has never been greater,\u201d Michael Tyler, Biden 2024 campaign communications director, said. \u201cA second Trump term means chaos, ripping away Americans\u2019 freedoms and fomenting political violence \u2014 and the American people will reject it this November.\u201d Trump\u2019s campaign also moved quickly to fundraise off the verdict, casting the case as a \u201cpolitical Witch Hunt trial,\u201d a sentiment the former president\u2019s allies echoed as they rushed to his defense Thursday. \u201cToday is a shameful day in American history,\u201d House Speaker Mike Johnson said on X, calling the case \u201ca purely political exercise, not a legal one.\u201d This story has been updated with additional developments.

{"id": "2024_05_29_us_social-media-children-influencers-cec", "text": "Cam Barrett knows the precise date of her first menstrual period. Her mother posted the news on Facebook. \u201cI was in fourth grade. I was 9 years old. The date was September 9, 2009. And my mom posted \u2026 something like, \u2018Oh my God, my baby girl\u2019s a woman today. She got her first period,\u2019\u201d Barrett said. \u201cA lot of my friends and their parents had social media, so it was super embarrassing.\u201d Barrett\u2019s childhood overlapped with the dawn of the social media era. She said her mother was an avid user of MySpace and Facebook, where she posted details about their lives and many of Barrett\u2019s private moments. Nothing about her life was off-limits, including her tantrums, her medical diagnoses and the fact that she\u2019s adopted, said Barrett, who uses the pronouns she and they. The popularity of her mother\u2019s posts earned them attention and perks from celebrities, such as front-row tickets to a Demi Lovato concert, Barrett said. But the oversharing severely impacted her as a child. In middle school, bullies used the information to mock her, causing her anxiety and other mental health struggles, they said. Sometimes, she hid in her room to avoid appearing on camera. She didn\u2019t confide in adults during her teenage years because she feared her secrets would end up on social media, she said. Her mother did not respond to repeated requests from CNN for comment. Now 25, Barrett is part of a growing movement of young people who are urging lawmakers to protect children whose parents monetize their images, videos and private lives on social media. Though it\u2019s unclear whether her mother earned revenue from the content \u2014 Barrett was too young to understand the process \u2014 the oversharing took a toll on her mental health, she said. The young advocates are calling for financial compensation for these children, and their right to delete unwanted content when they become adults. Posts about her staph infection led to bullying at school, she says Barrett shares with her 240,000 followers\u202fon TikTok\u202fher views on\u202fexploitive \u201csharenting\u201d or family vlogging culture. The term \u201csharenting\u201d is a mashup of sharing and parenting \u2014 involving the publicizing of kids\u2019 personal information \u2014 while vlogging is shorthand for video-led blogging. Barrett, a social media strategist who lives in Chicago,\u202fsaid her life was chronicled so much online\u202fthat a man once sent her a private message on Facebook when she was 12. The message said he\u2019d followed her home as she rode her bike and knew where she lived. The incident increased her anxiety and made her feel like strangers were watching her every move, she said. At a hearing in February 2023, she tearfully urged Washington state lawmakers to pass a law that protects minor children whose private lives are documented by family members on social media. In addition to the details above, she also told lawmakers that when she was 15, she was in a car accident. Instead of extending a comforting hand, her mother shoved a camera in her face, she said. She later told CNN that her mother took photos and videos of her on a hospital gurney and posted them to Facebook. CNN searched her mother\u2019s social media accounts and found one photo that appears to be from the accident. It\u2019s unclear whether she removed the other photos or restricted her Facebook settings. Barrett also testified that in her first year of high school, she got a staph infection that landed her in the hospital. Her mother posted to social media exaggerated accounts of her condition, she said. \u201cWhen I returned to school, my math teacher \u2014 who had seen my mother\u2019s posts \u2014 would taunt me and tell kids to stay away from the infected girl,\u201d Barrett told lawmakers. This led to bullying and eventually to her dropping out of school, she said. \u201cI plead you to be the voice for this generation of children because I know firsthand what it\u2019s like to not have a choice in which a digital footprint you didn\u2019t create follows you around for the rest of your life.\u201d In interviews with CNN, Barrett said the oversharing created a lot of tension between her and her mother, and the two barely talk now. Advocates want legal protections for child influencers Gen Zers like Barrett, who were born between the late 1990s and the early 2010s, have almost never known a world without social media. As adults, they\u2019re now unraveling the effects of having their childhoods documented online. Barrett said she realizes that her mother was navigating new technology at the time and may not have understood the harm caused by her posts.  Today\u2019s parents likely have a better awareness of social media\u2019s effects on children, and the advocates hope their warnings will help provide more insight. Children\u2019s advocates said it\u2019s important for parents to respect their kids\u2019 autonomy and allow them control of their own digital footprint.\u202f They said their biggest concerns are not parents who post occasional photos of their kids but family vloggers and other influencers who seek followers and revenue on platforms such as YouTube and TikTok. These influencers document their families\u2019 most personal moments online, turning their home lives into reality shows. Until recently, no states had laws protecting the privacy and financial\u202finterests of children influencers.  But that\u2019s starting to change. Illinois, Barrett\u2019s home state,\u202fpassed a law\u202flast year that requires parents to compensate child influencers. The bill, which amends the state\u2019s child labor law, mandates parents set aside a percentage of the money they make from content creation to compensate minors who are featured in online videos.\u202f\u00a0The funds must be put into a blocked trust fund and accessible to children when they turn 18 or are emancipated. Several other states are looking into similar proposals. \u201cSocial media happened to us so quickly and changed many of our daily habits and behaviors virtually overnight. It\u2019s like we all started taking a new medication, with no clinical trials or studies and no information about long-term side effects,\u201d said \u202fCaroline Easom, a comedian who posts skits mocking parents who monetize social media content about their children. \u201cAnd now, over a decade later, we\u2019re just starting to realize how reckless that was.\u201d In one of her skits, titled \u201clet\u2019s un-normalize filming children during vulnerable moments,\u201d she uses an example of a friend whipping out a phone to film another friend who\u2019s just announced something\u2019s bothering them. \u201cOne of the biggest lessons we are learning from people who were overshared as children is that social media is not the place to let your guard down, as a viewer or as a creator.\u202f Social media is not a safe space,\u201d said Easom, who has more than 3 million followers on TikTok. \u201cThese platforms invite and reward your vulnerability and authenticity, but that authenticity has lasting consequences, especially when it comes to children. The cost of posting your child for your own validation and attention might be their trust, or worse, their safety.\u201d They\u2019re seeking new laws similar to those governing child actors Family vlogging can be lucrative. Influencers on YouTube can earn about $18 for every 1,000 views, according to a January\u202fpost by Werner Geyser, founder of Influencer Marketing Hub. That number rapidly multiplies for influencers with massive followings. In 2022, the typical compensation for YouTube content creators  in the US was approximately\u202f$1,154\u202fper week, Geyser said. Chris McCarty, 19, a sophomore at the University of Washington, started the organization\u202f\u202fQuit Clicking Kids\u202fto combat the monetizing of kids on social media. Some children of family vloggers are living in homes that feel like sets and with parents who double as their bosses, said McCarty, who uses the pronouns them and they. \u201cI have spoken with some\u2026 child actors, and one of the things that really stood out is that when they were filming as child actors, there was a very clear distinction between when they were on and when they were off camera,\u201d they said. \u201cWhen they were home at the end of the day, they knew they didn\u2019t have to perform anymore. But this new generation of children, there\u2019s no home to go to at the end of the day where they can disconnect, because the camera is inside the house. It\u2019s like living in a movie set all day, every day.\u201d McCarty said family vloggers should be regulated like the film industry, citing as an example\u202fa California law\u202fthat mandates 15% of all child performers\u2019 earnings be set aside in an interest-earning trust. More states are weighing measures to protect children Some states are catching up with internet culture and taking a harder look at the world of child influencers and their families. The Illinois law, which goes into effect in July, will require family content creators to put a portion of their earnings into a blocked trust fund for their children. The bill was inspired by Shreya Nallamothu, a teenager who became increasingly alarmed by how often she saw children featured in family vlogs and wrote a letter to her state senator. In February, both Barrett and McCarty testified before Maryland lawmakers in support of a bill that would require people who use minors in monetized social media content to put a percentage of their income aside in a trust for when the kids turn 18. The bill also would allow adults whose content was posted on social media when they were minors to be able to delete unwanted posts when they come of age. Lawmakers in California, Georgia, Missouri, Ohio, Minnesota and Arizona have considered similar legislation. \u201cEveryone deserves fair compensation for their work, and these children deserve to share in their family\u2019s financial success, especially if it comes at the cost of their privacy,\u201d said state Sen. Steve Padilla, a Democrat from San Diego, in a statement. Padilla introduced a bill last year that would require online family content creators to set aside a share of their income in a trust for their children. McCarty is working with lawmakers in their home state of Washington on a similar bill. \u201cIt\u2019s been so inspiring to see states taking up the mantle, and I hope that we are able to keep this momentum,\u201d McCarty said. \u201cThese kind of simultaneous firecracker moments happening across the US \u2026 give me hope that we can reduce the harmful impacts on a federal level.\u201d But Easom said while financial compensation for child performers is a step in the right direction, there are still other issues that need addressing. For example, she would like to see limits on the number of hours children can shoot content. In September 2022, she\u202fread a letter\u202ffrom the child of a family vlogger who implored her to warn her followers not to subject their kids to monetizing their lives online. \u201cAny money you (parents) get will be greatly overshadowed by years of suffering,\u201d the author of the letter said. \u201c\u2026your child will never be normal.\u201d Parents should think how they\u2019d feel if someone shared their personal details, experts say Jessica Maddox, an assistant professor at the University of Alabama who studies social media influencers, is hopeful other states will follow in Illinois\u2019 footsteps. \u201cMany people don\u2019t view social media content creation and influencing as work, but it takes time and skill to do,\u201d\u00a0Maddox said in an email to CNN. \u201cSocial media has changed the nature of labor, and as a result, the nature of child labor. While it may be fun for a child to want to be in their parents\u2019 videos, children, especially young children, don\u2019t have the capacity to understand how far and wide social media content can go. In cases where their parents are receiving financial compensation for featuring their child, that child has essentially performed as a type of labor.\u201d Advocates said many parents are starting to realize their children deserve control of their own digital footprints. \u201cA lot of people who follow family channels and kid accounts have never zoomed out and asked themselves why they have such intimate access to a kid they\u2019ve never met,\u201d Easom said. \u201cI want people to remember the curated videos (that) family channels are putting out do not necessarily represent what happens when the cameras are off.\u201d CNN reached out to several family vloggers for comments on this issue but they did not respond. McCarty said the most egregious offenders are parents who seek out and even create drama among their children to boost their followings. \u201cImagine a family vlog where instead of antics, intimate details such as mental health issues, grades and personal things like potty training and first periods get shared online, where they live forever,\u201d McCarty said. \u201cParents then use this clip as clickbait to generate intrigue and revenue for a monetized family channel. Some accounts even record and monetize videos in which the parents encourage their kids to fight each other as a prank.\u201d McCarty advises parents to operate under the golden rule of do unto others as you would have them do unto you. \u201cIf your child posted things like, \u2018Oh, you know, my mom just got into a really big fight with her colleague at work the other day.\u2019 \u2018Oh, my mom didn\u2019t close this business deal at work, and she might get fired.\u2019 \u2018Oh, my mom and my dad aren\u2019t getting along because he spends too much time at the bar,\u2019\u201d McCarty said. \u201cIt\u2019s the intimacy of what\u2019s being shared that strangers don\u2019t have any right to know.\u201d Adults would be hurt if someone revealed their most personal details online to make money, McCarty said, adding that parents should\u202fassume their children would be, too.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/29/us/social-media-children-influencers-cec/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/31/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_05_28_us_spirit-airlines-jamaica-flight-mechanical-issue", "text": "The cabin of a Spirit Airlines flight from Jamaica to Florida became a scene of panic and confusion Sunday when passengers were told to prepare for a possible water landing after the aircraft was turned around due to an apparent mechanical problem, a passenger told CNN. The Airbus plane, which was headed to Fort Lauderdale, reversed course and safely returned to Montego Bay, Jamaica, \u201cout of an abundance of caution following a suspected mechanical issue,\u201d the airline said in a statement.\u00a0The passengers were deplaned and later put on a different plane to reach their destination. The incident happened after a record-breaking start to the holiday weekend for airline travel. The Transportation Security Administration announced it set a new record for most travelers screened in a single day on Friday, according to a post from the agency on X. Passenger Bettina Rogers captured video of the plane\u2019s takeoff in which a chiming signal can be heard twice in the cabin, though the meaning of the signal is unclear. Shortly after the signal, the pilot told passengers there was \u201cnothing to be alarmed about,\u201d Rogers said. About five minutes later, the pilot informed passengers the plane needed to return to the Montego Bay airport, Rogers said. But as the plane turned back, she said, the pilot announced, \u201cPrepare for emergency water landing.\u201d \u201cIt was scary, and people were freaking out and panicking,\u201d Rogers said. After the flight landed safely, the cabin was full of nervous chatter and orange life vests scattered the floor and seats as passengers walked off the plane, video taken by Rogers shows. Passengers exited the plane \u201cunder normal procedures\u201d and a new plane was arranged to take them to Fort Lauderdale, Spirit said in its statement. Rogers was able to make it safely to her destination in Atlanta. \u201cSafety is our top priority, and the aircraft will be thoroughly evaluated by our maintenance team,\u201d the airline said. \u201cWe apologize to our Guests for any inconvenience.\u201d On Monday, a United Airlines flight aborted takeoff from Chicago O\u2019Hare International Airport due to what the Federal Aviation Administration said was a reported engine fire. Also Monday, a Southwest Airlines flight from Denver to Tampa, Florida, was diverted to Colorado Springs after the flight attendants reported \u201ca possible smell of smoke in the cabin,\u201d according to a Southwest statement. \u201cSouthwest flight 1070 diverted safely\u201d the airline said in a statement to CNN, apologizing for the inconvenience. \u201cThe flight crew followed established procedures, landed the aircraft and safely deplaned customers and Crew,\u201d the statement said. Some travelers have expressed a growing sense of unease due to a handful of harrowing aircraft accidents and as well as a string of smaller mishaps and mechanical incidents on planes \u2013 mostly Boeing jets. The midflight blowout of an Alaska Airlines plug door kicked off the year, which has also since seen several severe cases of turbulence, including on a Singapore Airlines flight from London last week that left one person dead and 71 injured. A series of less severe mishaps have also drawn the attention of travelers and air safety regulators. The Federal Aviation Administration announced in March that it\u2019s taking a close look\u00a0at United Airlines after nearly a dozen incidents on its Boeing jets, including a\u00a0missing external panel, flames shooting from an engine after takeoff and a wheel popping off. Though such incidents have raised concern, aviation experts have pointed out that commercial flights remain one of the safest ways to travel in the US. The last major fatal commercial plane accident in the United States was in 2009, and between 2010 and 2022, there have been five commercial flight accident deaths.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/28/us/spirit-airlines-jamaica-flight-mechanical-issue/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/31/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_05_30_politics_what-happens-now-trump-felony", "text": "A New York jury convicting Donald Trump on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records brought the former president\u2019s weekslong trial to a close but ushered in a new phase of the historic case. Now in the unique position of being the first former\u00a0US\u00a0president convicted of a felony, Trump faces the possibility of a prison sentence or probation for his crimes\u00a0stemming\u00a0from a hush money payment scheme he helped facilitate ahead of the 2016 presidential election. Trump \u00a0\u2013 who is known for mounting lengthy appeals of court rulings against him \u2013 is also likely to appeal the conviction, which could significantly delay his sentencing, currently set for July 11. Here\u2019s what to know about the case following Trump\u2019s conviction. When will Trump be sentenced? Judge Juan Merchan has set Trump\u2019s\u00a0sentencing\u00a0for\u00a010 a.m. ET\u00a0on\u00a0July 11. Merchan could sentence Trump to probation or up to 4 years on each count in state prison, with a maximum of 20 years. For now, the former president will remain out of prison as he awaits his sentencing. Prosecutors did not ask for Trump to post any bond. Can Trump appeal his conviction? Trump has consistently appealed court rulings against him in an effort to delay the proceedings or eventually land his case before a court that may side with him. The New York case is no different. Shortly after Trump was convicted, his attorney Todd Blanche asked Merchan for an acquittal of the charges notwithstanding the guilty verdict. The judge rejected the pro forma request. During the course of the trial, Trump\u2019s legal team took other steps to preserve its right to appeal a potential guilty verdict, looking at rulings from the judge on testimony and evidence. They\u2019re all but certain to mount such an appeal in the coming weeks. Can Trump still be elected president? In short,\u00a0yes. University of California, Los Angeles law professor Richard L. Hasen \u2013 one of the country\u2019s leading experts on election law \u2013 has consistently said that nothing in the US Constitution bars a convicted criminal\u00a0from\u00a0running for the nation\u2019s highest office. \u201cLegally, nothing changes with Trump\u2019s status as a candidate,\u201d Hasen wrote in his Election Law Blog on Thursday. \u201cThe Constitution contains only limited qualifications for running for office (being at least 35 years old, a natural born citizen, and at least 14 years a resident of the U.S.),\u201d Hasen continued. Additionally,\u00a0states cannot disqualify Trump from running due to his efforts to overturn the 2020 election due to the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling earlier this year, Hasen\u00a0said,\u00a0\u201cand they cannot add qualifications such as removing convicted felons off the ballot.\u201d Will the conviction cost Trump his right to vote? Though Trump, as a Florida resident, is subject to the state\u2019s draconian rules disenfranchising certain people with felony convictions, he may ultimately\u00a0benefit from how legislators in New York in 2021 made it easier for felons to regain the right to vote. When it comes to the Manhattan guilty verdict just rendered,\u00a0Trump\u2019s right to vote in Florida\u00a0in November\u2019s election will depend on whether he is sentenced to a term in prison and if he has finished serving that prison sentence by the time of the election. Florida bans felons from voting until they have completed the full terms of their sentence \u2013 including any supervised release \u2013 and until they have paid any associated fines and fees. That latter requirement was the subject of litigation after Florida\u2019s GOP-led legislature passed legislation that undermined a state constitutional amendment allowing people with felony convictions to regain the right to vote. Florida\u2019s felon voting prohibitions apply to people with out-of-state convictions. However, if a Floridian\u2019s conviction is out of state, Florida defers to that state\u2019s laws for how felon can regain their voting rights. In New York, thanks to a 2021 law, people with felony convictions regain their right to vote once they finish their term of incarceration \u2013 even if they are still subject to parole. That means Trump would only be denied his right to vote in Florida if he is serving a prison sentence for the Manhattan conviction at the time of the election. What does this mean for Trump\u2019s other criminal cases? Trump\u2019s conviction means little for his three other criminal cases, which will continue to proceed as they were prior to him being found guilty in the New York case. Trump\u2019s federal election subversion criminal case has been on hold while the\u00a0US\u00a0Supreme Court considers his claims of presidential immunity. The judge overseeing his classified documents case in Florida has indefinitely postponed the trial. And the Georgia election interference case is in legal limbo while Trump and several of his co-defendants try to disqualify the Atlanta-area prosecutor who brought the charges.
