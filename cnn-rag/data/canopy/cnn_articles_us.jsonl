Union City Police arrested Atlanta police officer Koby Minor Wednesday, according to a news release from the Atlanta Police Department. Minor resigned from the department later that day. Minor was charged with murder and aggravated assault after shooting his Lyft driver, a release from the Union City Police Department said. The Lyft driver was identified by authorities as Reginald Folks and was pronounced dead at the scene. The affidavit said he was shot in the head. \u201cOur hearts are with Mr. Folks\u2019 loved ones as they confront this unspeakable tragedy, and we have reached out to offer our support during this difficult time,\u201d Lyft said in a statement shared with CNN. \u201cWe stand ready to assist law enforcement with any investigation and have permanently banned the rider\u2019s account from the Lyft community.\u201d A passerby who saw Minor waving his hand on the side of Stonewall Tell Road in Union City called police, the affidavit said. Minor told the passerby he believed he was getting kidnapped by Folks, according to the affidavit. Minor recounted to police he had gotten in the Lyft after leaving another police officer\u2019s home that evening. He told officers Folks was talking on the phone through his car\u2019s Bluetooth in an unknown language and Minor said he \u201cheard what he thought was another voice in his ear talking to him but did not say what the voice said.\u201d Minor told police he then asked Folks to stop the car but he continued to drive. When they came to a red light, Minor tried to unlock and open the door but he could not get the door open. He then added Folks turned around and attempted to reach in the back seat, which is when Minor shot him. He fired approximately three shots, broke the window of the vehicle, and exited. Minor is being held in Fulton County Jail. CNN has been unable to determine if Minor has obtained legal representation. The Atlanta Police Department hired Minor in 2018 and was on unpaid administrative leave during the time of his arrest this week, the department statement said. He was previously arrested in Milton in December 2023, and he was relieved of his department-issued firearm as a result, according to the statement, which did not specify the nature of that arrest. CNN has reached out to the Milton Police Department for more information.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/17/us/atlanta-police-officer-arrested-shooting-lyft/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/20/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_05_19_politics_biden-morehouse-commencement", "text": "President Joe Biden touted his administration\u2019s efforts to place Black Americans into the highest echelons of political power during a Sunday commencement address at Morehouse College, while also acknowledging the anguish simmering among young people across the US over the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. The president, speaking to graduates at a preeminent college for Black men, delivered a forceful call for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in Gaza paired with the release of Israeli hostages \u2013 while urging a long-term political solution to the crisis. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening in Gaza and Israel is heartbreaking: Hamas\u2019 vicious attack on Israel, killing innocent lives and holding people hostage; innocent Palestinians caught in the middle of all this \u2013 men, women and children killed or displaced and in desperate need of water, food and medicine,\u201d the president said. Biden faced a delicate balancing act ahead of his speech at Morehouse, where some students and faculty members opposed the president\u2019s presence on campus because of his stalwart support for Israel\u2019s campaign against Hamas. The White House worked for weeks to quell concerns, and it hoped the address would give Biden an opportunity to better connect with young Black men, a group that has been increasingly moving away from the president, according to recent polls. Biden and his campaign know the support of Black Americans will be critical for his chances of returning to the White House \u2013 especially in battlegrounds such as Georgia, where the president delivered Morehouse\u2019s commencement, and Michigan, where he travels later Sunday to attend an NAACP dinner. Prior to Biden\u2019s remarks, the school\u2019s valedictorian in his speech invoked the name of one of its most famous alumni, the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., to call for an end to the violence in Gaza. DeAngelo\u00a0Fletcher said it was his \u201cstance as a Morehouse Man \u2013 nay, as a human being \u2013 to call for an immediate and permanent ceasefire in the Gaza Strip.\u201d And as Biden began speaking, some graduates took part in a silent protest; one unfurled a Palestinian flag, while a handful of others turned their backs to the president. But Biden delivered his speech without any noticeable interruptions. Biden acknowledged young Americans\u2019 frustrations about the crisis in the Middle East and said the issue hits close to home. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the hardest, most complicated problems in the world, and there\u2019s nothing easy about it \u2013 I know it angers and frustrates many of you, including my family,\u201d Biden said. CNN has previously reported\u00a0first lady Jill Biden has privately expressed concern\u00a0over the humanitarian toll in Gaza. He added: \u201cI know it breaks your heart. It breaks mine as well.\u201d Democratic presidential candidates have enjoyed the support of Black Americans since the Civil Rights Movement, and Biden\u2019s history with the community runs deep. But polling has shown an erosion in support for the president from Black voters dissatisfied with his handling of the economy and his support for Israel. Spending much of his speech focused on democracy, Biden said there has been a recent national effort to obfuscate America\u2019s historical wrongs against its Black citizens. \u201cI never thought I\u2019d be a president at a time when there\u2019s a national effort to ban books,\u201d Biden said. \u201cNot to write history, but to erase history. They don\u2019t see you in the future of America. But they\u2019re wrong. To me, we make history, not erase it. We know Black history is American history.\u201d Extremist forces, Biden told the group of male graduates, peddle falsehoods about what masculinity is about. \u201cTheir idea of being a man is toxic. I ran into them all the time when I was younger. \u2026 But that\u2019s not you, that\u2019s not us. You all know and demonstrate what it really means to be a man,\u201d he said. Trumpeting his support for the nation\u2019s historically Black colleges and universities, Biden said he had \u201cno doubt a Morehouse man will be president one day \u2013 just after an AKA from Howard.\u201d The remark seemed to demonstrate Biden\u2019s hopes for the political future of Vice President Kamala Harris, a member of the historically Black Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority who graduated from the Washington, DC, HBCU. Over the last several months, Biden has largely shied away from addressing large crowds of young people on college campuses, a change that came shortly after his January remarks on abortion rights at Virginia\u2019s George Mason University were interrupted more than a dozen times by protesters outraged at his continued support for Israel in its war in Gaza. Since then, and as the death toll in Gaza of civilians, aid workers and journalists has continued to rise, that anger has only spread. More than 1,360 student demonstrations have taken place on campuses across the country from October 7 to May 3, according to data compiled by the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project. The overwhelming majority of those demonstrations \u2013 97% \u2013 have been peaceful, though isolated cases of property destruction and violence have gained widespread attention. Those instances reached a crescendo in late April and early May, when students at Columbia University overtook some university buildings, an encampment at the University of Texas in Austin was forcefully dispersed by police, and counterprotesters at UCLA launched an hourslong attack on a pro-Palestinian encampment. Those cases of campus turmoil prompted Biden, in brief remarks from the White House earlier this month, to denounce some of the actions of campus protesters. \u201cI understand people have strong feelings of deep convictions,\u201d Biden said at the time. \u201cIn America, we respect the right and protect the right for them to express that. But it doesn\u2019t mean anything goes.\u201d While dissent is \u201cessential to democracy,\u201d Biden said in those remarks, it \u201cmust never lead to disorder, or to denying the rights of others.\u201d Biden\u2019s Morehouse commencement was the latest in a series of efforts undertaken by the president in recent days to both acknowledge the nation\u2019s historic racial shortcomings while simultaneously addressing its next generation of Black leaders. The president on Thursday met with the plaintiffs of the historic Brown v. Board of Education case that overturned racial segregation in schools 70 years ago. During that meeting, some of the plaintiffs\u2019 relatives urged him to make the case\u2019s anniversary a national holiday. On Friday, Biden delivered remarks at the National Museum of African American History and Culture and spoke with members of the Divine Nine, a group of historic Black fraternities and sororities. Biden\u2019s stop at Morehouse is the second time he visited the college during his presidency. In 2022, both Biden and Harris delivered a speech on voting rights at the college.

Thomas said Thursday he would shut down commencement ceremonies \u201con the spot\u201d rather than allow police to remove student protesters in zip ties during President Joe Biden\u2019s graduation speech. Biden\u2019s scheduled commencement speech Sunday at one of the nation\u2019s preeminent historically Black colleges comes as school officials around the country have called in law enforcement to\u00a0clear pro-Palestinian encampments and quell demonstrations\u00a0in recent weeks. \u201cWhat we won\u2019t allow is disruptive behavior that prevents the ceremony or services from proceeding in a manner that those in attendance can partake and enjoy,\u201d Thomas told CNN in an interview Thursday. \u201cSo, for example, prolonged shouting down of the president as he speaks. I have also made a decision that we will also not ask police to take individuals out of commencement in zip ties. If faced with the choice, I will cease the ceremonies on the spot If we were to reach that position.\u201d Biden\u2019s presence on the Atlanta campus also comes as he seeks to persuade young voters to send him to the White House for another term, even as many have expressed frustration for his administration\u2019s continued support of Israel\u2019s military campaign in Gaza. Thomas said the college will not allow \u201chate speech,\u201d meaning any \u201ccalls for violence against another group or individual.\u201d He said Morehouse is a place that \u201ccan hold the tensions\u201d that have come to a boil at campuses across the nation. \u201cI would rather be the first president to have a failed commencement than to say you are less important than the ceremonies of this institution,\u201d Thomas told CNN. \u201cI thought about it from the vantage point of how should Morehouse show up as an institution. And we should never put the ego of the institution above our values. And one of our values is to see the humanity in all,\u201d he added. Thomas said Morehouse faculty members earlier Thursday voted to award Biden an honorary degree. He said Biden\u2019s decades as a public servant as well as a domestic and international leader whose body of work \u201cmerits an honorary degree from Morehouse College.\u201d \u201cWe need some place in this country that can hold the tensions that threaten to divide us,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cWe look around some of the most venerable institutions of higher education have canceled commencement, canceled valedictorian speakers because of their having spoken out and exercised their rights to free speech.\u201d Thomas said the college would allow silent, non-disruptive protest, even students turning their chairs or theirs backs on Biden \u2013 which, he said, would embarrass him. \u201cAs long as you don\u2019t conduct yourselves in a way that deprives others from being able to participate, consume and celebrate this moment,\u201d said Thomas, who has led Morehouse since 2018. \u201cSilent protests. You want to walk across the stage in a piece of garment that identifies your moral connection to either side of this conflict because we also have Jewish students here, you can do that.\u201d CNN has reached out to the White House for comment. Protests have erupted at college campuses across the country as students have demanded that universities divest from Israel. Commencement ceremonies are taking place against a backdrop of police barricades and heightened law enforcement presence, metal detectors and other security measures. Biden has been\u00a0confronted by some protests\u00a0during his own speeches and campaign events. A Biden speech on abortion rights at George Mason University in Virginia earlier this year was marred by more than a dozen protests over his administration\u2019s support of Israel.

Asked about criticism from \u201cconservative bishops\u201d in the US who have opposed Francis\u2019\u00a0more progressive\u00a0papacy and efforts to reform the Catholic Church, the Pope paused on the word \u201cconservative,\u201d saying a conservative is \u201cone who clings to something and does not want to see beyond that. It is a suicidal attitude.\u201d There is an important difference between taking \u201ctradition into account\u201d and being \u201cclosed up inside a dogmatic box,\u201d Francis emphasized. Francis\u00a0has envisioned a merciful Catholic Church open to everyone, a \u201cfield hospital\u201d ready to bind up the wounds of a suffering humanity.\u00a0But during his pontificate, the Argentinian Pope has faced attacks from some inside the church\u00a0who see him as breaking with tradition\u00a0and have resisted his call for reform, including an embrace of LGBTQ+ Catholics. Internal backlash has also emerged to his outspokenness on the plight of migrants and need to address climate change. Some of the strongest pushback to Francis\u2019 progressive approach has come from groups in the United States.\u00a0Those who oppose Francis say they want a pope instead who lays down the law and presents doctrine in black-and-white terms.

After three days of voting last week, 1,700 Disneyland Resort cast members who play characters around the theme park in Anaheim, California, as well as perform at parades, voted to unionize under Actors\u2019 Equity Association, the union announced Saturday night. Equity described the vote as \u201ca landslide victory,\u201d with 953 cast members favoring unionization and 258 opposed. The group had announced a union organizing effort in February before filing for a vote with the National Labor Relations Board in April.

{"id": "2024_05_19_politics_stefanik-israel-speech-biden-trump", "text": "House GOP Conference Chair Elise Stefanik delivered remarks at the Israeli Knesset Sunday, saying victory for Israel in the war against Hamas starts with \u201cwiping\u201d those responsible for the October 7 terrorist attacks \u201coff the face of the Earth\u201d and calling for a return to former President Donald Trump\u2019s policies. \u201cTotal victory starts, but only starts, with wiping those responsible for October 7 off the face of the Earth. There can be no retrievable dignity for Hamas and its backers,\u201d she said in her speech in which she called herself a \u201cleading proponent and partner\u201d to Trump and sharply criticized the Biden administration. The New York Republican, who is considered a potential vice-presidential pick for the presumptive GOP nominee, has been outspoken in the House over reports of antisemitism on college campuses, earning attention for her grilling of university presidents. Her speech makes her the highest-ranking House Republican to address the Israeli governing body since the October 7 attacks, according to the GOP conference. \u201cWhen the enemy is inside the gates of the United Nations, America must be the one to call it by its name and destroy it. President Trump understood that,\u201d Stefanik said. \u201cBut you know as well as I that the enemy is inside more than just the gates of the United Nations. It is also in powerful Western institutions in my country and beyond, where the virus, the vile virus of antisemitism is spreading. This is why total victory means not just physical self-defense but ideological self-defense,\u201d added Stefanik, who claimed that pro-Palestinian protesters on college campuses who are calling for a ceasefire in the conflict are \u201ccosplaying Hamas.\u201d In a rare instance of a member of Congress publicly criticizing the American president to a foreign government, Stefanik went after Biden, saying there is \u201cno excuse\u201d for his administration blocking military aid to Israel. \u201cI have been clear at home and I will be clear here: There is no excuse for an American president to block aid to Israel \u2014 aid that was duly passed by the Congress,\u201d Stefanik said. The Biden administration has paused the shipment\u00a0of some bombs to Israel, citing opposition to the weapons being used in the densely populated areas of Rafah. But it has also\u00a0begun the early stages\u00a0of a process to move ahead with a new $1 billion arms deal for Israel. White House spokesperson Andrew Bates said in a statement Sunday, \u201cThere has been no better friend to Israel than President Biden.\u201d \u201cHe was the first American president to visit Israel during war time \u2013 in the aftermath of the horrific October 7 terrorist attacks \u2013 and the first president to order the US military to defend Israel from a foreign nation\u2019s attack. As he has demonstrated, President Biden\u2019s support for Israel\u2019s security is \u2018ironclad,\u2019\u201d Bates said. \u201cUnlike some figures on the right, President Biden did not rail against the Israeli government in the days after October 7, nor has he ever praised terrorist organizations like Hezbollah \u2013 and he will not be lectured by any person who was silent in the face of those offensive statements,\u201d Bates said in reference to statements from Trump, who called the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah \u201cvery smart\u201d and said that Israel \u201cwas not prepared\u201d for October 7 in an interview\u00a0with Fox News days after the attack. Biden said for the first time publicly earlier this month that he would\u00a0halt some shipments of American weapons to Israel\u00a0\u2014 which he acknowledged have been used to kill civilians in Gaza \u2014 if Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered a major invasion of Rafah. \u201cWe\u2019re not walking away from Israel\u2019s security. We\u2019re walking away from Israel\u2019s ability to wage war in those areas,\u201d Biden said in an interview with CNN at the time. Stefanik attempted to paint a contrast between the White House and the House GOP, telling Fox\u2019s Shannon Bream after her speech, \u201cThe world is looking for moral leadership \u2026 and it\u2019s important that House Republicans step up to fill that void.\u201d \u201cOne of the main focuses of my speech was that the American people stand strongly with Israel, as do House Republicans,\u201d she told Fox, applauding the\u00a0House-passed, GOP-led bill that would prevent Biden from withholding, halting, reversing or canceling weapons transfers from the US to Israel already approved by Congress. Asked about civilian deaths in Gaza \u2014 where more than 35,000 people have been killed, according to the enclave\u2019s health ministry \u2014\u00a0Stefanik\u00a0pointed to Hamas\u2019 use of \u201ccivilian shields.\u201d \u201cIsrael has great respect when it comes to human rights,\u201d she said, \u201cand that\u2019s how they have conducted all of their operations, that\u2019s why the United States stands strongly with Israel.\u201d Human rights groups have\u00a0accused Israel of committing war crimes\u00a0and abuses during the war in Gaza. The\u00a0Biden administration said in a State Department report to Congress earlier this month\u00a0that\u00a0it is \u201creasonable to assess\u201d that US weapons have been used by Israeli forces in\u00a0Gaza\u00a0in ways that are \u201cinconsistent\u201d with international humanitarian law, but\u00a0it stopped short of officially saying Israel violated the law.

{"id": "2024_05_18_us_ucla-faculty-rejects-censure-gene-block", "text": "The UCLA Academic Senate rejected censuring and making a no confidence statement against university\u00a0Chancellor Gene Block amid mounting criticism over his handling of a campus pro-Palestinian encampment that was violently attacked by counterprotesters. Faculty members were divided Thursday while mulling whether \u201cChancellor Block failed to ensure the safety of our students and grievously mishandled the events.\u201d On the motion to censure Block, 50% of votes cast were in favor. The motion of no confidence in Block garnered 43% of votes in favor. After the vote, University\u00a0of\u00a0California President Michael V. Drake said in a statement: \u201cThese are\u00a0extraordinarily complex\u00a0and\u00a0unprecedented times for American universities. I appreciate\u00a0Chancellor\u00a0Block\u2019s dedication\u00a0and\u00a0commitment\u00a0to\u00a0the University during these difficult times. We will continue\u00a0to\u00a0provide our\u00a0chancellors with the support\u00a0and\u00a0resources they need\u00a0to\u00a0respond\u00a0to\u00a0these ever-evolving situations.\u201d Andrea M. Kasko,\u00a0who serves as the chair of the Academic Senate, called on colleagues to \u201ctry to find common ground\u201d in a\u00a0statement issued\u00a0following the votes. \u201cAs we all process the results of the votes by the Legislative Assembly on May 16, 2024, on the resolutions of no confidence and censure of the Chancellor, it is clear that we are not united in how we view the major events of the past weeks and the campus response to them,\u201d Kasko said. CNN has reached out to Block and UCLA for comment. As part of a movement that swept university campuses throughout the nation, pro-Palestinian protesters set up an encampment at UCLA in an effort to raise awareness about the mass deaths and destruction in Gaza, and calling for the university to divest from any financial ties with Israel. On April 30, law enforcement stood by for hours as counterprotesters attacked the pro-Palestinian encampment,\u00a0which erupted into\u00a0the worst violence stemming from the ongoing college protests around the country over Israel\u2019s war in Gaza. More than 150 students \u201cwere assaulted with pepper spray and bear mace,\u201d and at least 25 protesters ended up being transported to local emergency rooms, according to the encampment\u2019s organizers. While a criminal investigation is still underway into the assaults, a CNN review of footage, social media posts, and interviews found that some of the most dramatic attacks caught on camera that night were committed by people outside UCLA \u2013 not the university students and faculty who were eventually arrested. After the violence and as the university faced criticism, Block announced UCLA\u2019s security operations would change. He said it is clear that \u201curgent changes are needed in how we administer safety operations\u201d in order to best protect the school community. The university also said it is investigating \u201ca group\u00a0of\u00a0instigators\u201d who attacked the encampment, according to a statement from Block. \u201cHolding the instigators\u00a0of\u00a0this attack accountable and enhancing our campus safety operations are both critical. Our community members can only learn, work and thrive in an environment where they feel secure,\u201d Block said in the May 6 statement. Other universities and their leaders have faced backlash over their response to campus protests as well. This week, arts and sciences faculty at Columbia University passed a vote of no confidence in the school\u2019s president, Minouche Shafik, who has been under\u00a0intense scrutiny for her handling\u00a0of campus protests and her congressional testimony on the subject. Last week, the University of Southern California\u2019s faculty senate voted 21-7 to censure USC President Carol Folt and Provost Andrew Guzman over the removal of a protest encampment from campus and the use of Los Angeles police to arrest protesters, among other issues. Faculty and staff express disapproval Hundreds of University of California faculty and staff signed a letter addressed to Block \u201cdecrying the horrific violence perpetrated against our students on April 30, and calling on him to fully protect our students\u2019 safety and security, and to honor their first amendment rights to free speech.\u201d Days later, more than 900 University of California faculty and staff signed a letter demanding Block\u2019s resignation following the arrests at the campus. \u201cFollowing the violent and aggressive police sweep of the Palestine Solidarity Encampment on May 2, 2024, resulting in more than 200 students, faculty, and staff arrested while peacefully protesting, it has become obvious that Chancellor Block has failed our university,\u201d the letter said.

{"id": "2024_05_15_us_nakba-day-anniversary-palestinians", "text": "Mohammad Zarqa trembled with fear as he watched panicked crowds of people, screaming and covered in blood, rush into his small village on the outskirts of Jerusalem. \u201cYou have to run,\u201d he remembers a woman crying out, shocking Zarqa out of a daze and sending him racing home to warn his family. He was only 12 years old at the time, unaware of the looming war that would soon upend his life. It was April 9, 1948, and Jewish militias had just attacked Deir Yassin, a village about a mile northeast of Zarqa\u2019s home in Ein Karem in what was then the British Mandate of Palestine. At least 100 people, including women and children, were killed \u2013 many stripped, lined up and shot with automatic fire, according to reports from the time archived by the United Nations. The massacre is among the events that led to al-Nakba, or \u201cthe catastrophe,\u201d when roughly 700,000 Palestinians fled or were expelled from their homes by armed Jewish groups seeking to establish the state of Israel. \u201cWe thought we were going to be next,\u201d Zarqa, now 88, tells CNN from his home in New Jersey. \u201cMy father said, \u2018We cannot stay here. They\u2019re going to come and massacre us.\u2019 We had nothing, no weapons, nothing to defend ourselves. That\u2019s the day we became refugees.\u201d On Wednesday, Zarqa joins millions of Palestinians across the world to mark Nakba Day with protests and community events intended to honor the memory of the Palestinians killed and displaced in 1948 and the brutal war unfolding today in Gaza. Part of that commemoration includes a commitment to storytelling, Zarqa says, whereby survivors of the Nakba generation continue to share their experiences with younger Palestinians so the dream of liberation and return never dies. He believes it\u2019s the only way to understand the current war and work toward a just and lasting peace in the region. \u201cMy heart is bleeding,\u201d he says softly. \u201cAt my age, I\u2019m still dreaming of going back home. Palestine is something that is still implanted in my heart and my body. It\u2019s where I was born. It\u2019s where I have my memories. It\u2019s my country.\u201d Yearning for home Zarqa, along with his parents and six siblings, fled Ein Karem on foot, taking very little with them. They walked from village to village, searching for food and sheltering in the homes and garages of kind strangers. The atrocities he witnessed along the way are seared in his memory. \u201cI saw the most horrific things in my life: women coming in with torn clothes and uncovered heads crying, screaming, saying that the Jews \u2013 they weren\u2019t called Israelis at the time \u2013 attacked their village and massacred everybody,\u201d Zarqa says. More than 15,000 Palestinians were killed and 531 towns and villages destroyed during al-Nakba, according to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics, an institute of the Palestinian Authority. Jewish leaders declared independence and the creation of the state of Israel on May 14, sparking a military response from Egypt, Syria and Jordan. The family hoped the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, as it would come to be known, would end in a swift victory for the Arabs. After several weeks, Zarqa\u2019s family returned to Ein Karem. But when they entered the village, they found it had been ransacked and its residents cast out by Jewish militias, Zarqa says. With nothing left to salvage, they fled to Jordan to wait out the war, he recalls. The family initially lived in squalor, surviving off the generosity of strangers and local mosques. They shared a home with other Palestinian refugees in Jabal Al Weibdeh, a neighborhood in Amman, Zarqa says. It had a dirt floor and there were no windows, doors or bathrooms. They often couldn\u2019t shower for months at a time. By March 1949, Israel had won the war and forbidden the hundreds of thousands of Palestinian refugees who had fled or were expelled from returning to their homes and ancestral lands. Zarqa\u2019s family was among them. The family began to build a new life in Jordan, one marked by struggle and poverty, as they patiently waited for permission to return to Ein Karem. But it never came, and decades later Zarqa found himself living in the United States \u2013 even further from his homeland \u2013 trying to raise a small family of his own. \u201cWe made a life in the US, but this still isn\u2019t home. You never forget that you had a house and somebody kicked you out of it,\u201d Zarqa says. \u201cWe will never stop wanting to return.\u201d A responsibility to teach Neither time nor distance has blurred Zarqa\u2019s memories of Palestine. He has passed onto his four children and eight grandchildren every bittersweet memory of Ein Karem, from its acres of orchards to the hilltop where he could see the mountains and Mediterranean sea in the distance. Zarqa remembers Ein Karem so vividly that despite his decades of absence, he was able to give his grandson, Zach Matari, who visited the village in 2019, directions over FaceTime to his old home, now in present-day Israel. An Israeli family is living there. \u201cI remember every inch of my village. If you go there I can tell you there was this apricot tree here, and there was a fig tree there, and that\u2019s the stairs we used to climb,\u201d he says. Jenan Matari, another one of his grandchildren, is a writer and social media influencer who uses her platform to educate followers about Palestinian history, culture and current events, including the war in Gaza. She loves listening to her grandfather\u2019s stories and says her work, which is rooted in his Nakba experience, is a form of resistance. All Palestinians in the diaspora, she says, should use their voices too. \u201cI get really sad for my grandfather, because if I\u2019m feeling triggered by the things that are happening in Gaza, and I\u2019m feeling this depleted and in so much pain watching this, I can only imagine what it\u2019s doing to him and his generation to watch what they lived through happening again, but on an even greater scale,\u201d Matari, 33, tells CNN. Talking about al-Nakba isn\u2019t easy, Zarqa confesses. He often pauses mid-sentence or changes the subject when it hurts a bit too much. But he refuses to be silenced by his grief and even invites other Nakba survivors to his home to share their experiences with family, friends and the wider community Dawud Assad, one of those survivors, lives just 10 miles away. He narrowly survived the Deir Yassin massacre, which he says claimed the lives of 47 family members, including his grandmother and 2-year-old brother. \u201cI was supposed to be dead,\u201d says Assad, who is now 92 and nicknamed Al-shaheed Al-hay, or \u201cthe living martyr.\u201d Assad survived by hiding in a shallow trench near his home, crouching and quietly praying for mercy as bullets grazed his hair. \u201cIt did not begin on October 7. What we went through is exactly what we\u2019re seeing now in Gaza and Rafah,\u201d Assad says, referring to Israel\u2019s ongoing war there. Videos of dead children are especially triggering because they remind him of his slain brother. Israel launched its war in Gaza after Hamas\u2019 brutal attack in Israel on October 7, in which 1,200 people were killed and hundreds of others taken hostage, Israeli officials say. In the seven months since that attack, Israel\u2019s bombing campaign and ground offensive in Gaza has killed more than 35,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health. It also has imposed a siege and razed entire communities, rendering nearly 90% of the population displaced and everyone food insecure. Israel says its military tactics are necessary to defeat Hamas and return the hostages. The International Court of Justice says it\u2019s \u201cplausible\u201d Israel is committing genocide, though a final ruling in the case could take years. Israel \u201cutterly rejects\u201d the allegation. For Zarqa and Assad, the war is reminiscent of the horrors they endured during al-Nakba, and it\u2019s important for them to draw that parallel for young Palestinians in the diaspora, as well as anyone else trying to make sense of the violence. \u201cAl-Nakba never ended,\u201d Zarqa says. They point to recent statements from Israeli officials that have alluded to another Nakba through suggestions of mass killing and displacement, or outright calling for it. In a November interview with Israel\u2019s Channel 12 news, Minister of Agriculture Avi Dichter described the war as \u201cthe Nakba of Gaza 2023.\u201d Following Dichter\u2019s comments, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reportedly urged ministers to choose their words more carefully. \u201cWe must be sensitive,\u201d he said, according to The Times of Israel. Hope for the future Zarqa\u2019s heart remains torn between nostalgia and grief as he concedes he may never again see his beloved Palestine, stroll through the quiet streets of Ein Karem or taste its delicious apricots. But he\u2019s sure his descendants will. There are some 5.9 million Palestinian refugees worldwide, most of them descendants of that 1948 generation of exiles, according to the United Nations. It is \u201cthe world\u2019s longest-standing protracted refugee crisis,\u201d the UN said at a 2023 event marking the 75th anniversary of al-Nakba as it urged a solution grounded in international law. While some countries, including the United States and United Kingdom, skipped the commemoration after Israel called for a boycott, Zarqa elsewhere sees hope: The anti-war protests taking over city streets and college campuses across the world. \u201cI am so proud of them,\u201d Zarqa says. \u201cYou pass on your stories to your children and then they carry the banner and continue to teach their children, and eventually their own grandchildren.\u201d \u201cPalestinians will never forget.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/us/nakba-day-anniversary-palestinians/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/20/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_05_16_us_brown-pelicans-california-coast", "text": "Droves of starving brown pelicans have been found stranded on the California coast since late April and the root cause of the event remains a mystery, wildlife watchers say. Arriving dehydrated, starved and injured from fishing lines and hooks, the pelicans are mostly turning up in the Monterey and Santa Cruz areas in Northern California, International Bird Rescue, a nonprofit conservation organization, said on its website. They\u2019re also popping up in \u201codd spots\u201d in Southern California, including a lake at Inglewood\u2019s SoFi Stadium and a fire station in Malibu, the group said The California Department of Fish and Wildlife is \u201cperforming postmortem examinations on brown pelicans sent to our laboratories in Sacramento and Santa Cruz.\u00a0Preliminary findings indicate emaciation as the primary issue contributing to this stranding event,\u201d department spokesperson Tim Daly told CNN in a statement. International Bird Rescue reported more than 260 brown pelicans \u2013 a once endangered species \u2013 have arrived at the organization\u2019s California treatment centers since April 20. \u201cDiagnostic testing has not revealed any evidence of diseases such as bird flu that may be causing these strandings. Bird Rescue\u2019s staff and volunteers are working tirelessly to provide the affected birds with the best care they desperately need to recover and return to the wild,\u201d the group said on its website. The nonprofit said Friday they\u2019re overwhelmed with public donations of surgical tape, syringes, pet hair blow-dryers, waterfowl food, rubber floor mats, gloves and more. Still needed are donations for the cost of fish to feed the pelican patients. The seabirds have displayed this behavior before \u2013 almost exactly two years ago \u2013 in the same areas. And the recovery effort is expensive. In May 2022, the crisis cost the rescue group $45 per day for food, medicine and staff and $2,000 in fish, it said. Before 2022, the last great influx of brown pelicans to International Bird Rescue was in 2012. Two years ago, testing also showed symptoms of starvation in the nearly 800 pelicans that arrived in rehabilitation centers. \u201cIn Spring 2022, the precise factors that contributed to reduced prey intake by the pelicans was not determined although scientists concluded the pelicans likely had difficulty reaching prey fish in the ocean as they normally would,\u201d Daly\u2019s statement said. \u201cIn 2022 and in this current event, strong storm systems occurred in the southern California region in the spring preceding the events, and it\u2019s possible these conditions impacted the pelican\u2019s ability to access prey fish under the water\u2019s surface.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/16/us/brown-pelicans-california-coast/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/20/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_05_17_us_school-segregation-brown-v-board-dg", "text": "Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas \u2013 the landmark Supreme Court decision that declared \u201cseparate but equal\u201d education unconstitutional in the United States\u00a0\u2013\u00a0remains one of the most consequential court cases in American history. As the nation commemorates the ruling\u2019s 70th anniversary, civil rights leaders and advocates tell CNN the case may have paved the way for more equal and integrated schools, but\u00a0fierce \u2013 and continued \u2013 opposition to integration means the ruling in no way assured the end of segregated education in the United States. Although progress has undoubtedly been made over the decades, research shows many school districts today are racially segregated because they are divided along residential and economic lines. At times, federal courts have intervened, ordering some school districts to execute plans to integrate Black and Latino students with their White counterparts to improve educational opportunities. Gary Orfield, a professor at UCLA and co-director of the university\u2019s Civil Rights Project, said although there\u2019s been a steady increase in enrollment of non-White students in public schools, his research shows more students attend schools that are \u201cintensely segregated\u201d now than they did 30 years ago. That\u2019s when the Supreme Court ruled in Board of Education of Oklahoma City v. Dowell that court-ordered desegregation plans were \u201cnot intended to operate in perpetuity,\u201d allowing more segregation to take place over time as school districts reverted to neighborhood zoning. De facto segregation persists today, Orfield said,\u00a0because many states have abandoned efforts to enforce integration.  \u201cThere are many places where courts ended desegregation orders that had been accepted. A great many of the magnet schools that had been integrated for decades under court orders were resegregated,\u201d he said. \u201cThese were such tragic changes, throwing away real successes in a very polarized country.\u201d A \u2018massive resistance\u2019 to integration Historically, efforts to desegregate schools were at times met with violent resistance from White Americans. In response to the Brown decision, 101 southern lawmakers \u2013 roughly a fifth of Congress \u2013 signed what would become known as the \u201cSouthern Manifesto,\u201d which encouraged states to \u201cresist forced integration by any lawful means.\u201d \u201cIf we can organize the Southern States for massive resistance to this order, I think that in time the rest of the country will realize that racial integration is not going to be accepted in the South,\u201d Virginia\u00a0Sen. Harry Flood Byrd said in the days after the ruling was announced. That \u201cmassive resistance\u201d campaign spread throughout southern states. In 1957, three years after the Brown ruling, all eyes turned to Little Rock Central High in Arkansas as nine Black students were escorted into the school by soldiers in the US Army\u2019s 101st Airborne Division. The students are known today as the Little Rock Nine. Then, in 1965, a legal battle over integration in Mississippi began that would last more than 50 years. That year, Dianna Cowan White\u2019s parents listed her as the plaintiff in a lawsuit against the Bolivar County Board of Education, now the Cleveland School District, in Cleveland, Mississippi, because the district still forced Black students to attend an all-Black school. The district fought the lawsuit for more than five decades and in 2016, it would become one of the last in the country to officially desegregate, CNN previously reported. That ruling, advocates say, signaled that the fight to integrate schools was far from over. According to Orfield\u2019s research, which examines school integration across the country, desegregation efforts peaked in the 1980s and there\u2019s since been a decline in the percentage of Black students attending majority-White schools. Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall \u2013 who argued the original Brown v. Board of Education case as a lawyer\u00a0\u2013 wrote the dissenting opinion in Board of Education of Oklahoma City v. Dowell, the 1991 Supreme Court decision that released school districts from desegregation orders. \u201cThe majority today suggests that 13 years of desegregation was enough,\u201d Marshall wrote, adding that in his view, an order to lift any desegregation decree \u201cmust take into account the unique harm\u201d associated with racially segregated schools and \u201cmust expressly demand the elimination of such schools.\u201d But even in schools that are integrated, racist bullying and discrimination persists. From 2018 to 2022, more than 4,300 hate crimes were reported in schools, with the largest number of alleged offenses being motivated by anti-Black bias, according to a report from the Department of Justice released in January. \u2018Vestiges of segregation\u2019 As of 2020, more than 700 school districts and charter schools were under a legal desegregation order or voluntary agreement to desegregate, according to the Century Foundation, an independent think tank that works toward equity in education, among other goals. Leslie Fenwick, dean emeritus and professor at the Howard University School of Education, told CNN the decades of opposition to integration efforts has also led to a decrease in the number of Black educators. She explores\u00a0the unintended consequences to the Brown decision in her book,\u00a0\u201cJim Crow\u2019s Pink Slip: The Untold Story of Black Principal and Teacher Leadership.\u201d \u201cWe never define segregation the right way. In everybody\u2019s mind still, when we say segregation, we\u2019re only focused on students,\u201d she told CNN.  \u201cThe great failing, not of the decision, but of massive resistance to the decision, was that we wiped out 100,000 Black principals and teachers who were fired, dismissed and demoted.\u201d The original Brown v. Board of Education case was also litigated by lawyers with the NAACP\u2019s Legal Defense Fund, the nation\u2019s first civil rights law firm, which Marshall founded in 1940. Since the Brown ruling, the civil rights legal group says it has \u201csued hundreds of school districts across the country to vindicate the promise of Brown.\u201d Today, there are more than 200 open school desegregation cases currently on the federal dockets, according to the LDF, which estimates its lawyers are handling about a hundred of those cases. Michaele Turnage Young, senior counsel and co-manager of the Equal Protection Initiative at the LDF, said these lawsuits are necessary because the \u201cvestiges of school segregation\u201d still exist today.  Young said many majority-White schools are often better equipped with educational resources and better trained staff than majority-Black schools in the same school district. She noted other disparities include a lack of screenings for gifted programs, college prep programs and extracurricular activity offerings, and lower graduation rates. The anniversary of Brown v. Board of Education comes nearly a year after the Supreme Court gutted affirmative action in higher education, which sparked a conservative-led movement to outlaw diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs at public colleges and universities. Some critics of DEI say the programs are discriminatory against White Americans. But civil rights advocates and legal scholars tell CNN that arguments to end affirmative action and curb DEI are often premised on the idea that America has already achieved racial equality in education \u2013 a notion they say is far from the truth. NAACP President and CEO Derrick Johnson said he hasn\u2019t been surprised by the culture war that\u2019s now playing out in school districts across the country because \u201chistory has taught us that progress is not made in a straight line.\u201d \u201cWe will continue to see these reactions until more citizens realize that equal protection under the law, our ability to grow and prosper as a nation, will be based on our diversity and not on a single culture or racial identity,\u201d Johnson said. Dianna Cowan White told CNN her parents were able to enroll her in an all-White school while their legal case against the Bolivar School District wound through the courts. More than 50 years later, she says she can still recall how her 6th grade\u00a0classmates taunted her, often saying \u201cgo back to where you came from\u201d or, \u201cdid you paint your skin black?\u201d \u201cThey did not want me there,\u201d White told CNN. \u201cI felt like I was alone.\u201d But she also recalled the all-White school had better quality books, and was teaching a curriculum that was far more advanced than the Black school she had previously attended in the same district. The experience ultimately influenced her decision to send her children to racially diverse schools, despite the racism she encountered, because she felt they would have better opportunities. White said\u00a0when she learned of the judge\u2019s ruling to desegregate the school district in 2016 her first reaction was, \u201cit was about time.\u201d \u201cWe are in the 21st century, when do you let it go?\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/17/us/school-segregation-brown-v-board-dg/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/20/2024", "section": "us"}}

But more pandas are set to arrive in different parts of the United States. In April, it was announced China would send giant\u00a0pandas to live at San Francisco\u2019s zoo for the first time. And the San Diego Zoo announced in February it would receive two giant pandas from China, marking the first time the country has granted new\u00a0panda\u00a0loans in the US in two decades. Pandas have served as something of an unofficial barometer of China-US relations since 1972, when Beijing gifted a pair of the bears to the Smithsonian National Zoo, following US President Richard Nixon\u2019s historic ice-breaking trip to China. Chinese leader Xi Jinping said in 2023 the bamboo-eating bears serve as \u201cenvoys of friendship between the Chinese and American peoples.\u201d Just over 1,800 giant pandas remain in the wild, according to the World Wildlife Fund, which lists the species as vulnerable and describes them as the world\u2019s rarest bear.

{"id": "2024_05_18_business_college-graduations-pro-palestinian-protests", "text": "Universities across the United States have adopted a number of tactics in recent weeks to prevent disruptions by pro-Palestinian protesters at graduation ceremonies. Some universities have reached agreements with on-campus demonstrators, while others have cited safety concerns and canceled, postponed or relocated their schoolwide ceremonies. Several schools continue to grapple with pro-Palestinian protesters ahead of their spring commencement, subjecting themselves to internal scrutiny and public criticism. Protesters arrested at UPenn On Friday night, University of Pennsylvania police arrested 19 individuals, including seven students, following an attempt by pro-Palestinian demonstrators to occupy a university building, a\u00a0university spokesperson told CNN Saturday. Penn Against the Occupation announced their intention to occupy Fisher-Bennet Hall in\u00a0a post on the group\u2019s Instagram\u00a0Friday night, calling for people to \u201cflood UPenn for Palestine.\u201d The group called on the school\u2019s administration, in part, to divest from corporations \u201cthat profit from Israel\u2019s war on Gaza and occupation in Palestine and academically from Israel institutions, condemning the scholasticide of Palestinian scholars and universities,\u201d according to another Instagram post. Friday\u2019s arrests follow\u00a0the arrest of at least 33 people\u00a0on May 10 when law enforcement broke down a pro-Palestinian encampment erected on campus. The latest campus arrests also come just a few days before Monday\u2019s universitywide commencement ceremony, where students and their families will be subject to additional safety procedures\u00a0described as\u00a0\u201cairport-style security screening,\u201d the university said in a safety update earlier this month. Guests and graduates\u00a0will not be allowed\u00a0to bring signs, posters, flags and artificial noisemakers, according to school officials. UCLA and Sonoma State face internal division On Thursday, the Academic Senate at the University of California, Los Angeles rejected resolutions of no confidence and censure brought against Gene Block, the school\u2019s chancellor. The resolutions were brought forward in the\u00a0wake of an attack by counterprotesters\u00a0on an on-campus pro-Palestinian encampment on April 30, and claimed Block \u201cfailed to ensure the safety of our students and grievously mishandled\u201d the situation. The no-confidence resolution failed after only 43% of members voted in its favor. The resolution to censure failed to get the majority of votes required to pass by the senate. In all, 88 members voted in favor of the censure, while 88 opposed it, three abstained and 15 were present but didn\u2019t vote. \u201cIt is clear that we are not united in how we view the major events of the past weeks and the campus response to them,\u201d Chair Andrea M. Kasko said Friday in a statement. \u201cI hope that we can try to find common ground as colleagues, and have the courage to listen with open minds and open hearts even when we do not agree.\u201d Also Friday, Mildred Garc\u00eda, the chancellor of the California State University System, announced Sonoma State University President Mike Lee would be stepping down after he sent a message \u201cconcerning an agreement with campus protesters \u2026 sent without the appropriate approvals.\u201d The statement sent by Lee to the Sonoma State campus community on Tuesday included agreements to set up an advisory council of Students for Justice in Palestine as well as a review of the university\u2019s vendor contracts and investments, according to a copy of the message obtained by CNN. \u201cSSU will not pursue or engage in any study abroad programs, faculty exchanges, or other formal collaborations that are sponsored by, or represent, the Israeli state academic and research institutions,\u201d Lee wrote, adding study abroad programs in Israel will be \u201cterminated until further notice.\u201d On Wednesday, Garc\u00eda announced Lee had been placed on administrative leave for \u201cinsubordination.\u201d Morehouse threatens to shut down ceremony \u2018on the spot\u2019 In Atlanta, Morehouse College President David A. Thomas said he would shut down Sunday\u2019s commencement ceremonies \u201con the spot\u201d rather than allow police to remove student protesters during President Joe Biden\u2019s highly anticipated graduation speech. \u201cWhat we won\u2019t allow is disruptive behavior that prevents the ceremony or services from proceeding in a manner that those in attendance can partake and enjoy,\u201d Thomas told CNN\u2019s Victor Blackwell in an interview Thursday. \u201cSo, for example, prolonged shouting down of the president as he speaks. I have also made a decision that we will also not ask police to take individuals out of commencement in zip ties. If faced with the choice, I will cease the ceremonies on the spot If we were to reach that position.\u201d Biden\u2019s presence at Morehouse, one of the nation\u2019s preeminent historically Black colleges, comes as the president campaigns amid weak polling among young voters, even as many have expressed frustration with his administration\u2019s continued support of Israel\u2019s military campaign in Gaza. Biden has been\u00a0confronted by some protests\u00a0during his own speeches and campaign events. On January 23, his campaign speech on abortion rights at George Mason University in Virginia was interrupted\u00a0more than a dozen\u00a0times over his administration\u2019s support of Israel.

{"id": "2024_05_16_us_daniel-perry-texas-pardon-recommendation", "text": "Daniel Perry, a former US Army sergeant who was convicted of murdering a protester at a Black Lives Matter rally in 2020, was released from prison Thursday after he was pardoned by Texas Gov. Greg Abbott. Abbott\u2019s decision comes after the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles voted unanimously Thursday to recommend a full pardon and the restoration of firearm rights for Perry, who was sentenced last year to 25 years in prison. Shortly after he was pardoned, Perry was released from Texas Department of Criminal Justice custody, a spokesperson for the agency told CNN. Abbott asked the board to conduct an investigation in April 2023, and in a statement on Thursday, the board said its \u201cinvestigative efforts encompassed a meticulous review of pertinent documents, from police reports to court records, witness statements, and interviews with individuals linked to the case.\u201d Perry faced between five and 99 years in prison for fatally shooting 28-year-old Air Force veteran Garrett Foster at an Austin, Texas, racial justice rally two months after the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Shortly after Perry\u2019s conviction in April 2023, Abbott said he wanted to pardon Perry and issued an unusual request for the state Board of Pardons and Paroles to expedite a review of the case before a sentence was handed down. \u201cAmong the voluminous files reviewed by the Board, they considered information provided by the Travis County District Attorney, the full investigative report on Daniel Perry, plus a review of all the testimony provided at trial,\u201d Abbott said in a statement. \u201cTexas has one of the strongest \u2018Stand Your Ground\u2019 laws of self-defense that cannot be nullified by a jury or a progressive District Attorney. I thank the Board for its thorough investigation, and I approve their pardon recommendation,\u201d Abbott said. The governor can only pardon Perry if the Board of Pardons and Paroles recommends it, according to Texas law. Foster\u2019s mother, Sheila Foster, said she learned of the pardon from a social media post by the governor and couldn\u2019t believe it. \ufeff\u201cEverything that has happened is wrong on so many levels, and I don\u2019t understand why,\u201d Sheila Foster told CNN\u2019s Laura Coates Thursday. \u201cIt is so crystal clear to me that this man needs to be in prison for the rest of his life \u2013 not a mere 25 years. Why he wouldn\u2019t even have to serve a year? I don\u2019t understand.\u201d Doug O\u2019Connell, an attorney for Perry, said in a statement his client is \u201cthrilled\u201d to be free and thanked Abbott and the Texas Board of Pardons and Parole. \u201cI spoke with Daniel this afternoon. He is thrilled and elated to be free. Daniel is also optimistic for his future,\u201d O\u2019Connell said in a statement obtained by CNN. \u201cHe wishes that this tragic event never happened and wishes he never had to defend himself against Mr. Foster\u2019s unlawful actions. At the same time, Daniel recognizes that the Foster family is grieving.\u00a0We are anxious to see Daniel reunited with his family and loved ones.\u201d Prosecutors said Perry, who was stationed at Fort Hood, initiated the fatal encounter when he ran a red light and drove his vehicle into a crowd gathered at the protest. Foster was openly carrying an assault-style rifle \u2013 legal in Texas \u2013 and approached Perry\u2019s car and motioned for him to lower his window, at which point Perry fatally shot him with a handgun, prosecutors said. \u201cToday, a convicted murderer will walk the streets of Texas. Texas Republicans have once again proven that they cannot keep the public safe, they are not the party of \u2018tough on crime,\u2019 and they are not the party of \u2018law and order,\u2019\u201d Texas Democratic Party Chair Gilberto Hinojosa said in a statement responding to the pardon. He added: \u201cMake no mistake: Daniel Perry is a murderer who was on a mission to commit violence against Texans, and today our justice system was hijacked for political gain.\u201d In a statement on Thursday, Foster\u2019s former fianc\u00e9e, Whitney Mitchell, said she is \u201cheartbroken by this lawlessness,\u201d adding Abbott has shown that \u201conly certain lives matter.\u201d \u201cHe has made us all less safe. Daniel Perry texted his friends about plans to murder a protestor he disagreed with,\u201d she said. \u201cAfter a lengthy trial, with an abundance of evidence, 12 impartial Texans determined he that he carried out that plan, and murdered the love of my life.\u201d \u201cWith this pardon, the Governor has desecrated the life of a murdered Texan, impugned that jury\u2019s just verdict, and declared that citizens can be killed with impunity as long as they hold political views that are different from those in power,\u201d Mitchell said. During Perry\u2019s sentencing hearing last May, the prosecution asked that he be sentenced to at least 25 years in prison. They highlighted a stream of racist and inflammatory social media posts Perry wrote prior to the shooting and the defense\u2019s own analysis of his mental disorders and mindset. \u201cThis man is a loaded gun ready to go off on any perceived threat that he thinks he has to address in his black and white world and his us versus them mentality,\u201d a prosecutor said. Perry\u2019s defense team asked for a sentence of 10 years, citing his lack of criminal history, his psychological issues, including complex post-traumatic stress disorder, and praise from several of his military colleagues. They argued his actions were\u00a0justified as self-defense. Perry told police during an interview that he believed Foster was going to aim the firearm at him, according to\u00a0CNN affiliate KEYE. Foster\u2019s mother was \u201cin shock\u201d after learning of Abbott\u2019s pardon, according to Quentin Brogdon, the family\u2019s former attorney who spoke with the mother on Thursday. \u201cTo say that she is devastated is an understatement,\u201d\u00a0Brogdon\u00a0told CNN in a phone interview. The family had pursued a civil case against Perry\u00a0but dropped the case after he was convicted last year, satisfied with the jury \u201cholding him accountable,\u201d Brogdon said, adding the family will be considering any possible legal avenues but the prospects are \u201cgrim.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s hard to believe that the issuance of this pardon does not have some kind of political motivation,\u201d Brogdon said, citing Abbott\u2019s involvement in the case after conservative commentators criticized Perry\u2019s conviction last year. Perry diagnosed with complex PTSD and autism For the defense, Greg Hupp, a forensic psychologist who examined Perry twice in 2023, testified during his sentencing he diagnosed him with complex post-traumatic stress disorder and autism spectrum disorder. Combined with his military experience, Perry had an \u201cus versus them\u201d mentality in which his mindset was, \u201cI protect myself. I am ready for any imminent attack and anything out there can be a potential threat,\u201d Hupp said. On cross-examination, the prosecution noted that military records did not indicate either of these psychological issues. During Perry\u2019s sentencing, Mitchell testified through tears how her life had changed since his death. Mitchell is a quadruple amputee and said Foster had been her sole caretaker for the past 11 years, helping her get ready for the day, eat and work as a costume designer. They had bought a house in Austin together, and she said it\u2019s difficult to stay there without him. \u201cIt\u2019s hard every day that I\u2019m there. It\u2019s hard to sleep in my bed because he\u2019s not there,\u201d she said. \u201cHe was my main caregiver for 11 years and I\u2019ve had friends who have been taking care of me and have to learn how to do all that stuff that Garrett was doing for me for a decade, and it\u2019s hard because I had to get comfortable being vulnerable.\u201d Perry made comments on social media about killing protesters, documents show Documents related to the case that were unsealed by a Travis County judge following Perry\u2019s conviction show he had a yearslong history of making racist comments in messages and social media posts. In a Facebook message from May 2020, just weeks before the shooting, Perry told a friend he \u201cmight have to kill a few people\u201d who were rioting outside his apartment. The documents also contain a May 2020 text sent by Perry that said, \u201cI might go to Dallas to shoot looters.\u201d Some messages included \u201cwhite power\u201d memes. Perry wrote in a 2019 message that it was \u201cto bad we can\u2019t get paid for hunting Muslims in Europe.\u201d In a June 1, 2020, social media comment, Perry compared the Black Lives Matter movement to \u201ca zoo full of monkeys that are freaking out flinging their sh*t,\u201d the documents show. Clint Broden, Perry\u2019s attorney, criticized the release of the documents in a statement to CNN, calling it a political decision by prosecutors. CNN\u2019s Eric Levenson, Lucy Kafanov, Joe Sutton and Nouran Salahieh contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/16/us/daniel-perry-texas-pardon-recommendation/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/20/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_05_19_politics_us-niger-troop-withdrawal-agreement", "text": "The US has reached an agreement with Niger to withdraw its military forces from the African nation by September 15, according to the US Defense Department and the Nigerien Ministry of National Defense. The newly agreed deadline gives the US four months to drawdown fewer than 1,000 troops who remain in the country, as well as their equipment, which includes MQ-9 Reaper drones and other assets. Niger\u2019s\u00a0military\u00a0government\u00a0announced in March that it had ended an\u00a0accord\u00a0with\u00a0the US that allowed\u00a0military\u00a0personnel and civilian staff from the Department of Defense to operate in\u00a0the country. The US delegation met with Niger\u2019s ruling military junta last week to try to reach an agreement that would allow for the secure withdrawal of US forces and for clearances for military flights. The flight clearances had been a sticking point in the sensitive negotiations needed to withdraw US forces.\u00a0Until now, US troops who have left Niger took commercial flights, including as recently as last week, according to US officials. The remaining troops on the ground are tasked with drawing down US personnel and equipment still in Niger. The US delegation was led by Chris Meier, the assistant secretary of defense for special operations and low-intensity conflict. The Nigerien delegation was led by Col.-Maj. Mamane Sani Kiaou, the chief of staff of the Nigerian army. \u201cBoth delegations confirmed the guarantees of protection and security to the American forces during their withdrawal. The delegations also established procedures to facilitate the entry and exit of U.S. personnel, including overflight and landing clearances for military flights,\u201d the joint statement said. A deepening divide between the US and the ruling military junta following the coup last July ultimately led to the withdrawal, as the Biden administration called for a path back to free and fair elections. Rebuffing the calls, the military junta instead began partnering more with Russia, whose forces are now operating at the same base from which US forces are withdrawing. The US and Niger said they would continue to work together on areas of \u201ccommon interest.\u201d \u201cThe United States and Niger are committed to ongoing diplomatic dialogue to define the future of their bilateral relations,\u201d the statement said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/19/politics/us-niger-troop-withdrawal-agreement/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/20/2024", "section": "us"}}

You can sign up\u00a0right here. You can listen to an audio version of the newsletter by clicking the same link. Americans with deep pockets have played a growing role in powering the US economy with their spending. But their days of splurging like there\u2019s no tomorrow might be coming to an end. US household wealth\u00a0surged in recent years, despite the scourge of high inflation and the Federal Reserve\u2019s bitter medicine of elevated borrowing costs to rein in price increases. A robust stock market coupled with rising home values have boosted Americans\u2019 wealth from 2019 through 2022, according to a Federal Reserve report on household finances. That increase is known as \u201cthe wealth effect,\u201d and it has continued to shore up Americans\u2019 finances as stocks\u00a0shatter records\u00a0and high bond yields beef up savings accounts. Plus, Americans who locked in a low mortgage rate before the Fed began to hike interest rates in 2022 and have decided to stay put\u00a0have been shielded\u00a0from the effects of high mortgage rates. Put together, that means many consumers have not only been able to withstand inflation, to a degree, but they\u2019ve also been able to spend on travel, concerts and big-ticket items. US economic growth accelerated at a brisk pace in 2023, largely thanks to the US consumer. And it\u2019s Americans older than 54 who hold the vast amount of household wealth in the US, more than 70%, according to Fed data. But the economy\u2019s momentum has slowed a bit recently with figures on\u00a0employment\u00a0and retail spending for April coming in weaker than expected. While the broader economy remains healthy, including the job market with sub-4% unemployment, there are signs that an important corner has been turned. The shifting behavior of wealthy Americans is one of them. \u201cIt\u2019s well known that the lowest income consumer is really struggling with inflation, but from a purely economic standpoint, it is the higher quintiles of earners that do the most spending,\u201d Nanette Abuhoff Jacobson, global investment strategist at Hartford Funds, told CNN. There\u2019s been some evidence of wealthy Americans growing cautious in the latest round of company earnings results. British luxury retailer Burberry reported last week that its profits plummeted by 40% in the budget year ending in late March. Sales in the Americas dropped off by 12% over the year. \u201cExecuting our plan against a backdrop of slowing luxury demand has been challenging,\u201d Jonathan Akeroyd, Burberry\u2019s chief executive, said in a statement. LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton reported in its latest earnings results last month that demand for high-end liquors has declined sharply in the US, leading to high inventory levels for the French luxury conglomerate\u2019s alcoholic beverages division. Walmart, which traditionally caters to lower and middle-income Americans, even reported last week that its gains last quarter were \u201cprimarily driven by upper-income households,\u201d or those making more than $100,000 a year. But the broader picture isn\u2019t all doom and gloom. It\u2019s been mixed: Royal Caribbean Cruises topped expectations for its first-quarter earnings results thanks to solid bookings and robust onboard spending. Demand for cruises, arguably an activity for the well-off, shows there isn\u2019t this mass retrenchment from rich Americans just yet. But some are thinking twice before swiping that card or clicking on the purchase button. Consumers overall have become more price sensitive, according to various examples in the Fed\u2019s periodic collection of anecdotes known as the Beige Book. \u201cWhen we talk to CEOs and CFOs, they\u2019re saying that people are pushing back, so companies now aren\u2019t feeling as comfortable pushing through price increases,\u201d said Jacobson of Hartford Funds. \u201cAnd company earnings in the consumer discretionary area are ones to continue to watch for signs of consumer stress.\u201d 1 in 7 Gen Z credit card users are \u2018maxed out\u2019 Ariel Barnes plunged into a credit card debt spiral in college, and a decade later she\u2019s yet to escape. Barnes, a manager of gift processing at Jackson State University, has maxed out seven credit cards and is struggling to make minimum payments on $30,000 of credit card debt. \u201cThe interest is so high that it\u2019s hard to get out of it,\u201d Barnes, who is 28 years old and lives in Jackson, Mississippi, told CNN in a phone interview on Thursday.Barnes is hardly alone. Roughly one in seven (15.3%) Gen Z credit card borrowers have maxed out their credit cards, according to new research from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. (The NY Fed defined Gen Z as borrowers born between 1995 and 2011, though others mark the cut off as 1996 or 1997). By comparison, just 4.8% of Baby Boomer borrowers and 9.6% of Gen Xers have maxed out their credit cards, which can be a sign of a severely tight cash-flow problem, my colleague Matt Egan reports.Read more here.

{"id": "2024_05_19_us_dorothy-tillman-chicago-arizona-state", "text": "By age 14, Dorothy Jean Tillman had obtained an associate\u2019s, bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degree. Despite the impressive achievements, Tillman remembers turning to her mother and saying, \u201cI think I want to pursue a doctorate degree.\u201d Her mother,\u00a0Jimalita\u00a0Tillman, was surprised. They were in the middle of the Covid-19 pandemic. And Dorothy was a year into launching a science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics (STEAM) camp startup, and she was looking for funding for the organization. She was busy. \u201cI was just like, \u2018why?\u2019 I thought you were done,\u201d Jimalita told CNN. But after Dorothy explained that her mission was to positively impact young people when it came to their mental health, Jimalita understood and lent her support. Fast-forward two years, when 17-year-old Dorothy\u00a0successfully delivered her dissertation. Now, at 18, she is officially Dr. Dorothy Jean Tillman after walking at Arizona State University\u2019s College of Health Solutions convocation on May 8. Jimalita\u00a0told CNN that seeing her daughter achieve so much is humbling. \u201cI knew what it took for her to go through that. She had to sacrifice a lot. A lot of her fears and going through different things during the pandemic,\u201d she said. \u201cShe emerged as a leader without fear, showing them how to navigate online schooling.\u201d From a young age, Dorothy excelled in her academic pursuits. By age 7, she was already doing high school work. At that point, she started to take college level module tests and apply the credits toward higher education. \u201cIt was always a very hard thing to kind of stomach mentally being so young. When you get out of college, you\u2019re thinking, \u2018what do I do next?\u2019 Now I am able to sit in the comfortability of being a teenager and being OK with the fact that I don\u2019t have to figure out what comes next,\u201d Dorothy said. She studied integrated behavioral health at Arizona State University. For her dissertation, she explored the stigma that prevents university students from getting mental health treatment. In addition to her school work, Dorothy also devotes her time to running the\u00a0Dorothy Jeanius\u00a0STEAM Leadership Institute, which inspires hundreds of underserved young people in Chicago, as well as abroad in countries like Ghana and South Africa, to pursue STEAM careers. The program includes guest speakers and open conversations around each of the five areas of STEAM. \u201cWe just want to provide them with all the resources possible and the best foundation to be able to start walking on that pathway to their dreams,\u201d she said. While so many people marvel at the success she\u2019s achieved, Tillman says she is still a normal teen who spends time with family and friends. She gives credit to her mother as one of her greatest motivators. \u201cI definitely couldn\u2019t have gotten this far without her, like she\u2019s definitely the best teammate, the best supporter,\u201d she said. Another inspiration for Tillman is her grandmother, former Chicago alderwoman Dorothy Tillman, who worked alongside Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. during the civil rights movement. After graduating from ASU, Tillman hopes to continue developing her camps and start applying her studies on integrated behavioral health into her work. There is a potential for franchising the camps one day so more kids gain something, she says.\u00a0She also hopes to work more with kids in Africa. \u201cI\u2019ve been focusing on my studies a lot and I don\u2019t go nearly as much as I should,\u201d Tillman said. \u201cNow I\u2019m glad to have the time for things like that.\u201d While she\u00a0has achieved a lot at her age, Tillman tells people it\u2019s all about having\u00a0a supportive family around her. \u201cIt\u2019s teamwork that makes the dream work,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is a village that builds the land. It\u2019s having those people there with you that is going to, you know, uphold you at the end of the day.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/19/us/dorothy-tillman-chicago-arizona-state/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/20/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_05_16_us_loay-alnaji-paul-kessler-death-will-stand-trial", "text": "A man charged with manslaughter in the death of a Jewish protester he\u2019s accused of striking during dueling demonstrations over the Israel-Hamas war last year will stand trial, a judge ruled Wednesday, according to prosecutors. Prosecutors allege Loay Alnaji hit the 69-year-old protester, Paul Kessler, with a megaphone before Kessler fell and struck his head on the pavement of a street corner in Thousand Oaks, California, in November, the Ventura County District Attorney\u2019s Office said in a release. Kessler, who was demonstrating in support of Israel, later died at a hospital. Medical examiners determined he died from blunt force trauma caused by the blow from the megaphone and his fall, prosecutors said. Alnaji is facing involuntary manslaughter and battery charges after an investigation police say was complicated by conflicting statements from pro-Israel and pro-Palestinian witnesses. He has pleaded not guilty, the district attorney\u2019s office said last year. The tense confrontation happened during one of many protests sweeping US cities in the weeks after Hamas attacked Israel on October 7, killing an estimated 1,200 people and kidnapping about 200 others. Israel\u2019s ongoing military response in Gaza has so far killed more than 35,000 Palestinians, according to the Ministry of Health in\u00a0Gaza, and is fueling a worsening humanitarian crisis. During a two-day hearing, prosecutors presented evidence against Alnaji, including DNA analysis of blood on the megaphone, which matches Kessler, and video and audio taken on Kessler\u2019s phone in the moments leading to his fall, the district attorney\u2019s office said. Prosecutors have yet to find evidence to indicate Alnaji committed a hate crime, the release said. \u201cWhile antisemitic hate speech was heard at the November 5, 2023, rally, there is no evidence those words were said by\u00a0Alnaji,\u201d the release said. Alnaji\u2019s attorney, Ron Bamieh, told CNN his client was acting in self-defense during an altercation with the victim and said witness accounts of the incident have been \u201cinconsistent or inaccurate.\u201d \u201cThis case is a simple question of whether or not my client had the right to swat Mr.\u00a0Kessler\u2019s phone away, and as a result, hit him in the face in self-defense,\u201d Bamieh said. In November, Bamieh told CNN Kessler stuck his phone in Alnaji\u2019s face and he \u201cbrushed\u201d it away. \u201cWhen (Kessler) fell, my client is seen on the video 6 to 8 feet away from him,\u201d he added. The attorney said previously Alnaji \u201cfully cooperated with law enforcement, attempted to aid Mr. Kessler when he fell, and called 911 when he realized that Mr. Kessler was injured.\u201d While Bamieh concedes Alnaji struck the victim during the heated confrontation, he argued prosecutors were \u201caggressive\u201d in filing the case the way they did. \u201cThe prosecution is treating this as more of a publicity case and a political case than an actual criminal case.\u201d A spokesperson for the district attorney\u2019s office, Joey Buttitta, told CNN, \u201cWe pursue truth and justice based on the facts and the evidence, not politics and publicity.\u201d After he was charged, Alnaji was placed on administrative leave from his job in the Ventura County Community College District, which includes three colleges, the district said at the time. He worked at Moorpark College,\u00a0The Los Angeles Times\u00a0reported. Alnaji\u00a0is out on $50,000 bail and is scheduled for an arraignment on June 10, the district attorney\u2019s office said. He faces a maximum of four years in prison if convicted. What investigators said happened at the dueling rallies The incident took place while simultaneous rallies were being\u00a0held by two groups\u00a0identified as \u201cFreedom for Palestine\u201d and \u201cWe are Pro-Israel,\u201d according to the Ventura County Sheriff\u2019s Office. Authorities estimated between 75 and 100 people were present. Around 3:20 p.m. on November 5, the sheriff\u2019s office received multiple calls about a possible assault related to the protests at an intersection, Sheriff Jim Fryhoff has said. When deputies and medical responders arrived at the scene minutes later, they found Kessler lying on the ground, conscious and responsive, the sheriff said. Investigators determined a pro-Palestinian protester, later identified as Alnaji, had been involved in an altercation with Kessler, who at some point fell backward and hit his head on the ground, authorities said. Pro-Israel and pro-Palestinian witnesses at the scene gave contradicting accounts of who the aggressor was and how the altercation occurred, the sheriff said. A 50-year-old suspect was also interviewed at the scene, where he told deputies he had been involved in an altercation with Kessler, Fryhoff said. His home was searched by investigators the next day, the sheriff said. Authorities did not say at the time whether that suspect was Alnaji. Kessler was hospitalized in critical condition before dying from his injuries. In addition to determining his cause of death to be blunt force trauma, an autopsy revealed Kessler suffered injuries consistent with a fall, including skull fractures, brain swelling and bruising, and nonlethal injuries to his face, according to Dr. Christopher Young, Ventura County\u2019s chief medical examiner. The district attorney described Kessler as a father of one who had been married for 43 years. He worked in medical sales for \u201ca number of decades\u201d and also taught sales and marketing.

{"id": "2024_05_16_us_university-of-washington-protests-antisemitic-graffiti", "text": "Pro-Palestinian encampments have been cleared from more US college campuses as school officials have called in law enforcement in recent weeks to quell mounting demonstrations\u00a0over the institutions\u2019 ties to Israel amid its\u00a0military action in Gaza. Here are the latest developments: Arts and sciences faculty at Columbia University have passed a vote of no confidence in the Ivy League school\u2019s president, Minouche Shafik, who has been under intense scrutiny for her handling of campus protests over the Israel-Hamas war and her congressional testimony on the subject. Sixty-five percent of participants said they had no confidence in Shafik, a spokesperson for the New York university confirmed to CNN on Thursday, adding some 900 of its 4,600 full-time faculty voted. Among their concerns were that Shafik\u2019s leadership had \u201cnot only endangered our students; more broadly, it represents a serious threat to the core values of the university: academic freedom, shared governance, freedom of expression, and the right to peaceful assembly,\u201d the Barnard College and Columbia University Chapters of the American Association of University Professors said in a Thursday news release. Shafik \u201ccontinues to consult regularly with members of the community, including faculty, administration, and trustees, as well as with state, city, and community leaders,\u201d Columbia spokesperson Ben Chang said in a statement. Shafik a day earlier sent a message to graduates \u2013 after their university-wide commencement ceremony was canceled following weeks of Gaza war protests \u2013 wishing \u201cthat the challenges you faced during this difficult era will inspire you and make you stronger.\u201d \u201cI know that the last few weeks have been very difficult,\u00a0and\u00a0I am sorry that we were unable to celebrate your commencement in the traditional manner,\u201d she said in her message. Columbia cited security concerns in canceling the large event, a school official told CNN, and instead is holding smaller ones. Acknowledging \u201can extraordinary and tragic set of events\u201d in the Middle East and that \u201cas a great\u00a0university, we must engage with these issues,\u201d the polarization\u00a0at Columbia has caused conflict\u00a0on\u00a0campus, Shafik said. \u201cCanceling the traditional\u00a0commencement\u00a0ceremony was\u00a0one of the toughest calls in a year of many tough calls,\u201d Shafik wrote in an op-ed in the\u00a0Columbia\u00a0Daily Spectator, noting her top priority has been the safety of students, faculty and staff. \u201cThe conflict between the rights of pro-Palestinian protesters and the impact that their protests have had\u00a0on\u00a0some members of our Jewish community is what makes this moment singularly fraught,\u201d she said. UC Irvine returns to in-person classes after nearly 50 protesters detained: The University of California, Irvine, will resume in-person instruction and campus operations will return to normal on Friday, according to a school spokesperson. Classes went remote Thursday after law enforcement personnel used zip ties to restrain demonstrators the prior evening at the university before escorting them\u00a0away from a pro-Palestinian protest encampment and toward a parking lot. University spokesperson Tom Vasich said 47 people were arrested, including 26 students, two employees and 19 other individuals. Those who were arrested were taken to the Orange County Jail, where booking and processing were completed. \u201cThey were then released on citation,\u201d Vasich said. Vasich had earlier told CNN 50 people were arrested, but revised the number to 47 later Thursday. Most of those taken into custody were cited for failure to disperse after a direct police order and a few were arrested for trespassing, Vasich said, adding a full breakdown of how many of those arrested are students or faculty is expected to be released later on Thursday. \u201cA group of several hundred protestors entered the UC Irvine campus and began surrounding\u201d the school\u2019s Physical Sciences Lecture Hall at\u00a0around 2:30 p.m., Wednesday, the school said in an emergency update. The\u00a0university\u00a0put out a mutual aid call to local law\u00a0enforcement\u00a0and got help from the\u00a0Irvine\u00a0Police Department and Orange County Sheriff\u2019s Department, it said. Authorities cleared\u00a0what looked like at least half\u00a0of student protesters at\u00a0the encampment, aerial footage from\u00a0CNN affiliate KABC\u00a0showed. Pro-Palestinian protesters had set up a campus encampment on April 29, when the university also\u00a0called in\u00a0local law enforcement. Days later, the school\u2019s chancellor said the university would continue to negotiate with student protesters demanding their university cut financial ties to Israel over the nation\u2019s military action in Gaza. UC Berkeley Pro-Palestinian protesters arrested after occupying building: Law enforcement arrested at least 12 people Thursday evening as they cleared a condemned building at the University of California, Berkeley, that was being occupied by pro-Palestinian protesters, school spokesperson Dan Mogulof told CNN. Protesters broke into the university\u2019s Anna Head complex with sticks and bolt cutters on Wednesday, where they broke windows and spray-painted walls, police said. The university on Thursday estimated about 60 people were in the building and said the occupation was \u201cnot nonviolent civil disobedience.\u201d The protesters were arrested on suspicion of destruction of property, breaking and entering and trespassing, according to Mogulof. During the occupation, a Palestinian flag hung from the building, where protesters had set up tents, footage from CNN affiliate KGO shows. Images from the Jewish Community Relations Council\u00a0Bay Area show the building\u2019s interior walls covered in what the group called \u201cantisemitic graffiti,\u201d reading, \u201cZionism is Nazism\u201d and \u201cMartyrs never die.\u201d \u201cThe Star of David, the most recognizable symbol in Judaism, is seen equated with a swastika,\u201d the council said Wednesday in an X post. \u201cThis is not protest, this is pure hate.\u201d The building\u2019s takeover came a day after the UCB Divest Coalition\u00a0agreed to end its campus encampment following discussions with university leadership. The coalition did not initiate the break-in at the Anna Head complex, Mogulof said. UC Berkeley\u2019s chancellor was relieved to bring the encampment protests to a peaceful end, noting the school\u2019s leadership does not support full divestment from Israel at this time, she said. \u201cThe sale of direct investments is not within the authority of the Office of the Chancellor but rather lies with the UC Regents,\u201d Carol Christ wrote Tuesday in a letter\u00a0to the Free Palestine Encampment. If all divestment demands by students were met, the University of California system would have to sell $32 billion of its $175 billion portfolio, UC\u2019s Chief Investment Officer Jagdeep Singh Bachher said Tuesday during an Investments Committee meeting held as part of this week\u2019s monthly UC Board of Regents meeting at its Merced campus. University of Washington president calls for encampment break-up as antisemitic graffiti found on campus: After\u00a0protests escalated at the University of\u00a0Washington\u00a0\u2013 with \u201coffensive\u00a0graffiti\u00a0across multiple\u00a0buildings\u00a0all\u00a0over\u00a0campus, some quite clearly both antisemitic\u00a0and\u00a0violent\u201d \u2013 the school\u2019s president is calling again for the voluntary dismantling\u00a0of\u00a0a pro-Palestinian encampment on\u00a0the Seattle campus. Students and faculty on Wednesday discovered the graffiti, which has \u201ccreat(ed) an unwelcome\u00a0and fearful environment for many students, faculty\u00a0and staff, especially those who are Jewish,\u201d President Ana Mari Cauce said later that day in a statement, calling the situation \u201cuntenable.\u201d Cauce asked for the tent camp to break up, echoing her entreaty last week to demonstrators \u201cto dismantle the encampment\u00a0voluntarily for everyone\u2019s safety.\u201d \u201cMuch to my dismay, given the relatively cordial tone\u00a0of\u00a0many\u00a0of\u00a0our discussions, the representatives also said the new\u00a0graffiti\u00a0is an intentional escalation to compel the\u00a0University\u00a0to agree to their demands,\u201d she said Wednesday, adding university officials \u201chave engaged sincerely\u00a0and\u00a0openly.\u201d Among protesters\u2019 \u201cescalating demands\u201d is \u201ca new department that would have an \u2018anti-Zionist\u2019 litmus test for faculty hiring,\u201d Cauce said in the statement. \u201cMany\u00a0of\u00a0these demands, especially the most recent, are contrary to academic freedom\u00a0and/or to state or federal law.\u201d \u201cWhile I strongly support free speech\u00a0and\u00a0peaceful\u00a0protest, I also strongly support the rights\u00a0of\u00a0all\u00a0our community members to live, learn\u00a0and\u00a0work without fear,\u201d she\u00a0said. \u201cThe\u00a0University\u2019s response to students\u2019\u00a0calls\u00a0for change will not be based on an encampment.\u201d DePaul\u00a0University protest\u00a0encampment removed by police: Police in riot gear moved protesters away and dismantled tents Thursday morning at a pro-Palestinian protest encampment at DePaul University in Chicago, video from\u00a0CNN affiliate WLS\u00a0shows.  Two protesters accused of blocking nearby traffic were arrested, school spokesperson Russell Dorn told CNN, adding no arrests were made in the campus quad. The decision to dismantle the encampment came after \u201cgood faith efforts\u201d to negotiate with organizers, DePaul President Robert Manuel said. \u201cFrom the beginning of the\u00a0encampment, I have said that\u00a0we would protect free speech and the ability to dissent until it either prevented us from carrying out the operations of our university or threatened the safety of the members of our community,\u201d Manuel\u00a0said\u00a0in an open letter to students and employees. \u201cI am deeply saddened to say the encampment has crossed that\u00a0line.\u201d University buildings have been vandalized with graffiti, and the cost to repair the physical damage to the quad, which will be \u201cclosed to everyone\u201d until further notice, appears to be nearly $180,000, Manuel said in his letter. The DePaul Divestment Coalition \u2013 a multiethnic, multifaith student group \u2013 has been calling on DePaul to \u201cdivest from killing and harm abroad\u201d since its encampment was set up April 30. \u201cDePaul\u2019s administration chose to use violence to disperse the encampment and unilaterally withdrew from negotiations,\u201d Benjamin Meyer, an attorney representing the coalition said. \u201cThe students sent administration a calendar invite for a meeting on Monday, in which none of the administrators attended.\u201d Morehouse College could stop graduation if Biden\u2019s speech is disrupted: Morehouse College\u2019s president has vowed to combat any disruptive behavior during President Joe Biden\u2019s scheduled graduation speech Sunday at the preeminent historically Black institution by shutting down commencement \u201con the spot.\u201d \u201cSo, for example, prolonged shouting down of the president as he speaks,\u201d Morehouse College President David A. Thomas told CNN\u2019s Victor Blackwell on Thursday.\u00a0\u201cI have also made a decision that we will also not ask police to take individuals out of commencement in zip ties. \u201cIf faced with the choice, I will cease the ceremonies on the spot if we were to reach that position.\u201d Biden\u2019s visit to the Atlanta campus approaches as he seeks to convince young voters to send him to the White House for another term, even as many have expressed frustration for his administration\u2019s continued support of Israel\u2019s military campaign in Gaza. CNN has reached out to the White House for comment. This is a developing story and will be updated.

{"id": "2024_05_08_us_johnny-cash-daisy-bates-us-capitol-statues", "text": "The US Capitol will soon officially welcome two new, iconic figures. A statue of Daisy Bates, a civil rights journalist and activist who is perhaps best known for her role as a mentor to the Little Rock Nine \u2013 a group of Black students who were the first to desegregate schools and break Arkansas\u2019 color barrier \u2013 is replacing one of Uriah M. Rose, an attorney and former president of the Arkansas Bar Association. Another statue \u2013 of James Paul Clarke, the state\u2019s 18th governor \u2013 is set to be replaced in September by one of country music icon Johnny Cash. The statues of Clarke and Rose have been in the US Capitol for more than a century, with Rose being installed in 1917 and Clarke in 1921. The National Statuary Hall\u2019s collection includes two statues from all 50 states.  Bates\u2019 statue was installed in the hall on May 3 and officially unveiled on Wednesday, during a ceremony organized by the office of House Speaker Mike Johnson.  The bill to replace Rose and Clarke\u2019s statues was signed in April 2019 by then-Gov. Asa Hutchinson. Soon after, Bates and Cash were chosen as their replacements, CNN reported. Many had called for taking down the previous Arkansas statue representatives, including Clarke\u2019s own great-great-grandson, Democratic state Sen. Clarke Tucker. Citing statements made by Clarke, including his 1894 proclamation that the people of the South had looked to the Democratic Party to \u201cpreserve the white standards of civilization,\u201d Tucker said the change was needed. \u201cIn the context of who represents Arkansas in Statuary Hall, the time has come to move in a new direction,\u201d he said. Rose, meanwhile, had stayed loyal to Confederate Arkansas throughout the Civil War, according to the hall\u2019s website. Cash and Bates were Arkansas natives. Cash was born in Kingsland before his family moved to Dyess in east Arkansas. After moving away for much of his professional career, Cash returned in 1968 to play the \u201cJohnny Cash Homecoming Show,\u201d and again in 1969 to play at Cummins Prison. Bates grew up in Huttig, but moved to Little Rock in 1941, where she and her husband, Lucious Christopher \u201cL.C.\u201d Bates, started the Arkansas State Press, a newspaper devoted to the fight for civil rights. During her time as president of the Arkansas chapter of the NAACP, Bates led the charge for school desegregation, emerging as a key civil rights advocate during the 1957 desegregation of Central High School. Bates died in Little Rock in 1999. \u201cRemoving these kinds of statues isn\u2019t denying history as much as it\u2019s saying, \u2018We acknowledge the true history of it. We acknowledge this was wrong,\u2019\u201d said Benjamin Victor, the sculptor of Bates\u2019 statue. Victor said he sees the replacements as the \u201cright thing to do,\u201d noting the previous statues represent a time in American history \u201cthat was very ugly and awful.\u201d It\u2019s not the first time the US Capitol has had Confederate statues removed from the Statuary Hall. In 2016, Florida state lawmakers voted to replace its statue of Confederate Gen. Edmund Kirby Smith with one of civil rights leader, Mary McLeod Bethune. The statue was officially installed in July 2022, with Bethune making history as the first Black person to have a state-commissioned statue in the Statuary Hall. Victor, an artist from Idaho, has other statues on display in the collection \u2014 including Nevada\u2019s Sarah Winnemucca, Nebraska\u2019s Chief Standing Bear and Iowa\u2019s Norman E. Borlaug. He is the only living artist to have three (now four) permanent portrait sculptures displayed in the Capitol, notes the Nebraska Commission of Indian Affairs \u2013 an organization that helped secure Chief Standing Bear\u2019s statue in 2019. Little Rock-based artist Kevin Kresse, designer of Cash\u2019s statue, has his installation and dedication tentatively scheduled for late September, said Shane Broadway, chairman of the National Statuary Hall Steering Committee. Kresse is a lifelong, self-proclaimed\u00a0\u201cArkansawyer\u201d\u00a0and Cash fan. In choosing the details of Cash\u2019s statue, Kresse included a Bible tucked in his hand and Cash\u2019s signature guitar, which he referred to as Cash\u2019s \u201cbackpack that took him all over the world.\u201d Kresse \u2013 who is 62 now but was 59 at the time of the Capitol commission \u2013 said when Cash was his age, \u201chis star was starting to dim, but he didn\u2019t know at the time that some of his most impactful work was right around the corner\u201d \u2013 much like Kresse\u2019s own career, he said. Kresse doesn\u2019t want the full significance of the moment to be forgotten, he said. \u201c(Both Daisy and Johnny are) two people who stood up for those who are overlooked, passed over and pushed off to the side,\u201d Kresse told CNN. \u201cThey both came from abject poverty and some real trauma and tragedy early in their life and I think it really (caused) both of them to never forget where they came from.\u201d The artists for both statues were selected through a national competition organized by the committee and the Arkansas Capitol Arts and Grounds Commission under the endorsement of Secretary of State John Thurston who also serves as chairman of the commission, Broadway said. While the state of Arkansas handled the entire process of selecting a statue, choosing sculptors, and raising funds, \u201cThe Architect of the Capitol\u2019s Curator oversees the process from Congress\u2019 perspective and coordinates heavily with the states,\u201d Grace White, communications director for the US Committee on House Administration, told CNN in a statement. As a finalist, Victor traveled to Little Rock where he explained his vision to the selection committee while presenting a model of the statue. Victor didn\u2019t know who Bates was prior to entering the competition but felt compelled to help share her story after learning of her \u201cfearlessness.\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s this sort of unsung hero in US history that I love to celebrate,\u201d Victor told CNN. \u201cThis type of hero that everyone should know but relatively few people do know of. And we\u2019re changing that with each of these statues.\u201d Throughout her 1987 memoir \u201cThe Long Shadow of Little Rock,\u201d Bates likens her life to that of a red rose, which Victor incorporated on the statue\u2019s lapel, he said. Above the rose sits a NAACP pin. Victor believes the new statue\u2019s imprint in history will be monumental. \u201cIn that room in Statuary Hall, you got the spot where (Daisy) replaced Uriah Rose (and) it\u2019s right next to (Confederate President) Jefferson Davis. It\u2019s going to be a really powerful setting for Daisy to be included in because Jefferson Davis\u2019s statue is sort of scowling. It looks kind of negative. \u201cAnd Daisy Bates is smiling and striding forward right next to him,\u201d Victor said. \u201cI think it\u2019s this powerful juxtaposition and I hope Mississippi changes their statue (of Davis) soon. But for now, it\u2019s everything we could do to bring somebody like this into the Capitol, change out that corner, and change out that area.\u201d Staring across from Bates, as Victor describes, are statues of Bethune and Rosa Parks. \u201cYou\u2019ve got (figures like) Daisy Bates, Rosa Parks, and Chief Standing Bear (there) because they helped people instead of trying to hurt people,\u201d Victor said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to describe that feeling when (Bates) was installed in the room and the entire change of the room because of it.\u201d CNN\u2019s Katie Bernard, Alex Rogers, Rikki Klaus, Devon M. Sayers, Annie Grayer and Clare Foran contributed to this report.

{"id": "2024_05_19_business_pineapple-rubyglow-price", "text": "Imagine you have $400 to spend on a luxury dining experience. You might treat yourself to a tin of premium caviar, a bottle or two of very fine wine or a multi-course meal at a high-end restaurant. Or you could blow it all on a single pineapple. The Rubyglow pineapple \u2013\u2014 bred for its distinctive red exterior and its sweetness \u2014 costs $395.99 at Melissa\u2019s Produce, a California-based seller of specialty fruit and veggies. It took Del Monte, a wholesaler which sells a variety of produce but specializes in pineapple, a decade and a half to develop the red-hued fruit. A limited crop was first available in China early this year. Recently, Del Monte decided to see how the item would fare in the United States, and Melissa\u2019s starting selling it at the astronomical price. It may not seem like the best time to market a (very, very) expensive piece of fruit in America. It wasn\u2019t that long ago that soaring grocery prices made headline news, stressing out consumers and stretching their budgets thin. Still nervous about inflation and worried about unemployment, many Americans are now spending less. And yet, there\u2019s interest in premium fruit \u2014 enough to convince Del Monte to bring the Rubyglow, which is grown in Costa Rica, stateside. \u201cConsumers are willing to pay for something that\u2019s special,\u201d said Cindy van Rijswick, fresh produce strategist for Rabobank\u2019s global research team. When it comes to specialty produce, \u201cthere\u2019s always a small market for higher-end restaurants, or foodies, or certain online channels,\u201d she said. Americans have become interested in particular for new fruit varieties in recent years, paying a premium for Honeycrisp apples, Cotton Candy grapes, Sumo Citrus and vertically-grown Japanese strawberries. Now, they are hungry for different types of fruit, and are ready to shell out for exciting new options. But a $400 pineapple? That\u2019s a bit rich. The rise of premium fruit When the Honeycrisp was introduced over 30 years ago, there weren\u2019t many apple options in the supermarket. Red Delicious, Golden Delicious and, in some areas, McIntosh apples were standard fare, recalled Jim Luby, a professor in the horticultural science department at the University of Minnesota. But that was about it. \u201cIf you didn\u2019t go out to a local orchard, you didn\u2019t have that many choices.\u201d People were hungry for more, and Honeycrisp fit the bill \u2014\u00a0sweet, crisp and novel. \u201cIt became popular in Minnesota amongst our growers,\u201d said Luby, who was part of the team that developed the variety. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t that much production. So it was priced high. And yet it kept selling.\u201d Marketing new produce is a costly affair. Researchers have to breed and cross-breed, wait out the growing cycle, and start over if the fruit disappoints. Finding something that is both delicious and resilient enough to be commercially successful takes time, and a lot of painstaking work. Then plant scientists have to convince growers to make an investment in an unproven fruit, devoting resources that could be used for old favorites. But the Honeycrisp helped show that the risk can be justified. Since the apple\u2019s success, variety in the produce section has increased. Over roughly the past decade, per capita availability \u2014\u00a0a good proxy for consumption \u2014 of higher-priced fruit, like berries, mango and avocados, has increased, according to Rabobank, which drew from USDA data. In that time, availability of cheaper fruit like apples and bananas has essentially stayed flat. Some specialty fruits have even developed cult followings: those Cotton Candy grapes, named for their sweetness, hit the scene in 2011 and quickly became popular. Sumo Citrus, a hybrid of navel oranges, pomelos and mandarins, was more of a slow burn, but has exploded in recent years. In these cases, consumers have been willing to spend a little bit more. But those items are cheap in comparison to Oishii\u2019s specialty strawberries, grown indoors in a climate-controlled vertical farm. When its berries first became available to the public in 2018, Oishii charged $50 for a pack of eight. Oishii is selling more than just berries: It\u2019s selling a luxury item. The berries are packed in flat boxes that spotlight each individual fruit, more like a package for hand-crafted chocolate truffles than the mold-hiding plastic containers you see at a supermarket. Each fruit is supposed to be perfect. \u201cEven at $50, we had thousands of people on the waitlist constantly,\u201d said Oishii CEO Hiroki Koga. Buzzy or not, $50 for strawberries is not a sustainable price. Today, after rounds of funding and improved technology, Oishii\u2019s products are more readily available, and much cheaper. You can get Oishii berries at mainstream grocers for around $10-$14 per pack. Del Monte makes its move Del Monte\u2019s researchers have been coming up with different types of pineapples for years, designing proprietary fruit and often optimizing for taste. In 2020 the company launched its own pretty, giftable fruit \u2014\u00a0the Pinkglow pineapple, which has pink flesh and comes in its own special box. The Pinkglow was never supposed to be a grocery list staple, said Melissa Mackay, VP of marketing in North America at Del Monte. \u201cIt\u2019s a hostess gift, it\u2019s a Mother\u2019s Day gift,\u201d she said. It\u2019s also perfect for Instagram and TikTok, where food influencers with large followings cut open the fruit, marveled at its color and shared their reviews (the verdict: very sweet). At first, the Pinkglow was sold for about $50. Today, you can get one for far less, online between around $8 and $29 \u2014 bargain prices, relatively, but still steep for a pineapple. If you can afford it, splurging on a pink pineapple is \u201cpermissible, because you\u2019re investing in something that\u2019s good for you,\u201d said Melanie Zanoza Bartelme, associate director of Mintel Food & Drink. \u201cIt\u2019s like people who go to Erewhon and spend almost $20 on a smoothie that a celebrity created,\u201d she said, referring to the high-end Los Angeles grocery store known for collaborating with celebrities on pricey smoothies (like Hailey Bieber\u2019s Strawberry Glaze Skin Smoothie, priced at $19 for a 20-ounce cup). Still, she noted, there is a \u201cblank space between a $16 pineapple and a $400 pineapple.\u201d Is it worth it? Melissa\u2019s Produce, which sells everything from truffles to mangosteens to kumquats, describes the Rubyglow on its website as a \u201crare gem\u201d and \u201cthe pinnacle of luxury fruit,\u201d adding that \u201cfor the gourmand, it\u2019s an unforgettable gift.\u201d The pitch has had limited success. Melissa\u2019s started with 50 pineapples, according to Robert Schueller, director of public relations at Melissa\u2019s Produce. So far, it has sold about half that number over the course of a month, including to restaurants in Las Vegas and Southern California, which he said are using the fruit in displays. \u201cThere\u2019s a market for this,\u201d Schueller said. It\u2019s just a very small, very niche market. \u201cThis is not something for everybody.\u201d To try to create more buzz, Melissa\u2019s reached out to a handful of food influencers, including Bo Corley, a chef who shares recipes and other food tidbits on his social channels. The pineapple \u201cwas absolutely delightful,\u201d Corley said. \u201cThere\u2019s almost like a bitter aftertaste when you eat too much pineapple,\u201d he explained. \u201cYou don\u2019t have that with the Rubyglow.\u201d But, he said, it wasn\u2019t worth $400. Corley can see people spending to get their hands on the Rubyglow, if not for the taste of the pineapple itself then for the wow factor of the brilliant exterior. \u201cI think charcuterie boards this Christmas, Thanksgiving \u2014\u00a0you\u2019re going to see this Rubyglow as a centerpiece, especially in an affluent house,\u201d he said. In other words, people may not spend for the taste of the pineapple, but just to show off that they have it.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/19/business/pineapple-rubyglow-price/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/20/2024", "section": "us"}}

{"id": "2024_05_19_us_scottie-scheffler-arrest-pga-championship", "text": "The world\u2019s top golfer was being booked and fingerprinted before the second round of the PGA Championship in Louisville, Kentucky, when a police officer asked an unusual question: \u201cSo do you want the full experience today?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know how to answer that,\u201d Scottie Scheffler told one of several officers who had now started to razz the Masters champion arrested early Friday in the alleged assault of another officer in a traffic incident outside the Valhalla Golf Club. \u201cCome on, man, you want a sandwich?\u201d the officer at the jail asked during a light moment on a day that started with tragedy. \u201cSure, I\u2019ll take a sandwich,\u201d Scheffler, who had yet to have breakfast, recalled saying. Under \u201cplace of employment/occupation,\u201d the Louisville Metro Police Department report for inmate No. 00654436 read \u201cPROFESSIONAL GOLFER,\u201d though officers didn\u2019t immediately recognize him. The time and place of arrest were listed as 6:20 a.m. at Gate 1 of the Valhalla Golf Club on Shelbyville Road, near where a 69-year-old man named John Mills had earlier been fatally struck by a bus while crossing the street to work for a tournament vendor. Over four surreal hours, Scheffler, 27, a man of faith who once proclaimed his \u201cidentity isn\u2019t a golf score,\u201d was charged with felony assault for allegedly dragging a police officer with his car while arriving at the course in the predawn hours. He was handcuffed and taken away in an arrest captured on video that was widely circulated on social media. He took a mug shot in an orange jumpsuit and rushed back to the course in time to shoot a stellar 5-under par that left him near the top of the leaderboard. Scheffler struggled on Saturday, knocking himself out of contention for the championship. \u201cI definitely never imagined ever going to jail, and I definitely never imagined going to jail the morning before one of my tee times for sure,\u201d Scheffler told reporters Friday. Scheffler called the incident a \u201cbig misunderstanding.\u201d \u2018I feel for them. I\u2019m sorry\u2019 One of the strangest days in the history of professional golf began to unfold at 5:07 a.m. Friday, when police said a pedestrian was struck by a shuttle bus in front of Gate 2 at Valhalla. The pedestrian was later identified as Mills. He was described by Mayor Craig Greenberg as \u201ca Louisvillian who will be greatly missed by his family and our community.\u201d Mills had been \u201cenjoying his time at Valhalla while working security,\u201d his family told CNN affiliate WDRB in a statement. \u201cHe liked to stay busy in retirement. We love him and will miss him,\u201d Mills\u2019 family said. \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate for the person that did pass away earlier today. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s getting talked about enough, or at all,\u201d golfer Collin Morikawa lamented hours after the accident. At a news conference after competing on Friday Scheffler talked immediately about Mills\u2019 family. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine what they\u2019re going through this morning,\u201d he said. \u201cOne day he\u2019s heading to the golf course to watch a tournament. A few moments later he\u2019s trying to cross the street, and now he\u2019s no longer with us. I can\u2019t imagine what they\u2019re going through. My heart \u2013 I feel for them. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d After Mills was struck, police shut down traffic outside the course. At 6:16 a.m., Scheffler pulled up to stalled traffic in a black 2024 Lexus and steered the PGA player courtesy vehicle into the opposite lane in an attempt to get around the backup. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what \u2026 happened at the time other than there was an accident,\u201d Scheffler said. \u201cI didn\u2019t know that it was fatal.\u201d On the dark and rainy morning, Det. Bryan Gillis was directing traffic into Valhalla. \u201cDetective Gillis was in the middle of the westbound lanes, in full LMPD uniform and a hi-visibility yellow reflective rain jacket,\u201d the police report read. \u201cDetective Gillis stopped subject and attempted to give instructions.\u201d Scheffler \u201crefused to comply and accelerated forward, dragging Detective Gillis to the ground,\u201d according to the police report. \u201cDetective Gillis suffered pain, swelling, and abrasions to his left wrist and knee. He was transported to the hospital for further medical treatment by emergency medical personnel. Detective Gillis\u2019 uniform pants, valued at approximately $80, were damaged beyond repair.\u201d \u2018No idea he was even Scottie Scheffler\u2019 ESPN\u2019s Jeff Darlington witnessed the encounter. He wrote on social media that Scheffler \u201ccontinued to drive about 10 to 20 yards toward the entrance\u201d before stopping. \u201cThe police officer attempted to attach himself to Scheffler\u2019s car, and Scheffler then stopped his vehicle at the entrance to Valhalla,\u201d Darlington\u00a0wrote on X. \u201cThe police officer then began to scream at Scheffler to get out of the car. When Scheffler exited the vehicle, the officer shoved Scheffler against the car and immediately placed him in handcuffs.\u201d Darlington attempted unsuccessfully to intervene. He was only several feet away when the golfer was arrested. At one point, Darlington said on ESPN, Scheffler saw the journalist and said, \u201cCan you help?\u201d Darlington on video is seen briefly following officers as they took Scheffler away. Police tell him to step back. \u201cYou need to get out of the way. Right now, he\u2019s going to jail. He\u2019s going to jail and there\u2019s nothing you can do about it,\u201d one officer told Darlington, referring to Scheffler. \u201cThe police officers around the patrol car in which Scottie Scheffler was in had no idea he was even Scottie Scheffler,\u201d Darlington said on air. \u201cI say that because one police officer came up to me with his pad and said \u2026 \u2018Can you tell me the name of the person who was just arrested?\u2019\u201d \u2018I was pretty rattled\u2019 Scheffler\u2019s attorney, Steven Romines, said his client was headed to the golf course early to prepare for his tee time. \u201cDue to the combination of event traffic and a traffic fatality in the area it was a very chaotic situation. He was proceeding as directed by another traffic officer and driving a marked player\u2019s vehicle with credentials visible,\u201d Romines said in a statement, referring to Scheffler. \u201cIn the confusion, Scottie is alleged to have disregarded a different officer\u2019s traffic signals resulting in these charges.\u201d Multiple eyewitnesses have said Scheffler \u201cdid not do anything wrong\u201d but drove as directed, according to Romines. \u201cHe stopped immediately upon being directed to and never at any point assaulted any officer with his vehicle,\u201d the statement reads. \u201cWe will plead not guilty and litigate this matter as needed.\u201d Scheffler \u2013 a new father who has called golf a way for him \u201cto glorify God\u201d \u2013 would be seen over the course of the day on video wearing gym shorts and a T-shirt as he was led away in handcuffs and in an orange jail shirt for his mug shot. \u201cI was pretty rattled, to say the least,\u201d Scheffler said. \u201cI was shaking for like an hour.\u201d Scheffler was booked at 7:28 a.m. Friday. He was charged with felony second-degree assault on a police officer, along with lesser charges of third-degree criminal mischief, reckless driving and disregarding signals from officers directing traffic, according to Jefferson County court records. Josh Abner, a spokesperson for the office of Jefferson County Attorney\u00a0Mike O\u2019Connell, told CNN prosecutors are \u201cstill obtaining information in the case of Mr. Scheffler and will review and proceed accordingly.\u201d Scheffler has a court hearing scheduled for Tuesday. \u201cMy situation will get handled. It was a chaotic situation and a big misunderstanding,\u201d Scheffler told reporters, declining to comment on the specifics of what happened leading up to his arrest. He sat in the back of a police car and could hear an officer trying to figure out his identity. \u201cAt no point did I try to name-drop myself,\u201d Scheffler said. The golfer said \u201ca nice chat\u201d with the officer who drove him to the jail helped calm his nerves. At the jail at one point he asked the same officer, \u201c\u2018Hey, excuse me, can you just come hang out with me for a few minutes so I can calm down.\u2019 I was never angry. I was just in shock.\u201d He got ready to play while in police custody Scheffler recalled some officers cracking jokes about how he ended up behind bars before his tee time at the PGA, one of golf\u2019s four major tournaments. He said he looked out from his cell at one point and saw himself getting arrested on ESPN. \u201cI did spend some time stretching in a jail cell. That was a first for me. That was part of my warmup,\u201d he said. \u201cI started going through my routine and I tried to get my heart rate down as much as I could.\u201d Later that morning, an officer came to the holding cell and said, \u201cLet\u2019s go\u2026 Get ready,\u201d motioning for Scheffler to roll up his mat. \u201cI poked my head at the TV and I was like, \u2018Oh, I might be able to get there. We\u2019ll see how bad the traffic is getting in and out,\u2019\u201d Scheffler said. Just before his 10:08 a.m. tee time, Scheffler walked down to the tee box holding an umbrella under a light rain.  Chants of \u201cScottie! Scottie! Scottie!\u201d broke out among the spectators. \u201cFree Scottie!\u201d one man yelled, eliciting cheers from the crowd. Scheffler struck his first shot of the day with a crisp click of the club, sending the ball soaring toward the cloudy sky and unleashing applause and another round of cheers from the spectators. Some had scrawled the words \u201cFree Scottie\u201d with markers on their shirts. After 18 holes and his move up the leaderboard, he summed up his feelings at the news conference. \u201cIt was nice to be able to get inside the ropes,\u201d he said, \u201cand do what I love to do.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/19/us/scottie-scheffler-arrest-pga-championship/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/20/2024", "section": "us"}}

The New York Democrat called the legislation \u201ca tough, serious-minded, and \u2013 critically, bipartisan \u2013 proposal to secure our border\u201d in a \u201cDear Colleague\u201d letter. The initial package, which included tough border provisions and foreign aid to US allies, was blocked in February by the Senate amid a torrent of attacks by top House Republicans and former President Donald Trump, who is making the border a central campaign issue in his race for the White House. The Senate\u00a0passed\u00a0a separate foreign aid package last month. \u201cBack in January, the former President urged Congressional Republicans to kill the bipartisan bill, telling the world proudly to \u2018blame it on me.\u2019 The American people do not have the luxury of playing partisan blame games. They want bipartisan action to secure our border,\u201d Schumer said in the letter, which did not specify when the bill would be taken up. Schumer acknowledged that he doesn\u2019t expect all Democrats will support the stand-alone border bill \u2014 with some caucus members saying earlier this year the legislation \u201cmisses the mark.\u201d Republican leaders have already said they oppose Schumer\u2019s move to revote on the legislation, making it unlikely the bill can secure the 60 votes it would need to advance. President Joe Biden previously endorsed the border provisions, and while Trump and other Republicans have called it too weak, the bill would have marked a tough change to immigration law and would have given the president far-reaching powers to restrict\u00a0illegal migrant crossings at the southern border. The White House and top Democrats have discussed taking more action on the border ahead of the first presidential debate next month, CNN previously reported. Those plans, intended to strengthen the party\u2019s hand on a critical campaign issue ahead of the 2024 election, also potentially include a sweeping executive order limiting migrants\u2019 ability to seek asylum, sources have told CNN.

{"id": "2024_05_19_business_uber-lyft-drivers-pay-minnesota", "text": "Minnesota government officials have struck a deal with rideshare companies Uber and Lyft to set minimum wage standards for drivers, lawmakers announced Saturday night. The agreement is the culmination of nearly a year of back and forth between Democratic state officials and the two companies, who threatened to withdraw their businesses from Minnesota over a proposed Minneapolis ordinance that would grant rideshare drivers increased worker protections. The ordinance, initially adopted in August 2023, was part of a larger effort to grant more comprehensive benefits to contract workers, who take freelance work at digital platforms like DoorDash, Instacart, Uber and Lyft. It mandated drivers be paid at least $1.40 per mile and $0.51 per minute. The rule was delayed after Lyft and Uber warned they would leave Minneapolis. State lawmakers have been focused on compromising with the companies before a July 1 deadline. Under the new agreement, the statewide minimum wage rate for rideshare drivers will be $1.28 per mile and $0.31 per minute. The rule will override the higher rate the Minneapolis City Council had initially proposed. \u201cWhen you take it as a blended rate, that results in a 20% increase in pay for drivers in the state of Minnesota,\u201d the state\u2019s Democratic House Majority Leader Jamie Long told reporters Saturday night. The bill also includes the \u201cstrongest insurance provision for drivers in the entire country,\u201d Long added. \u201cIt was a hard-fought compromise,\u201d said Democratic Senate Majority Leader Erin Murphy, acknowledging negotiations over pay had to toe the line between addressing the needs of employees and the need of Minnesotans who rely on rideshare services for transportation. \u201cWe applaud the tens of thousands of riders & drivers who sent close to 100,000 emails to legislators \u2014 your voices were heard. While the coming price increases may hurt riders and drivers alike, we will be able to continue to operate across the State under the compromise brokered by the Governor,\u201d Uber\u2019s policy director Josh Gold said in a statement.

{"id": "2024_05_19_us_pennsylvania-pastor-glenn-germany-church-safety", "text": "In the years Pastor Glenn Germany has been leading the small congregation at Jesus\u2019 Dwelling Place, keeping the Pennsylvania church\u2019s doors open has been a struggle. Germany, a full-time bus driver and full-time pastor, knows how important this church is to its community. In addition to religious services, the church \u2013 in the North Braddock borough southeast of Pittsburgh \u2013 provides its primarily low and fixed-income congregants with housing advice, domestic violence and mental health awareness programs, and seminars on everything from improving health to credit scores. To keep it all running, Germany and his family give more than $1,000 out of pocket every month. And now, it seems there\u2019s another critical expense, though one this small church hardly could afford: security. It\u2019s been exactly two weeks since an armed intruder walked into Jesus\u2019 Dwelling Place, pointed a gun at Germany\u2019s head and pulled the trigger, the horrific scene captured via a livestream of the Sunday service. When the gunman tried to fire, though, his weapon jammed, giving the pastor and a cameraman enough time to rush and subdue the suspect until authorities came. Police have not shared what may have motivated the gunman to target the pastor. Germany has said the shooter told him \u201cspirits\u201d got into his head. Then less than a week later, parishioners in south Louisiana helped remove a 16-year-old boy who walked into a Catholic church armed with a gun. The two incidents came roughly three months after law enforcement killed a woman who opened fire inside Lakewood Church in Houston; a 57-year-old man and the shooter\u2019s 7-year-old son were wounded. Now, Germany wants to hire security experts to assess his church\u2019s vulnerability and see how they can secure it. But in the two weeks since the thwarted attack, the church has only been able to raise just over $1,000 in donations, the pastor said. Experts told CNN safety additions such as vulnerability assessments, training, cameras and security personnel can cost several thousand dollars. \u201cIt costs money to hire people, and we don\u2019t have the money,\u201d Germany said. It\u2019s a challenge for religious communities across the US as churches, synagogues, mosques and other places of worship face threats or come under attack in a nation with more guns than people and where shots often explode in places that should be safe. US Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer this month announced an additional $400 million in federal money to help boost security at places of worship. Many places of worship have struggled to balance security while maintaining a warm, welcoming feeling for their attendees. And Germany\u2019s challenges highlight just how much harder conversations around security can be for smaller congregations. \u2018Nothing is sacred, secure or safe\u2019 In San Antonio, the faithful at Pastor Kevin Nelson\u2019s Calvary Baptist Church began new conversations around security after the attack on Lakewood Church, the megachurch of famed televangelist Joel Osteen. Nelson\u2019s church already has cameras and an alarm system \u2013 but those were primarily installed to thwart car break-ins, he said. Calvary Baptist, with roughly 300 regular service attendees, also enlists deacons and other church members who carry concealed weapons to monitor the single entrance it keeps open during services, Nelson said. And it hosts active shooter trainings led by the local sheriff\u2019s office. But now, all that doesn\u2019t feel like enough. \u201cI don\u2019t want our church to become almost like a bank, to where you pull up and you see the police, so I\u2019m really wrestling,\u201d Nelson, a former deputy with the sheriff\u2019s department, told CNN. \u201cBut in the same sense, God\u2019s people and God\u2019s house have to be protected.\u201d Not too far away is an ever-persistent reminder of the threat: Calvary Baptist is just about a 40-minute drive from Sutherland Springs, where a shooter killed 26 people inside a community church in 2017.\u00a0It remains the state\u2019s deadliest mass shooting. Nelson\u2019s church is now considering hiring armed guards, he said. Its leaders are also looking into the federal grant money Schumer announced, though it is a new process requiring time and research, Nelson said. And since the Lakewood Church shooting, during which the attacker walked in with her young son and a rifle, churchgoers at Calvary Baptist have been instructed to be watchful of families entering services, he said. \u201cWhat we\u2019re discovering,\u201d Nelson said, \u201cis nothing is sacred, secure or safe.\u201d Donell Trusty Jr., who provides security and firearms training for places of worship in Maryland through his company Trusty Training Solutions, has seen an uptick in phone calls from churches\u00a0since the attempted shooting in Pennsylvania two weeks ago, he said. Trusty, who is also an elder in his Baltimore church, said he also helps churches contract security officers. He also helps train church volunteers who are licensed to carry weapons in firearm safety, self-defense and situational awareness, he told CNN. Typically, Trusty said, hiring security personnel can cost between $35 and $50 per person hourly. Training courses usually cost $250 to $300 per person, he said. To help out local congregations, Trusty\u2019s company has begun offering free active shooter training to places of worship. \u201cIt is our way of giving back to the local assemblies because it\u2019s what\u2019s needed,\u201d he said. \u201cWe understand the financial crises of the pandemic, membership has been low in a lot of churches \u2026 (and) they don\u2019t really have the finances to put out for some expensive training program.\u201d And active shooter training can help save lives. Rabbi Charlie Cytron-Walker has credited his training in this arena for helping him make a daring escape in 2022 after a hostage-taker joined a worship service at Congregation Beth Israel in Texas. As the attack approached its 11th hour, the rabbi spotted a key moment when the gunman\u2019s guard was down \u2013 just as he had learned in training \u2013 and told others to run, then grabbed a chair and threw it at the assailant, giving the hostages enough time to escape with their lives. Churches now should take an opportunity to renew conversations around safety, conduct risk assessments and reevaluate their security procedures, said Bishop Vashti Murphy McKenzie, interim president and general secretary of the National Council of the Churches of Christ in the USA, which represents more than 100,000 congregations. Among factors to consider are identifying church members with a background in law enforcement, the military or security, McKenzie said. Other key steps include conducting drills, ensuring all church members know where the nearest exit is or where to go during an emergency, and knowing who would contact authorities if needed, McKenzie said. \u201cSurely, we would all love to believe that it\u2019s not going to happen here, it\u2019s not going to be us. But why take the chance? Let\u2019s prepare,\u201d she said. Every year, the Churches of Christ council hosts discussions \u2013 including about security \u2013 for leaders of Jewish, Muslim, Hindu, Christian and other faiths, McKenzie said. In those spaces, she added, religious leaders have an opportunity to \u201ccompare notes\u201d and learn from each other. A difficult balance for many pastors Nelson, in San Antonio, often thinks about nearby smaller congregations that typically don\u2019t have the financial or human resources to bolster security measures in the same way his church can, he said. He encourages churches to station at least one person to monitor each entrance, and he has tried to spread the word about the federal grant program. Schumer, too, noted the additional challenges smaller congregations face. \u201cFEMA has people who will help if you\u2019re a small synagogue or a small church or a small mosque and you don\u2019t have a grant writer, you don\u2019t know what to do,\u201d he said. Schumer\u2019s May 5 news conference followed a series of hoax bomb threats the prior day against New York synagogues, he said. Places of worship that apply for federal money for bolstered security, such as guards and fences, may be able to get those resources within \u201cmonths,\u201d Schumer said, pointing potential grant recipients to the agency\u2019s website and urging them to apply by Tuesday. Florida-based security company SecureTek Service Group Inc. has been helping low-resource places of worship, including Germany\u2019s church, navigate applications for grants and other types of funding, its founder Rico Reed told CNN. Often, churches with little funding don\u2019t know what kinds of resources are available, and security additions can be costly, with vulnerability assessments in some cases reaching up to $2,000, while camera systems can cost several thousand dollars, he said. \u201cA House of Worship is supposed to be a safe place,\u201d Reed said. \u201cBut it\u2019s actually a soft target. And it takes a while for people that are part of the congregation to understand that times have changed. And it\u2019s really dangerous.\u201d In Tennessee, Lori Morrison has long been talking about the importance of church security, on both her website and her podcast. A former private investigator and now a volunteer on her own church\u2019s security team, Morrison said there\u2019s a tough balance between keeping a church secure and welcoming. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to lock the doors and issue passes,\u201d she said. \u201cBut you can take those common sense precautions.\u201d At her church, team members observe people as they arrive, while others check badges in sensitive areas, like the children\u2019s section, to ensure only approved members enter. There are also trainings throughout the year on safety and preparation for medical emergencies, Morrison said. \u201cWe are supposed to look out for (congregants\u2019) well-being, and so we have to make sure that we\u2019re doing that at the same time that we\u2019re maintaining that openness,\u201d she said. In Pennsylvania, Germany admits he worried before the attempted shooting some parishioners would feel uncomfortable with officers around, or added security could make the church less welcoming. But two weeks ago, someone tried to kill him, he said. And he worries it may happen again. Now, his focus is to make his church safe. He hopes to raise more money, get help to apply for grants, and take all the measures necessary to ensure his community can practice its faith in peace. He hopes other churches \u2013 big and small \u2013 do the same. \u201cI would encourage other churches to use our video as just a springboard to start having thoughts about church security,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause you never think it\u2019s going to happen to you \u2013 until it happens to you.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/19/us/pennsylvania-pastor-glenn-germany-church-safety/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/20/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_05_18_us_dali-ship-baltimore-bridge-refloats", "text": "Almost two months after its devastating collision with a Baltimore bridge, the trapped cargo ship Dali will refloat and travel to the Baltimore marine terminal on Monday morning, officials said. After weeks of salvage operations, the Dali can finally be relocated thanks to a\u00a0series of controlled explosions\u00a0which broke apart a massive piece of the Francis Scott Bridge that had been stuck atop the ship\u2019s bow, officials said. An estimated 500-foot section of the bridge weighing 8-12 million pounds was removed from the ship. \u201cThe\u00a0refloat\u00a0and transit sequence is deliberately designed to ensure all response personnel around the M/V Dali maintain control of the vessel, from\u00a0refloat, transit to, and berthing at a local marine terminal,\u201d Unified Command said in a\u00a0news release\u00a0Saturday. Conditions permitting, the massive ship\u2019s journey will begin around 5 a.m. on Monday during peak high tide, according to Unified Command. Crews will begin prepping the ship about 18 hours before \u2013 about midday on Sunday \u2013 to take full advantage of the high tide, officials added. Up to five tugboats will then tow and push the Dali about two and a half miles to the\u00a0Seagirt Marine Terminal in Baltimore, the release said. It will take an estimated three hours to transport the 984-foot, 106,000-ton ship. Maryland Gov. Wes Moore said Sunday he expects to have the channel reopened by the end of the month. \u201cI\u2019m proud that we\u2019re on track that by the end of May we\u2019ll have that federal channel reopened,\u201d Moore said on NBC\u2019s Meet the Press. \u201cAnd within days, we\u2019re going to have that massive vessel, the\u00a0Dali, out of that federal channel.\u201d The cargo ship collided with the bridge in the early hours of March 26, killing six maintenance workers and causing most of the structure to collapse into the Patapsco River. The disaster shut down most shipping to and from the Port of Baltimore. The crash has prompted multiple investigations, including by the FBI and the US Coast Guard. The ship\u2019s 21-member crew has remained onboard since the collapse, including during the planned explosions on May 13. The ship\u2019s management company told CNN this week the crew will remain on the vessel for \u201cthe foreseeable future.\u201d According to Barbara Shipley, mid-Atlantic labor representative for the International Transport Workers\u2019 Federation, there is no plan for what the crew will do once the Dali is escorted back to port on Monday. She said the crew\u2019s visas have all expired and the union is waiting for direction from immigration authorities to figure out next steps. She told CNN the crew members are trying to keep their spirits high despite being disconnected from their friends and families. The FBI confiscated the men\u2019s cell phones as part of their ongoing investigation. \u201cIt\u2019s been since April 15, they still haven\u2019t received their cell phones,\u201d Shipley said. \u201cNo one has received their cell phones, they did receive some SIM cards, but not all.\u201d Shipley said her priority \u201cwould be to have the decisions made quickly, which crew members will need to stay behind, and\u00a0which crew members can go home, and it\u2019s important to get these gentlemen back home to their families,\u201d Shipley said. \u201cAs far as I know, no one\u2019s been charged with anything and we\u2019re holding them. They can\u2019t go home because they\u2019re still under investigation. So I would like to see the investigation be expedited so we can get these gentlemen home.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/18/us/dali-ship-baltimore-bridge-refloats/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/20/2024", "section": "us"}}
