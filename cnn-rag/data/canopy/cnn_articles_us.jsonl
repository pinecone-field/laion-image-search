Lorincz, a 58-year-old White woman, is charged with manslaughter with a firearm and assault related to the June 2, 2023, shooting of her Black neighbor, Ajike \u201cAJ\u201d Owens, who had been knocking on Lorincz\u2019s door. Investigators have said Lorincz became angry because several neighborhood children, including Owens\u2019 children, were playing near her home. In the video, released Monday by the Marion County Sheriff\u2019s Office, Lorincz during the nearly two-hour long interrogation repeatedly\u00a0tells\u00a0two detectives she was in fear of her life during the incident and she recalled Owens saying \u201cI\u2019m gonna kill you.\u201d \u201cI just remember being terrified that she was banging and screaming and just, I just remember hearing her say, \u2018I\u2019m going to kill you,\u2019\u201d Lorincz tells detectives, as also described in\u00a0the affidavit in the case. \u201cI was in fear for my life. I mean, honest to God, I just feared that she was going to come through that door. I\u2019m sorry. That\u2019s how I felt. I can\u2019t change the way I felt. I mean, it was sheer terror on my part,\u201d Lorincz adds. Detectives tell Lorincz no one they had interviewed had made statements about Owens saying that she wanted to kill Lorincz. \u201cThese people said that she was saying to come outside,\u201d the video shows one detective telling Lorincz. \u201cShe wanted to confront you about something, she wanted you to come outside.\u201d The Owens family previously told CNN Lorincz harassed Owens and her children and used racial slurs toward them prior to the killing. Lorincz admitted using racial slurs against neighborhood children in the past, according to an\u00a0arrest affidavit. The video also shows detectives asking Lorincz whether she had searched Florida laws on self-defense and \u201cstand your ground,\u201d to which she replied she had searched the topic earlier in the day, after she saw \u201cthey had it up on Facebook.\u201d \u201cI know what you\u2019re thinking \u2013 that I looked at the laws so I could do something. No,\u201d Lorincz tells detectives. Before placing Lorincz under arrest, detectives explain that her actions the day of the shooting did not appear reasonable. \u201cFrom everything I\u2019ve seen, it doesn\u2019t rise to the level for you to justify shooting through a closed door and with a firearm, OK. And I think you know that that wasn\u2019t reasonable what you did,\u201d one of the detectives says, questioning why the shot that killed Owens was fired only two minutes after Lorincz got off the phone with a dispatcher while calling 911 and requesting police. \u201cTwo minutes \u2013 to me it was much longer,\u201d Lorincz says. At the end of the interrogation, the video shows Lorincz being given the opportunity to write Owens\u2019 children a note, which she does while waiting for deputies to return. When deputies return to transport Lorincz to jail, the video shows she initially refuses arrest, repeatedly saying \u201cI can\u2019t do this,\u201d and exclaiming \u201cI don\u2019t care. Kill me!\u201d She eventually stands up and is handcuffed. Jury selection in the case against Lorincz is set to begin June 17, court records show.

{"id": "2024_06_14_media_infowars-alex-jones-liquidation-ruling", "text": "A Texas bankruptcy judge\u00a0has\u00a0rejected a proposed liquidation of\u00a0conspiracy theorist\u00a0Alex Jones\u2019\u00a0company\u00a0Free Speech Systems, the parent company of Infowars, saying that a denial of the bankruptcy plan was, in his opinion, in the best interest of the creditors. But the judge approved a separate liquidation of Jones\u2019 personal assets. Judge Chris Lopez said the Infowars bankruptcy process had dragged on and that it needed to stop \u201cincurring costs\u201d and let the families of Sandy Hook victims try to claim what they are owed through state courts. The families have not received payment of the approximately $1.5 billion in damages against Jones that they have won after he lied about the 2012 school massacre. \u201cThe right call is to dismiss this case,\u201d\u00a0Lopez said Friday. Lopez made his ruling in a\u00a0lengthy\u00a0decision\u00a0where he seemed emotional at times, once even noting the timing of this decision being made shortly before Father\u2019s Day. \u201cI think it needed to happen,\u201d he said towards the end of the hearing. \u201cI wish I would\u2019ve picked a better day.\u201d Unanswered questions The rejection of the bankruptcy plan leaves many questions to sort out in the decision\u2019s wake. Among them: What happens next for Infowars? And what legal avenues remain for the victims\u2019 families to collect the massive sum Jones still owes them? This judgment could be viewed as a partial victory for Jones, who fought the liquidation proposal \u2013 but so too did some families, whose attorneys said they\u2019ll benefit more from the bankruptcy plan\u2019s dismissal by going after Jones\u2019 assets immediately \u2013 rather than waiting for a prolonged bankruptcy procedure to play out. That ruling leaves Free Speech Systems to face its creditors outside of bankruptcy in state courts, noted Marie Reilly, professor of bankruptcy law at Penn State University. In a statement, an attorney for the families said they would press on. \u201cToday is a good day. Alex Jones has lost ownership of Infowars, the corrupt business he has used for years to attack the Connecticut families and so many others,\u201d said Chris Mattei, an attorney for the families. \u201cThe Court authorized us to move immediately to collect against all Infowars assets, and we intend to do exactly that.\u201d Lopez noted that the case is far from over. The interim trustee, and later the permanent trustee\ufeff, in Jones\u2019 personal case will ultimately decided Infowars\u2019 fate. \u201cThose trustees will make decisions about where things go,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not leaving thing\ufeffs into the wind here.\u201d Jay Westbrook, a University of Texas bankruptcy law professor, said that Infowars could still be sold by the court-appointed trustee to pay some of the damages owed to the families, but it would likely not fetch a high price. \u201cJones owns [Free Speech Systems] and thus his bankruptcy trustee could sell it, but without his active promotion it may be of little value, except for its inventory of products he has been selling,\u201d Westbrook said. Jones\u00a0had been\u00a0opposed to liquidating\u00a0Infowars and in recent days ranted on his show about what could be its impending shutdown, urging his audience to buy his products to support him. \u201cI\u2019m going to try to move forward and maximize the amount of money we can make at Info\ufeffwars to then have a wind-down,\u201d Jones said outside the court house after the hearing Friday. Jones\u2019 attorney, Vickie Driver, applauded the decision, saying the judge was fair in his review of the unique aspects of the case. \u201cMr. Jones did everything he could to preserve as much value as he could in Free Speech Systems to pay the plaintiffs,\u201d Driver said. Westbrook said if Jones continues at Infowars, it could maximize the amount of money the victims families could draw from it. \u201cThe problem is that Jones\u2019 appeal to his audience, awful as it is to say it, is probably the only thing of value he has that is not exempt in Texas and it is very difficult to make him use it to benefit anyone else,\u201d Westbrook said. Jones\u2019 personal bankruptcy approved Earlier on Friday, Lopez approved the liquidation of\u00a0Jones\u2019 personal assets after the conspiracy theorist agreed to convert\u00a0his personal bankruptcy into a Chapter 7 liquidation last week. The liquidation means that Jones will immediately lose control of his property except for certain exempt property, such as a $2 million house in Austin. Jones\u2019 decision to seek bankruptcy protection comes after he agreed to demands from the families of Sandy Hook victims. The judge said an interim trustee will be appointed to oversee Jones\u2019 estate, as is standard in these cases. Jones\u2019 attorney Vickie Driver told the court $2.8 million from the sale of Jones\u2019 ranch could be sent to the trustee. Jones founded Infowars, an influential conspiracy empire, in the late 1990s. Over the years, Jones has used the media company to poison the public discourse with lies and conspiracy theories, and he also enriched himself, making millions of dollars in the process. Whatever proceeds are gained from Jones\u2019 personal bankruptcy will amount to just a fraction of what he owes families of Sandy Hook victims. The families argued to the court that there is \u201cno prospect\u201d the Jones\u2019 company could produce a proper reorganization plan under a Chapter 11 bankruptcy, which would allow the company to remain operational through its restructuring. The judge\u2019s rulings on Friday would not prevent Jones from spreading conspiracy theories and lies online. X CEO Elon Musk restored Jones\u2019 social media account in December 2023 after a five-year ban from the platform. And Jones could go on any number of far-right outlets to share his outlandish views. But the Sandy Hook families are hoping\u00a0to seize Jones\u2019 social media accounts, arguing they are a key part of his Infowars business that allow Jones to promote his brand. And Jones may not be welcome at some venues: He had been listed as a guest on the Milwaukee stop on Tucker Carlson\u2019s live tour but was recently dropped from the lineup without explanation. Lies and conspiracy theories Since founding Infowars in the late 1990s, Jones has pushed several conspiracy theories, including the lie that the 2012 Newtown, Connecticut, mass school shooting was a so-called \u201cfalse flag\u201d operation staged by the government and that the grieving family members of 20 child victims were \u201cactors.\u201d\u00a0Jones makes money on those conspiracy theories by hawking high-priced dietary supplements to his audience. The mood Friday on Jones\u2019 Infowars was somber, with the far-right outlet\u2019s hosts speculating on its future. Chase Geiser, an Infowars host who had driven with Jones to the courthouse where the bankruptcy hearing was underway, made a brief appearance on the outlet, attempting to twist the judge\u2019s decision as one that would net Jones an even larger audience. Jones\u2019 regularly scheduled program was replaced with previously recorded interviews, airing conversations with Tucker Carlson and Russell Brand.

Rangers found her body Saturday. The search for the skier had been ongoing since May 19, with groups of rangers and volunteers scouring the park for tracks, the National Park Service said in a news release. An unresponsive person was spotted from a helicopter and rangers recovered the body using \u201ctraditional crevasse rescue methods,\u201d the release said. The woman appeared to have fallen roughly 200 feet to the base of Moraine Falls, above the area of Paradise, according to the release. It did not identify the woman. Favorable weather was needed for the helicopter search and the recovery of the body to take place, park officials said. The skier\u2019s body was taken to the Pierce County Medical Examiner\u2019s Office for evaluation. It\u2019s the second death reported in the park in less than a month. Brian Harper, 41, who collapsed near the summit of Mount Rainier on May 31, was in a climbing group led by Alpine Ascents International, a licensed guide service, the park service said. Efforts to perform CPR were unsuccessful, according to a news release. Weather conditions did not become suitable for Harper\u2019s body to be brought down until the next day.

Michael Christian\u00a0Green was sentenced to the maximum penalty for a federal misdemeanor for acting under color of law\u00a0to deprive a person of their civil rights.\u00a0The former Pearl Police Department officer\u00a0plead guilty in March\u00a0and is scheduled to\u00a0report to the Federal Bureau of Prisons on July 26.

After not receiving a response, the man urinated in a corner. When Green was later told about the urine, he demanded the arrestee lick the urine, threatening to beat him with a phone, the complaint said.

{"id": "2024_06_14_business_wells-fargo-staff-wfh-nightcap", "text": "The pandemic may have released us from the tyranny of the five-day-a-week office schedule. But the grip of America\u2019s busy-work culture is proving harder to shake. See here: Wells Fargo this week disclosed that it had fired more than a dozen employees for \u201csimulation of keyboard activity,\u201d Bloomberg reported, citing filings to the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. CNN confirmed that multiple people were let go after a review of allegations that they created an \u201cimpression of active work.\u201d In other words, they were faking work, perhaps with the kind of mouse jiggler that you can buy online for $20. Those devices \u2014 which keep your screen active and move your cursor in convincingly random ways \u2014 took off during the early days of the pandemic. With employees no longer huddled together under fluorescent lighting, eating sad desk salads, bosses suddenly had to wonder whether their teams were actually working or slacking off. Even though most workers said they were more productive from home, many executives\u00a0 adopted \u201cbossware\u201d to monitor their staff\u2019s laptops. (And to be fair, yes \u2014 sometimes we did step away, selfishly tending to our own personal business, like walking the dog or staring out the window while contemplating our mortality. We hope you can forgive us.) At any rate, some bankers over at Wells Fargo seem to have gotten caught last month. It\u2019s not clear whether they were working from home or from a beach, or what they were doing instead of working. A bank spokesperson declined to offer more details about the firings, saying only that \u201cWells Fargo holds employees to the highest standards and does not tolerate unethical behavior.\u201d I have two immediate thoughts \u2022 Oh, come on, the highest standards? (More on that in a moment.)\u2022 We are four years into this remote/hybrid experiment, and some bosses still haven\u2019t figured out how to treat their workers like adults. \u201cThe sad part is that employees feel the need to purchase and use a mouse jiggler,\u201d Ashley Herd, founder of management training firm Manager Method, tells me. \u201cAnd that\u2019s a symptom of a much larger problem.\u201d In Wells Fargo\u2019s case, managerial mistrust would be understandable, given the bank\u2019s history. Since 2016, Wells has spent billions of dollars settling civil and criminal charges related to a multiyear scheme that led to more than 2 million fake accounts being opened without customers\u2019 consent or knowledge \u2014 a practice that began when managers began setting unrealistic sales goals for employees. Last year, the former head of the bank\u2019s retail operation was sentenced to three years of probation, while the bank\u2019s former CEO was banned from the industry. Since then, Wells has been trying to reform its own internal culture while trying to repair its brand. It\u2019s not hard to understand why it would want to keep some close tabs on its roughly 200,000 employees. Banks in particular have strict controls on work-issued devices because the industry is so tightly regulated. But firing people over mouse movers may not be the best way to foster a culture of trust and inclusion. \u201cManagers often assume the worst when they see someone\u2019s away, and so they\u2019re looking for any type of data to show that that\u2019s true,\u201d Herd says. \u201cSo, team members are going to innovate around that.\u201d \u2014CNN\u2019s Matt Egan contributed reporting.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/14/business/wells-fargo-staff-wfh-nightcap/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/15/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_12_us_tulsa-race-massacre-lawsuit-dismissed-reaj", "text": "The Oklahoma Supreme Court dismissed a lawsuit arguing the remaining survivors of the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre should be compensated by the city for damages Wednesday, dealing a blow to their ongoing fight for reparations more than 100 years after the attack. Survivors Hughes Van Ellis, Viola Fletcher and Lessie Benningfield Randle initally filed the lawsuit in 2021. Ellis died last year at the age of 102. The lawsuit was previously dismissed by an Oklahoma district court judge, who agreed with the city of Tulsa that \u201csimply being connected to a historical event does not provide a person with unlimited rights to seek compensation.\u201d The plaintiffs appealed the case to the state\u2019s Supreme Court which acknowledged Wednesday that the \u201cgrievance with the social and economic inequities created by the Tulsa Race Massacre is legitimate and worthy of merit.\u201d \u201cHowever, the law does not permit us to extend the scope of our public nuisance doctrine beyond what the Legislature has authorized to afford Plaintiffs the justice they are seeking,\u201d the court wrote in its decision. Ellis, Fletcher and Benningfifeld Randle had argued that they had a right for reparations under the city\u2019s public nuisance statute. They also said the city of Tulsa was getting \u201cunjust enrichment\u201d by promoting the site of the massacre as a tourist attraction \u201cwithout returning any of those benefits to members of the community.\u201d \u201cThe destruction of forty-square blocks of property on the night of May 31, 1921 through murder and arson clearly meets the definition of a public nuisance under Oklahoma law.\u00a0Faithful application of the law compels the conclusion that Mother Randle and Mother Fletcher have stated a claim for relief,\u201d attorneys for Fletcher and Benningfield Randle said in a statement after the decision. \u201cThey are entitled\u00a0to\u00a0a trial.\u00a0Yet the Court held that Mother Randle and Mother Fletcher have asked the Court\u00a0to\u00a0decide a \u2018political\u2019 question that is beyond the purview of the Court,\u201d the attorneys added. In 1921, the Greenwood neighborhood was a thriving Black-owned business district in Tulsa, Oklahoma. On May 31, 1921, a White mob laid waste to about 35 blocks of the neighborhood within 16 hours, arresting thousands of Black residents, while robbing, beating and killing others, CNN previously reported. Historic photos show entire blocks gutted by flame and people lying in the street. Insurance companies later denied many claims filed by Black business owners over what today would be worth tens of millions of dollars in property damage, including the destruction of two Black hospitals and 1,256 residences, according to the Greenwood Cultural Center, CNN previously reported. Attorneys for Fletcher and Benningfield Randle said in their statement that they plan to file a petition for rehearing with the Oklahoma Supreme Court, asking the Court\u00a0to\u00a0reconsider its decision. They also called on the US Department of Justice\u00a0to\u00a0open an investigation into the\u00a0massacre\u00a0under the Emmett Till Unsolved Civil Rights Crime Act of 2007. Viola Ford\u00a0Fletcher, 109, previously told CNN if she and her family had not been forced to leave their home and community with essentially just the clothes on their backs, \u201cI would\u2019ve gotten an education, to where I could get a better job, especially being a nurse.\u201d Fletcher told CNN she \u201cnever got over\u201d what she experienced that day and still remembers \u201cpeople getting killed, houses, property, schools, churches, and stores getting destroyed with fire.\u201d \u201cIt just stays with me, you know, just the fear. I have lived in Tulsa since but I don\u2019t sleep all night living there.\u201d Lessie Benningfield Randle\u2019s family previously urged the court to \u201chonor\u201d the survivors \u201cwhile they are still with us.\u201d\u00a0They noted that Ellis, also\u00a0known as Uncle Redd, \u201cwaged this (legal) battle until his final breath.\u201d \u201cWe must not allow the stories of the LAST TWO SURVIVORS to be buried alongside them. Justice for Mother Randle and Mother Fletcher is overdue!\u201d In a previous legal brief filed in the case, Attorney Damario Solomon-Simmons aruged the Oklahoma Supreme Court could be the survivors remaining opportunity to receive justice after all these years. \u201cThere is no going to the United States Supreme Court. There is no going to the federal court system.

{"id": "2024_04_17_us_massachusetts-satanic-temple-bombing-arrest", "text": "A suspect has been arrested for allegedly throwing a pipe bomb that damaged The Satanic Temple headquarters in Salem, Massachusetts, where investigators found a letter addressed, \u201cDear Satanist\u201d at the scene last week, prosecutors announced. Sean Patrick Palmer, 49, of Perkins, Oklahoma, was arrested Wednesday morning and has been charged with using fire or an explosive to damage a building used in interstate or foreign commerce during the April 8 incident, the US Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of Massachusetts said. CNN has been unable to identify an attorney for Palmer. Surveillance cameras captured a person igniting and throwing a pipe bomb over a fence and onto the covered porch of The\u00a0Satanic\u00a0Temple building at approximately 4:14 a.m., according to an affidavit written by an FBI agent. The explosive partially detonated and caused minor fire damage to the exterior of the building, according to the document. No one was in the building at the time and staff discovered the damage later that day, according to Salem police. The makeshift device was constructed using a plastic pipe covered with taped-on metal nails and filled with what was preliminarily identified as smokeless gunpowder, the affidavit said. The surveillance footage also showed the man throwing a small item into the building\u2019s flower bed, where investigators later found a handwritten note, the affidavit said. The note, addressed \u201cDear Satanist,\u201d references Elohim, a Hebrew name for God, and appears to allude to an incident of vandalism at the building last year, the affidavit said. The letter reads, in part, \u201cElohim send me 7 months ago to give you peaceful message to hope you repent. You say no, Elohim now send me to smite Satan and I happy to obey,\u201d according to the affidavit. About 7 months ago, on September 11, the Satanic Temple headquarters was vandalized with Bible verses spray painted in white, according to the affidavit. Palmer had not been charged in connection with that incident as of Wednesday. Investigators also identified a car appearing to belong to Palmer that was in the area at the time of the incident, as well as a 2018 photo on the suspect\u2019s Facebook that shows him wearing a tan vest similar to one worn by the man in the video, prosecutors said. If found guilty, Palmer faces up to 20 years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000, prosecutors said. Palmer will make an initial appearance in an Oklahoma district court on Thursday and is expected to appear in federal court in Boston at a later date, according to prosecutors. The\u00a0Satanic\u00a0Temple\u2019s social media accounts say it\u2019s \u201cthe only federally recognized international (non-theistic) religious Satanic organization.\u201d Its Salem headquarters are located in a former funeral parlor, where it maintains an art gallery with a permanent exhibit on Satanism, witch hunts and moral panic, its\u00a0website says. Members also perform ceremonial events and hold meetings and lectures in the space. In a news release, Salem police said the headquarters has been the target of bomb threats and possible hate crimes in the past, including a June 2022 incident during which a man was arrested on suspicion of arson, they said. Earlier this year, a Michigan man also was arrested and charged in his state with planning to bomb the temple, according to the release. In a statement on the arrest Wednesday, The Satanic Temple expressed thanks to police and federal investigators and \u201cprofound gratitude to the Salem community for the outpouring of support we have received during this challenging period.\u201d CNN\u2019s Zenebou Sylla contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/17/us/massachusetts-satanic-temple-bombing-arrest/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/15/2024", "section": "us"}}

Callihan\u2019s alleged accomplice, Victoria Cox, 32, was arrested on Friday at a motel in south Jackson, Jackson Police Chief Joseph Wade said.

After hours of searching, law enforcement in Jackson, Mississippi \u2013 about a 2-hour drive from Tangipahoa \u2013 tracked down the suspect and found a \u201ctragic scene,\u201d Wade said. After a short pursuit, Callihan was arrested in a wooded area near a house and the 4-year-old\u2019s body was found unburied in the woods behind the home, according to Wade. The other sister was found injured and was taken to a hospital. \u201cIt\u2019s very, very disturbing to me as a police chief and as a father to witness and see what I just saw,\u201d Wade said of the scene. An autopsy will be conducted to determine the exact cause of death, Wade said Friday. Due to signs of \u201csome human trafficking done\u201d at the location, Jackson authorities have reached out to human trafficking divisions with the Mississippi Bureau of Investigation and Hinds County, Wade said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to work this crime scene with a scalpel,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take a long time to process it.\u201d Many questions still remain, Wade said, including why Callihan allegedly took the children to Jackson and why the child was killed. Though Callihan had yet to be interviewed Thursday evening, investigators believe the suspect lives in Louisiana and had dated Brunett \u201coff and on,\u201d Travis said. When the Amber Alert was issued Thursday, it said a man, later identified as Callihan, was wanted \u201cfor questioning for a domestic violence incident, which occurred at the time of the abduction and resulted in a homicide.\u201d Investigators\u2019 top priority will be to interview Callihan and care for the surviving 6-year-old victim, Travis said. \u201cShe\u2019s been through something that most of us, hopefully, never ever get to experience. And she is going to have to spend the rest of her life living with this,\u201d the chief said. Police said Cox was compliant during her arrest and will be held accountable for her actions in the \u201chorrific event.\u201d \u201cShe could be possibly facing capital murder charges along with him or accessory before or after the fact,\u201d Wade said. \u201cWe have to bring justice for the loss of this child.\u201d CNN has reached out to the Jackson Police Department and the\u00a0Tangipahoa Parish Sheriff\u2019s Office\u00a0for more information. A GoFundMe was created \u201cin loving support of the Brunett family in a time of unimaginable suffering\u201d to raise money for funeral costs for Brunett and her 4-year-old daughter, and to help support the family and surviving child navigate the tragedy.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/14/us/louisiana-callie-brunett-murder-suspect-arrest/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/15/2024", "section": "us"}}

The attorneys continued, comparing the request to the gag order Trump is under in a separate case in New York, adding, \u201cLike Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, Smith seeks to restrict President Trump\u2019s campaign speech as the first presidential debate approaches at the end of this month.\u201d In late May, attorneys for Smith asked the judge presiding to \u201cmake clear\u201d that Trump cannot \u201cmake statements that pose a significant, imminent, and foreseeable danger to law enforcement agents participating in the investigation and prosecution of this case.\u201d The heart of their concern, prosecutors wrote, was Trump\u2019s \u201cfalse and inflammatory statements\u201d when he claimed that FBI agents were ready to shoot him and that he \u201cnearly escaped death\u201d during the 2022 search of Mar-a-Lago. The former president was in New York at the time. Trump\u2019s claims, based on the FBI\u2019s plan for the search \u2013\u00a0which was provided to the defense in discovery \u2013 are entirely false, prosecutors wrote, adding that Trump has repeatedly and misleadingly criticized the FBI for having a policy in place around the use of deadly force during the search, as the bureau does with \u201ccountless\u201d warrants that it executes. The FBI and Attorney General Merrick Garland have both said the policy is normal and was also in place during the search of President Joe Biden\u2019s Delaware residence during the investigation into his handling of classified information. In the filing Friday, Trump\u2019s attorneys said prosecutors have not submitted \u201cany evidence of threats or harassment resulting from President Trump\u2019s protected speech.\u201d \u201cNot a single FBI agent who participated in the raid submitted an affidavit, or even an argument, claiming that President Trump\u2019s remarks put them at risk,\u201d his attorneys wrote. Prosecutors\u2019 original ask for a gag order was thrown out by Federal Judge Aileen Cannon, who determined that they had not fully conferred with Trump\u2019s attorneys before filing the request. Trump\u2019s false claims \u201cinvite\u201d threats and harassment against law enforcement agents involved in the case, prosecutors wrote, similar to those \u201cthat have occurred when other participants in legal proceedings against Trump have been targeted by his invective.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/14/politics/trump-gag-order-classified-documents-florida/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/15/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_12_us_sandy-hook-survivors-graduate-high-school", "text": "High school seniors Emma Ehrens and Grace Fischer will hear their names read out today as they are called to collect their diplomas and start the next chapter of their lives. But they are also steeling themselves to hear 20 other names of former classmates who never got to leave first grade, let alone plan for college and grow into adulthood. Today is the day that the 20 children massacred at Sandy Hook Elementary School in December 2012 would have graduated, perhaps cheered on by the six teachers and administrators also killed in the deadliest K-12 shooting in US history. \u201cIt\u2019s just going to be heartbreaking,\u201d Grace told CNN. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine that 20 kids are not graduating with us and that they\u2019re not having the opportunity to walk across the stage.\u201d Emma said she\u2019s trying to prepare herself for a range of emotions \u2013 the joy at leaving school, nerves about what\u2019s next and reflecting on what should have been. \u201cThinking about all the what ifs: what if they were sitting next to me at graduation, what if we were still friends, where would we be? It\u2019s just going to be a lot of what ifs in my head,\u201d she said. With gun violence the leading cause of death for children in the United States, and with shootings inside schools continuing to claim the lives of students and teachers while devastating communities in places like Uvalde, Texas; Parkland, Florida; Nashville, Tennessee; and Santa Fe, Texas \u2013 all since Newtown \u2013 many other students may be faced with their own \u201cwhat ifs.\u201d Newtown High School\u2019s Class of 2024 will be wearing green and white ribbons on their graduation gowns, each inscribed with \u201cForever In Our Hearts\u201d to remember the children and adults who were killed while the new graduates survived, because they happened to be in a different classroom or got an extra few seconds to escape. Emma was six years old and looking forward to making gingerbread houses when the 20-year-old gunman armed with a semi-automatic assault-style rifle and two handguns shot his way into the school. Emma, like many other students, thought the popping noises were from roof construction work at the school, until she came face to face with the horror. \u201cA guy \u2013 armed \u2013 came into my classroom and started shooting all of my friends and my teachers and my classmates,\u201d she said. \u201cHis gun jammed and a friend of mine, Jesse Lewis, yelled at us to run and that\u2019s what we did.\u201d Jesse Lewis, just six years old, shown in family photos with rosy cheeks and a smile full of baby teeth, was killed. But his quick thinking and desire to help his friends propelled Emma and a few other children to bump past the gunman and get out. \u201cI remember vividly running out of the room and then, in the hallway right by the main entrance, there were chairs \u2026 and under the chairs were people, because of the force of impact of the bullets, they were blown under the chairs.\u201d She led her classmates out of the school and eventually was found by a family friend and taken to safety. Grace hid with her friends in the cubbies in another classroom, feeling scared, she said, but not really sure about what, until police officers escorted them out to safety at the fire station next door. \u201cWhen we got to the firehouse, we had to line up by grade and that\u2019s when my teacher was like, this is really not OK,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause when we lined up by grade, half our grade was missing.\u201d That night, Grace learned that Jessica Rekos, a horse-loving fellow Girl Scout in her small troop, had died, though she said she could not comprehend what death meant then. \u201cThat day really took a lot of my childhood away from me,\u201d she said. Both Grace and Emma clearly still carry the grief from the massacre but also seem propelled by their experiences to make their country safer. Grace will attend Hamilton College in upstate New York, with plans to focus on law and justice. Rationally, she says it\u2019s a choice she is making but she also acknowledges she feels an obligation. \u201cI really want to make sure that they know I\u2019m doing something,\u201d she said of her classmates who had no chance to graduate. \u201cEven though they\u2019re not here anymore, there are people who survived that are really trying to push for them. Because their lives were lost so early and I went through that at such an early age, I feel like it\u2019s my purpose to continue my life in honor of them.\u201d Grace and Emma are part of the Junior Newtown Action Alliance (Junior NAA) to share their stories and campaign for gun violence prevention. They\u2019ve met with Vice President Kamala Harris and other national leaders, as well as survivors and victims\u2019 families from other school shootings, perhaps driving Emma\u2019s desire to become a \u201clawyer, senator, politician\u201d after she graduates from her legal studies program at Roger Williams University in Rhode Island. \u201cI have thought about \u2026 if I\u2019m not doing something big, did I survive for the right reasons?\u201d she said, talking about the survivor\u2019s guilt she feels she has had her whole life. \u201cWhen I was little, I don\u2019t remember feeling it that much, but now that I\u2019m graduating and going to college and doing all this stuff with Junior NAA, I\u2019ve been feeling it a lot,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m graduating, I\u2019m going to college, I get to go home, I get to see my dog, I get to do all this when they don\u2019t.

{"id": "2024_06_14_politics_garret-graves-louisiana-reelection", "text": "Republican Rep. Garret Graves of Louisiana announced Friday that he will not seek reelection, ending months of uncertainty after a new congressional map made his seat significantly Democratic. \u201cRepresenting South Louisiana and serving in the United States Congress has been an incredible honor,\u201d Graves said in a statement, before adding that \u201crunning for Congress this year does not make sense.\u201d Amid a long and winding legal battle over the congressional lines in Louisiana, the US Supreme Court last month allowed the state to use the new map\u00a0in this year\u2019s elections. A federal judge had previously thrown out the existing map, saying it likely violated the Voting Rights Act. While Black residents make up roughly a third of Louisiana\u2019s population, the state has just one Black lawmaker \u2013 also the lone Democrat \u2013 in its six-member US House delegation. Under the new lines crafted by the GOP-controlled state Legislature, Grave\u2019s 6th Congressional District was redrawn into Louisiana\u2019s second Black-majority district \u2013 one that Joe Biden would have carried by 20 points in 2020. Graves\u2019 announcement will come as a blow to House Republicans, who are looking to defend their razor-thin majority in the chamber. There had been speculation that Graves could try to challenge a fellow Republican incumbent in a neighboring district. But House Speaker Mike Johnson, a fellow Louisianan, endorsed all Republican incumbents in the state\u2019s delegation last month, including Graves for reelection to his current 6th District seat. The congressman conceded Friday that running for a different seat this year was not an option. \u201cIt is evident that a run in any temporary district will cause actual permanent damage to Louisiana\u2019s great representation in Congress,\u201d he said in remarks that hinted at potential further legal challenges to the new map. In recent months, Graves has faced opposition from within his own party, at home and in Washington. The new map, which made Graves\u2019 seat more Democratic, was backed by Louisiana\u2019s Republican governor, Jeff Landry. Graves backed Landry\u2019s opponent in the state\u2019s gubernatorial primary last year. Graves was also among the closest allies of former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, who was ousted from his leadership post in October. In the lead-up to the historic vote, Graves slammed hard-line members of the House GOP conference who were dangling the threat of ousting McCarthy amid efforts to pass stopgap funding legislation. McCarthy reacted to Graves\u2019 announcement in a social media post Friday evening, describing the Louisiana Republican as \u201ca loyal friend\u201d and \u201cthe best of what public service can and should be.\u201d \u201cNo matter the issue, Garret was the first to jump in with enthusiasm, intellect, and a legendary sense of humor,\u201d McCarthy said, adding that Graves\u2019 \u201cabsence will be a major loss for the conference and the entire House.\u201d Graves was first elected to Congress in 2014, succeeding fellow Republican Bill Cassidy, who vacated the seat for a successful US Senate run. Under the current lines, the 6th District, which includes parts of the Baton Rouge area, has been a Republican stronghold. But the redrawn district now leans decidedly Democratic, stretching from Shreveport in the state\u2019s northwest to Baton Rouge. Democratic state Sen. Cleo Fields, who served in Congress for two terms in the 1990s, is seen as the front-runner in the district\u2019s jungle primary in November.

{"id": "2024_06_13_us_new-york-arrest-weapons-nypd", "text": "(CNN) \u2014 The New York Police Department is investigating whether a Queens man who was arrested Wednesday had plans to carry out an attack before he was pulled over and found with a gun, eight loaded magazines and other weapons, according to police officials with knowledge of the investigation. Officers stopped Judd Sanson after noticing a\u00a0blacked-out license plate on the Black Ford Explorer he was driving around 1:30\u00a0a.m., according to NYPD. The officers ended up finding a large cache of\u00a0weapons, handcuffs, NYPD uniform items and a New York City transit vest, NYPD Chief of Department Jeffrey B. Maddrey told reporters Wednesday. Sanson, 27, was taken into custody and now faces charges of criminal possession of a weapon \u2013 a loaded firearm, criminal possession of a weapon, unlawful possession of ammo feed device, and an obscured license plate, the NYPD told CNN in an email. In court Thursday, his lawyer entered a not guilty plea and Sanson was remanded into custody. His next hearing is set for Monday. During their search of Sanson\u2019s car, officers also found a 9-millimeter Glock, 100 rounds of ammunition, a stun gun, multiple knives, a weighted whip, an expandable baton, heavy body armor and two axes, Maddrey said. The man allegedly had a bullet-proof vest with an NYPD patch on the front as well as an orange MTA vest typically worn by workers in New York City subways, according to police officials with knowledge of the investigation. Police displayed the items at a news conference on Wednesday, including the Guy Fawkes mask made popular by the movie \u201cV for Vendetta.\u201d According to an affidavit released Thursday, police found an expandable baton with the words \u201cleft me no choice,\u201d \u201cyou gon learn today\u201d (sic) and \u201castaghfirullah\u201d written in marker. That latter phrase is Arabic for \u201cI seek forgiveness in God,\u201d the affidavit states. Sanson also told an officer, in sum and substance, \u201cSorry, I\u2019ll take it off. There\u2019s a lot of drunk people nowadays,\u201d according to the affidavit. Questions about motive After the court hearing Thursday, Queens District Attorney Melinda Katz said investigators would look through all of Sanson\u2019s social media accounts to find out his true motives. \u201cWhen someone is driving around with 11 different weapons, all of this ammunition, language on the baton that sounds threatening, transit uniforms that can be used almost anywhere in our subway system or in our transit system, we have reason to be concerned,\u201d Katz said. A day earlier, Maddrey said \u201cit\u2019s still too early\u201d in the active investigation to determine if the incident is related to terrorism. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be very thorough with this investigation,\u201d Maddrey said. \u201cIt will be investigated by the detective bureau along with our intel unit to just see what else we can learn about this arrest.\u201d Police sources said investigators from the NYPD\u2019s Intelligence Division and the Joint Terrorism Task Force were brought in because of the number and types of weapons, the gun, the amount of ammunition and vests with police and transit symbols. Investigators are also examining writings found in the car and on social media, the police sources said. \u201cMembers of this department make gun arrests, weapons arrests, arrests for knives every day. But an arrest of this magnitude \u2013 the amount of ammunition, NYPD paraphernalia\u00a0in the car, was significant,\u201d Maddrey said Wednesday. New York\u00a0Gov.

{"id": "2024_06_13_us_washington-makah-tribe-harpoon-whales", "text": "The United States granted the Makah Indian Tribe in Washington state a long-sought waiver Thursday that helps clear the way for its first sanctioned whale hunts since 1999 and sets the stage for renewed clashes with animal rights activists. The Makah, a tribe of 1,500 people on the northwestern tip of the Olympic Peninsula, is the only Native American tribe with a treaty that specifically mentions a right to hunt whales. But it has faced more than two decades of court challenges, bureaucratic hearings and scientific review as it seeks to resume hunting for gray whales. The decision by NOAA Fisheries grants a waiver under the Marine Mammal Protection Act, which otherwise forbids harming marine mammals. It allows the tribe to hunt up to 25 Eastern North Pacific gray whales over 10 years, with a limit of two to three per year. There are roughly 20,000 whales in that population. The tribe celebrated the decision but said it took far too long. \u201cWhaling remains central to the identity, culture, subsistence, and spirituality of the Makah people, and we regard the Gray Whale as sacred,\u201d Makah Tribal Council Chairman Timothy J. Greene Sr. said in a written statement. \u201cIn the time since our last successful hunt in 1999, we have lost many elders who held the knowledge of our whaling customs, and another entire generation of Makahs has grown up without the ability to exercise our Treaty right or experience the connections and benefits of whaling that our ancestors secured for us.\u201d The hunts will be timed to avoid harming endangered Western North Pacific gray whales that sometimes visit the area \u2014 about 200 to 300 remain \u2014 as well as a group of about 200 gray whales that generally spend summer and fall feeding along the Northwest coast. Nevertheless, some hurdles remain. The tribe must enter into a cooperative agreement with the agency under the Whaling Convention Act, and it must obtain a permit to hunt, a process that involves a monthlong public comment period. Animal rights advocates, who have long opposed whaling, could also challenge NOAA\u2019s decision in court. DJ Schubert, a senior wildlife biologist with the Washington, DC-based Animal Welfare Institute, said his organization would object to the issuance of the hunt permit but likely wait until final approvals are given before deciding whether to sue. He noted that while the Eastern North Pacific gray whale population appears healthy now, it has fluctuated wildly in recent years, and no one knows how the whales will fare as climate change continues to affect the Arctic. Scientists estimate that as much as\u00a040% of the population died off\u00a0from 2018 to last year before it began to recover. \u201cWe completely respect the tribe\u2019s cultural practices and traditions,\u201d Schubert said. \u201cWe just fundamentally disagree that they need to hunt whales to continue those traditions. We hope that as this decision-making process plays out, perhaps the Makah Tribe and the government could reconsider the need to hunt whales and advocate for protection instead of persecution.\u201d Archeological evidence shows that Makah hunters in cedar canoes killed whales for sustenance from time immemorial, a practice that ceased only in the early 20th century after commercial whaling vessels depleted the population. By 1994, the Eastern Pacific gray whale population had rebounded, and they were removed from the endangered species list. Seeing an opportunity to reclaim its heritage, the tribe announced plans to hunt again. The Makah trained for months in the ancient ways of whaling and received the blessing of federal officials and the International Whaling Commission. They took to the water in 1998 but didn\u2019t succeed until the next year, when they harpooned a gray whale from a hand-carved cedar canoe. A tribal member in a motorized support boat killed it with a high-powered rifle to minimize its suffering. It was the tribe\u2019s first successful hunt in 70 years. The hunts drew protests from animal rights activists, who sometimes threw smoke bombs at the whalers and sprayed fire extinguishers into their faces. Others veered motorboats between the whales and the tribal canoes to interfere with the hunt. Authorities seized several vessels and made arrests. After animal rights groups sued, the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals overturned federal approval of the tribe\u2019s whaling plans. The court found that the tribe needed to obtain a waiver under the 1972 Marine Mammal Protection Act. Eleven Alaska Native communities in the Arctic have such a waiver for subsistence hunts, allowing them to kill bowhead whales \u2014 even though bowheads are listed as endangered. The Makah Tribe applied for a waiver in 2005. The process repeatedly stalled as new scientific information about the whales and the health of their population was uncovered. Some of the Makah whalers became so frustrated with the delays that they went on a rogue hunt in 2007, killing a gray whale that got away from them and sank. They were convicted in federal court.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/13/us/washington-makah-tribe-harpoon-whales/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/15/2024", "section": "us"}}

Johnson said in a statement that he disagrees with the DOJ\u2019s decision, calling it \u201canother example of the two-tiered system of justice brought to us by the Biden Administration.\u201d \u201cI will be certifying the contempt reports to the U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia,\u201d the Louisiana Republican said. \u201cWe will also move to enforce the subpoena of Attorney General Garland in federal court.\u201d In a letter to Johnson earlier Friday, DOJ pointed to its \u201clongstanding\u201d position of not prosecuting executive branch officials who withhold information subject to executive privilege from Congress. The announcement was anticipated after the House, in a mostly party-line vote, held Garland in contempt for not turning over audio from Biden\u2019s interview in special counsel Robert Hur\u2019s classified documents investigation. \u201cConsistent\u00a0with this\u00a0longstanding\u00a0position and uniform practice,\u00a0the\u00a0Department has determined\u00a0that\u00a0the responses by Attorney General Garland to\u00a0the subpoenas\u00a0issued\u00a0by\u00a0the Committees\u00a0did not\u00a0constitute\u00a0a\u00a0crime,\u00a0and\u00a0accordingly the\u00a0Department will not bring\u00a0the congressional\u00a0contempt\u00a0citation before\u00a0a\u00a0grand\u00a0jury or take\u00a0any other action to\u00a0prosecute the Attorney General,\u201d the letter, from the department\u2019s top congressional liaison, said. Republican lawmakers have argued that access to the tapes would provide more information, transparency and oversight around the investigation into a sitting US president. On Wednesday, every Republican in the House except one \u2013 Rep. Dave Joyce of Ohio \u2013 voted to hold Garland in contempt of Congress. While the Justice Department has defended its decision to not turn over the audio recordings of Biden\u2019s interviews with Hur and his team \u2013 claiming the decision was made in part to protect this and future investigations \u2013 the Justice Department did make public transcripts of those interviews. In describing the interviews, Hur said that Biden presented himself \u201cas a sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.\u201d At the time, Biden ridiculed Hur\u2019s report and questions about his memory. \u201cTheir task was to make a decision over whether to move forward with charges in this case,\u201d Biden said during a press conference following the report, noting that Hur did not move forward with charges. \u201cFor any extraneous commentary they don\u2019t know what they\u2019re talking about. It has not place in this report.\u201d CNN has\u00a0sued for access to the audio recordings, writing in the April lawsuit that \u201cwithout access to any of the interview records, the press and public initially could not form their own conclusions about Hur\u2019s characterization of Biden. \u2026 Transcripts, however, are no substitute for recordings.\u201d In a statement following the vote to hold him in contempt, Garland said Republicans had turned \u201ca serious congressional authority into a partisan weapon\u201d and that he was \u201cdeeply disappointed.\u201d This story has been updated with additional reporting.

Alexander Morris says he was\u00a0put in\u00a0a restraining jacket and\u00a0initially denied treatment for a medical emergency after he arrived at the hospital in an ambulance. He is also suing a nurse and a security guard who\u00a0worked for the hospital. According to the lawsuit, the hospital and nurse \u201cblatantly refused to provide (Morris)\u00a0with medical treatment due to his race and/or perceived mental disability. Instead, (Morris)\u00a0received a deliberate misdiagnosis and received a lower standard of medical care based on his race that amounted to racial discrimination and delayed his actual diagnosis.\u201d On April 7, 2023, Morris was transported\u00a0to Ascension Macomb Oakland Hospital\u00a0in an\u00a0ambulance\u00a0and \u201cpresented to the emergency room\u00a0with difficulty breathing and chest pain, he was on oxygen, and he had a significant known history of cardiac disease including the placement of stints and defibrillator,\u201d the lawsuit states. At the hospital,\u00a0Morris \u201cinformed a nurse and a security guard that he was a member of the famous Motown group the \u2018Four Tops\u2019,\u00a0and that he\u00a0had current security\u00a0concerns due to stalkers and fans,\u201d\u00a0according to the lawsuit. The lawsuit claims the nurse, security guard and an emergency room doctor\u00a0\u201cracially profiled him and/or profiled him based upon a perceived disability and placed an order for a psychological evaluation\u201d because they didn\u2019t believe Morris was \u201ca singer or member of the \u2018Four Tops.\u2019\u201d CNN has reached out to Ascension Macomb Oakland Hospital for comment. An ER doctor decided to \u201cremove him from oxygen and pursue a psychiatric evaluation instead, despite his clear symptoms of cardiac distress and significant medical history,\u201d the lawsuit alleges. The lawsuit states \u201ca security guard was instructed to ensure he was placed into a restraining jacket and/or a four-point restraint mechanism.\u201d Morris told CNN he told the hospital staff,\u00a0\u201cI have never been so demeaned, so dehumanized and so disrespected in all my life.\u201d According to the lawsuit, Morris attempted to prove his identity, offering to show his identification, but was told by the security guard, who is White,\u00a0to \u201csit his Black a** down.\u201d The lawsuit states Morris\u00a0\u201casked to have the restraint device removed and asked for his personal belongings back so he could leave and seek treatment at another hospital,\u201d\u00a0but was told\u00a0he was not free to leave. Morris\u2019 attorney Maurice Davis told CNN his client\u00a0was going through\u00a0\u201ca clear medical emergency where he\u2019s having chest pain, he has a history of heart problems, a history of strokes. \u00a0A situation like that calls for\u00a0swift medical intervention,\u201d\u00a0Davis said. According to the lawsuit, Morris was denied medical care until a nurse allowed him to show her a video of a Four Tops performance\u00a0at the Grammys. The lawsuit states, \u201cThe restraint jacket was finally removed, and he was placed back on oxygen.\u00a0(Morris) was restrained for approximately an hour and a half.\u201d Morris\u00a0said\u00a0his identity was proven almost four hours after he arrived at the hospital. \u201cI said, all it took was two minutes to verify that\u00a0I am who I am,\u201d\u00a0Morris told CNN. \u201cInstead of you verifying who I am, you tell me I\u2019m crazy and want to send me to the psych evaluation department.\u201d The lawsuit states\u00a0Morris was offered a $25 gift card to a supermarket\u00a0as an apology by the hospital, but he refused\u00a0the offer. \u201cMy anxiety, everything, was through the roof.\u00a0\u00a0I would not eat, I was afraid to eat anything brought to me that was not sealed,\u201d\u00a0he told CNN. Morris\u00a0said he believed he was\u00a0\u201cclose to death\u201d\u00a0because of his health history. \u201cBecause I had several heart attacks and things like that \u2026 my heart was already compromised,\u201d\u00a0Morris told CNN. Morris\u00a0said\u00a0he\u00a0had three seizures and stayed in Ascension Macomb Oakland Hospital for about five days because he was too sick to be moved to another hospital. It\u2019s unclear if the alleged actions by the hospital contributed to Morris\u2019 subsequent medical issues. \u201cIf a person is coming in for help, I don\u2019t care what their nationality, their ethnicity, their religious beliefs or their sexual orientation \u2014 if they come to your emergency room for help, help them first,\u201d Morris said. Davis told CNN the hospital should compensate Morris for what his client endured.\u00a0 According to the lawsuit, Morris is seeking compensation for damages from the defendants to be determined by a jury in\u00a0excess of $75,000.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/13/us/alexander-morris-four-tops-hospital-lawsuit-reaj/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/15/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_13_us_phoenix-police-homeless-justice-report", "text": "The Phoenix Police Department has for years violated the constitutional rights of residents experiencing homelessness and regularly discriminated against minority communities, according to a Justice Department report released Thursday. Justice Department investigators found that Phoenix police targets \u201cpeople experiencing homelessness, retaliates against people who criticize the police, and disproportionately uses force against people with behavioral health disabilities.\u201d The report also found that officers disproportionately enforce laws more severely against Black, Hispanic, and Native American people than against White people engaged in the same behaviors, even though \u201cthe city still claims it is \u2018unaware of any credible evidence of discriminatory policing.\u2019\u201d The blistering report marks the end of a\u00a0nearly three-year investigation into the police department\u00a0that began in the wake of several high-profile incidents, including the 2020 fatal police shooting of a man in a parked car. This investigation was the first time that a department\u2019s so-called pattern and practice investigation focused on officers\u2019 conduct toward people experiencing homelessness \u2013 a\u00a0clear warning for cities around the country where\u00a0police sweeps of homeless communities\u00a0have become a common response to the growth of tent cities in public spaces. DOJ investigators found that \u201cin the early mornings, officers cite or arrest homeless people for conduct that is plainly not a crime, such as sitting or lying down on public property or for \u2018trespassing\u2019 on private property when they are on a public sidewalk.\u201d Officers also repeatedly seized and destroyed the property of people experiencing homelessness under the guise of the city\u2019s \u201cclean-up operations,\u201d according to the report. \u201cA person\u2019s constitutional rights do not diminish when they lack shelter,\u201d the report concludes. Kristen Clarke, the head of DOJ\u2019s Civil Rights Division, told reporters on Thursday that \u201chomelessness is a challenge in Phoenix and in many cities across the country.\u201d \u201cOver-policing of the homeless has become a central pillar of the (Phoenix) police department\u2019s enforcement strategy,\u201d she added. \u201cThe criminalization of homelessness has no place in our society today.\u201d How US cities have responded to\u00a0a surge in unhoused residents\u00a0has become a major flashpoint in recent years, prompting people experiencing homelessness and their advocates to push for greater accountability among local officials. The Supreme Court is\u00a0expected to rule in the coming days\u00a0in a case challenging an Oregon city ticketing its unhoused residents. The justices have been asked to consider whether the practice\u00a0violates the Constitution\u2019s ban on \u201ccruel and unusual\u201d punishment. The\u00a0DOJ\u00a0report acknowledges that the Phoenix Police Department has instituted several changes to address unconstitutional policing since the beginning of the federal investigation. CNN is reaching out to the police department for comment. DOJ report finds police used excessive force The Phoenix Police Department frequently and inappropriately used deadly force, the report found, and has one of the highest rates of fatal shootings in the country per year. Among the causes of Phoenix officers\u2019 use of excessive force is that officers are taught a \u201cmisguided notion of de-escalation,\u201d the report says. \u201cRather than teaching that de-escalation strategies are designed to eliminate or reduce the need to use force,\u00a0(the Phoenix Police Department)\u00a0has misappropriated the concept and teaches officers that all force\u00a0\u2013 even deadly force \u2013\u00a0is de-escalation,\u201d\u00a0the report\u00a0reads. Officers also delayed\u00a0rendering aid to people whom they have shot, the report\u00a0found, or continued\u00a0to use force against those who\u00a0were already\u00a0incapacitated \u2013 sometimes even unconscious \u2013 because of gunfire. In one example highlighted by the Justice Department, officers shot an individual in the chest who had pointed a handgun at police. A supervisor at the scene instructed officers to use a non-lethal weapon to give \u201ca couple pops before we approach\u201d the man, who had fallen to the ground, and then said that there was \u201cno rush\u201d in administering CPR. The man was later pronounced dead. In other examples, officers were quick to physical violence or arrests when they felt that people were being disrespectful or criticizing the police. Police officers have also used excessive force against protesters to deter First Amendment-protected speech, the report\u00a0found, including by firing less-than-lethal weapons indiscriminately and without legal justification. Officers have used arrests to deter people from protesting, used criminal charges that were \u201cfar more serious than the evidence supported,\u201d and have \u201csought to justify serious charges with false evidence.\u201d The police department\u2019s \u201crecent commitment to protecting free speech is important, but it would be premature to claim\u00a0any new efforts are working,\u201d the report adds. Police target minority communities, report finds The sprawling report also found that the Phoenix Police Department disproportionately polices the city\u2019s minority communities, including through excessive tickets and arrests for less serious offenses. The DOJ probe found that the department \u201ccites and arrests Black, Hispanic, and Native American people for low-level traffic, drug, alcohol, and quality-of-life offenses at rates disproportionate to their shares of the population.\u201d The offenses cover a range of misconduct, according to the report, which said as an example that the department arrested \u201ccyclists for biking on the wrong side of the road almost eight times more in predominantly non-white neighborhoods, compared with white neighborhoods.\u201d DOJ also said that the Phoenix Police Department lacked the ability to \u201cadequately investigate\u201d complaints from community members that an office acted with \u201covert bias.\u201d Many complaints lodged against officers were classified by investigators at the department as \u201cofficer \u2018rudeness,\u2019\u201d according to the report. \u201cIn the vast majority of cases, (the police department) simply dismisses complaints of discriminatory policing absent evidence that an officer made an overtly racist statement or admitted to engaging in racist profiling,\u201d the report found. \u201cSince people are unlikely to admit to such things, (the department\u2019s) practice of requiring this evidence means that these complaints will necessarily be given short shrift.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/13/us/phoenix-police-homeless-justice-report/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/15/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_12_us_nova-music-festival-exhibition-protest-in-new-york-called-heartbreaking", "text": "The Hate Crimes Task Force of the New York Police Department is investigating several reports of antisemitic vandalism at the homes of Jewish board members of the Brooklyn Museum \u2013 including its director, a New York City law enforcement official told CNN Wednesday. Five homes \u2013 three in Manhattan and two in Brooklyn \u2013 were vandalized Tuesday night, police said. \u201cWe are deeply troubled by these horrible acts,\u201d Taylor Maatman, Brooklyn Museum\u2019s spokesperson, told CNN. Tuesday night\u2019s vandalism comes as the US saw the highest number of antisemitic incidents reported since The Anti-Defamation League began tracking\u00a0data in 1979, according to the organization\u2019s annual audit of antisemitism released in April. NYC Comptroller Brad Lander\u00a0posted photos on X of the vandalism Wednesday saying, \u201cThe cowards who did this are way over the line into antisemitism, harming the cause they claim to care about, and making everyone less safe.\u201d The images shared by Lander show the entryway of a home with its front doors and windows splattered in red paint and a sign hanging in the entrance filled with red handprints that reads, \u201cAnne Pasternak Brooklyn Museum White Supremacist Zionist.\u201d Pasternak is the Brooklyn Museum\u2019s director. Additionally, red inverted triangles were painted on the windows and doors of the home, a symbol used by the military wing of Hamas in the recent conflict in Gaza to indicate Israeli military targets, according to the\u00a0Anti-Defamation League. The symbol, sometimes used in the form of an emoji, is used in some cases to \u201csignify support for violent Palestinian resistance against Israel.\u201d New York Gov. Kathy Hochul called the graffiti \u201can abhorrent act of antisemitism,\u201d writing on X that New York stands \u201cwith the Jewish community in the face of hate and will continue to fight antisemitism wherever it rears its ugly head.\u201d New York Mayor Eric Adams echoed the sentiment saying the vandalism \u201cis not peaceful protest or free speech,\u201d he wrote on X. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to Anne Pasternak and members of @brooklynmuseum\u2019s board who woke up to hatred like this,\u201d he said. \u201cI spoke to Anne this morning and committed that this hate will not stand in our city.\u201d The NYPD Task Force is actively investigating the incidents, poring through surveillance footage, and speaking with witnesses to gather more information. Protests outside exhibition for those killed at Israeli music festival The vandalism comes just one day after political leaders, locally and nationally, condemned a Monday protest outside an exhibition in Manhattan commemorating the lives of those killed at an Israeli music festival last year. \u201cIt was pretty surreal that this protest took place outside of exhibition commemorating hundreds of lives of people that were lost,\u201d the spokesperson, Michelle Rojas, told CNN Monday. The exhibition commemorates those killed at the Nova Music Festival in Israel during the October 7 attacks by Hamas. At least 260 people\u00a0died\u00a0during the festival attack, according to Israeli rescue service Zaka. Some attendees were taken hostage, and seen in social media videos being seized by their armed captors. The outdoor festival was supposed to be an all-night dance party, celebrating the Jewish holiday of Sukkot. The New York City protest was part of a \u201cCitywide Day of Rage for Gaza,\u201d in which pro-Palestinian protesters demonstrated outside museums across the city on Monday. The protests were organized by the activist group Within Our Lifetime \u201cin response to the ongoing genocide being carried out against the Palestinian people,\u201d and called on demonstrators to \u201ctake autonomous action all day,\u201d then gather at Union Square at 5 p.m. \u201cAcross the city, the Brooklyn Museum and cultural institutions like it are drenched in the blood of Palestine\u2019s martyrs. In their name and in their memory we call for autonomous action against these institutions all day,\u201d the group said on X. Israel launched ongoing attacks in Gaza after the Hamas attacks in October killed 1,200 people. More than 37,000 Palestinians have been\u00a0killed\u00a0in Gaza since Israel\u2019s war against Hamas started in October, according to figures from the enclave\u2019s health ministry. Multiple protesters in New York City were taken into custody,\u00a0and 23 were released with criminal court summons, according to the New York City Police Department. It\u2019s unclear exactly how many protesters were arrested. The protest was despicable and inhumane, Hochul told CNN\u2019s Laura Coates on Wednesday. \u201cThis is not who New Yorkers are, and we should not descend into this chaos and allow any tolerance for this disgusting, abhorrent behavior,\u201d Hochul said. Adams\u00a0called the demonstration \u201cpure\u00a0anti-Semitism.\u201d \u201cAny New Yorker who stands for peace cannot stand next to those waving Hamas and Hezbollah flags, especially at an exhibit commemorating the victims of the\u00a0Nova\u00a0Music Festival massacre,\u201d he said in a post on X. \u201cThe NYPD has overseen thousands of peaceful protests, but it is our duty to arrest anyone who breaks the law,\u201d Adams added. \u201cNew Yorkers will always be safe here.\u201d The White House condemned the demonstration outside the New York exhibit along with New York Rep. Ritchie Torres, a Democrat, who\u00a0called the protesters\u00a0\u201canti-Israel bigots\u201d on X, and\u00a0Manhattan Borough President Mark Levine who called the demonstration\u00a0\u201crepulsive and vile.\u201d \u201cThe events at yesterday\u2019s memorial to those murdered at the Nova music festival are outrageous and heartbreaking,\u201d White House spokesman Andrew Bates said in a statement.

{"id": "2024_06_14_business_boeing-737-max-dutch-roll-investigation", "text": "Federal authorities and Boeing are trying to figure out why a 737 Max 8 experienced a rare, unsafe back-and-forth roll during flight. The oscillating motion is known as a Dutch roll, and one characteristic described by the Federal Aviation Administration is the nose of an aircraft making a figure-eight. There were no injuries onboard Southwest Airlines flight 746 on May 25, according to the airline and a preliminary report by the FAA. The report said the crew \u201cregained control,\u201d and the plane safely landed. But the aircraft suffered \u201csubstantial\u201d damage and the FAA classified the incident as an \u201caccident.\u201d The FAA report said an inspection \u201crevealed damage to the standby PCU,\u201d or power control unit, which controls the rudder. It is unclear if the damaged unit led to or was a result of the roll. The plane has not flown since landing in Oakland, California after the incident, except to move it to a Boeing facility in Washington state. Boeing did not immediately comment to CNN. Southwest told CNN it referred the incident to the FAA and National Transportation Safety Board and is participating in and supporting the investigation. The incident occurred almost three weeks ago and was added to a FAA database this week. There were 175 passengers and six crew onboard, according to the airline. The NTSB confirmed it has opened an investigation into this incident. Investigators have downloaded data from the flight data recorder, which \u201cwill aid investigators in determining the length and severity of the event.\u201d Voice recordings from the voice data recorder \u2013 the other of the so-called black boxes - were overwritten. In February, the FAA required airlines flying some 737 Max 8 and similar aircraft to inspect the rudder assembly for loose or missing nut, washer and bolt. It said the flaw would prevent the pilots from controlling the rudder using foot pedals. Authorities have not said if this condition and the Dutch roll last month are related. An unusual motion Most passengers have never felt a plane make this movement \u2014 and most airline pilots have never experienced it in actual flight. \u201cIt\u2019s very obscure,\u201d aviation safety analyst and former airline pilot Kathleen Bangs told CNN.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s a very uncomfortable movement and you feel the tail swinging around.\u201d While moving forward in flight, airplanes can pivot along three axis:\u00a0Nose up and down, known as pitch; wings dipping down or raising up, known as roll;\u00a0and the tail shifting left or right, known as yaw. Airliners turn using a typically seamless combination of roll and yaw coordinated by the aircraft\u2019s computers. These large aircraft also have yaw dampers that make small adjustments throughout flight. In the Dutch roll, the plane both rolls and yaws excessively.\u00a0Passengers would feel the plane shift to one side, and back to the other \u2014 moving back and forth, Bangs said. She said airline pilots train for scenarios where their yaw dampers fail.\u00a0They could take an aircraft simulator to a high altitude and turn off the yaw damper. \u201cThen you stomp on a rudder pedal really hard to try to initiate [the roll] in the simulator,\u201d Bangs said. To get out of a Dutch roll, pilots can slow the aircraft and descend to thicker air. Modern airliners are designed to be inherently stable in air, she said, so the plane may return to level flight with minimal additional input. But the forces can be powerful. In 1959, four of the eight occupants on a Boeing 707 test and training flight were killed just outside of Washington, DC, after extremely steep Dutch rolls. \u201cThe aircraft immediately yawed and rolled violently to the right,\u201d reads a report from the Civil Aeronautics Board, which investigated the incident. \u201cSeveral gyrations followed and after control of the aircraft was regained, it was determined that three of the four engines had separated from the aircraft and it was on fire.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/14/business/boeing-737-max-dutch-roll-investigation/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/15/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_12_us_southern-baptists-women-pastors-vote", "text": "Southern Baptists narrowly rejected a proposal Wednesday to enshrine a ban on churches with women pastors in the denomination\u2019s constitution after opponents argued it was unnecessary because the denomination already has a way of ousting such churches. The vote received support from 61% of the delegates but failed to get the required two-thirds supermajority. The action reversed a preliminary vote last year in favor of the official ban. But it still leaves the Southern Baptist Convention with its official doctrinal statement saying the office of pastor is limited to men. Even the opponents of the ban said they favored that doctrinal statement but didn\u2019t think it was necessary to reinforce it in the constitution. Opponents noted that the SBC already can oust churches that assert women can serve as pastors \u2014 as it did\u00a0last year\u00a0and again\u00a0Tuesday night. The vote was perhaps the most highly anticipated of the annual meeting, reflecting years of debate in the United States\u2019 largest Protestant denomination. It is the final day of the SBC\u2019s two-day annual meeting in Indianapolis. Since 2000, the SBC\u2019s nonbinding statement of faith has declared that only men are qualified for the role of pastor. It\u2019s interpreted differently across the denomination, with some believing it doesn\u2019t apply to associate pastors so long as the senior pastor is male. The proposed amendment, which received preliminary approval last year, would formally exclude churches that have women in any pastoral positions, from lead pastor to associates, or even affirms them in that role. Supporters believe it is biblically necessary, estimating hundreds of Southern Baptist churches have women in those roles. The rejected amendment would have said any church deemed in \u201cfriendly cooperation\u201d \u2014 the official term for SBC affiliation \u2014 must be one that \u201caffirms, appoints, or employs only men as any kind of pastor or elder as qualified by Scripture.\u201d Opponents argued the convention already has the power to remove churches over this issue, and the amendment will have unintended consequences, including disproportionately affecting Black Southern Baptist congregations, which tend to have women on their pastoral staffs. But the motion went swiftly to a vote after only brief debate. Ryan Fullerton, pastor of Immanuel Baptist Church in Louisville, Kentucky, said the measure is \u201cnot about preventing women from exercising their gifts\u201d in the church, in roles on church staff such as \u201cchildren\u2019s ministers.\u201d But he said the Bible is clear that the office of pastor is for men. He said there is \u201cconfusion about gender\u201d in the wider culture and cited what he called \u201cthe ravages of the LGBTQIA agenda.\u201d But Spence Shelton, pastor of Mercy Church in Charlotte, North Carolina, argued that it was unnecessary. He said there is no doubt that Southern Baptists are \u201ccomplementarian,\u201d as they describe the view that men and women have equal value but different roles that complement one another. But he noted that the convention voted to affirm the ouster of a historic Virginia church Tuesday and two other churches last year, including the California megachurch Saddleback, which all have women pastors and affirmed they could hold top pastoral positions. The reason for ousting them was that they didn\u2019t have a faith and practice consistent with the Baptist Faith and Message, the document approved in 2000 that includes the affirmation that the pastoral position is reserved for men. \u201cY\u2019all, we have shown the mechanisms we currently have are sufficient to deal with this question,\u201d Shelton said. Mike Law, pastor of Arlington Baptist Church in Virginia and author of the amendment, cited a report that there are about 1,800 women pastors working in the denomination. He cited Bible verses limiting the pastoral office to men. \u201cOur culture may see this prohibition as harsh, but our God is all wise, and wrote this word for the flourishing of both men and women,\u201d he said. \u201cThis amendment is not about women in ministry,\u201d Law added. \u201cIt\u2019s specifically about women in the pastoral office.\u201d He did not spell out the difference in his brief floor speech. The denomination can\u2019t tell its independent churches what to do or whom to appoint as a pastor. But they can say which churches are in and which are out. Last year, Southern Baptists refused to take back Saddleback, one of the convention\u2019s largest congregations, and a small Kentucky church over the issue. Both churches, which had women in top pastoral positions, appealed their ouster to the 2023 annual meeting and were overwhelmingly rejected by the delegates. A similar scenario played out in Indianapolis on Tuesday, when messengers voted overwhelmingly to kick out First Baptist Church of Alexandria in Virginia, which has a woman in an associate position and also asserted that women can hold the top job. Supporters of the amendment say it probably won\u2019t result in an immediate, large-scale purge, but opponents expressed concern it would burden SBC volunteers and staff with numerous investigations of churches. Delegates also elected a North Carolina pastor and longtime denominational statesman to be the next president of their convention in a contest between six candidates that went into two run-off votes. Clint Pressley, who is senior pastor of Hickory Grove Baptist Church in Charlotte, will be the next Southern Baptist Convention president after winning 56% of votes in the final run-off race. The SBC president \u2014 one of the most prominent faces of the conservative evangelical network of churches \u2014 presides over the annual meeting and appoints members to the denomination\u2019s committees. Pressley\u2019s nearest opponent, Tennessee pastor, Dan Spencer, received 44 percent of the votes after four other candidates were eliminated in earlier rounds. Pressley has said he favors a measure being voted on later Wednesday to amend the SBC constitution to ban churches with women pastors. Pressley earned a master of divinity from New Orleans Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisiana, one of the SBC\u2019s official seminaries. He has led Hickory Grove since 2011 after pastoring churches in Alabama and Mississippi. Pressley was first vice president of the SBC in 2014-15 and served on numerous other denominational boards. Messengers early Wednesday rejected a proposal to abolish the SBC\u2019s public policy agency, the Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission. The measure reflected the views of some that the staunchly conservative commission wasn\u2019t conservative enough.

{"id": "2024_06_14_business_faa-probe-counterfeit-titanium-boeing-airbus", "text": "Titanium that was distributed with fake documentation has been found in commercial Boeing and Airbus jets. Now the Federal Aviation Administration, the aircraft manufacturers and supplier Spirit AeroSystems are investigating whether those components pose a safety hazard to the public. The probe, first reported by the New York Times Friday, is the latest black eye for the aerospace industry, which has had a series of problems recently with the quality and safety issues involving jets. The investigation comes after small holes were discovered in the material, apparently from corrosion, according to the Times report.  The FAA and Boeing confirmed that they are investigating the matter. Boeing said the questionable parts come from a limited set of suppliers, and tests performed to date have indicated that the correct titanium alloy was used. \u201cTo ensure compliance, we are removing any affected parts on airplanes prior to delivery. Our analysis shows the in-service fleet can continue to fly safely.\u201d Spirit said the investigation is looking into counterfeit documents that allowed the questionable titanium to enter the supply chain. \u201cWhen this was identified, all suspect parts were quarantined and removed from Spirit production,\u201d said Joe Buccino, a spokesperson for Spirit. \u201cMore than 1,000 tests have been completed to confirm the mechanical and metallurgical properties of the affected material to ensure continued airworthiness.\u201d Airbus said it is aware of the situation. \u201cNumerous tests have been performed on parts coming from the same source of supply,\u201d it said in its statment. \u201cThey show that the A220\u2019s airworthiness remains intact.\u201d\u00a0 The FAA said it trying to determine the safety implications to planes that were made using the parts. It is unclear how many planes have parts made with the questionable material, according to the Times, which said among the planes with the parts were the Boeing 737 Max and 787 Dreamliner and the Airbus 220. \u201cBoeing reported a voluntary disclosure to the FAA regarding procurement of material through a distributor who may have falsified or provided incorrect records,\u201d the statement said. \u201cBoeing issued a bulletin outlining ways suppliers should remain alert to the potential of falsified records.\u201d Besides stirring concerns among passengers about the safety of flying, the growing list of problems for the aviation industry have reduced the capacity of planes available to fly, and thus put upward pressure of airfares in the face of strong demand for air travel globally. The most serious and high profile problems involve Boeing, \u00a0which had two fatal crashes of its 737 Max due to a design flaw in 2018 and 2019 that killed 346 people and led to a 20-month grounding of the jet. More recently a door plug blew off an Alaska Airlines 737 Max flight on January 5, forcing the plane to land with a gaping hole in its side. Airbus has also had problems with some of the engines that have grounded some of its planes owned by different airlines.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/14/business/faa-probe-counterfeit-titanium-boeing-airbus/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/15/2024", "section": "us"}}

It also comes as President Joe Biden, at 81, is seeking to dispel concerns about his state of mind and fitness amid a pattern of public gaffes. Here\u2019s what else you need to know to\u00a0Get Up to Speed and On with Your Day. 1. Severe weather Heavy rainfall that\u2019s caused unrelenting flooding in South Florida will continue for a fourth consecutive day before a reprieve is in sight for millions in the state. Since heavy rains started swamping the region Tuesday, the flooding has become waist-deep in some places. Hazardous conditions on streets and roadways have stranded drivers and made roads impassable \u2014 and they\u2019ve forced some schools in hard-hit counties to shutter and hundreds of flights to be canceled or delayed. Flood watches remain in effect for over 7 million people across South Florida, including in Miami and Fort Lauderdale. On the other hand, high temperatures will expand across parts of the Plains to the East Coast. Today will be the hottest day of the year so far in Washington, DC, reaching the mid-90s, or about 10 degrees higher than normal. 2. Ukraine President Biden and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky signed a historic security agreement on the sidelines of the G7 summit in Italy on Thursday. \u201cWe\u2019re going to stand by Ukraine,\u201d Biden said, vowing lasting support for the country\u2019s defense now and in the future. The 10-year deal lays out a path for the US\u2019 long-term security relationship with Kyiv \u2014 but it could also be undone by future US administrations, sources say. Zelensky called it a \u201ctruly historic day\u201d after signing the agreement and said it would benefit all countries because Russia is a \u201creal global threat.\u201d He also expressed confidence that the pact will serve as a bridge to Kyiv\u2019s efforts to join NATO. 3. Abortion The Supreme Court on Thursday unanimously rejected a lawsuit challenging the FDA\u2019s approach to regulating the abortion pill mifepristone, allowing the drug to stay on the market. The ruling is a significant setback for the anti-abortion movement in what was the first major Supreme Court case on reproductive rights since the court\u2019s conservative majority overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022. The challenge to the drug had been vehemently opposed by the pharmaceutical industry, which warned that a ruling that second-guessed the regulations for mifepristone could open the door to legal challenges targeting all sorts of medications. 4. Hamas hostages The fate of the 120 remaining hostages in Gaza is crucial to any deal to end the months-long conflict between Israel and Hamas. But a senior Hamas official has told CNN that \u201cno one has an idea\u201d how many of them are alive, and that any deal to release them must include guarantees of a permanent ceasefire and the complete withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza. Benny Gantz, who quit Israel\u2019s war cabinet last week, said that Israel knows how many hostages in Gaza are still alive, adding that the public will receive details on some of the hostages \u201cin due time.\u201d Meanwhile, negotiations over the US-backed proposal to free the hostages and end the fighting have intensified in recent days but appeared to grind to a halt on Wednesday after Hamas presented its response to the document. 5. Apple Apple is now the most valuable US public company after its announcements on generative AI features for iPhones sent its stock climbing. The company\u2019s market cap closed at roughly $3.29 trillion on Thursday, just above Microsoft\u2019s $3.28 trillion. The iPhone maker\u2019s bounceback comes about a week after AI chipmaker Nvidia surpassed it to become the second-largest public company. Nvidia now ranks third, behind Microsoft. Still, it will take some time until Apple sees substantial sales growth, analysts say, as users are now waiting longer to upgrade their devices and an uncertain economic environment weighs on consumers, particularly in China.

{"id": "2024_06_14_us_catholic-bishops-indigenous-apology-reaj", "text": "The US Conference of Catholic Bishops issued a\u00a0formal apology Friday to Indigenous people for the mistreatment and trauma inflicted by the Catholic Church. The apology is part of a document approved by US Catholic bishops by a vote during its annual spring meeting in Louisville, Kentucky. The document titled\u00a0\u201cKeeping Christ\u2019s Sacred Promise: A Pastoral Framework for Indigenous Ministry,\u201d\u00a0includes the apology, discusses the church\u2019s role in the\u00a0boarding schools for Native American that forced assimilation in the 19th and 20th centuries, and sets a series of new policies for ministering to Indigenous Catholics. The vote passed 181-2 with three abstentions. \u201cToday, many North American Indigenous Catholics trace their faith to the decision of their ancestors to embrace Catholicism hundreds of years ago. Sadly, many Indigenous Catholics have felt a sense of abandonment in their relationship with Church leaders due to a lack of understanding of their unique cultural needs,\u201d the document states. \u201cWe apologize for the failure to nurture, strengthen, honor, recognize, and appreciate those entrusted to our pastoral care.\u201d Native Americans comprise approximately 3.5% of Catholics in the United States, according to the UCCB. In the document, the bishops described how Native Americans were forced to assimilate to White culture by the church. \u201cIn these schools, Indigenous children were forced to abandon their traditional languages, dress, and customs,\u201d the bishops said in the document. \u201cBoarding schools were seen as one expedient means to achieve this cultural assimilation because they separated Indigenous children from their families and Tribes and \u201cAmericanized\u201d\u00a0them while they were still malleable,\u201d the document adds. The guidelines issued Friday call on Catholic bishops to promote and expand healing and reconciliation with Native American communities, set up listening sessions and provide training for \u201cclergy, religious, and lay leaders to better minister to the pastoral needs of Indigenous Peoples,\u201d according to the document. \u201cWe must go beyond an apology to take concrete actions, if we are to restore trust within these communities and demonstrate our true willingness to be transparent, present, and accountable to them,\u201d the document states. Most Rev. Chad Zielinski, chairman of the conference\u2019s subcommittee on Native American affairs, said during the first day of the meeting on Thursday that the framework has been requested for a long time. Its goal is to help bishops refocus and \u2018reinvigorate\u2019 the ministry, he said. \u201cThis pastoral framework has been anticipated by Catholic indigenous communities in the US, who have long requested renewed pastoral attention and support from the bishops for their efforts on evangelization, reconciliation and healing, education and addressing matters of justice and social concerns in native communities,\u201d Zielinski said.  For years, advocates and Indigenous leaders have worked to raise awareness about harm inflicted on Indigenous children in boarding schools in the US and Canada and the subsequent generational trauma.  Hundreds of those schools were run or directly supported by the federal government to assimilate children into White society, but many were run by religious groups and churches after Congress passed the Civilization Fund Act in 1819. The legislation provided religious organizations with the resources to run more than a hundred schools for Native American children. Many operated like military training camps where children were subject to abuse, neglect and corporal punishment. In 2022, Pope Francis apologized for the Catholic Church\u2019s role in the abuse of Canada\u2019s Indigenous people, following the discovery of hundreds of unmarked graves on the grounds of former boarding schools and a years-long initiative by the federal government to investigate and create a historical record of the schools. Indigenous leaders in the US continue calling for a similar apology from the Pope.  In the US, Interior Secretary Deb Haaland launched an initiative to investigate the boarding schools that released initial findings in 2022, showing that 19 boarding schools accounted for the deaths of more than 500 American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian children.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/14/us/catholic-bishops-indigenous-apology-reaj/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/15/2024", "section": "us"}}

I know many in the community are happy to see it go,\u201d said Tony Montalto, who lost his 14-year-old daughter, Gina. His son is concerned people will forget once the building is gone. His wife had grown attached to it from the many times they took lawmakers through its corridors. \u201cAs for me, I\u2019m concerned because we haven\u2019t seen a solid plan yet for what\u2019s going to replace this building. We need something that\u2019s going to reflect the ones who were taken from us, the people they were before the tragedy.\u201d The district said in May the demolition would take place in summer 2024 following the end of the school year, which was Monday. The demolition was initially set to begin Thursday, but was delayed due to days of torrential flooding rain in South Florida. In a statement, the district said Friday it \u201cis\u00a0continuing to work with the families and school staff to determine future use of the site.\u201d The shooting ripped apart 17 families, including 14 students and three faculty members, on Valentine\u2019s Day in 2018. Seventeen others were wounded; their journey through grief and trauma continues to this day. The gunman was\u00a0sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. \u201cThis is one more step in our healing process,\u201d Lori Alhadeff, whose 14-year-old daughter, Alyssa, was killed at the school, told CNN Friday. \u201cAnd it\u2019s important that\u2026 six years later, that this building comes down and my family, you know, we\u2019re grieving the death of our daughter, Alyssa. We\u2019re healing but we\u2019re also trying to make change.\u201d Alhadeff founded the nonprofit Make Our Schools Safe, which promotes school safety. Alyssa\u2019s Law, which requires that public elementary and secondary school buildings be equipped with silent panic alarms to notify law enforcement, is on the books in six states. \u201cWe know that time equals life,\u201d said Alhadeff, noting that legislators who toured the building \u2013 \u201cseeing the blood on the ground, the glass on the floor, the horror\u201d \u2013 were moved to action. Alhadeff, who chairs the Broward County School Board, said she hoped the grounds would be turned into a \u201cusable space\u201d she called \u201cMSD Legacy Field\u201d that can serve as a \u201cteachable area where we can remember and keep the legacy alive.\u201d \u201cThe day before Alyssa was murdered, she played in her last soccer game and she was fierce,\u201d her mother recalled Friday. \u201cShe was captain of her soccer team, wore number eight, and we just miss and love Alyssa so much, and we will continue to keep your memory alive through Make Our Schools Safe.\u201d \u2018There is no closure\u2019 Before the demolition got underway, a rainbow soared over the area where families of the victims later gathered. Among those assembled were Debbi Hixon and her son Corey, whose father, Chris, 49, the school athletic director and wrestling coach, was killed that day. Alhadeff was there with her family, along with Montalto. And Max Schachter, whose 14-year-old son, Alex, was murdered in English class. Once the demolition started, Schachter did not stop watching. \u201cWhen I brought people through that building, it changed their lives,\u201d Schachter said. \u201cAnd everybody that came out of that building was focused to make sure that this never happens again.\u201d Even after it\u2019s torn down, Schachter said, the 1200 building will always be there. \u201cI will always remember the horrific images that I saw walking through that building, knowing the pain that Alex was going through when he was being shot and murdered. There is no closure for me. It\u2019s a progress through this journey that I am on.\u201d His only regret, Schachter said, is that more people will not be able to bear witness to the horror. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to understand the magnitude of the failures unless you\u2019re walking through that building,\u201d he said. \u201cIn Florida, we\u2019ve passed seven school safety bills since Parkland. We take it very, very seriously. You have to prioritize safety before education because you can\u2019t teach dead children. I\u2019m looking at this building today and it reminds me of all the failures that happened that day.\u201d It rained earlier but, by the time the excavator went to work, the sky was a clear blue. Some family members greeted each other with hugs. Others stood in small groups and talked. The school building was preserved pending the trials of both the shooter and Parkland school resource officer Scot Peterson, who stayed outside during the massacre. A jury acquitted Peterson on all counts, absolving him of wrongdoing in the\u00a0rare trial of a law enforcement officer. On the day of the massacre, the then 19-year-old gunman grabbed his AR-15-style rifle and magazines and rode in an Uber to his former high school. There, he took out his rifle and loaded it then wandered through the halls of the school. He\u00a0fired indiscriminately at various students and staff in hallways and classrooms.\u00a0He eventually left the school and was taken into custody several miles away. Students initially returned to the campus two weeks after the shooting. But building 1200, where most of the victims were killed,\u00a0was closed off behind emergency tape with its windows covered. A\u00a0new building\u00a0later replaced the temporary classrooms students had been using in the wake of the slaughter. Survivors and family members of those killed in the shooting were given \u2014 at their request \u2014 private, individual tours in 2023 inside the 1200 building and described a tragic and grotesque scene, with blood stains in the areas where the victims had been killed, bullet holes puncturing the classrooms, and Valentine\u2019s Day candy still on students\u2019 desks. Other school shooting sites destroyed Many schools where mass shootings occur choose to demolish the sites of the massacres to ease the extraordinary trauma experienced by survivors, victims\u2019 families and the rest of the community. Four years after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting that killed 26, a newly rebuilt school opened to students \u2014 including fourth-graders who were kindergarteners during the bloodbath. Columbine High School also demolished its school library, where most of the carnage ensued during the 1999 shooting that killed 13, and replaced it with a newly built school library named the Hope Library. In Uvalde, Texas, where students at Robb Elementary School were marred by the slaughter of 19 children and two teachers in 2022, city officials have said they also plan to destroy the building. \u201cIn many cases, these schools are closed or entirely renovated in an attempt to decrease the traumatic reminders that they have become for community members,\u201d according to the\u00a0Center for Violence Prevention\u00a0at Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia.

{"id": "2024_06_13_us_amy-donofrio-florida-teacher", "text": "A former Jacksonville, Florida, teacher who said she was fired for displaying a Black Lives Matter flag outside her high school classroom will be able to reapply for her teaching license, an attorney representing the teacher confirmed to CNN. Attorney Mark Richard said a five-member panel of Florida\u2019s Education Practices Commission agreed with an administrative judge\u2019s recommendation that Amy Donofrio receive a written reprimand after state officials accused the teacher of bringing her personal views into the classroom. \u201cBlack students matter, and they are worth fighting for 100 percent every single day,\u201d Donofrio said after the hearing. \u201cTeachers across the state feel that way too.\u201d Donofrio said her goal remains to return to the classroom. Her contract with the school was not renewed after the 2020-21 school year. \u201cIt\u2019s a big day in Florida for teachers,\u201d Richard told CNN. \u201cYou can stand up to a system that\u2019s been attacking teachers and prevail.\u201d Thursday\u2019s hearing was prompted by administrative law judge Suzanne Van Wyk\u2019s April recommendation that Donofrio receive a written reprimand for\u00a0wearing and displaying face masks that read \u201cRobert E. Lee was a gang member\u201d as the district was in the process of renaming six schools. Donofrio was a beloved and highly regarded high school teacher in Jacksonville, where for years\u00a0she\u00a0sought to empower students and advocate for racial justice. Outside the room where she taught English to mostly Black students at the former Robert E. Lee High School she had placed a sign that read, \u201cHate Has No Home Here,\u201d according to the April order by an administrative law judge. \u201cMs. Donofrio was a pillar for us,\u201d former student Diamond Wallace, 24, told CNN this week. \u201cShe acted as a rock for us and she was more like a mom, like a second mom to all of us students.\u201d  At the start of the 2020 school year,\u00a0in the aftermath of\u00a0George Floyd\u2019s murder\u00a0at the hands of\u00a0police in Minneapolis, Donofrio,\u00a0who is White, put up a large \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d banner outside her classroom.\u00a0She had displayed\u00a0a BLM sign and t-shirt in her classroom as early as 2018, according to\u00a0findings in\u00a0the administrative judge\u2019s\u00a0recommendation. Administrators\u00a0asked her to remove it,\u00a0and expressed concern the display might violate school district\u00a0policy. Donofrio refused. She said she believed the policy did not apply to the banner.\u00a0On March 23, 2021, a school administrator removed the banner \u2013\u00a0about five months after she was first asked to bring it down. A day later Donofrio was reassigned to a work at a district warehouse. School officials had also voiced concerns that Donofrio\u00a0displayed Robert E. Lee face masks in her classroom\u00a0\u2013 which they considered to be an expression of her personal view. At the time the school district was in the process of renaming six schools named for Confederate generals.\u00a0Donofrio denied the masks \u2013 which were common during the pandemic \u2013 were on display. She said the logo \u201cI am not a gang member\u201d was a phrase students use as part of their advocacy of racial justice, according to the administrative judge\u2019s findings. Van\u00a0Wyk\u2019s order noted in part that the \u201coffense was not severe\u201d and there was no danger or harm to the public or students. The judge determined there was no evidence that Donofrio\u00a0\u201cfailed to distinguish between her personal views and those of the School, or District\u201d when she displayed the Black Lives Matter banner or that it went against district policy, according to her findings. The five-person panel of the Education Practices Commission \u2013 a member of law enforcement, a parent and three teachers \u2013 had the final say and could have revoked her teaching license. The quasi-judicial state agency imposes discipline on teachers and school administrators. \u201cI\u2019m not doing the thing that I was born to do, that I loved more than anything and I\u2019m having to fight to get it back,\u201d Donofrio, who taught at the school for nine years but has not been allowed back in a Florida classroom since 2021, told CNN earlier this week. She added, \u201cSchool is supposed to be a safe place for students. It\u2019s about them.\u201d Florida Education officials didn\u2019t respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment ahead of the hearing. The decision on Donofrio\u2019s future as a teacher came at a time when Florida\u2019s classrooms have become front lines in Gov. Ron DeSantis\u2019 culture wars, which have taken aim at\u00a0every aspect of education from\u00a0formal classroom\u00a0instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity to what\u00a0public\u00a0schools teach about racism and American history to what books students can read and what\u00a0bathrooms they can use. \u201cOur school system should be about educating kids not indoctrinating kids,\u201d\u00a0DeSantis told reporters in May 2023. \u2018I\u2019m a passionate, quality teacher\u2019 In 2021, the BLM banner\u00a0hanging over\u00a0Donofrio\u2019s\u00a0classroom door, as well as her outspokenness on racial justice,\u00a0became\u00a0a political flash point across the state. Her advocacy of racial justice was\u00a0brought up in discussions\u00a0about whether the school should abandon its Confederate namesake. The school was renamed Riverside High School in\u00a0June\u00a02021. Days before the banner was taken down, the district published a memo that stated \u201cemployees are not permitted to display flags, banners or other signage representing a particular social cause or movement in a manner that may be interpreted as District speech,\u201d and identified \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d as \u201can expression of support for a social justice movement,\u201d according to the administrative judge\u2019s\u00a0recommended\u00a0order. Florida\u2019s former education commissioner\u00a0called it an example of \u201cindoctrination\u201d and \u201ccritical race theory\u201d in schools \u2013 even though the discipline was not part of Donofrio\u2019s curriculum. \u201cThere was an entire classroom memorialized to Black Lives Matter,\u201d the former commissioner, Richard Corcoran, told reporters at the time. \u201cWe made sure she was terminated.\u201d Donofrio was not fired even as she defied multiple requests from school officials to take down the flag. She also challenged the district on its treatment of Black students and staff. Her students responded by collecting nearly 18,000 signatures on a public petition calling for her return. \u201cI wasn\u2019t removed for anything having to do with my teaching,\u201d Donofrio said. \u201cNo one has ever been able to say anything.\u00a0Nor of my test scores, right, reflected anything but that I\u2019m a passionate, quality teacher.\u201d Donofrio eventually sued Duval County Public Schools and its regional high school superintendent in federal court, alleging that the district retaliated against her \u201cfor her protected speech, her complaints about discrimination, and, more broadly, her support of Black students\u2019 lives,\u201d according to a complaint\u00a0filed in April 2021. The school board paid $300,000 to settle the lawsuit in 2021, according to CNN affiliate WJXT. \u201cI really thought that things were kind of moving forward and then suddenly, we turned human compassion into something that\u2019s controversial,\u201d Donofrio said. Donofrio\u2019s outspokenness on racial justice was not new. Even before she put out the Black Lives Matter flag, she had led a course for several years to empower Black students through professional development, college preparation and civic engagement. \u201cFor her to be able to make teenagers feel comfortable enough to come in her classroom and express the trauma that they have gone through voluntarily, that\u2019s a gift,\u201d said Wallace\u2019s mother, Renita Turner. Donofrio and her students\u00a0earned national attention, and the course eventually became the organization known as the\u00a0EVAC Movement.\u00a0Students traveled to the White House in 2016 and met with congressional leaders. Then-President Barack Obama met with them when he visited Jacksonville. \u201cIt is honestly the most beautiful thing I have ever been a part of,\u201d Donofrio recalled this week,\u00a0referring to the EVAC movement\u00a0and the attention it garnered for her students. \u201cTeachers have gathered to swing back in the name of teaching honest history, teaching honestly to their students,\u201d said Donofrio\u2019s lawyer, Mark Richard. \u201cWe do not want to be caught in these culture wars.\u201d Donofrio added, \u201cMy students matter, teachers who care about students matter \u2026 I have no doubt that with or without me, they\u2019re going to change the world.\u201d CNN\u2019s Harmeet Kaur contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/13/us/amy-donofrio-florida-teacher/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/15/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_14_investing_france-financial-crisis-elections", "text": "Investors are worried France could be facing a financial crisis if the political center collapses in upcoming parliamentary elections, leaving far-right populists in charge of the European Union\u2019s second-biggest economy. President Emmanuel Macron called the snap elections Sunday after his party lost to the\u00a0far right in a vote for EU lawmakers, a shock move that rattled markets for French stocks and government bonds. There has been widespread speculation since then that the National Rally,\u00a0the party of far-right doyenne Marine Le Pen, is poised to become the most powerful force in parliament, unseating Macron\u2019s centrist bloc. Such an outcome could make it harder to reduce France\u2019s huge government debt pile, equal to 110.6% of gross domestic product at the end of last year, and could even add to it. A bitterly divided parliament would also struggle to cut the budget deficit \u2014 the gap between government spending and tax receipts \u2014 which reached 5.5%\u00a0of GDP last year. \u201cIf Le Pen calls the shots in parliament and pursues major parts of her expensive fiscal and protectionist \u2018France first\u2019 agenda, the result could be a Liz Truss-style financial crisis,\u201d Berenberg economists wrote in a note Friday, adding that, for now, this was \u201ca\u00a0serious risk, not a forecast.\u201d The British pound and UK government bonds sold off sharply in September 2022 after former Prime Minister Truss unveiled plans to increase borrowing to pay for tax cuts. Mortgage rates soared as investors demanded much higher premiums for owning UK debt. Truss resigned soon after, becoming the shortest-serving prime minister in British history. The risk of something similar happening in France is real, according to the country\u2019s finance minister, Bruno Le Maire. Asked Friday on franceinfo, a French radio station, whether the political turmoil triggered by Macron\u2019s\u00a0decision to call the snap elections could lead to a financial crisis,\u00a0Le Maire\u00a0replied \u201cyes.\u201d He noted that France now has to pay a higher interest rate than Portugal \u2014 one of the countries bailed out during the European debt crisis more than a decade ago \u2014 to borrow from investors. \u201cThis comes down to the (parties\u2019) plans that are on the table, whether we can, yes or no, finance this debt,\u201d Le Maire said. Credit ratings agencies are already keeping a close eye on France, one of the EU\u2019s three most-indebted countries. In May, S&P\u00a0downgraded\u00a0the country\u2019s long-term credit score to AA-, citing the \u201cdeterioration of (its) budgetary position,\u201d though it still thought France had ample capacity to repay its debts. The agency said it expected the budget deficit to narrow to 3.5% of GDP in 2027, well above the 2.9% targeted by the current government. Markets are already roiled by the prospect of political upheaval. The yield, or the interest rate sought by investors, on France\u2019s benchmark 10-year government bonds stood at 3.17% on Friday afternoon in Europe, compared with 3.15% for the Portuguese equivalent. In another sign of traders\u2019 jitters, the premium they demand to hold French government bonds instead of the ultra-safe AAA-rated German equivalents rose Thursday to its highest level since 2017. The spread was widening even further Friday. Stock markets haven\u2019t escaped. On Friday, France\u2019s benchmark of 40 leading stocks fell much more than similar German and pan-European indexes. The euro has sagged this week too. An Elabe opinion poll for CNN affiliate BFMTV and La Tribune Dimanche showed Wednesday that Macron\u2019s centrist bloc was on track to come only third in the first round of the elections on June 30, far behind the National Rally and an alliance of left-wing parties. The National Rally has promised to raise public spending and slash VAT on electricity and fuel. Le Maire said Friday that markets\u2019 response to such measures would be: \u201cI\u2019m sorry but you don\u2019t have the means to afford these expenses.\u201d Likewise, speaking on a webinar Thursday, Frank Gill, a senior specialist in European sovereign ratings at S&P Global Ratings, said the policies advocated by the National Rally \u201ccould further drag on public finances\u201d and \u201cwould be a consideration for the sovereign rating.\u201d And Moody\u2019s said in a note Monday that the snap elections increased the risks to fiscal consolidation in France, \u201ca credit negative.\u201d The European Central Bank \u201cwould have the means to prevent any genuine crisis\u201d in the French government bond market, a Berenberg note said earlier this week. But \u201cakin to the sequence of events in the erstwhile euro crisis, the ECB may only deploy its instruments \u2014\u00a0or announce that it could do so\u00a0\u2014\u00a0if and when the country in question has returned to sounder fiscal policies.\u201d Joseph Ataman in Paris and Mark Thompson in London contributed reporting.

{"id": "2024_06_11_us_ucla-campus-palestine-protests-arrests", "text": "A total of 27 people were arrested after setting up multiple pro-Palestinian encampments on\u00a0UCLA\u2019s\u00a0campus Monday that police said were unlawful, according to a\u00a0statement\u00a0from\u00a0UCLA\u00a0leadership. At least six University of California Police Department personnel and other safety officers were injured during confrontations with protesters, including one person with a head injury, said Rick Braziel, UCLA\u2019s associate vice chancellor for campus safety, in\u00a0a release Tuesday.  UCPD Capt. Scott Scheffler said at least five of those arrested reported minor injuries, including soreness, bruises and shoulder pain. As a result of the encampments, the group damaged a fountain, spray-painted brick walkways, tampered with fire safety equipment, damaged patio furniture, stripped wire from electrical fixtures and vandalized vehicles, police said. Of the 27 arrested, 18 are UCLA students and two are faculty members, police said Wednesday. Of the other seven, one is a former student, and the rest are not affiliated with the university, according to police. Monday\u2019s incidents were \u201ccompletely unacceptable,\u201d Braziel said Tuesday. \u201cThe demonstration activity disregarded our values as a community, violated our campus policies and broke the law. These actions injured people, threatened the safety of our community and vandalized our campus,\u201d Braziel said. While protests spread at college campuses this spring denouncing Israel\u2019s handling of its war against Hamas in Gaza, UCLA\u2019s campus turned into a scene of brutality on April 30 when violent counterprotesters attacked pro-Palestinian demonstrators. A CNN analysis found that some of the most dramatic attacks caught on camera that night were committed by people outside UCLA \u2013 not the university students and faculty who were eventually arrested. But on Monday, a group of about 100 people associated with a\u00a0UCLA\u00a0registered student organization set up an encampment at the top of the Janss Steps around 3:15 p.m., UCPD said. The group resisted leaving the area after initial warnings but left after UCPD issued multiple dispersal orders. The protesters relocated to the Kerckhoff patio, where they \u201cset up an unauthorized and unlawful encampment with tents, canopies, and barricades with patio furniture,\u201d police said. The group also entered Moore Hall and disrupted nearby final exams, police said. Another round of dispersal orders led the group to the courtyard between Dodd Hall and the School of Law, where they set up a third encampment, according to police. UCLA Associate Professor Graeme Blair, a member of Faculty for Justice in Palestine, said one student went to a hospital after getting wounded by a rubber bullet \u2013 which Blair said was fired when students were in the camp near Dodd Hall, the Los Angeles Times reported. Blair, who has participated in the protests, criticized authorities, saying students had been following dispersal orders throughout the evening. CNN has reached out to Blair for comment. A UC police representative declined to comment on the arrests or say whether \u201cless than lethal\u201d weapons were used, the Times reported. UCLA police did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment Tuesday about the arrests and whether rubber bullets were used. On Monday evening, about 25 people were arrested around 8 p.m. for willful disruption of university operations, the police statement said. Those people were cited, issued a 14-day stay-away order from\u00a0UCLA\u00a0property and released, police said. Another person was previously arrested during the setup of the first encampment for interfering with a police officer. That person was cited and released, UCPD said. About 150 protesters remained in the area as of 10:30 p.m. Monday. The university expects more protests at various locations during commencement ceremonies but they \u201cwill not tolerate violence,\u201d Braziel said, adding university policies \u201csupport advocacy that does not jeopardize safety or disrupt university operations.\u201d \u201cProtecting UCLA faculty, staff, students and visitors and creating an environment conducive to teaching, learning, working and living continues to be our priority. The campus community belongs to all of us and we must model the respect we expect to receive from others,\u201d Braziel said. Tensions have simmered on the UCLA campus over how the university has responded to protesters and counterprotesters in recent months. Faculty members have been divided over whether Chancellor Gene Block \u201cfailed to ensure the safety of our students and grievously mishandled the events.\u201d This story has been updated with additional information CNN\u2019s Amanda Musa contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/11/us/ucla-campus-palestine-protests-arrests/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/15/2024", "section": "us"}}
