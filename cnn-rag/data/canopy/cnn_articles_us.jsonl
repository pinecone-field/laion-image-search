According to police in Commerce City, Colorado, about 10 miles northeast of Denver, a 32-year-old man was shot but escaped with only a puncture wound thanks to his silvery necklace. Witnesses told police the victim was shot at several times by his father after a reported argument on May 28, according to court records obtained by CNN. The father, 66, was arrested later that day and was believed to be intoxicated at the time of the incident, according to a police affidavit. The father faces a charge of first-degree attempted murder, the court records show. The .22 caliber bullet would have ended up in the victim\u2019s neck had it not instead become lodged in the necklace, police said; his 10-milimeter-wide chain was able to blunt the force of the bullet and prevent it from causing further damage. While the chain has been colloquially referred to as silver, the police department isn\u2019t sure. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what kind of metal this is, but it\u2019s likely not pure silver,\u201d they wrote. \u201cWe looked it up \u2026 and silver is soft.

{"id": "2024_06_04_business_ceo-pay-workers-inequality", "text": "CEOs are raking in fat pay packages as the US stock market booms. Bosses have always made more money than workers. But the gap between CEOs and employees is growing. The median CEO in the S&P 500 was paid 196 times as much as the median employee in 2023, according to an analysis by Equilar and The Associated Press. That\u2019s up from a ratio of 185 in 2022. The widening divide is driven by the fact that CEO pay \u2014 which is closely tied to share prices \u2014 is rising notably faster than that of employees. Many workers, in fact, are struggling to keep up with the cost of living. The jump in 2023 alone was significant. Median total compensation for S&P 500 CEOs (including stock awards) soared to $16.3 million in 2023 \u2014 a huge year-over-year increase of 12.6%, compared to just 0.9% in 2022. Workers made more money, too. But at a much slower pace. The median S&P 500 employee earned $81,467 last year, up 5.2% from 2022, the report said. To put it another way: The annual pay hike amounted to about $4,300 for workers. For CEOs, it was an extra $1.5 million. Those findings are likely frustrating to employees grappling with high costs for everything from groceries and daycare to car insurance. The rate of inflation in the United States has dropped, but it remains above normal. Paychecks are growing faster than prices, a turnaround from 2021 and 2022. Yet workers are still hurting from the cumulative impact of three years of high inflation. Americans are spending $1,015 more per month than they did in 2021 for the same basket of goods and services, according to Moody\u2019s Analytics. That spike in costs almost completely swallows up the increase in incomes, which are up $1,109 per month over that span, Moody\u2019s said. \u201cThe results show that boards and CEOs remain tone deaf related to outrageous pay packages,\u201d Eleanor Bloxham, CEO of The Value Alliance, a firm that advises boards on corporate governance, told CNN. Bloxham said boards and CEOs are \u201cabsolutely responsible\u201d for ensuring that workers share in financial success. \u201cTo not do so puts future earnings at risk because good workers will take action and vote with their feet,\u201d she added. Cashing in on the market boom CEO pay is closely related to the fate of the stock market. Although most CEOs earn a salary and get perks, most of their total compensation is typically from stock rewards. Stock awards made up about 70% of total compensation last year, according to the Equilar study. Given the rising stock market, the median stock award increased by 10.7% to $9.4 million, the report found. Last year, the S&P 500 soared 24% as investors breathed a sigh of relief that the economy did not plunge into a recession and looked forward to potential interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve. The Nasdaq surged by 43% last year, powered by the artificial intelligence boom. Even though the stubborn inflation has prevented the Fed from lowering rates so far this year, the S&P 500 has climbed another 11% since the start of the year to all-time highs.\u00a0That suggests CEO pay packages could get even bigger this year. The $162 million CEO No CEO in the S&P 500 came close to the total pay of Broadcom CEO Hock Tan, who raked in $161.8 million last year. Tan\u2019s massive payday was fueled almost entirely by stock awards after Broadcom\u2019s share price nearly doubled last year. The Broadcom CEO\u2019s compensation doubled in 2023, leaving him with 510 times the median salary of employees at the company. The next-closest CEO in terms of pay last year was FICO CEO William Lansing, according to Equilar. Lansing\u2019s total compensation hit $66.3 million last year. Apple CEO Tim Cook was the third-highest paid CEO in the S&P 500, raking in $63.2 million last year, 672 times that of the median Apple employee\u2019s pay of $94,118. The pay gap is even starker at some companies that rely on hourly, part-time workers. For instance, Barbara Rentler, the CEO of clothing retailer Ross Stores, received $18.1 million in total compensation last year. The median Ross employee \u2014 a part-time hourly retail store associate \u2014 made $8,618. That means Rentler made 2,100 times as much as her median employee.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/04/business/ceo-pay-workers-inequality/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/05/2024", "section": "us"}}

{"id": "2024_06_02_us_gabby-petito-mom-brian-laundrie", "text": "The mother of Gabby Petito, the 22-year-old whose case captured national attention\u00a0after she disappeared on a cross-country trip with her fianc\u00e9, has said she forgives him \u2013 but not his mother. Petito and fianc\u00e9 Brian Laundrie embarked on the trip in June 2021. Her family reported her missing that September,\u00a010 days after\u00a0Laundrie returned to his Florida home alone. Later that month, Petito was found dead in Wyoming\u00a0of \u201cstrangulation.\u201d\u00a0Laundrie himself then went missing, and his\u00a0remains were found\u00a0in October 2021. \u201cI speak for myself here when I say Brian, I forgive you,\u201d Petito\u2019s mother, Nichole Schmidt, said, speaking Friday at CrimeCon, a true crime convention in Nashville. \u201cI needed to release myself from the chains of anger and bitterness,\u00a0that\u00a0I refuse to let your despicable act define the rest of my life.\u201d \u201cYour atrocious decision to take a life, my daughter\u2019s life, has ignited a fire within me, a fierce determination to protect the innocent from falling victim to monsters like you,\u201d she continued. She also described his mother, Roberta Laundrie, as \u201cpure evil.\u201d Addressing Roberta Laundrie directly, Schmidt said, \u201cI see no empathy in your eyes, no remorse in your heart and no willingness to take responsibility for your actions.\u201d \u201cYou do not deserve forgiveness,\u201d she said. \u201cYou deserve to be forgotten.\u201d Schmidt called Laundrie\u2019s parents \u201ccomplicit in his cowardly flight from justice.\u201d They \u201chave added salt to our wounds\u201d and \u201caided and abetted him,\u201d she said. \u201cWe were denied the chance to confront our daughter\u2019s killer, to look him in the eye and express the profound pain his actions inflicted upon us,\u201d she said. \u201cThe unbearable weight of Gabby\u2019s absence is compounded by the sickening injustice of her murder remaining unpunished.\u201d CNN has reached out to the Laundrie family for comment. Petito\u2019s parents had\u00a0sued Laundrie\u2019s parents\u00a0for emotional distress, alleging they knew their son had killed his fianc\u00e9e\u00a0and likely knew the location of her body but deliberately withheld that information. The two families reached a settlement in February. Court documents showed Laundrie\u2019s parents acknowledged in depositions their son told them\u00a0Petito was \u201cgone\u201d\u00a0and he would need a lawyer in a frantic phone call on August 29, 2021, three weeks before Petito\u2019s remains\u00a0were found in Wyoming\u2019s Bridger-Teton National Forest. In\u00a0depositions\u00a0filed in the emotional distress lawsuit, Christopher and Roberta Laundrie denied being told by their son that he killed his fiance\u00e9, though Roberta Laundrie\u00a0later\u00a0said the thought \u201cprobably went through my mind.\u201d When Laundrie arrived back in Florida, his mother didn\u2019t ask him about what happened with Petito, following her attorney\u2019s advice not to talk about anything that might have happened, she said in the deposition. \u201cI was told not to ask, and so I just kept Brian close, kept him home and safe, and didn\u2019t talk to him about anything and hoped for the best,\u201d she said. When asked what she thought her son meant when he said Petito was \u201cgone,\u201d Roberta Laundrie said several possibilities ran through her mind, including that the couple may have gotten into a fight and Petito could have been considering pressing charges. Brian Laundrie\u2019s remains were discovered in a Florida nature reserve after a weekslong manhunt. A medical examiner determined\u00a0the 23-year-old man died by suicide, and authorities said they found writings nearby in which he\u00a0claimed responsibility for Petito\u2019s death. The FBI \u201cdid not identify any other individuals\u00a0other than Brian Laundrie\u00a0directly involved\u201d in her death. On Friday, Schmidt described her daughter, an aspiring travel influencer, as a \u201cbright light\u201d\u00a0and \u201ctalented artist.\u201d\u00a0She was \u201cfull of love, compassion, and boundless potential.\u201d Petito \u201chad a personality that can only be described as tenacious and free-spirited,\u201d she went on. \u201cWe will continue to honor her memory, to cherish the moments we shared and to fight tirelessly for justice and change in her name,\u201d Schmidt said. \u201cI implore you all, live by these simple words directly from Gabby: \u2018Just be a nicer person,\u2019\u201d she said. In November 2022,\u00a0a Florida judge ruled in favor\u00a0of Petito\u2019s family in a wrongful death suit against Brian Laundrie\u2019s estate, awarding $3 million to Petito\u2019s mother as the administrator of her daughter\u2019s estate.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/02/us/gabby-petito-mom-brian-laundrie/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/05/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_01_us_chad-daybell-murder-sentencing-death-penalty", "text": "Chad Daybell was sentenced to death Saturday upon the recommendation of the jury that convicted him of first-degree murder and conspiracy charges in the killings of his first wife and two children of his second wife. Daybell was convicted Thursday of first-degree murder and conspiracy charges in the deaths of his first wife, Tammy Daybell, and two of his second wife\u2019s children \u2013 16-year-old Tylee Ryan and 7-year-old Joshua \u201cJJ\u201d Vallow \u2013 in a case prosecutors claim was fueled by power, sex, money and apocalyptic spiritual beliefs. Judge Steven Boyce on Saturday formally imposed the death sentence after a jury, in a lengthy verdict form read in court earlier, said it found that penalty was appropriate under the law. The judge also imposed a 15-year prison sentence for insurance fraud charges. Daybell had a blank expression as Boyce sentenced him to death. The judge said jurors had \u201cfound beyond a reasonable doubt \u2026 that the aggravating circumstances when weighed against the mitigating circumstances do not make the imposition of the death penalty unjust.\u201d The sequestered jury began deliberating his fate Friday afternoon and mulled the case for six hours before ending for the night. Jurors continued deliberations Saturday about 8:30 a.m. MT, and at 10:45 a.m. the Ada County courts announced the verdict had been reached. Jurors heard contrasting portraits of the man from lawyers before beginning deliberations in a case that drew national attention in part because of what prosecutors described as the couple\u2019s \u201cdoomsday\u201d religious beliefs. The sensational triple murder was featured in a Netflix true-crime documentary in 2022. In his opening statement to the jury on Friday, prosecutor Rob Wood asked them to consider aggravating factors that would make Daybell eligible for the death penalty. First, the three murders, he said, were committed for remuneration. Daybell was also convicted of insurance fraud stemming from life insurance policies that allegedly paid him money after his first wife\u2019s death. His second wife, as well as Daybell, also were convicted of grand theft because she continued to draw Social Security benefits for her children after their deaths. Additionally, Wood told the jury, the murders of the three victims were \u201cespecially heinous, atrocious or cruel, manifesting exceptional depravity.\u201d \u201cThis defendant exhibited utter disregard for human life,\u201d Wood added. \u201cThe defendant, by his conduct, whether such conduct was before, during or after the commission of the murders at hand, has exhibited a propensity to commit murder, which will probably constitute a continuing threat to society.\u201d The prosecutor concluded, \u201cIt is your decision whether one or more of these aggravators has been proven. And if it has been, you must decide if, under these circumstances, imposition of the death penalty would be just or unjust.\u201d The verdict came about a year after Daybell\u2019s second wife, Lori Vallow Daybell, was also\u00a0convicted\u00a0of the murder of her children and sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. She was also convicted of conspiring to kill Tammy Daybell. Vallow Daybell has\u00a0appealed her convictions\u00a0to the state Supreme Court, with her legal team raising the issue of whether she was mentally competent to stand trial. Authorities have said they\u00a0believe Tylee and JJ were killed in September 2019\u00a0\u2013 the month they were last reported to have been seen \u2013 and that Tammy Daybell was\u00a0found dead\u00a0in her Idaho home on October 19, 2019, a\u00a0few weeks before Chad Daybell married Vallow Daybell. \u201cThis case has been about speaking for and seeking justice for the lives of three wonderful humans whose lives were cut way too short by the selfish desires of the defendant and his co-defendant Lori Vallow,\u201d Fremont County Prosecutor Lindsey Blake said in a release after the sentencing. The case was challenging, Blake said, both because of the complexities of the investigation and because of her own experience as a new mother during the prosecution. \u201cI can\u2019t begin to imagine the families\u2019 pain,\u201d she said. Wood said in a release after the sentencing that \u201cwhile nothing can undo the immense harm caused, we have worked tirelessly to secure a measure of justice.\u201d Addressing the jury Friday, defense lawyer John Prior portrayed Daybell as a once \u201cquiet, reserved, shy young man\u201d who grew up in Springville, Utah, a small, tight knit \u201ctown of faith.\u201d Daybell, his lawyer said, met his first wife, Tammy, and they were married for 29 years, raising five \u201cwonderful\u201d children \u201cvery deep in their faith, very deep in their commitment to family.\u201d But Daybell\u2019s life changed in late 2018, Prior said, when he met Vallow Daybell, who had already been married multiple times. \u201cEverything that glitters is not gold,\u201d he told jurors. \u201cLori Vallow glittered. She was not gold. She was the trajectory that changed the plan\u2026 Chaos hits and all of these things start cascading and this thing becomes very complicated and difficult.\u201d Prior said the new relationship with Vallow was like \u201cthis bomb dropped\u201d on the life of \u201cthe small town boy from Springville.\u201d \u201cWe have to look back at that,\u201d he said. \u201cYou examine what Chad Daybell\u2019s past was prior to the bomb being dropped, the Lori Vallow bomb being dropped\u2026 If it wasn\u2019t for that trajectory coming in and changing the path, is this where we would be going? It\u2019s not where we\u2019d be going.\u201d \u2018There\u2019s a hole in my heart\u2019 Jurors also heard from relatives of the victims on Friday. \u201cIt makes me angry and it destroys me to know Tammy was treated how she was,\u201d Tammy Daybell\u2019s father, Ron Douglas, told jurors. \u201cI find it comforting to know that Tammy is resting peacefully in Utah, buried alone and near her beloved mother.\u201d Kay Woodcock spoke about her grandson JJ and her step niece Tylee. \u201cI sit here today and try and explain the immense pain that me and everyone in my family continues to endure daily,\u201d she said. \u201cBut how do I do that?\u201d \u201cI can tell you there have been too many situations in the past few years where we were slammed with the fact that JJ won\u2019t hit another milestone,\u201d she said of her grandson. \u201cThe constant question remains: Who would he have become? What kind of man would he have been?\u201d Woodcock remembered Tylee as \u201cthe most precious, blond-haired, blue-eyed little girl\u201d and an \u201cabsolute mama\u2019s girl.\u201d Woodcock added, breaking into tears: \u201cThere\u2019s a hole in my heart, in the hearts of every member of my family, that can never be filled and will remain for the rest of my life.\u201d Tylee\u2019s aunt, Annie Cushing, remembered her walking around the house singing with \u201cthe voice of an angel.\u201d \u201cTylee had her whole life ahead of her. She had dignity, she had dreams, she had goals. This defendant stole all of that,\u201d Cushing said. Kelsee Douglas, Tammy\u2019s sister-in-law, told jurors that \u201cpain, fractured relationships and unhealed wounds are all part of the aftermath\u201d of the murders. \u201cThis is the legacy of anguish and sorrow that will haunt our family for generations,\u201d she added. Tammy\u2019s brother, Michael Douglas, lamented that \u201cthe nightmare fodder I have been provided will last me a lifetime.\u201d Daybell declined to address the court after the victim impact statements. Law enforcement found the remains of Tylee and JJ on Chad Daybell\u2019s Fremont County property\u00a0in June 2020, authorities said. \u201cIt\u2019s a sad day. JJ would have been 12 years old,\u201d JJ\u2019s grandfather, Larry Woodcock, said after the verdict Thursday. Woodcock remembered the victims, and asked the same question, over and over. \u201cWhat did they accomplish? Nothing. What did they do? They destroyed families,\u201d Woodcock said of Daybell and Lori Vallow Daybell. But the defendants, Larry Woodcock said, could not destroy the memories relatives have of the victims. \u201cThey can\u2019t take that,\u201d he added, growing emotional at one point. When he heard the jury verdict in court, he said, he felt like he couldn\u2019t breathe. \u2018Sex, money and power\u2019 were key focuses in the trial During opening statements, the prosecutor and defense attorney painted contrasting portraits of the defendant. The state described him as a power-hungry and grandiose man who would stop at nothing for \u201cwhat he considered his rightful destiny.\u201d His defense lawyer portrayed Daybell as a religious man driven into an unfortunate relationship by a \u201cbeautiful, vivacious woman\u201d who knew \u201chow to get what she wants.\u201d \u201cTwo dead children buried in the defendant Chad Daybell\u2019s backyard,\u201d Wood said in his first words to the jury at the start of trial. \u201cThe next month his wife is found dead in their marital bed. Seventeen days after the death of his wife, Tammy Daybell, this defendant is\u00a0photographed laughing and dancing on a beach in Hawaii at his wedding to Lori Vallow, a woman who was his mistress and the mother of the children buried\u00a0in the graves on his property. Three dead bodies.\u201d When Daybell \u201chad a chance at what he considered his rightful destiny,\u201d Wood said, he \u201cmade sure that no person and no law would stand in his way.\u201d \u201cHis desire for sex, money and power led him to pursue those ambitions,\u201d the prosecutor added. \u201cAnd this pursuit\u00a0led to the deaths of his wife and Lori\u2019s two innocent children.\u201d Tammy Daybell was initially believed to have died in her sleep, and Chad Daybell remarried less than three weeks after her death in 2019. Prior said Daybell\u2019s life began to change after he met Vallow Daybell, a \u201cbeautifully stunning woman\u201d who \u201cstarts giving him a lot of attention\u201d and eventually lured him into an \u201cinappropriate\u201d and \u201cunfortunate\u201d extramarital relationship. Vallow Daybell\u2019s two children from a previous marriage were last seen on different days in September 2019. Tylee Ryan was a \u201cnormal, vibrant teenage girl\u201d who loved her friends and her little brother, JJ, was on the autism spectrum and required special care, according to Wood. In late November 2019, relatives asked police in Rexburg, Idaho,\u00a0to do a welfare check on JJ because they hadn\u2019t talked to him recently. Police didn\u2019t find him at the family\u2019s house but did see Vallow Daybell and Daybell, who said JJ was staying with a family friend in Arizona, according to authorities. When police returned with a search warrant the next day, the couple was gone. They were ultimately found in Hawaii in January 2020. In June 2020, law enforcement officials found the remains of Tylee and JJ on Daybell\u2019s property in Fremont County, Idaho. Vallow Daybell and Daybell were indicted on murder charges in May 2021. Tylee was believed to have been killed between September 8 and 9, 2019, and JJ between September 22 and 23, according to prosecutors. \u201cWe are filled with unfathomable sadness that these two bright stars were stolen from us, and only hope that they died without pain or suffering,\u201d the families of the children said in a statement after the remains were found.

{"id": "2024_06_04_politics_trump-mail-in-early-voting", "text": "The Trump campaign on Tuesday announced a new program aimed at promoting absentee, mail-in and early in-person voting \u2013 practices that former President Donald Trump has disparaged for years while promoting false claims of widespread voter fraud in the 2020 presidential election. The new effort, dubbed \u201cSwamp The Vote USA,\u201d comes as\u00a0Republican officials ramp up calls for their voter base to embrace early voting and vote by mail options ahead of November\u2019s election. The new initiative is part of \u201cTrump Force 47,\u201d\u00a0which is sponsored by the Republican National\u00a0Committee and is focused on turning out voters in battleground states. It marks a sharp reversal from Trump\u2019s repeated calls to end the practice of mail-in voting altogether and his discouragement of Republicans from voting any other way but at the polls on Election Day. \u201cRepublicans must win and we will use every appropriate tool to beat the Democrats because they are destroying our country.\u00a0Whether you vote absentee, by mail, early in-person or on election day, we are going to protect the vote.\u00a0We make sure your ballot is secure and your voice is heard,\u201d Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, said in a statement Tuesday. After being projected the winner of the Iowa caucuses in January, Trump had declared in his victory speech: \u201cWe\u00a0have\u00a0to\u00a0get\u00a0rid\u00a0of\u00a0mail-in\u00a0ballots\u00a0because\u00a0once\u00a0you\u00a0have\u00a0mail-in\u00a0ballots,\u00a0you\u00a0have\u00a0crooked\u00a0elections.\u201d And Trump, after becoming the presumptive nominee, said in an interview with Britain\u2019s GB News in March that \u201cany time the mail is involved, you\u2019re going to have cheating.\u201d But as Republican officials urge the former president to embrace the voting methods ahead of November, Trump has made conflicting statements on the voting practices, oscillating between casting doubt and encouraging them. Trump posted on his social media site Truth Social last month, \u201cABSENTEE VOTING, EARLY VOTING, AND ELECTION DAY VOTING ARE ALL GOOD OPTIONS. REPUBLICANS MUST MAKE A PLAN, REGISTER, AND VOTE!\u201d The Trump-backed chairman of the RNC, Michael\u00a0Whatley,\u00a0has said encouraging Republican voters to vote early and by mail are \u201ctop priorities\u201d this election cycle.\u00a0Lara Trump, the co-chair of the RNC and Trump\u2019s daughter-in-law, has also publicly advocated for the GOP to embrace the practices. The new program builds on the RNC\u2019s\u00a0\u201cBank Your Vote\u201d campaign that was launched last year. The video announcing the initiative at the time included comments from Trump in support of it.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/04/politics/trump-mail-in-early-voting/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/05/2024", "section": "us"}}

Jordan Acker, who serves as a regent for the University of Michigan and partner for Goodman Acker, called the crime \u201can enormously difficult moment for me personally and for this entire community.\u201d\u00a0A regent is a state official elected to a board that oversees the university\u2019s governance. The incident\u00a0is the second in a matter of weeks that Acker said he was targeted. The law office\u00a0was graffitied with\u00a0phrases like, \u201cdivest now,\u201d and \u201cfree Palestine,\u201d on the building itself and on the sidewalk in front\u00a0of the building, pictures from the firm show. One message apparently directed toward the attorney reads, \u201cF**k you Acker.\u201d The Southfield Police Department is investigating the incident as a hate crime, Chief of Police Elvin Barren said at a Monday news conference, calling the vandalism \u201chorrific.\u201d The FBI, University of Michigan police and Huntington Woods police are assisting with the investigation, Barren added. \u201cMake no mistake that targeting individual Jewish elected officials is antisemitism,\u201d Acker said at the news conference. \u201cThis has nothing to do with Palestine, or the war in Gaza, or anything else. This is done as a message to scare Jews.\u201d \u2018An attack on our values and our mission,\u2019 founding partner says In a prior incident, a\u00a0masked intruder came to the door of\u00a0Acker\u2019s\u00a0home on May 15\u00a0at 4:30 a.m.,\u00a0he\u00a0said on\u00a0X, noting his three daughters were asleep at the time. He\u00a0called\u00a0that incident \u201cunacceptable\u201d and said he would not be intimidated. Barry Goodman, a founding partner of the firm, said Monday\u2019s incident \u201cwas not an attack on our office but an attack on our values and our mission.\u201d Goodman\u00a0went on to say the firm is not only owned by Jewish members, but also by Muslims and Christians. \u201cWe proudly serve all faiths, all races, and have been doing so for over 30 years,\u201d Goodman\u00a0said. \u201cThis is absolutely ridiculous; this is a crime.\u201d Goodman\u00a0said protesters are free to walk the sidewalk, hold signs, make statements, \u201ceverything that the Constitution allows, but they can\u2019t do this.\u201d Southfield police officers said a preliminary investigation revealed that four people were captured on surveillance video outside the law office Monday morning at 1:39 am, Barren said during the news conference. The individuals were at the office for about seven minutes, Barren said. CNN has reached out to police for the surveillance video. University of Michigan President Santa J. Ono called the incident \u201cunacceptable\u201d in a statement to CNN. \u201cThe vandalism that occurred at Regent Jordan Acker\u2019s place of business is shocking and unacceptable. Singling out this dedicated public servant and defacing his workplace in the middle of the night is an act of antisemitic cowardice that Southfield police have indicated is being investigated as a hate crime. Such harassment and attempts to intimidate have no place in a civil society and certainly no place in our university community,\u201d Ono said. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer described the vandalism as \u201cabhorrent\u201d in a statement. \u201cViolence, vandalism, threats, and intimidation are unacceptable, and what we saw today in Southfield is abhorrent,\u201d Whitmer said. \u201cWe must remain united in calling out hatred of any kind and continue working together toward peace in Michigan.\u201d Acker on Monday said he was \u201cdeeply grateful\u201d for the support \u201cfrom all walks of life\u201d he\u2019s received in the wake of the incident. \u201cI was not targeted here today because I am a regent. I am a target of this because I am Jewish.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/03/us/university-of-michigan-regent-law-firm-vandalism-antisemitic/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/05/2024", "section": "us"}}

It\u2019s one of the first such settlements reached as the university faces lawsuits and investigations from Jewish, Palestinian, Arab and pro-Palestinian students for allegedly failing to protect them after the October 7 Hamas attack on Israel heightened tensions on US college campuses. In late April, a lawsuit from the anonymous student said that their education had been disrupted by a hostile environment on campus, when pro-Palestinian protesters put up encampments on Columbia\u2019s lawn protesting Israel\u2019s war in Gaza and also occupied Hamilton Hall, a building on campus. As part of the settlement, Columbia said it is providing 24/7 walking escorts and safe entrances to campus. The settlement also said the school agreed to provide accommodations\u00a0\u201cfor students who were displaced from campus and couldn\u2019t finish exams or other important assignments\u201d after Columbia announced a hybrid learning model in late April. Columbia also created a \u201cSafe Passage Liaison,\u201d who will manage and coordinate the safe passage escorts. \u201cWe are pleased we\u2019ve been able to come to a resolution and remain committed to our number one priority: the safety of our campus so that all of our students can successfully pursue their education and meet their academic goals,\u201d a university spokesperson said in an emailed statement.

To those students and their families, I want to say to you clearly: You are a valued part of the Columbia community,\u201d Shafik said in that statement. \u201cThis is your campus too. We are committed to making Columbia safe for everyone, and to ensuring that you feel welcome and valued.\u201d In late April, Palestine Legal also filed a civil rights complaint with the US Department of Education\u2019s Office for Civil Rights, requesting an investigation into Columbia\u2019s treatment of Palestinian and pro-Palestinian students. The complaint alleged that for months, these students had \u201cbeen the target of extreme anti-Palestinian, anti-Arab, and Islamophobic harassment, including receiving multiple death threats, being harassed for wearing keffiyehs or hijab, doxed, stereotyped, being treated differently by high-ranking administrators.\u201d Columbia has three active Title VI investigations with the OCR since the encampment went up in April.

{"id": "2024_06_04_politics_takeaways-day-2-hunter-biden-federal-gun-trial", "text": "The second day of Hunter Biden\u2019s trial laid the groundwork for both sides of the case, as prosecutors and defense attorneys battled over the fundamental issue at play: whether Biden purchased a gun while addicted to drugs. In opening statements Tuesday, prosecutor Derek Hines made clear that President Joe Biden\u2019s son \u201cisn\u2019t charged with possessing drugs,\u201d but rather because he allegedly lied on a federal background check form. \u201cAddiction may not be a choice,\u201d Hines said, but it is a choice to illegally buy a gun. Hines continued: \u201cWe\u2019re here because of the defendant\u2019s lies and choices. \u2026 No one is above the law. It doesn\u2019t matter who you are or what your name is.\u201d Melissa Cohen Biden, Hunter Biden\u2019s wife, vigorously shook her head in disapproval when Hines argued that Biden knew he was an addict when he bought the gun. Defense attorney Abbe Lowell repeatedly highlighted during his opening statement that prosecutors needed \u201cto prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Hunter knowingly violated the law.\u201d Lowell emphasized that Biden\u2019s \u201cstate of mind\u201d when he purchased the gun was instrumental in the case. He also tried to humanize his client, saying that he abused alcohol and drugs \u201clike literally millions of people in this country\u201d and was plagued by various \u201ctraumas,\u201d including the 1972 car crash in Wilmington that killed his mother and gave him a brain injury when he was a child. At one point while Lowell was speaking, one juror appeared to become emotional, reaching for tissues in her bag and dabbed her eyes and her nose several times. Lowell, well into his statement, had explained how despite claims from prosecutors, the evidence doesn\u2019t show Biden was using drugs the day he bought the gun. Lowell was also discussing the tumultuous days when Hallie Biden found the gun and threw it in a trash can outside a supermarket. Here\u2019s what to know from Tuesday in court: Biden speaks \u2013 through his audiobook The first hour of witness testimony was consumed by prosecutors playing several long passages of the audiobook Biden narrated for his 2021 memoir, \u201cBeautiful Things.\u201d It droned on at times, but was also filled with gripping first-person storytelling about the depths of his addiction, spurring some jurors to listen closely and take notes. Many of those jurors said during the selection process Monday that they lost loved ones to drug overdoses and alcoholism, so Biden\u2019s personal struggles could strike a chord. In the excerpts played aloud in court Tuesday, chosen by the special counsel\u2019s office, Biden described intense \u201cfeelings of shame and guilt\u201d while crack plunged him into the \u201cdarkest recesses of your soul.\u201d He said he had a \u201climitless appetite for debasement\u201d that led to near-death experiences while he drove high in Arizona and bought drugs from homeless people in Los Angeles. Prosecutors highlighted a part of the book where Biden said he had \u201cfour years of active addiction\u201d from 2015 to 2019, which, importantly, would cover the time period when he bought a gun in October 2018. It\u2019s against the law for a drug user or addict to buy or possess a gun \u2013 which is the basis of the three felonies Biden is facing. First lady Jill Biden sat stoically while she listened to the recordings of her son airing out the worst moments of his life. She looked straight ahead at the FBI special agent on the witness stand, whom prosecutors used to introduce evidence from the memoir. Under cross-examination by Biden\u2019s lawyer, the FBI agent, Erika Jensen, conceded that Biden might not have been abusing drugs during the entire five-year period. Defense strategy Lowell laid out his version of the case and strategy moving forward in the morning opening statements and during cross-examination of the FBI agent in the afternoon. Not only did Lowell say that prosecutors must prove Biden knowingly violated the law when he bought the gun, but the attorney also argued that many of the text messages prosecutors had cited about the attempts to get drugs were months apart from when he purchased the firearm. During cross examination, Lowell noted that scores of the messages and pictures introduced to the jury through the FBI agent were in early 2019, months after Biden purchased the gun in October 2018. He also pointed out several discrepancies between Biden\u2019s memoir and text messages and travel logs presented by the FBI agent, indicating that not everything in the book \u2013 which is heavily cited by the government in its case \u2013 was completely factually accurate. Lowell said during his opening that text messages sent around the time Biden bought the weapon \u2013 including one where Biden said he was smoking crack \u2013 were actually about him trying to avoid Hallie Biden, who he was with at the time, and not doing drugs. In court, there were a few moments when Biden turned to his mom, his wife and his sister Ashley in the front row behind him. He mouthed words to his wife, who smiled. Jury sees lurid texts and photos Prosecutors also introduced a tranche of evidence that investigators obtained from Biden\u2019s electronics, including his infamous laptop. Their goal is to illustrate Biden abused drugs in 2018. They tried to accomplish this by playing a shirtless video of him holding what looked like a crack pipe, reading texts where he haphazardly tried to meet drug dealers in California and Massachusetts and showing his angry exchanges with his loved ones about his many personal failures. One exchange showed a drug dealer in Los Angeles trying to cut ties with Biden, complaining that he was going \u201cout of my way\u201d to get him drugs, at the cost of spending time with his own family. The dealer ended the text with, \u201cWe will always be friends, bro.\u201d In other messages, Biden said he was \u201csleeping on a car smoking crack\u201d at a street corner in downtown Wilmington that\u2019s only a few blocks away from the federal courthouse where the trial is under way. His defense attorneys claimed that he might not have really been doing drugs but rather was trying to avoid his ex-partner, Hallie Biden. Biden\u2019s laptop has been at the center of a yearslong political saga, with his team claiming it may have contained fake emails concocted by Russia, while many Republicans heralded it as ironclad proof that he and his father got rich from corrupt overseas deals. Prosecutors used the laptop much more narrowly, to try and prove that Biden used drugs in 2018. It was still a major moment when prosecutors unveiled the physical laptop for all in the courtroom to see. The silver MacBook has been bandied about in right-wing media for years, and the public saw it for the very first time on Tuesday. Biden\u2019s ex-wife likely to testify next Lowell will continue to cross-examine Jensen, who will then go through one last round of questions from prosecutors. During their opening arguments, prosecutors read the witnesses they expect to call during the trial in order, signaling that they would call Kathleen Buhle, Hunter Biden\u2019s ex-wife, to the stand second. In filings, prosecutors say that Biden\u2019s ex-wife will testify about finding drugs or paraphernalia on multiple occasions in his car.

{"id": "2024_06_01_us_bald-eagles-nick-nora-texas", "text": "The squawking cries from a pair of bald eagles pierce the treetops of an urban jungle on the edge of a popular lake in Dallas. The beloved eagles are perched 75 feet high over their nest, damaged by a violent storm system that ripped through North Texas on Tuesday. Inside the nest were the bald eagle\u2019s two 9-week-old eaglets, thrown from their sanctuary by hurricane-strength winds. The mother and father have spent the days since the storm circling and searching for their offspring on the ground below. The scene has been heartbreaking to watch for Chris Giblin, an amateur photographer who has spent three years documenting the eagles. \u201cIt hurts,\u201d said Giblin. \u201cIt hurts to see them hurting. Nothing is promised when these storms come through.\u201d This bald eagle family has developed a legion of followers and admirers since they made this spot around White Rock Lake in East Dallas their home nearly three years ago. They came to be known as \u201cNick\u201d and \u201cNora\u201d after the husband-and-wife detective characters in the 1930s film \u201cThe Thin Man.\u201d Their every move has been documented in neighborhood Facebook groups and by a devoted and highly protective contingent of photographers. The eagles have so intensely captured the imagination of the neighbors below them that residents speak of these raptors in mystical terms and their presence as \u201cdivine intervention.\u201d The eagle\u2019s nest sits in a sycamore tree at the end of Krista de la Harpe\u2019s street. She describes the relationship between the birds and the neighborhood as a \u201cthree-year love story.\u201d As the storm hit the city, she could only think about the eagles and their babies surviving the fierce winds and falling trees. \u201cI was in my closet all through the storm, just praying for them,\u201d de la Harpe said as she watched the eagles sitting in the trees this week. \u201cIt\u2019s so heartbreaking.\u201d \u2018I found one\u2019 After the storm passed, neighbors raced out to check on the nest and the eagles. Water was rushing over the banks of the creek below the nest. The fierce winds toppled a mix of large oak, cedar and American elm trees, and the eaglets were nowhere to be seen. Brett Johnson, an urban biologist and conservation manager for the City of Dallas, raced to the park after the storm. He saw half the nest was gone and that the two eaglets were missing. Later that morning, Bryna Thomson searched the creek area with neighbors when she heard her friend shouting, \u201cI found one. I found one. I found one.\u201d The video she captured shows an eaglet shivering and soaked in rain but seemingly not severely injured, even eating a fish it had caught in the floodwaters. \u201cThey were healthy babies,\u201d Thomson said. The neighbor called in to report what they had found. Johnson says he collaborated with state game wardens and US Fish and Wildlife Services to get permission to handle the federally protected bird and move it to a rehabilitation facility that specializes in treating bald eagles. The facility did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for an interview. Sunday morning, specialists with the Blackland Prairie Raptor Center brought the surviving eaglet back to its nesting area around White Rock Lake in hopes it will quickly reunite with its parents. Nick and Nora were seen flying around the area and specialists say they hope the parents will hear the eaglet squawking and return to care for it. The second eaglet has not been found and officials say it\u2019s likely the bird did not survive. Downed trees have made it impossible for searchers to safely access the spots where the eaglet might have fallen. The area is also home to bald eagle predators like coyotes and bobcats. The raptor specialists brought the recovered eaglet to the wooded area in a large crate. The bird\u2019s face was covered in a hood to keep it from seeing and experiencing this confusing environment. Hailey Lebaron, a rehab specialist with the Blackland Prairie Raptor Center, secured the eagle and carried it up the stairs and placed it in a makeshift nest that was made just for this moment. Lebaron removed the hood from the eagle\u2019s head and the bird immediately extended its wings and rustled around the nest. It reacted just the way the specialists wanted it to when the bird realized there was a strange creature \u2013 a human \u2013 so close to it. \u201cLuckily, it was not happy,\u201d Lebaron said. \u201cThe feathers raised up, which is their, \u2018Look at how scary I am.\u2019 It\u2019s a great sign for us.\u201d After the eaglet was recovered Tuesday, rehab specialists gave the raptor a full exam which included x-rays and blood work. The bird was deemed healthy enough to return to the wild after it was monitored for several days. By Friday afternoon, the rehab team knew it was racing against the clock. After a week of separation, it\u2019s more likely the parent eagles would abandon their offspring. \u201cWe had to jump into action,\u201d Lebaron said. \u201cIt\u2019s really, really time sensitive if we wanted it to work. Otherwise, the baby would be rejected by the parents.\u201d Rehab facility volunteers will now work in two-hour shifts until Monday evening to monitor the eaglet from about 100 yards away. If the parents do not return to the eaglet by then, officials say the bird will likely be brought back to the Blackland Prairie Raptor Center. If that happens, facility officials say they will then protect the bird until it can properly fly and learn how to hunt and take care of itself. At that point, the bald eagle would be released into the wild but in a different location, away from its territorial parents. Earlier in the week, Scott Meril, a retired medical doctor, came to the nesting area to capture photographs of the mourning eagle parents. The images show one of the eagles squawking into the sky with its head tilted back in a pose that seemed to capture the bird\u2019s desperation. Meril said he was struck by the eagle\u2019s majestic and powerful stare as they scanned the urban landscape looking for the eaglets. \u201cTo see them in Texas, it\u2019s wild,\u201d Meril said. \u2018You can\u2019t fight this stupid Texas weather\u2019 This isn\u2019t the first time tragedy has struck Nick and Nora\u2019s quest to bring a successful clutch of eggs into the world. In February 2022, the mating bald eagles built a nest in the same area near White Rock Lake. Residents came from across the city to catch a glimpse of the new stars of the neighborhood, waiting for the babies to hatch. But a severe storm with fierce winds ripped the nest and the tree branches apart. The eggs fell to the ground. \u201cThey have been through a lot,\u201d said Johnson. In 2023, Nick and Nora built a second nest around White Rock Lake but abandoned it and never laid eggs. Johnson says the nest was built in an area that was probably too close to the crowds of people who use the lake for recreation. This year, residents thought the eagles had finally succeeded. The eaglets were just a week or two away from being able to fly on their own. At that point, Nick and Nora would teach them how to hunt for their own food. The day before the storm Giblin captured stunning images of the small birds \u201cbranching\u201d out of their nests \u2013 the first attempts to jump from their nests onto nearby tree branches. The cycle of natural life seemed so close to becoming complete, but again nature intervened in a tragic way. \u201cThey just can\u2019t catch a break,\u201d Thomson said. \u201cThey were good parents, and it\u2019s just that you can\u2019t fight this stupid Texas weather.\u201d Yellowstone comes to Dallas While bald eagles can often be found near large cities, it remains rare for eagles to nest and mate in busy urban areas. This is why Giblin and a group of photographers have spent countless hours documenting the couple. Giblin, who works for a merchandising company, estimates he has snapped more than 20,000 pictures of the eagles since they started appearing regularly here three years ago. He\u2019s so dedicated, he once spent 7 hours waiting to capture a single shot of the eagles flying from their nest. He equates the bald eagles\u2019 presence in Dallas to having Yellowstone National Park in the city \u201cIn this metropolis, they chose to nest right here. It\u2019s absolutely crazy,\u201d Giblin said.\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m down here every weekend. I don\u2019t take it for granted.\u201d Thomson, a middle school science teacher, says the bald eagles have brought her neighborhood closer together. She often sets up a spotting scope connected to an iPad, which she calls \u201cEagle TV,\u201d so children can watch the eagles up-close. \u201cThey\u2019re the coolest birds ever,\u201d Thomson said. \u201cI\u2019m not really a bird person, but apparently I am. Because I sure do like the bald eagle.\u201d These Dallas eagle lovers worry years of disappointment might convince Nick and Nora to abandon their lives around their neighborhood lake and look to build a nest elsewhere. The majestic birds don\u2019t realize they\u2019re the main characters in a love story their neighbors don\u2019t want to end.

In August 2022, Rushdie was\u00a0stabbed several times onstage\u00a0shortly before he was due to deliver a lecture at the Chautauqua Institution in New York. Matar, then 24,\u00a0pleaded not guilty to charges of second-degree attempted murder and second-degree assault,\u00a0CNN previously reported. Matar\u2019s trial was\u00a0initially\u00a0set for January 8, 2024, but was\u00a0delayed\u00a0so his\u00a0defense could try to obtain information connected to\u00a0Rushdie\u2019s new memoir\u00a0\u201cKnife: Meditations After an Attempted Murder.\u201d Rushdie and Henry Reese, the event moderator who was\u00a0also injured in the attack, are both expected to testify in the upcoming trial, the Chautauqua County District Attorney\u2019s Office confirmed in an email. Rushdie lost an eye in the incident, where he was stabbed 15 times in 27 seconds by his attacker, who only stopped when audience members pulled him away, he said. The 76-year-old novelist \u2013 the son of a successful Muslim businessman in India \u2013 is\u00a0widely regarded as one of his generation\u2019s most important authors, but has received death threats ever since his 1988 novel \u201cThe Satanic Verses.\u201d In a phone call with CNN\u00a0on Tuesday, Matar\u2019s defense attorney Nathaniel Barone expressed concern about the ability to seat an impartial jury. \u201cThe scene of the incident is literally just five minutes away, it\u2019s right down the road,\u201d he said,\u00a0adding that he plans to request a change of venue for the trial. Barone said federal officials have also been conducting a \u201cworldwide investigation\u201d into Matar, now 26, but there has not yet been a federal indictment. \u201cI\u2019m getting ready for trial, I\u2019m getting ready to file every motion I have to make, and that\u2019s how we\u2019re approaching it,\u201d he said. Previously,\u00a0Barone told CNN\u00a0that Matar has maintained his innocence. \u201cThe one thing I\u2019ve stressed throughout this is, everyone is entitled to their day in court, and there\u2019s the presumption of innocence that\u2019s the most important constitutional right that we can have, any one of us,\u201d\u00a0he said in October.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/04/us/hadi-matar-salman-rushdie-stabbing/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/05/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_02_us_world-war-two-remains-dna-research-identify", "text": "Minutes before plunging to their deaths, five airmen successfully dropped 14 paratroopers from the 82nd Airborne near their landing mark over Normandy, France from their C-47. It was just after 2:44 a.m. on June 6, 1944. The airmen completed their mission but lost their lives. The remains of the pilot and crew chief were recovered days later but the co-pilot, navigator and radio operator were never found \u2013 possibly until now. Eighty years after the Normandy Invasion known as D-Day, the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency, operating under the Department of Defense, is looking for the three missing airmen with the hope of finally bringing them home. They have found what is believed to be the crash site of the downed C-47, along with the possible remains of the co-pilot, 2nd Lieutenant William Donohue; the radio operator, Staff Sergeant David Madson and the navigator, 2nd Lieutenant Albert Brooks. The remaining three airmen from the 304th Troop Carrier Squadron, 442nd Troop Carrier Group, 50th Troop Carrier Wing were never accounted for but never forgotten. Crew flies mission over France D-Day was the pivotal moment of the war in Europe to tip the balance in favor of the Allied Forces. Commonly referred to as \u201cthe beginning of the end\u201d of World War II, Dr. Eric Klinek, a historian with the agency, said it was the first major attack to move American forces into German-held territory following years of pressure from President Franklin D. Roosevelt to do so. The 101st and 82nd Airborne Divisions led the airborne assault in the earliest stages of Operation Overlord, which included more than 160,000 Allied troops landing along the beaches of Normandy to fight Nazi Germany. Paratroopers were instrumental in getting behind enemy lines to cut off German supply routes and expand Allied capability to take over terrestrial targets. If they survived their jump, they would fight on the ground as infantrymen for as long as it took to complete the mission. Their mode of transportation was the C-47, a military version of the civilian DC-3 airplane. Taking off from England at 11 p.m. on June 5 and crossing the English Channel, the 101st and 82nd Airborne Divisions were to be dropped behind Utah Beach a few hours before the naval invasion, Dr. Klinek said. On the morning of D-Day, there were 821 C-47s carrying more than 13,000 soldiers from the 101st and 82nd Airborne Divisions. Eighteen of them were shot down. Due to poor weather, communication interference and unexpected enemy fire, many of the troop drops were scattered. \u201cSome landed in their drop zones and others landed miles away. If a plane got hit, the best option was for the paratroopers to jump wherever they could,\u201d Dr. Klinek said. Faced with German anti-aircraft fire from an altitude of less than 1,200 feet, Donohue, Madson and Brooks, along with their fellow airmen: the crew chief, Major McKinley McCanless; and the pilot, 1st Lieutenant Samuel Williams Jr., did not have enough time to bail out or maneuver a successful crash landing after dropping their paratroopers. French eyewitnesses say their C-47 \u201cstruck the ground and burst into flames,\u201d killing all five men, according to agency records. A crash site rediscovered In 2016, the agency received a tip the crash site had been rediscovered on farmland in Normandy. They sent a team in 2019 to evaluate the site and what they found was \u201cpart of an air speed indicator and part of a C-47 load adjuster,\u201d Dr. Klinek said, who was part of the initial evaluation on the ground. \u201cWe knew based on all the evidence from the French researchers to all the documents we had that this was the plane,\u201d he said. Dr. Klinek said the agency only pursues crash sites where missing soldiers could be found, so they launched an excavation site on April 12 with the goal of retrieving every possible piece of wreckage or evidence of human remains. At the excavation site, a team of 25 people conducted labor-intensive work every day for six weeks straight. Using an excavator and shovels to create dozens of grids, they swept the area for high concentrations of metal, then pressure washed and sifted every square inch of soil capable of containing even the smallest piece of evidence. \u201cWe actually hit the ground running with findings,\u201d Capt. Brian Foxworth, the search team leader, said. From potential life support items such as \u201cparachute buckles, fragments of headsets, and standard issue flashlights that every service member would be issued and carry on their person,\u201d Foxworth explained, to \u201cpossible osseous material.\u201d Osseous material includes anything related to human remains, Foxworth explained. \u201cWhether it\u2019s bone fragment to teeth, anything that you could potentially link to a person that could provide a DNA sample or provide what\u2019s needed to match up dental records, all of those things, that\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to pull back with us to the lab.\u201d Foxworth and the agency emphasize the word \u201cpossible\u201d with everything they find to maintain extreme precision and a cautious respect for families who have waited for decades to learn about the whereabouts of their loved ones\u2019 remains. Even when excavators are certain about specific items, everything must be sent to an agency lab for proper forensic testing before anything can be verified or concluded. \u201cEverything is possible,\u201d Master Sergeant Raul Castillo, the team\u2019s life support investigator, said. Holding a shining key-shaped metal object on a cloth next to five small items caked with dirt, Castillo said, \u201cWe found this on the surface and it\u2019s in a pretty good state, it\u2019s part of a headset \u2026 it\u2019s all possible from aircrew members \u2026 we won\u2019t know until we get back.\u201d Castillo\u2019s role is to identify each object being pulled from the ground, some of which may have been life support equipment assigned to the flight crew or paratroopers on the C-47. He was able to confirm each item uncovered so far had been from the 1940s. Searching wreckage for a link The excavation team wrapped up their work at the dig site at the end of May. All uncovered items are being transferred to an agency laboratory at Offutt Air Force Base in Nebraska, where they will be cataloged and tested by a team of forensic scientists led by Carrie Brown, lab manager and forensic anthropologist. \u201cA lot of times with these recoveries from Europe \u2026 especially if they have been in the ground for 80 years, you\u2019re getting fragments of bone,\u201d Brown said. She said bones found in Europe are generally well-preserved. \u201cNon-biological items such as watches, boots, ID tags, jewelry, those types of things, would get an analyst,\u201d Brown said, explaining items such as teeth and skeletal material would be separated, inventoried and assigned to analysts as well. To test for DNA samples, Brown said a minimum of one gram of dense bone is needed. The results are then compared to a DNA sample from the missing service member\u2019s medical file. \u201cIn order to make that identification, you have to get both sides to match up. If I don\u2019t have any dental records or medical records or a DNA sample \u2013 it doesn\u2019t matter how much really great data I can collect from what I have in the lab \u2013 I can never match those up,\u201d Brown said. The agency is responsible for doing background research, getting excavation teams out to the field, and conducting lab analysis. The best quality DNA samples are sent to the Armed Forces Medical Examiner System\u2019s DNA identification lab at Dover Air Force Base in Delaware to confirm the identification. Once confirmed, the Army Past Conflict Repatriation Branch connects with family members to collect reference samples to potentially match the DNA. It can take up to a year and a half from conducting the field recovery to making a positive identification. Brown described herself and her team as civil servants dedicated to returning their nation\u2019s fallen. Though the processes can be grueling, and each case may have its own obstacles along the way, \u201cYou can\u2019t get past that human component,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019ve put all these pieces together and now it links up with a person with a story.\u201d Brown said the first thing guests see when they enter the DPAA lab is the part of the Soldier\u2019s Creed, which says, \u201cI will never leave a fallen comrade.\u201d \u201cIt says everything about us as a nation, it says we are not going to give up. And if you\u2019ve fallen overseas, we are going to keep searching for you no matter what it takes,\u201d she said. Reconnecting across generations The families of Donohue, Madson and Brooks have been notified by the agency they are currently looking for their loved ones\u2019 remains, and the process may take time. The agency meets with families of missing service members throughout the year at Family Member Updates to brief relatives about their specific cases and answer any questions people may have about recovery efforts. Paul Stouffer knows firsthand the impact the agency has on families of fallen soldiers who are searching for answers about their loved ones. He is the nephew of a World War II fighter pilot named Lieutenant William McGowan, who was shot down on D-Day in a P-47 single-engine fighter aircraft. McGowan was only 23 years old when he died, and Stouffer spent his whole life watching his mother and grandparents pursue details about his death, and where his remains could have possibly ended up. After the war, the American Graves Registration Service located the P-47 crash site but did not find McGowan\u2019s remains at the time. His name was engraved on the Wall of the Missing at the Normandy American cemetery. In 2009, Stouffer heard about other missing service members being accounted for and reached out to the agency to offer his DNA samples for analysis. In 2018, the agency excavated his uncle\u2019s crash site and recovered human remains, which were identified the following year as McGowan. Stouffer attended his burial service at the American Cemetery in Normandy in 2022 and gave the eulogy for an uncle he had always dreamed about, but never met. \u201cIt was the phone call that I wish my grandparents had got, or even later, I wish my mom had been alive for that moment as well,\u201d Stouffer said. \u201cOne of the things that really stuck with me is knowing that after my mother was gone, that he would not be forgotten.\u201d Stouffer watched during the burial ceremony in Normandy as a rosette was placed on the Wall of the Missing next to McGowan\u2019s name, signifying that he had been found. If ye break faith with us who die, we shall not sleep World War II still has 72,000 American soldiers who are unaccounted for, according to the agency. It\u2019s conducting operations year-round in 45 countries, working to recover the remains of fallen U.S. soldiers and uphold the promise of the United States Military to \u201cleave no man behind.\u201d The agency handles each case of a missing person with dignity and respect for those who gave their lives for their country. They work under strict protocols and protective processes to ensure they get every detail correct, leaving no grain of sand unsifted. When missing service members are identified, the agency gives family members the option to have the remains buried with full military honors back home, or to receive the same honors in a burial abroad where they died. Photos of the three missing airmen were stationed at the dig site, providing what the team calls intrinsic motivation along their search. Foxworth said after 17 years in the Air Force, this was one of his most important missions. He has been on other recovery efforts with the agency, but says this operation hits a little closer to home. \u201cWe sign the dotted line knowing what that means. It may require us sacrificing our own lives. One of the mottoes we have is we\u2019ll never leave an airman behind, so this is us fulfilling that obligation. And it\u2019s an obligation that I\u2019m extremely lucky to be a part of,\u201d Foxworth said. \u201cNo matter how long it takes\u2026 we won\u2019t stop. We\u2019ll keep searching.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/02/us/world-war-two-remains-dna-research-identify/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/05/2024", "section": "us"}}

Monday\u2019s shooting happened as the officers were \u201caddressing\u201d a pattern of robberies in Queens involving suspects on mopeds and scooters, according to New York Police Commissioner Edward Caban. The suspect, 19-year-old Bernardo Raul Castro Mata, is an undocumented migrant from Venezuela living at a former hotel repurposed as a migrant shelter in Queens, Kenny\u00a0said at a news conference Monday. The Queens District Attorney\u2019s office said Mata has not been arraigned and does not have a defense attorney. The office told CNN unless he hires his own attorney, he would be assigned one for his upcoming arraignment. The officers encountered a man later identified as Mata driving a moped in the wrong direction down a street and tried to pull him over but the man ran away and the officers chased him on foot for several blocks, Caban said. Mata opened fired on the police officers, who fired back, according to Caban. One police officer was shot in the leg, while the other was shot in his bullet-resistant vest. \u201cWe visited the officers and their families a few moments ago.

The Corral Fire began in the City of Tracy around 2:30 p.m. and had consumed 14,000 acres as of Sunday evening, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. The flames were 50% contained, the department said on X. The cause of the fire is under investigation, according to the department. The fire forced evacuations in Tracy, California, and some surrounding areas over the weekend, but the evacuation orders were downgraded to warnings on Sunday afternoon. But the evacuees were warned to the situation could change again as gusty winds and hotter temperatures return. \u201cResidents are advised to remain vigilant and prepared for potential changes,\u201d CalFire warned in a news release. Two Alameda County firefighters were injured while responding to the\u00a0fire,\u00a0Cal Fire Battalion Chief Josh Silveira told CNN early Sunday morning. They had minor to moderate injuries and were transported to a local hospital for evaluation and treatment, Silveira said. \u201cPraying for our Tracy neighbors and first responders,\u201d Mayor Kevin J Lincoln, of the neighboring City of Stockton, said on social media late Saturday night. A section of I-580 was closed in both directions due to the \u201cmajor grass fire, smoke, and zero visibility,\u201d according to the\u00a0California Department of Transportation. It has since reopened. The fire could spread again Tuesday in gusty winds up to 30 mph, according to the National Weather Service in Sacramento.

Andy Kim will win the Democratic nomination for Senate in New Jersey, CNN projects, setting him up as the favorite to succeed indicted\u00a0Sen. Bob Menendez in this deep-blue state. Kim, a three-term congressman from South Jersey, entered the race in September, the day after Menendez was indicted on bribery and corruption charges. He\u00a0quickly emerged as the favorite even with\u00a0New Jersey first lady Tammy Murphy launching her campaign later that fall. But in the face of\u00a0mounting nepotism charges and a grassroots progressive\u00a0backlash, Murphy dropped out of the race in March. With Murphy\u2019s exit, Kim\u00a0appeared to be on a glide path to the Senate in a state that last elected a Republican to the chamber in 1972. Menendez, who is on trial in New York City, announced in March that he would not seek reelection in the Democratic primary. But on Monday, he filed to run as an independent \u2013 a move that could make the race more unpredictable, with control of the Senate hanging in the balance. Democrats hold a narrow majority in the chamber but face a difficult landscape this fall. A 41-year-old former diplomat and the son of Korean immigrants, Kim was the first Asian American elected to Congress from\u00a0New Jersey. His\u00a0anti-corruption message and the success of his high-profile legal challenge to New Jersey Democrats\u2019 unbalanced ballot design \u2013 which favored party machine-backed candidates \u2013 quickly made the congressman a hero to progressives. Longtime congressman defeats primary challenge over Gaza war Democratic\u00a0Rep. Bill Pascrell will fend off a primary challenge in New Jersey\u2019s 9th Congressional District, CNN projects, defeating Mohamed Khairullah, the mayor of Prospect Park, who was critical of the congressman\u2019s support for Israel\u2019s war in Gaza. Pascrell, 87, first entered Congress in 1997 and had\u00a0rarely been faced with a serious primary contest. A staunch supporter of Israel for decades, he had long\u00a0benefited from a place atop the ballot under New Jersey\u2019s arcane \u201ccounty line\u201d system \u2013 which was discarded this year\u00a0after a court battle. Khairullah, who is Muslim, made headlines last year after he was turned away from an Eid reception at the White House to mark the end of Ramadan. During the campaign, he charged Pascrell with turning his back on the district\u2019s Muslim community by failing to respond more forcefully to Israel\u2019s war in Gaza. The district is home to a large population of Palestinian and Jewish voters, which has further elevated the issue. Pascrell in March called for a \u201cconditional ceasefire\u201d but held back in criticizing the Israeli government. \u201cThe scale of suffering in Gaza is ghastly and unacceptable, and my heart aches for those affected,\u201d Pascrell said\u00a0in a statement at the time. \u201cOnly with a ceasefire of hostilities can we provide the robust support and medical care necessary to address this crisis of historic proportion.\u201d Three months later, the\u00a0Israeli offensive continues, with humanitarian aid only trickling into the besieged enclave\u00a0as the civilian death toll rises.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/04/politics/new-jersey-primary/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/05/2024", "section": "us"}}

{"id": "2024_06_04_us_undocumented-migrant-nypd-shooting-ice", "text": "An undocumented migrant accused of shooting two New York City police officers on Monday had his immigration case dismissed by a judge less than a month ago, according to US Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Bernardo Raul Castro-Mata, a 19-year-old from Venezuela, opened fire on two officers after they tried to stop him for riding a scooter in the wrong direction in Queens, police said. The officers were treated and released from the hospital later the same day. Castro-Mata entered the US illegally through Eagle Pass, Texas, last July, a spokesperson for ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations in New York confirmed to CNN. He was released and ordered to report to immigration court where his case was subsequently dismissed. The US Border Patrol \u201creleased Castro-Mata on his own recognizance\u201d and ordered him to report to the nearest enforcement and removal operations office, according to ICE. A Department of Justice immigration judge dismissed removal proceedings against Castro-Mata on May 6, the spokesperson said in a statement. ICE did not provide information about why Castro-Mata\u2019s case was dismissed. Castro-Mata remains in custody following the shooting, and ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations has lodged an immigration detainer against him, according to the spokesperson. Immigration detainers are typically issued against noncitizens who are arrested for criminal activity and taken into custody by state or local government. The shooting comes as the number of undocumented migrants who have arrived\u00a0in\u00a0New York City\u00a0since the spring of 2022 \u2013 when officials in some US border states began sending many of them north after they crossed from Mexico \u2013 surpassed 200,000, according to city officials. More than 65,000 continue to be\u00a0in\u00a0the city\u2019s care across more than 200 emergency shelters, according to the administration of Mayor Eric Adams, who has called on the federal government to do more to help cover the financial burden of the migrant crisis. \u201cYou just gotta be honest about this and everyone wants to romanticize this issue and just act like, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s no big thing,\u2019 \u201d Adams told reporters Tuesday, referring to the migrant surge. \u201cNo, no. This is a serious issue that this administration is attempting to resolve and we have to fix this issue.\u201d Castro-Mata was shot in the leg during an exchange of gunfire with police and he is expected to recover, according to Joe Kenny, the NYPD chief of detectives. The shooting occurred Monday as the officers were addressing a pattern of robberies in Queens involving suspects on mopeds and scooters, said New York Police Commissioner Edward Caban. Castro-Mata is an undocumented migrant living at a former hotel repurposed as a migrant shelter in Queens, Kenny\u00a0said at a news conference Monday. The Queens District Attorney\u2019s Office said Monday Castro-Mata had not been arraigned and did not have a defense attorney. The office told CNN unless he hires his own attorney, he will be assigned one for his upcoming arraignment. The officers on Monday encountered a man later identified as Castro-Mata driving a moped in the wrong direction down a street and tried to pull him over but the man ran away and the officers chased him on foot for several blocks, Caban said. Castro-Mata opened fire on the police officers, who fired back, according to Caban. One police officer was shot in the leg, while the other was shot in his bullet-resistant vest. Castro-Mata has no prior arrests in New York City but is a suspect in several robberies in Queens, Kenny said at the news conference. He was operating an unregistered motorbike, Kenny said. \u201cSimilar scooters and bikes are being used citywide to commit crimes. These crimes include shootings, robberies and phone snatches,\u201d Kenny said. Police have identified 80 \u201crobbery patterns\u201d across the city, encompassing hundreds of incidents in which perpetrators rode scooters or motorcycles, according to Kenny.

{"id": "2024_06_03_us_edward-blum-fearless-fund-appeal-ruling-reaj", "text": "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th\u00a0Circuit has blocked a Black-owned venture capitalist firm from awarding grants exclusively to Black women entrepreneurs. In an opinion released Monday, the judges ruled that the Fearless Fund\u2019s Fearless Strivers Grant Contest is \u201csubstantially likely to violate\u201d the provisions of\u00a0Title 42 of the US Code, which ensures equal rights under the law and prohibits the use of race when awarding and enforcing contracts. In the ruling, the\u00a0appellate court\u00a0ordered\u00a0a federal court in Georgia to enter\u00a0a preliminary injunction blocking the fund from closing its grant application process while the case continues to be litigated. It also states that the\u00a0fund\u2019s\u00a0program is unlikely to be protected by the First Amendment. The court\u2019s decision marks a victory for anti-affirmative action legal strategist Edward Blum, who filed a lawsuit last August against the fund on behalf of his group American Alliance for Equal Rights. AAER attorneys have argued that their members, who were unnamed in the lawsuit, were excluded from the grant\u00a0program because they weren\u2019t Black and that they faced \u201cadditional harm\u201d from the illegal act of racial discrimination, CNN previously reported. Blum, the legal strategist behind the Supreme Court case that\u00a0dismantled affirmative action\u00a0in college admissions last year,\u00a0said in a statement Monday that he was \u201cgrateful\u201d for the court\u2019s ruling. \u201cOur nation\u2019s civil rights laws do not permit racial distinctions because\u00a0some groups are overrepresented in various endeavors, while others are under-represented,\u201d Blum said. \u201cPrograms that exclude certain individuals because of their race such as the ones the Fearless Fund has designed and implemented are unjust and polarizing. Significant majorities of all Americans believe that an individual\u2019s race should not be a factor in our nation\u2019s public policies.\u201d Arian Simone, CEO and founding partner of Fearless Fund and founder of the Fearless Foundation, said in a statement to CNN Monday that\u00a0the court\u2019s ruling was \u201cdevastating.\u201d \u201cI am shattered for every girl of color who has a dream but will grow up in a nation determined not to give her a shot to live it,\u201d Simone said. \u201cOn their behalf, we will turn the pain into purpose and fight with all our might.\u201d Simone said the ruling sends a message that diversity in corporate America and education should not exist. \u201cAmerica is supposed to be a nation where one has the freedom to achieve, the freedom to earn, and the freedom to prosper,\u201d she said. \u201cYet, when we have attempted to level the playing field for underrepresented groups, our freedoms were stifled.\u201d Eleventh Circuit Judge Robin Rosenbaum issued a dissenting opinion in the case, arguing that Blum\u2019s lawsuit is the equivalent of an athlete \u201cflopping\u201d on the field to draw a foul. \u201cAs American Alliance has portrayed its members\u2019 alleged injuries, it has shown nothing more than flopping on the field,\u201d Rosenbaum wrote in the opinion. \u201cAlthough three of American Alliance\u2019s members pay lip service to the idea they are \u2018ready and able\u2019 to participate in Fearless\u2019 Contest, their declarations show, in context, that none has a genuine interest in actually entering the Contest.\u201d In September 2023, the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta\u00a0granted\u00a0the AAER\u2019s motion for an injunction, which halted the program for the duration of the AAER\u2019s lawsuit. The Fearless Fund later challenged that ruling and its attorneys presented oral arguments to the appeals court in January. The legal battle over the venture capitalist firm\u2019s grant program\u00a0comes amid a\u00a0string of attacks\u00a0against diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs in corporate America, schools and higher education in recent months. Blum and other conservative strategists have filed lawsuits against organizations challenging their race-based programs. In March, the Smithsonian\u2019s National Museum of the American Latino settled a lawsuit with the AAER that required the museum to open its Latino-focused internship program to students of all races and ethnicities. Black business leaders say\u00a0they fear these efforts\u00a0to dismantle DEI programs stand to undo decades of progress toward leveling the playing field for Black and brown people.

{"id": "2024_06_03_us_atlanta-boil-water-advisory", "text": "Atlanta remains under a state of emergency Monday as it battles disruptions to its water service that began last week, leaving a swath of a major city under boil-water advisories and highlighting the pervasiveness of problems caused by America\u2019s aging infrastructure. \u201cWe are currently coordinating with the US Army Corps of Engineers. We have sought their assistance because they have the most experience in handling a crisis like this,\u201d Mayor Andre Dickens announced in a statement Monday. \u201cThey will help us develop a plan to assess and evaluate our aging infrastructure.\u201d US Army Corps of Engineers will arrive Tuesday, city officials said. \u201cWhat we have found, in digging and digging and digging and looking at pipes, we are repairing pipes from 1920s, 1930s, 1940s, and our infrastructure is crumbling,\u201d Atlanta Chief Operating Officer LaChandra Burks said at a Monday afternoon city council meeting. City officials plan to partner with federal teams to assess how to improve the city\u2019s infrastructure, she said, adding that while improvements will not prevent water main breaks, they will allow for quicker repairs. The city has been plagued by water woes since Friday, when the first two of a series of water main breaks emerged along two pipes \u2013 one a 36-inch pipe, the other a 48-inch pipe \u2013 that Dickens said were about a century old. One of the pipes that failed was installed in 1910, while another dated to 1930, the mayor said. Repairs were completed on one break near downtown Saturday evening, hours before Dickens declared a state of emergency. On Monday, the city\u2019s watershed management department lifted a boil water advisory that had been in effect since Friday for the area. City officials said public water was safe to use for all purposes. Repairs on the other break, at 11th and West Peachtree streets in Midtown, have yet to be completed, and crews were working on it Monday. Around 1 a.m., crews began turning off water to several blocks within the area, causing a geyser erupting from the break to eventually dissipate, Dickens said at a news conference held at the scene later in the day. His administration is \u201claser-focused\u201d on addressing the issue, he said. A boil water advisory remained in place Monday for that area, city officials said.  Officials were \u201cpleased with the direction that the repairs are going now,\u201d said Al Wiggins Jr., the director of the city\u2019s Department of Watershed Management. He would not provide a timeline for the restoration of service. As of Monday morning, officials did not have a reason to believe the water main breaks were connected, Wiggins said, though he noted crews had not yet been able to conduct a thorough inspection in Midtown. Dickens said there were \u201csome minor breaks\u201d Sunday, two of which he visited: one at 1190 Atlantic Ave., near the Atlantic Station shopping district, and the other in the city\u2019s Candler Park neighborhood. The Department of Watershed Management said repairs were completed on the latter by Sunday afternoon, restoring water to 35 homes. Fire and police officials who also spoke at the Monday news conference said their departments are distributing water in areas where water has been turned off and emphasized that first-responder services have not been impacted. Collectively, the breaks and repairs in progress have left parts of the city without water or under boil water advisories, forcing businesses and tourist attractions including the Georgia Aquarium and World of Coca-Cola to shut down. Events, including two Megan Thee Stallion concerts scheduled for Friday and Saturday at State Farm Arena, were postponed. The disruptions prompted Emory University Hospital Midtown to transfer dialysis patients to other hospitals and divert ambulances from its emergency department \u2013 though it resumed normal operations on Sunday, a spokesperson said. Atlanta Public Schools\u2019 summer school and programs were not held Monday, and programs \u201cwill reconvene once the boil water advisories have been lifted,\u201d a notice from the school district said. Non-essential employees have been told to work remotely. On Monday, the mayor announced there will be a financial relief program to help \u201csmall businesses impacted by the recent water crisis.\u201d The program will provide funds to businesses who faced losses as a result of the water issues, Dickens said, urging residents to \u201cstay tuned for more details on how to apply.\u201d \ufeffIn the meantime, the city has designated six fire stations where impacted residents are able to pick up water, according to the Department of Watershed Management. \u201cI know it has been a tough and frustrating day for many of you,\u201d Dickens said Saturday in declaring the state of emergency, which allows the city to expedite access to resources for the repairs. \u201cWe all take\u00a0this matter very seriously.\u201d Atlanta\u2019s troubles in recent days are indicative of a broader issue with decaying infrastructure across the country. In the US and Canada, around\u00a0260,000 water main breaks\u00a0cost $2.6 billion each year, according to a December 2023 study from Utah State University. The study noted the average age of failing water mains is around 53 years and 33% of US and Canadian water mains are over 50 years old. \u2018I take it seriously,\u2019 mayor says of criticism Dickens and the city have faced criticism in the wake of the water main breaks, in part over the pace of the response. The mayor \u2013 who\u2019s up for reelection next year \u2013 said at a news conference this weekend he was in Memphis, Tennessee, on Friday. He was in touch with members of his administration \u201cevery hour,\u201d he said, prior to his return Saturday. \u201cI was gone for less than 24 hours, and then I came right back,\u201d he said. Dickens said he would address the criticism \u201chead on,\u201d telling CNN\u2019s Kate Bolduan he had committed to updates every two hours to keep residents informed through the weekend. \u201cI take it seriously, I take it to heart,\u201d Dickens said of the criticism. \u201cResidents wanted to see more of me Saturday morning before the 2 p.m. press conference. I understand that, and I apologize.\u201d According to a statement from a city spokesperson, when Dickens left Atlanta, officials had not yet realized the severity of the breaks. Dickens did not take questions at Monday\u2019s news conference, which officials abruptly ended after a resident who appeared upset repeatedly asked Wiggins about the status of repairs and when the water would be turned back on. This is a developing story and will be updated.

These days, it\u2019s trying a different approach. The cereal brand has partnered with Molly Baz, a cookbook author who was recently the star of a buzzy ad for lactation cookies, on a limited edition cereal box. It\u2019s the first cereal box featuring a pregnant woman, according to the brand. The box, which shows Baz with an exposed pregnant belly, is available for purchase on the Kellogg website.

WK Kellogg, which owns Special K, Corn Flakes, Kashi and other cereal stalwarts, reported that net sales fell 1.9% year-over-year in the quarter ending on March 30. Baz sparked a conversation around the depiction of pregnant bodies thanks to a recent ad campaign for Swehl, a company that sells accessories for breastfeeding parents and offers a cookie recipe developed with the writer.

{"id": "2024_05_30_business_american-consumer-economic-engine", "text": "It\u2019s becoming tougher and tougher for Americans to carry on with their spending spree. Years of elevated inflation and the highest interest rates in almost a quarter century are wearing out the US consumer. Savings accumulated during the Covid-19 pandemic are drying up, borrowers continue to rack up debt and delinquencies are marching higher. Retailers say shoppers are fed up with rising prices and are changing their purchasing behavior. Americans power economic growth with their spending, and they\u2019re being buffeted from every direction. US consumers unleashed a tsunami of demand when the economy ascended from pandemic depths. That momentum persisted last year as Americans gladly opened their wallets, selling out high-profile concerts and breaking travel records, which also staved off a widely anticipated recession. Such exuberance is being kept alive by America\u2019s solid job market, with sub-4% unemployment, nearly two million job openings more than unemployed people seeking work and wages that are outpacing inflation. The job market is proving to be the US economy\u2019s saving grace, but it is unmistakable that Americans are feeling pinched. Once that shoe drops, it could cause an earthquake for the world\u2019s biggest economy. \u201cAs long as people stay employed, they\u2019ll continue to spend because it\u2019s hard to pull back dramatically without feeling like you\u2019re shortchanging yourself,\u201d Carol Schleif, chief investment officer at BMO Family Office, told CNN. \u201cBut consumers are being very selective now, and they will cut back if they have to.\u201d A slowdown according to economic data Given the barrage of economic hurdles facing consumers, economists are paying close attention for a turning point. Sales at US retailers and restaurants were unexpectedly flat in April, missing the 0.4% gain economists projected. Retail spending, which is adjusted for seasonal swings but not inflation, was also revised down for March. A second estimate of gross domestic product, released Thursday, showed that consumer spending was weaker in the first three months of the year than initially reported. Consumption, which accounts for about two-thirds of the US economy, advanced 2% in the first quarter, down from the 2.5% reflected in the first estimate. That resulted in gross domestic product overall to be revised down to a 1.3% annualized rate, compared to the 1.6% initially estimated. Economists polled by FactSet are expecting data to be released Friday to show that consumer spending slowed notably in April from March. But perhaps the most unsettling economic release that came in below economists\u2019 expectations was the employment report for April. Employers added just 175,000 jobs last month, a big miss from the 235,000 jobs economists projected in a FactSet poll. And instead of holding steady at 3.8%, as expected, the unemployment rate edged higher to 3.9%. The job market is humming along just fine for now, but for how much longer remains to be seen. It\u2019s unclear if the recent slate of disappointing figures means the economy will weaken further or rebound because one month\u2019s data \u2014 not even one quarter\u2019s \u2014 does not make a trend. Warnings from retailers Retail earnings have painted a mixed picture, but lower and middle-income customers are now pulling back. Walmart (WMT) saw customers across income brackets shop more frequently at the chain across the first three months of the year, including higher-income consumers buying groceries in a sign that consumers are squeezed. Other chains have seen similar signals. Lower-income consumers bought more private-label brands and $1 items at Dollar General during its latest quarter, that company said. Kohl\u2019s (KSS) stock plunged more than 20% Thursday after weak quarterly results, showing how middle-income customers have pulled back on non-essential clothing and discretionary merchandise at department stores. \u201cOur customers continue to be pressured by a number of economic factors, including high interest rates and inflation,\u201d Kohl\u2019s CEO Thomas Kingsbury said on a call with analysts on Thursday. \u201cOur middle income customer continues to be impacted.\u201d Target, Home Depot and Best Buy, which have been some of the strongest retailers in recent years, have taken a hit from the pullback in discretionary goods. Many retailers have slashed prices and ramped up discounts to try to boost demand.Still, there have been bright spots in the retail industry. TJX, the parent of TJ Maxx and Home Goods, has surged as consumers seek out bargains. And Abercrombie & Fitch, a 1990s mainstay, has tapped into consumer nostalgia to revitalize the brand. Economists were humbled last year when their bets that the economy would fall into a recession proved to be flat-out wrong, so the economy\u2019s resilience ought not to be underestimated. But the latest data and earnings results show that the economic landscape remains undeniably tough and it is putting Americans to the test.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/30/business/american-consumer-economic-engine/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/05/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_03_us_ricky-cobb-shooting-minneapolis-charges-dropped", "text": "The criminal charges against a Minnesota state trooper who\u00a0fatally shot a Black motorist\u00a0during a traffic stop in Minneapolis last year are being dropped, the lead prosecutor announced Sunday, sparking fierce criticism from the victim\u2019s family, who said they were outraged and want federal officials to investigate. \u201cI have made the decision that our office will no longer pursue charges against Minnesota State Trooper\u00a0Londregan\u00a0for the killing of\u00a0Mr.\u00a0Cobb,\u201d Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty said in an open letter\u00a0to the community. Trooper Ryan Londregan was charged in January\u00a0with second-degree murder and other charges in the July 2023 fatal shooting of Ricky Cobb II, a Black man who was pulled over in his vehicle on I-94 for not having his taillights on at night. Londregan, who is White, ordered Cobb to get out of his car after determining he was wanted in a neighboring county. Cobb refused and was shot during a physical altercation when Londregan and another trooper attempted to enter the vehicle and grab Cobb. Londregan was charged with second-degree murder in January, but Moriarty said Monday she did not believe prosecutors could convict him at trial. \u201cMake no mistake, Ricky Cobb was the victim in this case. Ricky Cobb should be alive today,\u201d she said in a news conference. The county attorney said their confidence in being able to get a conviction changed after new information emerged last week. Moriarty said they learned Londregan planned to argue he fired because he thought Cobb was attempting to take the trooper\u2019s gun away from him. \u201cThe video doesn\u2019t prove that, and it doesn\u2019t disprove what Londregan says,\u201d Moriarty said at the news conference. In addition, Londregan\u2019s trainer provided a declaration saying he didn\u2019t train the trooper to refrain from pulling people out of a running car, Moriarty wrote in her letter. She said Monday she feared a judge would dismiss the case before it got to trial. \u201cWe do not believe we would have even made it to the jury,\u201d Moriarty said. Moriarty said her office had produced a 60-page report on the case, but it cannot be released without a judge\u2019s approval. \u201cThis was one of the hardest decisions I\u2019ve ever made,\u201d she said. The reversal comes a month after Moriarty hired a DC-based private law firm to handle the case, saying her office was understaffed. Londregan\u2019s attorney Peter Wold praised the decision to drop charges. \u201cA\u00a0new set of lawyers from the prosecution took a look at the case and reached the appropriate conclusion.\u00a0It should have happened months ago,\u201d he told CNN on Monday. Londregan\u2019s defense was provided by the Minnesota Police and Peace Officers Association. In a statement, executive director Brian Peters said, \u201cTrooper Londregan should have never been charged, and we are glad this political case is over. Enough is enough.\u201d Family to ask Justice Department to investigate Minnesota State Patrol In a Tuesday news conference, family attorney Bakari Sellers apologized to Cobb\u2019s family, saying he led them to have faith in how local prosecutors would handle the case, but said \u201cthat faith was misplaced and we stand here today frustrated, we stand here today \u2026 outraged.\u201d Sellers said Cobb\u2019s family was notified by the county attorney\u2019s office Sunday afternoon, and were told to \u201churry down\u201d to a meeting that day, where prosecutors shared their decision. Sellers said they are now working on drafting a letter asking federal officials \u2013 including the US Department of Justice Civil Rights Division \u2013 to investigate the shooting and the Minnesota State Patrol. \u201cI believe that every citizen of Minnesota should be concerned now knowing that these officers go out on the streets, put themselves in danger, and do so untrained,\u201d the attorney said, standing alongside Cobb\u2019s family members. \u201cAll of us standing up here today, we want more African Americans to be a part of law enforcement, we want our law enforcement to be trained, we want law enforcement to be prayed for, and most importantly, we want them to be able to go out and do their job and come home safely every night,\u201d Sellers said. \u201cBut what we also want is for individuals like Ricky Cobb II, whose only crime was apparently not having his tail light on at night, to be able to come home as well.\u201d Cobb\u2019s mother, who also spoke during Tuesday\u2019s news conference, described him as an \u201cexcellent son,\u201d a father who had aspirations, and she pleaded: \u201cMake it make sense.\u201d In an earlier statement this week, family attorneys said they were disappointed in the county attorney\u2019s decision but not surprised because \u201clike many, we have come to expect the absence of justice and accountability when Black lives are lost in this country.\u201d \u201cApparently, all you have to do to get away with murder is to bully the prosecutors enough and the charges will just go away. The people don\u2019t believe the excuses and neither do we,\u201d attorneys Sellers, Harry Daniels and F. Clayton Tyler previously said in a Monday statement. Cobb\u2019s\u00a0family filed a federal lawsuit in April against Londregan and the other trooper involved in the incident.

The site listed New York City, Chicago, Philadelphia, Dallas, Pittsburgh and Indianapolis as among the cities with the most reports of issues. Because of the interoperability problem, thousands of Verizon customers also reported a service outage on Down Detector Tuesday. AT&T told CNN that 911 calls went through, despite a few locations, including Camden County, Georgia, and Scranton, Pennsylvania, issuing alerts on social media that the outage was disrupting calls to 911. AT&T told CNN the alerts were received accidentally after a template for such a notification was triggered and sent. AT&T said it is investigating why that happened. The outage comes less than four months after a massive disruption that knocked out service for AT&T\u2019s network for nearly 12 hours. In February, tens of thousands of AT&T customers in America were unable to make phone calls, send texts, reach emergency services or access the internet because of an AT&T network outage. In March, the telecommunications company said it had been hacked in a separate incident, and the stolen data contained information such as account holders\u2019 Social Security numbers. This story has been updated with additional developments and context.

{"id": "2024_06_02_us_akron-ohio-mass-shooting", "text": "Police searching for a suspect in a mass shooting at a birthday party in Akron, Ohio, that left a 27-year-old-man dead and 24 others injured said they\u2019re worried about the possibility of retaliatory violence. Officers responded to 911 calls shortly after midnight Sunday, reporting shots fired and multiple victims struck in a residential area, according to a statement from the city\u2019s mayor and police chief. The shooting took place during a \u201clarge birthday party\u201d that earlier in the night had more than 200 people in attendance, Akron Police Chief Brian Harding said in a Sunday evening news conference. \u201cAll incidents of gun violence are tragedies, but here the sheer number of victims is shocking and deeply concerning,\u201d Akron Mayor Shammas Malik said at the news conference. The shooting marks the latest instance of a celebration in the US ending in gunfire. This year alone, bullets have put a grim end to sports rallies, family gatherings, religious celebrations, parties and a high school senior skip day. And it\u2019s one of more than 192 mass shootings in the US so far this year, according to the Gun Violence Archive. One of those incidents, with four or more people injured not including the shooter, took place just hours after the gunfire in Ohio, when a Pennsylvania bar fight ended with two people dead and seven injured, police in Allegheny County said. In the Akron shooting\u2019s aftermath, authorities found the scene \u201clittered\u201d with spent shell casings that stretched down a whole block, the police chief said. \u201cBased on the layout of the spent shell (casings) it appears consistent with someone driving by shooting out of car,\u201d Harding said. \u201cWe believe that some individuals at the party may have returned fire based on physical evidence at the scene.\u201d At least two handguns were recovered from the scene, but authorities found different shell casings from multiple kinds of firearms, Harding said. Authorities do not know if the shooter or the vehicle were hit by gunfire, and could not yet provide a suspect or vehicle description, the chief said. Investigators are also worried about the possibility of retaliation and are working to try and prevent further violence, Harding said. Officials from several agencies are offering a total reward of $22,500 for information that leads to the identification and arrest of a suspect, Malik said in a post Sunday. People can share information anonymously, officials said. \u201cWe are imploring the community to come forward,\u201d Harding said. \u201cWe believe there are people in the community this evening who saw something or know something and we\u2019re asking them to come forward,\u201d he said. \u201cWe believe there were dozens of people at the party at the time of the shooting, and potentially over 100 people who may have witnessed the incident.\u201d \u201cEven a small detail can help us crack this case and locate the suspect or suspects involved,\u201d the police chief added. \u2018This country has a gun violence epidemic,\u2019 mayor says In total, there were 25 gunshot victims, including the person who was killed, police confirmed. At least two people were in critical condition Sunday evening, Harding said. Some of the victims were treated at a hospital and released. Authorities have not released any identifying information about the man who was killed, nor about the wounded victims, but Harding said they ranged from 19 to 43 years old, with most being in their 30s. \u201cWe know that this country has a gun violence epidemic, and that this is the latest in a long line of incidents we\u2019ve seen across the nation,\u201d Malik said. \u201cThe city of Akron and our Akron Police Department remain committed to fighting all violence, especially gun violence.\u201d \u201cI want to be very clear, anyone who was involved in last night\u2019s shooting will be held accountable to the fullest extent of the law,\u201d he said, and also warned that anyone who perpetrates retaliatory violence will be held accountable. This is a developing story and will be updated.

{"id": "2024_06_04_us_ohtani-interpreter-guilty", "text": "Japanese baseball star Shohei Ohtani said he has \u201cclosure\u201d and is ready to \u201cmove on\u201d after his longtime interpreter Ippei Mizuhara pleaded guilty in court Tuesday to fraud and tax charges for stealing almost $17 million from the Los Angeles Dodgers slugger to pay off gambling debts. \u201cNow that the investigation has been completed, this full admission of guilt has brought important closure to me and my family. I want to sincerely thank the authorities for finishing their thorough and effective investigation so quickly and uncovering\u00a0all of\u00a0the evidence,\u201d Ohtani said in a statement. \u201cThis has been a uniquely challenging time, so I am especially grateful for my support team - my family, agent, agency, lawyers, and advisors along with the entire Dodger organization, who showed endless support throughout this process. It\u2019s time to close this chapter, move on and continue to focus on playing and winning ballgames.\u201d Mizuhara, 39,\u00a0reached a plea agreement last month in which he agreed to plead guilty to one count of bank fraud and one count of filing a false income tax return, according to the Justice Department. In court on Tuesday, he formally pleaded guilty and indicated that he understood all the charges and the consequences. When asked by Judge John W. Holcomb to describe in his own words what he did, Mizuhara said the \u201conly way\u201d he could think of to get out of his gambling debts was to use money from Ohtani\u2019s account to pay what he owed. He faces up to 30 years in prison for bank fraud and up to three years for filing a false tax return. His sentencing is scheduled for October 25. Ohtani\u2019s statement and Mizuhara\u2019s guilty plea represent the end of a saga that first became public in March on the eve of the MLB season. The scandal upended what had been perceived as a close friendship between the Japanese star and his interpreter and brought renewed scrutiny to the normalization and legalization of sports gambling in recent years. The court hearing also came the same day that MLB banned San Diego Padres player Tucupita Marcano for life after he bet on games and suspended four other players for a year for betting on games while in the minor leagues. Speaking after the hearing, US Attorney Martin Estrada said the evidence showed Ohtani was victimized by Mizuhara. He connected the case to other frauds committed against older adults and immigrant groups. \u201cMr. Ohtani is an immigrant, came to this country, is not familiar with the ways of this country, and therefore was easily prey to someone who is more familiar with our financial systems and was able to take advantage of Mr. Ohtani,\u201d Estrada said. Prosecutors have not decided what they will seek at sentencing but will follow the sentencing guidelines, which may call for a sentence lower than the maximum, Estrada said. \u201cThat being said, based on the extent of the conduct here, the sentence will likely be one that calls for incarceration,\u201d he added. Interpreter stole to cover gambling debts Mizuhara began placing sports bets with an illegal bookmaker in September 2021 and then pilfered from Ohtani to cover the debts, authorities said. \u201cFrom no later than November 2021 to March 2024, Mizuhara used Ohtani\u2019s password to successfully sign into the bank account and then changed the account\u2019s security protocols without Ohtani\u2019s knowledge or permission,\u201d the Justice Department said. \u201cIn total, Mizuhara called the bank and impersonated Ohtani on approximately 24 occasions.\u201d According to a court document, Mizuhara \u201cfraudulently transferred and willfully caused to be transferred approximately $16.5 million.\u201d Prosecutors alleged Mizuhara used the money to pay off illegal gambling debts and expenses, including $60,000 on personal dental work and $325,000 on baseball cards. From December 2021 to January 2024, Mizuhara made a remarkable 19,000 wagers, with net losses of $40.7 million, the criminal complaint states. Ohtani, who has denied any wrongdoing, is considered a victim in the case, prosecutors said. \u201cThe extent of this defendant\u2019s deception and theft is massive,\u201d Estrada said last month. \u201cHe took advantage of his position of trust to take advantage of Mr. Ohtani and fuel a dangerous gambling habit.\u201d The Justice Department said Mizuhara has admitted he owes more than $1.1 million in taxes for 2022 and the IRS Criminal Investigation and Homeland Security Investigations are looking into the case. Mizuhara, who is out of custody on $25,000 bond, could be deported as he is not a US citizen, the plea agreement and the US attorney\u2019s office said. Mizuhara is\u00a0a legal permanent resident\u00a0who has a green card, the US Attorney\u2019s Office for the Central District of California told CNN. Mizuhara and\u00a0Ohtani, who does not speak English,\u00a0first worked together from 2013 to 2017 at Japan\u2019s Nippon Professional Baseball League\u00a0team Nippon-Ham Fighters, where Mizuhara worked as an interpreter for non-Japanese speaking players, according to MLB.com. Mizuhara then became\u00a0Ohtani\u2019s interpreter in his rookie season with the Los Angeles Angels in 2018. Ohtani starred for six seasons with the Angels as both a slugger and a pitcher, twice winning the American League\u2019s Most Valuable Player Award. This past offseason, he signed a\u00a0historic $700 million, 10-year contract\u00a0with the Dodgers. The allegations against Mizuhara came to light\u00a0in March when, after reporting from ESPN\u00a0and the\u00a0Los Angeles Times, Ohtani\u2019s lawyers accused Mizuhara of \u201cmassive theft\u201d of millions of dollars and placing bets with a bookie under federal investigation. In April, Ohtani said he was \u201cvery grateful for the Department of Justice\u2019s investigation,\u201d according to a statement given to CNN by his representatives. \u201cFor me personally, this marks a break from this, and I\u2019d like to focus on baseball.\u201d Despite the scandal, Ohtani has excelled in his first year with the Dodgers and remains one of the best sluggers in baseball.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/04/us/ohtani-interpreter-guilty/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/05/2024", "section": "us"}}

In the letter sent Monday and made public Tuesday, Trump\u2019s attorneys said the justification for the gag order was \u201cto protect the integrity of this criminal proceeding and avoid prejudice to the jury.\u201d The argument to lift the gag order is \u201ceven stronger\u201d since President Joe Biden has publicly commented on the guilty verdict against Trump, certain witnesses have commented and a presidential debate is scheduled for later this month, the letter states. When asked about the status of the gag order, a court spokesman said, \u201cthe order is part of the court record that has been made publicly available and it speaks for itself.\u201d In March, just before the trial started\u00a0Merchan\u00a0granted prosecutors\u2019 request for a gag order that precluded Trump from making public statements about any witnesses in the case, jurors, prosecutors, court staff, or members of their family.

{"id": "2024_06_03_us_idaho-death-penalty-chad-daybell", "text": "Chad Daybell was sentenced to death for the murders of his wife and two of his second wife\u2019s children this weekend, but when and whether he will be executed remain wide-open questions. It\u2019s typical for the appeals process in capital cases to go on for years, and they often reach the US Supreme Court before an inmate is ultimately put to death. In Idaho, the imposition of a death sentence is followed by a mandatory post-conviction review, and defendants are able to pursue an appeal after the filing of a death warrant. In the meantime, the high-profile nature of Daybell\u2019s case \u2013 and the looming capital trial of Bryan Kohberger, who\u2019s pleaded not guilty in the killings of four University of Idaho college students \u2013 will bring renewed attention to Idaho\u2019s death penalty, which is seldom used and attracted headlines earlier this year when officials halted their first execution attempt in more than a decade. Here\u2019s what to know about the death penalty in Idaho. Executions are uncommon Executions are relatively rare in Idaho, which, according to the Death Penalty Information Center, has carried out just three executions since 1976, when the US Supreme Court reinstated capital punishment. The first was in 1994, followed by two others in 2011 and 2012. To put this in context, Texas\u00a0has put to death 580 inmates within the timeframe, DPIC\u2019s data show \u2013 by far the most of any state. And Oklahoma, which has carried out the highest number of executions per capita, has executed 124. Only a handful of the 27 states where the death penalty remains legal have carried out as few executions as Idaho: Kentucky, Montana and Pennsylvania have also each put to death three people since 1976. Kansas, Wyoming and Oregon have executed even fewer, with zero, one and two executions, respectively. Additionally, Idaho\u2019s death row housed just eight inmates prior to Daybell\u2019s sentence, according to the Idaho Department of Corrections. California \u2013 which, it should be noted, has a population more than 21 times the size of Idaho \u2013 has 638 condemned inmates, nearly 80 times the size of Idaho\u2019s death row. Officials recently halted an execution Idaho officials attempted to carry out the state\u2019s first execution in 12 years several months ago. But they were forced to abort midway through the procedure, citing difficulties setting an intravenous line to deliver the fatal drugs for lethal injection. That echoed difficulties seen in executions in other states, including Alabama. Officials there similarly had to call off two executions in 2022 after authorities were unable to access the inmates\u2019 veins before their death warrants expired. The execution of Thomas Creech, scheduled in Idaho for February 28, was \u201cunable to proceed\u201d after eight failed attempts to establish IV access, state Department of Correction Director Josh Tewalt said at the time. The execution team encountered two different issues, Tewalt said at a news conference: In some instances it was \u201can access issue,\u201d and in others a \u201cvein quality issue.\u201d Tewalt praised the medical team\u2019s willingness to halt the execution, telling reporters the state\u2019s \u201cfirst objective is to carry this out with dignity, professionalism and respect,\u201d and he disputed the suggestion the execution was a \u201cfailure.\u201d The department said in a statement Creech\u2019s warrant would expire while the state considered next steps. 2 execution methods, both with challenges The decision to call off Creech\u2019s execution also raised questions about when\u00a0and how the state would endeavor to put an inmate to death in the future. Tewalt told reporters a second attempt using lethal injection \u2013 Idaho\u2019s main method of execution \u2013 would require the state to seek out new chemicals. While he expressed \u201ca high level of confidence\u201d the state could secure the drugs, a number of states have struggled in recent years to obtain them after pharmaceutical companies began prohibiting the use of their products for that purpose. Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine, for example, has repeatedly postponed executions citing companies\u2019 unwillingness to sell the drugs necessary. Idaho recently legalized a second method of execution, with an aim toward sidestepping this kind of supply problem. Last year, Gov. Brad Little signed a new law allowing the department of corrections to use the firing squad if the drugs are not available. But as of late February, the state lacked the facilities it needed to carry out an execution by firing squad, Tewalt said. In a message to corrections staff, the director said his department had been working to retrofit its execution chamber to accommodate the alternative method. \u201cThose initial efforts were unsuccessful because contractors who would engage in this type of work have expressed their unwillingness to work on a project related to executions,\u201d Tewalt said, \u201cbut efforts are ongoing.\u201d The director added construction on the execution chamber would prevent the state from being able to use it \u2013 even for lethal injection \u2013 until the work is completed.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/03/us/idaho-death-penalty-chad-daybell/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/05/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_04_us_harvard-diversity-statements-reaj", "text": "Harvard University\u2019s Faculty of Arts and Sciences will no longer require a diversity and inclusion statement as part of its hiring process, according to an email from a senior school leader obtained by The Harvard Crimson and The New York Times. The change outlined in the Monday email comes amid intense scrutiny of diversity, equity and inclusion \u2013 or DEI \u2013 efforts at Harvard and other major universities around the nation. Instead of the previously required statement outlining contributions to the areas of diversity, inclusion and belonging, the email says job applicants will be asked to outline their plans to \u201cstrengthen academic communities,\u201d The Crimson and The Times reported. Applicants will also be asked to outline how they will foster a \u201clearning environment in which students are encouraged to ask questions and share their ideas,\u201d according to the email from Nina Zipser, the dean of faculty affairs and planning, the newspapers reported. CNN has not viewed a copy of Zipser\u2019s email. The Faculty of Arts and Sciences is now \u201crequesting broader and more robust service statements as part of the hiring process,\u201d Jonathan Palumbo, a communications director with the university told CNN in a statement Tuesday. \u201cThis updated approach acknowledges the many ways faculty contribute to strengthening their academic communities, including efforts to increase diversity, inclusion, and belonging,\u201d the statement said. The division is \u201crealigning\u201d its hiring practice with long-held criteria for faculty, including \u201cexcellence in research, teaching/advising, and service,\u201d it added. Zipser said in Monday\u2019s email the decision considered the feedback of faculty members who felt the diversity statements were too narrow, the newspapers reported. In an April op-ed published in the Crimson, Randall L. Kennedy, a professor at Harvard Law School, criticized mandatory DEI statements calling them \u201ccounterproductive to efforts to undo the effects of long overlooked invidious social discriminations in academia.\u201d \u201cBy requiring academics to profess \u2014 and flaunt \u2014 faith in DEI, the proliferation of diversity statements poses a profound challenge to academic freedom,\u201d Kennedy wrote. Khalil Gibran Muhammad, Ford Foundation professor of history, race and public policy at Harvard Kennedy School, told CNN he was blindsided by the school\u2019s decision to remove DEI statements, which were put in place four years ago. Muhammad said professors who teach race and racism at Harvard have faced attacks from conservative critics in recent months and the university has yet to defend them. \u201cHarvard is making a decision that will signal to future faculty and staff that it is not a place that is committed to racial equity,\u201d Muhammad said. \u201cAnd that it is more concerned about the comforts of conservatives and more concerned about accommodating people who are associated with the Republican party.\u201d The Faculty of Arts and Sciences is Harvard\u2019s largest division. The university touts it as the \u201chistoric heart of Harvard University,\u201d home to its undergraduate and PhD programs, encompassing 40 academic departments and more than 10,000 students. The removal of the diversity statements comes during a tumultuous time at Harvard. In recent months, there have been protests on campus sparked by the Israel-Hamas war. During the school\u2019s commencement ceremony last month, more than 1,000 people walked out\u00a0in protest of the university\u2019s decision to bar 13 senior undergraduates from participating over their pro-Palestinian activities, CNN previously reported. Former Harvard President Claudine Gay\u00a0resigned earlier this year, following plagiarism accusations and controversial remarks at a congressional hearing about antisemitism on US college campuses. The university called Gay\u2019s instances of inadequate citation \u201cregrettable\u201d but found they\u00a0did\u00a0not meet the punishable threshold of research misconduct. Gay was the Ivy League university\u2019s first Black president. Her departure prompted some critics to speak out about what they perceived to be the broader failing of DEI efforts. Among them was billionaire investor Bill Ackman who, in a post on X, said Harvard\u2019s presidential hiring committee \u201cwould not consider a candidate who did not meet the DEI office\u2019s criteria.\u201d \u201cShrinking the pool of candidates based on required race, gender, and/or sexual orientation criteria is not the right approach to identifying the best leaders for our most prestigious universities,\u201d Ackman said. \u201cAnd it is also not good for those awarded the office of president who find themselves in a role that they would likely not have obtained were it not for a fat finger on the scale.\u201d Supporters of Gay came to her defense including\u00a0Nikole Hannah-Jones, the\u00a0creator of the 1619 project;\u00a0Janai Nelson\u00a0president of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, and\u00a0Morehouse College President David Thomas. \u201cTo turn the question to the legitimacy of President Gay\u2019s selection because she is a Black woman is a dog whistle we have heard before: Black and female equal not qualified. We must call it out,\u201d\u00a0Thomas wrote on LinkedIn. Hannah-Jones told CNN\u2019s Abby Phillip in December that she felt the backlash against Gay was \u201cracist.\u201d \u201cNo one has produced a shred of evidence that the sole qualification that president Gay had was that she is a Black woman,\u201d Hannah-Jones said. \u201cThat\u2019s insulting, it defies logic.\u201d In recent months, two Virginia colleges, Virginia Commonwealth University and George Mason University, were thrust into the spotlight after backtracking on plans to require diversity courses for incoming students. The decisions to drop the course requirements\u00a0at VCU and postpone them at George Mason faced backlash from faculty and students last month who said the material was meant to prepare students for the real world by offering a better understanding of the nation\u2019s history of racism and discrimination. In a statement, Virginia Commonwealth University noted that while not required, racial literacy classes are still available to students. In response to questions over the school\u2019s decision to postpone a \u201cJust Societies\u201d diversity-themed course requirement for incoming students, George Mason\u2019s interim Executive Vice President and Provost Kenneth D.\u00a0Walsh said in a letter addressed to his colleagues, \u201cThis is clearly an issue that engenders strong feelings on every side.\u201d \u201cIronically, finding a civil and respectful path forward on this kind of issue is precisely the type of activity the \u2018Just Societies\u2019 courses are meant to support students accomplishing.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/04/us/harvard-diversity-statements-reaj/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/05/2024", "section": "us"}}
