{"id": "2024_06_15_us_rochester-hills-michigan-splash-pad-shooting", "text": "A suspect in the shooting that injured at least nine people at a recreation area in Rochester Hills, Michigan, Saturday was found dead at a nearby home, Oakland County Sheriff Michael Bouchard said. The suspect, a 42-year-old man whose name has not yet been released, was found at a nearby home after police tracked the weapon from the shooting scene to the address about a half mile from the crime scene, the sheriff said at a news conference Saturday night. \u201cIn my worst nightmare, I couldn\u2019t imagine standing up here again talking about another active shooter,\u201d Bouchard said at a news conference Saturday evening. It appears the suspect had pulled up to the recreation area at Brooklands Plaza Splash Pad in Rochester Hills, exited a vehicle and opened fire roughly 20 feet away, reloading multiple times, Bouchard said. The suspect fired \u201cpotentially 28 times,\u201d the sheriff said. The incident appears to be random and authorities have yet to determine a motivation for the attack, he added. At least two of the victims are children, authorities said. One of the victims, an 8-year-old boy, sustained a gunshot wound to the head and is in critical condition, Bouchard said. A 4-year-old had a wound to the thigh and is in stable condition, he said. Their 39-year-old mother with wounds to the abdomen and leg was also in critical condition. Six other gunshot victims, including three women and three men from 30 to 78 years old, were in stable condition. Rochester Hills is about 27 miles north of Detroit. Authorities initially provided conflicting numbers on how many people were shot as hospitals began reporting gunshot victims showing up for treatment. The sheriff later confirmed at least nine were shot, including the mother and her two sons and a husband and wife. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer announced in a statement on X she is in contact with local officials following the shooting.  \u201cI am heartbroken to learn about the shooting in Rochester Hills,\u201d she wrote. \u201cWe are monitoring the situation as updates continue to come in, and are in touch with local officials.\u201d \u201cThis is a great community and it\u2019s heartbreaking to see this happen here,\u201d said Rochester Hills Mayor Bryan Barnett. Weapon on scene leads authorities to nearby home The first 911 call alerting police to the incident was made around 5:11 p.m. Bouchard said a Rochester Hills sergeant was listening to a new technology that securely livestreams 911 calls directly to first responders and responded to the scene within two minutes, before the call was dispatched. The suspect had already left the scene and authorities located a handgun and three empty magazines at the scene. \u201cThe one weapon on scene led us to the address that was registered to that address, which is why we got so quickly to the home,\u201d Bouchard said Saturday night. After making attempts to contact the suspect, law enforcement \u201cbreached the home and deployed drones to begin an examination of the home,\u201d and were able to locate the deceased suspect, the sheriff said. \u201cWe brought in assets including our SWAT, our helicopter, our drones and tried to make contact with the person, tried to bring that person out peacefully and to no avail, had no contact back,\u201d Bouchard said at a news conference Saturday evening. A drone that flew into the home while police surrounded it also found what appeared to be an \u201cAR-platform\u201d firearm on the kitchen table, Bouchard said Saturday night. As deputies surrounded the house, the sheriff advised those sheltering in the parks to go home and asked people to stay away from the area if they are sheltering at a nearby location. The suspect was not known to authorities until they did a \u201cquick investigation\u201d and determined who they believed was involved based on evidence from the crime scene. \u201cA vehicle that matched what had been described as a vehicle leaving the scene was there,\u201d the sheriff said. \u201cWe put up a quick perimeter and deputies on scene apparently heard or saw the individual they are trying to communicate with.\u201d Investigators believe there are potentially more weapons in the home but it is unclear if the suspect has access to them, according to Bouchard. The sheriff called the incident a \u201cgut punch,\u201d and stressed the community is still reeling from the 2021 shooting at a high school in Oxford, located 15 miles north of Rochester Hills, when four students were killed. \u201cWe\u2019re not even fully comprehending what happened at Oxford, and now we have another complete tragedy that we\u2019re dealing with,\u201d he said.

{"id": "2024_06_16_media_washington-post-will-lewis-phone-hacking", "text": "A report from the New York Times on Saturday alleges\u00a0Will Lewis, the Washington Post\u2019s embattled new publisher and chief executive,\u00a0used fraudulent and unethical methods\u00a0to obtain information for articles while working at the London-based Sunday Times\u00a0in the early 2000s. Citing a former co-worker of Lewis\u2019, a private investigator and its own investigation of newspaper archives, the New York Times said Lewis used phone and company records that were\u00a0\u201cfraudulently obtained\u201d\u00a0through hacking and paying sources for information. Through the haze of accusations, it remains unclear whether these claims will prompt Lewis to step down from the helm of one of the most distinguished outlets in the country. Even so, experts see Lewis\u2019 grasp on the newsroom as one that is increasingly weakening. Margaret Sullivan, executive director of the Craig\u00a0Newmark Center for Journalism Ethics and Security at Columbia University\u2019s School of Journalism, told CNN on Sunday that Lewis\u2019 position is \u201cincreasingly untenable.\u201d These latest allegations of\u00a0questionable\u00a0journalistic ethics could also leave an enduring impression on a newsroom already reeling from the blindsiding ouster of its executive editor,\u00a0Sally Buzbee. The allegations may also end up reflecting on the paper\u2019s own reputation as a standard-bearer for American journalism. The Society of Professional Journalists, which represents about 7,000 members across the country and whose journalism standards\u00a0are recognized in\u00a0many newsrooms, warns journalists in its\u00a0Code of Ethics: \u201cDo not pay for access to news.\u201d While SPJ does not explicitly address hacking as a means of newsgathering, it does tell journalists to \u201cavoid undercover or other surreptitious methods of gathering information unless traditional, open methods will not yield information vital to the public\u201d but cautions that \u201cpursuit of the news is not a license for arrogance of\u00a0undue intrusiveness.\u201d The new accusations come as Lewis tries to fend off resurfacing allegations of his involvement in a UK phone hacking scandal coverup, in which he has repeatedly denied wrongdoing.\u00a0Lewis has\u00a0previously said\u00a0his role in the scandal consisted of rooting out problematic behavior. A spokesperson for the Washington Post told CNN Lewis declined to comment. A Washington Post source with knowledge of internal meetings at the paper last week told CNN that Lewis has told employees \u201chis role as publisher is to create the environment for great journalism and to encourage and support it, that he will never interfere in the journalism and that he is very clear about the lines that should not be crossed.\u201d The\u00a0decade-old scandal\u00a0engulfed right-wing media mogul Rupert Murdoch\u2019s News of the World tabloid and was revived in recent years in a\u00a0new lawsuit filed\u00a0by Prince Harry and Hollywood figures including Guy Ritchie and Hugh Grant. At the time of the News of the World controversy, Lewis was a senior executive at Murdoch\u2019s News Corporation. But a cascade of claims has followed Lewis in recent weeks, mostly involving\u00a0alleged attempts to suppress stories about his connection with the coverup. Earlier this month, the New York Times first reported that Lewis, who took the reins at the Washington Post on January 2, clashed with\u00a0Buzbee\u00a0over publishing an article in May that named him in connection to the scandal,\u00a0although a\u00a0spokesperson for Lewis has denied he pressured Buzbee\u00a0to quash the article, according to NPR.  Buzbee abruptly left the company earlier this month. Days later, an NPR reporter said Lewis offered him an interview in exchange for quashing a forthcoming article about the scandal. The Washington Post did not respond to CNN with regard to these allegations. A spokesperson for Lewis\u00a0told the New York Times earlier this month\u00a0when the story broke that \u201cwhen he was a private citizen ahead of joining The Washington Post, he had off the record conversations with an employee of NPR about a story the employee then published.\u201d The spokesperson added that any request for an interview after he joined the Washington Post was \u201cprocessed through the normal corporate communication channels.\u201d Buzbee\u2019s departure has seemingly frayed Lewis\u2019 command of his newsroom even further. A number of Post staffers who spoke to CNN have described plummeting morale. \u201cIt\u2019s as bad as I\u2019ve ever seen it, truly,\u201d one staffer said earlier this month, noting that the Washington Post has hit \u201crough patches\u201d before but that the stormy atmosphere hanging over the outlet is unprecedented. In an opinion piece for the Guardian on Wednesday, Sullivan wrote that firing Lewis and finding a new CEO is \u201cthe cleanest, best move\u201d Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos could make. Lewis\u2019 insistence on tamping down reporting about him \u201chas motivated several news organizations to look more deeply into his past; it\u2019s possible that some new revelation will make his Post leadership position even more untenable and will force Bezos\u2019 hand,\u201d she added. Sullivan also wrote in her op-ed that Lewis could try to repair the trust both within and outside the newsroom by acknowledging that he will not cross any ethical lines and reiterating his commitment to giving staffers \u201ctrue editorial independence.\u201d He could also work toward reinstating an independent public editor or ombudsman \u2014 a position the Washington Post nixed more than a decade ago \u2014 who would oversee the paper\u2019s implementation of journalistic ethics.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/16/media/washington-post-will-lewis-phone-hacking/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/17/2024", "section": "us"}}

{"id": "2024_06_16_food_fudgie-the-whale-carvel-history", "text": "Whiskey, steaks and ties are all typical gifts for Father\u2019s Day, but one specifically made for the holiday takes the cake: Fudgie the Whale. Carvel\u2019s vanilla and chocolate-flavored ice cream cake has been a holiday staple since 1977, when it it was first created as a Father\u2019s Day promotion, and nearly five decades later, it has earned its place in the pantheon of recognizable fast food characters. Fudgie the Whale wasn\u2019t initially produced to be a mascot for the 90-year-old brand. It was made to fill the freezer cases that founder Tom Carvel had made for his shops. Ice cream cakes quickly flew off the shelves, first created in the mid-1950s, and twenty years later he thought of making a cake for Father\u2019s Day. Fudgie was a play on the phrase (more commonly said back then): a \u201cwhale of a dad,\u201d according to Carvel\u2019s Chief Brand Officer Jim Salerno, which prompted Carvel to mass produce Fudgie using a plastic, whale-shaped mold that he invented. He decided to top it with fudge, because it was one of Carvel\u2019s most popular toppings. To make the cake, soft-serve vanilla is placed into the mold first, followed by chocolate chip cookie pieces better known as \u201ccrunchies.\u201d Then it\u2019s topped with soft-serve chocolate ice cream and frozen for several hours. After that, it\u2019s topped with hot fudge with more crunchies on the side. The cakes sell for about $30. Fudgie helped Father\u2019s Day become Carvel\u2019s busiest day of the year for buying cakes, Salerno said. \u201cThe simple reason is when you ask dad what they want to do on Father\u2019s Day is that they want to stay home, like watch TV or have a barbecue. It\u2019s a big holiday to bring cake home,\u201d Salerno told CNN. Fudgie\u2019s popularity extends beyond Father\u2019s Day, Salerno said, popular for other occasions like birthdays and anniversaries, too. Carvel sells nearly 100,000 Fudgies a year. Fudgie is also part of fading piece of fast food culture, as mascots have largely become a thing of the past. They have been \u201csuccessful in reaching kids and families with a memorable character that could then recreate some nostalgia and a fondness for the food and the memories of that chain,\u201d said David Henkes, a senior principal at Technomic, a food industry research and consulting firm. Carvel could use a boost. Its footprint has deceased in recent years and sales lag behind its competitors like Dairy Queen and Baskin Robbins, according to the firm\u2019s data. Carvel is owned by privately held Go To Foods (f.k.a. Focus Brands) that also has Auntie Anne\u2019s, Jamba and Cinnabon in its portfolio. \u201cFor Carvel, Fudgie the Whale cakes evoke those same memories and nostalgia for consumers those that are from the East Coast, and for a relatively small regional chain Fudgie has worked its way into pop culture and probably helps keep Carvel more top of mind for consumers,\u201d he told CNN. Sibling rivalry Although Fudgie is Carvel\u2019s most famous treat, it has a little known sibling rivalry with Cookie Puss \u2014 a goofy looking alien with a sugar cone as a nose. That was actually Carvel\u2019s first shaped cake, created about five years before Fudgie, to complement the chain\u2019s ice cream sandwiches, known as Flying Saucers. \u201cIt\u2019s supposed to be an extra-terrestrial, but some people say that they kind of fashioned it to look like Tom because it has a nice big nose, big eyes and big ears,\u201d Salerno teased. \u201cBut when Fudgie came along, Fudgie surpassed Cookie Puss very quickly.\u201d Cookie Puss remains on sale, as well as other shaped cakes like ice cream cones, bunny rabbits for Easter and various sports-themed cakes, like basketball and baseball. Fudgie\u2019s mold has dual purpose to, Salerno said noting that the late Tom Carvel (he died in 1990) \u201cwas very frugal\u201d and turned it sideways to make a Santa Claus cake, which has been on sale for about four decades. The Fudgie family expanded this year with the introduction of Fudgie Pops, which are mini Fudgie cake pops on a stick. Later this year, Carvel is introducing another new character cake, but Salerno is keeping mum on the shape. Fudgie fandom Carvel has about 340 locations, with more than half of them in New York, but Fudgie\u2019s fandom extends beyond the state. It\u2019s been lovingly joked about on several TV shows including Family Guy, The Office and even The Simpsons. Last October, Kelly Ripa, a big Carvel fan, received a Fudgie cake on her nationally syndicated talk show \u201cLive with Kelly and Mark\u201d for her 53rd birthday. Fudgie is hard to escape: Fudgie mascot has made appearances at New York Mets\u2019 and Yankees games, he\u2019s appeared in TV commercials and was even made into Fudgie the Beer in 2018 as part of a limited-time promotion. For Carvel, which is celebrating its 90th year this year with a new logo and refreshed store designs to focus on its soft serve ice cream roots (Carvel claims that its founder has invented that, but others might disagree), Fudgie sparks nostalgia for consumers. \u201cWe as a brand made sure to keep him front and center,\u201d Salerno said. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing how well-known and how well loved he is.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/16/food/fudgie-the-whale-carvel-history/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/17/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_16_politics_chris-murphy-supreme-court-bump-stocks", "text": "Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy said Sunday the Supreme Court is \u201creadying\u00a0to fundamentally rewrite the Second Amendment\u201d after striking down a federal ban on bump stocks. Recent gun-related rulings from the high court, Murphy told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper on \u201cState of the Union,\u201d signal it is prepared to \u201ctake away permanently the ability of Congress to do simple things like require people to go through a background check or move forward on taking dangerous weapons like AR-15s off of the streets.\u201d \u201cSo I think this court is poised to make it very hard for Congress or state legislatures to be able to regulate guns and keep our communities and schools safe,\u201d he said. The Supreme Court\u2019s striking down of the federal ban on bump stocks marked the latest opinion from the conservative bench rolling back firearm regulations. Former President Donald Trump had pushed for the ban in response to a\u00a02017 mass shooting that killed 58 people at an outdoor music festival in Las Vegas. But it was successfully challenged by a Texas gun store owner who purchased two of the devices in 2018 and turned them over to the government after the prohibition before suing to get them back. Bump stocks allow a shooter to convert a semi automatic rifle into a weapon that can fire hundreds of rounds a minute. \u201cThis is a Republican administration that banned bump stocks. At the time, Republicans in the Senate and the House were supportive of it,\u201d the Connecticut Democrat said Sunday. \u201cBut now that they have got a Supreme Court that seems ready to unwind the entirety of the Second Amendment and take away from Congress or the executive branch the ability to keep our communities safe, they\u2019re once again lining up behind the gun industry.\u201d Murphy\u2019s comments echo the response of gun control advocacy groups, which argued Friday that the court\u2019s ruling will have a dangerous impact in a country constantly reeling from gun violence. The overwhelming majority of Republicans, however, celebrated the court\u2019s decision, arguing that they long believed the ban on bump stocks was unconstitutional. While the action was taken under the Trump administration, many Republicans argued it was the wrong move at the time. GOP Sen. Tom Cotton told Tapper in a separate interview Sunday that the bump stock ban \u201ctreads close\u201d to an infringement of the Second Amendment. \u201cI would suggest before we infringe on the rights of law-abiding American citizens, we should crack down on violent crime and gang crimes,\u201d\u00a0he said. Though the case didn\u2019t rely on the Second Amendment, it did put the debate about guns back on the court\u2019s docket in one of the most closely watched controversies this year. In that sense, the decision was the latest from the high court to side with gun rights groups. Still, Murphy \u2013 who has made gun safety legislation his life\u2019s work following the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Newtown, Connecticut \u2013 said \u201cthere is good news to celebrate today,\u201d pointing to dropping urban gun homicide rates. \u201cWe have a lot of work to do to make sure that something like Sandy Hook never happens again, that every kid gets the chance to graduate,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we have some reason to believe that this country is starting to turn the corner and change our laws in a way that makes our kids and our families safer.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/16/politics/chris-murphy-supreme-court-bump-stocks/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/17/2024", "section": "us"}}

The suspect, 36-year-old Daniel Callihan, was arrested Thursday after a 35-year-old mother was found dead and her two abducted daughters were later discovered in Mississippi \u2013 one dead and the other alive \u2013 in what investigators say may be a human trafficking case. Callihan is accused of \u201ccommitting brutal and heinous acts of violence,\u201d including the killings of Callie Brunett and her 4-year-old daughter, said the sheriff\u2019s office in Tangipahoa Parish, just north of New Orleans. As Callihan was being escorted by officers\u00a0from the Jackson Police Department headquarters Friday, a reporter asked him why he allegedly killed the little girl. \u201cI have no reason\u00a0for\u00a0what I did,\u201d Callihan told reporters. He added that he\u2019s been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder. Callihan\u2019s alleged accomplice, Victoria Cox, 32, was arrested on Friday at a motel in south Jackson, Jackson Police Chief Joseph Wade said. Callihan said Friday that he has yet to talk to a lawyer.\u00a0The\u00a0Rankin County District Attorney\u2019s\u00a0Office told CNN\u00a0they were unaware if Callihan had retained an attorney. Cox is being questioned and police said they are trying to determine her exact role in the incident. \u201cBased on information that I got yesterday and early this morning, she is an acquaintance and possibly girlfriend of Mr. Callihan,\u201d Wade said. Jackson investigators said the wooded neighborhood where the girls were found showed signs the location could have been used for human trafficking, including small animal cages. \u201cOur hearts are with all those affected by this tragic event. These are unspeakable crimes,\u201d parish Sheriff Daniel Edwards said in a social media post. \u201cWe ask everyone to keep Callie\u2019s family in your prayers.\u201d Earlier Thursday, an Amber Alert was issued for Brunett\u2019s abducted daughters, ages 4 and 6, after the mother was found dead in her home, according to Tangipahoa Parish Sheriff\u2019s Office Chief Jimmy Travis. After hours of searching, law enforcement in Jackson, Mississippi \u2013 about a 2-hour drive from Tangipahoa \u2013 tracked down the suspect and found a \u201ctragic scene,\u201d Wade said. After a short pursuit, Callihan was arrested in a wooded area near a house and the 4-year-old\u2019s body was found unburied in the woods behind the home, according to Wade. The other sister was found injured and was taken to a hospital. \u201cIt\u2019s very, very disturbing to me as a police chief and as a father to witness and see what I just saw,\u201d Wade said of the scene. An autopsy will be conducted to determine the exact cause of death, Wade said Friday. Due to signs of \u201csome human trafficking done\u201d at the location, Jackson authorities have reached out to human trafficking divisions with the Mississippi Bureau of Investigation and Hinds County, Wade said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to work this crime scene with a scalpel,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take a long time to process it.\u201d Many questions still remain, Wade said, including why Callihan allegedly took the children to Jackson and why the child was killed. Though Callihan had yet to be interviewed Thursday evening, investigators believe the suspect lives in Louisiana and had dated Brunett \u201coff and on,\u201d Travis said. When the Amber Alert was issued Thursday, it said a man, later identified as Callihan, was wanted \u201cfor questioning for a domestic violence incident, which occurred at the time of the abduction and resulted in a homicide.\u201d Investigators\u2019 top priority will be to interview Callihan and care for the surviving 6-year-old victim, Travis said. \u201cShe\u2019s been through something that most of us, hopefully, never ever get to experience. And she is going to have to spend the rest of her life living with this,\u201d the chief said. Police said Cox was compliant during her arrest and will be held accountable for her actions in the \u201chorrific event.\u201d \u201cShe could be possibly facing capital murder charges along with him or accessory before or after the fact,\u201d Wade said. \u201cWe have to bring justice for the loss of this child.\u201d CNN has reached out to the Jackson Police Department and the\u00a0Tangipahoa Parish Sheriff\u2019s Office\u00a0for more information.

What\u00a0he\u2019s talking\u00a0about\u00a0is\u00a0outrageous.\u201d The fundraiser, which featured former President Barack Obama, raised more than $30 million for Biden\u2019s reelection efforts, a campaign official told CNN. The conversation between Biden and Obama was moderated by television host Jimmy Kimmel. Biden\u00a0specifically argued on Saturday evening that the next four years could see openings on the\u00a0Supreme\u00a0Court, potentially leading to the\u00a0appointment\u00a0of\u00a0more conservative justices if\u00a0Trump\u00a0is reelected. \u201cThe idea\u00a0that if he\u2019s reelected he\u2019s going to\u00a0appoint two more flying flags upside down,\u201d\u00a0Biden said in\u00a0an\u00a0apparent reference to\u00a0a\u00a0flag that once flew\u00a0outside the home\u00a0of\u00a0Justice Samuel\u00a0Alito.\u00a0Asked by Kimmel whether he considered this the scariest part\u00a0of\u00a0a\u00a0second Trump\u00a0term,\u00a0Biden\u00a0responded, \u201cIt is one\u00a0of\u00a0the scariest parts.\u201d \u201cThe\u00a0Supreme\u00a0Court\u00a0has\u00a0never been\u00a0as\u00a0out\u00a0of\u00a0kilter\u00a0as\u00a0it is today, I mean never,\u201d the president said, discussing the ruling that overturned Roe v. Wade and how Justice Clarence Thomas\u00a0said other rulings could be reconsidered, including on contraception. Someone in the crowd interjected, \u201cincluding gay rights,\u201d to which\u00a0Biden\u00a0responded, \u201cNot on my watch.\u201d The Biden campaign has been looking to boost his financial war chest amid signs Trump is narrowing the money gap. Biden has led Trump in fundraising for most of the year, but the former president has seen a significant influx in cash come his way since securing the Republican nomination in March. Trump outraised Biden for the first time in April. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to just vote\u00a0against something in this election,\u201d Obama\u00a0said. \u201cWe have someone to worry\u00a0about.\u00a0And there\u2019s\u00a0a\u00a0whole\u00a0agenda\u00a0that we should be concerned\u00a0about. But we can take pride in\u00a0affirming the extraordinary work that Joe has\u00a0done.\u201d First lady Dr. Jill Biden, who also spoke at the event, touched on similar themes, saying that her husband \u201chonors the rule of law instead of trying to bend it to his own will. And rallies the world to fight for democracy and freedom.\u201d She also made the case for the dangers of a second Trump term, saying, \u201cTrump has told us again and again why he wants the White House. To give himself absolute power. To not be held accountable for his criminal actions. \u2026 To destroy the democratic safeguards that stand in his way.\u201d The first lady suggested that Trump is a bully, saying, \u201cWhen bullies threaten our loved ones, we don\u2019t just stand by.\u201d She added that those in attendance were showing Trump \u201cexactly how we deal with bullies. \u2026 We don\u2019t cower, we don\u2019t turn away.

{"id": "2024_06_16_us_reparations-targeted-by-conservatives-advocates-fight-back", "text": "A conservative group\u2019s lawsuit against a reparations program in Evanston, Illinois, that provides some Black residents with cash payments and housing assistance, has left advocates for reparations worried this could be the first of many attacks on their efforts to redress the harms of slavery, segregation and systemic racism in the United States. The complaint, filed against the city last month by Judicial Watch, claims Evanston\u2019s program violates the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment, and asks the court to declare the city\u2019s \u201cuse of race as an eligibility requirement for participation in the program to be unconstitutional.\u201d The argument follows a legal strategy frequently employed by conservative activists to attempt to undercut programs dedicated to addressing racial disparities in the wake of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to overturn affirmative action in college admissions. As the nation prepares to observe Juneteenth \u2014 the federal holiday on June 19 that commemorates the end of slavery in the US \u2014 reparations advocates tell CNN they are bracing for potentially more lawsuits against their programs, but stand firm in their commitment to finding ways to rectify the centuries of racism Black Americans and their families have endured. Under the Evanston reparations program, Black residents who lived in the city between 1919 and 1969 \u2013 as well as their direct descendants \u2013 can apply for up to $25,000 in housing assistance, CNN previously reported. The program was established in 2019 and amended last year to provide the option of a direct cash payment. Robin Rue Simmons, chair of the Evanston Reparations Committee, said the \u201clawsuit comes as no surprise and Evanston is prepared to defend this case.\u201d \u201cThis is not just an attack on Evanston,\u201d Rue Simmons said in a statement to CNN. \u201cThis is an attack on the movement for reparations. This is an attack on the overall movement for the advancement of reparatory justice, racial equity, and civil rights.\u201d Judicial Watch\u2019s lawsuit was filed on behalf of six people whose parents or grandparents lived in Evanston during the 50-year period the program covers but do not identify as Black or African American. \u201cAt no point in the application process are persons in the first and second groups required to present evidence that they or their ancestors experienced housing discrimination or otherwise suffered harm because of an unlawful Evanston ordinance, policy, or procedure or some other unlawful act or series of acts by Evanston between 1919 and 1969,\u201d the lawsuit states. \u201cIn effect, Evanston is using race as a proxy for having experienced discrimination during this time period.\u201d Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton told CNN in an interview that he believes Evanston\u2019s reparations program is a \u201cbrazen violation of the constitution and federal law.\u201d \u201cGenerally speaking, you can\u2019t treat people based on race and provide benefits to some and not others based on generalized complaints of historic racism,\u201d Fitton said. \u201cThe courts frown upon it.\u201d A spokesperson for the city of Evanston previously told CNN officials will not comment on pending legislation but will \u201cvehemently defend\u201d its reparations program. Justin Hansford, a commissioner for the National African American Reparations Commission,\u00a0rejected Judicial Watch\u2019s interpretation of the legality of reparations programs. \u201cJim Crow was based on race, redlining was based on race, housing segregation was based on race,\u201d Hansford said. \u201cIn all those situations you had a community that was harmed based on race. So now when you\u2019re trying to give that community justice, you are going to naturally give it to the same group.\u201d Fitton said it\u2019s possible he may file lawsuits against other reparations programs.\u00a0The Evanston lawsuit comes as states and cities across the country have formed commissions to explore how reparations can be distributed and who should receive them. The push for reparations and a making Juneteenth a federal holiday gained momentum following the racial reckoning in the aftermath of George Floyd\u2019s murder in 2020. But four years later, reparations and other race-based programs such as internships and scholarships across the country are continuing to face roadblocks following the gutting of affirmative action. On Wednesday, the Oklahoma Supreme Court dismissed a lawsuit that argued that the remaining survivors of the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre should be compensated by the city for damages, dealing a blow to their ongoing fight for reparations. And earlier this month, a federal appeals court blocked the Black-owned venture capitalist firm Fearless Fund from awarding grants exclusively to Black women entrepreneurs. Some reparations leaders say they have taken more race-neutral approaches to their programs with hopes of avoiding legal battles.\u00a0Kamilah Moore, chair of California\u2019s Reparations Task Force, said her commission recommended that the state\u2019s program be \u201clineage based\u201d meaning residents who apply for it would have to provide proof that their ancestors were enslaved or free African Americans who lived in the U.S. prior to 1900. Moore said the commission believes their lineage-based approach is constitutional. \u201cThat\u2019s not to say there may not still be a challenge to lineage-based programs by these same groups,\u201d Moore said. \u201cBut as lineage-based reparations advocates we are confident in our position from a moral, ethical and legal perspective.\u201d The task force has also recommended payments to residents based on the harms suffered from inequities such as housing segregation, mass incarceration, over policing, devaluation of Black businesses, and health disparities. The recommendations have been packaged in bills that are awaiting full approval from the California State Legislature, she said. In New York, Gov. Kathy Hochul signed legislation in December to establish a reparations commission that would study the lingering effects of slavery on New York residents and make recommendations for how the state could address \u201clongstanding inequities.\u201d Jennifer Jones Austin, a member of the New York commission\u00a0and CEO of the Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies, said they are looking to take a more holistic approach to reparations that may include individual payments, investment in Black communities and redressing laws to advance equity and equal opportunity for Black people. Jones Austin said she expected there would be legal challenges to reparations efforts given all the recent attacks on policies and programs created to repair the harms Black Americans have suffered. She said she worries New York could be targeted but is confident the commission is doing everything possible to work within the law. \u201cYou have to make sure you are dotting your I\u2019s and crossing your T\u2019s in any work you do that is controversial especially when it comes to money,\u201d Jones Austin said. \u201cIt does make the work more challenging.\u201d Areva Martin, a civil rights lawyer and reparations advocate, said she was not surprised by the lawsuit against Evanston. Martin said she believes conservatives have been emboldened by the gutting of affirmative action and are using the decision to sue other race-based initiatives. \u201cAnybody would be naive to not be aware of these very calculated and very orchestrated and planned attacks,\u201d Martin said. \u201cBut what I want people to know and what I want the message to be is that we are not going away. We are not going to shrink, we are not going to cower, we are not going to be intimidated.\u201d Hansford said he hopes the lawsuit against Evanston motivates supporters to rally around reparations programs. \u201cIt\u2019s a call to arms,\u201d Hansford said. \u201cWe know this is just the opening salvo in a long running struggle. People around the country should realize how real the reparations movement has become.\u201d CNN\u2019s Justin Gamble and Andy Rose contributed to this report.\u00a0", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/16/us/reparations-targeted-by-conservatives-advocates-fight-back/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/17/2024", "section": "us"}}

The suspected gunmen \u2013 Willie Zavon Hill, 27; Allen Gregory Chambers Jr., 30; Eugene Anthony Holmes, 22; and\u00a0Jacarree\u00a0Brian Green, 30, \u2013 each face three counts of first-degree murder, 20 counts of attempted murder and a single count of conspiracy to commit murder, according to an affidavit. Hill also was charged with evidence tampering. Investigators said he disposed of a vehicle used in the crime by dumping it in a canal, according to the affidavit. \u201cMiami-Dade was shocked, indeed everyone in South Florida was shocked, when 23 individuals were shot during the Memorial Day Weekend on May 30, 2021,\u201d said Miami-Dade County state attorney Katherine Fernandez Rundle at a Thursday press conference. The shooting outside the El Mula Banquet Hall near Hialeah stemmed from an ongoing rivalry between two gangs identified as the \u201cBricks\u201d and \u201cBack Blues/Apes\u201d in\u00a0Miami-Dade County, according to the affidavit. On the night of the shooting, the banquet hall was being rented out by a music group that featured several rappers affiliated with the \u201cBack Blues\u201d gang, the affidavit states. Shortly after midnight, a group of hooded men pulled up to the venue in an SUV and fired indiscriminately into a crowd standing outside, authorities said. Several people in the parking lot returned fire, leaving behind a crime scene littered with shell casings. Less than a month after the shooting, Chambers posted a music video on YouTube titled \u201cMr. Pull Up\u201d where he seemingly rapped about shooting and killing the \u201cApes.\u201d The video also showed multiple suspects in the shooting, including Hill, the affidavit said. \u201cWe as a law enforcement community vow that this investigation will continue until everyone who can be charged, is charged and held accountable for this horrific incident,\u201d Rundle said. Hill is being held on a $10,000 bond on the evidence tampering charge but none of the men are eligible for bond on their murder charges. CNN has been unable to identify attorneys for the suspects. Two other men have previously been charged in connection to the shooting, though charges in one of the cases have been dropped.  Last September, Davonte Barnes was convicted\u00a0of three counts of second-degree murder and 20 counts of attempted second-degree murder,\u00a0according to the Associated Press. He was sentenced to life in prison.

Police officers responded to an area on Lindbergh Avenue in Methuen, Essex County, shortly before 2 a.m. ET following multiple 911 calls regarding a shooting, Methuen Police Chief Scott McNamara said at a Sunday news conference. When officers arrived, McNamara said they found seven victims suffering from gunshot wounds. The injured were taken to a nearby hospital and one victim was taken by air ambulance from the scene, according to officials. The victim\u2019s ages range from late teens to 22 years old and they are from all over Essex County, authorities said. Five of the victims were in stable condition and two of the victims were listed in critical condition, Essex County District Attorney Paul Tucker told reporters. No one has yet been released from the hospital, according to Tucker, who added an eighth victim was found at the scene. The victim was fleeing the area when they suffered serious head injuries. \u201cI want to reassure our community that while these spontaneous car club meetups do not generally escalate to this type of violence, our policy has been and always will continue to take law enforcement action whenever appropriate to discourage this activity from occurring in the first place,\u201d McNamara said. The shooting occurred during a car party, which typically happens in an abandoned parking lot where young people between the ages of 16 and 20 listen to music, dance, vape and drink, according to McNamara, who said area law enforcement agencies have been dealing with the gatherings over the past several years. \u201cIn the past, when we found it here in Methuen, we\u2019ve always taken law enforcement action,\u201d McNamara said. \u201cWe\u2019ll cite them for trespassing.\u201d McNamara said police have been able to infiltrate and learn where these events will take place, but this incident was different. \u201cUnfortunately, where the incident happened last night, they\u2019ve never had that type of meetup in that type of area before,\u201d McNamara said.

{"id": "2024_06_13_us_cal-state-palestinian-protests", "text": "Pro-Palestinian protesters who entered and barricaded themselves in a building at California State University, Los Angeles, on Wednesday cleared out by early Thursday, a spokesperson for the school told CNN. Most protesters left the Student Services Building of their own accord around 1:15 a.m. local time and returned to an unauthorized encampment on campus. No arrests were made, university spokesperson Erik Frost Hollins said. A small group remained inside but the university\u2019s Department of Public Safety officers entered the building and asked them to leave, and they complied, Hollins said. University President Berenecea Johnson Eanes, whose office is in the building, according to the university\u2019s website, was among dozens of employees who remained inside during the takeover. She and other administrators were safely escorted out after midnight Thursday, Hollins said. The group of 50 to 100 protesters barricaded the exits on the first floor on Wednesday and blocked off areas around the building, Hollins told the Los Angeles Times. The university asked employees on the upper floors to shelter in place, Hollins said. Video from CNN affiliate\u00a0KABC showed protesters moving furniture on the first floor of the building with signs on windows and plywood spray-painted with the messages, \u201cThe time to escalate is now!\u201d and \u201cCSU stop funding genocide.\u201d Demonstrators \u201cdon\u2019t want folks inside the building,\u201d a protester told KABC, saying, \u201cThis is not a hostage situation.\u201d The university called the Los Angeles Police Department to assist, CNN affiliate\u00a0KCAL/KCBS reported. \u201cSignificant\u201d damage including broken glass and graffiti was observed on the interior and exterior of the building, primarily the first four floors, according to Hollins. All classes and operations at\u00a0the university\u2019s main campus will be held remotely until further notice, according to a message posted on its\u00a0website. \u201cPlease do not come to main campus,\u201d the Protest Action Alert reads. Meanwhile, operations on Cal State\u2019s downtown campus will remain normal, the alert said. An assessment will be done to determine the overall cost of the damage and when the building, which houses services like financial aid and student support, will reopen. \u201cIt will take time to recover and to provide these services in the same way that we were able to before, and that\u2019s deeply unfortunate,\u201d Hollins said. On Thursday, Eanes ordered the encampment that has been on the campus for the past 40 days to be dismantled following what she referred to in a statement as \u201cviolence and destruction\u201d that unfolded Wednesday night, according to the university. \u201cKnow that we will recover from this, but also know that I am committed to doing everything we can to ensure this will never be allowed to repeat,\u201d the university\u2019s president said. \u201cThe Encampment has crossed a line. Those in the Encampment must leave.\u201d Eanes did not give a timeline of when the encampment will be dismantled or if the university would request assistance from law enforcement. Three employees and a student were reportedly assaulted during the protest \u2013 one person was assaulted as the protesters entered the university building, another as they were leaving, one was \u201caccosted on a walkway\u201d and another who was looking at damage, said Eanes, who did not say if they were injured. The demonstrations escalated due to frustration with university officials who sent a message regarding encampments, which \u201creiterated something \u2026 said 20 days ago,\u201d a protester told KABC. The protesters\u2019 actions at Cal State, Los Angeles, come as some American campuses continue to be convulsed by pro-Palestinian demonstrations denouncing Israel\u2019s handling of its war against Hamas in Gaza. Protests late this spring gripped schools across the country, but they have persisted in some places, including at UCLA \u2013 some 20 miles west of Cal State, Los Angeles \u2013 where 27 people were arrested Monday after setting up multiple pro-Palestinian encampments that police said were unlawful. Additionally, at least six University of California Police Department personnel and other safety officers were injured in confrontations with the protesters, including one person with a head injury, Rick Braziel, UCLA\u2019s associate vice chancellor for campus safety, said in\u00a0a news release Tuesday. Of those arrested at UCLA, 18 were students, and two were faculty, police said. Another was a former student, while the rest were not affiliated with the university.

Trump\u00a0said it again\u00a0on Saturday during a speech in Detroit: \u201cYou know, I got the \u2018Man of the Year\u2019 in Michigan. Years ago, long before politics, like 12, 13 years ago.\u201d Facts First:\u00a0Trump\u2019s claim remains false. Nobody has ever been able to find any evidence that he was ever named \u201cMan of the Year\u201d in Michigan before he ran for president. The state itself does not give out a \u201cMan of the Year\u201d award; Trump has never lived in Michigan; and he has never specified who supposedly gave him this award and when. After\u00a0nearly seven years\u00a0of media fact checks\u00a0of Trump\u2019s many\u00a0declarations\u00a0that he had once been named Man of the Year in Michigan, a Republican group in the state, the Oakland County Republican Party,\u00a0gave him\u00a0its first-ever\u00a0\u201cMan of the Decade\u201d award at an event in 2023. But Trump made clear Saturday that this is not what he was talking about. Rather, he said again that he had been named \u201cMan of the Year\u201d in Michigan more than a decade ago. Trump\u2019s campaign did not immediately respond to CNN\u2019s Sunday request for any evidence that he received such an award. Trump himself has professed confusion about who supposedly gave him the award and why. In a 2022 speech in Michigan, he\u00a0said, \u201cYour Chamber of Commerce, somebody, who the hell knows what it is, they named me the Man of the Year in Michigan.\u201d (Michigan\u2019s Chamber of Commerce had long made clear that it\u00a0did not have\u00a0such an award.) In a 2019 speech in New Hampshire, Trump\u00a0said, \u201cIn fact, five or six years before I even thought about running, for whatever reason they named me \u2018Man of the Year\u2019 in Michigan. I said, \u2018How come?\u2019 I didn\u2019t even understand it myself.\u2019\u201d The most plausible explanation of Trump\u2019s story \u2014 to be specific, the most plausible explanation of what Trump has been inaccurately describing \u2014 came from Dave Trott, a former Republican US congressman in Michigan. After Trump made the claim in 2019, Trott\u00a0contacted CNN\u00a0to note that at a roundtable event with automotive executives in 2017, Trump had\u00a0suggested\u00a0he received the \u201cMan of the Year\u201d award at a 2013 event in Michigan where Trott had invited him to give a speech, a\u00a0Lincoln Day dinner\u00a0Trott had chaired in Oakland County.\u00a0At that event, Trott\u00a0gave Trump\u00a0a framed copy of Lincoln\u2019s Gettysburg Address and other gifts. But Trott emphatically noted that he did not give Trump any \u201cMan of the Year\u201d award, nor did anyone else there. Trott had become a fierce Trump critic by 2019. He\u00a0told CNN then\u00a0that, as a sitting congressman during the 2017 roundtable, \u201cI wasn\u2019t going to correct the president in front of the automotive executives.\u201d He added: \u201cBut now that I\u2019m out of Congress, I feel comfortable correcting the story.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/16/politics/fact-check-donald-trump-michigan-man-of-the-year/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/17/2024", "section": "us"}}

{"id": "2024_06_16_economy_rv-sales-economy", "text": "At this time of year, a reservation with Chill RV Rentals isn\u2019t usually the easiest to come by. The Los Angeles-based company\u2019s 16-camper fleet is typically booked solid, with the RVs oftentimes reserved weeks in advance. That\u2019s just not the case this year, said Nika Shneyder, who started the recreational vehicle rental business with her father in 2016. Bookings are light; plus, the people who are traveling are taking shorter trips, she said. \u201cWe\u2019re definitely seeing demand for RV travel slowed down compared to previous years, and I don\u2019t think it has to do with people coming out [the pandemic] and going on different kinds of trips,\u201d Shneyder said. \u201cI actually think it has a lot to do with people having less discretionary spending available.\u201d She added: \u201cI think we\u2019re going to pick up this summer, in July and August for sure; but historically speaking, we would have been busier by now.\u201d On the retail sales side, there are similar stories at play: Businesses are seeing softer, but improving, demand; consumers are showing some hesitancy but still are spending some; and industry members are exhibiting cautious, but growing, optimism. The industry appears to be not only getting back into gear but also settling into a familiar groove: its role as an economic bellwether. When consumer sentiment falters or the economy starts to teeter, RV sales follow suit, said Michael Hicks, an economics professor at Ball State University and director of Indiana University\u2019s Center for Business and Economic Research. RVs are typically large-dollar items for individuals and families, costing about $12,000 to $15,000 for a small, pop-up, tow-behind trailer, to some that run well north of $250,000 or more for a motorhome or luxury offering. \u201cPeople don\u2019t make these large, luxury purchases unless they\u2019re actually feeling better about the economy,\u201d said Hicks, who follows the RV industry closely. \u201cIt\u2019s so sensitive to interest rate changes, which often precede a downturn.\u201d RV shipments, a proxy for sales, are starting to pick back up after having bottomed out last year \u2014 an aftershock of a wild, pandemic-era upheaval. So, if business is on the upswing \u2014 especially at a time when the dual forces of elevated inflation and high interest rates are serving as headwinds \u2014 that could bode well for the economy as a whole, he said. Still, while that economic indicator doesn\u2019t appear to be flashing red right now, it likely will take interest rates falling from their current 23-year highs before it turns a solid green. \u201cWe think [interest rate cuts] will offer a little bit of a trigger to consumers becoming more active again,\u201d Michael J. Happe, president and chief executive officer of Winnebago Industries, said during the company\u2019s March earnings call. #Vanlife fallout-turned-opportunity The cost of borrowing is so high right now that Chill RV hasn\u2019t been able to add new vehicles to its fleet. \u201cWe\u2019ve been able to get a little creative with it,\u201d Shneyder said. \u201cInstead of purchasing our own inventory, because the rates are so high, we\u2019ve opened up a consignment program where we rent out privately owned RVs and do a profit-share.\u201d And that consignment well is pretty deep right now, a reflection of the pandemic-era #YOLO, #vanlife purchases that just didn\u2019t pan out for some. \u201cWe find people who during Covid went out and bought an RV for themselves, and they\u2019re just sort of done with it, they no longer use it,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd so now we\u2019ve rented it out for them.\u201d Five of the 16 vehicles in Chill RV\u2019s fleet are on consignment, she said. The big spike in sales seen during the pandemic turned the entire industry on its head and knocked its economic barometer out of whack, Hicks said. \u201cPotential buyers moved to purchase RVs earlier than they\u2019d originally planned,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cSo, some folks who were planning on buying one later jumped at the chance to hit low borrowing rates in the wake of the pandemic. This ate into 2022 and 2023 sales.\u201d Roller-coaster sales RV shipments rocketed north of 600,000 in 2021, a nearly 40% jump from the year before. They moved down to a historically strong, but noticeably smaller, 493,000 the next year, according to data from the RV Industry Association. By 2023, orders fell back to Earth \u2014 hard \u2014 clocking in at a mere 313,000. Dealers had to work through inventory while also navigating a steep drop-off in demand, said Monika Geraci, spokesperson for the RVIA. In addition to sales being pulled forward during the pandemic, other purchases were put on the blocks because of inflation and high interest rates, she said. Consumer spending on RVs did fall off last year, as compared to 2021 and 2022, inflation-adjusted Commerce Department data shows. Consumers spent nearly $38 billion in the category of \u201cother recreational vehicles,\u201d which excludes pleasure boats and aircraft, according to Personal Consumption Expenditures data. That\u2019s down from $42.9 billion and $44.1 billion in 2021 and 2022, respectively, but above 2019 spending of $31 billion. Now, the industry appears to be back at a point of equilibrium, where shipments, production and sales at the retail level are more closely aligned, she added. The latest forecast from RVIA, released earlier this month, projects shipments to land in the range of 329,900 to 359,100 for 2024, with a median of 344,000 units. That\u2019s expected to grow next year to between 374,200 to 408,600. The moderate increase is based on the expectation that interest rates are going to start coming down and inflation will cool further to the point people have the financial wherewithal to make the purchase, she said. \u201cWe do know from our surveys that the desire to own an RV and purchase an RV is still there and still is high,\u201d she said. \u201cInflation, interest rates do just hit people\u2019s pocketbooks and make it a little bit harder to follow through on those desires.\u201d RV capital of the world To fully get a sense of how the RV industry (and, in turn, the broader economy, is faring), one need not look further than Elkhart, Indiana. The Northern Indiana city that sits 15 miles east of South Bend is known as the \u201cRV Capital of the World.\u201d Many of the leading manufacturers and suppliers have facilities there, resulting in the vast majority of the RVs on US roads being made in Elkhart. \u201cAnd even the ones that are not made here are still made here, because all their parts are made here,\u201d said David Titus, co-owner of International RV Wholesalers in Elkhart. Manufacturing and transportation account for more than 60% of all the jobs held in Elkhart, making the county one of the country\u2019s biggest production hubs, Bureau of Labor Statistics data shows. When there\u2019s been a downshift in the industry, Elkhart (and its unemployment rate) has reflected that pain. In March 2009, during the Great Recession, Elkhart County\u2019s jobless rate hit 20.6% and spiked to 30.6% in April 2020, the height of the pandemic lockdowns. Flash-forward to January 2023, when shipments had fallen off due to oversupply and a pullback in demand, and unemployment jumped to 5.6% from 3%. It\u2019s since moved back down and in April 2024 stood at 3.8%, a tick below the national rate of 3.9% at the time. \u201cEmployment in this sector is ebbing a bit, which is consistent with slower sales,\u201d said Ball State\u2019s Hicks. \u201cHowever, we haven\u2019t seen any of the large job cuts we did during the Great Recession. [The unemployment rate in Elkhart] suggests optimism by RV producers that the market will strengthen in the coming months.\u201d \u2018Bumper-to-bumper\u2019 optimism At the dealer level, there\u2019s optimism as well. Customers are still driving on the lot looking to buy an RV, International RV Wholesalers\u2019 Titus said, adding that banks are still happy to lend the money \u2014 albeit at more of a premium. Some customers are leaning toward something a little more modest because of interest rates, he said, adding that they\u2019re also planning shorter trips closer to home \u2014 versus the 3,000- or 4,000-mile cross-country haul \u2014 because of inflation and fuel costs. Complicating matters further is a cyclical factor: It\u2019s an election year, and like clockwork, some people appear to be holding off and waiting to see what happens, he said. \u201cElection years are always off, so we\u2019ll be happy when we get through November,\u201d he said. \u201cObviously, this is a little more of a contentious election than normal, putting it nicely, than what we\u2019ve seen in the past. It really doesn\u2019t matter who wins, just as long as it\u2019s done.\u201d Still, sales are softer than they were during the pandemic boom, but they\u2019re trending better than last year and above pre-pandemic times, Titus said. \u201cYou drive through town, everybody\u2019s busy; you can\u2019t go to a restaurant at 6 o\u2019clock and expect to get a table; you go to the store, and it\u2019s busy,\u201d Titus said. \u201cI\u2019m looking at a four-lane road in front of my place right now, and it\u2019s bumper-to-bumper traffic.\u201d He added: \u201cHere in Elkhart it does seem business as usual. Could business be better? Of course it could. But could it be worse? It sure could.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/16/economy/rv-sales-economy/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/17/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_14_us_parkland-demolish-stoneman-douglas-high-school-shooting", "text": "For six years, a building at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, where a gunman killed 17 people, was a nightmare frozen in time. But now, the 1200 building, which contained the bloody and heartbreaking remnants of the massacre, is being demolished. The demolition of the building began Friday morning, with an excavator tearing into the top floor of the three-story building under a clear sky. Family members of the victims watched from nearby tents on school property. Some cried. It is expected to take several weeks to complete, according to the Broward County Public Schools district. It will be dismantled in pieces, starting from the top. \u201cThis building has been a symbol \u2013 a symbol of failure. I know many in the community are happy to see it go,\u201d said Tony Montalto, who lost his 14-year-old daughter, Gina. His son is concerned people will forget once the building is gone. His wife had grown attached to it from the many times they took lawmakers through its corridors. \u201cAs for me, I\u2019m concerned because we haven\u2019t seen a solid plan yet for what\u2019s going to replace this building. We need something that\u2019s going to reflect the ones who were taken from us, the people they were before the tragedy.\u201d The district said in May the demolition would take place in summer 2024 following the end of the school year, which was Monday. The demolition was initially set to begin Thursday, but was delayed due to days of torrential flooding rain in South Florida. In a statement, the district said Friday it \u201cis\u00a0continuing to work with the families and school staff to determine future use of the site.\u201d The shooting ripped apart 17 families, including 14 students and three faculty members, on Valentine\u2019s Day in 2018. Seventeen others were wounded; their journey through grief and trauma continues to this day. The gunman was\u00a0sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. \u201cThis is one more step in our healing process,\u201d Lori Alhadeff, whose 14-year-old daughter, Alyssa, was killed at the school, told CNN Friday. \u201cAnd it\u2019s important that\u2026 six years later, that this building comes down and my family, you know, we\u2019re grieving the death of our daughter, Alyssa. We\u2019re healing but we\u2019re also trying to make change.\u201d Alhadeff founded the nonprofit Make Our Schools Safe, which promotes school safety. Alyssa\u2019s Law, which requires that public elementary and secondary school buildings be equipped with silent panic alarms to notify law enforcement, is on the books in six states. \u201cWe know that time equals life,\u201d said Alhadeff, noting that legislators who toured the building \u2013 \u201cseeing the blood on the ground, the glass on the floor, the horror\u201d \u2013 were moved to action. Alhadeff, who chairs the Broward County School Board, said she hoped the grounds would be turned into a \u201cusable space\u201d she called \u201cMSD Legacy Field\u201d that can serve as a \u201cteachable area where we can remember and keep the legacy alive.\u201d \u201cThe day before Alyssa was murdered, she played in her last soccer game and she was fierce,\u201d her mother recalled Friday. \u201cShe was captain of her soccer team, wore number eight, and we just miss and love Alyssa so much, and we will continue to keep your memory alive through Make Our Schools Safe.\u201d \u2018There is no closure\u2019 Before the demolition got underway, a rainbow soared over the area where families of the victims later gathered. Among those assembled were Debbi Hixon and her son Corey, whose father, Chris, 49, the school athletic director and wrestling coach, was killed that day. Alhadeff was there with her family, along with Montalto. And Max Schachter, whose 14-year-old son, Alex, was murdered in English class. Once the demolition started, Schachter did not stop watching. \u201cWhen I brought people through that building, it changed their lives,\u201d Schachter said. \u201cAnd everybody that came out of that building was focused to make sure that this never happens again.\u201d Even after it\u2019s torn down, Schachter said, the 1200 building will always be there. \u201cI will always remember the horrific images that I saw walking through that building, knowing the pain that Alex was going through when he was being shot and murdered. There is no closure for me. It\u2019s a progress through this journey that I am on.\u201d His only regret, Schachter said, is that more people will not be able to bear witness to the horror. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to understand the magnitude of the failures unless you\u2019re walking through that building,\u201d he said. \u201cIn Florida, we\u2019ve passed seven school safety bills since Parkland. We take it very, very seriously. You have to prioritize safety before education because you can\u2019t teach dead children. I\u2019m looking at this building today and it reminds me of all the failures that happened that day.\u201d It rained earlier but, by the time the excavator went to work, the sky was a clear blue. Some family members greeted each other with hugs. Others stood in small groups and talked. The school building was preserved pending the trials of both the shooter and Parkland school resource officer Scot Peterson, who stayed outside during the massacre. A jury acquitted Peterson on all counts, absolving him of wrongdoing in the\u00a0rare trial of a law enforcement officer. On the day of the massacre, the then 19-year-old gunman grabbed his AR-15-style rifle and magazines and rode in an Uber to his former high school. There, he took out his rifle and loaded it then wandered through the halls of the school. He\u00a0fired indiscriminately at various students and staff in hallways and classrooms.\u00a0He eventually left the school and was taken into custody several miles away. Students initially returned to the campus two weeks after the shooting. But building 1200, where most of the victims were killed,\u00a0was closed off behind emergency tape with its windows covered. A\u00a0new building\u00a0later replaced the temporary classrooms students had been using in the wake of the slaughter. Survivors and family members of those killed in the shooting were given \u2014 at their request \u2014 private, individual tours in 2023 inside the 1200 building and described a tragic and grotesque scene, with blood stains in the areas where the victims had been killed, bullet holes puncturing the classrooms, and Valentine\u2019s Day candy still on students\u2019 desks. Other school shooting sites destroyed Many schools where mass shootings occur choose to demolish the sites of the massacres to ease the extraordinary trauma experienced by survivors, victims\u2019 families and the rest of the community. Four years after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting that killed 26, a newly rebuilt school opened to students \u2014 including fourth-graders who were kindergarteners during the bloodbath. Columbine High School also demolished its school library, where most of the carnage ensued during the 1999 shooting that killed 13, and replaced it with a newly built school library named the Hope Library. In Uvalde, Texas, where students at Robb Elementary School were marred by the slaughter of 19 children and two teachers in 2022, city officials have said they also plan to destroy the building. \u201cIn many cases, these schools are closed or entirely renovated in an attempt to decrease the traumatic reminders that they have become for community members,\u201d according to the\u00a0Center for Violence Prevention\u00a0at Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia. This story has been updated with additional information. Correction: A previous version of this story misstated who absolved Scot Peterson of wrongdoing. A jury acquitted him on all counts.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/14/us/parkland-demolish-stoneman-douglas-high-school-shooting/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/17/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_16_politics_fact-check-trump-biden-black-unemployment-poverty", "text": "Former President Donald Trump is making a concerted effort to win over Black voters \u2013 in part by making inaccurate claims. During a Saturday\u00a0roundtable discussion\u00a0at a predominately Black church in Detroit, Trump said President Joe Biden \u201chas done nothing for you except talk,\u201d\u00a0adding: \u201cWe achieved the lowest African American unemployment rate and the lowest African American poverty rate ever recorded \u2013 ever, ever recorded \u2013 during my four years.\u201d Facts First:\u00a0Trump\u2019s claims about having achieved the lowest Black unemployment rate and poverty rate ever recorded were true\u00a0when he made them\u00a0before Biden took office, but they are not true today. Both of the record lows set during Trump\u2019s presidency were surpassed by new record lows during Biden\u2019s presidency.\u00a0 Trump could have correctly said Saturday that, during\u00a0his presidency, Black unemployment and Black poverty hit their lowest levels ever recorded\u00a0as of that point. Instead, he deceptively portrayed records that have been bested under Biden as supposed evidence that he has done more for the Black community than Biden has. Let\u2019s look at the data. Black unemployment: Record low set in 2023 under Biden The record low for the Black or African American unemployment rate, 4.8%, was\u00a0set under Biden in April 2023. That beat the Trump-era low that was a record at the time, 5.3% in August 2019 and September 2019. (A cautionary note: This official data series goes back only to 1972.) The most recent Black or African American unemployment rate, for May 2024, is 6.1%. Though that is a clear uptick from the 2023 record, it is\u00a0low by historical standards. And it is the same as the rate under Trump in February 2020, just before the Covid-19 pandemic caused unemployment to skyrocket. In the month Biden took over from Trump, January 2021, the Black or African American unemployment rate was 9.3%. The early pandemic jump is a good example of how unemployment rates, like all economic figures, are affected by factors other than who the president is. Black poverty: Record low set in 2022 under Biden The record low in the official poverty rate for Black individuals, 17.1%, was\u00a0set under Biden in 2022, the most recent year for which the data is available. Under Trump, the\u00a0lowest official poverty rate for Black individuals\u00a0was a then-record\u00a018.8% in 2019. There are\u00a0different ways to measure poverty. The Biden era also\u00a0holds the record low, 11.3%, for Black individual poverty under the\u00a0Supplemental Poverty Measure, which incorporates cash and noncash government benefits, tax credits, people\u2019s necessary expenses and geographic differences in the cost of living. The\u00a0lowest\u00a0supplemental figure for Black individual poverty under Trump was 14.7% in 2020. The supplemental figure for Black individual poverty spiked to 17.2% in 2022 after the\u00a0expiry\u00a0of pandemic relief\u00a0initiatives\u00a0that had lowered the figure in 2020 and 2021.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/16/politics/fact-check-trump-biden-black-unemployment-poverty/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/17/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_13_us_phoenix-police-homeless-justice-report", "text": "The Phoenix Police Department has for years violated the constitutional rights of residents experiencing homelessness and regularly discriminated against minority communities, according to a Justice Department report released Thursday. Justice Department investigators found that Phoenix police targets \u201cpeople experiencing homelessness, retaliates against people who criticize the police, and disproportionately uses force against people with behavioral health disabilities.\u201d The report also found that officers disproportionately enforce laws more severely against Black, Hispanic, and Native American people than against White people engaged in the same behaviors, even though \u201cthe city still claims it is \u2018unaware of any credible evidence of discriminatory policing.\u2019\u201d The blistering report marks the end of a\u00a0nearly three-year investigation into the police department\u00a0that began in the wake of several high-profile incidents, including the 2020 fatal police shooting of a man in a parked car. This investigation was the first time that a department\u2019s so-called pattern and practice investigation focused on officers\u2019 conduct toward people experiencing homelessness \u2013 a\u00a0clear warning for cities around the country where\u00a0police sweeps of homeless communities\u00a0have become a common response to the growth of tent cities in public spaces. DOJ investigators found that \u201cin the early mornings, officers cite or arrest homeless people for conduct that is plainly not a crime, such as sitting or lying down on public property or for \u2018trespassing\u2019 on private property when they are on a public sidewalk.\u201d Officers also repeatedly seized and destroyed the property of people experiencing homelessness under the guise of the city\u2019s \u201cclean-up operations,\u201d according to the report. \u201cA person\u2019s constitutional rights do not diminish when they lack shelter,\u201d the report concludes. Kristen Clarke, the head of DOJ\u2019s Civil Rights Division, told reporters on Thursday that \u201chomelessness is a challenge in Phoenix and in many cities across the country.\u201d \u201cOver-policing of the homeless has become a central pillar of the (Phoenix) police department\u2019s enforcement strategy,\u201d she added. \u201cThe criminalization of homelessness has no place in our society today.\u201d How US cities have responded to\u00a0a surge in unhoused residents\u00a0has become a major flashpoint in recent years, prompting people experiencing homelessness and their advocates to push for greater accountability among local officials. The Supreme Court is\u00a0expected to rule in the coming days\u00a0in a case challenging an Oregon city ticketing its unhoused residents. The justices have been asked to consider whether the practice\u00a0violates the Constitution\u2019s ban on \u201ccruel and unusual\u201d punishment. The\u00a0DOJ\u00a0report acknowledges that the Phoenix Police Department has instituted several changes to address unconstitutional policing since the beginning of the federal investigation. CNN is reaching out to the police department for comment. DOJ report finds police used excessive force The Phoenix Police Department frequently and inappropriately used deadly force, the report found, and has one of the highest rates of fatal shootings in the country per year. Among the causes of Phoenix officers\u2019 use of excessive force is that officers are taught a \u201cmisguided notion of de-escalation,\u201d the report says. \u201cRather than teaching that de-escalation strategies are designed to eliminate or reduce the need to use force,\u00a0(the Phoenix Police Department)\u00a0has misappropriated the concept and teaches officers that all force\u00a0\u2013 even deadly force \u2013\u00a0is de-escalation,\u201d\u00a0the report\u00a0reads. Officers also delayed\u00a0rendering aid to people whom they have shot, the report\u00a0found, or continued\u00a0to use force against those who\u00a0were already\u00a0incapacitated \u2013 sometimes even unconscious \u2013 because of gunfire. In one example highlighted by the Justice Department, officers shot an individual in the chest who had pointed a handgun at police. A supervisor at the scene instructed officers to use a non-lethal weapon to give \u201ca couple pops before we approach\u201d the man, who had fallen to the ground, and then said that there was \u201cno rush\u201d in administering CPR. The man was later pronounced dead. In other examples, officers were quick to physical violence or arrests when they felt that people were being disrespectful or criticizing the police. Police officers have also used excessive force against protesters to deter First Amendment-protected speech, the report\u00a0found, including by firing less-than-lethal weapons indiscriminately and without legal justification. Officers have used arrests to deter people from protesting, used criminal charges that were \u201cfar more serious than the evidence supported,\u201d and have \u201csought to justify serious charges with false evidence.\u201d The police department\u2019s \u201crecent commitment to protecting free speech is important, but it would be premature to claim\u00a0any new efforts are working,\u201d the report adds. Police target minority communities, report finds The sprawling report also found that the Phoenix Police Department disproportionately polices the city\u2019s minority communities, including through excessive tickets and arrests for less serious offenses. The DOJ probe found that the department \u201ccites and arrests Black, Hispanic, and Native American people for low-level traffic, drug, alcohol, and quality-of-life offenses at rates disproportionate to their shares of the population.\u201d The offenses cover a range of misconduct, according to the report, which said as an example that the department arrested \u201ccyclists for biking on the wrong side of the road almost eight times more in predominantly non-white neighborhoods, compared with white neighborhoods.\u201d DOJ also said that the Phoenix Police Department lacked the ability to \u201cadequately investigate\u201d complaints from community members that an office acted with \u201covert bias.\u201d Many complaints lodged against officers were classified by investigators at the department as \u201cofficer \u2018rudeness,\u2019\u201d according to the report. \u201cIn the vast majority of cases, (the police department) simply dismisses complaints of discriminatory policing absent evidence that an officer made an overtly racist statement or admitted to engaging in racist profiling,\u201d the report found. \u201cSince people are unlikely to admit to such things, (the department\u2019s) practice of requiring this evidence means that these complaints will necessarily be given short shrift.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/13/us/phoenix-police-homeless-justice-report/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/17/2024", "section": "us"}}

You can sign up\u00a0right here. You can listen to an audio version of the newsletter by clicking the same link. America\u2019s top central banker recently said the job market now looks the way it did before the Covid-19 pandemic drastically upended society. But that assertion may not be exactly right, according to ZipRecruiter\u2019s chief economist. \u201cOverall, a broad set of indicators suggests that conditions in the labor market have returned to about where they stood on the eve of the pandemic, relatively tight but not overheated,\u201d Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said in a news conference Wednesday after the central bank signaled that it plans to cut interest rates just once this year. The Fed chief said that the job market has come into \u201ca better balance\u201d over the past few years as the central bank aggressively lifted rates from near-zero starting in March 2022, which does coincide with what official government statistics show. The ratio of job openings to the number of unemployed job seekers, a measure Powell frequently cites to illustrate the job market\u2019s tightness, is now 1.2 to one, down from 2 to 1 in the spring of 2022. Worker filings for unemployment benefits fell to a 53-year low in 2022, reflecting an usually tight job market, but claims have trended upward since and are now roughly back to levels seen in the five years before the pandemic. The rate at which Americans are quitting their jobs is also back to pre-pandemic levels. It\u2019s true that today\u2019s US job market is running at a slower pace than it did in the immediate aftermath of the pandemic, when the economy staged a stunning comeback from the brief recession in 2020. Powell said it\u2019s just a matter of a continued \u201cunwinding of the pandemic-related distortions to both supply and demand.\u201d However, the 2024 job market differs from 2019 in a few key ways. And those factors may not change anytime soon. Before the Bell spoke with Julia Pollak, chief economist at jobs site ZipRecruiter, about her views of the job market. (This interview has been edited for length and clarity.) Before the Bell: Do you agree with Chair Powell\u2019s view that today\u2019s job market is back to a pre-pandemic normal? Julia Pollak: No, I would say that this is not quite the same normal. It\u2019s a new normal, and there are some key differences. We\u2019re still adding employees faster than 2019. But under the surface, the labor market is different in that it\u2019s slower, so the amount of churn, dynamism, hiring, firing, everything is slower. Companies are slower to fire, they\u2019re also slower to hire, and workers are slower to switch jobs. Now, is that necessarily a bad thing? It\u2019s not clear. Why is the job market slower now? High interest rates [currently at a 23-year high] are holding back investments and causing businesses to sort of take a wait-and-see approach that is disincentivizing risk taking. They\u2019re not hiring new grads at the same rate, they seem quite reluctant to do so. It\u2019s a slower, stay-in-place economy, partly because of risk aversion in the face of high interest rates. The quit rate being lower also suggests that there are fewer better alternatives for people than their current jobs. People are eager to hang on to their job that gives them flexibility. I think companies did a lot of soul searching during and after the pandemic amid labor shortages to meaningfully improve compensation, benefits and working conditions, and that also may have reduced attrition. Unlike in 2019, there is more remote work and more flexible work. Remote and hybrid work are like five times bigger than they were before the pandemic. That\u2019s here to stay. But what about this persistently wide gap between job openings and the number of unemployed folks seeking work? I think there\u2019s reason to believe the labor market is actually less tight now than it was in 2019. The number of job openings is higher than it was by around 15% or so, but online job postings are actually lower by ZipRecruiter\u2019s count. You see this sort of gap widening between openings and hires and quits and everything else within [the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey]. It seems like we are systematically over-counting openings by more and more each year for some reason. Markets fear the French far right could trigger a financial crisis Investors are worried France could be facing a financial crisis if the political center collapses in upcoming parliamentary elections, leaving far-right populists in charge of the European Union\u2019s second-biggest economy, my colleague Olesya Dmitracova reports. President Emmanuel Macron called the snap elections a week ago after his party lost to the\u00a0far right in a vote for EU lawmakers, a shock move that\u00a0rattled\u00a0markets for French stocks and government bonds. There has been widespread speculation since then that the National Rally, the party of far-right doyenne Marine Le Pen, is poised to become the most powerful force in parliament, unseating Macron\u2019s centrist bloc. Such an outcome could make it harder to reduce France\u2019s huge government debt pile, equal to 110.6% of gross domestic product at the end of last year, and could even add to it. A bitterly divided parliament would also struggle to cut the budget deficit \u2014 the gap between government spending and tax receipts \u2014 which\u00a0reached 5.5%\u00a0of GDP last year.

{"id": "2024_04_17_us_massachusetts-satanic-temple-bombing-arrest", "text": "A suspect has been arrested for allegedly throwing a pipe bomb that damaged The Satanic Temple headquarters in Salem, Massachusetts, where investigators found a letter addressed, \u201cDear Satanist\u201d at the scene last week, prosecutors announced. Sean Patrick Palmer, 49, of Perkins, Oklahoma, was arrested Wednesday morning and has been charged with using fire or an explosive to damage a building used in interstate or foreign commerce during the April 8 incident, the US Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of Massachusetts said. CNN has been unable to identify an attorney for Palmer. Surveillance cameras captured a person igniting and throwing a pipe bomb over a fence and onto the covered porch of The\u00a0Satanic\u00a0Temple building at approximately 4:14 a.m., according to an affidavit written by an FBI agent. The explosive partially detonated and caused minor fire damage to the exterior of the building, according to the document. No one was in the building at the time and staff discovered the damage later that day, according to Salem police. The makeshift device was constructed using a plastic pipe covered with taped-on metal nails and filled with what was preliminarily identified as smokeless gunpowder, the affidavit said. The surveillance footage also showed the man throwing a small item into the building\u2019s flower bed, where investigators later found a handwritten note, the affidavit said. The note, addressed \u201cDear Satanist,\u201d references Elohim, a Hebrew name for God, and appears to allude to an incident of vandalism at the building last year, the affidavit said. The letter reads, in part, \u201cElohim send me 7 months ago to give you peaceful message to hope you repent. You say no, Elohim now send me to smite Satan and I happy to obey,\u201d according to the affidavit. About 7 months ago, on September 11, the Satanic Temple headquarters was vandalized with Bible verses spray painted in white, according to the affidavit. Palmer had not been charged in connection with that incident as of Wednesday. Investigators also identified a car appearing to belong to Palmer that was in the area at the time of the incident, as well as a 2018 photo on the suspect\u2019s Facebook that shows him wearing a tan vest similar to one worn by the man in the video, prosecutors said. If found guilty, Palmer faces up to 20 years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000, prosecutors said. Palmer will make an initial appearance in an Oklahoma district court on Thursday and is expected to appear in federal court in Boston at a later date, according to prosecutors. The\u00a0Satanic\u00a0Temple\u2019s social media accounts say it\u2019s \u201cthe only federally recognized international (non-theistic) religious Satanic organization.\u201d Its Salem headquarters are located in a former funeral parlor, where it maintains an art gallery with a permanent exhibit on Satanism, witch hunts and moral panic, its\u00a0website says. Members also perform ceremonial events and hold meetings and lectures in the space. In a news release, Salem police said the headquarters has been the target of bomb threats and possible hate crimes in the past, including a June 2022 incident during which a man was arrested on suspicion of arson, they said. Earlier this year, a Michigan man also was arrested and charged in his state with planning to bomb the temple, according to the release. In a statement on the arrest Wednesday, The Satanic Temple expressed thanks to police and federal investigators and \u201cprofound gratitude to the Salem community for the outpouring of support we have received during this challenging period.\u201d CNN\u2019s Zenebou Sylla contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/17/us/massachusetts-satanic-temple-bombing-arrest/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/17/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_16_us_police-investigation-shooting-saturday-michigan-nine-injured", "text": "Police are looking for a motive after at least nine people were shot in what appears to be a \u201crandom\u201d shooting that sent panicked families fleeing a crowded recreation area in Rochester Hills, Michigan, on Saturday afternoon, authorities said. Police on Sunday identified the gunman as Michael William Nash, 42, from Shelby Township. He pulled up to the Brooklands Plaza Splash Pad, left a vehicle and opened fire from roughly 20 feet away, reloading multiple times, Oakland County Sheriff Michael Bouchard said Saturday. The suspect fired \u201cpotentially 28 times,\u201d the sheriff said. \u201cUnder no circumstances is it normal for ice cream cones and flip flops to be strewn amongst blood and bullet casings,\u201d said Michigan Rep. John James at a news conference Saturday night. Nash was found dead with an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound at the home he shared with his mother after police tracked the weapon from the shooting to an address around half a mile from the crime scene, Bouchard said. Police found a rifle on the kitchen table. Nash didn\u2019t have any previous police contact or criminal record, according to Bouchard. The victims, including two small children and their mother, were injured in the shooting and taken to four local hospitals with \u201cvarying kinds of injuries,\u201d the sheriff said. As of early Sunday morning, two of the victims were in critical condition and seven were in stable condition. \u201cWhen I got on scene, I started to cry,\u201d said Rochester Hills Mayor Bryan Barnett on Saturday night. \u201cBecause I know what a splash pad is supposed to be. It\u2019s supposed to be a place where people gather, where families make memories, where people have fun and enjoy a Saturday afternoon and it wasn\u2019t today.\u201d An 8-year-old boy is in critical condition after suffering a gunshot wound to the head and his 4-year-old brother was shot in the thigh and is in stable condition, Bouchard said. Their 39-year-old mother, with wounds to the abdomen and leg, was also in critical condition. Six other gunshot victims, including three women and three men ranging in age from 30 to 78, were in stable condition Saturday night. The incident appears to be \u201crandom\u201d as the suspect has \u201cno connectivity to the victims,\u201d and authorities have yet to determine a motivation for the attack, the sheriff said. \u201cWe\u2019ll be looking for any evidence \u2026 that would give us an inclination of what may be driving this individual prior to this terrible moment,\u201d Bouchard said. The shooting comes at a time when communities are still recovering from two mass shootings in the state in recent years. In February 2023, a gunman killed\u00a0three Michigan State University\u00a0students and\u00a0critically wounded\u00a0five others. A couple years prior, a teenager killed four students at an Oxford, Michigan, high school in 2021. \u201cWe\u2019re not even fully comprehending what happened at Oxford, and now we have another complete tragedy that we\u2019re dealing with,\u201d Bouchard said. The shooting extends the list of around 220 mass shootings in the country so far this year, according to the\u00a0Gun Violence Archive. The archive, like CNN, defines a mass shooting as one in which at least four people are shot, excluding the shooter. How the shooting unfolded at a crowded splash pad Bouchard said the gunman arrived at the splash pad and opened fire with a Glock 9 mm handgun. \u201cIt looked chaotic. You could see people kind of just enjoying the day and then it was a scramble,\u201d Bouchard said, referencing video of the shooting. \u201cPeople were falling, getting hit, trying to run.\u201d Detectives recovered 28 shell casings at the scene, according to a news release from the sheriff\u2019s office. \u201cHe started firing once he was out of his car from the base of the steps, climbing the steps, reloading and then was firing from the top of the steps in the splash pad area before he left and appeared to leave in no rush, just calmly walked back to his car,\u201d Bouchard said. One witness said she first thought there were fireworks going off. \u201cWe were sitting out on the patio and we heard what we thought was firecrackers and I guess it was gunshots because we heard people screaming, like \u2018help us, help us!\u2019\u201d Cheryl Delcotto told CNN. \u201cSo, we ran around, I called 911, I couldn\u2019t get a hold of anybody because I guess people were already calling.\u201d The first 911 call alerting police to the incident was made around 5:11 p.m. Bouchard said a Rochester Hills sergeant responded to the scene within two minutes \u2013 before the call was dispatched. By that point, the suspect had already fled the scene, according to Bouchard. Authorities located the handgun and three empty magazines at the scene, the sheriff said. Delcotto, who was visiting a home near the splash pad when the shooting began, described seeing blood-covered victims and people rendering aid. \u201cI see people laying on the ground, I seen a guy who was shot in the stomach who was sitting on a chair, an older man,\u201d she said. Then she saw a man whose \u201cson was coming out on a stretcher \u2013 with blood all over his face, and it was scary.\u201d Suspect found dead after police breached his home After the shooting, police traced the weapon found at the scene to a nearby home, where they found a vehicle matching a description of the one that drove away from the scene of the shooting, according to the sheriff. The suspect was not known to authorities until they did a \u201cquick investigation\u201d and determined who they believed was involved based on evidence from the scene of the shooting. Police had containment on the home within 45 minutes to one hour, according to Bouchard. There was \u201can\u00a0acknowledgment\u00a0that\u00a0we\u00a0were\u00a0there\u00a0and\u00a0we\u00a0heard\u00a0or\u00a0saw\u00a0him,\u201d Bouchard said. After making attempts to contact the suspect, law enforcement \u201cbreached the home and deployed drones to begin an examination of the home,\u201d and located the deceased suspect,\u00a0Bouchard\u00a0said. Police later found a handgun next to the deceased suspect inside the home. A drone that flew into the home while police surrounded it also found what appeared to be an \u201cAR-platform\u201d firearm on the kitchen table, Bouchard said. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t surprise me \u2013 because having that on the kitchen table is not an everyday activity \u2013 that there was probably something else, a second chapter, potentially,\u201d Bouchard\u00a0said. Police said the investigation is ongoing as they work to \u201cdetermine if there\u2019s either a digital or a paper trail that would give us some insight\u201d and piece together a timeline of how the shooting unfolded. Whether or not the suspect posted any relevant information on social media or has anything on his devices will also be part of the investigation, officials said. \u201cIt\u2019s gonna be one of those challenges to try to figure out why there appears to be no connection between the victims and the location whatsoever. A person doesn\u2019t live in Rochester Hills. He went to a Rochester Hills Park,\u201d Bouchard said. Authorities have also recovered video evidence from a nearby camera and are looking for bullet fragments, Bouchard said. Suspect\u2019s former bankruptcy attorney remembers him as \u2018soft-spoken\u2019 As the investigation continues and new details emerge about the suspect, an attorney who represented Nash in a 2011 bankruptcy case remembered him as a \u201csoft-spoken\u201d individual who suffered in the financial crash of 2007 to 2009. \u201cI remember Michael because he was very young to be needing bankruptcy. He was yet another person who fell victim to the aftereffects of the 2009 financial crisis,\u201d Kelli Meeks told CNN. Although Meeks is a licensed attorney, according to the state bar of Michigan, she told CNN she stopped practicing law in 2021 to become a consultant and leadership coach. Nash was trying to run his own landscaping business, but after the financial crash, Meeks says it did not work out. She told CNN Nash was about $21,000 in debt and had his car and landscaping equipment repossessed. \u201cAnd on top of that, he had medical bills to take care of,\u201d Meeks said. \u201cHe was a young man down on his luck.\u201d Community was still reeling from Oxford shooting Bouchard called Saturday\u2019s incident a \u201cgut punch,\u201d and stressed the community is still reeling from the 2021 shooting at a high school in Oxford, just 15 miles north of Rochester Hills. \u201cNone of us in this room, in this community or in this country, anticipated going into Father\u2019s Day weekend with this kind of tragedy \u2013 that families will be deeply affected by forever,\u201d the sheriff said Saturday. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said\u00a0in a statement on X\u00a0she is in contact with local officials following the shooting. \u201cI am heartbroken to learn about the shooting in Rochester Hills,\u201d she wrote. \u201cWe are monitoring the situation as updates continue to come in, and are in touch with local officials.\u201d President Joe Biden and White House officials are also tracking the shooting, White House spokesperson Jeremy Edwards said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/16/us/police-investigation-shooting-saturday-michigan-nine-injured/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/17/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_04_11_us_creating-catan-board-games-card-cec", "text": "When Guido and Benjamin Teuber were young, their father would sit them down at a table in their small family home in Hessia, Germany on Sundays \u2014 the only day he wasn\u2019t working 12 hours as a master dental technician \u2014 to play board games. It was more than fun between father and sons: Klaus Teuber, who passed away last year, became a renowned board game creator. In 1995, Klaus Teuber released Catan (then called The Settlers of Catan) in Germany. The game would go on to become one of the most popular in the world. The brothers recall a day around 10 years ago when they tested out an early version of a Catan expansion with their parents. It was so unplayable that their mother left the table to go do the laundry. Such visions of family and friends huddled around a board game are universal. Everyone has their version \u2014 maybe it involves Parcheesi, or one of the hundreds of versions of Monopoly, or a raucous round of Cards Against Humanity at a party. With 19% of people worldwide playing board games as a hobby and the global board game market reaching almost $17 billion in 2023, it\u2019s an industry that\u2019s hard to ignore. Big box retailers and bookstores have shelves dedicated to games, and you can even find board game cafes in cities around the world. Tabletop games, such as Risk and Clue, are the most popular segment of board games, closely followed by card and dice games like Uno and Pandemic: The Cure. Tabletop games also encompass role-playing games like the iconic Dungeons & Dragons. Whether you\u2019re a dedicated hobby player or a casual board gamer, have you ever stopped to wonder what, exactly, it takes to create one of the beautiful board games you see everywhere? For National Board Game Day on April 11, CNN spoke with designers, artists, marketers and publishers of some of the most popular board games in the world to understand what it takes to build a game from scratch. Building the story of a board game Like a board game itself, developing a game requires both creativity and strategy at every stage \u2014 from ideation to playtesting to picking out the components, finding vendors and shipping the game. Patience, according to Benjamin Teuber, is key. After working with their father at the company for many years, Benjamin and his brother Guido\u00a0now run Catan GmbH, as the managing director and CEO, respectively. Since its release in 1995, the strategy game about collecting resources such as lumber, ore and grain, and using them to build empires has spawned numerous expansions and alternate versions. Tiles of the various resources form the game board, along with resource cards and models of roads, towns and cities in each player\u2019s color. To date, Catan has sold over 45 million copies worldwide. For Benjamin Teuber, who worked closely on the development of games with his father Klaus for over 10 years, the first step is writing down ideas for a new game. Then he takes about a month to think about these ideas, the story he wants to tell, and what some of the mechanics could be. \u201cThe story is always the core,\u201d says Benjamin Teuber. \u201cIf the story is well reflected in the mechanics, that is the point when you start making notes, then off the notes maybe some sketches on the computer in a graphic program.\u201d From there, he prints the first prototype on paper to play the game himself. Bringing the story to life The development process for Wyrmspan, which was released on March 29 by Stonemaier Games, was slightly different to that of CATAN. Wyrmspan is a spinoff of the award-winning Wingspan (also by Stonemaier), but instead of enticing birds to habitats on your board (with each bird represented on individual cards), you\u2019re building caves with various types of dragons. A dragon variation was one of the most requested spinoffs of the original, says Connie Vogelmann, Wyrmspan\u2019s designer. When Jamey Stegmaier, a co-founder of Stonemaier, approached Vogelmann to design the game in early 2022, the first step was to get approval from Wingspan designer Elizabeth Hargrave, who signed on as a developer for Wyrmspan. Because Vogelmann had a pre-existing game system, the development process for Wyrmspan was a bit faster than average. \u201cIt took about a year, or 15 months, to get the core of the game locked in,\u201d says Vogelmann. For context, the idea for Catan: New Energies, which is set to release in May, was in development around 10 years ago before getting shelved. During the pandemic, they revisited the idea and have been working on it since. The biggest design challenge, Vogelmann says, was paying homage to Wingspan while making Wyrmspan unique. \u201cIn some ways it was easier, because it provided some constraints for the game, but in some ways it was much, much harder.\u201d Vogelmann and Hargrave went through many iterations for Wyrmspan \u2014 for a while it was actually a bag-building game, where players\u2019 actions are affected by tokens added to or removed from a bag. Then, \u201cmid to late in the process,\u201d Vogelmann says they imported the Wingspan player mats into Wyrmspan, which is when the game clicked. \u201cThat was kind of the missing secret sauce.\u201d Playing, testing and playing again Once the designer has an initial prototype for a board game, they usually go straight into playtesting mode. For Jane Hoffacker, CEO of game studio Incredible Dream, this also includes printing the game on paper. Prior to co-founding Incredible Dream in 2020, Hoffacker worked in production and video games. They started at Activision with Guitar Hero before moving on to Riot Games, where they became an executive producer for the Emmy award-winning Netflix animated series \u201cArcane,\u201d based on League of Legends. \u201cI came in (to board games) with much more of a video game mindset,\u201d says Hoffacker. \u201cWhich was like, \u2018we need to go through 1,000 steps to get to whatever.\u2019\u201d They quickly realized this was not the case. \u201cI could literally print it out on my printer and take it to a local game cafe and sit down with strangers who were very willing to just test with me in person,\u201d Hoffacker says. These paper prototypes are used to test the game before the specific mechanics are set. Aside from game cafes, Hoffacker and the Incredible Dream team also take prototypes to game conventions where \u201cthere\u2019s lines of people waiting to play a paper prototype.\u201d These playtesting sessions, where people will play through a prototype of a game to give their feedback, will often result in a series of adjustments \u2014 or, in some cases, scrapping a game completely and going back to the ideation and development phase. Vogelmann, the designer of Wyrmspan, says she\u2019s very much a mechanism-first designer but that playtesting is really where a game\u2019s mechanics become clear. \u201cI tend to iterate and prototype very, very, very quickly,\u201d Vogelmann says. Her philosophy is to print it out and get it onto a paper page as soon as possible \u2014 no matter how ugly the prototype is. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard to envision how things are gonna play out \u2014 they play out one way in your head, they were perfect in your head, then you get to the table and it falls apart.\u201d From there, it\u2019s clear what works and what doesn\u2019t, and Vogelmann can try again. For Benjamin Teuber, the iteration process for Catan looks very similar, although the playtesting is quite different from most board game studios. When doing the first playtest with another person, he says it \u201cnormally completely fails.\u201d After this, he already knows whether it makes sense to continue developing or not. \u201cIn some cases, you will also have to say at some point, it just didn\u2019t work. It doesn\u2019t draw the people to the table \u2014 and you have to let it go.\u201d Making the game a physical reality Game development doesn\u2019t end once the mechanics and design are set. From there, developers work to get a finished game into the hands of players. This includes everything from finalizing the art and finding vendors to manufacture the game\u2019s parts, to deciding on what physical elements can be included \u2014 and in what form \u2014\u00a0based on the target demographic and price point. \u201cWe spent a lot of time trying to get the components right,\u201d Hoffacker says. Often, this has included working with a publisher (like Stonemaier) to finalize the elements and try to keep costs down through existing relationships. Increasingly, indie board game studios are using crowdfunding platforms to launch their games \u2014 offering stretch goals to upgrade certain elements to a premium look or feel. It\u2019s not just about the art \u2014 it\u2019s also about something as simple as font size, or how each element feels in someone\u2019s hand. For Incredible Dream\u2019s upcoming title A Gentle Rain, which it describes as a \u201ccozy tile placement game,\u201d each tile has a soft velvet feeling, with UV spot treatments on the back that look like a drop of water. \u201cWhen you touch it, you can actually feel all the ripples and it kind of feels nice as you\u2019re placing the tiles down,\u201d says Hoffacker. \u201cThen you\u2019re also supposed to place these tokens which are made out of wood, so it kind of mixes up the tactile feel between components.\u201d Another version of the game is being produced specifically for the mass consumer market, with 3D-sculpted plastic flowers instead of the wooden tokens. This version will be sent to big box stores such as Target, says Hoffacker. The quick turn for Wyrmspan was, in part, due to having Clementine Campardou, an artist from France, work at the same time as the development for the game \u2014 a process that usually happens after the core mechanics are locked in. Campardou hand-painted everything for Wyrmspan in watercolor, from the game\u2019s box to the backgrounds of the boards and the cards themselves \u2014\u00a075 unique cave cards and 183 unique dragons. This in itself was a challenge, with the team having to be pragmatic. \u201cWhen doing 200 of anything, if each takes 1 day or 5 days, that\u2019s the difference between a 2024 or a 2026 release date,\u201d Campardou told CNN via email. The entire process took Campardou a year and a half, with the first few months spent researching dragons, nature and weird animals. \u201cEven though I took no part in the game design itself, I had to understand how the pieces all fit together,\u201d Campardou says. \u201cFor the dragons, Connie and I worked closely so the classification would somehow match the designs, whether their dominant colour, their size, their family.\u201d One thing that many players don\u2019t think about, says Benjamin Teuber, is the actual cost of each individual element. \u201cYou have the final price of a game, which is so much higher than people think,\u201d he says. \u201cThis little token, or this dice, would make the game 50 cents more expensive \u2026 we always have to try to find the balance between nice and appealing material which is still affordable.\u201d If the game is for a mass consumer market, developers have to be a lot more conscious of the price. These players are often just looking for a fun diversion, says Kelli Schmitz, Director of Brand Development at Catan Studio, who works on Catan\u2019s marketing strategy for the English-speaking world. \u201cYour hobby gamer is a lot less price sensitive,\u201d she says. They understand that the cost isn\u2019t just about the physical components themselves, but also the expertise of the developers and the time it took to create the game. Once the vendors are picked, the parts manufactured, and the boxes compiled, the shipping of the games globally can take anywhere from six to eight months, depending on where the vendors are and the freight company that is chosen. The first print run of Catan in the US was 5,000 units out of a garage in Skokie, Illinois, near the airport, says Guido Teuber. Reflecting on Klaus Teuber\u2019s process for game design and development, Guido Teuber says that his dad always believed in having beautiful prototypes. \u201cHe invested so much time and money into creating these amazing prototypes,\u201d he says. \u201cWe gave our dad a really hard time if it didn\u2019t pan out. We had to be immersed, and he knew it.\u201d Otherwise, Benjamin would read his Mickey Mouse magazines, Guido would play the guitar and their mom would start talking about everything she had to do that day \u2014\u00a0like two loads of laundry. \u201cThe Mickey Mouse magazine \u2014 this is how the urban legend goes \u2014 was his (Klaus\u2019) test to see what was more interesting to me \u2013 the game or the MM magazine?\u201d Benjamin Teuber says. \u201cIf I started looking into it (the magazine) while playing, he knew he needed to get back to the basement and continue.\u201d The expansion game the family played that day 10 years ago did end up becoming something, says Benjamin Teuber \u2014 but it took multiple iterations to get there.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/11/us/creating-catan-board-games-card-cec/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/17/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_16_business_inside-out-2-summer-box-office", "text": "It was a weekend no doubt filled with Joy for Disney. The studio\u2019s latest animated film, \u201cInside Out 2,\u201d has rocked the lethargic summer box office, becoming the first movie of 2024 to reach $100 million in domestic sales during its opening weekend. Heading for a $155 million weekend per Comscore estimates, the movie marks the most lucrative box office opening since last July\u2019s \u201cBarbie,\u201d which grossed $162 million. According to Comscore and Disney, \u201cInside Out 2\u201d has also cinched the No. 2 spot for the all-time highest domestic animated three-day opening, lagging less than $30 million behind 2018\u2019s \u201cIncredibles 2.\u201d It also beat \u201cDune: Part 2\u201d as the highest-grossing opening of 2024 so far. \u201cThis performance came in well above our expectations,\u201d said Daniel Loria, editorial director at Box Office Pro, which collects sales and showtime\u00a0data from thousands of movie theaters across the United States. \u201cWe imagined it could \u2026 maybe match \u2018Toy Story 4\u2019s\u2019 $120 million opening weekend, but this result is absolutely extraordinary.\u201d Industry experts agree this weekend was a turning point for both Disney and the overall domestic box office. The summer has been off to a lukewarm start following a devastatingly low turnout Memorial Day weekend, which traditionally kicks off the season. Shawn Robbins, founder and owner of Box Office Theory, called this opening weekend a \u201cwell-earned victory lap for Disney, Pixar, and movie theaters.\u201d \u201cDisney is still in the early phases of its refocused theatrical prioritization,\u201d he said. \u201cTime will tell what original (intellectual property) can accomplish in the future and how consistently they can generate these types of performances again, but this is a major rebound for the parent company and for Pixar after a string of underperformers on both sides.\u201d In addition to production delays that have plagued studios as a result of the multi-month-long Writers Guild and SAG-AFTRA strikes last year, Disney\u2019s recent Marvel fare has been lackluster. \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine,\u201d the only Marvel property release this summer, is expected to reinvigorate audience enthusiasm after\u00a0\u201cThe Marvels\u201d disappointed last November\u00a0with a $47 million opening weekend. The third R-rated installment featuring the foul-mouthed anti-hero is set to hit theaters July 26. \u201cThe story of the summer was always going to come down to how Pixar (\u2018Inside Out 2\u2019) and Marvel (\u2018Deadpool & Wolverine\u2019) rebounded,\u201d said Loria. Domestic box office totals since the beginning of May are still down by about 28% compared to this time last year, according to Comscore data. But senior analyst Paul Dergarabedian said \u201cInside Out 2\u201d marks a \u201cmajor turning point\u201d for theaters, adding it only takes \u201cone or two overperforming films to change the entire narrative.\u201d \u201cThis the best possible news for Pixar, movie theatres and indeed rival studios whose own upcoming summer films (including the family friendly \u2018Despicable Me 4\u2019) will enjoy the tailwinds brought on by the amount of interest and increased foot traffic at the multiplex,\u201d Dergarabedian noted.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/16/business/inside-out-2-summer-box-office/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/17/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_14_us_catholic-bishops-indigenous-apology-reaj", "text": "The US Conference of Catholic Bishops issued a\u00a0formal apology Friday to Indigenous people for the mistreatment and trauma inflicted by the Catholic Church. The apology is part of a document approved by US Catholic bishops by a vote during its annual spring meeting in Louisville, Kentucky. The document titled\u00a0\u201cKeeping Christ\u2019s Sacred Promise: A Pastoral Framework for Indigenous Ministry,\u201d\u00a0includes the apology, discusses the church\u2019s role in the\u00a0boarding schools for Native American that forced assimilation in the 19th and 20th centuries, and sets a series of new policies for ministering to Indigenous Catholics. The vote passed 181-2 with three abstentions. \u201cToday, many North American Indigenous Catholics trace their faith to the decision of their ancestors to embrace Catholicism hundreds of years ago. Sadly, many Indigenous Catholics have felt a sense of abandonment in their relationship with Church leaders due to a lack of understanding of their unique cultural needs,\u201d the document states. \u201cWe apologize for the failure to nurture, strengthen, honor, recognize, and appreciate those entrusted to our pastoral care.\u201d Native Americans comprise approximately 3.5% of Catholics in the United States, according to the UCCB. In the document, the bishops described how Native Americans were forced to assimilate to White culture by the church. \u201cIn these schools, Indigenous children were forced to abandon their traditional languages, dress, and customs,\u201d the bishops said in the document. \u201cBoarding schools were seen as one expedient means to achieve this cultural assimilation because they separated Indigenous children from their families and Tribes and \u201cAmericanized\u201d\u00a0them while they were still malleable,\u201d the document adds. The guidelines issued Friday call on Catholic bishops to promote and expand healing and reconciliation with Native American communities, set up listening sessions and provide training for \u201cclergy, religious, and lay leaders to better minister to the pastoral needs of Indigenous Peoples,\u201d according to the document. \u201cWe must go beyond an apology to take concrete actions, if we are to restore trust within these communities and demonstrate our true willingness to be transparent, present, and accountable to them,\u201d the document states. Most Rev. Chad Zielinski, chairman of the conference\u2019s subcommittee on Native American affairs, said during the first day of the meeting on Thursday that the framework has been requested for a long time. Its goal is to help bishops refocus and \u2018reinvigorate\u2019 the ministry, he said. \u201cThis pastoral framework has been anticipated by Catholic indigenous communities in the US, who have long requested renewed pastoral attention and support from the bishops for their efforts on evangelization, reconciliation and healing, education and addressing matters of justice and social concerns in native communities,\u201d Zielinski said.  For years, advocates and Indigenous leaders have worked to raise awareness about harm inflicted on Indigenous children in boarding schools in the US and Canada and the subsequent generational trauma.  Hundreds of those schools were run or directly supported by the federal government to assimilate children into White society, but many were run by religious groups and churches after Congress passed the Civilization Fund Act in 1819. The legislation provided religious organizations with the resources to run more than a hundred schools for Native American children. Many operated like military training camps where children were subject to abuse, neglect and corporal punishment. In 2022, Pope Francis apologized for the Catholic Church\u2019s role in the abuse of Canada\u2019s Indigenous people, following the discovery of hundreds of unmarked graves on the grounds of former boarding schools and a years-long initiative by the federal government to investigate and create a historical record of the schools. Indigenous leaders in the US continue calling for a similar apology from the Pope.  In the US, Interior Secretary Deb Haaland launched an initiative to investigate the boarding schools that released initial findings in 2022, showing that 19 boarding schools accounted for the deaths of more than 500 American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian children.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/14/us/catholic-bishops-indigenous-apology-reaj/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/17/2024", "section": "us"}}
