{"id": "2024_05_08_us_johnny-cash-daisy-bates-us-capitol-statues", "text": "The US Capitol will soon officially welcome two new, iconic figures. A statue of Daisy Bates, a civil rights journalist and activist who is perhaps best known for her role as a mentor to the Little Rock Nine \u2013 a group of Black students who were the first to desegregate schools and break Arkansas\u2019 color barrier \u2013 is replacing one of Uriah M. Rose, an attorney and former president of the Arkansas Bar Association. Another statue \u2013 of James Paul Clarke, the state\u2019s 18th governor \u2013 is set to be replaced in September by one of country music icon Johnny Cash. The statues of Clarke and Rose have been in the US Capitol for more than a century, with Rose being installed in 1917 and Clarke in 1921. The National Statuary Hall\u2019s collection includes two statues from all 50 states.  Bates\u2019 statue was installed in the hall on May 3 and officially unveiled on Wednesday, during a ceremony organized by the office of House Speaker Mike Johnson.  The bill to replace Rose and Clarke\u2019s statues was signed in April 2019 by then-Gov. Asa Hutchinson. Soon after, Bates and Cash were chosen as their replacements, CNN reported. Many had called for taking down the previous Arkansas statue representatives, including Clarke\u2019s own great-great-grandson, Democratic state Sen. Clarke Tucker. Citing statements made by Clarke, including his 1894 proclamation that the people of the South had looked to the Democratic Party to \u201cpreserve the white standards of civilization,\u201d Tucker said the change was needed. \u201cIn the context of who represents Arkansas in Statuary Hall, the time has come to move in a new direction,\u201d he said. Rose, meanwhile, had stayed loyal to Confederate Arkansas throughout the Civil War, according to the hall\u2019s website. Cash and Bates were Arkansas natives. Cash was born in Kingsland before his family moved to Dyess in east Arkansas. After moving away for much of his professional career, Cash returned in 1968 to play the \u201cJohnny Cash Homecoming Show,\u201d and again in 1969 to play at Cummins Prison. Bates grew up in Huttig, but moved to Little Rock in 1941, where she and her husband, Lucious Christopher \u201cL.C.\u201d Bates, started the Arkansas State Press, a newspaper devoted to the fight for civil rights. During her time as president of the Arkansas chapter of the NAACP, Bates led the charge for school desegregation, emerging as a key civil rights advocate during the 1957 desegregation of Central High School. Bates died in Little Rock in 1999. \u201cRemoving these kinds of statues isn\u2019t denying history as much as it\u2019s saying, \u2018We acknowledge the true history of it. We acknowledge this was wrong,\u2019\u201d said Benjamin Victor, the sculptor of Bates\u2019 statue. Victor said he sees the replacements as the \u201cright thing to do,\u201d noting the previous statues represent a time in American history \u201cthat was very ugly and awful.\u201d It\u2019s not the first time the US Capitol has had Confederate statues removed from the Statuary Hall. In 2016, Florida state lawmakers voted to replace its statue of Confederate Gen. Edmund Kirby Smith with one of civil rights leader, Mary McLeod Bethune. The statue was officially installed in July 2022, with Bethune making history as the first Black person to have a state-commissioned statue in the Statuary Hall. Victor, an artist from Idaho, has other statues on display in the collection \u2014 including Nevada\u2019s Sarah Winnemucca, Nebraska\u2019s Chief Standing Bear and Iowa\u2019s Norman E. Borlaug. He is the only living artist to have three (now four) permanent portrait sculptures displayed in the Capitol, notes the Nebraska Commission of Indian Affairs \u2013 an organization that helped secure Chief Standing Bear\u2019s statue in 2019. Little Rock-based artist Kevin Kresse, designer of Cash\u2019s statue, has his installation and dedication tentatively scheduled for late September, said Shane Broadway, chairman of the National Statuary Hall Steering Committee. Kresse is a lifelong, self-proclaimed\u00a0\u201cArkansawyer\u201d\u00a0and Cash fan. In choosing the details of Cash\u2019s statue, Kresse included a Bible tucked in his hand and Cash\u2019s signature guitar, which he referred to as Cash\u2019s \u201cbackpack that took him all over the world.\u201d Kresse \u2013 who is 62 now but was 59 at the time of the Capitol commission \u2013 said when Cash was his age, \u201chis star was starting to dim, but he didn\u2019t know at the time that some of his most impactful work was right around the corner\u201d \u2013 much like Kresse\u2019s own career, he said. Kresse doesn\u2019t want the full significance of the moment to be forgotten, he said. \u201c(Both Daisy and Johnny are) two people who stood up for those who are overlooked, passed over and pushed off to the side,\u201d Kresse told CNN. \u201cThey both came from abject poverty and some real trauma and tragedy early in their life and I think it really (caused) both of them to never forget where they came from.\u201d The artists for both statues were selected through a national competition organized by the committee and the Arkansas Capitol Arts and Grounds Commission under the endorsement of Secretary of State John Thurston who also serves as chairman of the commission, Broadway said. While the state of Arkansas handled the entire process of selecting a statue, choosing sculptors, and raising funds, \u201cThe Architect of the Capitol\u2019s Curator oversees the process from Congress\u2019 perspective and coordinates heavily with the states,\u201d Grace White, communications director for the US Committee on House Administration, told CNN in a statement. As a finalist, Victor traveled to Little Rock where he explained his vision to the selection committee while presenting a model of the statue. Victor didn\u2019t know who Bates was prior to entering the competition but felt compelled to help share her story after learning of her \u201cfearlessness.\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s this sort of unsung hero in US history that I love to celebrate,\u201d Victor told CNN. \u201cThis type of hero that everyone should know but relatively few people do know of. And we\u2019re changing that with each of these statues.\u201d Throughout her 1987 memoir \u201cThe Long Shadow of Little Rock,\u201d Bates likens her life to that of a red rose, which Victor incorporated on the statue\u2019s lapel, he said. Above the rose sits a NAACP pin. Victor believes the new statue\u2019s imprint in history will be monumental. \u201cIn that room in Statuary Hall, you got the spot where (Daisy) replaced Uriah Rose (and) it\u2019s right next to (Confederate President) Jefferson Davis. It\u2019s going to be a really powerful setting for Daisy to be included in because Jefferson Davis\u2019s statue is sort of scowling. It looks kind of negative. \u201cAnd Daisy Bates is smiling and striding forward right next to him,\u201d Victor said. \u201cI think it\u2019s this powerful juxtaposition and I hope Mississippi changes their statue (of Davis) soon. But for now, it\u2019s everything we could do to bring somebody like this into the Capitol, change out that corner, and change out that area.\u201d Staring across from Bates, as Victor describes, are statues of Bethune and Rosa Parks. \u201cYou\u2019ve got (figures like) Daisy Bates, Rosa Parks, and Chief Standing Bear (there) because they helped people instead of trying to hurt people,\u201d Victor said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to describe that feeling when (Bates) was installed in the room and the entire change of the room because of it.\u201d CNN\u2019s Katie Bernard, Alex Rogers, Rikki Klaus, Devon M. Sayers, Annie Grayer and Clare Foran contributed to this report.

The four giant pandas housed at Zoo Atlanta, Lun Lun, Yang Yang, Ya Lun and Xi Lun will be sent to China later this year, as the zoo\u2019s agreement with China is set to expire in late 2024, the zoo announced in a\u00a0news release\u00a0Friday. \u201cZoo Atlanta has applied for the\u00a0pandas\u2019 international travel permit, and the bears are expected to travel to China sometime in the fourth quarter of 2024,\u201d the zoo said, noting the exact timing of their return has yet to be determined and \u201cwill be identified collaboratively with official partners in China.\u201d \u201cWhile Zoo Atlanta remains committed to the stewardship and long-term conservation of the species, no discussions have yet taken place with partners in China as to the future of the Zoo\u2019s giant\u00a0panda\u00a0program following the expiration of Zoo Atlanta\u2019s current agreement,\u201d the release added. Zoo Atlanta pointed out its\u00a0panda\u00a0program has been \u201cnotably successful in terms of future contributions to the population of the species,\u201d with seven giant\u00a0pandas born at the zoo since 2006, including two pairs of twins. Lun Lun and Yang Yang are the parents of Ya Lun and Xi Lun. The pair\u2019s other offspring have already been returned to the Chengdu Research Center of Giant Panda Breeding in China. Over the last few years,\u00a0pandas from the San Diego Zoo, Memphis Zoo and Smithsonian National Zoo in Washington, DC were also returned to China. But more pandas are set to arrive in different parts of the United States. In April, it was announced China would send giant\u00a0pandas to live at San Francisco\u2019s zoo for the first time. And the San Diego Zoo announced in February it would receive two giant pandas from China, marking the first time the country has granted new\u00a0panda\u00a0loans in the US in two decades. Pandas have served as something of an unofficial barometer of China-US relations since 1972, when Beijing gifted a pair of the bears to the Smithsonian National Zoo, following US President Richard Nixon\u2019s historic ice-breaking trip to China. Chinese leader Xi Jinping said in 2023 the bamboo-eating bears serve as \u201cenvoys of friendship between the Chinese and American peoples.\u201d Just over 1,800 giant pandas remain in the wild, according to the World Wildlife Fund, which lists the species as vulnerable and describes them as the world\u2019s rarest bear.

{"id": "2024_05_15_us_law-enforcement-detains-protesters-university-of-california-irvine-encampment", "text": "Police detained at least a dozen pro-Palestinian demonstrators at the University of California, Irvine, as they cleared an encampment in front of a lecture hall on Wednesday. \u201cA group of several hundred protestors entered the UC Irvine campus and began surrounding\u201d the school\u2019s Physical Sciences Lecture Hall at\u00a0around 2:30 p.m., the\u00a0university\u00a0said in an emergency update. The\u00a0university\u00a0put out a mutual aid call to local law\u00a0enforcement\u00a0and received assistance from the\u00a0Irvine\u00a0Police Department and Orange County Sheriff\u2019s Department, it said. The protesters moved \u201cin a coordinated fashion \u2026 out of the encampment to the Physical Sciences Lecture Hall, where a small group barricaded themselves in, supported by a large group of community members who had gathered for a scheduled rally,\u201d said Chancellor Howard Gillman in a statement after the police action. \u201cWhat a sad day for our university. I\u2019m brokenhearted,\u201d Gillman said. \u201cAfter weeks when the encampers assured our community that they were committed to maintaining a peaceful and nondisruptive encampment, it was terrible to see that they would dramatically alter the situation in a way that was a direct assault on the rights of other students and the university mission.\u201d Authorities cleared\u00a0what looked like at least half\u00a0of student protesters at\u00a0the encampment, aerial footage from CNN affiliate KABC showed. At least a dozen people were seen being detained in the video. Law enforcement used zip ties to restrain protesters and escorted them\u00a0away from the encampment toward a parking lot. It\u2019s unclear exactly how many people were detained during the incident. CNN has reached out to the Irvine Police Department, the Orange County Sheriff\u2019s Department and UC Irvine to confirm the number of protesters who were detained. Law\u00a0enforcement\u00a0started breaking up the\u00a0encampment\u00a0at\u00a0the\u00a0university shortly after 5:10 p.m. Wednesday, aerials show. The aerial footage shows a large cluster of police officers surrounding the group of tents outside the hall as they face a line of several protesters, and a number of protesters can be seen getting detained. Protesters seemingly attempted to reestablish a barrier\u00a0taken down earlier by law enforcement\u00a0by piling wood panels and tents on top of one another.\u00a0Live pictures from KABC show\u00a0law enforcement\u00a0dismantling these structures. A sign on the building behind the encampment says \u201cUC Divest from genocide\u201d and another under it appears to say \u201cdrop suspensions defend students.\u201d A large sign hung next to those on the building reads \u201cAlex Odeh Hall,\u201d seemingly referencing the Palestinian activist who served as the West Coast regional director of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee. The\u00a0majority of the protesters have dispersed from\u00a0their encampment, but a small group of people remained scattered in a grassy area nearby, footage from KABC and KCAL show. \u201cProtest activity continues in the Physical Science Quad and Aldrich Park areas,\u201d the university said. \u201cPlease avoid the area until further notice.\u201d Classes were canceled for the remainder\u00a0of\u00a0the day Wednesday and the\u00a0university\u00a0urged people to stay away from campus, according to the emergency update. The university initially asked anyone in the area to shelter in place, but later said they should leave the area. Classes will be\u00a0held\u00a0remotely Thursday, the university said in an\u00a0emergency update. Divestment negotiations were ongoing Pro-Palestinian protesters had established an encampment on the campus on April 29. That day, the university called in local law enforcement officials to assist campus police with the protest. Days later, Gillman said in a statement to the campus community that the university would continue to negotiate with pro-Palestinian demonstrators on campus over issues of divestment. Student protesters opposing Israel\u2019s military action in Gaza have largely demanded their universities sell investments in companies with financial ties to Israel. The university presented a proposal to student leaders and received a counterproposal in early May. Gillman expressed concerns over some of the requests included in the counterproposal, according to the statement. \u201cThe counterproposal calls for ending numerous external partnerships that support our students through scholarships and facilitate long-standing research collaborations,\u201d Gillman said. \u201cIt also demands an end to a wide-range of academic and research collaborations with Israeli organizations and individuals. This would violate fundamental principles of academic freedom and would require us to discriminate based on a person\u2019s nationality, which goes against our commitment to anti-discrimination and our principles of diversity, equity, and inclusion.\u201d In the statement, Gillman also thanked student protesters for ensuring that their encampment \u201cremains peaceful and minimally disruptive of university activities.\u201d \u201cAs long as this remains the situation, there is no cause to involve law enforcement, except as needed to help ensure the safety of the protestors and others in the area,\u201d he said at the time. In his Wednesday statement, Gillman said UC Irvine \u201calong with most other UC campuses, received the latest \u2018demands\u2019 from the protesters\u201d earlier that day. The demands \u201cattempted to dictate that anyone who disagreed with them must conform to their opinions,\u201d Gillman said. \u201cBut my concern now is not the unreasonableness of their demands. It is their decision to transform a manageable situation that did not have to involve police into a situation that required a different response,\u201d Gillman said in the statement. Irvine Mayor says protests are \u201cnot a threat\u201d In response to UC Irvine\u2019s law enforcement presence, Irvine Mayor Farrah N. Khan said protesters don\u2019t threaten campus security and shouldn\u2019t be met with violence. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame that peaceful free speech protests are always responded to with violence. Taking space on campus or in a building is not a threat to anyone,\u201d Khan said in a post on X Wednesday. \u201cUCI leadership must do everything they can to avoid creating a violent scenario here. These are your students w/ zero weapons.\u201d The United Auto Workers 4811, which represents 48,000 University of California academic workers, has authorized a strike \u201cif circumstances justify,\u201d citing \u201cnumerous, egregious unfair labor practices committed\u201d during on-campus protests. Specifically, the union mentioned the handling of protests on April 30 and May 1 at the University of California, Los Angeles. The union said in a press release that 19,780 teaching assistants, readers, tutors, student researchers, postdocs and academic researchers at all eleven campuses of the University of California participated in a strike authorization vote, resulting in 79% of participating members voting to authorize the executive board to call a strike if it\u2019s justified. During such a strike, \u201cnot all represented workers are called to go on strike at the same time. Certain campuses may be called to go out on strike at certain times,\u201d the union added. \u201cAt the heart of this is our right to free speech and peaceful protest,\u201d said Rafael Jaime, a graduate worker in the English department and president of UAW 4811.\u00a0\u201cIf members of the academic community are maced and beaten down for peacefully demonstrating on this issue, our ability to speak up on all issues is threatened.\u201d On Friday, the union\u2019s executive board will \u201cevaluate and announce\u201d whether or not they will call on the first campus or campuses to strike, the\u00a0UAW 4811 posted on X.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/us/law-enforcement-detains-protesters-university-of-california-irvine-encampment/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/18/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_05_17_markets_dow-closes-above-40-000", "text": "The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed above the 40,000 mark Friday for the first time in its 139-year history. The blue-chip index initially crossed the key threshold early Thursday but ended that day lower. Wall Street has been boosted in recent days by renewed hopes of rate cuts from the Federal Reserve that would loosen monetary conditions for consumers and businesses. A report this week from the Bureau of Labor Statistics indicated that inflation has started to ease, potentially paving the way for the central bank to start implementing the rate cut that investors have been expecting since the start of the year. \u201c40,000\u00a0is a great milestone, but end of the day there isn\u2019t much difference between 39,999 and 40k,\u201d said Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at Carson Group, in a note Friday. \u201cStill, this is a great reminder of how far we\u2019ve come. Think about how many people were talking about recessions and bear markets all of last year. Now we are once again back to new highs.\u201d \u201cInvestors who were patient and ignored all the scary headlines were once again rewarded, just as they have been throughout history,\u201d he wrote. All major indexes closed the week higher, but markets were mixed on Friday. The Dow rose 134 points, or 0.3%, to close at a record high of 40,003.59. This is the Dow\u2019s fifth consecutive winning week. The S&P 500 gained 0.1% and the Nasdaq Composite closed 0.1% lower. Crossing 40,000 Crossing the 40,000 level\u00a0doesn\u2019t hold much practical value for investors,\u00a0but it does catch the attention of the public and, some argue, it could help propel that optimistic sentiment beyond Wall Street. \u201cThe Dow 40,000 milestone also shows how resilient the US economy has been, at a time where there was a plethora of calls for a recession,\u201d said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Financial, in a recent note to CNN. \u201cThe overarching importance of crossing these big round numbers is that it brings Wall Street news to Main Street, at least for a day. It also serves as an affirmation that corporate earnings are growing, and that investor confidence remains robust,\u201d he said. To many Americans, \u201cthe Dow\u201d simply means the stock market. The index\u2019s small cache of stocks \u2014 ranging from Microsoft to McDonald\u2019s to Chevron \u2014 represents some of the largest companies in the nation and are widely held among retail and institutional investors alike. A look back Here are some important stops along the Dow\u2019s road to 40,000: Dow is formed:\u00a0The first daily close, on May 26, 1896, was 40.94. The Dow did not get off to a good start, plunging 30% to an all-time low of 28.48 by August that year. Dow 100:\u00a0The Dow first closed in triple digits in January 1906. That marked an impressive rally for the average, which had hit an all-time low when Teddy Roosevelt was president. The Federal Reserve would not be created for seven more years. Crash of 1929:\u00a0The Dow fell 38 points on Oct. 28 and 31 more points the next day. That might not sound bad today, but it represented back-to-back declines of 13% and 12% of the Dow\u2019s value. They are still two of the worst one-day percentage declines in the index\u2019s history. Dow 1,000:\u00a0Nov. 14, 1972. Richard Nixon had just won reelection by taking 49 states. The Dow\u2019s components, which had been unchanged for 13 years, included Woolworth, Eastman Kodak and International Nickel. Crash of 1987:\u00a0On Oct. 19, the Dow plunged 508 points, a 23% drop that is still the largest one-day percentage decline in history. A week later it took an 8% plunge. But the damage was short-lived: Within a year, the Dow was back to pre-crash levels. Dow 10,000:\u00a0March 29, 1999. The \u201cirrational exuberance\u201d of the tech bubble was in full swing as the Dow gained 1,000 points in less than a year to hit this benchmark. It gained 1,000 more points in just the next month. A year later, the dot-com stock bubble burst, sending the Dow down nearly 30% by September 2001. Meltdown of 2008-2009:\u00a0The financial crisis caused the Dow to lose about half its value in less than a year, bottoming out to close at 6,547 on March 9, 2009. The worst day was Sept. 29, 2008, when the Dow lost what was then a record 778 points after Congress rejected a $700 billion bank bailout. The bailout was later approved. Dow 15,000:\u00a0May 7, 2013. As the economy continued to recover from the Great Recession, the Dow had one of the current bull market\u2019s strongest periods. It crossed the 15,000 mark and finished the year up 26.5%, marking the best full-year performance of the current bull market. The Dow nearly matched that in 2017, rising 25%. Dow 20,000:\u00a0January 25, 2017. The stock market had enjoyed a nice run starting on the day after the 2016 election, with the Dow gaining nearly 10% as investors looked forward to lower taxes and less regulation under the Trump administration. Dow 25,000:\u00a0Jan. 4, 2018. The passage of the Trump tax cuts, especially the lowering of the corporate tax rate in December 2017, helped feed the quick move between 20,000 and 25,000. Dow 30,000:\u00a0Nov. 24, 2020: Covid sent the stock market plunging in the spring of 2020.

William Lawson, a long-time civil rights advocate and founder of Wheeler Avenue Baptist Church in Houston, has died, according to an obituary posted on the church\u2019s website.\u00a0He was 95. Lawson\u00a0was known as \u201cHouston\u2019s Pastor;\u201d a\u00a0trusted voice in the community who\u00a0ushered the city through\u00a0times of crisis and change. In 1962, he\u00a0founded\u00a0the Wheeler Avenue Baptist Church where he was the pastor for more than 40 years. He later joined the\u00a0civil rights movement led by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.,\u00a0whom he considered to be a close friend, the church\u2019s obituary stated. Lawson also set up a local chapter of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), a civil rights organization that was instrumental during the civil rights movement. \u201cLawson, in particular, was known to help build bridges between the powerful and the powerless, as a champion of social justice and community service,\u201d\u00a0the\u00a0church posted. Houston Mayor John Whitmire\u00a0held\u00a0a moment of silence at\u00a0Houston City Hall on Tuesday\u00a0to honor Lawson.\u00a0He encouraged\u00a0Houstonians to \u201cstrive for a fair, safe, and equal Houston in his honor and memory.\u201d \u201cHe is one of the reasons our city is so great,\u201d Whitmire said. \u201cHe helped us during civil rights and social justice like probably no other individual in the country because Houston benefited from his leadership and character.\u201d \u201cI, like so many Houstonians, I am deeply saddened by the passing of Rev. William Lawson-a Houstonian icon and pillar of our community,\u201d Democratic Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee said in a\u00a0post\u00a0on X. In a statement to CNN,\u00a0Harris County Commissioner Rodney Ellis\u00a0called Lawson a \u201ctowering figure in our community.\u201d \u201cHe was a pioneering force in the Civil Rights movement, courageously hosting the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. at his church and supporting the brave Texas Southern University students during the sit-ins that spurred integration in our city. His commitment to justice and equality knew no bounds.\u201d Ellis\u00a0also noted that the city\u00a0recently named a park in honor of Rev. Lawson and his late wife. \u201cThe Reverend William and Audrey Lawson Park will serve as a lasting tribute to their shared commitment to uplifting every member of our community,\u201d the statement read. In 2021,\u00a0Rice University honored\u00a0the longtime pastor\u00a0by naming part of its campus \u201cThe Reverend William A. Lawson Grove.\u201d \u201cIf there\u2019s anything that I\u2019d like for my legacy to be, it is for the different cultures of humankind to get to know each other, to respect each other and, if possible, to love each other,\u201d\u00a0Lawson said at the\u00a0unveiling. His daughter,\u00a0Melanie Lawson, an anchor\u00a0with ABC13\u00a0in Houston, was by his side at the ceremony. \u201cWhen it\u2019s your Dad,\u00a0you don\u2019t really think how special they are. It\u2019s only through the vision of other people that you realize what a difference he made,\u201d\u00a0she said at the event. Rice University President Reginald DesRoches said Rev. Lawson\u2019s legacy will resonate through generations. \u201cMay future generations be reminded of his enduring impact as a beacon in the civil rights movement every time they walk through the grove named in his honor on the Rice campus,\u201d\u00a0President DesRoches said on the school\u2019s\u00a0remembrance\u00a0page.

{"id": "2024_05_16_us_loay-alnaji-paul-kessler-death-will-stand-trial", "text": "A man charged with manslaughter in the death of a Jewish protester he\u2019s accused of striking during dueling demonstrations over the Israel-Hamas war last year will stand trial, a judge ruled Wednesday, according to prosecutors. Prosecutors allege Loay Alnaji hit the 69-year-old protester, Paul Kessler, with a megaphone before Kessler fell and struck his head on the pavement of a street corner in Thousand Oaks, California, in November, the Ventura County District Attorney\u2019s Office said in a release. Kessler, who was demonstrating in support of Israel, later died at a hospital. Medical examiners determined he died from blunt force trauma caused by the blow from the megaphone and his fall, prosecutors said. Alnaji is facing involuntary manslaughter and battery charges after an investigation police say was complicated by conflicting statements from pro-Israel and pro-Palestinian witnesses. He has pleaded not guilty, the district attorney\u2019s office said last year. The tense confrontation happened during one of many protests sweeping US cities in the weeks after Hamas attacked Israel on October 7, killing an estimated 1,200 people and kidnapping about 200 others. Israel\u2019s ongoing military response in Gaza has so far killed more than 35,000 Palestinians, according to the Ministry of Health in\u00a0Gaza, and is fueling a worsening humanitarian crisis. During a two-day hearing, prosecutors presented evidence against Alnaji, including DNA analysis of blood on the megaphone, which matches Kessler, and video and audio taken on Kessler\u2019s phone in the moments leading to his fall, the district attorney\u2019s office said. Prosecutors have yet to find evidence to indicate Alnaji committed a hate crime, the release said. \u201cWhile antisemitic hate speech was heard at the November 5, 2023, rally, there is no evidence those words were said by\u00a0Alnaji,\u201d the release said. Alnaji\u2019s attorney, Ron Bamieh, told CNN his client was acting in self-defense during an altercation with the victim and said witness accounts of the incident have been \u201cinconsistent or inaccurate.\u201d \u201cThis case is a simple question of whether or not my client had the right to swat Mr.\u00a0Kessler\u2019s phone away, and as a result, hit him in the face in self-defense,\u201d Bamieh said. In November, Bamieh told CNN Kessler stuck his phone in Alnaji\u2019s face and he \u201cbrushed\u201d it away. \u201cWhen (Kessler) fell, my client is seen on the video 6 to 8 feet away from him,\u201d he added. The attorney said previously Alnaji \u201cfully cooperated with law enforcement, attempted to aid Mr. Kessler when he fell, and called 911 when he realized that Mr. Kessler was injured.\u201d While Bamieh concedes Alnaji struck the victim during the heated confrontation, he argued prosecutors were \u201caggressive\u201d in filing the case the way they did. \u201cThe prosecution is treating this as more of a publicity case and a political case than an actual criminal case.\u201d A spokesperson for the district attorney\u2019s office, Joey Buttitta, told CNN, \u201cWe pursue truth and justice based on the facts and the evidence, not politics and publicity.\u201d After he was charged, Alnaji was placed on administrative leave from his job in the Ventura County Community College District, which includes three colleges, the district said at the time. He worked at Moorpark College,\u00a0The Los Angeles Times\u00a0reported. Alnaji\u00a0is out on $50,000 bail and is scheduled for an arraignment on June 10, the district attorney\u2019s office said. He faces a maximum of four years in prison if convicted. What investigators said happened at the dueling rallies The incident took place while simultaneous rallies were being\u00a0held by two groups\u00a0identified as \u201cFreedom for Palestine\u201d and \u201cWe are Pro-Israel,\u201d according to the Ventura County Sheriff\u2019s Office. Authorities estimated between 75 and 100 people were present. Around 3:20 p.m. on November 5, the sheriff\u2019s office received multiple calls about a possible assault related to the protests at an intersection, Sheriff Jim Fryhoff has said. When deputies and medical responders arrived at the scene minutes later, they found Kessler lying on the ground, conscious and responsive, the sheriff said. Investigators determined a pro-Palestinian protester, later identified as Alnaji, had been involved in an altercation with Kessler, who at some point fell backward and hit his head on the ground, authorities said. Pro-Israel and pro-Palestinian witnesses at the scene gave contradicting accounts of who the aggressor was and how the altercation occurred, the sheriff said. A 50-year-old suspect was also interviewed at the scene, where he told deputies he had been involved in an altercation with Kessler, Fryhoff said. His home was searched by investigators the next day, the sheriff said. Authorities did not say at the time whether that suspect was Alnaji. Kessler was hospitalized in critical condition before dying from his injuries. In addition to determining his cause of death to be blunt force trauma, an autopsy revealed Kessler suffered injuries consistent with a fall, including skull fractures, brain swelling and bruising, and nonlethal injuries to his face, according to Dr. Christopher Young, Ventura County\u2019s chief medical examiner. The district attorney described Kessler as a father of one who had been married for 43 years. He worked in medical sales for \u201ca number of decades\u201d and also taught sales and marketing.

{"id": "2024_05_16_us_university-of-washington-protests-antisemitic-graffiti", "text": "Pro-Palestinian encampments have been cleared from more US college campuses as school officials have called in law enforcement in recent weeks to quell mounting demonstrations\u00a0over the institutions\u2019 ties to Israel amid its\u00a0military action in Gaza. Here are the latest developments: Arts and sciences faculty at Columbia University have passed a vote of no confidence in the Ivy League school\u2019s president, Minouche Shafik, who has been under intense scrutiny for her handling of campus protests over the Israel-Hamas war and her congressional testimony on the subject. Sixty-five percent of participants said they had no confidence in Shafik, a spokesperson for the New York university confirmed to CNN on Thursday, adding some 900 of its 4,600 full-time faculty voted. Among their concerns were that Shafik\u2019s leadership had \u201cnot only endangered our students; more broadly, it represents a serious threat to the core values of the university: academic freedom, shared governance, freedom of expression, and the right to peaceful assembly,\u201d the Barnard College and Columbia University Chapters of the American Association of University Professors said in a Thursday news release. Shafik \u201ccontinues to consult regularly with members of the community, including faculty, administration, and trustees, as well as with state, city, and community leaders,\u201d Columbia spokesperson Ben Chang said in a statement. Shafik a day earlier sent a message to graduates \u2013 after their university-wide commencement ceremony was canceled following weeks of Gaza war protests \u2013 wishing \u201cthat the challenges you faced during this difficult era will inspire you and make you stronger.\u201d \u201cI know that the last few weeks have been very difficult,\u00a0and\u00a0I am sorry that we were unable to celebrate your commencement in the traditional manner,\u201d she said in her message. Columbia cited security concerns in canceling the large event, a school official told CNN, and instead is holding smaller ones. Acknowledging \u201can extraordinary and tragic set of events\u201d in the Middle East and that \u201cas a great\u00a0university, we must engage with these issues,\u201d the polarization\u00a0at Columbia has caused conflict\u00a0on\u00a0campus, Shafik said. \u201cCanceling the traditional\u00a0commencement\u00a0ceremony was\u00a0one of the toughest calls in a year of many tough calls,\u201d Shafik wrote in an op-ed in the\u00a0Columbia\u00a0Daily Spectator, noting her top priority has been the safety of students, faculty and staff. \u201cThe conflict between the rights of pro-Palestinian protesters and the impact that their protests have had\u00a0on\u00a0some members of our Jewish community is what makes this moment singularly fraught,\u201d she said. UC Irvine returns to in-person classes after nearly 50 protesters detained: The University of California, Irvine, will resume in-person instruction and campus operations will return to normal on Friday, according to a school spokesperson. Classes went remote Thursday after law enforcement personnel used zip ties to restrain demonstrators the prior evening at the university before escorting them\u00a0away from a pro-Palestinian protest encampment and toward a parking lot. University spokesperson Tom Vasich said 47 people were arrested, including 26 students, two employees and 19 other individuals. Those who were arrested were taken to the Orange County Jail, where booking and processing were completed. \u201cThey were then released on citation,\u201d Vasich said. Vasich had earlier told CNN 50 people were arrested, but revised the number to 47 later Thursday. Most of those taken into custody were cited for failure to disperse after a direct police order and a few were arrested for trespassing, Vasich said, adding a full breakdown of how many of those arrested are students or faculty is expected to be released later on Thursday. \u201cA group of several hundred protestors entered the UC Irvine campus and began surrounding\u201d the school\u2019s Physical Sciences Lecture Hall at\u00a0around 2:30 p.m., Wednesday, the school said in an emergency update. The\u00a0university\u00a0put out a mutual aid call to local law\u00a0enforcement\u00a0and got help from the\u00a0Irvine\u00a0Police Department and Orange County Sheriff\u2019s Department, it said. Authorities cleared\u00a0what looked like at least half\u00a0of student protesters at\u00a0the encampment, aerial footage from\u00a0CNN affiliate KABC\u00a0showed. Pro-Palestinian protesters had set up a campus encampment on April 29, when the university also\u00a0called in\u00a0local law enforcement. Days later, the school\u2019s chancellor said the university would continue to negotiate with student protesters demanding their university cut financial ties to Israel over the nation\u2019s military action in Gaza. UC Berkeley Pro-Palestinian protesters arrested after occupying building: Law enforcement arrested at least 12 people Thursday evening as they cleared a condemned building at the University of California, Berkeley, that was being occupied by pro-Palestinian protesters, school spokesperson Dan Mogulof told CNN. Protesters broke into the university\u2019s Anna Head complex with sticks and bolt cutters on Wednesday, where they broke windows and spray-painted walls, police said. The university on Thursday estimated about 60 people were in the building and said the occupation was \u201cnot nonviolent civil disobedience.\u201d The protesters were arrested on suspicion of destruction of property, breaking and entering and trespassing, according to Mogulof. During the occupation, a Palestinian flag hung from the building, where protesters had set up tents, footage from CNN affiliate KGO shows. Images from the Jewish Community Relations Council\u00a0Bay Area show the building\u2019s interior walls covered in what the group called \u201cantisemitic graffiti,\u201d reading, \u201cZionism is Nazism\u201d and \u201cMartyrs never die.\u201d \u201cThe Star of David, the most recognizable symbol in Judaism, is seen equated with a swastika,\u201d the council said Wednesday in an X post. \u201cThis is not protest, this is pure hate.\u201d The building\u2019s takeover came a day after the UCB Divest Coalition\u00a0agreed to end its campus encampment following discussions with university leadership. The coalition did not initiate the break-in at the Anna Head complex, Mogulof said. UC Berkeley\u2019s chancellor was relieved to bring the encampment protests to a peaceful end, noting the school\u2019s leadership does not support full divestment from Israel at this time, she said. \u201cThe sale of direct investments is not within the authority of the Office of the Chancellor but rather lies with the UC Regents,\u201d Carol Christ wrote Tuesday in a letter\u00a0to the Free Palestine Encampment. If all divestment demands by students were met, the University of California system would have to sell $32 billion of its $175 billion portfolio, UC\u2019s Chief Investment Officer Jagdeep Singh Bachher said Tuesday during an Investments Committee meeting held as part of this week\u2019s monthly UC Board of Regents meeting at its Merced campus. University of Washington president calls for encampment break-up as antisemitic graffiti found on campus: After\u00a0protests escalated at the University of\u00a0Washington\u00a0\u2013 with \u201coffensive\u00a0graffiti\u00a0across multiple\u00a0buildings\u00a0all\u00a0over\u00a0campus, some quite clearly both antisemitic\u00a0and\u00a0violent\u201d \u2013 the school\u2019s president is calling again for the voluntary dismantling\u00a0of\u00a0a pro-Palestinian encampment on\u00a0the Seattle campus. Students and faculty on Wednesday discovered the graffiti, which has \u201ccreat(ed) an unwelcome\u00a0and fearful environment for many students, faculty\u00a0and staff, especially those who are Jewish,\u201d President Ana Mari Cauce said later that day in a statement, calling the situation \u201cuntenable.\u201d Cauce asked for the tent camp to break up, echoing her entreaty last week to demonstrators \u201cto dismantle the encampment\u00a0voluntarily for everyone\u2019s safety.\u201d \u201cMuch to my dismay, given the relatively cordial tone\u00a0of\u00a0many\u00a0of\u00a0our discussions, the representatives also said the new\u00a0graffiti\u00a0is an intentional escalation to compel the\u00a0University\u00a0to agree to their demands,\u201d she said Wednesday, adding university officials \u201chave engaged sincerely\u00a0and\u00a0openly.\u201d Among protesters\u2019 \u201cescalating demands\u201d is \u201ca new department that would have an \u2018anti-Zionist\u2019 litmus test for faculty hiring,\u201d Cauce said in the statement. \u201cMany\u00a0of\u00a0these demands, especially the most recent, are contrary to academic freedom\u00a0and/or to state or federal law.\u201d \u201cWhile I strongly support free speech\u00a0and\u00a0peaceful\u00a0protest, I also strongly support the rights\u00a0of\u00a0all\u00a0our community members to live, learn\u00a0and\u00a0work without fear,\u201d she\u00a0said. \u201cThe\u00a0University\u2019s response to students\u2019\u00a0calls\u00a0for change will not be based on an encampment.\u201d DePaul\u00a0University protest\u00a0encampment removed by police: Police in riot gear moved protesters away and dismantled tents Thursday morning at a pro-Palestinian protest encampment at DePaul University in Chicago, video from\u00a0CNN affiliate WLS\u00a0shows.  Two protesters accused of blocking nearby traffic were arrested, school spokesperson Russell Dorn told CNN, adding no arrests were made in the campus quad. The decision to dismantle the encampment came after \u201cgood faith efforts\u201d to negotiate with organizers, DePaul President Robert Manuel said. \u201cFrom the beginning of the\u00a0encampment, I have said that\u00a0we would protect free speech and the ability to dissent until it either prevented us from carrying out the operations of our university or threatened the safety of the members of our community,\u201d Manuel\u00a0said\u00a0in an open letter to students and employees. \u201cI am deeply saddened to say the encampment has crossed that\u00a0line.\u201d University buildings have been vandalized with graffiti, and the cost to repair the physical damage to the quad, which will be \u201cclosed to everyone\u201d until further notice, appears to be nearly $180,000, Manuel said in his letter. The DePaul Divestment Coalition \u2013 a multiethnic, multifaith student group \u2013 has been calling on DePaul to \u201cdivest from killing and harm abroad\u201d since its encampment was set up April 30. \u201cDePaul\u2019s administration chose to use violence to disperse the encampment and unilaterally withdrew from negotiations,\u201d Benjamin Meyer, an attorney representing the coalition said. \u201cThe students sent administration a calendar invite for a meeting on Monday, in which none of the administrators attended.\u201d Morehouse College could stop graduation if Biden\u2019s speech is disrupted: Morehouse College\u2019s president has vowed to combat any disruptive behavior during President Joe Biden\u2019s scheduled graduation speech Sunday at the preeminent historically Black institution by shutting down commencement \u201con the spot.\u201d \u201cSo, for example, prolonged shouting down of the president as he speaks,\u201d Morehouse College President David A. Thomas told CNN\u2019s Victor Blackwell on Thursday.\u00a0\u201cI have also made a decision that we will also not ask police to take individuals out of commencement in zip ties. \u201cIf faced with the choice, I will cease the ceremonies on the spot if we were to reach that position.\u201d Biden\u2019s visit to the Atlanta campus approaches as he seeks to convince young voters to send him to the White House for another term, even as many have expressed frustration for his administration\u2019s continued support of Israel\u2019s military campaign in Gaza.

Astronomers say it\u2019s the second-lightest planet ever found and will be key to research investigating atypical planetary formation. Here\u2019s what else you need to know to\u00a0Get Up to Speed and On with Your Day. 1. Trump trial Former President Donald Trump\u2019s lawyer spent hours Thursday tediously moving through inconsistent statements that Michael Cohen has made over the years to knock his credibility. Cohen is the prosecution\u2019s key witness in Trump\u2019s criminal hush money trial, which centers on allegations that Trump broke the law by falsifying business records to conceal a hush money payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels before the 2016 election. In the heated questioning, Trump\u2019s attorney cast doubt on Cohen\u2019s memory of interactions with Trump in 2016 and portrayed him as a liar out for revenge. Court is off today so Trump can attend the high school graduation of his son, Barron. But summations may begin Tuesday \u2014 meaning the jury could have the case as early as next week. 2. Southern storms A dangerous, life-threatening storm system is unfolding in the South as torrential rain pummels Texas and Louisiana. The storms have killed at least four people in Houston and left more than 1 million homes and businesses without power, officials said. The wind was so strong Thursday that it blew out the windows of buildings in downtown Houston, littering the area with glass as traffic lights went dark. Forecasts show the storms will shift east today and target more of the Gulf Coast with heavy downpours. Around 14 million people are at risk of severe weather in the region, with swaths of Mississippi and Alabama under the moderate, Level 3 of 4, risk of excessive rainfall. 3. Middle East Trucks carrying humanitarian aid into Gaza are now moving ashore after arriving through the floating pier built by the US military. The pier was anchored to a beach in Gaza on Thursday and will be used to funnel aid from various countries into the besieged enclave as all other border crossings remain closed. Also on Thursday, the US House voted to prevent President Joe Biden from withholding weapons to Israel as Republicans criticize his handling of the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. The bill is unlikely to be taken up in the Democratic-led Senate and the White House has said that Biden would veto the bill if Congress passed it. 4. Immigration The Department of Homeland Security and the Justice Department have announced new plans targeting migrants who have unlawfully crossed the US southern border. Some migrants will be placed on a new court docket and will have their cases resolved within 180 days \u2014 cutting the process down by months if not years. The docket applies to single adults who are released from government custody and headed to one of five destination cities: Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles and New York City. This comes as the immigration court backlog exceeds 3 million pending cases, according to an analysis of immigration court data. 5. Marijuana The Biden administration on Thursday took another step toward reclassifying marijuana as a lower-risk substance, opening a 60-day public comment period in a step the president deemed \u201cmonumental.\u201d In April, the Justice Department proposed that marijuana be rescheduled as a Schedule III controlled substance, a classification shared by prescription drugs such as ketamine and Tylenol with codeine. The final step will follow in the coming months when the Justice Department makes a final scheduling determination. While the process is lengthy, Biden\u2019s aides believe that placing the drug in a more appropriate category could bolster his appeal among young voters.

{"id": "2024_05_16_us_angelo-quinto-death-police-antioch-settlement", "text": "A Northern California city has agreed to pay $7.5 million to the family of a 30-year-old man who died days after police restrained him in 2020, the parties announced Wednesday, settling a wrongful death claim that the family filed. Angelo Quinto\u2019s family filed the claim against the city of Antioch in February 2021, alleging he was undergoing a mental health episode and died days after police officers kneeled on the back of his neck for nearly five minutes to subdue him. A year later, the\u00a0Contra Costa County District Attorney\u2019s office said\u00a0an internal examination determined Quinto\u2019s neck area had no damage; that it saw \u201cno evidence of criminal offense by Antioch police officers\u201d in Quinto\u2019s death; and that the officers had \u201cengaged with Quinto in a manner that was lawful and objectively reasonable under the circumstances.\u201d \u201cWhile there are conflicting medical opinions as to the cause of death, the accounts of what transpired in the bedroom are consistent among all witnesses in that no police officer applied pressure to Quinto\u2019s neck,\u201d the district attorney\u2019s office said in 2022. Police restrained Quinto at the family\u2019s home in Antioch on December 23, 2020, after his sister called police because he had a mental health episode and she feared he would hurt their mother, the family\u2019s attorneys had said. Quinto lost consciousness, and was taken to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead three days later, the family attorneys said in the claim. Quinto\u2019s cause of death \u201cwas Excited Delirium Syndrome due to drug intoxication, psychiatric conditions, physical exertion, and cardiac arrest,\u201d\u00a0an autopsy\u00a0performed five days after Quinto was restrained by the officers found, the district attorney\u2019s office said in 2022. On Wednesday,\u00a0an attorney for Quinto\u2019s family, Ben Nisenbaum, said that Quinto\u2019s family was the \u201cmoving force\u201d behind\u00a0legislation\u00a0eventually signed by Gov. Gavin Newsom banning excited delirium and other similar terms to be listed as cause of death in California. He said a coroner inquest listed excited delirium \u2013 which is \u201ccharacterized by agitation, aggression, acute distress and sudden death,\u201d\u00a0according to\u00a0the National Library of Medicine \u2013 as Quinto\u2019s cause of death. John L. Burris,\u00a0another lawyer for the family, said the settlement shows something positive can come out of a tragedy. \u201cThis is a case where the family, from day one, took the tragedy and the loss and the circumstances surrounding Angelo\u2019s death and tried to turn it into a positive good, and they did so,\u201d Burris said. \u201cThe real plus that comes from this case is the collective efforts on their part, and the willingness on the part of the city officials, including the mayor\u2019s office \u2026 to bring about a positive change,\u201d Burris said. Antioch Mayor Lamar Hernandez-Thorpe said that while two people died in police custody during the first 30 days of his administration, he \u201cwas left with the impression that this wasn\u2019t a big deal.\u201d \u201c$7.5 million later \u2013 and that\u2019s never enough to make up for somebody\u2019s loved\u00a0one \u2013 we recognized that it was a bigger issue than what we understood,\u201d the mayor said at Wednesday\u2019s news conference, adding that the city council had previously fought against body-worn cameras for police officers. \u201cYears of, frankly, failed leadership brought us to this moment, but I am happy to say that we\u2019ve done an enormous job in terms of changing the culture, not just at the police department, but at the city as well, and taking these concerns serious,\u201d the mayor said. \u201cWe\u2019ve done a lot in terms of establishing reforms that I think build a safer community for every single segment of our city and to ensure that people do have justice when we are wrong.\u201d During the news conference, Quinto\u2019s stepfather, Robert Collins, thanked the mayor and the city council for listening to his family\u2019s calls for change. \u201cWe found a city that has listened to a lot of our pleas and has begun to make the necessary changes that we need to have,\u201d Collins said. \u201cIt\u2019s a process of change. We\u2019re not done here. It\u2019s a process that will take many years.\u201d Thanks to the family\u2019s claim, police body cameras \u201care now a reality in Antioch,\u201d and a non-police mental health response team \u201chas prevented other people from dying,\u201d Collins said. Quinto\u2019s sister,\u00a0Isabella Collins,\u00a0described her brother as \u201cmultifaceted.\u201d He was artistic, loved to cook and was always trying to better himself, she said. \u201cThis is some semblance of justice that we\u2019ve been able to work toward positive reforms and positive change \u2013 legislative and advocacy change,\u201d\u00a0Isabella Collins said. \u201cI think that if my brother couldn\u2019t have life, that perhaps this is what he would choose, this impact on other people\u2019s lives and other people\u2019s legacies, the ability to pave the way toward some justice and justice for others.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/16/us/angelo-quinto-death-police-antioch-settlement/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/18/2024", "section": "us"}}

Minor was charged with murder and aggravated assault after shooting his Lyft driver, a release from the Union City Police Department said. The Lyft driver was identified by authorities as Reginald Folks and was pronounced dead at the scene.

Minor recounted to police he had gotten in the Lyft after leaving another police officer\u2019s home that evening. He told officers Folks was talking on the phone through his car\u2019s Bluetooth in an unknown language and Minor said he \u201cheard what he thought was another voice in his ear talking to him but did not say what the voice said.\u201d Minor told police he then asked Folks to stop the car but he continued to drive. When they came to a red light, Minor tried to unlock and open the door but he could not get the door open. He then added Folks turned around and attempted to reach in the back seat, which is when Minor shot him. He fired approximately three shots, broke the window of the vehicle, and exited. Minor is being held in Fulton County Jail. CNN has been unable to determine if Minor has obtained legal representation. The Atlanta Police Department hired Minor in 2018 and was on unpaid administrative leave during the time of his arrest this week, the department statement said.

{"id": "2024_05_16_us_daniel-perry-texas-pardon-recommendation", "text": "Daniel Perry, a former US Army sergeant who was convicted of murdering a protester at a Black Lives Matter rally in 2020, was released from prison Thursday after he was pardoned by Texas Gov. Greg Abbott. Abbott\u2019s decision comes after the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles voted unanimously Thursday to recommend a full pardon and the restoration of firearm rights for Perry, who was sentenced last year to 25 years in prison. Shortly after he was pardoned, Perry was released from Texas Department of Criminal Justice custody, a spokesperson for the agency told CNN. Abbott asked the board to conduct an investigation in April 2023, and in a statement on Thursday, the board said its \u201cinvestigative efforts encompassed a meticulous review of pertinent documents, from police reports to court records, witness statements, and interviews with individuals linked to the case.\u201d Perry faced between five and 99 years in prison for fatally shooting 28-year-old Air Force veteran Garrett Foster at an Austin, Texas, racial justice rally two months after the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Shortly after Perry\u2019s conviction in April 2023, Abbott said he wanted to pardon Perry and issued an unusual request for the state Board of Pardons and Paroles to expedite a review of the case before a sentence was handed down. \u201cAmong the voluminous files reviewed by the Board, they considered information provided by the Travis County District Attorney, the full investigative report on Daniel Perry, plus a review of all the testimony provided at trial,\u201d Abbott said in a statement. \u201cTexas has one of the strongest \u2018Stand Your Ground\u2019 laws of self-defense that cannot be nullified by a jury or a progressive District Attorney. I thank the Board for its thorough investigation, and I approve their pardon recommendation,\u201d Abbott said. The governor can only pardon Perry if the Board of Pardons and Paroles recommends it, according to Texas law. Foster\u2019s mother, Sheila Foster, said she learned of the pardon from a social media post by the governor and couldn\u2019t believe it. \ufeff\u201cEverything that has happened is wrong on so many levels, and I don\u2019t understand why,\u201d Sheila Foster told CNN\u2019s Laura Coates Thursday. \u201cIt is so crystal clear to me that this man needs to be in prison for the rest of his life \u2013 not a mere 25 years. Why he wouldn\u2019t even have to serve a year? I don\u2019t understand.\u201d Doug O\u2019Connell, an attorney for Perry, said in a statement his client is \u201cthrilled\u201d to be free and thanked Abbott and the Texas Board of Pardons and Parole. \u201cI spoke with Daniel this afternoon. He is thrilled and elated to be free. Daniel is also optimistic for his future,\u201d O\u2019Connell said in a statement obtained by CNN. \u201cHe wishes that this tragic event never happened and wishes he never had to defend himself against Mr. Foster\u2019s unlawful actions. At the same time, Daniel recognizes that the Foster family is grieving.\u00a0We are anxious to see Daniel reunited with his family and loved ones.\u201d Prosecutors said Perry, who was stationed at Fort Hood, initiated the fatal encounter when he ran a red light and drove his vehicle into a crowd gathered at the protest. Foster was openly carrying an assault-style rifle \u2013 legal in Texas \u2013 and approached Perry\u2019s car and motioned for him to lower his window, at which point Perry fatally shot him with a handgun, prosecutors said. \u201cToday, a convicted murderer will walk the streets of Texas. Texas Republicans have once again proven that they cannot keep the public safe, they are not the party of \u2018tough on crime,\u2019 and they are not the party of \u2018law and order,\u2019\u201d Texas Democratic Party Chair Gilberto Hinojosa said in a statement responding to the pardon. He added: \u201cMake no mistake: Daniel Perry is a murderer who was on a mission to commit violence against Texans, and today our justice system was hijacked for political gain.\u201d In a statement on Thursday, Foster\u2019s former fianc\u00e9e, Whitney Mitchell, said she is \u201cheartbroken by this lawlessness,\u201d adding Abbott has shown that \u201conly certain lives matter.\u201d \u201cHe has made us all less safe. Daniel Perry texted his friends about plans to murder a protestor he disagreed with,\u201d she said. \u201cAfter a lengthy trial, with an abundance of evidence, 12 impartial Texans determined he that he carried out that plan, and murdered the love of my life.\u201d \u201cWith this pardon, the Governor has desecrated the life of a murdered Texan, impugned that jury\u2019s just verdict, and declared that citizens can be killed with impunity as long as they hold political views that are different from those in power,\u201d Mitchell said. During Perry\u2019s sentencing hearing last May, the prosecution asked that he be sentenced to at least 25 years in prison. They highlighted a stream of racist and inflammatory social media posts Perry wrote prior to the shooting and the defense\u2019s own analysis of his mental disorders and mindset. \u201cThis man is a loaded gun ready to go off on any perceived threat that he thinks he has to address in his black and white world and his us versus them mentality,\u201d a prosecutor said. Perry\u2019s defense team asked for a sentence of 10 years, citing his lack of criminal history, his psychological issues, including complex post-traumatic stress disorder, and praise from several of his military colleagues. They argued his actions were\u00a0justified as self-defense. Perry told police during an interview that he believed Foster was going to aim the firearm at him, according to\u00a0CNN affiliate KEYE. Foster\u2019s mother was \u201cin shock\u201d after learning of Abbott\u2019s pardon, according to Quentin Brogdon, the family\u2019s former attorney who spoke with the mother on Thursday. \u201cTo say that she is devastated is an understatement,\u201d\u00a0Brogdon\u00a0told CNN in a phone interview. The family had pursued a civil case against Perry\u00a0but dropped the case after he was convicted last year, satisfied with the jury \u201cholding him accountable,\u201d Brogdon said, adding the family will be considering any possible legal avenues but the prospects are \u201cgrim.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s hard to believe that the issuance of this pardon does not have some kind of political motivation,\u201d Brogdon said, citing Abbott\u2019s involvement in the case after conservative commentators criticized Perry\u2019s conviction last year. Perry diagnosed with complex PTSD and autism For the defense, Greg Hupp, a forensic psychologist who examined Perry twice in 2023, testified during his sentencing he diagnosed him with complex post-traumatic stress disorder and autism spectrum disorder. Combined with his military experience, Perry had an \u201cus versus them\u201d mentality in which his mindset was, \u201cI protect myself. I am ready for any imminent attack and anything out there can be a potential threat,\u201d Hupp said. On cross-examination, the prosecution noted that military records did not indicate either of these psychological issues. During Perry\u2019s sentencing, Mitchell testified through tears how her life had changed since his death. Mitchell is a quadruple amputee and said Foster had been her sole caretaker for the past 11 years, helping her get ready for the day, eat and work as a costume designer. They had bought a house in Austin together, and she said it\u2019s difficult to stay there without him. \u201cIt\u2019s hard every day that I\u2019m there. It\u2019s hard to sleep in my bed because he\u2019s not there,\u201d she said. \u201cHe was my main caregiver for 11 years and I\u2019ve had friends who have been taking care of me and have to learn how to do all that stuff that Garrett was doing for me for a decade, and it\u2019s hard because I had to get comfortable being vulnerable.\u201d Perry made comments on social media about killing protesters, documents show Documents related to the case that were unsealed by a Travis County judge following Perry\u2019s conviction show he had a yearslong history of making racist comments in messages and social media posts. In a Facebook message from May 2020, just weeks before the shooting, Perry told a friend he \u201cmight have to kill a few people\u201d who were rioting outside his apartment. The documents also contain a May 2020 text sent by Perry that said, \u201cI might go to Dallas to shoot looters.\u201d Some messages included \u201cwhite power\u201d memes. Perry wrote in a 2019 message that it was \u201cto bad we can\u2019t get paid for hunting Muslims in Europe.\u201d In a June 1, 2020, social media comment, Perry compared the Black Lives Matter movement to \u201ca zoo full of monkeys that are freaking out flinging their sh*t,\u201d the documents show. Clint Broden, Perry\u2019s attorney, criticized the release of the documents in a statement to CNN, calling it a political decision by prosecutors.

Years later, he says he heard his voice narrating a YouTube video and then on a podcast \u2014 even though he had never recorded either of them. Now, Lehrman, along with fellow voice actor Linnea Sage, is suing AI firm Lovo for allegedly commissioning them for voice projects under false pretenses in order to create and sell AI-generated versions of their voices. The Berkeley, California based tech company advertises AI-generated voice technology to be used in marketing, education and product demos. Lehrman and Sage are suing Lovo and seeking class action status to include other people \u201cwhose voices and/or identities were stolen and used,\u201d according to the complaint filed Thursday in the Southern District Court of New York. The complaint was first reported by the New York Times. The voice actors\u2019 lawsuit is just the latest in a recent string of legal actions brought against various tech companies by creatives, writers and artists who say their work was used without their permission to train AI systems that could ultimately compete with them. Such lawsuits have added to a growing wave of concerns over how the training of AI models, which requires huge swaths of data, could run afoul of copyright and intellectual property laws. \u201cImplicit in LOVO\u2019s offerings to its customers is that each voice-over actor has agreed to LOVO\u2019s terms and conditions for customers to be able to access that actor\u2019s voice,\u201d the complaint states. But for Lehrman and Sage and any others \u201cwho have not agreed to LOVO\u2019s terms, the continued unauthorized use of Plaintiffs\u2019 voices is theft of service and misappropriation.\u201d Lovo did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the lawsuit. In May 2020, Lehrman says he received a request for voice-over narrative services on the gig work website Fiverr from an account called \u201cUser25199087.\u201d When he asked what the voice sample was for, he was told it would be used \u201cfor academic research purposes only\u201d and that \u201cthe scripts would not be used for anything else,\u201d according to the complaint. He was paid $1,200 for the job, the complaint states. Two years later, Lehrman came across a YouTube video that sounded as if it had his voice narrating it, although he\u2019d never been involved in its creation, the complaint states. Then in June 2023, Lehrman claims he heard his voice being used on a podcast about the dangers of AI technologies. Similarly, Sage was offered a job on Fiverr in 2019 producing \u201ctest scripts for radio ads\u201d that she was told would \u201cnot be disclosed externally,\u201d according to the complaint. She was paid $400. Sage says she later also discovered her voice in a YouTube video: a recording of a Lovo investor presentation demonstrating its technology. Lehrman and Sage allege that the people who contacted them on Fiverr were Lovo employees who misrepresented what their voice samples would be used for and later sold or raised money on the back of the AI-version of their voices. \u201cTo be clear, the product that customers purchase from LOVO is stolen property. They are voices stolen by LOVO and marketed by LOVO under false pretenses,\u201d the complaint states. The actors are seeking more than $5 million in damages, as well as a court order blocking Lovo from continuing the alleged use of their voices.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/17/tech/voice-actors-ai-lawsuit-lovo/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/18/2024", "section": "us"}}

Another in a maroon hoodie strikes a protester with a pole. A local instigator pushes down barricades. Law enforcement stood by for hours as counterprotesters attacked the pro-Palestinian encampment at UCLA on April 30,\u00a0which erupted into\u00a0the worst violence stemming from the ongoing college protests around the country over Israel\u2019s war in Gaza. While a criminal investigation is underway into the assaults that occurred at UCLA, the identities of the most aggressive counterprotesters have gone largely unknown. A CNN review of footage, social media posts, and interviews found that some of the most dramatic attacks caught on camera that night were committed by people outside UCLA \u2013 not the university students and faculty who were eventually arrested. Many at the scene appeared dedicated to the pro-Israel cause, according to social media and their own words that night. The violent counterprotesters identified by CNN, which included an aspiring screenwriter and film producer and a local high school student \u2013 were joined by unlikely allies, several of whom are known throughout southern California for frequenting and disrupting a variety of protests and public gatherings. The young man sporting the white mask and a white hoodie in widely shared video clips is Edan On, a local 18-year-old high school senior, his mother confirmed to CNN, though she later said he denies being at UCLA. Video shows On joining the counterprotesters while waving a long white pole. At one point, he strikes a pro-Palestinian protester with the pole, and appears to continue to strike him even when he was down, as fellow counterprotesters piled on. \u201cEdan went to bully the Palestinian students in the tents at UCLA and played the song that they played to the Nukhba terrorists in prison!\u201d his mother boasted in Hebrew on Facebook, referencing Hamas. She circled an image of him that had been broadcast on the local news. \u201cHe is all over the news channels,\u201d his mother wrote in a now-deleted post. Some counterprotesters had been spotted on campus days earlier, drawn by a high-profile pro-Israel rally as inflammatory videos and claims rapidly spread across social media. Many at the scene\u00a0Tuesday hid their faces behind masks and scarves. Some attackers sprayed protesters with chemical irritants, hit them with wooden boards, punched and kicked them and shot fireworks into the crowd of students and supporters huddled behind umbrellas and wooden planks, attempting to stay safe. For hours, they sought to pull away pieces of the barrier, scooping up fallen wooden planks and poles to use as makeshift weapons, lunging toward pro-Palestinian protesters who emerged from the camp to protect it from being breached. As protesters chanted, \u201cWe\u2019re not leaving\u201d from the encampment, some counterprotesters shouted back, \u201cYou are terrorists, you are terrorists!\u201d Video footage shows that some counterprotesters instigated the fighting, while others did little to intervene. Then\u00a0police did\u00a0little as a large group of counterprotesters calmy walked away, leaving behind bloody, bruised students and other protesters. The Los Angeles Police Department and California Highway Patrol referred all questions about the incident to the UCLA Police Department, which did not respond to multiple requests for comment. Law enforcement did not track injuries from the attack. But according to the encampment\u2019s organizers, more than 150 students \u201cwere assaulted with pepper spray and bear mace,\u201d and at least 25 protesters ended up being transported to local emergency rooms to receive treatment for injuries including fractures, severe lacerations and chemical-induced injuries. \u201cI actually thought someone would get killed,\u201d said Rabbi Chaim Seidler-Feller, UCLA Hillel\u2019s Director Emeritus, who called 911 around midnight as he watched the violence on live TV. \u201cThey came to beat people up.\u201d The next day, Hillel at UCLA posted an open letter from student leaders denouncing what it called \u201cfringe members of the off-campus Jewish community\u201d who did not represent \u201cthe estimated 3,000 Jewish Bruins at UCLA.\u201d \u201cWe cannot have a clearer ask for the off-campus Jewish community: stay off our campus,\u201d it stated. \u201cYour actions are harming Jewish students.\u201d \u2018You guys are about to get f\u2014ed up\u2019 In one of the more dramatic videos of the night, a protester wearing the colors of the Palestinian flag underneath an LA Kings jersey was knocked to the ground and beaten by multiple counterprotesters as he guarded the encampment. One of those assailants was On, who rushed into the middle of the fray with his pole. When CNN showed On\u2019s mother a\u00a0video\u00a0of him attacking the protester,\u00a0she said Edan, who she confirmed is a senior at Beverly Hills High School, was only defending himself. His mother \u2013 who previously described a smaller group of UCLA students protesting the war last year as \u201chuman animals\u201d on social media \u2013 said dozens of his schoolmates had also gone to campus on the 30th and that her son intends to join the Israel Defense Forces. The school district said federal law prohibits sharing information about students, including confirming their identities. On could not be reached for comment directly. When CNN contacted On\u2019s mother for an interview with him, she replied that her son was in Israel and that he claimed he wasn\u2019t at UCLA despite her earlier confirmation. The man in the LA Kings jersey was ultimately dragged into a group of counterprotesters and kicked by an aspiring Los Angeles screenwriter\u00a0and\u00a0producer\u00a0who CNN identified as Malachi Marlan-Librett, according to a review of social media photos, footage from the protest and interviews with multiple people who knew him.\u00a0According to his LinkedIn, he graduated from UC Santa Cruz in 2019 and attended a UCLA professional film and television program the following year. A man in a maroon hoodie joined Marlan-Librett in dragging the protester into the mob. The protester was later seen in a video receiving treatment for a bloody head injury at the encampment. Marlan-Librett and the man in the maroon hoodie, along with other counterprotesters, such as an unmasked man wearing a red bandana around his neck, were seen committing multiple acts of violence throughout the night. They became prime targets for online researchers who told CNN they had created internal nicknames such as #UCLARedBandana, #UCLANeffHat and #UCLAMaroonHoodie as they attempted to identify them. In one violent episode captured on video, Marlan-Librett is seen carrying the end of a broom in his hand, using it to strike a protester in the head before kicking him. Even after the protester retreats, Marlan-Librett sneaks up on him from behind and strikes him in the head once again. Marlan-Librett didn\u2019t respond to calls and texts from CNN. In another video, the man in the maroon hoodie runs toward the encampment yelling, \u201cYou guys are about to get f**ked up.\u201d In the over 3-hour-long livestream, the young man is in the thick of the scrum and can be seen hitting another man with a pole before arming counterprotesters with wood planks. The man could\u00a0be heard yelling at protesters, \u201cF**k\u00a0you, f**king terrorists,\u201d\u00a0then, \u201cThe score is 30,000\u201d \u2013 a reference to the number of\u00a0Palestinians\u00a0killed\u00a0by Israel\u2019s bombing campaign and ground offensive\u00a0in Gaza. Just minutes earlier, the man pepper-sprayed a journalist in the face, while she was filming the crowd. \u201cI had to walk off because I literally could not see anything,\u201d the local journalist, Dolores Quintana, told CNN. \u201cAnd it was getting in my mouth. And so, I was starting to choke.\u201d She said a volunteer came out of the encampment to wash out her eyes with water and saline. Quintana took a selfie when she could open her eyes again. In the photo, her face was drenched and pale, with red blotches on her forehead. \u201cThis was the worst situation I ever found myself in as a journalist,\u201d she said. \u201cI was afraid they were going to kill somebody.\u201d Local provocateurs in the fray According to multiple acquaintances of the man in the maroon hoodie, he attended Los Angeles Valley College with his brother. Both brothers were enrolled at USC in the fall 2023 semester for a couple weeks before disenrolling, according to the school. CNN could not reach the man in the maroon hoodie, and he did not have any apparent connection to UCLA. Neither did Tom Bibiyan, a 42-year-old who was once a local Green Party official. Bibiyan was stabbed at a KKK rally where he was a counter-protester in 2016 and has since become an ardent Trump supporter. His colorful Instagram page is a mix of right-wing memes, numerous posts defending famous men against sexual assault allegations and pro-Israel content. Video footage shows Bibiyan among those at the front line of people rushing the encampment in an attempt to remove protective metal barriers, as campus security guards watched the violence unfold. \u201cThe moment we rushed the terrorist encampment last night at ucla to take it apart,\u201d he captioned a video he posted to Instagram. \u201cF**k them kids,\u201d he said in a separate post, which has since been deleted. A CNN journalist reached Bibiyan outside his home, wearing the same jacket he had worn at UCLA, but he refused to say why he had taken part in the violence. \u201cYou\u2019re being a little rude, and I\u2019m going to call the police if you don\u2019t leave,\u201d he said. Other older men spotted among the mob looked familiar to local public school mom Angie Givant as she followed what happened that Tuesday night on social media: a group of right-wing provocateurs who she\u2019d seen protesting LGBTQ rights in public schools at school board and city council meetings around Los Angeles. \u201cAs soon as there were rumors that, you know, things were going to go down at UCLA, there was a mobilization of very familiar reactionary extremists,\u201d she told CNN. One of the older men, Narek Palyan, joined the group of counterprotesters despite having posted anti-Jewish tropes on his social media accounts. Palyan, who didn\u2019t appear to engage in the violence, claimed to CNN he has a child at UCLA, though a student was not seen accompanying him that night. \u201cI was definitely keeping the peace, at least trying to,\u201d he said. Student journalists attacked UCLA junior and student journalist Catherine Hamilton said that when a firework landed a few feet away from where she was standing and she saw the men approaching in masks, it was clear to her that they were about to do something they didn\u2019t want to be recognized for. \u201cIn that moment when that firework went off and started ringing in my ears, I was like, something very bad is going to happen on this campus,\u201d she said. When the police finally arrived hours later to break up the chaos, Hamilton and her colleagues regrouped to head back to their newsroom. As they walked past a line of cops and along a well-lit street in the center of campus, just before 3:30 am, she says they were encircled by a small group of\u00a0counterprotesters\u00a0mainly dressed in black. She told CNN the man leading the group was someone whom she immediately recognized. He was a counterprotester who had previously verbally harassed her and taken a photo of her press badge,\u00a0she said. Within seconds, they sprayed the student journalists with a type of mace or pepper spray and flashed lights in their faces. As she tried to get away, Hamilton said, she was repeatedly struck in the chest and abdomen. One of the journalists\u00a0confronted the attackers and shoved one before he was pummeled to the ground and beaten, according to video footage of the incident. \u2018I was expecting us to start working on an obituary\u2019 The day after the attack, UCLA\u2019s chancellor called the events\u00a0\u201ca\u00a0dark\u00a0chapter\u201d in the school\u2019s history that \u201chas shaken our campus to its core.\u201d A\u00a0parent\u00a0who was at the encampment with\u00a0their\u00a0child, a UCLA student, also described\u00a0the night\u00a0as feeling like \u201ca civil war movie\u201d with embers raining down and the wounded being treated all around.\u00a0The parent said they were\u00a0frantic to find help, calling UCLA campus police six times in a row. One fourth-year UCLA student \u2013 who requested anonymity due to safety concerns \u2013 told CNN he was hit in the corner of his forehead with a traffic cone. Minutes later, video captured a counterprotester smashing a wooden plank into the back of his head. With two deep cuts on his head, he said he rushed to the hospital and ultimately received 14 staples and three stitches for the injuries. The violence directed at the protesters and his access to medical treatment reminded him of why they had set up the encampment in the first place,\u00a0trying to raise awareness about the mass deaths and destruction from Israel\u2019s war in Gaza, and calling for the university to divest from any financial ties with Israel.\u00a0\u201cI had the privilege of going to a hospital,\u201d he said. \u201cIn Gaza, there are zero fully functioning hospitals.\u201d Thistle Boosinger, a 23-year-old member of the encampment who is not a UCLA student, had her hand smashed the night of the violence. She described how her assailant took a piece of wood above his head before slamming it down on her hand. \u201cAt first, I just screamed,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd then after like five minutes where my adrenaline wore off, it was so extremely painful.\u201d In a video call, Boosinger held up her hand wrapped in gauze and described her injury. \u201cMy bone is broken totally in half below my knuckle \u2026 [which is] shattered into a bunch of pieces and jumbled up.\u201d Dylan Kupsh, a UCLA graduate student, said he linked arms with other protesters in an attempt to defend the encampment and keep people safe. \u201cWe were \u2026 trying to keep the barricade wall up because that was literally protecting our lives,\u201d Kupsh said. It wasn\u2019t long before he was pepper sprayed, forcing him to seek medical treatment as the attacks continued. Kupsh and others still wonder what would have happened had the encampment been breached that night. \u201cI hate to say it,\u201d said Catherine Hamilton, the student journalist, \u201cbut I was expecting us to start working on an obituary the next day because I thought something that serious would happen to the students in the encampment.\u201d Do you have information to share about the attack at UCLA?

{"id": "2024_05_17_tech_openai-exec-exits-safety-concerns", "text": "A departing OpenAI executive focused on safety is raising concerns about the company on his way out the door. Jan Leike, who resigned from his role leading the company\u2019s \u201csuperalignment\u201d team this week, said in a thread on X Friday that he disagreed with OpenAI leadership\u2019s \u201ccore priorities\u201d and had \u201creached a breaking point.\u201d \u201cAlignment\u201d or \u201csuperalignment\u201d are terms used in the artificial intelligence space to refer to work on training AI systems to operate within human needs and priorities. Leike joined OpenAI in 2021, and last summer the company announced that he would co-lead the Superalignment team focused on \u201cscientific and technical breakthroughs to steer and control AI systems much smarter than us.\u201d However, Leike said Friday that in recent months, the team has been under resourced and \u201csailing against the wind.\u201d \u201cSometimes we were struggling for compute and it was getting harder and harder to get this crucial research done,\u201d he said on X, adding that Thursday was his last day at the startup. \u201cBuilding smarter-than-human machines is an inherently dangerous endeavor \u2026 But over the past years, safety culture and processes have taken a backseat to shiny products.\u201d Leike\u2019s exit, which he announced Wednesday, comes amid a broader leadership shuffle at OpenAI. His resignation followed an announcement by OpenAI Co-Founder and Chief Scientist Ilya Sutskever, who also helped lead the superalignment team, on Tuesday that he would leave the company. Sutskever said he was leaving to work on a \u201cproject that is very personally meaningful to me.\u201d But his exit was notable given the central role he played in the dramatic firing \u2014 and return \u2014 of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman last year, when he voted to remove Altman as chief executive and chairman of the board. CNN contributor Kara Swisher\u00a0previously reported that Sutskever had been concerned that Altman was pushing AI technology \u201ctoo far, too fast.\u201d But days after Altman\u2019s ouster, Sutskever had a change of heart: He signed an employee letter calling for the entire board to resign and for Altman to return. Still, questions about how \u2014 and how quickly \u2014 to develop and publicly release AI technology may have continued to cause tension within the company in the months after Altman regained control of the firm. The executive exits come after OpenAI announced this week that it would make its most powerful AI model yet, GPT-4o, available for free to the public through ChatGPT. The technology will make ChatGPT more like a digital personal assistant, capable of real-time spoken conversations. \u201cI believe much more of our bandwidth should be spent getting ready for the next generations of models, on security, monitoring, preparedness, safety, adversarial robustness, (super)alignment, confidentiality, societal impact, and related topics,\u201d Leike wrote in his X thread on Friday. \u201cThese problems are quite hard to get right, and I am concerned we aren\u2019t on a trajectory to get there.\u201d Asked for comment on Leike\u2019s claims, OpenAI directed CNN to an X post from Altman saying the company is committed to safety. \u201ci\u2019m super appreciative of @janleike\u2019s contributions to openai\u2019s alignment research and safety culture, and very sad to see him leave,\u201d Altman said. \u201che\u2019s right we have a lot more to do; we are committed to doing it. i\u2019ll have a longer post in the next couple of days.\u201d \u2013CNN\u2019s Samantha Delouya contributed to this report.

{"id": "2024_05_16_us_morehouse-college-graduation-biden-commencement", "text": "Morehouse College President David A. Thomas said Thursday he would shut down commencement ceremonies \u201con the spot\u201d rather than allow police to remove student protesters in zip ties during President Joe Biden\u2019s graduation speech. Biden\u2019s scheduled commencement speech Sunday at one of the nation\u2019s preeminent historically Black colleges comes as school officials around the country have called in law enforcement to\u00a0clear pro-Palestinian encampments and quell demonstrations\u00a0in recent weeks. \u201cWhat we won\u2019t allow is disruptive behavior that prevents the ceremony or services from proceeding in a manner that those in attendance can partake and enjoy,\u201d Thomas told CNN in an interview Thursday. \u201cSo, for example, prolonged shouting down of the president as he speaks. I have also made a decision that we will also not ask police to take individuals out of commencement in zip ties. If faced with the choice, I will cease the ceremonies on the spot If we were to reach that position.\u201d Biden\u2019s presence on the Atlanta campus also comes as he seeks to persuade young voters to send him to the White House for another term, even as many have expressed frustration for his administration\u2019s continued support of Israel\u2019s military campaign in Gaza. Thomas said the college will not allow \u201chate speech,\u201d meaning any \u201ccalls for violence against another group or individual.\u201d He said Morehouse is a place that \u201ccan hold the tensions\u201d that have come to a boil at campuses across the nation. \u201cI would rather be the first president to have a failed commencement than to say you are less important than the ceremonies of this institution,\u201d Thomas told CNN. \u201cI thought about it from the vantage point of how should Morehouse show up as an institution. And we should never put the ego of the institution above our values. And one of our values is to see the humanity in all,\u201d he added. Thomas said Morehouse faculty members earlier Thursday voted to award Biden an honorary degree. He said Biden\u2019s decades as a public servant as well as a domestic and international leader whose body of work \u201cmerits an honorary degree from Morehouse College.\u201d \u201cWe need some place in this country that can hold the tensions that threaten to divide us,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cWe look around some of the most venerable institutions of higher education have canceled commencement, canceled valedictorian speakers because of their having spoken out and exercised their rights to free speech.\u201d Thomas said the college would allow silent, non-disruptive protest, even students turning their chairs or theirs backs on Biden \u2013 which, he said, would embarrass him. \u201cAs long as you don\u2019t conduct yourselves in a way that deprives others from being able to participate, consume and celebrate this moment,\u201d said Thomas, who has led Morehouse since 2018. \u201cSilent protests. You want to walk across the stage in a piece of garment that identifies your moral connection to either side of this conflict because we also have Jewish students here, you can do that.\u201d CNN has reached out to the White House for comment. Protests have erupted at college campuses across the country as students have demanded that universities divest from Israel. Commencement ceremonies are taking place against a backdrop of police barricades and heightened law enforcement presence, metal detectors and other security measures. Biden has been\u00a0confronted by some protests\u00a0during his own speeches and campaign events. A Biden speech on abortion rights at George Mason University in Virginia earlier this year was marred by more than a dozen protests over his administration\u2019s support of Israel. Biden is also expected to deliver a commencement address at the United States Military Academy at West Point on May 25.

{"id": "2024_05_17_politics_crockett-greene-contentious-committee-meeting", "text": "Democratic Rep. Jasmine Crockett criticized\u00a0Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, calling her \u201cracist,\u201d following a tense House Oversight markup Thursday evening that quickly devolved into personal attacks. As the panel met to advance contempt proceedings against Attorney General Merrick Garland over his refusal to turn over audio recordings of President Joe Biden\u2019s interview with\u00a0special counsel Robert Hur, Greene, a Georgia Republican, sparked outrage when she commented on\u00a0Crockett\u2019s appearance. \u201cI think your fake eyelashes are messing up what you\u2019re reading,\u201d Greene said. Speaking to reporters on Friday about the incident, Crockett said, \u201cThat\u2019s all it is, it is racism. And she decided that she was going to be that person out loud and out front on yesterday. The difference is I just wasn\u2019t going to take it laying down.\u201d \u201cShe is racist. I mean, I don\u2019t have any questions about that,\u201d she added. Asked for comment by CNN, Greene\u2019s office said, \u201cthe only member that brought up any reference to color was congresswoman Crockett.\u201d On\u00a0social media\u00a0Friday evening, Greene doubled down on her comments and slammed criticism from within her party about her behavior. \u201cAOC isn\u2019t intelligent. Jasmine Crockett has fake eyelashes. These aren\u2019t attacks on personalities. These are just facts,\u201d she\u00a0wrote on X. The rules of the House dictate members can\u2019t \u201cengage in personalities,\u201d meaning they are not allowed to make offensive comments about or toward another member. If it occurs, the member who was insulted can ask for the words to be stricken from the record and, if that happens, the offending member is not allowed to speak for the remainder of the proceeding. During the markup, there was a failed vote to strike Greene\u2019s comments from the record and she was allowed to continue her remarks. At the markup, Greene started by asking Democrats on the committee if any of them employ the\u00a0daughter of\u00a0Judge Juan Merchan, who is overseeing the criminal trial in New York of former President Donald Trump. As Republicans have sought to\u00a0curry favor with Trump, they have gone after Merchan\u2019s daughter, who has ties to Democrats, as they seek to undermine the case. Crockett, a Democrat from Texas, asked Greene, \u201cDo you know what we\u2019re here for?\u201d Greene shot back: \u201cI don\u2019t think you know what you\u2019re here for \u2026 I think your fake eyelashes are messing up what you\u2019re reading.\u201d Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez immediately jumped in to get Greene\u2019s words taken down. \u201cThat is absolutely unacceptable. How dare you attack the physical appearance of another person,\u201d the New York Democrat said. After a series of votes in response to Greene\u2019s explosive rhetoric,\u00a0Crockett made a dig that appeared to be directed at the Republican. \u201cI\u2019m just curious. Just to better understand your ruling. If someone on this committee then starts talking about somebody\u2019s bleach blonde bad built butch body, that would not be engaging in personalities, correct,\u201d\u00a0Crockett\u00a0said. Crockett said on Friday that Greene is unserious and does not respect the process. \u201cShe\u2019s lacking any ability to actually engage in actual discourse, she doesn\u2019t know her job. She doesn\u2019t know the issues that we\u2019re dealing with when we\u2019re in committee. So instead, she does what most of MAGA does which they seek to insult and personal attacks. She needs to get a staff that can get her up to speed so that she can actually talk about something of substance and actually represent her district,\u201d Crockett said. Crockett also said she is a \u201cgrown woman\u201d and wasn\u2019t going to take it \u201claying down.\u201d \u201cOne thing I\u2019m not going to do is have somebody disrespect me as a duly elected official myself, and then I\u2019m just going to say, well, that\u2019s okay. And rub it off. No, we\u2019re not going to do that.\u201d She added: \u201cSo if if they can\u2019t follow the rules, I will have to fight for myself.\u201d House Speaker Mike Johnson, who has a contentious relationship with Greene, said Friday that \u201cit\u2019s regrettable\u201d that partisanship in the House devolved into ad hominem attacks and chaos during the meeting. \u201cI think decorum is an important thing for us to maintain around here,\u201d Johnson said, adding, \u201ceven when we disagree \u2014\u00a0even vehemently \u2014 we\u2019ve got to treat one another with dignity and respect.\u201d In response, Greene took to social media to slam Johnson, whom she tried to oust from the speakership earlier this month. \u201cHow ridiculous is it that the Speaker runs his mouth about decorum when our opposition refuses to follow it at all,\u201d\u00a0she wrote on X Friday evening.\u00a0 Republican and Democratic members of the House Oversight Committee also expressed shock and disgust at the \u201cunacceptable\u201d conduct during the committee meeting. \u201cIt\u2019s not appropriate. None of it\u2019s appropriate,\u201d said GOP Rep. Tim Burchett, who was seated next to Greene during the hearing. \u201cI mean, \u2018butch body\u2019 and \u2018bleach blonde\u2019 hair, now that \u2013 there\u2019s no place for that up here. And it\u2019s just, it\u2019s disgusting. And I got a little girl, I don\u2019t want to hear her insulting somebody\u2019s appearance like that. And yeah, it was pitiful,\u201d he added. The top Democrat on the committee, Rep. Jamie Raskin, said that House Republicans\u2019 behavior \u201cbrought disgrace to the whole institution,\u201d criticizing Greene\u2019s conduct in the hearing. \u201cWhen the chairman allowed the distinguished gentlelady from Georgia to attack another members\u2019 eyelashes or her personal appearance, the whole meeting descended at that point,\u201d he said.

{"id": "2024_05_15_us_baltimore-bridge-collapse-house-hearing", "text": "The cargo ship Dali experienced two blackouts while moored in the Port of Baltimore a day before its catastrophic collision with the Francis Scott Key Bridge, and efforts to resolve those blackouts may have impacted the ship\u2019s operations, the head of the National Transportation Safety Board said in a congressional hearing Wednesday. After the two in-port blackouts on March 25, the ship\u2019s crew switched to a different transformer and set of breakers from those that had been in use for several months, according to NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy. That may have impacted the ship\u2019s operations when it left the port a day later, she said. \u201cSwitching breakers is not unusual but may have affected operations the very next day on the accident voyage,\u201d Homendy said. The comments, which add further context to the focus of the NTSB investigation, came during a hearing for the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure reviewing and analyzing the federal response to the collapse of the Key bridge on March 26. On Tuesday, the NTSB released a 24-page preliminary report detailing investigators\u2019 early factual findings. The Dali struck the bridge with enough force to bring down the 1.6-mile-long steel structure, killing six construction workers on the bridge and severing access to critical shipping routes in and out of the Port of Baltimore. The report found the Dali was just three ships\u2019 lengths from the bridge when it suffered a pair of catastrophic electrical failures, which\u00a0caused several pumps required for the ship\u2019s propeller and rudder to stop working. The emergency generator activated but was not configured to power the ship, the report said. At Wednesday\u2019s hearing, Homendy described the ship as \u201cessentially drifting\u201d before crashing into the bridge. The NTSB report found that the Dali had experienced two blackouts a day earlier while still moored in the port. \u201cThe NTSB is still investigating the electrical configuration following the first in-port blackout and potential impacts on the events during the accident voyage,\u201d the report states. Homendy said Wednesday the NTSB has been working closely with Hyundai, which manufactures the ship equipment, to try to replicate some of the electrical problems of that day and understand better what happened. An NTSB preliminary report does not conclude a probable cause. Those findings will be part of a final report that could take investigators up to two years to complete. Officials estimate cost and timeline of replacement bridge The House committee hearing Wednesday featured testimony from Homendy, Coast Guard Vice Adm. Peter Gautier, Army Corps of Engineers Major Gen. William H. Graham and Federal Highway Administration Administrator Shailen Bhatt. The officials offered several estimates for the steps ahead. The Dali is expected to be refloated and removed from the port early next week, Gautier said, and the full channel is on track to be open by the end of May, Graham said. Further, a new replacement bridge is estimated to be open in 2028 and cost about $1.7 to $1.9 billion, Bhatt said. In the meantime, Homendy recommended that bridge operators and owners reexamine how US bridges are protected from incoming ships, noting the increasing size of cargo ships over the decades. \u201cIn this situation, you have a bridge that began operations in 1977, and if it was built today it would be built differently,\u201d she said. Video footage from moments before the crash showed plumes of black smoke coming from the 213-million pound vessel as well as the lights\u00a0flickering on and off. The NTSB report details the frantic efforts of those on the Dali to stop the ship and warn those on the bridge of potential disaster. The report also highlights the near-catastrophic experiences of a crew member on the ship and a road maintenance inspector on the bridge. The crew member was on the bow of the ship at the time of the crash. \u201c(He) told investigators that, as he was releasing the brake on the port anchor, he had to escape from the falling bridge before he was able to reapply the brake,\u201d the report states. The inspector on the bridge had been walking the span when the ship struck. \u201cHe ran north and made it to the nearest surviving span before the rest of the bridge collapsed,\u201d the report states. Six construction workers\u00a0who were filling potholes on the bridge were killed in the disaster. The victims were immigrants from El Salvador, Mexico, Guatemala and Honduras\u00a0who worked\u00a0to support their families.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/us/baltimore-bridge-collapse-house-hearing/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/18/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_05_17_business_gen-z-credit-card-users", "text": "Ariel Barnes plunged into a credit card debt spiral in college, and a decade later she\u2019s yet to escape. Barnes has maxed out seven credit cards and is struggling to make minimum payments on $30,000 of credit card debt. \u201cThe interest is so high that it\u2019s hard to get out of it,\u201d Barnes, who is 28 years old and lives in Jackson, Mississippi, told CNN in a phone interview on Thursday. Barnes is hardly alone. Roughly one in seven (15.3%) Gen Z credit card borrowers have maxed out their credit cards, according to\u00a0new research\u00a0from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. (The NY Fed defined Gen Z as borrowers born between 1995 and 2011, though\u00a0others mark the cut off\u00a0as 1996 or 1997). By comparison, just 4.8% of Baby Boomer borrowers and 9.6% of Gen Xers have maxed out their credit cards, which can be a sign of a severely tight cash-flow problem. The findings underscore starkly different conditions masked by national economic statistics. Barnes blames bad financial decisions when she was in college for her current situation, which has forced her to live at home and delay major life events. \u201cI want children. The clock is ticking. But I can\u2019t afford to have any children,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve had to go to therapy because it is a lot mentally.\u201d More and more Americans of all ages are falling behind on their bills \u2014 especially credit card bills. The NY Fed found that for all debt outside of student loans, delinquency rates have been steadily rising since tumbling to historic lows during the Covid-19 pandemic. Credit card delinquencies have surpassed pre-pandemic levels and continue to rise. Severe credit card delinquencies, those 90 days overdue, have now climbed to 10.7% \u2014 the highest since 2012. The findings show how pockets of financial stress continue to emerge in the US economy following three years of high inflation. \u201cIt is worrisome that so many Gen Zers are falling behind,\u201d said Ted Rossman, senior industry analyst at Bankrate.com. \u201dWe\u2019re seeing more people financing daily essentials such as groceries and gas, and this can be a tough cycle to break.\u201d \u2018Cause for concern\u2019 Even as stocks on Wall Street hit historic highs and unemployment remains unusually low, millions of Americans are struggling with the cost of living. \u201cThe rise in severe delinquencies \u2014 those over 90 days overdue \u2014 is a cause for concern,\u201d said Gregory Daco, chief economist at EY. The NY Fed found there is a direct link between maxing out credit cards and falling behind on payments. Very few Americans who have used 20% or less of their credit card limit have fallen behind on their bills, according to the research. However, the transition rate into delinquency for those who have used more than 60% of their credit card limit has now surpassed pre-Covid levels and continues to rise, the NY Fed said. A third of maxed-out borrowers are delinquent The researchers said this trend is \u201cespecially remarkable\u201d for those who have maxed out their cards, defined as using 90% to 100% of their limit. A third of maxed-out borrowers have gone delinquent in the last year, compared with less than a quarter before the pandemic, the NY Fed said. \u201cWhile most commentators discuss a soft landing for\u00a0the\u00a0economy or\u00a0the\u00a0consumer,\u201d Daco said, \u201cthe latest evidence on credit conditions points to multiple economies, multiple consumers, affected to different degrees by the higher cost and higher interest rate environment.\u201d Maxing out credit cards can hurt borrowers\u2019 credit scores. Under FICO Score\u2019s calculation, the ratio of balance-to-credit limit is the second most important category for determining credit scores. \u201cFICO will be closely monitoring this trend in the coming quarters to better understand whether this is simply a reversion to pre-pandemic consumer behaviors,\u201d Tommy Lee, senior director at FICO, told CNN in an email. The NY Fed explained that part of the reason Gen Z borrowers are maxed out is because they have much lower credit limits. Many younger Americans haven\u2019t had the time to build credit histories and credit scores that would let them borrow more. For instance, the median Gen Z borrower\u2019s credit limit is just $4,500, compared with $16,300 for Millennials and $21,800 for Gen X, the NY Fed said. The NY Fed declined to share historical data on maxed out credit cards by generation. During a call with reporters, NY Fed researchers explained that it\u2019s a \u201ctypical age pattern\u201d where younger borrowers have used up more of their credit card limit. Lee, the FICO executive, said history shows that as consumers age and their credit experience increases, so do their credit limits. Americans in low-income areas are more likely to be maxed out Of course, it\u2019s not just younger users maxing out their credit cards. The NY Fed found that borrowers who live in low-income areas are also more likely to be maxed out. About 12% of borrowers living in neighborhoods with the bottom 25% of incomes have maxed out their cards, the report found. That\u2019s more than twice the 5.5% of borrowers living in the highest income neighborhoods who are maxed out. There\u2019s never a good time to carry a credit card balance, but right now is arguably the worst time. The average credit card interest rate stands at 20.66%, according to Bankrate. That\u2019s just shy of the record high of 20.75% set last month. Daco said officials at the Federal Reserve must take into account the credit card stress some Americans are feeling as they decide when to lower interest rates. The Fed faces a delicate balance. Cutting rates prematurely could make inflation worse. But waiting too long could pile even more pressure on borrowers, especially if the jobs market slows and more people struggle to find work. \u201cThe risk of over-tightening could lead to unintended consequences that further strain household finances,\u201d Daco said. Ways to get out of debt Experts say there are possible solutions for people who feel trapped by credit card debt. Rossman, the Bankrate analyst, said options include: \u201cI know it\u2019s easier said than done,\u201d Rossman said, \u201cbut it\u2019s so important to make credit card debt payoff a priority.\u201d CNN\u2019s Alicia Wallace contributed reporting.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/17/business/gen-z-credit-card-users/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/18/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_05_14_us_harvard-agreement-pro-palestinian-protests", "text": "A group of pro-Palestinian protesters\u00a0maintaining an encampment at\u00a0Harvard University have reached an agreement with the university and will end their encampment, the group said in a news release Tuesday. Harvard\u00a0has agreed to hold reinstatement proceedings \u201cfor the over 20 students and student workers suspended by the University for their alleged participation in the encampment,\u201d the group said. For 60 students and student workers facing disciplinary procedures, the university has agreed to expedite their cases \u201cin line with precedents of leniency for similar actions in the past,\u201d according to\u00a0Harvard\u00a0Out of Occupied Palestine (HOOP), the organization behind the encampment. The agreement \u2013 which the Harvard Jewish Alumni Alliance described as an example of \u201cmis-governance\u201d by the university \u2013 comes as college officials around the country have called in law enforcement to clear pro-Palestinian encampments and quell demonstrations in recent weeks. Alan Garber, Harvard\u2019s interim president, in a message to the university community, said he has asked schools to \u201cpromptly initiate applicable reinstatement proceedings for all individuals who have been placed on involuntary leaves of absence.\u201d Garber did not say how many students were involved. Garber also said he has asked the \u201cdisciplinary boards within each School to evaluate expeditiously, according to their existing practices and precedents, the cases of those who participated in the encampment.\u201d Garber \u201cwill ask the schools to adjudicate disciplinary matters promptly,\u201d according to a university spokesperson, adding that he will also request that reinstatement requests be processed expeditiously. Harvard University has 12 graduate and professional schools, the undergraduate Harvard College, and the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study. HOOP said the university will meet with the protesters \u201cto begin discussions on disclosure, divestment, and reinvestment.\u201d\u00a0Harvard\u00a0will also engage in conversations about creating a \u201cCenter for Palestine Studies at\u00a0Harvard,\u201d the group said. Garber said he will \u201cfacilitate a meeting with the chair of the Corporation Committee on Shareholder Responsibility and other University officials to address questions about the endowment.\u201d The Harvard Crimson reported May 6 that Garber has repeatedly stated that the endowment will not be used as a tool for political means. The university has also repeatedly stated its position resisting calls for divestment. The university president and the dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences will also meet with students \u201cto hear their perspectives on academic matters related to longstanding conflicts in the Middle East,\u201d according to Garber\u2019s message. \u201cI acknowledge the profound grief that many in our community feel over the tragic effects of the ongoing war,\u201d Garber said. \u201cThere will continue to be deep disagreements and strongly felt emotions as we experience pain and distress over events in the wider world.\u201d The encampment at the Cambridge,\u00a0Massachusetts, campus lasted 20 days, according to the group. Harvard began placing students connected to the encampment on \u201cinvoluntary\u201d leaves of absence, the Harvard Crimson\u00a0reported\u00a0Friday, citing an Instagram post\u00a0from HOOP. The move came after protesters\u00a0rejected an offer\u00a0from Garber to avoid being placed on leave in exchange for taking down the encampment. The Harvard Jewish Alumni Alliance, in a message to members, described the agreement as \u201cgross mis-governance\u201d that \u201cundermines the stated mission\u201d of the university. The group accused the interim president of \u201cgiving preferential treatment to students, faculty and staff whose conduct not only targeted Jews but also disrupted and imperiled the wider Harvard community.\u201d The alumni alliance urged members to withhold donations to Harvard, and join a campaign to \u201cdonate one dollar, and no more, to the University for the foreseeable future \u2014 not in anger, but in sadness and in hope.\u201d The Ivy League school has experienced a period of historic turmoil in recent months.

{"id": "2024_05_17_politics_trump-hill-allies-trial-litmus-test", "text": "When his hush money trial first got underway in April, former President Donald Trump privately complained that not enough of his allies were inside or outside the courtroom to defend him, according to multiple GOP sources familiar with his thinking. But several weeks later, Trump\u2019s supporters are flocking to the Manhattan courtroom in droves. While in most cases Trump has not asked anyone to attend his trial, sources say word of Trump\u2019s frustration quickly spread to Capitol Hill, prompting his staunchest defenders to spring into action to show their support for Trump while he\u2019s in the hot seat. Some of them began reaching out to Trump\u2019s camp, offering to come and defend the former president in New York and asking how they could secure a spot in court. GOP Sen. Rick Scott of Florida became the first lawmaker to make the trek up north last week, followed several days later by House Speaker Mike Johnson \u2013 who\u2019s been under fire from his right flank \u2013 and a quartet of Republicans sporting nearly identical navy suits with red ties, which, whether accidental or not, took the coordination to the next level. Their appearances inspired what sources say has been a mostly organic movement among Republicans. Now, the floodgates have opened, with Trump\u2019s team fielding a deluge of interest from lawmakers and orchestrating campaign stops with Trump supporters within the city before and after trial appearances as the proceedings drag on. \u201cThere\u2019s been a waterfall [of people] who want to come and show support for him, and we expect more,\u201d one Trump adviser told CNN. It\u2019s just the latest sign that the pilgrimage to Trump\u2019s criminal trial in New York has become a new litmus test for Trump loyalty inside the GOP ahead of November. For participants, the benefits are twofold: Not only are they able to score valuable brownie points with their party\u2019s presumptive presidential nominee, but it\u2019s also an opportunity to step into the spotlight, with several members \u2013 including Johnson and GOP Rep. Lauren Boebert of Colorado \u2013 even fundraising off their appearances. \u201cWhat the Republicans are doing is showing support for a man that is being persecuted unfairly,\u201d Rep. Ralph Norman of South Carolina, one of the GOP members who attended the trial this week, told CNN. \u201cThis can happen to any American. And it shouldn\u2019t. And President Trump is a fighter and he\u2019s standing firm and we want to back him.\u201d Attending court alongside Trump has also become somewhat of an audition for a role in a potential future Trump administration. North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum and Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance, both currently on the shortlist for vice president, have been among those in attendance this week. \u201cShowing up to support somebody in a criminal trial is not naturally a part of the rhythm of a congressional office,\u201d said one GOP lawmaker. \u201cBut when people saw Rick Scott do it, and then J.D. and Vivek [Ramaswamy], they were trying to do it too. It happened organically.\u201d \u2018We\u2019ve got your back\u2019 The latest group to make the voyage to New York: members of the far-right House Freedom Caucus, who represent some of Trump\u2019s closest allies on Capitol Hill. The GOP lawmakers informed the Trump team that they would be bringing a large group on Thursday, even though the House was in session, and requested a meeting with the former president before court processions started that day, according to a source familiar with the plans. The meeting lasted around 30 minutes in Trump Tower, and Trump\u2019s son Eric was also present, sources said. The members gave the former president a \u201cpep talk\u201d ahead of the trial and discussed the future of government funding \u2013 and specifically, his preference for the length of a short-term government funding patch that is expected after September 30 \u2013 if Trump were to win back the White House in November, the source added. Then, the GOP members joined Trump in his motorcade \u2013 including the Republican candidate challenging GOP Rep. Bob Good, who has tried to cozy up to Trump after initially endorsing Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis \u2013 to give the former president a splashy appearance as he arrived for court that day, flanked by a cavalry of his supporters. The lawmakers also made sure to stop by the cameras outside the courthouse to attack the prosecutors and witnesses and undermine the case, filling a void that Trump, who is under a gag order, can\u2019t. \u201cMr. President, we\u2019ve got your back,\u201d GOP Rep. Andy Ogles said outside the courthouse. Even though the 11 Republican House members rode in Trump\u2019s motorcade, the Trump campaign did not foot the bill for their travel to New York, according to a Trump campaign official. In some cases, the individual campaign committees of members of Congress paid, according to someone involved with the travel earlier this week. It is unclear what role the US Capitol Police had in securing members to and from New York, as a USCP spokesperson would not comment when asked if they provided additional security services. \u201cHe did not ask anybody,\u201d Norman said of Trump. \u201cEverybody volunteered to go. We paid our own way. He didn\u2019t pay anything. He didn\u2019t tell us what to say. A lot of us just feel like enough is enough.\u201d Legislating takes a back seat to Trump loyalty test But to attend the trial, the lawmakers left their day jobs behind. There were so many GOP lawmakers in New York to support Trump that, for at least a few hours on Thursday, there were more House Democrats present on Capitol Hill than Republicans. It wasn\u2019t an insignificant day in the House either. The House Judiciary and Oversight committees were set to consider reports to hold Attorney General Merrick Garland in contempt of Congress for refusing to turn over the audio tapes of President Joe BIden\u2019s interviews with special counsel Robert Hur \u2013 a top priority on the right. GOP Reps. Matt Gaetz and Andy Biggs both missed the Judiciary committee markup, while the House Oversight panel had to push their start time back to 8pm, just to give some of their members enough time to get back from New York. On top of that, the House was scheduled to vote\u00a0on a GOP-led bill to compel the delivery of defensive weapons to Israel as Republicans ramp up pressure on Biden over his handling of the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. Gaetz along with Boebert and GOP Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, who were all in New York on Thursday, missed the vote. As soon as the Oversight markup, dubbed by some Democrats as\u00a0\u201cOversight after dark\u201d got underway on Thursday night, it started to go off the rails. GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene sparked outrage when she went after Democratic Rep. Jasmine Crockett\u2019s appearance and Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s intelligence, with the committee meeting devolving into a heated\u00a0sparring match. Some Republican lawmakers speculated that perhaps the reason for Greene\u2019s mood was that she has been frustrated with her colleagues, including the speaker, who have been quick to publicly support the president during his trial, but haven\u2019t always joined her in supporting some of the Trump-favored policies that she has pushed. \u201cGreene is not impressed with the johnny and suzy come latelys to Trump\u2019s defense,\u201d according to a source who has heard her express her opinion. Greene \u2013 the first GOP lawmaker to appear with Trump in New York when he was indicted in March 2023 \u2013 appeared particularly annoyed with Boebert, who had attended Trump\u2019s trial that morning and then voted with Democrats during the markup to try and prevent Greene from speaking further. \u201cLauren Boebert has been in the shadows of Marjorie Taylor Greene for almost four years and is grasping at any bitter relevance that she can latch onto,\u201d the source added. Boebert, who apologized to the American people after Greene\u2019s outburst, defended both her vote to try and silence Greene and her decision to travel to Trump\u2019s trial in New York, which ultimately did not impact the committee\u2019s ability to advance the contempt resolution. \u201cIt was embarrassing what was going on,\u201d Boebert said of the markup. \u201cI felt shame that that was happening while we are taking care of serious business, and it\u2019s the first time in how long that we\u2019ve been taking care of serious business, and we\u2019re doing what the American people have been demanding and having accountability for this weaponized federal government.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/17/politics/trump-hill-allies-trial-litmus-test/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/18/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_05_16_us_brown-pelicans-california-coast", "text": "Droves of starving brown pelicans have been found stranded on the California coast since late April and the root cause of the event remains a mystery, wildlife watchers say. Arriving dehydrated, starved and injured from fishing lines and hooks, the pelicans are mostly turning up in the Monterey and Santa Cruz areas in Northern California, International Bird Rescue, a nonprofit conservation organization, said on its website. They\u2019re also popping up in \u201codd spots\u201d in Southern California, including a lake at Inglewood\u2019s SoFi Stadium and a fire station in Malibu, the group said The California Department of Fish and Wildlife is \u201cperforming postmortem examinations on brown pelicans sent to our laboratories in Sacramento and Santa Cruz.\u00a0Preliminary findings indicate emaciation as the primary issue contributing to this stranding event,\u201d department spokesperson Tim Daly told CNN in a statement. International Bird Rescue reported more than 260 brown pelicans \u2013 a once endangered species \u2013 have arrived at the organization\u2019s California treatment centers since April 20. \u201cDiagnostic testing has not revealed any evidence of diseases such as bird flu that may be causing these strandings. Bird Rescue\u2019s staff and volunteers are working tirelessly to provide the affected birds with the best care they desperately need to recover and return to the wild,\u201d the group said on its website. The nonprofit said Friday they\u2019re overwhelmed with public donations of surgical tape, syringes, pet hair blow-dryers, waterfowl food, rubber floor mats, gloves and more. Still needed are donations for the cost of fish to feed the pelican patients. The seabirds have displayed this behavior before \u2013 almost exactly two years ago \u2013 in the same areas. And the recovery effort is expensive. In May 2022, the crisis cost the rescue group $45 per day for food, medicine and staff and $2,000 in fish, it said. Before 2022, the last great influx of brown pelicans to International Bird Rescue was in 2012. Two years ago, testing also showed symptoms of starvation in the nearly 800 pelicans that arrived in rehabilitation centers. \u201cIn Spring 2022, the precise factors that contributed to reduced prey intake by the pelicans was not determined although scientists concluded the pelicans likely had difficulty reaching prey fish in the ocean as they normally would,\u201d Daly\u2019s statement said. \u201cIn 2022 and in this current event, strong storm systems occurred in the southern California region in the spring preceding the events, and it\u2019s possible these conditions impacted the pelican\u2019s ability to access prey fish under the water\u2019s surface.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/16/us/brown-pelicans-california-coast/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/18/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_05_16_politics_kamala-harris-vice-president-debate-2024", "text": "Vice President Kamala Harris has agreed to debate Donald Trump\u2019s future running mate, a Biden campaign official told CNN Thursday. The Biden campaign informed CBS News it had accepted the network\u2019s invitation to participate in a vice presidential debate in studio on either of the two dates the outlet proposed, July 23 or August 13, the campaign official said. \u201cWe look forward to the Trump campaign accepting one of these dates so that the full debate calendar for this campaign can be set,\u201d the official added. The proposed date of July 23 would come less than a week after the conclusion of the Republican convention\u00a0in Milwaukee, giving Trump\u2019s running mate limited time to prepare for a debate with Harris. CNN has reached out to the Trump campaign about whether it would agree for his running mate to participate. On Friday, Trump took to his Truth Social platform to announce that his campaign had accepted an invitation for his future running mate to participate in a debate hosted by Fox News and called on Harris to do the same. But the Biden campaign indicated to CNN that Harris would not participate in Fox\u2019s debate, pointing to the fact that\u00a0the vice president\u00a0had already accepted CBS\u2019 invitation and referring CNN to an earlier statement by Biden campaign manager Jen O\u2019Malley Dillon. O\u2019Malley Dillon\u00a0specified that\u00a0presidential and vice-presidential debates \u201cshould be hosted by any broadcast organization that hosted a Republican Primary debate in 2016 in which Donald Trump participated, and a Democratic primary debate in 2020 in which President Biden participated \u2013 so neither campaign can assert that the sponsoring organization is obviously unacceptable.\u201d In the 2020 campaign cycle, the Democratic National Committee said Fox News would not host any Democratic primary debates, citing reporting in The New Yorker about the mutually beneficial relationship between Fox and the Trump administration. Trump said in an interview that aired Thursday that there was a \u201cpretty good chance\u201d he would announce his vice presidential pick at the convention in Milwaukee. \u201cI don\u2019t say anything\u2019s a 100%, but you\u2019re getting pretty close. I\u2019ll be doing it in Milwaukee,\u201d he told TMJ4 news. Donald Trump Jr., the president\u2019s oldest son who has been an advocate for his father picking Ohio Sen. JD Vance as his running mate, told the senator Thursday that \u201cwe should choose sooner than later, because I wanted that to be out there right now.\u201d Trump Jr. was speaking on his \u201cTriggered\u201d podcast. Vance indicated that if he received that call from the former president, he\u2019d take the job. \u201cI want to help your dad however I can,\u201d the senator told Trump Jr. \u201cCertainly, if he asked me, I want to help him.\u201d On Wednesday,\u00a0President Joe Biden and Trump accepted an invitation from\u00a0CNN to debate on June 27, a historically early showdown that will set the tone for the final months of the 2024 campaign. They have also agreed to\u00a0a debate on ABC News on September 10. Informal conversations between the Biden and Trump campaigns about debates had taken place in recent weeks and were largely focused on a mutual disdain for the Commission\u00a0on Presidential Debates and potential scenarios to work around the commission, three sources familiar with the discussions previously told CNN. For millions of Americans, the debates will represent the most extensive scrutiny they\u2019ll be able to give the candidates and their running mates since the debates leading up to the 2020 election. Harris this year has become\u00a0a key figure for\u00a0the\u00a0Biden\u00a0administration\u00a0and campaign, criss-crossing the country\u00a0to make\u00a0points that might be more difficult for the president \u2013 an older White man \u2013 to make himself.

The complaint, filed Wednesday with the US Department of Education Office for Civil Rights (OCR), says the school district enforced \u201cdiscriminatory sex-specific dress code policies\u201d that \u201cdisproportionately harms girls, particularly transgender and gender nonconforming girls.\u201d The 16-year-old transgender girl, identified in the complaint as \u201cA.H.,\u201d wears traditionally feminine clothing which is\u00a0\u201ccritically important to A.H.\u2019s sense of self, gender expression,\u00a0and identity as a girl,\u201d according to the complaint. In March, A.H. wore a black dress to a regional band concert evaluation that followed the style and length requirements of the district\u2019s dress code for girls. But, according to the complaint, she was stopped by the school\u2019s principal who told her,\u00a0\u201cBoys can\u2019t wear skirts or dresses\u201d and later said, \u201cYou can\u2019t represent our school dressed like that.\u201d When presented with an ultimatum to have her mother bring \u201cboys\u2019 clothes\u201d or not be allowed to participate, A.H. chose to change into a button-down shirt and dress pants and continue with the concert. \u201cA.H. felt utterly humiliated to be seen in clothing that was inconsistent with her gender identity,\u201d said the complaint. The Harrison County School District enforces a sex-based dress code that requires students to \u201cfollow the dress attire consistent with their biological sex,\u201d according to the district\u2019s student\u00a0handbook. The complaint states the school board added\u00a0the \u201cbiological sex\u201d provision to the dress code during a July 2023 meeting \u201cin response to transgender and gender nonconforming students\u2019 complaints about not being permitted to wear clothing associated with their gender identity and/or expression at school-sponsored events.\u201d Last May, another Mississippi\u00a0transgender teen\u00a0in the same district missed her high school graduation after she was told she had to wear boys\u2019\u00a0clothing to attend, CNN previously reported. That teen went to Harrison Central High School, the same school as A.H., and was allegedly stopped by the same administrator over her clothing.\u00a0A federal judge denied a motion filed by her family, the\u00a0ACLU\u00a0and\u00a0ACLU\u00a0of\u00a0Mississippi\u00a0requesting to allow her to wear a dress and heels. CNN has reached out to the Harrison County School District for comment on the complaint and its accusations. A.H.\u2019s mother also alleges the school district has created a hostile environment for transgender and gender nonconforming students, detailing other instances of tension between students and administrators over the dress code. In one case, a gay cisgender\u00a0student who dresses in masculine-leaning attire, had her senior portrait excluded from the yearbook after wearing a tuxedo, according to the complaint, which cites a separate OCR complaint filed\u00a0by the\u00a0ACLU. Another student was \u201cpulled from the graduation line\u201d before she was set to receive her diploma for wearing black pants under her graduation robe, according to the complaint. \u201cI\u2019m deeply concerned about the discriminatory practices within Harrison County School District that have unfairly targeted my daughter, along with other students. Transgender and gender nonconforming students should not be forced to choose between participating in school events or remaining true to their gender identity,\u201d said A.H.\u2019s mother, Kimberly Hudson, in an\u00a0ACLU\u00a0statement. \u201cWe urge HCSD to take immediate steps to revise its dress code policies and create a more inclusive environment where all students can thrive.\u201d The family also requests the OCR open an investigation into the school district centered on\u00a0Title\u00a0IX,\u00a0which prohibits sex discrimination in any educational program or activity that receives federal financial assistance,\u00a0according to the complaint and\u00a0ACLU\u00a0statement. The landmark federal civil rights law is set to change on August 1. Last month, the Biden administration announced an\u00a0expansion of protections\u00a0for students, including those who\u00a0are LGBTQ+, to prohibit discrimination \u201cbased on sexual orientation, gender identity, and sex characteristics in federally funded education programs,\u201d according to a fact sheet shared with CNN. The move\u00a0formalizes a rule the administration previously proposed that would strengthen\u00a0Title\u00a0IX\u00a0protections for transgender students. In Mississippi and in\u00a0other states, LGBTQ+ students are seeing their rights being chipped away. On Monday, Mississippi\u2019s Republican Gov.\u00a0Tate Reeves signed a bill that requires people to use restrooms and housing\u00a0at public education institutions that corresponds to their gender assigned at birth. People will only be allowed to use housing or bathrooms based on their\u00a0\u201csex \u2018determined solely by\u00a0a\u00a0birth,\u2019 without regard to the fluidity of how someone acts or feels,\u201d\u00a0the\u00a0bill\u00a0states. Rob Hill, state director for the Human Rights Campaign Mississippi, said all Mississippians deserve\u00a0\u201ca state that allows them to exist in peace \u2013 and a government focused on making life better for all of us.\u201d \u201cInstead, Governor Reeves caved to MAGA politicians, stoking anti-trans panic, flinging the doors open to harassment and discrimination, and attempting to strip basic rights from LGBTQ+ people in our state.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/us/mississippi-aclu-lawsuit-transgender-teen-reaj/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/18/2024", "section": "us"}}

Bryan Maclean Howard, 41, faces eight charges of DUI manslaughter stemming from Tuesday\u2019s fatal crash, in which authorities said the 2001 Ford Ranger he was driving traveled toward the center line along Highway 40 west of Ocala and struck a bus carrying more than 50 farm workers. The bus left the roadway, went through a fence and overturned, according to the Florida Highway Patrol. In addition to the eight dead, at least 40 people were injured. Howard pleaded not guilty on Wednesday, online records show. He has been denied bond. CNN has reached out to the public defender\u2019s office for comment. The six\u00a0victims identified\u00a0in\u00a0the arrest\u00a0report were Evarado Ventura Hern\u00e1ndez, 30; Cristian Salazar Villeda, 24; Alfredo Tovar S\u00e1nchez, 20; Isa\u00edas Miranda Pascal, 21; Jos\u00e9 Heriberto Fraga Acosta, 27, and Manuel Perez R\u00edos, 46.

Howard said he did not remember how\u00a0the\u00a0accident\u00a0happened and he was \u201cdriving very carefully\u201d because he was\u00a0involved\u00a0in\u00a0the car\u00a0accident days\u00a0before,\u00a0the\u00a0report says. A prosecutor Wednesday asked the judge to deny bond, in part based on Howard\u2019s criminal history. She listed\u00a0a litany of convictions, many stemming from driving-related infractions and all confirmed by state court records, including that Howard was: \u2022 Found guilty in 2019 of leaving the scene of an accident with property damage \u2022 Twice convicted \u2013 in 2013 and 2018 \u2013 of driving while his license was suspended, canceled or revoked \u2022 Convicted of grand theft in 2013 \u2022 Convicted of leaving the scene of an accident in 2006 CNN has reached out for comment to the public defender\u2019s office.

{"id": "2024_05_16_us_lewiston-gunman-robert-card-family-testimony", "text": "In emotional testimony Thursday morning, family members of Robert Card, the man responsible for two shootings that left 18 people dead in Lewiston, Maine, testified before the independent commission formed to investigate the October 25, 2023, mass shootings. \u201cIf you were to ask me what one thing I would like for the commission to find and point out, it would be ultimately to get to the root cause of this tragedy. We can point fingers at who\u2019s at fault, who has failed to make the ultimate contact, but in all reality, we all could have done better \u2014 from the sheriff\u2019s office to the Army to the family,\u201d said James Herling, Card\u2019s brother-in-law. Documents shared with CNN by the Sagadahoc County Sheriff\u2019s Office showed Card\u2019s family had called the department as far back as May 2023, voicing concerns over his well-being and access to firearms. The US Army previously told CNN a health and wellness check was requested by the shooter\u2019s unit \u201cout of an abundance of caution after the unit became concerned for his safety.\u201d An independent review last year concluded the sheriff\u2019s office acted \u201creasonably\u201d but recommended improvements to the department\u2019s strategy. Card, a US Army reservist and certified firearms instructor, went on two shooting rampages at a bar and bowling alley in Lewiston, killing 18 people and wounding 13 others with an assault rifle. After a 48-hour manhunt following the shootings, Card was found dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head near a river some 10 miles from Lewiston. The Concussion Legacy Foundation said in March that tissue samples from Card\u2019s brain showed evidence of traumatic brain injury and suggested he had been exposed to \u201cthousands of low-level blasts\u201d during his time at an Army hand grenade training range. \u201cI am hoping that this commission will find that the DOD needs to enhance the protection of our soldiers because when they release them as civilians, they are releasing them without proper care,\u201d Herling said. \u201cThis is not an excuse for the behavior and action that Robbie committed. It was a wrongful act of evil. My brother-in-law was not this man. His brain was hijacked.\u201d Nicole Herling, Card\u2019s sister, testified about the \u201csignificant challenge\u201d to contact Card\u2019s chain of command in the Army for help when he began showing signs of mental illness. \u201cThe Department of Defense\u2019s negligence regarding traumatic brain injury must be addressed, and they must be held accountable for change,\u201d Nicole Herling said. \u201cIt\u2019s important to acknowledge that Robbie\u2019s decline involved other factors, and I\u2019m not here to excuse his behavior,\u201d she added. \u201cIf we appeared silent, it wasn\u2019t because we lacked empathy. We were in shock and disbelief, unable to comprehend that Robbie was capable of such horror.\u201d CNN has reached out to the Department of Defense for comment.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/16/us/lewiston-gunman-robert-card-family-testimony/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/18/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_05_15_us_nakba-day-anniversary-palestinians", "text": "Mohammad Zarqa trembled with fear as he watched panicked crowds of people, screaming and covered in blood, rush into his small village on the outskirts of Jerusalem. \u201cYou have to run,\u201d he remembers a woman crying out, shocking Zarqa out of a daze and sending him racing home to warn his family. He was only 12 years old at the time, unaware of the looming war that would soon upend his life. It was April 9, 1948, and Jewish militias had just attacked Deir Yassin, a village about a mile northeast of Zarqa\u2019s home in Ein Karem in what was then the British Mandate of Palestine. At least 100 people, including women and children, were killed \u2013 many stripped, lined up and shot with automatic fire, according to reports from the time archived by the United Nations. The massacre is among the events that led to al-Nakba, or \u201cthe catastrophe,\u201d when roughly 700,000 Palestinians fled or were expelled from their homes by armed Jewish groups seeking to establish the state of Israel. \u201cWe thought we were going to be next,\u201d Zarqa, now 88, tells CNN from his home in New Jersey. \u201cMy father said, \u2018We cannot stay here. They\u2019re going to come and massacre us.\u2019 We had nothing, no weapons, nothing to defend ourselves. That\u2019s the day we became refugees.\u201d On Wednesday, Zarqa joins millions of Palestinians across the world to mark Nakba Day with protests and community events intended to honor the memory of the Palestinians killed and displaced in 1948 and the brutal war unfolding today in Gaza. Part of that commemoration includes a commitment to storytelling, Zarqa says, whereby survivors of the Nakba generation continue to share their experiences with younger Palestinians so the dream of liberation and return never dies. He believes it\u2019s the only way to understand the current war and work toward a just and lasting peace in the region. \u201cMy heart is bleeding,\u201d he says softly. \u201cAt my age, I\u2019m still dreaming of going back home. Palestine is something that is still implanted in my heart and my body. It\u2019s where I was born. It\u2019s where I have my memories. It\u2019s my country.\u201d Yearning for home Zarqa, along with his parents and six siblings, fled Ein Karem on foot, taking very little with them. They walked from village to village, searching for food and sheltering in the homes and garages of kind strangers. The atrocities he witnessed along the way are seared in his memory. \u201cI saw the most horrific things in my life: women coming in with torn clothes and uncovered heads crying, screaming, saying that the Jews \u2013 they weren\u2019t called Israelis at the time \u2013 attacked their village and massacred everybody,\u201d Zarqa says. More than 15,000 Palestinians were killed and 531 towns and villages destroyed during al-Nakba, according to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics, an institute of the Palestinian Authority. Jewish leaders declared independence and the creation of the state of Israel on May 14, sparking a military response from Egypt, Syria and Jordan. The family hoped the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, as it would come to be known, would end in a swift victory for the Arabs. After several weeks, Zarqa\u2019s family returned to Ein Karem. But when they entered the village, they found it had been ransacked and its residents cast out by Jewish militias, Zarqa says. With nothing left to salvage, they fled to Jordan to wait out the war, he recalls. The family initially lived in squalor, surviving off the generosity of strangers and local mosques. They shared a home with other Palestinian refugees in Jabal Al Weibdeh, a neighborhood in Amman, Zarqa says. It had a dirt floor and there were no windows, doors or bathrooms. They often couldn\u2019t shower for months at a time. By March 1949, Israel had won the war and forbidden the hundreds of thousands of Palestinian refugees who had fled or were expelled from returning to their homes and ancestral lands. Zarqa\u2019s family was among them. The family began to build a new life in Jordan, one marked by struggle and poverty, as they patiently waited for permission to return to Ein Karem. But it never came, and decades later Zarqa found himself living in the United States \u2013 even further from his homeland \u2013 trying to raise a small family of his own. \u201cWe made a life in the US, but this still isn\u2019t home. You never forget that you had a house and somebody kicked you out of it,\u201d Zarqa says. \u201cWe will never stop wanting to return.\u201d A responsibility to teach Neither time nor distance has blurred Zarqa\u2019s memories of Palestine. He has passed onto his four children and eight grandchildren every bittersweet memory of Ein Karem, from its acres of orchards to the hilltop where he could see the mountains and Mediterranean sea in the distance. Zarqa remembers Ein Karem so vividly that despite his decades of absence, he was able to give his grandson, Zach Matari, who visited the village in 2019, directions over FaceTime to his old home, now in present-day Israel. An Israeli family is living there. \u201cI remember every inch of my village. If you go there I can tell you there was this apricot tree here, and there was a fig tree there, and that\u2019s the stairs we used to climb,\u201d he says. Jenan Matari, another one of his grandchildren, is a writer and social media influencer who uses her platform to educate followers about Palestinian history, culture and current events, including the war in Gaza. She loves listening to her grandfather\u2019s stories and says her work, which is rooted in his Nakba experience, is a form of resistance. All Palestinians in the diaspora, she says, should use their voices too. \u201cI get really sad for my grandfather, because if I\u2019m feeling triggered by the things that are happening in Gaza, and I\u2019m feeling this depleted and in so much pain watching this, I can only imagine what it\u2019s doing to him and his generation to watch what they lived through happening again, but on an even greater scale,\u201d Matari, 33, tells CNN. Talking about al-Nakba isn\u2019t easy, Zarqa confesses. He often pauses mid-sentence or changes the subject when it hurts a bit too much. But he refuses to be silenced by his grief and even invites other Nakba survivors to his home to share their experiences with family, friends and the wider community Dawud Assad, one of those survivors, lives just 10 miles away. He narrowly survived the Deir Yassin massacre, which he says claimed the lives of 47 family members, including his grandmother and 2-year-old brother. \u201cI was supposed to be dead,\u201d says Assad, who is now 92 and nicknamed Al-shaheed Al-hay, or \u201cthe living martyr.\u201d Assad survived by hiding in a shallow trench near his home, crouching and quietly praying for mercy as bullets grazed his hair. \u201cIt did not begin on October 7. What we went through is exactly what we\u2019re seeing now in Gaza and Rafah,\u201d Assad says, referring to Israel\u2019s ongoing war there. Videos of dead children are especially triggering because they remind him of his slain brother. Israel launched its war in Gaza after Hamas\u2019 brutal attack in Israel on October 7, in which 1,200 people were killed and hundreds of others taken hostage, Israeli officials say. In the seven months since that attack, Israel\u2019s bombing campaign and ground offensive in Gaza has killed more than 35,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health. It also has imposed a siege and razed entire communities, rendering nearly 90% of the population displaced and everyone food insecure. Israel says its military tactics are necessary to defeat Hamas and return the hostages. The International Court of Justice says it\u2019s \u201cplausible\u201d Israel is committing genocide, though a final ruling in the case could take years. Israel \u201cutterly rejects\u201d the allegation. For Zarqa and Assad, the war is reminiscent of the horrors they endured during al-Nakba, and it\u2019s important for them to draw that parallel for young Palestinians in the diaspora, as well as anyone else trying to make sense of the violence. \u201cAl-Nakba never ended,\u201d Zarqa says. They point to recent statements from Israeli officials that have alluded to another Nakba through suggestions of mass killing and displacement, or outright calling for it. In a November interview with Israel\u2019s Channel 12 news, Minister of Agriculture Avi Dichter described the war as \u201cthe Nakba of Gaza 2023.\u201d Following Dichter\u2019s comments, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reportedly urged ministers to choose their words more carefully. \u201cWe must be sensitive,\u201d he said, according to The Times of Israel. Hope for the future Zarqa\u2019s heart remains torn between nostalgia and grief as he concedes he may never again see his beloved Palestine, stroll through the quiet streets of Ein Karem or taste its delicious apricots. But he\u2019s sure his descendants will. There are some 5.9 million Palestinian refugees worldwide, most of them descendants of that 1948 generation of exiles, according to the United Nations. It is \u201cthe world\u2019s longest-standing protracted refugee crisis,\u201d the UN said at a 2023 event marking the 75th anniversary of al-Nakba as it urged a solution grounded in international law. While some countries, including the United States and United Kingdom, skipped the commemoration after Israel called for a boycott, Zarqa elsewhere sees hope: The anti-war protests taking over city streets and college campuses across the world. \u201cI am so proud of them,\u201d Zarqa says. \u201cYou pass on your stories to your children and then they carry the banner and continue to teach their children, and eventually their own grandchildren.\u201d \u201cPalestinians will never forget.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/us/nakba-day-anniversary-palestinians/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/18/2024", "section": "us"}}

{"id": "2024_05_17_business_uaw-mercedes-benz-rejected", "text": "Autoworkers at a Mercedes Benz plant in Alabama voted against joining the United Auto Workers union Friday, potentially stalling hopes of a rapidly growing organizing wave for autoworkers in the southern United States. The result was a close outcome. Out of the valid votes counted, 56% of workers voted \u201cno,\u201d while 44% voted \u201cyes\u201d for unionization, according to Mercedes-Benz. The National Labor Relations Board said Friday there were more than 5,000 eligible voters. The UAW was hoping to carry its strong momentum with the Alabama vote, as its decision to use a\u00a0\u201cstand up strike\u201d strategy,\u00a0hitting the Big Three automakers all at once, brought unprecedented attention and record contracts for workers. And last month, it won a union election at a\u00a0Volkswagen plant in Chattanooga, Tennessee, its first victory in three attempts to organize the factory. Under relatively new UAW president Shawn Fain, the UAW had shifted its strategy for a membership push in non-unionized factories, many of which are located in the American South. In a March interview with Car and Driver, Fain said the profit margins for the Japanese, Korean and German automakers\u00a0were \u201cobscenely more gross than they were at the Big Three, and yet their workers get less.\u201d \u201cI truly believe we\u2019re going to see a huge shift this year. I think we\u2019re gonna win in the South,\u201d\u00a0he said in the interview. In a press conference Friday, however, Fain said that losses are part of the process and that the union will \u201ccarry on and keep on fighting.\u201d \u201cNot the result we wanted today, but I\u2019m very proud of these workers. We keep our heads up and we march on,\u201d Fain said. In an emailed statement Friday, Fain said the Alabama workers \u201cwon serious gains in this campaign.\u201d Fain said they raised wages with the \u201cUAW bump,\u201d which is when non-union companies gave non-unionized employees raises to compete with union contracts. Mercedes-Benz also named a new Alabama CEO ahead of the election. Fain said Mercedes encouraged workers to give the new CEO a chance before elections. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what Volkswagen told its workers in 2019. And in 2024, Volkswagen workers realized it\u2019s not about a CEO. It\u2019s about a voice on the job, it\u2019s about getting our lives back, and getting our time back. The only path to do that is through a union contract,\u201d he wrote. In a statement, Mercedes-Benz US International said that \u201cour goal throughout this process was to ensure every eligible Team Member had the opportunity to participate in a fair election.\u201d \u201cAt MBUSI, our primary focus is always to provide a safe and supportive work environment for our Team Members, so they can build superior vehicles for the world. We look forward to continuing to work directly with our Team Members to ensure MBUSI is not only their employer of choice, but a place they would recommend to friends and family,\u201d the statement continued. Workers faced pressure Six southern governors from Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Texas issued\u00a0a joint statement in April discouraging the union campaign, warning it could put workers\u2019 jobs, as well as the auto industry in the South, in jeopardy. The statement came a day before workers at Volkswagen voted on joining the UAW. \u201cThe reality is companies have choices when it comes to where to invest and bring jobs and opportunity. We have worked tirelessly on behalf of our constituents to bring good-paying jobs to our states. These jobs have become part of the fabric of the automotive manufacturing industry,\u201d the statement\u00a0said. In a statement Friday, Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey said that \u201cautomotive manufacturing is one of Alabama\u2019s crown jewel industries\u201d and that the state is \u201ccommitted to keeping it that way.\u201d \u201cThe workers in Vance have spoken, and they have spoken clearly! Alabama is not Michigan, and we are not the Sweet Home to the UAW,\u201d Ivey said in the statement. Mercedes allegedly pushed back against unionization efforts in other ways, according to the UAW. The National Labor Relations Board said it is investigating six unfair labor practice allegations filed by the UAW against Mercedes-Benz since March. Those accusations from the UAW allege Mercedes disciplined employees for discussing unionization during work, prohibited distribution of union materials, surveilled employees, and forced employees to attend \u201ccaptive audience meetings,\u201d which is a mandatory meeting during work hours meant to discourage unionizing. Mercedes-Benz US International denied these claims, and said in a statement it \u201chas not interfered with or retaliated against any Team Member in their right to pursue union representation.\u201d It continued, \u201cWe do not believe these claims have merit and we look forward to presenting our case to the NLRB.\u201d Organizing the South The UAW\u00a0said it began an effort to organize workers at 13 non-union auto US factories in November 2023. The effort included three US-based electric vehicle makers \u2014 Tesla, Rivian and Lucid \u2014 as well as 10 foreign automakers that build cars in the US \u2014 BMW, Honda, Hyundai, Mazda, Mercedes, Nissan, Subaru, Toyota, Volkswagen, and Volvo. The South has been an attractive region for foreign automakers to open plants because of generous tax breaks and cheaper, non-union labor that generally doesn\u2019t receive the wages or benefits won by unionized workers. But last month, hourly workers at Volkswagen\u2019s plant in Chattanooga, Tennessee, overwhelmingly voted to join the UAW \u2014 73% of the 3,600 workers at the plant who cast ballots had voted to join the union. The Chattanooga victory didn\u2019t come easy for the UAW. Volkswagen didn\u2019t win until its third union drive, said Art Wheaton, director of labor studies at\u00a0Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations\u2019 Buffalo office. This was the Mercedes plant\u2019s first strong push, and labor experts say a loss at Mercedes isn\u2019t the end of the push to organize the South. \u201cIt\u2019s not a catastrophe if they don\u2019t win (the first time). Primarily because they\u2019re facing a very active Mercedes Benz trying to block them from organizing, you got governors in the South trying to block them from organizing, and they don\u2019t have the same track record or history or infrastructure in Alabama,\u201d Wheaton said to CNN earlier this week. In a press conference Friday, Fain said the difference between Mercedes and Volkswagen was that \u201cVolkswagen was more neutral.\u201d \u201cUntil we can have an absolute, neutral, free and fair election\u2026 This is the fight we have to take on,\u201d Fain said. There are about 150,000 workers at nonunion auto plants in the United States today. That\u2019s roughly the same amount of workers represented at the Big Three. Since 1990, the South\u2019s share of auto jobs has doubled from around 15% to 30% today, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. Meanwhile, the Midwest\u2019s share has declined from 60% to 45%. \u201cIt\u2019s not horrible if they lose, because it gives the UAW\u00a0the chance to see where they\u2019re at. They can gauge how much support they have,\u201d Wheaton said.
