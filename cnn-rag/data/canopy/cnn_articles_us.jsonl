{"id": "2024_06_24_business_boeing-doj-criminal-faa-737-max", "text": "Prosecutors are urging the US Justice Department to file criminal charges against Boeing for safety issues surrounding its 737 Max, although top Justice Department officials haven\u2019t made a final decision, a source familiar with the development tells CNN. The possible criminal charges are just the latest severe blow to the reputation of Boeing, a company once known for the quality and safety of its commercial jets. Beyond two fatal crashes of the 737 Max in 2018 and 2019, the company has faced a series of questions about the safety and quality of its jets. In January, a door plug on a 737 Max flown by Alaska Air blew out early in a flight, leaving a gaping hole in the side of the jet, further damaging Boeing\u2019s reputation. The Justice Department and Boeing had reached an agreement in January of 2021 to settle charges that alleged the company defrauded the Federal Aviation Administration during the certification process of the 737 Max before it could carry its first passengers. The plane started service in 2017, but suffered two fatal crashes \u2013 in October 2018 and March of 2019 \u2013 which led to a 20-month grounding of the jet. The cause of the crashes proved to be a design flaw, Boeing has admitted. The 2021 settlement would have spared Boeing any criminal liability despite the Justice Department\u2019s statement at that time that \u201cmisleading statements, half-truths, and omissions communicated by Boeing employees to the FAA\u201d had hidden potential problems with the the design flaw. Reuters first reported the charging recommendation. Boeing declined to comment on that report earlier Monday, nor did it have any comment when reached again Monday evening. Boeing has told prosecutors that it will contest claims that it violated the 2021 deal. Some family members of the crash victims and members of Congress harshly criticized the 2021 deal, known as a deferred prosecution agreement, which spared Boeing from criminal charges at that time. And this month a group of those family members wrote a letter to the Justice Department urging Boeing be hit with the maximum possible $24.9 billion fine. The letter they wrote to the Justice department called Boeing\u2019s actions \u201cthe deadliest corporate crime in U.S. history.\u201d Boeing had just over $6.9 billion cash on hand as of its last quarterly earnings statement in late March. The 2021 deferred prosecution agreement was due to expire this past January, freeing Boeing from the risk of criminal liability. But just days before that deadline expired, the Alaska Air incident happened. The charges against Boeing don\u2019t mean any Boeing executive will face charges as an individual. But it could add to the company\u2019s deep financial problems. It has posted core operating losses of $31.9 billion since the start of the 20-month grounding of the 737 Max that followed its second fatal crash in 2019. The company is at risk of losing its investment grade credit rating for the first time in its history. If its debt falls into junk bond status, its cost of borrowing money that it needs to cover losses will soar. At its most extreme, Boeing could be found ineligible to do business with the federal government if found guilty of a crime. That would be an virtual death sentence for Boeing, which gets 37% of its revenue in 2023 from US government contracts. But such a penalty is highly unlikely for reasons of national security, since most of those contracts are with the Department of Defense. But if the company faces criminal charges, a new settlement is the most likely outcome. And such a settlement would likely include some manner of additional oversight of the company\u2019s operations, perhaps in the form of a federal monitor, said Richard Aboulafia, managing director at AeroDynamic Advisory, an aerospace and defense management consultant.

Lukas McClish, 34, set out for what he thought would be a three-hour hike in the Santa Cruz Mountains on June 11, according to CNN affiliate KGO. But he became lost in the mountains \u2013 partially due to the destruction of local landmarks in recent wildfires. His family officially reported him missing when he didn\u2019t show up for a Father\u2019s Day dinner on June 16, triggering search and rescue efforts, KGO reported. McClish was eventually found on Thursday thanks to a drone from the Santa Cruz Sheriff\u2019s Office, according to an X post from Cal Fire San Mateo, which said McClish was found in Big Basin Redwoods State Park \u2013 California\u2019s oldest state park and home to towering ancient coast redwood trees. \u201cThere were multiple reports of witnesses hearing someone yelling for help, but the location of that person was hard to establish,\u201d said Cal Fire. McClish was found with \u201cno major injuries and was reunited with his family,\u201d according to the sheriff\u2019s office. Speaking with KGO, McClish said he was \u201ctired and a little sore\u201d after his ordeal. \u201cI lost my voice,\u201d he added. All he had to survive in the forest were the clothes he was wearing when he left: \u201cI left with just a pair of pants, and my pair of hiking shoes, and a hat,\u201d he told KGO. \u201cI had a flashlight, and a pair of folding scissors, like a Leatherman tool. And that was about it.\u201d He attributed his survival to drinking lots of water from creeks and waterfalls he found as he hiked through the park each day, calling for help, according to CNN affiliate KSBW. \u201cI just make sure I drank a gallon of water every day, but then after, getting close to the end of it, my body needed food and some kind of sustenance,\u201d McClish told KGO. Seeing the number of search and rescue workers who worked to find him was \u201creally humbling,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was an awesome experience.\u201d Correction: An earlier version of this story misidentified a CNN affiliate that reported on Lukas McClish\u2019s disappearance.

{"id": "2024_06_22_us_stoic-philosophers-election-anxiety-cec", "text": "Some people obsessively monitor presidential election polls. Others ignore any political news like an overdue bill. And a few probably wish they could just press a button and fast-forward past this November. Americans have devised all sorts of strategies to deal with the unrelenting stress of this year\u2019s presidential race. The rematch between President Biden and former President Trump has been called \u201cthe most dreaded election in modern political history.\u201d As the two rivals prepare to debate on Thursday, about six in 10 American adults say they are already\u00a0worn out\u00a0by campaign coverage. But there\u2019s another way to cope with anxiety about the future \u2014 by turning to the past. Mention the\u00a0Stoic philosophers\u00a0of ancient Greece and Rome, and it may conjure images of\u00a0boring, bearded White men in togas who lived thousands of years ago. But sages like\u00a0Epictetus\u00a0and\u00a0Marcus Aurelius\u00a0offer plenty of practical advice for today\u2019s voters who are navigating the relentless grind of this year\u2019s presidential election. Stoic philosophy, which\u00a0teaches\u00a0that it is impossible to live a happy life without living virtuously, also talks a lot about confronting one\u2019s worse fears. The definition of Stoicism varies, but bestselling author\u00a0Ryan Holiday\u00a0describes it as the a \u201ctool in the pursuit of self-mastery, perseverance and wisdom.\u201d The first Stoic school was founded in Athens by a philosopher named\u00a0Zeno\u00a0of Citium around the beginning of the 3rd\u00a0century BC. Zeno, who lost his entire fortune in a shipwreck, found consolation in philosophy. He later quipped, \u201cMy most profitable journey began on the day I was shipwrecked and lost my entire fortune.\u201d We too can begin such a journey, Holiday says. He says that like us, the Stoics also knew something about dealing with loss, political instability and living in a time when many people felt politically powerless. He cites Aurelius, a Stoic follower who became one of Rome\u2019s greatest emperors. He led Rome during a\u00a0global pandemic\u00a0that killed at least 10 million people and grappled constantly with war and murderous political divisions. \u201cAurelius experienced this devastating global pandemic that ravaged society,\u201d says Holiday, who just released\u00a0\u201cRight Thing, Right Now,\u201d\u00a0the third installment in his bestselling book series on Stoic virtues. \u00a0\u201cBut he would have also seen what it [the pandemic] did to people: the tribalism, the fear, the anger along with the flights of fancy. He saw everything that we just saw over the last couple of years.\u201d CNN talked to Holiday and\u00a0Massimo Pigliucci, author of \u201cHow to Be a Stoic: Using Ancient Philosophy to Live a Modern Life.\u201d Both authors, through books, videos and podcasts, are two of the most popular modern-day interpreters of Stoicism. They offered three pieces of Stoic advice for handling the anxiety of this year\u2019s election. Don\u2019t let the future destroy the present It pays to look ahead in the world of politics. Pollsters predict trends. Pundits gauge the potential impact of political gaffes. Party leaders assess the implications of court decisions. Worry about the future is constant. That type of worry, though, spreads like a contagion to voters. People obsess about what will happen to them if the wrong candidate is elected. Some fixate on nightmare scenarios about the country descending into civil war. This grinding anxiety echoes Shakespeare\u2019s famous\u00a0line\u00a0from \u201cJulius Caesar\u201d: \u201cA coward dies a thousand times, a hero dies but once.\u201d Stoics only die once, though, because they reject fixating on the future. Stoicism teaches people to separate what they can control from what they cannot. Their advice: don\u2019t become engulfed by nightmare political scenarios that may or may not come to pass. \u201cThe Stoics say that he who suffers before it is necessary, suffers more than is necessary,\u201d Holiday says. \u201cThe idea that you should wake up every day in miserable anticipation of a thing that may or may not happen is to punish yourself on top of whatever the pain that will come from that thing actually happening,\u201d Holiday says. Pigliucci says Stoics coped with the political turbulence of their day by focusing on what they could control: their emotions. He cites the\u00a0Serenity Prayer,\u00a0which is often recited at 12-step programs. The prayer is attributed to\u00a0Reinhold Niebuhr, a towering Christian theologian from the 20th century, and asks God to \u201cgrant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, courage to change the things I can, and wisdom to know the difference.\u201d \u201cSeems like excellent advice for the upcoming presidential elections,\u201d Pigliucci\u00a0says. \u201cHave the courage to do your duty as a citizen; vote, maybe send money or volunteer for a campaign; then accept the outcome because it will be what it will be.\u201d Don\u2019t be too cynical to get involved Maybe you\u2019ve met this type of person. They don\u2019t vote because they say it won\u2019t make a difference.\u00a0 You might hear them in a barbershop or perched on a barstool, griping.\u00a0All politicians are corrupt. The\u00a0Illuminati\u00a0control everything. Pass me a beer. Some people deal with the anxiety of the election by checking out of politics altogether. The ancient Athenians had a word for citizens that refused to exercise their right to vote. They called them\u00a0\u201cidiotai,\u201d\u00a0from which the word \u201cidiot\u201d is derived. Many Stoic leaders would never be labeled as \u201cidiotai.\u201d They were passionately involved in politics and the pursuit of justice. That may surprise people. Stoics get a bad rap because of the way the way the word is\u00a0defined: someone \u201cindifferent to pain or pleasure,\u201d not showing \u201cpassion or feeling.\u201d But ancient Stoic leaders would have been at home jousting on Sunday morning political talk shows or marching in a Black Lives Matter protest. Holiday says Aurelius wrote constantly about justice in his classic book,\u00a0\u201cMeditations.\u201d \u201cHe talks about the\u00a0common good\u00a0more than 80 times in \u2018Meditations,\u201d\u00a0 Holiday says. \u201cHe talks about it more than just about anything. He actually says the whole purpose of life is good character and acts for the common good.\u201d The stereotype of the dispassionate, uninvolved Stoic is \u201cas wrong as it could possibly be,\u201d Holiday says. \u201cIf you look at the actual lives of Stoics, these are people who got married, had families, ran for public office and fought for causes,\u201d Holiday says. \u201cThere was a generation of Stoics that were such a perpetual thorn in the side of emperors that they were known as the\u00a0Stoic Opposition.\u00a0At one point, all of them are kicked out of Rome because they won\u2019t go along to get along.\u201d Cynicism can be masked cowardice \u2014 some cynics are afraid of the risks that come with getting involved. But the Stoic leaders were known for their courage in standing up to political tyrants. Pigliucci tells a famous\u00a0story\u00a0about political courage that centers on \u00a0Helvidius Priscus,\u00a0a Stoic philosopher. When the Roman emperor Vespasian threatened\u00a0Priscus, the Stoic philosopher, with execution for speaking out against political tyranny, Priscus responded by saying: \u201cWell, when have I ever claimed to you that I\u2019m immortal? You fulfill your role, and I\u2019ll fulfill mine. It is yours to have me killed, and mine to die without a tremor; it is yours to send me into exile, and mine to depart without a qualm.\u201d Be kind, even to your political enemies It\u2019s hard not to be cynical when it comes to US presidential politics. Candidates brazenly lie on the campaign trail. Partisan websites and social media platforms spread so much disinformation that\u2019s hard to know what to believe. Politicians who once loudly opposed certain candidates now bend the knee to curry their favor. It\u2019s easy for our dislike for our political opponents to morph into hatred. But Holiday suggests we consider how Aurelius dealt with political treachery in his time.\u00a0 Aurelius survived an attempted coup from his most trusted general. He had unlimited power and could have devised an array of sadistic measures to torment or kill his traitor. \u00a0But he refused to do so. \u201cIn fact, he wept when he was deprived of the chance to grant clemency to his former enemy,\u201d Holiday writes in an\u00a0essay\u00a0on Aurelius. \u201cThe best revenge, Marcus would write \u201cis to not be like that.\u201d When family or friends insult you or stop talking to you because of a political disagreement, it\u2019s easy to respond in kind. The Stoics, though, have two words of advice, Holiday says: Be kind. That may sound na\u00efve when personal attacks have become the norm in modern-day politics and this year\u2019s presidential race. But Epictetus\u00a0said\u00a0that \u201cAny person capable of angering you becomes your master.\u201d \u201cThe Stoics said we should try to see every person we meet as an opportunity for kindness,\u201d Holiday writes in his new book. Holiday says that when Aurelius was on his deathbed, he had one regret: He was still chastising himself over the times he had had lost his temper and been unkind to others. Holiday says he\u2019s had to apply that Stoic advice to his own personal life.\u00a0He has risen in prominence in part because he\u2019s sold a\u00a0reported\u00a06 million books on Stoicism. He\u2019s also built a mini-empire around Stoicism that includes YouTube videos, an Instagram feed and a Stoic newsletter. His elevated public profile has led to some personal challenges. He says he and his family have been constantly harassed because they have taken stands against book banning, in support of women\u2019s rights, and for the removal of Confederate monuments. A friend betrayed him. Holiday says a younger version of himself would have \u201cwanted blood\u201d for those who have tried to hurt him. Instead he considered the actions of Stoic leaders like Aurelius, drawing a direct link between the \u201cdark energy\u201d that the Stoic leaders faced in their time and what he sees in the 2024 presidential election cycle. \u201cThere is this energy across all societies that is driven by hatred, fear, and that wants to protect what it has and prevent other people from getting their piece of it,\u201d Holiday tells CNN. \u201cAnd that energy was certainly there in Roman times. \u201c But solutions to that dark energy are there, too. Stoic leaders may seem like distant figures encased in marble, but we can learn from them, Holiday says. They wrestled with and ultimately defeated the same dark energy that drove the political tribalization of their day. So can we.

{"id": "2024_06_21_us_california-alameda-county-jury-notes", "text": "Lance Clark was 9 years old when he was shot dead in a robbery. A man named Ernest Dykes was convicted of the 1993 Oakland murder and sentenced to death. But the boy\u2019s family says prosecutors just told them\u00a0Dykes\u202fcould\u202fbe released from prison in nine months to a year. \u201cLance was a happy, funny, loving, sweet little boy,\u201d his sisters told CNN in a family statement. \u201cHe was robbed of a future.\u201d Dykes might be released because, while preparing for his appeal, an Alameda County deputy district attorney found in the dusty case files some handwritten notes about potential jurors from the trial back in the 1990s. One potential juror in the Dykes case file is described as a \u201cShort, fat troll.\u201d Like other Black potential jurors \u2013 and only Black potential jurors \u2013 her race is noted. The letters \u201cFB\u201d are written next to her name, apparently noting her gender and race. \u201cMust go,\u201d is written next to the name of a Black man, who is described as \u201cMB.\u201d Another juror has the word \u201cJewish\u201d underlined on their questionnaire. Farther down, a handwritten note reads: \u201cI liked him better than any other Jew. But no way.\u201d There were no Black or Jewish jurors seated at the trial. \u201cWhen you have serious prosecutorial misconduct, that means that the conviction is a wrongful conviction,\u201d said current Alameda County District Attorney Pamela Price. \u201cAnd so, it\u2019s a question of whether or not we\u2019re able to negotiate a resolution, or whether we have to go back to trial.\u201d Brian Pomerantz, current counsel for Dykes, could only speculate about what prejudices prosecutors could have had about certain groups. \u201cBlack people don\u2019t like police. So, they\u2019re more defense-oriented,\u201d he said when asked why prosecutors might have tried to keep Black people off juries in death penalty cases. \u201cObviously, I think that\u2019s a generalization that shouldn\u2019t be made,\u201d he added. \u201cI\u2019ve heard a couple of different things,\u201d said Pomerantz when asked why prosecutors might not have wanted Jewish jurors seated. \u201cThere\u2019s a thought that perhaps Jewish jurors would not want to send someone to a gas chamber,\u201d he said, recalling the genocide of Jews in the Holocaust. \u201cThe other was, they just thought Jewish jurors were more liberal.\u201d \u2018Pattern of serious misconduct\u2019 Federal Judge\u202fVince Chhabria, who was alerted to the prosecutors\u2019 notes after being assigned the appeal by Dykes last year, believes they are evidence of a much wider issue. \u201cIn prior decades, prosecutors from this office were engaged in a pattern of serious misconduct \u2013 automatically excluding Jewish and African American jurors from death penalty cases,\u201d he wrote in a court order. He has ordered the DA\u2019s office to review 35 cases dating from the mid-1980s through 2007. Among those cases are convicted mass shooters, serial killers, rapists and murderers. Pomerantz has begun looking through those files as he works on his cases for Dykes and other clients. \u201cIn almost all the cases we\u2019ve seen lists like this,\u201d he said, pointing to the letters \u2018MB\u2019 and \u2018FB\u2019 next to the names of potential jurors in a number of different cases, involving defendants of different races. A misspelled homophobic slur is used to describe another person in the jury pool. Pomerantz showed documents he says prove that jurors were being racially profiled and struck as late as 2008. Prosecutors, by\u202flaw,\u202fcannot exclude jurors because of race, ethnicity, gender or sexuality. District Attorney Price, who took office last year, would not comment on the claim of Dykes\u2019 impending release. Earlier, she told CNN: \u201cMr. Dykes has spent 31 years behind bars and so he has paid a price for that crime.\u201d Pomerantz believes that some of those sentenced to death might now be freed. \u201cFor some, that may be the solution,\u201d he said. \u201dAnd for some that should be the solution.\u201d Like Mark Schmeck, a client who Pomerantz believes is innocent but was sentenced to death for the killing of Lorin Germaine during an armed robbery in the mid-1980s. \u201cHe was a fun dad,\u201d Germaine\u2019s daughter, who asked to remain anonymous for her safety, told CNN. \u201cHe would always take us fishing and camping\u2026 mom worked swing shift, so he was the guy home at night\u2026 he, he even was the tooth fairy. I caught him. Once.\u201d Schmeck claims he is innocent in Germaine\u2019s death and Pomerantz is petitioning for his release, claiming he did not get a fair trial.\u202fAnd that terrifies Germaine\u2019s daughter. \u201cI don\u2019t know why,\u201d she said. \u201cJust that somebody out there like hurt my dad and then he\u2019s gonna be out there and who\u2019s to say he\u2019s not gonna hurt me.\u201d \u2018There had to be knowledge\u2019 Price and Pomerantz believe there has been a decades-long cover-up of jury tampering within the Alameda County DA\u2019s office. \u201cThere does not appear to have been any accountability, or certainly no investigation to determine how widespread the practice was.\u201d Price said. \u201cThere had to be knowledge.\u201d In 2003, during an appeal of a death penalty conviction, John Quatman, a former deputy DA, testified that a judge \u201csaid I could not have a Jew on the jury.\u201d He went on, \u201cIt was standard practice to exclude Jewish jurors in death cases: as it was to exclude African-American women from capital juries.\u201d \u201cIt is ironic they didn\u2019t want me on the jury,\u201d said Price, who is Black. \u201cAnd now I\u2019m the district attorney.\u201d A number of prosecutors who worked in the office testified in 2003 that Quatman\u2019s claims were untrue, and some have told CNN that potential jurors were never racially profiled. According to Price, one of the prosecuting attorneys involved in jury selection on the Dykes case was Morris Jacobson, who now serves as a judge in Alameda County. Asked if it is Jacobson\u2019s handwriting on those jury notes Price said, \u201cWe don\u2019t know that for sure.\u201d It is also not known if it was definitely a prosecutor who wrote the notes. Judge Jacobson declined CNN\u2019s request for an interview. A CNN crew waited outside his courthouse in Berkeley one day hoping to ask him some questions. Jacobson, a source said, knew they were outside but did not come out for at least two hours after his hearings had ended for the day. Colton Carmine was the chief prosecutor on the Dykes case. He is now retired and could not be reached for comment. A problem in America, not just Alameda \u201cThis is one of the most liberal counties in America. This is where Berkeley is. If this is happening there, what\u2019s happening everywhere else?\u201d said Pomerantz. Studies have found patterns of racial bias in jury selection from California and Washington to Connecticut and New York as well as the Deep South. One of the Alameda County cases that Pomerantz has reviewed is that of Franklin Lynch, known as \u201cThe Day Stalker.\u201d He was convicted of killing three elderly women in 1987 and sentenced to death. \u201cYou see the B circled,\u201d said Pomerantz pointing to notes on potential jurors at Lynch\u2019s trial. He also pointed to \u20181/2 B\u2019 written twice on one person\u2019s form. \u201cThey were so concerned about that person even being half Black,\u201d he said, \u201cthat they flagged it not once\u2026 but twice.\u201d \u201cThis is a tragedy on all levels,\u201d Pomerantz said. \u201cThere are victims, families who are suffering because now these cases 30 years later are, are coming back through this situation. That\u2019s incredibly unfair. It is wrong that these prosecutors did this this way and that now people are going to suffer for it\u2026 It\u2019s also wrong when Franklin Lynch doesn\u2019t get a fair trial.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/21/us/california-alameda-county-jury-notes/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/25/2024", "section": "us"}}

{"id": "2024_06_08_us_rust-shooting-timeline-alec-baldwin", "text": "The actor Alec Baldwin and several crew members gathered in a church at a New Mexico ranch on October 21, 2021, to rehearse a scene from their upcoming Western film \u201cRust.\u201d Then came the unexpected gunshot. A promising cinematographer was killed, a director was wounded and a film production was left in shambles. Since that day\u2019s fatal shooting of 42-year-old Halyna Hutchins, the film\u2019s armorer and its assistant director have been convicted of criminal charges. And after some back-and-forth legal arguments, Baldwin soon is set to stand trial on charges of involuntary manslaughter. The details of what happened that day have been made public in affidavits, probable cause statements, interviews with the main participants and testimony at criminal trials. Here\u2019s a timeline of the on-set shooting and the resulting legal cases. The shooting May 29, 2020: Baldwin, the three-time Emmy winner for his roles on \u201c30 Rock\u201d and \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d was announced as producer and star of the Western feature film \u201cRust,\u201d based on a story by Baldwin and Joel Souza, Deadline reported. In the film, Baldwin plays a grizzled outlaw on the run from authorities with his 13-year-old grandson. October 6, 2021: Filming of \u201cRust\u201d began at Bonanza Creek Ranch, a movie set outside Santa Fe, New Mexico. October 20, 2021: Several crew members walked off set, citing safety concerns. One crew member stated there had been two accidental weapons discharges and a special effects mess-up that set off explosives around the crew between takes. October 21, 2021: Hannah Gutierrez Reed, the armorer for \u201cRust,\u201d loaded a prop six-shot revolver with what she believed were \u201cdummy\u201d rounds, a term for ammo that contains no explosive elements but appear to be real, according to investigators and her defense attorney. Baldwin and several crew members began rehearsing a scene in a rustic church on set before breaking for lunch. After the break, Baldwin, Souza, Hutchins and a few others returned to the church for rehearsal. Assistant director Dave Halls fetched a prop gun from a cart outside the church and yelled \u201ccold gun,\u201d indicating it was unloaded. He then handed the gun to Baldwin. Baldwin practiced a \u201ccross draw\u201d \u2013 pulling a gun from a holster on the opposite side of his body from his draw hand. The scene required him to point the gun toward the camera, helmed by Hutchins, Souza and a camera operator. Suddenly, they heard a loud bang. Hutchins stumbled backward, slumped to the floor clutching her stomach and said she couldn\u2019t feel her legs. Souza, who had been standing beside her, noticed blood on his shoulder. At 1:48 p.m., the crew reported the shooting to emergency responders. Hutchins was transported by air helicopter to the hospital and was pronounced dead at 3:37 p.m. Souza was treated at the hospital, and a projectile from a live round was removed from his back. Sheriff\u2019s deputies arrived to the scene and began investigating the series of events leading to the shooting. October 22, 2021: Baldwin released a statement calling the death a \u201ctragic accident\u201d and said he is fully cooperating with the police investigation. December 2, 2021: In an interview with ABC, Baldwin said he cocked the gun and let go of the hammer, and the gun then fired. He said he was aiming the gun just to the side of the camera toward Hutchins, as she instructed him to do. \u201cI would never point a gun at anyone and then pull the trigger, never,\u201d he said. The investigations August 14, 2022: FBI testing of the firearm found it could not be fired without pulling the trigger while the gun was cocked, according to a forensics report. The report noted the gun eventually malfunctioned during FBI testing after internal parts fractured, causing the gun to go off in the cocked position without pulling the trigger. August 20, 2022: In an interview with CNN, Baldwin\u00a0placed responsibility\u00a0for Hutchins\u2019 death on Gutierrez Reed, the film armorer and props assistant, and on assistant director Halls, who handed him the gun. October 5, 2022: The family of Hutchins and Baldwin reached an undisclosed settlement in a wrongful death lawsuit filed against the actor and others. As part of the settlement, Matthew Hutchins, the cinematographer\u2019s widower, was named an executive producer on \u201cRust.\u201d January 19, 2023: Prosecutors announced Baldwin and Gutierrez Reed will be charged with involuntary manslaughter in Hutchins\u2019 death. Halls, the assistant director, agreed to plead no contest to negligent use of a deadly weapon, the district attorney\u2019s office announced. The terms of that deal include six months of probation\u00a0and a suspended sentence, prosecutors said. January 31, 2023: Baldwin and Gutierrez Reed were formally charged with involuntary manslaughter. February 23, 2023: Baldwin pleaded not guilty to manslaughter charges and was released on personal recognizance. April 20, 2023: New Mexico special prosecutors dismissed the charges against Baldwin, citing \u201cnew facts\u201d in the case. \u201cThis decision does not absolve Mr. Baldwin of criminal culpability and charges may be refiled,\u201d they said. August 9, 2023: Gutierrez Reed pleaded not guilty to involuntary manslaughter and tampering with evidence. January 19: Baldwin was indicted by a grand jury on charges of involuntary manslaughter. January 31: Baldwin pleaded not guilty to involuntary manslaughter charges for the second time. February 22: The trial of film armorer Gutierrez Reed began. Prosecutors alleged her failures allowed six live bullets to make their way on set, and she did not make vital safety checks that would have caught the problem. Her defense blamed Baldwin for failing to follow common-sense gun safety rules and on the film\u2019s production team for creating a chaotic and unsafe environment. March 1: Souza, the director and screenwriter, testified about the moment he was shot on set while standing behind Hutchins. March 6: Gutierrez Reed was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter after jurors deliberated for nearly three hours. She was acquitted of a charge of evidence tampering. April 15: At her sentencing hearing, Gutierrez Reed said \u201cmy heart aches\u201d for Hutchins\u2019 family and friends, and she asked the judge to sentence her to probation. The judge criticized her statement and sentenced her to the maximum 18 months in prison, saying, \u201cYou alone turned a safe weapon into a lethal weapon.\u201d May 24: A New Mexico judge denied Baldwin\u2019s motion to dismiss the involuntary manslaughter indictment. Baldwin\u2019s attorneys had accused prosecutors of misconduct during the grand jury process. June 3: New Mexico prosecutors asked the court to grant use immunity to Gutierrez Reed and compel her to testify at Baldwin\u2019s trial, according to court documents. Gutierrez Reed invoked her Fifth Amendment right to silence in a pre-trial interview, and prosecutors said if she is not granted immunity then she would not be able to testify in the trial. Gutierrez Reed\u2019s attorney, Jason Bowles, told CNN he will oppose the motion. June 17: Prosecutors signal their intention to portray Baldwin as repeatedly flouting safety protocols on the movie set in the days before the fatal shooting, according to\u00a0a new court filing. Outlining evidence they intend to present, prosecutors highlighted repeated instances in which Baldwin allegedly acted dangerously between October 12 and October 21, 2021. One of\u00a0Baldwin\u2019s attorneys, Luke Nikas, had no comment about the prosecution\u2019s document, but referred CNN to the defense\u2019s most recent filing asking the court again to dismiss the indictment and accusing the prosecution of selected disclosure of evidence. June 21: Judge Mary Marlowe Sommer denied a defense motion asking the court to dismiss the involuntary manslaughter indictment. The defense argued the shooting death was an accident and Baldwin is \u201cnot criminally liable.\u201d The prosecution countered Baldwin is experienced in the movie business and knew he was handling a real gun. A separate motion to dismiss \u2013 in which Baldwin\u2019s team argued the gun used in the shooting was destroyed during forensic testing by the FBI, preventing the defense from recreating the testing \u2013 will be considered at a hearing next week. The judge also denied the prosecution\u2019s motion to grant use immunity to Gutierrez Reed to compel her to testify at Baldwin\u2019s trial.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/08/us/rust-shooting-timeline-alec-baldwin/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/25/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_24_tech_riaa-lawsuit-ai-copyright-infringement", "text": "A group of major record labels is suing two AI startups, alleging they wrongfully used popular artists\u2019 work to train their systems to produce copyrighted music without their consent. The Recording Industry Association of America \u2013 the trade group on behalf of labels including Sony Music Entertainment, UMG Recordings and Warner Records \u2013 filed two copyright infringement cases against AI companies Suno and Uncharted Labs, the developer behind Udio, for training their AI models with the labels\u2019 unlicensed sound recordings. Udio is the company behind \u201cBBL Drizzy,\u201d the AI-generated song that went viral last month during the Kendrick Lamar and Drake spat. Udio was founded last year by former Google DeepMind researchers to make it \u201ceasy for anyone to create emotionally resonant music in an instant,\u201d according to the company. In April, it raised $10 million in funding. Meanwhile, Suno raised $125 million in funding last month. The platform, which allows users to create songs with only a few prompts, relies on OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT for lyrics and title development. Udio and Suno did not immediately respond to a request for comment. RIAA CEO Mitch Glazier said in a statement that the lawsuits are \u201cnecessary to reinforce the most basic rules of the road for the responsible, ethical, and lawful development of generative AI systems and to bring Suno\u2019s and Udio\u2019s blatant infringement to an end.\u201d He added that the music community is already partnering and collaborating with \u201cresponsible developers to build sustainable AI tools\u201d that put artists and songwriters in charge, but unlicensed services can exploit an artist\u2019s work \u201cwithout consent or pay set back \u2026 .\u201d In April, more than 200 artists, including Billie Eilish, Kacey Musgraves, J Balvin, Ja Rule, Jon Bon Jovi, The Jonas Brothers, Katy Perry, Miranda Lambert and more, signed an open letter\u00a0organized by the non-profit Artist Rights Alliance calling on AI developers, technology companies, platforms and digital music services to \u201ccease the use of artificial intelligence to infringe upon and devalue the rights of human artists.\u201d The lawsuit against Udio states \u201cif developed with the permission and participation of copyright owners, generative AI tools will be able to assist humans in creating and producing new and innovative music.\u201d It added: \u201cBut if developed irresponsibly, without regard for fundamental copyright protections, those same tools threaten enduring and irreparable harm to recording artists, record labels, and the music industry, inevitably reducing the quality of new music available to consumers and diminishing our shared culture.\u201d Meanwhile, the lawsuit against Suno states the company has over 10,000,000 users generating music files using the platform, bringing in about 2,000,000 streams. \u201cThese digital music files have been released to the public\u2014some already finding their way onto the major streaming services\u2014and compete with the copyrighted sound recordings that enabled their creation; yet Suno sought no permission from and gives no credit or compensation to the human artists or other rightsholders whose works fueled their creation.\u201d This story has been updated with additional context and developments.

{"id": "2024_06_23_us_engagement-ring-lost-florida-hospital-cec", "text": "Faye Bauman was wearing her diamond ring when she fell and broke her hip. It was June of last year, and she was 85. At North Florida Hospital in Gainesville, she took off several pieces of jewelry, including the ring, and gave them to a nurse. After the surgery, recovering at a rehab center, she realized she\u2019d left the hospital without her jewelry \u2014 including the diamond engagement ring from the love of her life. She could still remember the look in his eyes when he gave her that ring. Eager and innocent. They\u2019d met at a party, and by the end they were holding hands under the table. He saved up to buy her the ring. A half-carat diamond in white gold. One day he showed up at her office and dropped to one knee. He looked stunning in his Navy dress uniform. She said yes, slipping the ring onto her finger, sliding it around to make the diamond catch the light. Fifty-six years later, in a newer band of yellow gold, that diamond vanished from the hospital. Faye Bauman wanted to know why. For almost 12 months, she and her daughter tried to find answers. They spoke with at least four hospital officials. Bauman filed a police report, which classified the missing jewelry as a grand theft. But they got no satisfaction. The jewelry seemed to be gone forever. By May 2024, they say, no one had offered to make the situation right. Finally, Bauman told news reporters about her plight. In a long message sent from her iPad, during which she apologized for any errors that might be caused by her macular degeneration, she wrote, \u201cAt the present time, the CEO is not returning my;our calls. I have done everything they have told me to do but at this point it seems I don\u2019t exist.\u201d A CNN reporter made inquiries with the hospital and the police department and waited several days for answers. In the meantime, over the course of multiple phone interviews, Bauman told her story. She said she didn\u2019t expect to see her diamond ring again. But she realized this was a chance to talk about something more important: the man who gave her the ring. \u201cI want to tell you, I was not a princess when I met him,\u201d she said. \u201cTom made me a princess.\u201d She has wonderful memories of their marriage. But the final years were not the same Before he and Faye were married, Tom took care of his sick mother. This experience strengthened his habit of serving others. Day after day, throughout much of their marriage, he brought Faye breakfast in bed. He\u2019d pick a flower from the yard and place it in a tiny Waterford vase that he set on her breakfast tray. He asked her how she wanted her banana sliced. He brought her English tea, along with toast and jam and a coddled egg. Faye was divorced with three young daughters when she met Tom, and Tom treated the girls like they were his own. Tom and Faye were married for 48 years. She was a mental-health counselor and he worked in the Navy Supply Corps. After the Navy he got his contractor\u2019s license. \u201cEvery house we ever lived in, he remodeled,\u201d she said. He did plumbing and electrical work, adding a family room, installing French doors, taking on extra work so he could buy and install a new Jacuzzi for the woman he loved. They kept up their long romance from Florida to Rhode Island, from London to Istanbul and back to Florida. She admired his good looks and liked the way he smelled. They danced on the beach with their eyes closed. Tom took care of Faye until he couldn\u2019t anymore. In his fifties, something went wrong with his mind. First it was dementia, then Parkinson\u2019s Disease. He painted a room the wrong color. He walked outside in his underwear. In the grocery store, he picked up a piece of gum from the floor and put it in his mouth. Tom\u2019s body began to fail him, starting with his feet. Now it was Faye\u2019s turn to take care of Tom. She pulled him out of the hot tub when he couldn\u2019t get out on his own. She placed him on a mat in the yard, where he could lie down and pull weeds. She got up early to clean the gutters so he couldn\u2019t tell her that was his job. It went on like that for more than 20 years. He was her husband, but the man she\u2019d married was only a memory. He asked to move to a nursing home, and she let him go. Sometimes she woke in the middle of the night and drove to the nursing home and got into bed with him. \u201cI don\u2019t want to die,\u201d he told her. \u2018Oh, he was so beautiful\u2019 As Faye Bauman reminisced about her husband, the gears were turning in the case of the missing ring. The situation appeared to change in the days after a CNN reporter inquired about the jewelry. A Gainesville Police spokesman said the case had been assigned to a detective. And a spokesperson from HCA Healthcare\u2019s North Florida division released this statement: \u201cCompassionate care is the highest objective for the staff at HCA Florida North Florida Hospital. We looked into this with our contracted security provider who is responsible for securing patient\u2019s belongings, and we have assisted the Gainesville Police Department with their investigation, which is ongoing. We regret the loss of this personal item and have committed to reimbursing this individual to make things right.\u201d This was an improvement, if not a full resolution. Faye Bauman still wants to know how the ring disappeared, and she still wants more answers about what hospital officials did in the year that followed. As for the man who put the ring on her finger, she is sure of his final destination. Near the end he was on morphine, and he\u2019d stopped talking, and they were together, and he was drifting away. \u201cOh,\u201d she said, remembering that moment, \u201che was so beautiful.\u201d She held his hand, and kissed him, and prayed the Lord\u2019s Prayer. It felt as if angels were filling the room. She was praising God as she heard Tom take his last breath. Nothing is forever, at least not here on earth. She wore that diamond ring for seven more years. And then, like Tom, it was gone. \u201cYou know,\u201d Faye said, \u201cwe had a wonderful life.\u201d Her voice was cracking as she thought of him. Imagining the old Tom, the one who knelt before her that day in 1967. She expected to see him again. Restored, and renewed. His arms open. Welcoming her home.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/23/us/engagement-ring-lost-florida-hospital-cec/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/25/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_24_politics_louisiana-parents-sue-ten-commandments-schools", "text": "A group of\u00a0Louisiana parents and\u00a0civil\u00a0rights organizations\u00a0are suing the state over its new law that requires all public classrooms to display the Ten Commandments. The\u00a0lawsuit,\u00a0filed Monday in federal\u00a0court, contends that the legislation\u00a0violates both US Supreme Court precedent and the First Amendment. House Bill 71, signed by Republican Gov. Jeff Landry last week, mandates that by January 1, 2025, a poster-sized display of a state-approved version of the Ten Commandments with \u201clarge, easily readable font\u201d be put in every classroom from kindergarten through the university-level at state-funded schools. It is currently the only state with the requirement. In the complaint, the plaintiffs argue that mandating the Ten Commandments be posted in every classroom renders them \u201cunavoidable\u201d and \u201cunconstitutionally pressures students into religious observance, veneration, and adoption of the state\u2019s favored religious scripture.\u201d \u201cIt also sends the harmful and religiously divisive message that students who do not subscribe to the Ten Commandments\u2014or, more precisely, to the specific version of the Ten Commandments that H.B. 71 requires schools to display\u2014do not belong in their own school community and should refrain from expressing any faith practices of beliefs that are not aligned with the state\u2019s religious preferences,\u201d the complaint continues. The lawsuit is being brought by the American Civil Liberties Union, the ACLU of Louisiana, Americans United for Separation of Church and State, and the Freedom From Religion Foundation,\u00a0on behalf of nine \u201cmulti-faith families\u201d with students enrolled in Louisiana public schools. The families involved in the lawsuit include parents who are \u201cJewish, Christian, Unitarian Universalist, and non-religious,\u201d according to the joint news release\u00a0announcing the lawsuit. \u201cThis law strikes at the core of religious freedom,\u201d Alanah Odoms, executive director of ACLU Louisiana, said in an online news conference Monday, calling HB 71 the \u201ccanary in the coal mine.\u201d The lawsuit names state Superintendent of Education Cade Brumley, several other Louisiana State Board of Elementary and Secondary Education officials, and some local school boards. In a statement provided to CNN on Monday evening, Brumley said he looked forward to implementing the law. \u201cThe Ten Commandments law passed with overwhelming support in Louisiana\u2019s state legislature and was enthusiastically signed by our Governor,\u201d he said. \u201cI look forward to implementing the law and defending Louisiana\u2019s sovereign interest to select classroom content fundamental to America\u2019s foundation.\u201d CNN has reached out to Landry for comment. Several of the parents being represented spoke at the news conference about why they chose to sue over the new law. Josh Herlands, a Jewish father participating in the lawsuit, called the legislation \u201cunconstitutional, divisive, intolerant, and frankly un-American.\u201d Rev. Darcy Roake, a Unitarian Universalist minister, said that she and her Jewish husband are teaching their children the \u201cvalues of religious inclusion and diversity,\u201d and that the law \u201cwill create an unwelcoming and oppressive school environment for children like ours.\u201d Presbyterian Rev. Jeff Sims said he believes it is a \u201cgross intrusion of civil authority into matters of faith.\u201d Louisiana state Rep. Dodie Horton, the Republican author of the legislation, has previously dismissed concerns from opponents of the measure, saying the Ten Commandments are rooted in legal history and her bill would place a \u201cmoral code\u201d in the classroom. The organizations told journalists on Monday they\u00a0plan\u00a0to work toward obtaining a preliminary injunction hearing this summer, \u201cso this law can never be implemented for the children in Louisiana.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/24/politics/louisiana-parents-sue-ten-commandments-schools/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/25/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_24_us_ramiro-gonzalez-execution-texas-parole-board", "text": "Texas\u2019 parole board on Monday denied clemency for death row inmate Ramiro Gonzales, who is scheduled to be executed Wednesday for a 2001 murder, despite the fact a key expert witness no longer stands by his testimony at trial. Gonzales, 41, had asked the Board of Pardons and Paroles to recommend clemency, which would allow GOP Gov. Greg Abbott to commute the inmate\u2019s sentence to a lesser punishment, like life in prison without parole, for the 2001 sexual assault and killing of 18-year-old Bridget Townsend. Gonzales and his attorneys pointed to his traumatic upbringing and his rehabilitation \u2013 illustrated by his Christian faith \u2013 as reasons to spare his life, the petition shows. The board voted 7-0 against recommending a commutation of sentence or a 180-day reprieve. His attorneys were \u201cdeeply saddened and disappointed\u201d by the decision, they said in a statement. \u201cIf Ramiro is executed on Wednesday, the world will be a darker place without him,\u201d the attorneys said. Without the board\u2019s recommendation, Abbott is limited by state law to issuing a one-time 30-day reprieve. Otherwise, Gonzales\u2019 hopes rest with the courts: The inmate has asked for a stay of execution, arguing his trial jury\u2019s determination that he would remain a dangerous threat \u2013 a requirement for a capital sentence in Texas \u2013 was based on testimony by an expert witness who relied on data later found to be false. And it was ultimately wrong, his attorneys argue, as shown by Gonzales\u2019 redemption behind bars and his earlier attempts to donate a kidney. Thus, Gonzales should be ineligible for execution, his attorneys argue, and executing him would violate his constitutional rights under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments. The planned execution of Gonzales, who was previously slated to be put to death in July 2022 before the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals granted a stay, is one of two scheduled this week in the nation. On Thursday, Oklahoma intends to execute Richard Rojem, who was convicted of the 1984 kidnapping, rape and murder of his 7-year-old stepdaughter, Layla Cummings, court records show. Last week, the Oklahoma Pardon and Parole board voted against recommending clemency for Rojem, who claims he is innocent, CNN affiliate KOCO reported. If both Gonzales and Rojem are put to death, their executions would be the eighth and ninth to take place in the United States this year, according to the Death Penalty Information Center, a non-profit that monitors and analyzes information about capital punishment and has been critical of its administration. Both would be the second person to be executed in their respective states in 2024. By this time last year, 13 inmates had been put to death in the US, the center\u2019s data shows. In the Texas case, the Medina County Criminal District Attorney\u2019s Office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. CNN has tried to reach members of Townsend\u2019s family for comment. The murder of Bridget Townsend One day in January 2001, Gonzales called the home of his drug supplier, who was Townsend\u2019s boyfriend, according to a court of appeals opinion from 2009 affirming the inmate\u2019s conviction and death sentence. Townsend answered, the opinion states, and told Gonzales her boyfriend was at work. Gonzales then went to the home in search of drugs, and he stole money and tied Towsend\u2019s hands and feet before kidnapping her. He then drove her to a spot near his family\u2019s ranch, where he raped and fatally shot her, the court opinion says. In October 2002, while sitting in a county jail in connection to the rape of another woman, Gonzales confessed to Townsend\u2019s killing and led authorities to her body, court records show. Gonzales was 18 when he murdered Townsend, his clemency petition says, contending he was in the throes of drug addiction that was \u201ccompounded by the trauma and neglect that marked his childhood,\u201d his clemency petition states. Gonzales\u2019 mother drank and used drugs during her pregnancy and gave her son to her parents when he was born, the petition claims. She had two other children whom she raised, it says, but didn\u2019t acknowledge Gonzales as her son. The petition also says Gonzales was sexually abused throughout his childhood, beginning at age 6. Gonzales began using drugs in his teens, after his aunt \u2013 with whom he was close \u2013 was killed by a drunken driver, causing him \u201cinconsolable grief,\u201d the petition says. \u201cIn the years that followed, Ramiro\u2019s life spiraled out of control,\u201d it says. Inmate no longer poses a threat, appeal says During his years on death row, Gonzales has become a \u201cliving testament to the power of rehabilitation and human capacity for growth and change,\u201d his attorneys argued this month in an appeal before the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals. He has become \u201cdeeply religious,\u201d has \u201ccommitted no criminal acts of violence\u201d and has tried to atone for his crimes \u2013 in part by trying to donate a kidney. Ahead of his last execution date, Gonzales sought a 30-day reprieve so he could participate in an altruistic kidney donation. But the Texas Department of Criminal Justice deemed him ineligible under its health care policy, a spokesperson told CNN at the time, because an organ transplant would introduce an \u201cuncertain timeline\u201d that might interfere with an execution date. Gonzales\u2019 attorneys say that\u2019s just one example of Gonzales\u2019 \u201cgrowth and rehabilitation,\u201d also citing his commitment to his faith and ministry to others on death row, according to the recent appeal. Taken together, Gonzales\u2019 attorneys say, this evidence exhibits the inmate is no longer a threat to society, disproving a finding made by his jury at trial that was required for him to be sentenced to death. Additionally, Gonzales\u2019 lawyers argue the evidence jurors relied upon to make the determination of future dangerousness was wrong: An expert witness for the state testified during the penalty phase of the inmate\u2019s trial that \u201clots of data\u201d showed sex offenders were likely to continue to commit crimes, citing in part recidivism data. That data has since been found to be inaccurate, and the expert in 2021 evaluated Gonzales and has recanted his testimony, Gonzales\u2019 appeal states. The expert told The Marshall Project he had never changed his opinion in a capital case prior to this one, calling it \u201cthe exception, not the rule.\u201d When the Court of Criminal Appeals halted Gonzales\u2019 last execution, it sent the case back to his trial court to review the expert\u2019s testimony and whether it impacted the jury\u2019s decision. Gonzales\u2019 appeal says the state recommended relief be denied and that the lower court agreed without holding a hearing. The appeals court ultimately denied relief in June 2023.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/24/us/ramiro-gonzalez-execution-texas-parole-board/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/25/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_23_us_tennessee-tech-engineering-students-prosthetic-hands-trnd", "text": "These days, Tennessee middle school student Aubrey Sauvie, 12, who was born with no hands, says she can bang on her snare drum as hard or fast as she wants. It\u2019s all thanks to a generous gift from a group of college engineering students who created a custom pair of 3D-printed hands for the budding young musician. Ten Tennessee Technological University students made the special prosthetics as part of a dynamics of machinery class during spring semester for Aubrey, who was born as a triple congenital amputee. She has no arms below her elbows and a partially amputated left foot, her mother, Jennifer Sauvie, told CNN. The new prosthetics have made a world of a difference for Aubrey, who took up drumming over the past school year after being influenced by her older sister, who plays percussion. \u201cBefore I had them, I was having to put the drumsticks and stuff in my sleeves and just hold them in the crease in my elbow, so it would slip out over time depending on how hard I had to play or how fast,\u201d said Aubrey, who lives in Murfreesboro, Tennessee. \u201cBut with these \u2026\u00a0 they will stay stable and stay intact.\u201d Her band director knew of a program at Tennessee Tech called Tech Engineering for Kids and reached out to Stephen Canfield, a mechanical engineering professor who oversees the program. Tech Engineering for Kids, which is run through Canfield\u2019s junior-level engineering course, involves students working in teams to design a form of custom assistive technology for a child with special needs in the Middle Tennessee region. \u201cI have a network of medical professionals, care coordinators, therapists and the like that work with children with special needs in our region, and they\u2019ll help me identify a child and family with a need,\u201d Canfield told CNN. He then pairs the child with a student group who will design the type of technology the child needs, fabricate it, test it and deliver it to the family over the course of a semester, he said. His students have created toys and devices for children with sensory needs, according to Canfield. Aubrey previously used a Hero myoelectric 3D printed arm, her mother said. \u201cShe\u2019s only got one, so that was not really conducive for holding drumsticks,\u201d Jennifer Sauvie said. The length difference as Aubrey used the single arm to attempt playing the drums were also challenging. \u201cShe couldn\u2019t use the Hero arm for drumming or percussion,\u201d Jennifer Sauvie said. Aubrey\u2019s new prosthetics are more versatile, her mother added. \u201cThe ones she has printed now are for the drums and holding drumsticks, but really, if you wanted (them) to hold kayak ores or whatever, you could theoretically just print out different tips to put on this same base (of) prosthetics,\u201d Jennifer Sauvie said. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty cool.\u201d The Tennessee Tech students worked with Aubrey through the semester to ensure the prosthetic 3D printed arms were a great fit for her. \u201cWe would send a certain design to Aubrey, and then she would say, \u2018OK, I think this is good, but it\u2019s a little bit long, could it be shortened?\u2019 or \u2026 \u2018it\u2019s a little bit hot on my arm, could you potentially, like, make it a little bit more breathable?\u2019\u201d Tennessee Tech mechanical engineering senior Zak Henson, who served as a co-leader on the project, told CNN. \u201cSo now we\u2019re trying to think through, \u2018OK, how can we keep the design of what we\u2019re going for and adjust it to meet these new needs?\u2019\u201d Henson said of the process. The team created about six iterations of the prosthetics until they were satisfied with the finished product, mechanical engineering senior and project leader Branson Blaylock said. Aubrey says she wasn\u2019t certain if the 3D printed hands would work for her, but they wound up being a success. \u201cI was really excited that I was going to be able to use these and try them out,\u201d said Aubrey, who wants to be an ultrasound technician when she\u2019s older. She added: \u201cThey are becoming a very useful and resourceful tool to help me with my drumming.\u201d \u2018She makes it look easy\u2019 Jennifer Sauvie said she was aware Aubrey would be born with a limb difference while she was pregnant with her. \u201cIt was really scary, of course, but if I\u2019d only known then what I know now, it would have been a much happier, joyful pregnancy, because really, she just doesn\u2019t let anything stop her or get in the way,\u201d Jennifer Sauvie said. Her daughter has participated in activities including dance, taekwondo, art and music, she shared. The group of students working closely on prosthetic measurements and fittings with the 12-year-old found her to be an inspiration. \u201cWatching her do stuff that I just thought for sure there was no way she could handle that, she is just so determined,\u201d said Micah Page, a mechanical engineering student at Tennessee Tech. \u201cShe just makes it look easy to live life without hands.\u201d The custom prosthetics should last for Aubrey over the next few years before she outgrows them, Canfield said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/23/us/tennessee-tech-engineering-students-prosthetic-hands-trnd/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/25/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_22_us_texas-taekwondo-instructors-sexual-assault", "text": "When Simon An and his family heard screaming from a store next door to their family taekwondo studio on Wednesday outside Houston, Texas, they knew they had to find out what was happening. An, 20, and his famiy \u2013 all of whom practice martial arts \u2013 immediately went next door. There, they found a man attempting to sexually assault a woman and intercepted the suspect, holding him down until police arrived, according to an X post from Harris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez. An told CNN Friday the family was returning from their lunch break and were parking at the Yong-In studio in Katy when his father heard a \u201cloud scream\u201d as he exited his car. Then the whole family heard \u201ca second scream, and it was loud. Very loud.\u201d \u201cI would describe it as a horror scream.\u201d His father led the family into a nearby Cricket Wireless store. He heard another scream as he opened the door and rushed to the employees\u2019 room in the back, where he found \u201ca man on top of the woman with his hand over her mouth,\u201d An said. CNN has reached out to Cricket Wireless for comment. \u201cOur first instinct was to save the girl,\u201d An said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know what he was going to do to her.\u201d \u201cMy dad just pulled him off and pinned him in the corner of the building,\u201d An described. His father sustained some scratches and bites during the scuffle but is altogether \u201cfine,\u201d An added.

{"id": "2024_06_24_business_consumers-are-pulling-back-but-theyre-still-going-out-for-steak", "text": "\u201cGod I love Texas Roadhouse,\u201d began one thread on Reddit, with over 1,000 upvotes. \u201cTexas Roadhouse never disappoints,\u201d began another, with over 5,000 votes. A third touted the \u201cincredible value.\u201d If there\u2019s anything Americans love, it\u2019s cheap meat. So business is booming at Texas Roadhouse and LongHorn Steakhouse, even as Americans pull back elsewhere. In the quarter ending on March 26, sales at company-owned Texas Roadhouse locations open at least 18 months jumped 8.4% compared to the year before. And in the three months through May 26, sales at Longhorn Steakhouse locations open at least 16 months rose 4%. Longhorn, which is owned by Darden Restaurants, outperformed the other chains in Darden\u2019s portfolio, including Olive Garden. That\u2019s all happening as Americans curtail retail spending and plan to shell out less for vacations this summer. Most restaurant chains are feeling the heat, with even McDonald\u2019s reporting that lower-income consumers are pulling back. The two eateries have a history of performing well during periods of economic uncertainty \u2014\u00a0a few years ago, the pair were standouts as inflation-weary Americans began to pull back on spending. It may seem counterintuitive for sales at steakhouses to rise when people feel short on cash. But both Texas Roadhouse and Longhorn Steakhouse seem to have done what every restaurant wishes it could: Make people feel like they\u2019re getting a good deal when they need it most. An affordable luxury When it comes to steakhouses, Texas Roadhouse and LongHorn Steakhouse are on the cheaper end, noted Jim Salera, a research analyst at Stephens. \u201cThat average meal at Longhorn or Texas Roadhouse is actually very affordable,\u201d when compared to local establishments or higher-end chains like STK Steakhouse. The average check per person at Longhorn Steakhouse was $26, Salera said, according to a recent presentation from the Cheesecake Factory, which outlined its competitors\u2019 pricing. At Texas Roadhouse, the average check was $22. \u201cFor their core consumer, it really represents an affordable luxury,\u201d Salera said. Americans might sacrifice vacations or spend less on home goods to save money, but still feel comfortable splurging on a night out. \u201cNo one gives up everything at the same time.\u201d And it might not feel like such a splurge when you\u2019re getting a hearty meal of meat and potatoes. As a recent Bank of America note discussing Longhorn\u2019s results put it: \u201cConsumers recognize the center-of-plate value offered by steak.\u201d Plus, those checks may appear especially reasonable when fast food and other restaurants\u2019 prices are way up. Many restaurant chains have hiked their prices since the pandemic, not only because of high costs, but because they realized that diners would pay. Frustrated customers are finally pushing back, prompting restaurant chains to try to reverse course by offering short-term discounts and meal deals (but not lowering their overall prices). In contrast, both Longhorn and Texas Roadhouse have, made a point of keeping their regular prices relatively low, BTIG restaurant analyst Peter Saleh told CNN. They\u2019ve been trying to raise prices below inflation \u201cfor a while now,\u201d he said.  That approach could be why Texas Roadhouse and Longhorn Steakhouse consistently earn top marks on the American Customer Satisfaction Index, Saleh noted. Longhorn has also made moves to improve its menu. Back in June 2022, Darden CEO Rick Cardenas said during an analyst call that the chain \u201chas made significant investments over the past few years in the quality of their food.\u201d Might as well go out It\u2019s not just about low prices compared to other restaurants. It\u2019s also about what\u2019s happening at the supermarket. While grocery prices overall have been moderating, beef has stayed expensive. In the 12 months through May, uncooked beef steaks\u2019 prices went up 5.7%, according to inflation data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. When people see pricey steaks in the meat aisle, it\u2019s easier for them to justify going out for a nice steak dinner, noted Salera. Texas Roadhouse also mentioned the trend during a recent analyst call. \u201cRetail demand has been probably a little bit weaker,\u201d said Michael Bailen, senior director of investor relations at Texas Roadhouse. That has likely \u201cled to a benefit for us.\u201d Bailen noted that grocers may be offering deals on certain cuts, like strip steaks, but not ribeyes, making restaurant ribeyes seem like a steal in comparison. Going out to eat can also release the anxiety some shoppers feel about ruining a supermarket steak, Salera said. \u201cFrom the consumer perspective they\u2019ll say, \u2018Okay, rather than me buy a steak at Kroger and then bring it home and mess it up, I can just pay somebody to prepare it for me.\u2019\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/24/business/consumers-are-pulling-back-but-theyre-still-going-out-for-steak/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/25/2024", "section": "us"}}

Cook was accused of the 1977 rape, murder and mutilation of 21-year-old Edwards in Tyler,\u00a0Texas. She was found in her bedroom by her roommate, Paula Rudolph. Cook lived in the same apartment complex as the victim, leading to him becoming a suspect. A set of fingerprints on Edwards\u2019 sliding patio door\u00a0matched Cook. Scientific analysis and expert testimony debunked the claim the fingerprints found on the patio door were \u201cfresh.\u201d Cook was sentenced to death at his first trial in 1979, but his conviction was later overturned on appeal.\u00a0The second trial in 1992 ended in a mistrial with the jury unable to meet a unanimous verdict.\u00a0A third trial in 1994\u00a0ended with a new conviction and death sentence.\u00a0The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals reversed the second verdict in 1996, stating misconduct by police and prosecutors. In 1999, the results of DNA testing on Edwards\u2019 underwear did not match Cook. Edward Scott Jackson, an inmate at Smith County Jail and the star witness in Cook\u2019s first trial testified Cook told him he had killed Edwards. He later recanted his testimony, saying, \u201cI lied on him to save myself.\u201d Jackson admitted he lied in exchange for a reduced sentence. Before a fourth trial in 1999, the state offered Cook a \u201cno contest\u201d plea deal for murder.\u00a0He was sentenced to 20 years and given credit for time served, leading to his release. However,\u00a0his conviction stood. Kerry Cook maintained his innocence through it all and has now been formally found innocent of Edwards\u2019\u00a0murder. \u201cKerry suffered immensely for nearly 50 years, and nothing can give him his life back,\u201d one of Cook\u2019s attorneys, Glenn Garber of the Exoneration Initiative, said in a statement to CNN. \u201cThe decision finally and forcefully clears his name, and at the same time chronicles the State\u2019s outrageous and unrelenting misconduct,\u201d Garber said. \u201cIt is important for the people of Tyler, Smith County, and the world to understand this travesty of justice and see it for what it was all along \u2013 a disturbing witch hunt by state actors.\u201d CNN has reached out to the office of Smith County District Attorney Jacob Putman for comment, who took office in 2019.

{"id": "2024_06_23_us_arkansas-grocery-store-shooting-investigation", "text": "The suspect in a mass shooting at a grocery store in Arkansas was armed with a pistol, a 12-gauge shotgun and had a bandolier with dozens of extra shotgun rounds, authorities said. It was one of at least 14 mass shootings in the US since Friday, including one in Ohio, in which 10 people \u2013 including two minors \u2013 were shot. The US has suffered at least 247 mass shootings in just the past six months, according to the Gun Violence Archive, which defines mass shootings as those in which four or more victims are shot. In recent weeks, gunfire erupted at a\u00a0Michigan splash pad, a\u00a0Texas Juneteenth celebration\u00a0and a\u00a0Massachusetts car meetup, among other seemingly innocuous locations. The suspect in the Arkansas grocery store shooting, Travis Eugene Posey, 44, allegedly opened fire at the Mad Butcher in Fordyce on Friday, killing four people ages 23 to 81 and wounding\u00a0nine\u00a0others. \u201cThe suspect arrived at the Mad Butcher armed,\u201d Secretary of Public Safety and Director of Arkansas State Police Mike Hagar said. \u201cWe believe that most, if not all the rounds, fired by the suspect were from the shotgun.\u201d Authorities believe the suspect \u201cimmediately began engaging victims in the parking lot after exiting his truck and then proceeded into the store,\u201d Hagar said. Once inside the grocery store, the suspect \u201cwas firing indiscriminately at both customers and employees,\u201d Hagar said. Law enforcement responded to the shooting around 11:30 a.m. and exchanged gunfire with the suspect, Arkansas State Police said. Officers arrived less than three minutes from the time the first shot was fired, Hagar said. \u201cWhen law enforcement arrived on scene, the suspect exited the store, and the officers redirected his attention towards them,\u201d he said. \u201cHe immediately engaged in a firefight with law enforcement, where they were able to stop the threat,\u201d Hagar said. Posey was \u201ctreated for non-life-threatening\u00a0injuries after exchanging gunfire with law enforcement\u201d and taken to the Ouachita County Detention Center, state police said in a release. Posey is expected to be charged with four counts of capital murder, with additional charges pending, Arkansas State Police said in a\u00a0news release. He is set to appear in court Monday, Dallas County prosecutor Eric Marks said. The suspect\u2019s motive is not yet clear, Hagar said, noting that his criminal history is \u201cvery limited \u2013 if there is any at all.\u201d It was not clear whether Posey had retained legal counsel. Victims include an infant\u2019s mother and a selfless great-grandparent The four people killed in the shooting were identified as Callie Weems, 23; Roy Sturgis, 50; Shirley Taylor, 62; and Ellen Shrum, 81. Weems, the youngest victim, leaves behind her 10-month-old daughter Ivy, according to a GoFundMe page set up by family friends to help with her funeral expenses. \u201cCallie\u2019s life was tragically took yesterday way (too) soon,\u201d reads the campaign, verified by GoFundMe. \u201cWith Ivy being left behind this is a great way for Helen (Callie\u2019s mother) to also do something for her future. She loved her child and everyone witnessed her being a phenomenal mom. Pray for Helen, Ivy and family the days to come will be the hardest.\u201d The young victim\u2019s mother, Helen Browning, is also mourning the death of another victim.

In addition to the victims killed, seven civilians ages 20 to 65 years were injured by gunfire. Four of them were still hospitalized as of Sunday, including a woman who is in critical condition, Arkansas State Police said. Two police officers were also shot and wounded, authorities said, including a Fordyce police officer who was released from a hospital Saturday evening. \u201cI can tell you from what we\u2019ve seen that there appears to be no personal connection to the shooter of any of the victims,\u201d Hagar said. \u201cHe simply started engaging victims indiscriminately \u2014 just as targets of opportunity.\u201d \u2018Mama, pinch me. This can\u2019t be real\u2019 Katrina Doherty was shopping for dinner with her 18-year-old daughter and 4-year-old son when she thought she heard the sound of something falling. Then she saw glass shatter and someone drop to the ground. That\u2019s when she knew gunfire had erupted. Not finding an escape route, Doherty and others followed two store employees and darted into a freezer. The 39-year-old mother said she heard about nine or 10 rounds before making it into the icy shelter. \u201cWe ran in there really fast. We still heard gunshots keep going off,\u201d Doherty told CNN. \u201cIt was like slow motion. My daughter was like \u2018Mama, pinch me.

Then he noticed the grocery store\u2019s front windows were broken \u2013 as if they had been \u201cshot open\u201d by gunfire, Rodriguez said. Panicked shoppers then sprinted out of the store as gunfire rang out in rapid succession, Rodriguez said. Inside the store\u2019s freezer, frigid customers and employees couldn\u2019t call 911 because there was no service, Doherty said. Her son started to cry, \u201cbut we finally got him calmed down because I didn\u2019t want the shooter to hear,\u201d she told CNN. At one point, one of the employees inside the freezer opened the door, but promptly closed it after seeing a dead body immediately outside, Doherty said. The door remained shut until one of the workers heard police outside, and those in the freezer were escorted out.

The Texas chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations identified the family as Muslim and Palestinian and called on state and federal law enforcement authorities to investigate the incident \u201cas a hate crime and take all precautions to keep the Muslim family and the Muslim community safe,\u201d the organization said in a news release Friday. On May 19, Euless Police Department officers responded to a call at an apartment complex pool regarding a disturbance between two women. Witnesses told officers \u201ca woman who was very intoxicated had tried to drown a child and argued with the child\u2019s mother,\u201d police said in a news release. The woman, identified as Elizabeth Wolf, 42, was approached by officers as she tried to leave and placed under arrest for public intoxication. The victim\u2019s mother told police Wolf was questioning where she was from and if the two children playing at the pool were hers, the release said. The mother was visibly Muslim and wore\u00a0a hijab, or Islamic headscarf, and modest swimwear, according to the council. Wolf also made statements about the mother not being an American and made other racist statements, according to police. \u201cWhen the mother answered her, she stated that Wolf tried to grab her 6-year-old son but he pulled away from her grasp, which caused a scratch on his finger. The mother began helping her son when Wolf grabbed her 3-year-old daughter and forced her underwater,\u201d the news release said.

Katrina Doherty \u2013 who had been shopping for dinner with her 18-year-old daughter and 4-year-old son \u2013 said she first thought she heard the sound of something falling but then saw glass shatter and someone drop to the ground. That\u2019s when she knew shots were being fired. Outside, David Rodriguez was pulling into a gas station when he heard \u201cpops\u201d that he initially thought were fireworks. He then noticed the grocery store\u2019s front windows were broken \u2013 as if they had been \u201cshot open\u201d by gunfire, Rodriguez said. Panicked shoppers then started running away as gunshots were fired rapidly, Rodriguez said. A man had opened fire at the Mad Butcher in Fordyce, killing four people and wounding\u00a0nine\u00a0others.\u00a0Those killed ranged in age from 23 to 81 years old and include one person who police later announced died on Saturday evening. Law enforcement responded to the shooting around 11:30 a.m. and exchanged gunfire with the \u201clone suspect,\u201d according to Arkansas State Police. Cellphone video captured a man in the parking lot aiming a long gun and firing in multiple directions. Not finding an escape route, Doherty and others in the store hurriedly hid in a freezer. Doherty\u2019s daughter and son, who were in a different aisle, reunited with their mother in the back of the store and followed two store workers into the freezer. The 39-year-old mother said she heard about nine or ten rounds before making it into the icy shelter. \u201cWe ran in there really fast. We still heard gunshots keep going off,\u201d Doherty said. \u201cIt was like slow motion.

Doherty couldn\u2019t hear what was happening outside, and when they tried to call 9-1-1, there was no service. The group stayed inside, enduring the freezing cold in \u201cpanic mode,\u201d with some praying and others crying, she recalled. Her son started to cry, \u201cbut we finally got him calmed down because I didn\u2019t want the shooter to hear.\u201d \u201cWe were just sitting there and praying. I was in panic mode. My son about froze to death. We tried to get him quiet, but he was saying he wanted his daddy. It felt like we were in there forever,\u201d Doherty said. \u201cWe were in there maybe 15 minutes. I was asking the Lord to protect over everybody. I was just praying. The other lady, she was praying. She was crying.\u201d At one point, one of the workers opened the freezer door, and saw someone dead right outside of it, Doherty said. The door remained shut until one of the store workers heard police outside, and they were then escorted out of the store, Doherty said. Once she was out of the store, Doherty reunited with her 15-year-old twin daughters who were waiting outside in the car during the shooting and ducked down when they heard the gunshots. Shirley Kay Taylor, 62, was one of the four dead, her daughter Angela Atchley told CNN and police confirmed on Saturday. Atchley says her mother, who loved her family and kids, \u201cwas the hardest working woman I know\u201d and a \u201cgreat person.\u201d \u201cWe are completely lost,\u201d Atchley said. Additional civilians killed in the shooting were identified by police as: 23-year-old Callie Weems, 50-year-old Roy Sturgis and 81-year-old Ellen Shrum. A fourth victim died Saturday evening following three previous deaths that were initially counted by police. The country has seen a spate of shootings in the past few weeks, with 21 mass shootings recorded by\u00a0the Gun Violence Archive\u00a0since last Friday. Shootings permeated a Michigan splash pad, a Texas Juneteenth celebration and a Massachusetts car meetup, among other locations. They are among at least 234 mass shootings have taken place in the United States in 2024,\u00a0according to data from the Gun Violence Archive, which, like CNN, defines a mass shooting as one in which four or more people are shot, excluding the shooter. The aftermath of the shooting Matthew Gill, the meat manager at the\u00a0Mad Butcher,\u00a0told CNN a man came into the store with a shotgun and ended up in a shootout with police. Two police officers were wounded in the gunfire, with one released from the hospital Saturday evening and another having minor injuries. The suspected shooter, identified by authorities as 44-year-old Travis Eugene Posey, was also wounded and taken into custody. Posey, a resident of New Edinburg, is expected to be charged with four counts of capital murder, with additional charges pending, according to an Arkansas State Police\u00a0news release. He was taken to the Ouachita County Detention Center and is set to appear in court on Monday, according to Dallas County prosecutor Eric Marks. The injuries to the suspect are not considered life-threatening, according to Mike Hagar, the secretary of public safety and director of Arkansas State Police. He noted the \u201csituation is secured \u2026 contained. There are no active threats to the community.\u201d \u201cThe remaining civilian injuries range from non-life threatening to extremely critical,\u201d he said. Five women and two men from 20 to 65 years old were injured in the shooting. Four of them are still in the hospital, including a woman who is in critical condition. Three victims were treated and released on Friday. Posey was \u201ctreated for non-life-threatening\u00a0injuries after exchanging gunfire with law enforcement, released to ASP custody, and transported to the Ouachita County Detention Center,\u201d ASP said in the release. It is unclear if Posey has retained legal counsel at this point. Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders in a statement on\u00a0X said she had been briefed on the \u201ctragic shooting\u201d in Fordyce and is in \u201cconstant contact\u201d with state police at the scene. Fordyce, a small city in southeast Dallas County,\u00a0had a population\u00a0of just 3,396 in 2020. Fordyce City Council Member Roderick Rogers told CNN affiliate KATV that he was on the phone with someone in the store when the shooting took place. \u201cMan, it was bad,\u201d Rogers said. The council member said that he spoke with survivors of the shooting who \u201care traumatized.\u201d \u201cWe are trying to get some counseling and everything set up at the moment,\u201d he added.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/22/us/fordyce-arkansas-grocery-store-shooting-saturday/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/25/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_22_us_roe-v-wade-overturned-2-years", "text": "Two years ago, the US Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, ending the constitutional right to an abortion and setting off a fierce fight for reproductive rights at the state level. Abortion has emerged as a key issue in the 2024 election, and as access narrows\u00a0in many states, reproductive freedom advocates are working to get measures preserving reproductive rights on the November ballot to let voters weigh in. Abortion rates reach a decade-long high in the US Two years after Roe v. Wade was overturned,\u00a014 states have total or near-total bans\u00a0on abortion, including Alabama, Texas, Idaho and Tennessee. Despite\u00a0an increase in\u00a0restrictive policies,\u00a0the number and rate of\u00a0abortions\u00a0in 2023 hit their highest point in over a decade, according to\u00a0a report from\u00a0the\u00a0Guttmacher Institute, a\u00a0research and policy non-profit that advocates for sexual and reproductive health rights. The organization estimates\u00a0there were more than 1 million abortions in the\u00a0formal\u00a0US\u00a0healthcare system\u00a0last year, a\u00a011% increase from 2020. States without\u00a0total\u00a0abortion bans saw a\u00a026% increase from 2020, according to the report. The loss of\u00a0abortion\u00a0access in states with bans, the authors noted, was countered by\u00a0\u201cefforts on the part of clinics, abortion funds and logistical support organizations to help people\u2026access care.\u201d Nearly two-thirds of all abortions in 2023, about 642,700, were medication abortions \u2013 not including self-managed medication abortions outside of the healthcare setting, the report says. The authors note a steady increase since 2001, when medication abortions\u00a0accounted for less than 10% of all procedures. Over the years, the US Food and Drug Administration relaxed some of the restrictions for use of the abortion pill, and access to the medication increased. In 2016, the agency deemed the abortion pill safe to use up to 10 weeks into pregnancy, rather than seven, and expanded the pool of providers who could prescribe it. After the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, the FDA allowed for the pill to be dispensed by certified pharmacies and through the mail, rather than just in healthcare settings. States implement increasingly restrictive abortion policies Abortion policies have changed rapidly\u00a0in many\u00a0states since the Supreme Court\u2019s decision\u00a0to overturn Roe. Four states, California, Michigan, Vermont and Ohio, have since\u00a0enshrined rights to reproductive freedom in their constitutions, while lawmakers in\u00a0New York\u00a0and other states implemented policies to protect abortion patients and providers. More than a dozen states passed\u00a0abortion \u201ctrigger\u00a0laws\u201d ahead of\u00a0the court\u2019s decision,\u00a0meant to take effect almost immediately in the event that Roe was overturned,\u00a0and at least seven\u00a0states without trigger laws have followed suit with restrictive reproductive health policies that critics say put patients in danger and leave providers at risk of civil and criminal liability. Patients and providers have struggled to navigate a patchwork of sometimes hastily implemented abortion policies that include\u00a0mandatory waiting periods\u00a0to obtain an abortion in states\u00a0including\u00a0Arizona and Georgia, limits on\u00a0Medicaid coverage\u00a0for abortion, in states including South Dakota, and vague language around\u00a0medical emergency exceptions\u00a0to abortion bans in states including Texas. Lower courts have been asked to take abortion issues up in multiple legal challenges across states. These policies have already had real-world\u00a0effects. For example,\u00a0one woman in Texas\u00a0sued the state to access an abortion for a pregnancy that was threatening her future fertility. Another Texas woman was\u00a0unlawfully charged\u00a0with murder for\u00a0using abortion medication to self-induce an abortion and spent two nights in jail before the charges were dropped.\u00a0Providers say\u00a0that patients in states with abortion bans have been forced to carry pregnancies against their will, leading to compromised fertility and other life-threatening consequences. Last month, Florida replaced its 15-week abortion ban with a\u00a0six-week ban, which falls before many women know they\u2019re pregnant. The move was a major blow to reproductive access in the South, where Florida was a critical access point for people seeking abortions. Providers\u00a0and advocates\u00a0say the restrictive policies have created a\u00a0reproductive care\u00a0\u201cdesert\u201d in the region. Patients cross state lines to access reproductive care More than 171,000 patients travelled for an abortion in 2023, according to the Guttmacher Institute. Many people who traveled to obtain abortions before Roe was overturned were going to states that now have total abortion bans, meaning people are now traveling farther distances \u2013 sometimes crossing multiple state lines \u2013 to access care, the\u00a0organization noted recently. In just the first half of 2023,\u00a0nearly 1 in 5 people\u00a0who had an abortion \u00ad\u2013\u00a0more than 92,000 people \u2013 traveled across state lines for abortion care, according to a\u00a0December\u00a02023\u00a0analysis\u00a0from the\u00a0institute. As the abortion care landscape becomes more and more restrictive, Alexandra Mandado, president of Planned Parenthood in South, East and North Florida,\u00a0says that remaining abortion clinics\u00a0will struggle to absorb the increase in out-of-state patients. Supreme Court takes up other high profile reproductive rights cases The Supreme Court recently\u00a0rejected a challenge\u00a0to access\u00a0to the abortion pill, mifepristone, maintaining widespread access to medication abortion in a ruling that will allow for continued mailing of the pills\u00a0to patients without an in-person doctor\u2019s visit. Experts say abortion pill access could face additional legal challenges in the future. The court is considering another case this summer dealing with\u00a0medical emergency exceptions\u00a0to abortion bans. In the case, the Biden administration sued the state of Idaho,\u00a0where exemptions to its abortion ban are limited to life-threatening situations,\u00a0arguing that federal law requires hospitals receiving Medicare funding to provide stabilizing care, including abortions, when a pregnant person\u2019s health is\u00a0in danger. Access to other reproductive care services is challenged In February,\u00a0the\u00a0Alabama Supreme Court\u00a0ruled that frozen embryos are considered human beings and those who destroy them can be held liable for wrongful death, causing fertility clinics throughout the state to pause in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatments out of fear of legal prosecution. As families across the state lost access to IVF treatments, lawmakers scrambled to meet the widespread demand for a fix. In March,\u00a0the state passed a law\u00a0aimed at protecting IVF patients and providers from the legal liability imposed on them by the state court\u2019s ruling. While some services resumed,\u00a0at least one\u00a0of the state\u2019s limited pool of IVF providers says it will halt services altogether\u00a0by the end of the year, citing litigation concerns. Experts have\u00a0expressed concern\u00a0that other reproductive care services, like contraception, are also on the line amid a swell of misinformation that some say is sown intentionally to create panic,\u00a0like lawmakers conflating emergency contraception\u00a0with abortion, for example. Advocates work to get abortion on state ballots in November Most abortion policies implemented after the Supreme Court overturned Roe were directly triggered by that decision or handed down by lawmakers or state courts. In an effort to\u00a0restore the issue of reproductive health access, organizers across the country have been working to get measures to enshrine reproductive health rights in state constitutions\u00a0on ballots in November. Colorado, Florida, Maryland and South Dakota have secured the measures on their state ballots, with New York and Nevada likely to follow suit. Organizers in at least seven other states are working to do the same. In addition to making it more difficult to challenge access to abortion services, organizers hope that the measures will allow voters to\u00a0send a message to politicians about what they want.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/22/us/roe-v-wade-overturned-2-years/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/25/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_24_politics_arizona-election-worker-arrested-maricopa-county", "text": "A temporary election worker in Arizona was arrested Saturday after allegedly stealing a security fob and keys from the Maricopa County Tabulation and Election Center, according to court documents obtained by CNN. Arizona, and Maricopa County specifically, has been a hotbed for election conspiracy theories since 2020. The Arizona secretary of state\u2019s office said in a Monday statement that the fact Maricopa officials identified this security incident showed that election safety protocols in the county are working. It came amid concerns the incident could be used to further enflame conspiracy theories in the state. Walter Ringfield, who identified himself to police as a temporary employee of the tabulation center, faces charges of theft and criminal damage. He remains in the custody of the Maricopa County Sheriff\u2019s Office as he awaits his next court appearance due to an unrelated pending felony case against him, a local official confirmed to CNN. According to court documents, Ringfield was captured on surveillance video walking past a desk and multiple tabulators just after 5 p.m. local time on June 20. The surveillance video then shows Ringfield stopping at the desk, grabbing a lanyard with the security fob and keys attached, and placing them in his pocket, court documents say. Ringfield was confronted by his elections supervisor about taking the security fob and keys, and he allowed security to search his car.  Arizona detectives ultimately executed a search warrant of Ringfield\u2019s home, where the fob was located. According to investigators, the security fobs are used in conjunction with special secure tablets during the election. Because one was removed, every fob and tablet must be reprogrammed, court documents say. A director at the elections office told investigators the estimated cost of replacing the security fobs and tablets would be more than $19,000. \u201cThe secure operation of the facility is greatly impeded until the reprogramming is completed,\u201d court documents note. During his initial court appearance Saturday, Ringfield was informed that he would remain in custody until his next court appearance, scheduled for Thursday, because of another pending felony case against him, video from his arraignment shows. Ringfield appeared surprised when the judge notified him of the other pending case and said it was his understanding the unrelated matter had already been resolved. It was not immediately clear whether Ringfield has an attorney. In a statement to CNN, the Arizona secretary of state\u2019s office said the incident at the Maricopa County Tabulation and Election Center \u201cshould reassure the public about the effectiveness of the security measures in place.\u201d \u201cOur systems are not only designed to detect anomalies but are also supported by dedicated professionals committed to upholding the democratic process. While this event is unwelcome, it speaks the effectiveness of the security protocols built into Arizona\u2019s election systems,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThe swift actions of the Maricopa County elections staff, including the re-conducting of logic and accuracy tests, builds in extra layers of protection of all affected equipment. This quick response will prevent any potential impact on the upcoming elections,\u201d the office added.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/24/politics/arizona-election-worker-arrested-maricopa-county/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/25/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_24_us_los-angeles-synagogue-palestinian-israeli-protest-violence", "text": "A pro-Palestinian protest held outside a Los Angeles synagogue devolved into chaotic street violence with pro-Israel counterprotesters on Sunday in an incident that several officials, including President Joe Biden, criticized as antisemitic. The Los Angeles Police Department said it responded to two protests Sunday in the predominantly Jewish neighborhood of Pico-Robertson, just south of Beverly Hills. Videos taken at the scene show police pushing pro-Palestinian protesters away from the entrance of the Adas Torah temple, an Orthodox synagogue. Chants of \u201cFree, free Palestine - from the river to the sea,\u201d and \u201clong live intifada,\u201d could be heard from among the pro-Palestinian protesters.\u00a0Participants blocked traffic, and video from the scene shows multiple altercations broke out in the middle of the street and on sidewalks. Officers arrested a person with a \u201cspiked flag,\u201d the police department told CNN. The person was issued a citation for possessing a prohibited item during a protest and released from custody. At a Monday news conference, Los Angeles Police Department Interim Chief\u00a0Dominic Choi said detectives are investigating \u201call acts of violence.\u201d He added that while residents are \u201cOK\u201d to protest peacefully, \u201cviolence\u00a0will not be tolerated.\u201d At the news conference, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said she plans on meeting with the city attorney\u2019s office to talk about the potential for permits for protests, people wearing masks at protests and \u201cestablishing\u00a0clear lines of demarcation between what is legal and what is not.\u201d Bass said she will also convene a meeting of leaders of houses of worship and cultural centers to discuss how to protect sacred spaces and keep congregants safe. Police will enhance their partnership with Jewish public safety organizations to review threats to the community, the mayor said. Protests around the Israel-Gaza war have become common across the United States since October, but Democratic officials sharply criticized Sunday\u2019s event for its violence and for taking place at a Jewish institution. \u201cI\u2019m appalled by the scenes outside of Adas Torah synagogue in Los Angeles. Intimidating Jewish congregants is dangerous, unconscionable, antisemitic, and un-American,\u201d Biden said on X. \u201cAmericans have a right to peaceful protest. But blocking access to a house of worship \u2013 and engaging in violence \u2013 is never acceptable.\u201d \u201cThe violent clashes outside the Adas Torah synagogue in Los Angeles are appalling,\u201d California Gov. Gavin Newsom said on X. \u201cThere is no excuse for targeting a house of worship. Such antisemitic hatred has no place in California.\u201d \u201cTargeting a synagogue, or targeting the members of a synagogue, is anti-Semitic,\u201d US Rep. Ted Lieu of California said on X. \u201cI strongly condemn the Pro-Palestinian demonstrators who engaged in anti-Semitism by targeting Adas Torah Synagogue and/or its congregants. Anyone who engaged in violence should be prosecuted.\u201d Jewish and Muslim advocacy groups say the war has led to skyrocketing hate crimes and bias incidents. The Anti-Defamation League reports that antisemitic incidents were up 140% in 2023 compared to the prior year. And the Council on American-Islamic Relations said last year marked the highest number of anti-Muslim bias reports it has received in nearly three decades. On Sunday, Bass said in a statement, \u201cI want to be clear that Los Angeles will not be a harbor for antisemitism and violence. Those responsible for either will be found and held accountable.\u201d Synagogue hosted Israel real estate event The protest stemmed from an Israel real estate event on Sunday at the Adas Torah synagogue, according to the synagogue\u2019s security director and social media posts from organizers. The event at the synagogue was promoted by a firm called My Home in Israel Real Estate, a group that has helped to facilitate marketing events for potential property sales in Israel and the West Bank to Jewish Americans. CNN has reached out to the group for comment. In response, pro-Palestinian groups announced plans to protest the event in a Friday Instagram post from the Palestinian Youth Movement and an LA-based chapter of the group. \u201cOur land is not for sale,\u201d the post stated. \u201cStand against settler expansion at Sunday\u2019s real estate event selling homes to build \u2018Anglo neighborhoods\u2019 in Palestine.\u201d The post then listed the synagogue\u2019s Los Angeles address. \u201cRacist settler expansionists are not welcome in Los Angeles!\u201d the account wrote in the caption. \u201cThis blatant example of land theft is operating in our own backyard. The Nakba is ongoing and must be confronted!\u201d Dan Braum, the volunteer security director for the temple, said the protesters blocked the entrance to the synagogue until police arrived and pushed them away. It\u2019s unclear how the chaos escalated, but videos shared on social media shows both groups taunting, shoving and grabbing each other outside the synagogue. The groups of demonstrators eventually began flowing down nearby streets, where more scuffles broke out, the videos show. In one video,\u00a0two\u00a0men appear to be wrestling on the ground as\u00a0others\u00a0kick\u00a0at them. Later, one of the men\u00a0\u2013\u00a0holding\u00a0an\u00a0Israeli\u00a0flag \u2013\u00a0appears\u00a0to have a bloodied face and mouth. Additional video showed an egg thrown at a pro-Palestinian activist and a man wearing a keffiyeh, a traditional Palestinian scarf, chased and punched on the ground by a man wearing a Jewish yarmulke or kippah. During many of the altercations, bystanders worked to pull and hold people apart. Los Angeles police began monitoring the situation around 10:30 a.m., Officer Tony Im told CNN. The crowd was ordered to disperse at some point, Im said, though no exact time was provided. He added that the situation appeared \u201cpretty calm\u201d hours later, but that police were closely monitoring the area. \u2018They came looking to escalate\u2019 Braum said the pro-Palestinian protesters had their faces covered, said \u201cvile, disgusting things\u201d and were \u201cready for a fight.\u201d \u201cThey come looking to escalate,\u201d he said. \u201cNot every single one of them, that would be unfair of me to say. But there are certain ones who come looking for violence and they get violence and they want the cameras recording.\u201d One man wearing a red keffiyeh over his face spoke to CNN affiliate KCAL as a counter-protester badgered him to \u201cshow your face.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not meant to be intimidating. Yeah, disruptive, for sure,\u201d the keffiyeh-wearing man said. \u201cThis is intimidating,\u201d he added, pointing at the counter-protester. \u201cWe didn\u2019t get in anyone\u2019s faces.\u201d However, resident Josh Golcheh disagreed. \u201cThey\u2019ve come to our home. They come and are attacking us. They bear-sprayed my friend who\u2019s standing right over here,\u201d he told KCAL. He said people he knew had been attacked. \u201cIt\u2019s just terrible.\u201d Rabbi Hertzel Illulian of the nearby JEM Community Center in Beverly Hills told KCAL violence \u201cdoesn\u2019t belong here\u201d and lamented what he saw as a double standard. \u201cI don\u2019t think the Jewish people would go in front of a mosque or the Christian people would go in front of a mosque to do such a thing,\u201d he said. \u201cNobody would accept this, but here, when it comes to Jews and Israel, everything is kosher, everything is okay.\u201d In a statement, the Jewish Federation Los Angeles nonprofit thanked Biden and other officials for their support. \u201cYesterday\u2019s abhorrent violence in the Pico-Robertson neighborhood of Los Angeles, the most densely populated Jewish area on the West Coast, is yet another example of the rising antisemitism and violence targeting Jews. Harassment, intimidation, and physical attacks against our Jewish community cannot be tolerated or normalized,\u201d the organization said. \u201cJews, like everyone else, have the right to live, pray, and gather in peace. We respect the constitutional freedom to protest. However, what we saw yesterday and are witnessing time and again across the nation, are protests that devolve into excuses to target and harm Jews.\u201d CNN\u2019s Elizabeth Wolfe, Amanda Jackson, Sarah Moon, Camila Bernal, Andy Rose, DJ Judd, and Paradise Afshar\u00a0contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/24/us/los-angeles-synagogue-palestinian-israeli-protest-violence/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/25/2024", "section": "us"}}

{"id": "2024_06_24_politics_student-loan-repayment-plan-halted", "text": "Two federal court judges in Kansas and Missouri have paused parts of a student loan repayment plan that the Biden administration launched last year, which lowers borrowers\u2019 monthly payments and provides a faster route to debt forgiveness. Two lawsuits filed by Republican-led states argue that the Biden administration overstepped its authority when it implemented the SAVE (Saving on a Valuable Education) repayment plan. Both judges granted partial preliminary injunctions Monday. Two parts of the SAVE plan will be on pause until the cases are fully litigated. The Biden administration cannot cancel any more federal student debt for borrowers enrolled in the SAVE plan. Under the plan, borrowers qualify for debt forgiveness once they make at least 10 years of payments. To date, $5.5 billion has been canceled for 414,000 people enrolled in SAVE. The Biden administration will also be blocked from implementing further provisions of the SAVE plan. In July, millions of people were expecting to see their payments lowered \u2013 but it\u2019s now unclear whether those reductions will occur. The Department of Education did not immediately respond to a request for comment. SAVE is one of Biden\u2019s key student loan policies After the Supreme Court knocked down President Joe Biden\u2019s signature student loan forgiveness program last summer, his administration launched the SAVE plan. Like existing income-driven repayment plans, SAVE ties monthly payments to a borrower\u2019s income and family size. But the SAVE plan offers the most generous terms, especially for low-income borrowers. More than 8 million borrowers have enrolled in SAVE so far, and 4.6 million of them have a $0 monthly payment. Borrowers enrolled in SAVE may also be eligible for student debt relief in a shorter amount of time than under other income-driven plans. Those who borrowed $12,000 or less will see their debt forgiven after paying for just 10 years under SAVE. Every additional $1,000 borrowed above that amount would add one year of monthly payments to the required time a borrower must pay. Under other repayment plans, borrowers must make at least 20 years of payments before receiving debt forgiveness. The SAVE plan also prevents balances from ballooning due to interest when a borrower has a small monthly payment. If enrolled in SAVE, unpaid interest does not accrue if a borrower makes a fully monthly payment. For example, if $50 in interest accumulates each month and a borrower\u2019s full required payment is just $30, the remaining $20 would be waived. SAVE is separate from the Biden administration\u2019s efforts to cancel student loan debt for some public-sector workers and borrowers who were defrauded by a for-profit college. What\u2019s next for borrowers Borrowers currently enrolled in SAVE can remain in the plan while the merits of the cases are heard. Their monthly payment amounts should remain the same. But there\u2019s a provision of the SAVE plan that was expected to be phased in next month that may be paused if the litigation is ongoing. Starting in July, payments on loans borrowed for undergraduate school were set to be reduced from 10% to 5% of discretionary income for those enrolled in SAVE. And borrowers who have loans from both undergraduate and\u00a0graduate school were expecting to pay a weighted average of between 5% and 10% of their income based upon the original principal balances of their loans. Also, no more student debt will be canceled for borrowers enrolled in SAVE, for now, even if the required number of monthly payments has been made. What the lawsuits say Eleven states, led by Kansas, filed the first lawsuit in late March and another group of seven states led by Missouri filed one soon after. Some of the states are among\u00a0the plaintiffs who sued the Biden administration two years ago over its sweeping, one-time\u00a0student loan forgiveness program. In the legal challenge led by Kansas, the complaint argues that the SAVE plan \u201ctransforms many or most loans into outright grants from the federal government \u2014 without any appropriation from Congress.\u201d In 1993, Congress gave the Department of Education the power to create different repayment plans for borrowers with federal student loans. But the lawsuits say the Biden administration\u2019s SAVE plan goes too far. \u201cCongress never gave Biden the authority to saddle working Americans with half-a-trillion dollars in other people\u2019s debt. A huge win for the Constitution,\u201d Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey said on X Monday. The\u00a0estimated cost of the SAVE plan varies, depending on how many borrowers end up enrolling, ranging from\u00a0$138 billion\u00a0to\u00a0$475 billion\u00a0over 10 years, according to different studies. In comparison, Biden\u2019s student loan forgiveness program was expected to cost about $400 billion.

Under the terms of the new agreement, Justice Department prosecutors will seek a 62-month sentence \u2013 which is equal to the amount of time Assange has served in a high-security prison in London while he fought extradition to the US.\u00a0The plea deal\u00a0would\u00a0credit that time served, allowing Assange to immediately return to Australia, his native country. The plea deal must still be approved by a federal judge, but as of Monday morning, Assange had been released from a UK prison, according to WikiLeaks. \u201cJulian Assange is free. He left Belmarsh maximum security prison on the morning of 24 June, after having spent 1901 days there. He was granted bail by the High Court in London and was released at Stansted airport during the afternoon, where he boarded a plane and departed the UK,\u201d WikiLeaks said a Tuesday\u00a0statement. A video uploaded by the group showed a black van traveling on a motorway followed by footage of Assange boarding a plane. A federal judge in the Northern Mariana Islands set a plea hearing and sentencing for Wednesday morning, according to the US District Court there. Justice Department prosecutors had asked the court for the proceedings to take place on the same day because Assange was resistant to setting foot in the continental US for his guilty plea, according to a letter from prosecutors. The court on the islands is near Australia, where Assange is a citizen and is expected to return to after the court hearing, prosecutors said. Prosecutors told the judge they \u201canticipate that the defendant will plead guilty to the charge \u2026 and be sentenced by the Court for that offense.\u201d Assange\u00a0was being pursued by US authorities for publishing confidential military records supplied by former Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning in 2010 and 2011. He faced 18 counts from a 2019 indictment for his alleged role in the breach that carried a max of up to 175 years in prison, though he was unlikely to be sentenced to that time in full. US officials alleged that Assange goaded Manning into obtaining thousands of pages of\u202funfiltered US diplomatic cables\u202fthat potentially endangered confidential sources, Iraq war-related significant activity reports and information related to Guantanamo Bay detainees. President Joe Biden in recent months has alluded to a possible deal pushed by Australian government officials to return Assange to Australia. FBI and Justice Department officials have opposed any deal that didn\u2019t include a felony guilty plea by Assange, people briefed on the matter told CNN.

Two other crew members have also been cleared to return overseas, a spokesperson for the ship\u2019s manager said. The news came as the Dali cargo vessel started its journey Monday from Baltimore\u2019s Seagirt Marine Terminal to Norfolk, Virginia, to undergo repairs, said Darrell Wilson, spokesperson for ship manager Synergy Marine. Four crew members stayed on the ship to assist a relief crew during the Dali\u2019s voyage to Norfolk, Wilson said. After the journey is complete, they will join the seven remaining crew members, who must stay in the US indefinitely. The Dali\u2019s crew members, including 20 from India and one from Sri Lanka, had been stuck on the Dali since March 26. During the frigid predawn hours, the 984-foot ship lost power, veered off course and destroyed the Francis Scott Key Bridge,\u00a0killing six construction workers. While none of the crew members have been charged in connection with the disaster,\u00a0investigations are underway\u00a0to determine who might be responsible. The ship\u2019s officers are among the 11 crew members who must stay in the US, Wilson said. They have been cooperating with authorities, but it is unclear when they will get to leave. The seamen who will remain in the US are expected to stay in hotels or apartments, said the Rev. Joshua Messick, director of the Baltimore International Seafarers\u2019 Center and chaplain for the Port of Baltimore. \u201cThey\u2019re anxious, under considerable stress, considering they don\u2019t know what the future holds,\u201d Messick told CNN Thursday. \u201cThey don\u2019t know when they\u2019ll see their family again or how they\u2019ll be treated here.\u201d As for the 106,000-ton vessel, \u201cThe Dali is scheduled to transit directly to Virginia International Gateway to have roughly 1,500 cargo containers offloaded to reduce draft,\u201d the US Coast Guard said in a statement Monday morning. \u201cThe vessel is then scheduled to transit further to Norfolk International Terminal, where it is slated to undergo continued salvage and repairs from damage caused during the bridge collapse.\u201d While repair efforts continue, new details have emerged in a federal probe into what caused the deadly disaster. Investigators have zeroed in on a piece of the Dali\u2019s electrical system, which failed moments before the ship crashed into the bridge, the National Transportation Safety Board said in a Monday update. The update follows a preliminary report published last month, which said two circuit breakers on the Dali tripped, triggering a nearly ship-wide electrical blackout about three ships\u2019 lengths from the Francis Scott Key Bridge. On Monday, the NTSB said investigators have finished testing electrical components on board and have removed a wire connector known as a terminal block for further testing at the NTSB lab in Washington, DC. Investigators have found an \u201cinterruption in the control circuit\u201d in one breaker\u2019s undervoltage release, which would cause it to trip when voltage falls below predetermined thresholds, the NTSB said Monday. The NTSB\u2019s update is not final, and the agency has not found a probable cause of the crash, which could take months to determine.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/24/us/dali-crew-members-ship-sails-virginia/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/25/2024", "section": "us"}}

Earlier this month, a bankruptcy judge ruled that Jones\u2019 personal assets would be liquidated to help pay off the nearly $1.5 billion he owes the families of victims of the Sandy Hook massacre. But\u00a0at that time, the judge ruled Jones\u2019\u00a0media company Free Speech Systems, the\u00a0parent\u00a0of Infowars, would not be liquidated partly because the process would be costly and lengthy. The dismissal of the bankruptcy case against the outlet meant that the families were free to go after Jones\u2019 assets, including Infowars, in state court.\u00a0Since Jones is the owner of\u00a0Free Speech Systems, a court appointed trustee was put in charge of the company.
