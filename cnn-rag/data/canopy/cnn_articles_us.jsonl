{"id": "2024_06_18_politics_senate-bump-stock-ban-bill", "text": "Senate Republicans on Tuesday blocked an attempt by Democrats to pass a bill to ban bump stocks in the wake of a recent Supreme Court ruling. The bill\u00a0would enact a federal ban on the sale of bump stock devices. Bump stocks allow a shooter to convert a semi-automatic rifle into a weapon that can fire at a rate of hundreds of rounds a minute. The\u00a0Supreme Court on Friday\u00a0struck down\u00a0a federal ban on bump stocks approved by former President Donald Trump, the latest opinion from the conservative court rolling back firearm regulations. While some Republicans support a ban on bump stocks, the issue has divided GOP senators in the aftermath of the high court ruling. On Tuesday, Democratic Sen. Martin Heinrich of New Mexico made a request on the Senate floor for unanimous consent to pass the bill and Republican Sen. Pete Ricketts of Nebraska objected, calling it a \u201cshow vote.\u201d \u201cAs a firearms owner myself, there\u2019s no legitimate use for a bump stock \u2013 not for self defense, not in a law enforcement context, not even in military applications \u2026 but what they are tailor made for is a mass shooting,\u201d Heinrich said, noting that the bill he was seeking to pass has bipartisan support. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer also spoke on the floor in support of a ban. \u201cThe Senate must step into the breach and pass a federal ban on bump stocks,\u201d Schumer said, calling it a \u201ccommonsense safety measure.\u201d Criticizing the bill as overreach, Ricketts said, \u201cThis bill would ban literally any item that makes a firearm easier and in some cases safer to shoot.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not really about bump stocks, this bill is about banning as many firearm accessories as possible,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s an unconstitutional attack on law-abiding gun owners.\u201d Earlier this week,\u00a0several senior Republican senators expressed a tentative openness to legislation restricting the use of bump stocks, but others\u00a0argued it wasn\u2019t a good idea. Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said \u201cno,\u201d he does not support any legislation restricting or banning bump stocks \u2013 a significant block to any potential bill. \u201cThe court ruling was accurate,\u201d he added. Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, who is running for Senate GOP leader, told reporters, \u201cI\u2019ve been involved in some negotiations regarding firearms, and I\u2019d be happy to listen to what people propose.\u201d Asked if it is a good idea for Congress to act, he was cautious: \u201cI need to see what they want to do.\u201d Sen. Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia also didn\u2019t rule out supporting bump stocks legislation. \u201cI think my understanding of the decision is the Congress has to act on this. So we\u2019ll see if somebody brings something forward, and then I\u2019ll look at it then,\u201d she said. Across the aisle, Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut said that he would check in with Republicans who may be interested in bump stocks legislation to see if there could be a path forward. Murphy said it would be \u201cdifficult\u201d to get a deal in this political climate, but he noted there are plenty of Republicans who have said bump stocks should be banned.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/18/politics/senate-bump-stock-ban-bill/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/19/2024", "section": "us"}}

Vindman is looking to succeed retiring Democratic Rep. Abigail Spanberger in what is expected to be a competitive race this fall with the House GOP\u2019s narrow majority on the line. Vindman and his twin brother, retired Army Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, are best known for their role in the impeachment after both raised concerns about a 2019 phone call between\u00a0Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. In the call, Trump allegedly asked for an investigation into Hunter Biden, the son of then-presidential candidate Joe Biden. Alexander Vindman was a star witness during the 2020 impeachment hearing, and the twins \u2013 who both worked for the National Security Council \u2013\u00a0became heroes to Democratic activists opposed to the former president. Vindman\u2019s role in Trump\u2019s\u00a0impeachment likely made a difference in his campaign. While most of his primary opponents were current and former elected officials, the first-time candidate raised $5 million through May 29, federal records show.

{"id": "2024_06_18_media_jeff-bezos-will-lewis-washington-post", "text": "Jeff Bezos, the billionaire owner of The Washington Post, broke his silence Tuesday on the mounting turmoil within his newspaper, expressing support for maintaining high standards at the storied publication as questions swirl over the ethical integrity of its new publisher, Will Lewis. \u201cI know you\u2019ve already heard this from Will, but I wanted to also weigh in directly: the journalistic standards and ethics at The Post will not change,\u201d Bezos said in an email to top newsroom leaders, signaling support for Lewis, though not explicitly. Bezos added in the memo, which was obtained by CNN, that \u201cit can\u2019t be business as usual\u201d at The Post, which has been plagued by financial and audience woes. \u201cThe world is evolving rapidly and we do need to change as a business. With your support, we\u2019ll do that and lead this great institution into the future,\u201d Bezos wrote. \u201cBut, as the newsroom leaders who\u2019ve been shaping and guiding our coverage, you also know our standards at The Post have always been very high. That can\u2019t change \u2014 and it won\u2019t.\u201d \u201cYou have my full commitment on maintaining the quality, ethics, and standards we all believe in,\u201d Bezos added. The memo to The Post\u2019s top personnel comes after serious questions were raised about Lewis, who has been the subject of several explosive reports in recent days that raise questions over whether he is committed to the newspaper\u2019s rigorous journalistic standards. The New York Times\u00a0reported over the weekend\u00a0that, in his Fleet Street days, Lewis assigned an article that was based on stolen phone records. And The Post itself reported in a 3,000-word\u00a0front page story\u00a0Sunday that a \u201cthief\u201d who used deceptive tactics to obtain private material had ties with Lewis\u2019 hand-picked incoming top editor, Robert Winnett. The stories, which landed like a one-two punch in The Post\u2019s newsroom, followed reports that Lewis tried to suppress stories at The Post and NPR about his role cleaning up Rupert Murdoch\u2019s UK phone hacking scandal, when he served as a lieutenant to the right-wing media mogul. Instead of deescalating the situation, Lewis initially lashed out, going so far as to criticize his own media reporters and launch an on-the-record attack aimed at the well-respected NPR media correspondent David Folkenflik, who he referred to as an \u201cactivist, not a journalist.\u201d Lewis later sent a memo to staffers, striking a notably different, non-confrontational tone. But the note did not quell the growing anger within The Post. Inside The Post\u2019s newsroom, morale has plunged in recent months as alarmed staffers express frustration over Lewis\u2019 conduct and worries over the future direction of the newspaper under his leadership. Interviews with nearly a dozen Post staffers and others familiar with the internal dynamics of the newspaper this week revealed a workforce that has grown increasingly dismayed by the situation, with some searching for work elsewhere. Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, the professor and senior associate dean for leadership studies at the Yale School of Management, told CNN on Monday that Bezos should dismiss Lewis. Sonnenfeld, who has advised US presidents and scores of corporate leaders, said that if he were advising Bezos, he would tell him Lewis has \u201clost legitimacy to lead\u201d and it\u2019s time to \u201cclean the house.\u201d \u201cThis is a tragic meltdown of the conscience of American journalism bringing shame to the Katharine Graham, Ben Bradlee, Marty Baron legacy of collaboration, courage, and integrity,\u201d Sonnenfeld said. \u201cBezos must recruit an accomplished, experienced editor whom journalists admire and trust.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/18/media/jeff-bezos-will-lewis-washington-post/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/19/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_18_us_tubman-combahee-river-south-carolina-reaj", "text": "In the early hours of June 2, 1863, Union army gunboats idled along the banks of South Carolina\u2019s Combahee River, waiting to give the signal to\u00a0the enslaved people hiding ashore. When the boats sounded their steam whistles, more than 700 men, women\u00a0and children fled the plantations\u00a0along the river\u00a0to race toward freedom, in an operation that came to be known as the Combahee Ferry Raid. Harriet Tubman led the secret operation, alongside more than 100 Black Union soldiers \u2013 making her the first woman in US history to lead a major military operation.  This year marks the 161st\u00a0anniversary of the\u00a0raid,\u00a0and the Tabernacle Baptist Church\u00a0\u2013 the first\u00a0Black\u00a0Baptist\u00a0church in Beaufort, South Carolina \u2013 unveiled a\u00a0monument commemorating the pivotal military operation that reshaped the state\u2019s Lowcountry. Ninety-year-old sculptor and engineer Ed Dwight told CNN he spent eight years crafting the statue. The 14-foot bronze\u00a0monument\u00a0features a steamboat, Tubman, two Union soldiers and about a dozen enslaved people seeking freedom. \u201cI could just put a statue of her [Tubman] standing there with none of the kids and other slaves featured \u2026 then put a plaque there to tell the story,\u201d\u00a0Dwight said.\u00a0\u201cBut I had to put that river boat and put this whole thing in context.\u201d Dwight dedicated the early part of his career to the Air Force and became the first Black astronaut candidate in US history, but he was\u00a0denied the opportunity\u00a0to join NASA. He later decided to focus on the arts, creating statues of historical African American figures including Frederick Douglass and Barack Obama. Last month, he completed his first trip to space with Blue Origin.  Dwight told CNN he didn\u2019t come to appreciate the impact historical figures like Tubman had on the nation\u2019s history until much later in life because he\u00a0attended all-White private Catholic schools,\u00a0where African American history wasn\u2019t taught to students. He said it wasn\u2019t until he was gifted a stack of history books that he learned about the important\u00a0figures in Black history. \u201cHarriet Tubman stuck from the very beginning because she was the first name that I could hang on to,\u201d Dwight said. \u201cHere\u2019s this woman, barely 5 feet tall, running around against the odds doing all these incredible things,\u201d he added.\u00a0\u201cI became an early fan of hers and I\u2019ve done several memorials of her.\u201d Rev. Kenneth Hodges, the pastor of Tabernacle Baptist Church,\u00a0said it was only right for\u00a0the church\u00a0to honor Tubman and other historical figures who played a significant role in Beaufort\u2019s history. \u201cMost people don\u2019t know about the raid,\u201d Hodges said of the significance of the statue. \u201cHarriet Tubman is standing on top of the monument and she\u2019s reaching back to the generations yet unborn to come along.\u201d Combahee River Raid Tubman is widely known for escaping slavery and becoming one of the most prominent conductors of the Underground Railroad \u2013 successfully rescuing about 70 enslaved people during more than\u00a0a dozen trips,\u00a0according to the\u00a0National Park Service. When Tubman\u00a0first\u00a0traveled to Beaufort, South Carolina,\u00a0in 1862, there were nearly 200 plantations that held approximately 10,000 enslaved\u00a0people,\u00a0according to the\u00a0National Park Service. Tubman served as a volunteer for the Union Army, working as an informant behind enemy lines in the South, as well as a nurse, laundress and cook before eventually becoming a spy and scout, according to the National Museum of African American History. Just before midnight on June\u00a01, 1863 \u2013\u00a0around\u00a0two years into the Civil War \u2013 Tubman and\u00a0Col.\u00a0James Montgomery of the Union Army\u00a0set sail up the Combahee River, leading three military gunboats of\u00a0about\u00a0150\u00a0Black\u00a0Union soldiers.\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThey knew they had to do it under the cover of darkness,\u201d said Karen Hill, CEO of the Harriet Tubman Home,\u00a0the nonprofit that manages the Harriet Tubman National Historical Park. The ships reached the banks\u00a0of South Carolina\u2019s Lowcountry plantations\u00a0early\u00a0the next morning where more than 700 enslaved people hid in the shadows, waiting for Tubman and the soldiers to sound the\u00a0ships\u2019\u00a0whistles. \u201cWhen she gave the signal, they just came out from the rice fields to the water,\u201d Hill told CNN. Hundreds of men, women, and children escaped to the military ships carrying all their belongings. \u201cThat was the largest raid emancipating [enslaved] people in the United States,\u201d Hill said. Faith and Juneteenth The Tabernacle Baptist Church unveiled the statue and commemorated Tubman\u2019s heroic raid with song, prayer, and speeches during a ceremony earlier this month. Rev.\u00a0Hodges said more than 500 people attended, including Ernestine Wyatt, Tubman\u2019s great-great-great grandniece. \u201cWhen I allow myself to think about it, I begin to cry because I think about how hard life was,\u201d Wyatt\u00a0told CNN. \u201cShe had liberated herself, but it didn\u2019t mean as much to her as it could have because she didn\u2019t have her family there with her.\u201d Wyatt said Tubman\u2019s determination to rescue her enslaved loved ones \u2013 as well as strangers \u2013 despite the life-threatening risks, is a prime example of her unwavering faith in God. \u201cI would have to say that a lot of that [faith] transpired from Aunt Harriet to my great grandmother, to my grandmother, to my mother, and then to me,\u201d Wyatt\u00a0said. \u201cThat part of her is in my DNA.\u201d Faith was a reoccurring theme throughout the commemoration ceremony. \u201cMany people have sown into our present and our future, and it\u2019s important for us to remember them in a meaningful way,\u201d Hodges told CNN. \u201cWe are highlighting the struggle, their faith, their commitment, and their service through the years.\u201d Hodges, a former South Carolina state representative, introduced a bill in 2006 to name a future bridge that would span the Combahee River, the Harriet Tubman Bridge. The bridge now stretches across the blackwater river between Beaufort and Colleton counties.\u00a0\u00a0 Dwight said faith was also a key concept behind the vision for the Tubman sculpture. \u201cMy propensity is to tell larger stories to have people just not look at her and walk away,\u201d he said. \u201cBut to provoke thought \u2026 and to walk away with a picture in their head about what it was like (then) compared to what it is today.\u201d While abolitionists worked to end slavery in\u00a0the United States, many didn\u2019t expect to see it come to fruition during their time on Earth \u2013 except Tubman, according to her great-great-great grandniece. Tubman, she said, would often share that God revealed that her \u201cpeople are free\u201d in a dream and that\u00a0the\u00a0emancipation of\u00a0enslaved people\u00a0was already done. \u201cPrior to the war starting she had a vision,\u201d Wyatt said. Two years after the Combahee Ferry Raid and\u00a0President\u00a0Abraham Lincoln\u2019s\u00a0\u00a0Emancipation Proclamation, the last enslaved people were set free in Texas on June 19, 1865 \u2013\u00a0a day celebrated as\u00a0Juneteenth. Juneteenth became a national holiday in 2021 to commemorate the abolishment of slavery. Tubman died of pneumonia on March 10, 1913, at 91 years old,\u00a0according to the National Women\u2019s History Museum. Surrounded by loved ones, her final words were documented as \u201cI go\u00a0away\u00a0to prepare a place for you,\u201d\u00a0a reference to\u00a0John 14:3 in the Bible,\u00a0according to Kate Clifford Larson, author of \u201cBound for the Promised Land: Harriet Tubman, Portrait of an American Hero.\u201d \u201cAunt Harriet did her part,\u201d Wyatt said. \u201cNow we have to do things to help ourselves heal.\u201d And the best way to do that, she said, is to celebrate freedom. \u201cDo something loving for another person to celebrate that freedom that was given.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/18/us/tubman-combahee-river-south-carolina-reaj/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/19/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_16_us_los-angeles-post-fire", "text": "A fire in Los Angeles County that forced the evacuations of hundreds of people from a state park has burned more than 15,000 acres since it started Saturday, authorities said. The Post Fire had burned 15,611 acres and was 20% contained as of Monday evening,\u00a0according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, also known as Cal Fire. More than 1,000 firefighters were on scene, with more on their way, Los Angeles County Fire Department Section Chief Kenichi Ballew-Haskett told CNN Monday morning. \u201cWe\u2019re getting people on notice that if we have to issue a mandatory evacuation order that they need to leave,\u201d Ballew-Haskett said, advising people residents to have their bags packed, a full tank of gas and cell phones ready. \u201cOnce the sheriffs come by or law enforcement asks you to leave, it means the danger is imminent.\u201d The wildfire began Saturday afternoon in Gorman, an unincorporated community in northwestern Los Angeles County. The cause of the blaze is still under investigation, according to Cal Fire. California State Park Services evacuated 1,200 people from Hungry Valley Park, Cal Fire said. The fire had destroyed one commercial property by Monday evening, according to the Los Angeles County Fire Department. Evacuation orders are in place for areas west of Interstate 5 between Pyramid Lake and Gorman, and evacuation warnings are in place for areas south of Pyramid Lake between Old Ridge Route and the Los Angeles County line. Additional evacuation orders were issued Monday afternoon for the area south of Pyramid Lake, west of I-5, east of the County line and just north of the Templin Highway, the Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department said. As of Monday afternoon, the blaze was not spreading outside its current perimeter, but crews are still concerned about high winds that are supposed to continue through Tuesday afternoon, Fire Public Information Officer Flemming Bertelsen with the Los Padres National Forest\u00a0told CNN. Crews have been maintaining the perimeter of the fire by patrolling the line and looking for spot fires, Bertelsen\u00a0said. \u201cThe fire is not spreading in any significant manner right now, our lines are holding, but we have like 24 hours more of this wind,\u201d Bertelsen said, adding winds have been reaching 50 to 60 mph at the ridge tops. Low humidity is also a major concern, he said. \u201cWe are going to be tested, especially tonight,\u201d he said. The most active part of the fire is close to Piru Creek \u2013 and if it crosses the creek, the wildfire will enter heavy mountain terrain, he said. The National Weather Service in Los Angeles warned Sunday of wind gusts up to 60 to 70 mph, creating conditions that could potentially fuel the flames. A red flag warning was issued for the I-5 corridor in Los Angeles County and the Ventura County mountains until 5 p.m. Monday. Two adults and a child were taken to a hospital with minor injuries, CNN affiliate KABC reported, citing a spokesperson for the Los Angeles County Fire Department. Crews are working to contain the fire and \u201caircraft are working to stop forward progress but have limited visibility,\u201d according to the fire department. Pyramid Lake is also closed because of the threat posed by the fire, the fire department said. Meanwhile in Northern California, the Point Fire had burned about 1,190 acres in Sonoma County and destroyed at least two structures as of Monday evening, according to Cal Fire. Evacuation orders were issued Sunday for some residents, with first responders going door to door to assist, the Sonoma County Sheriff\u2019s Office said. Officials have deployed 36 fire engines, three helicopters, seven dozers, six hand crews and three water tenders to fight the fire, which was about 20% contained by Monday evening, Cal Fire reported. Another wildfire, the Aero Fire, started southeast of Sacramento Monday afternoon and grew with dangerous speed, consuming over 900 acres within just an hour and a half, Cal Fire said in\u00a0a post on Facebook. By Monday evening, it had grown to 1,500 acres. Strong winds are impacting firefighters\u2019 ability to establish a containment line, the post added. Evacuation orders and warnings were in place, according to the post, but aerials from CNN affiliate KCRA show the area is not densely populated. It\u2019s not immediately clear how many structures are threatened in the area. Further north, the Sites Fire in Colusa County had burned more than 4,400 acres and had no containment as of Monday evening, according to Cal Fire.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/16/us/los-angeles-post-fire/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/19/2024", "section": "us"}}

Strain\u2019s body was found in the Cumberland River in West Nashville on the morning of March 22, several miles from where he had gone missing. The 22-year-old University of Missouri student had been in town on a weekend trip two weeks earlier when he was kicked out of a bar, authorities said. The Metropolitan Nashville Police Department said the autopsy, released Tuesday, corroborates the findings of their missing person detectives, and the department is now officially classifying Strain\u2019s death as accidental. The autopsy report said Strain\u2019s blood alcohol level was 0.228, which is almost three times the legal driving limit. The cannabis compound Delta-9 THC was also found in his system, the report said. Police found Strain had consumed \u201cmultiple alcoholic drinks\u201d at different establishments in Nashville, became separated from his friends and was \u201cnoticeably impaired\u201d as he walked onto Gay Street, adjacent to the Cumberland River on the night of March 8. Detectives concluded Strain, unfamiliar with the terrain and walking in the dark, stepped toward an overgrown area and fell down the steep embankment leading to the river and into the water. Due to recent rain, the river was very high that night with a swift current, police said. \u201cThe MNPD continues to extend its heartfelt condolences to Riley Strain\u2019s family and friends,\u201d their statement added.

{"id": "2024_06_18_us_lausd-cell-phone-ban-students", "text": "Students in the nation\u2019s second-largest school district will no longer be able to use cell phones during the school day after the Los Angeles Unified School District\u2019s board voted 5-2 in favor of the ban Tuesday. The move highlights a frustration shared by educators across the country. In the United States, 72% of high school teachers said cell phone distraction \u201cis a major problem in the classroom,\u201d according to a report last week by the Pew Research Center. The Los Angeles ban, which will take effect by the spring 2025 semester, goes beyond the school district\u2019s existing policy, which bans students from using cell phones during class instruction and limits social media use at school to \u201ceducational purposes.\u201d That policy took effect in 2011. Since then, smartphone use has exploded \u2013 both inside and outside the classroom. And students\u2019 addiction to their phones has hurt their socialization, their mental health and their academic success, board member\u00a0Nick Melvoin said. \u201cOur students are glued to their cell phones \u2013 not unlike adults,\u201d said Melvoin, a sponsor of the new ban. \u201cThey\u2019re surreptitiously scrolling in school, in class time. They have their head in their hands walking down the hallways. They\u2019re not talking to each other or playing at lunch or recess because they have their AirPods in.\u201d Research suggests \u201cexcessive cell phone use impacts adolescents mental health and well-being and is associated with increased stress, anxiety, depression, sleep issues, feelings of aggression, and suicidal thoughts,\u201d board members supporting the ban wrote. In addition, \u201cResearch indicates that limiting cell phone usage and social media access during the school day increases academic performance and has positive effects on student mental health,\u201d the proponents said. Questions remain before the ban takes effect\n                   But even board members who voted for the cell phone ban expressed concerns and the need for more answers. Among the concerns: how students would be able to communicate with parents in the event of an emergency, such as a mass shooting. \u201cI think in emergencies and with parent communication, this is definitely where a lot of parents have expressed their concerns to me,\u201d Melvoin said. \u201cI think it\u2019s such a tragic sign of the times, that that is what we initially think of. And we all need to do better in this country when it comes to gun violence prevention and keeping our students safe.\u201d The school board intends to seek input from students, parents, staff and experts on the best ways to implement the ban in all LAUSD schools by the spring semester of the 2024-25 school year. Board member\u00a0Rocio Rivas said \u201cthere are strong arguments on both sides\u201d of the debate. As a mother, Rivas said she was relieved to hear from her son after his school went on lockdown. As a board member who supported the cell phone ban, Rivas said the school district must find ways to make sure parents can be adequately informed in case of an emergency. Failing to notify parents could lead to unintended consequences, she said. \u201cIf there\u2019s an emergency \u2013 parents, if they cannot reach you on the phone \u2013 they\u2019re going to be right there at the school,\u201d Rivas said. And that could put \u201cthemselves in danger\u201d or create other problems. Board members also amended the proposed ban to consider the needs of students who are not fluent in English and might need access to a smartphone if that\u2019s the only way they can get adequate translations. Melvoin said the ban could be implemented in various ways. For example, some schools could ban students\u2019 cell phones from even entering the school, while other schools might require cell phones to be stored in lockers or magnetic pouches. \u201cThere will be differences between schools,\u201d LAUSD School Board President Jackie Goldberg said. \u201cBut the idea is very simple: If you bring your phone to school at all, you park it at the beginning,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019ll put it in a locker or a pouch \u2026 and you\u2019ll pick it up on your way home.\u201d The school board has 120 days to update the district\u2019s existing cell phone policy. After the policy has been updated, it will be presented to the public at a future board meeting, Melvoin\u2019s communication director Ally\u00a0Salvaria said. More states clamp down on students\u2019 cell phones at school California\u2019s state legislature passed a law in 2019 allowing \u2013 but not requiring \u2013 school districts to limit student smartphone use at school. A new bill making its way through the state legislature would require limiting or banning cell phone use by students in the public schools statewide by July 1, 2026, according to the most recent version of\u00a0the bill. Both of the California measures are referenced in the LAUSD proposal. Supporters of LAUSD\u2019s ban cited Oklahoma, Kansas, Vermont, Ohio, Louisiana and Pennsylvania as states that have introduced similar legislation. Board members also noted Florida has blocked access to social media on school district Wi-Fi. While the LAUSD vote happened at a regularly scheduled board meeting, it coincidently followed an topical essay by US Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy. The op-ed, published Monday in The New York Times, called for warning labels on social media apps based on what\u2019s known about the harm they pose to adolescents. CNN\u2019s Laura Studley and Richard Davis contributed to this report.

{"id": "2024_06_17_us_swinomish-tribe-oil-train-trespassing", "text": "Seattle (AP) \u2014 BNSF Railway must pay nearly $400 million to a Native American tribe in Washington state, a federal judge ordered Monday after finding that the company intentionally trespassed when it repeatedly ran 100-car trains carrying crude oil across the tribe\u2019s reservation. US District Judge Robert Lasnik initially\u00a0ruled last year\u00a0that the railway deliberately violated the terms of a 1991 easement with the Swinomish Tribe north of Seattle that allows trains to carry no more than 25 cars per day. The judge held a trial earlier this month to determine how much in profits BNSF made through trespassing from 2012 to 2021 and how much it should be required to disgorge. The company based in Fort Worth, Texas, said in an email it had no comment on the judgment. The tribe, which has about 1,400 members, did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment. The tribe sued in 2015 after BNSF dramatically increased, without the tribe\u2019s consent, the number of cars it was running across the reservation so that it could ship crude oil from the Bakken Formation in and around North Dakota to a nearby refinery. The route crosses sensitive marine ecosystems along the coast, over water that connects with the Salish Sea, where the tribe has treaty-protected rights to fish. Bakken oil is easier to refine into the fuels sold at the gas pump and ignites more easily. After train cars carrying Bakken crude oil exploded in Alabama, North Dakota and Quebec, a federal agency warned in 2014 that the oil has a higher degree of volatility than other crudes in the U.S. Last year, two BNSF engines derailed on Swinomish land, leaking an estimated 3,100 gallons (11,700 liters) of diesel fuel near Padilla Bay. The 1991 easement limited rail traffic to one train of 25 cars per day in each direction. It required BNSF to tell the tribe about the \u201cnature and identity of all cargo\u201d transported across the reservation, and it said the tribe would not arbitrarily withhold permission to increase the number of trains or cars. The tribe learned through a 2011 Skagit County planning document that a nearby refinery would start receiving crude oil trains. It wasn\u2019t until the following year that the tribe received information from BNSF addressing current track usage, court documents show. The tribe and BNSF discussed amending the agreement, but \u201cat no point did the Tribe approve BNSF\u2019s unilateral decision to transport unit trains across the Reservation, agree to increase the train or car limitations, or waive its contractual right of approval,\u201d Lasnik said in his decision last year. \u201cBNSF failed to update the Tribe regarding the nature of the cargo that was crossing the Reservation and unilaterally increased the number of trains and the number of cars without the Tribe\u2019s written agreement, thereby violating the conditions placed on BNSF\u2019s permission to enter the property,\u201d Lasnik said. The four-day trial this month was designed to provide the court with details and expert testimony to guide the judge through complex calculations about how much in \u201cill-gotten\u201d profit BNSF should have to disgorge. Lasnik put that figure at $362 million and added $32 million in post-tax profits such as investment income for a total of more than $394 million. In reality, the judge wrote, BNSF made far more than $32 million in post-tax profits, but adding all of that up would have added hundreds of millions more to what was already a large judgment against the railway.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/17/us/swinomish-tribe-oil-train-trespassing/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/19/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_18_politics_donald-trump-wisconsin-election", "text": "Days after reportedly calling Milwaukee \u201chorrible\u201d behind closed doors, former President Donald Trump will rally with his supporters just south of the city in one of the country\u2019s top battleground states. Trump\u2019s event Tuesday comes less than a month before Republicans gather in Milwaukee for their national convention, where they will nominate the former president for the third time in eight years. At a meeting with House Republicans on Capitol Hill last week, Trump referred to his party\u2019s chosen convention host city as \u201chorrible,\u201d according to a source in the room. The Trump campaign pushed back on some of the public characterization of the alleged remark, saying he was referring to crime and \u201cvoter fraud.\u201d As his alleged comment reverberated around the Badger State, Trump clarified to a Fox News reporter, \u201cI love Milwaukee. I have great friends in Milwaukee\u201d before also criticizing crime there and the city\u2019s stewardship of elections. Milwaukee \u2013 in addition to the state capital of Madison \u2013 is a center of Democratic power in Wisconsin and home to more voters than any other city in the state. One in five of the votes for Joe Biden en route to his narrow Wisconsin victory in 2020 were cast in Milwaukee. The city\u2019s Democratic mayor, Cavalier Johnson, told CNN\u2019s Laura Coates last week that Trump\u2019s alleged remark could prove to be a tactical error. \u201cIn a state that\u2019s decided on a razor\u2019s edge, that may ultimately cost Donald Trump the election,\u201d Johnson said. Democrats have tried to capitalize on the incident to rally support for Biden around the state\u2019s largest city. The Democratic National Committee said Friday it had launched 10 billboards across Milwaukee featuring Trump\u2019s alleged remark. The Biden campaign has begun selling T-shirts and stickers with Milwaukee on a Wisconsin outline and the words: \u201c(Not) a Horrible City.\u201d \u201cI happen to love Milwaukee,\u201d Biden posted on social media Thursday, along with a picture with the Milwaukee Bucks after the team\u2019s NBA championship win in 2021. A focus on crime Trump made crime in major cities a central pillar of his successful 2016 White House bid, and Milwaukee was a poster child for his \u201claw and order\u201d campaign against urban violence. During an appearance just outside the city that year, Trump asserted to a suburban crowd, \u201cThe violence, riots and destruction that have taken place in Milwaukee is an assault on the right of all citizens to live in security and peace.\u201d Trump didn\u2019t come close to winning Milwaukee, but he trounced Democrat Hillary Clinton in the surrounding suburban counties that have become influential in deciding statewide races in Wisconsin. That success helped him become the first Republican presidential nominee to carry Wisconsin since 1988. Both Biden and Trump aggressively campaigned for votes of Wisconsinites during the 2020 election, which ended with Biden winning the state by less than half a point. This year, Trump has once again made crime a central focus of his campaign. In announcing the trip to Racine, the Trump team blamed Biden\u2019s polices for \u201cspiked crime across Wisconsin\u201d and asserted that Milwaukee was \u201cexperiencing the biggest increase in shootings in the country.\u201d But a recent New York Times/Siena College poll from Wisconsin found that less than 1% of registered voters said crime was a top concern as they weigh their presidential options. Meanwhile, violent crime this year is down and murder rates are plunging nationwide, the FBI said earlier this month. Trump\u2019s appearance in Racine marks his second to southeast Wisconsin in less than two months, underscoring the importance of the region in the battle ahead. Two of Biden\u2019s four trips to Wisconsin this year have also put him in the same corner of the Badger State. One of those included an official White House visit to Racine just 20 minutes from where Trump will hold his rally Tuesday. On that visit, Biden spoke at a site where his predecessor once promoted an investment by the Taiwan-based electronics giant Foxconn that later failed. \u201cFoxconn turned out to be just that \u2013 a con,\u201d Biden said. \u201cGo figure.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/18/politics/donald-trump-wisconsin-election/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/19/2024", "section": "us"}}

Whitehead was found guilty in March of two counts of wire fraud, as well as one count each of attempted wire fraud, attempted extortion and making false statements to federal law enforcement agents. The convictions are from three separate schemes. In addition to his prison sentence, the 45-year-old New Jersey man\u00a0\u201cwas sentenced to three years of supervised release and ordered to pay $85,000 in restitution and forfeit $95,000,\u201d\u00a0according to a news release from the US attorney\u2019s office and court documents. \u201cLamor Whitehead is a con man who stole millions of dollars in a string of financial frauds and even stole from one of his own parishioners.\u00a0He lied to federal agents, and again to the Court at his trial.\u00a0Today\u2019s\u00a0sentence puts an end to Whitehead\u2019s various schemes and reflects this Office\u2019s commitment to bring accountability to those who abuse their positions of trust,\u201d US Attorney\u00a0for the Southern District of New York Damian Williams said in the news release. One of Whitehead\u2019s attorneys has previously said they plan to appeal. CNN has reached out to Whitehead\u2019s lawyer for comment. Known for his Louis Vuitton suits and extravagant jewelry, Whitehead was a pastor at the Leaders of\u00a0Tomorrow International Ministries in Brooklyn. He made headlines in 2022 after he said he and his wife were\u00a0robbed of $1 million\u00a0worth of jewelry at their church. Prosecutors said Whitehead defrauded one of his parishioners by convincing her to invest approximately $90,000 of her retirement savings with him so he could help her buy a home; however, he ended up spending the money on luxury goods and personal expenses instead,\u00a0according to\u00a0an indictment. Whitehead also extorted a businessman for $5,000 and then attempted to convince the man to loan him $500,000 and grant him a stake\u00a0in real estate transactions in exchange for obtaining\u00a0\u201cfavorable actions by the New York City government\u201d\u00a0that he knew he could not provide, the indictment said. Whitehead used his ties to New York City Mayor Eric Adams to try to make the deal, the US attorney\u2019s office said in a\u00a0March news release. He also submitted a fraudulent application for a $250,000 business loan that included doctored bank statements, which falsely claimed he had millions of dollars in the bank and hundreds of thousands of dollars in monthly revenue,\u00a0according\u00a0to the US attorney\u2019s office news release. Whitehead\u00a0had \u201csubmitted similar fraudulent applications to various other financial institutions, stealing millions of dollars in the process,\u201d the release\u00a0said. And when speaking to FBI agents who were executing a search warrant outside his New Jersey mansion, Whitehead made false statements by telling the agents he only had one phone, when he actually had two, according to the indictment.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/17/us/bling-bishop-lamor-whitehead-sentenced-fraud-extortion/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/19/2024", "section": "us"}}

Harris was released from Macon State Prison on Father\u2019s Day \u2013 nearly ten years to the day since his son, Cooper, died after his father left him strapped inside a car for seven hours on a hot day while he went to work \u2013 according to the Georgia Department of Corrections website. The father was convicted of Cooper\u2019s murder in 2016 after prosecutors convinced a jury Harris killed his son to escape the burdens of his marriage and fatherhood. But the life sentence was overturned in 2022 by the Georgia Supreme Court, which ruled 6-3 that evidence submitted by prosecutors of Harris\u2019 extramarital relationships \u2013 which the state had portrayed as the motivation behind his alleged decision to kill his son \u2013 had an unfair prejudicial impact on the jury. Though the murder charges were nullified, the court left in place three other counts relating to his electronic exchanges of lewd material\u00a0with an underage girl. Harris was sentenced to a total of 12 years on those three charges: Ten years for one count of attempt to commit sexual exploitation of a child, and one year each for two counts of dissemination of harmful material to a minor, according to the ruling. Prison records state his maximum release date as June 18, 2024, on the sexual exploitation charge and marks his confinement status as \u201cinactive.\u201d Cooper\u2019s death and his father\u2019s trial captivated the nation, in part because hot-car death cases rarely lead to murder charges against grieving parents who insist leaving their child in a hot car was nothing more than a tragic accident. After prosecutors announced last year they would not retry the murder case against Harris, his attorney said Harris was relieved and \u201cthankful that today\u2019s dismissal may begin to restore Cooper\u2019s legacy as a child much loved by his parents.\u201d \u201cRoss has always accepted the moral responsibility for Cooper\u2019s death. But after all these years of investigation and review, this dismissal of charges confirms that Cooper\u2019s death was unintentional and therefore not a crime,\u201d attorney Carlos Rodriguez said in May 2023. \u201cThroughout the course of representing Ross, we have learned that these tragic accidents often happen while the child is in the care of a loving parent. Ross was no different,\u201d Rodriguez said. Cooper\u2019s mother, Leanna Taylor, has stood by her belief that Harris did not intend to kill their child that sweltering day. She said after the Georgia Supreme Court ruling that she hoped it would change how their son is remembered. \u201cThat he was wanted, that he was loved and that he is missed every single day,\u201d she said in a statement released by her attorney. While the trial revealed that on the day their son died, Harris exchanged sexual messages and photos with five women and a 16-year-old minor, Taylor maintained that Harris remained a loving father despite failing their marriage. The couple has since divorced. \u201cRoss was a loving and proud father to Cooper. At the same time Ross was being a terrible husband. These two things can and did exist at the same time.\u201d CNN\u2019s Ray Sanchez contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/18/us/justin-harris-georgia-hot-car-prison-release/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/19/2024", "section": "us"}}

The woman, Cindy Clemishire, told WFAA the abuse started on Christmas Day in 1982 and continued until 1987, when she told her parents. The Wartburg Watch, a church watchdog blog, first reported her account Friday. Morris, a senior pastor at Gateway Church and a member of\ufeff then-candidate Donald Trump\u2019s Evangelical Executive Advisory Board during the 2016 campaign, did not mention the name or age of the girl in his statement but said the inappropriate behavior lasted several years. \u201cWhen I was in my early twenties, I was involved in inappropriate sexual behavior with a young lady in a home where I was staying. It was kissing and petting and not intercourse, but it was wrong. This behavior happened on several occasions over the next few years,\u201d the pastor said in his statement. Morris\u2019 behavior was \u201cbrought to light\u201d in 1987 while he was a pastor at Shady Grove Church in Grand Prairie, which has since become one of Gateway Church\u2019s 11 locations, WFAA reported. \u201cIn March of 1987,\u00a0this situation was brought to light, and\u00a0it was confessed and repented of. I submitted myself to the Elders of Shady Grove Church and the young lady\u2019s father. They asked me to step out of ministry and receive counseling and freedom ministry, which I did. Since that time, I have walked in purity and accountability in this area,\u201d Morris said in his statement, adding he and his wife met with the survivor and her family in 1989. \u201cI asked their forgiveness, and they graciously forgave me,\u201d he said. Clemishire told WFAA that though her family forgave him, they never supported Morris returning to the ministry. \u201cI think leaders can get caught up and think it\u2019s our responsibility to protect God and it\u2019s not. Our responsibility is to protect the people,\u201d she added. \u201cGod is bigger than all of that.\u201d CNN has sought comment from, Morris and Gateway Church, as well as Clemishire and her attorney. In a statement to WFAA, Gateway Church said Morris underwent a two-year \u201crestoration process\u201d after a \u201cmoral failure\u201d in his twenties. \u201cPastor Robert has been open and forthright about a moral failure he had over 35 years ago when he was in his twenties and prior to him starting Gateway Church. He has shared publicly from the pulpit the proper Biblical steps he took in his lengthy restoration process,\u201d the church\u2019s statement said. \u201cThe two-year restoration process was closely administered by the Elders at Shady Grove Church and included him stepping out of the ministry during that period while receiving professional counseling and freedom ministry counseling,\u201d the statement continued. \u201cSince the resolution of the 35-year-old matter, there have been no other moral failures.\u201d In 2016, Morris was part of Trump\u2019s Evangelical Executive Advisory Board, the campaign announced in a\u00a0news release at the time. Trump also held a\u00a0roundtable at Gateway\u2019s Dallas campus in 2020 and Morris led a prayer before the event. Morris does not have a role with the 2024 campaign, Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung told CNN. Morris\u2019 son,\u00a0James Morris, will take over senior pastor\u00a0duties in 2025 with the elder Morris remaining a primary speaker on weekends, according to\u00a0the church\u2019s website.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/17/us/robert-morris-gateway-church-sexual-abuse-allegations/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/19/2024", "section": "us"}}

{"id": "2024_06_18_us_usa-swimming-coach-abuse-lawsuit", "text": "A former high-level swimmer accused her Hall of Fame coach of sexually abusing her about 15 years ago when she was a minor  and alleged USA Swimming and other organizations and individuals knew about the abuse and did nothing to stop it, according to a federal lawsuit. The suit from Amanda Le was filed against\u00a0\u201cthe individuals and corporate entities who let a known child rapist work as a youth swim coach, who supported him with infrastructure, position, and prestige for decades, and who allowed him full access to a never-ending cycle of young girls to prey upon,\u201d the suit states. \u201cAmanda Le was one of those girls.\u201d Filed in US District Court in Massachusetts on Friday, the 33-page lawsuit alleges sexual abuse on the part of Joseph Bernal, the former Fordham and Harvard swim coach who served on the US coaching staff at the 1984 and 1988 Olympics. He coached multiple Olympic medalists and world record holders and was inducted into the American Swim Coaches Hall of Fame in 2015, the lawsuit states. He also founded the Bernal\u2019s Gator Swim Club, an amateur swim club, and coached Le from 2006 to 2010. Bernal sexually abused Le from about 2008 to 2014, the lawsuit states. In February 2016, USA Swimming permanently banned Bernal for his abuse of an unnamed \u201cAthlete A,\u201d the lawsuit states. That athlete was Le, the suit states. Bernal is named on a USA Swimming website listing individuals permanently suspended or ineligible for membership, due to \u201csexual misconduct.\u201d \u201cUSA Swimming is deeply committed to the safety and welfare of all its members,\u201d the organization\u2019s then-spokesman Scott Leightman said in 2016 in a statement to The Boston Globe. \u201cThe Safe Sport program\u2019s mission is to increase awareness to reduce the risk for abuse in sport and our organization has no tolerance for violations of our code of conduct.\u2019\u2019 CNN reached out to USA Swimming for comment on the lawsuit. CNN has also reached out to an attorney for Bernal\u2019s estate and other defendants named in the lawsuits for comment. Bernal died in October 2022, according to an obituary. The lawsuit comes amid a series of allegations of abuse and wrongdoing in the national governing bodies that oversee elite-level youth sports like USA Swimming. In 2021, for example, USA Gymnastics, the US Olympic and Paralympic Committee and their insurers agreed to pay $380 million in a settlement with the victims of Larry Nassar, the former Olympic doctor who sexually abused girls for decades. Jon Little, Le\u2019s attorney, told CNN there is a culture that allows this abuse to happen. \u201cWhile what happened to her is sad, it\u2019s far from uncommon,\u201d Little said. \u201cPeople like Larry Nassar and Bernal, that produce Olympic medalists \u2013 as long as these guys produce medals and money, they can literally rape children. The system is designed to protect the producers. Getting rid of Nassar and Bernal does not change the problem.\u201d The attorney said Le filed the lawsuit to let kids know they are not alone. \u201cShe felt alone back then, but she doesn\u2019t now,\u201d Little said. What the lawsuit alleges According to the lawsuit, Le trained and competed with Bernal\u2019s Gator Swim Club of New England, known as BGSC-NE, from 13 to 18 years old. When she was 15 and Bernal was in his mid-60s, he kissed her after practice, and the sexual contact escalated over the next few years, the lawsuit states. \u201cWhile she was in high school, Amanda started to have panic attacks, which she believed at the time were due solely to the stress of swimming; she knew that (she) was afraid of performing poorly because she would be punished,\u201d the suit states. \u201cAmanda was also suffering the consequences of the sexual abuse, although she did not realize it at the time.\u201d On several overnight team trips, Le slept in Bernal\u2019s hotel room, the lawsuit states. From her junior year of high school into her senior year, she would skip school and the coach would pick her up and take her to his house for sex, according to the lawsuit. Le went to college from 2011 to 2014, and as a junior, Bernal impregnated Le and then paid for an abortion, the lawsuit states. The abuse continued even though some adults knew about it, according to the lawsuit. In one instance, Le\u2019s mother found her diary, which detailed her relationship with Bernal, and Le\u2019s parents then showed it to another coach for Bernal\u2019s Gator Swim Club, the lawsuit states. That coach did not contact law enforcement and \u201cdid nothing to protect Amanda,\u201d the suit states. In addition, USA Swimming \u201cwas aware of complaints about Bernal\u2019s inappropriate behavior with minor female swimmers\u201d before Le began the sport, the suit alleges. The suit accuses Bernal, USA Swimming and other defendants of violating the Trafficking Victims Protection Act. Further, the lawsuit accuses Bernal of sexual abuse and the others of negligence. Bernal was previously named in an August 2021 lawsuit in which Kimberly Stines accused him of a \u201cfive-year campaign of systemic emotional and sexual abuse\u201d beginning in 1976. USA Swimming is not a defendant in the lawsuit. Little, who also represents Stines, said the litigation is ongoing and a trial is expected sometime in late 2025 or early 2026. He said the system failed to protect Stines. \u201cThe system failed her and now she feels guilty that there is an Amanda Le,\u201d he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/18/us/usa-swimming-coach-abuse-lawsuit/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/19/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_18_business_netflix-house-locations-experiential-venues", "text": "Netflix is opening massive entertainment venues in two cities that it says will allow fans to immerse themselves in the worlds of their favorite shows. The \u201cexperiential\u201d complexes, called Netflix Houses, will include elaborate events, themed gift shops and restaurants. In a repurposing of empty retail space, the houses will occupy former department store locations at Dallas Galleria and King of Prussia mall (near Philadelphia). Both will span more than 100,000 square feet and are set to open in 2025, according to the streaming giant. It\u2019s Netflix\u2019s TV tweak on a theme park. For fans of its \u201cSquid Game\u201d dark drama and related reality show, for example, Netflix promises to recreate the program\u2019s Glass Bridge challenge. Competitors walk or jump across clear panels that shatter \u2014 and drop them \u2014 if they stand on the wrong one. It\u2019s a risky move. Critics of the expansion note that attracting repeat business will be challenging. \u201cOne of the keys to success will be to keep the offer refreshed, so that it keeps people coming back to what\u2019s new,\u201d said Neil Saunders, managing director and retail analyst at GlobalData. Netflix has already had considerable success with elaborate touring productions and events tied to some of its higher-profile programming. Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, is currently hosting a tour of \u201cBridgerton\u201d High Tea; Toronto has a \u201cKnives Out\u201d dinner party; and S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil offers an immersive \u201cStranger Things\u201d experience. Risks and rewards All this is not a new idea, though. \u201cDisney has monetized its content for years and has a very successful retail business through licensing, its own stores, and shop-in-shop concepts,\u201d said Saunders. For Netflix, it\u2019s just the latest move in a series of efforts to broaden its profile and income beyond standard streaming\u2014 even though the bulk of its profits have come from its core business. These new initiatives come at a time profits in the streaming industry are getting squeezed. So the company has cut back on creating original programming but has expanded its video game offerings, rolling out mobile-friendly games from the \u201cGrand Theft Auto\u201d franchise. In a brand extension, It also partnered with Williams Sonoma on a line of \u201cBridgerton\u201d-themed dinnerware, paper goods, foods and linens. TikTok influencer, product reviewer and \u201cBridgerton\u201d fan Carrie Berk, who has twice attended \u201cThe Queen\u2019s Ball\u201d said she thinks Netflix\u2019s new venture will be met with success. (She was not compensated by Netflix or given tickets to the events.) \u201cI think that it\u2019s brilliant that Netflix is bringing that magic IRL!\u201d she said. (IRL stands for \u201cin real life.\u201d) For years, \u201cThe Queen\u2019s Ball\u201d has been staged in various cities two or three times daily. Fans could enjoy dances and watch performances by violin players and acrobats dressed in historically accurate garb under chandelier lighting. In keeping with the show\u2019s plot, the Queen named a \u201cDiamond of the Season\u201d at each performance. Social media influencers were invited to write a letter and make their case for why they should be chosen, illustrating Netflix\u2019s keen interest in the social media world. Now, \u201cNetflix House represents the next generation of our distinctive offerings,\u201d said Netflix Chief Marketing Officer Marian Lee, in a statement. \u201cThe venues will bring our beloved stories to life in new ever-changing, and unexpected ways.\u201d Berk agreed and told CNN of her experience, \u201cIt really made me feel like I stepped into the world of the show.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/18/business/netflix-house-locations-experiential-venues/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/19/2024", "section": "us"}}

The riders were then evacuated and medically evaluated. One rider was transported to the hospital for further evaluation and the others were released by medics, according to the park. Daniel Allen, who was on the ride when it stopped, told CNN affiliate KATU that the restriction of the harness on his chest made it difficult for him to breathe because he has asthma. \u201cI was crying, not of joy, not of anything, I was just crying.

The AtmosFEAR ride, in which riders can choose to spin either 360 or 180 degrees, has been closed until further notice, according to the park\u2019s website. It has been in operation since 2021 and the park had no issues with it, according to the statement from the park. The park said it will work with the manufacturer and state inspectors to identify what caused the incident. Friday was the opening day for the 2024 season of the amusement park, according to the park\u2019s\u00a0Facebook page.

US District Judge Charlotte Sweeney handed down the sentence after hearing from the victims\u2019 families and survivors of the shooting, many of whom were disappointed Aldrich would not face a capital sentence. \u201cFueled by hate, the defendant targeted members of the LGBTQIA+ community at a place that represented belonging, safety, and acceptance \u2013 stealing five people from their loved ones, injuring 19 others, and striking fear across the country,\u201d said Attorney General Merrick B. Garland in a statement after the sentencing. Sweeney, the first LGBTQ+ federal judge to serve in Colorado, did not have the discretion to impose a different sentence, she told them, citing the plea agreement. But she emphasized the importance of Aldrich\u2019s decision to plead guilty: In doing so, she said, Aldrich admitted to carrying out the attack because of the victims\u2019 \u201cactual or perceived gender identity or sexual orientation.\u201d \u201cThis community is stronger than your armor, stronger than your weapons and stronger than your hatred,\u201d she told Aldrich, nothing she was sentencing him during Pride Month. Aldrich, 24, is already serving five consecutive life terms and an additional 2,212 years without the possibility of parole at the Wyoming State Penitentiary after pleading guilty in 2023 to state charges for the attack, which targeted one of the few LGBTQ+ spaces in Colorado Springs, fostering a safe and inclusive atmosphere in a conservative community. \u201cI loved that place,\u201d Ashtin Gamblin, who was shot nine times and survived, said during her victim impact statement prior to sentencing. While she is not a member of the LGBTQ+ community, Gamblin said, she is an ally. \u201cI loved everybody there,\u201d she said, crediting Club Q\u2019s bar supervisor, Daniel Aston, with saving her life before he was killed. Aside from Aston, Derrick Rump, another Club Q employee, was also killed, as well as Ashley Paugh, Kelly Loving and Raymond Green Vance. Many of those who testified Tuesday expressed anger for the shooter, and the pain Aldrich caused them or their families. Aldrich \u2013 who appeared in court in an orange prison uniform \u2013 was largely expressionless, or nodded while listening to the statements. \u201cYou took my only sibling,\u201d said Stephanie Clark, Paugh\u2019s sister, who also testified at Aldrich\u2019s state sentencing. \u201cBut I wanted to look you in the eye one more time and tell you I will never forgive you, nor will my family,\u201d Clark said. \u201cYou don\u2019t deserve that.\u201d Wyatt Kent, who performed as a drag queen the night of the shooting, said it was difficult to prepare this statement during Pride Month, but pointed to the resilience of the LGBTQ+ community. \u201cI forgive you,\u201d Kent said. \u201cWe, the queer community, we are the resilient ones. We continue to hold that beauty within each other. We continue to find joy in the trauma and in the pain.\u201d \u201cUnfortunately,\u201d Kent said, \u201cthose are things you will never experience for the rest of your life.\u201d A \u2018brazen and calculated\u2019 attack In a sentencing statement submitted to the court prior to Tuesday\u2019s hearing, the Justice Department called the shooting a \u201cbrazen and calculated\u201d attack on the club\u2019s employees and patrons, describing it as a \u201cbias-motivated, premeditated, mass-casualty attack.\u201d Aldrich began the massacre at the club as patrons were gathering for Transgender Day of Remembrance, for which Club Q had scheduled a weekend of events, including a drag show. The shooter spent more than $9,000 buying weapons and visited the club several times before, becoming familiar with the layout, according to the sentencing document. Aldrich had expressed an open hatred for the LGBTQ+ community and had indicated an interest in mass shootings before, the document said. Then, in the late hours of November 19, 2022, the then-22-year-old entered the club carrying an AR-15 style assault rifle and began \u201cfiring at everyone in sight,\u201d according to the sentencing document. Some patrons hid or played dead as Aldrich moved though the club, shooting indiscriminately. The violence came to an end when an army veteran took down the shooter, aided by a Navy petty officer and a drag performer at the club. The shooting provided an echo of the devastating 2016 shooting at Pulse, an LGBTQ+ nightclub in Orlando, Florida, which left 49 people dead. Several victims who were shot but survived have required surgery for their injuries and continue to face medical challenges, including loss of mobility and post-traumatic stress disorder. For Colorado Springs\u2019 queer community, the mass shooting was traumatic. The club served as a crucial safe haven for people from a variety of backgrounds living in a conservative stronghold. One trans man who worked as a drag king at Club Q told CNN after the shooting, \u201cOur safety as queer people in Colorado Springs is now questioned. I\u2019m scared to be myself as a trans man in this community.\u201d Aldrich has faced heavy sentencing for the brutal attack: The 2023 sentence was the second-longest ever given in Colorado, behind only the 2012 Aurora theater mass shooting, according to the district attorney. This is a developing story and will be updated. Correction: A previous version of this story misstated the status of Anderson Lee Aldrich\u2019s plea. The shooter agreed in January to plead guilty to federal charges stemming from the Club Q shooting.

Victor Antonio Martinez-Hernandez, a citizen of El Salvador, was arrested at a bar in Tulsa, Oklahoma, on Friday night, according to the\u00a0Tulsa Police Department. \u201cOfficers found the suspect casually sitting at the bar and placed him under arrest. Initially the suspect lied about his true identity and denied any knowledge of the crimes he is wanted for,\u201d the department said in a post on Facebook. Martinez-Hernandez was taken into custody on a trespassing charge, but when officers ran his information, they found he was wanted in connection with a rape and murder in Maryland. He faces charges of first-degree rape and first-degree murder in that case, authorities said. On Monday, he\u00a0signed a waiver authorizing Maryland authorities to extradite him from Oklahoma to Maryland for prosecution, Harford County Sheriff\u2019s Office Director of Media and Public Relations Cristie Hopkins told CNN. During a\u00a0news conference\u00a0on Saturday, Harford County Sheriff Jeff Gahler said the extradition could take at least 10 days. Martinez-Hernandez is suspected of multiple crimes since he illegally crossed the border into the United States in February of 2023, Gahler said. One of those crimes is the rape and murder of Rachel Morin, a Maryland mother of five, the sheriff said. Morin was killed along a hiking trail in Bel Air in August of 2023, according to authorities. \u201cWe all suspected that perhaps Rachel was not his first victim. And it\u2019s my understanding that this suspect, this monster, fled to the United States illegally after committing the brutal murder of a young woman in El Salvador a month earlier in January,\u201d Gahler said. \u201cI never want him to leave Maryland again. I want him to die in a Maryland jail.\u201d On May 20, what would have been Morin\u2019s 38th birthday, investigators finally uncovered a lead that led them to Martinez-Hernandez, Gahler said during the news conference. The lead was a piece of DNA evidence left at a crime scene in Los Angeles where police say Martinez-Hernandez brutally attacked a 9-year-old girl and her mother during a home invasion in March of 2023. William DelBagno, special agent in charge of the FBI Baltimore Field Office,\u00a0said their investigative genetic genealogy team traced that DNA to potential family members and even traveled to El Salvador to help identify the suspected\u00a0killer. \u201cWe know nothing can take away the pain and the anguish Rachel\u2019s family and friends have endured. Please know, on behalf of the FBI, our hearts are with you,\u201d DelBagno said. Morin\u2019s mother, Patricia Morin, attended the news conference and expressed gratitude to authorities for their hard work and to the media for keeping her daughter\u2019s story alive. \u201cI am so grateful that they have brought us to this place. At some of the points during this, I didn\u2019t think that we were ever going to have an end, that it was going to be a cold case,\u201d Patricia Morin said. The room then erupted in applause. Speaking with CNN affiliate WBFF, Matt McMahon, the father of Morin\u2019s eldest daughter, said that he felt \u201cjoy, relief, gratitude\u201d at the news of Martinez-Hernandez\u2019 arrest as well as sadness at the things Morin would never be able to experience. McMahon and Morin\u2019s daughter, 18-year-old Faye, is set to have her own daughter this year, he told WBFF. \u201cIt\u2019s a happy moment and a sad moment too because Rachel should be here for that moment,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd Faye should be able to give Rachel that news, to tell Rachel you\u2019re going to be a grandmother. But she can never give that news.\u201d Alison Healey, Harford County State\u2019s Attorney, is leading the prosecution of this case and said it will commence once the suspect\u00a0has been transported back to Harford County.

In a statement obtained by CNN affiliate\u00a0WFAA, the Board of Elders of Gateway Church said that prior to June 14, they didn\u2019t have all the facts of the abuse. The board said it has retained\u00a0a law firm to conduct an independent review of the report of past abuse to fully understand the events that took place from 1982-1987. \u201cThe elders\u2019 prior understanding was that Morris\u2019s extramarital relationship, which he discussed many times throughout his ministry, was with \u2018a young lady\u2019 and not abuse of a 12-year-old child,\u201d the statement reads. \u201cEven though it occurred many years before Gateway was established, as leaders of the church, we regret that we did not have the information that we now have.\u201d The elders said they were \u201cheartbroken and appalled\u201d and expressed sympathy to the victim and her family. The woman, Cindy Clemishire, told WFAA the abuse started on Christmas Day in 1982 and continued until 1987, when she told her parents. The Wartburg Watch, a church watchdog blog,\u00a0first reported\u00a0her account Friday. \u201cWhen I was in my early twenties, I was involved in inappropriate sexual behavior with a young lady in a home where I was staying. It was kissing and petting and not intercourse, but it was wrong. This behavior happened on several occasions over the next few years,\u201d the pastor said in a statement. Morris\u2019 behavior was \u201cbrought to light\u201d in 1987 while he was a pastor at Shady Grove Church in Grand Prairie, which has since become one of Gateway Church\u2019s 11 locations, WFAA reported. \u201cIn March of 1987,\u00a0this situation was brought to light, and\u00a0it was confessed and repented of. I submitted myself to the Elders of Shady Grove Church and the young lady\u2019s father. They asked me to step out of ministry and receive counseling and freedom ministry, which I did. Since that time, I have walked in purity and accountability in this area,\u201d Morris said in his statement, adding he and his wife met with the survivor and her family in 1989. \u201cI asked their forgiveness, and they graciously forgave me,\u201d he said. Clemishire told WFAA that though her family forgave him, they never supported Morris returning to the ministry. \u201cI think leaders can get caught up and think it\u2019s our responsibility to protect God and it\u2019s not. Our responsibility is to protect the people,\u201d she added. \u201cGod is bigger than all of that.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/18/us/robert-morris-gateway-church-sexual-abuse-allegations-resignation/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/19/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_17_us_missouri-sandra-hemme-conviction-overturned-killing", "text": "(AP) \u2014 A judge has overturned the conviction of a Missouri woman who was a psychiatric patient when she incriminated herself in a 1980 killing that her attorneys argue was actually committed by\u00a0a now-discredited police officer. Judge Ryan Horsman ruled late Friday that Sandra Hemme, who has spent 43 years behind bars, had established evidence of actual innocence and must be freed within 30 days unless prosecutors retry her. He said her trial counsel was ineffective and prosecutors failed to disclose evidence that would have helped her. Her attorneys say this is the longest time a woman has been incarcerated for a wrongful conviction. They filed a motion seeking her immediate release. \u201cWe are grateful to the Court for acknowledging the grave injustice Ms. Hemme has endured for more than four decades,\u201d her attorneys said in a statement, promising to keep up their efforts to dismiss the charges and reunite Hemme with her family. A spokesperson for Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey didn\u2019t immediately respond to a text or email message seeking comment Saturday. Hemme was shackled in leather wrist restraints and so heavily sedated that she \u201ccould not hold her head up straight\u201d or \u201carticulate anything beyond monosyllabic responses\u201d when she was first questioned about the death of 31-year-old library worker Patricia Jeschke, according to her lawyers with the New York-based Innocence Project. They alleged in a petition seeking her exoneration that authorities ignored Hemme\u2019s \u201cwildly contradictory\u201d statements and suppressed evidence implicating Michael Holman, a then-police officer who tried to use the slain woman\u2019s credit card. The judge wrote that \u201cno evidence whatsoever outside of Ms. Hemme\u2019s unreliable statements connects her to the crime.\u201d \u201cIn contrast,\u201d he added, \u201cthis Court finds that the evidence directly ties Holman to this crime and murder scene.\u201d It started on Nov. 13, 1980, when Jeschke missed work. Her worried mother climbed through a window at her apartment and discovered her daughter\u2019s nude body on the floor, surrounded by blood. Her hands were tied behind her back with a telephone cord and a pair of pantyhose was wrapped around her throat. A knife was under her head. The brutal killing grabbed headlines, with detectives working 12-hour days to solve it. But Hemme wasn\u2019t on their radar until she showed up nearly two weeks later at the home of a nurse who once treated her, carrying a knife and refusing to leave. Police found her in a closet, and took her back to St. Joseph\u2019s Hospital, the latest in a string of hospitalizations that began when she started hearing voices at the age of 12. She had been discharged from that very hospital the day before Jeschke\u2019s body was found, showing up at her parents\u2019 house later that night after hitchhiking more than 100 miles (160 kilometers) across the state. The timing seemed suspicious to law enforcement. As the interrogations began, Hemme was being treated with antipsychotic drugs that had triggered involuntary muscle spasms. She complained that her eyes were rolling back in her head, the petition said. Detectives noted that Hemme seemed \u201cmentally confused\u201d and not fully able to comprehend their questions. \u201cEach time the police extracted a statement from Ms. Hemme it changed dramatically from the last, often incorporating explanations of facts the police had just recently uncovered,\u201d her attorneys wrote. Eventually, she claimed to have watched a man named Joseph Wabski kill Jeschke. Wabski, whom she met when they stayed in the state hospital\u2019s detoxification unit at the same time, was charged with capital murder. But prosecutors quickly dropped the case upon learning he was at an alcohol treatment center in Topeka, Kansas, at the time. But police also were starting to look at another suspect \u2014 one of their own. About a month after the killing, Holman was arrested for falsely reporting that his pickup truck had been stolen and collecting an insurance payout. It was the same truck spotted near the crime scene, and the officer\u2019s alibi that he spent the night with a woman at a nearby motel couldn\u2019t be confirmed. Furthermore, he had tried to use Jeschke\u2019s credit card at a camera store in Kansas City, Missouri, on the same day her body was found. Holman, who ultimately was fired and died in 2015, said he found the card in a purse that had been discarded in a ditch. During a search of Holman\u2019s home, police found a pair of gold horseshoe-shaped earrings in a closet, along with jewelry stolen from another woman during a burglary earlier that year. Jeschke\u2019s father said he recognized the earrings as a pair he bought for his daughter. But then the four-day investigation into Holman ended abruptly, many of the details uncovered never given to Hemme\u2019s attorneys. Hemme, meanwhile, was growing desperate. She wrote to her parents on Christmas Day 1980, saying, \u201cEven though I\u2019m innocent, they want to put someone away, so they can say the case is solved.\u201d She said she might as well change her plea to guilty. \u201cJust let it end,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m tired.\u201d And that is what she did the following spring, when she agreed to plead guilty to capital murder in exchange for the death penalty being taken off the table. Even that was a challenge; the judge initially rejected her guilty plea because she couldn\u2019t share enough details about what happened, saying: \u201cI really didn\u2019t know I had done it until like three days later, you know, when it came out in the paper and on the news.\u201d Her attorney told her that her chance to not be sentenced to death was to get the judge to accept her guilty plea. After a recess and some coaching, she provided more information. That plea later was thrown out on appeal. But she was convicted again in 1985 after a one-day trial in which jurors weren\u2019t told of what her current attorneys describe as \u201cgrotesquely coercive\u201d interrogations. Larry Harman, who helped Hemme get her initial guilty plea thrown out and later became a judge, said in the petition that he believed she was innocent. \u201cThe system,\u201d he said, \u201cfailed her at every opportunity.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/17/us/missouri-sandra-hemme-conviction-overturned-killing/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/19/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_17_us_louisiana-mississippi-child-abuction-death-charges", "text": "Two people arrested in Mississippi \u2013 including a man accused of killing a Louisiana woman last week and abducting her 4- and 6-year-old daughters, one of whom was found dead \u2013 have each been charged with capital murder and sexual battery in the children\u2019s cases, police in Mississippi said Monday. Daniel Callihan and Victoria Cox were arrested last week in Mississippi after authorities looking for the missing girls found the 4-year-old dead and the 6-year-old injured Thursday at a Jackson location investigators say could be tied to human trafficking, authorities had said. Authorities in Louisiana had said Callihan is accused of killing the children\u2019s mother, Callie Brunett, at her home in Loranger, Louisiana, and abducting the girls \u2013 a case that prompted investigators to issue an Amber Alert for the children hours before police found them more than 100 miles to the north in Jackson. Callihan and Cox are charged in Mississippi in connection with crimes against the children, Jackson Police Chief Joseph Wade said Monday. Charges in Louisiana and federal charges are still pending, Wade said. Cox is accused of being Callihan\u2019s accomplice, Wade has said without elaborating. CNN has been unable to identify attorneys for Callihan or Wade. Wade said he believes the 4-year-old girl, whose body was found unburied in woods behind a Jackson home, was suffocated or died from asphyxiation. The cause of death will be determined by a medical examiner, he said. When asked whether Mississippi would seek the death penalty, Wade said that decision would be made by prosecutors, but \u201cI think if there is a case that would definitely rise to the level of the death penalty, this would be it \u2013 because I still have imprinted in my head the site of that 4-year-old, in the woods, dead.\u201d \u201cWe do not anticipate right now, on the state level, charging anybody else outside of those two,\u201d Wade said Monday. \u201cThe city of Jackson, (the state of) Louisiana and the whole Gulf South Region is a better place because those two are behind bars.\u201d Authorities have not discussed motives in the deaths of Brunett and the 4-year-old, or the children\u2019s abductions. In a court appearance on Monday, Cox asserted she had nothing to do with what Callihan is accused of doing, and that both girls were alive the last time she saw them in Jackson, according to CNN affiliate WLBT. A judge on Monday said Cox could be held without opportunity for bond for the capital murder charge, and bond for Cox\u2019s sexual battery charge was set at $500,000, WLBT reported. How the investigation unfolded An Amber Alert was issued Thursday for Brunett\u2019s daughters after Brunett was found dead in her southeastern Louisiana home, Louisiana\u2019s Tangipahoa Parish Sheriff\u2019s Office has said. The alert said a man \u2013 who authorities later said was Callihan \u2013 was wanted \u201cfor questioning for a domestic violence incident, which occurred at the time of the abduction and resulted in a homicide.\u201d Investigators believe Callihan had dated Brunett \u201coff and on,\u201d Tangipahoa Parish Sheriff\u2019s Office Chief Jimmy Travis said last week. Hours after the Amber Alert, law enforcement in Jackson \u2013 some 130 miles north of Brunett\u2019s Louisiana home \u2013 tracked down Callihan and found a \u201ctragic scene,\u201d Wade has said. After a short pursuit, Callihan was arrested in a wooded area near a Jackson house and authorities found the body of the 4-year-old, according to Wade. The 6-year-old was found injured and was taken to a hospital, police said. The 6-year-old still is recovering in Jackson, Wade said Monday. Small cages and small wiring enclosures at the Jackson site have led investigators to believe human trafficking could have happened there, Wade said Monday. Cox was arrested Friday at a motel in south Jackson, Wade has said. As Callihan was being escorted by officers from the Jackson police headquarters Friday, a reporter asked him why he allegedly killed the girl. \u201cI have no reason for what I did,\u201d Callihan told reporters. He added he\u2019d been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder. Callihan, when talking with investigators, did not deny anything and implicated Cox, Wade said Monday. Cox is an acquaintance of Callihan, the chief said last week. A GoFundMe page was created \u201cin loving support of the Brunett family in a time of unimaginable suffering\u201d to raise money for funeral costs for Brunett and her 4-year-old daughter, and to help support the family and surviving child navigate the tragedy.

The unique Juneteenth drink, along with numerous other red-hued foods and beverages, symbolizes the bloodshed and the profound sacrifices made by former enslaved Black Americans, according to food historian Adrian E Miller. Miller also noted that red is a royal color in African society, adding depth to the folklore surrounding Juneteenth. On June 19, communities around the country will gather with food, parades, games, music, and vibrant displays of Black culture to celebrate the rich tapestry of resilience and triumph that embodies Juneteenth. A combination of the words June and nineteenth,\u00a0June 19, 1865\u00a0is the day that\u00a0Union Army Maj. Gen. Gordon Granger\u00a0rode into Galveston, Texas, and issued\u00a0General Order No. 3,\u00a0proclaiming that the enslaved African Americans they were free. This announcement came\u00a0two and a half years\u00a0after President Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation, which couldn\u2019t be enforced in areas under Confederate control. Despite being freed years earlier, this was the first-time enslaved Texans were told about their freedom, ending the practice of slavery in the United States. After years of being celebrated mostly by Black Americans, in 2021\u00a0Juneteenth became a federal holiday\u00a0in the US \u2014 the first to be approved since Martin Luther King Jr. Day in 1983. Many Black Americans commemorate the freedom from enslavement granted on that day with an array of red foods, such as barbecue, watermelon, red velvet cake, and strawberry pie. Streets will come alive with the aromas of grilled meats and spices mingling with the sweet scents of freshly baked pies and cakes. \u201cI think food is the glue,\u201d Hall told CNN. The renowned chef, who became known for her culinary prowess on the hit TV series Top Chef and The Chew, said food is \u201cthe way we carry those stories of our ancestors.\u201d While recipes may differ from generation to generation, Hall said food can be a source of unity and that often helps people maintain their roots. \u201cSo, I think in the spirit of this holiday \u2026 for me, it\u2019s about, getting to know me, getting to understand me and what my contributions \u2013 my ancestors contributions \u2013 are through food,\u201d Hall said. With roots in Texas, and dyed a vibrant red hue, Big Red Soda has become a common drink served at many Juneteenth celebrations.\u00a0But Miller noted, the Juneteenth menu is evolving, embracing inventive twists on tradition. In addition to preparing classics, such as barbeque, Hall said each year she tries to challenge herself to become more creative with her Juneteenth recipes. She incorporates hibiscus \u2013 which infuses food with a deep red color \u2013 into her meats, salads and rice dishes. She also makes a hibiscus ginger sweet tea soda. Hall urged those who embrace the symbolism on Juneteenth to let each sip and every bite serve as a reminder of the resilience and sacrifices of those who fought for freedom, urging us to confront the injustices of the past. She also encouraged people to find ways to commemorate and honor the freedom and sacrifices of the enslaved throughout the year. \u201cA red drink is symbolic \u2026 but what are you doing the rest of the time?\u201d Hall said.\u00a0 Juneteenth, she said, is\u00a0a day not only to rejoice but to recommit ourselves to the ongoing work of justice, year-round.

The state Department of Homeland Security and Emergency Management told CNN they have received reports of one fatality, but had no additional information. Earlier Tuesday, New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham declared a\u00a0state of emergency\u00a0in Lincoln County and the Mescalero Apache Reservation. The wildfires have been tearing across the tribal reservation and converging on a village \u201clike a pair of tongs,\u201d prompting thousands of residents to evacuate, officials say, and a neighboring community came under threat later Tuesday. The governor\u2019s executive order authorizes additional funding and resources for the state\u2019s homeland security and emergency management department. At least two individuals were injured during the wildfires, Grisham said during a Tuesday evening news conference. They were treated for non-life threatening injuries. Grisham said at least 500 structures have already been damaged by the wildfires. Many communities near the fires in Lincoln County lost power and cell service yesterday, but the governor said most service has been restored. A wall of smoke filled the sky over the village of Ruidoso on Monday evening as a line of cars snaked out of the community. An estimated 5,000 residents were ordered to evacuate the village area due to the approaching South Fork Fire, New Mexico Forestry spokesperson George Ducker told CNN. The South Fork Fire started Monday morning on Mescalero Apache tribal land and had spread to at least 3,000 acres by nightfall, Ducker said. It exploded in size overnight, authorities said. The fire burned 13,921 acres with zero percent containment, the Village of Ruidoso\u00a0said\u00a0early Tuesday. \u201cCurrently (South Fork) fire behavior is creeping, but a concern today is increased winds that could push the fire further to the east and the northeast,\u201d the Ruidoso village government said on Facebook. A second blaze, the Salt Fire, is also burning on tribal land south of Ruidoso and had scorched 2,800 acres by early Tuesday. Both fires are acting like \u201ca pair of tongs, and Ruidoso is in the middle,\u201d Ducker said. Eric Moro and his family fled their home in Ruidoso on Monday. The evacuation was sudden and his family had little time to prepare. He described the sky as orange and said they could barely breathe due to the smoke. \u201cRight now, the fires are probably about 1,200 meters from our home - last I checked. So, we\u2019re pretty high risk of losing our home,\u201d Moro told CNN. He is unsure of what his family will do now. They had just moved into their home in March but may stay with relatives in Mexico. \u201cThere\u2019s no going back right now. They are trying to get everybody out and we are not expecting any rain until Friday,\u201d Moro said. As of Tuesday evening,\u00a0Ruidoso Downs \u2013\u00a0a city of\u00a0about 2,600 people\u00a0directly east of\u00a0the\u00a0village\u00a0of Ruidoso \u2013\u00a0also\u00a0was\u00a0under an evacuation order due to the Salt Fire, according to\u00a0a post on the city\u2019s Facebook page. \u201cIf you are in Ruidoso Downs, please evacuate immediately. Do not try to gather belongings or save your property,\u201d the post reads. CNN has\u00a0sought more information from city and Lincoln County officials. Evacuation orders are also in place in parts of the Mescalero Apache Indian Reservation, which sits just south of Ruidoso, including the areas of Snow Springs, Fence Canyon, Whitetail, Chihuahua Well, Fantasy Lane, the Summit area, and Botella Road, the tribe said. First responders are also grappling with phone outages affecting a communications center, potentially hindering the ability to respond to 911 calls, New Mexico State Police said. Much of the area has been in extreme drought for nearly a year and southeast New Mexico is the only part of the US considered to be in \u201cexceptional drought.\u201d The effects of extreme drought can include heightened fire danger, dying vegetation and the drying up of large rivers \u00adsuch as the Rio Grande. State Forester Laura McCarthy, with the New Mexico Forestry Division, expressed concern Tuesday over the change in weather conditions. \u201cThe wind is in the process of shifting. Since the fire started, it had been a steady southwest wind and now we\u2019re seeing a shift with the wind coming from the west,\u201d McCarthy said. \u201cThere is potential with this wind coming in from the west to have additional homes impacted.\u201d McCarthy said a cold front could bring more moisture to the area by Thursday. \u201cIt\u2019s both bad news and good news. It also means that this fire is going to be dynamic,\u201d she said. Multiple fires are also blazing across the West, including a 15,000-acre fire in Los Angeles County. Though Ruidoso is home to only about 8,000 permanent residents, the area attracts a flow of recreational tourists with winding trails, vast parks and wilderness. The village estimates about 60% of its houses are vacation homes. Rebecca Dennis, who was vacationing in Ruidoso with her family, could smell the smoke Monday morning and proactively packed the family\u2019s bags as the fire seemed to grow closer. When the village was ordered to evacuate, the family jumped in the car to drive back to their home in Oklahoma. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine the chaos had we not been prepared. I truly feel awful for those residents & everyone. But it was \u2026 horrible to see the fires all around us,\u201d Dennis wrote on Facebook. Few paths out of Ruidoso remained Monday evening after both Highway 48 and Highway 70 at Apache Summit were closed due to the South Fork Fire, the village advised on Facebook: \u201cThe only route for evacuation is on Sudderth to Highway 70 and out to Roswell.\u201d The city of Roswell \u2013 about 70 miles east of Ruidoso \u2013 raced to accommodate evacuees on Monday, including by clearing hospital space for patients who are being relocated from the Ruidoso hospital and setting up emergency shelters for people and livestock. A shelter is open at Eastern New Mexico University and evacuees with RVs or large animals can also park and board their animals at the Eastern New Mexico State Fairgrounds, the city of Roswell announced. Anthony Torres, the lead pastor at Mountain View Church, told CNN they can shelter 30 to 50 people in need. He said they have water, supplies, air conditioning and a shower trailer. Power has been shut off in portions of Ruidoso at the request of first responders, electricity utility PNM said. As of Monday night, nearly 800 homes and businesses were impacted, the utility said. \u201cPublic safety is a top priority and we do not take this decision lightly but are doing all we can to work in lockstep with our first responders who are helping the communities who are impacted,\u201d PNM said in a Facebook post. The wildfires\u2019 explosive growth has been fed by very dry air and high temperatures. The conditions prompted the Storm Prediction Center to issue an elevated fire risk warning across most of New Mexico, meaning the wind and low humidity could lead to increased fire threats. Fires blazing across the Western US There are 29 active large fires burning across the US, according to the National Interagency Fire Center, with 10 of those reported in California. The Post Fire in Los Angeles County has burned more than 15,000 acres and is about 24% contained, with more than 1,600 personnel assigned to fight the fire. Farther north in the state, the Sites Fire in Colusa County has grown to 10,000 acres and is zero percent contained and the Point Fire in Sonoma County has burned more than 1,200 acres and is about 20% contained.  The Aero Fire has\u00a0grown to\u00a05,249 acres in Calaveras County, with 20% containment and 3,690 structures threatened. The fires have forced evacuations in some surrounding areas. Cal Fire Capt. Marco Rodriguez said firefighters are facing winds of 50 to 60 mph. Rodriguez said the fire threat may get worse with expected weekend heat. \u201cWinds always cause challenges and concerns for firefighting. That\u2019s the biggest influencing factor on fire behavior,\u201d Cal Fire Capt. Robert Foxworthy told CNN on Monday. As humans continue to drive climate change with fossil fuel pollution, scientists warn that rapidly-spreading, destructive wildfires will become more frequent, in part due to hotter temperatures and pervasive drought conditions. So far this year, nearly 19,000 wildfires have burned almost 2,100,000 acres nationwide, according to the National Interagency Fire Center. That\u2019s well more than the 10-year annual average of acres burned to date \u2013 which is around 1,400,000. This is a developing story and will be updated.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/18/us/ruidoso-new-mexico-south-fork-fire-evacuations/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/19/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_18_business_employer-obligations-worker-safety-heat-waves", "text": "Summer is just starting in North America, and already an intense \u201cheat dome\u201d is forecast to affect more than half the US population this week. Some areas, including Montpelier, Vermont; Syracuse, New York; and Pittsburgh, haven\u2019t seen heat like this in about three decades. Along with stifling days comes the risk of developing dangerous heat-related conditions, such as dehydration, heat stress, heat exhaustion, heat stroke and other hazards. While you can take as many measures as you like to stay cool at home, what about when you go to work? What responsibilities does your employer have to prevent you from suffering a heat-related illness? And what can you do if you think those aren\u2019t being met? Under the federal law that created the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, employers always have a duty to keep your workplace free of known hazards. \u201cThis includes protecting workers from heat-related hazards,\u201d OSHA notes on its website. And it applies whether you work outdoors or indoors. While some states have specific laws governing occupational heat exposure, there is no heat-specific federal regulation mandating how employers must prevent heat illness in the workplace. But they are expected to \u201ctake reasonable action to prevent their employees from illness and death.\u201d Nor is there a specific threshold that defines \u201cextreme heat,\u201d although OSHA said it is working \u201ctowards enacting a federal heat standard that encompasses indoor and outdoor workers.\u201d The heat an employee\u2019s body experiences will depend on a lot of factors beyond the general temperature.\u00a0\u201cFor someone working outside without shade and working on cement \u2013 the heat index is going to be higher for them than [if the thermometer says] it\u2019s 85 degrees,\u201d said attorney Jason Krasno, a senior partner at Krasno, Krasno & Onwudinjo, who specializes in worker compensation cases. The same goes if someone is working in high humidity or in rooms where air circulation is poor and there is no air conditioning. Anyone required to wear a uniform that doesn\u2019t breathe may be at greater risk of overheating. And an employee\u2019s underlying chronic conditions such as asthma and heart disease may make them more vulnerable to heat risks. At minimum, your employer should take basic preventative measures All that said, both OSHA and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, which research the prevention of work-related illnesses and injury, provide recommendations for employers to follow as they seek to keep workers safe on hot days. They recommend companies: Have a heat illness prevention plan. It should outline procedures, supplies and equipment necessary to prevent workers from getting a heat-related illness, as well as an emergency action plan if a worker shows signs of distress. Make water easily accessible. \u201cEncourage workers to drink at least one cup every 20 minutes, even if they are not thirsty,\u201d according to OSHA recommendations. Allow regular rest breaks. These should be in the shade or a cool area. Give employees time to acclimate. OSHA recommends the so-called \u201c20% rule.\u201d \u201cOn the first day, don\u2019t allow employees to work more than 20% of a shift at full intensity in the heat. Increase their time by no more than 20% a day until they are used to working in the heat.\u201d In a worker\u2019s first few days, the agency notes, \u201cabsolutely all symptoms should be taken seriously\u201d and workers should be allowed to stop working and get an evaluation to see if they\u2019ve developed a heat-related illness. \u201cNew employees whose bodies have not had time to adjust to working in the heat are most vulnerable \u2014 nearly 3 out of 4 workers who die from heat-related causes die in their first week on the job,\u201d OSHA notes in its Extreme Heat Hazard Alert. Encourage employees to dress for the heat. That means wearing light-colored, loose fitting, breathable clothing. Monitor workers for signs and symptoms of heat illness. These include dizziness, fainting, nausea and muscle spasms. Also, do verbal checks frequently with workers who are wearing face coverings or wearing face equipment like a respirator. Managers should encourage employees to do the same for themselves and their coworkers. Should any signs appear, try to cool the worker down and \u201cwhen in doubt, call 911,\u201d OSHA recommends. Change work hours. Another OSHA-recommended accommodation employers may make when feasible is to alter employees\u2019 working hours so that they work primarily during the coolest parts of a day \u2014 such as very early morning or after the sun goes down, said attorney Alka Ramchandani-Raj, who is co-chair of\u00a0the occupational safety and health practice group at Littler, a law firm representing employers in employment law and labor practice issues. What you can do To find out more about your particular employer\u2019s obligations and commitment to providing a healthy workplace, first check the company\u2019s safety handbook to see what recommendations they build into their policies and what the best way is to alert managers about potentially unsafe working conditions, Ramchandani-Raj noted. Next, check to see which rules and recommendations your employer should be following in the state where you work. While more than 20 states are subject to federal OSHA requirements, which establish the most basic obligations of most US employers, your particular state may have its own OSHA-like agency that establishes more stringent rules. If you suspect your employer is not providing a healthy workplace, you can file a confidential complaint with OSHA either by calling 800-321-OSHA or filing online. \u201cYou have the right to speak up about hazards\u00a0without fear of retaliation,\u201d OSHA notes. The agency also noted that it \u201cis planning enhanced enforcement actions, with a strategic focus on geographic locations and industries where high heat impacts vulnerable worker populations.\u201d Translation: More inspection activity and greater enforcement. And, it added, \u201cOSHA will also be providing outreach and compliance assistance to ensure employers, including those not covered by the OSH Act, and worker organizations have the tools to protect workers from hazardous heat.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/18/business/employer-obligations-worker-safety-heat-waves/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/19/2024", "section": "us"}}
