Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez of New Jersey, who faces 16 charges including conspiracy to commit bribery and conspiracy to obstruct justice, has rejected calls to resign and, while he won\u2019t run in the state\u2019s primary for his seat, has left open the possibility for an independent run following his trial. The senator told CNN\u2019s Manu Raju on Capitol Hill last week, \u201cI am\u00a0looking forward to proving my innocence,\u201d when asked repeatedly whether he would resign in the face of a potential conviction. Prosecutors say Menendez and his wife, Nadine, helped several New Jersey businessmen \u2013 all of whom were charged in the conspiracy \u2013 obtain lucrative contracts with Egyptian and Qatari officials and attempted to pressure authorities to stop investigations into the businessmen and their associates. Jury selection in the trial continues Tuesday after more than 30 of 150 potential jurors were dismissed Monday following questioning by presiding judge Sidney Stein over scheduling conflicts or hardships they may have in sitting for a four-to-six-week trial. The defense teams, which include Menendez\u2019s co-defendants, New Jersey businessmen Wael Hana and Fred Daibes, recently hired a consulting firm to assist in the jury selection and other matters, a source familiar with the matter told CNN. When the potential jurors return Tuesday, they will face questions from Stein over their knowledge of the case to root out any bias that would distort their opinions of the case or evidence presented at trial. Stein, a Clinton appointee, has not yet ruled on proposed jury questionnaires. Defense attorneys have suggested asking the jury pool a myriad of questions, including whether they think someone from New Jersey is \u201cmore likely to break the law.\u201d Menendez is being tried with two of his co-defendants: Hana, an Egyptian American businessman, and Daibes, a New Jersey real estate developer. The senator\u2019s wife faces trial in July. Here\u2019s what to know: Foreign entanglements According to the indictment, Hana and Nadine Menendez \u2013 who were friends for years before she started dating the senator in 2018 \u2013 worked together to connect the senator with several Egyptian officials to help secure US military aid as well as an exclusive contract with Hana\u2019s company. The contract, prosecutors say, made Hana\u2019s company the only business able to certify US food exports to Egypt as compliant with halal standards. Menendez, who at the time held senior positions on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, a post with power over foreign military sales, met several times with Hana\u2019s contacts in the Egyptian military and helped steer US military sales and aid to the country, according to prosecutors. The indictment also alleges Menendez ghostwrote a letter on behalf of the Egyptian government attempting to persuade other senators to lift a hold on $300 million in aid. In addition to his alleged agreement to use his position to facilitate military sales and financing to Egypt, Menendez also passed along sensitive information to his wife about who was serving at the US Embassy in Cairo, prosecutors say. His wife, in turn, sent the information to Hana, who forwarded it to an Egyptian government official. The senator also allegedly pressured an official at the Department of Agriculture to protect the halal certification monopoly Hana had secured with Egypt for his company, through which his wife was allegedly being paid for Menendez\u2019s efforts. Menendez\u2019s entanglements with foreign governments extended to Qatari officials, prosecutors say. In exchange for gold bars, whose price Menendez searched online several times, and other items, Menendez helped his co-defendant Daibes secure a multimillion-dollar investment from Qatari officials in a real estate project, according to prosecutors. New Jersey investigations Using his power as senator, prosecutors say Menendez attempted to influence several cases in New Jersey involving his co-defendants, including by talking with a top prosecutor on one case and by working to recommend a candidate for the job of New Jersey\u2019s US attorney, who Menendez believed would help quash a case against Daibes. For Menendez\u2019s efforts in pressuring an official in one case, New Jersey businessman Jose Uribe and Hana bought Nadine a luxury car, prosecutors say. In May, Uribe pleaded guilty to seven counts related to the bribery scheme involving Menendez and his co-defendants and agreed to cooperate with federal prosecutors in the case, including by testifying at the trial. Ultimately, according to the indictment, Menendez\u2019s influence campaigns were unsuccessful. The New Jersey case against Daibes is ongoing. Alleged cover-up According to prosecutors, after search warrants were executed on the Menendezes\u2019 home \u2013 where gold bars and hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash were found \u2013 and elsewhere, the senator and his wife attempted to cover up the bribes by paying back the businessmen for the mortgage and luxury car, claiming they were merely loans. The indictment states that lawyers for the two told prosecutors \u2013 relying on statements from the married couple \u2013 that the bribe payments were actually loans. Menendez allegedly had his attorney at the time say he was originally unaware of the mortgage and car payments, which prosecutors say is false. The couple has been charged with obstructing justice. Menendez\u2019s defense Attorneys for Menendez have hinted at several possible defenses they may bring during trial, including that the 13 gold bars and $480,000 in cash investigators found in his home could be explained by intergenerational family trauma as well as a psychological disorder stemming in part from his father\u2019s suicide. Shortly after he was indicted on bribery charges last year, Menendez told reporters he had withdrawn thousands of dollars in cash over the course of 30 years, citing \u201cthe history of my family facing confiscation in Cuba.\u201d The family trauma and death of his father, defense attorneys say, led to a fear of scarcity through which Menendez developed \u201cseemingly unusual\u201d coping mechanisms. Menendez may also attempt to lay the blame for the alleged conspiracy on his wife, Nadine, whose trial was delayed due to a medical issue. \u201cSenator Menendez intends to present a defense arguing (in part) that he lacked the requisite knowledge of much of the conduct and statements of his wife, Nadine, and thus lacks scienter and did not agree to join any of the charged conspiracies,\u201d attorneys for Menendez wrote in a court filing.

{"id": "2024_05_13_economy_mortgage-company-risk-regulation-fsoc", "text": "US officials worry the next recession could be intensified by a cascading series of failures in the mortgage industry caused by crashing home prices, frozen financial markets and soaring delinquencies. The US Financial Stability Oversight Council, a SWAT team of financial regulators formed after the 2008 crisis, sounded the alarm on Friday about an increasingly influential corner of the industry that has largely escaped scrutiny: nonbank mortgage companies. Unlike traditional banks, nonbank mortgage companies are heavily exposed to swings in the mortgage market, depend on funding that can dry up during times of stress and don\u2019t have stable deposits to rely on as a safety net. And, unlike banks, these companies are lightly regulated at the national level. FSOC warned that these unique vulnerabilities risk a domino effect in a future crisis where multiple mortgage companies fail, borrowers are locked out of the mortgage market and the federal government is left holding the bag. \u201cPut simply, the vulnerabilities of nonbank mortgage companies can amplify shocks in the mortgage market and undermine financial stability,\u201d Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, who chairs FSOC, said in the report. Federal regulators are calling for states and Congress to take action to address the risks posed here, including creating an industry-funded backstop to ease turmoil caused when a mortgage company goes under. Despite the wonky term, nonbank mortgage companies have become vital players that make most home mortgages in the United States today. They include major brands such as Rocket Mortgage, PennyMac and Mr. Cooper. As of 2022, nonbank mortgage companies originated about two-thirds of US mortgages and owned the servicing rights on 54% of mortgage balances, according to FSOC. That\u2019s up significantly from 2008. In fact, nonbank mortgage servicers hold the servicing rights on nearly $6.3 trillion in unpaid balances on agency-backed mortgages \u2014 representing 70% of the total. Nonbank mortgage companies have \u201cvulnerabilities\u201d that could cause them to \u201camplify and transmit the effect of a shock to the mortgage market and broader financial system,\u201d FSOC said. For example, if home prices crash in a future crisis, mortgage companies could simultaneously lose money and face cash crunches that would make it hard for them to make required payments to investors on behalf of struggling borrowers, FSOC said. These challenges would be exacerbated by the relatively high amounts of debt these companies have. This pressure on nonbank mortgage companies would then hurt borrowers seeking mortgages and could force the federal government to assume the obligations, according to regulators. Plea for action Yellen and her colleagues on Friday called for state regulators to enhance requirements and standards on nonbank mortgage companies, including requiring them to map out how they could be safely wound down in a crisis. To address liquidity pressure during a time of stress, regulators called for Congress to consider legislation to provide new authorities to Ginnie Mae to expand an assistance backdrop program. Additionally, regulators said Congress should consider establishing a fund \u2014 financed by nonbank mortgage companies \u2014 to \u201cprovide liquidity to nonbank mortgage servicers that are in bankruptcy or have reached the point of failure.\u201d In response, the Mortgage Bankers Association, an industry trade group, said it supports FSOC\u2019s goals of a \u201csafe, stable and sustainable financial services marketplace\u201d but described some of the recommendations as \u201cunnecessary.\u201d \u201cYears of punitive regulatory capital treatment have already limited the willingness and ability of depository institutions to participate in the mortgage lending and servicing markets,\u201d Bob Broeksmit, president and CEO of the MBA, said in a statement on Friday. \u201cWhile we support national standards for capital and liquidity requirements, layering duplicative supervision requirements or supervisory entities onto a heavily regulated market will add significant cost and complexity.\u201d The ABA warned that managing these changes could reduce competition and raise borrowing costs. Scott Olsen, executive director of Community Home Lenders of America, another trade group, said the FSOC report does not indicate significant taxpayer risk and only limited risk to the financial system as a whole. \u201cGiven the current homeownership affordability challenges, CHLA hopes regulators do not overreact to this limited risk with regulations and fees that restrict mortgage access to credit,\u201d Olsen said in a statement. Even some regulators have concerns about the new FSOC plan. Brandon Milhorn, president and CEO of the Conference of State Bank Supervisors, cautioned in a statement on Friday that the recommendation to establish a new liquidity fund is \u201cpremature at best.\u201d \u201cBefore considering any such proposal, Congress should require substantially more research and analysis regarding the potentially dramatic, unintended consequences of this recommendation,\u201d Milhorn said. \u201cI am concerned that this recommendation could negatively impact the nonbank mortgage market, particularly for low- and moderate-income borrowers, communities of color, first-time homebuyers, and veterans.\u201d However, Patricia McCoy, a professor at Boston College Law School, cautioned that nonbank mortgage companies\u2019 reliance on short-term loans for financing \u201cmakes them vulnerable to collapse\u201d if borrowing rates spike or lending dries up. \u201cNonbank mortgage firms are thinly capitalized, which makes them vulnerable to failure if they lose financing or mortgage defaults spike,\u201d said McCoy, a former mortgage regulator. \u201cStarting in early 2007, we saw a tsunami of nonbank mortgage firms fail precisely for these reasons.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/13/economy/mortgage-company-risk-regulation-fsoc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "us"}}

Nassau County Supreme Court Judge Francis Ricigliano found on Friday Nassau County Executive Bruce Blakeman did not have the authority to issue such an order, according to court filings. \u201cIn doing so, this Court finds the County Executive acted beyond the scope of his authority as the Chief Executive Officer of Nassau County,\u201d the ruling said. Ricigliano ruled Blakeman could not act without corresponding action by the Nassau County Legislature. It includes representatives from each of the county\u2019s 19 districts. Civil rights groups lauded the court decision, saying it struck down a harmful policy. But the judge did not rule on whether the order violated state civil or human rights law, instead ruling on a technical issue about authority. CNN has reached out to Blakeman\u2019s office for comment but has not heard back. He told The New York Times on Saturday he would appeal. The executive told CNN affiliate News 12, \u201cLack of courage from a judge who didn\u2019t want to decide the case on its merits. Unfortunately girls and women are hurt by the court.\u201d The executive order banned transgender girls from playing on sports leagues or teams that advertised themselves as girls\u2019 or women\u2019s leagues or teams if they used county facilities, CNN previously reported. The executive order, which Blakeman said allowed transgender athletes to compete on Nassau County\u2019s all-boys or coed leagues, immediately brought backlash from groups supporting LGBTQ+ rights, as well as state officials. The New York Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit in March on behalf of the Long Island Roller Rebels, a women\u2019s flat track roller derby league from Nassau County, arguing the executive order violates New York\u2019s human rights law and civil rights law, according to a news release from the NYCLU. The state\u2019s human rights law was amended in 2019 to include gender identity and expression, including being transgender as a protected class, according to the New York State Division of Human Rights. The roller derby league, which is inclusive of transgender women, was prevented from accessing facilities within Nassau County due to the executive order, according to the NYCLU release. \u201cWe are gratified the court has struck down a harmful policy that belongs in the dustbin of history,\u201d said Gabriella Larios, staff attorney at the NYCLU, in a statement. \u201cThe ruling deals a serious blow to County Executive Blakeman\u2019s attempt to score cheap political points by peddling harmful stereotypes about transgender women and girls.\u201d\u00a0 The issue of finding balance between inclusion and fair play has remained a struggle over the past few years for regulatory bodies overseeing high-level sports, and the effects have impacted recreational sports at the local level. Blakeman earlier this year outlined why he issued the exec\ufeffutive order. \u201cIt\u2019s just science, and it\u2019s common sense and obvious that a biological male typically \u2026 is larger, faster and stronger than a female participant. So, we didn\u2019t feel the necessity to ban biological females from competing on male teams,\u201d he said. A 2017 report in the journal Sports Medicine which reviewed several related studies found \u201cno direct or consistent research\u201d on trans people having an athletic advantage over their cisgender peers, and critics say the bans add to the discrimination trans people face, CNN previously reported. New York Attorney General Letitia James referred to the decision as a \u201cmajor victory\u201d in a post Friday on X. In February, James denounced the executive order as \u201ctransphobic and deeply dangerous\u201d in a statement, CNN previously reported. James wrote on X, \u201cIn New York, it is illegal to discriminate against a person because of their gender identity or expression.\u201d CNN\u2019s Ashley R.

{"id": "2024_05_13_politics_justice-department-ai-sentences-election-crimes", "text": "Federal prosecutors will pursue tougher sentences in cases in which artificial intelligence is used to commit an election-related crime, including threatening violence against election workers and voter suppression, Deputy US Attorney General Lisa Monaco said Monday. The Justice Department policy change is an effort to keep pace with a chaotic information environment ahead of the\u00a02024 presidential election, as AI tools have made it much easier to mimic politicians\u2019 voices and likenesses to spread false information. The new policy applies to cases in which AI makes the election-related crime \u201cmore dangerous and more impactful,\u201d Monaco said. \u201cOur democratic process and the public servants who protect it have been under attack like never before as threats evolve and spread,\u201d Monaco told a meeting of the Justice Department\u2019s Election Threats Task Force on Monday afternoon. AI and other advances in technology are \u201cemboldening those threatening election workers and the integrity of our elections,\u201d she said. The emergence in recent years of AI-driven software programs that can produce deepfakes, or fake audio or video, has complicated the threat environment for election workers and the federal and state officials trying to protect them. US officials focused on election security are concerned that AI tools will exacerbate this already-fraught threat environment, pointing to an incident during the Democratic primary in New Hampshire in January as an example. An AI-made robocall imitating President Joe Biden targeted thousands of New Hampshire voters, urging them not to vote in the primary.\u00a0A New Orleans magician made the robocall at the behest of a political consultant working for Minnesota Rep. Dean Phillips, a long-shot Democratic challenger to Biden, the\u00a0magician told CNN. Federal officials have also been mapping out ways in which foreign powers might try something similar to the fake Biden robocall to try to influence voters. Senior officials from the Biden administration in December\u00a0drilled\u00a0for a hypothetical scenario in which Chinese operatives\u00a0created an AI-generated video showing a Senate candidate destroying ballots. The Justice Department is already under pressure from election officials to do more to investigate the flood of harassing phone calls and emails they have received in recent years. Many of those threats have been made without AI tools and by people who falsely believe there was widespread fraud in the 2020 election. An Ohio man was sentenced in March to over two years in prison for making death threats to an Arizona election official, whom he accused of committing fraud. The danger is persistent. Thirty-eight percent of more than 900 local election officials surveyed in February and March by the nonprofit Brennan Center for Justice reported experiencing threats, harassment or abuse. More than half of the election officials surveyed expressed concern for the safety of their colleagues and staff. \u201cElection offices across the country continue to deal with threats and harassment for doing their jobs, and in many places, this behavior has been nearly nonstop since mid-2020,\u201d Amy Cohen, the executive director of the National Association of State Election Directors, told CNN. \u201cThis should be unacceptable to all Americans.\u201d Election offices have in recent years been working more closely with state and local law enforcement on personal safety training and \u201cphysical security best practices to help staff stay safe,\u201d Cohen said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/13/politics/justice-department-ai-sentences-election-crimes/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "us"}}

The resulting smoke could last for the next two days \u2014 leading to poor air quality and reduced visibility in US states such as Minnesota. Here\u2019s what else you need to know to Get Up to Speed and on With Your Day. 1. Trump Trial Donald Trump\u2019s former lawyer is expected to take the stand today as a key witness in the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s case against the former president. Michael Cohen will testify about his role in negotiating the $130,000 hush money payment to adult film actress Stormy Daniels before the 2016 election, as well as how he was reimbursed through retainer payments in 2017. Those allegations are at the heart of the charges against Trump. With Cohen\u2019s testimony, however, comes all of the baggage that accompanies the former president\u2019s longtime fixer. Cohen himself was federally charged with campaign finance violations, tax crimes and lying to Congress in previous testimony. He\u2019s changed his story as he turned from loyal Trump defender to chief antagonist after pleading guilty to federal charges in 2018. 2. Gaza Top US officials offered stark warnings Sunday against an Israeli invasion of Rafah, predicting that a major ground offensive in the southern Gaza city would lead to widespread civilian casualties, spark a Hamas insurgency and create a power vacuum the terror group would later seek to fill. The alarm bells from Secretary of State Antony Blinken and White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan came after President Joe Biden delivered an ultimatum last week that an Israeli invasion of Rafah would cause him to pause certain weapons transfers. Blinken and Sullivan both said Biden made the determination because he didn\u2019t want American weapons used in what he estimated would be a bloody, ill-advised operation. At least 360,000 people have fled Rafah ahead of Israel\u2019s planned invasion, the UN says. 3. Ukraine The situation in the northern Kharkiv region of Ukraine has \u201csignificantly worsened,\u201d according to Ukraine\u2019s top general, after Russia claimed to have captured additional villages \u2014 expanding its surprise cross-border offensive. The precise goal of Russia\u2019s new push, which began late last week,\u00a0is unclear. It may be to create a buffer zone designed to reduce Ukrainian attacks on Russian territory, or possibly even a renewed assault on the city of Kharkiv, less than 20 miles to the south. According to information from the Defense Ministry in Moscow, Russia now claims control over nine Ukrainian border villages northeast of Kharkiv. 4. Severe weather Flash flooding could strike across the US South this week as yet another round of severe storms drench already saturated ground \u2014 including parts of Texas, where hundreds of people were rescued during torrential downpours last week. More than 13 million people are under flood watches today into Tuesday in an expanse stretching from Central Texas to the Florida Panhandle, including rain-weary areas just north of Houston. The South has been battered by several rounds of rain in recent days, including severe storms that moved through Texas and into Louisiana on Sunday, bringing some tennis ball-sized hail and prompting the National Weather Service to issue tornado watches and flash flood warnings. 5. Bob Menendez Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez of New Jersey faces his second, distinct bribery and corruption trial in seven years \u2014 with jury selection expected to start today. The trial involves gold bars, envelopes of cash, a Mercedes and more that, prosecutors say, Menendez received in exchange for granting favors for people from Egypt and Qatar and trying to influence a New Jersey prosecution. Menendez, the former chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, will be tried alongside two New Jersey businessmen who are co-defendants.

{"id": "2024_05_11_us_missing-korean-war-soldier-identified", "text": "Sub-zero temperatures. Frigid winds. Snow falling across a \u201ctundra-like\u201d plain. These were the conditions soldiers faced in the Battle of the Chosin Reservoir. For some 17 days in late 1950, they fought through blistering cold in the North Korean mountains. With limited logistics and no hope of reinforcement, 30,000 UN soldiers faced over 120,000 Chinese troops in a battle considered one of the most brutal of the Korean War. There among the Americans was 19-year-old Cpl. John Albert Spruell, a son and brother from Cortez, Colorado. His unit \u2013 Battery B, 57th Field Artillery Battalion, 7th Infantry Division \u2013 went into combat near\u00a0the village of Hagaru-ri at the reservoir\u2019s edge. The fighting and the cold killed hundreds. Many others \u2013 as after US military clashes across the world for centuries \u2013 were deemed unaccounted for. When the horrors at the Chosin Reservoir had waned, the teenage warrior from Colorado was not recorded among the fallen. But nor was there evidence Spruell been taken prisoner, the Army said. So, on December 6, 1950, the branch issued its finding: \u201cMissing In Action.\u201d Back home in Cortez, Spruell\u2019s family was left to wonder what had happened to their soldier. His mother, Pauline Sleeper, probably didn\u2019t want to admit what her relatives decades later would say she almost certainly knew even then: Her child was dead. Still, though, she and her family had nothing to bury. A lack of proof and a mother\u2019s faith Soon after the war, the opposing nations embarked on Operation Glory, a 1954 exchange of thousands of sets of remains of Korean War dead. Among those recovered was one reportedly found near where the 57th\u00a0Field Artillery had fought at the Chosin Reservoir. A \u201ctentative association\u201d was made between the set and Spruell, the US Defense Department\u2019s Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency said. But there was no definitive proof. So, like all the others, the set of remains was given a code \u2013 Unknown X-15754 \u2013 sent to Honolulu and buried at the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific, often called the Punchbowl because it lies in an extinct volcano, the agency said. Spruell\u2019s name also was recorded, it said, at the cemetery\u2019s Courts of the Missing, where the names of 8,210 Americans lost in the Korean War were listed when it was dedicated in 1966. In time, the lost corporal\u2019s family moved forward. His eldest brother had a family of his own, naming one of his sons after his sibling who never came home from Korea. But the brother rarely spoke of the young man last seen halfway around the world near the Chosin Reservoir, said another one of his children, Dennis Spruell. \u201cI didn\u2019t hardly know anything about my uncle,\u201d Dennis Spruell said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t talk about it.\u201d But Sleeper never gave up on the hope her son lost in the war would return, said Dennis\u2019 cousin, Donna Lee Bailey, who was born after John Spruell last was seen on the battlefield. \u201cHis mother,\u201d she told CNN, \u201calways said he would come home.\u201d A DNA specimen and a fated phone call The Army, all the while, had Spruell listed as missing. And in its ongoing effort to close such cases, it had reached out to Dennis Spruell, he told CNN, for a sample of his DNA, which thanks to developments in science had become key to unlocking all kinds of mysteries long gone cold. Meantime, the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency in the summer of 2018 proposed disinterring 652 Korean War Unknowns buried at the Punchbowl to try again to identify them and return them to their families. The agency since 1982 has identified over 450 Americans killed in the Korean War, along with the initial 2,000 whose remains were returned at the war\u2019s close, it said, as over 7,500 US soldiers from the conflict remain unaccounted for. Three years passed before the agency could unearth the remains designated X-15754 and send them\u00a0to a laboratory for analysis. Nearly 70 years after they were sent back from the Chosin Reservoir zone, scientists used dental, anthropological, chest radiographs/x-rays \u2013 and DNA \u2013 to test the Unknown X-15754\u00a0specimens. Then last August, the agency made a positive ID. More recently, it called Dennis Spruell with the news. The remains known for decades only as X-15754 were what the tentative link had suggested: those of his uncle, Cpl. John A. Spruell. And now, Bailey said, \u201che\u2019s coming home.\u201d While most of Spruell\u2019s closest relatives have passed away, his childhood friend, Charles Haley, is still alive. He recalls Spruell didn\u2019t enroll for their senior year in high school. \u201cEverybody said, \u2018Well, he joined the Army\u2019 and that was kind of the end of it because we never heard any more,\u201d said Haley, who later joined the Army as well and was stationed in Japan. He remembers being silly with his friend as a kid, often playing pranks. Haley has also always made sure there was a flag on the headstone honoring Spruell in Cortez cemetery, switching them out when one got tattered or disappeared. \u201cTo suddenly find out that they identified the body and that they\u2019re going to be able to have a service. I know his folks are both gone,\u201d he said. \u201cI think is a real great relief to know that they know what happened to him.\u201d The makings of a mother and child reunion \u201cWhat the Army has done is gone above and beyond anything I could have ever imagined to honor a (lost) soldier,\u201d Dennis Spruell told CNN. Spruell\u2019s remains soon will be buried in Cortez, Colorado, the MIA/POW agency and his family said. A rosette will be placed next to his name at the Courts of the Missing to show he has been accounted for. And he finally will get the military decorations he\u2019s due, including the Purple Heart, US Army Mortuary Affairs Officer James Bell told CNN. The confirmation of John Spruell\u2019s remains, of course, is also bittersweet: \u201cI am sad that (his) siblings, which were my aunts and uncles and dad, did not survive long enough to know his history,\u201d Bailey said. Though Sleeper has died, a relative has her ashes. And with her warrior son\u2019s remains finally headed back home, the stage is set for the reunion his mother always knew would come. \u201cThey\u2019re hoping,\u201d Bailey said, \u201cto be able to bury them together.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/11/us/missing-korean-war-soldier-identified/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_05_12_us_wildfire-smoke-from-british-columbia-causing-dangerous-air-quality", "text": "More than 100 blazes are burning across Canada Monday, with two major wildfires prompting evacuations for hundreds of residents and threatening to swallow up communities. In the province of Manitoba, in eastern Canada, a massive fire had charred more than 86,000 acres by Monday evening and was less than a mile away from the community of Cranberry Portage, local authorities said. More than 500 residents there had been evacuated, according to Manitoba officials. \u201cI\u2019ve been working in wildfires for 40 years, I\u2019ve never seen a fire move like this fire moved,\u201d Manitoba Wildfire Service Director Earl Simmons said in a Monday news conference. In Western Canada, the Parker Lake Fire in northeastern British Columbia more than tripled in size over the weekend to 13,000 acres and is now on the doorstep of the small community of Fort Nelson. The blaze was less than 1.5 miles west of the town Monday morning, and gusty winds are expected to linger in the coming days and could bring the flames even closer. \u201cThe next 48 hours will be a challenging situation,\u201d said Bowinn Ma, BC minister of emergency management and climate readiness. \u201cWe may begin to see volatile wildfire activity later this afternoon.\u201d As of Monday morning, roughly 4,700 people were under evacuation orders, including in the town of Fort Nelson and Fort Nelson First Nation, Ma said. People across 80 other properties were also asked to evacuate, the official added. \u201cIf you are still in Fort Nelson, or anywhere in the evacuation order of the Parker Lake wildfire, I encourage you to leave,\u201d Chapman said Sunday. \u201cThe fuels are as dry as we have ever seen. The wind is going to be sustained and it is going to push the fire toward the community. Escape routes may be compromised and visibility will be poor as the fire continues to grow.\u201d Jaylene MacIver, Northern Rockies regional municipality information officer, told CNN \u201cthere has generally been good compliance,\u201d though some residents chose to remain in place. More than 90% of the approximately 450 residents of Fort Nelson First Nation evacuated the area, the emergency operations director Terry Cavaliere told CNN. Warming climate helps fire conditions Extremely dry conditions and winds gusting up to 25 mph are driving the fire Monday, but the seeds of fire activity were sown over the winter and in past years as the world continues to warm because of human-driven climate change. \u201cThis region has experienced multiple years of drought, with a below normal snowpack this past winter,\u201d said Ben Boghean, fire behavior specialist for the BC Wildfire Service. \u201cAs a result of this, our forests in the Fort Nelson zone are very receptive\u00a0to new fire ignitions and rapid rates of spread.\u201d Declining snow, increasing temperatures and worsening droughts are all hallmarks of climate change and are projected to keep driving larger and more intense fires across Canada, according to Environment Canada. Last year was Canada\u2019s most devastating fire season on record, including in British Columbia, where fires burned through hundreds of homes and an area the size of Maryland, according to the BC Wildfire Service. The Parker Lake Fire is not alone. There are more than 100 fires burning across Canada, 39 of which are considered out of control, according to the Canadian Interagency Fire Centre. Some of the blazes are so-called \u201choldover fires\u201d also known colloquially as \u201czombie fires,\u201d the smoldering remains of last season\u2019s epic blazes, burning deep in the ground throughout the winter and reigniting when exposed to warmer temperatures in the spring. \u201cIn the past, the winter conditions are what put out a lot of holdover fires,\u201d Ma said. \u201cIn this case, what we\u2019ve seen is that due to higher temperatures and persistent drought through the last year, many of these holdover fires were not put out like they normally are.\u201d Two \u201czombie\u201d fires, the Patry Creek Fire and the Nogah Creek wildfire, are growing rapidly to the north and east of Fort Nelson and contributing to the evacuation orders. Evacuation alerts are also in place for parts of Alberta as the MWF-017 wildfire burns out of control near Fort McMurray in the northeastern area of the province, officials said. The fire had burned about 16,000 acres as of Sunday morning. Hazardous smoke creeps into the US Smoke from the infernos has caused Environment Canada\u00a0to issue a special air quality statement extending from British Columbia to Saskatchewan. It has also caused smoke to waft down into the northern tier of the US for the first time this year, and for air quality alerts to be issued for Wisconsin, Minnesota and Iowa. Air quality reached \u201cunhealthy\u201d levels in all three states Monday, including Minneapolis-St. Paul, according to AirNow.gov. On Monday afternoon, the Twin Cities had the eighth-worst air quality of 119 major cities tracked by IQAIR, a company tracking air quality worldwide. Particulate matter levels this high can cause issues for sensitive groups or anyone spending prolonged time outdoors, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. Wildfire smoke has been linked to increases in certain cancers and heart-related issues, among other ailments. Just last year, smoke from Canadian\u00a0wildfires made its way to parts of the United States and caused dangerous air conditions across the country. In 2023, 19 counties in 11 states had days with \u201cvery unhealthy\u201d and \u201chazardous\u201d air quality \u2014 given at least a \u201ccode purple\u201d alert on the US Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s Air Quality Index. Poor air quality conditions are expected to linger in the US through Monday, and likely longer in parts of Canada closer to the fires, including Alberta and British Columbia.  Canadian officials warned those at higher risk of experiencing health effects from\u00a0wildfire\u00a0smoke include people with lung disease such as asthma, people with heart disease, along with older adults, children, those who are pregnant and people who work outdoors. They also recommended those who spend time outdoors wear a mask to help reduce exposure to fine particles of smoke. Residents in Alberta prepare to evacuate Evacuation alerts are also in effect for parts of Alberta as\u00a0wildfire\u00a0MWF-017 burns about 10 miles southwest of Fort McMurray, according to a statement from the\u00a0Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo. The alerts were active in Fort McMurray, Saprae Creek Estates, Gregoire Lake Estates, Fort McMurray First Nation #468, Anzac and Rickards Landing Industrial Park. \u201cAlthough there is no immediate risk to these communities, the alert ensures residents are prepared to evacuate if conditions change,\u201d the statement said. Light rain showers were expected overnight Sunday with more rain forecast Monday, \u201cwhich will help lower fire activity,\u201d a Sunday update from Alberta Wildfire said. \u201cThis will give firefighters a good window to continue making progress on containing the fire,\u201d it said. \u201cTwo night vision helicopters will work overnight to drop water on the fire with their buckets,\u201d the update said. Crews made progress in establishing a fireguard on the northeast side of the fire Sunday, officials said. Fire restrictions will remain in effect in the area until conditions improve, according to\u00a0Alberta\u00a0Wildfire.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/12/us/wildfire-smoke-from-british-columbia-causing-dangerous-air-quality/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "us"}}

No one was injured during the incident in Abbeville at the St. Mary Magdalen Church, during which a \u201csuspicious person\u201d opened the back door of the building while Mass was underway, the church said in a statement. Parishioners immediately confronted the person, took him outside and called the police, the church said in a message to its community. Authorities, responding to a call about a suspicious person with a gun, arrived at the church and took the teen into custody, according to the Abbeville Police Department. After being questioned at the police station with a parent present, the suspect was taken to a hospital behavioral unit to be medically evaluated, police said. The teen has been charged with \u201cterrorizing\u201d and two counts of possession of a firearm by a juvenile, police said. The potentially dangerous encounter comes just a week after a man walked into Pennsylvania church service, pointed a gun at the pastor and pulled the trigger. The pastor was spared injury when the gun jammed, and the man was restrained until police arrived and placed him under arrest. In Louisiana, video of the church service streamed online shows associate pastor\u00a0Father Nicholas DuPr\u00e9 leading Mass when someone approached the altar and interrupted him mid-prayer to\u00a0whisper in his ear. Some parishioners in the front pews\u00a0appeared\u00a0concerned and turned around to look\u00a0toward the back of the church, the video shows. DuPr\u00e9\u00a0asked the congregation to sit and join him in repeating the Hail Mary prayer several times as a group of male parishioners moved along the center and front aisles of the church, frequently glancing toward the back of the room, the video shows. Once the suspect was apprehended, \u201claw enforcement entered the church to make sure there was no additional danger,\u201d the church\u2019s message said. \u201cThis understandably caused panic.\u201d The video shows parishioners began to get out of their seats, and the priest, still praying, could no longer be heard over the sound of the crowd. An armed law enforcement officer in a bulletproof vest entered the back of the sanctuary as the priest and deacon ducked behind the altar.\u00a0Altar\u00a0boys ran across the sanctuary one after the other. As panic began to take hold of the crowd, someone announced over a PA system, \u201cJust get a hold of your child.\u00a0Go slowly. We did apprehend a young man. He\u2019s in custody. \u2026 Calm down and just get next to your child and go slowly.\u201d \u201cWhile we realize this was a frightening experience for those in attendance, we are incredibly grateful to both parishioners and police officers for acting quickly to ensure the safety of all,\u201d the church statement said. The church said it will have uniformed officers at all upcoming Masses \u201cout of an abundance of cautious,\u201d the statement said. Abbeville Police Chief Mike Hardy extended thanks to the clergy and parishioners \u201cfor their quick response and remaining calm\u201d throughout the ordeal. The church said investigators are receiving assistance from the FBI. CNN has sought more information from police and the FBI. CNN also reached out to\u00a0St. Mary Magdalen\u00a0Church for more information. A\u00a0prayer was posted\u00a0on the church\u2019s Facebook page early Sunday morning. \u201cHoly Spirit, comforter of hearts, heal your people\u2019s wounds and transform brokenness into wholeness,\u201d\u00a0the\u00a0post\u00a0said. \u201cGrant us courage and wisdom, humility and grace, to act with justice.

{"id": "2024_05_12_us_general-william-sherman-civil-war-auction", "text": "At first,\u00a0it was the rare binding that caught the eye of Danielle Linn, a senior book specialist with Fleischer\u2019s Auctions. While cataloging items once owned by the Union Army General, William Tecumseh Sherman, she came across a copy of a memoir written by Ulysses S. Grant. The book had been made with rare \u201ctree calf\u201d binding \u2013 leather chemically treated to create the likeness of a tree on the cover. Linn set it aside, but later picked it up to check the publication date. The specialist opened the back cover accidentally, she said, and that\u2019s where she found Sherman\u2019s handwriting. Not only was it a first edition of the 1885 memoir, it was full of Sherman\u2019s personal notes and recollections. The Civil War general, who would go down in history for his \u201cMarch to the Sea,\u201d became close friends with the future President Grant during the war, writing,\u00a0\u201cFrom the day I reported to him from Paducah till his death our relations were as brothers rather than as commander and commanded.\u201d The historical find is significant because it contains Sherman\u2019s annotations, including a recollection of his first meeting with President Abraham Lincoln, in a book that\u2019s considered one of the finest memoirs by a president or general. Born in Lancaster, Ohio, Sherman played a key role in the Civil War. His\u00a0\u201chard war\u201d military strategy for the Union\u00a0included the destruction of infrastructure and some personal property through the South in his famous march. Sherman is also known for his Special Field Order 15, often referred to as \u201c40 acres and a mule\u201d \u2013 an initial attempt at reparations for newly freed slaves. But the auction, which will take place on Tuesday, isn\u2019t without controversy. One official at a museum dedicated to the Sherman family worries the items will land in private hands, and out of the view of the public. Nonetheless, the find has been personally satisfying to Linn, who, upon her discovery, shouted for the auction house\u2019s founder, Adam Fleischer. He, too, was surprised. \u201cThis is probably the most important offering of Civil War antiques that have been sold in recent memory,\u201d Fleischer said, noting the major general was \u201cone of the most significant figures of the Civil War in American history.\u201d Fleischer and Linn also found more notes, ranging from corrections to Sherman\u2019s own opinions on\u00a0events in other books. \u201cBeing able to open up these books and seeing that he had inscribed and signed his name on so many of them was a real moment of discovery,\u201d Linn told CNN. The collection belonging to Sherman\u2019s descendants, which has never been offered for sale before, was valuable even before Linn\u2019s accidental discovery. It includes the general\u2019s wartime sword, the rank insignia from his uniform during the war and his family Bible. Sherman\u2019s descendants said they are offering the relics \u201cwith great pride and anticipation.\u201d \u201cWe are confident they will be cherished and preserved by new custodians, who will continue to honor the remarkable contributions of General William Tecumseh Sherman for years to come,\u201d they said in a statement. Fleischer said he\u2019s already seen a great deal of enthusiasm from museums and institutions, and the auction house estimates the entire collection could sell for over $100,000 \u2013 or a great deal more. Online bidding has begun, and the sword alone has an estimate of between $40,000 and $60,000. The\u00a0Sherman House Museum in Lancaster, Ohio, is watching the auction closely. In a March 21 statement, the museum\u2019s director, Michael Johnson, said winning bids by private collectors might mean the items would no longer be available for public view. \u201cThe thought of these amazing pieces of history being stored away in a collector\u2019s basement is disheartening,\u201d the statement read. Johnson told CNN many people have said they\u2019re hoping the museum will get a hold of the items.\u00a0In an effort to do so, the museum began accepting pledges and over the past month, they\u2019ve raised around $90,000, Johnson said. \u201cAs the only museum in the country dedicated to the Sherman family, we would love to see as many of these as possible displayed in our museum,\u201d he said. If the museum isn\u2019t able to acquire the relics, Johnson said he hopes a private buyer would be willing to loan the items to the museum \u2013 especially Sherman\u2019s sword. After some criticism from private collectors, Johnson apologized for the initial statement, noting, \u201cWe have had amazing collectors in the museum presenting their items for our round tables and I greatly appreciate their efforts.\u201d Fleischer said the auction house \u201ccan\u2019t give any preference to private or public buyers, but we hope that everything will go in the hands of responsible custodians.\u201d Still flush from the historical find, Fleisher and Lin are expecting a large crowd for the auction. \u201cI don\u2019t know if there\u2019s anything quite so significant in my career,\u201d Linn said. \u201cIt was a real privilege to feel like a detective finding these clues and opening up and finding an American treasure.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/12/us/general-william-sherman-civil-war-auction/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "us"}}

Yang in Washington. \u201cSometimes they won\u2019t \u2013 and then you need to kick that f***ing door down,\u201d she added, to applause and laughter from the crowd. She added, \u201cExcuse my language,\u201d as the crowd continued to laugh and applaud. Harris\u2019 statement came as she marked Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month, reflecting on her experience as the country\u2019s first female, first Black and first Asian American vice president. Harris told Yang that people should never use others\u2019 preconceptions of what they\u2019re capable of to limit their own dreams and desires. \u201cDon\u2019t ever carry, as a personal burden, your capacity to do whatever you dream and aspire to do based on other people\u2019s limited ability to see who can do what,\u201d Harris said. Harris this year has become a key figure for President Joe Biden\u2019s administration and campaign, criss-crossing the country making points that might be more difficult for the president \u2013 an older white man \u2013 to make himself. Her efforts have included serving as the administration\u2019s point person on abortion rights, becoming the first sitting president or vice president to visit an abortion provider and traveling to states such as Florida and Arizona, where new court rulings and laws have thrown into doubt the future of abortion access. Harris on Monday also discussed the administrations efforts to protect the legal right to an abortion, making references to the 2022 Supreme Court decision that overturned Roe v. Wade. \u201cA decision has been made that takes from the American people a fundamental freedom to make decisions about one\u2019s own body,\u201d Harris told Yang. \u201cThink about what that\u2019s taking us back to, that one does not have the right to exercise authority over issues that I call heart and home, issues that are fundamental to what should be a right to decide to start a family or not.\u201d Harris also reflected on efforts to curb gun violence, expressing optimism that young voters, who have borne the brunt of gun violence in schools, will lead the charge in effecting change. \u201cWhen our young leaders start voting in their numbers on so many of these issues, I believe we are going to see a sea change in terms of how we address it, because our young leaders in particular are very practical and they want to see things done \u2013 and what I love about them is they\u2019re not gonna wait for us to figure it out, they\u2019re gonna do it,\u201d she said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/13/politics/kamala-harris-breaking-barriers/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "us"}}

{"id": "2024_05_11_us_northern-lights-how-to-watch", "text": "In case you missed the stunning nighttime spectacle of multicolored auroras dancing in the skies across the Northern Hemisphere, there is still a chance Sunday evening to catch a glimpse \u2013 but not for everyone. The auroras that have been visible starting Friday are a result of increased solar activity, including a series of solar flares and coronal mass projections from the sun, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\u2019s Space Weather Prediction Center. The dazzling curtains of green, red and purple lights were spotted from Maine to California and as far south as Alabama, Georgia and Florida on Friday and Saturday. However, people hoping for another sighting in the South and portions of the central United States may be out of luck. \u201cNo more vibrant aurora for Florida or any other \u2018unusual\u2019 places,\u201d said CNN meteorologist Allison Chinchar. \u201cToday is when we see the big shift back to the north for the lights,\u201d Chinchar said. \u201cSo all the usual places you would see the aurora, like Iceland, Canada, Scandinavian countries, etc. \u2026. that\u2019s where the focus will be going forward.\u201d In general, it\u2019s good to start looking during the time right after sunset. Weather, of course, is key, as cloud cover may limit the visibility of the aurora. Mostly clear conditions are expected in the northern portion of the US including Minneapolis and Fargo, North Dakota \u2013 some of the locations with the greatest chance of seeing the auroras on Sunday evening, according to Chinchar. But thicker cloud cover may inhibit viewing opportunities in a few spots in the Pacific Northwest and around the Great Lakes region. Green Bay, Wisconsin, is included in the area with the best viewing opportunities but those may be hampered by a chance of clouds and rain Sunday night, Chinchar said. New York City; Seattle, Washington; and Chicago are among locations where the auroras will possibly be visible on Sunday. The Space Weather Prediction Center, a division of the National Weather Service, observed conditions of an extreme geomagnetic storm at 6:54 p.m. ET on Friday evening, reaching a level 5 out of 5 severity. The last time a solar storm of this magnitude reached Earth was in October 2003, resulting in power outages in Sweden and damaged power transformers in South Africa, according to the center. Signs of a severe geomagnetic storm, or level 4, were first observed by scientists at the center at 12:37 p.m. ET, when a major disturbance was detected in Earth\u2019s magnetic field. Previously, the center issued a geomagnetic storm watch on Thursday evening, the first such watch issued since January 2005. But the forecast was upgraded after scientists observed G5, or extreme geomagnetic storm, conditions Friday evening. As the sun nears the peak of activity in its 11-year cycle, known as\u00a0solar maximum, later this year, researchers have observed increasingly intense solar flares erupting from the fiery orb. Increased solar activity causes auroras that dance around Earth\u2019s poles, known as the northern lights, or aurora borealis, and southern lights, or aurora australis. When the energized particles from coronal mass ejections reach Earth\u2019s magnetic field, they interact with gases in the atmosphere to create different colored light in the sky. The extreme geomagnetic storm will continue and persist through at least Sunday, according to the Space Weather Prediction Center. \u201cThe aurora will be more widespread and seen at lower latitudes\u201d during periods of stronger geomagnetic storm conditions, the center said Sunday. \u201cWe are less certain about how much of an Earth-directed impact we will have with the next pending (coronal mass ejection\u2019s) arrival as compared to our high level of certainty with the previous (coronal mass ejections) and extreme geomagnetic storms,\u201d said Shawn Dahl, a service coordinator with the Space Weather Prediction Center, on Sunday. \u201cTherefore, people wanting to see the aurora should keep checking our webpage and social media presence for news/updates of a new CME arrival,\u201d Dahl said in a statement to CNN. \u201cThe solar wind environment remains highly disturbed as passing CME influences continue, but gradually weaken,\u201d Dahl said. \u201cStill, it will not take much of any new CME arrival for geomagnetic storm levels to reach G3-G4 levels tonight.\u201d The storm\u00a0could affect the power grid\u00a0as well as satellite and high-frequency radio communications. The Biden administration\u00a0said it is monitoring the possibility of impacts. Bill Nye the Science Guy, an educator and engineer, said the massive solar storm could cause problems in a world that relies so much on electricity. Nye noted that a solar storm in 1859, known as the Carrington Event, lasted a week and severely affected telegraph communications, which at the time were state of the art. \u201cThe other thing, everybody, that is a real danger to our technological society, different from 1859, is how much we depend on electricity and our electronics and so on,\u201d Nye said. \u201cNone of\u00a0us really in the developed\u00a0world could go very long without electricity.\u201d There are systems in place to minimize the impact but \u201cstuff might go wrong,\u201d said Nye, noting not all transformers are equipped to withstand a massive solar event. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s just like the April 8th total solar eclipse. It really brings the fact that we live on a planet that\u2019s orbiting a star that\u2019s in a galaxy to our front door. It brings it down to earth,\u201d Dr. Hakeem Oluseyi, an astrophysicist, told CNN. \u201cIf you ask me, I\u2019d say a total solar eclipse is clearly number one. But next to a bright comet, aurorae are pretty amazing to see. And if you\u2019re near the northern extremes or the southern extremes, we cannot just get the colors in the sky, but the actual undulating curtains of nebulosity. That\u2019s pretty awesome. So the fact that that\u2019s going to extend to more people around the world, that\u2019s pretty cool.\u201d Nye added, \u201cLet\u2019s celebrate this.\u201d This story has been updated with additional information.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/11/us/northern-lights-how-to-watch/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "us"}}

The suspect, identified by the Euclid Police Department as 24-year-old Deshawn Anthony Vaughn, was found dead inside a residence in Shaker Heights, Ohio, US Marshals spokesperson Peter J. Elliott said during a Sunday evening news conference. Shaker Heights is about 9 miles south of the city of Euclid, where the officer was killed. \u201cThe manhunt is now over,\u201d Elliott said. The suspect, who was considered \u201chighly armed,\u201d had fled on foot to Shaker Heights after the ambush on Saturday, authorities said. Officials did not confirm the manner of Vaughn\u2019s death during Sunday\u2019s news conference. Euclid police officer Jacob Derbin, 23, was shot Saturday as officers responded to a disturbance call at a home shortly before 10 p.m. in Euclid \u2013 about 12 miles north of Cleveland \u2013 the Euclid Police Department said in a news release. \u201cThe complainant stated that her child\u2019s father threatened to harm her and her mother,\u201d Euclid Police Chief Scott Meyer said during Sunday\u2019s news conference. The woman told responding officers the suspect was on foot and possibly nearby, according to Meyer. \u201cOfficers went to check the backyard and were ambushed by gunfire from the suspect,\u201d Meyer said. Derbin was shot and taken to the hospital but died of his injuries, authorities said. No other officers were injured. \u201cHis kind heart and enormous smile were infectious,\u201d Meyer said of Derbin, speaking with emotion. \u201cThe world was a better place with him in it and he will be desperately missed by all who knew him.\u201d Derbin, who was engaged and set to be married in July, was sworn into the department in last July. His father is also a Euclid police officer, according to Meyer. Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine ordered flags to be flown at half-staff to honor Derbin\u2019s life and service on Sunday. The United States and State of Ohio flags will remain in that position until sunset on the day of Derbin\u2019s funeral, according to an announcement from DeWine. \u201cThe Euclid Police Department asks that you keep the fallen officer, his family, loved ones and our agency in your thoughts and prayers,\u201d police said in a statement.

{"id": "2024_05_13_investing_gamestop-roaring-kitty", "text": "The surprise social media return of the trader who helped ignite the meme stock frenzy in 2021 sent GameStop shares skyrocketing Monday. The surge had nothing to do with the troubled company\u2019s fundamentals \u2014 and everything to do with a cartoon of a gamer that the trader, nicknamed Roaring Kitty, shared on X. GameStop shares surged 74% on Monday after the account run by Keith Gill shared a meme on X, marking its first post in three years. The shares skyrocketed by more than 110% earlier and were halted for volatility several times on Monday morning. Short sellers have seen $1 billion in mark-to-market losses betting against GameStop on Monday, according to data company S3 Partners. Short-sellers aim to turn profits on a stock by borrowing shares, selling them and returning them after purchasing them at a lower price. Shares of AMC Entertainment, another meme stock, popped 78%. Reddit shares climbed roughly 9%. Shares of trading platform Robinhood Markets, which suspended purchases\u00a0of\u00a0GameStop,\u00a0AMC and other meme stocks during the frenzy in 2021, rose 4%. The image Gill posted depicts a man leaning forward in a chair with a video game console in hand. GameStop had posted the same cartoon in February, but with a blue arrow and chair. In Gill\u2019s cartoon, they are red. The meme is interpreted to convey, \u201cwhen things get serious,\u201d according to Know Your Meme. Gill did not immediately respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment. GameStop shares tripped multiple circuit breakers \u2014 a temporary and mandated halt in trading to let investors cool off for a bit. Robinhood denied claims on social media on Monday that it had once again halted GameStop stock purchases on its platform. \u201cThis is incorrect. Robinhood has not shut down the purchase of Gamestop shares,\u201d Robinhood spokesperson Anupriya Ghate said in a statement to CNN. \u201cGME is seeing elevated volatility and movement, which triggers market-wide exchange trading limits and halts. These are market-wide and not specific to Robinhood.\u201d Who is Roaring Kitty? Gill, who goes by \u201cDeepf\u2014-ingvalue\u201d on Reddit, was one of the leading forces on the WallStreetBets subreddit that drove eye-popping returns in GameStop\u2019s stock. The traders bid up shares of the retailer, targeting short sellers. The retail investors sent other stocks soaring in 2021, including AMC Entertainment and Bed Bath & Beyond. They are now collectively known as meme stocks, or shares of companies with a cult following that see wide swings based on their popularity among trader communities on social media rather than their fundamentals. Gill described himself as a casual daytime trader in testimony during a 2021 Congressional hearing on the GameStop mania. He has said he did not set out to help stoke the GameStop frenzy and instead believed that the stock was an attractive opportunity for investors. \u201cThe idea that I used social media to promote GameStop stock to unwitting investors is preposterous,\u201d Gill said in written testimony.\u00a0\u201cI was abundantly clear that my channel was for educational purposes only. \u2026 Whether other individual investors bought the stock was irrelevant to my thesis.\u201d Gill also said that he first purchased GameStop stock, and later call options, in the summer of 2019, when the stock was trading around $5 apiece. He added to his position through the rest of the year and 2020, and testified that he believed \u201cthe market remains oblivious to GameStop\u2019s unique opportunity.\u201d But even he didn\u2019t believe it would hit a high of $483 a share in 2021. \u201cAt the time I thought it was possible but a very low probability,\u201d Gill testified. Gill was a main character in the 2023 movie \u201cDumb Money\u201d (played by actor Paul Dano), which portrays the events leading up to and during the GameStop short squeeze.

{"id": "2024_05_13_tech_openai-altman-new-ai-model-gpt-4o", "text": "ChatGPT is about to become a lot more useful. OpenAI on Monday announced its latest artificial intelligence large language model that it says will make ChatGPT smarter and easier to use. The new model, called GPT-4o, is an update from the company\u2019s previous GPT-4 model, which launched just over a year ago. The model will be available to unpaid customers, meaning anyone will have access to OpenAI\u2019s most advanced technology through ChatGPT. Based on the company\u2019s Monday demonstration, GPT-4o will effectively turn ChatGPT into a digital personal assistant that can engage in real-time, spoken conversations. It will also be able to interact using text and \u201cvision,\u201d meaning it can view screenshots, photos, documents or charts uploaded by users and have a conversation about them. OpenAI Chief Technology Officer Mira Murati said the updated version of ChatGPT will now also have memory capabilities, meaning it can learn from previous conversations with users, and can do real-time translation. \u201cThis is the first time that we are really making a huge step forward when it comes to the ease of use,\u201d Murati said during the live demo from the company\u2019s San Francisco headquarters. \u201cThis interaction becomes much more natural and far, far easier.\u201d The new release comes as OpenAI seeks to stay ahead of the growing competition in the AI arms race. Rivals including Google and Meta have been working to build increasingly powerful large language models that power chatbots and can be used to bring AI technology to various other products. The OpenAI event came one day ahead of Google\u2019s annual I/O developer conference, at which it\u2019s expected to announce updates to its Gemini AI model. Like the new GPT-4o, Google\u2019s Gemini is also multimodal, meaning it can interpret and generate text, images and audio. OpenAI\u2019s update also comes ahead of expected AI announcements from Apple at its Worldwide Developers Conference next month, which could include new ways of incorporating AI into the next iPhone or iOS releases. Meanwhile, the latest GPT release could be a boon to Microsoft, which has invested billions of dollars into OpenAI to embed its AI technology into Microsoft\u2019s own products. OpenAI executives demonstrated a spoken conversation with ChatGPT to get real-time instructions for solving a math problem, to tell a bedtime story and to get coding advice. ChatGPT was able to speak in a natural, human-sounding voice, as well as a robot voice \u2014 and even sang part of one response. The tool was also able to look at an image of a chart and discuss it. They also showed the model detecting users\u2019 emotions; in one instance, it listened to an executive\u2019s breathing and encouraged him to calm down. \u201cYou\u2019re not a vacuum cleaner!\u201d the female voice of ChatGPT (which sounds remarkably similar to the Scarlett Johansson-voiced digital companion from the 2013 film \u201cHer\u201d) jokingly told the staff member. ChatGPT was also able to have a conversation in multiple languages by translating and responding automatically. The tool now supports more than 50 languages, according to OpenAI. \u201cThe new voice (and video) mode is the best computer interface I\u2019ve ever used,\u201d OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in a blog post following the announcement. \u201cIt feels like AI from the movies; and it\u2019s still a bit surprising to me that it\u2019s real. Getting to human-level response times and expressiveness turns out to be a big change.\u201d Murati said that OpenAI will launch a ChatGPT desktop app with the GPT-4o capabilities, giving users another platform to interact with the company\u2019s technology. GPT-4o will also be available to developers looking to build their own custom chatbots from OpenAI\u2019s GPT store, a feature that will now also be available to non-paying users. The updated technology and features are set to roll out to ChatGPT in the coming months. Free ChatGPT users will have a limited number of interactions with the new GPT-4o model before the tool automatically reverts to relying on the old GPT-3.5 model; paid users will have access to a greater number of messages with the latest model. OpenAI said more than 100 million people already are using ChatGPT. But an updated ChatGPT experience \u2014 and the ability to interact with it on desktop and through improved voice conversations \u2014 could give even more people reason to use its technology. The moves comes at a time when integrations of AI into more widely-used consumer products by Google and Meta, like Instagram and Google Assistant, may make those companies\u2019 technology more widely and easily accessible.

{"id": "2024_05_11_us_tara-louise-baker-georgia-murder-arrest", "text": "More than two decades after authorities discovered a University of Georgia law student\u2019s body at her apartment, where they say a fire was set intentionally, a man has been arrested and charged in connection with the cold case. Tara Louise Baker was found dead in her Athens, Georgia, home by Athens-Clarke County firefighters on January 19, 2001, a day before her 24th birthday, according to a news release from the Georgia Bureau of Investigation. On Thursday, state and county investigators said Edrick Lamont Faust, 48, was arrested and faced several charges in connection with Baker\u2019s death, including felony murder, aggravated assault, arson and aggravated sodomy, the news release says. Faust, a resident of Athens, remains in jail on a $15,000 bond, according to Clarke County Sheriff\u2019s Office jail records. CNN could not determine whether Faust has an attorney. \u201cBiological evidence and DNA science\u201d led to the arrest, Chris Hosey, director of the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, said at a press conference Monday. Hosey declined to comment on what led them to Faust, only saying, \u201cinvestigative work by the cold case unit\u201d and local investigators led to this update. No connection was discovered between the victim and suspect, he added. \u201cTara Louise Baker was a hardworking student with a bright future ahead of her,\u201d Hosey said in a statement Thursday. \u201cTara\u2019s life was stolen from her in a horrific act of violence.\u201d Baker, a first-year law student from East Point, Georgia, was last seen alive by a friend at the UGA Law School Library on January 18, 2001, around 7:30 p.m., according to GBI\u2019s unsolved homicide webpage on the case. Authorities say Baker, while still at the library, called the same friend around 9:46 p.m. to make sure they had arrived home safely. Baker told her friend she planned to leave the library around 10 p.m. The homicide investigation into Baker\u2019s death ran cold for 23 years. The victim\u2019s mother, Virginia Baker, speaking through tears, with a large photo of her deceased daughter just behind her, said she was \u201cso grateful\u201d for the arrest. \u201cI am Tara\u2019s mother. I always will be Tara\u2019s mother,\u201d she said Monday. She thanked everyone for their prayers and told other families whose loved ones have been killed to hold onto hope. The GBI\u2019s Cold Case Unit partnered with the Athens-Clarke County Police Department in September 2023 \u201cto conduct an in-depth review and analysis of the ongoing investigation into Baker\u2019s death,\u201d according to the news release. Athens-Clarke County police chief Jerry Saulters, who was an officer at the crime scene in January 2001, said in a statement that he\u2019d hoped for years Baker\u2019s family would find justice. \u201cI remember being there during that horrific time,\u201d Saulters said. \u201cSeeing this case now full circle, I appreciate the hard work of the detectives, from then and now. Knowing that the evidence collected at that time contributed to the arrest today gives me tremendous pride in all the officers who worked this case over the years.\u201d 2023 act named for Baker helps her case The Baker family says they have long waited for an arrest announcement, but \u201cit is not a day without grief and unanswered questions,\u201d they said in a statement provided by Athens true crime podcast host Cameron Jay Harrelson, who covered the student\u2019s story in a series on the Classic City Crime podcast. \u201cOur family is eternally grateful to the Cold Case Unit with the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, the Athens-Clarke County Police Department and Federal Bureau of Investigation for their dedication and diligence in bringing us closer to the truth that has eluded us for 23 years,\u201d the family\u2019s statement read. Harrelson, who connected with Baker\u2019s family four years ago through a mutual friend with Baker\u2019s sister, said the family has long advocated for progress in the cold case. \u201cA mother\u2019s heart never gives up, she never gave up on seeking the truth,\u201d Harrelson told CNN of Virginia Baker, Tara Louise Baker\u2019s mother. The late law student, who in May 2003 was posthumously awarded her law degree from UGA\u2019s School of Law, is remembered by family, friends, colleagues and classmates as a \u201cchampion of justice\u201d who was \u201cfiercely loyal,\u201d according to Harrelson, who said he interviewed hundreds of those who knew Baker for the podcast series. \u201cShe believed in the application of the law. She believed in fighting for people that were less fortunate or whose society might consider to be underdogs, or the left behind and forgotten,\u201d Harrelson said. \u201cI\u2019ve heard many stories of how she was never afraid to say what she felt, but always with kindness,\u201d he added. Georgia\u2019s Coleman-Baker Act, which established a new cold case unit within the GBI, according to CNN affiliate WRDW, was passed last year and named in honor of Baker and Rhonda Sue Coleman, an 18-year-old high school student who was killed in Jeff Davis County, Georgia, in 1990. The arrest of Faust in Baker\u2019s case makes it the first case solved by the GBI\u2019s new cold case unit, a GBI spokesperson told CNN on Saturday. Harrelson says he along with the Baker and Coleman families advocated for the law. \u201cWe did not have any knowledge that this bill would ever affect change for the Baker family themselves,\u201d Harrelson said. \u201cThe way we spoke about it often was that even if this doesn\u2019t help Tara\u2019s case, there are countless families out there that with a second look, (the bill) could help.\u201d He added: \u201cI could not have thought of a better way to honor Tara Baker\u2019s life and legacy, a legacy of fighting for justice and believing in the law, than for this bill to have not only been named after her but to have brought about justice for her.\u201d CNN\u2019s Devon M.

The high court is considering an emergency appeal over a map drawn by state lawmakers that includes a second majority-Black district in Louisiana\u2019s six-district congressional plan. A conservative-leaning lower court recently ruled against that map, finding that its creation violated the Constitution\u2019s equal protection clause. The second majority-Black district was drawn in response to another court ruling that found an earlier map, which had only one majority-Black district, likely ran afoul of the Voting Rights Act. A federal judge had concluded that the earlier map discriminated against Louisiana\u2019s Black voters, who make up nearly a third of the state\u2019s population but accounted for a majority of voters in just one of the state\u2019s six congressional districts.

It could also affect control of the US House, where Republicans hold a narrow majority.

{"id": "2024_05_12_us_crescent-beach-women-body-found", "text": "Nearly 40 years ago, human remains were found on a beach in St. Johns County, Florida. This week, authorities identified those remains as a woman who was last seen by her family in 1968. Mary Alice Pultz was 25 at the time. She had been raised in Rockville, Maryland, and had two children. She became estranged from her family then and left with the man who was her boyfriend, John Thomas Fugitt, according to a news release\u00a0from the St. Johns County Sheriff\u2019s Office. Fast-forward to 1985 when human remains were found by construction workers who were digging for a walkover on Crescent Beach. The manner of death was determined to be a homicide, the sheriff\u2019s office said. An initial investigation determined the remains belonged to a white female between the ages of 30 and 50. The case went cold over the years and the remains were left unidentified. A facial reconstruction created in 2011 gave officials a few leads, but ultimately left the case unresolved. That was until 2023 when a big break was discovered after the remains were sent to Othram, a lab in Texas specializing in forensic genetic genealogy. With the help of advanced technology at the lab, potential relatives of the victim were identified, the sheriff\u2019s office said. Sgt. Gene Tolbert traveled to meet with those relatives and after more DNA samples and testing, authorities were able to positively identify the remains. Officials identified Pultz as the victim in January 2024, but her homicide remains unsolved. Fugitt, who went by Tommy, also had an alias: Billy Joe Wallace. \u201cWe don\u2019t know if Tommy had anything to do with Mary Alice\u2019s appearance but he is certainly at the top of our list in terms of persons of interest,\u201d Tolbert said in a video posted to Facebook that the sheriff\u2019s office made about the case. In the course of the investigation, officials learned Fugitt died while on death row after he had been convicted and sentenced to death for the murder of his roommate in 1981. \u201cAlthough a significant amount of time has passed, detectives are hopeful that the information developed so far will result in a lead(s) that brings final closure to the family,\u201d the sheriff\u2019s office said. St. Johns County is located on the northeast coast of Florida. Police say they don\u2019t know if Pultz moved to Florida with her boyfriend. They don\u2019t have any addresses or records of jobs she might have held between 1968 when she left Maryland and 1985 when her remains were found. Her son, Norman Jenkins, was young when she left. \u201cI would just like to know if anyone ever saw her or knew her,\u201d Jenkins told police.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/12/us/crescent-beach-women-body-found/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "us"}}

{"id": "2024_05_12_us_civil-war-movie-democracy-blake-cec", "text": "A month after Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, the historian Yuval Noah Harari made a bold claim that seemed delusional. Harari made his claim in an essay on the heroism of the Ukrainian people. He praised embattled Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky, who refused to flee his country when death seemed certain, telling his would-be rescuers that he needed ammunition, not a ride. He marveled at the outnumbered Ukrainian soldiers on Snake Island who told a Russian warship to \u201cgo f**k yourself,\u201d and the civilians blocking Russian tanks with their bodies. \u201cNations are ultimately built on stories,\u201d said Harari, author of \u201cSapiens: A Brief History of Humankind.\u201d \u201cEach passing day adds more stories that Ukrainians will not only tell in the dark days ahead, but in the decades and generations to come \u2026 This is the stuff nations are built from. In the long run, these stories count for more than tanks.\u201d But there\u2019s another type of story that\u2019s gained traction in the US \u2014 the kind that can cause a nation to unravel. The new hit movie, \u201cCivil War,\u201d which has earned more than $100 million worldwide at the box office, is the latest example of a disturbing trend: We no longer seem to know how to tell well-crafted stories that counter those that depict American democracy as doomed. In \u201cCivil War,\u201d tanks trample democracy. The film depicts a near-future America that has been torn apart by seceding regions and militia violence. It features a fascist leader in the White House, an attempted coup and Americans casually killing one another in the streets. One critic called it writer-director Alex Garland\u2019s \u201cvery in-your-face attempt to imagine the unimaginable in America.\u201d It\u2019s hard to imagine any other future for the United States when you consider the popularity of movies like \u201cCivil War.\u201d Most of the stories about the state of America that gain traction in popular culture are the ones that end in its failure. They\u2019re the opposite of the hopeful, unifying stories any country needs to overcome tough times. \u201cCivil War\u201d is part of a growing entertainment genre that, to borrow a phrase from former President Donald Trump, could be called\u00a0\u201cAmerican carnage.\u201d Dystopian movies and TV shows like \u201cThe Walking Dead,\u201d \u201cThe Purge,\u201d \u201cThe Hunger Games,\u201d \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d and \u201cThe Last of Us\u201d all imagine a hellish future in America triggered by an environmental, political or civic collapse. There\u2019s nothing wrong with dystopian thrillers. They serve as cautionary tales and are as old as the book of Revelation. But the messages they send may be more dangerous than the violence depicted onscreen: The collapse of democracy is inevitable. Americans can never transcend their tribalism. Resistance is futile. There\u2019s something wrong when we churn out stories about superheroes in spandex banding together from different galaxies to save the universe, but we can\u2019t tell a popular story that shows Americans coming together to save our country. \u2018Casablanca\u2019 offers a lesson for today\u2019s Americans It didn\u2019t used to be this way. There was another time when democracy in America was under threat, and filmmakers responded by making stirring movies aimed at lifting Americans\u2019 spirit and equipping them for the battles ahead. Consider \u201cCasablanca,\u201d the classic 1942 film. It proves that you can tell a gripping story about patriotism without being sappy or boring. In the film, Humphrey Bogart plays Rick, the cynical owner of a Moroccan nightclub at the onset of World War II. The movie is remembered today for its classic lines (\u201cHere\u2019s looking at you kid\u201d; \u201cWe\u2019ll always have Paris\u201d; \u201cRound up the usual suspects\u201d). Yet there\u2019s another classic line uttered by Rick \u2014 \u201cI stick my neck out for nobody\u201d \u2014 that hints at deeper reasons why \u201cCasablanca\u201d was made. The film is set before Pearl Harbor, when many Americans didn\u2019t want to get involved in a European conflict. Adolf Hitler\u2019s Nazi war machine seemed unstoppable. Fascism was on a global march. Democracy\u2019s future seemed grim. Rick responds to the impending crisis with apathy and cynicism. But when his old flame, played by actress Ingrid Bergman, walks into his club one night, she not only rekindles their romance but his idealism. \u201cThe movie was a patriotic rallying cry that affirmed a sense of national purpose,\u201d wrote Cristo\u0301bal S. Berry-Caba\u0301n in an essay. \u201cThe film emphasized group effort and the value of individual sacrifices for a larger cause. It portrayed World War II as a peoples\u2019 war, typically featuring a diverse group of people and ethnic backgrounds who are thrown together, tested, and molded into a dedicated (force) fighting fascism.\u201d Other films of that era made similar storytelling choices. Legendary Hollywood director Frank Capra made a series of seven patriotic films during World War II called \u201cWhy We Fight\u201d that rallied Americans in the fight against fascism. The entertainer Frank Sinatra,\u00a0a paragon of mid-20th century American masculinity, starred in a short film called \u201cThe House We Live In.\u201d It would be labeled \u201cwoke\u201d today. In the film, Sinatra intervenes when he sees a group of youths chasing a Jewish boy. He tells them that \u201creligion makes no difference, except to a Nazi or someone who\u2019s stupid.\u201d The film was eventually selected by the Library of Congress as being \u201cculturally and historically\u201d significant. Sinatra would later record a song with the same title as the film, which he would perform throughout his career. It included lines like, \u201cThe faces that I see. All races and religions. That\u2019s America to me.\u201d Other World War II-era films like \u201cDon\u2019t be a Sucker,\u201d which emphasized racial and religious tolerance in America, emphasized the same message. It went viral after the 2017 neo-Nazi rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. Those black-and-white films may seem dated and idealistic in an America that has been through the Vietnam War, Watergate, 9/11 and January 6.\u00a0But a country needs a unifying story like a human being needs oxygen. \u201cStories are essential to holding a nation together,\u201d says Kermit Roosevelt III, a historian and author of \u201cThe Nation That Never Was: Reconstructing America\u2019s Story.\u201d \u201cYou have to have something that motivates people to make sacrifices for the nation. If you\u2019re going to fight a war, you have to have people who are willing to lay down their lives. But we more often call on people to make sacrifices for others, to bear burdens, promote justice and help out the less fortunate.\u201d That doesn\u2019t mean we return to the days of making clumsy propaganda films. But Roosevelt says we should keep in mind that most stories contain some elements of propaganda. \u201cWe have this idea that propaganda is bad or ideology is bad,\u201d Roosevelt says. \u201cBut I think that history and education are inherently ideological, and there\u2019s a perspective there and you\u2019re trying to impart lessons.\u201d What united Reagan and Obama Some of America\u2019s most gifted political leaders knew that lesson well. Two of the most consequential presidents in recent memory \u2014 Ronald Reagan and Barack Obama \u2014 were master storytellers. They told stories that made Americans believe in democracy, in one another and in their country\u2019s future. Reagan\u2019s skills were on display when he told a story about American vitality in his farewell speech that echoed Sinatra\u2019s \u201cThe House We Live In.\u201d He said the source of America\u2019s greatness was immigrants. \u201cWhile other countries cling to the stale past, here in America we breathe life into dreams,\u201d Reagan said. \u201cThanks to each wave of new arrivals to this land of opportunity, we\u2019re a nation forever young, forever bursting with energy and new ideas, and always on the cutting edge, always leading the world to the world to the next frontier. This quality is vital to our future as a nation.\u201d Former President Obama cited his personal story as a reason to believe in America, despite the country\u2019s history of not living up to its ideals. The son of a White mother from Kansas and a Black father from Kenya, Obama said his journey to national prominence was proof that the American dream was possible. \u201cI stand here knowing that my story is part of the larger American story, that I owe a debt to all of those who came before me, and that, in no other country on Earth is my story even possible,\u201d he during his speech at the\u00a0 2004 Democratic National Convention, which would eventually catapult him to the White House. It\u2019s easy to dismiss Reagan\u2019s and Obama\u2019s storytelling as the product of clever speechwriters. What candidate doesn\u2019t call America great, or vow that anything is possible in the land of the free and home of the brave? But the dominant American political figure of recent years does not typically tell such unifying stories about his country. Former President Trump coined the term \u201cAmerican carnage\u201d during his 2017 inaugural address. He routinely describes an America that more resembles the failed state depicted in the \u201cCivil War\u201d movie, with his declaration in January that \u201cWe are a nation in decline, we are a failing nation.\u201d Telling that kind of story hasn\u2019t appeared to hurt Trump any more than it hurt the makers of \u201cCivil War.\u201d And, truth be told, stories of American greatness can ring hollow to the descendants of enslaved Americans, the Japanese Americans interned during World War II and those dismayed today by politicians and judges who disregard democratic norms. How can we tell a story today that doesn\u2019t ignore the brutality of American history but still inspires hope for the future? There\u2019s another figure from the past who may help us. Making the \u2018emotional case for democracy\u2019 Walt Whitman, the 19th century writer dubbed \u201cthe poet of democracy,\u201d said that America was his greatest poem. Through poetry, Whitman did what so many seem incapable of today \u2014 he made a multiracial, multireligious democracy in America visceral and exciting, not a civics lesson. In \u201cSongs of Myself,\u201d Whitman vividly described America as \u201cthe Nation of many nations,\u201d and said of himself and his country,\u201d \u201cOf every hue and caste am I, of every rank and religion.\u201d Read Whitman today and one is struck by his expansive definition of what it means to be an American. No one is excluded \u2014 he treats the \u201cboatman and clam-diggers, the farmer, the deacon, the runaway slave, the prostitute and the president with equal reverence, \u201cFor every atom belonging to me as good belongs to you.\u201d The historian Ian Beacock said Whitman offers an answer for those who wonder how they can defend democracy against stories that predict its demise. He suggests they take Whitman\u2019s approach: \u201cState an emotional case for democracy that appeals as much to those who already possess power as to those yet without it.\u201d It starts with being honest about the appeal of other modes of government, like fascism, he says. \u201cIt\u2019s obvious that being free and equal is better than being dominated,\u201d Beacock wrote.\u201d But is it better than dominating? Exerting power over others is a seductive feeling, too, if a dark and dangerous one.\u201d Many democracies simply \u201cunravel\u201d because their citizens get complacent, Beacock says. Democracy is hard to sustain because of its constant demands for compromise. People often go shopping for alternatives that seem like less work, he says. Whitman told stories about democracy that engaged people\u2019s feelings, not just their intellect, Beacock says. \u201cThis is perhaps\u00a0Whitman\u2019s core contribution to democratic thought and practice: the reminder that democracy\u2019s defenders mustn\u2019t neglect political feelings (\u201cLogic and sermons never convince\u201d) and that self-government must appeal to the human heart if it is to last long.\u00a0\u201c We need a new way to tell the American story The Austrian philosopher Ivan Illich was once asked about the most revolutionary way to change a society. He said: \u201cNeither revolution nor reformation can ultimately change a society, rather you must tell a new powerful tale, one so persuasive that it sweeps away the old myths and becomes the preferred story, one so inclusive that it gathers all the bits of our past and our present into a coherent whole, one that even shines some light into our future so that we can take the next step\u2026\u201d How Americans in 2024 decide to tell their national story is up for debate. What shouldn\u2019t be up for discussion, though, is the need for such stories. Isn\u2019t it time we tell a new story of a future America where the White House isn\u2019t going up in flames and citizens aren\u2019t murdering one another? The box office success of \u201cCivil War\u201d ensures, though, that more \u201cAmerican carnage\u201d stories are likely headed our way. Though the film doesn\u2019t take any political sides, it amplifies the same message that autocrats in Russia and China are making through their propaganda: America is hopelessly divided and degenerate, and democracy is doomed. \u00a0 Maybe it\u2019s time to rediscover what Americans of another era knew. Those old black-and-white films about what makes America special may seem corny now. But they understood that you must defend democracy not only with tanks, but with stirring tales that reverberate for generations to come. If you believe democracy is under threat in America, find a \u201cnew powerful tale\u201d that inspires us to believe it has a future. But don\u2019t dispense platitudes or give us a civics lesson. Tell us a story.

{"id": "2024_05_12_us_baltimore-bridge-collapse-demolition-ship", "text": "The planned demolition to remove a portion of the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Maryland has been rescheduled to Monday afternoon due to inclement weather conditions, according to the United States Coast Guard. Crews were expected Sunday evening to use small explosives to break apart a massive chunk of the Baltimore bridge that collapsed on a cargo ship six weeks ago after the US Coast Guard previously pushed back the controlled demolition by an hour. The operation was originally to take place Saturday, but officials on Friday announced it would be postponed due to an adverse weather forecast. The explosion is now slated to take place at 5 p.m. ET on Monday, according to the Coast Guard. The planned demolition is aimed at helping officials remove debris and ultimately free the 213-million-pound Dali cargo ship, which veered off course March 26 and struck a pillar of the Francis Scott Key Bridge, causing it to fall into the water below. The collapse killed six construction workers and destroyed a key thoroughfare, threatening the economy at the Port of Baltimore. Sunday\u2019s weather in the Baltimore area \u2013 which included lightning strikes \u2013 is what led officials to hold off on the demolition. \u201cWe were all set to do the precision cuts \u2026 today,\u201d Nick Ameen with the US Coast Guard told reporters Sunday. \u201cThere\u2019s several factors, environmental factors among them, that have unfortunately pushed that event until tomorrow.\u201d Ameen called the process a \u201cdynamic\u201d one and said, \u201cWe will absolutely not sacrifice safety for speed.\u201d He added: \u201cWhenever there\u2019s a lightning strike in the area, that pushes the clock back, and so that clock just kept getting pushed back and pushed back.\u201d Officials last week recovered the sixth and final body, allowing them to proceed with the plan to free the Dali. If the operation succeeds this weekend, the ship could be refloated and returned to the Port of Baltimore as soon as this week, The Baltimore Sun\u00a0and CNN affiliate\u00a0WBAL\u00a0previously reported. \u201cThe safest and swiftest method to remove the bridge piece from on top of the M/V Dali is by precision cuts made with small charges,\u201d the Key Bridge Response Unified Command said in a news release last week. \u201cThis is an industry-standard tool in controlled demolition that will break the span into smaller pieces,\u201d it added, \u201cwhich will allow the work of refloating the vessel and removing it from the federal channel.\u201d According to an infographic from the US Army and the US Army Corps of Engineers, the process will \u201clook like multiple puffs of smoke and sound like fireworks.\u201d Nearby communities should receive a \u201ccellular notification\u201d beforehand, according to\u00a0Unified Command, which includes\u00a0state and federal authorities, the US Coast Guard and Army Corps of Engineers among them. The 21 members of the ship\u2019s crew \u2013 who have not left the ship since it struck the bridge in late March \u2013 will remain onboard during the operation, according to Darrel Wilson, a spokesperson for Synergy Marine Group, which manages the Dali. \u201cThey will have a safe place on the vessel where they can shelter during the controlled explosion,\u201d Wilson said, adding that the crew was \u201cholding up well\u201d despite the stress of recent weeks. \u201cEven though they are not sailing, they are still performing\u00a0their normal crew duties,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cThis is still a large, complicated piece of equipment and there is a lot they have to look after.\u201d While the Dali\u2019s management company has tried to support the crew on board, members of Baltimore\u2019s seafaring community remain concerned for their wellbeing given the length of time they\u2019ve been aboard the ship. Rev. Josh Messick, executive director of the Baltimore International Seafarers\u2019 Center, told CNN the crew is well taken care of but feels disconnected from the rest of the world. They have internet access, thanks to hotspots Messick\u2019s group helped deliver, but they do not have their cellphones, which were confiscated by authorities as part of the investigation. \u201cThey are a little anxious because of the phone situation. We are trying to get their cellphones back to them,\u201d Messick said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just a phone, they can\u2019t access their online banking, their finances, their contacts, they can\u2019t look at photos of their loved ones before they go to sleep at night. It\u2019s a lot more than just a phone.\u201d In the meantime, several investigations continue into the cause of the disaster and who is responsible. The House Committee on Transportation & Infrastructure\u00a0plans to hold a hearing Wednesday\u00a0on the catastrophe, with testimony expected from the chair of the National Transportation Safety Board and officials from the Coast Guard, Army Corps of Engineers and the US Department of Transportation.

{"id": "2024_05_09_us_shenandoah-county-confederate-school-names-reaj", "text": "School board members in Virginia\u2019s Shenandoah County voted early Friday to restore the names of two schools that previously honored Confederate leaders \u2013 nearly four years after a decision was made to change them. The 5-1 vote the school board decided to reinstate the names Stonewall Jackson High School and Ashby Lee Elementary School. The names honor Confederate Gens. Thomas \u201cStonewall\u201d Jackson, Robert E. Lee and Turner Ashby. The schools have been called Mountain View High School and Honey Run Elementary School since July 2021, according to\u00a0board documents.  Prior to the\u00a0vote, several board members criticized how the names were previously changed. Board member Thomas Streett, who voted in favor of restoring the names, described it as a \u201cknee-jerk reaction\u201d that had a lack of involvement from the community.\u00a0 Board member Gloria E. Carlineo told CNN on Friday that she hopes it was clear that their decision had nothing to do with\u00a0race. It was based on doing things the right way, she said, and shows that \u201cwrongful actions by governmental systems can and should be rectified\u201d to restore citizens\u2019 trust in authorities. \u201cThe same system of government, rules, and policies that rectified the evils of slavery and segregation through legal means, is the same system of government that we should rely on without cutting corners and ignoring the people,\u201d Carlineo said. But for Sarah Kohrs, a mother of two\u00a0students attending schools in the district, the decision is sending \u201ca terrible message\u201d to the world.  \u201cWe deplore the board\u2019s decision to regress and \u2018honor\u2019 Civil War figures that consciously betrayed the United States\u00a0and were proponents of slavery and segregation. This decision seems more about vengeance, control, and hatred than heritage or due process,\u201d said Kohrs, who is also part of local group opposed to the change called Claim the Names.  In the years since the 2020 killing of George Floyd, the names of Confederate leaders, Confederate monuments and symbols have been removed from numerous schools, universities, military facilities and even the Washington National Cathedral\u2019s windows. The district in Virginia could be the first school district in the country to reverse course, according to an analysis by Education Week. In the hours of public comment\u00a0that began\u00a0Thursday evening,\u00a0students, parents and county residents spoke on both sides of the issue. \u201cI ask that when you cast your vote, you remember that Stonewall Jackson and others fighting on the side of the Confederacy in this area were intent on protecting the land, the buildings and the lives of those under attack,\u201d said a woman urging the board to restore the Confederate names. \u201cPreservation is the focus of those wishing to restore the names.\u201d Gene Kilby, the last surviving son of James Wilson Kilby, a Virginia civil rights activist who helped desegregate schools in Virginia, criticized the move to keep the names. \u201cWhy are\u00a0we\u00a0here\u00a0tonight\u00a0to\u00a0go\u00a0back\u00a0to\u00a0a\u00a0time\u00a0in\u00a0history that\u00a0was\u00a0very\u00a0cruel, where\u00a0hatred\u00a0and\u00a0racism\u00a0continued\u00a0throughout\u00a0this\u00a0county\u00a0and\u00a0throughout\u00a0the\u00a0 United States?\u201d Kilby said. \u201cIs this the type of legacy that you want to put in Shenandoah County\u2019s public school buildings?\u201d Changes could be a six-figure expense Nearly four years ago, the Shenandoah County School Board moved to rename the schools\u00a0as part of a resolution condemning racism and affirming the district\u2019s \u201ccommitment to an inclusive school environment,\u201d \u00a0according to\u00a0school board documents. But the composition of the school board is different now than it was during the 2020 decision \u2013 all six seats are held by different people. The current board took the first steps to restore the Confederate-tied names last month\u00a0after a group of residents\u00a0named\u00a0The Coalition for Better Schools\u00a0asked\u00a0them\u00a0to consider restoring the original school names.\u00a0Since then,\u00a0members discussed the issue in a work session, heard public comments and scheduled this week\u2019s vote. In an\u00a0April 22 work session meeting, the six board members criticized how the names were changed in 2020, saying it was wrongly done, was rushed and lacked public input. Board member Carlineo said in the work session that it also \u201ceroded\u201d confidence in the school board. Carlineo told CNN her vote\u00a0would be based on how the names were changed in 2020. \u00a0A decision that, she said, took place within days and with Covid-19 restrictions that limited the community\u2019s input. \u201cSo, for me, the main consideration is whether we, as a democratic nation of laws, will choose to ignore a decision made by a governmental body that exploited the tragedy of COVID or will rectify a wrongful action that has deeply divided our community.\u00a0I choose the latter,\u201d Carlineo told CNN before Thursday\u2019s meeting. CNN reached out to the other five board members for comment ahead of Thursday\u2019s meeting. Jessica Sager, a spokeswoman for Shenandoah County Public Schools, had said the district has not yet obtained quotes on the estimated cost of a\u00a0name change. In 2021, the district estimated it would spend more than $304,000 in costs related to\u00a0changing the two school names and a middle school mascot,\u00a0according to district documents. Those costs\u00a0were related to\u00a0uniforms and equipment for athletic teams,\u00a0resurfacing of a gym floor, signage in buildings and scoreboards, among other items, former Shenandoah County Public Schools Superintendent Mark Johnston told board members during a meeting last year. The motion approved Thursday says private donations would be used for the restoration of the school names and not by \u201cthe school system or government tax funds, though the SCPS will oversee disbursements relating to restoration costs,\u201d according to the meeting\u2019s agenda. Some residents refuse to move on, parent says Parents and residents expressed their opposition and support to restoring the school names. In an April 3 letter to the school board, the Coalition for Better Schools said it\u00a0believed \u201cthat revisiting this decision is essential to honor our community\u2019s heritage and respect the wishes of the majority.\u201d The group told CNN before the vote took place that it \u201chas full confidence in our current school board to listen to the voice of its constituents and follow the wishes of the majority in the county. Unfortunately, the previous school board did not take those things into consideration. We believe that \u2018We the People\u2019 is an important part of our Constitution and should be upheld at every level of our government.\u201d Sarah Kohrs, the mother of two\u00a0students attending schools in the district, is among several parents and residents who\u00a0said ahead of the vote that they were opposed to restoring the Confederacy-tied names and were frustrated\u00a0it was being considered. \u201cIt\u2019s very frustrating to know that here we are four years after that, and we still have a small portion of the community that just refuses to move on,\u201d Kohrs told CNN. She said attention should be focused on what students want and need to succeed, like repairing leaking roofs, a sound system for track meets, or having enough varsity letters with the current school names. \u201cWe still don\u2019t even have all of\u00a0our athletic equipment from the name change in 2020. We\u2019re still utilizing old hurdles, sometimes that have the name of Stonewall on them,\u201d Kohrs told CNN. Shenandoah County Public Schools serves more than 5,600 students, and about 75% are White, 18% Hispanic and 3% Black, data from the state\u2019s department education shows.

{"id": "2024_05_13_us_baltimore-bridge-collapse-demolition-monday", "text": "The trapped cargo ship Dali will \u201chopefully\u201d be refloated this week after authorities set off charges at a key portion of the collapsed Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore on Monday evening, an official said. The charges helped demolish a portion of the bridge wreckage that was resting on the ship \u2013 a move meant to help free the vessel, nearly seven weeks after it struck the bridge and caused the span to collapse. During the planned detonation, a chunk of the collapsed structure appeared to fall away from the ship and into the water, though a portion of wreckage remained on top of the ship, video showed. Officials are \u201cvery pleased\u201d with the demolition but will be conducting surveys with divers to make sure nothing fell and damaged the hull of the cargo vessel, US Army Corps of Engineers Col. Estee Pinchasin told reporters. Additionally, before the ship can be refloated, officials must verify that all the charges went off, Pinchasin said. A loud explosion rung out and dark plumes of smoke surrounded the wreckage after the charges were set off. A \u201ctremendous amount of steel\u201d was removed from the Dali, Pinchasin said. Authorities would now examine how the remaining debris sat on the bow of the ship, the colonel said. While teams are prepared to move the remaining wreckage, Pinchasin doesn\u2019t believe more explosives will be used, she said. The targeted explosion took place just after 5 p.m. ET after inclement weather, including lightning, had forced the operation to be postponed over the weekend. The demolition, which included using small explosives to break apart a massive chunk of the\u00a0Baltimore bridge\u00a0that collapsed on a cargo ship nearly seven weeks ago, was originally set for Saturday, but bad weather forced officials to push the operation to Sunday before it was eventually rescheduled for Monday, the Coast Guard said. After necessary assessments and surveys, the plan is to remove ballast to make the ship buoyant on its own and then use four tugboats to pull it out into the channel and escort it to the pier, US Coast Guard Capt. David O\u2019Connell said. Additional wreckage and containers will be removed from the Dali at the pier and the ship will undergo necessary, temporary repairs before more permanent ones can be made. \u201cHopefully we\u2019re going to refloat the Dali in the next few days. We still anticipate to be on time to open full channel by the end of the month,\u201d O\u2019Connell said. The 213-million-pound Dali cargo ship, veered off course March 26 and struck a pillar of the Francis Scott Key Bridge, causing the bridge to fall into the Patapsco River below. The collapse killed\u00a0six construction workers\u00a0and destroyed a key thoroughfare, threatening the economy at the Port of Baltimore. It also sparked multiple investigations into what went wrong and who is responsible. Monday\u2019s planned demolition comes days ahead of a Wednesday hearing scheduled by the\u00a0House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, with\u00a0testimony expected\u00a0from the chair of the National Transportation Safety Board and officials from the Coast Guard, Army Corps of Engineers and the US Department of Transportation. \u201cWe will absolutely not sacrifice safety for speed,\u201d the Coast Guard\u2019s Nick Ameen said Sunday of the weather delay. \u201cWhenever there\u2019s a lightning strike in the area, that pushes the clock back, and so that clock just kept getting pushed back and pushed back.\u201d Officials began moving forward with the demolition process after the body of the sixth victim was recovered from the water last week. The 21 members of the ship\u2019s crew \u2013 who have not left the ship in the almost seven weeks since it struck the bridge \u2013 remained onboard during the operation, according to Darrel Wilson, a spokesperson for Synergy Marine Group, which manages the Dali. The crew members \u201care all safe and standing by to continue assisting the response,\u201d Wilson said. \u2018Safest and swiftest method to remove the bridge piece\u2019 \u201cThe safest and swiftest method to remove the bridge piece from on top of the M/V Dali is by precision cuts made with small charges,\u201d the Key Bridge Response Unified Command said in\u00a0a news release last week. \u201cThis is an industry-standard tool in controlled demolition that will break the span into smaller pieces,\u201d it added, \u201cwhich will allow the work of refloating the vessel and removing it from the federal channel.\u201d The US Army and the US Army Corps of Engineers had said the demolition process would \u201clook like multiple puffs of smoke and sound like fireworks,\u201d in an infographic. Nearby communities were to receive a \u201ccellular notification\u201d beforehand, according to\u00a0Unified Command, which includes\u00a0state and federal authorities, the US Coast Guard and Army Corps of Engineers among them. Ship\u2019s crew have not left since collision While engineers tackle the logistics of clearing a tangled mess of metal to free the Dali, members of Baltimore\u2019s seafaring community remain concerned for the crew\u2019s well-being given the length of time they\u2019ve been aboard the ship. \u201cThey will have a safe place on the vessel where they can shelter during the controlled explosion,\u201d Wilson, with Synergy Marine Group, said, adding the crew was \u201cholding up well\u201d despite the stress of recent weeks. \u201cEven though they are not sailing, they are still performing\u00a0their normal crew duties,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cThis is still a large, complicated piece of equipment and there is a lot they have to look after.\u201d The Singapore Maritime Officers\u2019 Union and the Singapore Organization of Seamen issued a joint statement over the weekend saying they are concerned about \u201cthe potential criminalization\u201d of seafarers aboard the ship as the investigation unfolds. The crew is well taken care of but feels disconnected from the rest of the world, Rev. Josh Messick, executive director of the Baltimore International Seafarers\u2019 Center, told CNN. They have internet access, thanks to hotspots Messick\u2019s group helped deliver, but they do not have their cell phones. The FBI had confiscated the crew\u2019s cell phones as part of the investigation, Messick said. That has kept the crew members disconnected from their families and unable to access critical resources, the unions say. \u201cThey are a little anxious because of the phone situation. We are trying to get their cell phones back to them,\u201d Messick said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just a phone, they can\u2019t access their online banking, their finances, their contacts, they can\u2019t look at photos of their loved ones before they go to sleep at night. It\u2019s a lot more than just a phone.\u201d According to the unions, their representatives were aboard the Dali in April to ensure the crew\u2019s well-being. They are requesting the crew\u2019s visas be extended or renewed to allow for shore leave. The unions are also requesting expedited repatriation for crew members not required for further investigation and the return of their electronics. \u201cHowever long the investigation takes, the crew\u2019s rights and welfare should not be infringed upon during its course,\u201d said Dave Heindel, president of the Seafarers International Union.

{"id": "2024_05_12_us_win-rozario-nypd-killing", "text": "\u201cPlease don\u2019t shoot,\u201d Notan Eva Costa, a 48-year-old Bangladeshi immigrant living in Queens, begged the two New York City police officers who entered her home after her teenage son called 911. Lying on the floor, the mother of two stretched her hand out to the officers, terror and distress audible in her voice. It was too late. One of the police officers fired his gun at least four times, fatally wounding 19-year-old Win Rozario. Less than two minutes had passed since police entered the family\u2019s home. The officers \u201ckilled my son in minutes,\u201d Costa said through an interpreter at a Wednesday news conference. \u201cBefore they came, everything was calm. Then they came and created chaos and murdered him in front of me.\u201d In the weeks since Rozario\u2019s death, the shooting has attracted scrutiny from social justice and mental health advocates, particularly after the state attorney general\u2019s office released footage from body cameras worn by the two responding officers and announced it is investigating the case. Critics say the police\u2019s use of lethal force was unnecessary and reflects a pattern of violence against people with mental illness. In a news release, the NYPD said it is \u201cfully cooperating\u201d with the investigation as well as conducting its own probe, adding, \u201cWe continually seek to improve how we respond to requests for assistance, and we acknowledge that there is much work to be done. New Yorkers expect and deserve nothing less.\u201d The two officers are on \u201cmodified assignment,\u201d meaning they\u2019re still working but not carrying firearms or shields. Rozario\u2019s family, as well as local organizations like the Justice Committee and Desis Rising Up and Moving, have called for the officers to be fired and prosecuted. They also have goals far beyond penalizing the officers who killed Rozario. They\u2019re calling for New York City to radically shift its approach to responding to people in crisis. Rather than sending armed police officers to respond to every 911 call, they envision a world where trained mental health responders could respond to people experiencing crises, helping to deescalate tense situations and connect patients with health care. Mental health crisis intervention programs have already been implemented in cities like Eugene, Oregon, and Denver, Colorado, as well as across 23 counties in South Dakota and elsewhere across the country. In New York, a similar but limited pilot program called \u201cB-Heard\u201d dispatches EMTs and trained mental health responders to some emergency calls. Speaking through a translator in front of dozens of supporters holding images of Rozario, his mother described her son as a \u201cquiet and polite\u201d teenager who dreamed of one day joining the military \u201cbecause he wanted to do something for this country.\u201d He loved to cook for his mother and help her with her beading handicrafts, she recalled. \u201cThat is who the police stole from us,\u201d she said, tearing up at times as she described her son. \u201cI tried to protect my son. I begged the police not to shoot, but the police still killed him.\u201d \u201cWin Rozario would be alive today if the NYPD had already been removed from mental health,\u201d said Loyda Col\u00f3n, executive director of the Justice Committee, at a Wednesday news conference. 2 minutes, 4 gunshots, and a young life cut short Rozario was in the throes of an apparent mental health crisis when he called 911 on March 27. \u201cHe\u2019s having an episode,\u201d his younger brother, Utsho, told the two police officers who arrived. \u201cHe don\u2019t even know what he\u2019s doing, to be honest.\u201d In the apartment, the officers found Rozario standing in the kitchen with his mother nearby. When an officer moved toward the kitchen, Rozario seemed to become distressed and picked up a pair of kitchen scissors, which his mother tried to take from his hand. Rozario moved toward the officers again with the scissors, prompting one officer to fire a taser at him and the other to draw his gun. Rozario\u2019s mother clutched him as an officer shouted, \u201clet go of him and back up,\u201d and appeared to fire a taser again at the teenager, who collapsed to the floor. Rozario\u2019s mother then moved away from him and toward officers, holding the scissors. She walked back to Rozario, seemingly trying to comfort him, prompting an officer to yell, \u201cTell her to get the f**k out of the way!\u201d  \u201cDon\u2019t shoot,\u201d she said to the officers. An officer again fired a taser at Rozario, who grabbed the scissors and again moved toward the officers. Utsho moved in and all three family members held each other as the officers continued to shout for them to get out of the way. Rozario\u2019s mother and brother both fell to the floor. Rozario was standing and holding the scissors, seemingly several feet away from the officers, when one officer appeared to begin shooting at him. He fell to the floor after multiple shots. Col\u00f3n said the footage shows the responding officers \u201crecklessly escalated the situation multiple times,\u201d endangering Rozario\u2019s mother and brother as well. \u201cThey had multiple opportunities to de-escalate, to detain, and they did not do that,\u201d Col\u00f3n said. Officers shouted \u201cput it down\u201d multiple times at Rozario but did not otherwise talk to him during the body camera footage. \u201cThere was no danger happening at all, until those officers arrived with their guns,\u201d the family\u2019s attorney said at the news conference. Michael Alcazar, a retired NYPD detective and adjunct professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, told CNN he saw multiple ways the officers could have possibly avoided shooting Rozario. Before entering the home or when Rozario\u2019s mother took the scissors from him, they could have asked his mother and brother to leave the apartment, leaving just Rozario inside, and then called emergency services. This is consistent with the \u201cisolate and contain\u201d protocol NYPD advises officers to use when dealing with \u201cmentally ill or emotionally disturbed persons.\u201d Additionally, the officers could have used nonlethal weapons, like nightsticks, to gain control of Rozario and take the scissors away, according to Alcazar. Another vision for crisis intervention Rozario wasn\u2019t the first New Yorker to die at the hands of police while experiencing a mental health crisis. Community Access, a non-profit supporting people with mental health concerns in New York, says at least 26 New Yorkers experiencing mental health crises have been shot and killed by police since 2007. Situations involving \u201cemotionally disturbed persons\u201d are the second most common situation in which police officers use force, according to the NYPD\u2019s 2022 use of force report. Officers used force in 1,740 encounters with emotionally disturbed persons in 2022, the report showed. The report does not include data on lethal force used against emotionally disturbed persons. The NYPD told CNN they respond to approximately 155,000 \u201cemergency calls involving people in the throes of an emotional or mental health crisis\u201d each year. Fewer than 1% of those calls result in police using any form of force and fewer involve deadly force, the NYPD reports. Although they are uncommon, deaths like those of Rozario, Kawaski Trawick, Deborah Danner, and Mohamed Bah have drawn scrutiny to the dangers of using police to respond to people experiencing acute crisis, and what an alternative system of support might look like. In Eugene and Springfield, Oregon, for instance, specialized crisis responders and medics have responded to crisis calls for more than 30 years through a mobile intervention program called CAHOOTS, an acronym for \u201cCrisis Assistance Helping Out On The Streets.\u201d The program diverts between 3% and 8% of calls which would otherwise be handled by police, according to the Eugene Police Department, including providing care for people who are \u201cintoxicated, mentally ill, or disoriented.\u201d Jeremy Gates, the executive director of the White Bird Clinic, which runs CAHOOTS, told CNN part of the program\u2019s success lies in the trust its responders have built with clients over the years. \u201cPeople will call and say, I don\u2019t want the police, I want CAHOOTS,\u201d he said. And in Colorado, one former deputy was convicted of reckless endangerment, another pleaded guilty to two misdemeanors and six other officers are currently facing charges for shooting and killing a man experiencing a mental health crisis, a similar program called Support Team Assisted Response, known as STAR, operates in Denver. \u201cWe respond in a trauma-informed and empathetic manner,\u201d STAR Program Specialist Evan Thompkins told CNN in an interview. \u201cWe come in a kind and caring way, where we can kind of meet people where they\u2019re at, really get down on their level and provide more of a non-authoritarian approach.\u201d He noted for some people and communities, just the presence of uniformed police members can cause a situation to \u201cescalate.\u201d Some \u201ccommunities are afraid of the police and don\u2019t want to interact with the police,\u201d he said. Fountain House, a non-profit providing support for people living with serious mental illness in New York, has also highlighted Rozario\u2019s death to call for a vast expansion of the city\u2019s mental health intervention programs. Mental illness is primarily \u201ca public health issue, not a public safety issue,\u201d Arvind Sooknanan, a member of the board of directors at Fountain House, told CNN. The organization has laid out a plan for New York to \u201cmove as many mental health crisis calls as possible out of the 911 system\u201d and integrate the existing 988 mental health hotline \u201cwith the social service system to help people address root cause stressors.\u201d For Sooknanan, Rozario\u2019s case hits particularly close to home: Sooknanan has been living with serious mental illness since he was 15 and also comes from a South Asian background, like Rozario. The case \u201chas eaten away at me the past few weeks,\u201d he said. \u201cHe was only 19 years old. There was no reason for him to die.\u201d \u201cI want other people to have the same opportunities I did, to move forward with their lives, to find meaning, to find community,\u201d said Sooknanan, who is also working to help develop crisis intervention programs in other states. Ken Zimmerman, Fountain House\u2019s CEO, told CNN he envisions a future in which \u201cthe knowledge and awareness of what serious mental health conditions are is so much more widespread, that the kind of stigma and fear that drives so much is hugely diminished.\u201d Additionally, he emphasized the importance of expanding the city\u2019s resources and infrastructure for mental health care \u2013 a process that might take years. And those resources and planning need to take into account the lived experience of people living with serious mental illnesses themselves, he said. For the Rozario family, the fight to provide an alternative to police response for people in mental health crisis is powered by a dream that no other family should have to experience the anguish they\u2019ve felt. \u201cNo mother should have to go through the pain I\u2019m going through,\u201d Rozario\u2019s mother said. \u201cI hope no other mothers go through this in the future.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/12/us/win-rozario-nypd-killing/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_05_10_us_baltimore-key-bridge-cargo-ship", "text": "A plan to use small explosives on Saturday to break apart a massive chunk of a Baltimore bridge that collapsed on a cargo ship six weeks ago has been delayed due to poor weather conditions. US Coast Guard Petty Officer Second Class Ronald Hodges told CNN on Friday the controlled demolition will not happen on Saturday due to the adverse weather forecast. The Key Bridge Response Unified Command will determine if there\u2019s an opportunity for the demolition to take place Sunday, Hodges said. The plan was set to happen days after the sixth and final body was recovered from the waters where the 213-million-pound Dali cargo ship veered off course on March 26 and plowed into a pillar of the Francis Scott Key Bridge. The crash killed six construction workers and destroyed a key thoroughfare, crippling the economy at the Port of Baltimore. The discovery of the final construction worker lost in the tragedy is allowing crews to proceed with the next step in removing the massive debris and freeing the nearly 1,000-foot vessel. \u201cThe safest and swiftest method to remove the bridge piece from on top of the M/V Dali is by precision cuts made with small charges,\u201d according to Unified Command, which includes state and federal agencies responding to the disaster. \u201cThis is an industry-standard tool in controlled demolition that will break the span into smaller pieces, which will allow the work of refloating the vessel and removing it from the federal channel.\u201d If the explosives are used this weekend, the ship could be refloated and returned to the Port of Baltimore as soon as early next week,\u00a0The Baltimore Sun\u00a0and CNN affiliate\u00a0WBAL reported. While the arduous work to clear the debris continues, several investigations are underway to find what caused the disaster and who is responsible. The\u00a0House Committee on Transportation & Infrastructure\u00a0plans to hold a hearing Wednesday\u00a0to discuss an ongoing investigation into the catastrophe. The chair of the National Transportation Safety Board, along with officials from the Coast Guard, the Army Corps of Engineers and the Department of Transportation, are expected to testify.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/10/us/baltimore-key-bridge-cargo-ship/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "us"}}

{"id": "2024_05_11_us_rutgers-phd-student-dissertation-birth", "text": "In late March, Tamiah Brevard-Rodriguez had a plan leading up to her April 24 due date. Coined \u201cOperation Dissertation Before Baby,\u201d the plan included Brevard-Rodriguez completing her dissertation and having her baby in time to celebrate graduation and the summer with family. In that order. Brevard-Rodriguez\u2019s dissertation presentation \u2013 for her doctorate at Rutgers Graduate School of Education \u2013 focused on the beauty pressures placed on Black college women while enrolled at predominantly White educational institutions. But while she was in the middle of fine-tuning the dissertation early on March 25, things went decidedly off-plan. After working for a few hours and lying down to get some rest, Brevard-Rodriguez\u2019s water broke. While this was a happy moment, she was scheduled to deliver her dissertation that very day. Tamiah\u2019s wife, Alyza Brevard-Rodriguez, tried to calm her. \u201cI\u2019ve witnessed her work so hard, tirelessly working on the presentation, a six-year program, a two-year study.\u00a0I\u2019m just like, \u2018don\u2019t let today be the day,\u2019\u201d Alyza told CNN. \u201cI walk into the bathroom and I look at her and she is just shaking in tears. As much as I knew that this was a happy moment for the both of us, I can see the sadness on her that you know her day was possibly going to be ruined.\u201d They were planning to go to a birthing center, but their doula told them to get to the hospital quickly. Alyza helped Tamiah to the car and they sped down the highway in the dark, in what Alyza called a \u201crace to the finish line.\u201d When Tamiah started to go into labor, Alyza worried they wouldn\u2019t make it to the hospital in time for the baby\u2019s birth. They didn\u2019t. Tamiah had given birth in the car. \u201cWhen I looked over, she had the baby in her left hand and the umbilical cord in her right,\u201d Alyza said. They got to the hospital with baby Enzo. Doctors and nurses checked him out and cut his umbilical cord, joking that Tamiah \u201cdid all the hard work for us.\u201d Now was the time to rest, but Tamiah still had a dissertation to present. Alyza discussed possibly rescheduling the meeting with Tamiah\u2019s mentor. However, Tamiah worried if they rescheduled, it wouldn\u2019t happen in the time frame needed to graduate this year. \u201cAs I was laying there, I was just thinking to myself, \u2018I can do it,\u2019\u201d Tamiah recalled.\u00a0\u201cThe baby\u2019s here. Let\u2019s just get this over with.\u201d And so she did. Alyza brought her clothes, laptop and a makeup bag. \u201cI took a nap, ate a meal and then I was ready to rock and roll,\u201d Tamiah said. As she logged onto her laptop from her hospital bed, the only person who knew about her delivery earlier that morning was her mentor.\u00a0He didn\u2019t want anyone to give her sympathy, so he kept quiet. For about twenty to thirty minutes, she gave a stellar presentation, Tamiah says. With the presentation over, she took down her Rutgers background on Zoom, revealing the hospital. \u201cEveryone was in complete shock,\u201d Tamiah said. Tamiah\u2019s graduation ceremony is this Sunday, on Mother\u2019s Day. She says she will celebrate with a dinner with family and friends. Alyza also finished her doctorate recently, and their daughter Aubriel is soon graduating from preschool. \u201cIt\u2019s incredible to uplift women and show how incredibly powerful they are,\u201d Alyza said. \u201cI hope that people really take away from this that women are strong and resilient, tenacious, ambitious grit and they can do anything.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/11/us/rutgers-phd-student-dissertation-birth/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_05_11_us_columbia-commencement-protests-1968-reaj", "text": "Columbia University\u2019s graduating class of 1968 was no stranger to protests. The college years of its student body were marked by\u00a0the anti-Vietnam War movement and the fight for civil rights. In the spring of that year, a series of events \u2013 including the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. \u2013 inflamed long-simmering tensions between students and school administrators and in April, the campus erupted as students\u00a0occupied buildings during a \u201cstrike\u201d\u00a0that lasted more than a week. In the fallout of the strikes, then-university president Grayson Kirk moved the 1968 commencement ceremony from its traditional location on campus to the Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine, a few blocks away. It is spring once more, 56 years later, and Columbia finds itself at a similar crossroads now that the administration canceled the class of 2024\u2019s university-wide graduation ceremony in response to student protests over Israel\u2019s against Hamas in Gaza. Where Columbia goes from here could depend on whether it hears the echoes of past protests. When movements collide Columbia University\u2019s library details the events that led to 1968\u2019s controversial commencement in an online exhibit called \u201c1968: Columbia in Crisis.\u201d In the months leading up to graduation, protests roiled the university\u2019s campus as students from various groups led demonstrations against what they perceived to be the administration\u2019s racist policies and pro-war stance. In April 1967, a dispute at a US Marine Corps recruitment event sparked an \u201chour-long melee of fist fights and name-calling,\u201d according to the Columbia Spectator. The brawl led\u00a0Kirk to ban all demonstrations and protests within campus buildings. Students who violated the ban faced \u201cdisciplinary action and possibly dismissal,\u201d according to the Spectator, but it didn\u2019t stem the growing tide of disillusionment and frustration among Columbia\u2019s student body. Throughout 1968, students and members of the surrounding Harlem community protested the university\u2019s plans to build a gym in nearby Morningside Park, decrying the racism they saw in the separate and unequal access to the facilities, according to the university archive. Students and faculty also continued to oppose the university\u2019s involvement with the military, including Kirk\u2019s seat on the board of the Institute for Defense Analyses, a coalition of universities and government agencies conducting military research that\u2019s\u00a0still in operation today. Then on April 4, 1968, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated. As the nation reeled from Dr. King\u2019s murder, the university held a memorial in his honor. During the service, the chairman of Students for a Democratic Society, a progressive student group,\u00a0 accused administrators of upholding \u201ca policy of racism\u201d and committing a \u201cmoral outrage against Dr. King\u2019s memory,\u201d according to the Spectator. He then led dozens of students in a walk out, the Spectator reported. Campus implodes as students strike In the weeks after Dr. King\u2019s assassination, students from various on-campus groups united around the opposition to the Morningside gym. On April 23, organizers held a \u201cSun Dial Rally\u201d that featured a demonstration and march to the gymnasium site.\u00a0Students then staged a sit-in at Hamilton Hall \u2013 the same university building protesters occupied this year \u2013 and made their demands known. They included ending construction of the gym and demanding President Kirk sever ties with the Institute for Defense Analyses. Word of the demonstration spread like wildfire through Columbia\u2019s student body and students began to occupy other buildings across campus. The occupation would last for more than a week, as administrators tried in vain to negotiate with the student groups to find a resolution. Then, in the early hours of April 30, 1968, the administration sent the New York City Police Department to remove students from the buildings on campus. More than 700 students were arrested and nearly 150 were injured as police cleared the campus, according to the university\u2019s archive. The arrests only enflamed tensions between students and the Columbia administration. The strike continued through the remainder of the semester as students called for the resignation of President Kirk and the university\u2019s provost. Commencement becomes chaotic Columbia\u2019s class of 1968 graduated on June 4 and in a departure from tradition \u2013 and perhaps in acknowledgement of the tensions between students and his administration \u2013 Kirk did not deliver the commencement address. Instead, Richard Hofstadter, a history professor, spoke at a ceremony a few blocks from campus. As Hofstadter began to speak, about 300 members of the graduating class silently walked out. They marched to the university\u2019s Low Plaza, where nearly 2,000 people participated in a counter-commencement, according to the university archive. Those who remained to hear Hofstadter\u2019s speech that day were presented with a question: What kind of university do we want to be? \u201cHere at Columbia, we have suffered a disaster whose precise dimensions it is impossible to state, because the story is not yet finished, and the measure of our loss still depends upon what we do,\u201d Hofstadter said. \u201cHow can Columbia go on after this terrible wound? I can only answer: How can it not go on? The question is not whether it will continue but in what form,\u201d he said. Although it took Columbia University years to recover and reestablish trust between the administration and the student body, several key changes emerged after the 1968 protests. In March the following year, after working with Black student-leaders, Kirk agreed to suspend construction on the Morningside Gymnasium, according to the university\u2019s archive. Students and faculty also overwhelmingly approved the creation of a University Senate that spring. The senate, according to the university\u2019s archives, was composed of faculty, students and administrators and is an outlet to address \u201call matters of University-wide concern.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/11/us/columbia-commencement-protests-1968-reaj/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "us"}}
