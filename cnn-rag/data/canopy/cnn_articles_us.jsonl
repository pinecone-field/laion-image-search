{"id": "2024_06_17_us_juneteenth-red-food-drinks-reaj", "text": "Celebrity Chef Carla Hall\u2019s hibiscus ginger sweet tea soda isn\u2019t merely a creative beverage for Juneteenth celebrations, it\u2019s also an important homage to the African diaspora. The unique Juneteenth drink, along with numerous other red-hued foods and beverages, symbolizes the bloodshed and the profound sacrifices made by former enslaved Black Americans, according to food historian Adrian E Miller. Miller also noted that red is a royal color in African society, adding depth to the folklore surrounding Juneteenth. On June 19, communities around the country will gather with food, parades, games, music, and vibrant displays of Black culture to celebrate the rich tapestry of resilience and triumph that embodies Juneteenth. A combination of the words June and nineteenth,\u00a0June 19, 1865\u00a0is the day that\u00a0Union Army Maj. Gen. Gordon Granger\u00a0rode into Galveston, Texas, and issued\u00a0General Order No. 3,\u00a0proclaiming that the enslaved African Americans they were free. This announcement came\u00a0two and a half years\u00a0after President Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation, which couldn\u2019t be enforced in areas under Confederate control. Despite being freed years earlier, this was the first-time enslaved Texans were told about their freedom, ending the practice of slavery in the United States. After years of being celebrated mostly by Black Americans, in 2021\u00a0Juneteenth became a federal holiday\u00a0in the US \u2014 the first to be approved since Martin Luther King Jr. Day in 1983. Many Black Americans commemorate the freedom from enslavement granted on that day with an array of red foods, such as barbecue, watermelon, red velvet cake, and strawberry pie. Streets will come alive with the aromas of grilled meats and spices mingling with the sweet scents of freshly baked pies and cakes. \u201cI think food is the glue,\u201d Hall told CNN. The renowned chef, who became known for her culinary prowess on the hit TV series Top Chef and The Chew, said food is \u201cthe way we carry those stories of our ancestors.\u201d While recipes may differ from generation to generation, Hall said food can be a source of unity and that often helps people maintain their roots. \u201cSo, I think in the spirit of this holiday \u2026 for me, it\u2019s about, getting to know me, getting to understand me and what my contributions \u2013 my ancestors contributions \u2013 are through food,\u201d Hall said. With roots in Texas, and dyed a vibrant red hue, Big Red Soda has become a common drink served at many Juneteenth celebrations.\u00a0But Miller noted, the Juneteenth menu is evolving, embracing inventive twists on tradition. In addition to preparing classics, such as barbeque, Hall said each year she tries to challenge herself to become more creative with her Juneteenth recipes. She incorporates hibiscus \u2013 which infuses food with a deep red color \u2013 into her meats, salads and rice dishes. She also makes a hibiscus ginger sweet tea soda. Hall urged those who embrace the symbolism on Juneteenth to let each sip and every bite serve as a reminder of the resilience and sacrifices of those who fought for freedom, urging us to confront the injustices of the past. She also encouraged people to find ways to commemorate and honor the freedom and sacrifices of the enslaved throughout the year. \u201cA red drink is symbolic \u2026 but what are you doing the rest of the time?\u201d Hall said.\u00a0 Juneteenth, she said, is\u00a0a day not only to rejoice but to recommit ourselves to the ongoing work of justice, year-round.

{"id": "2024_06_16_us_los-angeles-post-fire", "text": "A fire in Los Angeles County that forced the evacuations of hundreds of people from a state park has burned more than 15,000 acres since it started Saturday, authorities said. The Post Fire had burned 15,611 acres and was 20% contained as of Monday evening,\u00a0according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, also known as Cal Fire. More than 1,000 firefighters were on scene, with more on their way, Los Angeles County Fire Department Section Chief Kenichi Ballew-Haskett told CNN Monday morning. \u201cWe\u2019re getting people on notice that if we have to issue a mandatory evacuation order that they need to leave,\u201d Ballew-Haskett said, advising people residents to have their bags packed, a full tank of gas and cell phones ready. \u201cOnce the sheriffs come by or law enforcement asks you to leave, it means the danger is imminent.\u201d The wildfire began Saturday afternoon in Gorman, an unincorporated community in northwestern Los Angeles County. The cause of the blaze is still under investigation, according to Cal Fire. California State Park Services evacuated 1,200 people from Hungry Valley Park, Cal Fire said. The fire had destroyed one commercial property by Monday evening, according to the Los Angeles County Fire Department. Evacuation orders are in place for areas west of Interstate 5 between Pyramid Lake and Gorman, and evacuation warnings are in place for areas south of Pyramid Lake between Old Ridge Route and the Los Angeles County line. Additional evacuation orders were issued Monday afternoon for the area south of Pyramid Lake, west of I-5, east of the County line and just north of the Templin Highway, the Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department said. As of Monday afternoon, the blaze was not spreading outside its current perimeter, but crews are still concerned about high winds that are supposed to continue through Tuesday afternoon, Fire Public Information Officer Flemming Bertelsen with the Los Padres National Forest\u00a0told CNN. Crews have been maintaining the perimeter of the fire by patrolling the line and looking for spot fires, Bertelsen\u00a0said. \u201cThe fire is not spreading in any significant manner right now, our lines are holding, but we have like 24 hours more of this wind,\u201d Bertelsen said, adding winds have been reaching 50 to 60 mph at the ridge tops. Low humidity is also a major concern, he said. \u201cWe are going to be tested, especially tonight,\u201d he said. The most active part of the fire is close to Piru Creek \u2013 and if it crosses the creek, the wildfire will enter heavy mountain terrain, he said. The National Weather Service in Los Angeles warned Sunday of wind gusts up to 60 to 70 mph, creating conditions that could potentially fuel the flames. A red flag warning was issued for the I-5 corridor in Los Angeles County and the Ventura County mountains until 5 p.m. Monday. Two adults and a child were taken to a hospital with minor injuries, CNN affiliate KABC reported, citing a spokesperson for the Los Angeles County Fire Department. Crews are working to contain the fire and \u201caircraft are working to stop forward progress but have limited visibility,\u201d according to the fire department. Pyramid Lake is also closed because of the threat posed by the fire, the fire department said. Meanwhile in Northern California, the Point Fire had burned about 1,190 acres in Sonoma County and destroyed at least two structures as of Monday evening, according to Cal Fire. Evacuation orders were issued Sunday for some residents, with first responders going door to door to assist, the Sonoma County Sheriff\u2019s Office said. Officials have deployed 36 fire engines, three helicopters, seven dozers, six hand crews and three water tenders to fight the fire, which was about 20% contained by Monday evening, Cal Fire reported. Another wildfire, the Aero Fire, started southeast of Sacramento Monday afternoon and grew with dangerous speed, consuming over 900 acres within just an hour and a half, Cal Fire said in\u00a0a post on Facebook. By Monday evening, it had grown to 1,500 acres. Strong winds are impacting firefighters\u2019 ability to establish a containment line, the post added. Evacuation orders and warnings were in place, according to the post, but aerials from CNN affiliate KCRA show the area is not densely populated. It\u2019s not immediately clear how many structures are threatened in the area. Further north, the Sites Fire in Colusa County had burned more than 4,400 acres and had no containment as of Monday evening, according to Cal Fire.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/16/us/los-angeles-post-fire/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "us"}}

My father was an Army surgeon who operated on wounded soldiers, and yet anything mechanical, automotive or electronic mystified him. He\u2019d drive for miles with the oil light warning him his engine was about to seize up. Equipment like riding mowers, tillers and trimmers filled our garage \u2014 each in need of repair due to mistreatment or neglect. And if something like a refrigerator light blew out, well, you\u2019d just have to find the milk in the dark until the repairman arrived. Following his example, I too spent most of my adult life replacing things that stopped working or calling in a professional for the \u201cbig\u201d jobs, like a running toilet or a broken light switch. All that changed the day the TV exploded. Well, not the entire TV, just a very important part of a very large and expensive unit that was too big to fit in a cab for a ride from our home in Brooklyn to Best Buy for repair. My first instinct, of course, was to see how much a replacement would cost. The answer: about $1,000. But while searching for that particular model online, I came across several posts discussing a common problem: A part of that TV model called the color wheel was prone to failing spectacularly in a burst of light and shattered glass. Among those posts was a link to some YouTube videos purporting to show how to replace the offending part step-by-step. When I clicked the link, sure enough, there was my TV sitting on a workbench, along with a few tools like screwdrivers and a pair of pliers. Watching the first of two videos, I followed along as a pair of hands removed dozens of screws, panels and circuit boards \u2014 pausing to take a digital photo before and after each step to create a trail of breadcrumbs \u2014 until the shattered color wheel emerged deep in the guts of the TV. The second video showed the new wheel\u2019s installation, and then every part strewn on the workbench was put back in its place until the final screw was turned. Total running time for the job: 45 minutes. At that point, I decided I had little to lose but time and dignity, so I ordered the replacement part for a few hundred dollars and it arrived the next day. Setting the TV on the kitchen island next to my laptop, I started the YouTube video and picked up a screwdriver. Six hours later, I was done. Taking a deep breath and plugging the TV back in, I pressed the power button and offered a prayer to the electronics gods. After a brief moment, I heard the color wheel begin to hum and Channel 4 filled the screen. It felt like a triumph. YouTube can be a DIYer\u2019s best friend That was roughly 15 years ago, and since that first foray into the do-it-yourself world, I\u2019ve taken on several similar projects. Instead of picking up the phone I scour the internet for videos, lost instruction and repair manuals, even threads from questions thrown out into the universe like, \u201cDoes anyone know how to descale a Breville espresso maker?\u201d (Yes, there are dozens of tutorial videos on that subject alone.) Another benefit of DIY projects is that you avoid the embarrassment of flagging down a store employee and asking \u201cWhere do I find the thing for the toilet that makes the water stop running?\u201d (It\u2019s called a flapper). After purchasing three flappers and returning two, I learned to take the words \u201cuniversal\u201d on replacement-part packaging with a grain of salt. Take a picture of the broken part and measure it. Otherwise when you get to the right aisle in Home Depot, you\u2019ll inevitably pick the wrong part. After some trial and error \u2014 mostly error \u2014 I\u2019ve found that most replacement parts can be found quickly and easily online and likely installed with patience and a few simple tools like a screwdriver, an adjustable wrench or pliers. Say, for example, that you backed your minivan into your neighbor\u2019s driveway gate and smashed your taillight \u2014 twice. Ahem. Instead of making an appointment at the dealership, you can type \u201c2016 Toyota Sienna passenger side taillight\u201d into Google and will see a dozen websites selling a new or used replacement part known as a \u201ctail light assembly,\u201d a self-contained unit that houses your brake light and directional. A new replacement assembly typically costs anywhere from $40 to $100. Again, you can likely find a video made by someone fed up with service department charges who will show you how to remove the broken one and install the new one. When I say that the last time I replaced my taillight it required only a screwdriver and took less than five minutes, that is not an exaggeration. Some parts, such as a cracked side-view mirror cover, literally snap into place. The engine air filter that costs $75 at the dealership is about $20 online and can be installed in seconds. Does all this make me sound like a cheapskate? Probably. But it also makes me something of a household hero (no \u201csuper\u201d and lowercase \u201ch\u201d) when I install a new dishwasher in the afternoon and the dishes are clean by dinner. It also fills me with a sense of pride and accomplishment akin to completing the Lego Millennium Falcon with my boys (spoiler alert: they crashed it). Some projects \u2014 like electrical repair \u2014 are best left to the pros Are there repairs I would not recommend taking on? Absolutely. Unless you are 100% confident about where the main breaker switch is, don\u2019t mess with electrical switches or outlets. The same goes for installing a smart thermostat. Electricity kills. So does natural gas, so leave gas dryers and stoves to the pros. Plumbing is a toss-up. Hooking up a new washing machine or fixing a running toilet is simple \u2014 even a new dishwasher is not difficult once you\u2019ve seen how it\u2019s done. Just remember to turn off the water valves before you attempt anything. When finished, turn the water valves back on slowly and \u201cstop, look and listen\u201d for drips or leaks. Water can do as much damage to a home as fire. When it comes to routine auto maintenance like oil changes, do the environment a favor and take your car to a shop that will store the old oil responsibly for future recycling. But do feel free to tell them you\u2019ll change your own engine and cabin air filters because you found this great how-to video online. Are there projects I have royally messed up? You bet. After I had some new flooring professionally installed, I thought I\u2019d save money and paint the new baseboards myself. After spending two hours on my hands and knees putting down blue tape, I got to work. By hour three my back was aching and my wrist was sore. At the four-hour mark I was lying on my side, cursing, but I had finished. The next morning I peeled off the tape and saw a thin border of white paint all along the edge of the new hardwood. I spent two hours with a razor blade carefully scraping it off. One final thought on the road to becoming a do-it-yourselfer. Early on in my how-to journey, I stumbled upon a plumbing video that offered the single best piece of I have ever received regarding home repair and improvement projects: \u201cIf the tool you need to make the repair costs more than hiring the person who already owns the tool, hire the person.\u201d Now then, who\u2019s up for some spackling?", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/18/us/youtube-tutorial-videos-fixing-broken-cec/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "us"}}

CDK operates numerous different types of products car dealers use to handle things like keeping records of negotiated deals to scheduling and communicating about service. Not every dealer uses CDK\u2019s products, and even those that do may not use them for everything, but it\u2019s been a problem for many. \u201cWe have customers coming in today who had deals saved in the system,\u201d said Jeff Ramsey, an executive with Ourisman Auto Group, which is headquartered in Maryland. To protect customer privacy, customer\u2019s details aren\u2019t written out on a piece of paper that\u2019s just sitting on the desk anymore. Instead, information about deals and customer appointments is kept in a server that\u2019s now impossible for his salespeople to access. Ramsey said he understands, though, that CDK is doing what it feels it must to secure this sensitive data. But it\u2019s a major hassle in the meantime and could cost his dealerships some business. Customers who are delayed in closing a sale at one of his dealerships could just find a dealer nearby that\u2019s not having these issues and buy a new vehicle there, instead.

Biden administration officials have worked with the American Battle Monuments Commission (ABMC) to restore\u00a0the\u00a0program,\u00a0which allows Gold Star families to have flowers placed on their loved one\u2019s grave at US military cemeteries abroad. \u201cThe White House worked with the ABMC and this program will now be re-established,\u201d the official said. It is expected to be included in the coming budget year. For years, Gold Star families who lost loved ones in battle could pay for flowers and have the ABMC deliver them to the grave of their fallen family members in, say, Normandy. That program ended in 2015. On the 80th anniversary of D-Day,  CNN\u2019s \u201cThe Lead with Jake Tapper\u201d reported on the loss of the program.

Chief of Staff Jeff Zients directed the team to pull all levers to get this program running and stayed on top of it personally to make sure it was done.\u201d Retired Marine General John Kelly, who helped bring the cause to CNN\u2019s attention, said Wednesday that \u201cthis decision to reinstate the flowers program is simply the right thing to do.\u201d \u201cI know the Gold Star Families from every conflict will rejoice at this decision.

{"id": "2024_06_17_us_swinomish-tribe-oil-train-trespassing", "text": "Seattle (AP) \u2014 BNSF Railway must pay nearly $400 million to a Native American tribe in Washington state, a federal judge ordered Monday after finding that the company intentionally trespassed when it repeatedly ran 100-car trains carrying crude oil across the tribe\u2019s reservation. US District Judge Robert Lasnik initially\u00a0ruled last year\u00a0that the railway deliberately violated the terms of a 1991 easement with the Swinomish Tribe north of Seattle that allows trains to carry no more than 25 cars per day. The judge held a trial earlier this month to determine how much in profits BNSF made through trespassing from 2012 to 2021 and how much it should be required to disgorge. The company based in Fort Worth, Texas, said in an email it had no comment on the judgment. The tribe, which has about 1,400 members, did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment. The tribe sued in 2015 after BNSF dramatically increased, without the tribe\u2019s consent, the number of cars it was running across the reservation so that it could ship crude oil from the Bakken Formation in and around North Dakota to a nearby refinery. The route crosses sensitive marine ecosystems along the coast, over water that connects with the Salish Sea, where the tribe has treaty-protected rights to fish. Bakken oil is easier to refine into the fuels sold at the gas pump and ignites more easily. After train cars carrying Bakken crude oil exploded in Alabama, North Dakota and Quebec, a federal agency warned in 2014 that the oil has a higher degree of volatility than other crudes in the U.S. Last year, two BNSF engines derailed on Swinomish land, leaking an estimated 3,100 gallons (11,700 liters) of diesel fuel near Padilla Bay. The 1991 easement limited rail traffic to one train of 25 cars per day in each direction. It required BNSF to tell the tribe about the \u201cnature and identity of all cargo\u201d transported across the reservation, and it said the tribe would not arbitrarily withhold permission to increase the number of trains or cars. The tribe learned through a 2011 Skagit County planning document that a nearby refinery would start receiving crude oil trains. It wasn\u2019t until the following year that the tribe received information from BNSF addressing current track usage, court documents show. The tribe and BNSF discussed amending the agreement, but \u201cat no point did the Tribe approve BNSF\u2019s unilateral decision to transport unit trains across the Reservation, agree to increase the train or car limitations, or waive its contractual right of approval,\u201d Lasnik said in his decision last year. \u201cBNSF failed to update the Tribe regarding the nature of the cargo that was crossing the Reservation and unilaterally increased the number of trains and the number of cars without the Tribe\u2019s written agreement, thereby violating the conditions placed on BNSF\u2019s permission to enter the property,\u201d Lasnik said. The four-day trial this month was designed to provide the court with details and expert testimony to guide the judge through complex calculations about how much in \u201cill-gotten\u201d profit BNSF should have to disgorge. Lasnik put that figure at $362 million and added $32 million in post-tax profits such as investment income for a total of more than $394 million. In reality, the judge wrote, BNSF made far more than $32 million in post-tax profits, but adding all of that up would have added hundreds of millions more to what was already a large judgment against the railway.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/17/us/swinomish-tribe-oil-train-trespassing/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "us"}}

It\u2019s a stunning rebuke to one of the world\u2019s preeminent authorities on anti-Jewish hate and a significant advocate for the rights and causes of American Jews. The editors, a group of volunteer moderators for one of the world\u2019s most popular information websites, voted last week to label the ADL as a \u201cgenerally unreliable\u201d source on the Israel-Palestine conflict. That means that the ADL should usually not be cited in Wikipedia articles on that topic except for extraordinary circumstances. Other generally unreliable sources, according to Wikipedia editors, include Russian state media, Fox News\u2019 political coverage and Amazon reviews. The ADL also faces a vote from Wikipedia editors to potentially label the organization as unreliable on the topic of antisemitism. The editors overwhelmingly support that label but continue to debate the decision, which could ultimately deal a blow to the credibility of the leading source of research and information on antisemitism. The Wikipedia editors said in an online forum that the ADL\u2019s dual role as an advocacy and research organization prevented it from providing unbiased accounts on Israel or antisemitism. \u201cThe ADL is heavily biased regarding Israel/Palestine to the point of often acting as a pro-Israel lobbying organization,\u201d wrote an editor with the username Loki, who has edited more than 3,000 Wikipedia articles. \u201cThis can and does compromise its ability to accurately report facts regarding people and organizations that disagree with it on this issue, especially non-Zionist or anti-Zionist Jews and Jewish organizations.\u201d A minority of editors disagreed, arguing the editors voting in favor failed to provide evidence that the ADL has made false claims because of its advocacy work. The ADL strongly rebuked the decision. \u201cIt is deeply disturbing that the many editors who flagged the severe flaws and inaccuracies in both the reasoning and sources being used in this campaign to delegitimize ADL are being ignored,\u201d an ADL spokesman said in a statement. \u201cThey have provided point by point refutations, grounded in factual citations, to every claim made, but apparently facts no longer matter.\u201d Calling the decision \u201ca sad development for research and education\u201d and \u201cdevastating for the Jewish community and society,\u201d the ADL said it would continue its work to fight antisemitism. But the spokesman warned Wikipedia\u2019s action would prevent information on antisemitism from reaching the public. ADL adapts to a changing world Prior to Hamas\u2019 deadly attack on Israel on October 7, the ADL had been largely focused on educating about and advocating for action against the rise in antisemitism around the world. That alarming trend included (and continues to include) a growing number of threats and anti-Jewish actions taken by White supremacist groups, and ADL CEO Jonathan Greenblatt became a frequent guest on television news, such as CNN. After the events of October 7 and the ongoing war that followed, the ADL produced numerous reports about rising antisemitic hate speech and incidents, particularly on college campuses. It produced two report cards on universities\u2019 actions to protect Jewish students, giving failing grades to more than a dozen colleges. But the ADL faced some criticism for doubling down on what some detractors believed was an overly broad definition of antisemitism that included anti-Zionism and some anti-Israel speech and actions. \u201cADL\u2019s leadership has taken a much more aggressive stance than most academic researchers in blurring the distinction between anti-Zionism and antisemitism,\u201d said James Loeffler, professor of modern Jewish history at John Hopkins University. \u201cIt\u2019s clear from reading the Wikipedia editors\u2019 conversation that they are heavily influenced by the ADL leadership\u2019s comments.\u201d Greenblatt and the ADL made clear that political opposition to Israel\u2019s government and policies were acceptable and not antisemitic. But those who denied Jews had the right to self-determination and freedom in their homeland were antisemitic, according to the ADL. \u201cLet\u2019s make this very clear: Anti-Zionism is antisemitism,\u201d Greenblatt said at an ADL \u201cState of Hate\u201d event in March. \u201cAntizionism is a negation of Jewish history, a denial of Jewish humanity.\u201d That didn\u2019t sit well with Wikipedia\u2019s editors. For example, one editor, with the username Sameboat, claimed the ADL leader\u2019s advocacy \u201cdemonstrates its skewed views and manipulative presentation on the IP (Israel-Palestine) topic and thus (is) highly unreliable.\u201d Balancing advocacy with trusted information The ADL has built an expertise in tracking antisemitic threats and hate groups and has done beneficial work in providing the world with information and data about antisemitism, particularly because so few organizations are doing that kind of research, noted Loeffler. And the fact that the ADL balances advocacy with research is not a new problem for the organization. But Wikipedia\u2019s decision may reflect a changing landscape that the ADL needs to reckon with. The war in Gaza has deeply divided people of all backgrounds, including Jews. The war has added significant ambiguity and complications to the world\u2019s view of the Israel-Palestine conflict. If Wikipedia\u2019s editors are distancing themselves from the ADL, that could suggest media, academic and partnering advocacy organizations will think twice about how they approach ADL data in their own efforts to inform their audiences on antisemitism. \u201cThe challenge to the ADL is to separate the advocacy from the data when it comes to the overall message,\u201d Loeffler said. \u201cI think this is going to be a difficult blow to the credibility to the ADL in its role on this issue. The staff there will continue to do rigorous work, but this will provide an opportunity for self-reflection.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/19/media/wikipedia-adl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_19_us_undocumented-spouses-biden-immigration-policy-cec", "text": "In love, married and pregnant, Ashley DeAzevedo faced an impossible choice she never expected. If her husband, an undocumented immigrant from Brazil, wanted to become a US citizen, he\u2019d have to leave the country for a decade. It\u2019s been more than 11 years since an immigration attorney delivered the devastating news, but she can still feel its sting. \u201cI just remember the conversation feeling like somebody took the air out of my lungs. Because I was not expecting that. And neither was he,\u201d DeAzevedo says. On Tuesday, the 38-year-old New Jersey hair salon owner was starting to feel like she could breathe again. DeAzevedo sat in the second row of an event at the White House and cheered as President Biden announced a new policy that aims to help her family and about a half million others in a similar situation. The measure allows certain undocumented spouses and children of US citizens to apply for lawful permanent residency without leaving the country. \u201cThis is really significant,\u201d said Julia Gelatt, associate director of the US program at the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute. \u201cIt\u2019s removing a barrier that\u2019s prevented hundreds of thousands of unauthorized immigrants from obtaining that green card that they\u2019re otherwise eligible for.\u201d The election-year announcement is already drawing high praise from Democrats and fierce criticism from Republicans. DeAzevedo, president of American Families United, an organization that advocates for mixed-status families, says it shouldn\u2019t be about politics, but about doing what\u2019s right. She spoke with CNN this week before and after Biden\u2019s announcement, sharing how living in the shadows has affected her, her husband and their 11-year-old son, and what this new policy could mean for them and many others. Excerpts from those conversations have been edited for length and clarity. How are you feeling? Wow, like my feet have not hit the ground yet. Today was just one of the wildest in my life, to go to the White House for the first time, and to be there when the president made such a historic announcement. I mean, I\u2019m not an emotional person generally. I don\u2019t cry a lot. But it was very hard for me to hold my emotions. I was a sobbing, crying mess listening to him speak, because he was telling my story. He was speaking about my family and all the families of the people that I love and care about. I think a lot of people assume that when an undocumented immigrant marries a US citizen, there\u2019s an easy path to legalize their status. Yeah. That is not the case. When did you first realize that? We were newly married at the time. I was pregnant. I knew my husband didn\u2019t have status in the United States. But I figured, let me just find a lawyer. So we met with her. And she said, \u201cWell, here comes the bad news. I can\u2019t do anything to help you guys. Your husband would have to leave the country for 10 years.\u201d (After meeting with the attorney), we were like, well, what are we going to do? I can\u2019t move to Brazil. I have my business here. I have my family here. And I obviously didn\u2019t want to raise a child without my husband. So, we made the decision to stay here in the shadows, hoping that something would change. It\u2019s not an easy lifestyle. It\u2019s not for the faint of heart. How have your daily lives been shaped by this situation? It\u2019s frustrating because my husband can\u2019t ever work to his full ability. It\u2019s all just side jobs and whatever. We had to not really live up to what we could potentially. I had to qualify for a mortgage all by myself because he couldn\u2019t be on it with me. He can\u2019t get life insurance. He can\u2019t get health insurance. There\u2019s just so many different, nuanced, stupid, stupid things that he\u2019s excluded from. It feels like being a second-class citizen. It\u2019s like you live here and you pay taxes, but you can\u2019t be treated like a human being like everyone else around you. It just feels so cruel. He hasn\u2019t seen his parents in 18 years. His dad passed away, and he was never able to go back and see him. I think people forget the human toll. You\u2019re never going to be able to get that moment back. He\u2019s never going to be able to give his dad one last hug. Before you met your husband and went through all of this alongside him, was this something that was on your radar at all? Not really. I had some friends in the Brazilian community, so I kind of had an idea, but I never really understood. For me, it just wasn\u2019t really important, because on one side of my family, we\u2019ve been here since the Revolutionary War. And on the other side, my mom\u2019s side of the family, I\u2019m a third-generation American with ancestors from Italy who came over through Ellis Island. The immigrant story is something that\u2019s very rich in my family. It just never crossed my mind that there would be this ridiculous hurdle for somebody if they\u2019re married to an American. Do you find yourself often meeting people that don\u2019t realize that this is the reality that a lot of families are living in? What do you tell them? It\u2019s not something I share regularly. It\u2019s not like I wear a badge that\u2019s like, \u201cmy husband\u2019s, undocumented.\u201d But if I hear people speaking disparagingly about immigrants, I can\u2019t help myself but say, \u201cyou don\u2019t know the whole story. Don\u2019t \u2018good immigrant, bad immigrant\u2019 with me. Because my husband, who you love spending time with and you think is such a great human, is part of this group of people.\u201d When I explain it to people, it blows their mind. What is the significance of this new measure for you and your family? I think the devil is in the details, and it\u2019s really going to matter exactly how they implement the policy. What was announced today was the nuts and bolts, you know, the intention, the directive, and the basic framework, but no real, significant details on implementation. For my husband, it really could be the piece that unlocks his green card pathway that he does have, it just is only available to him after 10 years outside the country. If that were the case, then he could move forward onto his green card and eventually one day become a citizen. That would give him the ability to see his mom again for the first time in 18 years. It would give my son the ability to travel with his dad, to go meet his grandma. He\u2019s never met her before. It would just mean a lot of things \u2014 peace of mind, never worrying after my husband gets pulled over. It\u2019s just terrifying. If he\u2019s late or he doesn\u2019t answer his phone, your mind automatically goes to the worst place. And it sounds like having a work permit would be a game changer? Yeah, a total game changer. You first became more politically involved in the time of family separations during the Trump administration. Do you worry that, as significant as a policy like this is, it\u2019s something that a future administration could undo? I\u2019m kind of conflicted with that, because there are always concerns. I\u2019m sure there are going to be legal challenges. But during the pandemic when the initial CARES Act funding excluded mixed-status families, Republican senators like Marco Rubio and John Cornyn really came to our aid and fought for that to be made right and retroactive, so that when the next round of funding came out, it covered our families as well, not our spouses, but it made sure US citizens and their children were able to collect those funds. So knowing that Republicans fought through this before, and Donald Trump actually is the one who agreed and signed it into law, leads me to believe that maybe the \u201cparty of family values\u201d might see that this isn\u2019t a fair situation. And Donald Trump\u2019s wife is an immigrant. He knows the process. He gets it. He\u2019s fallen in love with somebody from a different country as well. So he knows better than anybody that our families should be treated the same as everyone else. Already Republican leadership is slamming this new policy as a \u201cmass amnesty scheme.\u201d What\u2019s your response to that? It\u2019s disappointing. I hope they\u2019ll reconsider their position on that. Not only because their candidate for president is married to an immigrant who was able to benefit from the spousal green card pathway, but also, you know, have a little compassion and see that we\u2019re American families. My family goes back to the Revolutionary War here, and the thought that my husband wouldn\u2019t be welcome in this country is just outrageous. Are there any questions that you have right now about what\u2019s next? What\u2019s on your mind right now as you think of the months to come? Well, all of the partners we\u2019ve been advocating with and the people we\u2019ve been working with inside government, we have a lot of conversations coming up. I want to make sure that my members are covered \u2014 not only those that are here in the US. I think a really important piece to tell of this story is the Americans that went through the process, found themselves outside of the country for an interview and were barred from returning if they got bad legal advice or something like that. There are families that are separated right now that are really, really suffering. And we need to make sure that there is relief for them as well. Today was one step in the right direction, like a down payment on a promise,\u00a0and there\u2019s a lot of work ahead. Did your husband and your son come with you to the White House? My son and my mom came with me. My husband, because of policy, wasn\u2019t able to come to the White House. He is here in DC, though, and he was able to celebrate. He was watching it live. For him, it\u2019s surreal. You know, he\u2019s lived this reality where again, he hasn\u2019t seen his mom for 18 years. His dad passed away since he left Brazil. If he ever gets to return, he\u2019s going to be there and his dad won\u2019t be there. So today was the first time that he really felt like there was a glimmer of hope for some sense of normalcy for him.

{"id": "2024_06_18_us_robert-morris-gateway-church-sexual-abuse-allegations-resignation", "text": "A Dallas-area megachurch accepted the resignation of senior pastor\u00a0Robert Morris\u00a0on Tuesday after allegations of a past inappropriate relationship with a 12-year-old surfaced last week. The Board of Elders of Gateway Church said in a statement Tuesday that prior to June 14, they didn\u2019t have all the facts of the abuse. \u201cThe elders\u2019 prior understanding was that Morris\u2019s extramarital relationship, which he discussed many times throughout his ministry, was with \u2018a young lady\u2019 and not abuse of a 12-year-old child,\u201d the statement reads. \u201cEven though it occurred many years before Gateway was established, as leaders of the church, we regret that we did not have the information that we now have.\u201d The elders said they were \u201cheartbroken and appalled\u201d and expressed sympathy to the victim and her family. \u201cWhen I was in my early twenties, I was involved in inappropriate sexual behavior with a young lady in a home where I was staying. It was kissing and petting and not intercourse, but it was wrong. This behavior happened on several occasions over the next few years,\u201d the pastor said in a statement. The woman, Cindy Clemishire, told WFAA the abuse started on Christmas Day in 1982 and continued until 1987, when she told her parents. The Wartburg Watch, a church watchdog blog,\u00a0first reported\u00a0her account Friday. Clemishire has mixed feelings about the news of Morris\u2019 resignation, she said in a statement released through her attorney. \u201cThough I am grateful that he is no longer a pastor at Gateway, I am disappointed that the Board of Elders allowed him to resign,\u201d she said. \u201cHe should have been terminated.\u201d Morris\u2019 behavior was \u201cbrought to light\u201d in 1987 while he was a pastor at Shady Grove Church in Grand Prairie, which has since become one of Gateway Church\u2019s 11 locations, WFAA reported. \u201cIn March of 1987,\u00a0this situation was brought to light, and\u00a0it was confessed and repented of. I submitted myself to the Elders of Shady Grove Church and the young lady\u2019s father. They asked me to step out of ministry and receive counseling and freedom ministry, which I did. Since that time, I have walked in purity and accountability in this area,\u201d Morris said in his statement, adding he and his wife met with the survivor and her family in 1989. \u201cI asked their forgiveness, and they graciously forgave me,\u201d he said. Clemishire told WFAA that though her family forgave him, they never supported Morris returning to the ministry. \u201cI think leaders can get caught up and think it\u2019s our responsibility to protect God and it\u2019s not. Our responsibility is to protect the people,\u201d she added. \u201cGod is bigger than all of that.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/18/us/robert-morris-gateway-church-sexual-abuse-allegations-resignation/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2022_09_25_us_minneapolis-crime-defund-invs", "text": "Marnette Gordon was doing laundry at home in Minneapolis one summer morning last year when a call came from her 36-year-old son.  She figured her son, Telly Blair, was checking in to see if she wanted a soda from a gas station down the street, where he often went for fuel and snacks.  \u201cMom, I\u2019ve been shot,\u201d he said. \u201cCall the police!\u201d Marnette, her other son Tamarcus and his 12-year-old daughter rushed to the gas station from their home in the city\u2019s north side, a part of town long beset by violent crime.  Blair\u2019s family came upon his blue 1986 Chevy Caprice at pump No. 5 \u2014 beating police and paramedics by a few minutes, they said \u2014 only to find him slumped in his car, bleeding from multiple bullet wounds in his chest. A 17-year-old male in an orange hoodie had fired nine rounds from a handgun into Blair\u2019s car before running off. While an off-duty nurse in scrubs who\u2019d been at the gas station tried to stop his bleeding, Marnette \u2014 a heart-transplant recipient \u2014 couldn\u2019t bear to watch and stood at a distance. Telly was her caretaker. \u201cIt was just horrible to see him sitting there, waiting on the ambulance,\u201d she told CNN. The 12-year-old called 911 while watching her uncle struggle to breathe. \u201cOh my God, please,\u201d the girl, who was crying, said to a dispatcher, according to 911 transcripts of the August 9, 2021 shooting obtained by CNN. \u201cHurry up, hurry up, hurry, hurry, he\u2019s dead, hurry up!\u201d  Telly Blair was among 93 people who were murdered in Minneapolis last year, city crime data shows. That\u2019s just a few shy of the total killings in 1995, when the city earned the nickname \u201cMurderapolis.\u201d (Neighboring St. Paul witnessed 38 murders last year \u2014 a historic high.)  After the police murder of George Floyd in May of 2020, Minneapolis became a worldwide symbol of the police brutality long endured disproportionately by Black people. In a kind of Newtonian response, the city became the epicenter of the culturally seismic \u201cDefund the Police\u201d movement. But that progressive local effort fizzled with a decisive referendum last November.  Now, with its police department under investigation by the Department of Justice, the city of 425,000 is trying to find a way forward amid a period of heightened crime that began shortly after Floyd\u2019s death. That year, the number of murders soared to nearly 80 \u2014 dwarfing the 2019 body count of 46. It has cooled somewhat this year, though the amount of killing \u2014 and violent crime in general \u2014 remains elevated far above 2019 levels and homicides are on pace to surpass the 2020 figure. The reasons why are far from clear. KG Wilson, a longtime resident of the Twin Cities, said police withdrew from violent neighborhoods in the aftermath of Floyd\u2019s killing \u2014 a common sentiment among locals. \u201cThe criminals were celebrating. They were getting rich,\u201d he said. \u201cThey were selling drugs openly.\u201d  Wilson told CNN the violence devastated his own family: His 6-year-old granddaughter was killed in May of 2021 after getting caught in the crossfire of a gunfight in north Minneapolis. The culprit remains at large.  Another factor was the pandemic, which some observers see as the biggest impetus for the crime surge. \u201cIt unsettled settled trajectories,\u201d said Mark Osler, a former federal prosecutor who is now a professor at St. Thomas School of Law in Minneapolis. \u201cKids who were going to school, who would have graduated but drifted off because there is no school \u2014 we\u2019re seeing a lot of the violent crime is by juveniles.\u201d   Citing sinking morale in the wake of the unrest after Floyd\u2019s killing, leaders at the Minneapolis Police Department say the officer head count has shrunk from 900 in early 2020 to about 560 in August \u2014 a loss of more than a third of the force.   Against this backdrop, the political pendulum on public-safety matters in this reliably liberal city \u2014 the \u201cMini Apple\u201d hasn\u2019t had a Republican mayor since 1973, and that was for just a single day  \u2014 seems to have swung away from a progressive mindset towards the middle.  And on matters of public safety, the middle is where many of the city\u2019s Black residents already were. Last year, progressives touted a ballot measure that was said to be a referendum on the \u201cdefund\u201d concept. Question 2, as it was known locally, would have replaced the Minneapolis Police Department with a new \u201cpublic health-oriented\u201d Department of Public Safety and removed a minimum staffing requirement from the city charter.  It failed in November, with 56% of voters rejecting it. That figure was 61% in north Minneapolis, a pair of neighboring city wards where Blacks make up a strong plurality of the roughly 66,000 residents. All but one of the 17 precincts in the north voted against the measure. \u201cWe did not believe that the police should be defunded, but we do believe in police reforms,\u201d said Bishop Richard Howell of Shiloh Temple, a north-side church founded more than 90 years ago.  Rae McKay-Anderson \u2014 Telly Blair\u2019s sister \u2014 said \u201cyou can\u2019t possibly defund the police in a way that\u2019s going to benefit the Black community.\u201d Dealing the final blow to the local \u201cdefund\u201d movement last year was a city council vote to essentially refund a cut they\u2019d made the prior year. Mayor Jacob Frey is proposing another budget bump for the next two fiscal years.  The question of the moment is, if the police budget has been restored, and if all the anti-cop shouting by politicians and activists that left officers demoralized has weakened to a whimper, why are citizens \u2014 especially in the rough parts of north Minneapolis \u2014 still feeling neglected by police and fearful for their safety?  A feeling of lawlessness, a sense of neglect  Residents of the north side describe a landscape that can feel lawless. Indeed, about 60% of police calls for shots fired this year have come from the area, even though it makes up just 15% of the population, according to city data. Paul Johnson, 56, said young men openly sell drugs during the day in public places, such as a gas station on Broadway Avenue that has been dubbed the \u201cmurder station\u201d due to all of the fatal shootings there. (It is near the one where Blair was killed.) \u201cYou pull up to get gas \u2013 they try to sell you drugs,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd not just three or four, but it\u2019s a bulk of people.\u201d The perception among many residents is that the police ignore the area. \u201cThey just let it go on,\u201d said Johnson\u2019s friend, Brian Bogan, 42, who said he moved from north Minneapolis to relatively safer St. Paul due to his kids growing up in an area where they don\u2019t know if \u201cit\u2019s fireworks or gunshots.\u201d   While Minneapolis is far from the nation\u2019s most dangerous city, its rate of increase in homicides \u2014 the count in 2021 was about double that of 2019 \u2014 is among the highest in the nation, said Richard Rosenfeld, a criminologist at the University of Missouri- St. Louis and co-author of an annual study on crime trends. On per-capita murders, it has ranked fairly high \u2014 19th out of 70 jurisdictions in the US \u2014 during the first half of this year, according to the Major Cities Chiefs Association. The city ranked even higher on other per-capita crime measures, such as robbery (4th), rape (8th) and aggravated assault (13th). Juliee Oden, 56, can\u2019t even count the times she has called 911 to report gunfire outside her north-side home. One night last summer, a volley of shots jolted her out of bed while she was watching TV \u2014 it was coming from her front lawn. \u201cI hit the floor,\u201d she said. \u201cMy phone went flying. I had to crawl on my stomach to get to the phone\u201d to dial 911. It got to the point where it was hard to sleep at night and Oden, who works at a construction company, had colleagues install a bulletproof panel behind the headboard of her bed.  \u201cNow I go in my room with complete confidence,\u201d she said. \u201cIf somebody is to shoot directly at my house, I know: As long as I\u2019m behind my headboard, I\u2019m 100% safe.\u201d Oden was among eight residents in north Minneapolis who filed a lawsuit in the summer of 2020 calling on the city to replenish the police department by filling vacant positions. The suit singled out city council members who supported the \u201cradical \u2018dismantle the police\u2019\u201d idea and accused them and Mayor Frey of creating a \u201chostile\u201d environment for the police. It was largely upheld by a state Supreme Court decision this summer \u2014 meaning the city needs to staff up to at least 731 police officers. Doug Seaton, an attorney representing the eight residents, said the successful suit was filed in direct response to how progressive city council members had embraced the \u201cdefund\u201d idea. It demoralized the police department and ultimately led to a mass exodus of officers, he said. \u201cThat is, we think, the major reason that crime has spiked throughout the city and hasn\u2019t gone away yet,\u201d Seaton said. Meanwhile, as the MPD headcount has shrunk, wait times have grown for people who call 911 to report serious \u201cpriority 1\u201d incidents, which can include shots fired, robberies, assaults and mental health crises. Average 911 response times jumped the very month of Floyd\u2019s death \u2014 May of 2020 \u2014 from around 10 or 11 minutes early that year to 14 minutes, according to public records obtained by CNN. They kept rising in 2021 to 16 minutes; response times in the north side\u2019s fourth precinct last year actually surpassed 17 minutes, where they remain.   Some nights are so busy that the dispatchers are directed to hold all non-priority-1 calls citywide; these would include reports of property damage, suspicious persons or theft. That happened during a frenetic five-hour stretch on the night of September 8, when officers responded to multiple shootings and calls for shots fired \u2014 many of them in north Minneapolis; one near the \u201cmurder station\u201d \u2014 that left two dead and seven wounded. The Minneapolis Police Department has even flatly refused to respond to certain crimes in a timely manner. One couple who run a property management business recently took it upon themselves to investigate the theft of their van, box truck and tools by a culprit who brought the stolen goods into a homeless encampment on the north side, according to local news reports. Police told KARE 11 that the hostility towards police on the part of some encampment dwellers compels them to take a slower approach when investigating property crimes there. But by and large, police officials have said the slower response times are the expected byproduct of a depleted force that has witnessed an overwhelming wave of retirements, resignations and disability leaves due to post-traumatic stress. Much of that exodus owes to a bottoming out of morale in the wake of a crisis that left police officers feeling reviled, said interim Minneapolis Police Chief Amelia Huffman. \u201cThere\u2019s really been a very fundamental challenge to our sense of purpose in law enforcement,\u201d Huffman said of the post-Floyd era. \u201c(Minneapolis) is the eye of the storm. So all of those challenges and the pressure is magnified, you know, a hundred fold \u2013 a thousand fold.\u201d Similar headcount plunges have plagued police departments from coast to coast.  Some law enforcement officials have attributed the mass resignations and retirements to pandemic-related reasons, but Sgt. Betsy Brantner Smith of the National Police Association said morale is a major factor. \u201cIt\u2019s no secret that law enforcement \u2026 especially in the last two and a half years, has been badly vilified and wrongly vilified,\u201d she told CNN. \u201cYou can\u2019t call an entire profession racist and expect people to just sit back and say, okay, you know, keep piling on.\u201d  In June, the embattled Minneapolis department was hit with more bad press \u2014 this time for its abysmal numbers on unsolved murders in recent years. Since 2016, the clearance rate (or the percentage of homicide cases closed) in Minneapolis sank from around 54% \u2014 the most recent national average \u2014 to 38% in 2020, according to the latest available data from the FBI. Figures for last year haven\u2019t been released by the FBI, but Huffman insists the rate has improved considerably, claiming that the unofficial figure for this year to date is back to 54%.  Even so, some family members of murder victims say they have felt compelled to take a lead role in the homicide investigations of their own loved ones. Residents take matters into their own hands Among them is Dorothy Royston, a 26-year-old healthcare professional who said she spent weeks proactively feeding police information shortly after her unarmed younger brother, Charles Royston Jr., was gunned down on a snowy street in north Minneapolis on a January night in 2021, according to police reports.  \u201cThey had a lot of the information or the logistics of what was \u2013 like bullet casings and stuff like that,\u201d Dorothy said. \u201cBut when it comes to who was involved with the actual shooting, who was around \u2013 and the people information? I actually provided that to the police.\u201d Dorothy provided CNN with text messages between her and a lead investigator on the case. In February of 2021, the investigator told her in a message that there would be a warrant out for the arrest of a suspect by the next day. He still hasn\u2019t been arrested, Dorothy said.  She said communications from the investigator fell off around March of 2021. A couple months ago, about a year and a half after the killing, Dorothy said, she called the investigator to ask for an update.  \u201cHe told me that he was currently doing something and that he would call me back,\u201d she said. \u201cHe never called me back.\u201d (The investigator agreed to talk with CNN, but a police spokesperson called off the interview. ) Taken together, the current state of crime and policing in Minneapolis \u2014 from slow response times to recent brutality complaints to the poor clearance rates \u2014 has fostered an atmosphere of distrust.  The distrust paves the way for some to assume bad intentions. Dave Bicking, a board member of the Minneapolis-based Community United Against Police Brutality, goes so far as to suggest the police since Floyd\u2019s death may have engaged in a \u201csickout\u201d \u2014 that is, that officers are purposefully sluggish to respond to or investigate certain crimes. \u201cIt\u2019s still going on to a considerable extent \u2014 it was dramatic in the beginning,\u201d Bicking told CNN. \u201cThe police would simply, if they showed up at all, say, \u2018Oh, we don\u2019t have anybody to deal with that,\u2019 or \u2018You people don\u2019t want us here, so we\u2019re not going to do anything.\u2019\u201d  Bicking, who has been publicly critical of the \u201cdefund\u201d tactic from the get-go, said he bases the sickout claim on a drop-off in jail bookings shortly after Floyd\u2019s death and on more than 2,300 interviews the CUAPB has conducted over the past year and a half with Minneapolis residents about their experiences with the MPD.  He added that the CUAPB persuaded the Department of Justice to include in its investigation of the MPD the alleged lack of Minneapolis police investigations into murders of people of color.  Chief Huffman did not respond to follow-up questions related to sickout allegations, but in her earlier interview with CNN she said Minneapolis has unique challenges. For one, she said, Minneapolis has a relatively low rate of domestic murders, which are typically easier to solve, and a high rate of gang murders, which are more difficult. But the bigger factor again comes down to attrition. Huffman said the Minneapolis Police Department has lost about 100 investigators in its investigations bureau since early 2020.  Still, Huffman said the MPD is committed to solving homicides, adding that unsolved murders can have serious negative repercussions that ripple through communities for years and devastate families.   \u201cThe lack of justice for families who have had family members murdered is completely unacceptable,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s incumbent on us to make sure that we\u2019re doing everything we can to solve those cases.\u201d Huffman\u2019s new boss, Cedric Alexander \u2014 who was hired in August as the city\u2019s first ever community safety commissioner \u2014 said he understands the community\u2019s frustration.  \u201cWhen you have a body drop and another body drops and another body drops, what you have oftentimes is ongoing violence \u2013 it certainly does overwhelm an agency that already is struggling with a great deal of shortages,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cIt does give people the perception nothing is being done. But I can assure you that it is. And in any of these violent cases where we have victims, it is taken at a very high priority.\u201d How \u2018defund\u2019 failed In June of 2020, nine of the Minneapolis City Council\u2019s 13 members stood on a stage adorned with an oversized sign saying \u201cDEFUND POLICE.\u201d Around the same time, in another spectacle that made national news, Mayor Frey was booed and jeered by activists at a George Floyd protest near his home for saying \u2014 in response to a question \u2014 that he did not support \u201cthe full abolition of police.\u201d As he walked away, the crowd broke into a \u201cGo home Jacob!\u201d chant.  \u201cIt was a lonely walk,\u201d Frey told CNN recently. \u201cAt that moment there was a very loud chorus of people, including elected officials \u2026 that were all calling very loudly to defund the police.\u201d  It\u2019s well established that those widely viewed events boosted a movement in Minneapolis that would later fail at the polls last November. Lesser known is how the very community most directly impacted by crime and policing in the city \u2014 the north side \u2014 was among the least supportive of the \u201cdefund\u201d idea. \u201cI think what\u2019s at issue is the White progressives\u2019 belief that they\u2019re helping us,\u201d said Lisa Clemons, a former Minneapolis police officer, who is Black and runs a gun-violence organization called A Mother\u2019s Love in north Minneapolis.  \u201cOftentimes they are hurting us.\u201d Clemons said people in north Minneapolis don\u2019t want to get rid of cops \u2013 \u201cthey just want respectful cops.\u201d   Minneapolis voters not only resoundingly rejected what was seen as the \u201cdefund\u201d initiative, they also voted to strengthen the office of the mayor and reelected Frey, who\u2019d become a local avatar for moderate Democrats put off by the party\u2019s most liberal wing. The Minneapolis area with the largest Black population \u2014 Ward 5 on the north side \u2014 also proved a strong base of support for Frey in his reelection, according to a CNN analysis of voter data.  Frey said that while no demographic group is a monolith, White progressives in the aftermath of Floyd\u2019s death often seemed out of sync with ordinary Black residents.  \u201cI heard a lot of White activists purport to be speaking on behalf of communities of color. And I was listening to them \u2014  listening to communities of color \u2014 and they weren\u2019t saying the same things,\u201d Frey said. \u201cI\u2019d walk down the street and I\u2019d hear from White people, \u2018Defund the police! Defund the police!\u2019 And then I\u2019d hear from a Black person a half block later, \u2018Hey, we really need to have some additional help.\u2019\u201d  Sheila Nezhad, a community organizer who turned out to be one of Frey\u2019s most competitive mayoral opponents in November, noted that turnout was lower in north Minneapolis than the citywide average, and that the advocacy group \u2014 called Yes 4 Minneapolis \u2014 that proposed the ballot measure that came to be seen as the \u201cdefund\u201d referendum was led by Black people. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not White,\u201d she said. \u201cSo when Jacob Frey talks about only White people want to defund or whatever \u2026 I think that he is perhaps shaping the narrative to benefit his political goals.\u201d Even before Floyd\u2019s killing, the MPD had drawn criticism for its approach to policing the Black community. In 2016, anti-police protests erupted after it was announced that two Minneapolis officers involved in the shooting death of Jamar Clark \u2013 a 24-year-old Black man who scuffled with the officers and, according to authorities, reached for one of their guns \u2014 would not be charged. Two years later, after responding to calls of a man shooting a gun in the air, police chased and fatally shot 31-year-old Thurman Blevins, who said \u201cplease don\u2019t shoot me\u201d as he ran away from them; body cameras showed officers yelling at him to drop his gun. Police say Blevins turned with his gun toward the officers, who ultimately were not charged. And then came May 25, 2020. In a nine-minute video that seemed to last an eternity, a police officer defiantly knelt on the neck of a handcuffed, face-down Floyd, whose pleas for help went unanswered until he fell silent. Now infamous, the officer, Derek Chauvin \u2013 who\u2019d already had 18 prior complaints filed against him \u2013 was convicted of Floyd\u2019s murder and sentenced to 21 years in federal prison.   \u201cFor me, it was a moment of deep grief,\u201d said Nezhad, who still wants to abolish the Minneapolis Police Department. \u201cAnd the days that followed offered a glimpse into just how ready so many people are for massive change.\u201d In April, the Minnesota Department of Human Rights released a report, two years in the making, charging that the Minneapolis department\u2019s officers have engaged in a pattern or practice of race discrimination when conducting traffic stops or using force. It called for ordering a consent decree, which is essentially a court-enforced settlement to reform the department. The report also blasted the MPD for \u201cineffective accountability,\u201d saying that \u201calmost every investigation of a police misconduct complaint against an MPD officer \u2026 is assessed or guided by sworn MPD officers.\u201d   The city is in negotiations with the human rights department over the consent decree, and Frey has indicated that some of his budget priorities are in direct response to the report. Don Samuels \u2014 a former Minneapolis City Councilman who surprised political observers this summer by nearly defeating US Rep. Ilhan Omar, an icon of progressive politics in America \u2014 said the video of Floyd\u2019s death was the most \u201cevil thing I had ever seen.\u201d  \u201cThat was so painful \u2014 just painful to watch and to see a Black man, of dark complexion, under the knee of a dispassionate White male,\u201d Samuels said. \u201cIt conjured up all kinds of slavery imagery.\u201d And yet, Samuels, a 73-year-old immigrant from Jamaica \u2014 who lives in one of the most dangerous neighborhoods of north Minneapolis \u2014 experienced another kind of dismay when he saw the nine council members on the Defund stage while watching the news on TV with his wife.   \u201cIt was like a World Trade Center moment for us,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cOur jaws fell to the floor. Literally, we were aghast. We looked at each other and said, \u2018Oh, my God. It\u2019s going to be Crime City in Minneapolis.\u2019\u201d  That summer, Samuels joined the residents of north Minneapolis who sued the city for its police shortage. Half of the plaintiffs are Black.  During his campaign for Congress, Samuels ran a kind of middle-ground campaign on public safety. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to choose safety or police \u2013 we can have both/and,\u201d Samuels said at a town hall campaign event in August. \u201cLet\u2019s get rid of the bad police, let\u2019s fix the fixable police.\u201d He lost, but the \u201cboth/and\u201d approach appears to be the current path that the city of Minneapolis is on.  \u2018Both-and\u2019: A post-Defund approach  On a morning this August, in a scene that offered a sharp contrast from two years ago \u2014 when Mayor Frey made his \u201clonely walk\u201d through an angry crowd \u2014 he and Commissioner Alexander, both smartly dressed, strode triumphantly through corridors of City Hall.  Alexander, a 67-year-old former deputy sheriff with a doctorate in psychology who was hand-picked by Frey, had just been confirmed as the city\u2019s community safety commissioner in a contentious council meeting. His newly created position amounts to the first piece of Frey\u2019s proposed plan to combine 911, police, fire, neighborhood safety and emergency management under one roof.    \u201cThe number one, first priority is the fact that people in this community don\u2019t feel that they\u2019re safe,\u201d said Alexander \u2014 who served on the 21st Century Task Force on Policing under former President Barack Obama \u2014 during an impromptu press conference minutes after his hiring. \u201cThe fact is that we have violent crime that\u2019s occurring, and occurring way too frequently.\u201d Alexander, who retired in 2017 as the public safety director in DeKalb County, Georgia, in the metro Atlanta area, added that the MPD isn\u2019t likely to become fully staffed overnight \u2014 \u201cprobably not even in our careers\u201d \u2014 and stressed the importance of data-driven policing and building relationships.  \u201cIf we don\u2019t build relationships with these people in our communities, you ain\u2019t solving crime nowhere,\u201d said Alexander, a former CNN contributor on law enforcement issues. Osler, the St. Thomas professor, said at the moment, people don\u2019t want to work for the MPD, \u201cwhere officers are not respected. And to be straight-up about it, MPD earned that lack of respect.\u201d In the meantime, he said, the department needs to focus on two key metrics: improving homicide clearance rates and executing search warrants for violent criminals, which, Osler acknowledged, is no easy feat. \u201cThink about it from the perspective of the person executing that warrant,\u201d Osler said. \u201cYou\u2019re going to bust down the door and who you know is on the other side is someone who\u2019s probably already shot somebody. That\u2019s a tough job. No wonder people don\u2019t want to do it.\u201d  On the policy front, the wheels of change seem to be grinding forward, however slowly.  Since Gov. Tim Walz signed a police accountability law two years ago that banned chokeholds and \u201cwarrior\u201d style police training, the city of Minneapolis appears to be finding a path forward that avoids having to choose between building the police force and reimagining public safety. The city is not only looking at further beefing up the police budget but is also piloting a slate of programs that send unarmed responders to nonviolent 911 calls. Mayor Frey has proposed making them permanent in his recommended budget for 2023-2024. Frey argues that the centerpiece of his proposed public safety plan \u2013 creating a new Office of Community Safety \u2014 captures much of what the \u201cdefund\u201d movement was after in the first place. The concept is to \u201cmatch the best possible people with what is actually being experienced on the street,\u201d Frey said. \u201cAnybody who was for that before but is not for it now is pretty disingenuous.\u201d  When it comes to hiring, the MPD is trying to entice young blood with incentives \u2014 for instance by covering the cost of tuition for potential recruits who need law-enforcement coursework but only have a high school degree.  It\u2019s a big challenge \u2014 not just because so many officers have left, but also because there is a shortage of young people across the country getting into law enforcement, Alexander said.  The city has made headway when it comes to filling the top job: Frey recently announced three finalists \u2014 all of them from outside Minneapolis \u2014 for the permanent chief position, which Huffman has filled on an interim basis since December. Last summer, the police presence in the city was so thin \u2014 and the rate of violence so high \u2014 that a group of volunteers in the faith community went to heroic measures to break the cycle. The idea was simple. In an initiative called 21 Days of Peace, church volunteers simply hung out in some of the most deadly neighborhoods to engage in violence prevention. The effort was considered a success, but for one volunteer it came at a cost. Gloria Howard, a grandmother, had just handed out snow cones to two women with young children at one of the violence hotspots near a liquor store on Broadway Avenue when a barrage of gunfire sent people scattering.  Howard crumpled to the ground. When she tried to get up, she couldn\u2019t \u2014 she\u2019d been shot twice.  People from a nearby church rushed out of the building to render aid and call the police. \u201cWhen I got to the hospital, the doctors were like, \u2018Well, you\u2019re some lucky lady and you must be somebody special because you have no metal fragments in your body,\u2019\u201d Howard said. The bullets, she said, \u201cwent through and through.\u201d  Howard, who was against the \u201cdefund\u201d initiative, said there are specific reforms she would like to see, starting with a push to require more officers to live in the city they serve. (A 2017 Star Tribune report found that just 8% of MPD officers lived in Minneapolis. Chauvin lived in the suburb of Oakdale, where nearly 72% of the residents are White.) \u201cAll Black men are not big and scary,\u201d Howard said. \u201cAll Black women are not angry. So, you know, you have to be able to know the community.\u201d But she realizes that even with such reforms, improvement would take time. \u201cI don\u2019t even walk Broadway anymore,\u201d Howard said, while eying the thoroughfare from a distance, close to where she was shot. \u201cI\u2019ve seen the cars speeding up and down when they\u2019re chasing each other. And then when they start shooting, it can come from anywhere. So I don\u2019t even do that anymore.  And I never used to be afraid coming over here.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2022/09/25/us/minneapolis-crime-defund-invs/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_18_us_club-q-shooter-hate-crime-sentencing", "text": "The shooter who opened fire in a Colorado LGBTQ+ nightclub in 2022, killing five people and injuring 19, was sentenced in federal court Tuesday to life in prison without the possibility of parole plus 190 years. The sentence came after Anderson Lee Aldrich pleaded guilty to 74 federal hate crime charges and gun charges in connection with the shooting. Prosecutors chose not to pursue the death penalty in the case, and the US Department of Justice announced in January it had reached a plea agreement with Aldrich. US District Judge Charlotte Sweeney handed down the sentence after hearing from the victims\u2019 families and survivors of the shooting, many of whom were disappointed Aldrich would not face a capital sentence. \u201cFueled by hate, the defendant targeted members of the LGBTQIA+ community at a place that represented belonging, safety, and acceptance \u2013 stealing five people from their loved ones, injuring 19 others, and striking fear across the country,\u201d said Attorney General Merrick B. Garland in a statement after the sentencing. Sweeney, the first LGBTQ+ federal judge to serve in Colorado, did not have the discretion to impose a different sentence, she told them, citing the plea agreement. But she emphasized the importance of Aldrich\u2019s decision to plead guilty: In doing so, she said, Aldrich admitted to carrying out the attack because of the victims\u2019 \u201cactual or perceived gender identity or sexual orientation.\u201d \u201cThis community is stronger than your armor, stronger than your weapons and stronger than your hatred,\u201d she told Aldrich, noting she was sentencing him during Pride Month. Aldrich, 24, is already serving five consecutive life terms and an additional 2,212 years without the possibility of parole at the Wyoming State Penitentiary after pleading guilty in 2023 to state charges for the attack, which targeted one of the few LGBTQ+ spaces in Colorado Springs, fostering a safe and inclusive atmosphere in a conservative community. \u201cI loved that place,\u201d Ashtin Gamblin, who was shot nine times and survived, said during her victim impact statement prior to sentencing. While she is not a member of the LGBTQ+ community, Gamblin said, she is an ally. \u201cI loved everybody there,\u201d she said, crediting Club Q\u2019s bar supervisor, Daniel Aston, with saving her life before he was killed. Aside from Aston, Derrick Rump, another Club Q employee, was also killed, as well as Ashley Paugh, Kelly Loving and Raymond Green Vance. Many of those who testified Tuesday expressed anger for the shooter, and the pain Aldrich caused them or their families. Aldrich \u2013 who appeared in court in an orange prison uniform \u2013 was largely expressionless, or nodded while listening to the statements. \u201cYou took my only sibling,\u201d said Stephanie Clark, Paugh\u2019s sister, who also testified at Aldrich\u2019s state sentencing. \u201cBut I wanted to look you in the eye one more time and tell you I will never forgive you, nor will my family,\u201d Clark said. \u201cYou don\u2019t deserve that.\u201d Wyatt Kent, who performed as a drag queen the night of the shooting, said it was difficult to prepare this statement during Pride Month, but pointed to the resilience of the LGBTQ+ community. \u201cI forgive you,\u201d Kent said. \u201cWe, the queer community, we are the resilient ones. We continue to hold that beauty within each other. We continue to find joy in the trauma and in the pain.\u201d \u201cUnfortunately,\u201d Kent said, \u201cthose are things you will never experience for the rest of your life.\u201d A \u2018brazen and calculated\u2019 attack In a sentencing statement submitted to the court prior to Tuesday\u2019s hearing, the Justice Department called the shooting a \u201cbrazen and calculated\u201d attack on the club\u2019s employees and patrons, describing it as a \u201cbias-motivated, premeditated, mass-casualty attack.\u201d Aldrich began the massacre at the club as patrons were gathering for Transgender Day of Remembrance, for which Club Q had scheduled a weekend of events, including a drag show. The shooter spent more than $9,000 buying weapons and visited the club several times before, becoming familiar with the layout, according to the sentencing document. Aldrich had expressed an open hatred for the LGBTQ+ community and had indicated an interest in mass shootings before, the document said. Then, in the late hours of November 19, 2022, the then-22-year-old entered the club carrying an AR-15 style assault rifle and began \u201cfiring at everyone in sight,\u201d according to the sentencing document. Some patrons hid or played dead as Aldrich moved though the club, shooting indiscriminately. The violence came to an end when an army veteran took down the shooter, aided by a Navy petty officer and a drag performer at the club. The shooting provided an echo of the devastating 2016 shooting at Pulse, an LGBTQ+ nightclub in Orlando, Florida, which left 49 people dead. Several victims who were shot but survived have required surgery for their injuries and continue to face medical challenges, including loss of mobility and post-traumatic stress disorder. For Colorado Springs\u2019 queer community, the mass shooting was traumatic. The club served as a crucial safe haven for people from a variety of backgrounds living in a conservative stronghold. One trans man who worked as a drag king at Club Q told CNN after the shooting, \u201cOur safety as queer people in Colorado Springs is now questioned. I\u2019m scared to be myself as a trans man in this community.\u201d Aldrich has faced heavy sentencing for the brutal attack: The 2023 sentence was the second-longest ever given in Colorado, behind only the 2012 Aurora theater mass shooting, according to the district attorney. This\u00a0story\u00a0has been updated with additional information. Correction: A previous version of this story misstated the status of Anderson Lee Aldrich\u2019s plea. The shooter agreed in January to plead guilty to federal charges stemming from the Club Q shooting.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/18/us/club-q-shooter-hate-crime-sentencing/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "us"}}

Strain\u2019s body was found in the Cumberland River in West Nashville on the morning of March 22, several miles from where he had gone missing. The 22-year-old University of Missouri student had been in town on a weekend trip two weeks earlier when he was kicked out of a bar, authorities said. The Metropolitan Nashville Police Department said the autopsy, released Tuesday, corroborates the findings of their missing person detectives, and the department is now officially classifying Strain\u2019s death as accidental. The autopsy report said Strain\u2019s blood alcohol level was 0.228, which is almost three times the legal driving limit. The cannabis compound Delta-9 THC was also found in his system, the report said. Police found Strain had consumed \u201cmultiple alcoholic drinks\u201d at different establishments in Nashville, became separated from his friends and was \u201cnoticeably impaired\u201d as he walked onto Gay Street, adjacent to the Cumberland River on the night of March 8. Detectives concluded Strain, unfamiliar with the terrain and walking in the dark, stepped toward an overgrown area and fell down the steep embankment leading to the river and into the water. Due to recent rain, the river was very high that night with a swift current, police said. \u201cThe MNPD continues to extend its heartfelt condolences to Riley Strain\u2019s family and friends,\u201d their statement added.

The complaint was first reported Wednesday by NBC. CNN has not viewed the complaint and could not independently verify the details included in the NBC report. Airbnb disputed Hernandez\u2019s claims, saying that it continues to enforce against members of dangerous or extremist organizations. \u201cContrary to these baseless and inaccurate allegations, we have actually expanded the remit of our team\u00a0to detect and remove users who pose safety risk\u00a0and this year we\u2019ve hired additional team members to support the enforcement of this policy,\u201d a spokesperson said in a statement.\u00a0\u201cAs an online platform that\u00a0facilitates millions of real-world interactions globally,\u00a0we have robust policies, processes, and teams across the company focusing on promoting community safety, including preventing unsafe users from using the platform.\u201d Airbnb touts more than 5 million hosts who list space on the room- and home-rental platform. In the first three months of 2024 alone, Airbnb facilitated the booking of more than 132 million nights and \u201cexperiences,\u201d non-overnight offerings such as walking tours. The whistleblower complaint comes as Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky has for years tried to quell safety concerns over a business that is, at its heart, strangers staying in the homes of other strangers. Those efforts have included crackdowns on parties, resources for solo female travelers and a ban on indoor security cameras. Airbnb in 2016 asked members to sign a commitment that they would \u201caccept people regardless of their race, religion, national origin, ethnicity, disability, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, or age\u201d in order to host or make a booking on the platform. And in the following years, it pointed to that pledge when removing users associated with extremist organizations. In 2017, the company removed some accounts and canceled bookings associated with the Unite the Right White nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. And in 2021, months after the January 6 attack, Airbnb said it had removed \u201cnumerous individuals\u201d who had been identified as having \u201cparticipated in the violent criminal activity at the US Capitol.\u201d It added that it had canceled reservations in the Washington DC metro area during inauguration week in response to calls from local and federal officials. But in 2023, Airbnb came under fire by conservative media for removing the parents of far-right activist Lauren Southern from the platform; the company quickly reversed the removal, calling it a \u201cmistake.\u201d Southern, a far-right Canadian YouTube personality, had criticized her parents\u2019 removal from the platform on social media and later in an appearance on Fox News. Around the same time, Hernandez claims that Airbnb made the dangerous organizations team\u2019s work slower and more complicated, requiring proposed removals to be reviewed by legal, communications and community policy departments leaders, according to NBC, which said it received Hernandez\u2019s 161-page complaint from an anonymous source on Capitol Hill. \u201cOur hands were tied \u2014 we weren\u2019t removing people,\u201d Hernandez told NBC. Prior to her work at Airbnb, Hernandez worked as a researcher for the Terrorism Research and Analysis Consortium, an organization that tracks terrorist and hate groups, according to Whistleblower Aid.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/19/tech/airbnb-whistleblower-complaint-dangerous-organizations-team/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "us"}}

We are not going to need a draft anytime soon,\u201d Republican Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi told CNN, while arguing Washington shouldn\u2019t be distracted right now from its most important responsibility, which is standing up to urgent threats from international foes. At issue is a proposal championed by Rep. Chrissy Houlahan, a Democrat from Pennsylvania and veteran of the Air Force, who pushed to add to the House\u2019s version of the National Defense Authorization Act language requiring men to be automatically registered for the draft based on existing federal records instead of registering themselves when they turn 18.\u00a0Doing so could increase compliance and save money that is now used for outreach efforts to encourage men to register voluntarily. The House NDAA passed out of committee on a broad 57-1 vote. It passed the full House on a more party line 217-199 vote. Sen. Jack Reed, a Democrat of Rhode Island, who chairs the Senate Armed Services Committee, said he was only \u201cvaguely aware\u201d of the House proposal but said it might be worth doing. \u201cI think that is something we have to look at,\u201d he said. \u201cPresumably, if there is some data to show that it\u2019s more efficient way to do it I don\u2019t see a problem with it.\u201d Reed added: \u201cI think that\u2019s in the area that is subject to reasonable debate, which is, is it more efficient? Is it more effective? Will it help us mobilize quickly?\u00a0 Will it keep our records up to date better?\u201d Wicker has recently proposed a massive increase in defense spending starting next year in order to ensure the military is on its best footing.\u00a0He said now is one of the most dangerous times in US history, with conflicts in Europe and the Middle East and as threats loom from Russia, China, Iran and North Korea. \u201cWe ought to concentrate on the crisis.\u00a0 And that is that we are not ready to deter this axis of aggressors from making a foolish mistake with regards to our resolve,\u201d Wicker said.\u00a0 \u201cWe need to concentrate on spending the necessary funds to get us to where we need to be.\u00a0 And there is no need to be talking about a draft right now.\u201d An accompanying issue is whether to require women to register for the draft.\u00a0 The version of the NDAA that passed out of the Senate Armed Services Committee last week amends the Military Selective Service Act requiring women to register for Selective Service. Despite being in the Senate bill, Reed suggested that because of GOP opposition to drafting women, it might not survive when a final version of the bill is negotiated between the GOP-controlled House and Democratic-led Senate. \u201cThat has been a real sore point, that I can\u2019t understand. We have had amendments that would have required women to register and we can\u2019t get any real traction on the other side.\u00a0We are going to try to do it.\u00a0It makes sense. The military now is\u00a0a mixed force,\u201d he said. Wicker gave a one word answer \u2013 \u201cno\u201d \u2013 when asked about adding having women register. But he has spoken out about it in the past. \u201cI applaud the women who volunteer to serve in the military and who sacrifice every day for our country\u2019s freedom, but to compel their service by law is wrong,\u201d Wicker said in 2021 when a similar debate took place. \u201cI along with millions of other Americans cannot support the idea that our daughters and granddaughters would be forced to fight in our next military conflict against their will.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/19/politics/roger-wicker-opposes-military-draft-changes/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2023_06_19_us_juneteenth-federal-holiday-explained-cec", "text": "Despite Juneteenth\u2019s storied history, the holiday was largely overlooked by non-Black Americans until recent years. The momentum of the\u00a0Black Lives Matter\u00a0movement propelled Juneteenth into the national spotlight, building on a decades-long push by activists and leaders to get recognition for the landmark occasion. In 2021, Juneteenth became the\u00a0latest federal holiday\u00a0in the US \u2014 the\u00a0first to be approved\u00a0since Martin Luther King Jr. Day in 1983. With Juneteenth now a national holiday, many public and private sector employees enjoy an extra day off from work while brands and corporations capitalize on the event with celebratory marketing campaigns. But there\u2019s much more to Juneteenth than a long weekend and\u00a0branded products. As Black Americans continue to face the same challenges and inequities that inspired so many to take to the streets in 2020, it\u2019s worth reflecting on the history behind the holiday. Juneteenth marks the end of slavery Juneteenth \u2013 also known as Juneteenth Independence Day, Freedom Day and Emancipation Day \u2013 commemorates the end of slavery in the United States. A blend of the words June and nineteenth, it marks June 19, 1865: the day that Union Army Maj. Gen. Gordon Granger rode into Galveston, Texas, and issued\u00a0General Order No. 3,\u00a0proclaiming that the enslaved African Americans there were free. \u201cThe people of Texas are informed that, in accordance with a proclamation from the Executive of the United States, all slaves are free,\u201d the order read. \u201cThis involves an absolute equality of personal rights and rights of property between former masters and slaves, and the connection heretofore existing between them becomes that between employer and hired labor.\u201d Freedom for the enslaved people of Galveston, Texas, came two-and-a-half years after President Abraham Lincoln issued the\u00a0Emancipation Proclamation, which couldn\u2019t be enforced in areas under Confederate control. It also came about two months after Confederate General Robert E. Lee surrendered to the Union Army at Appomattox Court House, Virginia \u2014 an event generally considered to be the end of the Civil War. How Juneteenth is celebrated What began as an informal celebration of freedom by locals in Galveston eventually grew into a wider commemoration of the end of slavery as African Americans in Texas moved to other parts of the country. Today, many African Americans mark Juneteenth with parties, parades and gatherings with family and friends. Texas became the first state to make Juneteenth a state holiday in 1980. In addition to it being a federal holiday, at least 28 states and Washington, DC, will recognize it as a public holiday this year, according to the Pew Research Center. Other states may commemorate Juneteenth as a day of observance or in some other form. With Juneteenth now part of the mainstream, some activists and\u00a0leaders\u00a0point to the systemic inequities that Black Americans continue to face, such as the racial wealth gap, disproportionate incarceration and longstanding health disparities. One coalition of groups that represent the interests of Black communities, in particular, is acknowledging the holiday by drawing attention to the fight for reparations. As many of those calling for widespread changes suggest, observing Juneteenth might then be an opportunity to reflect on how far the nation has come \u2013 and how much further there is to go.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/06/19/us/juneteenth-federal-holiday-explained-cec/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_19_politics_louisiana-classrooms-ten-commandments", "text": "Louisiana public schools are now required to display the Ten Commandments in all classrooms, after Republican Gov. Jeff Landry signed the requirement into law Wednesday. House Bill 71, approved by state lawmakers last month, mandates that a poster-size display of the Ten Commandments with \u201clarge, easily readable font\u201d be in every classroom at schools that receive state funding, from kindergarten through the university level. The legislation specifies the exact language that must be printed on the classroom displays and outlines that the text of the Ten Commandments must be the central focus of the poster or framed document. Before signing the bill, Landry called it \u201cone of (his) favorites.\u201d \u201cIf you want to respect the rule of law, you gotta start from the original law given which was Moses. \u2026 He got his commandments from God,\u201d Landry said. Opponents of the bill have argued that a state requiring a religious text in all classrooms would violate the establishment clause of the US Constitution, which says that Congress can \u201cmake no law respecting an establishment of religion.\u201d Civil liberties groups swiftly vowed to challenge the law \u2013 which makes Louisiana the first in the nation to require the Ten Commandments be displayed in every classroom that receives state funding \u2013 in court. The American Civil Liberties Union, the American Civil Liberties Union of Louisiana, Americans United for Separation\ufeff of Church and State and the Freedom from Religion Foundation said that the law violates longstanding Supreme Court precedent and the First Amendment and would result in \u201cunconstitutional religious coercion of students.\u201d \u201cThe First Amendment promises that we all get to decide for ourselves what religious beliefs, if any, to hold and practice, without pressure from the government. Politicians have no business imposing their preferred religious doctrine on students and families in public schools,\u201d the groups said in a joint statement. Supporters of the law, in defending the measure, have leaned on the 2022\u00a0US Supreme Court decision in\u00a0Kennedy v. Bremerton School District, which gave a high school football coach his job back after he was disciplined over a controversy involving prayer on the field. The Supreme Court ruled that the coach\u2019s prayers amounted to private speech, protected by the First Amendment, and could not be restricted by the school district. The decision lowered the bar between church and state in an opinion that legal experts predicted would allow more religious expression in public spaces.\u00a0At the time, the court clarified that a government entity does not necessarily violate the establishment clause by permitting religious expression in public. Louisiana state Rep. Dodie Horton, the Republican author of the bill, said at the bill signing that \u201cit\u2019s like hope is in the air everywhere.\u201d Horton has dismissed concerns from Democratic opponents of the measure, saying the Ten Commandments are rooted in legal history and her bill would place a \u201cmoral code\u201d in the classroom.

{"id": "2024_06_19_politics_amy-coney-barrett-clarence-thomas-originalism", "text": "On a Supreme Court where the conservative supermajority increasingly leans on history as a guide, a dispute may be simmering over how many modern cases can be resolved by looking to the nation\u2019s past. Though Justice Clarence Thomas\u2019 decision in a major trademark case last week was unanimous, it prompted a sharp debate led by Justice Amy Coney Barrett over the use of history to decide the case. Barrett, the newest conservative on the court, accused Thomas, the most senior associate justice, of a \u201claser-like focus on the history\u201d that \u201cmisses the forest for the trees.\u201d The back-and-forth could signal a recalibration by some members of the court of how and when\u00a0to apply originalism, the dominant legal doctrine among the court\u2019s conservatives that demands the Constitution be interpreted based on its original meaning. Even a slight change could have enormous consequences for the court\u2019s blockbuster cases, including a pending case that is likely to focus heavily on history to decide whether Americans who are the subject of domestic violence restraining orders can be barred from owning guns. \u201cBarrett\u2019s critique of originalism definitely signals what seems to be a growing rift among the originalists on the court about the proper way to use history,\u201d said Tom Wolf, a constitutional law expert with the liberal-leaning Brennan Center for Justice at New York University\u2019s law school. \u201cThere definitely is the potential formation here of an alternative or several alternative approaches to history that ultimately draw a majority,\u201d Wolf said. A lewd trademark gets historic treatment When the Supreme Court last week rejected a lawyer\u2019s bid to trademark the phrase \u201cTrump Too Small,\u201d all nine justices agreed on the outcome, but strong disagreements arose over the majority\u2019s decision to invoke the nation\u2019s \u201chistory and tradition\u201d to rebuff the trademark. Barrett, who endorsed the court\u2019s conclusion that a provision of federal trademark law barring the registration of an individual\u2019s name without that person\u2019s consent is constitutional, wrote separately to express her displeasure with the reasoning of Thomas\u2019 decision to rely on \u201chistory and tradition.\u201d That route, Barrett argued in a 15-page concurrence, \u201cis wrong twice over.\u201d The court\u2019s three liberals signed on to parts of Barrett\u2019s opinion. Though Barrett acknowledged in her opinion that \u201ctradition has a legitimate role to play in constitutional adjudication,\u201d the Trump nominee said that \u201cthe court\u2019s laser-like focus on the history of this single restriction misses the forest for the trees\u201d and sought to poke holes in the history and tradition-first route taken by Thomas and the other conservative justices who agreed with his legal rationale. The late Justice Antonin Scalia, a leading proponent of originalism on the Supreme Court, once described his approach to interpreting the Constitution as a \u201cpiece of cake.\u201d But the debate playing out this term may be a recognition from some on the court that history is often messy and nuanced in a way that doesn\u2019t always yield easy answers. \u201cWhat we could be seeing is a more nuanced approach to using that history,\u201d said Elizabeth Wydra, president of the progressive Constitutional Accountability Center. \u201cIt\u2019s much more complicated than that \u2013 history is much more contested than that,\u201d Wydra said. \u201cAnd so to have this debate between two conservative justices, I think, brings a lot of light to the discussion.\u201d Several court watchers said it is far too early to read too much into the debate between Thomas and Barrett. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that Barrett thinks tradition is sometimes relevant \u2013 and that she may have some difference with Thomas about when and exactly how much,\u201d said Ilya Somin, a law professor at George Mason University. \u201cBut there\u2019s not really a clear theory here.\u201d The \u2018limits\u2019 of history The court\u2019s approach to history will be closely scrutinized in its blockbuster Second Amendment decision expected in the coming days. In US v. Rahimi, the justices must decide the fate of a federal law that bars people who are the subject of domestic violence retraining orders from owning guns. While a majority of the justices indicated during arguments in November that they will uphold the law, the real challenge for the conservatives will be how to square that decision with a two-year-old precedent that held gun prohibitions must have historical ties to survive under the Second Amendment. In New York State Rifle & Pistol Association, Inc. v. Bruen, Thomas wrote that modern gun laws must be \u201cconsistent with this nation\u2019s historical tradition.\u201d But there were no gun laws on the books at the nation\u2019s founding that dealt explicitly with domestic violence. And so to uphold the federal law, the court will have to likely have to at least explain how that standard applies to modern laws. When Thomas issued his majority decision in Bruen two years ago, Barrett joined Thomas\u2019 opinion in full. But she also penned a brief concurrence to highlight the \u201climits on the permissible use of history\u201d in deciding cases. Among them, she said, was identifying the historical date needed to assess whether a restriction was constitutional. In the months and years following the court\u2019s decision in Bruen, the \u201chistory and tradition\u201d framework has led judges across the US to strike down various gun restrictions while also perplexing some jurists who have noted the obstacles that accompany the new rule. Justice Sonia Sotomayor, too, noted those issues in a concurrence she issued last week in the trademark case. \u201cThe majority attempts to reassure litigants and the lower courts that a \u2018history-focused approac[h]\u2019 here is sensible and workable, by citing \u2026 Bruen,\u201d she wrote. \u201cTo say that such reassurance is not comforting would be an understatement. One need only read a handful of lower court decisions applying Bruen to appreciate the confusion this Court has caused.\u201d The court\u2019s other two liberals signed on to Sotomayor\u2019s concurrence. Barrett did not. History saves banking watchdog Last month, another split emerged in a case involving the funding for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a federal banking watchdog created in response to the 2008 financial meltdown. The payday lending industry sued the agency, claiming that the way Congress set up its funding violated the Constitution\u2019s appropriation clause. Writing for a 7-2 majority, Thomas dived deeply into pre-colonial English history and found that parliament \u2013 even as it tightened its grip on the government\u2019s purse \u2013 did not \u201cmicromanage every aspect of the king\u2019s finances.\u201d The legislature, in other words, gave the king some latitude and that discretion for the executive continued in the early days of the United States. Based on that history, the court upheld the modern agency\u2019s funding. But in a striking concurrence that captured support from both liberal and conservative justices, Justice Elena Kagan asserted that the court\u2019s historic analysis need not end with the late-18th century. Instead, Kagan wrote, the court could look at more modern times \u2013 a \u201ccontinuing tradition\u201d to decide the constitutionality of a government policy. Barrett and Justice Brett Kavanaugh, both members of the court\u2019s conservative wing, joined that analysis, along with Sotomayor \u2013 suggesting that there may be different ways of thinking about history and tradition even among the conservatives who have ushered in that approach to deciding cases. \u201cI see this basically as an evolving dialogue amongst all the justices on the court and some of it is certainly being informed by the aftermath of some really ill-informed and deeply damaging opinions from earlier terms,\u201d said Wolf, pointing to Bruen and the court\u2019s decision two years ago overturning Roe v. Wade. \u201cCertain justices clearly understood the substantive problems with those rulings and also the methods problems with relying on history as dispositive in those cases at the time the court was doing it,\u201d he added. Thomas looks to English courts in trademark fight In the trademark dispute, Vidal v. Elster, Thomas\u2019 legal reasoning for upholding the section of the Lanham Act at issue broke new ground: It was, Sotomayor wrote, the first time the court had taken the history and tradition approach to decide a free speech controversy. Training his sights on the nation\u2019s \u201clong history\u201d of maintaining restrictions on trademarking names, Thomas invoked a series of cases dating as far back as the 19th Century and from courts outside the US. \u201cWe see no evidence that the common law afforded protection to a person seeking a trademark of another living person\u2019s name. To the contrary, English courts recognized that selling a product under another person\u2019s name could be actionable fraud,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThis recognition carried over to our country.\u201d Thomas\u2019 rationale was joined by Kavanaugh, Chief Justice John Roberts, and Justices Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch. But Barrett, Kagan, Sotomayor and Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson parted ways with those five justices. Barrett\u2019s concurrence said the dispute could have been dealt with based on the court\u2019s past precedent with trademark law and stressed that just leaning on the nation\u2019s trademark history wasn\u2019t good enough. \u201cIn my view, the historical record does not alone suffice to demonstrate the clause\u2019s constitutionality,\u201d she wrote. She went on to argue that even though the five-justice majority said it wasn\u2019t creating a new test in its opinion, \u201ca rule rendering tradition dispositive is itself a judge-made test.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/19/politics/amy-coney-barrett-clarence-thomas-originalism/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "us"}}

The \u201cappropriate action now is an aggressive criminal prosecution\u201d against Boeing including a quick jury trial and \u201ccriminal prosecutions of the responsible corporate officials,\u201d including former CEO Dennis Muilenburg, the families\u2019 attorney wrote. \u201cBecause time is of the essence to avoid any statute of limitations from running (out), the Department should begin these prosecutions promptly,\u201d they wrote in the 32-page letter, which was sent by Paul Cassell, an attorney representing the families. The letter also asks the Justice Department for an independent corporate monitor to oversee Boeing\u2019s safety measures and to direct it in its efforts to improve its quality. Boeing did not immediately respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment. In May, the Department of Justice notified Boeing that it had breached terms of\u00a0its\u00a02021 agreement following a January incident in which a\u00a0door plug blew off an Alaska Airlines flight\u00a0shortly after takeoff in January. The Justice Department said in its letter that it has not yet determined how it will proceed and Boeing had the opportunity to respond to its breach of the agreement \u2013 and steps it has taken to remediate the situation \u2013 by last week. The DOJ said it will let the court know by July 7 how it will proceed. Boeing, in a previous statement, said it has upheld its end of the bargain. \u201cWe believe that we have honored the terms of that agreement, and look forward to the opportunity to respond to the Department on this issue,\u201d the company said. \u201cAs we do so, we will engage with the Department with the utmost transparency, as we have throughout the entire term of the agreement.\u201d On Tuesday, current Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun testified before both Republican and Democratic senators. He apologized to families of victims of the two 737 Max crashes that took place before he became CEO and admitted that Boeing is \u201cfar from perfect.\u201d He also acknowledged that the company has a lot of work to do to regain public trust. The 2021 deferred prosecution agreement that Boeing reached with the Justice Department was harshly criticized by the family members and some members of Congress at that time. Boeing agreed to pay $2.5 billion, but most of that money - $1.77 billion \u2013 was paid to the airlines that owned the grounded planes, money that Boeing had already agreed to pay. It also agreed to set up a $500 million fund to compensate family members, which it had also already agreed to do in the face of lawsuits, and it would have paid a $244 million fine to the federal government. The $24 billion, as significant as it would be, would still be less than the $31.9 billion in core operating losses it has reported since the second crash of the plane in 2019 resulted in a 20-month grounding of its best-selling jet. Boeing has identified more than $20 billion in direct costs from that grounding, and that doesn\u2019t count the tens of billions in lost sales revenue and increased interest costs as its debt soared to cover its losses. Nor does it include the costs incurred since the January 5 Alaska Airlines incident in which a door plug blew off a 737 Max and the FAA put limits on its rate of production due to new questions about the safety and quality of its planes. \u2013CNN\u2019s Evan Perez contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/19/business/boeing-families-lawsuit/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "us"}}

That banner with a bursting star in the middle is the Juneteenth Flag, a symbolic representation of the end of slavery in the United States. The flag is the brainchild of activist Ben Haith, founder of the National Juneteenth Celebration Foundation (NJCF). Haith created the flag in 1997 with the help of collaborators, and Boston-based illustrator Lisa Jeanne Graf brought their vision to life. The flag was revised in 2000 into the version we know today, according to the National Juneteenth Observation Foundation. Seven years later, the date \u201cJune 19, 1865\u201d was added, commemorating the day that Union Army Maj. Gen. Gordon Granger rode into Galveston, Texas, and told enslaved African Americans of their emancipation. For more than two decades, communities around the country have held flag-raising ceremonies on Juneteenth in celebration of their freedom. \u201cThis country has so many aspects to it that are spiritual, and I believe this flag is of that nature,\u201d Haith said. \u201cIt (the idea for the design) just came through me.\u201d Designing the flag and its symbols was a deliberate process, Haith said. Here\u2019s what each element of the flag represents. The star  The white star in the center of the flag has a dual meaning, Haith said. For one, it represents Texas, the Lone Star State. It was in Galveston in 1865 where Union soldiers informed the country\u2019s  last remaining enslaved people that, under the Emancipation Proclamation issued two years earlier, they were free. But the star also goes beyond Texas, representing the freedom of African Americans in all 50 states. The burst  The bursting outline around the star is inspired by a nova, a term that astronomers use to mean a new star. On the Juneteenth flag, this represents a new beginning for the African Americans of Galveston and throughout the land. The arc  The curve that extends across the width of the flag represents a new horizon: the opportunities and promise that lay ahead for Black Americans. The colors  The red, white and blue represents the American flag, a reminder that slaves and their descendants were and are Americans.  June 19, 1865, represents the day that enslaved Black people in Galveston, Texas, became Americans under the law. And while African Americans today are still fighting for equality and justice, Haith said those colors symbolize the continuous commitment of people in the United States to do better \u2013 and to live up to the American ideal of liberty and justice for all.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2022/06/17/us/juneteenth-flag-meaning-explainer-cec/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "us"}}

Assamad Nash, 27, pleaded guilty to one count of second-degree murder and first-degree burglary as a sexually motivated felony in connection with the killing of Christina Yuna Lee, who was found dead in her Chinatown apartment on February 13, 2022, having been stabbed at least 40 times, the DA\u2019s office said. \u201cToday Assamad Nash was held accountable for senselessly taking Christina Yuna Lee\u2019s life after he followed her into her own home,\u201d Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg said in a statement Tuesday. \u201cMs. Yuna Lee\u2019s family and loved ones were deprived of a daughter, sister, and friend. My thoughts are with her family and our community as they continue healing from this tragedy.\u201d Nash is expected to be sentenced to 30 years to life in state prison during his sentencing hearing, which is scheduled for July 30, the DA\u2019s office said. CNN has reached out to Nash\u2019s attorney for comment. Last May, Lee\u2019s family filed a lawsuit against members of the New York City Police Department and New York City, claiming delays in police assistance and medical care ultimately led to her death. The NYPD did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment on the litigation. New York City\u2019s law department previously said it was reviewing the complaint. Family lawsuit alleges wrongful death, negligence The lawsuit, filed in New York County Supreme Court on May 12, states unnamed members of the NYPD \u201cunlawfully failed to prevent the assault and battery on Ms. Lee or denied and/or delayed providing medical care to Ms. Lee, leading to her pain, suffering and death.\u201d The complaint was filed by Lee\u2019s aunt, acting as her estate\u2019s administrator, and also named the city as a defendant. Around 4:21 a.m. on February 13, 2022, Lee was followed by a man who forced entry into her apartment, according to the lawsuit. At least one neighbor called police a few moments later after hearing her screams, the complaint states. Two NYPD officers arrived at Lee\u2019s apartment door around 4:25 a.m. and heard her yelling for help, according to the complaint. Her screams abruptly stopped, and the officers then spoke with the man through a closed door, the lawsuit says. \u201cDespite having reason to believe Ms. Lee\u2019s life was in imminent danger, (the two NYPD officers) failed to gain entry to Ms. Lee\u2019s apartment or otherwise provide her with any potentially life-saving police or medical assistance at that time,\u201d the complaint states. Other NYPD officials did not arrive on scene until about an hour later, despite the police precinct being approximately three blocks away, according to the lawsuit. \u201cAt approximately 5:40 A.M., one hour and twenty minutes after Ms. Lee was first attacked, members of the NYPD Emergency Services Unit forced entry into Ms. Lee\u2019s apartment,\u201d the complaint says. The complaint details nine causes of action, including wrongful death, negligence, denial or delay of medical care and violations of the state constitution. The family is seeking a jury trial, punitive damages against the defendants and unspecified compensatory damages. The lawsuit also accuses the city of failing to address public safety concerns in a park located across the street from Lee\u2019s apartment, citing a separate stabbing death that occurred near the park a few months before Lee\u2019s death.

{"id": "2024_06_18_us_lausd-cell-phone-ban-students", "text": "Students in the nation\u2019s second-largest school district will no longer be able to use cell phones during the school day after the Los Angeles Unified School District\u2019s board voted 5-2 in favor of the ban Tuesday. The move highlights a frustration shared by educators across the country. In the United States, 72% of high school teachers said cell phone distraction \u201cis a major problem in the classroom,\u201d according to a report last week by the Pew Research Center. The Los Angeles ban, which will take effect by the spring 2025 semester, goes beyond the school district\u2019s existing policy, which bans students from using cell phones during class instruction and limits social media use at school to \u201ceducational purposes.\u201d That policy took effect in 2011. Since then, smartphone use has exploded \u2013 both inside and outside the classroom. And students\u2019 addiction to their phones has hurt their socialization, their mental health and their academic success, board member\u00a0Nick Melvoin said. \u201cOur students are glued to their cell phones \u2013 not unlike adults,\u201d said Melvoin, a sponsor of the new ban. \u201cThey\u2019re surreptitiously scrolling in school, in class time. They have their head in their hands walking down the hallways. They\u2019re not talking to each other or playing at lunch or recess because they have their AirPods in.\u201d Research suggests \u201cexcessive cell phone use impacts adolescents mental health and well-being and is associated with increased stress, anxiety, depression, sleep issues, feelings of aggression, and suicidal thoughts,\u201d board members supporting the ban wrote. In addition, \u201cResearch indicates that limiting cell phone usage and social media access during the school day increases academic performance and has positive effects on student mental health,\u201d the proponents said. Questions remain before the ban takes effect\n                   But even board members who voted for the cell phone ban expressed concerns and the need for more answers. Among the concerns: how students would be able to communicate with parents in the event of an emergency, such as a mass shooting. \u201cI think in emergencies and with parent communication, this is definitely where a lot of parents have expressed their concerns to me,\u201d Melvoin said. \u201cI think it\u2019s such a tragic sign of the times, that that is what we initially think of. And we all need to do better in this country when it comes to gun violence prevention and keeping our students safe.\u201d The school board intends to seek input from students, parents, staff and experts on the best ways to implement the ban in all LAUSD schools by the spring semester of the 2024-25 school year. Board member\u00a0Rocio Rivas said \u201cthere are strong arguments on both sides\u201d of the debate. As a mother, Rivas said she was relieved to hear from her son after his school went on lockdown. As a board member who supported the cell phone ban, Rivas said the school district must find ways to make sure parents can be adequately informed in case of an emergency. Failing to notify parents could lead to unintended consequences, she said. \u201cIf there\u2019s an emergency \u2013 parents, if they cannot reach you on the phone \u2013 they\u2019re going to be right there at the school,\u201d Rivas said. And that could put \u201cthemselves in danger\u201d or create other problems. Board members also amended the proposed ban to consider the needs of students who are not fluent in English and might need access to a smartphone if that\u2019s the only way they can get adequate translations. Melvoin said the ban could be implemented in various ways. For example, some schools could ban students\u2019 cell phones from even entering the school, while other schools might require cell phones to be stored in lockers or magnetic pouches. \u201cThere will be differences between schools,\u201d LAUSD School Board President Jackie Goldberg said. \u201cBut the idea is very simple: If you bring your phone to school at all, you park it at the beginning,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019ll put it in a locker or a pouch \u2026 and you\u2019ll pick it up on your way home.\u201d The school board has 120 days to update the district\u2019s existing cell phone policy. After the policy has been updated, it will be presented to the public at a future board meeting, Melvoin\u2019s communication director Ally\u00a0Salvaria said. More states clamp down on students\u2019 cell phones at school California\u2019s state legislature passed a law in 2019 allowing \u2013 but not requiring \u2013 school districts to limit student smartphone use at school. A new bill making its way through the state legislature would require limiting or banning cell phone use by students in the public schools statewide by July 1, 2026, according to the most recent version of\u00a0the bill. Both of the California measures are referenced in the LAUSD proposal. Supporters of LAUSD\u2019s ban cited Oklahoma, Kansas, Vermont, Ohio, Louisiana and Pennsylvania as states that have introduced similar legislation. Board members also noted Florida has blocked access to social media on school district Wi-Fi. While the LAUSD vote happened at a regularly scheduled board meeting, it coincidently followed an topical essay by US Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy. The op-ed, published Monday in The New York Times, called for warning labels on social media apps based on what\u2019s known about the harm they pose to adolescents.

{"id": "2024_06_18_us_iowa-immigration-bill-blocked", "text": "A federal judge blocked an Iowa law that would have allowed the arrest of some undocumented migrants in the state after both the federal government and a migrant advocacy group sued. In the Monday ruling, District Court Judge Stephen H. Locher said only the federal government has the constitutional ability to make US immigration policy. \u201cIowa is not trying to enforce any unique interest, but rather is trying to help (or, one might say, to\u00a0compel) the United States to carry out federal immigration laws,\u201d Locher wrote. The law \u2013 Senate File 2340 \u2013 which was set to go into effect July 1, made it a crime to be in the state after being deported, denied admission to the United States or have an outstanding deportation order. Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds, a Republican, signed the law in April, saying it was a response to a lack of immigration enforcement from President Joe Biden and the federal government. \u201cWith this injunction states are left defenseless to the ongoing crisis at our southern border,\u201d Reynolds said in a statement. In his ruling, Locher noted the Iowa law would allow law enforcement to arrest immigrants who have a pending appeal of their federal deportation order. \u201cThe point is clear: Senate File 2340 does not permit federal immigration law to run its course,\u201d wrote Locher. The Iowa legislation is similar to a measure passed in Texas that would allow state law enforcement to arrest and detain suspected illegal immigrants. A federal appeals court\u00a0put the Texas law on hold\u00a0in March. The state measures come as immigration continues to be a hot-button issue for voters during this election season, with Republicans weaponizing high levels of illegal border crossings against Democrats, particularly Biden, and both parties sparring over measures to\u00a0secure the southern border. Iowa Migrant Movement for Justice, one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit, called the ruling \u201ca good first step,\u201d but added, \u201cThe fight continues!\u201d The state will appeal the decision, Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird said. \u201cI am disappointed in today\u2019s court decision that blocks Iowa from stopping illegal reentry and keeping our communities safe,\u201d Bird said in a statement Monday. \u201cSince Biden refuses to secure our borders, he has left states with no choice but to do the job for him.\u201d CNN\u2019s Alisha Ebrahimji and Alexandra Ross contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/18/us/iowa-immigration-bill-blocked/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "us"}}

Documents newly obtained by CNN detail that Boeing warned Southwest Airlines and American Airlines of the potential problem in February and both airlines in turn sent alerts to their respective pilot groups. \u201cBoeing has received two reports of CFM LEAP-1B engine failures following large bird strikes on takeoff and initial climb,\u201d said the alert to American Airlines pilots.

{"id": "2024_06_18_us_tubman-combahee-river-south-carolina-reaj", "text": "In the early hours of June 2, 1863, Union army gunboats idled along the banks of South Carolina\u2019s Combahee River, waiting to give the signal to\u00a0the enslaved people hiding ashore. When the boats sounded their steam whistles, more than 700 men, women\u00a0and children fled the plantations\u00a0along the river\u00a0to race toward freedom, in an operation that came to be known as the Combahee Ferry Raid. Harriet Tubman led the secret operation, alongside more than 100 Black Union soldiers \u2013 making her the first woman in US history to lead a major military operation.  This year marks the 161st\u00a0anniversary of the\u00a0raid,\u00a0and the Tabernacle Baptist Church\u00a0\u2013 the first\u00a0Black\u00a0Baptist\u00a0church in Beaufort, South Carolina \u2013 unveiled a\u00a0monument commemorating the pivotal military operation that reshaped the state\u2019s Lowcountry. Ninety-year-old sculptor and engineer Ed Dwight told CNN he spent eight years crafting the statue. The 14-foot bronze\u00a0monument\u00a0features a steamboat, Tubman, two Union soldiers and about a dozen enslaved people seeking freedom. \u201cI could just put a statue of her [Tubman] standing there with none of the kids and other slaves featured \u2026 then put a plaque there to tell the story,\u201d\u00a0Dwight said.\u00a0\u201cBut I had to put that river boat and put this whole thing in context.\u201d Dwight dedicated the early part of his career to the Air Force and became the first Black astronaut candidate in US history, but he was\u00a0denied the opportunity\u00a0to join NASA. He later decided to focus on the arts, creating statues of historical African American figures including Frederick Douglass and Barack Obama. Last month, he completed his first trip to space with Blue Origin.  Dwight told CNN he didn\u2019t come to appreciate the impact historical figures like Tubman had on the nation\u2019s history until much later in life because he\u00a0attended all-White private Catholic schools,\u00a0where African American history wasn\u2019t taught to students. He said it wasn\u2019t until he was gifted a stack of history books that he learned about the important\u00a0figures in Black history. \u201cHarriet Tubman stuck from the very beginning because she was the first name that I could hang on to,\u201d Dwight said. \u201cHere\u2019s this woman, barely 5 feet tall, running around against the odds doing all these incredible things,\u201d he added.\u00a0\u201cI became an early fan of hers and I\u2019ve done several memorials of her.\u201d Rev. Kenneth Hodges, the pastor of Tabernacle Baptist Church,\u00a0said it was only right for\u00a0the church\u00a0to honor Tubman and other historical figures who played a significant role in Beaufort\u2019s history. \u201cMost people don\u2019t know about the raid,\u201d Hodges said of the significance of the statue. \u201cHarriet Tubman is standing on top of the monument and she\u2019s reaching back to the generations yet unborn to come along.\u201d Combahee River Raid Tubman is widely known for escaping slavery and becoming one of the most prominent conductors of the Underground Railroad \u2013 successfully rescuing about 70 enslaved people during more than\u00a0a dozen trips,\u00a0according to the\u00a0National Park Service. When Tubman\u00a0first\u00a0traveled to Beaufort, South Carolina,\u00a0in 1862, there were nearly 200 plantations that held approximately 10,000 enslaved\u00a0people,\u00a0according to the\u00a0National Park Service. Tubman served as a volunteer for the Union Army, working as an informant behind enemy lines in the South, as well as a nurse, laundress and cook before eventually becoming a spy and scout, according to the National Museum of African American History. Just before midnight on June\u00a01, 1863 \u2013\u00a0around\u00a0two years into the Civil War \u2013 Tubman and\u00a0Col.\u00a0James Montgomery of the Union Army\u00a0set sail up the Combahee River, leading three military gunboats of\u00a0about\u00a0150\u00a0Black\u00a0Union soldiers.\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThey knew they had to do it under the cover of darkness,\u201d said Karen Hill, CEO of the Harriet Tubman Home,\u00a0the nonprofit that manages the Harriet Tubman National Historical Park. The ships reached the banks\u00a0of South Carolina\u2019s Lowcountry plantations\u00a0early\u00a0the next morning where more than 700 enslaved people hid in the shadows, waiting for Tubman and the soldiers to sound the\u00a0ships\u2019\u00a0whistles. \u201cWhen she gave the signal, they just came out from the rice fields to the water,\u201d Hill told CNN. Hundreds of men, women, and children escaped to the military ships carrying all their belongings. \u201cThat was the largest raid emancipating [enslaved] people in the United States,\u201d Hill said. Faith and Juneteenth The Tabernacle Baptist Church unveiled the statue and commemorated Tubman\u2019s heroic raid with song, prayer, and speeches during a ceremony earlier this month. Rev.\u00a0Hodges said more than 500 people attended, including Ernestine Wyatt, Tubman\u2019s great-great-great grandniece. \u201cWhen I allow myself to think about it, I begin to cry because I think about how hard life was,\u201d Wyatt\u00a0told CNN. \u201cShe had liberated herself, but it didn\u2019t mean as much to her as it could have because she didn\u2019t have her family there with her.\u201d Wyatt said Tubman\u2019s determination to rescue her enslaved loved ones \u2013 as well as strangers \u2013 despite the life-threatening risks, is a prime example of her unwavering faith in God. \u201cI would have to say that a lot of that [faith] transpired from Aunt Harriet to my great grandmother, to my grandmother, to my mother, and then to me,\u201d Wyatt\u00a0said. \u201cThat part of her is in my DNA.\u201d Faith was a reoccurring theme throughout the commemoration ceremony. \u201cMany people have sown into our present and our future, and it\u2019s important for us to remember them in a meaningful way,\u201d Hodges told CNN. \u201cWe are highlighting the struggle, their faith, their commitment, and their service through the years.\u201d Hodges, a former South Carolina state representative, introduced a bill in 2006 to name a future bridge that would span the Combahee River, the Harriet Tubman Bridge. The bridge now stretches across the blackwater river between Beaufort and Colleton counties.\u00a0\u00a0 Dwight said faith was also a key concept behind the vision for the Tubman sculpture. \u201cMy propensity is to tell larger stories to have people just not look at her and walk away,\u201d he said. \u201cBut to provoke thought \u2026 and to walk away with a picture in their head about what it was like (then) compared to what it is today.\u201d While abolitionists worked to end slavery in\u00a0the United States, many didn\u2019t expect to see it come to fruition during their time on Earth \u2013 except Tubman, according to her great-great-great grandniece. Tubman, she said, would often share that God revealed that her \u201cpeople are free\u201d in a dream and that\u00a0the\u00a0emancipation of\u00a0enslaved people\u00a0was already done. \u201cPrior to the war starting she had a vision,\u201d Wyatt said. Two years after the Combahee Ferry Raid and\u00a0President\u00a0Abraham Lincoln\u2019s\u00a0\u00a0Emancipation Proclamation, the last enslaved people were set free in Texas on June 19, 1865 \u2013\u00a0a day celebrated as\u00a0Juneteenth.

{"id": "2024_06_17_us_bling-bishop-lamor-whitehead-sentenced-fraud-extortion", "text": "Lamor Whitehead, a flashy Brooklyn pastor nicknamed the \u201cBling Bishop,\u201d was sentenced Monday to nine years in prison after being convicted of using a parishioner\u2019s retirement savings and trying to extort a businessman, the US Attorney for the Southern District of New York announced. Whitehead was found guilty in March of two counts of wire fraud, as well as one count each of attempted wire fraud, attempted extortion and making false statements to federal law enforcement agents. The convictions are from three separate schemes. In addition to his prison sentence, the 45-year-old New Jersey man\u00a0\u201cwas sentenced to three years of supervised release and ordered to pay $85,000 in restitution and forfeit $95,000,\u201d\u00a0according to a news release from the US attorney\u2019s office and court documents. \u201cLamor Whitehead is a con man who stole millions of dollars in a string of financial frauds and even stole from one of his own parishioners.\u00a0He lied to federal agents, and again to the Court at his trial.\u00a0Today\u2019s\u00a0sentence puts an end to Whitehead\u2019s various schemes and reflects this Office\u2019s commitment to bring accountability to those who abuse their positions of trust,\u201d US Attorney\u00a0for the Southern District of New York Damian Williams said in the news release. One of Whitehead\u2019s attorneys has previously said they plan to appeal. CNN has reached out to Whitehead\u2019s lawyer for comment. Known for his Louis Vuitton suits and extravagant jewelry, Whitehead was a pastor at the Leaders of\u00a0Tomorrow International Ministries in Brooklyn. He made headlines in 2022 after he said he and his wife were\u00a0robbed of $1 million\u00a0worth of jewelry at their church. Prosecutors said Whitehead defrauded one of his parishioners by convincing her to invest approximately $90,000 of her retirement savings with him so he could help her buy a home; however, he ended up spending the money on luxury goods and personal expenses instead,\u00a0according to\u00a0an indictment. Whitehead also extorted a businessman for $5,000 and then attempted to convince the man to loan him $500,000 and grant him a stake\u00a0in real estate transactions in exchange for obtaining\u00a0\u201cfavorable actions by the New York City government\u201d\u00a0that he knew he could not provide, the indictment said. Whitehead used his ties to New York City Mayor Eric Adams to try to make the deal, the US attorney\u2019s office said in a\u00a0March news release. He also submitted a fraudulent application for a $250,000 business loan that included doctored bank statements, which falsely claimed he had millions of dollars in the bank and hundreds of thousands of dollars in monthly revenue,\u00a0according\u00a0to the US attorney\u2019s office news release. Whitehead\u00a0had \u201csubmitted similar fraudulent applications to various other financial institutions, stealing millions of dollars in the process,\u201d the release\u00a0said. And when speaking to FBI agents who were executing a search warrant outside his New Jersey mansion, Whitehead made false statements by telling the agents he only had one phone, when he actually had two, according to the indictment.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/17/us/bling-bishop-lamor-whitehead-sentenced-fraud-extortion/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_18_us_justin-harris-georgia-hot-car-prison-release", "text": "Justin Ross Harris, a Georgia father whose murder\u00a0conviction\u00a0for the hot-car death of his 22-month-old son was\u00a0overturned\u00a0by the state\u2019s Supreme Court in 2022, has been released from prison, according to prison records. Harris was released from Macon State Prison on Father\u2019s Day \u2013 nearly 10 years to the day since his son, Cooper, died after his father left him strapped inside a car for seven hours on a hot day while he went to work \u2013 according to the Georgia Department of Corrections website. The father was convicted of Cooper\u2019s murder in 2016 after prosecutors convinced a jury Harris killed his son to escape the burdens of his marriage and fatherhood. But the life sentence was overturned in 2022 by the Georgia Supreme Court, which ruled 6-3 that evidence submitted by prosecutors of Harris\u2019 extramarital relationships \u2013 which the state had portrayed as the motivation behind his alleged decision to kill his son \u2013 had an unfair prejudicial impact on the jury. Though the murder charges were nullified, the court left in place three other counts relating to his electronic exchanges of lewd material\u00a0with an underage girl. Harris was sentenced to a total of 12 years on those three charges: 10 years for one count of attempt to commit sexual exploitation of a child, and one year each for two counts of dissemination of harmful material to a minor, according to the ruling. Prison records state his maximum release date as June 18, 2024, on the sexual exploitation charge and marks his confinement status as \u201cinactive.\u201d After his release from prison Sunday, he was transferred to the Cobb County Adult Detention Center to serve the two additional years on the other charges, according to the Office of the Cobb County District Attorney. Cooper\u2019s death and his father\u2019s trial captivated the nation, in part because hot-car death cases rarely lead to murder charges against grieving parents who insist leaving their child in a hot car was nothing more than a tragic accident. After prosecutors announced last year they would not retry the murder case against Harris, his attorney said Harris was relieved and \u201cthankful that today\u2019s dismissal may begin to restore Cooper\u2019s legacy as a child much loved by his parents.\u201d \u201cRoss has always accepted the moral responsibility for Cooper\u2019s death. But after all these years of investigation and review, this dismissal of charges confirms that Cooper\u2019s death was unintentional and therefore not a crime,\u201d attorney Carlos Rodriguez said in May 2023. \u201cThroughout the course of representing Ross, we have learned that these tragic accidents often happen while the child is in the care of a loving parent. Ross was no different,\u201d Rodriguez said. Cooper\u2019s mother, Leanna Taylor, has stood by her belief that Harris did not intend to kill their child that sweltering day. She said after the Georgia Supreme Court ruling that she hoped it would change how their son is remembered. \u201cThat he was wanted, that he was loved and that he is missed every single day,\u201d she said in a statement released by her attorney. While the trial revealed that on the day their son died, Harris exchanged sexual messages and photos with five women and a 16-year-old minor, Taylor maintained that Harris remained a loving father despite failing their marriage. The couple has since divorced. \u201cRoss was a loving and proud father to Cooper. At the same time Ross was being a terrible husband. These two things can and did exist at the same time.\u201d CNN\u2019s Ray Sanchez contributed to this report. Clarification: After Justin Ross Harris was released from prison, he was transferred to the Cobb County Adult Detention Center to serve his remaining two years for the dissemination of harmful material to a minor.

But the exact reason the firewall \u201cstopped calls from reaching dispatch centers remains under review,\u201d the state\u2019s office of public safety and security said in a statement on X. Calls were prevented from reaching 911 dispatchers from 1:15 p.m. to 3:15 p.m. Tuesday, the statement said \u2013 while the first alert from the state acknowledging an issue with the system came at 2:17 p.m. via X. Residents received a public safety alert message on their phones saying 911 services were down for the whole state and delays in public safety response might occur at 2:30 p.m. The firewall is a \u201csafety feature that provides protection against cyberattacks and hacking,\u201d officials said, adding it instead prevented calls from getting to 911 dispatch centers. Wednesday\u2019s statement said the disruption was resolved at 3:15 p.m. An update from officials confirming its resolution was posted on social media almost 30 minutes later. The 911 department \u201cwill take all necessary steps to prevent a future occurrence,\u201d its Executive Director Frank Pozniak said in the Wednesday statement.

{"id": "2024_06_16_us_maryland-marijuana-pardons", "text": "Maryland\u2019s governor issued pardons for more than 175,000 marijuana convictions Monday \u2013 a significant act of mass clemency that reflects the rapidly changing attitudes toward a drug that an increasing number of Americans want to see legalized. The pardons by Gov. Wes Moore, a Democrat, will forgive low-level marijuana possession and certain paraphernalia charges for an estimated 100,000 people, the governor\u2019s office said \u2013 noting it was possible for a person to have more than one conviction pardoned. The Washington Post first reported the news. \u201cThis is about changing how both government and society view those who have been walled off from opportunity because of broken and uneven policies,\u201d Moore said at a signing event Monday, almost two years after Maryland voters approved a constitutional amendment legalizing recreational marijuana for people 21 and older. The governor described his executive order as \u201cthe most sweeping state-level pardon\u201d in the country\u2019s history. In an acknowledgement of the disproportionate impact the issue has on Black and brown people, the event coincided this week with Juneteenth, which\u00a0commemorates the end of slavery\u00a0in the US, The Washington Post reported. Monday\u2019s order will result in the pardons of more than 150,000 misdemeanor convictions for simple possession of cannabis and more than 18,000 misdemeanor convictions for use or possession with intent to use drug paraphernalia, the governor office said. About 25% of those convictions stem from the city of Baltimore. The pardons \u2013 which will also apply to people who have died, the Post reported \u2013 will not result in people being freed from incarceration, the governor\u2019s office said, and it noted Monday\u2019s action was not the same as expungement. The order signed Monday directs the state Department of Public Safety and Correctional services to devise a way to indicate the pardon on an individual\u2019s criminal record. But those seeking to have their conviction removed from the public record must still petition the courts. Marylanders approved recreational cannabis for adult use amid a marked change in the way cannabis is viewed by the public: In November 2023, a record 70% of Americans surveyed by Gallup said they supported cannabis legalization. In 2014, the share was 51%. \u201cWe cannot celebrate the benefits of legalization if we do not address the consequences of criminalization,\u201d Moore said, noting that the convictions pardoned Monday meant \u201ca harder time with everything \u2013 everything from housing, to employment to education.\u201d Maryland Attorney General Anthony G. Brown said at Monday\u2019s event there was a \u201cdeeply rooted bias in drug related arrests and sentencing,\u201d which he described as a vestige of slavery. \u201cCannabis convictions for hundreds of thousands of people here in Maryland were scarlet letters, modern day shackles,\u201d he said. \u201cI can almost hear the clanging of those shackles falling to the floor with your pardon this morning, governor.\u201d Restrictions easing Moore\u2019s pardons Monday are just the latest illustration of the waning restrictions around marijuana, which has so far been legalized for adult recreational use in 24 states, two territories and Washington, DC, according to data from the National Conference of State Legislatures. Thirty-eight states allow the medical use of cannabis products. And while the drug remains illegal federally, there have been signs of change at that level, too. In April, the US Department of Justice recommended marijuana \u2013 designated for more than 50 years as a Schedule I substance \u2013 be rescheduled as a Schedule III controlled substance, which would bring its classification in line with prescription drugs such as ketamine and Tylenol with codeine. Substances classified as Schedule I \u2013\u00a0like heroin and ecstasy \u2013 are by contrast considered to have no accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse, and they are subject to the strictest of restrictions. The recommendation followed a US Food and Drug Administration review at the direction of President Joe Biden, who in 2022 had written to the Justice Department supporting marijuana\u2019s reclassification. State-licensed cannabis dispensaries and retail shops are expected to generate $32.1 billion in sales this year, according to estimates from MJBiz, a cannabis industry trade publication and events organizer.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/16/us/maryland-marijuana-pardons/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "us"}}
