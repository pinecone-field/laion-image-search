Rico Elmore spoke to CNN as he walked away from the rally stage. His white shirt was stained with blood from the victim, who he said he did not know. Elmore described jumping over the barrier and putting his hand on the head of the attendee who was shot. \u201cAll we know is shots were fired, and then I jumped over the barrier and put my hand on the guy\u2019s head that was profusely bleeding,\u201d Elmore told CNN. He said he didn\u2019t know the attendee and he was \u201cjust a stranger.\u201d Elmore was visibly shaken up but said he was not harmed. He said he only saw one attendee hit and did not see what happened to Trump. The former president said on Truth Social on Saturday that he was shot in the ear but his campaign said he was otherwise fine. The Secret Service said hours after the shooting that one rally attendee is dead and two others are critically injured. The gunman shot from outside the rally and was \u201cneutralized\u201d by the Secret Service, spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said. Senate Republican candidate Dave McCormick was sitting in the front row of the event. McCormick told CNN he saw the \u201cimmediate attack on the president\u201d and a person behind him who appeared to be severely injured. McCormick told CNN that Trump had just announced him and invited him up to the stage, when about a minute later he heard \u201ca series of shots \u2013 about seven or eight shots \u2013 just \u2018pop, pop, pop.\u2019\u201d \u201cIt was all of a sudden just chaos. The Secret Service immediately covered the president, jumped on top of him, and the crowd immediately went to the ground,\u201d McCormick said. McCormick said he looked over his shoulder behind him and \u201cit was clear that somebody had been hit.\u201d People around the man were trying to administer first aid, he said, as it took several minutes for medical assistance to get into the crowd because it was so dense. \u201cBut you can imagine with that kind of incident happening, it\u2019s very hard to know what\u2019s coming. \u2026 It seemed like the shots were coming from my front \u2013 so the president\u2019s left \u2013 which makes sense why the person behind me was hit. But I\u2019m not sure if there were also shots coming from the other direction, so as you might imagine it was chaotic and confusing in the moment,\u201d McCormick said. McCormick said he and all of the roughly 15,000 attendees in the crowd went through metal detector screening before they entered the rally. Joseph Meyn told CNN that a man near him was shot. \u201cVery shocking \u2026 a lot of people just thought it was fireworks going off, I knew immediately\u00a0it was gunfire,\u201d Meyn said.

{"id": "2024_07_10_us_dwight-jackson-employment-discrimination-lawsuit-reaj", "text": "A Black man has filed an employment discrimination lawsuit against a hotel in Detroit, Michigan, alleging the hotel only offered him a job interview after he changed the name on his resume, according to a copy of the lawsuit obtained by CNN. Dwight Jackson filed the lawsuit against the Shinola Hotel on July 3, alleging he was denied a job when he applied as \u201cDwight Jackson,\u201d but later offered an interview when he changed his name to \u201cJohn Jebrowski.\u201d The lawsuit alleges Jackson was denied a job in \u201cviolation of Michigan Elliott Larsen Civil Rights Act.\u201d Between January and April 2024, Jackson, a 27-year-old Black man, applied to multiple positions at the Shinola Hotel in downtown Detroit, including a role in reception, according to the lawsuit. On its website, Shinola Hotel says it is a \u201cluxury\u201d hotel. Jackson\u2019s attorney, Jon Marko, provided CNN with a copy of Jackson\u2019s resume, which details consistent employment, including previous roles as a \u201cFront Desk Agent\u201d at Detroit\u2019s Marriott Westin Book Cadillac and David Whitney Hotel, which use the words luxury and luxurious to describe their respective hotels. \u201cMr. Jackson had applied for a job that he was eminently qualified for,\u201d Marko, a civil rights attorney, told CNN. However, Shinola Hotel did not offer Jackson an interview. After getting no response to his initial job applications, in April 2024 Jackson applied again, making one significant change to his application \u2014 his name. According to the lawsuit, Jackson applied to Shinola Hotel \u201ctwice for similar positions under a more readily apparent Caucasian name, with the alias \u2018John Jebrowski,\u2019\u201d using nearly identical resumes. The resumes have different dates of previous employment. He was offered multiple interviews within the same week, the lawsuit claims. The lawsuit alleges that \u201cJackson established that the Defendant\u2019s consideration of candidates was based on the racial appearance of the applicant\u2019s name.\u201d \u201cTo be denied a job in 2024 in your hometown, for the color of your skin, goes beyond dollars and cents. It goes into the psyche of a person,\u201d Marko said. Sage Hospitality Group is Shinola Hotel\u2019s operating partner. Anna Stancioff, Sage Hospitality\u2019s Senior Corporate Director of PR & Brand Communications and spokesperson for the hotel said in an email Tuesday, \u201cWe take this allegation very seriously and do not tolerate discrimination of any kind. We are committed to fostering an inclusive workplace where everyone has the opportunity to succeed and are dedicated to building a diverse workforce that reflects the community.\u201d According to Marko, Jackson attended the job interview and confronted the interviewer at Shinola Hotel. He revealed his real identity and expressed his belief that he was not given an interview initially because his name appeared more traditionally African American. \u201cShortly after Jackson underwent the interview process, he was informed that he was no longer a viable candidate for the position,\u201d the lawsuit states. Marko said employment discrimination is not unusual. He added, as a civil rights attorney, \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a lot of discrimination in hiring, especially when it comes to the exclusion of minorities and individuals who have minority-sounding names.\u201d A recent\u00a0study published by the National Bureau of Economic Research\u00a0found that name bias is a prevalent issue in the hiring process. Researchers sent out identical resumes to 108 U.S. employers to analyze whether race and gender affected callback rates for job applications. Resumes with Black male and Black female names received the fewest callbacks. But, Marko said, proving cases of name bias is extremely challenging and most of these cases never get off the ground due to a lack of evidence. Jackson\u2019s case is different, he said, because he applied twice for similar positions with nearly the exact same resume and it yielded different results when he used the alias. Marko said Jackson \u201cwants to shed light on this problem that\u2019s not just isolated at the Shinola Hotel, not just isolated in Detroit or Michigan, but across the country. He wants to make sure that it doesn\u2019t happen to anyone else.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/10/us/dwight-jackson-employment-discrimination-lawsuit-reaj/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/14/2024", "section": "us"}}

The honor has been bestowed on unsung heroes over the years\u00a0in Tillman\u2019s name. He\u00a0gave up a lucrative contract with the Arizona Cardinals\u00a0to serve in the Army\u2019s elite Rangers force in Afghanistan, where he was killed in 2004. However, the selection of the Duke of Sussex as recipient this year has come under scrutiny after Mary Tillman told The Daily Mail she was \u201cshocked\u201d by the choice when there are far \u201cmore fitting\u201d recipients. ESPN announced last month Prince Harry would receive the award, citing \u201chis tireless work in making a positive impact for the veteran community\u201d through The Invictus Games Foundation, which he founded. The sporting event for wounded, injured and sick servicemen and women \u201ccelebrates resilience, community, and healing through the power of sport,\u201d according to the announcement. At the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles, an emotional Prince Harry expressed his \u201cgratitude\u201d to everyone at the Pat Tillman Foundation with his wife, Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, looking on. \u201cThe truth is, I stand here not as Prince Harry, Pat Tillman award recipient, but rather a voice on behalf of the Invictus Games Foundation and the thousands of veterans and service personnel from over 20 nations who have made the Invictus Games a reality. This award belongs to them. Not to me,\u201d he said. The Duke of Sussex added it is important to \u201chighlight these allies, athletes, and their amazing families for their achievements, their spirit and their courage\u201d and said the Invictus Games have reduced the number of veteran suicides in the last decade. \u201cThe spirit of the Invictus Games transcends race, time, and borders,\u201d Prince Harry continued. \u201cIt is born from unity and exudes purpose.\u201d Tillman\u2019s mother has disagreed with the choice to award Prince Harry, calling him \u201ca controversial and divisive individual\u201d and saying there are \u201cindividuals working in the veteran community that are doing tremendous things to assist veterans.\u201d \u201cThese individuals do not have the money, resources, connections or privilege that Prince Harry has,\u201d she told The Daily Mail last month. \u201cI feel that those types of individuals should be recognized.\u201d An ESPN spokesperson said in a statement Prince Harry was honored \u2013 with the support of the Tillman Foundation \u2013 \u201cspecifically for the work of The Invictus Games Foundation as it celebrates its 10th\u00a0year promoting healing through the power of sport for military service members and veterans around the world.\u201d \u201cWhile we understand not everyone will agree with all honorees selected for any award, The Invictus Games Foundation does incredible work and ESPN believes this is a cause worth celebrating.\u201d Sign up for CNN\u2019s Royal News CNN has reached out to a representative for the Sussexes for comment. Last year, an emotional\u00a0Damar Hamlin\u00a0presented the Pat Tillman Award to the Buffalo Bills training staff who helped save his life during a game. Hamlin wiped tears from his eyes as he took the stage that day to introduce the training staff \u2013 months after he went into\u00a0cardiac arrest\u00a0on the field after making a tackle during the first quarter of a Bills\u2019 game against the Cincinnati Bengals in January 2023. The ESPYS show, which celebrates excellence in sports, was hosted this year by tennis star Serena Williams. Honorees included former NFL safety Steve Gleason, who received the Arthur Ashe Award for Courage for his fight against ALS.

American Rounds, the distributor of the machines, uses AI technology to scan the customers\u2019 identification as well as facial recognition software to verify a customer\u2019s identity, according to the company\u2019s website. The software works together to verify the buyer\u2019s age and that the person using the machine matches the identification scanned. Each machine sells ammunition\u00a0for various firearm calibers, including rifles, shotguns and handguns, according to American Rounds. Grant Magers, CEO of American Rounds, said local grocery stores approached him\u00a0in the spring of 2023 about utilizing his technology to sell ammunition. The company rolled out its\u00a0first dispenser in Alabama last November. \u201cIt\u2019s not much different than setting up any other business,\u201d Magers said. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) has\u00a0allowed the machines, telling CNN in a statement: \u201cA federal license is not required to sell ammunition. However, commercial sales of ammunition must comply with state laws as well as any applicable federal laws.\u201d The Office of the Oklahoma Attorney General tells CNN a \u201creview of state statutes indicates these vending machines appear to be lawful.\u201d CNN has reached out to the Alabama and Texas attorneys general to confirm the legality of the dispensers in their respective states. Earlier this month, the ammunition dispenser in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, was taken down and relocated by American Rounds. \u201cWe as a business \u2026 made the decision to relocate that machine because we weren\u2019t having the sales that we wanted to at that location compared to our other spots,\u201d Magers said. Kip Tyner, a member of Tuscaloosa city council, told CNN: \u201cIt may be getting in the hands of people who are not that responsible. I just don\u2019t see it as a necessity.\u201d \u201cThere could be a dispute, and someone got upset with someone else and instead of cooling off and having to go to the store the next day they could go to the grocery store to get ammunition and use it for the wrong reasons,\u201d Tyner said. American Rounds plans to expand into more states, having already received offers from stores in California, Florida and Hawaii, among others, Magers said. The company, he said, is setting up two more dispensers in Texas and Colorado within the next couple of weeks.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/12/us/vending-machines-ammunition-alabama-texas-oklahoma/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/14/2024", "section": "us"}}

Speaking from Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, about two hours after the shooting, Biden said, \u201cThere\u2019s no place in America for this kind of violence.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s sick,\u201d the president added. Biden said he hoped to speak with Trump soon. With the apparent shooting threatening to further inflame political rhetoric in the months ahead of November, Biden took the opportunity to call for the country to unite. \u201cWe cannot allow for this to be happening. We cannot be like this,\u201d he said. The shooting \u2013 which is being investigated as an attempted assassination, according to law enforcement officials \u2013 left Trump bleeding from the ear. A spokesperson said the former president was doing \u201cfine\u201d and being treated at a medical facility. The suspected shooter and at least one rally attendee were killed, Butler County, Pennsylvania, District Attorney Richard Goldinger told CNN. Biden was attending mass at St. Edmond\u2019s Catholic\u00a0Church in Rehoboth Beach when the shooting occurred. The shooting marks a massive turning point not only for the country, but for Biden\u2019s role as president: he entered the church as a president fighting for his political future and exited in a familiar role - the nation\u2019s counsellor in chief now tasked with bringing the United States together during a serious crisis. The shooting at Trump\u2019s rally is a shocking turn in what has been a highly charged political season for both of the major-party candidates. Biden has pitched the race as the decision between the continuation and possible destruction of democracy in the United States. That rhetoric will now be closely examined in the aftermath of the apparent attack, including comments that the president made in a call with donors on July 8, during which he said, \u201cIt\u2019s time to put Trump in the bullseye,\u201d according to a summary of the call provided by his campaign. Biden said in a statement earlier Saturday that he was praying for Trump: \u201cJill and I are grateful to the Secret Service for getting him to safety. There\u2019s no place for this kind of violence in America. We must unite as one nation to condemn it.\u201d Inside Biden campaign\u2019s response Moments after the incident, Biden campaign officials huddled and decided to pull down all TV ads and limit their public campaign messaging. Bidens campaign manager Julie Ch\u00e1vez Rodr\u00edguez and chair Jen O\u2019Malley Dillon sent a note to campaign staff Saturday evening in the immediate aftermath of the shooting, urging staff to \u201crefrain from issuing any comments on social media or in public.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re also asking everyone to pause any proactive campaign communication across all platforms and in all circumstances until we know more,\u201d they wrote in a note, which was obtained by CNN. Ch\u00e1vez Rodr\u00edguez and O\u2019Malley Dillon began the note by saying that as more information comes in, they are \u201cgrateful to the members of law enforcement who immediately jumped into action and wishing Trump a quick and full recovery.\u201d Mood inside the White House is \u2018shock\u2019 The mood inside the White House is \u201cshock\u201d as officials responded to the shooting, according to a senior administration official, and added that officials south \u201cto be responsive and serious.\u201d \u201cIt is just really horrible,\u201d the senior administration official said, responding to how the reaction has been within the White House following the incident. \u201cIt should never happen.

{"id": "2024_07_12_us_tusla-race-massacre-victim-identified-reaj", "text": "A\u00a0victim of the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre whose remains were found during an archaeological dig at Oaklawn Cemetery has been identified through\u00a0DNA genealogy, Tulsa officials announced. Mayor G.T. Bynum announced at\u00a0a news conference Friday the victim\u2019s identity as C.L. Daniel, a veteran who served in World War I. \u201cHis family did not know where he had been buried for the last 103 years until this week,\u201d Bynum said. Officials say Daniel was identified \u201cusing data submitted through GEDmatch and Family Tree DNA\u201d and with the assistance of Intermountain Forensics, a laboratory that conducts genealogy work,\u00a0according to a news release. The dig is part of the 1921 Graves Investigation, an effort to identify currently unknown victims of the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre,\u00a0CNN previously reported. Alison Wilde, the\u00a0genealogy\u00a0case manager for the 1921 Graves Investigation, said that they compared\u00a0the DNA profiles and the GEDmatch in the family tree databases. People who have taken DNA tests to create family tree databases \u201chave contributed so much to this research,\u201d she said. Then, they contacted individuals who had matching DNA relatives to see who was buried at Oaklawn Cemetery, according to the news release. Daniel, born in Newnan, Georgia, was one of seven sons to Thomas and Amanda Merriweather. \u201cIt was only through those additional DNA comparisons that we were able to narrow our focus down to a set of brothers and begin requesting records of their lives which led to the records from the National Archive,\u201d Wilde said. A letter obtained from the National Archives also contributed to Daniel\u2019s identification, the release states. \u201cContained in the records (from the National Archives) was the most convincing piece of evidence tying him to the Tulsa Race Massacre \u2013 a letter from C. L.\u2019s family attorney written to the US Veterans Administration on behalf of C. L.\u2019s mother regarding C. L.\u2019s survivor benefits,\u201d according to the release. With the help of the National Archives, officials found records showing Daniel was drafted into the US Army in 1918, was stationed at Camp Gordon and then honorably discharged in December 1919, the news release said. Another\u00a0letter, written by Daniel in February 1921, showed that he was in Ogden, Utah, and was trying to make his way back home to his mother in Georgia, officials said at the news conference. Wilde said that this letter came from the same records request, which was written to the Veterans Administration and the War Risk Insurance Department. There was no mention of Tulsa in the 1921 letter, Wilde said. Officials said they could only assume that in his efforts to travel back to Georgia, he went through Tulsa, since his remains were found in the city. The circumstances of the veteran\u2019s death are unknown, officials say. His remains showed no signs of gunshot wounds, according to Bynum. Bynum said Friday Daniel\u2019s identification offers \u201chope that other remains found in similar circumstances\u201d can also be identified. Bynum said on\u00a0Facebook\u00a0Monday officials \u201chave written documentation that 18 unidentified victims were buried.\u201d He reiterated that fact at Friday\u2019s news conference. \u201cThis identification affirms our need to continue this search with the knowledge that identification and reunification is possible,\u201d he said.

{"id": "2024_07_09_us_dvontaye-mitchell-milwaukee-death", "text": "The death of a Black man after he was pinned to the ground by security guards at a Wisconsin hotel last month\u00a0is being investigated as a homicide, as members of his family\u00a0and their attorneys on Wednesday called for criminal charges and marched to the hotel in protest of the fatal encounter that was partly captured on video. D\u2019Vontaye Mitchell, 43, was at the downtown Hyatt Regency in Milwaukee on June 30, when police allege he \u201ccaused a disturbance,\u201d prompting security guards to escort him out of the hotel, a statement from Mitchell family attorney Ben Crump said. Part of a video posted on social media shows security guards and others pinning Mitchell to the ground. Mitchell can be heard grunting and pleading with the guards, repeatedly saying \u201cplease\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d One of the guards, who appears to be White, can be heard saying \u201cstay down,\u201d and \u201cstop fighting,\u201d as the others, who appear to be people of color, hold Mitchell down, the video shows. The same guard is heard calling out to witnesses, \u201cThis is what happens when you go into the ladies room.\u201d At a news conference Wednesday, Crump and other attorneys for Mitchell\u2019s family described what they said were portions of bystander and hotel security footage that showed Mitchell running away from security, later being shoved to the ground outside, where he was held down, beaten and kicked. CNN has not seen the footage. \u201cThis was outrageous and one of the most disgusting things that I\u2019ve seen in 15 years of practice as an attorney,\u201d said William Sulton, who is also representing the family. Mitchell\u2019s family planned to hold a candlelight vigil outside the hotel Wednesday evening. \u201cTo see him go out this world the way he did, that was devastating. That would never leave my mind, that\u2019s going to live with me for the rest of my life,\u201d Mitchell\u2019s mother, Brenda Giles, told reporters Wednesday. It\u2019s unclear what led up to Mitchell\u2019s encounter with the security guards, how long it took police officers to arrive on the scene, and what Mitchell was doing at the hotel. When officers arrived, Mitchell was unresponsive and pronounced dead despite lifesaving measures, Milwaukee Police told CNN on Tuesday without mentioning Mitchell by name. Crump said his office had obtained an affidavit from an unidentified hotel employee who claimed he reluctantly helped hold down Mitchell after being ordered to do so by a security guard. Crump said he would turn the document over to prosecutors but did not release it publicly. The local prosecutor is investigating Mitchell\u2019s death as a homicide, he said. \u201cMr. Mitchell\u2019s death is a tragedy, and we extend our deepest condolences to his family,\u201d said Milwaukee County District Attorney John Chisholm said in a statement Wednesday. Prosecutors met and briefed an attorney for Mitchell\u2019s family on the investigation and shared video footage and other evidence,\u00a0Chisholm said. Prosecutors were awaiting full autopsy results that Chisholm said will \u201callow our office to comprehensively evaluate the actions leading up to Mr. Mitchell\u2019s death from the perspective of potential criminal liability.\u201d \u201cAll aspects of these actions, including Mr. Mitchell\u2019s death and the use of force by hotel personnel, will be closely examined,\u201d Chisholm said. The preliminary manner of death for Mitchell is homicide, Karen Domagalski from the Milwaukee County Medical Examiner\u2019s Office told CNN on Tuesday, but the final manner is yet to be determined. \u201cThe cause and manner of death is pending toxicology and further investigation, Domagalski said. \u201cWe do not have a timeline for when this case will be finalized.\u201d The encounter comes as the use of force\u00a0\u2013 particularly\u00a0against people of color\u00a0\u2013\u00a0by police and others in authority roles remains under scrutiny nearly four years after protests flared nationwide following the murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer. Now, every time Mitchell\u2019s children turn on the TV, they are reminded of how their father died, DeAsia Harmon, Mitchell\u2019s widow, told CNN affiliate WTMJ on Monday. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t even go into the grocery store with my daughter without her being afraid of the security standing at the door,\u201d Harmon said. \u201cShe said, \u2018is all security bad or just the ones who murdered my dad.\u2019\u201d The security guards involved in the incident have been suspended. Aimbridge Hospitality, which operates the downtown Hyatt Regency Milwaukee, is still completing its investigation, a Hyatt spokesperson told CNN on Monday. \u201cWe extend our heartfelt condolences to D\u2019Vontaye Mitchell\u2019s family, all those who knew and loved him, and the Milwaukee community in light of this tragedy,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cAs the investigation continues, Hyatt is fully committed to supporting efforts to help ensure accountability for the circumstances that led to the death of D\u2019Vontaye Mitchell.\u201d In a statement Wednesday, Hyatt said it joined Mitchell\u2019s family \u201cin their calls for transparency, accountability and justice for this senseless tragedy.\u201d \u201cWe believe that the employees of Aimbridge Hospitality who were involved should be terminated and that criminal charges should be filed,\u201d the company said. Milwaukee Police are not considering the incident as a criminal investigation because there isn\u2019t any evidence of \u201cblunt force,\u201d according to Crump. \u201cIt is unacceptable that this case is not being considered a criminal investigation despite the fatal outcome, which the medical examiner considers a homicide,\u201d Crump said in a statement Wednesday. There\u2019s no timeline for a charging decision at the moment, the Milwaukee\u00a0County\u00a0District Attorney\u2019s office told CNN on Tuesday. \u2018To know him is to love him\u2019 Giles said her eldest son was a jolly and outgoing brother, uncle and father who loved his family, she told WTMJ. \u201cEverybody that knows him, to know him is to love him, they know,\u201d his sister, Nayisha Mitchell, told the station. \u201cThey knew he was a good person.\u201d Mitchell loved music and art, his mother told reporters Wednesday. He loved walking and cooking. \u201cHe loved to dance, and he was harmless. I always called him my big teddy bear,\u201d Giles said. When Mitchell\u2019s father passed away in 2016, Mitchell fell into depression, his family told WTMJ. Giles believes her son was suffering from a mental health episode at the time of the incident, according to Crump. Shawn Moore, a witness who recorded parts of the interaction, told WTMJ he wishes he had done more. \u201cWhat I ended up capturing was another Black man in Milwaukee dealing with mental issues losing his life over nothing,\u201d he said.

{"id": "2024_07_11_us_taylor-casey-birthday-missing-bahamas-reaj", "text": "The family of Taylor Casey, a Chicago woman who has been missing in the Bahamas for nearly a month, gathered Thursday to mark her birthday and to plead with authorities to continue searching for her. \u201cThe pain I felt 42 years ago while birthing you doesn\u2019t compare to the pain I feel on today with you missing out of our lives,\u201d Colette Seymore, Casey\u2019s mother, said during a news conference in downtown Chicago livestreamed by CNN affiliate WLS. \u201cThe pain, the hurt (and) the agony is practically killing me.\u201d In June, Casey, then 41, traveled to the Bahamas to attend a retreat at Sivananda Ashram Yoga. She was last seen the evening of June 19 around Paradise Island, a small resort enclave just off the shore of the island of New Providence, the most populous island in the Bahamas, the Royal Bahamas Police Force said. Casey\u2019s friends and family described her as a \u201cfixture of Chicago\u2019s transgender community,\u201d in a news release that was shared Wednesday on a social media account dedicated to her disappearance. \u201cTaylor\u2019s disappearance has sent shockwaves through Chicago\u2019s LGBTQ+ community,\u201d the release read. \u201cTaylor\u2019s family and friends are pleading for elected officials, LGBTQ+ leaders and media to elevate her story and pressure elected officials to leverage the federal resources needed to investigate her disappearance.\u201d During the news conference Thursday, Channyn Lynne Parker, CEO of the Brave Space Alliance \u2013 a \u201cBlack-led, trans-led LGBTQ+ center\u201d in Chicago \u2013 said she believes Casey\u2019s identity as a transgender Black woman is stalling the investigation into her disappearance. \u201c(We have) trans women whose lives are being discarded, who are being thought of as nothing but an afterthought. And again, here we are \u2013 having to apply pressure when it should come as second nature and instinct to do what you know to be right,\u201d Parker said. \u201cWe\u2019re here to say right now, emphatically, resoundingly and loudly that we reject that. Black women matter (and) \u2026 Black trans women matter.\u201d Casey was first reported missing on June 20 when she failed to attend morning yoga classes, CNN previously reported. Family and friends have been critical of the way police and the retreat center have handled the investigation into her disappearance. On Thursday, Seymore noted missing person flyers of Casey were not displayed at the Royal Bahamas Police Force Department or at the retreat center. \u201cHow are you looking for my child?,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople have to see that somebody is missing and they never put up posters or anything.\u201d Authorities said Casey\u2019s cell phone had been found in the water on June 24, but it was unclear how far the location was from the retreat. \u201cWe have conducted extensive investigation into the matter,\u201d Royal Bahamas Police Force Chief Superintendent Chrislyn Skippings said during a news conference at the time of the discovery. \u201cOur priority is to find Taylor and to find Taylor in good health.\u201d Police have utilized drones, search-and-rescue dogs and divers in the investigation, Skippings said. Amid the investigation into Casey\u2019s disappearance, Michael Johnson, the Royal Bahamas Police Force superintendent in charge of the criminal investigation department, was put on \u201cgarden leave,\u201d pending an investigation, according to a July 5 statement from the police force. It is not immediately clear if there is a connection between Johnson\u2019s leave and the case. CNN has reached out to the police force for comment. Emily Williams, a long-time friend of Casey\u2019s, said she traveled to the Bahamas with Casey\u2019s mother to learn more. But upon arriving on the island, Williams said, she knew something was off. \u201cWe weren\u2019t met with caring detectives who wanted to give us an update on where our loved one was. They couldn\u2019t keep details straight, they gave us misinformation and then they tried to push us out,\u201d Williams said during the news conference, adding she and Seymore left early due to feeling \u201cunsafe.\u201d \u201cThey found the phone, but they only found the phone because Taylor\u2019s niece pinged it and gave them the location. They said that they sent out scent dogs, but it came up with nothing. They said that they sent divers and came up with nothing. And what have they done since? We haven\u2019t seen it. They haven\u2019t even reviewed the CCTV footage from the neighboring Atlantis hotel,\u201d Williams continued. Williams and Seymore say they had to \u201cpress\u201d those at the ashram in order to get more information and were not allowed to take pictures or \u201cdisturb\u201d guests. When asked if everyone at the ashram knew of Casey\u2019s disappearance, Williams said the \u201ccolonel overseeing the investigation\u201d told them \u201cmost, but not all\u201d were aware. Jonathan Goldbloom, a representative for the ashram, told CNN Thursday they \u201chave been collaborating fully with the police since we reported that Taylor is missing.\u201d In addition to holding group prayers for Casey, Goldbloom maintained the ashram has provided guests with \u201cregular updates orally and in writing.\u201d Casey\u2019s missing person flyer is posted on their bulletin board, Goldbloom added. \u201cTaylor\u2019s family and friends visit(ed) (sic) the ashram on June 26 for approximately six hours, meeting initially with representatives of the Royal Bahamian police, the US Embassy and the ashram,\u201d Goldbloom wrote to CNN. \u201cDuring Taylor\u2019s friends and family visit, they were asked to not randomly approach guests. The police were clear with their instruction that all guests must consent to speak with them on their own accord.\u00a0We announced their presence to Taylor\u2019s classmates and teachers and invited anyone wanting to meet with them to come forward. Many did, and no one intervened in terms of what individuals are to say.\u201d Casey, who has been practicing yoga for 15 years, went to the yoga retreat \u201cto fulfill a long-term goal of deepening her practice. Eager to return to Chicago, she looked forward to sharing her newfound knowledge and experience with others,\u201d a June 24 release said. A 2023 report on human rights practices in the Bahamas conducted by the US Department of State\u2019s Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor found \u201cLGBTQI+ individuals faced social stigma and discrimination and did not believe they were adequately protected by authorities.\u201d The study also found there was \u201cgenerally low social tolerance for same-sex relationships,\u201d \u201chomophobic epithets were common and socially acceptable,\u201d and a lack of an alternative reporting mechanism of incidents to police and government agents. Williams mentioned in the news conference that the Royal Bahamian Police Force said they will have an update for Casey\u2019s family and friends by Friday. \u201cWe want that update. It\u2019s been three weeks \u2013 we want an update,\u201d she said. Following the news conference a birthday party was held for Casey, that included balloons, snacks and games. \u201cToday is your birthday and we all just want to say happy birthday,\u201d Seymore said to her daughter at the start of Thursday\u2019s news conference. \u201cAlthough, it\u2019s not so happy because you are not here with us.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/11/us/taylor-casey-birthday-missing-bahamas-reaj/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/14/2024", "section": "us"}}

D.S. Teubert resigned as chief of the White Sulphur Springs Police Department after hiring Timothy Loehmann, Mayor Kathy Glover said. The death of Rice, a 12-year-old Black child, at the hands of a White police officer helped fuel the Black Lives Matter movement. \u201cChief of police Teubert voluntarily resigned his position as chief of police and voluntarily demoted himself to patrolman,\u201d Glover announced at a City Council meeting Monday. \u201cSomebody failed us,\u201d an attendee told the White Sulphur Springs City Council at the open meeting. \u201cAlthough I was not aware of the situation regarding the hiring, I still accept accountability as a leader of the city and this should not have happened,\u201d Glover said. \u201cI accept that there are mistakes in the current process that we have, and those mistakes will be reviewed and changed moving forward.\u201d White Sulphur Springs is on the border of Virginia about 370 miles from Cleveland. Loehmann resigned his position as a White Sulphur Springs probationary police officer last week, a statement from the mayor to CNN affiliate WVVA said. Loehmann has made attempts to restart his law enforcement career before. In 2018, he applied and then withdrew his application to the police department in Bellaire, a small town on the Ohio River, about 65 miles southwest of Pittsburgh, CNN affiliate WTOV-TV reported. On November 22, 2014, Loehmann fatally shot Tamir Rice at a playground, three seconds after getting out of his patrol car,\u00a0CNN reported. Rice was holding a toy pistol. A witness called 911, reporting that an individual brandishing a firearm was in a park. The caller said the firearm was probably fake \u2013 but that information was not relayed to the dispatched officers. Loehmann was a trainee at the time. An Ohio grand jury declined to criminally charge the officers in 2015, but Loehmann was fired in 2017 \u2013 not for the shooting, but because investigators found he wasn\u2019t truthful about his employment history when he applied for the job.

Second Lt. John E. McLauchlen Jr., of Detroit, was killed during World War II in 1943 while flying during a bombing mission from Panagarh, India, to a railyard near Rangoon, Myanmar \u2013 then known as Burma, according to the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency. McLauchlen was officially accounted for on January 25, 2024, the agency said. He was buried at Fort Leavenworth National Cemetery on July 8 and honored with a B-1 bomber flyover, according to Fort Leavenworth. On December 1, 1943, McLauchlen\u2019s B-24J Liberator bomber plane reached the intended target but was struck by \u201canti-aircraft fire, causing the left wing to burst into flames,\u201d according to the accounting agency. \u201cMy uncle was in charge of the mission that day, so his plane was right in the front, right in the center,\u201d McLauchlen\u2019s nephew, Richard McLauchlen Jr., said in an interview with the US Army published Thursday. \u201cOnce they started taking fire, and with that smoking wing, my uncle decided to drop out of the formation so that his plane wouldn\u2019t cause anyone else to be shot down,\u201d Richard McLauchlen Jr., who is a Vietnam veteran, said. Witnesses from another plane said they saw the one flown by McLauchlen fall into a steep dive before disappearing beneath clouds, officials reported. \u201cIt was noted that (three) enemy aircraft were also seen following the crippled plane into the clouds, and no further contact was made with the Liberator,\u201d the agency said. \u201cThe remains of the crew were not recovered or identified after the war, and they were all later declared Missing In Action.\u201d McLauchlen served as a member of the 436th Bombardment Squadron, Seventh Bombardment Group in the Army Air Forces at the time of his disappearance. Four years later, the American Graves Registration Service found the remains of what were thought to be eight people involved in a potential B-24 Liberator crash near Yodayadet, Burma, according to the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency. The remains couldn\u2019t be identified scientifically at the time and were sent to Honolulu\u2019s National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific. The accounting agency said it received a family disinterment request in early 2019 for one of the unidentified people \u201cbased on past attempts to associate the remains with other unresolved losses from southern Burma,\u201d according to the release. The remains were exhumed in October 2020 and taken to a Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency laboratory for analysis, the agency said. Scientists used anthropological analysis and circumstantial and material evidence to identify McLauchlen, and the Armed Forces Medical Examiner System used mitochondrial DNA analysis. His nephew\u2019s DNA helped identify him, the US Army reported. \u201cHe was unknown for 80 years, and now he\u2019s here, he\u2019s home, and he\u2019ll never be lost again,\u201d Richard McLauchlen Jr. said of his uncle in the US Army interview. Genetic genealogy blends DNA analysis in the lab with genealogical research, such as tracing a person\u2019s family tree. Lauded as a way to explore personal history and connect with previously unknown kin, such DNA matching also has been used to link victims to criminals such as the Happy Face Killer, who murdered at least eight women, and to identify other long-missing military service members.

{"id": "2024_07_13_us_ruth-westheimer-death", "text": "Dr. Ruth Westheimer, the iconic sex therapist whose cheerful and disarming advice helped educate millions of Americans about sexual desires and practices, has died, her publicist Pierre Lehu told CNN on Saturday. She was 96. The diminutive, grandmotherly Westheimer was a leading advocate of sexual education for decades, dispensing colorful, witty advice in her distinctive German accent. \u201cDr. Ruth\u201d \u2013 as she was more commonly known \u2013 died while her two children sat alongside at her home Friday around 11:30 p.m., Lehu said. Westheimer\u2019s first radio call-in show, \u201cSexually Speaking,\u201d debuted in New York in 1980 and proved so popular that it quickly became syndicated around the country. It also catapulted her to TV fame in the mid-1980s with her eponymous \u201cThe \u201cDr. Ruth Show,\u201d on the Lifetime network. Over the next several decades, she hosted a handful of other TV shows in which Westheimer took calls from fans around the country and spoke candidly about a wide range of taboo sexual topics. She ended many of her shows by urging her audience to \u201chave good sex!\u201d Westheimer appeared on programs aimed at the general education of children and teens and became a cultural figure, authoring more than 37 books and becoming a regular guest on late-night talk shows. She continued to joyfully dole out sex advice to the public well into her 90s. The therapist was appointed in 2023 as New York state\u2019s honorary ambassador to loneliness, a role that was the first of its kind in the nation. Westheimer wrote a book on loneliness, outlining 100 ways to beat loneliness and live a happier and more meaningful life, that will be released posthumously in September, according to the book publisher\u2019s\u00a0website. Westheimer, who was Jewish, was born in Germany in 1928. When she was 10, on the eve of World War II, Westheimer was sent to Switzerland by her parents. Her mother and father perished during the Holocaust, and Westheimer has said she believed they were killed at Auschwitz. As a teenager, Westheimer lived in Jerusalem and trained as a sniper with the Haganah, a\u00a0controversial\u00a0Zionist\u00a0militant\u00a0group which later became\u00a0part of\u00a0the\u00a0Israel Defense Forces. In her 20s, Westheimer studied in Paris and then immigrated to New York City, where she attended graduate school, eventually earning a degree from Teachers College at Columbia University. Westheimer was a member of the Museum of Jewish Heritage and regularly funded and attended events related to Holocaust remembrance. \u201cTo allow the joy to come front and center in your life, you also have to feel your emotions, even the sad ones,\u201d she wrote in her 2015 book, \u201cThe Doctor Is In: Dr. Ruth on Love, Life, and Joie de Vivre.\u201d \u201cYou have to mourn, let the tears pour out.

{"id": "2024_07_12_us_unchained-nonprofit-dogs-california-cnnheroes", "text": "Melissa Wolf\u2019s clients come in all shapes and sizes. Some have two legs, some have four. All of them need a second chance. Wolf is the founder of UnChained, a nonprofit in northern California that pairs vulnerable young people, often living in juvenile correction facilities, with abandoned or abused dogs that have been rescued from shelters. The youth learn to train the dogs in basic skills and better prepare them for adoption. The program\u2019s goal is twofold: decrease juvenile recidivism and save animals\u2019 lives. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of reciprocity between dogs and humans,\u201d Wolf said. \u201cThey experience joy and anger and fear and loneliness. Our kids often share very similar stories to the dogs, and we bring that into our classes.\u201d Wolf, who worked in social services for decades, noticed a trend in juvenile recidivism where rearrest rates among incarcerated youth can be as high as 75 percent within three years of release. At the same time, she was volunteering with local animal shelters and rescue groups, trying to keep adoptable animals from being euthanized. \u201cMany of our kids have experienced risk factors that have led them to the lives where they are,\u201d Wolf said. \u201cA lot of our kids come from maybe childhood trauma, it could be poverty, addiction, incarceration of parents or caregivers.\u201d Wolf says that when\u00a0young people in her program\u00a0can understand that they may share a similar story with a dog in need, and help that dog on a path to success, it can transform how they see themselves and their future. \u201cMost of the dogs didn\u2019t really catch my attention until I\u2019d seen this boxer named Quincy,\u201d one UnChained participant recounted. \u201cI learned a lot of social skills and how to control my emotions a lot. To be more focused, more attentive. \u2026 Working with Quincy, obviously seeing him get a second shot, actually gave me a little bit of hope.\u201d The power of the human-animal bond The eight-week program takes place in juvenile detention centers and schools. The students work alongside coaches, a professional dog trainer, and volunteer classroom assistants. A licensed mental health professional is on hand as well. The program fosters empathy, compassion, and responsibility as students train and build trust with their designated dog. At the end of the eight weeks, there is a graduation ceremony where adopters, parents, teachers, and even probation officers gather to celebrate the young people and canines alike. And students get to show guests what they\u2019ve taught their dog. \u201cYou\u2019ve got kids who have experienced a lot of trauma in their lives,\u201d Wolf said. \u201cAnd we get to go in with a blank slate. We just see these kids for who they are.\u201d UnChained, founded in 2011, was born from Wolf\u2019s own passion and personal experiences. When she was in her early 20s and working for a nonprofit in Texas, she was shocked by the animal neglect she witnessed in some areas. \u201cI saw dogs that were tied to trees and left outside with no water available,\u201d Wolf said. \u201cI saw a mother dog with five little puppies covered in mud, emaciated.\u201d Often, she tried to reason with the owner but was repeatedly met with resistance and even violence, she said. And when she called animal control, she was often told there were no legal actions she could take. She says that experience was the motivator to do something to help pets and people. By establishing an emotional connection and teaching young people about a dog\u2019s needs, Wolf says her team sees a change occur. It\u2019s a win-win for both the young person and the animal. \u201cThere is a lighting up of that child\u2019s eyes and face, and we start to see the magic that happens and the understanding by our kids that dogs experience feelings very similar to humans,\u201d she said. Futures filled with hope and possibility For Wolf, positive reinforcement is the key. Students learn from professional dog trainers and implement a clicker method where a dog is praised and rewarded for good behavior with a treat. Wolf says the program also helps its students learn to communicate in a positive way and develop leadership skills. \u201cIt\u2019s starting to shift this young person\u2019s way of thinking and believing and hopefully behaving.\u201d Wolf said. \u201cWhen we put a little bobble-headed chihuahua in the arms of a young man that may weigh 250 pounds, and see his body soften, that\u2019s when we know the work is being done. There\u2019s a vulnerability that the dogs allow the kids to open up with.\u201d The dogs in the program are rescued from shelters and are vetted by a professional dog trainer before they join the program. \u201cThe dogs that we take into the program can be shy. They can be insecure. But they can\u2019t show any signs of aggression,\u201d Wolf said. The dogs live in foster homes while they are in the program so their routine is consistent and stable. Wolf says the foster families are a crucial part of the program. \u201cIf you can commit to 10 to 12 weeks of fostering, this could change the life of not only a dog, but of a student in need as well.\u201d To date, UnChained has worked with more than 450 young people who have helped 220 dogs find forever homes. And while Wolf says she\u2019ll always be a \u201ccrazy dog lady,\u201d she says she\u2019s all in it for the kids. \u201cWe serve kids that have great intellect, great creativity, great compassion,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are our leaders.

The fighting in Concord on April 19, 1775, was immortalized by legendary essayist and poet Ralph Waldo Emerson as \u201cThe Shot Heard Round the World.\u201d National Park Service archaeologists recently found five musket balls fired that day by colonial militia members, according to a news release from the federal agency. \u201cIt\u2019s incredible that we can stand here and hold what amounts to just a few seconds of history that changed the world almost 250 years ago,\u201d Jarrad Fuoss, a ranger at Minute Man National Historical Park and a historic weapons specialist, said in the release. \u201cThese musket balls can be considered collectively as \u2018The Shot Heard Round the World,\u2019 and it is incredible that they have survived this long.\u201d The projectiles were found near the site of the North Bridge where British soldiers faced off against the militia members in the famed three-minute battle in Concord, the park service said. \u201cFurther analysis of the musket balls indicates that each one was fired from the opposite side of the river and not dropped during the process of reloading,\u201d park service officials said. The recently discovered five musket balls will be on display at the park Saturday. The fighting that led to the birth of the United States began that 1775 day with a short skirmish in Lexington, Massachusetts, in which eight militia members were killed and 10 were wounded. The British continued to move to Concord to search a home for military supplies, leaving a contingent of about 100 soldiers at the North Bridge. As militia members approached, shots were fired by the British troops. Historians say 18 men were killed or wounded in the battle at the bridge. The fighting that day at Lexington, Concord and other sites took the lives of more than 120 people.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/09/us/revolutionary-war-first-day-musket-balls-found/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/14/2024", "section": "us"}}

Alexa Stakely, 29, was picking up her 6-year-old child from her babysitter\u2019s apartment just before 1:30 a.m. ET on Thursday when she realized she needed to go back inside to get an item \u201cfrom the babysitter who she met just inside the front door,\u201d the police report stated.

He was \u201cfunny and energetic\u201d and deeply loved his children, Harmon said. But her husband, D\u2019Vontaye Mitchell, will never see his children again: The 43-year-old died on June 30 after he was\u00a0pinned down by hotel security guards\u00a0outside a Hyatt Regency hotel in Milwaukee in an incident partially captured on video. \u201cI\u2019m angry about it,\u201d Harmon said of her husband\u2019s death. \u201cI\u2019m broken, empty, honestly.\u201d Police have referred four charges of felony murder in Mitchell\u2019s death to the district attorney\u2019s office, Milwaukee Police told CNN in a statement Friday. A homicide investigation is underway and the full results of Mitchell\u2019s autopsy are pending. William F. Sulton, an attorney for the Mitchell family, told CNN he is confident that the Milwaukee County District Attorney\u2019s office \u201cwill make the right decision\u201d and charge the hotel employees involved. \u201cI do believe criminal charges will be issued in this case,\u201d Sulton said, adding, \u201cI want to be very clear that this involves more than just four persons.\u201d \u201cMr. Mitchell was beaten with a broom by a front desk manager, who you see on camera,\u201d he said. \u201cYou see a third security official who could have intervened and stopped this.\u201d \u201cThere were so many opportunities, and at every turn, Hyatt staff attacked him,\u201d Sulton said. Sulton said that while Wisconsin does have a citizen\u2019s arrest law, it requires observation of an ongoing felony. \u201cThere was no crime committed by Mr. Mitchell at all. And in fact, we know that Mr. Mitchell was running away from a security officer who had attacked him, and that he was retreating the entire time,\u201d the attorney said. \u201cAnd despite Mr. Mitchell trying to retreat, which included leaving the hotel after seeking refuge there, that he was repeatedly beaten to the point in which he was killed.\u201d Sulton said he met with the Milwaukee County District Attorney\u2019s Office for several hours Wednesday and two hours Thursday morning to discuss the case. Aimbridge Hospitality, which operates the downtown hotel, has said that they suspended and then fired the \u201chotel associates\u201d involved in the incident. It\u2019s unclear how many employees were fired and if they include the security guards seen pinning Mitchell down. \u201cThe conduct we saw from several associates on June 30 violated our policies and procedures, and does not reflect our values as an organization or the behaviors we expect from our associates,\u201d Aimbridge Hospitality said in a Thursday statement about Mitchell\u2019s death. The case has sparked criticism and accusations of racism, particularly given the parallels between Mitchel\u2019s death and other instances in which Black men have died at the hands of police and other authority figures. May 25 marked the 4-year anniversary of George Floyd\u2019s murder by White police officer Derek Chauvin, igniting widespread protests across the country. What we know about Mitchell\u2019s death Many of the circumstances surrounding Mitchell\u2019s death remain unclear, including what led to his encounter with the security guards, how long it took officers to arrive on the scene, and what Mitchell was doing at the hotel. Police allege Mitchell \u201ccaused a disturbance,\u201d prompting security guards to escort him out of the hotel,\u00a0according to\u00a0a statement\u00a0from civil rights attorney Ben Crump, who is also representing the Mitchell family. Security guards and others then pinned Mitchell to the ground. Part of a video posted on social media shows Mitchell grunting and pleading with the guards, repeatedly saying \u201cplease\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d One guard, who appears to be White, can be heard saying \u201cstay down\u201d and \u201cstop fighting,\u201d as the others, who appear to be people of color, hold Mitchell down, the video shows. The same guard calls out to witnesses, \u201cThis is what happens when you go into the ladies room.\u201d The district attorney\u2019s office is awaiting the full results of Mitchell\u2019s autopsy, which will help inform the police investigation into his death and allow the office to evaluate what happened before his death \u201cfrom the perspective of potential criminal liability,\u201d District Attorney John Chisholm said Wednesday in a statement. Crump, in a statement posted on X last week, said: \u201cIt is deeply troubling that we have lost another Black man in an encounter with security personnel, raising serious concerns about the use of force, lack of accountability, and absence of mental health considerations.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/13/us/dvontaye-mitchell-milwaukee-wisconsin-death/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/14/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_07_10_us_alabama-death-row-inmate-autopsy-lawsuit", "text": "Alabama will forgo an autopsy on a Muslim death row inmate who sued the state, saying the procedure following his execution by lethal injection next week would violate his religious beliefs. Keith Gavin, who is set to be executed next Thursday or Friday, said in the lawsuit an \u201cinvasive autopsy\u201d violated his \u201csincerely held religious beliefs,\u201d as well as Alabama state law, according to the complaint filed by his attorneys last month. Gavin is a devout Muslim, the complaint said, and his religion \u201cteaches that the human body is a sacred temple, which must be kept whole.\u201d An autopsy, he argued, would desecrate his body and \u201cviolate the sanctity of keeping his human body intact\u201d along with his right to the free exercise of his religion. On Friday, Alabama Department of Corrections spokesperson Kelly Windham Betts told CNN: \u201cNo autopsy will be performed on Keith Edmund Gavin. His remains will be picked up by the attending funeral home.\u201d CNN has reached out to Gavin\u2019s attorneys for comment. Among those named in the lawsuit were Escambia County District Attorney Steve Billy, Alabama Department of Corrections Commissioner John Hamm and Terry Raybon, warden of the William C. Holman Correctional Facility where Gavin is on death row. \u201cWe are working on a resolution,\u201d the office of Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall told CNN this week.  The complaint had sought a judicial order preventing the defendants from performing the autopsy and requiring them \u201cto respect Mr. Gavin\u2019s constitutional rights and sincerely held religious beliefs.\u201d The lawsuit claimed Gavin\u2019s attorneys had repeatedly attempted to reach state officials in charge of the autopsy process regarding his request for his \u201cearthly remains to be handled consistent with his faith,\u201d but had received no response. Immediately after Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey signed Gavin\u2019s April 25 letter setting his execution date, the lawsuit said the defendants failed to respond to phone calls, emails and in-person visits or have declined to speak with Gavin\u2019s attorneys. Under Alabama law, a medical examiner is required to investigate any death that takes place in any penal institution in the state, and the law gives discretion to state officials to order a postmortem autopsy if the death is \u201cunlawful, suspicious or unnatural.\u201d \u201cThis law is intended to establish with certainty the cause of death in any such event. After Mr. Gavin\u2019s execution, there will be no question as to who or what caused Mr. Gavin\u2019s death. The State will execute him by lethal injection,\u201d the lawsuit argued. On Thursday, the Council on American-Islamic Relations \u2013 the largest Muslim civil rights and advocacy organization in the country \u2013 called on Alabama officials to accept Gavin\u2019s request. \u201cIn Islamic beliefs, autopsies are generally viewed as impermissible mutilation of the deceased but are permissible in cases of necessity and only to the extent required,\u201d CAIR said in a statement. \u201cThe religious freedom guaranteed to every American in our founding documents does not cease to apply behind bars,\u201d CAIR Research and Advocacy Director Corey Saylor said. \u201cWe urge Alabama state officials to accept Mr. Gavin\u2019s request that his body not be autopsied after execution.\u201d Alabama has faced scrutiny over its executions after multiple failed lethal injections prompted an internal review of the state\u2019s capital punishment system in 2022. Ivey asked the state Department of Corrections to conduct a \u201ctop-to-bottom review of the state\u2019s execution process\u201d after the problems came into the national spotlight, CNN previously reported. The state resumed executions last spring after the review was completed.

{"id": "2024_07_12_us_louisiana-truck-driver-baby-rescue-beryl", "text": "A truck driver found a 1-year-old alive in a ditch off an interstate highway in Louisiana this week, a day after the boy\u2019s 4-year-old brother was found dead near the same freeway in what investigators think was a case of abandonment around the time tropical storm conditions hit the area, authorities said. The boys\u2019 mother, a Louisiana resident, has been arrested in Mississippi and faces murder and other charges, accused of abandoning the children in Louisiana, authorities said Thursday. A Louisiana sheriff, who says he believes the 1-year-old spent two days along Interstate 10, including while Hurricane Beryl or its weaker iterations battered the western Gulf Coast region with rain and strong wind \u2013 is praising the truck driver for seeing the child and stopping to pick up him up Tuesday. \u201cWe look at this 1-year-old as our miracle baby, (because) he was still alive,\u201d Calcasieu Parish Sheriff Stitch Guillory said this week. \u201cThis kid spent two days out in the weather on the side of the highway. \u2026 Thank God that trucker (saw) him.\u201d An investigation began Monday afternoon, when the 4-year-old boy\u2019s body was found floating in water behind a rest stop off I-10 in western Louisiana\u2019s Calcasieu Parish, just across the Texas state line, the sheriff\u2019s office said. No cause of death was immediately announced. That day, Beryl made landfall in Texas as a hurricane and weakened to a tropical storm and tropical depression as it impacted Louisiana, dropping rain and delivering wind gusts of up to 60 mph to the parish, CNN meteorologists say. Detectives eventually learned the 4-year-old had last been seen on Saturday with his mother, Aaliyah Jack, 25, of Lake Charles, and his 1-year-old brother, the sheriff\u2019s office said. Police in Meridian, Mississippi, then found Jack without the 1-year-old, and she was arrested there initially on suspicion of failing to report a missing child, authorities said. And on Tuesday morning, the 1-year-old turned up \u2013 alive \u2013 along I-10 back in Louisiana, authorities said. \u2018That looks like a baby\u2019 Truck driver Reginald Walton was driving on I-10 when he saw something \u201cto the right, over in the \u2026 embankment,\u201d he told CNN affiliate KADN, adding that he assumed it was a doll that someone had tossed out of a vehicle. \u201cBut as I was passing by, I saw it move, and I say, \u2018Hey, that looks like a baby,\u2019\u201d Walton, of Texas, told KADN. Walton was traveling 60-75 mph, and it took him about a quarter of a mile to stop the truck, he said. He called 911, stopped the truck and ran back, he told KADN. \u201cSure enough, there was a little boy sitting down the embankment there. As I approached him, he smiled at me, and then he stood up and started crying and walked toward me,\u201d Walton said. The 1-year-old was found near mile marker 10 \u2013 about 9 miles from the rest stop where his brother had been found dead the day before, the sheriff\u2019s office said. Deputies identified the boy as Jack\u2019s 1-year-old son. He was taken to a hospital and later released to the state Department of Children and Family Services, Calcasieu Parish Sheriff\u2019s Office spokesperson Kayla Vincent told CNN. On Thursday, Jack \u2013 still in custody in Mississippi \u2013 was charged in Louisiana with second-degree murder, cruelty to a juvenile and two counts of failure to report a missing child, the sheriff\u2019s department said. It is unknown if she has an attorney. Though Guillory said he believed the 1-year-old spent two days along I-10 \u2013 which would have included Monday, as Beryl swept through the area \u2013\u00a0the sheriff\u2019s office has not said whether investigators know precisely when the siblings were left. Walton, meanwhile, told KADN he didn\u2019t feel like he was a hero. \u201cI just feel it was God\u2019s will for me to be in the right place at the right time,\u201d he told KADN. Grandmother: \u2018I just want my grandbaby back\u2019 Conswella Jack, Aaliyah Jack\u2019s mother and a grandmother to the children, told CNN the last time she saw the kids was Saturday at her mother\u2019s funeral, after which her daughter took them. Conswella Jack said she and her daughter had an agreement in which the grandmother would generally take care of the two boys, but Aaliyah Jack was free to see them whenever she wanted. Conswella Jack learned of her 4-year-old grandson\u2019s death on Tuesday after his paternal grandmother called to tell her, she said. Shortly after, a detective called her to confirm the death. She does not know what led up to the boy\u2019s death or how her 1-year-old grandson ended up on the side of the road, she told CNN. \u201cI don\u2019t know how anything like this occurred. \u2026 I know at this moment, I just want my grandbaby back,\u201d the grandmother said. Conswella was living in Houston when she heard the news, and has since relocated to Lake Charles, she said. She has been calling child protective services daily to receive updates on her surviving grandson, she said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to think. I buried my mother on Saturday, and now I learn this,\u201d Conswella Jack said. She described her 4-year-old grandson as \u201can awesome kid.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m sorry baby \u2026 that (you\u2019re) gone. So sorry,\u201d she said.

{"id": "2024_07_12_business_att-customers-data-breach-protection", "text": "If you were an AT&T cellphone customer in 2022, your call data was possibly breached to bad actors.  AT&T said Friday that data was breached from \u201cnearly all\u201d of its cellular customers and the customers of wireless providers that used its network between May 1, 2022, and October 31, 2022. The records of a \u201cvery small number\u201d of customers from January 2, 2023, were also breached, AT&T said. The company\u00a0blamed\u00a0an \u201cillegal download\u201d on a third-party cloud platform that it learned about in April \u2014 just as AT&T was grappling with an\u00a0unrelated major data leak. AT&T listed approximately 110 million wireless subscribers as of the end of 2022.\u00a0Here\u2019s what that means for the millions of Americans that use AT&T\u2019s cellular service. What\u2019s at risk Hackers did not get any names, addresses or Social Security numbers. What they did get is metadata \u2014 call logs that contain a record of every number AT&T customers called or texted (including customers of other wireless networks), the number of times they interacted and the call duration. A cybercriminal could now identify relationships among phone numbers, a useful data point for hackers trying to make their scams more believable. For example, a hacker could see that a customer is in constant contact with a big bank\u2019s line and could send a phishing attempt posing as the bank. The hacker could text the customer saying, \u201cThis is Bank of America. We have some suspicious activity on your account. Click this link to review the charges, or call this number,\u201d said John Dwyer, director of security research at Binary Defense, a cybersecurity solutions firm. Or the hacker could pose as someone the customer has a personal relationship with, like a friend or family member. The age of artificial intelligence makes this even more pressing, according to Collin Walke, cybersecurity and data privacy partner at Hall Estill. \u201cOnce they know who you\u2019ve been communicating with, it allows deep fakes and those sorts of hacks to occur much easier,\u201d Walke said. Some customers\u2019 cell tower ID numbers were also exposed, which could help some bad actors track down geolocations, Walke said. That could also make these hacking attempts more believable. What customers should do Cellphone users should always be careful about phishing and other scam attempts, especially as hackers become more and more sophisticated. But AT&T customers should be hypersensitive to phone calls and text messages where they\u2019re being asked to do things like call a number, click a link or transfer money. That includes requests from what appears to be a number that you normally communicate with, Dwyer said. \u201cIf someone calls or texts you and asks you to do something, make sure you call them back to verify that it\u2019s actually them,\u201d Dwyer said. Of course, without stricter cybersecurity regulation, there isn\u2019t much customers can do to protect against data breaches. That responsibility lies with the federal government and giant telecom companies, which experts say widely go unchecked. \u201cI don\u2019t think we should have an expectation that everyday Americans should be on the front lines of defending themselves for making sure the businesses they interact with have mandatory minimum cybersecurity in place,\u201d Eric Noonan, CEO of cybersecurity provider CyberSheath said.

{"id": "business_economy_transgender-americans-economy", "text": "Quinn Merriss, an 18-year-old who identifies as transgender and non-binary, barely makes ends meet. Merriss was kicked out of their home after years of tension and arguments with their parents over being transgender. They now live independently without any financial support from relatives, working as a server earning $5.50 an hour plus tips. \u201cI\u2019m living paycheck to paycheck,\u201d Merriss, who lives in an apartment in Cincinnati, told CNN. They manage to scrape by thanks to a housing assistance program, Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Merriss\u2019 plight illustrates the harsh economic realities of millions of Americans who identify as transgender and/or non-binary. The evidence from research and surveys is unmistakable: People whose gender identity does not match their sex at birth are more likely to experience financial hardships than the general population. (Some transgender people identify as \u201cnon-binary,\u201d which means they don\u2019t conform to one particular gender.) They deal with \u201clower employment rates, lower household incomes, higher rates of poverty, greater public assistance use, and increased likelihood of food insecurity,\u201d a 2022 study found. There are at least 5.3 million individuals who identify as transgender and/or non-binary in the United States, about the size of the Phoenix metropolitan area, according to the Pew Research Center. In interviews with CNN, economists, researchers and transgender people themselves say \u201ctransphobia,\u201d or negative beliefs and attitudes about trans people, is to blame. Transitioning genders can also cost tens of thousands of dollars, and being in the closet is well documented to take a toll on mental health. What the statistics show The dire economic straits of transgender and non-binary people hasn\u2019t been explored for very long, though much has been uncovered in recent decades. \u201cWe know that transgender people have been experiencing so many economic disparities ever since there has been data collected on them, going back 30 or 40 years,\u201d said Kevin Nadal, a distinguished professor of psychology at City University of New York\u2019s Graduate Center. \u201cIf you see a trans person and they make you feel uncomfortable, that\u2019s because you either haven\u2019t been exposed to them much before or because you have very rigid ideas about gender,\u201d Nadal said. Pew has also found that most Americans believe that a person\u2019s gender is determined by their sex at birth, but favor protecting them from discrimination. The United States Transgender Survey, conducted by the National Center for Transgender Equality, is releasing full results from \u201can unprecedented\u201d 92,329 respondents later this year, its latest iteration since the previous survey in 2015. A preliminary analysis showed that living and working conditions remain as tough as ever. More than a third of transgender people surveyed (34%) said they were experiencing poverty, and 30% said they\u2019ve been homeless at least once in their lives. The unemployment rate among the transgender people surveyed was 18%, more than four times the current national rate. The Census Bureau puts the poverty line for a single person at $14,880 in 2022, the year of the survey. The pivotal role of family support A person\u2019s family plays a crucial role in their financial health, economists say, even with something as simple as providing shelter in adolescence or early adulthood. That safety net is often non-existent for transgender people. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot about how you start out in life,\u201d said Jody Herman, senior scholar of public policy at the Williams Institute at the University of California, Los Angeles. \u201cWe\u2019ve found that trans people who had been kicked out of their homes or had family rejection experiences were more likely to be in an unstable economic position.\u201d Jay Woodman, a 29-year-old transgender man, fled his immediate family in Greenville, South Carolina, about six years ago with his partner, Alexander Taylor. The couple is currently living with Taylor\u2019s parents in southern Maryland. Woodman said he has \u201cno contact\u201d with any of his relatives after it became clear they don\u2019t support his gender identity. \u201cUnless you have financial help in some way from parents, grandparents or friends, forget about buying a house in this area,\u201d Woodman said. \u201c(Alexander) and I were even priced out of a trailer community with how bad our financial situation was a few short years ago, when he was a full time office assistant and music instructor and I worked a part-time minimum wage food service job because it was all I could get at the time.\u201d The US housing market has been notoriously tough for years, with rents rising faster than incomes and home prices recently soaring to a record high as mortgage rates remain painfully elevated. First-time buyers often receive financial assistance from family to purchase a home, according to a realtor.com survey. Many parents also help pay for higher education. Research shows that\u2019s simply not the case for most transgender and non-binary people. Merriss said they dream of attending college but have put that on hold to work full time. Disrespect while on the job is par for the course Sarah Elizabeth Isbell, 62, began to transition from male to female in 2000, eventually getting gender reassignment surgery in 2008. Isbell currently works in an administrative support role at a nonprofit organization, but she holds a law degree from the University of Oklahoma. Isbell said she worked at a civil rights law firm in the late 2000s, after she already began to transition, but got fired shortly after a humiliating incident at the workplace. \u201cI showed up to work one day wearing sandals with my toes painted red and I got ridiculed by the boss, a female boss, in front of the whole office at lunch,\u201d Isbell said. \u201cShe said \u2018Would you go to court that way?\u2019 and when I said that I don\u2019t see an issue\u2026 She just let into me relentlessly about how men can\u2019t dress like that.\u201d \u201cThat was really mortifying,\u201d she added. Isbell said she has struggled to find another job as a lawyer. \u201cI did civil rights law. But after my transition, even my civll rights lawyer friends didn\u2019t want to hire me. I kept being told that juries and clients with cases in front of juries won\u2019t accept a transgender trial lawyer,\u201d she said. in 2020, the Supreme Court ruled in a landmark civil rights case that employers are prohibited from discriminating against LGBTQ employees. The case before the nation\u2019s highest court, Bostock v. Clayton County, was a consolidation of three similar cases around the country. One of them was brought by Aimee Stephens, who came out as a transgender woman in 2013 while working as a funeral director in a suburb near Detroit. She informed her employer in a letter that she would be coming in dressed as a woman and was fired shortly after, which led to Stephens\u2019 lawsuit. Stephens passed away a month before the Supreme Court\u2019s decision. \u201cTrans folks have been protected (at the workplace) under federal law for four years now, but it\u2019s not clear how well that\u2019s working,\u201d Michael Martell, an economics professor at Bard College, told CNN. \u201cTrans people face stigma throughout their lives, so it\u2019s certainly fair to say that labor market discrimination is a contributing factor to their disadvantages in life.\u201d The early report of the US Transgender Survey showed that 11% of respondents said they had been fired, forced to resign or been laid off because of their gender identity or expression. And transgender people say they still deal with disrespect while on the job. A common issue for transgender people is being misgendered, or referred to with terms that don\u2019t reflect their chosen gender identity, which is sometimes done by accident and other times purposefully. Merriss, Woodman and Isbell all said they\u2019ve been misgendered at the workplace. A wave of anti-transgender bills across states A historic wave of bills in state legislatures across the nation aims to ban access to gender-affirming health care for transgender youth and regulate curricula in public schools, including discussions on gender identity. Last year, there were at least 510 anti-LGBTQ bills introduced by lawmakers in various states, most of them controlled by Republicans, according to American Civil Liberties Union data. That set a record and was nearly three times the number of similar bills introduced in 2022. More than two-thirds of the 167 anti-LGBTQ bills introduced last year related to health care were aimed at blocking trans minors from getting gender-affirming care. According to Trans Legislation Tracker, 40 anti-trans state bills have so far been signed into law this year, in addition to eight that have been passed by lawmakers but haven\u2019t been approved or vetoed by a governor yet. Despite the economic struggles and hostile political landscape across the country, researchers and transgender people say that being your authentic self is invaluable. An overwhelming 94% of respondents in the latest US Transgender Survey said they \u201creported that they were either \u2018a lot more satisfied\u2019 or \u2018a little more satisfied\u2019 with their life\u201d after transitioning genders. \u201cIt\u2019s awful some days, but I would not give up being this way,\u201d Merriss said. \u201cI\u2019ve gotten away from the family toxic environment, and it\u2019s been so helpful seeing celebrities and characters in media being portrayed positively as a trans person.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/business/economy/transgender-americans-economy/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/14/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_07_13_us_cape-cod-dolphin-stranding-largest-us-history", "text": "The stranding of more than 140 dolphins off Cape Cod last month has been confirmed as the largest mass stranding of the mammals in United States history, animal rescuers say. A final review of data and aerial imagery of the mass stranding event near Wellfleet, Massachusetts, believed to have begun June 28, revealed 146 dolphins were involved, the International Fund for Animal Welfare announced Thursday. Wellfleet is located on Cape Cod\u2019s northeastern arm. The dolphins were found stranded in the shallow mud flats of Wellfleet in an area called the \u201cGut,\u201d or Great Island at the Herring River. \u201cWe believe 102 survived the multi-day event, which is (about) a 70% survival rate,\u201d according to Stacey Hedman, communications director for the global animal welfare and conservation non-profit, which rescues, rehabilitates and releases animals. Seven of the dolphins were euthanized and 37 died naturally, according to Hedman. The organization said last month the stranding of what was initially said to be around 125 Atlantic white-sided dolphins in the area could possibly be \u201cthe largest single mass stranding event\u201d in the organization\u2019s history, CNN previously reported. Dolphins, whales or porpoises are considered stranded \u201cwhen they are found dead, either on the beach or floating in the water, or alive on the beach and unable to return to the water,\u201d according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. \u201cThis rescue had many challenges due to the number of dolphins, the large size of many of the animals, how spread out they were over a large area, the difficult mud conditions and the complicated locations from which we could reach them,\u201d said Misty Niemeyer, stranding coordinator for the organization, in a statement last month. The organization said the mass stranding event was \u201cconsidered closed\u201d by July 8, by which time more than 100 dolphins had been returned to their homes in deeper waters. The satellite tracking tags attached to the dolphins showed they were swimming a safe distance away offshore, according to Hedman. \u201cWe have been receiving reports from whale watch vessels that have seen some of the dolphins \u2013 identified with temporary markings \u2013 now swimming among other groups of hundreds of other dolphins that had not been part of the stranding \u2013 a happy image!\u201d Hedman said. Although two prior events in Hawaii and Florida Keys show dolphin species circling in shallow water, the most recent occurrence marks the highest number of dolphins beached in a single stranding event, according to the organization. More dolphins get stranded along Cape Cod\u2019s 12-mile stretch of shoreline than any other location worldwide, according to the organization.

{"id": "2024_07_11_us_dvontaye-mitchell-death-milwaukee", "text": "Hotel employees have been fired following the death last month of a Black man after he was pinned down by hotel security guards outside a Hyatt Regency in Milwaukee in an incident partially captured by witness video. \u201cThe conduct we saw from several associates on June 30 violated our policies and procedures, and does not reflect our values as an organization or the behaviors we expect from our associates,\u201d Aimbridge Hospitality, which operates the downtown hotel, said Thursday in a statement about the death of D\u2019Vontaye Mitchell. \u201cFollowing review of their actions, their employment has been terminated,\u201d the statement added. \u201cWe will continue our independent investigation and do everything we can to support law enforcement with their investigation into this tragic incident.\u201d It\u2019s unclear how many \u201chotel associates\u201d were fired and if they include the security guards involved in the Mitchell incident. Those security guards initially were suspended as Aimbridge Hospitality completed its investigation, a Hyatt spokesperson told CNN on Monday. Police have referred four charges of felony murder in Mitchell\u2019s death, a police spokesperson told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. Police have been in consultation with the Milwaukee County District Attorney\u2019s Office since July 5 and have subsequently referred the charges but the DA\u2019s office has not yet made a decision, Sgt. Efrain Cornejo told the Journal Sentinel. CNN has reached out to the Milwaukee Police\u00a0Department and the DA\u2019s office for additional information. Mitchell, 43, was at the Hyatt Regency on June 30, when police allege he \u201ccaused a disturbance,\u201d prompting security guards to escort him out of the hotel,\u00a0according to a statement\u00a0from civil rights attorney Ben Crump, who represents the Mitchell family. Security guards and others then pinned Mitchell to the ground, part of a video posted on social media shows. Mitchell grunts and pleads with the guards, repeatedly saying \u201cplease\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d it shows. One guard, who appears to be White, can be heard saying, \u201cStay down,\u201d and \u201cStop fighting,\u201d as the others, who appear to be people of color, hold Mitchell down, the video shows. The same guard calls out to witnesses, \u201cThis is what happens when you go into the ladies room.\u201d When police arrived, Mitchell was unresponsive and pronounced dead despite lifesaving measures, Milwaukee Police told CNN on Tuesday without mentioning Mitchell by name. It\u2019s unclear what led up to Mitchell\u2019s encounter with the security guards, how long it took officers to arrive on the scene, and what Mitchell was doing at the hotel. The encounter comes as the\u00a0use of force\u00a0\u2013 particularly\u00a0against people of color\u00a0\u2013\u00a0by police and others in authority roles remains under scrutiny nearly four years after\u00a0protests flared nationwide\u00a0following the murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer. \u201cThe decision to fire the Hyatt security personnel highlights how unjustified D\u2019Vontaye\u2019s death truly was,\u201d Crump said Thursday in a statement. \u201cAfter viewing the video from inside the hotel with the DA\u2019s office, it is completely understandable and appropriate that these personnel have been fired for their assault, battery, and excessive force on D\u2019Vontaye, which led to his death.\u201d \u2018Your daddy was somebody,\u2019 Sharpton says in eulogy \u201cToday, D\u2019Vontaye\u2019s family will bury him with a heavy heart, and while his family will never be able to bring him back, today is about honoring and remembering the man he was,\u201d Crump said in a statement prior to the funeral. During Mitchell\u2019s funeral Thursday, family members approached the lectern to honor his life while reminiscing on shared memories and what they loved about him \u2013 while continuing to push for justice in his name. Mitchell was known for his creativity in the kitchen and was a lover of anything artistic, according to his obituary, which was read during Thursday\u2019s funeral. \u201cD\u2019Vontaye was an avid family man who filled his time visiting his kids and family, and he lit up every face with joy when he entered the room,\u201d it continued. The Rev. Al Sharpton delivered a eulogy in which he offered to pay for Mitchell\u2019s funeral before pledging $5,000 to each of Mitchell\u2019s children for their education. \u201cI want them (Mitchell\u2019s children) to know I, and people, will tell you later in life about your daddy, but I want you to know your daddy was somebody,\u201d Sharpton said. While Sharpton said the firing of hotel employees was a good move, it\u2019s not enough to bring justice for Mitchell\u2019s loved ones. \u201cI thought after George Floyd and we fought till three cops went to jail, I thought y\u2019all learned you can\u2019t put your knees on our necks,\u201d Sharpton said. A homicide investigation is underway Hyatt has joined Mitchell\u2019s family \u201cin their calls for transparency, accountability and justice for this senseless tragedy,\u201d the hotel chain said Wednesday, adding criminal charges should be filed against the Aimbridge Hospitality employees involved. The local prosecutor is investigating Mitchell\u2019s death as a homicide, he said Wednesday, but Milwaukee Police were not considering the incident as a criminal investigation because there wasn\u2019t any evidence of \u201cblunt force,\u201d Crump has said. The Milwaukee County District Attorney\u2019s office is awaiting the full results of Mitchell\u2019s autopsy, which \u201cwill inform the ongoing police investigation into\u201d his death and \u201callow our office to comprehensively evaluate the actions leading up to\u201d his death \u201cfrom the perspective of potential criminal liability,\u201d District Attorney John Chisholm said Wednesday in a statement. Crump\u2019s office obtained an affidavit from an unidentified hotel employee who claimed he reluctantly helped hold down Mitchell after being ordered to do so by a security guard, the attorney said.

{"id": "2024_07_12_us_on-nyc-beaches-angry-birds-fight-drones-patrolling-for-sharks-and-struggling-swimmers-ap", "text": "A fleet of drones patrolling New York City\u2019s beaches for signs of sharks and struggling swimmers is drawing backlash from an aggressive group of seaside residents: local shorebirds. Since the drones began flying in May, flocks of birds have repeatedly swarmed the devices, forcing the police department and other city agencies to adjust their flight plans. While the attacks have slowed, they have not stopped completely, fueling concern from wildlife experts about the impact on threatened species nesting along the coast. Veronica  Welsh, a wildlife coordinator at the Parks Department, said the birds  were \u201cvery annoyed by the drones\u201d from the moment they arrived on the  beach. \u201cThey will fly at it, they\u2019ll swoop at it, they\u2019ll be  vocalizing,\u201d Welsh said. \u201cThey think they\u2019re defending their chicks from  a predator.\u201d No birds have been harmed, but officials say there have been several close calls. The drones, which come equipped with inflatable life rafts that can be dropped on distressed swimmers, have yet to conduct any rescues. They spotted their first shark on Thursday, resulting in a closure of most of the beach. City officials said the \u201cswarming incidents\u201d have been primarily carried out by American oystercatchers. The shorebird, known for its striking orange bill, lays its eggs this time of year in the sand on Rockaway Beach. While its population has improved in recent decades, federal authorities consider the species a \u201chigh conservation concern.\u201d The birds eventually may grow habituated to the devices, which can stretch over 3 feet (nearly a meter) long and emit a loud hum as they take flight, said David Bird, a professor of wildlife biology at McGill University. But he was quick to raise a far more dire possibility: that the  drones could prompt a stress response in some birds that causes them to  flee the beach and abandon their eggs, as several thousand elegant terns  did following a recent drone crash in San Diego. \u201cWe don\u2019t know a lot about what sort of distance is required to protect the birds,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we do know there are birds on this beach that are highly endangered. If they abandon their nests because of the drones, that would be a disaster.\u201d On Rockaway Beach, a popular summertime destination for New Yorkers, American oystercatchers share their habitat with multiple tern species of water birds, as well as piping plovers, a small, sand-colored bird that is the city\u2019s only federally designated endangered species. Local officials closely monitor the plovers each summer, barring beachgoers \u2014 and drones \u2014 from the stretches of sand where they primarily nest. The city\u2019s Emergency  Management Department, which also flies drones over the beach, flagged  the coastal conflict last month to other drone operators in the police  and fire department, who agreed to launch the devices further from  oystercatcher nesting areas. \u201cWe pointed out that there\u2019s a nest  here and there\u2019s two angry parents who don\u2019t want you anywhere near  their eggs or their babies,\u201d said Natalie Grybauskas, the agency\u2019s  assistant commissioner. Since then, agencies have been holding briefings on the issue, a departure from their usual work on disasters like fires and building collapses. \u201cIt\u2019s rare that you have to learn about the life cycles of baby birds,\u201d Grybauskas said. But even after the city adjusted its flight range, beachgoers said they witnessed groups of birds rushing at the drones. New York City is not alone turning to drones to patrol its waters. Following a spate of shark bites last summer, a similar effort  was launched by officials on Long Island. Those devices are smaller and  quieter and do not have flotation devices. In recent years, lifeguards  in Australia also have used drones to monitor sharks and to conduct  rescue operations. New York City Mayor Eric Adams, a devoted drone enthusiast,  has touted the new drone program as a \u201cgreat addition to saving the  lives of those that we lose over the summer,\u201d especially as the city  struggles to hire lifeguards to staff its beaches. Four people have drowned off city beaches this summer, matching the total number of swimming deaths from last year. After two teenagers disappeared while swimming off a beach adjacent to Rockaway, the NYPD flew its drones as part of the search mission. Both bodies eventually washed up on the shoreline. The fire department\u2019s drones also have captured footage of lifeguards assisting swimmers on Rockaway Beach struggling in a rip tide. Christopher  Allieri, founder of the NYC Plover Project, a bird protection group,  praised the city for taking an innovative approach to water safety. But  he stressed additional precautions were necessary to ensure the drones  weren\u2019t harming the shorebird population. \u201cWildlife in New York  is often an afterthought,\u201d he said. \u201cWe should be asking ourselves how  we can use this technology in a way that works for all New Yorkers, and  that includes those with feathers.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/12/us/on-nyc-beaches-angry-birds-fight-drones-patrolling-for-sharks-and-struggling-swimmers-ap/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/14/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_07_09_us_yellowstone-national-park-gunman-threats", "text": "The gunman who opened fire in Yellowstone National Park last week, leaving one ranger injured, had held a woman against her will and said he planned to carry out a mass shooting at July 4th events outside the park, authorities say. The shooter, identified as 28-year-old Samson Lucas Bariah Fussner, died after an exchange of gunfire with law enforcement, the US National Park Service said in a news release Tuesday. The injured park ranger was flown to a nearby regional hospital in stable condition and has since been released, according to the agency. The shooting happened at Canyon Village, a cluster of lodges and cabins inside the park, north of Yellowstone Lake and away from the park\u2019s busiest tourist areas. Yellowstone\u2019s 911 dispatch center received a call just after midnight on July 4 reporting that a woman had been held against her will by an armed man in a residence at the village, the park service said. The woman also told law enforcement rangers Fussner \u201cthreatened to kill her and others, including plans to allegedly carry out a mass shooting(s) at July 4th\u00a0events outside the park,\u201d according to the release. Rangers found the suspect\u2019s vehicle unoccupied in the Canyon area and determined he was likely armed and dangerous, the release said. \u201cWith the individual\u202fat large,\u202flaw enforcement rangers were strategically deployed to protect areas with park visitors and employees while searching for Fussner, and the park\u2019s 911 dispatch center notified surrounding jurisdictions,\u201d according to the National Park Service. By the early morning hours that day, more than 20 rangers were searching for Fussner and working to protect people in the park, the agency said. At around 8 a.m., rangers stationed near the Canyon Lodge dining facility located Fussner as he walked toward the service entrance while firing a semi-automatic rifle, according to the release. Roughly 200 people were inside the building as several rangers exchanged gunfire with Fussner, who was shot and died at the scene, authorities said. Fussner \u2013 of Milton, Florida \u2013 was employed by Xanterra Parks and Resorts, a private business authorized to operate in Yellowstone, the release stated. The FBI is leading the investigation into the incident, the park service said, and will be reviewed by the United States Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of Wyoming. The park service is also working with the FBI to offer victim and witness support. The law enforcement rangers who were involved in the shooting have been placed on paid administrative leave while the incident is investigated, in accordance with park service policy, the agency said. Body-worn camera footage of the shooting will also be released within 30 days, it said. \u201cThanks to the heroic actions of our law enforcement rangers, many lives were saved here last Thursday,\u201d said Yellowstone National Park Superintendent Cam Sholly. \u201cThese rangers immediately confronted this shooter and took decisive action to ensure he was no longer a threat to public safety. \u201cWe are working now to provide maximum support to those involved and their families.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/09/us/yellowstone-national-park-gunman-threats/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/14/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_07_13_business_boeing-slap-on-wrist", "text": "Boeing faces up to $487 million in fines as part of its anticipated guilty plea to a felony charge related to two fatal crashes of the 737 Max. Critics of the deal, however, are calling it a \u201cslap on the wrist.\u201d While corporate guilty pleas by companies the size of Boeing are rare, and there are some terms of the plea agreement that Boeing leadership undoubtedly found onerous, the deal does show the limits of corporate criminal charges. Boeing agreed to plead guilty to a charge that it defrauded the Federal Aviation Administration, hiding crucial information about a design flaw on the 737 Max during its original certification process. That design flaw has been tied to crashes in 2018 and 2019 that killed 346 people, plunging the company into a crisis that led to $32 billion in losses. \u201cThe Justice Department does no one any favors by trying to sell this as a tough deal,\u201d said Peter Goeltz, a former managing director of the National Transportation Safety Board and now a CNN contributor who consults for transportation companies. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t smell like a tough deal.\u201d Under the plea settlement reached late Sunday, a $243 million fine that Boeing agreed to pay back in 2021 could be doubled to $487 million. \u201cThat\u2019s what, the price of three 777\u2019s?\u201d Goeltz said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure that it\u2019s a significant fine.\u201d There are some other numbers backing Goeltz up. Before the losses started in 2019, the company was reporting record annual revenue of $101 billion and record core operating profit of $10.7 billion, or 21 times the cost of of the $487 million fine. While Boeing\u2019s credit rating is now at risk of falling into the junk bond status for the first time, credit rating agency Moody\u2019s came out with a statement Monday that the plea and penalties \u201cwill have little effect on Boeing\u2019s finances or operations.\u201d And Boeing nearly escaped even this slap on the wrist. In January a door plug blew off a 737 Max approaching 16,000 feet. While no one was killed or seriously injured on that Alaska Airlines flight, the incident not only brought unwanted attention and a slew of federal investigations, it upended an agreement Boeing reached in January 2021 with the Justice Department to end the risk of prosecution for defrauding the FAA during the Max certification. The Alaska Air incident happened just days before the probationary period would have ended. Getting off cheap The expected guilty plea did little to satisfy family members of the crash victims,\u00a0who branded it a \u201csweetheart deal,\u201d an \u201catrocious abomination\u201d and a gross \u201cmiscarriage of justice.\u201d Their attorneys had argued that Boeing should have been hit with a maximum fine worth as much as $24.8 billion, which they calculated based on a multiple of their estimate of combined losses sustained by the families. Other corporations that pleaded guilty to felonies have agreed to much larger fines. Oil giant\u00a0BP agreed to pay $4 billion\u00a0to settle criminal charges, including manslaughter, related to the explosion and oil spill at its Deepwater Horizon oil platform in 2010 that killed 11 workers. Volkswagen pleaded guilty to three US felony criminal charges and agreed to\u00a0pay $2.8 billion in criminal penalties in 2017 after it admitted to cheating on its diesel emissions tests. \u201cThe fact that this is in the millions of dollars rather than billions is an indication this is a slap on the wrist,\u201d said Paul Cassell, a University of Utah law professor who worked on the BP case on behalf of victims and is now working for the families in the Boeing crashes. One of the facts angering family members is that Boeing agreed to plead guilty to simply defrauding the FAA, rather than facing manslaughter charges for the deaths of hundreds of people. \u201cThat\u2019s a tougher case to prove, but I believe the evidence was there,\u201d said Mark Lindquist, another attorney representing family members, as well as some passengers aboard the Alaska Air flight. \u201cAs a practical matter, the result might not have been a lot different\u201d if there had been manslaughter rather than fraud charges in this criminal case, Lindquist said. \u201cFrom a philosophical basis, it would have felt more like accountability and justice for the victims\u2019 families.\u201d Why no executives are facing charges But while the Justice Department announced in January of 2021 that \u201cmisleading statements, half-truths, and omissions communicated by Boeing employees to the FAA\u201d played a direct role in the crashes, it has taken only limited criminal action against any individual employee, and none against the top executives who oversaw the company\u2019s decisions at that time. The Justice Department said in a press statement early Monday that the agreement included \u201cno immunity to any individual employees, including corporate executives, for any conduct.\u201d But of the two former Boeing employees cited in the original settlement of the case in 2021, only one, Mark Forkner, the chief technical pilot at Boeing at the time, ever faced criminal charges, and he was eventually acquitted after his attorney convinced the jury that he was being made a scapegoat. \u201cAs a practical matter, individuals are more sympathetic to jurors than companies,\u201d Lindquist said. \u201cDOJ made a prosecutorial decision to pursue the company rather than individuals.\u201d There are also defenses in an individual\u2019s criminal case that are not possible in a corporate criminal case. \u201cWith an individual, there\u2019s always someone else he or she can point the finger at,\u201d said Lindquist. Boeing attorneys had it as part of their mission to make sure that its executives did not face any criminal charges, Lindquist said. \u201cFrom the beginning, that\u2019s been clear,\u201d he said. A Boeing spokesman said the company had no comment about the anticipated guilty plea or the case beyond a brief statement confirming the agreement. Another way to make executives pay Even if there are no criminal charges brought against executives, they can face significant penalties, Arlen said. That could come in the form of \u201cclawbacks,\u201d in which Boeing demands executives return bonuses they received during the time the misconduct was committed. \u201cEnsuring that the individuals are held accountable is the most important thing,\u201d she said. But so far the Boeing board has shown little indication of wanting to hold executives financially responsible. It recently gave CEO Dave Calhoun a 45% raise, taking his pay from $22.6 million to $32.8 million for 2023. His predecessor, Dennis Muilenburg, lost the CEO job at the end of 2019 without any severance but left the company with a package of stock worth about $80 million at that time. Asked about possible clawbacks, Boeing pointed to company policy, which states in part: \u201cThe board shall have the discretion\u2026 to recover incentive-based compensation paid to any executive of the company who has engaged in fraud, bribery, or illegal acts\u2026 or knowingly failed to report such acts of an employee over whom such officer had direct supervisory responsibility.\u201d But despite that language, no clawbacks have occurred. Arlen said it would also be justified for compensation for board members to be clawed back. While Calhoun was not an executive during this time, he was on the Boeing board, receiving more than $300,000 a year while the certification process for the Max was taking place. \u201cAt the end of the day, when you have a company with systemic problems, the ultimate buck stops with the board,\u201d she said. Why Boeing will keep its government contracts The most serious penalty that Boeing could face is by far the least likely \u2013 it could be barred from federal government contracts due to its guilty plea. And that could conceivably force the company out of business: US government contracts accounted for 37% of its revenue in 2023, or about $29 billion, according to company filings. But while it will need to get waivers from the government to continue its contracts, everyone expects those waivers will be granted. Most of those contracts are with Boeing\u2019s defense and space business, not its commercial aircraft unit. Asked about the Department of Defense contracts, Pentagon spokesperson Air Force Major General Patrick Ryder told reporters Monday that \u201cDOD will assess the company\u2019s remediation plans and agreement with the Department of Justice to make a determination as to what steps are necessary and appropriate to protect the federal government.\u201d But the US government has few alternatives than sticking with Boeing, despite both the expected guilty plea and the years of quality issues. Beyond the lack of alternatives, few if any decision makers in the federal government want to see Boeing go out of business. It remains the nation\u2019s largest exporter, and has nearly 150,000 US employees. The company estimates its economic impact at $79 billion, supporting 1.6 million direct and indirect jobs at more than 9,900 suppliers spread across all 50 states. And it is crucial to the smooth operation of the nation\u2019s air travel system. \u201cIt\u2019s very clear to me Boeing is going survive this,\u201d said Robert Clifford, another lawyer for family members of crash victims. \u201cWhy is Boeing getting a pass that other criminal defendants do not?

{"id": "2024_07_13_politics_trump-injured-pennsylvania-rally", "text": "Former President Donald Trump was rushed offstage with blood on his ear and face after a shooting during his Saturday evening rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. Trump fell to the ground after the first pop of shots rang out. Secret Service agents rushed the stage to surround Trump as screams were heard from onlookers. After several moments, Trump was brought to his feet by the agents, and he appeared to be calling out to the crowd and could be seen pumping his fist as he was whisked away into a vehicle offstage. The Secret Service said in a statement that Trump is \u201csafe.\u201d Trump posted on Truth Social later in the evening, thanking the Secret Service and law enforcement for their response to the shooting. \u201cI was shot with a bullet that pierced the upper part of my right ear. I knew immediately that something was wrong in that I heard a whizzing sound, shots, and immediately felt the bullet ripping through the skin. Much bleeding took place, so I realized then what was happening. GOD BLESS AMERICA!\u201d Trump wrote. The shooting is being investigated as a possible assassination\u00a0attempt, according to law enforcement officials. The shooter was killed by the Secret Service, and a rally attendee was also killed, according to a Secret Service source. Butler County District Attorney Richard Goldinger said a second spectator is in serious condition. \u201cAn incident occurred the evening of July 13 at a Trump rally in Pennsylvania. The Secret Service has implemented protective measures and the former President is safe. This is now an active Secret Service investigation and further information will be released when available,\u201d Secret Service chief spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said. Three law enforcement sources said that the shooter was outside the venue at the Trump rally. Two of those sources said that the shooter was on a roof outside of the venue. Multiple law enforcement sources have referred to this individual as a sniper, although additional details are not yet clear. Goldinger, the Butler County DA, said he was told by his chief detective that the shooter was on a building adjacent to the property and had no additional details on the person. \u201cIt would have required a rifle,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was several hundred yards.\u201d President Joe Biden was briefed in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, on the shooting, the White House said. Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle, Homeland Security\u00a0Secretary Alejandro\u00a0Mayorkas\u00a0and Homeland Security\u00a0adviser\u00a0Liz Sherwood-Randall are part of the team briefing the president. Biden spoke from Rehoboth Beach Saturday evening, saying he had been \u201cthoroughly briefed\u201d on the incident and was trying to reach out to Trump to speak with him. \u201cThere\u2019s no place in America for this kind of violence \u2013 it\u2019s sick, it\u2019s sick,\u201d Biden said. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the reasons why we have to unite this country. We cannot allow for this to be happening. We cannot be like this. We cannot condone this.\u201d Trump spokesman Steven Cheung said in a statement: \u201cPresident Trump thanks law enforcement and first responders for their quick action during this heinous act. He is fine and is being checked out at a local medical facility. More details will follow.\u201d A senior Trump adviser in Milwaukee told CNN in the immediate aftermath of the shooting that the team was working to gather more information on the former president\u2019s condition. The adviser was heartened by Trump\u2019s gestures as he was led off the stage before entering his SUV. \u201cWe pray he is OK,\u201d the adviser said. Rico Elmore, who was a speaker at Saturday\u2019s rally, had blood all over his white shirt and was walking away from the rally stage as he spoke to CNN and described jumping over the barrier and putting his hand on the head of an attendee who was shot and bleeding. \u201cAll we know is shots were fired and then I jumped over the barrier and put my hand on the guy\u2019s head that was profusely bleeding,\u201d Elmore said. He said he didn\u2019t know the attendee and he was \u201cjust a stranger.\u201d Elmore was visibly shaken up but said he was not harmed. He said he only saw one attendee hit and did not see what happened to Trump. Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle quickly weighed after the shooting Saturday expressing their horror, condemning the political violence. Leaders around the world sent their well wishes to the former president. \u201cI have been briefed by law enforcement and am continuing to monitor the developments. This horrific act of political violence at a peaceful campaign rally has no place in this country and should be unanimously and forcefully condemned,\u201d House Speaker Mike Johnson said in a statement. \u201cI am horrified by what happened at the Trump rally in Pennsylvania and relieved that former President Trump is safe. Political violence has no place in our country,\u201d said Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer. Former Trump campaign adviser David Urban told CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer that he had spoken with Dave McCormick, the Republican nominee for Senate from Pennsylvania, who was sitting in the front row of the rally. Trump told McCormick to \u201ccome up here onstage,\u201d Urban said, at which point he heard a few \u201cpops\u201d that sounded like \u201cfirecrackers.\u201d McCormick dropped to the ground at that point, and when he got up, he said that Secret Service agents were \u201caround everybody and they were scattering,\u201d according to Urban. McCormick wrote on X that he and his wife, former Trump administration official Dina Powell, \u201care praying for President Trump and all who were injured today in Butler PA.\u201d This story has been updated with additional reporting.

{"id": "2024_07_12_us_what-we-know-dvontaye-mitchell-death", "text": "D\u2019Vontaye Mitchell was his mother\u2019s \u201cbig teddy bear,\u201d who enjoyed music, cooking and art, and was a beloved brother, uncle and father of two. Mitchell, 43, died on June 30, after he was pinned down by hotel security guards outside a Hyatt Regency in Milwaukee in an incident partially captured on video. Hotel employees have been fired since the incident, and police have referred four charges of felony murder in Mitchell\u2019s death, Milwaukee Police said in a statement to CNN Friday, while an ongoing homicide investigation is underway and the full results of the autopsy are pending. The encounter comes as the\u00a0use of force\u00a0\u2013 particularly\u00a0against people of color\u00a0\u2013\u00a0by police and others in authority roles remains under scrutiny nearly four years after\u00a0protests flared nationwide\u00a0following the murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer. It\u2019s unclear what led up to Mitchell\u2019s encounter with the security guards, how long it took officers to arrive on the scene and what Mitchell was doing at the hotel. Here\u2019s what we know about Mitchell, the incident and what witness video shows: What witness video shows (and doesn\u2019t show) Police allege Mitchell \u201ccaused a disturbance,\u201d prompting security guards to escort him out of the hotel,\u00a0according to\u00a0a statement\u00a0from civil rights attorney Ben Crump, who represents the Mitchell family. Security guards and others then pinned Mitchell to the ground, part of a video posted on social media shows Mitchell grunting and pleading with the guards, repeatedly saying \u201cplease\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d It\u2019s unclear what part of the incident witness video captured, what led up to this moment and what happened in the moments after. One guard, who appears to be White, can be heard saying, \u201cStay down,\u201d and \u201cStop fighting,\u201d as the others, who appear to be people of color, hold Mitchell down, the video shows. The same guard calls out to witnesses, \u201cThis is what happens when you go into the ladies room.\u201d Hotel operator fires \u2018hotel associates\u2019 involved It\u2019s unclear how many \u201chotel associates\u201d were fired and if they include the security guards involved in the Mitchell incident. Those security guards initially were suspended as Aimbridge Hospitality, which operates the downtown hotel, completed its investigation, a Hyatt spokesperson told CNN on Monday. \u201cThe conduct we saw from several associates on June 30 violated our policies and procedures, and does not reflect our values as an organization or the behaviors we expect from our associates,\u201d Aimbridge Hospitality, said Thursday in a statement about the death of D\u2019Vontaye Mitchell. \u201cFollowing review of their actions, their employment has been terminated,\u201d the statement added. \u201cWe will continue our independent investigation and do everything we can to support law enforcement with their investigation into this tragic incident.\u201d A homicide investigation is underway The local prosecutor is investigating Mitchell\u2019s death as a homicide, he said Wednesday. The district attorney\u2019s office is awaiting the full results of Mitchell\u2019s autopsy, which will help inform the police investigation into his death and allow the office to evaluate what happened before his death \u201cfrom the perspective of potential criminal liability,\u201d District Attorney John Chisholm said Wednesday in a statement. CNN has reached out to the Milwaukee County Medical Examiner\u2019s office. Police have been in consultation with the Milwaukee County District Attorney\u2019s Office since July 5 and have subsequently referred the charges to the DA, who is reviewing them, Milwaukee Police said in a Friday statement. It\u2019s unclear who those four felony charges are for and how they came to be. Crump said\u00a0the charges\u00a0would be\u00a0a \u201csignificant step toward justice\u201d that \u201cunderscore the severity of the actions that led to\u00a0D\u2019Vontaye\u2019s\u00a0sudden and untimely death.\u201d \u201cWe must now press for these charges to be formally filed by the District Attorney\u2019s Office in order for these officers to truly be held accountable,\u201d he said in a Friday statement to CNN. Crump had originally said Milwaukee Police were not considering the incident as a criminal investigation because there wasn\u2019t any evidence of \u201cblunt force.\u201d CNN has reached out to Crump\u2019s team for more information. Crump\u2019s office obtained an affidavit from an unidentified hotel employee who claimed he reluctantly helped hold down Mitchell after being ordered to do so by a security guard, the attorney said. Crump said he would turn the document over to prosecutors but did not release it publicly. How loved ones remember his big heart Mitchell\u2019s mother, Brenda Giles, said her eldest son was a jolly and outgoing brother, uncle and father who loved his family, she told\u00a0WTMJ. \u201cEverybody that knows him, to know him is to love him, they know,\u201d his sister, Nayisha Mitchell, told the station. \u201cThey knew he was a good person.\u201d Mitchell was known for his creativity in the kitchen, according to his obituary, which was read during Thursday\u2019s funeral. \u201cThe man could turn a can of ravioli into a gourmet meal,\u201d the obituary said. \u201cHe loved to dance, and he was harmless,\u201d Giles told reporters Wednesday. \u201cI always called him my big teddy bear.\u201d Mitchell enjoyed expressing himself through art and music. He had a love for drawing, singing, gospel music, dancing and writing original rap lyrics, his obituary read. \u201cHe also had an insatiable love of knowledge, which he fed through his love of documentaries,\u201d it continued. \u201cD\u2019Vontaye was an avid family man who filled his time visiting his kids and family and he lit up every face with joy when he entered the room.\u201d \u201cHe was known as the person to go to for help, because his big heart would seldom allow him to say no.\u201d When Mitchell\u2019s father passed away in 2016, Mitchell fell into depression, his family told WTMJ. Giles believes her son was suffering from a mental health episode at the time of the incident,\u00a0according to Crump. \u201cTo see him go out this world the way he did, that was devastating. That would never leave my mind, that\u2019s going to live with me for the rest of my life,\u201d Giles, told reporters Wednesday.

{"id": "2024_07_13_business_postage-rate-increase", "text": "On Sunday, the cost of a stamp is going up for the second time this year,\u00a0jumping 5 cents for first class postage to 73 cents. You probably didn\u2019t notice. And truthfully, you may not care. But you should. Most people don\u2019t use mail the way they used to \u2013 if they send out mail at all. But the price of postage is a big deal to millions of businesses and organizations that spend most of the $40.8 billion a year spent on mail, including letters, bulk mailings, junk mail and periodicals. And higher prices are making them cut back \u2013 and hurting the budget of the US Postal Service and, potentially, its ability to continue its crucial services. That includes everything from delivering online purchases to life-saving prescription drugs. And this year, tens of millions of voters will cast their ballots in the presidential election by mail. And, most of all, businesses still depend on the mail to help them reach customers and keep the economy going. Postage increases used to be pegged to inflation, usually going up at most once a year. But Sunday will mark the sixth increase in three years, during which first-class stamp increases rose 10 percentage points faster than overall inflation. Major mailers say hiking prices that quickly will drive them away from the post office, eventually drying up the agency\u2019s budget. \u201cWe think they\u2019ve overshot the mark on raising their rates,\u201d said Michael Plunkett, CEO of the Association for Postal Commerce, which represents companies in the mailing and shipping industry. \u201cThese rate increases aren\u2019t generating much additional revenue because it\u2019s driving volume out of the system that is likely never to return.\u201d The price of a first-class stamp reached 10 cents in 1974, just before the 200th anniversary of the service. As recently as 2002 it stood at 34 cents, or half of today\u2019s price ahead of Sunday\u2019s increase. So if raising the prices of stamps could ultimately endanger the postal service, why does the USPS keep hiking the costs to mail a letter? The short answer is because the agency needs money \u2013 badly. The long answer is more complicated. A history older than America The postal service and the United States have grown side by side since before the country\u2019s birth \u2013 quite literally. Founding Father Benjamin Franklin was appointed the first postmaster general in 1775,\u00a0the USPS notes on its website. The service expanded to keep pace with the new nation, and to help bind the young country together. It was a major reason roads were constructed between its early cities. US 1, the first federal highway, started out as Boston Post Road to carry mail between New York and Boston, and still goes by that name in many locations. \u201cWhen Alexis de Tocqueville toured the young country, in 1831, the United States boasted twice as many post offices as Britain and five times as many as France,\u201d\u00a0Smithsonian Magazine noted in October 2020. Today it has 640,000 employees located in over 30,000 facilities nationwide. Postage stamps, though, took quite awhile longer to make an appearance. \u201cAlexander M. Greig\u2019s City Despatch Post, a private New York City carrier, issued the first adhesive stamps in the United States on February 1, 1842,\u201d\u00a0according to the Postal Service. Congress then authorized\u00a0postage stamps in 1847, and prepayment of postage was required in 1855.\u00a0The iconic Pony Express\u00a0\u2013 a feature in many a Western film and novel \u2013 came about five years later, in 1860. And the postal service has made other appearances in pop culture and American history. The climax of beloved holiday movie \u201cMiracle on 34th Street\u201d has (spoiler alert) the Post Office rescuing Santa Claus on Christmas Eve. The characters of Cliff on the 1980s sitcom \u201cCheers\u201d and Newman in the 1990s sitcom \u201cSeinfeld,\u201d were letter carriers.\u00a0The band The Postal Service\u00a0was an indie-pop darling near the turn of the century. And the 1985 novel (by David Brin) and 1997 movie (starring Kevin Costner) \u201cThe Postman\u201d take the importance of delivering mail into a dystopian, sci-fi future. Mail down 75%, packages up But mail deliveries shriveled with the introduction of new ways to communicate and connect. Families and friends can communicate by email, text or apps. Bills can get paid electronically. Physical mail doesn\u2019t play the same role in American life that it used to. For many, the individual letter is as relevant today as VHS movies, floppy computer discs and cassette tapes. This century\u2019s nickname for the traditional letter - snail mail - is hardly a compliment. In its most recent year, the service delivered 11.4 billion individual letters. That may sound like a lot, but it\u2019s down 75% from 20 years ago. While stamp prices have doubled in that time, most experts point the finger at technology instead. \u201cFor most households, mail is not a significant expenditure,\u201d Plunkett said. \u201cIf the price of a stamp was a dollar I would send the same number of Christmas cards out later this year as I did last year.\u201d In contrast, online shopping has lifted package deliveries significantly. But the Postal Service doesn\u2019t have the lock on that business that it does in its mail service, said Kevin Kosar, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. \u201cBefore the digital age hit, the Postal Service had a very valuable monopoly. Those days are gone,\u201d he said. \u201cThe package business is going up, but that\u2019s not a monopoly business for them. It\u2019s very competitive.\u201d But Plunkett and other critics worry that the growth in the competitive package business will not produce the profits needed to make up for the declining mail volumes. The major mailers were never going to like the idea of paying more for postage. But they argue, with considerable evidence to back them up, that raising rates as rapidly as they have been climbing, is driving away business the service needs and worsening its economic condition. \u201cBy jacking the rates up, its efficiency and productivity go way down,\u201d said Art Sackler, executive director of the Coalition for a 21st Century Postal Service, another trade group representing business that use the service. \u201cLast year, by its own measure, its efficiency dropped by the most in 60 years.\u201d \u2018Financial death spiral\u2019 Critics are concerned about the rate increases: The worsening finances and efficiency could eventually force the Postal Service to run out of money, perhaps within a few years, and either start depending on direct taxpayer subsidies from Congress that it doesn\u2019t currently receive or cut back on staffing and service. The Postal Service under current Postmaster General Louis DeJoy laid out a 10-year plan in 2021 to modernize the service and stem ongoing losses. Before, he told the Senate in April, the USPS had been in \u201cfinancial death spiral\u201d for years, but that under the $40 billion modernization plan, \u201cwe are making the changes necessary to ensure that we are around to serve the country well into the future.\u201d But the plan, which includes restructuring its network of mail handling facilities, using more full-time staff, improving transportation and delivery methods and investing in technology, has not lived up to early promises. The service had projected it would break even by its last fiscal year and post a $1.7 billion annual profit in the current fiscal year. Instead, it lost $6 billion last year and is forecast to lose another $6 billion or more in the current fiscal year, according to congressional testimony in April from Michael Kubayanda, chairman of the rate-setting Postal Regulatory Commission. And some of the unions that represent postal workers are concerned the modernization plan will try to improve finances by reducing the reliability of the service. \u201cThe cost of a letter is still a heck of deal,\u201d said Mark Dimondstein, president of the American Postal Workers Union. \u201cI think there\u2019s good and I think there\u2019s bad in the plan. I think we do have to adapt to the world of growing package business and declining mail volumes. Our concern with the 10-year plan is anything that slows down service.\u201d Kubayanda testified in April that he doubts the modernization plan will be able to achieve its financial and service goals. \u201cIt looks increasingly difficult to have a universal postal system that reaches every American six days a week, at affordable prices, with reasonably fast and reliable service, and is self-sustaining financially,\u201d\u00a0he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/13/business/postage-rate-increase/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/14/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_08_us_rust-shooting-timeline-alec-baldwin", "text": "Actor Alec Baldwin and several crew members gathered in a church at a New Mexico ranch on October 21, 2021, to rehearse a scene from their upcoming Western film \u201cRust.\u201d Then came the unexpected gunshot. A promising cinematographer was killed, a director was wounded and a film production was left in shambles. Since that day\u2019s fatal shooting of 42-year-old Halyna Hutchins, the film\u2019s armorer and its assistant director have been convicted of criminal charges. After nearly three years of back-and-forth legal arguments, Baldwin\u2019s trial on the involuntary manslaughter charge began on July 10 with opening statements but ended abruptly on July 12, when the judge ruled prosecutors did not properly turn over evidence to the defense, and dismissed the charges. The details of what happened the day of the shooting have been made public in affidavits, probable cause statements, interviews with the main participants and testimony at criminal trials. Here\u2019s a timeline of the on-set shooting and the resulting legal cases. The shooting May 29, 2020: Baldwin, the three-time Emmy winner for his roles on \u201c30 Rock\u201d and \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d was announced as producer and star of the Western feature film \u201cRust,\u201d based on a story by Baldwin and Joel Souza, Deadline reported. In the film, Baldwin plays a grizzled outlaw on the run from authorities with his 13-year-old grandson. October 6, 2021: Filming of \u201cRust\u201d began at Bonanza Creek Ranch, a movie set outside Santa Fe, New Mexico. October 20, 2021: Several crew members walked off set, citing safety concerns. One crew member stated there had been two accidental weapons discharges and a special effects mess-up that set off explosives around the crew between takes. October 21, 2021: Hannah Gutierrez Reed, the armorer for \u201cRust,\u201d loaded a prop six-shot revolver with what she believed were \u201cdummy\u201d rounds, a term for ammo that contains no explosive elements but appear to be real, according to investigators and her defense attorney. Baldwin and several crew members began rehearsing a scene in a rustic church on set before breaking for lunch. After the break, Baldwin, Souza, Hutchins and a few others returned to the church for rehearsal. Assistant director Dave Halls fetched a prop gun from a cart outside the church and yelled \u201ccold gun,\u201d indicating it was unloaded. He then handed the gun to Baldwin. Baldwin practiced a \u201ccross draw\u201d \u2013 pulling a gun from a holster on the opposite side of his body from his draw hand. The scene required him to point the gun toward the camera, helmed by Hutchins, Souza and a camera operator. Suddenly, they heard a loud bang. Hutchins stumbled backward, slumped to the floor clutching her stomach and said she couldn\u2019t feel her legs. Souza, who had been standing beside her, noticed blood on his shoulder. At 1:48 p.m., the crew reported the shooting to emergency responders. Hutchins was transported by air helicopter to the hospital and was pronounced dead at 3:37 p.m. Souza was treated at the hospital, and a projectile from a live round was removed from his back. Sheriff\u2019s deputies arrived to the scene and began investigating the series of events leading to the shooting.

December 2, 2021: In an interview with ABC, Baldwin said he cocked the gun and let go of the hammer, and the gun then fired. He said he was aiming the gun just to the side of the camera toward Hutchins, as she instructed him to do. \u201cI would never point a gun at anyone and then pull the trigger, never,\u201d he said. The investigations August 14, 2022: FBI testing of the firearm found it could not be fired without pulling the trigger while the gun was cocked, according to a forensics report. The report noted the gun eventually malfunctioned during FBI testing after internal parts fractured, causing the gun to go off in the cocked position without pulling the trigger. August 20, 2022: In an interview with CNN, Baldwin\u00a0placed responsibility\u00a0for Hutchins\u2019 death on Gutierrez Reed, the film armorer and props assistant, and on assistant director Halls, who handed him the gun. October 5, 2022: The family of Hutchins and Baldwin reached an undisclosed settlement in a wrongful death lawsuit filed against the actor and others. As part of the settlement, Matthew Hutchins, the cinematographer\u2019s widower, was named an executive producer on \u201cRust.\u201d January 19, 2023: Prosecutors announced Baldwin and Gutierrez Reed will be charged with involuntary manslaughter in Hutchins\u2019 death. Halls, the assistant director, agreed to plead no contest to negligent use of a deadly weapon, the district attorney\u2019s office announced. The terms of that deal include six months of probation\u00a0and a suspended sentence, prosecutors said. January 31, 2023: Baldwin and Gutierrez Reed were formally charged with involuntary manslaughter. February 23, 2023: Baldwin pleaded not guilty to manslaughter charges and was released on personal recognizance. April 20, 2023: New Mexico special prosecutors dismissed the charges against Baldwin, citing \u201cnew facts\u201d in the case. \u201cThis decision does not absolve Mr. Baldwin of criminal culpability and charges may be refiled,\u201d they said. August 9, 2023: Gutierrez Reed pleaded not guilty to involuntary manslaughter and tampering with evidence. January 19: Baldwin was indicted by a grand jury on charges of involuntary manslaughter. January 31: Baldwin pleaded not guilty to involuntary manslaughter charges for the second time. The trials February 22: The trial of film armorer Gutierrez Reed began. Prosecutors alleged her failures allowed six live bullets to make their way on set, and she did not make vital safety checks that would have caught the problem. Her defense blamed Baldwin for failing to follow common-sense gun safety rules and on the film\u2019s production team for creating a chaotic and unsafe environment. March 1: Souza, the director and screenwriter, testified about the moment he was shot on set while standing behind Hutchins. March 6: Gutierrez Reed was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter after jurors deliberated for nearly three hours. She was acquitted of a charge of evidence tampering. April 15: At her sentencing hearing, Gutierrez Reed said, \u201cMy heart aches\u201d for Hutchins\u2019 family and friends, and she asked the judge to sentence her to probation. The judge criticized her statement and sentenced her to a maximum of 18 months in prison, saying, \u201cYou alone turned a safe weapon into a lethal weapon.\u201d May 24: A New Mexico judge denied Baldwin\u2019s motion to dismiss the involuntary manslaughter indictment. Baldwin\u2019s attorneys had accused prosecutors of misconduct during the grand jury process. June 3: New Mexico prosecutors asked the court to grant use immunity to Gutierrez Reed and compel her to testify at Baldwin\u2019s trial, according to court documents. Gutierrez Reed invoked her Fifth Amendment right to silence in a pre-trial interview, and prosecutors said if she is not granted immunity then she would not be able to testify in the trial. Gutierrez Reed\u2019s attorney, Jason Bowles, told CNN he will oppose the motion. June 17: Prosecutors signaled their intention to portray Baldwin as repeatedly flouting safety protocols on the movie set in the days before the fatal shooting, according to\u00a0a court filing. June 21: Judge Mary Marlowe Sommer denied a defense motion asking the court to dismiss the involuntary manslaughter indictment. The defense had argued the shooting death was an accident and Baldwin was \u201cnot criminally liable,\u201d but the prosecution countered Baldwin was experienced in the movie business and knew he was handling a real gun. The judge also denied the prosecution\u2019s motion to grant use immunity to Gutierrez Reed to compel her to testify at Baldwin\u2019s trial. June 28: The court denied a motion to dismiss the charges related to the gun that was damaged during forensic testing. Separately, attorneys for Gutierrez Reed in a court filing on June 27 accused prosecutors of withholding evidence that would have favored the defendant during her manslaughter trial and requested she be released from prison,\u00a0Reuters\u00a0reported. According to the filing obtained by Reuters, prosecutors had a report from their own weapons experts that the gun used on set had \u201cunexplained toolmarks on critical surfaces of the trigger and sear.\u201d July 3: Judge Sommer denied two motions filed by Baldwin\u2019s legal team alleging prosecutors had improperly handled evidence, paving the way for Baldwin\u2019s trial to start. July 8: The judge ruled Baldwin\u2019s role as a producer on the film \u201cRust\u201d would not be considered at trial. The prosecution had sought to show Baldwin had more responsibility and influence on the set than just as an actor, but the judge said the evidence was prejudicial and confusing to the jury. July 9: Twelve jurors and four alternates were empaneled in Santa Fe for Baldwin\u2019s trial. July 10: The trial of Baldwin on a charge of involuntary manslaughter began with opening statements. Prosecutors alleged Baldwin was reckless with firearms on set and violated the \u201ccardinal rules of firearm safety.\u201d \u201cHe pointed the gun at another human being, cocked the hammer and pulled that trigger, in reckless disregard for Ms. Hutchins\u2019 safety,\u201d prosecutor Erlinda Johnson said. The defense blamed the film\u2019s armorer and the first assistant director for allowing a live round to be loaded into the prop gun. \u201cThis was an unspeakable tragedy, but Alec Baldwin committed no crime. He was an actor, acting, playing the role of Harlan Rust. An actor playing a character can do things that are lethal,\u201d attorney Alex Spiro said. \u201cThese \u2018cardinal rules\u2019 are not cardinal rules on a movie set.\u201d July 12: The involuntary manslaughter case against Baldwin was dismissed in dramatic fashion after the judge overseeing the case ruled prosecutors did not properly turn over evidence to the defense. Sommer sided with the defense and dismissed the case with prejudice, meaning it cannot be brought again. \u201cThe state\u2019s discovery violation has injected a needless, incurable delay into the jury trial,\u201d she said. \u201cDismissal with prejudice is warranted to ensure the integrity of the judicial system and the efficient administration of justice. Your motion to dismiss with prejudice is granted.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/08/us/rust-shooting-timeline-alec-baldwin/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/14/2024", "section": "us"}}
