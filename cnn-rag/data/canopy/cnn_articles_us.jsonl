The significant disruption to water service in Georgia\u2019s capital began Friday after breaks on a 48-inch and 36-inch transmission line \u201cthat carries large volumes of water to the metropolitan area,\u201d according to Atlanta\u2019s Department of Watershed Management. Crews have worked to repair separate water main breaks that happened Friday in downtown and Midtown, and by Saturday evening, the initial water main break downtown was fixed, officials said in a post on X. Crews were still working to repair the other major water main break located in Midtown Atlanta on Saturday. There is no exact timeline for when those repairs will be completed. Meanwhile, dialysis patients at Emory University Hospital Midtown were transferred to other Emory hospitals for treatment, a hospital spokesperson told CNN in a statement Saturday. The Midtown hospital\u2019s emergency department diverted ambulances except for people with urgent heart concerns, the statement said. \u201cIndividuals who walk-in or drive to the emergency department are still being accepted and cared for as normal,\u201d the statement said. The hospital said it brought in around 58,000 gallons of water in six tanker trucks to use in chillers and cooling towers. The water was supplied by a fire department and delivered by a tanker truck company. \u201cBottled water is being distributed to patients throughout the hospital for drinking and personal care needs,\u201d the statement said. Urgent surgeries have not been affected, but most outpatient appointments, including in oncology and radiology, have been rescheduled or moved. Boil water advisory in still effect Saturday Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens apologized on Saturday for the city\u2019s response to the water main break that began creating concerns Friday morning. The issues prompted the closure of tourist attractions and the rescheduling of events including Megan Thee Stallion concerts Friday and Saturday. The incident also left many without water or with inadequate water pressure. The Georgia Aquarium and the World of Coca-Cola, two of downtown\u2019s biggest attractions, remained closed Saturday. The boil water advisory remained in effect as of Saturday evening, Atlanta Watershed said in an X post. Officials say a decaying pipe that collapsed due to water pressure was the main cause of the break downtown. \u201cWe were actually able to repair the fitting that was leaking,\u201d said Al Wiggins Jr., Commissioner for the Department of Public Works, during a news conference earlier on Saturday. \u201cWe spent a significant amount of time removing pressure from the system in order for us to be able to conduct the necessary repairs,\u201d he said. Crews are slowly pressurizing water flow to ensure no additional damage is done to the water network. Atlanta\u2019s Grady Memorial Hospital on Saturday also reported low water pressure, Grady administrators said in a statement. \u201cHowever, we remain fully operational, and our emergency room is accepting all patients,\u201d the statement reads, adding that elective procedures were canceled \u201cto ensure patient safety.\u201d Water issues have impacted Atlanta before. In June 2020, a water main break on the Georgia Institute of Technology\u2019s campus led to outages and a boil water advisory in the city. Emory University Hospital Midtown used bottled water then. Patient care was not affected. Atlanta\u2019s woes are part of a larger issue of aging infrastructure throughout the United States. Here and in Canada, around 260,000 water main breaks cost $2.6 billion each year, according to a December 2023 study from Utah State University. The study noted that the average age of failing water mains is around 53 years and that 33% of US and Canadian water mains are over 50 years old.

{"id": "2024_06_01_us_chad-daybell-murder-sentencing-death-penalty", "text": "Chad Daybell was sentenced to death Saturday upon the recommendation of the jury that convicted him of first-degree murder and conspiracy charges in the killings of his first wife and two children of his second wife. Daybell was convicted Thursday of first-degree murder and conspiracy charges in the deaths of his first wife, Tammy Daybell, and two of his second wife\u2019s children \u2013 16-year-old Tylee Ryan and 7-year-old Joshua \u201cJJ\u201d Vallow \u2013 in a case prosecutors claim was fueled by power, sex, money and apocalyptic spiritual beliefs. Judge Steven Boyce on Saturday formally imposed the death sentence after a jury, in a lengthy verdict form read in court earlier, said it found that penalty was appropriate under the law. The judge also imposed a 15-year prison sentence for insurance fraud charges. Daybell had a blank expression as Boyce sentenced him to death. The judge said jurors had \u201cfound beyond a reasonable doubt \u2026 that the aggravating circumstances when weighed against the mitigating circumstances do not make the imposition of the death penalty unjust.\u201d The sequestered jury began deliberating his fate Friday afternoon and mulled the case for six hours before ending for the night. Jurors continued deliberations Saturday about 8:30 a.m. MT, and at 10:45 a.m. the Ada County courts announced the verdict had been reached. Jurors heard contrasting portraits of the man from lawyers before beginning deliberations in a case that drew national attention in part because of what prosecutors described as the couple\u2019s \u201cdoomsday\u201d religious beliefs. The sensational triple murder was featured in a Netflix true-crime documentary in 2022. In his opening statement to the jury on Friday, prosecutor Rob Wood asked them to consider aggravating factors that would make Daybell eligible for the death penalty. First, the three murders, he said, were committed for remuneration. Daybell was also convicted of insurance fraud stemming from life insurance policies that allegedly paid him money after his first wife\u2019s death. His second wife, as well as Daybell, also were convicted of grand theft because she continued to draw Social Security benefits for her children after their deaths. Additionally, Wood told the jury, the murders of the three victims were \u201cespecially heinous, atrocious or cruel, manifesting exceptional depravity.\u201d \u201cThis defendant exhibited utter disregard for human life,\u201d Wood added. \u201cThe defendant, by his conduct, whether such conduct was before, during or after the commission of the murders at hand, has exhibited a propensity to commit murder, which will probably constitute a continuing threat to society.\u201d The prosecutor concluded, \u201cIt is your decision whether one or more of these aggravators has been proven. And if it has been, you must decide if, under these circumstances, imposition of the death penalty would be just or unjust.\u201d The verdict came about a year after Daybell\u2019s second wife, Lori Vallow Daybell, was also\u00a0convicted\u00a0of the murder of her children and sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. She was also convicted of conspiring to kill Tammy Daybell. Vallow Daybell has\u00a0appealed her convictions\u00a0to the state Supreme Court, with her legal team raising the issue of whether she was mentally competent to stand trial. Authorities have said they\u00a0believe Tylee and JJ were killed in September 2019\u00a0\u2013 the month they were last reported to have been seen \u2013 and that Tammy Daybell was\u00a0found dead\u00a0in her Idaho home on October 19, 2019, a\u00a0few weeks before Chad Daybell married Vallow Daybell. Addressing the jury Friday, defense lawyer John Prior portrayed Daybell as a once \u201cquiet, reserved, shy young man\u201d who grew up in Springville, Utah, a small, tight knit \u201ctown of faith.\u201d Daybell, his lawyer said, met his first wife, Tammy, and they were married for 29 years, raising five \u201cwonderful\u201d children \u201cvery deep in their faith, very deep in their commitment to family.\u201d But Daybell\u2019s life changed in late 2018, Prior said, when he met Vallow Daybell, who had already been married multiple times. \u201cEverything that glitters is not gold,\u201d he told jurors. \u201cLori Vallow glittered. She was not gold. She was the trajectory that changed the plan\u2026 Chaos hits and all of these things start cascading and this thing becomes very complicated and difficult.\u201d Prior said the new relationship with Vallow was like \u201cthis bomb dropped\u201d on the life of \u201cthe small town boy from Springville.\u201d \u201cWe have to look back at that,\u201d he said. \u201cYou examine what Chad Daybell\u2019s past was prior to the bomb being dropped, the Lori Vallow bomb being dropped\u2026 If it wasn\u2019t for that trajectory coming in and changing the path, is this where we would be going? It\u2019s not where we\u2019d be going.\u201d \u2018There\u2019s a hole in my heart\u2019 Jurors also heard from relatives of the victims on Friday. \u201cIt makes me angry and it destroys me to know Tammy was treated how she was,\u201d Tammy Daybell\u2019s father, Ron Douglas, told jurors. \u201cI find it comforting to know that Tammy is resting peacefully in Utah, buried alone and near her beloved mother.\u201d Kay Woodcock spoke about her grandson JJ and her step niece Tylee. \u201cI sit here today and try and explain the immense pain that me and everyone in my family continues to endure daily,\u201d she said. \u201cBut how do I do that?\u201d \u201cI can tell you there have been too many situations in the past few years where we were slammed with the fact that JJ won\u2019t hit another milestone,\u201d she said of her grandson. \u201cThe constant question remains: Who would he have become? What kind of man would he have been?\u201d Woodcock remembered Tylee as \u201cthe most precious, blond-haired, blue-eyed little girl\u201d and an \u201cabsolute mama\u2019s girl.\u201d Woodcock added, breaking into tears: \u201cThere\u2019s a hole in my heart, in the hearts of every member of my family, that can never be filled and will remain for the rest of my life.\u201d Tylee\u2019s aunt, Annie Cushing, remembered her walking around the house singing with \u201cthe voice of an angel.\u201d \u201cTylee had her whole life ahead of her. She had dignity, she had dreams, she had goals. This defendant stole all of that,\u201d Cushing said. Kelsee Douglas, Tammy\u2019s sister-in-law, told jurors that \u201cpain, fractured relationships and unhealed wounds are all part of the aftermath\u201d of the murders. \u201cThis is the legacy of anguish and sorrow that will haunt our family for generations,\u201d she added. Tammy\u2019s brother, Michael Douglas, lamented that \u201cthe nightmare fodder I have been provided will last me a lifetime.\u201d Daybell declined to address the court after the victim impact statements. Law enforcement found the remains of Tylee and JJ on Chad Daybell\u2019s Fremont County property\u00a0in June 2020, authorities said. \u201cIt\u2019s a sad day. JJ would have been 12 years old,\u201d JJ\u2019s grandfather, Larry Woodcock, said after the verdict Thursday. Woodcock remembered the victims, and asked the same question, over and over. \u201cWhat did they accomplish? Nothing. What did they do? They destroyed families,\u201d Woodcock said of Daybell and Lori Vallow Daybell. But the defendants, Larry Woodcock said, could not destroy the memories relatives have of the victims. \u201cThey can\u2019t take that,\u201d he added, growing emotional at one point. When he heard the jury verdict in court, he said, he felt like he couldn\u2019t breathe. \u2018Sex, money and power\u2019 were key focuses in the trial During opening statements, the prosecutor and defense attorney painted contrasting portraits of the defendant. The state described him as a power-hungry and grandiose man who would stop at nothing for \u201cwhat he considered his rightful destiny.\u201d His defense lawyer portrayed Daybell as a religious man driven into an unfortunate relationship by a \u201cbeautiful, vivacious woman\u201d who knew \u201chow to get what she wants.\u201d \u201cTwo dead children buried in the defendant Chad Daybell\u2019s backyard,\u201d Wood said in his first words to the jury at the start of trial. \u201cThe next month his wife is found dead in their marital bed. Seventeen days after the death of his wife, Tammy Daybell, this defendant is\u00a0photographed laughing and dancing on a beach in Hawaii at his wedding to Lori Vallow, a woman who was his mistress and the mother of the children buried\u00a0in the graves on his property. Three dead bodies.\u201d When Daybell \u201chad a chance at what he considered his rightful destiny,\u201d Wood said, he \u201cmade sure that no person and no law would stand in his way.\u201d \u201cHis desire for sex, money and power led him to pursue those ambitions,\u201d the prosecutor added. \u201cAnd this pursuit\u00a0led to the deaths of his wife and Lori\u2019s two innocent children.\u201d Tammy Daybell was initially believed to have died in her sleep, and Chad Daybell remarried less than three weeks after her death in 2019. Prior said Daybell\u2019s life began to change after he met Vallow Daybell, a \u201cbeautifully stunning woman\u201d who \u201cstarts giving him a lot of attention\u201d and eventually lured him into an \u201cinappropriate\u201d and \u201cunfortunate\u201d extramarital relationship. Vallow Daybell\u2019s two children from a previous marriage were last seen on different days in September 2019. Tylee Ryan was a \u201cnormal, vibrant teenage girl\u201d who loved her friends and her little brother, JJ, was on the autism spectrum and required special care, according to Wood. In late November 2019, relatives asked police in Rexburg, Idaho,\u00a0to do a welfare check on JJ because they hadn\u2019t talked to him recently. Police didn\u2019t find him at the family\u2019s house but did see Vallow Daybell and Daybell, who said JJ was staying with a family friend in Arizona, according to authorities. When police returned with a search warrant the next day, the couple was gone. They were ultimately found in Hawaii in January 2020. In June 2020, law enforcement officials found the remains of Tylee and JJ on Daybell\u2019s property in Fremont County, Idaho. Vallow Daybell and Daybell were indicted on murder charges in May 2021. Tylee was believed to have been killed between September 8 and 9, 2019, and JJ between September 22 and 23, according to prosecutors. \u201cWe are filled with unfathomable sadness that these two bright stars were stolen from us, and only hope that they died without pain or suffering,\u201d the families of the children said in a statement after the remains were found.

Tammy Daybell was initially believed to have died in her sleep. Law enforcement found the remains of Tylee and JJ on Chad Daybell\u2019s Fremont County property\u00a0in June 2020, authorities said. The jury was read its instructions Wednesday morning before closing arguments. During closing arguments, Chad Daybell\u2019s lawyer, John Prior, said there wasn\u2019t enough direct evidence against Daybell and others were responsible for the deaths. If convicted, Daybell could face the death penalty. Vallow Daybell was convicted by a jury\u00a0in May 2023 of the murder of her children and was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. She also was convicted of conspiring to kill Tammy Daybell. Vallow Daybell has\u00a0appealed her convictions\u00a0to the state Supreme Court, with her legal team raising the issue of whether she was mentally competent to stand trial. Jurors deliberated for just over two hours Wednesday and will resume at 8 a.m. Thursday. 2 children and a wife died weeks apart During opening statements, prosecutor Rob Wood\u00a0described Chad Daybell as a \u201cseemingly ordinary man\u201d who wrote books about the apocalypse, a person who \u201ccraves significance\u201d and worked as a sexton in a graveyard. \u201cTwo dead children buried in the defendant Chad Daybell\u2019s backyard,\u201d Wood said in his first words to the jury. \u201cThe next month his wife is found dead in their marital bed.

In October 2018, Chad Daybell and Vallow Daybell met at a religious conference in Utah and he began to craft an alternate reality where his \u201cobsession for glory was rooted in her adoration for him,\u201d Wood told jurors. Soon, Wood said, they viewed their spouses and even their children as \u201cobstacles\u201d that stood in their way. \u201cAnyone who opposed them were labeled sometimes as dark spirits or even zombies,\u201d the prosecutor said. During opening statements, Prior, the defense attorney, described his client as a religious man who wrote books about his faith, premonitions, good and evil, and the \u201ccoming of the end of things when his savior, in his mind, is going to come back.\u201d Prior said Daybell\u2019s life began to change after he met Vallow Daybell, a \u201cbeautifully stunning woman\u201d who \u201cstarts giving him a lot of attention\u201d and eventually lured him into an \u201cinappropriate\u201d and \u201cunfortunate\u201d extramarital relationship. Prior told the jury about Vallow Daybell\u2019s brother, Alex Cox, who died in December 2019, and his history of violence \u2013 including the shooting and killing of Vallow Daybell\u2019s former husband, Charles Vallow, in July\u00a02019. The Maricopa County medical examiner in Arizona said Cox died of natural causes,\u00a0CNN affiliate KPHO/KTVK\u00a0reported. \u201cAlex Cox was Lori\u2019s protector,\u201d Prior said. \u201cAlex Cox would do anything and everything to protect, aid and assist Lori Vallow \u2026 Whenever there was a problem or a threat to Lori Vallow, you will hear testimony that Alex Cox came to the rescue.\u201d DNA and forensics experts suggested Cox\u2019s fingerprint was found on plastic wrapped around JJ\u2019s body, Daybell\u2019s defense attorney said. No DNA or hair belonging to Chad Daybell was found with the children\u2019s bodies, and the exact cause of Tammy Daybell\u2019s death could not be determined, Prior said. Couple believed they were religious figures Chad Daybell and Vallow Daybell called themselves \u201cJames and Elaina\u201d and believed they were religious figures and had a system of rating people as \u201clight\u201d or \u201cdark,\u201d a prosecutor told jurors during Vallow Daybell\u2019s trial. The state accused the couple of using their \u201cdoomsday\u201d religious beliefs to justify the killings. In particular, Daybell and Vallow Daybell\u00a0exchanged texts about Tammy Daybell \u201cbeing in limbo\u201d and \u201cbeing possessed by a spirit named Viola,\u201d according to the indictment. People close to the couple\u00a0said they had been involved in strong religious ideologies. In addition, Daybell was connected to a religious\u00a0doomsday prepper website\u00a0which described itself as a \u201cseries of lecture events focusing on self-reliance and personal preparation.\u201d The publishers of the site said they decided to pull content featuring either Daybell or Vallow Daybell after the children\u2019s disappearance. The disappearance of the children made national headlines Vallow Daybell\u2019s two children from a previous marriage were last seen on different days in September 2019.

After Vallow Daybell\u2019s indictment and not guilty plea in 2021, a judge ruled she was incompetent to stand trial, but she was deemed fit to proceed with trial after spending nearly a year in a mental hospital. Vallow Daybell has maintained her innocence. When Vallow Daybell was sentenced last year, she denied having killed her children and cited religious texts and beliefs. She said she had spoken to Jesus, her children and her husband\u2019s wife after their deaths and said they were \u201chappy and extremely busy\u201d in heaven. \u201cJesus Christ knows that no one was murdered in this case,\u201d Vallow Daybell said. \u201cAccidental deaths happen, suicides happen, fatal side effects from medications happen.\u201d Judge Steven W. Boyce said at the sentencing hearing: \u201cI don\u2019t believe that any God in any religion would want to have this happen.\u201d The judge said she justified the killings \u201cby going down a bizarre, religious rabbit hole.

{"id": "2024_05_29_us_scott-laci-peterson-trial-evidence-retest", "text": "After lawyers argued for new DNA testing in the murder case against Scott Peterson, a\u00a0California judge ruled\u00a0Wednesday that only retesting of DNA on duct tape that adhered to his wife Laci Peterson\u2019s pants will be permitted, while testing of other new and prior evidence in the decades-old case will not be allowed. Scott Peterson\u2019s latest bid for a new murder trial comes about 20 years after his conviction. Peterson was convicted of murder in 2004 in the deaths of his wife, Laci, and their unborn son, Conner. He was sentenced to death but that was later overturned and he was resentenced to life without parole. San Mateo County Superior Court Judge Elizabeth Hill said she was only making a determination about evidence, not if Peterson can have a new trial. The duct tape, approximately 15 inches long, \u201cwas found adhering to Laci\u2019s pants on her right thigh.\u201d According to the motion, \u201ca section of the duct tape that was folded over onto itself underwent DNA testing and the presence of human DNA was found, but no DNA profile could be obtained.\u201d On Wednesday, during the post-conviction DNA testing hearing, lawyers for the Los Angeles Innocence Project who had taken up Peterson\u2019s case in January presented evidence they argued was either never looked at or simply omitted from the trial. Of the 14 items requested for retesting, Judge Hill only granted one item - the duct tape found on Laci Peterson. Peterson\u2019s defense team requested\u00a0DNA testing on\u00a0stains found on a mattress discovered in the back of a burned-out van. The charred vehicle was found one day after Laci disappeared \u2013 roughly one mile from where the Petersons lived in Modesto. The lawyers also wanted to examine evidence from a burglary that happened across the street from the Peterson home. They claim Laci may have run into the burglars while they were committing a crime \u2013 a theory that suggests she was murdered because she witnessed the burglary. The judge denied requests for those items. The prosecution argued Scott Peterson is guilty and revisited evidence that led to his double murder conviction. \u201cWe were right then and we are right now, and \u2026 [it] is inappropriate for the defense to continue to try and find the things to drag this case out,\u201d said Dave Harris with the Stanislaus County District Attorney\u2019s office. \u201cThe state of California has a powerful interest in the finality of its judgements,\u201d Harris said. Peterson reported his pregnant wife missing from the couple\u2019s Modesto, California, home in December 2002. Less than four months later, the bodies of Laci and Conner were found washed up in the San Francisco Bay. In November 2004, after a nearly six-month trial, Peterson was found guilty of first-degree murder for Laci\u2019s death and second-degree murder for Conner\u2019s death. Prosecutors alleged that Peterson\u2019s motive for the murders was to escape married life and upcoming fatherhood. The jury recommended the death penalty, which Judge Alfred Delucchi followed. Following Governor Newsom\u2019s moratorium on executions in 2019, Peterson\u2019s death sentence was overturned by the California Supreme Court in 2020. A few months later, the California Supreme Court ordered the San Mateo County Superior Court to reexamine Peterson\u2019s murder convictions because a juror did not disclose involvement in other legal proceedings, including but not limited to \u201cbeing the victim of a crime.\u201d He was resentenced to life without parole in 2021. In 2023, Peterson\u2019s attorneys filed a\u00a0petition for a writ of habeas corpus in which they alleged \u201cviolations of state and federal constitutional rights and state statutory rights, including \u2026 a claim of actual innocence that is supported by newly discovered evidence.\u201d The Los Angeles Innocence Project, a nonprofit that works to exonerate people who are wrongly convicted, later announced it was investigating Peterson\u2019s \u201cclaim of actual innocence.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/29/us/scott-laci-peterson-trial-evidence-retest/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/02/2024", "section": "us"}}

Elijah Hogan, 19, was named valedictorian of Walter L. Cohen High School in New Orleans and graduated May 24 with a 3.93 GPA, he told CNN. Hogan, who became homeless a year and a half ago, says he was in disbelief when he learned of his academic achievement. \u201cI thought they were mistaking me for someone else, but when I looked at it and I was shown evidence that it was me, I was in awe, like, I was jaw dropped,\u201d said Hogan, who was born in New Orleans and raised mostly in Houston. Hogan was one of four Black male students who achieved valedictorian status at their New Orleans schools this spring, CNN affiliate WDSU reported. Hogan, who previously lived with his grandmother since he was 11, says he became homeless after the lease on his grandmother\u2019s house expired when the homeowner decided to sell the property. He and his grandmother were given 30 days to vacate the house, according to Hogan. \u201cFrom there, I made the executive decision to live on my own to lighten my grandmother\u2019s burden,\u201d Hogan told CNN. While his grandmother went to live in a care home for the elderly, Hogan was left without permanent housing. His grandmother told him about the Covenant House, a homeless shelter in New Orleans serving youth and young adults ages 16-22. Hogan has been living at the shelter as part of its transitional housing program since he became homeless, he said. The program allows young people to stay at the shelter up to 24 months rent-free, giving them an opportunity to focus on education or to save money while working, Covenant House New Orleans chief executive officer Rheneisha Robertson told CNN. \u201cIt really allows them to get stable and identify more permanent, stable housing,\u201d said Robertson, who added the homeless shelter had five other high school graduates this year. Hogan, who addressed his graduating class with an uplifting valedictorian speech last week, said dealing with homelessness while completing his education was challenging but he found support from the homeless shelter\u2019s employees and his high school\u2019s staff. \u201cAs time went on, I started to open up to people over at Covenant House as well as Cohen, people were there to support me and give me a guiding hand,\u201d Hogan said. \u201cWithout them, I wouldn\u2019t (have) become who I am today.\u201d He credits his Covenant House case manager, Jarkayla Cobb, with never giving up on him. \u201cShe helped me get through it even when I was showing a lack of faith in myself,\u201d Hogan said. \u201cShe\u2019s been there no matter what I needed.\u201d Hogan, who lost his mother just before he turned 12, says her death encouraged him to push forward with his education for his grandmother\u2019s sake. \u201cI know that\u2019s what (my mother) would have wanted,\u201d he said. Hogan plans to attend Xavier University in New Orleans in the fall to study graphic design and has been granted a scholarship to cover his tuition fees, he says. \u201cElijah\u2019s accomplishments are worth celebrating. We know that they are a product of his character and the choices he made day after day to pursue his dreams,\u201d Jerel Bryant, chief executive officer of Collegiate Academies, which operates Hogan\u2019s former high school, said in a statement. \u201cHis success is also a testament to how capable and excellent our Black youth are, in New Orleans and across this country,\u201d Bryant said. Hogan offered these words of encouragement for other young people: \u201cTo any race, no matter what color or accent you have, you are your own guiding light,\u201d Hogan said. \u201cYou are your own storybook that you write.\u00a0Let yourself be the pen that you write on paper.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/01/us/louisiana-homeless-high-school-valedictorian-trnd/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/02/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_05_31_politics_biden-administration-border-executive-action", "text": "The Biden administration is preparing to roll out a sweeping border executive action as early as Tuesday, according to two sources familiar with the discussions, who cautioned that timing is fluid. White House officials have begun reaching out to mayors who represent cities along the US southern border to potentially join President Joe Biden when he announces the order, two\u00a0other\u00a0sources familiar with those conversations said. For weeks, administration officials have been working through an executive action that would dramatically limit migrants\u2019 ability to seek asylum at the US southern border \u2014 part of a strategy to try to give Biden the upper hand on one of his Republican rival\u2019s key campaign issues. The action is designed to potentially blunt Republican attacks on border security and preempt former President Donald Trump ahead of the first presidential debate, which will be held on June 27 on CNN. Edinburg Mayor\u00a0Ramiro\u00a0Garza confirmed to CNN that the administration contacted him on Saturday to attend a Tuesday event at the White House. The order is expected to be reminiscent of a controversial measure from the Trump era. It involves using an authority known as 212f between ports of entry to try to clamp down on unlawful border crossings. CNN\u00a0previously reported\u00a0that officials were discussing announcing the executive action after Mexico\u2019s election on Sunday and before the first presidential debate. Biden is scheduled to travel to France on Wednesday. \u201cWhile Congressional Republicans chose to stand in the way of additional border enforcement, President Biden will not stop fighting to deliver the resources that border and immigration personnel need to secure our border,\u201d a White House spokesperson said in a statement. \u201cAs we have said before, the Administration continues to explore a series of policy options and we remain committed to taking action to address our broken immigration system.\u201d Several Texas mayors have previously expressed frustration over the hyperpolarization over immigration as tensions between Biden and Texas Gov. Greg Abbott escalated. During his February trip to the US southern border, Biden met with Garza, Brownsville Mayor John Cowen, San Antonio Mayor Ron Nirenberg, and Weslaco Mayor Adrian Gonzalez. A White House official told CNN that no final decisions have been made on additional executive actions. With border arrests down this year, thanks in part to Mexico stepping up its own enforcement efforts in January, the White House is looking to take advantage of a brief reprieve from one of the most politically fraught issues Biden faces in his reelection campaign. Some Democrats on Capitol Hill have also encouraged White House officials to consider having the president make another visit to the border in the coming weeks. A White House spokesperson previously told CNN that no border trip for Biden is under consideration at the moment. Over recent weeks, the administration has trotted out a series of policy changes to try to dissuade migrants from journeying to the US and convince skeptical voters they are working to tighten up immigration at the border. That includes\u00a0rolling out new guidance and regulations that would tighten the immigration system to quickly reject migrants who are ineligible for asylum and speed up court cases for some migrants \u2014 measures Biden officials hope will, in part, keep the number of border crossings low.

{"id": "2024_05_30_us_scripps-spelling-bee-2024-winner", "text": "Bruhat Soma, 12, of Florida won the 96th Scripps National Spelling Bee Thursday night after defeating all seven other finalists and beating his final competitor in the Bee\u2019s second-ever spell-off. Bruhat spelled 29 words correctly during that spell-off, while 12-year-old Faizan Zaki of Texas, spelled 20 words correctly. The two shared a handshake after Bruhat was announced this year\u2019s champion. Spell-offs are special rounds activated to determine a champion once the competition exceeds a certain time and there\u2019s more than one competitor left, according to the Spelling Bee\u2019s rules. In a spell-off, the contestant who spells the most words correctly in 90 seconds wins. \u201cWhen they first announced there was a spell-off, my heart was pumping so fast but then I realized \u2013 because I was practicing spell-offs for six months \u2013 I realized that, \u2018Maybe I have a shot at winning,\u2019\u201d Bruhat told CNN\u2019s John Berman and Kate Bolduan Friday morning. \u201cAnd I did.\u201d The word that crowned Bruhat champion: abseil. He calls those 90 seconds \u201ckind of exhilarating.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m really excited. It\u2019s been my goal for this past year to win, and I\u2019ve been working really hard,\u201d Bruhat said while still on stage, clutching his trophy. \u201cI really can\u2019t describe it, I\u2019m still shaking.\u201d To get to his trophy, Bruhat correctly spelled habitude, indumentum, dehnstufe, Okvik and Hoofddorp, and correctly defined \u201csine qua non.\u201d Many watching on air noticed Bruhat\u2019s method of \u201ctyping\u201d the words while on stage by pantomiming pressing the correct keys for each letter. Bruhat told CNN this motion comes from his practice of typing words into spelling practice websites, and doing so on stage \u201csimulates that experience.\u201d All the preparation \u2013 10 hours of practice on weekends and six hours on weekdays, he told CNN \u2013 worked in Bruhat\u2019s favor. The seventh-grader will take home a $50,000 cash prize, among other rewards. More than 240 spellers competed in this year\u2019s Spelling Bee this week \u2013 and eight made it to Thursday night\u2019s finals. The final kicked off Thursday night at Gaylord National Resort & Convention Center in National Harbor, Maryland, following preliminary, quarterfinal and semifinal segments on Tuesday and Wednesday. The competition\u2019s start this year also featured a short video message from first lady Dr. Jill Biden, who shared she was also once a school Spelling Bee competitor. \u201cThe President and I can\u2019t wait to cheer you on,\u201d she said in the message. In addition to Bruhat and Zaki, the finalists included: YY Liang, 12, from New York; Aditi Muthukumar, 13, from Colorado; Shrey Parikh, 12, from California; Ananya Rao Prassanna, 13, from North Carolina; Rishabh Saha, 14, from California; and Kirsten Tiffany Santos, 13, from Texas. Rishabh and YY were eliminated in the final\u2019s first round after spelling their words \u2013 desmotrope and immanent, respectively \u2013 incorrectly. After all six remaining contestants breezed through the final\u2019s vocabulary round, Kirsten Tiffany was then eliminated when she misspelled apophasis incorrectly. In a later round, Aditi was knocked out of the competition by the word Lillooet. Shrey spelled the word kanin incorrectly. Ananya Rao spelled the word murrina incorrectly. Bruhat had previously competed in the Spelling Bee in 2022, when he tied for 163rd place, and in 2023, when he tied for 74th place, according to the competition\u2019s website. He loves to play badminton, Ping-Pong and basketball \u2013 and his favorite player is LeBron James. This year\u2019s spellers \u2013 all age 15 or under \u2013 came from all 50 states as well as the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, the US Virgin Islands and Department of Defense Schools in Europe. The Bahamas, Canada and Ghana were also represented among the spellers, according to the Bee\u2019s official website. The last time there was a spell-off was in 2022, when winner Harini Logan earned her title of queen bee after spelling 22 words in a minute and a half. While there have been many co-winners, including an eight-person tie in 2019, the spell-off round seeks to weed out the competition to just one champion. According to the 2024 rulebook, there are many instances where a spell-off will be activated, all involving the possibility of no winner at the end of the live broadcast. While\u00a0all finalists\u00a0will receive a monetary prize plus other perks, the winner\u00a0will receive the $50,000 cash, the official trophy, a reference library from Merriam-Webster and reference works from Encyclopedia Britannica, among other buzzworthy prizes. Bruhat was also not the only one who returned to the competition after participating in previous Spelling Bees: as many as 65 spellers returned this year from previous Bees, including finalists Aditi, Shrey, Ananya Rao, Kirsten\u00a0Tiffany and Faizan.

{"id": "2024_06_01_economy_homeowners-insurance-cost-hurricane-weather", "text": "June 1 marks the official start of hurricane season in the Atlantic Ocean, and meteorologists predict it will be \u201cextremely active,\u201d with the potential for seven\u00a0major hurricanes\u00a0\u2013 the most destructive categories. And as insurance companies struggle to stay afloat, battered by elevated inflation and the growing frequency of catastrophic storms made worse by climate change, it\u2019s become even tougher for homeowners to find affordable insurance options. Just last year, rates jumped 11.3% nationwide, according to S&P Global, and experts don\u2019t expect a reprieve this year. And while there are ways to try and save money on insurance costs, moving to a state with minimal hurricane risk isn\u2019t going to be enough anymore. States like Arizona, Illinois and Utah, which aren\u2019t generally considered at risk from hurricane damage, have seen increases that far outpaced the national average last year. What\u2019s behind insurance price hikes? For decades, homeowners insurance was considered a very stable line of business for insurance companies, said Chuck Nyce, a professor of risk management and insurance at Florida State University. Most claims involved events affecting a single home, like an electrical fire or a washing machine leak. But more recently, there has been an uptick in catastrophic hurricanes, wildfires\u00a0and convective storms \u2013 like severe thunderstorms and tornadoes,\u00a0Nyce said. \u201cThese storms don\u2019t only affect one property at a time. They affect a large number of properties,\u201d he said. \u201cThat changes the dynamic for an insurance company.\u201d And unlike hurricanes and wildfires, severe convective storms are hitting states that were once considered relatively \u201csafe\u201d from most natural disasters, driving up insurance costs. Last year was the worst year for the homeowners insurance industry in over a decade, according to a May report from S&P Global. \u201cInflationary pressures, a devastating wildfire in Hawaii and a record-breaking number of billion-dollar loss events from convective storms weighed on the industry\u2019s results in 2023,\u201d the report said. The US homeowners insurance industry saw net losses jump to $101.29 billion in 2023, according to the report. Only two of the 20 largest US homeowners\u2019 insurance companies were profitable last year. And today\u2019s elevated inflaton means that when property gets damaged, it costs insurance companies significantly more to make repairs compared to a few years ago, said Lynne McChristian, the director of the office of risk management and insurance research at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. \u201cThe thing that many people don\u2019t realize is what you pay for property insurance is based on the rebuilding cost of your home, not the real estate value,\u201d she said. \u201cUnderstand that the price you pay for insurance is sending you a signal.\u201d The higher the premiums, the more likely the area you live in is at risk, she said. What happens if I can\u2019t get insurance? As insurance companies struggle to make a profit, policyholders lose out, as well. Some are subject to rate increases, while others are losing their coverage altogether. Florida and California have been hit particularly hard by this phenomenon. Many national insurers have withdrawn property coverage from those states due to elevated risks of hurricanes and wildfires, respectively. But the issue is spreading: states like Louisiana, North Carolina and Texas are seeing insurers head for the exits, as well. While property insurance is not mandated by law, most lenders require it for mortgage holders. That can leave many homeowners carrying mortgages scrambling if they are unexpectedly dropped from their insurance. Most states have something called an \u201cinsurer of last resort,\u201d which is a state government-backed insurance provider designed to fill coverage gaps in the private insurance market. These state-backed insurance plans vary by state, but they can be costly or provide less coverage, said Nyce. Still, these government-backed insurance companies have ballooned in popularity as some homeowners run out of options. Last year, Florida\u2019s state-backed Citizens Property Insurance Corp. became the 10th largest homeowners\u2019 insurer in the US, S&P Global said. How to lower insurance costs For those who still have insurance options in their area but are worried about increased costs, there are some simple ways to lower your insurance costs. Nyce said it\u2019s important to shop around every couple of years to see if other companies are offering more competitive rates. \u201cSome insurance companies may be looking to add business in your area. They may be willing to sell something at a lower rate to gain market share,\u201d he said. Raising your deductible, the amount of money a person must pay before your insurance kicks in, could also help lower premiums, if you can afford it, Nyce said. But another way to protect yourself is to shell out money now to \u201charden\u201d your home in order to avoid high insurance costs when the next disaster strikes. That can mean investing in ways to fortify your home\u2019s structure, like metal straps that attach your roof to a home\u2019s walls and wind-resistant garage doors, said Aris Papadopoulos, who works at Florida International University\u2019s Extreme Events Institute. \u201cWe all love to have a pretty kitchen, pretty closets and bathrooms, but before you do any of that, make sure your house is strong,\u201d he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/01/economy/homeowners-insurance-cost-hurricane-weather/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/02/2024", "section": "us"}}

Prominent Trump supporters such as Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and former national security adviser Michael Flynn posted pictures of upside-down flags on social media soon after a New York jury found Trump guilty Thursday. Flynn, a retired three-star general, made the image his profile picture on X. By Friday, pro-Trump social media accounts were awash with images of inverted flags hanging on porches and lawns across the country. The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, posted an image appearing to show the flag hanging upside down above its Washington, DC, headquarters. In California, dozens of American flags that were placed outside a library in Monrovia in Los Angeles County to commemorate Memorial Day were turned upside down overnight Thursday, local news station KTLA reported. It is not clear who was responsible for the stunt.\u00a0\u201cThe city was very surprised to learn someone inverted the flags, which were set up in honor of our community\u2019s veterans. We were able to reset them correctly with the help of staff and community members,\u201d Dylan Feik, Monrovia\u2019s city manager, told CNN on Saturday. The practice of inverting the Stars and Stripes has received renewed scrutiny after The New York Times revealed last month that an upside-down US flag was seen outside the Alito household in January 2021 \u2013 at a time when the practice was a symbol for Trump supporters who falsely claimed widespread fraud in the 2020 election. Justice Alito said his wife hoisted the symbol of discontent in response to a neighborhood dispute. Respect for the flag is outlined in US code, which states, \u201cThe flag should never be displayed with the union down, except as a signal of dire distress in instances of extreme danger to life or property.\u201d Over the weekend, however, the trend seemed to be gaining steam. Country music star Jason Aldean \u2013 no stranger to political controversy \u2013 posted an image of an inverted flag to his 4.4 million followers on Instagram after the verdict Thursday, writing, \u201cScary times in our country right now, man.

Michelle Troconis, the ex-girlfriend of Fotis Dulos, who was charged with his wife\u2019s\u00a0murder\u00a0but\u00a0died by an apparent suicide\u00a0in January 2020 before he went to trial, was also sentenced to five years of probation for her involvement in the disappearance and murder of Jennifer Dulos. Troconis was found guilty in March of one count of conspiracy to commit murder, one count of hindering prosecution, two counts of conspiracy to commit tampering with physical evidence and two counts of tampering with physical evidence. She had pleaded not guilty. After Troconis received her sentence, her attorney told the court they intended to appeal. Troconis had dated Fotis Dulos, who was charged with murder, felony murder and kidnapping before he was found dead in January 2020. Jennifer Dulos\u00a0was last seen in May 2019\u00a0after dropping her children off at school. Friends reported her missing after she failed to show up for appointments and had no communication with them for 10 hours.\u00a0She was in the middle of a contentious divorce and custody battle with Fotis Dulos at the time of her disappearance, CNN has previously reported. Despite her body never being found, Dulos was officially pronounced dead through a declaration of death by a Connecticut judge in October 2023, a court document shows. She likely suffered a combination of\u00a0\u201ctraumatic, blunt-force injuries,\u201d\u00a0according to the state\u2019s chief medical examiner. Authorities found a bloodlike stain in three places on her vehicle, which was parked in her garage in New Canaan. Her DNA was found in the stains and on the garage wall and door. Both Fotis Dulos and Troconis were previously arrested on suspicion of evidence tampering in the disappearance. They pleaded not guilty to evidence tampering after investigators found a \u201cbloodlike substance\u201d with Jennifer Dulos\u2019 DNA in a truck he had access to the day she disappeared. Jennifer Dulos had told officials she was afraid of him before her disappearance, according to court documents obtained by CNN. \u201cI know that filing for divorce and filing this motion will enrage him,\u201d she said, according to the documents. \u201cI know he will retaliate by trying to harm me in some way.\u201d \u2018She was the best mom\u2019 During Troconis\u2019 sentencing Friday, Dulos\u2019 loved ones were present in court and gave emotional victim impact statements. \u201cThe day Jennifer disappeared, I knew something terrible had happened,\u201d Gloria Farber, Jennifer\u00a0Dulos\u2019 mother, said during her victim impact statement. \u201cI loved Jennifer since the day she was born,\u201d Melissa Farber, Jennifer\u00a0Dulos\u2019 sister, said during her victim impact statement. \u201cI miss Jennifer\u2019s intelligence, her soft, sweet voice, and the sound of her laughter. There are really no words to adequately express what losing my sister, Jennifer, has meant to me.\u201d Troconis\u00a0appeared to be upset during several of the victim impact statements. \u201cMy mother was the best mom I could ever ask for. She loved me and my\u00a0siblings\u00a0unconditionally,\u201d Theodore\u00a0Dulos, Jennifer\u00a0Dulos\u2019\u00a0son, said during his\u00a0victim impact statement. \u201cI no longer have my mother, my hero.

{"id": "2024_05_31_us_appeal-to-heaven-flag-meaning-cec", "text": "Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito has been criticized for\u00a0a flag flown at his New Jersey vacation house\u00a0that has ties to both the American Revolution and far-right ideologies. The \u201cAppeal to Heaven\u201d flag, as it is commonly called, also stands outside of House Speaker Mike Johnson\u2019s office in the Capitol building and has been\u00a0proudly displayed\u00a0by other\u00a0Republican lawmakers. It has also appeared among crowds at far-right rallies and at the January 6 Capitol insurrection. Like many flags and historical symbols, the Appeal to Heaven flag has multiple meanings and has been used in differing capacities. The\u00a0flag served as a naval ensign\u00a0in Massachusetts until 1971, and until recently, flew outside San Francisco\u2019s city hall alongside other historic flags. Here\u2019s a look at its long history, and why it is controversial for some people now. What is \u2018An Appeal to Heaven?\u2019 The Appeal to Heaven flag, or \u201cPine Tree\u201d flag, features a green pine tree on a white field, with the words \u201cAn Appeal to Heaven\u201d in black text above it. It was originally commissioned under\u00a0George Washington\u2019s leadership\u00a0of the Continental Army during the Revolutionary War, a history that Alito, Johnson and others point to when defending their own use of the flag against claims of right-wing extremist views. The phrase \u201cAn Appeal to Heaven\u201d comes from a passage of British philosopher John Locke\u2019s \u201cSecond Treatise on Government\u201d that outlines his interpretation of\u00a0a people\u2019s right to revolution: \u201cAnd where the body of the people, or any single man, is deprived of their right, or is under the exercise of a power without right, and have no appeal on earth, then they have a liberty to appeal to heaven, whenever they judge the cause of sufficient moment.\u201d As for the pine tree, it became a symbol of American resistance after the\u00a0Pine Tree Riot, one of several clashes between American colonists and British royal powers that led to the American Revolution. The pine tree\u00a0retained this meaning of resistance, and has appeared on some\u00a0state flags\u00a0and\u00a0seals. The pine tree is also still a beloved regional symbol in New England. A similar flag \u2014 with a green pine in a white canton on a red field \u2014 is flown throughout the region. How the flag came to be associated with far-right politics The Appeal to Heaven flag is now also associated with American far-right movements and supporters of former President Donald Trump. The flag has appeared at Trump rallies, and it appeared among crowds at the January 6 insurrection. It is also ingrained into the\u00a0rhetoric of Christian Nationalism. However, its gradual integration into far-right politics actually started far before the Trump era \u2014 and its significance during the American Revolution is a key reason why. \u201cThis flag is part of a broader effort by the far right to recall the principles of the American Revolution and import them into antidemocratic efforts,\u201d says\u00a0Jemar Tisby, an author and professor at Simmons College in Kentucky who studies Christian nationalism. The American Revolution, Tisby says, is seen by these groups as a \u201crighteous rebellion against an unjust, intrusive government,\u201d and thus a fertile ground from which to reap symbols and ideologies for their current political aims. This theme can be traced back to the emergence of the\u00a0tea party movement\u00a0(another homage to the American Revolution), the conservative political movement that took root in the early days of President Barack Obama\u2019s first term around 2009. The Tea Party movement called for a reduction in government influence, but was also closely related to far-right populism and\u00a0racial animus\u00a0in response to Obama\u2019s election to office. It greatly influenced the Republican party and was\u00a0leveraged by Trump\u00a0during his victorious 2016 presidential campaign. Around this time another Revolutionary-era flag, the Gadsden flag, also began to see a resurgence. Depicting a black snake on a yellow background with the words \u201cDon\u2019t Tread on Me,\u201d the Gadsden flag is now a common symbol among libertarian and conservative groups \u2014 and it, too, is often flown\u00a0during far-right gatherings. In 2015, the Appeal to Heaven flag was given another boost in popularity by Dutch Sheets, an influential conservative Christian author and pastor. Sheets organized a nationwide tour that year called \u201cAn Appeal to Heaven\u201d during which he specifically linked the flag, and the American Revolution, to concepts of Christian nationalism. At a\u00a0tour stop in Ohio in 2015, Sheets invoked the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision on same-sex marriage and ongoing political battles about abortion rights. \u201cIt\u2019s not settled law until God says it\u2019s settled law and we\u2019re going to change these things,\u201d Sheets said. \u201cThere\u2019s got to be a hope that comes. If we appeal to heaven, he can turn this thing around.\u201d This, Tisby says, is another way the flag\u2019s message can be co-opted by Christian nationalists. \u201cThis is why the Appeal to Heaven flag is also a symbol of White Christian nationalism, because it links their cause to God\u2019s will as an appeal to heaven or a higher power,\u201d he says. \u201cThat way, the movement appears to transcend political earthly authority, and becomes a divine right.\u201d Recent events have shed new light on the flag\u2019s meanings Until recently, the Appeal to Heaven flag was relatively unknown in the public consciousness. When the\u00a0Associated Press\u00a0asked Speaker Mike Johnson about the one displayed outside his office, he said he wasn\u2019t aware the flag was associated with far-right politics or the \u201cStop the Steal\u201d movement. \u201cPeople misuse our symbols all the time. It doesn\u2019t mean we don\u2019t use the symbols anymore,\u201d he said. Alito said the flag seen flying outside his vacation home was selected by his wife and was an homage to George Washington. \u201cI was not aware of any connection between that historic flag and the \u2018Stop the Steal Movement,\u2019 and neither was my wife,\u201d\u00a0Alito told lawmakers\u00a0in a letter stating his refusal to recuse from cases involving the 2020 presidential election or the January 6 insurrection. \u201cShe did not fly it to associate herself with that or any other group, and the use of an old historic flag by a new group does not necessarily drain that flag of all other meanings.\u201d Alito is also under scrutiny for an\u00a0upside-down American flag\u00a0that was spotted outside his home in early 2021 \u2014 a universal symbol of a country in crisis. Alito said this, too, was his wife\u2019s decision. However, the polarizing recent history of the Appeal to Heaven flag is starting to become known. This week, the city of San Francisco made the decision to remove an \u201cAppeal to Heaven\u201d flag that flew alongside several other flags over City Hall. \u201cThis flag was originally used during the American Revolutionary War, flown by George Washington\u2019s cruisers, and is associated with the early quest for American independence,\u201d San Francisco Recreation and Parks communications manager Daniel Montez told CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s since been adopted by a different group \u2014 one that doesn\u2019t represent the city\u2019s values, so we made the decision to swap it with the American flag.\u201d CNN\u2019s Josh Du Lac contributed to this story.\u00a0", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/31/us/appeal-to-heaven-flag-meaning-cec/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/02/2024", "section": "us"}}

The incidents took place at Margaret Neary Elementary School, according to CNN affiliate WCVB, and were reported to Gregory Martineau, superintendent of the Public Schools of Northborough and Southborough, in April. The school district is about 30 miles west of Boston. In January, the teacher \u2013 who is not named in the letter \u2013 held an \u201cimpromptu mock slave auction\u201d during a lesson on the Atlantic triangle slave trade, during which slave auctions were discussed, the letter said. \u201cThe educator asked two children sitting in front of the room, who were of color, to stand, and the educator and class discussed physical attributes (i.e., teeth and strength),\u201d Martineau said. The second incident took place in April, and in that instance, the same educator used the N-word while reading a book, which was not part of the fifth-grade curriculum, to students, the letter said. \u201cIt was later brought to the District\u2019s attention that the \u2018N-word\u2019 does not appear in the book,\u201d Martineau said. \u201cDehumanizing words such as slurs should not be spoken by employees or students. Using such words can harm students and negatively impact an open discussion on a particular topic.\u201d Martineau also condemned the teacher\u2019s actions in holding a mock slave auction, calling the action \u201cunacceptable\u201d and a violation of the district\u2019s core values. He also noted the damaging impact that such role-playing methods in lessons on historical atrocities or trauma can have on students of color. Parents of students in the class met with the teacher and the principal to discuss the two incidents in April, but the next day, Martineau said the teacher \u201cinappropriately called out the student who had reported the educator\u2019s use of the racial slur, which is not acceptable.\u201d That is when the district began a formal investigation, and the teacher was placed on paid administrative leave, the letter said. The school\u2019s principal was placed on a 10-day paid administrative leave in May. \u201cCurrently, the District is engaged in due process procedures with the educator who remains on leave. All personnel matters will remain confidential,\u201d Martineau said. Martineau went on to apologize for the events that took place at the school and said the district\u2019s \u201ccultural competency\u201d will improve. \u201cI acknowledge that there were missteps in this process that further complicated the situation. Ultimately, I am responsible for ensuring students are in safe and supportive learning environments,\u201d he said.

Her family alleges discrimination and negligence contributed to her death. The family of Sahana Ramesh filed a lawsuit\u00a0in Washington\u2019s King County Superior Court against Seattle Children\u2019s hospital, Children\u2019s University Medical Group and\u00a0several unnamed healthcare workers. Sahana\u00a0died from eosinophilic\u00a0myocarditis, an inflammation of the heart muscle,\u00a0in February 2021, according to the complaint. The lawsuit was first filed in 2022 by Sahana\u2019s parents Nalini and Anapathur Ramesh and their son,\u00a0Karthik,\u00a0and alleged negligence but was amended to include racial discrimination allegations,\u00a0according to court documents. Last week, King County Superior Court Judge Elizabeth Berns declined a motion brought by the hospital to dismiss the discrimination claim, court documents show. In her order, Berns wrote the family have \u201cplausibly alleged harm, including dignitary harm, resulting from unlawful discrimination \u2013 not from healthcare.\u201d In August\u00a02020, the family of South Asian descent sought medical treatment at Seattle Children\u2019s\u00a0because Sahana had recurring seizures, which led to a hospital neurologist\u00a0prescribing her lamotrigine, a drug used to prevent or control seizures, the suit says. Sahana\u2019s dosage was doubled shortly after she began taking it and increased by 50 percent that November. She then developed a\u00a0rash on several parts of her body including her hands, stomach, feet and face, the suit says. Within days, the rash worsened, and she was taken to the emergency department of Seattle Children\u2019s,\u00a0where she was diagnosed with a syndrome known as Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms or DRESS, according to the lawsuit. DRESS is a drug allergy that causes fever, rash, facial swelling, enlarged lymph nodes, kidney or liver injury, and in some cases inflammation of organs, according to the\u00a0American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology. Sahana was discharged after the diagnosis, but her symptoms didn\u2019t improve, her family claims in the suit. Over nearly three months, the family sought medical care from the defendants more than a dozen\u00a0times. During that time, her lab results also showed issues with her liver and organ function, the lawsuit says. But\u00a0the \u201cdefendants assured plaintiffs that Sahana could safely be cared for at home,\u201d according to the lawsuit. A spokesperson for Seattle Children\u2019s told CNN, \u201cOur hearts go out to any family mourning the loss of a child and we take our responsibility to provide equitable, high-quality care seriously, but cannot comment on this specific case due to pending litigation.\u201d CNN has reached out to Children\u2019s University Medical Group for comment. Steve Berman, an attorney for the Ramesh family, described Sahana\u2019s death as her family\u2019s \u201cultimate loss\u201d that could have been avoided. \u201cWe believe this was an avoidable tragedy that evidence shows was directly caused by negligence and lack of informed consent, rooted in widespread racism at the hospital,\u201d Berman said in a statement. The lawsuit points to several racial discrimination allegations made against the hospital, including claims that led to\u00a0a 2021 independent review\u00a0of equity, diversity and inclusion policies and practices. The review\u00a0concluded that allegations that a physician called another physician a racist epithet in 2009\u00a0were not adequately investigated by the hospital, and that there was a lack of action to minimize racial disparities in security calls, among other findings, according to a\u00a0summary made public by the hospital. In the lawsuit, attorneys for the family said their clients felt\u00a0ignored and dismissed during their interactions with medical staff and felt \u201cthat they were not welcome, accepted, desired, or solicited at SCH.\u201d The family also alleges in the lawsuit that hospital staff didn\u2019t monitor Sahana\u2019s heart and failed to inform them of the risk of cardiac failure related to DRESS.

The Georgia man, Mark Andrews,\u00a0said in his 2022 lawsuit\u00a0that\u00a0\u201c2000 Mules,\u201d a film and book by far-right activist\u00a0Dinesh D\u2019Souza contained a string of bogus claims about the 2020 election, leading to\u00a0threats of violence against him and his family. Andrews said the film, which\u00a0has been repeatedly\u00a0promoted by Donald Trump and widely circulated in right-wing media as\u00a0supposed proof that the 2020 election was stolen,\u00a0had severely damaged his reputation. \u201cIt was never our intent that the publication of the 2000 Mules film and book would harm Mr. Andrews,\u201d Salem said in a\u00a0Friday statement. \u201cWe apologize for the hurt the inclusion of Mr. Andrews\u2019 image in the movie, book, and promotional materials have caused Mr. Andrews and his family.\u201d \u201cWe have removed the film from Salem\u2019s platforms, and there will be no future distribution of the film or the book by Salem,\u201d the right-wing company added. The apology from Salem came as part of a larger settlement to the lawsuit filed by Andrews. A representative for Protect Democracy, a nonprofit group that sued Salem on behalf of Andrews, did not comment on the terms of the settlement. Neither did a representative for Salem. Salem operates a national talk radio\u00a0network,\u00a0distributing the\u00a0programs\u00a0of several prominent pro-Trump personalities such as Charlie Kirk and Sebastian Gorka, to\u00a0more than 2,700 affiliates.\u00a0It also\u00a0owns dozens of Christian-format radio stations\u00a0and the right-wing political website\u00a0Townhall. In the \u201c2000 Mules\u201d film,\u00a0Andrews was featured\u00a0on video\u00a0with his face blurred\u00a0depositing\u00a0his ballot, along with those belonging to his family, into a drop box in what the film purported was a so-called \u201cmule\u201d operation. \u201cWhat you are seeing is a crime,\u201d a voiceover from D\u2019Souza\u00a0declared. \u201cThese are fraudulent votes.\u201d Salem said in its Friday statement that it \u201crelied on representations\u201d that D\u2019Souza\u00a0had\u00a0made. \u201cWe have learned that the Georgia Bureau of Investigation has cleared Mr. Andrews of illegal voting activity in connection with the event depicted in 2000 Mules,\u201d the company said. In the aftermath of the 2020 election, Trump\u2019s media allies promoted false claims that the election had been stolen by then-candidate Joe Biden. While the claims were false, polls have indicated that the lies were effective, convincing the majority of the Republican Party that Biden\u2019s election was illegitimate. Those election lies, however, have\u00a0led to legal consequences for outlets that promoted the claims,\u00a0with right-wing media companies\u00a0facing\u00a0a slew of costly lawsuits stemming from their coverage of the 2020 election.\u00a0Last month,\u00a0the pro-Trump network One America News\u00a0settled a lawsuit\u00a0brought by voting technology company Smartmatic over the outlet\u2019s promotion of lies about the 2020 election.

The lawsuit alleges Brett McAlpin \u2013 a former Rankin County deputy and a member of the \u201cGoon Squad\u201d who is serving 27 years in prison for brutalizing two Black men \u2013 as well as Deputy Ricky Davis and seven unidentified deputies and trustees beat Christopher Mack for 45 minutes while he was in their custody at the Rankin County Jail. Rankin County is also named as a defendant in the lawsuit. Mack was transported to the jail on May 27, 2021, after being arrested in the city of Pearl, the lawsuit says. The lawsuit alleges McAlpin, along with another deputy, tried to interrogate Mack about \u201cinformation he had about drugs and gangs.\u201d \u201cMack exercised his Constitutional right to remain silent,\u201d the lawsuit said. Mack was then hit \u201cin the back of the head with a set of heavy steel jail keys,\u201d by a deputy who was not fully identified, according to the filing. McAlpin then joined the deputy and Ricky Davis in beating Mack. According to the lawsuit, after the three deputies beat Mack, he \u201cwas then dragged by the officers into Central Pod 6 where six unknown officers, and/or trustees \u2026 beat Mack for forty-five minutes.\u201d As a result of the beating, Mack says he sustained broken ribs, a broken nose and was throwing up blood. Photos of the purported injuries were also part of the court filing. \u201cOnce Mack was released from the hospital (Rankin County) Sheriff Bryan Bailey asked Mack \u2018Who did that to you?\u2019 Mack responded, \u2018some of your other deputies and trusties.\u2019 Sheriff Bailey replied, \u2018F*ck!!\u2019 and walked off,\u201d according to the lawsuit. McAlpin was the highest ranking of six law enforcement officers who pleaded guilty in 2023 to beating and torturing two black men, Michael Jenkins and Eddie Parker. McAlpin and the others, who had previously worked for the Rankin County Sheriff\u2019s department, were part of a group that called themselves the \u201cGoon Squad\u201d because of their willingness to use excessive force and not report it, according to a federal charging document. McAlpin is incarcerated at Federal Correctional Institution McDowell in southern West Virginia for the incident involving Jenkins and Parker. He is appealing his sentence, according to court filings. During the sentencing, federal prosecutors compared McAlpin to a \u201cmafia don,\u201d saying, \u201cWithout McAlpin, \u2018the Goon Squad\u2019 would not exist. He was the one calling the shots.\u201d None of those named in the civil lawsuit have been criminally charged with beating Mack. An attorney for Rankin County declined to comment on the allegations. CNN has reached out to the attorney for the sheriff\u2019s department about the lawsuit and the incident involving Mack but has not received any comment.

Jose Antonio Ibarra, 26, was indicted on 10 counts in all: malice murder, three counts of felony murder, kidnapping with bodily injury, aggravated assault with intent to rape, aggravated battery, obstructing a person making an emergency call, tampering with evidence and peeping Tom, according to the indictment. Riley, a 22-year-old Augusta University College of Nursing student, was killed on February\u00a022 while out for a run on the University of Georgia\u2019s campus. Ibarra struck Riley in the head with a rock multiple times and asphyxiated her, according to the indictment. In addition, he was charged under Georgia\u2019s \u201cpeeping Tom\u201d law for allegedly going to a University of Georgia apartment building on the same day as the murder, looking through the window and spying on a student, the indictment states. Ibarra was arrested a day later and had been charged with\u00a0felony murder, false imprisonment and kidnapping and concealing the death of another, according to jail records. The public defender\u2019s office representing Ibarra declined to comment on the indictment. Ibarra, of Athens, Georgia, is an undocumented immigrant from Venezuela who was not a university student.

{"id": "2024_06_01_business_cracker-barrel-relevant-early-bird", "text": "Cracker Barrel CEO Julie Felss Masino recently gave a devastatingly frank assessment of the brand: \u201cWe\u2019re just not as relevant as we once were.\u201d Masino, who became CEO in July, laid out the diagnosis \u2014 and the remedies \u2014 in a May presentation to analysts. And it raises questions for those accustomed to the brand\u2019s biscuits and gravy, wooden tables and chairs, brain puzzler games and front porch rocking chairs. \u201cThe way we communicate, the things on the menu, the way the stores look and feel \u2026 all of these things came up time and time again in our research as opportunities for us to really regain relevancy,\u201d she said. The revamped Cracker Barrel Old Country Store (the brand\u2019s full name) could include remodeled restaurants with bookcases instead of lattice dividers and brand new banquette seating. New Cracker Barrels might be smaller restaurants altogether, with menus that include new items like green chili cornbread and banana pudding. Customers may see brighter interiors with simpler decor, a move away from the typical cozy clutter. Those changes are still just being tested. One new thing happening now? Discounted dinner from 4 to 6 p.m. Why would Cracker Barrel, so desperate for relevancy, lean into a tactic typically used to attract senior citizens? Partially because many people are eating early these days. And partially because it\u2019s looking for a quick fix. We\u2019re all early birds now Cracker Barrel, which first opened in 1969, has long billed itself as a roadside place where weary travelers can stop for a hearty meal in a homey dining room, and also pick from a large selection of knick knacks at its country store. That pitch, which has in the past largely appealed to Baby Boomers, hasn\u2019t resonated very well since the pandemic. Last year, when other diners returned to restaurants after the early pandemic years, Cracker Barrel\u2019s older clientele remained cautious, visiting the chain less often. Now, its retail stores are taking a hit as consumers pull back on spending. Those same dynamics are playing out in its restaurants. In the three months ended on April 26, Cracker Barrel\u2019s total revenue fell 1.9% compared to the year before, the company reported Thursday. Retail sales at stores open at least 18 months fell 3.8%, while restaurant sales fell 1.5%. Wall Street has not been impressed: The company\u2019s stock has declined nearly 37% this year, and has plunged about 70% over the past five years. The Tennessee-based chain owns its roughly 660 locations, which can be found throughout the country. These new early-bird deals, which launched in February, are available Monday through Friday from 4 to 6 pm. They start at $8.99 and include reduced portions of Cracker Barrel\u2019s signature country comfort food, like meatloaf and chicken.  Masino didn\u2019t explicitly mention the specials during the discussion about the long-term strategy for Cracker Barrel. But she did point to the offering during the company\u2019s earnings call on Thursday. It \u201cis a big piece of our overall pricing strategy,\u201d Masino said. In some ways, an early bird special is a perfect solution \u2014\u00a0it may appeal to both Covid-cautious seniors on a budget and younger consumers who are eating earlier. \u201cSix o\u2019clock is the new eight o\u2019clock,\u201d said Lisa W. Miller, a consumer strategist who has consulted for large restaurant chains through her company, Lisa W. Miller & Associates. \u201cThat four to six time period \u2026 can attract a younger family, as well.\u201d The Wall Street Journal declared over the summer that \u201cAmerica is becoming a nation of early birds.\u201d And in recent years, late night dining options have dwindled. Fewer people visited Cracker Barrel before 9 AM and after 6 PM in the first quarter this year compared to that period in 2019, according to data from Placer.ai, which uses location data from mobile devices to estimate visits to specific restaurants and retail locations. Instead, the chain has \u201cseen an increase in late morning and lunch visits,\u201d said RJ Hottovy, head of analytical research at Placer.ai. It\u2019s also seen an increase in the late afternoon, but a smaller one. The discrepancy \u201cmay explain the emphasis on early-bird specials,\u201d he said. Enticing younger consumers during that earlier period will depend somewhat on how the company advertises the deal, noted Miller. \u201cIt\u2019s all going to depend \u2026 on the creative executions \u2014 how are they going after it?\u201d Masino said Thursday that Cracker Barrel was so eager to rush out the promotion that it only recently started advertising the special. But breaking the association between early dinners and senior citizens will be hard, said John A. Gordon, founder and CEO of Pacific Management Consulting Group, a restaurant consultancy. \u201cIt\u2019s so well known in this country that seniors go out to eat earlier,\u201d he said. \u201cAlthough that\u2019s changing \u2026 it is  burned into people\u2019s psyche, that that is designated for seniors.\u201d Deals, deals, deals The company expects it to take years to revamp its brand, operations and restaurant models. But it needs to start improving sales sooner. And right now, consumers want deals. Fast food companies are once again battling over dollars and cents, with many rolling out $5 bundles. Casual dining restaurants like Chili\u2019s and Applebee\u2019s are vying for customers with their own specials.

{"id": "2024_06_01_us_tonette-jackson-remains-hurricane-katrina", "text": "For anyone\u00a0who watched the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina from afar, the vast devastation could have been captured by a single heartbreaking news interview. A reporter from Gulf Coast TV station\u00a0WKRG stopped Hardy Jackson as he walked the streets after the towering flood receded in Biloxi, Mississippi. He couldn\u2019t find his 46-year-old wife\u2019s body. \u201cShe\u2019s gone,\u201d he told the then-CNN affiliate. Hardy and Tonette Jackson had been at home when Katrina hit in August 2005. They didn\u2019t expect the water to rise so quickly, he explained. And as they moved to the attic, their house collapsed. Hardy held onto a tree while also holding Tonette\u2019s hand. But after a while, she realized he couldn\u2019t hold on much longer, he continued. Tonette\u2019s last request of him was to take care of their children and grandchildren. They let go. Soon after, Hardy stood with two boys in Biloxi, looked around at the ruins left by the flood and observed: \u201cWe\u00a0ain\u2019t\u00a0got nowhere to go, nowhere to go. I\u2019m, I\u2019m lost. That\u2019s all I had. That\u2019s all I had.\u201d A week later, search crews found a body inland of Biloxi in St. Martin between slabs where two homes had been. But the remains couldn\u2019t be identified, and so they were buried at\u00a0Machpelah Cemetery in nearby Pascagoula under the name Jane (Love), according to information cited by Mississippi officials. Meanwhile, the Jacksons could not find their matriarch. Tonette became one of 12,000 people reportedly missing in Louisiana and Mississippi after one of the strongest hurricanes in US history, with 1,392 fatalities and damages of\u00a0$125 billion. For the next five years, Hardy kept his promise to care for the children and grandchildren. But still, he and his family could not give Tonette a proper burial. \u201cThey say my wife\u2019s body gone to the bay. There\u2019s nothing I can do,\u201d Hardy told CNN in 2010. \u201cMany times I woke up, I\u2019ve been wishing it was a dream.\u201d And in 2013, Hardy passed away, his kin no closer to finding Tonette than they\u2019d been when the storm swirled away from the shore.   \u2018It shouldn\u2019t have taken this long\u2019 The next decade saw major advances in DNA technology set the stage for new breaks in infamous unsolved crimes and missing persons cases. In Mississippi, the Bureau of Investigations and the State Medical Examiner\u2019s Office took notice. In 2023, a task force of those agencies set about once again trying to identify the unnamed Katrina victim found between those two slabs north of Biloxi, according the narrative cited by the bureau. Experts exhumed the remains of Jane (Love) and sent them to Othram, a Texas-based company that used forensic genetic genealogy \u2013 a blend of DNA analysis and traditional family-tree research \u2013 to come up with leads for the state Investigations Bureau, according to a company news release. Othram\u00a0had helped Mississippi officials investigate other cases, bureau Special Agent Christa Groom told CNN. Funding came from Carla Davis, a philanthropist and genealogist at\u00a0Othram \u201ccommitted to resolving the backlog of cold cases\u201d in the state, the company said. Using Othram\u2019s leads and \u201cadditional DNA testing of a close family member\u201d of Tonette Jackson, a match for Jane (Love) was revealed: After almost 19 years, science revealed the remains found a week after Katrina in St. Martin belonged to Tonette, the news release states. Finally, her family could reclaim her remains. And officials could close the case of one more name etched into Mississippi\u2019s granite memorial to those taken by Katrina. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t have taken this long,\u00a0yet here we are,\u201d said Davis, the special agent, adding she is \u201cjust glad to get them some closure.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a good feeling to know that\u00a0you\u2019ve helped them kind of be at peace because they waited a long time for this.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/01/us/tonette-jackson-remains-hurricane-katrina/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/02/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_01_politics_recap-trump-hush-money-trial", "text": "Former President Donald Trump was convicted this week of 34 counts of felony business fraud in connection with hush money payments to adult film star Stormy Daniels before the 2016 presidential election. Trump will be sentenced on July 11 and has pledged to appeal the conviction. The guilty verdict, while a major political moment, does not prevent Trump from continuing his presidential campaign nor from serving should he win the White House. Here\u2019s how we got here and what\u2019s next: The indictment Trump was indicted in March 2023 by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, a Democrat, on 34 charges tied to the hush money payments. The indictment alleged that Trump was a part of an illegal conspiracy to\u00a0undermine\u00a0the integrity of the 2016 election. While hush money payments are not illegal in themselves, each charge was tied to a specific allegedly false entry among the financial records of the Trump Organization. Trump has argued that the payments to Michael Cohen, his former fixer who paid Daniels, were correctly labeled as legal expenses. Key witnesses and evidence The physical evidence was key. Prosecutors showed checks and ledgers demonstrating payments from Trump\u2019s company to his former attorney, including a handwritten note outlining a payment plan for Cohen. CNN\u2019s Way Mullery has a great look at the documents here. David Pecker, the former publisher of the National Enquirer, testified that his company worked with Cohen on Trump\u2019s behalf to squash unflattering stories during the 2016 election. He also spoke about putting up the money to catch-and-kill the rights to former Playboy model Karen McDougal\u2019s story about an alleged affair with Trump, and about Trump\u2019s anger when the story went public in 2016 and 2018. Daniels, the adult film star who allegedly had an affair with Trump (he continues to deny it), testified about her encounter with him at a golf tournament in 2006, often in explicit detail. Defense attorneys accused Daniels of fabricating the story to make money. Cohen walked jurors through how he worked with Pecker on Trump\u2019s behalf and testified that Trump was aware and approved of how Cohen would be falsely repaid for the 2016 payment to Daniels of $130,000 as legal services. Cohen\u2019s credibility as a convicted felon and perjurer was key during closing arguments, where Trump\u2019s lawyers said Cohen couldn\u2019t be trusted while prosecutors said jurors should use his testimony as part of the larger theme along with the physical evidence. The judge also explicitly told jurors that Trump could not be convicted based solely on Cohen\u2019s testimony. Trump did not testify. The judge instructed the jury that Trump\u2019s decision must not be used as a factor in their deliberations. The gag order Early on, Judge Juan Merchan put Trump under a gag order, later expanding it and fining the defendant a total of $10,000 for various violations. After he was barred from making statements about witnesses, jurors, prosecutors, court staff and the family members of prosecutors and court staff, Trump launched a series of posts on his social media platform. The gag order did not cover remarks about District Attorney Alvin Bragg or the judge or his family, but it was later modified to include family members. Trump railed against the gag order every day during the trial and again on May 31 when he spoke at Trump Tower the day after the verdict. It remains in effect. Sentencing and appeal The 34 charges against the former president are Class E felonies, the lowest level in New York law. As a first-time offender, Trump is unlikely to face any prison time. However, that\u2019s up to Merchan, who will sentence Trump on July 11. Trump, however, has said he will appeal. The typical appeals process for a convicted defendant in New York state can take almost a year or more, but a defendant can\u2019t appeal until after sentencing. After that, Trump will have 30 days to file a notice of appeal. His team would then typically have six months to complete procedural requirements\u00a0such as filing their appellate argument as well as filing other relevant documents like the trial transcripts. After more filings from each side, a five-judge panel for the Appellate Division First Department would then hear oral arguments from both sides and issue a written decision, which could take months.\u00a0The panel is not subject to a deadline. Trump could also go up to the Court of Appeals, New York\u2019s highest court. At the same time, Trump could\u00a0ask Merchan to stay his sentence until after his appeal is over. And if Merchan rejects that request, Trump could ask the appeals court for a stay of his sentence while he appeals. The big question: Can Trump win the White House? The legal answer is that yes, he is absolutely eligible to run. Trump meets the basic constitutional criteria. He\u2019s a natural-born citizen of over 35 years old and has lived in the US for at least 14 years. The political answer is that we\u2019ll have to wait and see. Trump\u2019s campaign claimed it raised almost $53 million in the 24 hours following the verdict (those numbers must be confirmed in FEC filings), and Republicans from up and down the political spectrum came out in support of the GOP\u2019s likely nominee. What about his other cases? Trump is still facing 54 charges in three other cases, but he has been successful in putting those cases on ice with a never-ending barrage of legal filings and appeals. No other trial dates are pending. The federal election subversion criminal case in Washington, DC, has been on hold while the\u00a0US\u00a0Supreme Court considers Trump\u2019s claims of presidential immunity. The judge overseeing his classified documents case in Florida has indefinitely postponed the trial and continues to schedule hearings on various legal issues. And the Georgia election interference case is in legal limbo while Trump and several of his co-defendants try to disqualify the Atlanta-area prosecutor who brought the charges. What else? Can Trump buy guns? Travel? A flood of questions came in this week from CNN readers asking about everything from Trump\u2019s eligibility to vote, his ability to travel abroad or his right to buy firearms. CNN\u2019s\u00a0Zachary B. Wolf\u00a0and\u00a0Devan Cole answered them all here. CNN\u2019s Kara Scannell, Lauren del Valle, Jeremy Herb, Zachary B.

{"id": "2024_06_01_us_pickup-basketball-america-essay-cec", "text": "About 20 years ago, I was a young man with a new job in an unfamiliar city. Some nights, turning off the lights in my one-bedroom apartment, I felt the crushing weight of loneliness. I even said the phrase out loud a few times. The crushing weight of loneliness. No one was there to tell me I was being weird. In my temporary home of Jacksonville, Florida, I drove along the riverside and past the moss-draped oaks, looking for a game of pickup basketball the way someone might look for an old friend. The details would be familiar and comforting. The faint musical note of the ball on the concrete. The thud of the backboard and the snap of the net. I\u2019d moved a few times before, and I\u2019d found the same thing in every new place. It doesn\u2019t matter where you are in America. Somewhere nearby is a gym or an outdoor court, and usually someone wants to play. Near a bend in the St. Johns River, I found a gym with several full courts and a lively pickup game. I took a few warmup shots and called next. Something fascinating happens in your first game of basketball on a new court. Let\u2019s call it an acceleration. You start running with nine total strangers and get to know them very quickly. Human nature reveals itself through action. There is selfishness (when a guy shoots too much), laziness (when a guy won\u2019t get back on defense), and occasional dishonesty (when a guy repeatedly calls out the wrong score in his own team\u2019s favor). In rare cases, you even see brutality. One time a guy punched me behind the ear when I disrespected his friend, and the game continued as I lay stunned on the floor near the foul line. But when it\u2019s good, and it usually is, there is something wonderful and irreplaceable about pickup basketball. Maybe you get smoked on a crossover and your teammate saves you by blocking the layup. Maybe you set a pick for him and then roll to the hoop, and he floats a gentle pass over the defender into your waiting arms. Maybe you get a rebound and see your teammate breaking free down the court, and you whip it ahead for the game-winning bucket. There is poetry and music in this game, and once in a while you feel a particular kind of love. This doesn\u2019t necessarily mean you\u2019ll be friends for life. After a really good play, you can feel this way about a teammate when you don\u2019t even know his name. On the court, it doesn\u2019t matter what race or class or age you are I kept going back to that gym near the riverbend. Sometimes I was the only white guy in there. It was no big deal. If someone called me \u201cGinobili,\u201d after another reckless lefty two-guard who happened to be white, I took it as a compliment \u2014 especially since I\u2019d tried and failed to make two different college teams. Racial dynamics can be complicated, of course, but in pickup they can also be simple. You hit an open jumper and you\u2019ll probably get the ball again. Miss it, and you\u2019d better go crash the boards and earn some trust. More often than not, pickup ball is a meritocracy. This one young woman was there pretty often. Her name was Ruthie. She had a smooth crossover and a quality step-back. Ruthie didn\u2019t just like playing with the guys. She liked embarrassing them. \u201cYou\u2019re garbage,\u201d she would tell her victims. I quickly learned it was smarter to play with Ruthie than against her. A new routine developed. I\u2019d finish work and drive across the river to the gym and play for a couple of hours and get home so hungry that I could eat most of a box of pasta and a jar of red sauce with a sleeve of Jimmy Dean Italian sausage mixed in. Sometimes I played four or five times a week. Eventually I recruited some of my coworkers from the newspaper to play there with me. We joined a rec league. I designed our T-shirts. In a nod to a big hit from Jacksonville\u2019s biggest rock band, we were the Freebirds. I think we won a game or two, but one time we lost so badly that I still remember the score. It was 98 to 25. One night in that gym, I met a guy known as Corey From Up North Who Fouls. Corey did not endorse this nickname. I\u2019m not even sure he knew about it; I only heard it from my buddy at the front desk who used it when Corey wasn\u2019t there. But in my experience, it was accurate enough. Corey did foul, often and hard, and this one game he fouled me quite a lot. My temper was rising. It felt like the night could take a bad turn. Among hundreds or thousands of pickup games over the last three decades, the game with Corey stands out in my memory. I\u2019ll tell you the ending in a minute. But first I want to talk about right now. I can\u2019t hang on the rim like I used to, and my first step isn\u2019t so quick. I\u2019m 43, married to a woman with great post moves who once helped me and my friend Eric beat a few teams in a 3-on-3 tournament. We have four kids. I have an old back injury that sometimes keeps me on the sidelines. But I still play pickup ball whenever I can, and recently I\u2019ve been thinking about what it means for America in 2024. In a time when too many people are isolated, pickup ball gets you out of the house and rewards you for talking with strangers. In a time when men need more friends, pickup ball encourages you to make eye contact. That\u2019s how the point guard knows you\u2019re about to make a backdoor cut. In a time when everything is too expensive, a pickup game at the playground is free. All you need is a pair of sneakers. Even those are negotiable. At the outdoor court the other day, a big tall guy joined our game. He was wearing Crocs, and somehow he didn\u2019t break his ankles. In a time when we\u2019re divided by race and class and age, pickup ball cuts across those lines. You might share the court with a 50-year-old college professor, or a 30-year-old air-conditioning repairman, or a 19-year-old high-school dropout. Last year I played against a gray-haired man who hit a game-winner for the other team. I asked how old he was. He said he was 74. In a time when the facts are so disputed that people seem to be living in parallel universes, pickup ball forces us to inhabit one shared reality. A basket is worth one point. Outside the arc, it\u2019s two. Call your own fouls, and respect what others call. Winners stay. To get back on, you call next or shoot for it. The same rules apply to everyone. Maybe this country would be a better place if it worked a little more like a pickup game. I\u2019m a different person now. And a different basketball player I was once an angry young man on the basketball court. I wanted to prove the big kids wrong for looking down on me when I was a little 14-year-old. I wanted to prove those college coaches wrong, too. I was like Ruthie. I wanted to embarrass the people who underestimated me, and that\u2019s part of the reason two guys have punched me during games and many others have likely been sorely tempted. I left the game for a few years, when my kids were first born, and when I came back I was a different man. A little slower, and a little wiser. I still play hard, but now I\u2019m just glad to be out there. \u201cGo easy on me,\u201d I\u2019ll tell my opponent before the game starts, and usually he can\u2019t help but smile. It lowers the tension. Afterwards I sometimes tell guys from the other team what I like about their game. They are often surprised, and disarmed. All that to say I\u2019m not mad at Corey From Up North Who Fouls. If there was something in my demeanor that set him off, he wouldn\u2019t have been the first who felt that way. We all have something we\u2019re working out, and most of us have said and done things on the court that we regret. I certainly have. When I think back now on that night at the gym by the riverbend in Jacksonville, I\u2019m grateful to Corey for giving me this one moment. I realized something that night. After playing there several days a week for the last few months, I was no longer a stranger. That room was full of my former teammates. We\u2019d set picks for each other, found each other open in the corner, executed the 2-on-1 fast break. And as Corey bullied me up and down the court, I could sense that popular opinion was not on his side. The gym was crowded. Quite a few people were watching our game. I was getting rattled, not playing very well. But near the end, I launched a three past Corey\u2019s outstretched fingertips. When that ball went through the net, a whole bunch of people cheered. And the loneliness didn\u2019t feel like such a crushing weight.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/01/us/pickup-basketball-america-essay-cec/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/02/2024", "section": "us"}}

{"id": "2024_06_01_us_bald-eagles-nick-nora-texas", "text": "The squawking cries from a pair of bald eagles pierce the treetops of an urban jungle on the edge of a popular lake in Dallas. The beloved eagles are perched 75 feet high over their nest, damaged by a violent storm system that ripped through North Texas on Tuesday. Inside the nest were the bald eagle\u2019s two 9-week-old eaglets, thrown from their sanctuary by hurricane-strength winds. The mother and father have spent the days since the storm circling and searching for their offspring on the ground below. The scene has been heartbreaking to watch for Chris Giblin, an amateur photographer who has spent three years documenting the eagles. \u201cIt hurts,\u201d said Giblin. \u201cIt hurts to see them hurting. Nothing is promised when these storms come through.\u201d This bald eagle family has developed a legion of followers and admirers since they made this spot around White Rock Lake in East Dallas their home nearly three years ago. They came to be known as \u201cNick\u201d and \u201cNora\u201d after the husband-and-wife detective characters in the 1930s film \u201cThe Thin Man.\u201d Their every move has been documented in neighborhood Facebook groups and by a devoted and highly protective contingent of photographers. The eagles have so intensely captured the imagination of the neighbors below them that residents speak of these raptors in mystical terms and their presence as \u201cdivine intervention.\u201d The eagle\u2019s nest sits in a sycamore tree at the end of Krista de la Harpe\u2019s street. She describes the relationship between the birds and the neighborhood as a \u201cthree-year love story.\u201d As the storm hit the city, she could only think about the eagles and their babies surviving the fierce winds and falling trees. \u201cI was in my closet all through the storm, just praying for them,\u201d de la Harpe said as she watched the eagles sitting in the trees this week. \u201cIt\u2019s so heartbreaking.\u201d \u2018I found one\u2019 After the storm passed, neighbors raced out to check on the nest and the eagles. Water was rushing over the banks of the creek below the nest. The fierce winds toppled a mix of large oak, cedar and American elm trees, and the eaglets were nowhere to be seen. Brett Johnson, an urban biologist and conservation manager for the City of Dallas, raced to the park after the storm. He saw half the nest was gone and that the two eaglets were missing. Later that morning, Bryna Thomson searched the creek area with neighbors when she heard her friend shouting, \u201cI found one. I found one. I found one.\u201d The video she captured shows an eaglet shivering and soaked in rain but seemingly not severely injured, even eating a fish it had caught in the floodwaters. \u201cThey were healthy babies,\u201d Thomson said. The neighbor called in to report what they had found. Johnson says he collaborated with state game wardens and US Fish and Wildlife Services to get permission to handle the federally protected bird and move it to a rehabilitation facility that specializes in treating bald eagles. The facility did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for an interview. The eaglet did not suffer any serious injuries, but the rehab specialists say it could take a week for the bird to regain its strength, Johnson said Friday. \u201cIt was definitely stunned,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cI am very hopeful, fairly confident, it\u2019s going to be rehabbed.\u201d The city\u2019s conservation team and biologists are working to develop a reintroduction plan to bring the young bird back to its nesting area and possibly reunite with its parents, Johnson says. If the eaglet successfully recovers, it\u2019s still not clear how the bird will be returned to its parents and its home environment. The second eaglet has not been seen since the Tuesday morning storm. Neighbors fear the worst. It might have been swept away in the floodwaters that have surged through the creek for days. Downed trees have also made it impossible for searchers to safely access the spots where the eaglet might have fallen. The area is also home to bald eagle predators like coyotes and bobcats. Scott Meril, a retired medical doctor, came to the nesting area to capture photographs of the mourning eagle parents. The images show one of the eagles squawking into the sky with its head tilted back in a pose that seemed to capture the bird\u2019s desperation. Meril said he was struck by the eagle\u2019s majestic and powerful stare as they scanned the urban landscape looking for the eaglets. \u201cTo see them in Texas, it\u2019s wild,\u201d Meril said. \u2018You can\u2019t fight this stupid Texas weather\u2019 This isn\u2019t the first time tragedy has struck Nick and Nora\u2019s quest to bring a successful clutch of eggs into the world. In February 2022, the mating bald eagles built a nest in the same area near White Rock Lake. Residents came from across the city to catch a glimpse of the new stars of the neighborhood, waiting for the babies to hatch. But a severe storm with fierce winds ripped the nest and the tree branches apart. The eggs fell to the ground. \u201cThey have been through a lot,\u201d said Johnson. In 2023, Nick and Nora built a second nest around White Rock Lake but abandoned it and never laid eggs.Johnson says the nest was built in an area that was probably too close to the crowds of people who use the lake for recreation. This year, residents thought the eagles had finally succeeded. The eaglets were just a week or two away from being able to fly on their own. At that point, Nick and Nora would teach them how to hunt for their own food. The day before the storm Giblin captured stunning images of the small birds \u201cbranching\u201d out of their nests \u2013 the first attempts to jump from their nests onto nearby tree branches. The cycle of natural life seemed so close to becoming complete, but again nature intervened in a tragic way. \u201cThey just can\u2019t catch a break,\u201d Thomson said. \u201cThey were good parents, and it\u2019s just that you can\u2019t fight this stupid Texas weather.\u201d Yellowstone comes to Dallas While bald eagles can often be found near large cities, it remains rare for eagles to nest and mate in busy urban areas. This is why Giblin and a group of photographers have spent countless hours documenting the couple. Giblin, who works for a merchandising company, estimates he has snapped more than 20,000 pictures of the eagles since they started appearing regularly here three years ago. He\u2019s so dedicated, he once spent 7 hours waiting to capture a single shot of the eagles flying from their nest. He equates the bald eagles\u2019 presence in Dallas to having Yellowstone National Park in the city \u201cIn this metropolis, they chose to nest right here. It\u2019s absolutely crazy,\u201d Giblin said.\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m down here every weekend. I don\u2019t take it for granted.\u201d Thomson, a middle school science teacher, says the bald eagles have brought her neighborhood closer together. She often sets up a spotting scope connected to an iPad, which she calls \u201cEagle TV,\u201d so children can watch the eagles up-close. \u201cThey\u2019re the coolest birds ever,\u201d Thomson said. \u201cI\u2019m not really a bird person, but apparently I am. Because I sure do like the bald eagle.\u201d These Dallas eagle lovers worry years of disappointment might convince Nick and Nora to abandon their lives around their neighborhood lake and look to build a nest elsewhere. The majestic birds don\u2019t realize they\u2019re the main characters in a love story their neighbors don\u2019t want to end.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/01/us/bald-eagles-nick-nora-texas/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/02/2024", "section": "us"}}

The calls for retribution began immediately after the verdict was announced. Experts who track online extremism told CNN the volume of violent rhetoric in the last 24 hours is\u00a0as high as it was after the FBI\u2019s search\u00a0of Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago property in August 2022. \u201cHope these jurors face some street justice,\u201d one anonymous user on a pro-Trump forum wrote. Another suggestively asked, \u201cWouldn\u2019t [it] be interesting if just one person from Trump\u2019s legal team anonymously leaked the names of the jurors?\u201d Anonymity is supposed to add a layer of protection for jurors doing their civic duty. Once reserved only for cases involving violent criminal enterprises, the practice is becoming more common. The judge in the Trump New York trial\u00a0issued an order in March\u00a0agreeing with prosecutors that most information about the jurors would be sealed. Trump\u2019s lawyers did not disagree, according to the order. Overnight, however, anonymous internet users on sites that are known havens of hate and harassment began\u00a0sharing names, home addresses and other personal information belonging to people they say might have been members of the jury,\u00a0a practice known as doxxing. This form of amateur online sleuthing can lead to real-life security issues. For example, a commonly used tactic called \u201cswatting\u201d involves a caller making a bogus crime report intended to trigger a massive law enforcement response to a target\u2019s residence. In the past, people whose personal information have been shared online in this way have been misidentified and sometimes have nothing at all to do with the issue at hand. \u201cUnfortunately, social media has given rise to a whole generation of amateur sleuthing that lacks journalism standards and ethics, leading to countless examples of mistaken identities and wrongful accusations,\u201d Ben Decker, the CEO of Memetica, a threat analysis company, told CNN Friday. \u201cWhile the sleuthers themselves face few, if any, consequences, the victims of these accusations become the targets of violent threats both on and offline,\u201d he added. Violent rhetoric targeting other people involved in the case, including the presiding judge, the district attorney and journalists who reported on the case, was identified by researchers at Advance Democracy, a nonprofit organization that conducts public-interest research, the group\u2019s president, Daniel Jones, told CNN Friday. Last summer, purported names, photographs and home addresses of grand jurors in Fulton County, Georgia, circulated on the far-right internet after the grand jury voted to indict Trump. Similarly, after the FBI search of Mar-a-Lago in 2022, a Florida court removed information, including the office address, of a federal magistrate judge from its website, after internet users began targeting the judge, claiming the judge had signed off on the search warrant. The volume of violent online rhetoric seen on anti-government and extremists forums in the 24 hours since Trump\u2019s conviction is as high as it was in the wake of the FBI\u2019s\u00a0search\u00a0of Mar-a-Lago property in August 2022, according to John Cohen, former acting undersecretary for intelligence and analysis at the Department of Homeland Security. The Institute for Strategic Dialogue (ISD), a nonprofit that tracks extremism, released data Friday showing that about 9,300 online postings mentioned civil unrest within a day of the Trump conviction, compared to 9,900 unrest-related posts after the Mar-a-Lago search. In September 2019, after House Democrats announced Trump\u2019s first impeachment inquiry and Trump quoted a pastor on Twitter warning of a \u201cCivil War-like fracture\u201d in the country if Trump was removed from office, unrest-related online posts numbered nearly 20,000, according to ISD. \u201c[F]alse and misleading narratives surrounding the verdict [have] the potential to serve as a catalyst for individual acts of violence and other illegal activity, while also continuing to increase distrust in our democratic institutions,\u201d ISD analysts wrote. Days after the FBI searched Mar-a-Lago in August 2022, an armed man who had directed increasingly violent online rhetoric at the FBI\u00a0tried to breach\u00a0the bureau\u2019s Cincinnati office and was killed in an armed standoff with FBI agents. Some of the violent language in the last 24 hours is \u201ca direct illustration of what concerns law enforcement as we get closer and closer to the election,\u201d Cohen said, calling it \u201ca harbinger of what\u2019s to come.\u201d Foreign intelligence services and terrorist groups will likely try to amplify the online vitriol in the coming days and weeks, he added.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/31/tech/threats-doxxing-trump-jurors/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/02/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_01_success_buying-house-in-retirement-mortgage", "text": "Moving somewhere new when you retire isn\u2019t uncommon. But deciding whether to take out a new mortgage to buy a home is a big deal. Much of your financial life is changing as you transition from a steady paycheck to a mix of fixed and variable income and a new lifestyle. So adding a large debt to the picture isn\u2019t an easy call. That\u2019s especially true now that mortgage rates hover around 7% and home prices keep rising. \u201cAny time you take on debt, you increase risk in your situation,\u201d said Illinois-based certified financial planner Jim Stork. More than a third (35%) of homebuyers last year were between the ages of 59 and 98, according to data from the National Association of Realtors. Within that group, a majority financed their purchases. Whether taking out a new mortgage makes sense for you depends on a lot of factors, including how to prove to a lender that you\u2019re a good credit risk, plus your feelings about the debt and the ongoing cost of maintaining a home. To get a mortgage, your age won\u2019t be a factor, but your income will be If you\u2019re concerned that you may be less attractive to a mortgage banker because you\u2019ve hit retirement age, know that it is illegal to discriminate against anyone applying for a mortgage based on their age. Lenders\u2019 chief focus will be on your ability to repay your mortgage with your various sources of non-paycheck income. \u201cWhen you qualify for a mortgage, it\u2019s all based on your income,\u201d said Melissa Cohn, regional vice president at William Raveis Mortgage. That, and of course any debt you have that will soak up your income, but we\u2019ll get to that in a minute. The income sources that lenders consider, absent a regular paycheck, include: Social Security benefits, pension or annuity income, spousal benefits, disability payments, interest and dividends and your 401(k) or IRA. If a portion of your income is not subject to tax, the lender may treat it as worth 25% more. Fannie Mae offers this example: Say 15% of a $1,500 monthly Social Security benefit is tax free. That means $225 of it will not be subject to tax ($1,500 x 15%). And 25% of that amount comes to $56 ($225 x 25%). So that $56 can be added to a person\u2019s qualifying Social Security income amount ($1,500 + $56 = $1,556). If you want to use your nest egg, different methods can be used to calculate how much income it would provide. There is the asset depletion method in which your eligible assets are divided by your loan term. In the case of a 30-year mortgage, that would be 360 months. If your IRA is worth $700,000, that translates into $1,944 per month ($700,000/360). \u201cYou don\u2019t ever have to take the money out \u2014 but you can use your assets [to qualify for a mortgage] as if you were going to take the distribution,\u201d Cohn said. Another option: If you are at least 59-1/2, you can start taking monthly distributions from an IRA without penalty \u2014 or a 401(k) if your plan rules permit \u2014 and the lender will count that as income so long as you show that you have sufficient funds in the account to keep taking that same monthly distribution for three years. Once you close on your home, Cohn said, you can reduce or stop taking distributions if you choose. That assumes you are not yet in your 70s when the IRS requires you to start taking minimum distributions, said Mark Luscombe, a principal analyst at Wolters, Kluwer Tax & Accounting. Burdened by debt? Lenders will also assess your debt-to-income ratio, because no matter how much income you have, the big question is how much of it will be consumed by your debts. The debt portion is composed of your expected mortgage payment plus any credit card, student loan, car loan or other outstanding debt you may have. Generally speaking, for conventional loans your DTI ratio can be up to 50%, Cohen said. That ratio falls to between 43% and 45% if you\u2019re taking out a jumbo loan, she added. A jumbo loan exceeds the conforming loan limits in the area you want to buy. But ideally your debt level will fall well below these top limits, both for the lender\u2019s sake and yours. And, of course, the higher your credit score, the better the interest rate you can get on a mortgage. What you should consider before taking out a mortgage Even before seeking a mortgage, get a good grasp on your expected monthly income and expenses in retirement. Compared to pre-retirement earnings, \u201cMost (new retirees) see a decrease in income,\u201d said certified financial planner Lori Trawinski, director of finance and employment at AARP. While some expenses may also decline \u2014 e.g., work-related costs like commuting \u2014 others may increase over time, Trawinski said, like medical costs, property taxes, home insurance and utilities. Of course, you can downsize and move to a lower-cost area. But if you stay near where you lived during your career, your expenses are likely to rise over time. Also, Trawinski noted, if you\u2019re married, consider what will happen to your household income when one spouse dies. This will help you assess your future comfort level in carrying a mortgage. \u201cPeople often fail to plan for the death of a spouse. You can take a big hit to your income when that happens,\u201d she said. If you do move to a new state or region, weigh renting first. You can get a better sense of the cost of living in the area and decide whether it\u2019s a good fit for you. As Stork put it, \u201cFlorida in August is not as fun as Florida in January.\u201d How much are you really willing to take on? All the usual financial decisions that go into homebuying apply no matter your age. But, in retirement especially, you don\u2019t want to take on more debt than necessary, since the cost of a mortgage is fixed, but the returns on your investments, the housing market and your health needs are variable. At the very least, Stork said, consider whether you can put enough money down \u2014 at least 20% \u2014 to avoid having to pay private mortgage insurance. Beyond that, consider whether you feel comfortable keeping up \u2014 and paying for \u2014 maintenance on a home. Maintenance might amount to 2% a year of your home\u2019s value, Stork said. That amounts to $10,000 a year on a $500,000 home. Maintenance is essential in preserving the value of your house should you ever decide to sell. How would your mortgage interest rate compare to a reasonable rate of return on your investments? The decision to get a mortgage was a lot easier for retirees when rates were historically low \u2014 roughly 3% \u2014 and their nest eggs were earning a lot more. \u201cBut at today\u2019s rates it\u2019s a much harder calculation,\u201d Stork said. This is especially the case if you\u2019re a very conservative investor. \u201cIf your CDs are earning 4% and a mortgage would cost you 7%, you will lose money every day on that decision,\u201d Stork explained. To get the truest reading on what makes financial sense, compare mortgage expenses to your investment returns on an after-tax basis, Stork noted.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/01/success/buying-house-in-retirement-mortgage/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/02/2024", "section": "us"}}
