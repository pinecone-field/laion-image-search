{"id": "2024_06_30_us_gay-military-law-biden-pardon", "text": "The predawn silence was shattered by heavy banging on the doors of the US Army barracks in West Germany that morning in May 1988. Mona McGuire and Karla Lehmann were handcuffed, pulled from their barracks, interrogated for hours and eventually kicked out of the Army for admitting to charges of sodomy and an indecent act to avoid a court martial and prison. \u201cI wasn\u2019t going to prison at 19, 20 years old for loving another human being, for loving another female,\u201d McGuire told CNN. In the decades since, McGuire said, she has led \u201can honorable life\u201d while overcoming her emotional scars. She lives\u00a0in a\u00a0Milwaukee\u00a0suburb with her\u00a0two sons\u00a0and\u00a0her wife. She\u00a0has worked at a printing company for the last 35 years. \u201cI was able to recover and strong enough to carry on,\u201d she said. Lehmann retired in 2016 from the Milwaukee Police Department after 26 years on the job and is now a victim advocate for the Michigan State Police. She and McGuire remain friends. \u201cHere I\u2019m sitting with this charge of sodomy and indecent acts on my federal record with the military. But I ended up going to the sensitive crimes division and investigating sexual assaults for half my career,\u201d she told CNN. \u201cI ended up becoming a mentor and a teacher and I taught all over the states on how to conduct those investigations and how to interview people \u2013 which is kind of ironic because my interrogation with the military was brutal.\u201d Now, after President Joe Biden pardoned American veterans who were convicted under a military law that banned gay sex for more than 60 years, McGuire and Lehmann have been left wondering whether the announcement will affect service members, like them, who accepted less than honorable discharges rather than face court martial \u2013 a lasting stain on their military records. Biden, in a statement on Wednesday, said he was \u201crighting an historic wrong\u201d by pardoning service members \u201cwho were convicted simply for being themselves.\u201d \u201cIt just leaves this void and this question mark of, \u2018What\u2019s going to happen for us?\u2019\u201d Lehmann said of the proclamation. Many vets accepted bad discharges to avoid court martial Biden\u2019s proclamation\u00a0will affect roughly 2,000 people, according to a US official.\u00a0The pardon won\u2019t automatically change the record of convicted veterans, but it will allow them to apply for a certificate that will help them receive withheld benefits. \u201cOur nation\u2019s service members stand on the frontlines of freedom, and risk their lives in order to defend our country. Despite their courage and great sacrifice, thousands of LGBTQI+ service members were forced out of the military because of their sexual orientation or gender identity,\u201d Biden said. \u201cThis is about dignity, decency, and ensuring the culture of our Armed Forces reflect the values that make us an exceptional nation.\u201d The pardon specifically grants clemency to service members who were convicted under former Uniform Code of Military Justice Article 125 \u2014\u202f which criminalized sodomy, including between consenting adults\u00a0\u2014\u202fbetween\u00a01951 and 2013 when it was rewritten by Congress. It also applies to those who were convicted of attempting to commit those offenses. A senior administration official told reporters they\u00a0are also\u00a0working to address cases in which LGBTQ+ service members were convicted under other UCMJ charges than Article 125, such as conduct unbecoming an officer. The official said individuals who may have been convicted of other charges \u201cbased on their sexual orientation or gender identity\u201d can go through the normal pardon process at the Department of Justice. What the proclamation means for McGuire and Lehmann is unclear at the moment, but their stories reflect the plight of veterans unfairly targeted for their sexual orientation. \u201cRight now, even with the pardon, the burden of proof and the burden to reach out and go through this process is completely on the veteran and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s fair,\u201d said Christie Bhageloe,\u00a0a pro bono attorney and director of The Veterans Consortium\u2019s discharge upgrade program. \u201cI hold out hope that the White House will work with the Department of Defense and then just make this an automatic or easy process, rather than making veterans jump through more hoops,\u201d said Bhageloe, who is representing McGuire and Lehmann. \u201cI think it\u2019s a step in the right direction just stating out for the world to hear that these veterans did not do anything wrong and they should have that stain from their records removed but, practically, they need to make it easier.\u201d McGuire and Lehmann are among the thousands of service members forced out of the military because of their sexual orientation between the 1950s and 2011, when a law known as \u201cDon\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell\u201d was repealed by Congress. Lt. Col. Ruth Castro, an Army spokesperson, said privacy laws prevented her from commenting on individual cases. And she referred CNN to a new Defense Department website about the pardon application process.  A service member\u2019s discharge status can determine what Veterans Affairs benefits they are eligible for. A bad-conduct discharge, for example, given under general court martial, can make someone\u202fineligible\u202ffor services including a VA home loan, military pension and education benefits. The pardon is separate from the Pentagon\u2019s ongoing review of military records for those who were discharged based on their sexual orientation \u2013 which another US official said did not apply to convictions under the UCMJ. The Pentagon launched a new outreach campaign last September to reach more veterans who believe they \u201csuffered an error or injustice\u201d to have their military records reviewed. To get their records changed under the pardon, veterans will need to complete an online application, which will go to their military service department. The department will review the individual\u2019s court martial and service record and determine if they are eligible for the pardon. That determination will then be sent to the attorney general,\u00a0acting through the Department of Justice\u2019s pardon attorney, a US official explained. The certificate of pardon does not automatically change the discharge status. With a certificate of pardon, the service member will then have to apply to their respective military department\u2019s board of corrections to have their military records corrected. Bhageloe said more clarity is needed on the pardons because the majority of veterans discharged before and during \u201cDon\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell\u201d were not \u201cconvicted\u201d but instead accepted a bad discharge to avoid a court martial and possibly prison. \u2018Embarrassing, humiliating, devastating\u2019 McGuire and Lehmann were stationed with the 164th Military Police Company in West Germany when Army investigators burst into the barracks. They were handcuffed and driven to another base, where they said they were fingerprinted, had mugshots taken and were interrogated separately. After seven or eight hours of what they described as humiliating and offensive questions about their private lives, McGuire and Lehmann said they were forced to confess and accept a discharge \u201cfor the good of the service \u2013 in lieu of trial by court-martial.\u201d \u201cThat decision was forced upon us during that seven- to eight-hour interrogation,\u201d said McGuire, who was following in the footsteps of her father, a military police officer during World War II. He died when she was 7. \u201cI remember hyperventilating, being you know, upset, crying so much that I just couldn\u2019t breathe at that point. My world was crushed. My dream was definitely crushed. My career was crushed. It was embarrassing, humiliating, devastating.\u201d McGuire eventually returned home to Mineola, Texas. Lehmann went home to Wisconsin. \u201cI\u2019m coming home to a new me, a newfound, you know, part of myself that I don\u2019t know very well, and I\u2019m outed and I\u2019m ashamed,\u201d said Lehmann, whose grandfather was a World War II veteran.  \u201cI\u2019m embarrassed that I got discharged. I don\u2019t know what it means for my future as a police officer. And it was just really, really challenging to navigate telling family and friends\u2026 I avoided people. I did not want to share my story.\u201d Apologies for \u2018ruining your military career\u2019 In January 2018, McGuire and Lehmann finally learned who had outed them. Lehmann had received a copy of a Facebook message that a woman who had been stationed with them originally sent to another soldier. Lehmann immediately texted a copy to McGuire. \u201cI just wanted to say how sorry I am!!! I had a pretty sheltered life growing up. I was never around (people) of a different race or around gays or lesbians,\u201d the message read. \u201cI was a terrible friend to you \u2026 I\u2019ve always wanted to find you guys and apologize for ruining your military career.\u201d The woman wrote that her own military career ended not long after McGuire and Lehmann were kicked out of the Army. \u201cSorry to say I\u2019m not 100% lesbian. But I am bi. I miss you\u2026 Again I am so very sorry and hope you will forgive me,\u201d she wrote in the message, which mentioned McGuire and Lehmann by name. In 2022, McGuire filled out the paperwork in a bid to upgrade her discharge, which she described as \u201cthe most traumatic event in her life,\u201d according to a record of the proceeding with the Army Board for Correction of Military Records. She wrote about her love for the country and the \u201chumiliation\u201d she has felt. She described \u201cfeeling worthless and alone\u201d and falling into a deep depression that for a time stripped away her self-confidence. \u201cTo date, she has dreams of being in the Army, dreaming she re-enlisted and was allowed to serve her country,\u201d the document said. \u201cShe awakes and realizes it was a dream and the overwhelming sadness is again felt.\u201d McGuire received a response from the Department of the Army in a letter dated August 2, 2023: \u201cI regret to inform you that the Army Board for Correction of Military Records denied your application.\u201d The denial letter said the board concluded in part there was \u201cinsufficient evidence to support the applicant had condition or experience that mitigated her misconduct.\u201d It also cited insufficient evidence that she suffered from depression after her discharge and of her \u201cpost-service honorable conduct.\u201d McGuire, the letter said, admitted guilt to the charges and \u201cvoluntarily requested discharge \u2026 for the good of the service \u2013 in lieu of trial by court-martial.\u201d \u201cAfter the seven to eight hours of brutal, intense interrogation and telling us we\u2019re going to prison, we finally broke down and gave in,\u201d McGuire told CNN. Bhageloe said she is appealing McGuire\u2019s denial for a discharge upgrade and helping prepare Lehmann\u2019s application for an upgrade. \u201cI feel like this is the time. I am hopeful that something positive will come of this,\u201d McGuire said of America\u2019s latest attempt to right what Biden\u2019s proclamation called a \u201chistorical injustice.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/30/us/gay-military-law-biden-pardon/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/01/2024", "section": "us"}}

The Boulder View Fire, which ignited Thursday east of Carefree in Arizona\u2019s most populous county has burned through more than 3,700 acres and was 19% contained as of Sunday, according to an update on InciWeb on Sunday. \u201cContainment increased on the east side of the fire after it reached the Wildcat Fire-burned area and stopped spreading,\u201d according to InciWeb\u2019s Sunday update. The now fully contained Wildcat Fire started in May and scorched more than 14,000 acres.  Crews will continue structure protection efforts on Sunday and focus on \u201cimproving firelines\u201d around the Boulder View Fire, the update stated. In the meantime, fire officials announced they had lifted evacuation status in the affected area, though residents need to remain aware of dangerous conditions according to the state\u2019s \u201cReady, Set, Go!\u201d program. \u201cAreas in GO evacuate status were downgraded to SET while areas in SET status were returned to READY status on Saturday afternoon at 5 p.m.,\u201d the update Sunday said, referring to the three levels of preparedness used to guide residents ahead of and during evacuations. The \u201cReady\u201d status signifies being prepared and aware of hazards, while \u201cset\u201d encourages residents to be alert about significant danger in their area and to consider voluntarily evacuating. \u201cGo\u201d urges people to evacuate from imminent and life-threatening danger, according to the Arizona Emergency Information Network. An evacuation order went into effect Thursday night for residents along the southeast side of the fire, the Arizona Department of Forestry and Fire Management said in\u00a0a social media post. The department said at least 60 homes were evacuated Thursday. About 4.5 million people live in the county. \u201cIt definitely puts a little bit of a panic into your mind right away,\u201d a Scottsdale woman told CNN affiliate KPNX. \u201cWe made a plan. We have had a plan. We have lots of friends in the area that have trucks and trailers ready to go when we are.\u201d The woman, along with another resident, safely evacuated to another property in north Scottsdale where they have mares, pigs, goats and cats. They said watching the \u201corange flames over the north side of the houses\u201d put them \u201con edge\u201d as they watched from safety. The fire is burning as the nation grapples with a summer of more\u00a0extreme heat\u00a0\u2013 the deadliest form of weather globally and one making wildfires more likely and destructive. And with the planet warming due to fossil fuel pollution, the heat will only get\u00a0more frequent\u00a0and intense. \u201cWe\u2019ve evacuated our horses, and we\u2019ll get some more. I\u2019ll do it all night long if I have to,\u201d resident Chris Hull told CNN affiliate KNXV as he was fueling up his truck to haul more livestock. \u201cWhatever it takes.\u201d Fire activity in Maricopa County picked up late Thursday, forcing officials to shift crews to the southeast side of the fire to protect structures. The wildfire is also threatening \u201chigh voltage power lines and the Sonoran Desert,\u201d authorities said via InciWeb. \u201cIt\u2019s burning through grass and brush and has moved off of private land onto the Tonto National Forest,\u201d they said. Nearly 270 personnel have been assigned to the fire, according to Sunday\u2019s InciWeb update. \u201cCrews will especially focus on the southeast part of the fire due to residences at risk and prevailing winds as fire crews on the south and west sides of the fire will improve firelines and begin mop up,\u201d the update read. Chances of thunderstorms could \u201cmake firefighting efforts more complicated due to gusty winds and lightning strikes,\u201d according to the update.

{"id": "2024_06_30_politics_biden-family-camp-david-debate", "text": "Joe Biden\u2019s family on Sunday encouraged the president to stay in the 2024 race and privately discussed whether top aides should be fired on the heels of Biden\u2019s stunningly poor debate performance, which has thrown his campaign into turmoil. Biden\u2019s family,\u00a0including\u00a0first lady Jill Biden,\u00a0son Hunter Biden and\u00a0their\u00a0grandchildren, convened at Camp David for a previously scheduled get-together and implored the president to keep fighting in his bid for reelection, Biden advisers told CNN.\u00a0One adviser described the family members as having offered their \u201cunequivocal support.\u201d The family \u2013 clearly frustrated with the team that prepared President Biden ahead of his\u00a0alarming\u00a0debate\u00a0with former President Donald Trump\u00a0\u2013 discussed whether any of Biden\u2019s top advisers should be fired and whether campaign staffing changes should be made, one adviser said. Biden, however, is known for being loyal to and protective of his close advisers, and does not like to fire aides. As of Sunday, it did not appear that any major staffing changes\u00a0were looming. The admiration and support that Biden\u2019s family showed the president Sunday mirrored\u00a0the\u00a0first lady\u2019s\u00a0effusive public praise for her husband in recent days. The\u00a0family gathering at the presidential retreat came as Biden and his campaign are confronting an avalanche of calls for the president to drop out after Thursday\u2019s CNN presidential debate. The discussions also focused on how members of the Biden clan could help the president and not whether he should reconsider his candidacy, one of the advisers said. Biden is\u00a0eagerly collecting data\u00a0\u2013 anecdotal evidence and public polling \u2013 but is awaiting a broader round of Democratic campaign polling and research this week, advisers said, bracing for expected slippage\u00a0of support across\u00a0battleground states.\u00a0Advisers preemptively blamed tough media coverage for any downfall, rather than Biden\u2019s own performance. The shock of the CNN debate is still settling in for many, with the president and those close to him in the earliest stages of processing the immediate fallout. The family\u2019s view \u2013 that Biden must keep fighting \u2013 could shift in the coming days if the downward spiral continues and if the president becomes convinced that exiting the race would\u00a0avoid\u00a0dragging down Democrats this fall. The opinion of Biden\u2019s family would be crucial in determining his political future \u2013 even more so than the president\u2019s famously insular inner circle of top advisers. Those advisers are now under great scrutiny, with party insiders openly questioning how they allowed the president to take the stage last week to face off against Donald Trump knowing what they must have known. The Biden team had spent nearly a full week hunkered down at Camp David, trying to prepare the president for any scenario that he might confront inside the CNN studio in Atlanta. Biden and his family convened Sunday for a long-planned photo shoot with renowned photographer Annie Leibovitz. Senior advisers had insisted to CNN on Saturday that the gathering was not aimed at discussing whether the president would remain in the race. Angst toward some of Biden\u2019s key staff members has started to spill out into public view. Florida attorney John Morgan,\u00a0one of the Democratic Party\u2019s most\u00a0prolific and prominent\u00a0donors,\u00a0singled out senior adviser Anita Dunn and her husband, Bob Bauer, who is Biden\u2019s personal attorney. \u201cBiden has for too long been fooled by the value of Anita Dunn and her husband. They need to go \u2026 TODAY,\u201d Morgan wrote on X on Sunday. The White House declined to comment on Morgan\u2019s post.

{"id": "2024_06_25_us_las-vegas-shootings", "text": "An overnight manhunt for a gunman sought in the deaths of five people in North Las Vegas ended Tuesday morning after police located him just before he killed himself. Eric Adams, 47, was identified by police as a suspect in two shootings on Monday night, according to a news release from the North Las Vegas Police Department. Five people were killed and a 13-year-old girl was hospitalized in critical condition with a gunshot wound after the shooting spree at two apartments. The shooting started when an argument broke out between the suspect and his ex-girlfriend while he was visiting her apartment, police said Thursday in an updated news release. Around 10 p.m. on Monday, police received reports of a shooting at an apartment complex on Casa Norte Drive, the release said. When they arrived, police located two adult females \u2013 one in her early 40s and another in her late 50s \u2013 with gunshot wounds. They were later pronounced dead by medical personnel, according to police. \u201cThe two got into a domestic-related argument, during which Adams armed himself with a gun and shot two other women in the apartment,\u201d the Thursday news release said. Police later located a third victim, a 13-year-old female, who also had a gunshot wound and remains in critical condition at UMC Trauma Center as of Thursday, police told CNN in an email. Three more victims were with gunshot wounds were found at another apartment in the same complex, police said Thursday \u2013 Adams\u2019 ex-girlfriend\u2019s 24-year-old daughter and her 22-year-old friend, along with a 20-year-old man. All three were pronounced dead at the scene, police said. The 20-year-old victim, who was an upstairs neighbor, heard the commotion and decided to check on the women to see if he could help, police said. Adams then shot him when he arrived at the apartment, police said. At that point, the suspect went upstairs and shot three people who were inside that apartment, including a 59-year-old woman, a 40-year-old woman and the teenage girl, police said. Two other people were inside the apartment but were left unharmed. Police then identified Adams as a suspect and the manhunt began overnight. After the shootings, Adams took his ex-girlfriend hostage and fled the area, police said. At some point in the early hours of Tuesday morning, the ex-girlfriend escaped unharmed and found a nearby Las Vegas Metropolitan Police officer to ask for help. Police searched throughout the night for Adams until around 10 a.m. on Tuesday, when they received a tip that he was at a business on East Lake Mead Boulevard. When police arrived at that area, Adams fled to the backyard of a nearby residence. \u201cOfficers began giving Adams verbal commands to drop the firearm, however, Adams ignored those commands and died by suicide,\u201d the release says. Police are continuing their investigation into the incident. \u201cThe surviving victims and their families are being assisted by the North Las Vegas Police Department, victim advocates and detectives, to help them through this difficult time,\u201d police said Thursday.

Workers across the US automotive industry told CNN that the software blackout, which the company said was caused by a cyberattack, has made it difficult for dealers to track customer interactions, orders and sales, hurting their ability to earn a living. \u201cIt\u2019s going to affect payroll here,\u201d said Bernard Irvin, a salesperson at a Ford dealership in Greenville, South Carolina. \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t I receive my normal pay? I don\u2019t really understand what this is all about.\u201d The workers\u2019 concerns illustrate how a cyberattack,\u00a0even one on something as overlooked as record-keeping and scheduling software, can cripple an entire industry. According to an estimate by Anderson Economic Group, CDK\u2019s system collapse could result in approximately $944 million in direct losses due to business interruptions for affected car dealers if the outage lasts a full three weeks. Piecemeal progress The outage began last Wednesday after two cyber incidents halted the company\u2019s systems, which provide software to nearly 15,000 car dealerships across North America, according to CDK. In a statement on Friday, the company said it was making progress in bringing some dealerships back online. Previously, the company said it did not expect the issue to be entirely resolved until July. \u201cWe have successfully brought two small groups of dealers and one large publicly traded dealer group live on the Dealer Management System (DMS). We are also actively working to bring live additional applications \u2014 including our Customer Relationship Management (CRM) and Service solutions \u2014 and our Customer Care channels,\u201d according to a CDK spokesperson. \u201cWe understand and share the urgency for our customers to get back to business as usual, and we will continue providing updates as more information is available.\u201d Dozens of automotive retail workers expressed concern about how the outage affected their livelihoods. \u201cI work at a major body shop, and it has really hurt us,\u201d one worker wrote to CNN about the outage. \u201cI don\u2019t know how we\u2019re going to get paid.\u201d \u2018It\u2019s going to affect payroll\u2019 At 71, Norm Phillips has worked as a car parts delivery driver at both a Mercedes-Benz dealership and a Honda dealership in New Jersey for more than 21 years. Since CDK\u2019s malfunction, he hadn\u2019t been able to work at all. The dealerships had not been able to see which parts needed to be delivered. \u201cWhen I asked my boss if we were still going to be paid, he didn\u2019t answer the question,\u201d Phillips told CNN on Thursday. \u201cI\u2019ve been home for a week looking for another job.\u201d Even if CDK resolves the issue, Phillips said he feared the possibility of another cyberattack. \u201cI feel like the writing is on the wall. If hackers can get into a system and take my job away, I feel like it\u2019s probably not the right job to do right now,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no security.\u201d Phillips wasn\u2019t alone in expressing his frustration. \u201c15,000 dealerships is an awful lot to have control over when you do the math,\u201d Irvin said of CDK. \u201cIt is ridiculous.\u201d Irvin said he realized something was amiss with the CDK software he relied on to help prospective clients when a couple interested in purchasing a new Ford Bronco Sport came in to his dealership early last week. \u201cI couldn\u2019t do anything I normally can do,\u201d Irvin said. \u201cI was at a complete standstill and was only able to do really basic things.\u201d Without CDK\u2019s recordkeeping system, Irvin also said he believed his dealership cannot keep track of accurate commission payments. \u201cYou have to make sales,\u201d said Irvin. \u201cOtherwise, you go home and you don\u2019t eat.\u201d Even without access to the software, business has carried on, albeit slowly. In the end, Irvin said it took a week to get the couple who bought their Ford Bronco Sport the bill of sale, which proves ownership of their new car. All of the documents had to be written out by hand. And after more than a week at home, Phillips\u2019 boss texted him to return to work on Friday. They planned to track some parts deliveries and check collections manually. \u201cI\u2019m surprised they didn\u2019t come up with the method sooner!\u201d Phillips wrote in an email. \u201cIt will be a new adventure.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/30/cars/cdk-outage-car-dealers/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/01/2024", "section": "us"}}

At the meeting, according to a memo from the association, union representatives raised concerns including \u201cfurloughs out of seniority order, irregularities in pay scale, and work privileges that have been eliminated without notice or rationale.\u201d In addition to wage increases, the union is seeking protections for certain positions and improved benefits such as health care. On Sunday, the union told CNN \u201cthe parties are separated by a first-year economic difference of approximately 7%, less than $8 million.\u201d WestJet has repeatedly condemned the strike, which comes during a long holiday weekend in Canada. The company says the strike will affect about 250,000 travelers\u2019 plans. WestJet said in a statement Friday it has sought \u201cimmediate intervention by the Minister of Labour and the Canada Industrial Relations Board.\u201d The airline says it has had to cancel more than 410 flights between Thursday and Saturday. Data from flight tracker FlightAware shows WestJet on Sunday had canceled at least 343 flights, constituting 77% of its fleet. The airline\u2019s regional subsidiary, WestJet Encore, has canceled at least 80 flights. Airports across Canada are also facing major service suspensions. At Calgary International Airport, 42% of outbound flights and 40% of inbound flights have been canceled. Toronto Pearson, Vancouver and Edmonton international airports are also affected. But in an update to members on Sunday shared with CNN, the union announced the industrial relations board ruled the strike was lawful, as the board continues to mediate negotiations. \u201cAlthough the compulsory arbitration imposed by the Minister of Labour is scheduled to move forward on an expedited basis, the CIRB has held that, until that process is completed, we are entitled to continue our legal strike,\u201d the union said. The industrial relations board has not responded to CNN\u2019s request for comment. The union told CNN it had made its last offer to the airline on Thursday, and since then WestJet has not responded or given any indication of future bargaining dates. The union also detailed a drawn out and unproductive mediation process over the weekend. \u201cAt 1:00 a.m. Eastern on Saturday, June 29, after waiting hours in a virtual breakout room, the mediators returned to inform us that WestJet executives had decided to \u2018call it a night,\u2019\u201d the union said in its update. Both parties and federal mediators are set to continue talks into Sunday.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/30/business/westjet-strike-flight-cancellations-update/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/01/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_27_us_west-virginia-adopted-black-children-slaves-reaj", "text": "Two West Virginia parents are awaiting trial on more than a dozen charges after adopting four Black children and allegedly using them for \u201cforced labor\u201d on their farm, court documents show. Jeanne Whitefeather, 62 and Donald Lantz, 63, who are both White, have been charged with human trafficking of children, civil rights violations, use of a minor child in forced labor and child neglect, according to the 17-count indictment. Madison Tuck, assistant prosecuting attorney for Kanawha County, West Virginia, told CNN Wednesday that the trial is set to begin on September 9. Tuck said the children are \u201call safe\u201d but declined to give further details about their location. Lantz and Whitefeather entered not guilty pleas during a June 11 arraignment. Mark Plants, an attorney representing Whitefeather, told CNN Thursday that his client \u201cabsolutely, emphatically (denies) the allegations.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re talking about two parents who adopted five Black children, has cared for them for the last eight years, and this is going to come out at trial. And we\u2019ll let the jury decide at the end of the day. But we absolutely, emphatically deny the allegations.\u201d Lantz\u2019s attorney did not immediately return requests for comment. During the arraignment, Thirteenth Judicial Circuit Judge Maryclaire Akers said, \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen an indictment like this in all of my time.\u201d Akers, referencing the indictment, said it alleges the children were \u201ctargeted because of their race\u201d to be used \u201cas basically slaves.\u201d CNN has obtained court documents related to the case, which began in October 2023 when Kanawha County Sheriff\u2019s deputies responded to a 911 call raising concerns about the children. CNN requested a copy of the 911 call, but authorities declined to release it.  The 911 caller reported the children were \u201cmade to do farm work\u201d and \u201cnot allowed inside the house,\u201d according to a sworn statement from the deputy who responded to the call. A news release from the sheriff\u2019s office noted that \u201cdeputies had to force entry into the barn where they located a juvenile male and juvenile female locked inside an approximate 20x14 foot room.\u201d \u201cThe children had no means to exit the barn on their own, no running water, no bathroom facilities, and were obviously deprived of adequate hygienic care and food,\u201d the release said. According to the deputy\u2019s sworn statement, \u201cthe female juvenile also stated she and her 14-year-old brother were not allowed inside the house.\u201d \u201cThere were no accessible windows in the room or way for the children to exit. If there were a medical emergency or fire, the children would be unable to exit the locked room to safety,\u201d the statement said.  When Whitefeather and Lantz arrived hours later, the deputy wrote, \u201cMs. Whitefeather made the admission to Det. Alford that the children were left in the shed but stated they \u2018like it.\u2019\u201d An affidavit from a lieutenant in the sheriff\u2019s office indicated that the police encounter in October 2023 was preceded by two other concerned 911 calls about the wellbeing of the children. Both callers, in May and June 2023, told dispatchers that children living there were \u201csleeping in the barn\u201d and using a portable toilet outside, according to the affidavit. Both times, Whitefeather and Lantz claimed to responding deputies that they had just moved to the site from Washington State and were using the portable toilet due to plumbing issues in their new home, the statement said. \u201cMs. Whitefeather told the deputies that people in the area don\u2019t like them, and vehicles had been stopping on the roadway in front of their residence,\u201d the lieutenant wrote of the June 2023 encounter. \u201cThis call was cleared with \u2018no police action necessary.\u2019\u201d A grand jury returned an indictment against Whitefeather and Lantz in May that allege, among other things, that the couple did \u201cknowingly, feloniously, and willfully traffic a minor,\u201d and \u201cdid recruit, entice, and obtain the victim of the offense from a shelter and facility that serves runaway youths, children in foster care, the homeless and victims of human trafficking, domestic violence and sexual assault.\u201d The pair are each being held on $500,000 \u201ccash-only\u201d bonds, according to an arraignment order.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/27/us/west-virginia-adopted-black-children-slaves-reaj/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/01/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_30_politics_democratic-party-replacement-worries-joe-biden", "text": "They\u2019re not writing anything down. They\u2019re not making any firm commitments. But between staring into phones that started buzzing about three minutes into the debate and haven\u2019t stopped since, several of Joe Biden\u2019s leading possible Democratic replacements and top aides have started to think through what an unprecedented last-minute fight into the August convention might look like. They\u2019re already carefully monitoring their prospective opponents\u2019 moves as they go, looking both for openings and ways to call them out for getting ahead of the president. Multiple people connected with other candidates, for example, noted the \u201cinteresting timing\u201d of an already-scheduled fundraising appeal that Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer\u2019s PAC texted\u00a0out on Friday evening\u00a0that reads almost like a mission statement for her and points out how she won in her key presidential battleground state. More than two dozen top Democratic officials, political operatives and donors tied to Biden and to many of the people most discussed as potential substitutes \u2013 many of whom asked for anonymity to discuss the most politically fraught situation most have ever encountered \u2013 say they\u2019re terrified by nearly every scenario: Going forward with Biden, a Kamala Harris nomination, a nomination of someone else who would in that case have beaten the first Black female vice president, long nights of multiple ballots spilling ideological and personal feuds on national television, even just revelations of embarrassing details about people who have never been vetted by a national campaign. \u201cIt would be a Category 5 hurricane,\u201d said one top Democratic official nervous about Biden considering what would happen if the president stepped aside. \u201cPeople don\u2019t understand the sheer destruction that would be unleashed.\u201d To others, that stems from a prisoner\u2019s mentality that doesn\u2019t consider how much resistance there is to Trump. \u201cI think we can absolutely swap and win,\u201d said a major Democratic donor. \u201cIf Joe Biden\u2019s the nominee, we\u2019re all in. If someone else is the nominee, we\u2019re all in.\u201d A CBS News/YouGov poll out Sunday morning found only 55% of registered Democratic voters saying Biden should continue running, with 45% saying he should step aside. Biden campaign aides have spent the last couple of days pointing to metrics like some of their best grassroots fundraising days and a surge in job applications since Thursday. None of the speculation matters if a president who will be three months older by the next scheduled debate doesn\u2019t step aside. So far, he has stuck to an apologetic but defiant posture in public while in private saying he knows how bad his performance was but that he still thinks his candidacy is the only way forward. And since he won all the primaries, he controls most of the delegates, which means that they can only vote for someone else if he decides to pull out. Democrats feeling the ground move beneath their feet Multiple Democratic officials and operatives, some of whom are affiliated with alternatives and those who are not, rage that Biden has demonstrated too much of an ego to have bowed out before. The president\u2019s argument that he was the Democrat best able to beat Trump, several said, has now been turned on its head and they are left feeling he\u2019s the option least able to beat Trump. They say the president\u2019s inner circle who have been running the campaign and prepared him for the debate \u2013 and who told some privately ahead of Thursday night that the prep had gone well \u2013 are either not being honest or are not capable of steering him either toward an exit or a recovery. At a LGBTQ fundraiser in New York City on Friday night, one attendee said some of the conversations even turned against Jill Biden, with the deep love for her as the quirky reluctant political spouse quickly curdling into exasperation that she is not willing to make the move that would lead to them leaving the White House. Even as minds turn to a list that includes Harris, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, Whitmer, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, California Gov. Gavin Newsom, Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly, Georgia Sen. Raphael Warnock, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and even relatively new Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and Maryland Gov. Wes Moore, none have gone public with anything but words of support for Biden. They worry about being called traitors. They worry that it might make Biden dig in more. A debate watch party in Los Angeles on Thursday night happened to feature Harris\u2019 husband Doug Emhoff, Pritzker, Whitmer and Beshear. There were other high-profile attendees \u2013 by a few answers in, Rob Reiner was screaming about losing and Jane Fonda had tears in her eyes, according to people in the room. Even Barack Obama is choosing his words carefully. When asked about the debate by House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries at a fundraiser for House Democrats, he said Biden has \u201cthe values that reflect the best in America,\u201d but politics is a \u201cteam sport,\u201d with the president as \u201cthe captain.\u201d He added that getting Jeffries to be speaker is \u201cprobably the most important thing we can do for the Biden reelection campaign as well.\u201d Biden campaign aides dismiss not only the possibility that he will drop out, but that anyone could actually do better, or go up against Trump with a list of supporters that runs from progressive icon Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to conservative GOP former Georgia Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan. \u201cYou win elections by bringing everyone under one banner. If the imperative to you is winning, the best chance we have of doing it is the guy who has been in the White House, has a historic record of accomplishment and already beaten Donald Trump once, and not any of this mess,\u201d a senior Biden adviser told CNN. But in one demonstration of the scramble that the campaign is in over how to shoot down the replacement talk: on Friday morning, Biden aides said on a call that included a number of Democratic operatives that it would be dispatching Donna Brazile, the former interim chair of the Democratic National Committee, and leading Democratic operative Stephanie Cutter to explain why replacement would be a fantasy. Brazile, who has written about how she looked into the possibility of a post-convention replacement of the nominee after Hillary Clinton\u2019s stumble at a September 11 event in 2016, told CNN that she was not told this in advance. Cutter said she had not been either. But both said they remain committed to Biden and urged others to do the same. New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat who eyed a possible 2024 run of his own had Biden decided not to run, said he had dinner with Biden on Saturday night at a fundraiser he and his wife hosted and felt confident sticking by the president. Still, he mentioned the president\u2019s age twice in a brief interview, saying \u201che\u2019s 81.\u201d \u201cThere are very few people who can span the broad interests of our beloved Democratic Party in the same way he can. And he\u2019s proven that,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cThat\u2019s not a prospective, \u2018Hey, I think he could do this.\u2019 He has done it. Not sure who else can do that.\u201d Murphy said he hadn\u2019t considered another option because \u201cbased on every data point, a dimension that I\u2019m aware of, he\u2019s not going anywhere.\u201d Harris\u2019 advantage going into an open convention If there is an opening, most agree Harris would have the early edge. If Biden did make a sudden exit, there would be pressure for him to give his party some direction, and doing anything other than tapping his vice president would be a snub bigger than when Obama wounded him so deeply by making clear that he saw Hillary Clinton as his own successor in the run-up to the 2016 election. To a convention hall full of loyal Biden delegates trying to recover their equilibrium, endorsing Harris could carry a lot of weight. A Harris backer insisted that the interest in anyone else at this point is just \u201cthe appeal of the unknown.\u201d Being unknown can have benefits, such as not having any of the entrenched bad feelings that have come to define her in the minds of some voters. But it also means that none of them have had their pasts and records delved into the way she has over her abbreviated presidential campaign, her time as running mate and as vice president. As the other name on the Biden-Harris campaign, the vice president would also be the only one legally able to take over the entire existing operation, along with all the money already raised \u2013 a fact overlooked by the Biden campaign in an email from deputy campaign manager Rob Flaherty to supporters, which insisted that an alternative starting with zero dollars in their bank account would be \u201ca highway to losing.\u201d That would be on top of being the potential replacement with the largest national name recognition. She also stands even or a little ahead any of the other contenders in most of the polls that have posed the question of replacing Biden. People around Harris have of course considered all this. But her approach since the debate has been to put herself forward as the most dutiful and most loyal defender, to the point that the first lady \u2013 who has made her frustrations with Harris clear in the past \u2013 on Friday night picked up the defense that Harris landed on immediately after the debate. The vice president\u2019s \u201cI\u2019m not going to spend all night with you talking about the last 90 minutes when I\u2019ve been watching the last three-and-a-half years of performance,\u201d which people in her orbit say she came up with on the fly herself, has since been picked up by campaign operatives in addition to the first lady. Harris would have other advantages too. A top outside political adviser, Minyon Moore, was months ago named the official in charge of convention proceedings, and others like her former chief of staff Tina Flournoy and Brazile have key committee roles too. Nor are her supporters shy about making their opinions known. In an interview, Brazile said that her reaction to the calls that she has been getting since the debate with people inquiring about other candidates is: \u201cHow the f**k are you going to put all these white people ahead of Kamala?\u201d Backers of other possible candidates acknowledge that the internal feelings of deference toward her would be widespread and hard to overcome, and fears about the backlash among Black and women voters from ditching her would run extremely high. \u201cBiden\u2018s not stepping down and Kamala Harris gets the first shot in any open convention scenario,\u201d said one DNC delegate fond of one of the alternatives. Still, many worry that that\u2019s the kind of feeling that could mean much more among delegates to a Democratic convention than a wider electorate, and that it would just be setting her up to be the one carrying the banner into defeat. Potential for long nights fighting on national TV Not everyone is convinced. In a time of crisis for the Democratic Party like what this would open up, a combination of ambition and sense of duty would clearly be enticing. People connected with other prospective candidates say that Harris\u2019 years of scrutiny, association with Biden and her own word-salad answers could be too much to let her get a free pass. Some are already gaming out Harris failing on the first ballot and jumping in then. \u201cWould it be very hard and challenging? Yes. but I think there\u2019s actually a benefit to whoever the white knight is, riding in on a horse to save the campaign and the country,\u201d said one senior Democratic operative. But that probably would mean multiple candidates rushing around the convention floor making all sorts of promises, going through multiple ballots, with a melee of clashing candidacies and other interests all on non-stop coverage. Not to mention that it\u2019s been decades since the last floor fight. The happy activists who tend to get picked as delegates don\u2019t know how to cut backroom deals. They don\u2019t even know the rules. Democratic operatives always like to mock headlines that describe them as \u201cin disarray.\u201d Now some tell CNN they worry they could end up in more disarray than ever. Some operatives are already daydreaming about who would be part of various outreach teams, which chits they\u2019d be able to call in from previous support, what strengths they\u2019d emphasize about their preferred candidates and what points could undercut prospective opponents. This kind of showdown would almost certainly benefit politicians who could get good teams together quickly, several acknowledged, making a Cinderella story less likely than an established force who moves in hard and fast. Democratic operatives know that political junkies will love it, but they worry about the message that will send to the country overall as they try to put themselves forward as the alternatives to Trump-style chaos and fighting. That, several said, doesn\u2019t look like a formula for winning either. \u201cPresident Biden is the nominee and he\u2019s going to remain the nominee,\u201d said Cutter, who is on contract to produce the convention. \u201cFor those who are for looking for some sort of interparty fight, be careful what you wish for because that would ensure a Trump victory.\u201d Among some, talk has turned to just soldiering through, hoping that the polls don\u2019t show a collapse and the debate panic fades into the July 4 holiday. Biden himself claimed at a fundraiser in the Hamptons on Saturday that \u201cvoters had a different reaction than the pundits\u201d and he\u2019s seen polls that show the voters are backing him more after the debate. \u201cOne hundred percent, he\u2019s the nominee,\u201d said California Rep. Robert Garcia, an avid Biden backer. \u201cAnything else is unserious chatter.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/30/politics/democratic-party-replacement-worries-joe-biden/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/01/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_27_us_what-we-know-houston-jocelyn-nungaray-killing", "text": "Twelve-year-old\u00a0Jocelyn Nungaray\u00a0was walking to a convenience store in Houston when she disappeared, police say; she was found dead in a creek earlier this month. Two undocumented men from Venezuela are accused of killing the girl and both are facing charges of capital murder in her death, according to the Houston Police Department. Both are being held on a $10 million bond this week, court records show. As Jocelyn\u2019s family laid her to rest Thursday, remembering her as a kind, good-hearted child who was her mother\u2019s best friend, Mayor John Whitmire called for justice, reminding attendees that children \u201care not supposed to be taken off the streets of Houston.\u201d This is also the latest case to bring immigration to the forefront as a critical issue this election year, as the two men were in the country illegally, according to the US Department of Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Here\u2019s what we know so far about the cases around Jocelyn\u2019s death: Who was Jocelyn? Born on December 27, 2011, Jocelyn\u2019s family called her a \u201cloyal, compassionate and caring friend\u201d who supported those around her, her obituary says. Her kindness and \u201czest for life\u201d are among the things her family wants people to remember her for. At her celebration of life service, Jocelyn\u2019s sister Gabby remembered how the two of them would laugh, play, cry and \u201cget on each other\u2019s nerves.\u201d She described her older sister as smart and having a good heart. \u201cJossy also gave me courage to be myself and speak up for myself and for that I will always be grateful to you. I love you, Jossy,\u201d Gabby said. Jocelyn loved animals and wanted them all to have homes, not understanding why some were strays. Green was her favorite color. Jocelyn enjoyed fantasy, whether it was the magic of Harry Potter, vampire-film classic \u201cTwilight\u201d or the upside down of TV\u2019s \u201cStranger Things,\u201d her obituary reads. She even had a crush on \u201cStranger Things\u201d star Finn Wolfhard. She is survived by her mother, Alexis, brother, and \u201csister\u201d Gabby, as well as her grandparents and numerous family members. What happened to Jocelyn? Surveillance footage of the area obtained by detectives showed the suspects at a restaurant together the evening of June 16, Lt. Stephen Hope of the Houston Police Department said at a news conference after their arrests. The men left on foot and were later seen meeting and talking with Jocelyn, Hope said, before all three walked to a convenience store. A few minutes later, Hope said, they went to a bridge. Prosecutors allege the men killed Jocelyn and threw her body in the bayou. Jocelyn\u2019s body was found along West Rankin Road in a shallow creek in north Houston early in the morning of June 17, authorities have said. The 12-year-old was strangled to death, according to the medical examiner, the Associated Press reported. What we know about the accused men Johan Jose Martinez-Rangel, 22, and\u00a0Franklin Jose Pe\u00f1a Ramos, 26, were arrested June 20, three days after Jocelyn\u2019s strangled body was found in the creek, according to the Houston Police Department. Both men are from Venezuela and entered the US illegally, a spokesperson for US Immigration and Customs Enforcement told CNN. Where and when they entered the country is unclear, the spokesperson said, but each had been apprehended near El Paso by US Border Patrol \u2013\u00a0Martinez-Rangel on\u00a0March\u00a014\u00a0and Pe\u00f1a Ramos on May\u00a028\u00a0\u2013 and released with a notice to appear in court in the future. An attorney for Pe\u00f1a Ramos declined to comment. An attorney for Martinez-Rangel did not immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday. Where are the suspects now? Both men are under immigration holds by federal authorities, according to the AP, which means they could not leave custody even if they could post bond. Family and community reaction After her daughter\u2019s body was found, Alexis Nungaray cried as she realized the heartbreaking news she would have to share with her family. \u201cI\u2019m, like, angry that they took advantage of her. She was so young. She was 12. You took my baby away, you took her away,\u201d the mother told CNN affiliate KHOU on June 19. \u201cNow, I get to let her little brother know his older sister is never coming home.\u201d At a news conference on June 24, Nungaray shared her frustration that her daughter\u2019s life was taken from her. \u201cShe had such a bright future ahead of her and I knew she was going to go very far. And, you know, these monsters took that opportunity from her,\u201d she said. Laying her to rest During Thursday\u2019s celebration of life service, one of Jocelyn\u2019s favorite songs, \u201cConey Island Baby,\u201d flowed through the crowded room as a slideshow of her life played. The song is from the 1960s and way before her time, but it fit Jocelyn\u2019s eclectic music tastes. Stories emerged about Jocelyn and her sister making slime together and watching sunsets, reminding the room of a life lost too soon. Her great-aunt broke down in tears, but she stirred some laughs when she talked about Jossy\u2019s love for books. \u201cJossy loved to read. Anytime we were at Walmart or any store, that girl would try to beeline for the book section all day, every day,\u201d she said. A reception is being hosted at Gallery Furniture on North Freeway in Houston after the celebration of life to support the family, according to a Facebook post from the store owner. Jim McIngvale, known as \u201cMattress Mack,\u201d\u00a0is well known for his charitable work, like turning his stores into shelters to help people affected by Hurricane Harvey and other severe weather events.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/27/us/what-we-know-houston-jocelyn-nungaray-killing/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/01/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_30_us_missouri-prison-guards-othel-moore-death", "text": "Five former corrections officers are facing\u00a0a combination of assault, manslaughter and murder charges\u00a0over the December 8, 2023, death of Othel Moore Jr., a former inmate at a maximum security prison in Jefferson City, Missouri,\u00a0according to newly released indictments. The officers were part of a Corrections Emergency Response Team (CERT), which are specially trained units designed to deal with violent prison situations, at the Jefferson City Correctional Center. A former inmate at the correctional center tells CNN he witnessed\u00a0officers create\u00a0the violent circumstances that killed the 39-year-old Moore, whose 2023 death forms part of an especially deadly year in Missouri prisons. \u201cI never watched anybody die before,\u201d Jordan Seller, 27, told CNN, as he explained the events leading to Moore\u2019s death began with what was supposed to be a routine search of the cells on the maximum-security prison block he shared with Moore. \u201cThey come in like a hundred deep, you know, and that\u2019s barely an exaggeration, you know, they try to come in and pull everybody out as fast as they can, search cells fast as they can and get out,\u201d Seller said. He and his cellmate had already been pulled out and put back in their cell when they noticed the commotion building around Moore\u2019s cell, Seller says. \u201cThe cell was surrounded by CO\u2019s,\u201d or corrections officers, Seller said and that Moore was pleading with them he had a medical lay-in and needed to be put in two pairs of handcuffs, essentially latched together with the outside rings on the wrist to ease tension on the shoulders being pulled back. Seller said they\u2019re commonly used for bigger inmates or those who may have trouble putting their hands behind their backs. Seller says the correctional officers refused to listen to Moore and began treating him as if he was non-compliant. The officers proceeded to pepper spray Moore, slam him to the ground and force him into a single pair of handcuffs, he says. \u201cHe can\u2019t see. He\u2019s spitting out mace, he\u2019s coughing, he can\u2019t breathe and he\u2019s telling them \u2018I\u2019m allergic to mace, you need to hurry up and get medical here,\u2019\u201d Seller said. Seller says he was looking up at the commotion from his cell on the lower floor of the prison block before Moore was brought down the stairs closer to him in a \u201creal aggressive\u201d manner. The correctional officers placed Moore\u00a0in \u201csome kind of chair-like contraption,\u201d according to Seller,\u00a0which the county prosecuting attorney has said was a restraint chair, sometimes used in corrections facilities. Seller says the prison guards began to place a spit mask on Moore, but Seller maintained he was only spitting out mace. \u201cOf course, he\u2019s refusing this because there\u2019s no reason for them to put a spit mask on,\u201d said Seller, who also says he witnessed this a few feet from his cell door. \u201cHe don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on. He can\u2019t see, you know, so they\u2019re grabbing on him trying to put something on his head. He\u2019s fighting it. Well, then they started shocking him with the shock glove.\u201d Seller then recounted what he believes were Moore\u2019s final moments, when the officers pulled out what appeared to be \u201can all-black motorcycle helmet, you know, darkened mask, all that,\u201d and put it on Moore\u2019s head. \u201cImmediately he\u2019s jumping, hopping, and you can hear him screaming, you know, \u2018Help! I can\u2019t breathe. I can\u2019t breathe, take it off. I can\u2019t breathe. I\u2019m, I\u2019m allergic to mace. I need help.\u2019 And then it gets worse and worse,\u201d Seller said. \u201cHe\u2019s jumping up and down shaking. And, you know, slowly, his screams are getting weaker and weaker,\u201d Seller said. \u201cI believe I watched him die before they even took him out the wing,\u201d he said. \u201cI watched the people that are supposed to be protecting me, kill somebody, literally killed them, you know? And that brought on such a fear, you know? The realization that these people can kill me and there\u2019s nothing I can do about it,\u201d said Seller. Moore was declared dead that day. What the indictment says When the arrests were made Friday, Cole County Prosecuting Attorney Locke Thompson largely corroborated to CNN Seller\u2019s eyewitness account of what happened to Moore, including the use of a \u201cspit mask and padded helmet.\u201d During a contraband sweep of the prison, Moore \u201cwas pepper sprayed twice during the operation before being placed in a spit hood, leg wrap, and restraint chair and transferred to a separate housing unit, where he was left in the hood, wrap, and restraint chair for approximately thirty minutes,\u201d the prosecutor said in a statement. Thompson said, \u201cMultiple witnesses heard Moore pleading with the corrections staff and telling them that he could not breathe\u201d before he was transferred to the prison hospital wing and pronounced dead. A statement of probable cause against the charged officers describing the incident said Moore \u201cshowed no aggression to any members of the CERT team during this process and was on video being compliant,\u201d and that Moore \u201cmade no threats to anyone.\u201d The use of a \u201cshock glove\u201d on Moore, as Seller described to CNN, was not mentioned by the prosecutor. Former corrections officers Justin Leggins, Jacob Case, Aaron Brown, Gregory Varner and Bryanne Bradshaw were all charged in this case. Leggins and Case were charged with second-degree murder and second-degree assault, in part for \u201crecklessly\u201d causing physical injury to Moore by pepper-spraying him in the face, according to court documents. Brown was charged with second-degree murder, and assault in the second degree, for \u201crecklessly\u201d causing serious physical injury to Moore by \u201cplacing a mask\u201d over Moore\u2019s face, which \u201cinhibited\u201d his ability to breathe, according to a joint felony complaint against the officers. Varner was charged with second-degree murder and assault in the second degree for \u201crecklessly\u201d causing \u201cserious physical injury\u201d to Moore by leaving him \u201cin a position which caused his asphyxiation,\u201d the complaint said. Bradshaw was charged with involuntary manslaughter in the second degree and is accused of negligently causing Moore\u2019s death by leaving him in a position that caused \u201casphyxiation,\u201d the complaint alleges. CNN has attempted to identify attorneys for each of the former officers arrested but has not been able to make contact. An initial appearance in front of a judge is expected for these former officers on Monday, the county\u2019s prosecuting attorney told CNN. In response to the murder charges, the Missouri Department of Corrections said in a statement it \u201chas discontinued use of the restraint system in which Moore was held.\u201d Additionally, the statement said the department has begun using body-worn cameras in maximum-security prisons, starting with Jefferson City Correctional Center, to \u201cbolster both security and accountability.\u201d It also said 10 people involved in the incident have been terminated following internal and independent law enforcement investigations, including the five officers charged. The corrections department previously confirmed that the warden of the prison at the time of Moore\u2019s killing, Doris Falkenrath, was no longer with the department. Falkenrath was not among those arrested and not listed on the indictments filed Friday. Following the indictment, Othel Moore\u2019s family filed a federal civil lawsuit against the officers, the prison warden at the time of the killing and the previous director of the Missouri Department of Corrections, alleging, in part, that Moore is dead \u201cbecause of the actions, inactions, conscious disregard, willful and wanton, and depraved behavior\u201d of the then corrections officers. The suit also alleges the \u201cattack\u201d was not an isolated incident but the \u201cmanifestation of a barbarous pattern and practice, fostered by the highest-ranking members of the Missouri Department of Corrections.\u201d A spokesperson for the Missouri Department of Corrections told CNN the department won\u2019t comment on pending litigation. Attorneys Andrew M. Stroth and Steven Hart are among those representing Moore\u2019s family. In remarks to the press Friday following the announcement of the charges, Stroth said, \u201cThese charges are historic. These charges are unprecedented. When you hear about what happened, witnesses saw what happened, video evidence shows what happened. It\u2019s George Floyd 3.0 in a prison. Othel Moore, like George Floyd, was beaten. Othel was actually pepper sprayed, they put a spit mask on his face, they put him in the prone position face down. They shocked him with shock gloves. The entire time before his death was screaming. \u2018I can\u2019t breathe.\u2019\u201d Stroth told CNN: \u201cI\u2019ve reviewed hundreds of police cases, prison cases, this is one of the most egregious cases I have ever seen.\u201d \u2018We want transparency and accountability\u2019 It\u2019s also part of a worsening trend in the Missouri prison system. From 2012 to 2019, the average number of deaths, which includes natural deaths, hovered around 99 per year, according to state data obtained by CNN through a Missouri Sunshine Law request. From 2020 to 2023, the average number of deaths then climbed to 128 per year, a near 30 percent jump. There were fewer people incarcerated in Missouri in 2023 than at any time since at least 2012, according to state data. However, it was the prison system\u2019s deadliest year over that time period. Last year saw 137 prison deaths, with Othel Moore among them. Lori Curry, founder and executive director of the non-profit advocacy group Missouri Prison Reform, told CNN her group is regularly in touch with around 900 inmates, or \u201cresidents of prisons,\u201d as Curry described them, to use more humanizing language. Her organization also tracks deaths reported in prisons and based on the data they provided to CNN, \u201cwhat (the state) refer to as natural deaths\u201d was the most frequent listing as manner of death in their numbers over 2022 and 2023. However, Curry cast doubt on the state listings and attributes the rise in the number of deaths in recent years to \u201cdeclining healthcare, an increase in drugs and overdoses, and an increase of staffing shortages,\u201d she told CNN. She said her advocacy group quickly learned about the disturbing circumstances around Moore\u2019s killing. \u201cPeople in prisons notified us about the situation immediately,\u201d Curry said. She also believes\u00a0\u201cthe Department of Corrections needs to be more forthcoming\u201d about the information around this and that if lawyers, family and others were not so vocal about the case it would not have stayed in the spotlight. Curry founded Missouri Prison Reform in 2019 after launching an anonymous Twitter account where she reported stories relayed to her by inmates. Many years and many stories later, \u201cI\u2019ve been appalled at the things that have gone on in [Missouri] prisons,\u201d she told CNN. \u201cWe want transparency and accountability from our department of corrections,\u201d she added. Seller, who has seen the dynamic between guards and inmates up close, says he wants the same thing. \u201cI see police officers out here wearing body cameras all the time, you know, and it\u2019s required for their stops, arrests, all that. And I believe that\u2019s the only solution for the way that inmates are getting treated is that the CO\u2019s are required to wear body cameras,\u201d Seller told CNN. \u201cYou can\u2019t trust the people that are supposed to protect you,\u201d he said. \u201cThis has become such a big pandemic. I mean, I\u2019m calling it a pandemic, you know, and it\u2019s severe and it\u2019s a big problem.\u201d Seller pleaded guilty to second-degree rape in 2018 and served six years in prison, state records show. He did his time at a few prisons before being released from the Jefferson City Correctional Center in March. \u201cI did a lot of good for myself in there, a lot of soul searching,\u201d Seller said. He told CNN his reason for coming forward was simple: \u201cIt\u2019s something that\u2019s wrong, that needs to be addressed. Something needs to change,\u201d he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/30/us/missouri-prison-guards-othel-moore-death/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/01/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_30_business_barbecue-grills-july-fourth-weber-traeger", "text": "To BBQ or not to BBQ? That is one question on Americans\u2019 minds heading toward July 4 as grills are not as hot of an item as they once were. The grill business saw a massive pandemic-era buying binge, but is now facing consumers worried about inflated meat prices, high interest rates and uncertainty. Many feel no need to upgrade fairly recent purchases. Market leaders like higher-end grill manufacturer Traeger, once a pandemic darling, reported its latest quarter\u2019s grill sales at $76.8 million \u2014 a plunge from the $156.1 million the company raked in during the second quarter of 2021. Best-selling outdoor cooker brand Weber has also seen unit shares decline since 2020, according to data from Traqline. (Weber did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment.) Retailer Home Depot also reported pressure in big-ticket patio and garden equipment, including grills, during its first quarter earnings call in May as the company reported overall dips in sales and earnings. And it\u2019s not just the big brands. Local stores that sell grills and other backyard cooking gear similarly reported demand slacking off.  \u201cIt\u2019s trending down,\u201d said Brian Bushfield, general manager at West Coast BBQ Shop in San Diego, California. He noted a sluggish start to June and a slow Memorial Day, despite the holiday being one of the most popular occasions to purchase new grills. So, what\u2019s going on? Lockdown was a grill (seller)\u2019s best friend It\u2019s not a result of Americans cooking outside on grills less. At least, that\u2019s according to statistics from the Hearth, Patio & Barbecue Association that reported 80% of U.S. homeowners owned a grill or smoker in 2023 \u2014 up from 64% in 2019.\u202fOf the new grill owners surveyed, 27% cited cooking more at home during Covid as the reason for their purchase. Home Depot Senior Merchant of Grills Joe Downey said it isn\u2019t just cookers that make up the retailer\u2019s grill category. Consumables like charcoal pellets and propane tanks drive a large portion of sales, which he says are powered by new customers who purchased grills during the pandemic returning frequently to buy fuel. \u201cMore cooks are cooking at home than ever before,\u201d he said. Roy Morchian, owner of American Royal Hardware in Montclair, New Jersey, told CNN that he saw a bump in the number of grills sold during the pandemic \u2013 around 160 grills sold in 2020 compared to the store\u2019s yearly average range of 80 to 120 grills. And while their sales \u201chave come back to normal\u201d now closer to pre-pandemic levels, he notices new faces have joined familiar ones when purchasing propane tanks to fuel the Weber grills they stock. Most grill makers and retailers seem to agree that the pandemic pulled forward demand for grills and other long-lasting home equipment as people searched for ways to fill their days and entertain their families at home. San Diego Grill Pros owner Jessica Hernandez recounted \u201castronomical\u201d sales numbers and dubbed 2020 their \u201cunicorn year.\u201d Corey Martin, VP of Marketing at Texas Star Grill Shop described droves of people flocking to their Houston branch to buy grills and shelling out thousands of dollars for higher-end models like Weber\u2019s Genesis, which retails between $800 and $1,800, and Traeger\u2019s Timberline, which starts at about $3,000. \u201cIt was like a really busy grocery store,\u201d he said of his shop. But he and his staff knew that 2020 might be an aberration and the windfall might not last. \u201cIt would be stupid to be in a grill business and think that Covid was the new normal,\u201d Martin said. He said retailers who sell grills know it\u2019s a slow growth and seasonal industry. Downey sees Home Depot\u2019s grill sales stabilizing now following the lockdown-driven high. He anticipates that pandemic-purchased grills will reach the end of their life cycle and bring returning buyers with them in 2025. \u201cThe bottom has been reached and we are on the upswing in terms of getting closer to the end of [the grill] life cycle,\u201d he said. A key issue is a grill\u2019s life cycle: an average grill could last about five years and Americans purchased more than 21 million grills and smokers in 2020. When you do the math, it\u2019s clear that the replacement phase still hasn\u2019t kicked in quite yet. Reigniting the market Meanwhile, grill sellers are looking for ways to stoke demand. Beyond running familiar summer promotions for popular grilling days like Memorial Day and Father\u2019s Day, Downey said that Home Depot is trying to encourage young first-time homeowners to buy grills by introducing them to well-known brands at lower price points. Downey said somebody purchasing a $99 Weber kettle later might look to buy the compact Weber Spirit. \u201cThen as they grow, maybe they\u2019ll aspire to get into the Weber Genesis,\u201d he said, referencing the brand\u2019s more expensive model. Ace Hardware is running advertisements promoting its longstanding free assembly and delivery on grills \u2013- from brands such as Big Green Egg, Blackstone, Weber and Traeger \u2013 priced $399 and up, for Ace Rewards members, which is a free program to join. Traeger CEO Jeremy Andrus told CNN of the soft demand period \u201cWe are not waiting for this to end and riding it out.\u201d He pointed to Traeger hosting weekend cooking demonstrations outside of retail stores like Home Depot and Ace Hardware. \u201cIf we have an opportunity to get in front of the consumer and not only explain what a Traeger does but give them an opportunity to taste the food cooked off of a Traeger, it\u2019s a very effective conversion tool,\u201d he said. But even with efforts in marketing, discounting and other special offers, firing up demand in a traditionally slow-growth industry is a challenge, according to Simeon Siegel, an analyst at BMO Capital Markets who follows Traeger. \u201cIf someone has a barbecue, they\u2019re not going to buy another simply because it\u2019s on sale,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the end of the day, if someone doesn\u2019t need to buy a grill, there\u2019s only so many things companies can do to create demand.\u201d And economic trends haven\u2019t helped. Price data from the US Department of Agriculture showed prices of many foods, including beef, rose in 2022 and 2023. \u201cBeef and veal prices have risen the fastest of all categories\u201d in 2024 the USDA said in May. It expects beef and veal prices to rise another 4% this year. And some consumers are abandoning meat entirely. A year and a half ago, Bloomfield, New Jersey, resident Shikhiu Ing traded grilled meat for greens as a part of a conscious health decision. While he describes firing up his grill three times a week during the pandemic, he now finds less use for it after going mostly vegetarian. \u201cIt\u2019s non-functional right now. Grilling vegetables is kind of a chore to be honest,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just faster in the air fryer. Throw some broccoli in there, air fry. You got vegetables.\u201d Hot grill summers are here to stay? The grill industry isn\u2019t a stranger to slumps or about-face shifts in consumer demand. Andrus pointed to grill sales declining in the years following the 2008 recession before returning to growth for the next 10 years as a testament to the industry\u2019s resiliency. \u201cAmericans love to cook outdoors,\u201d he said. \u201cThey always have, they always will.\u201d For Newark, New Jersey, native Ayla Dunkley, cooking outdoors has been a family tradition. \u201cI learned how to grill from my grandfather and my father, so I learned everything from them,\u201d she said. Following her grandfather\u2019s advice, Dunkley replaces her Blackstone cooker every three to five years and waits until the summer season is over to shop at lower prices. Fourth of July cookouts will\u00a0cost $71.22 on average for 10 guests this summer, according to data from the American Farm Bureau Federation. That\u2019s up 5% from last year and up 30% from 2019. Yet Dunkley\u2019s annual plans to celebrate the holiday with her family in Pennsylvania are still on, grill in tow.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/30/business/barbecue-grills-july-fourth-weber-traeger/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/01/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_18_politics_supreme-court-trump-immunity", "text": "The Supreme Court\u2019s most closely watched dispute this year \u2013 a case questioning whether former President Donald Trump may claim immunity from federal election subversion charges \u2013 also has the potential to be one of the hardest to parse for meaning in real time. In between Trump\u2019s initial demand for total immunity and an appeals court ruling earlier this year that found he\u2019s entitled to no protection at all is a murky gap with massive practical implications for whether he can be tried before the November election. At issue is special counsel Jack Smith\u2019s prosecution of Trump\u2019s effort to overturn the 2020 election, including with his actions on January 6, 2021, though the court\u2019s decision could have implications for other criminal cases against Trump as well. In addition to the bottom line ruling about whether Trump is immune from prosecution could be important clues about how quickly the matter will go to trial. \u201cTrump has already won something,\u201d said Jonathan Entin, a professor at Case Western Reserve University\u2019s School of Law. \u201cAs a practical matter, Trump has gained time here, regardless of how the court decides the case.\u201d  The Supreme Court\u2019s decision is expected to be announced Monday. Here\u2019s a look at some possible outcomes and what those decisions could mean for the timing of a trial. Trump\u2019s out of luck: No immunity The simplest outcome would be for the Supreme Court to rule that former presidents are not entitled to immunity from criminal prosecution.  That was the conclusion the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit reached in February in a unanimous opinion. That ruling could allow Trump\u2019s trial to get underway almost immediately. \u201cFor the purpose of this criminal case, former President Trump has become citizen Trump, with all of the defenses of any other criminal defendant,\u201d the three-judge panel of the appeals court wrote. \u201cBut any executive immunity that may have protected him while he served as President no longer protects him against this prosecution.\u201d But if the Supreme Court agreed with that approach, it probably wouldn\u2019t have taken up Trump\u2019s appeal in the first place. During oral arguments on April 25, several of the court\u2019s centrist conservatives \u2013 notably Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Brett Kavanaugh \u2013 made clear that they didn\u2019t agree with the appeals court\u2019s approach. \u201cAs I read it, it says simply a former president can be prosecuted because he\u2019s being prosecuted,\u201d Roberts said derisively during the arguments. \u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t we either send it back to the court of appeals or issue an opinion making clear that that\u2019s not the law?\u201d It\u2019s also clear that many of the court\u2019s conservatives want to address issues that are much broader than the specifics of Trump\u2019s case.  Justice Neil Gorsuch framed the court\u2019s task as \u201cwriting a rule for the ages.\u201d Kavanaugh said the court\u2019s decision would have implications for the \u201cfuture of the presidency\u201d and the \u201cthe future of the country.\u201d Neither of those statements speak to a limited ruling \u2013 or a quick outcome in Trump\u2019s specific case. Nixon and the \u2018outer perimeter\u2019 of power But the justices could reach more broadly by granting some degree of immunity for \u201cofficial\u201d actions. Based on the oral arguments, it appeared there was support for doing so. That outcome would raise a number of substantial questions, including what counts as an \u201cofficial\u201d action. Trump based most of his argument on a 1982 decision called Nixon v. Fitzgerald in which the Supreme Court ruled that presidents enjoy \u201cabsolute immunity\u201d from civil lawsuits for official actions to the \u201couter perimeter\u201d of their duties. The case involved a former Air Force employee,\u00a0A. Ernest Fitzgerald, who was fired after he provided damaging testimony to Congress about production problems with the C-5A transport plane. Fitzgerald tried to sue former President Richard Nixon for damages. Trump now argues that the civil immunity the Supreme Court granted former presidents in the Fitzgerald case should apply to criminal prosecutions of former presidents as well. If the court embraced that approach, it wouldn\u2019t end Smith\u2019s case, but it could seriously delay a trial. It would also refocus attention on another debate: How much of Trump\u2019s post-election actions were official conduct as opposed to private actions. How Trump can \u2018lose by winning\u2019 No matter what the majority of the Supreme Court decides about immunity for official conduct, at least a portion of the charges against Trump could proceed if some of his actions were private \u2013 that is, steps he took as a candidate or private citizen rather than as a president. That official-versus-private debate emerged as a key component of Trump\u2019s immunity battle and will be closely scrutinized once the opinion lands. Trump\u2019s lawyer conceded during the argument that many of the actions his client took were private, such as asking his attorney Rudy Giuliani to spread false election fraud claims. If the court makes clear that some of Trump\u2019s actions were private and not covered by any official act immunity, that could speed the path to a trial. \u201cTrump can win by losing by running out the clock,\u201d said Matthew Seligman, an attorney and a fellow at the Constitutional Law Center at Stanford Law School who co-wrote a piece for\u00a0Just Security\u00a0gaming out potential outcomes in the case and an amicus brief supporting Smith\u2019s position. \u201cBut he can also lose by winning, because even if the court adopts his rule he still goes to trial because a critical set of his conduct is indisputably unofficial.\u201d\u00a0 Sending it back for trial The Supreme Court\u2019s decision could explicitly make clear that some of Trump\u2019s actions were private. Or it could set a standard for lower courts to use to decide what\u2019s official and what\u2019s not. How the justices deal with that will determine how quickly \u2013 or whether \u2013 Smith\u2019s case can proceed. \u201cOne option is the court itself says: \u2018These are official; these are private. These get immunity; these don\u2019t. The end,\u201d said Alison LaCroix, a professor at the University of Chicago Law School who is also a scholar of legal history. \u201cAnother option is the court lays out a standard for immunity \u2026 and tells the trial court, \u2018You figure out whether these were official or unofficial,\u201d she said. Under that scenario, the justices would send the case back to US District Judge Tanya Chutkan so she or a jury could decide which actions are private \u2013 and prosecutable. In terms of timing, a lot would depend on the direction the Supreme Court gives Chutkan in its opinion. If determinations about what counts as private versus public action must be made before a trial begins, that could dash Smith\u2019s timeline. It could also raise the possibility of further pre-trial legal wrangling, unless the Supreme Court explicitly ruled out appeals of those decisions. \u201cMost likely they will send the case back \u2013 probably, ultimately, to the district court \u2013 to resolve which aspects of the charges involve actions that are within the president\u2019s official duties, and which are not,\u201d Entin said. And that, he said, would likely mean no quick answers for Trump or Smith. \u201cA lot of it depends on how they write it,\u201d said LaCroix, who recently published a book that explores historic legal cases influencing modern controversies, including immunity. \u201cNobody likes \u2018we\u2019ll see,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cBut on some level, that\u2019s where we are.\u201d This story has been updated with additional details.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/18/politics/supreme-court-trump-immunity/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/01/2024", "section": "us"}}

According to Utica Police and bodycam footage released, when \u201cthe officers attempted to conduct a citizen stop of the two 13-year-old juveniles\u201d and tried to pat-frisk Nyah Mway, \u201che immediately fled on foot.\u201d While fleeing, police said, Nyah Mway pulled out what appeared to be a handgun but was later found to be a replica GLOCK pellet gun and pointed it at the police officers. One of the officers discharged his firearm once and shot the teen in the chest \u201cduring a ground struggle,\u201d Utica Police Chief Mark Williams said during a news conference Saturday. He was given \u201cimmediate\u201d first aid by the officers and taken to Wynn Hospital, where he died, according to Williams. The officers involved with the incident were identified by the police department as Patrick Husnay, Bryce Patterson, and Andrew Citriniti. Husnay was the officer who discharged his firearm and all three are on administrative leave with pay, according to police. CNN has reached out to the Utica Police Benevolent Association for comment. Body camera footage released by police shows chaotic struggle The body camera footage released by police shows one officer saying he needs to pat down the two juveniles to make sure they don\u2019t have any weapons in their possession. Nyah Mway immediately flees in the video. Some of the footage was edited to insert a red circle around the replica gun and authorities froze the frames where the teen appears to point it at the officers. The officers believed it was a handgun, police said, but it was later determined to be a replica of a GLOCK 17 Gen 5 handgun with a detachable magazine, The Associated Press reported. The replica gun carried by the teen \u201cis in all aspects a realistic appearing firearm with GLOCK markings, signatures, detachable magazine, and serial numbers,\u201d Lt. Michael Curley, a police spokesperson, said via email to The Associated Press. \u201cHowever ultimately it fires only pellets or BB\u2019s.\u201d The police body camera video shows a chaotic scene. In the footage, Nyah Mway appears to point the replica handgun at police while he flees. The officers yell \u201cgun,\u201d and one police officer tackles and punches the teenager. As they are wresting on the ground, another police officer fires a single shot. Bystanders scream at the police throughout the recordings, and at one point an officer yells back, \u201cWe\u2019re trying to save him right now!\u201d The other youth was detained in the back of a police vehicle and was not involved in the shooting, The Associated Press reported. The police department released the body camera videos following a public outcry as the shooting roiled Utica, a city with a population of 65,000. It is home to more than 4,200 people from Myanmar, according to The Center, a non-profit helping to resettle the refugees, The Associated Press reported. Nyah Mway, who local media reports said was an 8th grader at Donovan Middle School, was identified as a refugee born in Myanmar and a member of the Karen ethnic minority, The Associated Press reported. There are two ongoing, parallel investigations into the incident, according to police: one by the New York State Attorney General, and another by the Utica Police Department\u2019s Professional Standards. Tensions run high during news conference A news conference about the incident ended early Saturday after tensions ran high. The conference was stopped several times after audience members audibly booed and interrupted the police chief and Utica mayor. An interpreter struggled to speak over repeated audience outbursts. Members of the community, including the youth\u2019s family, were in attendance, The Associated Press reported. \u201cI know there\u2019s a lot of emotions in this room and a lot of upset people,\u201d the police chief said. \u201cBut you\u2019re asking us to be transparent \u2013 you\u2019re asking us to be transparent, and when you shout over us, it makes it very difficult to do so.\u201d A small group also staged a protest outside the Utica Police station Saturday night. One protester\u2019s sign reads \u201cJustice for Nyah Mway.

{"id": "2024_06_30_business_boeing-plea-deal", "text": "The US Justice Department is nearing an agreement with Boeing that would include a corporate monitor and a fine in exchange for a guilty plea to criminal charges, according to lawyers representing the families of victims of two fatal 737 Max crashes, who harshly rebuked the offer as a \u201csweetheart deal.\u201d The criminal charges and potential plea deal come after repeated safety failures at Boeing that have resulted in multiple federal investigations and a sharp rebuke from airlines, customers, lawmakers and regulators. Criminal charges against a major corporation like Boeing are rare and would represent a serious blow to the company\u2019s already\u00a0precarious financial situation\u00a0and further damage its\u00a0battered reputation. But the victims\u2019 families said they were furious that Boeing may avoid trial, saying the government is letting the company off the hook for the deaths of their loved ones. \u201cI can tell you that the families are very unhappy and angered with DOJ\u2019s decisions and proposal,\u201d said Robert Clifford, lead counsel in the civil litigation against Boeing, in a statement. \u201cThere is no accountability, no admission that Boeing\u2019s admitted crime caused the 346 deaths, and the families will most certainly object before Judge Reed O\u2019Connor and ask that he reject the plea if Boeing accepts.\u201d Clifford and Paul Cassell represent many family members of the 2018 Lion Air crash and\u00a02019 Ethiopian Air crash\u00a0victims of Boeing 737 Max jets. They and some of the families they represent were briefed by the Justice Department Sunday about the plea deal. The deal would include three years of probation, a \u201csmall\u201d fine and and a monitor to ensure safety compliance, Cassell told CNN. Other specific terms of the proposed offer were not immediately known, and CNN has not reviewed the proposal first-hand. Bloomberg first reported the potential plea deal Sunday. Boeing declined to comment, and the Department of Justice did not respond to a request for comment. Violating Boeing\u2019s previous agreement Last month, the Justice Department notified Boeing that its recent string of safety failures and production problems constituted a breach of the terms of\u00a0its\u00a02021 agreement in which the company avoided criminal charges for two fatal 737 Max crashes. A\u00a0door plug blew off an Alaska Airlines flight\u00a0shortly after takeoff in January, and the investigations that followed revealed a series of quality errors and safety gaps. As a result, the Department of Justice said Boeing is subject to criminal prosecution, but it has not publicly announced its decision about whether it will prosecute the case. Last week, prosecutors urged the Justice Department to file criminal charges. Boeing will have by the end of the week to determine whether to accept the plea deal or go to trial. The deadline for the Justice Department to file criminal charges in the case is July 7. Cassell said the families were upset that the Justice Department deal excluded the prosecution of individuals at Boeing. \u201cThe deal will not acknowledge, in any way, that Boeing\u2019s crime killed 346 people.\u00a0It also appears to rest on the idea that Boeing did not harm any victim,\u201d Cassell said in a statement. Although the Justice Department acknowledged the families\u2019 strong desire to take Boeing\u2019s criminal case to trial, the families\u2019 lawyers said the Department of Justice feared it would be unable to prove the charges beyond a reasonable doubt \u2014 the higher standard of proof necessary for a conviction in a criminal trial. A broken safety culture More than a dozen whistleblowers have come forward against Boeing in recent years, and the number has grown substantially since the\u00a0door plug incident in January. Last week, for example, a whistleblower from a contractor for Spirit Aerosystems, a Boeing manufacturing partner, said he notified the company of wide gaps in a key part of 787 Dreamliner planes that posed \u201ccatastrophic\u201d danger to passengers. As part of its plan to shore up its safety program, Boeing said it was looking to repurchase Spirit to bring manufacturing of its planes fully in house. Boeing spun off Spirit in 2005. Boeing and Spirit reportedly came to terms on a deal Sunday, according to Reuters, but the deal has not been publicly disclosed and Boeing declined to comment to CNN. The Federal Aviation Administration and the National Transportation Safety Board have opened multiple investigations into Boeing because of its ongoing quality and safety failures. The FAA has said a\u00a0six-week audit of Boeing\u2019s facilities\u00a0conducted in the late winter found multiple problems with Boeing\u2019s production practices. A separate\u00a0report\u00a0found \u201cgaps\u201d in Boeing\u2019s safety culture, including a disconnect between management and employees, and fears among employees about retaliation for reporting safety concerns. Boeing\u2019s CEO Dave Calhoun earlier this month\u00a0apologized for Boeing\u2019s recent safety failures\u00a0in testimony delivered to a Senate committee but pushed back on claims the company retaliated against those who brought safety issues to light. Calhoun said Boeing is \u201cfar from perfect,\u201d and acknowledged the company will not easily regain the public\u2019s trust.

{"id": "2024_06_27_us_oklahoma-schools-bible-curriculum", "text": "All Oklahoma schools are required to incorporate the Bible and the Ten Commandments in their curriculums, effective immediately, the state\u2019s chief education officer announced in a memorandum Thursday. At a State Board of Education meeting, Oklahoma State Superintendent\u00a0of Public Instruction Ryan Walters said the Bible is \u201cone of the most foundational documents used for the Constitution and the birth of our country.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s crystal clear to us that in the Oklahoma academic standards under Title 70 on multiple occasions, the Bible is a necessary historical document to teach our kids about the history of this country, to have a complete understanding of Western civilization, to have an understanding of the basis of our legal system,\u201d Walters said. Every classroom in the state from grades 5 through 12 must have a Bible and all teachers must teach from the Bible in the classroom, Walters said. The Oklahoma memorandum follows a law in Louisiana passed\u00a0June 19,\u00a0that\u00a0requires\u00a0all public classrooms to display the Ten Commandments. A group of Louisiana parents and civil rights organizations are\u00a0suing\u00a0the state over the new law, contending the legislation violates both US Supreme Court precedent and the First Amendment. Oklahoma\u2019s directive \u201cis in alignment with the educational standards approved on or about May 2019, with which all districts must comply,\u201d according to a news release. \u201cThe Bible is an indispensable historical and cultural touchstone,\u201d Walters said in the release. \u201cWithout basic knowledge of it, Oklahoma students are unable to properly contextualize the foundation of our nation. This is not merely an educational directive but a crucial step in ensuring our students grasp the core values and historical context of our country.\u201d Interfaith Alliance, a national organization that seeks to protect religious freedoms, told CNN in a statement Thursday: \u201cThis is blatant religious coercion that should have absolutely no place in public schools \u2013 in Oklahoma or any other state.\u201d \u201cTrue religious freedom means ensuring that no one religious group is allowed to impose their viewpoint on all Americans. The vast majority of people of faith in this country reject these dangerous, intimidating efforts to force a Christian nationalist agenda into our schools, our courts and our government,\u201d the statement said. The new memo comes after the Oklahoma Supreme Court blocked an effort to establish the first publicly funded religious charter school in the country. The court on Tuesday ordered the state to rescind its contract with\u00a0St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School\u00a0in a 6-2 decision with one recusal. \u201cUnder Oklahoma law, a charter school is a public school,\u201d wrote Justice James R. Winchester for the court. \u201cAs such, a charter school must be nonsectarian. However, St. Isidore will evangelize the Catholic faith as part of its school curriculum while sponsored by the State.\u201d Walters called the ruling \u201cone of the worst\u201d decisions the state Supreme Court has made and pledged to \u201cfight back.\u201d \u201cWhat the court did was rule against the parents of Oklahoma who have demanded more choices for their kids. We have a great opportunity to make sure that parents have the most options of any parents in the country here in Oklahoma, by giving them the ability to go to a public school, charter schools, private schools, this would have been the most unique charter school in the country,\u201d Walters said. \u201cSo I want you all to know, we will continue to fight back against this, we want to continue to provide an opportunity for parents to send their kids to high-quality schools.\u201d The American Civil Liberties Union applauded the decision, saying, \u201cCharter schools are public schools that must be secular and serve all students. St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School, which plans to discriminate against students, families, and staff and indoctrinate students into one religion, cannot operate as a public charter school.\u201d This is a developing story and will be updated.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/27/us/oklahoma-schools-bible-curriculum/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/01/2024", "section": "us"}}

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints youth group from Salina was hiking in the eastern part of Sevier County when it began to rain around 1:45 p.m., the Sevier County Sherrif\u2019s Office said. Lightning then struck the ground next to the group as water puddled on the ground from the light rainstorm, according to the office. Approximately 50 youth group members \u201cfelt the shock of the lightning,\u201d with seven of them having medical concerns \u201cdue to the electrocution,\u201d the sheriff\u2019s office said. They were taken to Salina by ambulances and were \u201ctriaged for their symptoms.\u201d Two of them were experiencing serious symptoms and were flown to a children\u2019s hospital in Lehi. The five others were taken to two hospitals in Gunnison and Richfield. None of the injuries are expected to be life-threatening, according to the sheriff\u2019s office.

Until the film\u2019s release on June 16, domestic sales had been lagging more than 25% behind 2023\u2019s performance, according to Comscore data. \u201cOver the past few weeks, we\u2019ve seen the year-to-date, year-over-year domestic box office revenue deficit shrink from 27% to 19% and that\u2019s due in large part to the amazing and much welcome performance of \u2018Inside Out 2,\u2019 a film that has adjusted the mood of the movie industry in just a few short weeks,\u201d said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at Comscore. The movie is the highest grossing film of the year, and the first to pass $1 billion since \u201cBarbie,\u201d which came out last July. It also joins the ranks of eight other Disney and Pixar movies grossing more than a $1 billion, including \u201cThe Incredibles 2,\u201d \u201cFinding Dory,\u201d both \u201cFrozen\u201d movies and the final two \u201cToy Story\u201d installments. Daniel Loria, editorial director at Box Office Pro, which collects sales and showtime\u00a0data from thousands of movie theaters across the United States, projects this year will see an overall domestic box office total between $8.1 billion and $8.4 billion, down from 2023\u2019s total of more than $9 billion, the highest since the pandemic. But Loria notes it is still possible to close the gap further. \u201cThe impact of the strike on the box office is clear in the first five months of the year, but June has shown us the crucial role movie theaters play in a film industry firing on all cylinders,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cIf the movies are there, the audience will follow. I expect to see great numbers in the second half of the year, leading into 2025 and beyond. Another surprise hit or two, and we may get a lot closer\u00a0to matching that $9 billion than we all expected coming into the year.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/30/business/inside-out-2-global-box-office/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/01/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_28_us_parkland-school-shooting-nikolas-cruz-anthony-borges", "text": "A survivor of the 2018 shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, now owns the rights to the gunman\u2019s name, according to a new settlement agreement that also stipulates the shooter must donate his brain for scientific study. As part of the settlement, the shooter agreed to transfer the rights to his name, Nikolas Cruz, for use in any production, movie, book, television, cable TV, or other media. The gunman,\u00a0who is serving a life sentence\u00a0without the possibility of parole, is barred from giving any interviews without the express written consent of shooting survivor Anthony Borges, according to the settlement. The gunman, who no longer has legal representation, declined to have an attorney review the settlement, Borges\u2019 attorney Alex Arreaza said. Borges was shot five times during the February 14, 2018, massacre that left 17 students and staff members dead. At 15 years old, he was the most gravely wounded of the 17 shooting survivors. Borges,\u00a0who barricaded a door with his body, suffered extensive injuries to his legs and torso, including the removal of a third of his lung. He spent weeks in the hospital recovering. Borges settled his civil lawsuit with the shooter weeks before the case was scheduled for trial next month. \u201cWe wanted complete accountability,\u201d Arreaza told CNN. \u201cPeople sit in prison and don\u2019t have things to do. They get bored. We wanted to shut him down completely. His story will be told by the victims, not by him.\u201d The settlement prevents the gunman from talking to the media or making money by telling his story. \u201cIt took a lot to coordinate all that,\u201d Arreaza said. \u201cOur objective was to get closure for Anthony and his family.\u201d The settlement is similar to the \u201cSon of Sam\u00a0law\u201d passed in New York in the 1970s after the conviction of serial killer David Berkowitz. The law prevents criminals from profiting from books or shows about their crimes by allowing states to seize any proceeds and use them to compensate victims\u2019 families. Similar laws have been invoked many times, but in 1991 the US Supreme Court ruled that they infringed on First Amendment rights. \u201cAnthony doesn\u2019t want to walk in his house one day and see a Netflix special that (the gunman) was talking about his thoughts on what he did,\u201d Arreaza said. \u201cThis was a way we could shut it down. Anthony ultimately has control.\u201d Arreaza said he is not worried about enforcing the settlement, now or in the future. \u201cIf (the shooter) goes to give an interview now, he might be able to slip one under the wire,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we\u2019re going to have the power to go back into court and shut him down. He will be more trouble ten years from now when he starts getting bored.\u201d The settlement also requires the gunman to donate his body, including his brain, to science. According to court documents, \u201c(the shooter) agrees to participate in any scientific, physiological, psychological and/or anthropological study and upon death agrees that his physical body, including all organs and brain, will be donated to an institution of Anthony Borges\u2019 choosing for scientific study in an effort to help prevent such tragic events from ever happening again.\u201d \u201cHopefully, you can find something from that and prevent future incidents,\u201d Arreaza said. \u201cMaybe something can help, but it won\u2019t happen unless it\u2019s studied.\u201d The gunman agreed to the settlement terms during a Zoom call. Borges did not participate, but his father did. Court documents show the gunman also agreed to assign any financial interest in any insurance policies he stands to benefit from to Borges. The shooter was named as the beneficiary in at least one insurance policy from his adoptive mother, estimated at\u00a0$430,000. This is not the first civil settlement reached in the Marjory Stoneman Douglas shooting. In 2021, the Broward County Public School District paid\u00a0more than $26 million\u00a0to the shooting victims and families of the 17 people killed. Borges received $1.25 million. There are still pending civil lawsuits against former School Resource Officer Scot Peterson and the Broward County Sheriff\u2019s Office. More than six years after the shooting, Borges, now 21, is working to move on with his life. He still lives in South Florida and testified in the shooter\u2019s trial in 2022 and Peterson\u2019s criminal trial last year. Peterson was acquitted of criminal charges for failing to confront the gunman. Borges\u2019 family did not want him to endure another trial, so they sought a settlement. \u201cHe\u2019s healed physically, but the PTSD is still a real problem,\u201d Arreaza said. \u201cWe were concerned that the trial and everything that comes with it would push him back further.\u201d Before the shooting, Borges planned to play soccer professionally in Brazil. That won\u2019t happen now due to the severity of his injuries. He moved to a new city in South Florida, and Arreaza said he was glad that the 1200 Building on the high school\u2019s campus was being demolished. \u201cEvery time he drove by there, it brought back memories,\u201d Arreaza said. \u201cHe could just hear things in his head. He\u2019s very glad to see it torn down.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/28/us/parkland-school-shooting-nikolas-cruz-anthony-borges/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/01/2024", "section": "us"}}

More than 190 defendants, including 76 doctors, nurse practitioners and other licensed medical professionals, were charged over two weeks in federal courts across the country, according to the Justice Department, and the government has seized more than $231 million in cash, luxury vehicles, gold and other assets. \u201cIt does not matter if you are a trafficker in a drug cartel or a corporate executive or medical professional employed by a health care company, if you profit from the unlawful distribution of controlled substances, you will be held accountable,\u201d Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a news conference Thursday.

{"id": "2024_06_27_us_karen-read-john-okeefe-what-we-know", "text": "The closely watched murder trial of Karen Read is nearing its end as Massachusetts jurors deliberate her fate while her supporters rally in her defense outside court. So how did we get here? Read, 45, has pleaded not guilty to charges of second-degree murder, vehicular manslaughter while intoxicated, and leaving the scene of a collision resulting in death. The case stems from the death of her boyfriend, Boston Police Officer John O\u2019Keefe, whose body was found bruised and battered in the snow on January 29, 2022, outside the home of a fellow Boston police officer in the suburb of Canton. The trial began in April and has garnered interest as it featured accusations of a police cover-up, sexist and offensive texts from the lead investigator, a federal probe into the investigation, and groups of pink-wearing supporters chanting to \u201cFree Karen Read.\u201d Here\u2019s a review of what we know about the case. The death of John O\u2019Keefe The heart of the trial stems from what happened on one wintry evening in Canton over two years ago. On the night of January 28, 2022, Read and O\u2019Keefe went out drinking at two bars with friends. Shortly after midnight, the couple climbed into Read\u2019s SUV and drove to the home of O\u2019Keefe\u2019s colleague on Fairview Road for an after-party, court documents show. O\u2019Keefe got out of the vehicle, and Read drove home. Early the next morning, she drove around in a snowstorm to look for him and found his body in the front yard of the Canton house, according to court documents. What exactly happened to O\u2019Keefe between getting out of the vehicle and when he was found the next morning? The prosecution has alleged the couple got into an argument that led O\u2019Keefe to get out of the vehicle, but he never made it inside the house. A drunken Read allegedly struck him with the vehicle while driving in reverse and then fled, leaving him to die in the snowy cold, prosecutors say. Firefighters who responded to the scene that morning asked about his injuries, and Read told them, \u201cI hit him, I hit him,\u201d according to their testimony. People at the house that night testified O\u2019Keefe never came inside. In addition, Read\u2019s vehicle had a broken taillight, and pieces of the taillight were found outside the Canton home, prosecutors said. Data from the vehicle\u2019s internal system also indicated she reversed at a rapid speed, according to testimony. \u201cWhat the constellation of the facts and the evidence ineluctably demonstrate here is that the defendant drove her vehicle in reverse at 24.2 miles per hour for 62.5 feet, struck Mr. O\u2019Keefe, causing those catastrophic head injuries, leaving him incapacitated and freezing him to death,\u201d prosecutor Adam Lally said in closing arguments Tuesday. However, Read has said she dropped off O\u2019Keefe at the house and then drove to his home because she wasn\u2019t feeling well, according to court documents. Her defense has accused\u00a0off-duty police inside that Canton home of killing O\u2019Keefe and framing Read. The defense has theorized O\u2019Keefe was beaten in the home and mauled by the homeowners\u2019 German shepherd, Chloe, and then tossed out in the snow to die. The police then conspired to fabricate evidence and lie under oath to protect their own, the defense alleged. \u201cLadies and gentlemen, there was a cover-up in this case, plain and simple,\u201d defense attorney Alan Jackson said. \u201cYou\u2019ll surely say to yourself, \u2018I don\u2019t want to believe it, I don\u2019t want to believe that could happen in our community,\u2019 but sadly over these past eight weeks you\u2019ve seen it right before your eyes.\u201d Lead investigator apologizes for offensive texts The prosecution\u2019s case also has been hampered by a series of missteps and unusual investigative practices. Most notably, a lead investigator in the case, Massachusetts State Police Trooper Michael Proctor, admitted that he sent a series of sexist and offensive texts about Read in a private group chat, calling her a \u201cwhack job,\u201d mocking her medical issues and commenting to coworkers that he had found \u201cno nudes\u201d while searching her phone for evidence,\u00a0CNN affiliate WCVB reported. Proctor apologized on the stand for the \u201cunprofessional\u201d comments, but the vulgar texts have been sharply criticized in and out of court, including from the governor. \u201cIt\u2019s completely unprofessional,\u201d Gov.\u00a0Maura Healey told WCVB of the texts. \u201cIt does harm, frankly, to the dignity and the integrity of the work of men and women across the state police and law enforcement. So as a former attorney general and as governor, I am disgusted by that.\u201d At closing arguments, the prosecution condemned the texts as \u201cunprofessional, indefensible, (and) inexcusable\u201d but said they had no impact on the integrity of the investigation. The defense disagreed. \u201cThey cannot distance themselves from the stench of him on this case and this investigation. Those secret group chats illustrate the quality and care of this investigation,\u201d Jackson said. The US Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of Massachusetts has launched a federal probe into Read\u2019s arrest and prosecution. And in March, the Massachusetts State Police announced an\u00a0investigation into Proctor for potential policy violations. The prosecution has presented evidence that Read and O\u2019Keefe had a volatile relationship. O\u2019Keefe\u2019s niece and nephew said they heard the couple yelling in arguments prior to his death, and an ATF agent testified about his romantic kiss and text messages with Read, according to\u00a0WCVB. Further, in the minutes after prosecutors say she hit him with the SUV, she called his phone and left a voicemail yelling, \u201cJohn, I f**king hate you!\u201d The defense has sharply questioned witnesses about whether Read truly confessed to hitting him with her vehicle and has challenged investigators about the quality of their work. For example, investigators used red plastic cups to collect evidence from the scene, and surveillance video of Read\u2019s vehicle was inexplicably flipped to a mirror image, WCVB reported. \u201cLie, obfuscate, manipulate, alter, and when they\u2019re caught, they just excuse it away,\u201d Jackson said in closing arguments. \u201cThat\u2019s not sloppiness,\u201d he added. \u201cThat\u2019s evidence manipulation.\u201d But prosecutors have rejected those theories as nothing more than speculation. \u201cThere is no conspiracy, there is no cover-up, there is no evidence of any of that beyond speculation, rampant speculation and conjecture on behalf of the defense,\u201d Lally said in closing arguments. The case has divided a small town The accusations of a cover-up and high stakes of the trial have spilled over to local residents and divided the town. Aidan Kearney, a Massachusetts blogger nicknamed Turtleboy, has fed the ongoing debate with numerous posts alleging a cover-up by law enforcement and local politicians. In October, he pleaded not guilty to charges of witness intimidation and conspiracy, CNN affiliate WBZ reported, after he allegedly called and sent messages to witnesses and investigators in Read\u2019s case. Near the courthouse, dozens of people have gathered daily to support Read and offered their approval of her defense\u2019s accusations that she was framed. Wearing pink in solidarity, they have held signs reading \u201cFree Karen Read\u201d and waved American flags. Police have set up a buffer zone to keep them from being too close to the courthouse. Rita Lombardi, a local Read supporter outside the court, told CNN on Thursday she got into the case by following Turtleboy\u2019s work. \u201cThe information in the court filings didn\u2019t add up,\u201d she said. \u201cThis woman was framed, and there is overwhelming evidence, overwhelming scientific evidence that she was framed for murder by the very people we trust to protect us.\u201d \u201cWe are not protesters, we are supporters,\u201d she added. \u201cWe bring love, we bring joy, we bring hope, compassion.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/27/us/karen-read-john-okeefe-what-we-know/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/01/2024", "section": "us"}}

{"id": "2024_06_30_us_uvalde-school-shooting-police-indictments", "text": "More than two years after the massacre at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde left 19 children and 2 teachers dead, a grand jury indicted two former Uvalde school police officers in the botched law enforcement response to the 2022 mass shooting. Former Uvalde Consolidated Independent School District Police Chief Pete Arredondo and former school police officer Adrian Gonzales were named in the indictments, which represent the first criminal charges filed in the school shooting. The victims\u2019 families, who have been fighting for years in search of answers as to why the shooter was left for 77 minutes \u2013 with dead, dying and traumatized victims \u2013 before he was stopped, are still shattered, heartbroken and grieving. \u201cWe still drown in sadness, there\u2019s still a whole lot of anger because these men have walked around for the last two years, one month and four days, walking around like they didn\u2019t do anything wrong,\u201d Brett Cross, the uncle and guardian of victim Uziyah Garcia, 10, told CNN. Arredondo and Gonzales were among the 376 law enforcement officers who arrived at the school, and it took them more than an hour to confront and kill the teenage shooter from the time he entered the school through an unlocked door. The response to the attack\u00a0has been denounced as an \u201cabject failure\u201d with\u00a0enough blame to be spread widely. Families are now struggling with mixed emotions. The indictments provided a small measure of hope in their quest for accountability but with only two officers facing charges, they said it is far from enough. \u201cI think these indictments, taking these officers off of the streets so they\u2019re never in the position to put others in danger again, that\u2019s a win for the community, for Texas,\u201d Kimberly Mata-Rubio, the mother of victim Lexi Rubio, 10, told CNN. \u201cAs for the families of victims, nothing will ever change what happened. What we want most we can\u2019t have, we want our children and those two teachers back.\u201d What\u2019s next? Here are answers to some of the biggest questions. Who was indicted? What were the charges? Former Uvalde Consolidated Independent School District Police Chief Pete Arredondo\u00a0surrendered to the custody of the Texas Rangers in Uvalde Thursday, an official with the Texas Department of Public Safety told CNN. The former chief was booked on 10 felony charges of child endangerment with known criminal negligence for failing to recognize the incident as an active shooting and for failing to take proper action to intervene, the indictment said. According to the filing, the behaviors placed each of the 10 children listed in \u201cimminent danger of bodily injury, death, physical impairment and mental impairment.\u201d Arredondo was hired by the school district in March 2020 and fired in August 2022 for his role in the highly scrutinized law enforcement response on May 24, 2022. For more than two years, Arredondo\u2019s actions on the day of the shooting have been under scrutiny from the families of victims and survivors, the Uvalde community and in several investigative reports, including one released this year by the U.S. Department of Justice. Arredondo\u2019s lawyer has not responded to CNN\u2019s request for comment. Former school police officer Adrian Gonzales posted bail Friday and was released after being charged with 29 counts of abandoning and endangering a child, the Uvalde County Sheriff said in a news release. Gonzales, who was hired by the school district in July 2021, left the department in February 2023. No specific reason was given for Gonzales\u2019 departure, according to the Uvalde News Leader. Gonzales was booked into the Uvalde County Jail early Friday afternoon, the Uvalde Leader-News reported, citing Uvalde County Sheriff\u2019s Office Chief Deputy Brandon McCutchen. Jail records show both Arredondo and Gonzales were released on $10,000 bond. What do the indictments say about the officers? The indictment listed Gonzales as one of the responders to the scene, something Mata-Rubio said she did not previously know. \u201cAs far as Adrian, it was not a name that was on my\u00a0radar, and I was unaware of the details of his part on that date,\u201d said Mata-Rubio. \u201cTwenty-one people could have gone home that day had Adrian Gonzales done his job.\u201d \u201cAfter hearing gun shots and after being advised of the general location of the shooter and having time to respond to the shooter, the said Adrian Gonzales failed to engage, distract or delay the shooter to attempt to engage, distract and delay the shooter, and failed to otherwise act in a way to impede the shooter until after the shooter entered rooms 111 and 112 of Robb Elementary School and shot at a child or children in Rooms 111 and 112,\u201d the indictment states, with the allegation repeated for each of\u00a0the\u00a019 children killed and 10 surviving children. The indictment also said Gonzales failed to \u201cfollow his active shooter training\u201d in his response. \u201cMr. Gonzales\u2019 position is he did not violate school district policy or state law,\u201d defense attorney Nico LaHood told CNN Friday. \u201cThe application of this statute, to law enforcement, under these circumstances is unprecedented in the state of Texas. It will take time to evaluate these allegations and the underlying facts.\u201d The indictment also alleges Arredondo \u201cfailed to respond as trained to an active shooter incident\u201d and delayed the response by law enforcement to stop the gunman \u201cwho was hunting and shooting\u201d children inside the classroom. Are more indictments expected? The Uvalde County District Attorney\u2019s office is not planning to file any more indictments in the botched response to the shooting, according to family members who have spoken to District Attorney Christina Mitchell. Mata-Rubio and Cross told CNN they were informed by Mitchell there would be no further indictments coming out of the grand jury. The district attorney\u2019s office did not respond to CNN\u2019s multiple requests for comment. \u201cI\u2019m glad two people are indicted,\u201d Mata-Rubio told CNN Friday. \u201cIt\u2019s not justice until there are convictions. But I am also aware that there were others at fault that day, and it\u2019s hard to accept that they will not face any consequences.\u201d \u201cI would be lying if I didn\u2019t say I feel like that\u2019s not enough,\u201d Cross told CNN. \u201cAlthough to be perfectly honest, it will never be enough, because even if all 376 officers get charged, my son\u2019s still not here.\u201d What has been the reaction from local officials and police? The Uvalde Police Department released a statement on Facebook saying they are aware of the news regarding the two indictments. \u201cOur administration has not been contacted by the District Attorney\u2019s Office regarding any of our staff and we don\u2019t have any comment at this time regarding the matter,\u201d their statement read. \u201cWe have no other information on the matter outside of what has been reported.\u201d The Uvalde Consolidated Independent School District offered its condolences to the families of the victims Friday, saying it had no further information to add. \u201cAs with the rest of the Uvalde community, we have only just learned about the grand jury decision regarding two indictments being issued,\u201d school district spokeswoman Anne Marie Espinoza said in a statement. How about the reaction from families? Mata-Rubio, wearing a blue shirt reading \u201cI\u2019m not a regular mom, I\u2019m Lexi\u2019s mom,\u201d said she was \u201cglad\u201d to hear about the indictments but was frustrated state police, or the Texas Department of Public Safety, were not included in the indictments. \u201cWhen they go to a scene, they know they\u2019re in charge, they know that they could have taken over. They chose not to and this was the result,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cThere\u2019s the part of me that is Lexi\u2019s mom as a grieving mother that will never understand any of this. Then there\u2019s the logical part of me that realizes that in order to get justice, some sort of justice, this is the route the DA had to go.\u201d State Sen. Roland Gutierrez also told CNN Thursday he believes the Texas Department of Public Safety bears substantial responsibility for the failed law enforcement response and should have been included in the indictments. Nikki Cross, Brett Cross\u2019 wife and the guardian of victim Uziyah Garcia, said she is disappointed the acting City of Uvalde Police Chief Mariano Pargas was not included in the indictments. \u201cUnfortunately, cowardness is just not against the law apparently, even if you have a badge,\u201d Cross said. \u201cI do just hope maybe after these two officers and all testimony is out there, maybe we can come back to charges against him.\u201d CNN has reached out to the Texas Department of Public Safety and Pargas for comment. Both Nikki and Brett Cross are trying to remain optimistic about the outcome of the expected trials but hope officials stay on top of the case and do not \u201clet this just fall through because it\u2019s the state of Texas and they back the blue.\u201d \u201cThis isn\u2019t a matter of \u2018Oh, we ride the thin blue line\u2019 or \u2018We need to respect cops because they put lives on the line.\u2019 They showed us that not all cops put their lives on the line and when they actively chose to put their lives above our children when they signed up to serve and protect, you negate everything at that point,\u201d Brett Cross said. Oscar Orona, father of survivor Noah Orona, now 12, said while he was pleasantly surprised by the indictments, his top priority continues to be the health of his son, who was shot in the massacre. \u201cToday was a big day, don\u2019t get me wrong and I\u2019m not trying to minimize that,\u201d Orona said. \u201cBut in the end, our foremost goal is our son\u2019s well-being now, tomorrow, and years to come because that\u2019s gonna be the true battle right there.\u201d Jesse Rizo, the uncle of one of the students killed, Jacklyn Cazares, 9, echoed the other parents in their hopes more law enforcement officials would be facing with criminal charges, he told CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s the beginning of something, right?\u201d Rizo said. \u201cBut in order to bring closure, you would want all the officers that didn\u2019t do their job that day, that failed to respond appropriately, you would want them to be held accountable in an equal way.\u201d Will they be tried separately? It is not yet clear if Arredondo or Gonzales will be tried separately or together. Where will the trials be held? Families who spoke with the district attorney told CNN Mitchell will not push for a change of venue in this case and intends to hold the trial in Uvalde. Victim Uziyah Garcia\u2019s guardians, Nikki and Brett Cross, voiced their apprehension and said they have little confidence with the trial being held in Uvalde due to the negative response they have received from some community members. \u201cThis is the same community that has driven by when we\u2019ve been doing sit-outs telling us to die,\u201d Brett Cross told CNN. \u201cSame community that blames us, that tells us to move on, that tells us that we\u2019re wrong, this is the same community that shows up for a superintendent who didn\u2019t do anything but won\u2019t show up when 19 children and two teachers are killed.\u201d Do we know when the trials start? Right now, there\u2019s no date set for Arredondo or Gonzales\u2019 first court appearances, an official with the Uvalde County District Court clerk\u2019s office said. Brett Cross said the district attorney indicated it could be months or even up to a year before the case goes to trial because of the amount of evidence and investigative material to be handed over to the defense. \u201cNow that they\u2019ve been indicted, you know, their lawyers will have a chance to go through evidence and everything and we saw that it took this long for the prosecution to go through evidence,\u201d Cross said. \u201cSo I\u2019m expecting a lengthy time where the defense goes through it.\u201d What type of punishment do the former police officers face? Each defendant could face jail time of six months to two years and a fine of up to $10,000 for each count, according to state sentencing guidelines. What\u2019s next for grieving families? The world will never be the same for the families and friends of the children and teachers who were murdered. Although nothing can bring them back or fill the holes they left behind, their loved ones said they will not stop fighting for them, regardless of how the trials go. \u201cThere\u2019s more than one avenue for justice and accountability. If we\u2019re able to change laws that save lives, then that\u2019s even more justice for Uziyah,\u201d Brett Cross said. Many of the families have become outspoken advocates for gun reform, demanding their state enact sensible gun laws to prevent similar future tragedies. \u201cI want to see convictions, at the local level also at the state level and at the federal level, calling for gun reform through work at LivesRobbed, I\u2019m never going to stop fighting for her, for all the children.\u201d Mata-Rubio said. \u201cEarly on I stood at the downtown plaza and I said that what I wanted is my daughter, and if I can\u2019t have that, then those who failed her will never know peace and I stand by that.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/30/us/uvalde-school-shooting-police-indictments/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/01/2024", "section": "us"}}

Democratic fundraiser and strategist Dmitri Mehlhorn, who often works closely with LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, another prominent donor, told CNN that while the first 10 or 15 minutes of the debate \u201cwas very upsetting to see,\u201d\u00a0Biden\u2019s performance later in Atlanta and then at a high-energy rally on Friday in North Carolina had begun to settle his nerves. In any event, he reasoned, Biden alone controlled his fate as the Democratic nominee. \u201cThe smartest thing is to think through how you (as influential outsiders) operate, assuming no change,\u201d Mehlhorn said. \u201cAnd if there\u2019s no change, if Biden wants to remain president, then any kind of a pressure campaign is just a waste of time and energy and effort and money.\u201d A third group of donors and advisers, with fewer direct ties to Biden world and less influence within it, is proactively calling on Democrats to quit wasting time and immediately begin the process of seeking out a new nominee with a little more than four months before a general election clash with former President Donald Trump. The would-be favorites to step in for Biden, should he reverse course and leave the race, have been careful to pledge their support to the president and, as California Gov. Gavin Newsom has done, get out-front defending him. \u201cAll this other talk \u2026 it\u2019s unhelpful and unnecessary. We aren\u2019t going to turn our backs because of one performance,\u201d Newsom said in an email to supporters on Friday. \u201cWhat kind of party does that?\u201d As the Biden campaign conducts extensive research in battleground states about the president\u2019s standing, other leading Democrats have been less inclined to circle the wagons \u2014 instead warning that the party is doomed to defeat if it does not act decisively to change the equation. Former Iowa Sen. Tom Harkin, who served alongside Biden in the Senate for decades, sought to set the tone in a pointed letter he dashed off to friends after the debate. \u201cAll incumbent Democratic Senators should write to Biden asking him to release his delegates and step aside so the convention can choose a new candidate,\u201d Harkin wrote in the letter, a copy of which was obtained by CNN. \u201cA couple of Governors may need to do the same.\u201d Harkin said there was still time for a course correction and a new Democratic ticket, which he believes \u201cwould energize the party at all levels and capture the general public\u2019s attention \u2014 many of whom would like an alternative to Trump.\u201d \u201cThis is a perilous time and is more important than Joe Biden\u2019s ego,\u201d Harkin wrote, \u201cor desire to stay president.\u201d There does seem to be agreement among all sides over one thing: Ultimately, the decision will be Biden\u2019s to make. There is no appetite for a clash at the Democratic National Convention this summer in Chicago \u2014 partly because there is no clear apparatus for pushing Biden aside, but mostly due to concerns that a floor fight, no matter the outcome, would do more harm than good. \u201cThe party is in President Biden\u2019s hands \u2014 for better or worse,\u201d a Democratic senator told CNN, speaking on condition of anonymity to avoid disrespecting the president or alienating the campaign. \u201cHe deserves our respect and space to reach any decision.\u201d The absence of an heir apparent to Biden who could satisfy the party\u2019s perpetually warring factions while quickly bringing together competing donor networks is another significant hurdle for those pushing for immediate action. \u201cA true succession plan does not exist,\u201d a senior Democratic adviser to the Biden campaign told CNN on Saturday. \u201cThat\u2019s what makes all of this not just heartbreaking, but very problematic.\u201d Democrats are conducting new polls and research, throughout the weekend and into early next week, in an effort to gain a better understanding of the political fallout, particularly in key contests that will determine whether the party can win back its House majority and maintain its narrow control of the Senate. A second longtime adviser said the only way Biden would even consider stepping aside \u2014 a move that is still very much an open question \u2014 is if he was presented serious data showing that he would not only likely lose his reelection bid, but also endanger down-ballot candidates in House, Senate and competitive local races across the country. The Biden campaign has long had polling that found Democrats would still support those candidates even if they didn\u2019t vote for Biden. If the president\u2019s debate setback would make some of these voters far less inclined to vote at all \u2014 handing a turnout advantage to Trump and Republicans \u2014 Biden could be confronted with a starker decision. Without that information, for now, the most prominent national Democrats, led by former President Barack Obama, are asking party donors to keep the faith. For years, the relationship between Obama and Biden and their circle of advisers was strained by Obama\u2019s decision to support Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential bid in 2015 and urge Biden not to run. This moment \u201cis even more fraught,\u201d one longtime Obama adviser said Saturday, noting that Biden would have to ultimately reach \u201cany decision about his next steps on his own.\u201d At a fundraiser for House Democrats on New York City\u2019s Upper West Side late Friday, Obama did not take questions from donors in the audience as he spoke with House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries in what Florida Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, who was in attendance, told CNN was more like a \u201cfireside chat.\u201d The former president, as he did in a social media post earlier in the day, recounted to attendees his own dismal debate experience from 2012, repeated a message about the stark contrast between the two presidential candidates and said Biden\u2019s values \u201creflect the best in America.\u201d Asked about the debate by Jeffries, Obama pivoted to a more expansive view of the situation. \u201cAn appropriate message for\u00a0this evening\u00a0is that this is a team sport. The president is captain, and we need the White House, because of the enormous power of the executive branch,\u201d Obama said. \u201cBut the critical need for us to regain the House and have Hakeem Jeffries as speaker should be sufficient motivation. And if we do our jobs on that front, that is probably the most important thing we can do for the Biden reelection campaign as well.\u201d But signs \u2014 literally \u2014 of dissent have been more prominent outside the fundraising circuit. When Biden arrived at hedge fund manager Rosenstein\u2019s event in East Hampton, New York, on Saturday, his motorcade passed a group of people holding signs appealing for the president to drop out. \u201cWe love you,\u201d one said, \u201cbut it\u2019s time.\u201d Once inside, Biden acknowledged the angst among the donors. \u201cI understand the concern about the debate \u2014 I get it,\u201d the president said. \u201cI didn\u2019t have a great night.\u201d But he also pushed back against the some of the concerns voiced in recent reports. \u201cVoters had a different reaction,\u201d Biden said, claiming that post-debate polling showed little movement except for some figures that \u201cmoved us up, actually.\u201d Rosenstein told CNN more than 200 people were expected at the event, which brought in additional donations the Friday morning after the debate. Actors Sarah Jessica Parker and Matthew Broderick were among the hosts, and former Trump communications director Anthony Scaramucci was also on hand. As he made his swing through the Hamptons, Biden was accompanied by Jeffrey Katzenberg, the Hollywood mogul serving as a co-chair of his campaign.\u00a0Biden\u2019s team has tried to point to some fundraising bright spots in the days after the debate, saying the campaign brought in more than $27 million during a two-day period. Biden will be in New Jersey on Saturday night for another fundraiser, this one hosted by wealthy New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy, a former Democratic National Committee finance chair. Those gatherings follow the mixed reviews that emerged from a Friday night event in New York City attended by Biden and headlined by rock \u2018n\u2019 roll legend Elton John. \u201cThe vibe in the room was completely bizarre,\u201d said a Democratic strategist who attended the event. \u201cYou\u2019re having fun and the drinks are flowing, and Elton John was there \u2014 but you\u2019re waiting for the gaffe, you\u2019re waiting for the slip \u2014 magnified by the terror of the night before.\u201d Another donor in the room, Charles Myers, told CNN the panicky narrative around a donor exodus from Biden\u2019s campaign was \u201cfrustrating\u201d and \u201cnot what\u2019s happening.\u201d \u201cYes, donors were nervous after the very bad debate performance,\u201d Myers said, \u201cbut still very much on board and some want to do more.\u201d The gathering in Midtown, he added, saw Biden in \u201cgreat form,\u201d and he had a \u201cgeneral sense\u201d that while the debate \u201cwas really bad \u2026 the campaign is doing a course correction and all of us want to double the effort to help with that turnaround.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s time to do polling and find out if there are any potential replacements that poll higher than Trump,\u201d billionaire businessman\u00a0Mark Cuban, who recently came out in support of Biden, told\u00a0CNN.\u00a0Trump is politically weak, Cuban said, so a Democrat who could\u00a0\u201cstep in and immediately change the race\u201d would be \u201cworth considering.\u201d For now, though, Cuban\u00a0\u2014 who said he is not a donor to the Biden campaign but did attend a fundraiser in March to show his support \u2014\u00a0made clear the task of replacing Biden this late in the cycle would be uniquely challenging. The former majority owner of the Dallas Mavericks basketball team, who previously supported former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley in the GOP primary, used a sports analogy:\u00a0\u201cAt this point, it\u2019s more like discussing an NBA or NFL game after the fact and wanting to trade players,\u201d Cuban said. Hoffman offered a variation on that theme in a Friday night email to friends \u2014 some of whom, he wrote, had been asking him \u201cwhether there should be a public campaign to pressure President Biden to step aside after his (very) bad debate performance last night.\u201d \u201cI think such a campaign to get Biden to step down would be a bad idea,\u201d Hoffman wrote, arguing that such steps might harden Biden\u2019s resolve to prove his doubters wrong. He also pointed to the president\u2019s lively performance at the rally in North Carolina and to the way Republicans reacted following Trump\u2019s felony conviction last month. \u201cThey ruthlessly and immediately closed ranks,\u201d Hoffman wrote, \u201cbecause they understand that at this stage of the race, they must spend every minute and dime either boosting their old man, or tearing down ours.\u201d Another Democratic donor was more blunt about the state of play and the party\u2019s choices. \u201cI don\u2019t think (Biden) is going anywhere,\u201d the donor told CNN. \u201cThis is the old horse we\u2019ve got, and we need to ride him \u2018til he\u2019s ready for the glue factory.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/29/politics/democratic-donors-biden-debate-election/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/01/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "us_new-york-12-year-old-college-trnd", "text": "Recent high school graduate Suborno Isaac Bari, 12, plans to start studying math and physics at New York University in the fall, but he\u2019s already got his ambitious sights set on beginning a doctoral program. \u201cI hope to graduate college at 14 in spring 2026,\u201d said Suborno, who recently became the youngest graduate from his Long Island high school. \u201cIf I ever decide to do a second Ph.D., it will be in physics, but mainly I want to focus on math,\u201d he told CNN. The gifted tween, who memorized the periodic table at 2 years old and has taught lectures at colleges in India since he was 7, graduated on Wednesday from Malverne High School in Nassau County, New York. Suborno, who says he skipped to 12th grade after completing ninth grade studies, became the youngest-ever student to graduate from the high school, CNN affiliate WABC-TV reported. His high school uses a 100-point GPA scale rather than a 4.0 scale, says Suborno, who shared he earned around a 96 GPA for his first year of high school and a 98 for his second and final year. Once he began the 12th grade, Suborno took on nondegree classes at several universities around New York including NYU, Stony Brook University, the City University of New York and Brooklyn College. \u201cThat was a whole new challenge for me,\u201d he shared. \u201cYou\u2019ve got much more homework, much longer classes, (many) more new subjects and material and it\u2019s all condensed into a far shorter time than in school.\u201d The bright young student, whose family says he\u2019s also skilled in painting, debate and playing the piano, could also be making history at NYU when he begins pursuing his bachelor of science degree. A university spokesperson informed the Bari family \u201cwithout NYU undertaking a complete review of its records, NYU is unaware of anyone younger than Suborno being admitted,\u201d according to a copy of an email shared with CNN. Suborno was introduced to education early on by his parents, Rashidul and Shaheda Bari. His father Rashidul teaches physics at Brooklyn Technical High school and his mother Shaheda is an elementary school teacher. They noticed their youngest son was exceptionally bright in 2014 as they taught him basic math, according to Rashidul Bari. \u201cMy wife was actually his teacher at the time. One day \u2026 she was teaching him one plus one, and he would be responding, \u2018Mom, one plus one is two,\u2019\u201d Rashidul Bari said. \u201cAnd then Mom would go, \u2018then what is one plus two?\u2019 And then he\u2019d say \u2018three,\u2019 and then he\u2019d be questioning Mom, \u2018if one plus one is two, can you please tell me, what is n plus n?\u2019\u201d The questions took Shaheda Bari by surprise, her husband says. Rashidul Bari says he at first paid it no mind because his eldest son, Refath Bari, 21, who attends Brown University, was also smart. \u201cSo I told my wife, \u2018OK, there is nothing surprising here, he probably did it to capture attention,\u2019\u201d Rashidul Bari said. \u201cBut it kept happening. Every math concept, he started abstracting.\u201d Suborno\u2019s dad, who was a math student at the time, shared the fascinating discovery with one of his professors. \u201cMy professor said, \u2018no way, a 2-year-old cannot do that abstraction. You should pay serious attention,\u2019\u201d Rashidul Bari said. Suborno continued attracting attention, which eventually led to him getting invited to take college-level courses, his dad said. In 2016, then-President Barack Obama sent Suborno a letter praising the bright student for his hard work and accomplishments. The family shared a copy of the letter with CNN. In 2020 when he was 7, Suborno began receiving invitations from colleges in India to teach, which he does three times a year, his dad says. \u201cThat gives him lots of chances to have conversations with different levels of expertise, students, faculties, college presidents, so many people,\u201d Rashidul Bari said. The family says they were told by Mensa he must wait until he\u2019s 14 years old \u2013 around the time Suborno says he plans to graduate from NYU \u2013 to have his IQ tested. Suborno plans to continue his family\u2019s trend of teaching by one day becoming a math and physics professor. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely insane,\u201d he said about starting at NYU in the fall. \u201cI can\u2019t wait for all the opportunities I\u2019ll have, I\u2019ll be able to meet people who are actually interested \u2026 fully in math and science, and people who are also majoring in math and physics and who want to find out these mysteries behind the universe.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/us/new-york-12-year-old-college-trnd/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/01/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2023_08_08_us_uvalde-shooter-cousin-arrested-threats-nathan-cruz", "text": "The teenage cousin of the gunman responsible for the 2022 Uvalde, Texas, school shooting was arrested Monday on suspicion of threatening to \u201cdo the same thing\u201d to a school, according to court documents obtained by CNN.     Nathan James Cruz, 17, was arrested on a felony charge of making a terroristic threat to a public place and a misdemeanor charge of making a terroristic threat against a family member, according to Bexar County Central Magistrate records.   Cruz is the cousin of Salvador Ramos, the 18-year-old who fatally shot 19 children and two teachers at Robb Elementary School in May 2022, San Antonio police Sgt. Washington Moscoso told the New York Times on Monday.   CNN has sought comment from San Antonio police. Ramos stormed into Robb Elementary last year armed with an assault rifle and tactical vest and opened fire on two adjoining classrooms \u2013 perpetrating one of the deadliest school shootings in modern US history. Law enforcement\u2019s response has been heavily scrutinized, as officers waited outside the classrooms for more than an hour before entering and fatally shooting Ramos.  Cruz\u2019s mother contacted police on Monday after her daughter reported that Cruz said he planned to \u201cdo the same thing\u201d as his cousin, according to an affidavit obtained by CNN.   His mother told investigators she was \u201cespecially concerned because the suspect is currently on probation, was intoxicated at the time\u201d and because the family lives across the street from an elementary school, the affidavit states. Cruz\u2019s sister told investigators that while she was giving her brother a ride, he \u201cthreatened to shoot her in the head and stated he would \u2018shoot the school,\u2019\u201d according to the affidavit. The mother allegedly overheard a phone conversation in which Cruz was attempting to illegally acquire an AR-15-style assault rifle \u2013 the same style used by Ramos to carry out the Uvalde shooting, according to the affidavit. Following his arrest, Cruz \u201cdenied making any threats\u201d when interviewed by a detective, the document states.  CNN has been unable to confirm whether Cruz has an attorney. His charges carry a combined $160,000 bond, according to the magistrate records.
