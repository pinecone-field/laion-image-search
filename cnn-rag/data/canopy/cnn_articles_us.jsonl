Tamayo Perry, 49, was an \u201ceight-year veteran of Honolulu Ocean Safety and well-known North Shore waterman,\u201d Honolulu Mayor Rick Blangiardi said in a statement. Perry \u201cexemplified bravery, commitment and a deep sense of duty, serving our community with unwavering dedication. His heroic actions and tireless efforts to ensure the safety of our residents and visitors will never be forgotten,\u201d Blangiardi added. Just before 1 p.m. Sunday, Honolulu Ocean Safety and other emergency responders arrived at a beach after a call came in about a surfer who\u2019d been fatally injured in a\u00a0shark\u00a0attack, Honolulu Emergency Medical Services spokesperson Shayne Enright\u00a0said. Honolulu Ocean Safety responded by jet ski and brought Perry to shore, where first responders pronounced him dead. Perry was a lifeguard who was loved by all, a professional surfer known worldwide, and had an \u201cinfectious\u201d personality, Honolulu Ocean Safety acting Chief Kurt Lager said. \u201cAs much as people loved him, he loved everyone else more,\u201d Lager said. Perry made several TV and movie appearances, according to his\u00a0IMDB page. Perry\u2019s bio on the Oahu Surfing Experience\u00a0website lists the \u201cPirates of the Caribbean\u201d movie, \u201cCharlie\u2019s Angels 2,\u201d \u201cBlue Crush,\u201d and hit TV shows \u201cLost\u201d and \u201cHawaii Five-0,\u201d among his credits.

Perry\u2019s wife, Emilia Perry, was born and raised in Western Australia and competed as a professional bodyboarder before moving to Hawaii, where she met her husband and started surfing competitively, according to her bio on the surfing\u00a0website. \u201cWhen I was 18 years old, I came to Hawaii for a competition and met Tamayo while bodyboarding out at Pipeline. A few years later, I picked up a surfboard, we got married and there was no turning back,\u201d she wrote, adding, \u201cthe vast amounts of ocean knowledge that Tamayo has ingrained in me over the years is priceless.\u201d The University of Florida\u2019s International Shark Attack File lists 120 shark bite incidents in 2023. Of the 36 shark bites that occurred in the US, eight were in Hawaii, one of which was fatal. According to the shark attack file\u2019s 2023 report, surfers experienced 42% of bites worldwide. Though the number of bites and fatalities increased last year, compared to the previous year, the report authors say the numbers are still in line with recent trends. The Honolulu community will provide the necessary support following Perry\u2019s death, the mayor\u00a0said. \u201cAs we grieve this unimaginable loss, we are reminded of the inherent risks faced by our lifeguards daily, and we extend our deepest gratitude for their service,\u201d Blangiardi said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/24/us/tamayo-perry-death-pirates-of-the-caribbean/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_26_us_texas-death-row-ramiro-gonzales", "text": "Texas executed\u00a0Ramiro Gonzales\u00a0by lethal injection on Wednesday for a 2001 murder, the state Department of Criminal Justice said, following unsuccessful appeals to the US Supreme Court that argued, in part, he should have been ineligible for the death penalty under state law because he is no longer dangerous. Gonzales, 41, was convicted and sentenced to death in 2006 for the sexual assault and killing of 18-year-old Bridget Townsend, court records show. His execution was the first of two \u2013 the other in Oklahoma \u2013 scheduled this week in the United States. Gonzales was pronounced dead at 6:50 p.m., the state criminal justice department said. The department provided Gonzales\u2019 last statement before he was executed, in which he repeatedly apologized to the Townsend family and said he \u201cnever stopped praying\u201d for their forgiveness: \u201cI can\u2019t put into words the pain I have caused y\u2019all, the hurt what I took away that I cannot give back.\u201d \u201cI hope this apology is enough. I lived the rest of this life for you guys to the best of my ability for restitution, restoration, taking responsibility,\u201d Gonzales said. \u201cI never stopped praying that you would forgive me and that one day I would have this opportunity to apologize.\u201d During the penalty phase of Gonzales\u2019 trial, jurors were required to find, as they are in all capital cases in Texas, a \u201cprobability\u201d Gonzales would continue to \u201ccommit criminal acts of violence.\u201d Without this determination, capital defendants in the Lone Star State are not eligible for the death penalty, per state law. In their appeals to the Supreme Court, Gonzales\u2019 attorneys said his track record these last 18 years shows he is not dangerous, pointing to his commitment to his Christian faith, ministry to others behind bars and his unsuccessful attempts to donate a kidney to a stranger in need. Additionally, they said the evidence relied upon to make the finding of future dangerousness was false: An expert witness who diagnosed the inmate with antisocial personality disorder relied on recidivism data later found to be incorrect, and he has since evaluated Gonzales and walked back his testimony. In a pair of brief orders Wednesday, the US Supreme Court gave no comment in its denial of Gonzales\u2019 requests. There were no noted dissents. Gonzales\u2019 attorneys, Thea Posel and Raoul Schonemann, said in a statement Monday: \u201cRamiro not only has disproven the jury\u2019s prediction \u2013 he has never committed a single act or threat of violence since he was sentenced to death in 2006 \u2013 but in fact actively contributes to prison society in exceptional ways. He should not be executed.\u201d The state of Texas had also opposed Gonzales\u2019 appeals, arguing in part his team had misconstrued the eligibility requirement and contending the question of whether Gonzales would continue to be a threat is not limited to the inmate\u2019s behavior on death row. Even when his behavior post-conviction is taken into account, \u201cthere\u2019s undoubtedly sufficient evidence to uphold the finding of future dangerousness,\u201d attorneys for the state wrote, pointing to the subsequent kidnapping and rape of another woman and a litany of transgressions he committed while in jail. \u201cEven if a jury could somehow consider events that had not happened yet, i.e., Gonzales\u2019s behavior on death row, the jury could still have rationally believed Gonzales would be a danger in the future,\u201d they said. On Monday, the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles declined to recommend clemency in a 7-0 vote. Without that recommendation, Republican Gov. Greg Abbott is limited by state law to issuing Gonzales a one-time 30-day reprieve. CNN has reached out to the Medina County Criminal District Attorney\u2019s Office, which prosecuted the case, and members of Townsend\u2019s family for comment. In his final statement before execution, Gonzales also thanked his family and friends, along with two officials with the Texas Department of Criminal Justice for \u201cthe opportunity to become responsible, to learn accountability and to make good.\u201d 18 months passed before key confession Gonzales murdered Townsend in January 2001, after he called the home of his drug supplier, her boyfriend, in search of drugs, according to a 2009 Texas appeals court opinion affirming the inmate\u2019s conviction and death sentence. When Townsend told Gonzales her boyfriend wasn\u2019t home, he went to the house in search of drugs. He stole money, then kidnapped Townsend, tying her hands and feet before driving her to a location near his family\u2019s ranch, the opinion states. There, he raped and fatally shot her, it says. The case went unsolved for 18 months. Then, while sitting in jail after pleading guilty to the rape of another woman, Gonzales confessed to Townsend\u2019s killing and led authorities to her body. Gonzales\u2019 execution was the nation\u2019s eighth this year, with the ninth slated for Thursday in Oklahoma, according to data from the Death Penalty Information Center, a non-profit organization that tracks capital punishment in the US and has in the past been critical of the way it\u2019s administered. Oklahoma intends to execute Richard Rojem for the 1984 kidnapping, rape and murder of his 7-year-old stepdaughter, Layla Cummings, court records show. The state\u2019s parole board voted last week against recommending clemency for Rojem, who claims he is innocent, according to CNN affiliate KOCO. Rojem, like Gonzales, would be the second person executed in their respective states so far in 2024, according to the center\u2019s data. By this time last year, 13 inmates had been put to death in the US, the data shows.

{"id": "2024_06_26_politics_primaries-maga-squad-what-matters", "text": "There must be some sort of larger takeaway in the fact that Rep. Lauren Boebert, among the most MAGA members of Congress, won a Republican primary in Colorado on Tuesday night, and Rep. Jamaal Bowman, a member of the progressive \u201cSquad\u201d from the Bronx, lost a Democratic primary to a more moderate candidate from Westchester County in New York. Every House race is different, obviously, since all politics is local, according to the old saying. So it would be an oversimplification to say that Republicans moved more MAGA and Democrats moved more moderate based on these two unrelated races. More MAGA or moderate? And yet there\u2019s evidence to support that general trend. Look no further than the two parties\u2019 presidential candidates. Former President Donald Trump personifies MAGA, and a large part of the Make America Great Again ethos he pushes is loyalty to him. President Joe Biden, on the other hand, effectively worked with Republicans to pass a bill to improve the nation\u2019s infrastructure and has said he wants to work with Republicans on immigration reform. Many Republicans will tell you they don\u2019t believe Biden. There\u2019s nothing moderate about either Boebert or Bowman, who occupy space on the fringe of their respective parties. Both were also seriously flawed candidates with problems that extend beyond policy. Boebert was kicked out of a theater last year for vaping and \u201ccausing a disturbance,\u201d for instance. Bowman was charged last year with pulling a fire alarm in a House office building when there was no emergency. Rather than face voters in the district she narrowly won two years ago, Boebert moved to run in a district with a more conservative voting record. She emerged from a crowded field to win the Republican primary in the district, which was previously represented by Rep. Ken Buck, a conservative Republican who is a critic of Trump and had resigned from office in frustration. Bowman, on the other hand, was targeted by more mainstream Democrats in part for his loud criticism of Israel in its war on Hamas in Gaza, an issue that has split Democrats this year. Pro-Israel groups spent heavily in the race, attempting to oust Bowman. However, in advertising, Bowman was attacked more for his opposition to Biden\u2019s policies than for his position on Israel. Evidence of a liberal retreat I asked CNN\u2019s Gregory Krieg, who covered the Bowman race, why he thinks Bowman lost and what it says about Democrats today. Here\u2019s what he emailed back: KRIEG: There are obviously many ways to read Bowman\u2019s defeat, and his failure to bridge the gap with pro-Israel Jewish voters in the district, specifically in Westchester, is understandably the one you\u2019re hearing most often. But I also think, if we\u2019re looking at this through a national lens, it\u2019s hard to not see it as part of the broader liberal retreat from some of the more aggressive left-wing characters and candidates they embraced during Trump\u2019s presidency.\u00a0 For all the talk about Democrats\u2019 lack of enthusiasm about Biden personally, the idea of Biden \u2013 the moderate, even-tempered statesman type \u2013 is still very, very popular. And (Westchester County Executive George) Latimer, to some extent, embodied that.  It obviously did not help Bowman that AIPAC (the American Israel Public Affairs Committee) and other outside groups bombarded him with record spending and gobs of money invested in research into every thought that\u2019s crossed his mind the last 25 years.  That primary voters did not hold the spending against Latimer, as progressives argued they should, also reminds me that voters (especially Democrats) in presidential cycles tend to be cautious. You\u2019ll probably never hear Trump, Fox News or anyone on the right mention Latimer\u2019s name. And for some folks left-of-center, that\u2019s priceless. Utah went its own way While Boebert\u2019s victory provides a foil for Bowman\u2019s loss, it was far from a perfect night for more MAGA Republicans. In a separate Colorado race, the chair of the state GOP, Dave Williams, who had gotten Trump\u2019s endorsement but who said controversial things about gay rights \u2013 including that Pride flags should be burned \u2013 lost to the more establishment pick, Jeff Crank, a real estate investor and former talk radio host. And in Utah, Republicans snubbed the MAGA options for both governor and senator in a state that is very conservative but where the base of Mormon voters has bristled at the former president. Current Sen. Mitt Romney is a notable Trump critic in the GOP, and his decision not to run for reelection opened up an opportunity to replace one of the few remaining Republicans who voted to convict Trump on impeachment charges in 2021 with a Trump-backed Republican. Rep. John Curtis, the winner of the GOP Senate primary, did not vote to convict Trump as a member of the House, but he is the rare Republican focused on climate change, an issue that disproportionately affects Utah but which Trump dismisses. The larger problem \u2026 Both Curtis and Gov. Spencer Cox were actually rejected by GOP party activists at the state\u2019s nominating convention but found their way onto the ballot with the help of signature drives. Cox has taken more moderate positions on certain issues and was booed at the state GOP convention this year,\u00a0according to The Associated Press. But Cox and Curtis both easily won primaries, which are open to all voters and which essentially determine the winner of statewide contests in a state like Utah. It\u2019s a shame that primary voters are becoming the de facto general election voters in states and districts that lean heavily to one side or the other, according to former Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels, a Republican who wrote a lament in The Washington Post that most of the country lives in a state with \u201ctrifecta\u201d government, where one party controls most of what\u2019s happening at their state level. Daniels writes: The issue isn\u2019t simply that states lean reliably Republican or Democratic. It\u2019s that now a big majority are heavily, maybe irrevocably, tilted in one direction or the other. Where that obtains, office seekers pitch their initial appeals to the hard core on their side, as primary candidates always have. The difference is that, instead of the winner\u2019s traditional post-primary imperative, to reach out to nonpartisans and even open-minded members of the opposing party, now their job is finished. There are efforts to change this dynamic, which we\u2019ve written about in this newsletter, such as in states experimenting with nonpartisan primaries and ranked-choice voting. But Daniels has a point. None of the races we\u2019ve discussed so far in this story are expected to be at all competitive in November.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/26/politics/primaries-maga-squad-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_24_us_dali-crew-members-ship-sails-virginia", "text": "Eight of the 21 crew members from the cargo ship that struck and destroyed a famed Baltimore bridge are back home Monday after myriad complications kept them confined on board for months. Two other crew members have also been cleared to return overseas, a spokesperson for the ship\u2019s manager said. The news came as the Dali cargo vessel started its journey Monday from Baltimore\u2019s Seagirt Marine Terminal to Norfolk, Virginia, to undergo repairs, said Darrell Wilson, spokesperson for ship manager Synergy Marine. Four crew members stayed on the ship to assist a relief crew during the Dali\u2019s voyage to Norfolk, Wilson said. After the journey is complete, they will join the seven remaining crew members, who must stay in the US indefinitely. The Dali\u2019s crew members, including 20 from India and one from Sri Lanka, had been stuck on the Dali since March 26. During the frigid predawn hours, the 984-foot ship lost power, veered off course and destroyed the Francis Scott Key Bridge,\u00a0killing six construction workers. While none of the crew members have been charged in connection with the disaster,\u00a0investigations are underway\u00a0to determine who might be responsible. The ship\u2019s officers are among the 11 crew members who must stay in the US, Wilson said. They have been cooperating with authorities, but it is unclear when they will get to leave. The seamen who will remain in the US are expected to stay in hotels or apartments, said the Rev. Joshua Messick, director of the Baltimore International Seafarers\u2019 Center and chaplain for the Port of Baltimore. \u201cThey\u2019re anxious, under considerable stress, considering they don\u2019t know what the future holds,\u201d Messick told CNN Thursday. \u201cThey don\u2019t know when they\u2019ll see their family again or how they\u2019ll be treated here.\u201d As for the 106,000-ton vessel, \u201cThe Dali is scheduled to transit directly to Virginia International Gateway to have roughly 1,500 cargo containers offloaded to reduce draft,\u201d the US Coast Guard said in a statement Monday morning. \u201cThe vessel is then scheduled to transit further to Norfolk International Terminal, where it is slated to undergo continued salvage and repairs from damage caused during the bridge collapse.\u201d While repair efforts continue, new details have emerged in a federal probe into what caused the deadly disaster. Investigators have zeroed in on a piece of the Dali\u2019s electrical system, which failed moments before the ship crashed into the bridge, the National Transportation Safety Board said in a Monday update. The update follows a preliminary report published last month, which said two circuit breakers on the Dali tripped, triggering a nearly ship-wide electrical blackout about three ships\u2019 lengths from the Francis Scott Key Bridge. On Monday, the NTSB said investigators have finished testing electrical components on board and have removed a wire connector known as a terminal block for further testing at the NTSB lab in Washington, DC. Investigators have found an \u201cinterruption in the control circuit\u201d in one breaker\u2019s undervoltage release, which would cause it to trip when voltage falls below predetermined thresholds, the NTSB said Monday. The NTSB\u2019s update is not final, and the agency has not found a probable cause of the crash, which could take months to determine.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/24/us/dali-crew-members-ship-sails-virginia/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_26_us_jocelyn-nungaray-killing-houston", "text": "Two undocumented Venezuelan men have been charged with capital murder in the killing this month of a 12-year-old girl in Houston, the latest case to underscore the pivotal role immigration continues to play in US politics and the upcoming presidential election. Johan Jose Martinez-Rangel, 22, and\u00a0Franklin Jose Pe\u00f1a Ramos, 26, were arrested June 20, three days after the strangled body of Jocelyn Nungaray was found in a shallow creek, according to the Houston Police Department. A judge this week ordered each man held on a $10 million bond, court records show. Both men are Venezuelan nationals who entered the US illegally, a spokesperson for US Immigration and Customs Enforcement told CNN. It\u2019s\u00a0unclear when and where they entered the\u00a0country, the spokesperson said, but each was apprehended near El Paso by US Border Patrol \u2013\u00a0Martinez-Rangel on\u00a0March\u00a014\u00a0and Pe\u00f1a Ramos on May\u00a028\u00a0\u2013 and released with a notice to appear in court in the future. An attorney for Pe\u00f1a Ramos declined to comment.\u00a0An attorney for\u00a0Martinez-Rangel did not immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday. Republicans and right-wing media have\u00a0pointed to the case as a consequence of\u00a0the immigration policies of President Joe Biden\u2019s administration as they seek\u00a0to draw a contrast with his rival, former President Donald Trump. \u201cThat little girl would be alive today if Biden enforced immigration laws at the border,\u201d GOP Gov. Greg Abbott said on X following the suspects\u2019 arrests. Trump, who will face Biden Thursday in CNN\u2019s Presidential Debate, has echoed as much, saying in a speech over the weekend both suspects \u201cwould not have been in our country\u201d if he were president, despite the fact similar crimes\u00a0occurred during his time in office.\u00a0He also pointed\u00a0to the cases of two women who authorities say were killed in the past year by\u00a0men\u00a0who crossed into the country illegally: Georgia nursing student Laken Riley\u00a0and Maryland mother Rachel Morin. Asked Wednesday about the cases, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said, \u201cOur hearts are with the families of the victims.\u201d \u201cThe criminals who committed these heinous acts must be held responsible with the fullest force of the law,\u201d he told CNN\u2019s Kate Bolduan. \u201cWe will hold the criminals accountable.\u201d Jocelyn\u2019s body was found along West Rankin Road in north Houston early in the morning of June 17, authorities have said. Detectives got surveillance footage from the area showing the suspects together at a restaurant the prior evening, Lt. Stephen Hope of the Houston Police Department said at a news conference after their arrests. The pair left on foot and were later seen meeting and talking with Jocelyn, Hope said, before all three walked to a convenience store. A few minutes later, Hope said, Jocelyn and the men went to the bridge where \u201cultimately, Jocelyn was murdered,\u201d Hope said.\u00a0The suspects left, he said, before returning to a residence they shared. On June 20, Houston police found the suspects at an apartment complex where they were arrested without incident, Hope said, crediting the community with helping police throughout the investigation. At this time, the charges against the suspects do not carry eligibility for the death penalty, Harris County District Attorney Kim Ogg said at a news conference Monday, according to footage from CNN affiliate KHOU, adding forensic evidence is still being examined. The decision on whether to seek a death sentence would not be unilaterally made by Ogg, she said. Her office has a committee that makes that choice based on the evidence and the feelings of the victim\u2019s family. At that news conference, Alexis Nungaray, Jocelyn\u2019s mother, said it had been \u201ca very, very hard time\u201d for her family, telling reporters she kept seeing \u201csigns\u201d that reminded her of Jocelyn in the days following her death. \u201cI know this is a very high-profile case,\u201d Nungaray said, \u201cbut she was still my firstborn. I was a teen mom, I fought for her at 15. I\u2019m 27 now, and I\u2019m still fighting for her.\u201d \u201cJust remember that she was a very special little girl that deserves her justice.\u201d CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated when the two men entered the US.

They did \u2014 and offered these predictions about this week\u2019s showdown. Here\u2019s what else you need to know to\u00a0Get Up to Speed and On with Your Day. 1. Extreme weather As millions of Americans swelter under record-breaking temperatures, major flooding from heavy rains in the Midwest has strained a Minnesota dam to the brink of collapse. The Rapidan Dam located about 70 miles southwest of Minneapolis is in \u201cimminent failure condition,\u201d the Blue Earth County government said. In a Monday evening update, the county said there are currently no plans for a \u201cmass evacuation\u201d while emergency crews actively monitor the situation. Severe flooding already wreaked havoc across the Midwest over the weekend, killing at least one person in South Dakota and prompting rescue efforts in multiple states. 2. SCOTUS The Supreme Court is poised to announce blockbuster decisions this week on abortion, guns and former President Donald Trump\u2019s claims of absolute immunity. Trump has argued that without immunity, presidents would be hamstrung in office, always fearful of being second guessed by a zealous prosecutor after leaving the White House. The immunity case appears likely to come down to whether Trump\u2019s actions after the 2020 election were \u201cofficial\u201d \u2013 that is, steps he was taking as president \u2014 or whether they were \u201cprivate,\u201d which would not likely receive immunity. The high court on Monday also agreed to hear the Biden administration\u2019s challenge to a transgender care ban, delving into the complicated issue of whether states can ban hormone therapy and puberty blockers for minors. 3. Julian Assange WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has agreed to plead guilty to a felony charge related to his alleged role in one of the largest US government breaches of classified material, as part of a deal with the Justice Department that will allow him to avoid prison time in the United States. Federal officials pursued Assange after his whistleblowing website published nearly half a million secret military documents relating to the US wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. The 52-year-old Australian has spent the past five years in a high-security UK prison and nearly seven years before that holed up at the Ecuadorian embassy in London. The new plea deal allows Assange to return to Australia as a free man, but not until he has made a court appearance in a remote US territory in the Pacific. 4. Trash balloons North Korea sent another wave of balloons purportedly filled with waste and trash into South Korea overnight, reigniting a tit-for-tat exchange as tensions on the Korean Peninsula continue to heighten. More than 1,000 such balloons from the North have made it into South Korean territory since May, according to a CNN tally. North Korean Leader Kim Jong Un has said the balloons were a \u201cresponsive act\u201d to the South\u2019s years-long practice of flying leaflets that contain materials critical of his regime. The latest balloon salvo comes as inter-Korean diplomacy remains at an impasse. Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a defense agreement with North Korea last week as talks on its denuclearization efforts have stalled, and Kim has vowed to expand his country\u2019s nuclear arsenal. 5. Space race China\u2019s Chang\u2019e-6 lunar module returned to Earth today, completing its historic mission to collect the first ever samples from the far side of the moon. The mission is a major step forward for the country\u2019s ambitious space program.

{"id": "2024_06_26_politics_media-release-supreme-court-abortion", "text": "For the second time in two years, the public learned of where the Supreme Court was headed in a major abortion case before the justices had formally handed down their ruling, spoiling the court\u2019s highly controlled protocols. The circumstances around the mistaken publishing of an apparent ruling in\u00a0an Idaho abortion case are very different from the norm-busting leak of the 2022 draft opinion\u00a0that overturned Roe v. Wade. But both disclosures showed the limits on justices\u2019 ability to roll out controversial opinions on their deliberate and custom-oriented timetable. Typically, rulings are released on pre-scheduled opinion days with no forecast ahead of time of which cases are coming down. Those mornings, the justices gather in the court to read summaries of their opinions, which are posted online shortly as hard copies are distributed to the court\u2019s dedicated press corp. Every day, agencies, businesses and organizations deal with the premature disclosure of internal information. But for the Supreme Court, it is viewed as a major departure from its culture of confidentiality if even the smallest nugget about what\u2019s going on behind the scenes makes it into public view. The leak of the 2022 opinion overturning Roe \u2013 obtained and published by Politico nearly two months before the ruling was formally handed down \u2013 was a shocking breach of the storied cone of silence around the Supreme Court\u2019s internal deliberations. It prompted endless speculation about the culprit and their political motives, with an investigation by the court\u2019s marshal unable to identify the source of the leak. The internal probe did reveal that the court had surprisingly lax systems that allowed draft opinions to circulate among a wide group of people, with gaps in the technical security that was supposed to protect the court from such exposures. While much is still not known about how a version of the Idaho case ruling was accidentally posted online, it nonetheless comes as tensions at the court are running high, as the justices scramble to catch up with a backlog of undecided cases. The case in dispute is over whether Idaho can enforce its abortion ban in situations of serious emergency pregnancy complications that do not threaten the pregnant person\u2019s life. According to the accidentally released opinion, which was obtained and reported by Bloomberg, the\u00a0majority opted to dismiss the case as \u201cimprovidently granted\u201d \u2013 a move that allows the justices to duck the case\u2019s legal questions while more proceedings play out at lower courts. The ruling, if and when formally handed down, means that an order from a trial judge that had blocked enforcement of Idaho\u2019s abortion ban in medical emergencies will now go back into effect. For now, the Supreme Court\u2019s public affairs office is acknowledging that a \u201cdocument\u201d was \u201cinadvertently and briefly uploaded\u201d by the court\u2019s \u201cpublication unit.\u201d \u201cThe Court\u2019s opinion in\u00a0Moyle v. United States\u00a0and\u00a0Idaho v. United States\u00a0will be issued in due course,\u201d court spokesperson Patricia McCabe said, referring to the names of the consolidated case. IT hiccups haunt the Supreme Court It appears that the posting of the\u00a0opinion Wednesday to the court\u2019s website was the result of a technological mess-up that was easily traced back to the court and one that likely made the opinion public only a day or two before its planned release. That sets it apart from the leak of the draft opinion reversing Roe, in a case known as Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization. The disclosure seemed to be a purposeful move to get the opinion into the public domain. It happened several weeks before the final ruling came down, while the draft was still being polished and \u2013 perhaps \u2013 votes were not finalized. Still, both instances highlighted how things can fall through the cracks even at the country\u2019s most opaque government institution and how 21st century technology can outpace the court\u2019s practices. While the investigation into the Dobbs leak did not determine how the opinion got out, it revealed stunning lapses in the court\u2019s informational security. At least 90 people had access to the draft, according to the marshal\u2019s report. The probe found no indications of a hack, but the report said that there were issues with the court\u2019s IT system that hindered the investigation. Follow-up reporting by CNN revealed that justices were known to use personal emails to send sensitive communications and that so-called \u201cburn bags\u201d to dispose sensitive physical documents went unused. Court employees we also able to print court documents on devices that did not create the \u201clogs\u201d meant to track the printing of documents. Earlier this term, an IT hiccup gave the public another unintended glimpse into how a separate blockbuster case came together. The case, a unanimous ruling in favor of former President Donald Trump\u2019s challenge to Colorado\u2019s removal of him from its ballot, featured a concurrence authored jointly by the three liberals. But metadata from the opinion showed that the concurrence started out as a partial dissent, authored by Justice Sonia Sotomayor, suggesting that it was a last-minute shift in the votes that got all nine justices signed on to the unanimous opinion.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/26/politics/media-release-supreme-court-abortion/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_25_us_fordyce-arkansas-grocery-shooting-suspect-not-guilty-plea", "text": "A man accused of killing four people and injuring nine others during a shooting at an Arkansas grocery store has entered a not guilty plea to capital murder and other charges, a prosecutor said Tuesday. Travis Eugene Posey, 44, opened fire at the\u00a0Mad Butcher in Fordyce\u00a0on Friday, armed with a pistol, a 12-gauge shotgun and a bandoleer with dozens of extra shotgun rounds, authorities said. Posey entered the not guilty plea during his first court appearance in\u00a0Ouachita County, where he has been held since the shooting in neighboring Dallas County, Jeff Rogers, the prosecuting attorney for the 13th\u00a0Judicial District of Arkansas, told CNN. He is being held without bond and his next court date has not been set. CNN has reached out to Posey\u2019s public defender for comment. Posey could face additional charges pending the outcome of the investigation, the Arkansas State Police said in a\u00a0news release. Authorities believe Posey began engaging victims in the parking lot after exiting his truck and then entered the store, Secretary of Public Safety and Director of Arkansas State Police Mike Hagar said at a Sunday news conference. He then fired \u201cindiscriminately\u201d at customers and employees inside the store, according to Hagar. \u201cThe suspect arrived at the Mad Butcher armed,\u201d he said. \u201cWe believe that most, if not all the rounds fired by the suspect were from the shotgun.\u201d A motive is unclear, police say. Law enforcement responded to the shooting around 11:30 a.m. and exchanged gunfire with the suspect, state police said. \u201cHe immediately engaged in a firefight with law enforcement, where they were able to stop the threat,\u201d Hagar said. Posey was treated for non-life threatening injuries and taken to the Ouachita County Detention Center, state police said in a news release. Victims remembered by family as loving parents and grandparent Seven people aged 20 to 65 were injured by gunfire and two responding officers were shot and wounded in the incident, according to police. The four people killed have been identified as Callie Weems, 23; Ellen \u201cJanie\u201d Shrum, 81; Roy Sturgis, 50; and Shirley Taylor, 62. Weems is survived by her 10-month-old daughter, Ivy, according to a\u00a0GoFundMe\u00a0page set up by family friends to help with her funeral expenses. \u201cWith Ivy being left behind this is a great way for Helen (Callie\u2019s mother) to also do something for her future. She loved her child and everyone witnessed her being a phenomenal mom,\u201d the campaign, verified by GoFundMe, says. The young victim\u2019s mother, Helen Browning, is also mourning the death of another: She said Sturgis, a logger and a loving father, was part of her extended family, the Associated Press reported. The oldest victim, Shrum, leaves behind her husband of 63 years, their three children and numerous grandchildren and great-grandchildren, who knew her lovingly as \u201cGrammie.\u201d \u201cShe was completely selfless,\u201d her son, Tait Shrum, told CNN. \u201cShe didn\u2019t have a selfish bone in her body.\u201d Taylor\u2019s daughter, Angela Atchley, told CNN her mother loved her family and kids, describing her as \u201cthe hardest working woman I know.\u201d \u201cWe are completely lost,\u201d she said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/25/us/fordyce-arkansas-grocery-shooting-suspect-not-guilty-plea/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_26_media_cnn-presidential-debate", "text": "CNN on Thursday\u00a0will do something no network has done in more than 35 years \u2013 host its own general election presidential debate. It is a pivotal moment, not just for the country as it picks a new president, but also for CNN \u2014 with a new leader at the helm of\u00a0the news network that has been beset\u00a0by declining\u00a0television viewership\u00a0as it urgently embarks on a\u00a0major\u00a0newsroom\u00a0overhaul to embrace its digital future. Thursday night\u2019s presidential debate, a marketing coup for CNN and its new chief executive, Mark Thompson,\u00a0will\u00a0offer the network a\u00a0bright spot \u2013 and expectations of\u00a0record\u00a0ratings, even if viewers end up watching the debate on other networks. No matter where viewers\u00a0tune in to watch the primetime matchup between President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump, it will be clear this is a CNN debate. As a\u00a0public service, CNN has allowed\u00a0other\u00a0networks to air the event,\u00a0so long as they agree to\u00a0the network\u2019s rules\u00a0over\u00a0how the\u00a0event\u00a0is promoted and\u00a0re-broadcast. Rival networks, for example,\u00a0have agreed to\u00a0use CNN in the programming title and keep the\u00a0red CNN logo on screen\u00a0throughout\u00a0the debate. For CNN, the branding boost from the debate may provide a much-needed shot in the arm. Over the last year, CNN\u2019s television viewership has fallen, regularly settling into third place behind MSNBC and the right-wing talk channel Fox News. Last week, CNN total viewership averaged fewer than 500,000 in primetime, and 80,000 in the advertiser-coveted 25-to-54-year-old demographic, according to Nielsen. The declining viewership trend is not unique to CNN. But it has notably taken hold during breaking news events, once seen as the network\u2019s bread and butter, when general audiences turned to the cable channel en masse to watch unfolding coverage. CNN is also looking to move past previous missteps. Last year, under then-network chief Chris Licht, the network hosted a live town hall with Trump, in which the former president unloaded a host of lies and insulted moderator Kaitlan Collins as an audience applauded and cheered. Licht was later fired after a brief but tumultuous tenure. Thursday\u2019s debate offers Thompson and the network\u2019s executives the chance to reset the reputation of a network that has long defined itself as \u201cthe most trusted name in news.\u201d Thursday\u2019s debate will pose a high-stakes test for Thompson and the network\u2019s executives as they go it alone without the independent Commission on Presidential Debates, making key decisions about how the politically charged showdown will appear for the millions expected to tune in. A break in tradition CNN\u2019s debate will include some shifts in tradition,\u00a0including\u00a0two\u00a0commercial breaks during the roughly\u00a090-minute\u00a0event, a first since the Commission on Presidential Debates took over the process more than 35 years ago. Other networks are also free to sell their own advertising but cannot put up their own commentators or anchors during\u00a0the\u00a0breaks. There will be no live audience this time, and the candidates\u2019 microphones will be muted while the other is speaking.\u00a0The podiums will also be eight feet apart, much closer than the last Trump-Biden debate in 2020, during the Covid-19 pandemic, when they were positioned 12 feet apart. It\u2019s also the earliest a\u00a0general election\u00a0debate has ever been held,\u00a0coming\u00a0weeks\u00a0before either candidate\u00a0is formally nominated at their party\u2019s conventions. \u201cThat\u2019s by design,\u201d CNN political director David Chalian said. \u201cThe Biden campaign was certainly interested in an earlier debate, in part because I think they see a target universe of voters that they\u2019re trying to reach who aren\u2019t engaged in this election.\u201d Frank Fahrenkopf, co-chair of the Commission on Presidential Debates, said he was \u201cshocked\u201d\u00a0by how early the debate was taking place in the campaign.\u00a0The commission, which has sponsored the debates since the 1980s,\u00a0\u201cregrettably announced\u201d\u00a0Monday that it was\u00a0cancelling its debates\u00a0for the 2024 election that had been scheduled for September and October. \u201cThe Biden-Harris Campaign informed the Commission that President Biden will not agree to debate under the sponsorship of the Commission during the 2024 general election campaign,\u201d it said. Instead, both candidates have agreed to a second debate in September hosted by ABC. This isn\u2019t\u00a0the first time the commission\u2019s role\u00a0in the debates has been\u00a0challenged. In 2000, then\u00a0Gov.\u00a0George W. Bush challenged then Vice President Al Gore to three debates \u2013 one by the commission, and two other ones to be hosted by CNN and NBC. But in the end, Bush relented, and the candidates debated each other three times in the span of eight days in commission-sponsored debates. Alan Schroeder, a\u00a0journalism\u00a0professor at Northeastern University and author of the book \u201cPresidential Debates: Risky Business on the Campaign Trail,\u201d said he\u2019s an \u201caficionado\u201d of the debate commission because of that history. \u201cPresidential debates have a long history of being tampered with by the campaigns, and the commission over its many decades did an excellent job circumventing the political shenanigans and institutionalizing presidential debates as an expectation rather than something that might or might not take place depending on the candidates\u2019 whims and poll standings,\u201d Schroeder said. A new format \u2013 and few fact checks While both Biden and Trump have agreed to the terms of\u00a0CNN\u2019s\u00a0debate, including the format, rules and moderators, the Trump campaign has spent the days leading up to Thursday\u00a0assailing\u00a0the moderators, Jake Tapper and Dana Bash, and questioning their objectivity. The move, a page out of the Trump media playbook, is a repeat of the 2020 campaign, when Trump also attacked\u00a0the moderators of the general election debates. \u201cTrump may complain about CNN, but he was quick to accept their sponsorship, so I believe that speaks for itself,\u201d Schroeder said. \u201cTo me it just sounds like whining,\u201d he added. \u201cFor sure, there is an element of trying to \u2018work the refs\u2019 in advance of the event, but I think most people are smart enough to see that for what it is.\u201d One thing that will not be a major feature of this debate:\u00a0fact checking. \u201cWhat we want to make sure that we do here, our role here, is to facilitate, to moderate a debate between these two candidates,\u201d Chalian said. \u201cNot for Jake and Dana to become participants in that debate, but to make sure that President Biden and former President Trump have the ability, have the time and space to get their visions out to the American people on these issues that are top of mind for them.\u201d That means it will be mostly up to the candidates to try\u00a0to\u00a0correct the record on stage should their rival push lies or misinformation, a particularly thorny challenge given Trump\u2019s lengthy history of using major platforms to unleash falsehoods. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult, if not impossible, for moderators to fact-check during a live debate,\u201d Schroeder said. \u201cIf there\u2019s a clear-cut issue that can be dispensed within five seconds \u2013 like a candidate claiming the sky is not blue \u2013 then that\u2019s easy enough to handle, but most issues are a lot more complex than that and cannot be resolved in real time on an immediate basis.\u201d CNN, for its part, plans to offer a fact-check of the candidates\u2019\u00a0claims following the telecast. While CNN and ABC are hosting the debates this election season, Fahrenkopf said he believes the 2024 debates are merely a hiccup in the commission\u2019s long history, and that they\u2019ll be back to sponsoring the debates for the next campaign. \u201cThere are other ways to do things and we\u2019ll look at it, and maybe (the CPD) will learn something from it,\u201d he said. But with the candidates moving to\u00a0circumvent the commission and its rules, some critics have\u00a0suggested it could eventually result in\u00a0highly partisan actors hosting the debates\u00a0in the future.\u00a0But Schroeder said he doesn\u2019t\u00a0believe\u00a0that Thursday\u2019s event will lead to that possibility, since each campaign still must sign off on the\u00a0terms of any\u00a0debate. For now, he said,\u00a0there are still \u201cenough mainstream news organizations.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/26/media/cnn-presidential-debate/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "us"}}

{"id": "2024_06_26_us_trails-carolina-camp-death-update-homicide", "text": "A boy from New York journeyed to North Carolina for camp but did not survive his first night, authorities said.\u00a0Now, his death is being investigated as a homicide. Hours after arriving at Trails Carolina, a program for adolescents with behavioral or emotional issues, the 12-year-old suffocated in February after camp staff directed him to sleep in a fully enclosed bivy sack, a newly released autopsy report states. A bivy sack is a piece of sleeping equipment that usually includes waterproof material. \u201cThe cause of death is asphyxia due to smothering,\u201d the autopsy report says. \u201cThe manner of death is homicide.\u201d The boy\u2019s family, who lives in New York, has asked CNN not to publicize the boy\u2019s name. The family declined to comment further, family representative Robert J. Higdon Jr. said. The Transylvania County Sheriff\u2019s Office said it is investigating the death. While no arrests have been made, investigators do have suspects, Det. John C. Nicholson told CNN on Wednesday. The sheriff\u2019s detective declined to answer additional questions, citing the ongoing investigation. CNN has reached out to Trails Carolina for comment. While North Carolina authorities have started the process to permanently revoke the nature camp\u2019s license, Trails Carolina could still appeal. Confined in a bivy enclosed with an alarm A bivy sack gives more protection than a sleeping bag alone, often eliminating the need to sleep in a tent when camping. Bivies typically include a breathable inner layer that can be zipped and an opaque, waterproof outer layer. \u201cIt should be noted that a common warning on commercially available bivy products indicates that the outer, weather resistant opening should not be fully secured as it may lead to condensation and breathing restriction,\u201d the boy\u2019s autopsy report states. \u201cThis information was obtained on basic web search.\u201d During the overnight hours between February 2 and 3, the boy was directed to sleep in a fully enclosed bivy with an attached alarm that would alert counselors if the boy tried to leave, the autopsy report states. The child had previously left his bivy sack to sleep outside of it. The counselors woke him and made him re-enter the bivy. According to the camp\u2019s protocol, the boy \u201cwas placed to sleep in a bivy (small camping enclosure) with a sleeping mat and sleeping bag,\u201d the autopsy report states. \u201cThe program\u2019s protocol required the bivy to be placed on top of a thick mil plastic sheet which was folded up the sides in the form of a \u2018canoe\u2019. The opening to the bivy was then secured with an alarm device such that if the occupant attempted to exit the bivy, it would alarm and wake up the counselors in the cabin,\u201d the autopsy report says. \u201cAccording to investigative reports, the internal mesh bivy door, which is normally used to secure the opening, was torn and the outer weather resistant door was instead (used) to secure the opening with the alarm device.\u201d During the overnight hours, a counselor noticed the boy was moving around \u201cbut stopped moving shortly after,\u201d the autopsy report states. \u201cRoutine checks were performed throughout the night, but due to the outer, opaque layer of the bivy being closed, he could not be visualized,\u201d the report says. \u201cIn the morning, the counselors attempted to wake him up but noted he was not moving.\u201d Trails Carolina released multiple statements in the days following the boy\u2019s death. \u201cWe are shattered by the tragic loss of a young life and our deepest sympathies are with the student\u2019s family and loved ones,\u201d the camp said in a February 6 statement. Two days later, the camp issued another statement in response to the sheriff\u2019s office\u2019s initial findings, which said the boy\u2019s death \u201cappeared suspicious\u201d and claimed the camp was not cooperating with the investigation. \u201cTrails has conducted an internal investigation of this incident and the Trails facility has been investigated by outside professionals who are subject-matter experts,\u201d the camp said February 8. \u201cBoth investigations have concluded that there is no evidence that Trails failed to properly supervise, no evidence that Trails caused harm, and no evidence that conditions at Trails were unsafe or unhealthy.\u201d \u201cOur staff have fully cooperated with the local law enforcement\u2019s investigation,\u201d the statement continued. \u201cAny assertion to the contrary is false, reckless, and defamatory.\u201d Trails Carolina has not given an updated statement to CNN after repeated requests for comment this week. The camp is shut down for now Trails Carolina is an \u201coutcome-driven nature-based therapy program in Lake Toxaway, North Carolina,\u201d the camp said in its February 6 statement. \u201cThe program helps adolescents, aged 10-17-years-old, work through behavioral or emotional difficulties, build trusting relationships with their family and peers, and achieve academic success.\u201d The camp \u201cpairs psychological counseling with a variety of outdoor activities, including hiking, backpacking, camping, rock climbing and equine-assisted emotional work,\u201d Trails Carolina said. Following the boy\u2019s death and an investigation into the camp, the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services started the process of revoking Trails Carolina\u2019s license, according to documents obtained by CNN. \u201cThey cannot operate at this time,\u201d agency spokesperson Kelly Haight Connor said Tuesday. On February 12, the DHHS sent a letter to Trails Carolina ordering the camp to halt new admissions and stop using \u201cbivy bags for any purpose\u201d until an investigation is complete. On March 28, the DHHS sent a letter ordering Trails Carolina to suspend admissions because \u201cconditions in the facility are found to be detrimental to the health and safety of the clients.\u201d The letter cited violations involving medication requirements, incident response requirements and protection from harm, abuse, neglect or exploitation. And on May 17, the DHHS sent a letter to Trails Carolina saying it was starting the process to revoke its license. But Trails Carolina has 60 days \u2013 or until mid-July \u2013 to appeal the revocation of its license. As of Tuesday, the DHHS was not aware of any appeals filed, the agency\u2019s spokesperson said. CNN\u2019s Eva Roytburg contributed to this report.

The 3-year-old record holder died after becoming ill and undergoing an unplanned surgery. His family, who live in West Des Moines, Iowa, have been left \u201cdevastated,\u201d his owner Tracy Wolfe said in GWR press release. \u201cHe was just the best giant boy,\u201d she added. Kevin measured 0.97 meters (3 feet 2 inches) tall from his feet to his withers \u2013 the area just above his shoulders \u2013 and when he stood on his hind paws, he reached an astonishing height of about 2.13 meters (7 feet), towering over his owner Roger Wolfe. Yet despite his size, Kevin was the \u201cepitome of gentle giant,\u201d his owner Tracy said when the record was announced on June 13, and was actually \u201cscared of most things.\u201d Even the measuring tape used to verify his record spooked him, while Tracy added that he was \u201cterrified of the vacuum\u201d and would \u201cjump and run to get away from it.\u201d And when Kevin was taken to his first training class by Tracy and Roger\u2019s 12-year-old son, Alexander, he got so scared that he pooped in the middle of the class. \u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s aware he is as big as he is,\u201d Tracy said earlier this month. \u201cHe\u2019s continuously trying to squeeze into small beds and sit on top of us and do everything that the smaller dogs do.\u201d His favorite activity was to take naps, she added, and he ate six to 10 cups of food every day, as well as occasionally stealing food off the kitchen counters. \u201cKevin is funny and he is super duper friendly,\u201d Tracy said. \u201cIn fact, overly friendly. You don\u2019t want to keep your mouth open too much when he\u2019s around because of his tongue. But everybody loves seeing him as long as they don\u2019t get whipped by his tail.\u201d The family brought him home as a puppy, named him after Kevin in the movie \u201cHome Alone\u201d and noticed that he kept growing and growing until he was even bigger than their pony. Eventually, he was named the world\u2019s tallest male dog, taking over the title from fellow Great Dane Zeus who also died aged three in September, after suffering from bone cancer. Great Danes have relatively short life expectancies compared to smaller dogs, living for an average of 8-10 years, and males are typically about 2.5 feet (0.76 meters) tall, according to the American Kennel Club.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/25/us/worlds-tallest-male-dog-kevin-dies-intl-scli/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_26_politics_wisconsin-supreme-court-abortion-draft-order-leaks", "text": "The chief justice of the Wisconsin Supreme Court called for an investigation Wednesday after the leak of a draft order that showed the court would take a case brought by Planned Parenthood that seeks to declare that access to abortion is a right protected by the state constitution. Chief Justice Annette Ziegler called for the investigation after Wisconsin Watch reported on the draft order that it obtained. The order as reported by Wisconsin Watch said the court would hear the court challenge, but it was not a ruling on the case itself. \u201cToday the entire court was shocked to learn that a confidential draft document was ostensibly leaked to the press,\u201d Zielger said in a statement. \u201cI have contacted law enforcement to request that a full investigation be conducted.\u201d She said all seven justices were \u201cunited behind this investigation to identify the source of the apparent leak. The seven of us condemn this breach.\u201d Ziegler is part of a three-justice conservative minority on the court. The draft order did not indicate which justices were in favor of accepting the abortion case, and there were no dissents indicated, according to Wisconsin Watch. Planned Parenthood brought the lawsuit in February. It asks the Wisconsin Supreme Court to overturn a 175-year-old state law that conservatives have interpreted as an abortion ban. That is the second abortion-related lawsuit before the court. The Wisconsin Supreme Court has not said whether it will accept the appeal of a lower court ruling won by Democratic Attorney General Josh Kaul. He challenged the 1849 law as too old to enforce and trumped by a 1985 law that allows abortions up to the point when a fetus could survive outside the womb. Dane County Circuit Judge Diane Schlipper ruled last year that the law only prohibits attacking a woman with the intent to kill her unborn child. The decision emboldened Planned Parenthood to resume offering abortions in Wisconsin after stopping procedures in response to the US Supreme Court ruling overturning Roe v. Wade. Sheboygan County District Attorney Joel Urmanski, a Republican, has appealed and asked the state Supreme Court to take the case directly without waiting for a lower appellate ruling. The draft order in the Planned Parenthood case did not address the other lawsuit, according to Wisconsin Watch. The abortion cases are among the highest profile before the court that flipped to liberal control in 2023. The court in December threw out Republican-drawn legislative maps, handing Democrats a huge win that resulted in the Legislature adopting new boundaries drawn by Democratic Gov. Tony Evers. The court has also heard a lawsuit that would restore the use of absentee ballot drop boxes, a closely watched case in battleground Wisconsin. A ruling on that case is expected soon given that the court\u2019s term ends next week.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/26/politics/wisconsin-supreme-court-abortion-draft-order-leaks/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_26_business_boeing-whistleblower-787", "text": "A whistleblower has come forward Wednesday alleging parts of Boeing\u2019s 787 Dreamliner planes were built in an unsafe manner \u2013 potentially leading to \u201cdevastating consequences.\u201d Richard Cuevas, a mechanic at Strom, a contractor for Boeing manufacturing partner Spirit Aerosystems, claims that he witnessed holes that were improperly drilled into the forward pressure bulkheads of 787 planes at Spirit\u2019s Wichita, Kansas, facility in 2023. The bulkhead is one of the primary parts of an airplane\u2019s body and crucial for keeping the structure of the plane intact while it\u2019s in the air. Cuevas claims that he filed a complaint in October 2023 to Boeing and Spirit about \u201csubstandard manufacturing and maintenance processes\u201d he witnessed, and was fired just a few months later, according to the complaints filed by his attorneys and obtained by CNN. Boeing said it had previously investigated Cuevas\u2019 allegations and they did not pose a safety problem. \u201cA subcontractor\u2019s employee previously reported concerns to us that we thoroughly investigated as we take seriously any safety-related matter,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cEngineering analysis determined that the issues raised did\u00a0not\u00a0present a safety concern and were addressed.\u201d The company said it is reviewing the documents Cuevas\u2019 attorneys made public Wednesday and will investigate any new claims. Spirit Aerosystems and Strom did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The Federal Aviation Administration said in a statement that they \u201cstrongly encourage anyone with safety concerns to report them and we thoroughly investigate every report.\u201d The FAA said it has revieved 126 Boeing whistleblower reports this year and 11 last year. Cuevas said the gaps he observed in the plane\u2019s forward pressure bulkheads appeared in two aircraft that he helped build and could potentially lead to \u201ccatastrophe.\u201d Cuevas claims the workers were drilling holes slightly larger than Boeing\u2019s specifications to \u201cclear excess paint from the holes and speed up a slow process,\u201d which, he believes, could compromise power and air pressure on the planes, creating serious safety risk for the passengers on board. Cuevas said he filed a complaint with Boeing\u2019s ethics hotline, reporting to management that he believed Spirit was hiding the issues from Boeing. He also alleges that Boeing opened an investigation into Cuevas\u2019 concerns in October 2023, alerting Spirit management to the complaints. During that time, Cuevas says his colleague remarked, \u201cwe\u2019ve got a snitch among us,\u201d and in March, Spirit suddenly fired Cuevas, according to the complaints. The complaints say Cuevas witnessed these problems with three planes he worked on and believes these issues may affect at least 10 to 12 planes either in production or already released to Boeing. A growing list of problems for Boeing The claims aren\u2019t new: A previous whistleblower, Sam Salehpour, a Boeing engineer, said he found and reported similar gaps in 787 and 777 aircraft. For nearly two years starting in 2021, the FAA and Boeing\u00a0halted deliveries of the new Dreamliners\u00a0while it looked into the gaps.\u00a0Boeing said it made changes in its manufacturing process, and deliveries ultimately resumed. More than a dozen whistleblowers have come forward against Boeing in recent years, and the number has grown substantially since a door plug blew off a 737 Max plane in January just after takeoff, leaving a gaping hole in the side the plane. Last week, for example, a current Boeing employee claimed that the company tried to shield broken or out-of-specification 737 Max plane parts from regulators and lost track of them \u2013 and he feared they may have been installed on planes that are carrying passengers. The FAA has opened multiple investigations into Boeing and the US Department of Justice said it may file criminal charges against the company because of its ongoing quality and safety failures. The FAA has said a six-week audit of Boeing\u2019s facilities conducted in the late winter found multiple problems with Boeing\u2019s production practices. A separate\u00a0report\u00a0found \u201cgaps\u201d in Boeing\u2019s safety culture, including a disconnect between management and employees, and fears among employees about retaliation for reporting safety concerns. Boeing\u2019s CEO Dave Calhoun last week apologized for Boeing\u2019s recent safety failures in testimony delivered to a Senate committee but pushed back on claims that the company retaliated against those who brought safety issues to light. Calhoun said Boeing is \u201cfar from perfect,\u201d and he acknowledged that the company will not easily regain the public\u2019s trust. Correction: An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated where and when the alleged improper drilling took place.

{"id": "2024_06_25_us_oklahoma-religious-charter-school-supreme-court", "text": "An effort to establish the first publicly funded religious charter school in the country has been blocked by the Oklahoma Supreme Court. The court Tuesday ordered the state to rescind its contract with St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School\u00a0in a 6-2 decision with one recusal. \u201cUnder Oklahoma law, a charter school is a public school,\u201d wrote Justice James R. Winchester for the court. \u201cAs such, a charter school must be nonsectarian. However, St. Isidore will evangelize the Catholic faith as part of its school curriculum while sponsored by the State.\u201d A charter contract for St. Isidore was approved by a state board\u00a0last year.

Kevin Stitt strongly advocated for the school, saying when the contract was approved that it was \u201ca win for religious liberty and education freedom in our state.\u201d But the school\u2019s charter status was strongly opposed by Attorney General Gentner Drummond, who filed the lawsuit against it and predicted the state could be forced to fund other types of religious education if St. Isidore succeeded. \u201cThe framers of the US Constitution and those who drafted Oklahoma\u2019s Constitution clearly understood how best to protect religious freedom: by preventing the State from sponsoring any religion at all,\u201d Drummond said in a statement\u00a0Tuesday. \u201cNow Oklahomans can be assured that our tax dollars will not fund the teachings of Sharia Law or even Satanism.\u201d CNN asked Stitt\u2019s office Tuesday for comment on the Supreme Court decision. The American Civil Liberties Union applauded the decision, saying, \u201cCharter schools are public schools that must be secular and serve all students. St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School, which plans to discriminate against students, families, and staff and indoctrinate students into one religion, cannot operate as a public charter school.\u201d Meanwhile, the Archdiocese of Oklahoma City is\u00a0\u201cdisappointed in today\u2019s ruling as it disregards the needs of many families in Oklahoma who only desire a choice in their child\u2019s education,\u201d its\u00a0senior director for education\u00a0Lara Schuler said in a written statement Tuesday. \u201cWe will remain steadfast as we seek to right this wrong and to join Oklahoma\u2019s great diversity of charter schools serving all families in the state.\u201d \u201cSt. Isidore is considering its legal options but today\u2019s decision to condone unconstitutional discrimination against religious educators and the children they serve is one that the\u00a0school will continue to fight,\u201d said\u00a0John Meiser of the University of Notre Dame\u2019s Religious Liberty Clinic, who assisted St. Isidore with its charter application to the state.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/25/us/oklahoma-religious-charter-school-supreme-court/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_24_us_ramiro-gonzales-execution-texas-parole-board", "text": "Texas\u2019 parole board on Monday denied clemency for death row inmate Ramiro Gonzales, who is scheduled to be executed Wednesday for a 2001 murder, despite the fact a key expert witness no longer stands by his testimony at trial. Gonzales, 41, had asked the Board of Pardons and Paroles to recommend clemency, which would allow GOP Gov. Greg Abbott to commute the inmate\u2019s sentence to a lesser punishment, like life in prison without parole, for the 2001 sexual assault and killing of 18-year-old Bridget Townsend. Gonzales and his attorneys pointed to his traumatic upbringing and his rehabilitation \u2013 illustrated by his Christian faith \u2013 as reasons to spare his life, the petition shows. In a pair of brief orders Wednesday, the US Supreme Court rejected a last-minute appeal from Gonzales to pause his execution. Gonzales on Monday had asked the high court for a stay of execution after the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals rejected an appeal in which the inmate argued his trial jury\u2019s determination that he would remain a dangerous threat \u2013 a requirement for a capital sentence in Texas \u2013 was based on testimony by an expert witness who relied on data later found to be false. And it was ultimately wrong, his attorneys argued, as shown by Gonzales\u2019 redemption behind bars and his earlier attempts to donate a kidney. Thus, Gonzales should be ineligible for execution, his attorneys contended, and executing him would violate his constitutional rights under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments. Additionally, they argued Texas had violated his Constitutional rights by requiring a finding of \u201cfuture dangerousness\u201d for a capital sentence without providing an opportunity for it to be reviewed in post-conviction proceedings. Gonzales and his attorneys advanced similar arguments in their appeals before the US Supreme Court. His lawyers told the Supreme Court Gonzales has \u201cgrown into a mature, peaceful, kind, loving, and deeply religious adult.\u201d His attorneys argued it would violate the Constitution to execute someone who did not meet the eligibility criteria for a death sentence on state law. The state rejected that argument in its own briefing, accusing Gonzales of waiting \u201cuntil the eleventh hour to raise these claims\u201d and attempting to \u201cbypass\u201d lower courts. The Texas parole board voted 7-0 against recommending a commutation of sentence or a 180-day reprieve. His attorneys were \u201cdeeply saddened and disappointed\u201d by the decision, they said in a statement. \u201cIf Ramiro is executed on Wednesday, the world will be a darker place without him,\u201d the attorneys said. Without the board\u2019s recommendation, Abbott is limited by state law to issuing a one-time 30-day reprieve. The planned execution of Gonzales, who was previously slated to be put to death in July 2022 before the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals granted a stay, is one of two scheduled this week in the United States. On Thursday, Oklahoma intends to execute Richard Rojem, who was convicted of the 1984 kidnapping, rape and murder of his 7-year-old stepdaughter, Layla Cummings, court records show. Last week, the Oklahoma Pardon and Parole board voted against recommending clemency for Rojem, who claims he is innocent, CNN affiliate KOCO reported. If both Gonzales and Rojem are put to death, their executions would be the eighth and ninth to take place in the nation this year, according to the Death Penalty Information Center, a non-profit that monitors and analyzes information about capital punishment and has been critical of its administration. Both would be the second person to be executed in their respective states in 2024. By this time last year, 13 inmates had been put to death in the US, the center\u2019s data shows. In the Texas case, the Medina County Criminal District Attorney\u2019s Office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. CNN has tried to reach members of Townsend\u2019s family for comment. The murder of Bridget Townsend One day in January 2001, Gonzales called the home of his drug supplier, who was Townsend\u2019s boyfriend, according to a court of appeals opinion from 2009 affirming the inmate\u2019s conviction and death sentence. Townsend answered, the opinion states, and told Gonzales her boyfriend was at work. Gonzales then went to the home in search of drugs, and he stole money and tied Towsend\u2019s hands and feet before kidnapping her. He then drove her to a spot near his family\u2019s ranch, where he raped and fatally shot her, the court opinion says. In October 2002, while sitting in a county jail in connection to the rape of another woman, Gonzales confessed to Townsend\u2019s killing and led authorities to her body, court records show. Gonzales was 18 when he murdered Townsend, his clemency petition says, contending he was in the throes of drug addiction that was \u201ccompounded by the trauma and neglect that marked his childhood,\u201d his clemency petition states. Gonzales\u2019 mother drank and used drugs during her pregnancy and gave her son to her parents when he was born, the petition claims. She had two other children whom she raised, it says, but didn\u2019t acknowledge Gonzales as her son. The petition also says Gonzales was sexually abused throughout his childhood, beginning at age 6. Gonzales began using drugs in his teens, after his aunt \u2013 with whom he was close \u2013 was killed by a drunken driver, causing him \u201cinconsolable grief,\u201d the petition says. \u201cIn the years that followed, Ramiro\u2019s life spiraled out of control,\u201d it says. Inmate no longer poses a threat, appeal says During his years on death row, Gonzales has become a \u201cliving testament to the power of rehabilitation and human capacity for growth and change,\u201d his attorneys argued this month in his appeal before the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals. He has become \u201cdeeply religious,\u201d has \u201ccommitted no criminal acts of violence\u201d and has tried to atone for his crimes \u2013 in part by trying to donate a kidney. Ahead of his last execution date, Gonzales sought a 30-day reprieve so he could participate in an altruistic kidney donation. But the Texas Department of Criminal Justice deemed him ineligible under its health care policy, a spokesperson told CNN at the time, because an organ transplant would introduce an \u201cuncertain timeline\u201d that might interfere with an execution date. Gonzales\u2019 attorneys said that\u2019s just one example of Gonzales\u2019 \u201cgrowth and rehabilitation,\u201d also citing his commitment to his faith and ministry to others on death row, according to the recent appeal. Taken together, Gonzales\u2019 attorneys said, this evidence exhibits the inmate is no longer a threat to society, disproving a finding made by his jury at trial that was required for him to be sentenced to death. Additionally, Gonzales\u2019 lawyers argued the evidence jurors relied upon to make the determination of future dangerousness was wrong: An expert witness for the state testified during the penalty phase of the inmate\u2019s trial that he had diagnosed Gonzales with antisocial personality disorder, and that \u201clots of data\u201d showed sex offenders were likely to continue to commit crimes, citing in part recidivism data. That data has since been found to be inaccurate, and the expert in 2021 evaluated Gonzales and has recanted his testimony, including the diagnosis, Gonzales\u2019 appeal stated. The expert told The Marshall Project he had never changed his opinion in a capital case prior to this one, calling it \u201cthe exception, not the rule.\u201d When the Court of Criminal Appeals halted Gonzales\u2019 last execution, it sent the case back to his trial court to review the expert\u2019s testimony and whether it impacted the jury\u2019s decision. Gonzales\u2019 appeal said the state recommended relief be denied and that the lower court agreed without holding a hearing. The appeals court ultimately denied relief in June 2023.

{"id": "2024_06_25_us_karen-read-murder-trial-closings", "text": "Is Karen Read a rage-filled cop killer, or the convenient patsy of a vast police cover-up? That\u2019s the question put to a Massachusetts jury on Tuesday in closing arguments of her murder trial in a case that has riveted the Bay State. The case stems from the death of Boston Police Officer John O\u2019Keefe, whose body was found bruised and battered in the snow on January 29, 2022, outside the home of a fellow Boston police officer in the suburb of Canton. Prosecutors have alleged Read and O\u2019Keefe, who were dating, had gotten into an argument that night, and that she drunkenly drove a vehicle into him and fled the scene, leaving him to die in the cold. \u201cWhat the constellation of the facts and the evidence ineluctably demonstrate here is that the defendant drove her vehicle in reverse at 24.2 miles per hour for 62.5 feet, struck Mr. O\u2019Keefe, causing those catastrophic head injuries, leaving him incapacitated and freezing him to death,\u201d prosecutor Adam Lally said in closing arguments Tuesday. In contrast, her defense has accused off-duty police inside that Canton home of fatally beating O\u2019Keefe, dumping his body on the lawn and then conspiring through fabricated evidence and false testimony to frame Read. \u201cLadies and gentlemen, there was a cover-up in this case, plain and simple,\u201d defense attorney Alan Jackson said. \u201cYou\u2019ll surely say to yourself, \u2018I don\u2019t want to believe it, I don\u2019t want to believe that could happen in our community,\u2019 but sadly over these past eight weeks you\u2019ve seen it right before your eyes.\u201d Read, 45, has pleaded not guilty to charges of second-degree murder, vehicular manslaughter while intoxicated and leaving the scene of a collision. After closing arguments Tuesday morning, the jury began deliberations at about 1:30 p.m. and continued for about three hours. They will return on Wednesday morning. The closing arguments represent the end of a murder trial that has garnered interest both local and widespread, including accusations of witness tampering, a federal probe into the investigation, and groups of pink-wearing supporters chanting to \u201cFree Karen Read.\u201d The prosecution\u2019s case also has been hampered by a series of missteps and unusual investigative practices. Most notably, a lead investigator in the case, Massachusetts State Police Trooper Michael Proctor, admitted that he sent a series of sexist and offensive texts about Read in a private group chat, calling her a \u201cwhack job,\u201d mocking her medical issues and commenting to coworkers that he had found \u201cno nudes\u201d while searching her phone for evidence, CNN affiliate WCVB reported. Proctor apologized for the \u201cunprofessional\u201d comments on the stand, but the vulgar texts have been sharply criticized in and out of court, including from the governor. \u201cIt\u2019s completely unprofessional,\u201d Gov. Maura Healey told WCVB of the texts. \u201cIt does harm, frankly, to the dignity and the integrity of the work of men and women across the state police and law enforcement. So as a former attorney general and as governor, I am disgusted by that.\u201d At closing arguments, the prosecution condemned the texts as \u201cunprofessional, indefensible, (and) inexcusable\u201d but said they had no impact on the integrity of the investigation. The defense disagreed. \u201cThey cannot distance themselves from the stench of him on this case and this investigation. Those secret group chats illustrate the quality and care of this investigation,\u201d Jackson said. How the trial has gone The heart of the trial stems from what happened on one wintry evening in Canton over two years ago. On the night of January 28, 2022, Read and O\u2019Keefe went out drinking at two bars with friends. Shortly after midnight, the couple climbed into Read\u2019s SUV and drove to the home of O\u2019Keefe\u2019s colleague on Fairview Road for an after-party, court documents show. The prosecution alleged that the couple got into an argument that led to O\u2019Keefe getting out of the vehicle. A drunken Read then struck him with the vehicle and fled, leaving him to die in the snowy cold, prosecutors say. However, Read has said she dropped off O\u2019Keefe at the house and then drove to his home because she wasn\u2019t feeling well, according to court documents. The next morning, when she realized he was still not home, she drove in a snowstorm to look for him, and finally found his body in the front yard of the Canton house. Read and her legal team have alleged O\u2019Keefe was injured in a fight inside the house \u2013 including being mauled by the homeowners\u2019 German shepherd, Chloe \u2013 and then tossed out in the snow. They argued that Read was framed for his death and alleged a vast cop conspiracy and a corrupt investigation. Prosecutors have rejected that theory. Firefighters who responded to the scene that morning asked about his injuries, and Read told them, \u201cI hit him, I hit him,\u201d according to their testimony. In addition, Read\u2019s vehicle had a broken taillight, and pieces of the taillight were found outside the Canton home, prosecutors said. \u201cFrom all of those people within that house that evening, none of them at any point in time observed John O\u2019Keefe come into that house,\u201d Lally said in opening statements. \u201cThey saw the vehicle pull away and they just assumed that they (O\u2019Keefe and Read) left and that no one was coming.\u201d The trial began in April and featured testimony from several law enforcement officers, with some as witnesses and others as investigators. The prosecution has presented evidence that Read and O\u2019Keefe had a volatile relationship. O\u2019Keefe\u2019s niece and nephew said they heard the couple yelling in arguments prior to his death, and an ATF agent testified about his romantic kiss and text messages with Read, according to WCVB. Further, in the minutes after prosecutors say she hit him with the SUV, she called his phone and left a voicemail yelling, \u201cJohn, I f**king hate you!\u201d The defense has sharply questioned witnesses about whether Read truly confessed to hitting him with her vehicle and have challenged investigators about the quality of their work. For example, investigators used red plastic cups to collect evidence from the scene, and surveillance video of Read\u2019s vehicle was inexplicably flipped to a mirror image, WCVB reported. \u201cLie, obfuscate, manipulate, alter, and when they\u2019re caught, they just excuse it away,\u201d Jackson said in closing arguments. \u201cThat\u2019s not sloppiness,\u201d he added. \u201cThat\u2019s evidence manipulation.\u201d Aidan Kearney, a Massachusetts blogger nicknamed Turtleboy, has fed the ongoing debate with numerous posts alleging a murder coverup by law enforcement and local politicians. In October, Kearney pleaded not guilty to charges of\u00a0witness intimidation and conspiracy, CNN affiliate WBZ reported, after he allegedly called and sent messages to witnesses and investigators in Read\u2019s case.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/25/us/karen-read-murder-trial-closings/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_26_politics_supreme-court-abortion-idaho-bloomberg", "text": "The Supreme Court appears poised to temporarily allow abortions in medical emergencies in Idaho, Bloomberg News reported Wednesday, citing a document that was inadvertently posted on the court\u2019s website in an astonishing breach of protocol. The unsigned opinion showed that three conservatives \u2013 Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett \u2013 sided with the court\u2019s three liberals to block the state from enforcing the ban in certain emergency situations. The court acknowledged a document was briefly posted, but stressed that no opinion is final until announced by the justices. The abortion case is considered among the most significant of the current term that is winding down ahead of the July 4 holiday. It\u2019s the second time in two years that a major decision dealing with an abortion case has been prematurely released. Two years ago, Politico obtained a draft of the high court\u2019s opinion overturning Roe v. Wade \u2013 a document that was substantially the same as the final opinion the court released weeks later. At issue is Idaho\u2019s strict abortion ban, which provides an exception for the life of the pregnant woman. The Biden administration argued that a federal law also requires hospitals to perform abortions in cases where the health of the pregnant woman is at stake. The decision means that an order from a trial judge that had blocked enforcement of Idaho\u2019s abortion ban in medical emergencies would go back into effect while the case continues to be argued in lower courts. Such a ruling is a temporary win for the Biden administration and will be a relief to Idaho women who fear medical complications from their pregnancies could jeopardize their heath. But it would leave unresolved the central question of whether federal law protects access to abortion in medical emergencies, and it is not likely to end the precariousness and uncertainty that doctors have felt about how to navigate strict abortion bans while caring for their patients. \u201cIf the reporting is accurate, this would be a significant but temporary victory for the Biden administration,\u201d said Steve Vladeck, CNN Supreme Court analyst and professor at the University of Texas School of Law. A Supreme Court spokeswoman, Patricia McCabe,  confirmed that a \u201cdocument\u201d was \u201cinadvertently and briefly uploaded\u201d to the court\u2019s website. She stressed that the opinion in the case \u201chas not been released\u201d and would be \u201cissued in due course.\u201d Here\u2019s what to know about what happened Wednesday: Where the conservatives and liberals agreed The copy reviewed by Bloomberg showed the court voting 6-3 to allow the emergency abortions to take place in Idaho on a temporary basis while the case continues. But they did so for slightly different reasons. The court\u2019s three liberals argued in a concurrence by Justice Elena Kagan that the court erred when it allowed the state to enforce the law temporarily while the Supreme Court considered the case. The state ban, Kagan wrote, \u201cprevents hospitals from doing\u201d what the federal law commands. The decision \u201cwill again give Idaho women access to all the needed medical treatments that EMTALA guarantees.\u201d Justice Amy Coney Barrett, in a separate concurrence joined by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Brett Kavanaugh, made a slightly different point. Barrett argued that Idaho appears to be able to enforce its ban \u201cin the vast majority of circumstances.\u201d Barrett\u2019s point is that she doesn\u2019t believe there\u2019s a significant conflict between the Biden administration and Idaho because of changes that were made to the Idaho law as the litigation unfolded. The Department of Justice and the White House declined to comment on Bloomberg\u2019s story and the mistakenly posted document until the Supreme Court\u2019s official opinion is released. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson agreed with the decision to temporarily block enforcement of the Idaho ban but she dissented from the court\u2019s decision to dismiss the case. Liberals and abortion-rights groups worry about the future case How abortion bans have been playing out in medical emergencies has emerged as a particularly explosive political flashpoint in the fallout of Roe v. Wade\u2019s reversal. The Idaho ban at issue allowed abortions if a pregnant woman\u2019s life was at stake, but not her health. Six states have bans like Idaho\u2019s that include no exception for the health of a pregnant woman, the Justice Department has said, though several of those laws are the subject of litigation. The Biden administration argued Idaho\u2019s ban could force patients to, for instance, endure hysterectomies and other lifelong complications if doctors declined to provide an abortion in the emergency room. A US District Court in Idaho last year blocked enforcement of the state law. A three-judge panel of the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals paused that decision, allowing the law to take effect. Weeks later, the full 9th Circuit reversed the panel\u2019s decision, putting enforcement of the law on hold again. In January, the Supreme Court\u00a0agreed to decide the case\u00a0and allowed the state law to take effect while it did so. Abortion-rights groups have been careful not to celebrate the finding in the document, instead saying that the justices\u2019 ruling would merely delay a future decision that may restrict abortion access in emergency situations. Jackson wrote separately to say that she wouldn\u2019t have dismissed the case. \u201cToday\u2019s decision is not a victory for pregnant patients in Idaho. It is delay,\u201d she wrote. \u201cWhile this court dawdles and the country waits, pregnant people experiencing emergency medical conditions remain in a precarious position, as their doctors are kept in the dark about what the law requires.\u201d It was particularly wrong, Jackson said, because the court had for months allowed Idaho\u2019s strict abortion law to remain in effect. \u201cIt is too little, too late for the Court to take a mulligan and just tell the lower courts to carry on as if none of this has happened,\u201d Jackson wrote. The Justice Department sued Idaho over its abortion ban in August 2022, a few weeks before it was scheduled to take effect. It argued that a federal law known as the Emergency Medical Treatment & Labor Act \u2013 or EMTALA \u2013 required hospitals that receive Medicare funding to offer the procedure in medical emergencies. The law, passed in 1986, requires those hospitals to provide \u201cstabilizing\u201d treatments for emergency room patients who are facing serious harm to their bodily functions. Congress enacted EMTALA to stop hospitals from turning away patients who could not afford their care. The law does not specify which procedures hospitals must perform to stabilize patients and Idaho accused the Biden administration of wrongly interpreting the Reagan-era law to \u201ccreate a nationwide abortion mandate in hospital emergency rooms.\u201d The state also argued that changes to the abortion law since its enactment meant doctors could adhere to EMTALA and the ban simultaneously. Idaho\u2019s law makes it a felony to perform an abortion, punishable by up to five years in prison. Doctors can also lose their medical licenses. \u201cThe U.S. Supreme Court had the opportunity to be clear that the federal EMTALA law protects the right to abortion in an emergency in every state \u2026 and they chose not to,\u201d said Planned Parenthood Federation of America President and CEO Alexis McGill Johnson in a statement to CNN. Interpretation of \u2018unborn child\u2019 is left for another day At oral arguments on April 24, several members of the court\u2019s conservative majority expressed skepticism of the Biden administration\u2019s position, with some justices framing the case as a federal encroachment on state powers to regulate medicine. Republican-appointed justices also zeroed in on amendments Congress made to the federal law in 1989 that added language about a pregnant woman\u2019s \u201cunborn child\u201d to its protections. Idaho argued it was nonsensical that a law referencing protections for an unborn child would require hospitals to offer abortions. A dissent written by Justice Samuel Alito, joined by Justices Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch, embraced an argument put forward by Idaho and its supporters in their efforts to defend the state\u2019s strict ban on abortion. Alito said the law provided for the \u201cexpress protection of the unborn child.\u201c \u201cFar from requiring hospitals to perform abortions, EMTALA\u2019s text unambiguously demands that Medicare-funded hospitals protect the health of both a pregnant woman and her \u2018unborn child,\u2019\u201d Alito wrote. He later added that \u201cEMTALA obligates Medicare-funded hospitals to treat, not abort, an \u2018unborn child.\u2019\u201d Kagan, in parts of her concurrence that were joined by both Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Jackson, disagreed. She said three of the statute\u2019s four references to an \u201cunborn child\u201d have to do with how hospitals handle transfers of women in labor, and thus were not related to the types of emergency pregnancy complications at issue in this case. The fourth provision, Kagan wrote, \u201censures that a woman with no health risks of her own can demand emergency-room treatment if her fetus is in peril.\u201d She added, \u201cIt does not displace the hospital\u2019s duty to a woman whose life or health is in jeopardy, and who needs an abortion to stabilize her condition,\u201d Kagan said. Abortion rights advocates countered that that was not Congress\u2019 intent, and worried that the conservative Supreme Court would read fetal personhood into a federal statute for the first time ever. For now, it is unclear whether either interpretation is accepted by a majority of the high court. More major abortion case drama For the second time in two terms, the public learned of where the Supreme Court was headed in a major abortion case before the justices had formally handed down their ruling, spoiling the court\u2019s highly controlled protocols around the release of opinions. On opinion days, the Supreme Court traditionally begins at 10 a.m. ET and reads any opinions it will release in order in terms of seniority \u2014 from most-junior to most-senior. Any per curiam opinions \u2014 majority decisions that are unsigned \u2014 would be at the end. They are announced from the bench and simultaneously handed out to reporters in the press room in print and posted online. The difference Wednesday was that the opinion was mistakenly posted online and it wasn\u2019t announced from the bench and printed copies were not present. The decision came days after the Supreme Court unanimously rejected an effort by anti-abortion groups to limit access to the abortion pill mifepristone. The court ruled that the groups that challenged access to the drug did not have standing to sue, a technical decision that does not foreclose the possibility that others might.

Madalina\u2019s mother, Diana Cojocari, 37, and stepfather, Christopher Palmiter, 60,\u00a0were arrested on December 17\u00a0for failure to report the disappearance of a child to law enforcement, police said. In May, Cojocari was convicted of failure to report the disappearance, after changing her plea to guilty without a plea agreement, Mecklenburg County court records show. She was sentenced to a minimum of six and a maximum of 17 months in prison, according to the judgment in the case. CNN has reached out to Cojocari\u2019s attorney, Daniel Powers Roberts, regarding her new status as a suspect in the case. The Mecklenburg District Attorney\u2019s Office referred any additional questions to the Cornelius Police Department. CNN has reached out to police for additional information. \u201cWe want to #FindMadalina. This has been our priority since we learned she was missing. Please continue to share her picture on social media to help us and call us if you have any information that can help our detectives at 704-892-7773,\u201d police said in the Tuesday update posted on Facebook. Madalina was last seen at her home on November 23, but her parents took until December 15 to report her missing to a resource officer at her school, Bailey Middle School. According to the probable cause affidavits filed by police in the case, both adults denied knowledge of Madalina\u2019s whereabouts. A search warrant issued in March revealed Madalina\u2019s mother and grandmother discussed a theory that Palmiter \u201cgave the girl away for money\u201d during a recorded jail phone call. They also discussed a \u201cbag with money\u201d and \u201cwithdrawing cash,\u201d the warrant says. Investigators then asked for access to bank records, the warrant shows, which they believed would \u201callow investigators to establish a financial pattern for Chris Palmiter and may contain information pertaining to the disappearance of Madalina.\u201d During another recorded jail phone call between Palmiter and his brother and sister-in-law, Palmiter mentioned the girl\u2019s mother \u201chad a lot of cash with her and he did not know where it came from.\u201d Palmiter also told his family there was \u201cfinancial stuff\u201d coming up and his brother told him not to worry about it, the warrant states. Officers searched the family\u2019s home in December and seized more than two dozen items, including three cell phones,\u00a0CNN previously reported. Other items taken in the search were redacted from an inventory document. Madalina was last seen wearing jeans; pink, purple and white Adidas shoes; and a white T-shirt and jacket, authorities said. The FBI described her as 4-foot-10 inches and weighing 90 pounds, and a photo released to the public shows a smiling girl wearing a shirt that reads, \u201cI can change the world with love.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/26/us/madalina-cojocari-missing-mother-suspect/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "us"}}

Nine were on college campuses, and 25 were on K-12 school grounds. The incidents left 16 people dead and at least 38 other victims injured, according to CNN\u2019s analysis of events reported by the Gun Violence Archive, Education Week and Everytown for Gun Safety. CNN cross checks these reports of school shootings against school and police accounts and media reports. All incidents of gun violence are included if they occurred on school property, from kindergartens through colleges/universities, and at least one person was shot, not including the shooter. School property includes but is not limited to, buildings, fields, parking lots, stadiums and buses. Accidental discharges of firearms are included, as long as at least one person is shot, but not if the sole shooter is law enforcement or school security. In the first year of the pandemic, when schools were closed, there was a major decline in gun violence incidents on school grounds. Since then, recent years saw a stark increase in school shootings, with 2021, 2022 and 2023 all setting records since at least 2008. There were at least 82 incidents in 2023, but 2022 was one of the deadliest years, with 46 fatalities, according to CNN\u2019s analysis. That year saw the shooting at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, where 19 students and two educators were killed and more than a dozen others were injured. Students and educators have engaged in activism around the issue of gun violence, and some educators have quit the profession. Some states in the south have seen the highest rate of school shootings relative to their populations since 2008, according to CNN\u2019s analysis. Washington, DC had the highest rate \u2014 6 total shootings, more than 0.8 per 100,000 people \u2014 while Texas had the most overall with 60 school shootings. Meanwhile, just five states \u2014 Montana, Wyoming, New Hampshire, Vermont and Rhode Island \u2014 had no school shootings in that period, according to CNN\u2019s analysis.", "source": "http://cnn.com/us/school-shootings-fast-facts-dg/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "us"}}

Police officers and EMS were already on the scene responding to another call when the attack happened around 12:30 p.m., and personnel responded within two minutes, Younginer said. Bystanders got the teenager out of the water and applied towels and pressure to stop the bleeding, while a police officer applied a tourniquet and EMS stabilized the patient, the chief said. The victim was then taken to Camp Lejune Naval Hospital where medical staff treated his leg, according to police. The boy should be released from the hospital soon,\u00a0Younginer told CNN. Shark attacks, often characterized as \u201cunusual,\u201d have been occurring steadily this summer season. There were no reported shark sightings, and the attack is \u201can unusual occurrence\u201d for the area, according to Younginer.

{"id": "2024_06_26_us_new-jersey-beach-lightning-strike-death", "text": "A man died after being struck by lightning on a New Jersey beach Sunday while trying to warn other beachgoers of an incoming storm, authorities said. Patrick Dispoto, 59, was at Seaside Park Beach with his girlfriend but returned to his truck when they realized a storm was approaching, Police Sgt. Andrew Casole said Wednesday. His girlfriend told police she waited in the truck while Dispoto went back to the beach to warn others that a storm was coming. \u201cHe said, \u2018I\u2019ll be right back.\u2019 I said, \u2018You have no business going back.\u2019 And he says, \u2018I\u2019m just going to warn these kids because the sky is going to open. I\u2019m just going to warn these kids \u2013 one minute.\u2019 I said, \u2018No,\u2019\u201d Ruth Fussell, who identified herself as Dispoto\u2019s girlfriend, told CNN\u2019s affiliate\u00a0WABC. Fussell said she called Dispoto three times but he didn\u2019t respond, and she waited about 15 minutes for his return. She eventually went back to the beach where she found Dispoto unconscious. Emergency responders performed CPR on Dispoto and he was taken to a hospital where he was later pronounced dead, police said. Dispoto died by an \u201caccidental death caused by lightning strike,\u201d Casole said. Days after Dispoto\u2019s death, Seaside Park installed a lightning warning system. In April, Seaside Park officials purchased the Strike Guard Lightning Detection System, an investment of nearly $50,000, Seaside Park Borough Administrator Karen Kroon told CNN Wednesday. The system provides lightning warnings by monitoring cloud and cloud-to-ground lightning\u00a0strikes\u00a0within a radius set by the user of up to 20 miles,\u00a0according to the\u00a0company\u2019s website. Kroon said the installation, which had been in preparation for months, was scheduled to take place Wednesday. Kroon emphasized that the installation was not in response to the tragedy on Sunday. \u201cThe Borough made that investment because public safety is extremely important and we want to do everything we can to alert our residents and visitors to imminent danger,\u201d Kroon said. According to the\u00a0National Lightning Safety Council, this is the third lightning death in the United States this year, and the first death in New Jersey since 2021 when a lifeguard was struck and killed on a beach in South Seaside Park. Since 2006, New Jersey has had 16 lightning deaths, five were on beaches. Fussell told WABC that Dispoto never passed up an opportunity to make someone\u2019s life easier and that\u2019s what she wants people to know. \u201cSo, his last act of heroism was his ultimate, and that\u2019s my Patrick Dispoto,\u201d Fussell said.

{"id": "2024_06_26_business_economy-election-presidential-debate", "text": "Bill Clinton\u2019s campaign was right on the money when it coined the famous \u201cIt\u2019s the economy, stupid\u201d phrase in 1992. That\u2019s because the economy has consistently ranked among the top \u2014 if not the very top \u2014 voter issues in presidential election after presidential election. The current contest is far from an exception, with close to 90% of respondents in a May ABC News/Ipsos poll indicating that the economy is the most important issue in determining who gets their vote in November. That means it\u2019s all but guaranteed to be a major talking point during Thursday night\u2019s debate, which kicks off at 9 pm ET on CNN. President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump have polar opposite views on the economy \u2014 and both undoubtedly will try to sell you on their visions, policies and records. To make heads or tails of what they say (or if you\u2019re trying to impress anyone you might be watching the debate with), it\u2019s good to make sure you understand the economy we\u2019re in right now. Disclaimer: The topics below are in no way an exhaustive list of everything going on in the US economy, plus, everyone experiences it differently. Unemployment: Low, but with warning signs ahead The nation\u2019s unemployment rate stayed below 4% for 27 months, its longest such streak and a match for a period in the 1960s. That streak ended last month, when the unemployment rate rose to 4% from 3.9%. At the same time, the number of job openings in the US recently fell to a new three-year low, another sign of cooling in the labor market. That means job seekers might find it harder to get hired. In particular, the job market for recent college graduates has weakened. The unemployment rate for bachelor\u2019s degree recipients aged 20 to 29 is above 12%, an almost four-percentage-point increase from a year ago, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data. Inflation: Elevated, but cooling Inflation slowed more than expected last month, falling to 3.3% from 3.4% in April. By comparison, at this time last year it was 4%, and two years ago it was 9%. But there\u2019s a reason why you\u2019re probably feeling like everything is still really expensive. While discounts are starting to appear more at big-box retailers like Target and Walmart and fast-food giants like McDonald\u2019s and Wendy\u2019s, price cuts aren\u2019t occurring across the board. That\u2019s because when inflation cools off, it simply means that the pace of price increases is slowing. However, it does not mean that the actual prices we pay for goods and services are lower than they were a year ago. Housing: Still unaffordable Home prices are at a record high and have been climbing for 11 straight months as housing shortages persist. That\u2019s partly because many homeowners who locked in ultra-low mortgages during the pandemic don\u2019t want to move and risk having to pay a much higher mortgage rate. Average 30-year fixed-rate mortgages recently hit the highest level of the year. While they\u2019ve started to fall, mortgage rates are still higher than anything seen in the decade before 2022. Mortgage rates are so high in part because inflation is above the Fed\u2019s 2% target. As a result, the central bank has held off cutting interest rates, which would otherwise make it cheaper to get a mortgage. In turn, many would-be homebuyers are renting for longer than they otherwise may have, which is driving rents higher, too.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/26/business/economy-election-presidential-debate/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_25_us_patrick-braxton-newbern-alabama-mayor-settlement-reaj", "text": "The town of Newbern, Alabama and a\u00a0Black man who was prevented from becoming the town\u2019s mayor\u00a0after winning his 2020 election, have reached a proposed settlement, according to federal court documents. Patrick Braxton will officially become mayor of Newbern once the court approves the settlement \u2013\u00a0 the first Black person to hold the position in the town\u2019s 166-year history. Newbern is about an hour drive from Selma in the western part of Alabama and has a population of 133, according to the\u00a02020 Census. After being sworn in as mayor, Braxton was later denied full access to the office by the man who was mayor before him, Haywood Stokes III, who is White, and the majority-White city council, according to a lawsuit. Braxton along with four residents he wanted to appoint to a new city council and the\u00a0NAACP\u2019s Legal Defense Fund\u00a0filed an amended complaint to force the town to honor the election. Although \u201ca factual dispute exists regarding who has lawful authority to serve as mayor and town councilmembers,\u201d according to the settlement, signed\u00a0June 21, the parties now agree \u201cBraxton is the lawful mayor of Newbern, and he shall hold all the powers, privileges, duties \u2026 entrusted to the mayor of Newbern under Alabama state law.\u201d The settlement does not require that the defendants admit to any wrongdoing and specifically notes that they \u201cdeny having engaged in any wrongful practice, or other unlawful conduct.\u201d Leah Wong, an attorney with the Legal Defense Fund who represented the plaintiffs, called the outcome of the settlement positive because \u201cthe town will be able to move forward.\u201d \u201cMost of the Black residents still recognized (Braxton) as mayor \u2026,\u201d Wong said. \u201cIt is a shame that he had to fight for his right to actually execute his duties for the last four years.\u201d CNN has reached out to Braxton and the town of Newbern for comment. Under the settlement, Braxton has 14 days after the effective date to submit names of residents to the Alabama governor he wants the state to appoint as town council members.\u00a0If Alabama Governor Kay Ivey\u00a0does not appoint people to fill the town council positions, Braxton must hold a special election on December 31, 2024. Braxton, along with his new town council, will also be responsible for conducting the regularly scheduled elections set for 2025. The settlement states the town agrees to pay the attorney fees of the plaintiffs which will come from town funds. And the town\u2019s finances will be independently audited by an entity jointly agreed upon by Stokes and Braxton. A lifelong Newbern resident and volunteer firefighter, Braxton previously told CNN he decided to challenge the status quo\u00a0in his town\u00a0and run for mayor. He asserted in the lawsuit the mayor and town council were not responding to the needs of Newbern\u2019s majority Black community, CNN previously reported. The town had not held a mayoral election since at least 1965, when the Voting Rights Act became law, according to the lawsuit. \u00a0According to court records, the voting age population in Newbern is 64.3 percent Black and 34.8 White. According to the lawsuit, \u201cto prevent Braxton from appointing a majority black Town council, the Defendants \u2026 agreed to hold a secret meeting and adopt resolutions to conduct a special election,\u201d \u00a0CNN previously reported. At the meeting, Braxton\u2019s lawsuit claims Stokes set a special election date for the council, \u201cbecause the council members had allegedly \u2018forgotten\u2019 to qualify as candidates for the 2020 municipal elections.\u201d Braxton and the people he appointed as councilors say in the lawsuit\u00a0that\u00a0no notice of a special election was published and the only people to file to run were Stokes and former council members Gary Broussard, Jesse Donald Leverett, Voncille Brown Thomas and Willie Richard Tucker. And as they were the only candidates for the October 6 special election, they won by default. The lawsuit claimed the locks on the town hall were changed so Braxton could not get in, adding he was denied access to the post office box used for official mail, and a local bank would not let him see the town accounts. \u201cPatrick Braxton accomplished something no other Black resident of the City of Newbern had ever accomplished since the city\u2019s founding in 1854: he was duly elected Mayor of the City,\u201d the lawsuit claimed. \u201cHowever, the minority White residents of the city, long accustomed to exercising total control over city government, refused to accept this outcome.\u201d In court filings, the defendants said there was no conspiracy and no racial discrimination, CNN reported. CNN\u2019s Meridith Edwards and Rachel Clarke contributed to this report.\u00a0", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/25/us/patrick-braxton-newbern-alabama-mayor-settlement-reaj/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "us"}}
