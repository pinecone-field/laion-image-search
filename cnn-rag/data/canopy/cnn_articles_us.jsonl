{"id": "2024_07_08_politics_joe-biden-house-democrats", "text": "President Joe Biden told congressional Democrats in a letter on Monday that he will continue his reelection bid despite mounting concerns about his mental fitness and the viability of his campaign, while also hitting back at party \u201celites\u201d in an interview ahead of a critical week on Capitol Hill. \u201cI want you to know that despite all the speculation in the press and elsewhere, I am firmly committed to staying in this race, to running this race to the end, and to beating Donald Trump,\u201d Biden wrote in the letter, obtained by CNN. Biden sought to put growing concerns about his viability to rest in the forcefully worded letter. \u201cThe question of how to move forward has been well-aired for over a week now. And it\u2019s time for it to end. We have one job. And that is to beat Donald Trump. We have 42 days to the Democratic Convention and 119 days to the general election. Any weakening of resolve or lack of clarity about the task ahead only helps Trump and hurts us,\u201d Biden concluded. \u201cIt is time to come together, move forward as a unified party, and defeat Donald Trump.\u201d It\u2019s a critical week for Biden\u2019s political future as he seeks to tamp down intensifying fallout with the House and Senate back in session for the first time since the debate. More than a handful of top House Democrats told Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries on Sunday that Biden needs to step aside amid concerns about down-ballot Democratic races. Shortly after the letter was released, Biden called into MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe,\u201d part of a strategy to do more \u201coff-the-cuff,\u201d unscripted engagements to quell concerns about his age. But the appearance, while energetic, may not have had its intended impact. Biden offered a lengthy and occasionally off-topic response to a question about his letter to Hill Democrats calling for unity and lambasted Trump for being on the golf course after the debate. Trump has largely stayed under the radar while Biden battles the news cycle. \u201cWell look \u2014 Democrats \u2014 Joe, let me say it this way, the reason I\u2019ve been on the road so much, all over the country, while Trump is riding around in a golf cart, filling out his golf cart before, golf cart before he even hits the ball \u2014 but anyway, he hasn\u2019t been anywhere in 10 days, I\u2019ve been all over the country, No. 1,\u201d he said. He continued: \u201cAnd I\u2019ve gone over the country for several reasons, one, to make sure my instinct was right about the party still wanting me to be the nominee. And all the data, all the data shows that the average Democrat out there who voted, 14 million of them who\u2019ve voted for me, still want me to be the nominee, No. 1.\u201d And in a pointed rebuke to his critics, Biden said, \u201cI\u2019m getting so frustrated by the elites. Now, I\u2019m not talking about you guys, but by the elites in the party. They know so much more. But if any of these guys don\u2019t think I should run, run against me. Go ahead. Announce \u2014 announce for president. Challenge me at the convention.\u201d Critical week ahead on Capitol Hill The president will continue his outreach to Democratic lawmakers this week, a campaign official tells CNN. Tuesday will be a consequential day as members are set hold a planned caucus meeting with Jeffries, and one member told CNN they anticipate that is the day when the dam will break. Two sources told CNN that the meeting, the first time Democrats are gathering as a caucus since the June 27 debate, will be limited to members only and phones are not expected to be permitted inside. Biden will meet virtually with the Congressional Black Caucus Monday night, two sources told CNN. The CBC is arguably the president\u2019s strongest group of support on Capitol Hill and is a key group for him heading into Tuesday\u2019s Democratic caucus meeting. NBC News was first to report on the meeting with the CBC. In the week following his disastrous debate performance, Biden personally reached out to roughly 20 House Democrats, a campaign official tells CNN, and has spoken with party leaders \u2014 including Jeffries, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Reps. Nancy Pelosi and James Clyburn \u2014 with a goal of reassuring them that the concerns within the party are being heard. Since then, Jeffries, Schumer and Clyburn have voiced support for Biden. Despite divisions in his caucus about Biden\u2019s viability in November, Jeffries insisted on Monday that he is still behind the president. \u201cYes, I made clear the day after the debate, publicly, that I support President Joe Biden and the Democratic ticket,\u201d Jeffries told CNN\u2019s Manu Raju when asked about Biden. \u201cMy position has not changed.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m for Joe,\u201d Schumer told reporters when he arrived at the Capitol Monday and was asked if he supports the president continuing his race for reelection. He would not answer if he has any questions about Biden\u2019s mental and physical ability to lead the nation for four more years. Pelosi has said the questions surrounding Biden\u2019s disastrous performance at the presidential debate were \u201clegitimate.\u201d Asked about Pelosi\u2019s comments, Biden told ABC News, \u201cit was a bad episode. No indication of any serious condition. I was exhausted.\u201d Several House Democrats have already publicly called for Biden to drop out of the presidential race, with Washington state Rep. Adam Smith becoming the latest to do so Monday afternoon. \u201cWell, look, I think he should step aside,\u201d he told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper on \u201cThe Lead.\u201d \u201cI think it\u2019s become clear that he\u2019s not the best person to carry the Democratic message. And here\u2019s the thing: We have an incredibly strong message and record to run on. And all respect to the president, he\u2019s done a great job.\u201d But Smith added: \u201cWe\u2019ve got a good message. The president has shown he is not capable of delivering that message in an effective way.\u201d On a call with senior House Democrats convened Sunday by Jeffries, Smith was one of a half-dozen lawmakers who voiced their own concerns during a conversation one aide described to CNN as \u201cpretty brutal.\u201d Those lawmakers \u2014 which CNN has reported to include Reps. Smith, Jerry Nadler, Mark Takano and Joe Morelle \u2014 represent the highest-ranking Democrats on the Armed Services, Judiciary, Veterans Affairs and House Administration committees. A campaign official declined to say whether the president had spoken directly with Sen. Mark Warner, the Virginia Democrat who organized a concurrent effort among like-minded senators to explore the possibility of an official request for Biden to step aside. Warner canceled a follow-up meeting scheduled for Monday evening, a source tells CNN, after news of the group\u2019s efforts leaked. The next meeting will be Tuesday with Senate Democrats and their leadership. Biden told ABC News that Warner was a \u201cgood man\u201d but has a \u201cdifferent perspective.\u201d Biden\u2019s campaign on Monday highlighted a list of supportive statements from Hill Democrats, seeking to amplify the voices who have expressed confidence in the president\u2019s candidacy in recent days. Biden team hosted another top donor call Also on Monday, the Biden campaign hosted a donor call with its national finance committee, another sign of outreach. A top concern of the campaign is whether donors will continue to back Biden or redirect their money to House and Senate campaign efforts if he stays in the race. Biden said he is not exiting the race and that he believes he\u2019s still the best candidate to beat Trump, three participants told CNN. \u201cMy one job is to beat Donald Trump,\u201d Biden said, according to one of the participants on the call, who said Biden thanked donors and renewed his pledge to keep the fight alive. A second participant said of the president\u2019s determination to continue running: \u201cHe ain\u2019t budging an inch.\u201d Campaign chair Jen O\u2019Malley Dillon lead the call, which had more than 300 participants, and Maryland Gov. Wes Moore offered a fiery defense of the president, the participants told CNN. Moore was among the governors who met with Biden at the White House last week, telling reporters after the meeting he supports the president but acknowledged the concerns from voters. During the question-and-answer portion of the call, Biden fielded a question from a donor about what he needs to do in the second debate \u2014 currently scheduled for September 10 \u2014 to perform better than the first debate, where 51 million Americans watched his meandering and low-energy performance. Biden, dressed in a suit and flanked by an American flag and family photographs, outlined the strategy simply, two participants said: \u201cAttack, attack, attack.\u201d DNC Finance Chair Chris Korge, who was among the final speakers on the call, was \u201cbegging us to stay in line,\u201d one of the participants said. Biden struck a defiant note on a call with donors, emphasizing that the party needs to shift the narrative back to Trump and the important issues at stake in November. There was a fair amount of discussion, according to one donor on the call, on \u201cProject 2025.\u201d Biden made clear how damaging Trump\u2019s agenda would be across the board, including for the economy, women and the LGBTQ community, one donor said. Biden also smiled on screen when one donor said she would crawl through glass for him. Another participant on the call, who has been critical of Biden and his campaign over the past week, praised the president\u2019s words on Monday and said the campaign seemed to \u201cfinally\u201d grasp the seriousness of the moment. The ultimate test, this donor said, would be whether congressional leaders urge Biden to reconsider this week and whether the battleground map showed any signs of expanding or if the president\u2019s support eroded in campaign polling this week following the long July 4 holiday weekend. \u201cIt\u2019s still a huge hole to climb out of,\u201d the Democratic donor said, speaking on condition of anonymity to avoid alienating the campaign. \u201cIt was already a steep hill to climb to victory.\u201d This story has been updated with additional developments and reporting.

{"id": "2024_07_04_us_south-padre-island-shark-bites", "text": "Several people were bitten by sharks in separate attacks at Texas and Florida beaches on the Fourth of July, authorities said. A 26-year-old man was bitten by a shark off New Smyrna Beach, Florida, on Friday, the second shark bite reported on the Florida beach during the Independence Day holiday week. The man, visiting from Sarasota, was bitten around 4:15 p.m. Friday on his left foot while floating in an inner tube in water 5 feet deep, according to Tamra Malphurs, interim director for Volusia County Beach Safety Ocean Rescue. He was transported to the hospital for further treatment. This bite came almost 24 hours after a 21-year-old from Ohio was bitten at New Smyrna Beach while playing football in knee-deep water Thursday afternoon,\u00a0according to Volusia County Beach Safety Ocean Rescue. Both men\u2019s injuries were not life-threatening, Malphurs said. In Texas, four people encountered a shark as they took to the waters off South Padre Island on the Independence Day holiday. \u201cDetails at this time indicate that two people were bitten and two people encountered the shark but were not seriously injured,\u201d the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department said in a statement. The two bite victims were taken to Valley Regional Medical Center in Brownsville, where one is being treated and the other has been flown out for further treatment, the department said. The third person was injured \u2013 but not seriously \u2013 while trying to assist one of the bite victims, the department told CNN. It is unclear exactly how they were hurt. Another beachgoer said they felt a shark brush against them as it swam by, the department said. \u201cShark encounters of this nature are not a common occurrence in Texas,\u201d the statement noted. \u201cWhen bites from sharks do occur, they are usually a case of mistaken identity by sharks looking for food.\u201d Earlier, Texas Parks and Wildlife Department Game Warden Captain Chris Dowdy told CNN affiliate KRGV at least four shark-related incidents had been reported at South Padre Island. The attacks were likely associated with the same shark, which later swam to open waters, he said. Two off-duty Border Patrol agents from the Search, Trauma and Rescue Unit pulled one of the victims out of the water and applied a tourniquet to their leg, according to a US Customs and Border Protection official. \u201cOur hearts and prayers are with the injured and their families, and we hope for a speedy recovery,\u201d South Padre Island Mayor Patrick McNulty said. One of the attacks was reported to the South Padre Island Police Department at 11 a.m., the city\u2019s Public Information Officer Nikki Soto told CNN. Officers provided immediate treatment and transported the male victim to a hospital, Soto said. South Padre Island Beach authorities have been patrolling the shoreline and using drones to watch for the shark, she said. Nereyda Bazaldua told CNN her daughter was one of those bitten Thursday. Bazaldua said her two teenage daughters were in shallow, knee-deep water near the shore playing on boogie boards when they began screaming, \u201cShark!\u201d When her 18-year-old daughter Victoria came out of the water, Bazaldua said she \u201ccould see some blood coming down her leg,\u201d Bazaldua said. Thankfully, she said, Victoria\u2019s injuries were minor. \u201cThe shark pushed into her, five to six of his teeth scratched her leg,\u201d Bazaldua said. \u201cThe wounds aren\u2019t deep.\u201d She said the shark lingered in the water for 20 to 30 minutes before moving along. \u201cWe never saw the shark \u2018til he was right there with them,\u201d Balzadua said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t choppy water, and the seas were calm. He showed up out of nowhere.\u201d A Texas Department of Public Safety helicopter flew low over South Padre Island and used deterrence measures to keep the shark from getting close to shore after the encounters, a spokesperson said. \u201cThe Texas Department of Public Safety\u2019s Aircraft Division responded to South Padre Island to assist local authorities with a shark attack,\u201d Lt. Chris Olivarez said. Olivarez shared with CNN video taken from the helicopter that showed a shark lurking in the waters and swimming against the waves Thursday afternoon. \u201cDPS remained on scene until the shark was no longer a threat,\u201d Olivarez said. According to the International Shark Attack File, run out of the University of Florida, there have been fewer than 10 shark bites reported in Texas since 2012. This places the Lone Star State behind Florida, which has had 259 reported bites; Hawaii, which has had 76; South Carolina, which has had 45; North Carolina, which has had 31; and California, which has had 29. South Padre Island is about 100 miles from Padre Island National Seashore, at the opposite end of what used to be one continuous island, according to the National Park Service. Padre Island (also known as North Padre Island) is the longest stretch of undeveloped barrier island in the world, with 70 miles of protected coastline, the park service said. It divides the Gulf of Mexico from the Laguna Madre.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/04/us/south-padre-island-shark-bites/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/09/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_07_08_business_free-medical-school-tuition", "text": "Bloomberg Philanthropies is gifting $1 billion to make medical school free for the majority of students at Johns Hopkins University, joining other high-profile donors who have contributed to tuition-free medical schools across the country. In a letter by Michael Bloomberg in the Bloomberg Philanthropies\u2019 annual report, the billionaire said the donation addresses twin challenges: declining health and declining education. Johns Hopkins said Monday that for most medical school students, the gift will cover the full cost of attendance, including tuition and living expenses. Students from families earning less than $300,000 will be eligible for the gift. Living expenses will be covered for students who come from families that earn less than $175,000. It\u2019s not the first medical school to receive such a gift. In February, students at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York received free tuition after a $1 billion dollar donation from a former faculty member, Dr. Ruth Gottesman. In 2018, NYU\u2019s School of Medicine became the\u00a0first medical school in the country\u00a0to offer free tuition to accepted students. In the letter, Bloomberg, a Johns Hopkins alumnus, said life expectancy in the US is still lagging behind other countries since the Covid-19 pandemic. The pandemic also hurt public education, Bloomberg said, noting that \u201cremote schooling was a disaster for students.\u201d The high cost of medical school deters students from lower-income families from applying, the former New York City mayor said. He added that confronting this \u201chealth crisis\u201d should unite both political parties. An\u00a0October survey\u00a0from the Association of American Medical Colleges found that 70% of medical students who graduated in 2023 have taken on some level of education debt. The average graduate left medical school owing more than $200,000, according to the AAMC. \u201cMany who do matriculate end up dropping out because of financial pressures. And those who graduate often choose to work in the most lucrative specialties in order to repay their debts, rather than in fields and communities that are most in need,\u201d Bloomberg said, adding there are too few primary care doctors in the US. Bloomberg previously donated $1.8 billion in 2018 to undergraduate financial aid at Johns Hopkins University.

{"id": "2024_07_08_us_patriot-front-white-nationalist-group", "text": "With their faces concealed behind white cloths and sunglasses, dozens of protesters marched down the streets of downtown Nashville this weekend, chanting \u201cSieg Heil\u201d and \u201cDeportation saves the nation,\u201d according to a statement from the Tennessee Democratic Party. \u201cReclaim America,\u201d one banner at the front of the group read. Behind it, uniformed marchers in dark shirts and khaki-colored pants hoisted a plethora of Confederate and historic US flags, with some of the American flags turned upside down. Their attire and tactics are hallmarks of the Patriot Front white supremacist group, with which the protesters are believed to be affiliated. And they\u2019re just part of a multifaceted shift in political rhetoric purportedly aiming to drastically reshape America during this crucial presidential election cycle. While \u201cno criminal activity took place\u201d during the Nashville rally, police said, the demonstration drew disdain from local critics. \u201cJust two days after celebrating the independence of our nation, white supremacists have taken to the streets of Nashville carrying Confederate flags and chanting \u2018deportation saves the nation\u2019 and \u2018Sieg Heil,\u2019\u201d the Tennessee Democratic Party said in a statement posted on X Saturday night. \u201cThis is what we\u2019re fighting against in Tennessee,\u201d state party chair Hendrell Remus said in the statement. \u201cThis is what we\u2019re fighting against in America.\u201d While bystanders were stunned to see the White nationalist demonstration in Nashville, protests linked to the Patriot Front have popped up across the country, including in Boston on Independence Day weekend two years ago. Here\u2019s what we know about the clandestine group: How did Patriot Front start? Patriot Front \u201cis a white nationalist hate group that\u00a0formed in the aftermath of the deadly \u2018Unite the Right\u2019 rally\u00a0in Charlottesville, Virginia,\u201d according to the Southern Poverty Law Center. \u201cThe organization broke off from Vanguard America (VA), a neo-Nazi group that participated in the chaotic demonstration,\u201d the SPLC website adds. The 2017 rally turned deadly when counterprotester Heather Heyer was killed. Later that month, Thomas Ryan Rousseau, who\u00a0led Vanguard America members\u00a0at \u201cUnite the Right,\u201d rebranded the group\u2019s website and launched a new group called Patriot Front, according to the Anti-Defamation League. CNN has reached out to an attorney who has represented the Patriot Front\u2019s leader for comment. What do Patriot Front members believe? \u201cMembers of the white supremacist group Patriot Front believe that their ancestors conquered America and bestowed it to them, and no one else,\u201d according to\u00a0the ADL. \u201cPatriot Front defines itself as an organization of \u201cAmerican nationalists,\u201d justifying its hate and intolerance under the guise of preserving America\u2019s identity as a \u201cPan-European nation,\u201d the ADL adds. The group\u2019s manifesto claims those in America who are not of European ancestry are not truly American. \u201cTo be an American is to be a descendant of conquerors, pioneers, visionaries, and explorers. This unique identity was given to us by our ancestors, and this national spirit remains firmly rooted in our blood,\u201d the Patriot Front\u2019s manifesto states. \u201cNationhood cannot be bestowed upon those who are not of the founding stock of our people, and those who do not share the common spirit that permeates our greater civilization, and the European diaspora,\u201d the manifesto adds. Earlier this year, an attorney defending the Patriot Front group in a civil lawsuit told a federal judge in an oral argument that its members are not white supremacists. Rather, he suggested they are white separatists of the \u201cgood fences make good neighbors variety,\u201d according to a written decision from the judge. After reviewing the group\u2019s website and manifesto, which calls for \u201cthe formation of a white ethnostate,\u201d the judge concluded that she \u201ccannot reasonably infer that Patriot Front seeks separation for any reason other than white supremacy.\u201d What are the goals of Patriot Front? \u201cI think when you look at the past actions of the Patriot Front, they\u2019re varied,\u201d former FBI Deputy Assistant Director Peter Strzok said in 2022, shortly after a similar group of protesters demonstrated near a Pride parade in Idaho. \u201cA lot of what they do is designed for image \u2013 for creating propaganda that they can use to spread their message to recruit more followers,\u201d Strzok told CNN. \u201cSo in the past, what we\u2019ve seen from a lot of their activities (is) not so much intent on engaging in violence as much as engaging in protests. Certainly, hateful speech, for sure, but this is much more a group that\u2019s designed for image and for creating a public spectacle.\u201d Strzok said the emergence of the\u00a0\u201creplacement theory\u201d has played into White nationalist propaganda, and \u201cI think that\u2019s encouraging or accepting behavior that in the past we had moved away from.\u201d But Strzok said there\u2019s always a key question with such groups: \u201cIs there a trigger point where their intention is to move from simply protesting to violence?\u201d How is Patriot Front different from other White nationalist or White supremacist groups? Members of Patriot Front are \u201ccomparatively young,\u201d Strzok said. \u201cA central tactic to Patriot Front is \u2018flash demonstrations\u2019 \u2013 privately planned and unannounced events that allow groups to promote their beliefs while limiting the risk of individual exposure, negative media coverage, arrests and public backlash,\u201d according to\u00a0the ADL. \u201cThese flash demonstrations are mainly orchestrated for a quick photo and video opportunity that is then turned into online content.\u201d And Patriot Front \u201chas declined to participate in large rallies with other hate groups,\u00a0preferring instead to work with small, local chapters that allow Patriot Front to remain the center of attention\u00a0while controlling their message and presentation,\u201d according to the SPLC.

{"id": "2024_07_05_us_north-dakota-train-derailment", "text": "A train derailed in North Dakota early Friday morning and several cars carrying hazardous material are still on fire, according to local authorities. Foster County Emergency Management Director Andrew Kirking told CNN 911 was notified about the train derailment in the small town of Bordulac, about 140 miles northwest of Fargo, between 3:30 a.m. and 4 a.m. local time. Kirking said the train was carrying \u201cintact hazardous materials,\u201d so authorities have been monitoring air quality near the incident. Between 25 and 30 cars derailed. The North Dakota Department of Environmental Quality told CNN the train was carrying anhydrous ammonia, sulfur and methanol. Anhydrous ammonia, a gas widely used as a nitrogen-based fertilizer, can be extremely dangerous in high quantities, triggering explosions and causing dehydration and severe burns in humans, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In a\u00a0Facebook post, the department said it is monitoring the remediation and cleanup of the derailment. Kirking added local crews, including the Carrington Fire Department, regional hazardous material officials and Canadian Pacific also responded to the scene. Crews will work through the night Friday to extinguish the fires, cool the rail cars and remove hazardous material from them, Kirking said in a statement. They\u2019re also preparing the site for heavy equipment to remove the rail\u00a0cars. The county is working to keep residents safe, stabilize the incident and minimize environmental impact, Kirking said Friday night. Canadian Pacific Kansas City, the train operator, said in a statement provided Friday to CNN the company \u201cis continuing its comprehensive, coordinated response\u201d to the derailment in collaboration with local officials. The statement continued: \u201cCPKC response crews, including senior officers from our operations, environmental and hazardous materials teams, are on scene coordinating closely with emergency response officials. The safety of the public and emergency responders is CPKC\u2019s first priority.\u201d Crews are trying to bridge a gap over a bog to fight the fires and get heavy equipment to move the train cars, Kirking told CNN. They used two pumping trailers to douse the derailed\u00a0cars, he said. \u201cOur objective is to get the fire out in the next 12 to 18 hours,\u201d Kirking said. \u201cWe are starting to get a little water on it right now.\u201d Kirking said getting the train cars removed will be a bit more tedious and will likely take more than a week or two. He said all residents within a one-mile radius of the derailment were notified of the incident and potential hazards. Consequently, Kirking said, they have issued a voluntary evacuation. The cause of the derailment is still under investigation, he said, adding the engineer and conductor were the only people on board the train and they escaped safely. \u201cRight now, based on the elevation, we think that the spill material can be contained around those railroad tracks and will not impact any water source,\u201d Kirking said.

{"id": "2024_07_05_us_nashville-school-shooter-writings", "text": "The writings of the person who\u00a0killed three 9-year-olds and three adults\u00a0at a private Christian elementary school in Nashville last year cannot be released to the public, a judge ruled Thursday. Chancery Court Judge I\u2019Ashea Myles found that The Covenant School children and parents hold the copyright to any writings or other works created by shooter Audrey Hale, a former student who was killed by police. Hale\u2019s parents inherited the works and then transferred ownership to the families. Myles ruled that \u201cthe original writings, journals, art, photos and videos created by Hale\u201d are subject to an exception to the Tennessee Public Records Act created by the federal Copyright Act. The ruling comes more than a year after several groups filed public records requests for documents seized by Metro Nashville Police during their investigation into the\u00a0March 2023 shooting. The shooter left behind at least 20 journals, a suicide note and a memoir, according to court filings. When the records requests were denied, several parties sued, and the situation quickly ballooned into a messy mix of conspiracy theories,\u00a0leaked documents, probate battles and\u00a0accusations of ethical misconduct. Myles\u2019 order will almost surely be appealed. After the initial records requests last year, police said they would eventually release the documents but could not do so right away because their investigation was still open. The groups suing for the immediate release of the records \u2014 including news outlets, a gun rights group, a law enforcement nonprofit and Tennessee state Sen. Todd Gardenhire \u2014 argued that there was no meaningful criminal investigation underway since Hale, who police say acted alone, was dead. Meanwhile, a group of Covenant parents was allowed to intervene in the case and argue that the records should never become public. They said the release would be traumatic for the families and could inspire copycat attacks. As part of the effort to keep the records closed, Hale\u2019s parents transferred ownership of Hale\u2019s property to the parents\u2019 group. Attorneys for the parents then argued they owned the copyright, further reason the records could not be released. Also intervening in the case were The Covenant School and the Covenant Presbyterian Church, which shares a building. They argued the records should remain closed because their release could threaten their security. Part of the interest in the records stems from the fact that Hale, who police say was \u201cassigned female at birth,\u201d may have identified as a transgender man. Republican Sen. Josh Hawley, of Missouri, is among those who have promoted a theory that the shooting was a hate crime against Christians. The delay in releasing the writings fueled speculation \u2014 particularly in conservative circles \u2014 over what they might contain and conspiracy theories about why police wouldn\u2019t immediately release them. As the court case has dragged on, pages from one journal were\u00a0leaked to a conservative commentator\u00a0who posted them to social media in November. More recently, The Tennessee Star\u00a0published dozens of stories\u00a0based on allegedly 80 pages of Hale\u2019s writings provided by an unnamed source. The publication is among the plaintiffs, and Myles briefly threatened to hold the paper\u2019s editor-in-chief, Michael Leahy, and owner, Star News Digital Media, in contempt.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/05/us/nashville-school-shooter-writings/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/09/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_07_08_us_chicago-shootings-july-fourth-weekend", "text": "Gun violence is down across America this year but it peaks every summer and Chicago\u2019s Fourth of July weekend bore the data out, with 109 people shot, including 19 fatally, police said in a Monday news conference. All of the victims were boys and men ranging in age from 16 to 36 years old, according to police records. This year\u2019s violent holiday weekend comes as the city and the nation have seen a drop in gun violence in recent years. As of June 24, Chicago had seen 1,105 shooting incidents so far this year, a 6% reduction from the same time last year and a 12% reduction over the past two years. The city had seen 271 gun deaths as of June 24, a 12% reduction since the same time last year and 16% reduction of the past two years, according to data from the Chicago Police Department. Last year over the long holiday weekend, 57 people were shot and eight were killed between Friday, June 30 at 6 p.m. and Tuesday, July 4 at 11:59 p.m., according to Chicago police. July 4 is the peak day for mass shootings in the US, more than any other single calendar day over roughly a decade, a 2023 CNN analysis of the Gun Violence Archive\u2019s mass shooting data since 2014\u00a0found. The day with the second most shootings was July 5. Gun violence is a \u2018societal issue\u2019 In the United States, law enforcement statistics and independent researchers have continually pointed to summer months as a time of increased gun violence, with July 1-7 being an especially violent period each year for both mass shootings and individual incidents. Heat, experts say, can elevate discomfort and aggression\u00a0\u2013 a potential catalyst for violence at a time\u00a0kids are out of school\u00a0and warmer weather drives\u00a0more people outdoors\u00a0in a country with\u00a0more guns than people. \u201cWhen we look at what happened this weekend, we always like to say that it\u2019s a police issue,\u201d Chicago Police Department Superintendent Larry Snelling said at the news conference. \u201cThis is a societal issue. The police cannot be in everybody\u2019s backyard. They cannot be in everyone\u2019s home. They cannot invade every single gathering where there\u2019s a possibility that someone may show up with a gun.\u201d \u201cEveryone needs to be involved in this, this cannot just be the police department alone,\u201d he added. On Friday, after dozens of people had already been shot in Chicago, Mayor Brandon Johnson released a statement addressing the violence. \u201cWe are devastated by the recent violence that has left our city in a state of grief and we extend our heartfelt condolences to the families and communities impacted by these recent events,\u201d Johnson said in the statement. \u201cThe City of Chicago is committed to ensuring the safety of all residents and visitors.\u201d The city had canceled time off for police officers to \u201cmaximize presence and ensure prompt incident response,\u201d activated an emergency services assistance center to provide  support to people in the community and would hold a community rally Friday afternoon to \u201cpromote bonding, support, and healing,\u201d according to Johnson. But the efforts did not end the shootings. Snelling urged public cooperation and tips to lead detectives to suspects, especially those who \u201cmake the choice\u201d to shoot women and children. \u201cThose people have to be taken off the street,\u201d Snelling implored. \u201cThey have to be put away. If we\u2019re not doing that, then we\u2019re failing other families. We\u2019re failing people in our city.\u201d One of those killed over the weekend was an 8-year-old-boy who was shot alongside two other boys, ages 5 and 8, according to the Chicago Police Department\u2019s online records. Several 15- to 16-year-olds were also among those shot over the weekend, police say. In another instance, eight people between the ages of 18 and 74 suffered gunshot wounds and in a separate incident, seven people aged 15 to 40 years old were shot. The 40-year-old died, according to the police department. Officers are training for the upcoming Democratic National Convention next month to be better prepared for potential protests or civil unrest, Snelling said. \u201cAlong with that, we have been working on a neighborhood plan to make sure that we\u2019re not pulling resources that are necessary to keep our neighborhoods safe to place down and around the footprint of the DNC,\u201d he said. \u201cGenerations of disinvestment and deep disenfranchisement\u201d have led to the state of violence within the city, Johnson said during Monday\u2019s news conference. He is pushing for more federal resources to increase intervention and prevention of gun violence, including \u201cmore boots on the ground\u201d to help get illegal guns off the streets. \u201cWe are going block to block, neighborhood by neighborhood, to make sure that the city is safe and ultimately stop this violence,\u201d said Johnson. \u201cThese are not just numbers on pages. These are our fellow Chicagoans.\u201d This story has been updated with additional information.

{"id": "2024_07_08_us_rust-trial-alec-baldwin-producer", "text": "In a significant victory for the defense, Alec Baldwin\u2019s role as a producer on the film \u201cRust\u201d will not be considered during his involuntary manslaughter trial in the fatal on-set shooting of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins, Judge Mary Marlowe Sommer ruled Monday. Baldwin\u2019s position as a producer has consistently been part of the prosecution\u2019s strategy as they have sought to show he had more responsibility and influence on the set than just as an actor. In court Monday, the prosecution said as producer he should have been aware of set safety requirements, while Baldwin\u2019s defense said this evidence was prejudicial and confusing to the jury. In issuing her ruling, the judge admitted she struggled to understand the prosecution\u2019s arguments. \u201cI\u2019m having real difficulty with the state\u2019s position that they want to show that as a producer, he didn\u2019t follow guidelines, and therefore, as an actor, Mr. Baldwin did all these things wrong resulting in the death of Halyna Hutchins because as a producer, he allowed this all to happen,\u201d Marlowe Sommer said. The judge said her decision was impacted by the fact that there were other producers on the film and Baldwin himself was not solely responsible for on set decision-making. \u201cThe probative value is not substantially outweighed by unfair prejudice and certainly confusion of issues to the jury, so I\u2019m denying evidence of his status as a producer,\u201d she concluded. Now, with the judge not allowing evidence related to his role as a producer, the jury will consider Baldwin solely as an actor who was holding the gun as part of his role \u2013 not as the boss or as a supervisor who was responsible for set safety. The decision was one of a number of key evidentiary rulings made during a hearing Monday, just one day before jury selection is set to begin in the case. The trial is expected to last about two weeks. The case stems from the fatal shooting of Hutchins on October 21, 2021, at a New Mexico ranch as they rehearsed the Western film \u201cRust.\u201d Baldwin was practicing a \u201ccross draw\u201d \u2013 pulling a gun from a holster on the opposite side of his body from his draw hand \u2013 with a prop gun when it fired a live round, killing Hutchins and injuring director Joel Souza. Prosecutors charged Baldwin with involuntary manslaughter, saying he was negligent and reckless in his handling of the gun. Baldwin has pleaded not guilty and has said he did not pull the trigger and did not know there were live rounds in the firearm. Hannah Gutierrez Reed, the armorer and props assistant for \u201cRust\u201d who loaded the firearm, was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter in March. She was sentenced to the maximum 18 months in prison. Dave Halls, the assistant director who yelled \u201ccold gun\u201d and handed it to Baldwin, agreed to plead no contest to negligent use of a deadly weapon, the\u00a0district attorney\u2019s office announced in January 2023. Judge allows some videos of Baldwin Other pretrial rulings on Monday dealt with videos of Baldwin\u2019s behavior on set, the relevance of some evidence and whether certain witnesses can testify. In one ruling, the judge determined prosecutors can show videos from the set of Baldwin\u2019s handling of the firearm. Prosecutors have said the videos show him improperly handling the gun, including engaging in horseplay with the revolver and placing his finger on the trigger during scenes where he was not required to shoot the firearm. However, the judge ruled prosecutors cannot introduce videos of him yelling or screaming at people on set, saying they were not relevant to the charge. Prosecutors will be allowed to show video of Hutchins after she was shot and photos of her autopsy, the judge ruled. The defense had argued this evidence would be prejudicial to the jury, but prosecutors said it was necessary to their case. Further, the judge ruled to exclude a letter from about 25 crew members defending the safety on set. The judge said the letter was hearsay and cannot be used as evidence at trial unless one of the trial witnesses participated in the letter. Several other decisions went for the defense. In one, the judge ruled they can question Souza, the director, about his civil lawsuit against Baldwin and question his motives. In another, the judge ruled the defense can seek testimony from Robert Shilling, a former investigator for the prosecution who criticized the quality of the investigation.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/08/us/rust-trial-alec-baldwin-producer/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/09/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_07_03_us_thompson-fire-california-heat-wave", "text": "Thousands have been ordered to evacuate in Northern California due to a wildfire burning in Butte County, as an \u201cexceptionally dangerous and lethal\u201d heat wave in the West ramps up. Soaring temperatures \u2013 which will continue into next week \u2013 have dried out already-parched vegetation, increasing the wildfire risk across the region. Gov. Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency for the area of the fire, clearing the path for additional resources, including the possibility of mobilizing the California National Guard to assist. The\u00a0governor\u2019s proclamation\u00a0cites \u201ccontinued high temperatures throughout the day and night, dry conditions, and strong winds\u201d that have increased the intensity and spread of the fire. A local emergency was also declared, and\u00a0evacuations were ordered\u00a0on Tuesday evening for some residents\u00a0in\u00a0the city of Oroville,\u00a0as the Thompson\u00a0Fire\u00a0continues to burn in\u00a0Butte County, according\u00a0to local officials. Cal Fire said the blaze has grown to more than 3,500 acres and was zero percent contained in an update around noon local time on Wednesday. One of the people who evacuated Tuesday was Arielle Penick, 24, who also left her home from Paradise during the deadly 2018 Camp Fire. On Tuesday afternoon, Penick, who is pregnant, packed up her things in Oroville with her 5-year-old son, her fianc\u00e9 and her fianc\u00e9\u2019s two kids. \u201cWe just see a pummel of smoke in the sky. And the PSTD from the Camp Fire kicked in instantly, especially with how big the cloud of smoke was,\u201d Penick said. \u201cWe gathered as much stuff as we could. Our three dogs, our dog crates, all the dog food, my kids\u2019 favorite toys, all their diapers and wipes, their favorite bedding, their chairs,\u201d she said. Penick is now staying at the home of a friend \u2013 who is also a Camp Fire survivor. 4 firefighters hurt as more than 1,000 battle blaze Four firefighters battling the blaze have been injured, Cal Fire said. More than 1,400 firefighters are working to suppress the flames, along with eight helicopters and numerous air tankers, the agency said. About 13,000 people in\u00a0Butte County, including northeastern parts of Oroville,\u00a0were ordered to evacuate,\u00a0according to the sheriff\u2019s office. Oroville is\u00a0about 65 miles\u00a0north\u00a0of Sacramento with a population of around 15,000. The town sits about 20 miles south of Paradise, where the Camp Fire killed more than 70 people in 2018. Some of the residents impacted by that fire ended up relocating to Oroville. The city of Oroville\u2019s July 4 fireworks celebration was canceled by California State Parks on Wednesday as firefighters continue to battle the fire, the department said in a news release. \u201cDue to the large evacuations and damages caused by the\u00a0Thompson Fire,\u00a0State Parks and partner agencies \u2026 have a large number of resources responding to protect the community and get everyone back home as quickly as possible,\u201d State Parks said. \u201cThese agencies also have employees with families displaced by these evacuations who are tirelessly assisting the community of Lake Oroville.\u201d Red flag warnings are in effect across the West, including in the fire zone, because of extreme heat, gusty winds and low humidity. Already high temperatures will only ramp up Wednesday as an exceptional, long-lasting heat wave begins. Oroville will see\u00a0record temperatures of 110 or more each of the next five days \u2013 Saturday may reach an all-time record high of 113 \u2013 making it that much harder for fire crews to fight the blaze. The\u00a0Basin Fire in Fresno County has\u00a0burned more than 13,000 acres and is currently only 26% contained. \u201cOutdoor burning and especially fireworks are\u00a0not\u00a0recommended,\u201d the\u00a0weather service\u00a0in\u00a0San Francisco warned ahead of the Independence Day holiday. Triple-digit temperatures across parts of US Nationwide, more than 150 million people across at least 22 states in parts of\u00a0the\u00a0Mid-South and West are under heat alerts. The heat wave is \u201cexceptionally dangerous and lethal,\u201d the weather service in San Francisco said, warning \u201can event of this scale, magnitude, and\u00a0longevity will likely rival anything we\u2019ve\u00a0seen\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0last\u00a018\u00a0years\u00a0for\u00a0inland areas.\u201d The heat began Tuesday across parts of\u00a0the\u00a0West, where numerous daily high temperature records were tied or broken: Some cities could swelter through multiple days of temperatures well above 100 degrees with some, including Sacramento, potentially\u00a0seeing a full week of highs over 105 degrees. Most of California outside of\u00a0the\u00a0immediate coastline is under excessive\u00a0heat\u00a0warnings. High temperatures from\u00a0the\u00a0upper 90s to as high as 115 degrees are possible. Las Vegas could\u00a0see\u00a0high temperatures all week over 110 degrees.\u00a0The\u00a0current record is 10 consecutive days set last\u00a0year. Death Valley\u00a0could\u00a0see\u00a0high temperatures at or above 120 degrees all week. Heat\u00a0is expected to spread to\u00a0the\u00a0Northwest and to parts of Arizona\u00a0including Phoenix by\u00a0the\u00a0weekend, where triple-digit temperatures are expected, with parts of Arizona\u00a0seeing highs above 110 degrees. A 10-year-old died Tuesday in Arizona after experiencing a heat-related emergency while hiking with family in South Mountain Park and Preserve, authorities said. First responders performed an active mountain rescue and airlifted the child to the hospital, where he later died, the Phoenix Police Department said. On Saturday, a 69-year-old hiker from Austin, Texas, died at the Grand Canyon, according to the National Park Service. Scott Sims became unconscious on the trail and attempts by bystanders and paramedics to resuscitate him were unsuccessful. Park rangers warn that summertime temperatures on the trail can reach over 120 degrees in the shade and advise not hiking during the day, between the hours of 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. Efforts to assist hikers can be delayed during the summer due to increased need and limited resources, the park service said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/03/us/thompson-fire-california-heat-wave/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/09/2024", "section": "us"}}

The infant has been referred to as \u201cAngel Baby Doe\u201d by the Johnson County Sheriff\u2019s Office since her body was discovered on November 18, 2001. The child was found wrapped in a jacket with her umbilical cord still attached off the side of a road between the towns of Alvarado and Burleson, Texas, south of Fort Worth, the Texas Attorney General\u2019s Office said in a news release Monday. Authorities say she was born alive and likely outside of a medical facility. A person living in the area found the baby as they picked up cans along the side of the road, according to the release. The child died after authorities say the mother, later identified in September 2023 through DNA samples as Shelby Stotts, failed to receive prompt medical care after giving birth and failing to clamp the child\u2019s umbilical cord, which \u201ccaused the child to bleed to death,\u201d the attorney general\u2019s office stated. Stotts was indicted on a second-degree manslaughter charge in relation to Angel Baby Doe\u2019s death, the release stated. CNN was unable to locate contact information for an attorney representing Stotts. Prior to identifying Stotts, investigators had looked into several persons of interest over the past two decades in an attempt to identify the abandoned deceased child. \u201cVarious leads and tips have come in during those years, yet none have revealed her identity,\u201d the Johnson County Sheriff\u2019s Office shared in a 2021 Facebook post about the case. The previously cold case was revived in June 2021 after the Johnson County Sheriff\u2019s Office submitted evidence to forensic genetic genealogy company Othram, according to the release. The company\u2019s team developed a DNA profile for the baby and conducted extensive genetic genealogy research that provided law enforcement with new leads in the case, according to Othram. \u201cUsing this new information, a follow-up investigation was conducted leading investigators to potential relatives of the infant,\u201d the company said in a news release. The investigation led to Stotts being identified as the baby\u2019s mother. \u201cAfter more than twenty years, we are closer to securing justice for Angel Baby Doe and ensuring that the person responsible for this tragedy is held accountable,\u201d Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said in a release. Stotts will be prosecuted under laws that were in effect at the time of the child\u2019s abandonment and death, according to the attorney general\u2019s office. In 1999, Texas was the first US state to enact Baby Moses Laws, or safe haven laws, which allow mothers in crisis to safely give up their babies in safe, designated locations where the child can receive medical care until a permanent home is found, according to the US Department of Health and Human Services.

After exploring their own gender identity, Dorman realized a few years later that they were trans. The pieces started falling into place for Dorman. \u201cAt the same time, I was taking a voice disorders class, and there was just a single bullet point on there about gender-affirming voice work,\u201d they told CNN. \u201cBut that was enough for me to look out on my own and seek further education.\u201d There are different approaches to gender-affirming vocal work. In the sphere of speech language pathology, it\u2019s viewed similarly to the way one would treat voice disorders. Practitioners may also have backgrounds in areas like vocal performance. \u201cTransgender vocal training, as it\u2019s sometimes called, sprung up from a marriage of speech pathologists, singing teachers, theater specialists and their techniques. So it\u2019s this really fascinating blend of science and art,\u201d Dorman explained. Dorman begins by asking each client their goals, and how they want to sound, and then shows them how to use their voice differently by adjusting factors like pitch and tone. In addition to helping to align voices and identities \u2014 possibly avoiding unpleasant questions or interactions \u2014 gender-affirming vocal coaching can also help people move more comfortably through the world, confident enough to do things that seemed too fraught to attempt before. \u201cWe want to know what sounds best to you, what feels most empowering, what helps you participate in activities of daily life that other people take for granted, like being comfortable ordering at a drive-thru or calling a doctor\u2019s office or talking to neighbors,\u201d Dorman said. What it means to change your voice Voice actor Alexis Vandom always had fun with her voice, even as a child. When she began transitioning as an adult, she sought training from several specialized voice coaches to feminize the way she sounded. It was a years-long process with physical and emotional challenges. \u201cI first largely had to focus on getting out of my own way,\u201d Vandom told CNN. \u201cLike many trans femme folks out there, voice training sometimes in and of itself would generate additional dysphoria. I learned to give myself the grace and the space to develop the voice over time.\u201d Since Vandom had a natural ability and interest in voice work, she was able to combine things she learned about voice acting with things she learned specifically about vocal feminization. However, despite Vandom\u2019s experience, the lingo of speech pathology and singing techniques sometimes went over her head. She now has her own voice coaching business, Vandom Voice Academy, where she offers instruction with more accessible language and techniques. Some vocal practices, she says, have fallen out of favor because they could be damaging to the voice long-term. Overtaxing the larynx, for instance, could cause\u00a0vocal tension dystonia, a speech and swallowing disorder. \u201cInstead, many coaches these days may focus on developing muscle memory exercises, so the voice can come naturally and without strain,\u201d she said. In addition to receiving professional training, Vandom also sought out tutorials on YouTube and advice from others with an interest in voice skills. This is a route a lot of trans people go if they can\u2019t afford or find a trained vocal coach. Other professionals CNN spoke with\u00a0cautioned such tutorials could cause damage if used improperly, but for many, Vandom said, it\u2019s the most accessible option. \u201cFor me, changing my voice wasn\u2019t just about my identity. It was a matter of safety. I lived in the South at the time, and I think trans folks who live in places that are especially hostile are moved to develop their voice so they can have interactions without feeling unsafe.\u201d Bryce Chambers, who has an acting and singing background, said he knows a lot of fellow trans people who do work on their own voice without the help of a professional. He was lucky to be connected to a voice coach after college who helped\u00a0 him lower and darken his voice by encouraging diaphragmatic breathing and throat positioning, among other techniques. They weren\u2019t specifically a gender-affirming voice coach, but knew the processes needed to accomplish Chambers\u2019 specific goals. \u201cAny singer or an actor needs to take care of their voice over many years,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cSo concerns about trans or nonbinary people changing their voice in a healthy way are valid but not unique. Lots of people have a need to practice vocal hygiene, staying hydrated and taking vocal rest if they need it.\u201d The fact is, Chambers said, if a transgender person feels the need to change their voice \u2014 whether for personal, social or safety reasons, they\u2019re going to do it. \u201cTrans folk have been altering their voices for as long as they\u2019ve been around, I\u2019m sure,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe some of the processes aren\u2019t ideal, but it\u2019s better than nothing. I just hope we continue to see progress in the field.\u201d How someone changes their voice Anna Freya began her career studying vocal performance, and now teaches both\u00a0singing and gender-affirming vocal methods\u00a0in the Seattle area. When working with the voice, Freya stresses there are many ways to adjust how the throat, mouth, lips and tongue make different sounds. \u201cPitch and pitch range, that is very important,\u201d she said. \u201cThe quality of the voice; bright versus dark; that\u2019s also important. The anatomy and physiology of the voice matters, and in different ways than conventional singing. It\u2019s almost like reverse engineering, looking at the elements of how the voice sounds and which ones need to be swapped out or put together in a different configuration to get a different result.\u201d This work can get very technical, and it carries some of the challenges of other vocal training styles. For instance, to get a brighter, more feminine sound, Freya may encourage clients to reposition their voicebox, or larynx \u2014 something that, short of sticking a hand down one\u2019s throat, is accomplished by communicating how certain things in the throat feel or sound when the client adjusts them, and what muscles are working. \u201cBut so much of sounding feminine in that particular example, or sounding any certain way, is also about how you pronounce things and the cadence of the voice,\u201d Freya said. Dorman takes a similar approach. \u201cThe way that I like to think about it is, we\u2019re modifying the breath flow through the throat, through the larynx where pitch is produced, and then everything above that, like the size and shape of the access area between the mouth and the nose,\u201d they said. \u201cThat\u2019s resonance. And then through that work we can get to a darker, warmer resonance, or a brighter, buzzier, brassier resonance.\u201d Since this kind of coaching is meant to be for life, gender-affirming vocal coaches also place a huge importance on healthy vocal hygiene so clients don\u2019t damage their vocal mechanisms over time or get into uncomfortable habits. This includes practical advice like staying hydrated and avoiding certain actions that tax the voice \u2014 like yelling. Then, there is the larger question of what sounds are associated with gender. \u201cThere\u2019s not just one way to sound feminine. There\u2019s not just one way to sound masculine. And there\u2019s little guidelines on what androgynous even should sound like, so it\u2019s our job to help our clients figure out what they feel empowered by,\u201d Dorman said. \u201cCertainly there are many clients who come in with a specific goal of, say, getting gendered correctly in public. But the problem is, gender is a much more dynamic process. It\u2019s not static, it\u2019s an exchange of information, so everyone comes to conversations with different concepts of what is feminine and masculine.\u201d Why the work is important When Dorman started working with gender-affirming vocal methods, it was 2016 \u2014 just a few years after they noticed conversations about gender identity really opening up in the US.\u00a0There wasn\u2019t a lot there in terms of specific research, networking or practice. \u201cSince then, it has grown so much as more trans people learn that it is an avenue of transition that\u2019s possible, and thankfully the care and diversity of providers have increased over the years,\u201d they said. When looking toward the future, Dorman and Freya said they hope the field of gender-affirming vocal work increases in both the academic sense, with more specific research and training, and in the visible sense, with more providers offering services and finding ways to lessen the financial burden. Freya, who is a lesbian, says gender-affirming work is a skill she can offer to her wider LGBTQ community. \u201cIt was a matter of, \u2018I can help people that have greater disadvantage within the greater LGBT community.\u2019 I feel very fiercely about that,\u201d she said. \u201cIf I can further LGBTQ acceptance in society with my skills and my intelligence, why would I not do that? Especially if I can help others do the same, and then we\u2019re all leveraging off of each other\u2019s experience and expertise.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/06/us/gender-affirming-vocal-coach-cec/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/09/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_07_08_us_college-value-cost-americans-skeptical-poll", "text": "Americans are increasingly skeptical about the value and cost of college, with most saying they feel the US higher education system is headed in the \u201cwrong direction,\u201d according to a new poll. Overall, only 36% of adults say they have a \u201cgreat deal\u201d or \u201cquite a lot\u201d of confidence in higher education, according to the report released Monday by Gallup and the Lumina Foundation. That confidence level has declined steadily from 57% in 2015. Some of the same opinions have been reflected in\u00a0declining enrollment\u00a0as colleges contend with the effects of the\u00a0student debt crisis, concerns about the high cost of tuition and\u00a0political debates\u00a0over how they teach about race and other topics. The dimming view of whether college is worth the time and money cuts across all demographics \u2014 including gender, age and political affiliation. Among Republicans, the number of respondents with high confidence in higher education has dropped 36 percentage points over the last decade \u2014 far more than it dropped for Democrats or independents. \u201cIt\u2019s so expensive, and I don\u2019t think colleges are teaching people what they need to get a job,\u201d says Randy Hill, 59, a registered Republican in Connecticut and a driver for a car service. His nephew plans to do a welding apprenticeship after graduating high school. \u201cYou graduate out of college, you\u2019re up to eyeballs in debt, you can\u2019t get a job, then you can\u2019t pay it off. What\u2019s the point?\u201d The June 2024 survey\u2019s overall finding \u2014 that 36% of adults feel strong confidence in higher education \u2014 is unchanged from the year before. But what concerns researchers is shifting opinion on the bottom end, with fewer Americans saying they have \u201csome\u201d confidence and more reporting \u201cvery little\u201d and \u201cnone.\u201d This year\u2019s findings show almost as many people have little or no confidence, 32%, as those with high confidence. Experts say fewer college graduates could worsen labor shortages in fields from health care to information technology. For those who forgo college, it often means lower lifetime earnings \u2014 75% less compared with those who get bachelor\u2019s degrees, according to Georgetown University\u2019s Center on Education and the Workforce. And during an economic downturn, those without degrees are more likely to lose jobs. \u201cIt is sad to see that confidence hasn\u2019t grown at all,\u201d says Courtney Brown, vice president at Lumina, an education nonprofit focused on increasing the numbers of students who seek education beyond high school. \u201cWhat\u2019s shocking to me is that the people who have low or no confidence is actually increasing.\u201d This year\u2019s survey added new, detailed questions in an effort to understand why confidence is shrinking. Almost one-third of respondents say college is \u201ctoo expensive,\u201d while 24% feel students are not being properly educated or taught what they need to succeed. The survey did not specifically touch on the\u00a0protests this year against the war in Gaza\u00a0that divided many college campuses, but political views weighed heavily on the findings. Respondents voiced concerns about indoctrination, political bias and that colleges today are too liberal. Among the respondents who lack confidence, 41% cite political agendas as a reason. Among other findings: More than two-thirds, or 67%, of respondents say college is headed in the \u201cwrong direction,\u201d compared with just 31% who feel it\u2019s going in the right direction. Generally when people express confidence in higher education, they are thinking of four-year institutions, according to Gallup. But the survey found that more people have confidence in two-year institutions. Forty-nine percent of adults say they have \u201ca great deal\u201d or \u201cquite a lot\u201d of confidence in two-year programs, compared with 33% of Americans who feel that way about four-year colleges. California college student Kristen Freeman understands why. \u201cIt\u2019s about saving money. That\u2019s why I went to a two-year. It\u2019s more bang for your buck,\u201d says Freeman, 22, a sociology major at Diablo Valley Community College with plans to transfer to San Jose State University for the final two years of college. Freeman understands the concerns about indoctrination and whether college prepares students for life and work but also feels the only way to change structural problems is from the inside. \u201cI am learning about the world around me and developing useful skills in critical thinking,\u201d Freeman says. \u201cI think higher education can give students the spark to want to change the system.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/08/us/college-value-cost-americans-skeptical-poll/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/09/2024", "section": "us"}}

{"id": "2024_07_08_politics_dnc-delegates-biden-loyalty", "text": "Democrats urging President Joe Biden to end his campaign and allow the party to select another nominee before \u2013 or during \u2013 August\u2019s national convention are unlikely to find allies in the ranks of Chicago-bound delegates, who are increasingly closing ranks around Biden. Ten days after the president\u2019s debate debacle, following an initial surge of Democratic anxiety and calls for him to stand down, a host of party leaders and rank-and-file members selected to formally nominate Biden said they were loath to consider any other option. For many of the more than two dozen delegates interviewed by CNN over the last 48 hours, the debate remains a sore subject. Though a few sought to cast Biden\u2019s performance as an untimely aberration, most argued that, despite the angst they and so many others felt watching the president struggle, the tumult that\u2019s followed is a distraction from the party\u2019s unifying aim: To defeat former President Donald Trump in November and crush the most ambitious plans of his right-wing loyalists. Their concerns over the prospect of Biden bowing out are twofold. A host of pledged delegates warned that the process for replacing the president \u2013 should he relinquish the nomination and release his delegates \u2013 would do more damage than even the worst-case scenario with Biden atop the ticket. Most, though, refused to even consider the hypothetical \u2013 a mark of both their belief in the president and, going back months, the Biden campaign\u2019s work to screen for loyal delegates. Biden-aligned delegates also expressed, often privately, a lack of confidence in the alternatives, arguing that Biden, for all the agita following the debate, remains a better bet than any of the names whipping around the gossip circuit. To the extent they were willing to countenance a succession plan, there was overwhelming support for Vice President Kamala Harris, who \u2013 both as a logistical and political matter \u2013 would in their views likely encounter the fewest roadblocks. For the most part, though, Biden\u2019s most ardent delegates were singing from the same hymn sheet. Chris Anderson, chair of the delegate selection process in Tennessee and a local government official, argued \u2013 as Biden\u2019s campaign has done \u2013 that voters aren\u2019t as interested in the president\u2019s debate performance as the political media. \u201cThe punditry class has a job to do, and I understand that, but they seem to think the debate was a bigger deal than regular people think it was because most regular people were focused on the 90 minutes of lies spewed by Donald Trump,\u201d Anderson said. Stephen Gaskill, the former president of the Florida LGBTQ+ Democratic Caucus, told CNN he had no plans to look any further into his responsibilities as a delegate. Like so many others, he acknowledged that Biden flopped on the debate stage in Atlanta, but said he was not entertaining the idea of a candidate swap. \u201cThere is no plan B. The president is the nominee,\u201d Gaskill said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s where I and everyone that I\u2019ve been talking to stands \u2013 until and unless he says otherwise. And I don\u2019t think that\u2019s likely.\u201d Colorado state Rep. Meg Froelich said she found the post-debate narrative \u201cfrustrating\u201d given the stark differences between Biden and Trump, who was convicted of 34 felony counts earlier this year in New York and faces three other criminal indictments. \u201cThis whole idea that someone\u2019s going to ride in on a white horse and unify everyone, and we\u2019re all going to get excited \u2026 Biden is our nominee,\u201d said Froelich, who also praised Harris. \u201cI don\u2019t have a problem supporting him.\u201d In Massachusetts, Democratic strategist Joe Caiazzo \u2014 who helped organize a write-in campaign for Biden in New Hampshire because he wasn\u2019t on the primary ballot after a calendar dispute \u2014 said he was exasperated by the relentless focus on Biden\u2019s missteps. \u201cThe debate performance obviously could have been better, significantly better,\u201d Caiazzo said. \u201cAnd I think that it was clear that the narrative coming out of the debate would be more about Joe Biden\u2019s performance than what Donald Trump actually said.\u201d He also questioned the motives of some of the voices calling for Biden to quit. \u201cThere are people in the party who are looking for a reason to sideline Biden from the beginning,\u201d Caiazzo said, \u201cwhich was clear through my work on the write-in effort.\u201d Delegates willing to go public with their calls for Biden to drop out have typically been less closely tied to the campaign and Democratic Party infrastructure. Rishi Kumar, a Biden delegate from California and former Saratoga City councilmember, said he began researching Democratic National Committee rules for replacing a candidate a year ago. \u201cThe process is probably as clear as mud right now,\u201d Kumar said. \u201cThe DNC committee will have to come up with a plan, whether Biden drops out before or at the convention or even after.\u201d The debate was an \u201ceye opener,\u201d he said, and Biden\u2019s interview with ABC News broadcast on Friday didn\u2019t help. Kumar, who ran for retiring Democratic Rep. Anna Eshoo\u2019s Silicon Valley House seat but did not advance out of the primary, said he was worried down-ballot Democrats would be political \u201croadkill\u201d if Biden didn\u2019t exit the race. \u201cWith so many vulnerable Democrats who are running in the House and Senate, those seats might be up for grabs if Biden becomes the roadblock,\u201d said Kumar, who told CNN that he would back California Gov. Gavin Newsom for the presidential nomination if the opportunity arose. Biden and his campaign began a blitz of personal outreach after the initial shock of the debate subsided, trying to lock down support with party leaders \u2013 including governors and members of Congress \u2013 whose decisions could pave the way for others to register their concerns. They have also hammered a public message that a faceless blob of Democratic \u201celites\u201d is trying to step over the will of primary voters. \u201cI\u2019m getting so frustrated by the elites,\u201d a combative Biden said during a call-in to MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe\u201d on Monday. \u201cThey know so much more. But if any of these guys don\u2019t think I should run \u2013 run against me. Good. Announce \u2014 announce for president. Challenge me at the convention.\u201d So far, six Democratic House members have publicly asked Biden to stand down. A handful  \u2013 most in senior positions \u2013 said the same during a weekend call with the party\u2019s House leadership, according to sources briefed on the discussion. That number could grow on Tuesday, when House lawmakers hold their first caucus meeting with Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries since the debate. Though one member told CNN the dam could break soon after that gathering, most Democratic elected officials, activists and delegates have, so far, been careful not to be seen speaking out of school. There is also a concerted \u2013 if decentralized \u2013 push to downplay anxiety over Biden as typical liberal \u201cbedwetting,\u201d as the campaign itself described it in a fundraising email after the debate. Organizers on the ground chafed at that language, which the campaign has mostly backed off from, and pointed to it as evidence that Biden and his top aides are disconnected from the situation on the ground. \u201cI think (the calls for Biden to quit) are a function of people who understand the stakes, as Joe Biden himself put it, which is that democracy is on the line and we can\u2019t go upward to go into this fight with one or two hands tied behind our back, which is what we\u2019ll have to do if Joe Biden\u2019s the nominee,\u201d said one Democratic strategist who works closely with a network of grassroots groups around the country. Kevin Tolbert, a first-time delegate and district chair for the Michigan Democratic Party, described the debate as road bump in Biden\u2019s path to reelection \u2013 an opinion he\u2019s shared with doubters. \u201cThe message I\u2019ve been saying to people is this is not the time for us to be caught into our feelings. This is not about who we love or an emotional response,\u201d Tolbert said. \u201cThis is the time for us to be very cerebral and very intelligent and make sure we educate people over what\u2019s occurring.\u201d Alan Geraci, a California-based delegate for Biden who is still supportive of him, said the president\u2019s debate performance was \u201cabysmal\u201d and he shouldn\u2019t have taken the stage that night if he was sick or exhausted, as the White House has suggested he was. In the aftermath of that performance, Geraci said he was \u201cdisappointed\u201d the Biden campaign wasn\u2019t more aggressive with his public appearances. \u201cThey had that next-day North Carolina campaign event that went well, but then it kind of languished for a week,\u201d said Geraci, who is also running for the San Marcos City Council. \u201cI thought that was a huge mistake, that Biden needed to be out there and convincing people that he\u2019s ready for the task, and that the debate indeed was a one-off.\u201d Like many delegates, Geraci has been following the president\u2019s public appearances in the days after the debate. Biden\u2019s interview with ABC was \u201cbetter than the debate,\u201d he said, but not a home run. Geraci was more pleased with positive responses Biden received after a Sunday appearance at a Black church in Philadelphia. \u201cI felt very confident that that\u2019s what he needs to do every single day,\u201d he said. Geraci also pointed to the 1944 election, when ailing Democratic President Franklin Delano Roosevelt campaigned aggressively to overcome public questions about his health, as further evidence that \u201cthe most effective defense is a good, strong offense.\u201d Roosevelt died five months after the election, which he won in a landslide. Former Ohio state Sen. Nina Turner, a DNC member and close ally of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders during his presidential runs, dismissed any suggestion that delegates were poised \u2013 or inclined \u2013 to launch a \u201crogue takeover.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s not going to happen. The only way the convention is truly going be open is if Biden says, \u2018I\u2019m not gonna run and I release my delegates,\u2019\u201d Turner said. \u201cUnless something spectacularly more daunting than what we saw on that debate stage happens, it\u2019s totally in his hands.\u201d Michigan Rep. Haley Stevens, a vocal Biden backer in a House Democratic conference that has shown signs of fracturing, said she had not heard much about the potential for an open convention from her constituents. If a fellow delegate asked for her take, Stevens said, she would point to the scoreboard. \u201cIf I was talking to a delegate in Michigan\u2019s 11th District, in the heart of Oakland County, I would say that 87% of our district voted for Joe Biden, like overwhelmingly,\u201d she told CNN. But Stevens also warned Democrats \u2013 in and outside of Washington \u2013 to choose their words carefully, with a thought for the party\u2019s ability to come together in the fall, as the discourse around Biden heats up. \u201cThis is kind of like disagreeing with your spouse or a family member,\u201d Stevens said. \u201cYou really gotta watch what you say in these moments.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/08/politics/dnc-delegates-biden-loyalty/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/09/2024", "section": "us"}}

Presidential race President Joe Biden remains adamant about staying in the 2024 race despite swelling calls within his party to step down after last month\u2019s dismal debate performance. Several House Democratic ranking members told House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries on Sunday that Biden needs to step down from the race, according to sources familiar with the conversation. Biden held a pair of campaign events in the swing state of Pennsylvania over the weekend to reassure skeptical voters about the viability of his reelection bid, telling reporters \u201cI\u2019m up for the job.\u201d Meanwhile, former President Trump is gearing up to announce his running mate before kicking off a Republican convention in Milwaukee next week where he will officially become the party\u2019s presidential nominee for the third time in eight years. 2. Hurricane Beryl Beryl made landfall near Matagorda, Texas, today as a Category 1 hurricane. It is the first storm in the Atlantic hurricane season to make landfall in the US. After causing chaos in the Caribbean and Mexico\u2019s Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula last week and killing at least nine people, Beryl weakened to a tropical storm but strengthened to become a hurricane overnight. It will continue to bring life-threatening storm surge and flooding to Texas this week, meteorologists say. Power outages are also rapidly climbing across the state as Beryl moves inland with gusty winds downing parts of the electric grid. Experts say this hurricane season will be far from normal, as fossil fuel pollution contributes to warmer water and rapidly intensifying storms. 3. France election Cheers rang out on the streets of Paris on Sunday after a left-wing alliance won the most seats in the French parliament, thwarting Marine Le Pen\u2019s far-right party. The stunning result from the second-round vote means France will avoid a far-right government but will plunged into political limbo, with no party reaching an absolute majority.\u00a0The left-wing New Popular Front won 182 seats, while President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s centrist Ensemble alliance won 163 seats. The far-right National Rally and its allies slumped to third place due to tactical voting, winning 143 seats. Prime Minister Gabriel Attal, Macron\u2019s protege, tendered his resignation today \u2014 but Macron refused to accept. The president asked him to stay on for now \u201cto ensure the stability of the country.\u201d 4. Covid-19 Second gentleman Doug Emhoff tested positive for Covid-19 on Saturday after experiencing mild symptoms, according to a Sunday statement from his office. Vice President Kamala Harris has tested negative for the virus and remains asymptomatic, the statement said. The couple were at an event with President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden on Thursday for an Independence Day celebration. CNN has reached out to the White House to ask whether the president is being tested. The positive case in Biden\u2019s inner circle comes as a summer wave of Covid-19 has already arrived in the US, the CDC says, with infections probably growing in at least 38 states. 5. Boeing plea deal Boeing has agreed to plead guilty to one charge of conspiracy to defraud the US and potentially pay up to $487 million in fines for repeated safety failures. The plea deal provides a path for Boeing to avoid trial, the Justice Department said in a court filing Sunday. But that fine is a fraction of the $24.8 billion that families of crash victims wanted the aircraft maker to pay. The guilty plea is a severe blow to the reputation of Boeing, a company once known for the quality and safety of its commercial jets. Beyond the two fatal crashes of the 737 Max jets, the company has faced a series of questions about the safety and quality of its planes. HAPPENING LATER India\u2019s Modi heads to MoscowIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi will visit Moscow today for wide-ranging talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin. It is Modi\u2019s first visit to Russia since the country invaded Ukraine and is widely seen as a dent in efforts by Western leaders to isolate Putin.

{"id": "2024_07_08_business_smartmatic-reid-hoffman-fox-news", "text": "LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman is providing significant financial firepower to Smartmatic as the voting technology company fights Fox News and Newsmax over the right-wing networks\u2019 repeated airing of 2020 election lies. Hoffman, a billionaire venture capitalist and prominent Democratic donor, framed his multimillion-dollar investment in Smartmatic as a way to strengthen the company\u2019s global operations as it pursues the costly defamation lawsuits. \u201cSmartmatic built a global business by using technology to better engage citizens, regardless of party or ideology, by making voting simple and trustworthy,\u201d Hoffman said in a statement. \u201cAfter Donald Trump lost in 2020, however, Smartmatic became a target of the defamatory campaign to overturn his defeat.\u201d Hoffman, who said he has known Smartmatic CEO Antonio Mugica for years, said he is \u201cthrilled\u201d to support Smartmatic and help Mugica recover \u201cwhat he is owed.\u201d Terms of the investment, first\u00a0reported\u00a0by The Washington Post, were not disclosed. A\u00a0person with knowledge of the matter wouldn\u2019t say exactly how much money Hoffman poured into Smartmatic but told CNN the eight-figure investment surpassed $10 million. \u201cThis isn\u2019t litigation financing,\u201d the person said, adding that Hoffman \u201cthinks the company is massively undervalued\u201d and will make money off his investment if Smartmatic does well in the future. Furthermore, while Hoffman\u2019s investment is significant, he \u201cdoesn\u2019t have the power\u201d to order Smartmatic\u2019s lawyers to settle the lawsuits, the person added. \u201cFox\u2019s strategy was to spend us into the ground,\u201d the person said. \u201cThis is the response.\u201d The investment comes as\u00a0Hoffman steps up his criticism\u00a0of Trump. The\u00a0LinkedIn co-founder told CNN\u00a0earlier this month that business leaders are scared to speak out against Trump for fear that the presumptive Republican nominee will retaliate. Hoffman argued that President Joe Biden is the more \u201cpro-business\u201d candidate because he respects the rule of law and Trump does not. Mugica, the Smartmatic CEO, welcomed the support from Hoffman. \u201cThe lies told by Fox News and Newsmax have not only defamed and damaged our business, they have also directly attacked the integrity of the nonpartisan civic work we have supported over more than two decades,\u201d Mugica said in a statement. Smartmatic is seeking billions of dollars in damages from Fox News, Newsmax and other right-wing figures that falsely accused the company of rigging the 2020 election. On social media and in TV interviews, top Donald Trump allies repeatedly claimed, with no proof, that Smartmatic software fraudulently flipped millions of votes from Trump to Biden. The voting technology company\u2019s defamation lawsuit\u00a0against Fox News\u00a0is still in the fact-finding \u201cdiscovery\u201d phase and isn\u2019t expected to go to trial until 2025. Earlier this year, the New York judge overseeing the case\u00a0allowed\u00a0Smartmatic to broaden its lawsuit to include Fox Corporation, the parent company of the cable news juggernaut. The Smartmatic-Newsmax lawsuit is\u00a0slated for trial in September\u00a0in Delaware Superior Court, unless there is a last-minute settlement. And the small pro-Trump propaganda network\u00a0One America News recently\u00a0settled a\u00a0lawsuit brought by Smartmatic\u00a0over similar allegations. All of these media outlets and Trump allies deny wrongdoing. A spokesperson for Fox News Media claimed Smartmatic is trying to \u201cto chill First Amendment freedoms\u201d with its lawsuit, \u201cso their alliance with a high profile Democratic donor and longtime supporter of President Biden to fund their lawsuit is entirely predictable.\u201d \u201cWe remain ready to defend this case surrounding extremely newsworthy events when it goes to trial next year,\u201d the spokesperson added. In response to Hoffman\u2019s investment, a Newsmax lawyer told CNN that the company \u201creported fairly on both sides of the 2020 election.\u201d The lawyer also noted that Smartmatic executives were recently\u00a0implicated by the Justice Department\u00a0in a bribery scheme involving a top Philippines election official. Smartmatic denies the allegations. Smartmatic is also suing Trump 2020 campaign lawyer Sidney Powell and MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell \u2013 two of the most egregious peddlers of election disinformation. A representative for Powell did not immediately respond to requests for comment. \u201cIt seems that Mr. Hoffman is trying to take a page out of the Fox settlement, and copying Staple Street\u2019s investment in Dominion, to get a quick return,\u201d Lindell attorney Christopher Kachouroff said, referring to the private equity firm that owns a majority stake in Dominion and benefitted from its $787 million settlement with Fox News.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/08/business/smartmatic-reid-hoffman-fox-news/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/09/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "us_national-education-association-antisemistism", "text": "Several items being proposed at an upcoming education convention in Philadelphia\u00a0are raising concerns among a pro-Israel advocacy group about potential antisemitism and anti-Israel bias. Delegates of the\u00a0National Education Association (NEA), the largest teachers\u2019 union in the United States,\u00a0will meet at\u00a0the Pennsylvania Convention Center in Philadelphia\u00a0for their annual representative assembly from Wednesday to Sunday. Two rallies were held Wednesday outside the convention hall, one by the Educators for Palestine group \u2013 which is made up of NEA members - and a counter rally by StandWithUs, a nonprofit pro-Israel advocacy organization. StandWithUs has characterized several proposed agenda items being discussed as antisemitic. Although\u00a0the proposed agenda items\u00a0are typically confidential before being voted on at the representative assembly, Educators for Palestine have outlined several in their call to vote yes. CNN has not seen the proposed agenda items. The NEA did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for information on the\u00a0agenda items in question. Both groups aim to raise awareness among NEA delegates about several\u00a0agenda items that\u00a0reportedly\u00a0call for the NEA to\u00a0align itself with the \u201cBoycott, Divestment, and Sanctions\u201d movement against Israel, distinguish between antisemitism and anti-Zionism, and educate members about the Nakba, a term referring to the mass displacement of Palestinians during the 1948 Arab-Israeli war, according to information from both Educators for Palestine and StandWithUs. The past year has seen heightened tension in classrooms across the country, including incidents of antisemitism and anti-Palestinian hate, especially following an attack by Hamas on Israel in October. \u201cAs the largest teachers union in the United States, the NEA has a significant influence on educational policies and practices. Before and especially after the atrocities of October 7th, a number of local and state NEA union affiliates have been embroiled in major controversies regarding antisemitism and anti-Israel bias. In some cases, this has resulted in Jewish families moving their children to different school districts with a less hostile learning environment,\u201d a\u00a0release\u00a0from StandWithUs said. \u201cThe NEA must ensure a safe and inclusive environment for all educators and students, and maintain public trust in what is being taught in our classrooms. Passing antisemitic and anti-Israel resolutions would not only harm Jewish members, but also undermine the integrity of public education,\u201d David Smokler, director of K-12 educator outreach at StandWithUs, added. On the other hand, Educators for Palestine urge NEA delegates to vote yes on the agenda items, stating, \u201cAs educators, we must be open to educating each other, and learning from one another. We stand in solidarity with working class people around the world. Help us fight for a liberated Palestine, and a liberated people!\u201d A NEA spokesperson told CNN regarding the rallies, \u201cThe members of the\u00a0National Education Association\u00a0and delegates to its annual Representative Assembly are committed to educating and nurturing understanding in their students of every race, faith, and background.\u201d \u201cNEA has a deep history that is steeped in civil rights and advocating for racial and social justice. Over many decades, the delegates of the\u00a0NEA Representative Assembly\u00a0have adopted resolutions expressing our union\u2019s condemnation of war, terrorism, hate, and violence. The vast majority of NEA delegates, members, and our society want to see a peaceful and lasting solution to this conflict,\u201d their statement added. About 50-100 people came to each rally. Many carried signs and some waved flags. A group of police officers with bicycles separated the groups. Samy El-Baroudi, a business teacher from Des Moines, Iowa, who told CNN he was an organizer of the Educators for Palestine rally, said the NEA has taken stands before as it did against apartheid and should for the Palestinian people. \u201cWe stood up against so many injustices across the world, why is this one different?\u201d he asked. El-Baroudi said he has proposed a new business item asking for the NEA to determine a concrete definition of \u201cgenocide,\u201d a word he said is probably one of the most misunderstood words in the English language. \u201cWe want to have an honest, fair conversation,\u201d he said. At the other rally, Smokler said some teachers are bringing biased and inappropriate materials into classrooms and telling children what to think and not how to think. A small group of radical extremists are trying to get their propaganda into new business items, he told CNN as he stood near a protester who held a sign that read, \u201cCritical thinking, Not indoctrination.\u201d He said the NEA should be focused on improving conditions for teachers and students, not geopolitics. The rallies remained peaceful and there appeared to be no arrests.

{"id": "2024_07_08_us_us-heat-wave-shatters-records-causes-deaths", "text": "Los Angeles (AP) \u2014 More than 50 million people across the US are under heat alerts amid a brutal heat wave that has shattered records and caused multiple deaths across the West. As of Monday, much of the West and South are experiencing moderate to major heat risk, the National Weather Service said. California and Nevada are expected to see more daily record high temperatures in the week ahead. By Thursday, the heat in the Pacific Northwest will shift to the Intermountain West and northern High Plains, the National Weather Service\u2019s Weather Prediction Center cautions. In Oregon, four people died of suspected heat-related illnesses over the weekend, according to a Monday news release from Multnomah County. Three of the four were residents of Multnomah County, while the other individual was transported from outside the county and later died at a Portland hospital. These deaths happened after the county declared a state of emergency Friday due to \u201cdangerously hot temperatures,\u201d but the news release noted \u201cfurther tests and investigation will determine whether the deaths are officially hot-weather-related. In some cases, the deaths may be found to have had other causes.\u201d Dozens of locations in the West and Pacific Northwest tied or broke previous heat records in the last few days, and more than 165 daily high temperature records could be tied or broken this week. In eastern California\u2019s Death Valley National Park, where a high temperature of 129 degrees was recorded Saturday and Sunday, a visitor died Saturday from heat exposure and another person was hospitalized, officials said. The two visitors were part of a group of six motorcyclists riding through the Badwater Basin area amid scorching weather, the park said in a statement. The person who died was not identified. The other motorcyclist was transported to a Las Vegas hospital for \u201csevere heat illness,\u201d the statement said. Due to the high temperatures, emergency medical helicopters were unable to respond, as the aircraft cannot generally fly safely over 120 degrees, officials said. The other four members of the party were treated at the scene. \u201cWhile this is a very exciting time to experience potential world record setting temperatures in Death Valley, we encourage visitors to choose their activities carefully, avoiding prolonged periods of time outside of an air-conditioned vehicle or building when temperatures are this high,\u201d said park Superintendent Mike Reynolds. Officials warned that heat illness and injury are cumulative and can build over the course of a day or days. \u201cBesides not being able to cool down while riding due to high ambient air temperatures, experiencing Death Valley by motorcycle when it is this hot is further challenged by the necessary heavy safety gear worn to reduce injuries during an accident,\u201d the park statement said. Death Valley has reached or exceeded 125 degrees every day since July 4. The streak is expected to continue through Saturday. Many areas in Northern California surpassed 110 degrees Sunday, while Las Vegas reached a record high of 120 degrees and Phoenix, Arizona, set a new daily record for the warmest low temperature: it never got below 92 degrees. Across the desert in Nevada, Natasha Ivory took four of her eight children to a water park in Mount Charleston, outside Las Vegas, which on Sunday set a record high of 120 degrees. \u201cThey\u2019re having a ball,\u201d Ivory told CNN affiliate KVVU. \u201cI\u2019m going to get wet too. It\u2019s too hot not to.\u201d Indiana resident Mark Kavacinski told KVVU his family almost canceled their vacation to Las Vegas because of the intense heat. \u201cWe knew it was going to be hot. It\u2019s July, right? Did we know it was going to be this hot? No,\u201d Kavacinski said. \u201cBut we decided that heat\u2019s heat. We can handle it.\u201d Jill Workman Anderson also was at Mount Charleston, taking her dog for a short hike and enjoying the view. \u201cWe can look out and see the desert,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was also 30 degrees cooler than northwest Las Vegas, where we live.\u201d The city has recorded temperatures over 110 degrees since Wednesday and the streak is expected to continue until at least Sunday \u2013 which would be the longest stretch of days over 110 degrees on record for Las Vegas. Triple-digit temperatures were common across Oregon, where several records were toppled \u2014 including in Salem, where on Sunday it hit 103 degrees, topping the 100-degree mark set in 1945, according to the National Weather Service office in Portland. The city of Eugene also beat a record from that same year, reaching 103 degrees on Sunday \u2013 five degrees hotter than the previous record of 98 degrees in 1945. But some Oregonians told CNN affiliate KATU Sunday they would not miss the Portland Timbers soccer game, regardless of the heat. \u201cYeah, I know it\u2019s hot! It\u2019s 100, it\u2019s crazy. but the game here is greater,\u201d Tim Hueng of Tigard, Oregon told KATU as he waited in line to enter Providence Park. On the more-humid East Coast, temperatures above 100 degrees were widespread, though no excessive heat advisories were in effect for Sunday. \u201cDrink plenty of fluids, stay in an air-conditioned room, stay out of the sun, and check up on relatives and neighbors,\u201d read a weather service advisory for the Baltimore area. \u201cYoung children and pets should never be left unattended in vehicles under any circumstances.\u201d Heat records shattered across the Southwest Rare heat advisories were extended even into higher elevations including around Lake Tahoe, on the border of California and Nevada, with the weather service in Reno, Nevada, warning of \u201cmajor heat risk impacts, even in the mountains.\u201d The temperatures in western Nevada and northeastern California will not drop below 100 degrees until next weekend, the service said. More extreme highs are in the near forecast, including possibly 130 degrees around midweek at Furnace Creek, California, in Death Valley. The hottest temperature ever officially recorded on Earth was 134 degrees Fahrenheit in July 1913 in Death Valley, though some experts dispute that measurement and say the real record was 130, recorded there in July 2021. Tracy Housley, a native of Manchester, England, said she decided to drive from her hotel in Las Vegas to Death Valley after hearing on the radio that temperatures could approach record levels. \u201cWe just thought, let\u2019s be there for that,\u201d Housley said Sunday. \u201cLet\u2019s go for the experience.\u201d In Arizona\u2019s Maricopa County, which encompasses Phoenix, there have been at least 13 confirmed heat-related deaths this year, along with more than 160 other deaths suspected of being related to heat that are still under investigation, according to a recent report. That does not include the death of a 10-year-old boy last week in Phoenix who suffered a \u201cheat-related medical event\u201d while hiking with family at South Mountain Park and Preserve, according to police. Climate crisis fuels our warming world June marked the twelfth\u00a0month in a row in which the global average temperature was at least 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than in pre-industrial times,\u00a0according to new data from Copernicus, the European Union\u2019s climate monitoring service. June this year was 1.5 degrees Celsius hotter than the average June\u00a0before industrialization, when humans started burning large amounts of planet-heating\u00a0fossil fuels.\u00a0Over the last 12 months, the world has been, on average,\u00a01.64 degrees Celsius hotter than in pre-industrial times. The world also marked the thirteenth\u00a0straight month of record-breaking heat, meaning that last month was the hottest June on record, and each month before that for a year was the hottest such month on record as well. The natural El Ni\u00f1o phenomenon contributed to the record heat, but long-term climate change has been the main driver of the temperature rise over the past year, previous Copernicus analysis has shown. Under the Paris Agreement in 2015, countries agreed to\u00a0limit global\u00a0warming\u00a0to\u00a02 degrees Celsius, but preferably\u00a01.5 degrees.\u00a0\u00a0Although the Paris target refers\u00a0to warming over\u00a0a\u00a0decadeslong period,\u00a0rather than\u00a0a single month or year, scientists\u00a0say successive months breaching 1.5 degrees of warming signal the world is careening toward breaching the longer-term threshold.

Because he did seem a little off.\u201d Her husband, fellow Biden voter Troy Reissmann, hung in to the debate\u2019s end, reaching for the phone during former President Donald Trump\u2019s\u00a0closing statement. \u201cYeah, it was definitely scary,\u201d Troy Reissmann said of Biden\u2019s performance. \u201cThe first people that I\u00a0called were my parents, who are really old. And I said, \u2018What did you guys think about that?\u2019 Because I still know where I\u2019m going to vote, where my vote is going to lie. But\u00a0they don\u2019t. And they were equally as scared.\u201d The Reissmanns own the Shinery, a moonshine bar in\u00a0Cedarburg, a small, picturesque\u00a0city about 30 minutes north of Milwaukee. What were once textile mills are now bars, restaurants, inns and art galleries.\u00a0Local after local talks about living in a real-life Hallmark movie or a Norman Rockwell painting. The Reissmanns \u2014 civil, affable and politically minded \u2014 have a message for the candidate they both supported in 2020. \u201cThink of the future. Think of our kids and grandkids,\u201d Troy Reissmann said. \u201cMaybe you should step aside only because there\u2019s \u2014 the future doesn\u2019t look too bright with the other side taking\u00a0over. And maybe I\u2019m wrong, and I hope I would be, but you know, it\u2019s scary.\u201d Lisa Reissmann agreed. \u201cI think it is time. We just need fresh leadership, new leadership. \u2026 I like Joe Biden as a person, you know. I think he stands for good things. But I am just not sure he\u2019s there anymore to lead the\u00a0country.\u201d The Reissmanns \u2014 and\u00a0Cedarburg \u2014 are now part of a\u00a0CNN project designed to track the 2024\u00a0campaign through the eyes and experiences of voters who live in key battlegrounds and are part of\u00a0critical voting blocs. Cedarburg, population 12,000, would not have made such a list until recently. It was once reliably Republican. Mitt Romney won 63% of the vote here just a dozen years ago, in 2012. Trump won in 2016, but his share of the vote dropped to 55%. Then Biden eked out a 19-vote win in\u00a0Cedarburg in 2020 \u2014 a\u00a0combination, locals say, of population shifts and Trump\u2019s suburban struggles with moderate Republicans and GOP-leaning independents. Gina\u00a0Cilento fits, though perhaps not perfectly, in the latter group. \u201cI\u00a0can\u2019t say right now,\u201d\u00a0Cilento said when asked her 2024 presidential preference. \u201cI\u2019m undecided.\u201d Biden\u2019s debate debacle hasn\u2019t automatically translated into more support for Trump, at least in Cedarburg. Cilento tends to vote Republican and has never voted for a Democrat for president. But she is disgusted with today\u2019s politics and\u00a0calls herself \u201cleaning more independent or straight up libertarianism.\u201d \u201cMy politics are\u00a0currently very \u2014 a place of being kind of over it,\u201d\u00a0Cilento said in an interview at her growing\u00a0Cedarburg pickleball studio. \u201cEvery time you go to the polls \u2014 this is the best our\u00a0country\u00a0can do? \u2026 We are one of the greatest\u00a0countries in the whole entire world and this is what we\u2019re \u2014 these are our deliverables? It\u2019s very frustrating. \u2026 I just feel overall sadness, and to me the biggest issue is that a house divided\u00a0cannot stand. And there\u2019s truth to that and I\u2019m seeing our\u00a0country erode instead of thrive.\u201d We find dismay and disgust at the presidential\u00a0choices everywhere we travel. Worries about political polarization \u2014 \u201ca house divided\u201d as\u00a0Cilento put it \u2014 were common among Americans who have a history of voting Republican but a hard time voting for Trump because of a tone they find abrasive and antagonistic. To that end,\u00a0Cilento said she \u201cwould entertain\u201d voting third-party. She\u00a0cannot imagine voting for Biden and said she was saddened by his debate performance.\u00a0She said she would at least take a look at a new Democrat if Biden stepped aside. \u201cI\u2019m in a place where I\u2019m wanting to feel\u00a0connected,\u201d she said. Cilento \u2014 a former tennis pro turned\u00a0competitive, touring pickleball player \u2014 sees voters of all stripes at her facility. But political\u00a0conversations there tend to be brief and polite. \u201cIt is really just a place for people to forget what is going on in the real world, and they\u00a0can focus on just having fun and getting along,\u201d\u00a0she said. Cilento was the grand marshal of this year\u2019s Fourth of July parade in\u00a0Cedarburg, an event \u2014 once featured in a Toby Keith music video \u2014 that is a source of enormous local pride. During the parade, which runs for about two hours, the sidewalks are packed with families as marching bands, antique tractors, and floats sponsored by local businesses wind past stone and shingled buildings with rich histories. \u201cThe\u00a0city itself was really powered by textile mills,\u201d said Melissa Wraalstad, who runs the Wisconsin Museum of Quilts and Fiber Arts, which is located on a\u00a0Cedarburg farmstead once owned by German immigrants. \u201cMid-20th century into the 1970s, the mills\u00a0closed. So\u00a0Cedarburg had to reinvent itself and\u00a0come up with another idea,\u201d Wraalstad said in an interview. \u201cA lot of other towns faltered (but)\u00a0Cedarburg was able to reinvent itself as an arts destination and a tourist town.\u201d Wraalstad noticed another\u00a0change to Cedarburg in 2020, when, for the first time, the lawn signs were roughly evenly split between the Democratic\u00a0and Republican\u00a0candidates.\u00a0Her favorite? A neighboring house where the husband and wife split the lawn \u2014 half Trump; half Biden. Everyone says there are fewer signs this year. Maybe it is just early. Or maybe it\u2019s a reflection of what Wraalstad heard a lot from museum visitors and friends after the debate. \u201cPeople weren\u2019t thrilled with either of them, for the most part,\u201d she said. And the review of Biden\u2019s debate? \u201cThe same\u00a0concerns people all over the\u00a0country have about age,\u201d said Wraalstad, who said she was an independent\u00a0who\u00a0could not discuss her personal opinions because of her museum role. The lack of enthusiasm for both major-party\u00a0candidates was also evident at a giant post-parade picnic\u00a0at a local park. There were a modest number of Trump hats and shirts; some, but fewer, signs of Biden branding.\u00a0Conversations with a half-dozen Democrats were dominated by their worries about Biden\u2019s debate performance and their view it had damaged his\u00a0chances of winning Wisconsin again. (The president narrowly carried the state in 2020 after Trump won it four years earlier.) Allen Naparalla tracks the political\u00a0change here by the dwindling number of eye rolls and\u00a0complaints about the slogan of his\u00a0Chiselled Grape Winery right along\u00a0Cedarburg\u2019s main drag: \u201cSexy Wines \u2013 Taste the Juice.\u201d Five years ago, he said, when he opened the shop, he had \u201csome issues with people.\u201dPeople said things like \u201c\u2018what is that?\u2019\u201d and \u201c\u2018that\u2019s disgusting,\u2019\u201d Naparalla said. \u201cNow you are kind of getting on an even keel between\u00a0conservative and liberal.\u201d Naparalla moved here to\u00a0care for his aging mother. His wines are made and bottled in\u00a0California and sold in a welcoming\u00a0caf\u00e9 where locals mingle with tourists. In a\u00a0campaign year like this, politics are a frequent topic\u00a0of\u00a0conversation. \u201cI make it a safe environment,\u201d Naparalla said. \u201cEveryone has a right to speak. Everyone has a right to say what they feel.\u201d He\u00a0calls himself a fiscal\u00a0conservative and social liberal, someone who thinks Washington should spend less money but ban assault-style rifles. \u201cI\u2019m having a horrible, difficult time,\u201d Naparalla said. \u201cIt\u2019s just\u00a0constant fighting and bickering. \u2026 It\u2019s the middle\u00a0class that is not being represented anymore. The actual worker. The small businessman.\u201d In one breath, he says he is undecided when it\u00a0comes to the 2024 presidential election. In the next, he says he\u00a0can\u2019t vote for Trump and doesn\u2019t see a viable third-party option. Naparalla, too, watched the debate. \u201cHorrible. I mean it was awful,\u201d Naparalla said. \u201cWatching Biden try to get through his words was just bad. Just bad. Now everyone has a bad day. I get it. But the thing is, this was a time \u2014 this was your time to shine, you know?\u201d Did Biden look\u00a0capable of serving four and a half more years? \u201cI don\u2019t, I think that what\u2019s \u2026\u201d said Naparalla \u2014 not often at a loss for words \u2014 as he stumbled a bit trying to settle on his answer. \u201cLet me put it this way: I\u2019m voting for the party right now.\u201d This sentiment from Naparalla\u00a0came up a lot in our\u00a0Cedarburg\u00a0conversations: \u201cBefore the debate, I thought Biden\u00a0could still pull it out.\u201d Now, Naparalla and many\u00a0certain or likely Biden voters here voice doubts that the president\u00a0can\u00a0carry Wisconsin and win reelection. And they fear a Trump return to the White House. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be probably a hairy time for a while,\u201d Naparalla said. Yet he is not\u00a0convinced switching\u00a0candidates is the answer. \u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d he said when asked whether he believed Vice President Kamala Harris is qualified to be president. He spends a lot of time in\u00a0California and said he does not think Gov. Gavin Newsom should be the nominee, either. Naparalla understands why some people are\u00a0calling for Biden to step aside. But he is skeptical. \u201cWho\u2019s going to do it?\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s so late in the election process that, you know, Trump will be a shoo-in anyway. \u2026 I just think it is too late.\u201d Naparalla was not the only voter we spoke to in\u00a0Cedarburg to pose this challenge to Biden\u2019s team and top Democrats: \u201cIf you\u2019re really\u00a0concerned about your party, then do something before this.

{"id": "2024_07_08_business_boeing-doj-criminal-charges", "text": "Boeing has agreed to plead guilty to one charge of conspiracy to defraud the United States\u00a0for its role in two fatal 737 Max crashes,\u00a0the Justice Department said in a court filing Sunday evening. It represents yet another black eye for the company after a series of embarrassing safety blunders, but the agreement avoids what could have been more serious consequences. \ufeffIt will pay up to $487 million in fines \u2014 a fraction of the $24.8 billion that families of crash victims wanted the aircraft maker to pay. The families of victims of two fatal crashes of the 737 Max oppose the deal, the department said. The guilty plea is a severe blow to the reputation of Boeing, a company once known for the quality and safety of its commercial planes. Beyond the fatal crashes of the 737 Max jets, the company has faced a series of questions about the safety and quality of its planes.\u00a0In January, a door plug on a 737 Max flown by Alaska Airlines blew out early in a flight, leaving a gaping hole in the side of the jet and further damaging Boeing\u2019s reputation. The agreement stipulates that Boeing will have to operate under the oversight of an independent monitor \u2013 a person to be chosen by the government \u2013 for a period of three years. But that oversight and the fine did not satisfy the families of victims, according to one of their attorneys. \u201cThis sweetheart deal fails to recognize that because of Boeing\u2019s conspiracy, 346 people died,\u201d said a statement from Paul Cassell, a law professor at the University of Utah who represents many family members of the\u00a02018 Lion Air crash\u00a0and\u00a02019 Ethiopian Air crash\u00a0victims. \u201cThis deceptive and generous deal is clearly not in the public interest,\u201d he added. The families are seeking a public trial on the charges.  Justice Department defends deal The Justice Department argues that the penalties Boeing agreed to were the most serious available. It argued it won other improvements as well, including the oversight of a monitor and the demand that Boeing spend more on safety and compliance of rules when building aircraft. \u201cThis resolution protects the American public,\u201d said the DOJ\u2019s statement. \u201cBoeing will be required to make\u00a0historic investments to strengthen and integrate its compliance and safety programs. This criminal conviction demonstrates the department\u2019s commitment to holding Boeing accountable for its misconduct.\u201d The statement also raised the possibility of more legal problems ahead for Boeing and its executives. It said that while no individuals face criminal charges as a result of this agreement, \u201cDOJ is resolving only with the company \u2014 and providing\u00a0no immunity to any individual employees, including corporate executives, for any conduct.\u201d \u201cDOJ is resolving with Boeing only for misconduct that predated the 737 Max crashes \u2014 and\u00a0not providing immunity for any other corporate conduct, including the Alaska Airlines 1282 incident,\u201d it added. While no one was severely injured in that flight, CNN has confirmed that passengers and crew on that flight have received notice that they might be considered victims of a crime. But family members of victims from the two fatal plane crashes blasted the plea agreement early Monday. \u201cMiscarriage of justice is a gross understatement in describing this,\u201d said a statement from Zipporah Kuria of England who lost her father, Joseph, in the Ethiopian Airlines crash. \u201cIt is an atrocious abomination. I hope that, God forbid, if this happens again the DOJ is reminded that it had the opportunity to do something meaningful and instead chose not to.\u201d \u201cWithout full transparency and accountability nothing will change,\u201d said a statement from California resident Ike Riffel, who lost his two sons, Melvin and Bennett, in the crash. \u201cWith this deal, there will be no investigation, there will be no expert witness testimony, there will be no perpetrators of these crimes to answer the charges in court.\u201d \u201cThe penalties and conditions imposed on Boeing as a result of this plea deal are not substantively different than those that failed to change Boeing\u2019s safety culture and that resulted in the Alaska Air door blowout,\u201d said aerospace engineer Javier de Luis, who lost his sister Graziella in the second crash. \u201cWhen the next crash happens, every DOJ official that signed off on this deal will be as responsible as the Boeing executives that refuse to put safety ahead of profits.\u201d Boeing issued a brief statement saying only that it can \u201cconfirm that we have reached an agreement in principle on terms of a resolution with the Justice Department, subject to \u2026 approval of specific terms.\u201d Boeing investors appeared pleased by the terms of the deal. Shares of Boeing (BA), a component of the Dow Jones industrial average, were up 3% in morning trading. A design flaw hidden from regulators According to the charges, the company defrauded the Federal Aviation Administration during the process of certifying the 737 Max to carry its first passengers. The plane started service in 2017, but the two fatal crashes led to a 20-month grounding of the jets. Investigations revealed a design flaw in its autopilot system. Boeing has admitted responsibility for the fatal crashes, and that its employees withheld information about the design flaw from the FAA during certification. In January 2021, the federal prosecutors and Boeing reached an agreement to settle criminal charges and defer any prosecution on the matter. During a three-year probationary period that followed, Boeing agreed to improve its quality issues and transparency with the government. But the Alaska Airlines incident came just days before that probationary period was due to end, which led to a series of federal investigations into its practices. In May, the DOJ said it was\u00a0looking into bringing criminal charges\u00a0against Boeing once again due to a potential violation of that January 2021 agreement. Boeing had argued in its own court filings that it did not violate the agreement and that it should be spared prosecution. Sunday night\u2019s guilty plea, which came just before a midnight deadline set by the Justice Department, settled that issue. Cost of the guilty plea Under the original 2021 agreement, Boeing had agreed to pay $2.5 billion. But about 70% of that amount represented payments Boeing had already agreed to make to its airline customers as compensation for the 20-month grounding of the planes. Another $500 million was a fund to compensate crash victims. Only $243.6 million represented a criminal fine to the government, which would be doubled after the new guilty plea. Boeing has also agreed to spend $455 million on its compliance and safety programs over the next three years, which the government said will represent a 75% increase over what the company was spending annually on those programs. The company\u2019s various problems have caused deep financial losses since the second fatal 737 Max crash. It has posted core operating losses of $31.9 billion since the start of the 20-month grounding. It is also at risk of losing its investment-grade credit rating for the first time in its history. The company now has nearly $47 billion in long-term debt, and if its debt rating is downgraded to junk bond status, its cost of borrowing money will soar. But an additional fine in the hundreds of millions, rather than the billions, is still affordable for the company, despite its financial woes. No loss of government contracts The company avoided another serious penalty \u2014 the loss of the right to conduct business with the government. Such a penalty would have been a crippling blow for the planemaker. About 37% of its revenue in 2023 came from federal contracts. According to Richard Aboulafia, managing director at AeroDynamic Advisory, an aerospace and defense management consultant, the possibility of such a penalty was minimal as both Boeing and the federal government are heavily reliant on each other. Despite its troubles over the last five years, Boeing is still a key component of the US economy. It remains the nation\u2019s largest exporter, and has nearly 150,000 US employees. The company estimates its economic impact at $79 billion, supporting 1.6 million direct and indirect jobs at more than 9,900 suppliers spread across all 50 states. Its only significant rival for commercial aircraft, European manufacturer Airbus, has a backlog of more than 8,000 jet orders, meaning any Boeing customer placing an order for an Airbus plane today would have to wait nearly a decade for it to be delivered. The fraud charges encompassed in Sunday\u2019s guilty plea, and the investigations into the Alaska Airlines incident, are hardly the only safety issues being raised about Boeing planes currently. The Alaska Air incident brought renewed attention to a series of events, large and small, raising safety concerns aboard Boeing jets. More than a dozen whistleblowers who work or worked at the company or its contractors have come forward in recent months to speak to Congressional investigators and the media about their concerns procedures and practices at Boeing. Allegations include knowingly using flawed parts on planes and assembly procedures that did not meet Boeing\u2019s own standards. In each case, Boeing said it investigated the allegations and addressed them appropriately. Those allegations and the Alaska Air incident have resulted in a steady drumbeat of safety issues and incidents getting attention that might never have gotten attention in the past. For example, the FAA is in the process of publishing a notice Monday to airlines about a problem with oxygen masks on 2,600 US airplanes, spread between the 737 Max and some older versions of the 737 which could cause problems with the masks dropping down to passengers if they are needed. The problem can be addressed by inspections, according to the notice. Boeing said it had no comment on the FAA\u2019s airworthiness directive language, which was issued after Boeing had already issued a service bulletin itself to airlines that own the jets.

{"id": "2024_07_08_us_louisiana-ten-commandments-plaintiffs-lawsuit-reaj", "text": "The plaintiffs in a lawsuit challenging Louisiana\u2019s new law that requires the Ten Commandments be displayed in all public classrooms filed a motion for a preliminary injunction Monday,\u00a0asking the court to block\u00a0the law\u00a0from going into effect while\u00a0legal\u00a0proceedings play out. The filing seeks an order from the court that would prevent the state from\u00a0requiring public schools to\u00a0display\u00a0posters of the\u00a0Ten Commandments in all classrooms or implementing any other statute from the new law. That\u00a0lawsuit,\u00a0filed last month in federal\u00a0court, contends that the legislation\u00a0violates both US Supreme Court precedent and the First Amendment. House Bill 71, signed by Republican Gov. Jeff Landry in June, mandates that by January 1, 2025, a poster-sized display of a state-approved version of the Ten Commandments with \u201clarge, easily readable font\u201d be put in every classroom from kindergarten through the university-level at state-funded schools. Last month, Oklahoma State Superintendent of Public Instruction Ryan Walters issued a memo requiring that schools in the state incorporate the Bible and the Ten Commandments into their curriculum, calling the Bible an \u201cindispensable historical and cultural touchstone.\u201d The memo came after the state\u2019s Supreme Court blocked an effort to establish the first publicly funded religious charger school in the country, CNN previously reported. Plaintiffs in the Louisiana lawsuit argued mandating that the Ten Commandments be displayed in every classroom renders them \u201cunavoidable\u201d and \u201cunconstitutionally pressures students into religious observance, veneration, and adoption of the state\u2019s favored religious scripture.\u201d \u201cIt also sends the harmful and religiously divisive message that students who do not subscribe to the Ten Commandments \u2014 or, more precisely, to the specific version of the Ten Commandments that H.B. 71 requires schools to display \u2014 do not belong in their own school community and should refrain from expressing any faith practices of beliefs that are not aligned with the state\u2019s religious preferences,\u201d the complaint continues. The lawsuit\u00a0was\u00a0brought by the American Civil Liberties Union, the ACLU of Louisiana, Americans United for Separation of Church and State, and the Freedom From Religion Foundation,\u00a0on behalf of nine \u201cmulti-faith families\u201d with students enrolled in Louisiana public schools. It names state Superintendent of Education Cade Brumley, several other Louisiana State Board of Elementary and Secondary Education officials, and some local school boards. When asked about the lawsuit, Brumley told CNN in a statement last month that he looked forward to implementing the law. \u201cThe Ten Commandments law passed with overwhelming support in Louisiana\u2019s state legislature and was enthusiastically signed by our Governor,\u201d he said. \u201cI look forward to implementing the law and defending Louisiana\u2019s sovereign interest to select classroom content fundamental to America\u2019s foundation.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/08/us/louisiana-ten-commandments-plaintiffs-lawsuit-reaj/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/09/2024", "section": "us"}}

{"id": "2024_07_08_business_mcdonalds-menu-salads", "text": "McDonald\u2019s once poured big marketing dollars into its salads. But since 2020, greens have been off the menu. That\u2019s because the chain has concluded that when people go to McDonald\u2019s, they mostly want a burger and fries. \u201cIf people really want salads from McDonald\u2019s we will gladly relaunch salads,\u201d said Joe Erlinger, the president of McDonald\u2019s USA, in a June interview at the Wall Street Journal\u2019s annual Global Food Forum. \u201cBut what our experience has proven is that\u2019s not what the consumer\u2019s looking for from McDonald\u2019s,\u201d he added. \u201cThey\u2019re looking for great french fries, they\u2019re looking for a $5 meal deal, they\u2019re looking for a hot fresh sandwich. And so, that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to continue to provide them.\u201d Serving a healthy meal \u2014 or one fit for vegetarians, vegans or children \u2014 can help fast food chains avoid a so-called \u201cveto vote,\u201d which involves a group or family skipping a restaurant that doesn\u2019t have options for picky eaters or ones with dietary restrictions. For McDonald\u2019s, putting salads on the menu was likely a way to avoid the veto vote and stay atop recent healthy food trends. McDonald\u2019s had been serving salads for decades prior to the pandemic. Salads made it possible for some to eat at the chain while watching their diets (as one diet blogger noted, \u201cthe salads were the only half-healthy item\u00a0I could eat at McDonald\u2019s.\u201d) For others, it may have been more of a way to feel like they were eating healthy, even if they weren\u2019t. But in 2018, salads became more of a liability than a draw. That year, hundreds of people were sickened with an intestinal illness caused by consuming contaminated food or water. McDonald\u2019s salads were \u201cone likely source of these infections,\u201d the CDC said at the time. During the outbreak, the chain stopped selling its salads at 3,000 restaurants as a precautionary measure. And then, two years later, Covid hit, and restaurants facing labor shortages and tangled supply chains slimmed down their menus to focus on their most popular items. McDonald\u2019s removed salads from national menus in 2020 to help simplify restaurant operations, the company said. In 2022, the chain gave its franchise operators the option of serving pre-made salads but many decided not to, the Wall Street Journal reported. The strategy paid off. Sales ballooned as the chain came up with ways to update and market their core items. And now, the chain is focusing its efforts on convincing customers  to choose their $5 meal deal, rather than a competitor\u2019s, while the salad has been left behind. Another menu item that\u2019s not coming to McDonald\u2019s any time soon? A plant-based burger, which McDonald\u2019s tested a few years ago. \u201cI don\u2019t think the US consumer is \u2026 looking for McPlant or other plant-based proteins from McDonald\u2019s now,\u201d Erlinger said at the June conference, but added that \u201cit\u2019s a trend that we\u2019ll continue to monitor.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/08/business/mcdonalds-menu-salads/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/09/2024", "section": "us"}}
