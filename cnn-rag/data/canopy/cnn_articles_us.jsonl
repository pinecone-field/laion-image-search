The city of Fort Lupton and town of Platteville, Colorado, agreed on the settlement with the victim, Yareni Rios-Gonzalez, according to a release from the Fort Lupton Police Department. The settlement amount will be split equally between the town and city and paid by their insurers, according to attorney Eric M. Ziporin, whose office represents the city. Rios, who was a suspect in a road rage case, survived the September 2022 collision but suffered nine broken ribs, a broken arm and other injuries. \u201cThis voluntary settlement is to the mutual satisfaction of the parties, recognizes the gravity of this matter, and allows all parties to move forward,\u201d the Fort Lupton police department said. Fort Lupton police officer Jordan Steinke, who placed Rios in the vehicle, was found guilty last year of reckless endangerment and third-degree assault in the crash and was sentenced to serve 30 months of supervised probation and 100 hours of public service. On the day of the crash, Steinke joined a traffic stop in which officers had pulled over Rios, who authorities said was suspected of brandishing a gun at another driver earlier in the evening. Steinke put Rios into the cruiser of Platteville police officer Pablo Vasquez, who had parked in the middle of a railroad crossing. Body and dash camera video released by police showed Rios screaming for help as the train approached and slammed into the vehicle. Steinke argued during her trial that she didn\u2019t notice the location of the railroad tracks despite several warning signs, including one next to where she parked her vehicle. The officer said she was not fully aware of her surroundings because she was concerned about approaching a suspect who may have a gun. \u201cYou can only divide your attention so much,\u201d Steinke testified. CNN has sought comment from the Town of Platteville and an attorney for Rios regarding the settlement.

{"id": "2024_06_05_us_tennessee-lawsuit-state-statute-misinterpretation", "text": "Two families have filed a federal lawsuit against Tennessee Governor Bill Lee and the Williamson County School District, claiming their middle school kids were arrested, strip-searched, placed in solitary confinement, forced to undergo evaluations and placed on house arrest after officials misinterpreted a\u00a0Tennessee statute\u00a0and claimed that conversations between peers were \u201cthreats of mass violence.\u201d The lawsuit stems from two separate, unrelated incidents in August 2023 where a pair of students were accused of making threatening speech. However,\u00a0according to the lawsuit, the speech used by the middle schoolers in the two separate incidents did not rise to the level of a threat of mass violence nor did it amount to actions \u201cthat a reasonable person would conclude would lead to serious bodily injury\u201d or the death of two or more people, as defined in\u00a0Tennessee statute 39-16-517. The lawsuit challenges the way school officials applied\u00a0Tennessee statute 39-16-517, a 2021 \u201czero tolerance\u201d law\u00a0that addresses communications of threats of mass violence on school property or at school related events and requires districts to expel students for one year if they have been found to have made threats of mass violence. In an August 10, 2023 incident, a 14-year-old boy, identified as B.N., was accused\u00a0by a fellow student\u00a0of making threats about having a gun in his backpack, shooting up the school and having a bomb at home, claims the boy denied. The boy said his only mention of guns was when he told friends about a lunchtime conversation he had with another boy who had described the firearms his grandfather owned. Following interviews with school officials and police, B.N. \u201cwas taken into custody for violating\u201d the Tennessee statute captioned \u201cThreat of Mass Violence on School Property,\u201d the lawsuit said. He was placed on a 24-hour solitary confinement hold, and required to strip down and change into jail attire while an adult male guard was facing away, the lawsuit said. B.N. was incarcerated for four days and later placed under house arrest in the custody of his parents, according to the lawsuit.\u00a0He was \u201ccompletely banned from any Williamson County School grounds,\u201d the lawsuit said. B.N. also faced a 365-day suspension under the zero tolerance rules. According to court documents, after B.N. appealed the suspension, Williamson County Superintendent Jason Golden concluded that B.N created a rumor \u201cof a threat of a weapon\u201d at school, and although the \u201cjoke caused a disruption in school,\u201d he could return. \u201cYou can blame Governor Bill Lee,\u201d Page Middle School Principal Eric Lifsey allegedly told the 14-year-old boy and his mother. \u201cWe don\u2019t think of you as a threat. That was never the case,\u201d the lawsuit said. CNN reached out to Lifsey for comment. A spokesperson for Williamson County Schools said in an email to CNN that the district does not comment on pending litigation. Governor Lee\u2019s office has not responded to CNN\u2019s request for comment. \u201cThe new Tennessee zero tolerance law is being used as bludgeon against children who engage in innocuous conduct typical of all teenagers,\u201d Larry Crain, attorney for the families, said in a statement to CNN. The second incident occurred on August 22, 2023. According to the lawsuit, school officials said the text of a 13-year-old student at Fairview Middle School, identified as H.M., was deemed a \u201cThreat of Mass Violence.\u201d The text, which was sent in a school email group chat, said \u201cOn Thursday, we will kill all the Mexicos.\u201d According to court documents, the full transcript of the chat, later obtained by H.M.\u2019s mother, showed that other girls within the chat were teasing H.M. for \u201clooking Mexican because of her darker complexion.\u201d After one friend asked H.M. what she was doing on Thursday, H.M. \u201cresponded in jest, \u2018on Thursday we kill all the Mexico\u2019s,\u2019\u201d the lawsuit said. H.M. was arrested at school, brought to the Williamson County Juvenile Detention Center, forced to undergo a strip search, take a shower while a camera was trained on her and placed in a cell where she was questioned by individuals who asked if she had ever had sex, an abortion or suicidal thoughts. H.M. was also suspended from school and was ordered to be evaluated for mental illness. She was offered a choice of voluntary or involuntary commitment to determine if she was competent to stand trial, the lawsuit said. The lawsuit said the two students have \u201csuffered a severe and serious emotional injury\u201d and were \u201cunable to adequately cope with the mental stress\u201d from the circumstances surrounding their cases. Since filing the lawsuit, Crain said in his statement to CNN that his office has learned of \u201cseveral more children who have been wrongfully turned over to criminal prosecution\u201d by the school district. \u201cThis lawsuit seeks to declare this new law unconstitutional as applied to innocent acts of these children,\u201d he said. \u201cIt also seeks compensatory damages against the school district for violating its own internal school board policies and routinely referring children for criminal prosecution.\u201d Zero tolerance policies create \u2018threatening climate,\u2019 report says Everytown for Gun Safety released a 2022 report on how to stop shootings and gun violence in schools, in the wake of the mass shooting at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, earlier that year. The report, which calls for the need to take meaningful action against gun violence in US schools, focuses on approaches that have been proven most effective and says most students facing crises will never act out violently and must not be treated like criminals. So-called \u201czero tolerance\u201d policies, such as Tennessee\u2019s, \u201ccan end up punishing students who exhibit behavior that actually requires compassionate intervention,\u201d the report says. According to Everytown research, zero tolerance policies can create a \u201cthreatening climate that instills fear and erodes student trust,\u201d which can deter students from sharing information when they are concerned about classmates. The approach in these policies has had a \u201cprofoundly negative effect\u201d on students of color, the research shows. \u201cOur recommended practice is the opposite of \u2018zero tolerance\u2019 and is not based on a punitive or criminal justice approach and should not rely on exclusionary discipline as a means of intervention,\u201d Everytown\u2019s report says.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/05/us/tennessee-lawsuit-state-statute-misinterpretation/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/06/2024", "section": "us"}}

D-Day, which took place on June 6, 1944, was the first day of the\u00a0Normandy landings that laid the foundations for the Allied defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II. Woodson, who became seriously injured when his boat hit a mine, spent 30 hours treating fellow soldiers as the assault took place, according to\u00a0a press release from Van Hollen\u2019s office.\u00a0After the war, Woodson worked in clinical pathology for decades. He died in 2005 at 83 years old,\u00a0CNN previously reported. The\u00a0Distinguished Service Cross\u00a0is the second-highest military decoration that can be awarded to a member of the Army. Van Hollen, other lawmakers and Woodson\u2019s family have pushed for years for Woodson\u2019s actions to be recognized.\u00a0He hasn\u2019t been honored due to his race, they said. \u201cIt\u2019s an important moment so that we can say to the family that we recognize his heroism but it\u2019s also an important moment for the country to come to grips with its past because it\u2019s very clear that he did not receive this metal earlier because of the color of his skin,\u201d Van Hollen told CNN.

{"id": "us_beach-read-summer-books-cec", "text": "Summer is almost here, and you\u2019re looking forward to that long-awaited vacation. You can even picture it: \ufeffThe sun is shining, the waves are rolling gently and you\u2019re curling up with a book. Perhaps you\u2019re diving into a steamy romance novel or losing yourself in a page-turning thriller. Maybe a work of romantasy is captivating you instead. Whatever your flavor of escapism, it\u2019s likely that it could be classified as a \u201cbeach read\u201d \u2014 that oft-dismissed, unofficial category of books that readers gravitate toward in the warmer months. But what exactly constitutes a beach read? And where did that idea come from? Here\u2019s what to know about the popular term. What makes a \u2018beach read\u2019 A beach read is, naturally, the sort of book one might read at the beach \u2014 or at a lake, a resort or another typical summer destination. The books populating \u201cbeach read\u201d round-ups from booksellers, publishers and periodicals generally fall into the category of commercial fiction, designed to lure in readers with their saturated covers and playful illustrations. They\u2019re also almost always marketed to women. Amanda Bergeron acquires contemporary and historical book club fiction for Penguin Random House\u2019s imprint Berkley, which has published several authors whose books frequently appear on \u201cbeach read\u201d lists: Carley Fortune, Jasmine Guillory and Emily Henry, to name a few. When looking for the next big summer read, Bergeron says she\u2019s drawn to fast-paced stories with compelling characters. If it transports the reader to another location, all the better. \u201cIt\u2019s something that you\u2019re excited to spend time with and you can\u2019t put down \u2014 something that you\u2019re just so eager to get back to that it will go with you wherever you go, whether that\u2019s the park, the pool, the couch, your yard or even the beach,\u201d she says. Some books just scream summer, presenting an obvious opportunity to be marketed as a beach read, according to Bergeron. If it takes place in the summer, perhaps on an island or another breezy locale, there\u2019s a good chance it could be a beach read. Sometimes, the \u201cbeach read\u201d designation is so fitting that it announces itself in the title, like Fortune\u2019s 2022 romance novel \u201cEvery Summer After,\u201d Jenn McKinlay\u2019s 2023 rom-com \u201cSummer Reading\u201d or Henry\u2019s aptly named 2020 \u201cBeach Read.\u201d While the romance genre tends to dominate the \u201cbeach read\u201d landscape, the label isn\u2019t limited to romance, says Bergeron. A beach read can just as easily be a suspenseful thriller or a puzzle-box mystery novel \u2014 at least for Bergeron, it\u2019s a book that readers will want to discuss with others and bring along with them on vacation. In other words, a beach read doesn\u2019t ask the reader to ponder the grim realities of the modern world or plunge into the depths of the human experience. Rather, it offers a break from the slog of daily life and the constant drumbeat of depressing news stories. \u201cFor God\u2019s sake, I do not want to be challenged,\u201d Celeste Ballard declared in a 2014 humor column for The New Yorker about how to pick a summer read. \u201cNo \u2018hard\u2019 literature that I have to slog through to discover a deep and twisted meaning.\u201d Why some dislike the term \u2018beach read\u2019 Even though the \u201cbeach read\u201d designation can go hand in hand with commercial success (books labeled as such frequently make bestseller lists), it\u2019s also a loaded term. Author Jennifer Weiner, whose books are often categorized as beach reads, rejected the label for years before eventually embracing it \u2014 an internal conflict she examined in a 2020 essay for Goodreads. \u201cIt\u2019s not hard to discern a whiff of Coppertone-scented sexism in the label,\u201d she wrote. \u201cFast-paced, diverting books that are by or for men are called thrillers or mysteries or sometimes just plain old books, while the ladies get every kind of label, from chick lit to women\u2019s fiction to upmarket women\u2019s fiction to domestic fiction to, well, beach books.\u201d Books labeled as beach reads tend to emphasize plot and characters over elegant prose and heavier themes. To some, the implication is that the book is less serious or less worthy of one\u2019s time. Dakota Johnson, who launched a book club earlier this year, seemed to echo that assumption in an interview with Bustle: \u201cOur book club is literary fiction. It\u2019s not beach reads. It\u2019s not silly,\u201d she said. Though the term \u201cbeach read\u201d is commonly associated with frothy romance novels, Bergeron says that notion can be reductive. Beach reads can absolutely be frivolous \u2014 sometimes, that\u2019s exactly what you need \u2014 but some of the most celebrated beach reads of the past few years explore weightier topics all while delivering on the promise of fun. For instance, Fortune\u2019s 2023 bestseller \u201cMeet Me at the Lake\u201d depicted postpartum anxiety and the loss of a family member, while Kiley Reid\u2019s buzzy 2019 debut \u201cSuch A Fun Age\u201d dealt with race and privilege. \u201cA Love Like the Sun,\u201d a forthcoming novel from Riss M. Neilson, includes representation of chronic illness. \u201cThe fact that writers are able to do all that and offer readers an escape or a big heart hug is just really exciting,\u201d Bergeron says. The \u2018summer read\u2019 is a 19th century invention The term \u201cbeach read\u201d first appeared in literary periodicals around 1990, according to an article by the Los Angeles Public Library \u2014 though it\u2019s unclear who coined it. The concept of the summer read goes back much further, says Donna Harrington-Lueker, a professor of English and communications at Salve Regina University and author of Books for Idle Hours: Nineteenth-Century Publishing and the Rise of Summer Reading. Though now ingrained in our culture, the notion of summer reading was actually a 19th century invention of the publishing industry that sprung up in response to the creation of the summer vacation. Summer reading was initially a ritual enjoyed by rich men, who could afford to engage in leisure travel and unwind with poetry and literature, according to Harrington-Lueker. That changed in the mid-to-late 19th century as the US rapidly industrialized after the Civil War. The construction of railroads and grand hotels made summer vacations more accessible for the middle classes, giving rise to what Harrington-Lueker calls the \u201csummer novel.\u201d The summer novel was specifically geared toward women, Harrington-Lueker explains. The books generally took place over the summer at a resort and tended to follow the rhythms of the season: There might be scenes anchored around a picnic or a fireworks display, with detailed descriptions of what the female characters were wearing. Typically, the books ended with the heroine getting engaged. \u201cThese become lessons in how you practice summer leisure, and they become very popular,\u201d Harrington-Lueker says. The proliferation of the summer novel also generated backlash from some religious leaders who considered them a temptation and devoid of morality. The Reverend T. De Witt Talmage notably declared in an 1876 sermon that \u201cthere is more pestiferous trash read among the intelligent classes in July and August than in all the other ten months of the year.\u201d \u201cWould it not be an awful thing for you to be struck with lightning some day when you had in your hand one of these paper-covered romances\u2014the hero a Parisian rou\u00e9, the heroine an unprincipled flirt \u2026 ?\u201d he chided at the time. But throughout the late 1800s, the publishing industry worked to counter such notions and present summer reading as something desirable, Harrington-Lueker says. Magazines such as The Atlantic Monthly or Harper\u2019s ran advertisements with women clad in muslin dresses, novel in hand, while literary critics extolled the benefits of lighter reading. \u201cThe cakes and ale of literature have their legitimate time and place after the more solid intellectual dishes of the past season have been digested,\u201d an 1887 editorial in the literary review Book Buyer reads. Much like today, summer reads at the time were seen as an escape from the turmoil of the real world. One 1885 magazine column Harrington-Lueker encountered in her research called that summer\u2019s novels \u201cpeculiarly trivial\u201d and hypothesized that publishers were responding to the cholera epidemic, believing \u201cthat the general mind will be so far distraught by anxiety as to have no attention to spare for being critical.\u201d Reading for escape vs reading for enrichment As publishers solidified the association between summer and light reading, some institutions promoted more serious reading during the season, Harrington-Lueker said. One notable example is the Chautauqua movement, a late 19th and early 20th century educational program that sought to help Americans improve themselves through reading. From schools requiring students to read so-called classics in the summer to the anti-racist reading lists that were ubiquitous in 2020, the idea of summer as a time for personal enrichment persists today. Indeed, some people reach for heftier titles during vacation precisely because they finally have the time to dig into them. \u201cSummer reading becomes a point where people automatically begin to think, \u2018How should we be spending our summer? Should we be spending it with escapist fiction that\u2019s going to renew us, that\u2019s going to give us this time apart from a more difficult world? Or should we be using it to engage with topics of more consequence?\u2019\u201d Harrington-Lueker says. That push and pull between reading as escapism and reading as enrichment has long been a part of American culture, Harrington-Lueker adds. In recent years, she says she\u2019s observed that the titles appearing on summer reading lists from The New York Times, Oprah\u2019s Book Club and other cultural tastemakers seem less escapist than they were in previous years. But from Bergeron\u2019s perspective, plenty of readers are still looking for a respite \u2014 and this year\u2019s offerings (she name-checked Ashley Poston\u2019s \u201cA Novel Love Story,\u201d Kirsty Greenwood\u2019s \u201cThe Love of My Afterlife\u201d and Tia Williams\u2019 \u201cA Love Song for Ricki Wilde\u201d) give them plenty of opportunities to do so. \u201cReaders want to be transported,\u201d she says. \u201c(When you think of an) escape often you think light, but I think it\u2019s the ability to inhabit another world or another set of shoes and just spend time in those pages.\u201d At a time when the world feels uncertain and overwhelming, Bergeron says, the beach read beckons.", "source": "http://cnn.com/us/beach-read-summer-books-cec/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/06/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_05_business_walmart-hourly-worker-bonuses", "text": "Walmart, America\u2019s largest private-sector employer, is starting a bonus program for its hourly employees. The company said on Wednesday that the program will be aimed at rewarding employees who stay with the company long-term, with employees able to earn up to a maximum of $1,000 for those who have been with the company 20 years or more. The company said any hourly store employee who has been with the company for a year or more is eligible for the bonus program, with those full-time employees with at least a year but less than five years getting an annual bonus of $350. The amount of the bonus then increases from there with seniority. Walmart has an outsized impact on the labor market for hourly workers, and has been grappling with finding and retaining the workers it needs in a tight labor market. It said it has raised hourly wages by around 30% over the last five years and that its average US hourly wage now is close to $18. Its starting pay ranges from $14 to $19 depending on the store and local market. A $1,000 bonus comes to just under 50 cents an hour for employees working a 40-hour week and equal to about 3% of annual pay for those full-time workers making that average hourly pay. The company has 1.6 million US employees, of which nearly 1.5 million are hourly workers. It said this new program covers about 700,000 of those hourly employees who work in stores. Store managers and supervisors already qualified for a bonus program, which is paid out in March after the close of the company\u2019s fiscal year at the end of January. Walmart boosted the average pay of its store managers from $117,000 to $128,000, or by just over 9%, the retailer announced earlier this year. \u2013 CNN\u2019s Nathaniel Meyersohn contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/05/business/walmart-hourly-worker-bonuses/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/06/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_05_us_gilgo-beach-murder-rex-heurmann-additional-killings", "text": "Rex Heuermann, the suspect in the Gilgo Beach killings, is expected to be indicted Thursday on new murder charges in the killings of two additional women, multiple law enforcement sources tell CNN. The former New York architect was taken into custody in July and has already been charged with murder in the deaths of four women who have come to be known as the \u201cGilgo Four.\u201d Law enforcement officials say the new murder charges are related to two additional victims, Jessica Taylor and Valerie Mack, and come from a sweeping expansion of the investigation into Heuermann following his arrest last summer. Heuermann\u2019s arrest kicked off a media frenzy, with many wondering whether police had finally caught what the Gilgo Beach community had long feared was a serial killer responsible for a string of unsolved killings that took place over decades. At least 11 sets of human remains have been found on Long Island\u2019s Suffolk County, including the four women Heuermann has been charged with killing: Melissa Barthelemy, Megan Waterman, Amber Costello and Maureen Brainard-Barnes. Heuermann was charged with three deaths in 2023 and with the death of Brainard-Barnes in January. He has pleaded not guilty to all murder charges and is being held without bail. His attorney, Michael Brown, told reporters in January that Heuermann\u00a0maintains his innocence and is looking forward to fighting the charges. CNN affiliate WABC reported police recently searched Long Island\u2019s Manorville and North Sea in connection with the investigation, where the remains of three women were found years ago. Investigators uncovered evidence in the searches of Manorville and Heuermann\u2019s home earlier this year that helped advance the investigation, according to the law enforcement sources. The remains of Taylor and Mack were found in Manorville, according to police. Manorville, a community in eastern Long Island, is about 40 miles northeast of where the bodies of the \u201cGilgo Four\u201d were discovered. Mack was a 24-year-old Philadelphia mother who went missing in 2000 and whose partial remains were discovered in the Manorville woods later that year. More remains that matched her DNA were recovered along the marshy area of Gilgo Beach in 2011. Partial remains belonging to 20-year-old Taylor were found in Manorville in 2003, and additional remains were found on Gilgo Beach in 2011. John Ray, a lawyer who represents Taylor\u2019s family, previously said he did not know whether Heuermann was connected to Taylor\u2019s death. The search in North Sea\u00a0\u2013\u00a0roughly 65 miles northeast of Gilgo Beach \u2013\u00a0was related to the unsolved killing\u00a0of 28-year-old Sandra Costilla,\u00a0whose body was found in a wooded area of North Sea in 1993, the law enforcement sources told CNN.\u00a0Suffolk County Police are investigating to see if Costilla\u2019s death is connected to Heuermann, the sources said. According to officials briefed on the investigation, detectives believe there may have been more killings \u2013 a belief that spurred investigators to expand their case, re-examine dump sites and conduct further searches at Heuermann\u2019s home, as well as go over unsolved missing persons cases. \u201cWe are not near the end of this investigation,\u201d\u00a0said one law enforcement official involved in the sweeping case. \u201cWe are very much at the beginning.\u201d \u2018A flood of evidence\u2019 After Heuermann\u2019s arrest last summer, police said the investigation was far from over. They zeroed in on the Massapequa home where he had lived quietly for years with his wife, daughter and stepson. Investigators used police dogs and ground-penetrating radar to search the home in July, uncovering over 280 firearms, more than 40 of which were possessed illegally, police said. Authorities also looked into areas in Las Vegas and South Carolina where Heuermann owned property. Tierney told reporters last summer that investigators were working with \u201ca flood of evidence.\u201d A few weeks ago, police once again searched the Massapequa home and were seen carrying boxes out of the house. Robert Macedonia, the attorney of Heuermann\u2019s estranged wife Asa Ellerup, confirmed that police had a warrant for the search. Ellerup filed for divorce days after Heuermann\u2019s arrest last year, but still visits him weekly, according to a statement released by her attorneys in March.

A new national stock exchange, based in Dallas, and backed by Wall Street heavyweights like BlackRock and Citadel, is looking to take on the world-famous New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq. The newly formed TXSE Group announced its plans to file for registration with the US Securities and Exchange Commission later this year. The group is backed by more than two dozen investors with $120 million in funding \u2013 that makes it the most well-capitalized exchange entrant to even file with the SEC. \u201cWe\u2019re thrilled to bring to fruition the long-held vision for a national stock exchange in Texas,\u201d\u00a0TXSE Group founder and CEO James Lee said in a statement on Wednesday. \u201cTexas and the other states in the southeast quadrant have become economic powerhouses. Combined with the demand we are seeing from investors and corporations for expanded alternatives to trade and list equities, this is an opportune time to build a major, national stock exchange in Texas.\u201d The group said it was hoping to benefit from the more than 5,200 private equity-sponsored companies in the region that may want to go public. Lee told\u00a0The Wall Street Journal that the group hopes to officially launch its exchange in 2026. The problem with going public America has lost half its public companies since the 1990s. Back in 1996, there were 8,000 companies on US exchanges. Today that count has dropped by more than 50% to just 3,700, according to\u00a0data from\u00a0the Center for Research in Security Prices. It\u2019s not that America has half as many companies as 30 years ago \u2013 it\u2019s that companies are increasingly staying private, largely outside the scrutiny of the public eye and markets. Intensified reporting requirements, higher litigation expenses, costly regulations, overbearing board governance, shareholder activism, heightened public scrutiny and the pressure of quarterly earnings have driven companies away from public markets. There are now about five times as many private equity-backed firms in the US as there are\u00a0publicly held companies, according to economists at Wells Fargo. The trend has been growing for some time. In 1999, the average US technology firm transitioned to the public markets after four years, Wells Fargo research shows. By 2019, that figure increased to 11 years. \u201cCompanies that remain private can avoid the burden and cost of regulatory requirements and focus on long-term strategic plans,\u201d they wrote. Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase, expressed worry about the changes in his annual shareholder letter in April. \u201cThis trend is serious,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe really need to consider: Is this the outcome we want?\u201d The TXSE Group said in a press release on Wednesday that it hopes to help relieve some of that burden. \u201cTXSE\u2019s planned launch comes as changes in the equity markets provide an opportunity for greater alignment and more competition,\u201d they wrote. \u201cCorporate issuers and exchange-traded product sponsors are demanding more stability and predictability around listing standards and associated costs. TXSE intends to expand access to US capital markets for all investors, while providing greater access and alignment for public companies and those seeking access to public capital.\u201d While the most popular exchanges in the US are located in New York City, there are about 13 stock exchanges around the country including in Philadelphia and Miami. This exchange, said Lee, would mostly function to list businesses located in Texas and the southeast quadrant of the United States.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/05/investing/texas-stock-exchange/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/06/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_05_politics_takeaways-hunter-biden-day-3", "text": "The third day of the Hunter Biden trial saw his ex-wife and an ex-girlfriend testify\u00a0in vivid detail about his drug addiction. Also introduced\u00a0as evidence Wednesday\u00a0was the gun Biden bought in October 2018 that\u2019s at the center of the charges against him. The salesman who sold Biden the gun testified that he saw him fill out the federal form\u00a0on which\u00a0he\u2019s accused of falsely claiming\u00a0he wasn\u2019t using drugs. As the day wrapped up, prosecut\ufeffors announced that they have a half-dozen \u201cshorter\u201d\u00a0witnesses remaining\u00a0and might be prepared to rest their case as soon as\u00a0Thursday afternoon. After that, Biden\u2019s defense lawyers can put on a case\u00a0if they want to. Here\u2019s what to know from Day 3: A tale of two exes When Biden\u2019s ex-wife, Kathleen Buhle, who prosecutors subpoenaed to testify, took the witness stand, members of the jury sat up straight in their seats, leaned in and started tuning in. But Buhle\u2019s brief, staccato answers and subdued tone didn\u2019t seem to pull in the jurors. Buhle told the jury that in 2018, she found drug paraphernalia in Hunter\u2019s car, which she checked occasionally because she wanted to make sure there wasn\u2019t anything illegal in the vehicle \u201cwhen my daughters would use his car.\u201d\u00a0However, Buhle couldn\u2019t pinpoint exactly when in 2018 she found paraphernalia in Hunter\u2019s car. Zoe Kestan, another one of Hunter\u2019s former romantic partners, proved to be a much more captivating witness for the jury.\u00a0She described months of partying, clubbing and helping him score drugs from California to Rhode Island. Biden also gave her a brief wave when she identified him in court. Her delivery was animated, and she volunteered interesting details in her answers, sprinkling in the names of upscale restaurants that they dined at in New York City and which fancy hotels they stayed at in Los Angeles. It seemed like some of the jurors were hanging on every word she said. More importantly for the prosecutors\u2019 case, Kestan provided direct eyewitness testimony of Hunter Biden doing drugs as late as mid-September 2018, several weeks before he bought the gun. She said she watched him smoking crack during one of their liaisons in Malibu. This is the closest that prosecutors have come so far to connecting the timeline of Hunter\u2019s drug use to his gun purchase. The \u2018whale hunter\u2019 The salesman who sold Hunter the gun, Gordon Cleveland, testified as a prosecution witness and told the jury that he watched Hunter Biden mark \u201cno\u201d on the question of whether he was a user of illegal drugs. That is essential testimony for the special counsel. Counts 1 and 2 of the three-count felony indictment are tied directly to Hunter\u2019s alleged false statement on that form about his drug use. Later, when he was cross-examined by Biden\u2019s attorney Abbe Lowell, Cleveland embraced his reputation as a \u201cwhale hunter,\u201d chuckling when Lowell brought up the term and bragging about his ability to close deals for pricey guns. Lowell is pursuing this line of inquiry because in opening statements he told the jury that Cleveland essentially peddled the gun to Biden. \u201cI could sell whatever you had. It\u2019s just what I did,\u201d Cleveland said, explaining why his colleagues called him a whale hunter. This included attempts to push his customers to buy more expensive guns, he conceded. But Cleveland said he did that because the pricier guns are more reliable and high quality and wouldn\u2019t try to sell \u201cjunk\u201d to customers. He \u201cwas making the same pay\u201d if someone was buying a gun or not. More embarrassing Hunter photos Pictures of a hotel room that Hunter Biden shared with Kestan in 2018 were shown to the jury. Kestan pointed out several crack pipes, one of which was broken, as well as baking powder, spoons, bowls and chop sticks \u2013 all used for the drugs he was taking and the cocaine he was cooking into crack, she testified. Prosecutors showed a photo of Hunter Biden wearing a shirt that said \u201cADDICTED,\u201d with an Adidas logo that was made to look like a marijuana plant. \u201cI thought that was funny because he didn\u2019t smoke weed,\u201d Kestan said. Another image shown to the jury was of Hunter Biden in a bathtub holding what Kestan said was a crackpipe. What\u2019s next? In opening statements, prosecutors signaled a specific order for their expected witnesses, and they suggested that after Buhle and Kestan testified, they\u2019d put Hallie Biden, the widow of Beau Biden, on the stand. However, after Kestan finished, prosecutors moved on to Gordon, to testify about the gun sale. It\u2019s not clear what may have motivated the potential order adjustment, and it\u2019s still expected that Hallie will testify, perhaps on Thursday, as prosecutors wind down their case. But there was high anticipation for Hallie\u2019s testimony on Wednesday. After all, she represents Biden family drama \u2013 after losing Beau to brain cancer in 2015, she started dating his brother Hunter, who \u201cintroduced\u201d her to crack cocaine, which she later started using herself. In addition to Hallie Biden, prosecutors are aiming to present testimony from several federal agents, including DEA officials who can describe various drug lingo that came up in Hunter Biden\u2019s texts. This story has been updated with additional reporting.

{"id": "2023_08_05_us_mari-gilbert-shannan-gilgo-beach", "text": "Mari Gilbert did not live to witness the arrest of an architect from Long Island suspected of killing four young women whose remains were discovered in Gilgo Beach more than a decade ago. But the search for her daughter Shannan Gilbert, who went missing in May 2010, ultimately led Suffolk County police to the bodies of those women, wrapped in camouflaged burlap and discarded along a desolate beachfront parkway.  Shannan Gilbert was 23 when she vanished. Her remains were found in December 2011 in another beach community just down the road. Authorities have said her death may have been accidental and not related to the other killings \u2013 a long dormant multiple homicide case known as the \u201cGilgo Four.\u201d Mari Gilbert, in the final years of her life, pressured police to take her daughter\u2019s disappearance seriously. She fought tirelessly to ensure that Shannan and the other victims would not be forgotten.  \u201cMari saw Shannan as an unintended hero because it was Shannan\u2019s disappearance that ironically caused all the others to have been found and, now, to have at least one arrest,\u201d said John Ray, an attorney for the Gilbert family.  Beyond the string of murders and the long elusive hunt for a suspected serial killer is the Hamlet-like tragedy of a troubled family whose legacy may be helping solve what police called \u201cone of the most consequential homicide investigations in the history of Long Island.\u201d \u201cWho knows what other lives have been saved because of the exposure of all this? And now the arrest of an alleged murderer,\u201d Ray said.  On July 23, 2016, tragedy again befell the family. Mari Gilbert was 52 when she was stabbed hundreds of times with a 15-inch kitchen knife by another daughter, Sarra. She was then bludgeoned to death with a fire extinguisher, according to a court document. Sarra Gilbert, who Ray said suffered both emotionally and mentally after her sister\u2019s death, was sentenced to a prison term of 25 years to life. \u201cMari understood that one way of finding at least a shred of meaning in the loss of her daughter was that her disappearance led to the discovery of those four women several months later, and that without Shannan there would be no case, there would be no search for the killer,\u201d said Robert Kolker, the author of the 2013 book \u201cLost Girls: An Unsolved American Mystery,\u201d which closely examined the case.  \u201cShe understood that very well, and I believe she found some redemption in that idea: that Shannan\u2019s loss helped others learn the truth.\u201d \u2018I\u2019m glad I\u2019m still alive to see it\u2019  Shannan Gilbert\u2019s disappearance on May 1, 2010, was followed by years without an arrest, or suspect, or promising leads and \u2013 as Kolker put it \u2013 \u201cbarely a peep from the police or the authorities.\u201d That is until July 13, 2023, when police arrested Rex Heuermann, an architectural consultant who worked in Manhattan and lived with his wife and children in Massapequa Park, across the bay from where the remains of the women were found, on the southeastern edge of Nassau County. Heuermann has pleaded not guilty to the murders of Megan Waterman, Melissa Barthelemy and Amber Lynn Costello. In January, he was charged with the murder of a fourth woman, Maureen Brainard-Barnes, who was 25 years when she was last seen in July 2007. He also pleaded not guilty in that case. Heuermann, 60, is expected to be indicted on two additional murder charges when he appears in court Thursday, according to multiple law enforcement sources. \u201cOf all the family members, Mari was the one who got the most out of the police, forced them to do things they otherwise wouldn\u2019t,\u201d Kolker wrote in the new afterword of his book \u2013 which was adapted into a 2020 article in New York Magazine. \u201cAnd she didn\u2019t just make a lot of noise; the experience of fighting on behalf of her daughter Shannan transformed Mari, too.\u201d Mari Gilbert in 2011 accused police of botching the investigation, which she described as \u201cclownish.\u201d For years, Gilbert and others maintained that investigators dragged their feet because the victims, like Shannan, were sex workers.  \u201cWe kept all the cases alive by keeping alive the Shannan Gilbert case,\u201d Ray said. \u201cThere\u2019s no question of that at all. The police had entered into a dreamland of waiting it out.\u201d A major corruption scandal within Suffolk County law enforcement did not help matters. In 2015, Suffolk County Police Chief James Burke was arrested and accused of beating a man who allegedly broke into his vehicle in 2012 and stole a bag that contained sex toys and porn, and then conspiring to block the FBI investigation into his actions, according to court records. Burke ultimately pleaded guilty to a civil rights violation and conspiracy to obstruct justice. He was sentenced to 46 months in prison, the records show. Notably, a day after Burke was arrested, the Suffolk County police deputy commissioner at the time announced the FBI would join the investigation into the Gilgo Beach murders. Kolker said Mari Gilbert and the other family members meanwhile banded together to become \u201ca powerful force for advocacy.\u201d \u201cThey reminded people that there were real human beings at stake here, that this wasn\u2019t just a Hannibal Lecter movie,\u201d he said.  \u201cBut among all the family members, Mari was the one who was the most provocative personality. She was the one who when things started to get quiet would stand up and make some noise and make sure that the police responded.\u201d The day after Heuermann\u2019s arrest as he left work near the Empire State Building, Gilbert\u2019s second eldest daughter, Sherre, expressed her support for the families of the victims on a Facebook page titled \u201cPraying for Shannan Maria Gilbert.\u201d The \u201ctime, effort, and dedication my mom & I put into this case (wasn\u2019t) wasted\u2026 I wished, hoped & prayed for this day. I\u2019m glad I\u2019m still alive to see it,\u201d she wrote.  Kolker, whose book was in 2020 turned into a film for Netflix also titled \u201cLost Girls,\u201d said: \u201cI think Mari would have been much the same way if she were here. She would have celebrated the arrest and voiced support for the other families.\u201d \u2018Some things that we could have done better\u2019 In February 2022, Suffolk County Police Commissioner Rodney Harrison formed a multiagency task force, including state police and the FBI, to revisit the case \u2013 an effort that led to Heuermann\u2019s arrest.  Within months investigators made a \u201csignificant\u201d discovery that led them to focus on Heuermann, according to the prosecution\u2019s bail application.  Prosecutors said police found a first-generation Chevrolet Avalanche \u2013 the same type of truck a witness believed to have been driven by Costello\u2019s killer \u2013 registered to Heuermann at the time of the murders. Investigators later recovered DNA from a pizza crust that was thrown away outside Heuermann\u2019s Manhattan office and linked it to the alleged killer of the Gilgo Four. After the arrest, Harrison defended the police investigation. \u201cSince the discovery of the first victim, there has been a lot of scrutiny and criticism regarding how this investigation was handled,\u201d he said.  \u201cI will tell you this, the investigators were never discouraged. They continued and uncovered evidence and followed leads. They never stopped working and will continue to work tirelessly until we bring justice to all the families involved.\u201d Harrison later told CNN, \u201cThere might have been some things that we could have done better but we\u2019re here today and we\u2019re announcing that we\u2019re placing this animal under arrest.\u201d Last year, Suffolk County authorities announced they had identified another Gilgo Beach murder victim \u2013 known as \u201cFire Island Jane Doe\u201d \u2013 as Karen Vergata, a 34-year-old escort from Manhattan who went missing on Valentine\u2019s Day in 1996. Vergata\u2019s remains were among nearly a dozen sets of human remains found along Ocean Parkway on the South Shore of Long Island between 2010 and 2011, including Shannan Gilbert and the Gilgo Four victims.  Suffolk County District Attorney Ray Tierney told reporters at the time there are \u201cno charges at this time\u201d and investigators continueds to work on the case. Tierney did not link Heuermann to Vergata\u2019s death.  \u201cIt\u2019s sort of seems like we\u2019re on the road to getting answers for some of these deaths,\u201d Kolker said. \u201cBut there are many, many unsolved murders still in Long Island along the shore\u2026 There\u2019s a glimmer of progress now. But along with celebrating what\u2019s happening, I think a lot of people are asking what took so long.\u201d \u2018She does not deserve to be forgotten\u2019  Early on the morning of May 1, 2010, Gilbert \u2013 who lived in New Jersey \u2013 traveled with her driver from Manhattan to meet a man at his home in Oak Beach on Long Island. Gilbert appeared \u201cirrational\u201d at some point and the man contacted the driver, according to a Suffolk County police online summary of the Gilgo Beach homicide investigation. She fled on foot and approached two homeowners in the area before she vanished.  The driver and the man Gilbert visited that morning were investigated and cleared of criminal involvement in her death, according to police.  An analysis by the FBI and a psychiatrist of a 911 call Gilbert made at the time, as well as the circumstances of her disappearance, found that her death was \u201cnot consistent with her being the victim of violence or of a violent offender,\u201d according to Suffolk County police.  In the frantic 911 call, Gilbert screamed, \u201cThey\u2019re trying to kill me,\u201d according to CNN affiliate WPIX-TV. The search for her led to the discovery of the other victims \u2013 more than seven months after Gilbert\u2019s disappearance. Gilbert\u2019s remains were found in Oak Beach a year later.  In 2016, Mari Gilbert and Ray held a news conference to announce that an independent autopsy on Shannan\u2019s remains found that her death was \u201cconsistent with homicidal strangulation\u201d but there was insufficient information to determine a definitive cause of death. Holding a photo of her eldest child, Mari Gilbert told reporters that day, \u201cThis is my daughter Shannan. She was not perfect. No one is perfect. But she was loved. She was cared for. She does not deserve to be forgotten.\u201d She kept on living \u2018despite such terrible loss\u2019  Over the years, Mari Gilbert\u2019s daughters often appeared alongside her at news conferences and vigils for the victims.  But Ray said daughter Sarra was never the same after Shannan went missing and her remains later discovered.  \u201cShe was driven mad quite substantially by the death of her beloved sister,\u201d he said. \u201cShe looked up to Shannan as, you know, a demigod and she was brokenhearted by what had happened and it was all simmering in that little mind all that time.\u201d On an afternoon in July 2016, Sarra Gilbert invited her mother to her home. She stabbed Mari Gilbert 227 times, bludgeoned her with a fire extinguisher and sprayed fire extinguisher foam into her mouth, according to a 2021 ruling upholding Sarra\u2019s conviction by the New York State Supreme Court, Appellate Division, Third Judicial Department. Sherre Gilbert in 2016 wrote on Facebook: \u201cSo as a lot of you may know, my mother passed away yesterday. She was murdered by my sister, Sarra who was battling a mental illness for 2 1/2 years. My sister Stevie and I are incredibly devastated beyond words as our mother was the backbone of the family.\u201d Police responded to a call from one of Sarra\u2019s sisters. Outside the home, Sherre Gilbert told officers that Sarra \u201ccalled her that morning and told her that she was hearing voices,\u201d the document said.  Inside, police found Mari Gilbert\u2019s body and Sarra smoking a cigarette. In body camera footage played for the jury at trial, Sarra told police in a soft voice, \u201cI killed my mom,\u201d though she later said Gilbert was still alive. Sarra told police that before the killing she heard voices referring to her mother as the \u201cdevil\u201d and a \u201cbad God\u201d and directing her to kill Gilbert, according to the document. \u201cMari loved her daughter,\u201d Ray said. \u201cShe went to her death \u2026 knowing when she was going to that house that she was in danger.\u201d Sarra\u2019s younger sister, Stevie Smith, testified for the prosecution at trial, saying that Sarra \u201chad a strained relationship with the victim, who had obtained custody of defendant\u2019s son following a February 2016 incident in which defendant drowned a puppy in front of the child,\u201d the document said.  The prosecution maintained that Sarra plotted the killing after her mother had Sarra arrested months earlier for killing the puppy. The defense argued that Sarra harbored delusions fueled by years of abuse and mental illness. A forensic psychologist testified for the defense that Sarra suffered from \u201cacute symptoms of schizophrenia at the time of the killing.\u201d \u201cWe have no doubt that defendant suffers from a debilitating mental illness that blurs the lines of fiction and reality, and we are certainly sympathetic to the difficult life circumstances she has endured,\u201d the ruling said. \u201cThe proof, however, reasonably supports the jury\u2019s finding that, at the time of the killing, defendant had the substantial capacity to know and appreciate both the nature and consequences of her conduct and that such conduct was wrong.\u201d Kolker, in the 2020 afterword to his best-selling book, wrote: \u201cMari\u2019s life, transformed by the death of one daughter, had been ended by another.\u201d  \u201cShe was not a perfect person and she was a confrontational person,\u201d Kolker said in an interview. \u201cBut in her final years, she became the caregiver for another sick daughter of hers. And her tragic death was awful. But everyone I talked to who knew her well said that in her final years she had grown as a person and really found a way to keep on living despite such terrible loss.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/08/05/us/mari-gilbert-shannan-gilgo-beach/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/06/2024", "section": "us"}}

At issue is the publication of an article that said Palestinians are living under a \u201cbrutally sophisticated structure of oppression\u201d by Israel. The board of directors for the Columbia Law Review said in a statement obtained by CNN that the website has been \u201ctemporarily suspended\u201d because the \u201cpiece had not been subject to the usual processes of review or selection for article.\u201d The website has been offline since Monday, with a message that it\u2019s \u201cunder maintenance\u201d when visited as of Wednesday morning. The New York Times was first to report the outage and the board\u2019s statement. The Columbia Law Review Association is an independent nonprofit organization with its own board of directors, and it is not governed by Columbia University or its law school. The board said it asked the student editors on Sunday to open up the review of the article so \u201call student editors would have an opportunity to read the piece, raise any questions or concerns, and otherwise engage.\u201d \u201cWe thought that was necessary in fairness to student editors who had not been part of the group working on the piece and were not previously aware of the piece\u2019s content or even its existence. Whatever your views of this piece, it will clearly be controversial and potentially have an impact on all associated with the Review,\u201d the statement said. The piece was published Monday, despite the board saying it had asked for a delay in publishing until June 7 pending more review. \u201cWe also would like to get the website back up as soon as possible, as having it down is now preventing access to the Review\u2019s scholarship,\u201d it said. The article that sparked the controversy was written by Rabea Eghbariah, a doctoral candidate at Harvard University. He argues that a new legal concept called Nakba is needed to describe more accurately the current condition of Palestinians. It derives from \u201cal-Nakba,\u201d which Palestinians have used to refer to the 1948 establishment of Israel, and means \u201ccatastrophe\u201d in Arabic. \u201cThe attempt to silence my legal scholarship on the Nakba by shutting down the entire Columbia Law Review website is not only reflective of a pervasive and anti-intellectual Palestine exception to academic freedom but is also a testament to a culture of Nakba denialism,\u201d Eghbariah said in a statement to CNN. Roughly 700,000 Palestinians\u00a0fled or were expelled from their homes\u00a0by armed Jewish groups seeking to establish the state of Israel during Al Nakba. More than 15,000 Palestinians\u00a0were also killed\u00a0and 531 towns and villages destroyed during al-Nakba, according to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics, an institute of the Palestinian Authority. \u201cThe intervention by the CLR Board of Directors exposes, once again, that US academic institutions are, in fact, a very hostile environment for Palestinian voices and thought. What is so scary about Palestinians speaking their truth?\u201d It\u2019s the latest flashpoint for Columbia University that has grappled with demonstrations from pro-Palestinian protesters who put up encampments on the school\u2019s grounds protesting Israel\u2019s war in Gaza. On Tuesday, it settled a lawsuit from a Jewish student that said the school failed provide a safe environment.

{"id": "2023_07_20_us_gilgo-beach-killings-supect-rex-heuermann-wife-asa-ellerup", "text": "In her more than 27 years of marriage to Rex Heuermann, Asa Ellerup likely did not know about the gruesome double life her husband is accused of living, Suffolk County\u2019s top cop says. \u201cIf you ask me, I don\u2019t believe, that they knew about this double life that Mr. Heuermann was living,\u201d Suffolk County Police Commissioner Rodney Harrison said of the suspect\u2019s family. But authorities were not ruling anything out yet and were continuing to collect information \u201cto see if the family might have known exactly what Mr. Heuermann was up to,\u201d Harrison told CNN\u2019s Erica Hill in a July 2023 interview.  That month, Heuermann was arrested and charged with murder in connection to the killings of three of the \u201cGilgo Four,\u201d a group of four women whose remains were found along a short stretch of Long Island\u2019s Gilgo Beach in 2010. He also was identified as the prime suspect in the disappearance and killing of the fourth woman, Maureen Brainard-Barnes, who was 25 years old when she was last seen. He was charged with her murder in January and pleaded not guilty.  Heuermann, 60, is expected to be indicted on two additional murder charges when he appears in court Thursday, according to multiple law enforcement sources. Less than a week after her husband\u2019s arrest, Ellerup filed for divorce, her attorney Robert Macedonio told CNN. He did not comment further on the matter. She was shocked to hear what her husband is accused of, Harrison said. But she unknowingly played a key role in her husband\u2019s arrest: it was her DNA, among other evidence, that authorities say helped tie Heuermann to the crimes.  Here\u2019s what we know about his wife, their life together and the unexpected role she played in the case. The two have been married for 27 years  Heuermann and Ellerup were married in April 1996, the suspect said in a 2018 deposition. Since then, they lived in Heuermann\u2019s red and green childhood home in the Long Island suburb of Massapequa Park with their daughter and Heuermann\u2019s stepson.  But despite their long stint in the neighborhood \u2013 and though Heuermann\u2019s life was long rooted in the same community, neighbors knew little detail about the family.  Neighbors described the home as creepy and the family as distant, according to the Long Island Press, a monthly magazine serving Long Island.  \u201cThe family is very to themselves, quiet,\u201d neighbor Frankie Musto told the publication. \u201cWe never saw anything suspicious.\u201d In his 2018 deposition, Heuermann said he had been married once before. That marriage, he said, lasted three years and they had no children.   Wife\u2019s hair found with all three victims When the victims were first discovered, there were pieces of degraded hair recovered by authorities \u2013 but DNA testing at the time could not provide the answers investigators hoped for.  Technological improvements soon helped yield results.  Hair that is now believed to belong to Ellerup \u2013 which presumably had been unintentionally carried by the suspect on his clothes \u2013 was found on or near the three victims, prosecutors alleged in the bail application, citing DNA testing.  That DNA came from 11 bottles inside a garbage can outside the Heuermann home, the court document says. Authorities had been surveilling Heuermann and his family for months after they identified him as a suspect in early 2022, and during that time collected DNA samples from items the family threw away.  Though her hair was found with the victims, Ellerup and their daughter were both traveling when the killings were committed and Heuermann was \u201calone in the tri-state area,\u201d Suffolk County District Attorney Ray Tierney said at a news conference last summer.  \u201cIt\u2019s very significant in as much as it then limits it down to him,\u201d criminal defense attorney Joey Jackson told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper about the finding. \u201cIf the suspect\u2019s wife is out of town, then why would her hair be there if he\u2019s in town?\u201d  Suffolk County authorities say DNA evidence also linked Heuermann to a male hair found on the burlap sack where one victim\u2019s remains were found. Shocked, disgusted, embarrassed Harrison told CNN last summer he was informed that once authorities told Ellerup and her daughter about the crimes Heuermann is accused of, the two were \u201cshocked, they were disgusted, they were embarrassed.\u201d Their reaction, he said, is why he believes they were not aware of what he was doing.  \u201cBut, time will tell,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd once again, there are still a lot more questions that need to be done to the family and friends.\u201d CNN has made multiple attempts to contact Heuermann\u2019s wife and daughter. The attorneys representing Ellerup said last July she and her family \u201care going through a devastating time in their lives\u201d and are asking for privacy. \u201cThe sensitive nature of her husband\u2019s arrest is taking an emotional toll on the immediate and extended family, especially their elderly family members,\u201d said a statement from the Macedonio & Duncan law firm.  \u201cMs. Ellerup does not wish to comment further and has requested the public and press to please respect the family\u2019s privacy at this time.\u201d Following his arrest, Heuermann was remanded without bail. He entered a not guilty plea through his attorney.

Long Phi Pham is accused of conspiring with others who bet the player would underperform in a January 26 game and a March 20 game, the document signed by an FBI agent says. Pham and the others knew the player planned to withdraw from those games for purported health reasons, thus rendering those \u201cunder\u201d proposition bets successful, the criminal complaint says. The complaint refers to the player as \u201cPlayer 1,\u201d though after a review of court documents, CNN has determined the player is former Toronto Raptors big man\u00a0Jontay Porter, who two months ago was banned for life from the NBA. Proposition bets, also known as prop bets, can refer to wagers on individual statistics, and betting the \u201cunder\u201d means someone bet that the stat in question would be less than a figure proposed ahead of time by a sports betting company. Pham \u2013 who had been arrested Monday at an New York airport where he authorities say he was about to take a flight to Australia \u2013 appeared in court Tuesday. He initially was ordered detained pending trial, prosecutors in the Eastern District of New York said in a news release, noting that three co-conspirators charged in the scheme remain at large. The names of those three people were redacted in the complaint. In a bail hearing Wednesday, a judge said Pham could be released on a $750,000 bond with home detention and electronic monitoring, once surety for the bond is secured, US attorney\u2019s office spokesperson Danielle Hass said. CNN has sought comment from Pham\u2019s attorney, Michael Soshnick. CNN also has sought comment from a representative for Porter. \u201cWhether on the court or in the casino, every point matters. As alleged, the defendant and his co-conspirators, as well as an NBA player, participated in a brazen, illegal betting scheme that had a corrupting influence on two games and numerous bets,\u201d US Attorney Breon Peace said. \u201cThis prosecution serves as a warning that fraud and dishonesty in professional sports will not be tolerated and those who engage in this flagrant flouting of the law will be prosecuted.\u201d Complaint alleges player told gamblers he would come out of games early The player had significant gambling debts, the court document says, citing text messages, cell phone records and wire transfer evidence. To clear those debts, Pham and others encouraged him to withdraw early from certain games so certain bets on game activities like how many points he scored would be successful, authorities allege. Shortly before the January 26 game, the player told the defendants through a Telegram group chat he would remove himself early from the contest, claiming he was injured, according to the court document. He played just over four minutes in that contest, the court document reads. \u201cAfter playing just four minutes \u2026 and recording zero points, three rebounds and one assist, Player 1 removed himself from the game after he complained to team officials that he had reaggravated\u201d a previous eye injury, prosecutors said. The player communicated a similar message to the defendants before the March 20 game, telling them he would claim to be ill, according to the complaint. The documents say he played three minutes in that game. On April 4, in a group chat with the player, Pham and other defendants, the player wrote the group \u201cmight just get hit w a rico\u201d and asked whether the group had \u201cdelete(d) all the stuff\u201d from their personal cell phones, according to the complaint. The FBI agent believed \u201cthese messages refer to Player 1\u2019s concerns that he and certain of the co-conspirators would be criminally investigated for, among other things, violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act,\u201d known as RICO, \u201cand needed to delete any evidence on their personal cell phones,\u201d the agent wrote in the court document. Porter was banned by the NBA in mid-April, with the league saying an investigation found Porter had violated betting rules. NBA said it investigated unusual betting patterns around Porter The NBA announced in March it had opened an investigation into anomalies involving bets pertaining to Porter after unusual betting patterns around the player emerged. Porter had \u201cviolated league rules by disclosing confidential information to sports bettors, limiting his own participation in one or more games for betting purposes, and betting on NBA games,\u201d NBA officials said. When Porter\u2019s ban was announced, NBA commissioner Adam Silver said Porter was receiving the \u201cmost severe punishment.\u201d \u201cThere is nothing more important than protecting the integrity of NBA competition for our fans, our teams and everyone associated with our sport, which is why Jontay Porter\u2019s blatant violations of our gaming rules are being met with the most severe punishment,\u201d Silver said in a release.

{"id": "2024_06_05_politics_alito-former-neighbor-flags-cnntv", "text": "A former neighbor of Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito on\u00a0Wednesday\u00a0disputed\u00a0his account of a neighborhood spat\u00a0that led to the hoisting of an upside-down US flag on his property in Virginia, saying that his timeline of what happened is wrong. \u201cAt best, he\u2019s mistaken, but at worst, he\u2019s just outright lying,\u201d Emily Baden told CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett\u00a0on \u201cOutFront\u201d\u00a0in her first television interview since the flag incident\u00a0made national headlines. \u201cEven if it were a valid excuse that they were having a dispute with a neighbor and that made them put the flag up, that timeline just disproves it. It just doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201d Baden has emerged as a central figure in the evolving story of two provocative flags seen at Alito\u2019s properties, an upside-down US flag hoisted at his home in Virginia in early 2021 and an \u201cAppeal to Heaven\u201d flag at his New Jersey home last summer. Alito has said the flag in Virginia was a response to a \u201cvery nasty neighborhood dispute,\u201d that apparently involved Baden. Alito has said that his wife, Martha-Ann Alito, hoisted the flag in response to an exchange with Baden in which she at one point used the term \u201cc*nt.\u201d But Baden said that exchange didn\u2019t happen until mid-February. The story came to light when the\u00a0New York Times published\u00a0a photo in May of the inverted American flag flying weeks earlier, on January 17, 2021. Records obtained by CNN show that Baden\u2019s then-boyfriend called police on February 15, 2021, to complain about Martha-Ann Alito, accusing her of \u201cunprompted\u201d harassment. The caller said they believed the confrontations were based on yard signs they had put up that were critical of former President\u00a0Donald Trump. Baden, who no longer lives in the neighborhood, described the exchange with the Alitos in sharp detail\u00a0Wednesday. She said that Justice Alito \u201cdidn\u2019t do anything\u201d as she exchanged words with his wife. \u201cHe just kept walking,\u201d Baden said. \u201cAnd basically disappeared.\u201d Baden said she regrets using the profanity\u00a0if it \u201cdistracts from that real message.\u201d One of the signs that Baden put on the lawn read, \u201cYou are complicit.\u201d Alito has claimed that some of the neighborhood signs were directed at his wife. Baden told CNN\u00a0on\u00a0Wednesday\u00a0that the sign was not directed at either of the Alitos. The New York Times subsequently published a photograph of the \u201cAppeal to Heaven\u201d flag at the\u00a0couple\u2019s\u00a0New Jersey property. The flag, which has a history dating to the Revolutionary War, has also become a symbol for Trump supporters. Both the \u201cAppeal to Heaven\u201d flag and inverted US flags were seen at the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol. The incidents have drawn mounting criticism from Democratic and some Republican lawmakers. Several Democrats have called on Alito to recuse from cases involving the attack on the Capitol. In an unusual response late last month, Alito told lawmakers he had\u00a0nothing to do with the flags and that they were not intended to convey support for Trump or the Capitol attack. Explicitly declining to recuse, Alito said the decisions to hoist the flags were made by his wife. \u201cMy wife is fond of flying flags,\u201d Alito wrote. \u201cI am not.\u201d The Supreme Court is weighing major cases tied to the 2020 election and the attack on the US Capitol. In one, the justices are weighing Trump\u2019s claim of absolute immunity from special counsel Jack Smith\u2019s election subversion charges. In another, a January 6 rioter is challenging an obstruction charge filed against him by prosecutors, arguing that Congress intended that law to apply to people destroying evidence, not storming a government building.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/05/politics/alito-former-neighbor-flags-cnntv/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/06/2024", "section": "us"}}

Whatever ailment had ushered the 74-year-old toward this inescapable brink, her death \u2013 as those whose business it is to care for the recently departed often say \u2013 had been expected. They say in such cases that \u201ca \u2018death of a patient is anticipated,\u2019\u201d the sheriff\u2019s chief deputy in Lancaster County, Nebraska, later would explain: \u201cA physician had seen her in the last seven days, and the physician is willing to sign the death certificate,\u00a0and that there was nothing suspicious at that time of the death \u2013 all of those fit.\u201d Under such circumstances, a coroner\u2019s investigation would not be required and no law enforcement officer dispatched, Ben Houchin said. \u201cThat\u2019s the reason,\u201d continued Houchin, still working through the astonishing \u2013 some might say miraculous \u2013 events that had only just unfolded Monday, \u201cwhy (the sheriff\u2019s office) was not sent initially to the nursing home.\u201d Indeed, earlier that same day \u2013 at 9:44 a.m. \u2013 staff at The Mulberry home in Waverly had pronounced Constance dead, the chief deputy said. Given the outcome had been foreseen, at least two people likely then came to take her body away to be prepared for what would come next, he said \u2013 no further confirmation needed. At the funeral home in Lincoln, more experts in death soon moved to place Constance on a table, Houchin said, \u201cto start their process.\u201d It was only then that a worker noticed something truly odd. Nearly two hours since the nursing home staff\u2019s final declaration and after what would be a 25-minute drive to the funeral home, Constance \u2013 whose name comes from the Latin, \u201cconstant\u201d or \u201csteadfast\u201d \u2013 exhibited something truly extraordinary: She was breathing. \u201cThey instantly called 911,\u201d the veteran lawman said. The call from Butherus, Maser and Love, as CNN affiliate KOLN reported, came in around 11:45 a.m., Houchin said. Lincoln police, fire and rescue personnel rushed to the funeral home, where they found Constance engaged in that entirely ordinary \u2013 and also then somehow impossible act \u2013 of breathing. \u201cShe was taken to a local hospital,\u201d Houchin said that afternoon, \u201cand is still alive.\u201d \u2018This is a very unusual case\u2019 Constance persevered a few more hours. Then around 4 p.m., her breathing stopped. She again was pronounced dead, Houchin said later, adding an autopsy was conducted Tuesday morning. Constance\u2019s family was told all about what happened, Houchin said, and the sheriff\u2019s office started an investigation, including visiting the nursing home. \u201cAt this point, we have not been able to find any criminal intent by the nursing home, but the investigation is ongoing,\u201d Houchin said Monday. \u201cI\u2019m sure the nursing home and everybody else is going to be taking a look into what has happened, and I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll look and see if new protocols need to be made and if they were all followed.\u201d \u201cThe funeral home did absolutely nothing wrong,\u201d Houchin added Tuesday, citing the investigation. \u201cThey are the ones who found that she was still alive.\u201d Butherus, Maser and Love Funeral Home is \u201cproud that our directors and staff handled the recent incident in the news appropriately and with upmost care,\u201d it said in a statement. \u201cOur prayers go out to the family. \u201cWe thank Lincoln Fire & Rescue and the Lincoln Police Department for their quick response,\u201d it added. \u201cThank you to all who have placed their loved ones in our care. We will continue to serve our community with our core values: faith, trust, and compassion. The funeral home and the nursing home have been \u201ctotally cooperative\u201d with the sheriff\u2019s office investigation, Houchin said. CNN has sought comment from both. Whether charges are warranted likely won\u2019t be decided until after the final autopsy results are in, up to 12 weeks from now, he said: \u201cThat\u2019s going to be the next big step.\u201d For his part, the chief deputy has \u201cbeen doing this 31 years, and nothing like this has ever gotten to this point before,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cThis,\u201d he observed, perhaps unnecessarily, \u201cis a very unusual case.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/04/us/nebraska-woman-alive-at-funeral-home/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/06/2024", "section": "us"}}

Witnesses told police the victim was shot at several times by his father after a reported argument on May 28, according to court records obtained by CNN.

{"id": "2024_06_05_us_immigration-biden-border-executive-action-questions-cec", "text": "With an election looming, President Biden\u2019s new executive action on the border aims to send a loud and clear message about his approach to immigration. But the realities of what\u2019s next are murky. Here are three big questions to consider. Is Biden closing the border? No, that\u2019s not what\u2019s happening here, though that\u2019s frequently how this approach gets shorthanded \u2013\u2014 even by Biden himself. The president\u2019s proclamation, announced Tuesday, still allows for the normal flow of commerce and legal immigration across the border. But it bars migrants who cross the border illegally from seeking asylum once a daily threshold is met. When the average number of migrants illegally crossing the border reaches 2,500 a day, migrants who try to cross between ports of entry will be blocked from seeking asylum and turned back to Mexico or returned to their countries of origin. The restrictions would be lifted after the seven-day average drops below 1,500 a day. Border authorities encountered around 3,500 migrants crossing the border unlawfully on Monday, according to a Homeland Security official, above the threshold needed for the executive action to take effect. The number of migrants illegally crossing the border has been decreasing since reaching a historic high in December, but Biden\u2019s proclamation notes that \u201ca substantial and elevated level of migration\u2026continues to pose significant operational challenges.\u201d There are some exemptions to the new restrictions, including unaccompanied minors. And migrants will still be able to use a Customs and Border Protection app to request an appointment to present their asylum claim at a port of entry. It\u2019s too soon to say whether Biden\u2019s announcement will help or hurt him politically. Critics argue the measure doesn\u2019t go far enough. And immigrant\u00a0rights advocates warn that closing the\u00a0border\u00a0to\u00a0asylum\u00a0seekers will endanger vulnerable people and ultimately make the\u00a0border\u00a0less safe. And beyond the implications at the ballot box, there\u2019s a lot we still don\u2019t know about what this will look like on the ground, particularly since \u2013\u2014 unlike a law passed by Congress \u2014 executive actions from the president don\u2019t include funding for additional resources. And some experts are already questioning whether the administration ultimately will have the resources to enforce the new policy. Doesn\u2019t Mexico need to agree to this? Mexico\u2019s cooperation is a key part of any initiative along the countries\u2019 shared border. We\u2019ve seen US presidents announce immigration initiatives in the past, only to see them fizzle without Mexican support. On the flip side, we\u2019ve also seen significant changes in the numbers at the border in recent months, and multiple times in the past, as Mexico has stepped up enforcement efforts. In this case, exactly how strong Mexico\u2019s support will be is up in the air. While the Mexican government said President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador had spoken with Biden Tuesday about migration and other matters, officials haven\u2019t released details about what Mexico will \u2014 or won\u2019t \u2014 do in connection with Biden\u2019s new executive action. \u201cThey agreed to continue close collaboration between both countries to manage migratory flows in the region and increase efforts to address the structural causes of migration in Latin America and the Caribbean,\u201d the Mexican government\u2019s statement said. Further complicating matters, Mexico just elected a new leader. President-elect Claudia Sheinbaum\u2019s six-year term is scheduled to begin October 1, just over a month before the US presidential vote. While she\u2019s signaled she\u2019ll take a similar approach to her predecessor and mentor, Lopez Obrador, campaign promises often shift amid the realities of governing. Will it get blocked in court? The new measures were scheduled to go into effect at 12:01 a.m. Wednesday. But before they\u2019d been officially announced the American Civil Liberties Union had already vowed to challenge them in court, arguing that denying migrants the chance to seek asylum is illegal. We\u2019ve seen similar government efforts to prevent migrants from seeking asylum blocked in court in the past, including a measure the Trump administration pursued, which also faced an ACLU challenge. That means no matter how strongly this executive action is worded, its days in effect could be numbered.

{"id": "2023_07_16_us_rex-heuermann-gilgo-beach-murders-capture", "text": "Rex Heuermann left his office near the Empire State Building and strolled down a still-bustling Fifth Avenue as the sun set on a hot Thursday evening in Manhattan. The architect, whose customers included Catholic Charities, American Airlines and other tenants at John F. Kennedy International Airport, is seen in video obtained by CNN affiliate WABC walking calmly at the end of a work day.  A bag was slung over his shoulder, his left hand in his pocket, when he\u2019s approached last July 13 by several men in dark suits and ties.  Tall and heavyset, Heuermann towered over the law enforcement officers who now surrounded him. As passersby strolled leisurely along the avenue, he was taken into custody without incident in connection with a 13-year homicide investigation involving young female victims on the South Shore of Long Island. \u201cYes, the day has finally come when someone so \u2026 depraved of heart who would kill individuals, innocent individuals in the prime of their lives, their young lives, is finally brought to justice,\u201d New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said. \u201cWe are hoping that this will bring justice to this individual but also peace to the families.\u201d That day came \u2013 finally \u2013 years after a bestselling nonfiction book, a Netflix drama, and a podcast about a long-running murder mystery that made national headlines and become known as the Gilgo Beach killings.  Heuermann was initially charged with three counts of first-degree murder for the killings of Melissa Barthelemy in 2009, and Megan Waterman and Amber Costello the following year, according to the Suffolk County District Attorney. Heuermann, 60, is expected to be indicted on two additional murder charges when he appears in court Thursday, according to multiple law enforcement sources. The alleged killer had been living a double life in a Long Island village a short drive from where their remains were found, prosecutors said. Heuermann, who told his attorney he\u2019s not the killer, was also the prime suspect in the 2007 disappearance and death of a fourth woman, Maureen Brainard-Barnes, according to a bail application from Suffolk County prosecutors. In January, he was charged with the murder of Brainard-Barnes, who was 25 years when she was last seen. He pleaded not guilty in that case.  The victims, who worked as escorts, became known as the \u201cGilgo Four.\u201d The day after his arrest, July 14, Heuermann was ordered held without bail after pleading not guilty during a first court appearance. Heuermann was in tears following his arrest. \u201cI did not do this,\u201d his court appointed attorney, Michael Brown, said his client told him.  A crucial break in the case came in January when investigators took a swab from leftover pizza crust Heuermann discarded in the trash outside his Manhattan office, according to the bail application. DNA evidence linked him to a hair found on the burlap sack where Waterman\u2019s remains were found. Living a double life The son of an aerospace engineer, Heuermann lived with his spouse and children in the homey village of Massapequa Park, across the bay from where the remains were found, on the southeastern edge of Nassau County. In a video interview posted online by Bonjour Realty in 2022, as police in Suffolk County formed a multiagency task force to investigate the long-dormant cases, Heuermann said he was born and raised on Long Island. He had been working as an architectural consultant in Manhattan since 1987. \u201cI do troubleshooting, architectural troubleshooting, and negotiations with the building department,\u201d Heuermann said.  \u201cWhen a job that should have been routine suddenly becomes not routine, I get the phone call,\u201d he added. His father had built satellites for a living, Heuermann told the interviewer. His dad also built furniture in a workshop in the house Heuermann grew up in and still lived with his family. Asked what his job taught him about himself, Heuermann said: \u201cI think it\u2019s taught me more about how to understand people. Dealing with the technical aspects is something a person can learn \u2026 But it\u2019s the people, how they\u2019re all so different and how you deal with the people, I think, is one of the more interesting aspects that has come out of this.\u201d  RH Consultants & Associates was founded by Heuermann and incorporated in 1994, according to the company website. At the end of his online video, Heuermann put on a pair of sunglasses and posed for a selfie with his interviewer. \u201cCan you smile?\u201d Heuermann was asked. \u201cThat is,\u201d he replied, indicating he was smiling. Piecing together a complex puzzle It took investigators nearly 15 years to track down Heuermann. They first connected him to the killings in 2022 while conducting a review of evidence under a newly formed task force, which included the Suffolk County Police Department, the Suffolk County Sheriff\u2019s Office, the New York State Police and the FBI. In March 2022, investigators found a first-generation Chevrolet Avalanche \u2013 the same type of truck a witness believed to have been driven by Costello\u2019s killer \u2013 registered to Heuermann at the time of the murders, according to the bail application. Armed with more than 300 subpoenas and search warrants, investigators began to close in on their suspect.  Evidence revealed the killer had used burner phones to contact victims. Investigators found calls to the victims originated from locations connected to Heuermann.  Investigators said they narrowed cell tower records from thousands of possible individuals down to hundreds and then to a handful of people. They focused on residents who matched a physical description provided by a witness who had seen the killer. Task force members also learned Heuermann lived close to one Long Island cell site and worked near New York City cell sites where other calls originated. A series of \u201ctaunting\u201d calls in which a male caller admitted killing and sexually assaulting Barthelemy were made from her phone to her family members from the vicinity of Heuermann\u2019s midtown Manhattan office during the summer of 2009, according to the bail application. Heuermann also used burner phones to contact sex workers or massage parlors, the bail application said. And he created false names for an email account used to search for \u201csex workers, sadistic, torture-related pornography and child pornography,\u201d the bail application said.  One fictitious email account was used to send selfies \u201cto solicit and arrange for sexual activity.\u201d Another was used to search for podcasts and documentaries about the investigation, as well as \u201cimages depicting the murdered victims and members of their immediate families,\u201d according to the bail application. Between March 2022 and June 2023, Heuermann used the same account to conduct more than 200 searches about serial killers and articles about the task force investigating the Gilgo Beach killings, the bail application said. A rag a bone and a hank of hair A key break in the case came when investigators recovered Heuermann\u2019s DNA from pizza crust in a crumpled box he discarded in a Manhattan trash can in January 2023. The initial examination of Waterman\u2019s skeletal remains turned up a male hair from the \u201cbottom of the burlap\u201d the killer used to wrap her body, according to prosecutors. Analysis of DNA found on the victim and the pizza showed the samples matched. Additionally, hair believed to be from Heuermann\u2019s wife was found on or near three of the murder victims, according to the bail application. The DNA was collected from bottles inside a garbage can outside the Heuermann home.  The hairs were found in 2010 and had degraded. DNA testing at the time yielded no results but recent mitochondrial DNA testing allowed investigators to make the connection, according to Tierney. Heuermann\u2019s wife and children were out of the state when the three women are believed to have been killed, Tierney said. Investigators said his wife\u2019s hair may have been transferred to the victims from his clothing. His wife, Asa Ellerup, likely did not know about his life as an alleged killer, said Suffolk County Police Commissioner Rodney Harrison. \u201cIf you ask me, I don\u2019t believe that they knew about this double life that Mr. Heuermann was living,\u201d Harrison said of the suspect\u2019s family. But authorities were not ruling anything out and were continuing to collect information on what the family might have known, Harrison said after the arrest. Ellerup had filed for divorce from her husband of 27 years, her attorney Robert Macedonio told CNN last year. Authorities, fearing the Heuermann might be tipped off they were closing in, moved to arrest him. \u201cWe were playing before a party of one,\u201d Tierney told reporters. \u201cWe knew the person responsible for these murders would be looking at us.\u201d Seeking closure The case started with the search for a missing woman in 2010, leading to the discovery of multiple sets of human remains at Gilgo Beach. By the time the remains of the missing woman, Shannan Gilbert, were found one year later, at least 10 sets of human remains had been recovered across two Long Island counties.  Tierney had said last year the work of the task force was not over. \u201cThere are a lot of other victims, you know, in that area,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cThere are a lot of victim\u2019s families that want closure. So that\u2019s what you work towards.\u201d Authorities believe the death of Gilbert, whose disappearance sparked discovery of the other victims, may have been accidental and not related to the other killings. The remains of the Gilgo Four were found in bushes along a quarter-mile stretch of Ocean Parkway over a two-day period in 2010. The skeletal remains of Barthelemy were discovered near Gilgo Beach on December 11. Barthelemy, who was a sex worker, was last seen July 12, 2009, at her apartment when she told a friend she was going to see a man, according to a Suffolk County website about the killings. The remains of three other women were found on December 13, 2010: Brainard-Barnes, who advertised escort services on Craigslist and was last seen in early June 2007 in New York City; Amber Lynn Costello, who also advertised escort services and was last seen leaving her North Babylon home in early September 2010; and Waterman, who also advertised as an escort and was last seen in early June 2010 at a Holiday Inn Express in Hauppauge. Heuermann was surprised when he was surrounded by officers and taken into custody near his office on the evening of July 13, according to Tierney. When Heuermann was being processed at the jail, he had just one question about his arrest. According to a source, he said, \u201cIs it in the news?\u201d Speaking of the arrest, Harrison said last year: \u201cRex Heuermann is a demon that walks among us. A predator that ruined families. If not for the members of this task force, he would still be on the streets today.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/07/16/us/rex-heuermann-gilgo-beach-murders-capture/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/06/2024", "section": "us"}}

North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance are among those who were sent the vetting materials, another source familiar with the process said. People familiar with the deliberations caution that Trump\u2019s search for a running mate is still in flux. According to multiple sources familiar with internal conversations, other candidates under consideration include South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott and New York Rep. Elise Stefanik. Earlier Wednesday, Rubio said he hadn\u2019t talked to the Trump campaign about being vice president but added, \u201cI am sure once they make a decision, they will let everyone know.\u201d NBC News was first to report that the vetting materials had been sent out. Trump has floated a lengthy list of names in recent months and routinely asks allies, donors and members of his Mar-a-Lago resort for their opinion. He routinely praises many of these contenders publicly at his campaign rallies and in interviews. Many of the potential picks have spent recent weeks publicly demonstrating their loyalty to Trump, including appearing with him at court for his New York criminal hush money trial and defending him on television. Trump was ultimately found guilty of\u00a034 counts of falsifying business records. In an interview with Newsmax on Tuesday, Trump mentioned Scott, Burgum, Rubio, Vance and Ben Carson, his former\u00a0Housing and Urban Development secretary, when asked about his search for a potential running mate. \u201cWe have some unbelievable people,\u201d the former president said as he rattled off the names. \u201cBut I think I\u2019m going to hold it.\u201d Trump said in an interview with TMJ4 News last month there was a \u201cpretty good chance\u201d he would announce his running mate at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, which is slated to take place from July 15 to 18.

{"id": "2024_06_05_politics_byron-donalds-black-family-jim-crow", "text": "Florida Rep. Byron Donalds, a Republican who is seen as a potential running mate for Donald Trump, is defending himself amid Democratic criticism of comments he\u2019d made Tuesday suggesting that Black families were\u00a0\u201ctogether\u201d during the Jim Crow era of racial segregation. Donalds\u2019 comments,\u00a0which come as Trump\u2019s campaign seeks to make inroads with non-White voters,\u00a0were made at\u00a0an event in Philadelphia with\u00a0Texas Rep. Wesley Hunt, another Black Republican supporter of the former president. \u201cYou see, during Jim Crow, the Black family was together,\u201d Donalds said at the Tuesday event, the Philadelphia Inquirer reported. \u201cDuring Jim Crow, more Black people were not just conservative \u2014 because Black people have always been conservative-minded \u2014 but more Black people voted conservatively,\u201d he said. That ended, he suggested, due to a culture of dependence promoted by the federal government\u2019s welfare system in the 1950s, including the establishment of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare \u2014 the federal agency now known as the Department of Health and Human Services \u2014 and civil rights efforts that followed under President Lyndon B. Johnson in the 1960s. \u201cAnd then HEW, Lyndon Johnson \u2014 you go down that road, and now we are where we are,\u201d Donalds said. Those comments drew harsh rebukes Wednesday from President Joe Biden\u2019s campaign, which said on X, \u201cTrump VP contender Byron Donalds claims life was better for Black Americans during Jim Crow,\u201d as well as from other Democrats. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries took to the House floor at the conclusion of votes to call out Donalds. \u201cThat\u2019s an outlandish, outrageous and out-of-pocket observation,\u201d\u00a0the New York Democrat\u00a0said Wednesday. \u201cWe were not better off when a young boy named Emmett Till could be brutally murdered without consequence because of Jim Crow. We were not better off when Black women could be sexually assaulted without consequence because of Jim Crow.\u201d He added: \u201cHow dare you make such an ignorant observation? You better check yourself before you wreck yourself.\u201d Rep. Steven Horsford, the Nevada Democrat who chairs the Congressional Black Caucus, said in a statement that Donalds\u2019 comments reflect \u201ca pattern of embracing racist ideologies that we see time and again within the MAGA Republican Party.\u201d \u201cRep. Donalds is playing his role as the mouthpiece who will say the quiet parts out loud that many will not say themselves,\u201d Horsford said. Donalds responded in a video posted on X Wednesday, saying that Biden\u2019s campaign and Jeffries should \u201ccheck your sources and stop lying to the American people.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re\u00a0trying to say that I said Black people were doing better under Jim Crow. I never said that. They are lying,\u201d Donalds said. \u201cWhat I said was is that you had more Black families under Jim Crow, and it was the Democrat polices under H.E.W., under the welfare state, that did help to destroy the Black family. That\u2019s what I said,\u201d he said. \u201cI also said that you\u2019re seeing a reinvigoration of Black families\u00a0today\u00a0in America, and that is a good thing.\u201d The controversy over Donalds\u2019 remarks comes as\u00a0polls show Trump making gains with Black and Hispanic voters compared to his performance in the 2020 election. Though Philadelphia, where Donalds\u2019 comments occurred, is overwhelmingly Democratic, Pennsylvania is poised to once again serve as one of the most important swing states in November\u2019s election.

{"id": "2024_06_05_business_lululemon-is-at-a-crossroads", "text": "Lululemon, maker of the pricey yogawear sported by seemingly everyone from Pilates moms to college students to preteens in the US, is at a crossroads. For over a decade, the company has fought off competitors like Athleta and Nike to dominate the luxury athleisure market, managing to grow despite the lightning rod of controversies that followed its founder. Its soft, colorful, $98 leggings and viral beltbags have attracted an even younger demographic, a huge plus for any retailer. But, while the skin-tight look shot Lululemon to fame, it now must navigate a new, baggy pant-loving Gen Z demographic and the radical reshuffling of its own executive team. Lulu stock is down almost 40% year to date but rose more than 10% after hours on Wednesday, after slightly topping analyst revenue expectations in its first quarter 2024 earnings. Macroeconomic headwinds are hitting many peer retailers, of course. But Lulu is also coping with the addition of trendy, celebrity and influencer-backed competitors like Alo, which is known for its monochromatic, chic sets, and Vuori, which carved out a space for itself in men\u2019s athleticwear. And the company blamed its slower North American sales on its own actions: It just didn\u2019t have enough sizes and colors in stock for its youngest customers. Lulu recently announced that its chief product officer \u2013 considered by Wall Street a key engine of its success \u2013 was leaving just ahead of its first quarter earnings release Wednesday. As part of that release, Lululemon said it was raising its stock repurchase program by $1 billion, which could help calm down investors who are worried abut slowed growth. The company also maintained a brighter outlook for the year, saying it expects its net revenue to be between $10.7 billion and $10.8 billion. A departure shakes the firm Sun Choe, who had been Lululemon\u2019s creative mastermind, recently resigned to join Vans as its global brand president. The departure of the company\u2019s chief product officer adds to a \u201cwall of worry\u201d Raymond James analysts said. Choe joined Lululemon more than seven years ago and became chief product officer in 2018, according to her LinkedIn. Raymond James analysts credit Lululemon\u2019s success with strong products and marketing to Choe\u2019s role at the company. Shares fell as much as 7% on May 22 upon news of her departure. She left big shoes to fill, Wedbush analyst Tom Nikic told CNN. Under Choe, there was \u201cconstant innovation and newness, whether it\u2019s new fabrics or getting into new product categories.\u201d There\u2019s a reason Wall Street responded so negatively to Choe\u2019s departure. \u201cI think that there\u2019s a lot of people out there who believe that she was the person behind the scenes and was the most instrumental to Lululemon\u2019s success,\u201d Nikic said. Competition on both sides The fashion the company was known for has already been on the way out, Jefferies analysts warned. They \u201cbelieve the company\u2019s product assortment is falling flat.\u201d Lululemon is getting walled in by two very different types of competitors. On one end is those rapidly expanding luxury yogawear brands Alo and Vuori, who have been opening stores  near existing Lululemon locations. And then there\u2019s the culture of dupes, which claim leggings just as soft as Lulu\u2019s can be purchased for a fraction of the price. Lulu has been\u00a0\u201chyper aware\u201d of dupe culture, Nikki Neuburger, then its Chief Brand Officer, previously said in an interview with CNN Business. So much so that the brand hosted a dupe swap at the Century City Mall in Los Angeles. Bring in a knock-off pair, Lulu said, and they\u2019ll swap it out for the black Align High Rise Pant 25\u2019. That wasn\u2019t enough to quell knock-off popularity. As Americans cut back spending due to inflation and rising prices, many view a $90 pair of leggings as an unnecessary expense. And for those who can still shell out the money, Lululemon faces steep competition. Alo shot to popularity after celebrities from Hailey Bieber to Martha Stewart were photographed in the trendy brand. Vuori has a $400 million investment by Softbank and said it had bullish plans to open more than 100 stores in the US in the next five years. Time to turn it around Lululemon\u2019s demographic has shifted \u2013 originally marketed toward suburban women in their 30s and 40s, its stores are increasingly filled with younger, close to preteen-aged shoppers. In its Q4 earnings call in March, Lululemon said it had seen strong sales of its smaller sizes and colorful offerings. However, Lululemon wasn\u2019t stocked enough in these smaller sizes, which could have led these younger shoppers to competitors, Nikic said. But these are quick fixable problems, Nikic said. CEO Calvin McDonald made clear the company was still focused on pursuing\u00a0its new core customer in its last earnings call. (Lululemon has not responded to request for comment for this story in advance of their Wednesday earnings.) Lululemon also has potential for growth in its men\u2019s sector and international business. Unlike athletic brands like Nike that have a huge international footprint, Lululemon\u2019s international business represented only 21% of its business at the end of 2023. The company said in the fourth quarter that its mainland China revenue increased 78%, compared to North America\u2019s revenue increase of 9%. \u201cI certainly would not say that hope is lost with this company. This is a company that has a long track record of success,\u201d Nikic said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/05/business/lululemon-is-at-a-crossroads/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/06/2024", "section": "us"}}

Over the course of his career, he hit 660 home runs and had 3,283 hits in 23 MLB seasons, mostly with the New York Giants. He\u2019s also remembered for making \u201cThe Catch,\u201d an over-the-shoulder grab in Game 1 of the 1954 World Series \u2013 one of the best defensive plays of all time. \u201cThe Say Hey Kid\u201d had something to say about his experience as a teenager with the Negro American League\u2019s Birmingham Black Barons. His 10 hits with the Barons now count, bumping his career hit total to 3,293 \u2013 good for 12th on the all-time hits list. \u201cI was still in high school,\u201d when he joined the team in 1948, Mays told CNN. \u201cOur school did not have a baseball team. I played football and basketball, but I loved baseball.\u00a0So my dad let me to play \u2026 but ONLY if I stayed in school. He wanted me to graduate. I played with the team on weekends until school was out for the summer.\u201d \u201cI thought that was IT; that was the top of the world. Man, I was so proud to play with those guys,\u201d Mays said in the statement. The New York Giants purchased Mays\u2019 contract in 1950 \u2013 three years after Jackie Robinson broke baseball\u2019s color barrier \u2013 and the next season his stellar MLB career began. As a result of the MLB incorporating the statistics of former\u00a0Negro Leagues players into its historical records on its website, legendary leaders in some categories like Babe Ruth and Ty Cobb have now been replaced in the record books by players who were not allowed to play on the same fields as them during segregation. Josh Gibson, one of the greatest sluggers in the history of the Negro Leagues, is now listed as MLB\u2019s all-time career leader in batting average at .372, moving ahead of Cobb at .367. The MLB website shows Gibson also overtaking Ruth in career slugging percentage. The MLB\u2019s action added over 2,300 Negro League players from 1920-1948 to its database. \u201cI\u2019m glad that all the guys who played are getting credit for their hits, because those pitchers were good,\u201d Mays said, mentioning Satchel Paige, considered one of baseball\u2019s greatest pitchers and who is now ranked third place all-time for earned run average in a single season with his performance in 1944 for the Kansas City Monarchs of the Negro American League. Mays called his statistical accomplishment at age 93 \u201camazing.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m very grateful to all the people who looked out for me back then, and to MLB for going back and making sure we got credit for those years,\u201d he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/05/us/negro-league-baseball-willie-mays/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/06/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_04_us_ohtani-interpreter-guilty", "text": "Japanese baseball star Shohei Ohtani said he has \u201cclosure\u201d and is ready to \u201cmove on\u201d after his longtime interpreter Ippei Mizuhara pleaded guilty in court Tuesday to fraud and tax charges for stealing almost $17 million from the Los Angeles Dodgers slugger to pay off gambling debts. \u201cNow that the investigation has been completed, this full admission of guilt has brought important closure to me and my family. I want to sincerely thank the authorities for finishing their thorough and effective investigation so quickly and uncovering\u00a0all of\u00a0the evidence,\u201d Ohtani said in a statement. \u201cThis has been a uniquely challenging time, so I am especially grateful for my support team - my family, agent, agency, lawyers, and advisors along with the entire Dodger organization, who showed endless support throughout this process. It\u2019s time to close this chapter, move on and continue to focus on playing and winning ballgames.\u201d Mizuhara, 39,\u00a0reached a plea agreement last month in which he agreed to plead guilty to one count of bank fraud and one count of filing a false income tax return, according to the Justice Department. In court on Tuesday, he formally pleaded guilty and indicated that he understood all the charges and the consequences. When asked by Judge John W. Holcomb to describe in his own words what he did, Mizuhara said the \u201conly way\u201d he could think of to get out of his gambling debts was to use money from Ohtani\u2019s account to pay what he owed. He faces up to 30 years in prison for bank fraud and up to three years for filing a false tax return. His sentencing is scheduled for October 25. Ohtani\u2019s statement and Mizuhara\u2019s guilty plea represent the end of a saga that first became public in March on the eve of the MLB season. The scandal upended what had been perceived as a close friendship between the Japanese star and his interpreter and brought renewed scrutiny to the normalization and legalization of sports gambling in recent years. The court hearing also came the same day that MLB banned San Diego Padres player Tucupita Marcano for life after he bet on games and suspended four other players for a year for betting on games while in the minor leagues. Speaking after the hearing, US Attorney Martin Estrada said the evidence showed Ohtani was victimized by Mizuhara. He connected the case to other frauds committed against older adults and immigrant groups. \u201cMr. Ohtani is an immigrant, came to this country, is not familiar with the ways of this country, and therefore was easily prey to someone who is more familiar with our financial systems and was able to take advantage of Mr. Ohtani,\u201d Estrada said. Prosecutors have not decided what they will seek at sentencing but will follow the sentencing guidelines, which may call for a sentence lower than the maximum, Estrada said. \u201cThat being said, based on the extent of the conduct here, the sentence will likely be one that calls for incarceration,\u201d he added. MLB released a statement clearing Ohtani of any wrongdoing. \u201cBased on the thoroughness of the federal investigation that was made public, the information MLB collected, and the criminal proceeding being resolved without being contested, MLB considers Shohei Ohtani a victim of fraud and this matter has been closed,\u201d the league said. Interpreter stole to cover gambling debts Mizuhara began placing sports bets with an illegal bookmaker in September 2021 and then pilfered from Ohtani to cover the debts, authorities said. \u201cFrom no later than November 2021 to March 2024, Mizuhara used Ohtani\u2019s password to successfully sign into the bank account and then changed the account\u2019s security protocols without Ohtani\u2019s knowledge or permission,\u201d the Justice Department said. \u201cIn total, Mizuhara called the bank and impersonated Ohtani on approximately 24 occasions.\u201d According to a court document, Mizuhara \u201cfraudulently transferred and willfully caused to be transferred approximately $16.5 million.\u201d Prosecutors alleged Mizuhara used the money to pay off illegal gambling debts and expenses, including $60,000 on personal dental work and $325,000 on baseball cards. From December 2021 to January 2024, Mizuhara made a remarkable 19,000 wagers, with net losses of $40.7 million, the criminal complaint states. Ohtani, who has denied any wrongdoing, is considered a victim in the case, prosecutors said. \u201cThe extent of this defendant\u2019s deception and theft is massive,\u201d Estrada said last month. \u201cHe took advantage of his position of trust to take advantage of Mr. Ohtani and fuel a dangerous gambling habit.\u201d The Justice Department said Mizuhara has admitted he owes more than $1.1 million in taxes for 2022 and the IRS Criminal Investigation and Homeland Security Investigations are looking into the case. Mizuhara, who is out of custody on $25,000 bond, could be deported as he is not a US citizen, the plea agreement and the US attorney\u2019s office said. Mizuhara is\u00a0a legal permanent resident\u00a0who has a green card, the US Attorney\u2019s Office for the Central District of California told CNN. Mizuhara and\u00a0Ohtani, who does not speak English,\u00a0first worked together from 2013 to 2017 at Japan\u2019s Nippon Professional Baseball League\u00a0team Nippon-Ham Fighters, where Mizuhara worked as an interpreter for non-Japanese speaking players, according to MLB.com. Mizuhara then became\u00a0Ohtani\u2019s interpreter in his rookie season with the Los Angeles Angels in 2018. Ohtani starred for six seasons with the Angels as both a slugger and a pitcher, twice winning the American League\u2019s Most Valuable Player Award. This past offseason, he signed a\u00a0historic $700 million, 10-year contract\u00a0with the Dodgers. The allegations against Mizuhara came to light\u00a0in March when, after reporting from ESPN\u00a0and the\u00a0Los Angeles Times, Ohtani\u2019s lawyers accused Mizuhara of \u201cmassive theft\u201d of millions of dollars and placing bets with a bookie under federal investigation. In April, Ohtani said he was \u201cvery grateful for the Department of Justice\u2019s investigation,\u201d according to a statement given to CNN by his representatives. \u201cFor me personally, this marks a break from this, and I\u2019d like to focus on baseball.\u201d Despite the scandal, Ohtani has excelled in his first year with the Dodgers and remains one of the best sluggers in baseball.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/04/us/ohtani-interpreter-guilty/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/06/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2023_07_21_us_gilgo-beach-four-killings-victims", "text": "Rex Heuermann has now been charged with killing four women whose bodies were discovered bound with belts or tape and wrapped in burlap along a stretch of Long Island\u2019s Gilgo Beach in 2010. A married father accused by authorities of leading a double life, Heuermann initially had faced three counts of first-degree murder for the killings of Melissa Barthelemy in 2009, and Megan Waterman and Amber Costello the following year, according to the Suffolk County district attorney.  The 60-year-old New York architect was later charged in the disappearance and killing of a fourth woman, Maureen Brainard-Barnes, whose remains were found near the same spot, prosecutors said earlier this year. He had been identified as a prime suspect in the killing since his arrest in July. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges and is being held without bail.  Heuermann pleaded not guilty in January to the superseding indictment charging him with murder in the second degree in the death of Brainard-Barnes.  Heuermann \u201chas maintained his innocence from day one,\u201d his defense attorney said after he was charged in the fourth killing. \u201cHe said, \u2018I\u2019m not guilty of these charges,\u2019\u201d defense attorney Michael Brown said. \u201cHe\u2019s looking forward to fight these charges and we\u2019re doing that. We\u2019re going to continue to prepare.\u201d Heuermann was first identified as a potential suspect in early 2022, shortly after a multi-agency task force was formed to examine cold cases involving nearly a dozen sets of human remains found along Long Island\u2019s South Shore between 2010 and 2011, including the \u201cGilgo Four.\u201d \u201cThe grand jury investigation of the so-called Gilgo Four is over. It has been concluded,\u201d Suffolk County District Attorney Ray Tierney said in January, noting the same panel was looking into other murder cases.  Five months later, Heuermann, 60, is expected to be indicted on two additional murder charges when he appears in court Thursday, according to multiple law enforcement sources. Gloria Allred, a victims\u2019 rights attorney representing Barthelemy, Brainard-Barnes and Waterman family members, said it is \u201clong overdue to provide justice for vulnerable women who are missing and murdered.\u201d Allred said it\u2019s up to a jury \u201cto decide if this defendant will be found guilty of the murder of Maureen and the murder of other women for whom the defendant has been indicted.\u201d Here\u2019s what we know about the deaths of those four women: Maureen Brainard-Barnes    Brainard-Barnes was 25 years old and believed to be a sex worker when she was last seen on July 9, 2007. She had called a friend in Connecticut, where she lived, and said she had an \u201cout call,\u201d according to Suffolk County police. The young woman was reported missing by a friend to the Norwich Police Department in Connecticut on July 14.  Her remains were found on December 13, 2010, on the north side of Ocean Parkway, near Gilgo Beach.  She is believed to be the first Gilgo Four victim. Authorities identified Heuermann as a suspect in early 2022 using cell phone data, witness descriptions and other information, and obtained a sample of his DNA from leftover crust in a pizza box he threw out.  Investigators found the DNA of Heuermann\u2019s wife on a leather belt that was used to restrain Brainard-Barnes, according to an indictment.  She had been restrained by three leather belts, one of which was used to tie her feet and ankle legs together, the indictment states. Heuermann\u2019s wife and her two children were in Atlantic City at the time of the killing of Brainard-Barnes, according to a bail application. Tierney described victim Brainard-Barnes as an \u201cintellectual\u201d and \u201cartistic.\u201d \u201cShe was a devoted sister, a devoted mother, a devoted daughter, and she\u2019s sorely missed by those that loved her,\u201d Tierney said. Brainard-Barnes\u2019s family called the latest indictment \u201can important chapter in the long pursuit of justice.\u201d \u201cIt has been 16 years since the last time I saw my sister, 16 years since I heard her voice, because 16 years ago, she was silenced,\u201d Melissa Cann said in January. Cann described her sister as a loving mother, sister and friend. \u201cMaureen would never get the chance to show the world how talented she was,\u201d her sister said, choking up. \u201cMy family will never get the chance to know who Maureen would be today because her life was tragically taken.\u201d Nicolette Brainard-Barnes was only 7 years old when her mother was killed. She said the loss changed the trajectory of her life. \u201cWhile the loss of my mom has been extremely painful for me, the indictment by the grand jury has brought hope for justice for my mom and my family,\u201d said Nicolette Brainard-Barnes. Cann told CNN in 2011 that she desperately tried to solve the mystery of her sibling\u2019s disappearance, scouring her emails and phone records, and staying in touch with families of the other victims.  Cann said her sister worked a seasonal telemarketing job and turned to escort services in desperation when left unemployed and facing eviction.  Melissa Barthelemy   Barthelemy was 24 years old when she was last seen on July 12, 2009, in the basement apartment where she lived in the Bronx, according to the Suffolk County police website on the Gilgo killings.  On the night she was last seen, Barthelemy, a sex worker, told a friend she was meeting a man and would be back in the morning, according to the police website.  Barthelemy\u2019s mother reported her missing on July 18. Records for her cellphone showed activity in Manhattan as well as Freeport, Massapequa and Lindenhurst on Long Island.   In July and August 2009, according to a bail application for Heuermann, Barthelemy\u2019s phone was used by a man to make taunting calls to the victim\u2019s family.  Steve Cohen, who was an attorney for Barthelemy\u2019s mother at the time, told CNN the caller said he killed her daughter. \u201cDo you think you\u2019ll ever see her again?\u201d the unidentified male caller asked Barthelemy\u2019s sister on August 26, 2009, according to Cohen. \u201cYou won\u2019t. I killed her,\u201d he said and hung up. In another phone call, just days after Barthelemy disappeared, Cohen said the unidentified male caller referred to the victim as a \u201cwhore\u201d in a short conversation with her then-15-year-old sister. In one call, the man described in graphic detail to the victim\u2019s sister what he had done sexually to Barthelemy, according to Cohen.  Barthelemy\u2019s remains were the first set of female remains found in bushes along an isolated strip of waterfront property. At the time, authorities were searching for another missing woman, Shannan Gilbert, a 23-year-old from Jersey City, New Jersey, who hadn\u2019t been seen since May 2010. \u201cI still don\u2019t sleep through the night thinking about all of it,\u201d Lynn Barthelemy, the victim\u2019s mother, told CNN in 2011.  She said she jotted down everything she learned about the case in a notebook and spoke regularly with families of other victims.  Investigators believe Barthelemy was the second of the women to be killed.  Megan Waterman  Waterman was 22 years old when she was last seen on June 6, 2010. A resident of Maine, Waterman was last seen by her family boarding a Concord Trailways bus heading from Maine to New York, according to Suffolk County police.  She was a sex worker, police said. At 1:30 a.m. on June 6, she left the Holiday Inn Express on Long Island to meet a client, according to police.  Waterman was reported missing in Maine on June 8. Family members said it was unusual for her not to check on the daughter Waterman had left in their care.   Her body was found on December 13, 2010, near Gilgo Beach. Waterman\u2019s family at one time used funding from a nonprofit human rights organization to hire a team of private investigators to help search for her.  Dottie Laster, a member of that team, told CNN in 2011 Waterman sounded starstruck when she called her mother to boast that her clients included doctors, lawyers and law enforcement officers.  Amber Lynn Costello  Costello was 27 years old and living on Long Island when she was last seen. She struggled with a heroin addiction and worked as an escort to help support her habit, according to Suffolk County police. She was was last seen leaving her home on September 2, 2010, to meet a client. Her remains were found on December 13, 2010, near Gilgo Beach. She is believed to be the fourth victim.   Witnesses told investigators that the client she met the day she went missing had been at her home previously. They described the man as \u201ca large, white male, approximately 6\u20194\u201d to 6\u20196\u201d in height\u201d with \u201cbig oval style\u201d glasses. A witness also said the man resembled an \u201cogre.\u201d Heuermann\u2019s bail application noted the description from these witnesses in 2010 matched Heuermann. Costello\u2019s sister, Kim Overstreet, told CNN in 2011 that she took out an ad hoping to catch the killer. The ad implored other women who work as escorts to call Overstreet. She wanted them to tell her if they ever encountered a client who was threatening or just didn\u2019t feel right. \u201cWhat happened to Amber eats at me every day,\u201d Overstreet said at the time. \u201cFinding out who did this consumes me. I stay up all night doing research and trying to re-trace her last steps.\u201d Witnesses also said the man drove a first-generation Chevrolet Avalanche \u2013 a key clue that prosecutors said helped lead them to Heuermann.

{"id": "2024_01_15_us_gilgo-beach-murder-case-timeline", "text": "For more than a decade, a string of unsolved killings known as the Gilgo Beach murders terrorized residents and confounded authorities on Long Island\u2019s South Shore after a woman\u2019s 2010 disappearance led investigators to find 10\u00a0sets of human remains in addition to hers and launched\u00a0the hunt for a possible serial killer. Authorities announced a major breakthrough in the case last summer when they charged\u00a0New York architect Rex Heuermann with murder in the killings of three of the four women who became known as the \u201cGilgo Four.\u201d In January, Heuermann was charged with second-degree murder in the fourth killing, that of Maureen Brainard-Barnes, according to an indictment. Brainard-Barnes was 25 years old when she was last seen in July 2007. Her remains were found along the Long Island shoreline in 2010. Five months later, on Thursday, Heuermann, 60, is expected to be indicted on two additional murder charges when he appears in court Thursday, according to multiple law enforcement sources. Heuermann was taken into custody in July and indicted on one count of first-degree murder and one count of second-degree murder in each of the three killings of\u00a0Melissa Barthelemy in 2009, and Megan Waterman and Amber Costello in 2010, according to the Suffolk County District Attorney. Heuermann has pleaded not guilty to all charges and \u201chas maintained his innocence since day one,\u201d his attorney, Michael Brown, told reporters after the fourth charge was announced. Once Heuermann was identified as a suspect in early 2022, authorities said, they watched him and his family \u2013 getting DNA samples from items in their trash as they built a case. Here is a timeline of the Gilgo Beach killings, how the investigation unfolded and what ultimately led to Heuermann\u2019s arrest. 2010: Authorities find first remains in Gilgo Beach murders Police discovered the first set of female remains in bushes along an isolated strip of waterfront property on Gilgo Beach while searching for another missing woman: Shannan Gilbert, a 23-year-old from Jersey City, New Jersey who hadn\u2019t been seen since May 2010. The remains of Melissa Barthelemy, 24, were the first to be discovered in the case during the search on December 11, 2010, according to Suffolk County officials. Two days later, investigators discovered the remains of three additional victims \u2013 Maureen Brainard-Barnes, Amber Costello and Megan Waterman \u2013 strewn across a half-mile stretch on Gilgo Beach. The four women, who were wrapped in camouflaged burlap, worked as escorts who advertised on Craigslist and were last seen between July 2007 and September 2010, officials said. After Barthelemy\u2019s disappearance, authorities say her family received multiple taunting calls. In one of the calls, the suspect \u201cadmitted killing and sexually assaulting Ms. Barthelemy,\u201d according to a bail application filed by the Suffolk County district attorney after Heuermann\u2019s arrest. Those calls, authorities say, would later help unravel the case. 2011: More remains found, including a toddler and her mother Police said in January 2011 calls from Barthelemy\u2019s cell phone had been traced to midtown Manhattan, with the two last calls made from around Madison Square Garden and Times Square. The caller hung up too quickly for authorities to pinpoint the exact locations of the calls, police said. On March 29, 2011, the partial skeletal remains of another woman were found several miles east of where the bodies of the \u201cGilgo Four\u201d were discovered. The woman was first known as Jane Doe #5\u00a0before investigators identified her as Jessica Taylor, another escort whose partial remains were previously discovered in Manorville in 2003, police said. The following month, on April 4, 2011, three more sets of remains were found on a stretch of Ocean Parkway in Suffolk County near the beach. They included a female toddler, an unidentified Asian male and a woman initially referred to as Jane Doe #6, investigators said. One week later, two additional sets of human remains were found in Nassau County, about 40 miles east of New York City, one of which was identified as the mother of the toddler through DNA analysis. The mother\u2019s partial remains were first discovered in 1997, officials said. The other set of remains \u201cgenetically matched\u201d with remains found in 1996 on Fire Island, \u201csignificantly expanding the timeline and geographic reach\u201d of the investigation, officials said. In mid-April of the same year, Steve Cohen, an attorney for Barthelemy\u2019s mother, said a man using the victim\u2019s cell phone made taunting calls and claimed he killed Barthelemy,\u00a0CNN reported. \u201cDo you think you\u2019ll ever see her again?,\u201d the unidentified male caller asked Barthelemy\u2019s sister on August 26, 2009, according to Cohen. \u201cYou won\u2019t. I killed her,\u201d he added and hung up. The phone call ended after less than a minute, CNN reported at the time. Another phone call was placed in July 2009 just days after Barthelemy disappeared. It was the first of seven calls he made from Barthelemy\u2019s cell phone. Cohen said in the phone call, the unidentified male caller referred to Barthelemy as a \u201cwhore\u201d in a short conversation with her then-15-year-old sister, Cohen told CNN at the time. In the final call, the man described in graphic detail to the victim\u2019s sister what he had done sexually to Barthelemy, Cohen said. In December 2011, Gilbert\u2019s body\u00a0was found in the wooded marshes\u00a0of Suffolk County\u2019s Oak Beach. The beach is about 9 miles from where the 10 other sets of human remains were found. Authorities later said they believed Gilbert\u2019s death may have been accidental and not related to the Gilgo Beach slayings. 2020: Police release photos of a key clue and ID a victim In January 2020, Suffolk County police released photos of what it said could be a significant piece of evidence: a black leather belt embossed with the letters \u201cWH\u201d or \u201cHM.\u201d The department also launched a website to collect new tips in the investigation. \u201cWe believe the belt was handled by the suspect and did not belong to any of the victims,\u201d former Suffolk County Police Commissioner Geraldine Hart told reporters at the time. On May 28, 2020, New York\u2019s Suffolk County Police Department identified \u201cJane Doe #6\u201d as Valerie Mack, a 24-year-old Philadelphia mother who went missing two decades earlier. The FBI helped identify Mack\u2019s remains using advanced forensic DNA technology, officials said. Using samples from her remains, Suffolk County investigators were able to find Mack\u2019s biological relatives through genetic genealogy, which ultimately led to her adoptive family and son, Hart said to reporters at the time. 2022: Police form task force to find killer In February 2022, Suffolk County Police Commissioner Rodney Harrison formed a multiagency task force to investigate the Gilgo Beach killings. The task force included the Suffolk County Police Department, the Suffolk County Sheriff\u2019s Office, the New York State Police and the FBI. On March 14, 2022, Heuermann was first mentioned as a possible suspect in the Gilgo Beach murder case after a New York state investigator identified him in a database, according to Suffolk County District Attorney Ray Tierney. Investigators then started surveilling him and his family and took pieces of garbage to obtain DNA samples \u2013 even discarded pizza crust. As they closed in on Heuermann, investigators used cell tower records from thousands of possible individuals down to hundreds and then to a handful of people. Next, authorities focused on residents who also matched a physical description provided by a witness who had seen the suspected killer. Authorities zeroed in on anyone with a connection to a green pickup truck a witness had seen the suspect driving, according to two law enforcement sources with knowledge of the case. Later, authorities learned Heuermann drove a green pickup truck registered to his brother, CNN reported. Heuermann matched a witness\u2019s physical description, lived close to the Long Island cell site and worked near the New York City cell sites where other calls were captured. Personal cell phone and credit card billing records revealed numerous instances where Heuermann was in the general locations as burner phones, which authorities say he had with him at the killings. He used the phones to call the three victims and also used \u201cBrainard-Barnes and Barthelemy\u2019s cellphones when they were used to check voicemail and make taunting phone calls after the women disappeared,\u201d Suffolk County prosecutors allege. Authorities said a search of Heuermann\u2019s computer revealed he had scoured the internet at least 200 times for details about the status of the investigation, Tierney said. Heuermann was also compulsively searching for photos of the victims and their relatives, and he was trying to track down relatives, the district attorney said. In late 2022, detectives recovered a cup believed to have been discarded by Heuermann, but they could not get a good DNA sample from it, a law enforcement source close to the investigation told CNN. 2023: Rex Heuermann arrested in some of the killings In January 2023, investigators got a complete sample of Heuermann\u2019s DNA from leftover crust in a pizza box he threw in the trash, a law enforcement source close to the investigation told CNN. During the initial examination of one of the victims\u2019 skeletal remains and materials discovered in the grave, the Suffolk County Crime Laboratory recovered a male hair from the \u201cbottom of the burlap\u201d the killer used to wrap her body, according to prosecutors. Analysis of the DNA found on the victim and the pizza thrown out by Heuermann showed the samples matched. Additionally, hair believed to be from Heuermann\u2019s wife was found on or near three of the murder victims, prosecutors allege in the bail application, citing DNA testing. The DNA came from 11 bottles inside a garbage can outside the Heuermann home, the court document says. On July 13, 2023, a suspect connected to some of the Gilgo Beach murders was taken into custody in New York City, marking the first arrest in the case, according to Harrison. He was transported back to Suffolk County Police headquarters in the hamlet of Yaphank on Long Island, the police commissioner said. A day later, authorities identified the suspect as Heuermann, a registered architect who has owned the New York City-based architecture and consulting firm, RH Consultants & Associates, since 1994, according to his company\u2019s website. The case against Heuermann came together over two years with the restart of the investigation, in which investigators used \u201cthe power of the grand jury,\u201d including more than 300 subpoenas and search warrants, to collect evidence and tie Heuermann conclusively to the murders, Tierney said during a news conference.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/01/15/us/gilgo-beach-murder-case-timeline/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/06/2024", "section": "us"}}

On November 18, 1999, 12 people died and 27 others were injured when a stack of bonfire logs collapsed, after which the 90-year tradition ended. Nearly 25 years after the longstanding bonfire tradition came to a tragic end, a committee recommended the university \u201creinstitute the annual Bonfire tradition with an engineer-designed, contractor-built bonfire on West Campus,\u201d the\u00a0letter\u00a0from the president said. The committee was formed last fall to recommend ways to commemorate the return of the university\u2019s football rivalry with the University of Texas this year. Texas A&M stopped playing UT annually in football after their 2011 game, in part because Texas A&M moved to the Southeastern Conference. Following a 12-year hiatus, the \u201cLone Star Showdown\u201d will return on Nov. 30 after UT officially joins the Southeastern Conference. Despite the committee recommendation, it was ultimately decided \u201cafter careful consideration\u201d that the tradition would not be resurrected, Welsh said. \u201cI have decided it is not in the best interest of Texas A&M and the Aggie Family to bring Bonfire back to campus,\u201d he said. \u201cI heard from many of you, as well as former students and friends of the university on this topic, and I thank you for your honest, thoughtful feedback. While the input varied, the majority of those who reached out were not in favor of reinstituting Bonfire.\u201d Most students who supported bringing back the campus bonfire highlighted the collaborative experience of organizing and building it themselves, but the committee stressed that it needed to be an engineer-designed and contractor-built project, the letter said. The event was billed as the \u201cworld\u2019s largest bonfire,\u201d drawing thousands to the College Station campus. The stack of 5,000 logs was 59 feet tall when it collapsed. A commission that investigated the accident found that \u201corganizational failure\u201d contributed to the accident. Decisions made by university officials and students over many years \u201ccreated an environment in which a complex and dangerous structure was allowed to be built without adequate physical or engineering control,\u201d the panel said. Although the president said he will not be bringing back the bonfire, he said the university was planning on holding other celebratory events leading up to the game to reignite the rivalry \u201cthat has shaped our university in so many ways.\u201d Proposals from the committee included a golf tournament and a run to carry the game ball from the state Capitol to College Station. President Welsh said the Bonfire Memorial commemorating the lives lost is a \u201csacred place\u201d and it \u201cwill remain the centerpiece of how we remember the beloved tradition and the dedication of those involved in the tragic 1999 collapse.\u201d A remembrance event will be held this year on the 25th anniversary of the collapse. \u201cWe will continue to hold them and their families close at that event and always,\u201d Welsh said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/04/us/texas-a-and-m-bonfire-tradition-announcement/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/06/2024", "section": "us"}}

Nvidia (NVDA) has been the biggest beneficiary of the AI mania dominating Wall Street this year; the stock is up 147% so far this year after soaring 239% in 2023. Apple shares, meanwhile, have gained about 1.7% year-to-date. Earlier this week, Jensen Huang, CEO of Nvidia, said that the company would roll out its most advanced AI chip platform, called Rubin, in 2026. The Rubin platform will succeed the Blackwell, which supplies chips for data centers and was announced only\u00a0in March. It was dubbed by Nvidia at the time as the \u201cworld\u2019s most powerful chip.\u201d Nvidia accounts for around 70% of AI semiconductor sales and some analysts think the stock has further to go. \u201cAs we look ahead, we think NVDA is on pace to become the most valuable company, given the plethora of ways it can monetize AI and our belief that it has the largest addressable market expansion opportunity across the Tech sector,\u201d wrote Angelo Zino, senior equity analyst at CFRA Research in a note on Wednesday evening. Shares of the company will soon become more affordable. Nvidia announced a 10-for-1 stock split last month, making buying shares in the red-hot semiconductor company more accessible for individual\u00a0investors. The post-split shares will begin trading at market open on June 10.
