Forty-one-year-old\u00a0Taylor Casey\u00a0was last seen on June 19 around Paradise Island, a small resort enclave just off the shore of the island of New Providence, where she was attending a yoga retreat, according to the Royal Bahamas Police Force. Casey\u2019s mother, Colette\u00a0Seymore, returned to the United States after spending three days in the Bahamas meeting with US Embassy leadership, organizers of the Sivananda Ashram Yoga Retreat where Casey was reported missing and members of the Royal Bahamas Police Force. \u201cI had to return home without her. This is every mother\u2019s worst nightmare,\u201d Seymore said in a\u00a0news release\u00a0shared by a family representative. \u201cI felt an urgent need to return because without U.S. government support, we may never find out what happened to my Taylor.\u201d The family is now calling for the FBI to take over the investigation into Casey\u2019s disappearance. \u201cLet me make this clear to the U.S. media, the public, and our government officials: We are not satisfied with how this investigation has been handled thus far. And what we learned and observed during our time meeting with the authorities and Ashram leaders is disturbing and infuriating,\u201d Emily Williams, a friend of Casey who accompanied Seymore on the trip,\u00a0said\u00a0in the release. Casey\u2019s family and friends have spoken to FBI officials on the phone since returning, but those calls have not led to the agency\u00a0intervening\u00a0in the case, according to the release. A State Department spokesperson told CNN the department is aware of reports of a US citizen missing in Bahamas, but declined to comment on Casey\u2019s case specifically, citing privacy concerns. When a US citizen is missing, the department works with local authorities and communicates with families openly, the spokesperson said. CNN has reached out to the FBI for comment. An \u2018unsettling\u2019 visit to the Sivananda Ashram Yoga Retreat The release also outlines what it calls Seymore\u2019s \u201cdeeply unsettling\u201d visit to the Sivananda Ashram Yoga Retreat on June 27, which left her team concerned for their own safety. The organizers of the retreat asked Bahamian police to investigate Casey\u2019s disappearance, according to a statement from the\u00a0Sivananda Ashram Yoga Retreat\u00a0obtained by CNN last week. The retreat learned of Casey\u2019s disappearance when she failed to attend morning classes\u00a0on June 20,\u00a0according to the statement. She was last seen late in the evening of June 19 and the \u201corganization has also advised the US Embassy as well as Taylor Casey\u2019s family,\u201d the statement said. When Seymore arrived at the retreat with her team, the scene appeared largely unprocessed by authorities, the release states.\u00a0Among Casey\u2019s belongings were a\u00a0Bible\u00a0and other books, a sketchpad with paintings, affirmation cards, clothes and toiletries. \u201cIt became apparent to us when we met with the Sivananda Ashram leaders that they were struggling to keep a linear and cohesive narrative regarding Taylor\u2019s disappearance,\u201d Williams said. Ram Soskin, the lead manager of the Sivananda Ashram Yoga Retreat, told Casey\u2019s family that on the Monday before her disappearance, an unidentified man with a walkie-talkie was seen walking the same platform where Casey\u2019s tent was, the release states. On the day Casey was last seen, one of the retreat participants was approached by a stranger while sitting alone at the beach, the participant told Seymore\u2019s team, according to the release. \u201cThe unidentified man was wearing a Celtics baseball cap and dressed in all black. He claimed he was from Chicago and was interested in taking a yoga class. He proceeded to follow her onto the property,\u201d the release states. Seymore said police advised her not to speak to guests at the retreat\u00a0and authorities noted\u00a0not all of them were aware of\u00a0Casey\u2019s disappearance. Seymore described the retreat as \u201ccultish,\u201d\u00a0and claimed\u00a0students\u00a0were\u00a0being \u201ccoerced to obey\u201d retreat leaders, \u201ceven if that meant holding back information about my child,\u201d according to the release. Staff met with Taylor\u2019s mother and friends once at police headquarters and once at the retreat, Jonathan Goldbloom, a representative for the ashram, told CNN in a statement. \u201cTo be clear, the police advised us that while we can encourage community members to speak with them, it must be their choice. So, we announced their presence to Taylor\u2019s classmates and teachers and invited anyone wanting to meet with them to come forward,\u201d Goldbloom said.\u00a0\u201cMany of our community members chose to speak with them and the ashram did not intervene in terms of what individuals said.\u00a0They were encouraged to speak freely.\u00a0Any perceived hesitancy could have been due to their own grieving processes.\u201d The retreat has been asking across multiple channels for people to come forward with information and providing guests with regular updates, Goldbloom said. \u201cAll of us are distraught over Taylor\u2019s disappearance, and our hearts go out to her family and friends,\u201d Goldbloom said. \u201cWhen Ms. Seymore\u2019s team observed the conditions and narrative control at the Ashram, they became concerned for their own safety and changed their flights to come home early,\u201d according to the release. Some retreat participants reached out to Seymore to say the retreat never told them about the investigation of Casey\u2019s disappearance, the release states, adding those\u00a0participants\u00a0left the retreat due to safety concerns. \u201cThe police requested Ashram Yoga Retreat participants to submit statements regarding Taylor, but would not specify whether any were interrogated,\u201d the release states. \u201cThe police also refused to inform the family\u2019s team how many statements they had collected and the names of those participants.\u201d Missing cell phone found Casey\u2019s cell phone was found in the water, authorities said, but it\u2019s unclear\u00a0how\u00a0far\u00a0it was from the yoga retreat. \u201cWe have conducted extensive investigation into the matter,\u201d Royal Bahamas Police Force Chief Superintendent Chrislyn Skippings said in a news conference last week. \u201cOur priority is to find Taylor and to find Taylor in good health.\u201d Police refused to give Casey\u2019s phone to Casey\u2019s mother, who said, \u201cI believe that phone may have information we need on there,\u201d the family\u2019s news release states. When asked for comment, the Royal Bahamas Police Force provided CNN with a news release, noting that Casey\u2019s cell phone and journal were found, but police have yet to find Casey\u2019s passport. Police have used drones, search-and-rescue dogs and divers in the investigation and are working with Casey\u2019s family, checking CCTV cameras and interviewing retreat attendees, Skippings said last week. Casey\u2019s family said the police told them they searched only the area between the Ashram Yoga Retreat and the nearby Atlantis\u00a0resort. CNN has reached out to the Atlantis\u00a0resort\u00a0for more information. \u201cWe were told that a description of Taylor was provided to the Atlantis security and that they were the ones who reviewed CCTV footage,\u201d Williams said in the release. \u201cWhat we took this to mean is that the detectives themselves did not review this footage.\u201d Retreat leaders and local police also failed to post missing person posters of Casey in the area, according to the release. A\u00a0missing person flyer\u00a0released by police did not provide details of the circumstances of her disappearance or say whether foul play is suspected.

{"id": "2024_07_02_us_leonard-peltier-denied-parole-fbi-killings", "text": "Leonard Peltier, the Indigenous activist convicted of the 1975 murders of two FBI agents, has been denied parole from federal prison, his attorney told CNN on Tuesday. Peltier, 79, has long maintained his innocence in the shooting deaths of agents Ronald A. Williams and Jack R. Coler. Peltier\u2019s legal team says they plan to appeal the parole board\u2019s decision. Coler and Williams were killed in a shootout June 26, 1975, while searching for a robbery suspect on the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota. In 1977, Peltier was found guilty of first-degree murder and sentenced to two consecutive life terms, though he denied shooting Coler and Williams. \u201cI didn\u2019t kill those agents, I didn\u2019t see who killed those agents, and if I did know, I\u2019m not telling. But I don\u2019t know. That\u2019s the point,\u201d Peltier told CNN correspondent Mark Potter in 1999. Peltier said he fired shots during the gunbattle but \u201cI know I didn\u2019t hit them. I know I didn\u2019t.\u201d The government built its case on ballistics evidence and witness accounts from people who were on the periphery of the shootout, including Native Americans, but no one actually saw the killings. As a leader of the American Indian Movement in the 70s, Peltier\u2019s conviction has long been polarizing. He has been denied parole before \u2013 in 2009, according to The Associated Press, and in 2017, President Barack Obama denied his clemency request. During Peltier\u2019s parole hearing last month, his failing health, age and nonviolent record during his nearly 50 years in prison were all highlighted. Peltier won\u2019t be eligible for another parole hearing until June 2026, a US Parole Commission spokesperson said. \u201cToday\u2019s announcement continues the injustice of this long ordeal for Leonard Peltier,\u201d Peltier\u2019s attorney, Kevin Sharp, said in a statement. \u201cThis decision is a missed opportunity for the United States to finally recognize the misconduct of the FBI and send a message to Indian Country regarding the impacts of the federal government\u2019s actions and policies of the 1970\u2019s.\u201d FBI Director Christopher Wray said the bureau is pleased the US Parole Commission \u201ccontinued to side with the facts.\u201d \u201cNo amount of prison time will ever change the facts\u00a0surrounding the murders of FBI Special Agents Coler and Williams,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cMr. Peltier has been afforded his rights and due process time and again, and repeatedly, the weight of the evidence has supported his conviction and his life sentence.\u201d Supporters of Peltier have said the evidence, including ballistics, produced at trial was unreliable; the FBI has categorically denied it fabricated evidence or coerced witnesses. Lynn Crooks, a prosecutor at Peltier\u2019s 1977 double-murder trial, told CNN in 1999 that they proved Peltier was a participant in the killings. \u201cWhoever was down there was essentially down there under the influence of Leonard\u00a0Peltier,\u201d he said. \u201cThey aren\u2019t down there to give aid and comfort to these two injured, dying men. They\u2019re down there to execute them, and that\u2019s exactly what they did.\u201d Peltier told CNN he was in bed at camp when he heard gunshots. \u201cAll of a sudden everybody said, \u2018Man, we\u2019re being attacked. We\u2019re being attacked,\u2019\u201d he said in 1999. \u201cI says, \u2018Oh, my God.\u2019 So I grabbed an old rifle and started running up to the house.\u201d He said he fired his gun after being fired upon. The FBI has said the agents were shot without provocation. The FBI Agents Association applauded the parole board\u2019s decision Tuesday, saying it \u201cupholds justice for our fallen colleagues and their families.\u201d \u201cThe FBIAA reaffirms its commitment to honoring the memory of Agents Coler and Williams, and Peltier\u2019s continued incarceration is necessary to ensure public safety and respect for the law,\u201d the association said in the statement. Nick Tilsen, president of Indigenous activist group NDN Collective, said, \u201cToday is a sad day for Indigenous Peoples and justice everywhere. The U.S. Parole Commission\u2019s denial of parole for Leonard Peltier, America\u2019s longest serving Indigenous political prisoner, is a travesty.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/02/us/leonard-peltier-denied-parole-fbi-killings/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/03/2024", "section": "us"}}

Many of the gravestones \u2013 some dating back to the late 1800s \u2013 have been knocked face-down, with some cracked in half, at the Tifereth Israel and the Beth Hamedrash Hagadol cemeteries in the Covedale Cemetary complex, a news release on behalf of the Jewish Cemeteries of Greater Cincinnati, the Jewish Federation of Cincinnati and the Jewish Community Relations Council said. The vandalism is believed to have occurred between June 25 and July 1, the statement said, and was discovered Monday morning. The FBI, Cincinnati Police and Green Township of Hamilton County are investigating the incident but there are no known suspects, the release added. The vandalism comes amid a rise in antisemitic incidents across the nation. The\u00a0most recent data\u00a0from the Anti-Defamation League, which has tracked antisemitic incidents in the US since 1979, found a 140% increase from 2022 to 2023, with a \u201cdramatic\u201d increase taking place after the October 7 Hamas\u00a0attacks\u00a0on Israel. \u201cWe unequivocally condemn this act of hatred and desecration. Our hearts go out to the families affected by this senseless vandalism. The Jewish community in Cincinnati is resilient, and we are committed to repairing the damage and restoring the sanctity of these sacred spaces,\u201d the federation\u2019s release said. Sue Susskind, executive director of the Jewish Cemeteries of Greater Cincinnati, told CNN, \u201cUntil you walk that ground and feel it, I mean, it\u2019s horrendous. I\u2019ve never felt anything like that in my life.\u201d While the organization has not yet been able to identify all the graves affected, Susskind said law enforcement has now granted permission for the gravestones to be repaired and inspected. Some of the gravestones are so heavy, they will have to be lifted up by cranes, she said. First, they hope to identify names and pull reports from the Jewish Cemeteries database, Susskind said. For the older graves not in the system, the organization will have to \u201cgo on the ground and try to figure it out.\u201d According to Susskind, families are currently allowed to enter the cemeteries and find their loved ones\u2019 gravestones before reporting if that gravestone is \u201cup or down\u201d in order to reduce the list of suspected impacted areas. Susskind also told CNN two monument companies have reached out and are willing to donate their services in restoring the stones.

Roosevelt\u2019s sister, Corinne Roosevelt Robinson, and his brother-in-law, Douglas Robinson Jr., gifted him the watch just before he left for the Spanish-American War in Cuba in 1898, according to the park service. On the inside of the watch reads the inscription: \u201cTHEODORE ROOSEVELT FROM D.R. AND C.R.R.\u201d the park service said. The silver watch traveled with him during the war, while hunting in Africa and exploring the Amazon in South America, according to the park service. After the 26th president\u2019s death in 1919, his watch was kept as a memento and eventually given to the park service to be put on display at the Sagamore Hill National Historic Site on Long Island. In 1971, the watch was loaned out, initially on a six-year term which was later extended, to the Theodore Roosevelt Inaugural National Historic Site in Buffalo, New York. But on July 21, 1987, the watch was stolen from the site, where it was last seen on display at the site\u2019s Ansley Wilcox House in Buffalo. It wasn\u2019t until last year when the watch reappeared 36 years later at an auction in Florida, the park service said. The auctioneer realized whose pocket watch it was and contacted the historical sites and the park service. The park service and FBI then got involved and worked together to verify the watch was the former president\u2019s stolen watch from 1987. \u201cThe repatriation of the watch would not have been possible without the close collaboration between the FBI and NPS,\u201d FBI Special Agent Robert Giczy said in a news release Thursday. \u201cThis partnership ensured that this historic treasure could be returned safely for future generations to enjoy.\u201d The watch, described by the FBI as a Waltham 17 jewel watch, was returned Thursday to New York to be placed at Roosevelt\u2019s home at the Sagamore Hill National Historic Site and can be viewed by the public for the next three months.

{"id": "2024_07_02_business_state-farm-california-rate-hikes", "text": "State Farm is seeking increases of as much as 52% for some of its residential insurance rates in California, which could ramp up the financial burden for many homeowners and renters in the state\u2019s troubled insurance market. It\u2019s the third major change for State Farm in California within the last year. The insurer stopped selling insurance for new homes in the state last summer, citing wildfire risks and skyrocketing construction costs. The insurer, California\u2019s largest, is requesting a 30% rate increase for its homeowners line, a 52% rate increase for renters and a 36% rate increase for condominium owners. State Farm was previously approved for a 20% hike for homeowners\u2019 and condominium owners\u2019 policies last December. The company said in a statement that its state subsidiary, State Farm General, is \u201cworking toward its long-term sustainability in California\u201d and that the rate increases are \u201cdriven by increased costs and risk and are necessary for State Farm General to deliver on the promises the company makes every day to its customers.\u201d \u201cWe continue to look for ways to maintain competitive rates and help our customers manage their risk,\u201d a State Farm spokesperson said. \u201cCustomers with questions are encouraged to speak with their local State Farm agent. The agent can review the customer\u2019s policy, including deductibles and coverages.\u201d The California Department of Insurance has to approve the rate changes. \u201cState Farm General\u2019s latest rate filings raise serious questions about its financial condition,\u201d California Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara said in a statement. \u201cThis has the potential to affect millions of California consumers and the integrity of our residential property insurance market.\u201d Lara said his agency \u201cwill investigate State Farm\u2019s financial situation, including a rate hearing on these applications if necessary.\u201d He added that \u201cnothing changes today for State Farm policyholders as a result of these filings. We are going to lead with facts to make sure Californians are protected.\u201d The company made its previous decision to hike rates \u201cdue to historic increases in construction costs outpacing inflation, rapidly growing catastrophe exposure, and a challenging reinsurance market,\u201d according to a May 2023 statement from State Farm General. (The changes didn\u2019t affect its existing auto insurance coverage.) California has seen an average of\u00a0more than 7,000 wildfires each year, consuming an average of over 2 million acres, over the past several years, according to data from the governor\u2019s office. Scientists and California authorities blame the climate crisis for the intensity of the fire seasons. A few months following State Farm\u2019s decision to stop offering new home insurance, Farmers Insurance also started limiting new homeowners insurance policies in California, citing high costs and wildfire risks. Farmers is the second-largest provider of homeowners insurance in the state, after State Farm. It\u2019s getting\u00a0harder and harder to find homeowners insurance\u00a0in the states that are the most vulnerable to the effects of climate change. In Florida, Farmer\u2019s also recently stopped offering its home, auto and umbrella policies in the hurricane-prone state. \u2013CNN\u2019s Cheri Mossburg contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/02/business/state-farm-california-rate-hikes/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/03/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_07_02_us_salman-rushdie-stabbing-suspect-plea-deal-reject", "text": "The man accused of stabbing author Salman\u00a0Rushdie, leaving him blind in one eye, rejected a plea deal Tuesday that would have tied in a federal terrorism-related charge but reduced his state prison sentence, according to the suspect\u2019s lawyer. The 75-year-old famed author\u00a0\u2013 who has for decades lived under threat because of his writings \u2013\u00a0was stabbed multiple times onstage as he prepared to give a lecture at the\u00a0Chautauqua Institution\u00a0in western New York on August 12, 2022. The suspect, Hadi Matar, has pleaded not guilty to state charges of second-degree attempted murder and second-degree assault. Under the conditions of the proposed plea deal, Matar would have received a 20-year sentence for the top state charge, which has a maximum sentence of 25 years, according to the Chautauqua County District Attorney\u2019s Office. The proposed agreement was made with the understanding that Matar would also plead guilty to a federal charge, for which he could receive additional prison time, said his defense attorney, Nathaniel Barone. That charge alleges Matar attempted to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization, Barone said. Matar\u2019s total prison time under the agreement likely would have been between 30 and 40 years, with lifetime supervision upon release, according to the DA\u2019s office. \u201cAt this point now, we need to change our direction a little bit and start focusing on actual trial preparation,\u201d Barone told CNN.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s going to take us the full next several months leading up to jury selection in order to properly and adequately prepare.\u201d Matar\u2019s trial is scheduled to begin on September 9, according to his attorney and the prosecutor\u2019s office. The trial was initially set for January 8 this year, but the court granted a request for a delay earlier that month, his attorney previously told CNN. Barone said Rushdie\u2019s then-upcoming memoir about the 2022 attack and his recovery for it, titled \u201cKnife: Meditations After an Attempted Murder,\u201d was not the reason for the delay in the trial. But he went on to say, \u201cpursuant to the New York State Criminal Procedure Law, the defense is entitled to any and all information associated with the drafting and publication of the book.\u201d Rushdie and another man who was injured in the attack, Henry Reese, are both expected to testify in the upcoming trial, the DA\u2019s office previously told CNN. In a phone call with CNN last month, Barone expressed concern about the ability to seat an impartial jury. \u201cThe scene of the incident is literally just five minutes away, it\u2019s right down the road,\u201d he said, adding he plans to request a change of venue for the trial. Barone said federal officials have also been conducting a \u201cworldwide investigation\u201d into Matar, who is now 26, but there has not yet been a federal indictment. One of the world\u2019s most celebrated writers, Rushdie endured death threats after his 1988 novel \u201cThe Satanic Verses\u201d angered many Muslims, who considered it sacrilegious. The late Iranian leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini called for his death and Rushdie spent a decade under British protection. In the August 2022 attack, the author suffered three stab wounds to his neck, four to his stomach, puncture wounds to his right eye and chest, and a cut on his right thigh, Chautauqua County District Attorney Jason Schmidt has said. Rushdie was blinded in the eye and the attack also affected the use of one of his hands. Barone has previously said Matar \u201cmaintained his innocence on the matter.\u201d \u201cThe one thing I\u2019ve stressed throughout this is, everyone is entitled to their day in court, and there\u2019s the presumption of innocence that\u2019s the most important constitutional right that we can have, any one of us,\u201d Barone told CNN.

Lloyd Doggett of Texas on Tuesday became the first sitting Democratic member of Congress to call on President Joe Biden to withdraw from the presidential race, a huge moment for the Democratic Party as Doggett says publicly what many elected officials had been speculating about privately. \u201cI represent the heart of a congressional district once represented by Lyndon Johnson.\u00a0Under very different circumstances, he made the painful decision to withdraw,\u201d Doggett said in his statement. \u201cPresident Biden should do the same.\u201d Doggett\u2019s statement magnifies the pressure surrounding the president and his team, who have been trying to tamp down party concerns in the wake of Biden\u2019s disappointing debate performance against former President Donald Trump last week, and Doggett\u2019s comments could embolden others to follow suit. In calling on Biden to step aside, Doggett said the president could help usher in a new generation of leadership to help the party achieve its ultimate goal: defeating Trump. \u201cRecognizing that, unlike Trump, President Biden\u2019s first commitment has always been to our country, not himself, I am hopeful that he will make the painful and difficult decision to withdraw,\u201d Doggett said. \u201cI respectfully call on him to do so.\u201d Earlier on Tuesday, Democratic Rep. Mike Quigley of Illinois had signaled an openness to replace Biden as the party\u2019s presidential nominee. \u201cI think his four years are one of the great presidencies of our lifetime, but I think he has to be honest with himself,\u201d Quigley told Kasie Hunt on CNN \u201cThis Morning.\u201d \u201cThis is a decision he\u2019s going to have to make.\u201d \u201cWe have to be honest with ourselves that it wasn\u2019t just a horrible night, but I won\u2019t go beyond that out of my respect and understanding of President Joe Biden, a very proud person who has served us extraordinarily well for 50 years,\u201d he added. Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a strong Biden ally, said on MSNBC that the president should be participating in multiple interviews as people evaluate him. \u201cI think it\u2019s essential for them to do that,\u201d Pelosi told MSNBC\u2019s Andrea Mitchell on Tuesday. The former speaker,\u00a0who emphasized it is Biden\u2019s decision\u00a0about whether to step aside,\u00a0said that she has heard \u201cmixed\u201d responses to the debate from donors and other people in her Democratic network. \u201cI\u00a0think\u00a0it\u2019s\u00a0a\u00a0legitimate\u00a0question\u00a0to\u00a0say,\u00a0is\u00a0this\u00a0an\u00a0episode\u00a0or\u00a0is\u00a0this\u00a0a\u00a0condition,\u201d Pelosi said,\u00a0though she added that the\u00a0same should be asked of Trump, citing his\u00a0repeated lies\u00a0during the debate.

Jim\u00a0Clyburn of South Carolina, a crucial ally for Biden,\u00a0said on MSNBC he still supports Biden at the top of the ticket but\u00a0added that he would support Vice President Kamala Harris if Biden were to withdraw as the Democratic presidential nominee. \u201cI will support her if he were to step aside,\u201d Clyburn\u00a0said when asked what he would do if Biden withdraws, later adding, \u201cThis party should not in any way do anything to work around Miss Harris.\u201d However, Clyburn\u00a0reaffirmed his support for Biden. \u201cI want this ticket to continue to be Biden-Harris and then we will see what happens after the next election,\u201d he said. Even more Democrats have been expressing their concerns behind the scenes. While the Biden campaign and White House have maintained that the president is staying in the race and have chalked up Biden\u2019s debate performance to a bad night that doesn\u2019t overshadow his accomplishments, lawmakers from across the party have been reaching out to share their anxieties about Biden remaining at the top of the ticket. A House Democratic lawmaker told CNN that, \u201cThere\u2019s a large and increasing group of House Democrats concerned about the president\u2019s candidacy, representing a broad swath of the caucus. We are deeply concerned about his trajectory and his ability to win. We want to give him space to make a decision [to step aside] but we will be increasingly vocal about our concerns if he doesn\u2019t.\u201d This story has been updated with additional developments.

{"id": "2024_07_02_politics_us-government-employees-gaza-policy-statement", "text": "The US government employees who have publicly resigned in protest of the Biden administration\u2019s Gaza policies released a\u00a0joint statement\u00a0on Tuesday for the first time, stating they \u201cstand united in a shared belief that it is our collective responsibility to speak up\u201d and outlining steps they believe the US government should take. The 12 signatories tendered their resignations at various points over the course of the nearly nine-month conflict between Israel and Hamas, with one resigning as recently as Tuesday. Many of them have spoken out, including to CNN, about their decisions to publicly leave in protest of the administration\u2019s policies. As\u00a0CNN reported\u00a0last month, the officials had begun banding together to put pressure on the government to change course. Tuesday\u2019s statement was released in conjunction with the July Fourth holiday, noting that \u201cas our nation celebrates its Independence Day, each of us are reminded that we resigned from government not to terminate that oath but to continue to abide by it; not to end our commitment to service, but to extend it.\u201d \u201cThe Administration\u2019s policy in Gaza is a failure and a threat to U.S. national security,\u201d they write in the joint statement, titled \u201cService in Dissent.\u201d \u201cAmerica\u2019s diplomatic cover for, and continuous flow of arms to, Israel has ensured our undeniable complicity in the killings and forced starvation of a besieged Palestinian population in Gaza. This is not only morally reprehensible and in clear violation of international humanitarian law and U.S. laws, but it has also put a target on America\u2019s back,\u201d they continue, arguing that it has put the lives of service members and diplomats at risk. President Joe Biden has faced pressure both abroad and at home over his\u00a0support for Israel\u00a0in its war in Gaza\u00a0\u2013 a\u00a0conflict\u00a0that has cost tens of thousands of civilian lives, displaced millions and brought extreme hunger throughout the enclave. Although the rhetoric from the administration has become harsher \u2013 with warnings that Israel must do more to protect civilians and allow more aid in \u2013 the policies have remained largely unchanged. The resigned officials argue that the US policy toward Gaza has \u201cbeen deeply damaging not only for U.S relations in the region, but for our global credibility, the credibility of U.S. values, and the credibility of the West \u2014 a particularly perilous state of affairs in the context of this era of strategic competition.\u201d The joint statement lays out six recommendations to the US government. Among them are a call for the US government to \u201cfaithfully execute the law,\u201d saying that \u201cit is abundantly clear that the Administration is currently willfully violating multiple U.S. laws and attempting to deny or distort facts, use loopholes, or manipulate processes to ensure a continuous flow of lethal weapons to Israel.\u201d It also calls for the government to use \u201call necessary and available leverage to bring the conflict to an immediate close\u201d; expansion of humanitarian aid; support of the self-determination of the Palestinian people; stronger oversight and accountability mechanisms within the executive branch; and support of freedom of speech for college protesters. Resigned officials who previously spoke with CNN said many of their former colleagues felt similarly to them but were not in a position to resign. The joint statement concludes with a message to such colleagues, telling them that their \u201cvoice matters.\u201d \u201cWe encourage you to keep pushing. In our experience, no decision point is too minor to challenge, so while you are in government service, use your voice, write letters to leaders in your agencies, and bring up your disagreements with your team,\u201d they continue. \u201cSpeaking out has a snowball effect, inspiring others to use their voice. There is strength in numbers, and we urge you to not be complicit.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/02/politics/us-government-employees-gaza-policy-statement/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/03/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_07_02_us_karen-read-mistrial-what-happens-next", "text": "The murder trial of Karen Read ended in a mistrial Monday after jurors couldn\u2019t reach a unanimous verdict, prolonging a case that\u2019s divided a Massachusetts community amid allegations of a sweeping cover-up by police and investigative misconduct. While not an acquittal, the outcome was a boon for Read, who is accused of drunkenly driving into her then-boyfriend, Boston police officer John O\u2019Keefe, and leaving him to die on a snowy night in January 2022 outside a home in Canton, Massachusetts. The 45-year-old had pleaded not guilty to charges of second-degree murder, vehicular manslaughter while intoxicated and leaving the scene of a collision, and she faced up to life in prison if convicted. But prosecutors with the Norfolk District Attorney\u2019s Office failed to convince the jury of six men and six women beyond a reasonable doubt. Over the last two days of the five-day deliberations, jurors repeatedly informed the judge they were hopelessly deadlocked, saying in a final note on Monday their perspectives were \u201cstarkly divided.\u201d Now, prosecutors must decide whether to rethink their approach. As they reconsider their case, they may decide to present evidence differently in hopes of securing a conviction, or avoid a second trial altogether and offer a plea deal, legal experts said. \u201cThey\u2019re going to make an assessment about basically what went wrong,\u201d trial attorney Misty Marris told CNN. \u201cYou go back, and you do the diagnostic: Where does the evidence fail to meet those standards from the jury\u2019s perspective?\u201d Here\u2019s what could happen next: Prosecutors intend to retry the case In a brief statement Monday, the office of Norfolk County District Attorney Michael Morrissey said it plans to retry the case, which alleged Read and O\u2019Keefe had gotten into an argument the night of January 28, 2022, before she struck him with her SUV and fled the scene. The couple had been out drinking at two bars with friends, then went to the home of O\u2019Keefe\u2019s colleague for an after-party, court documents show. O\u2019Keefe was found the next morning bruised and battered in the snow outside the home in Canton. Read and her attorneys had, in turn, presented another theory: Read dropped O\u2019Keefe off, then left \u2013 while O\u2019Keefe was injured in a fight with off-duty officers inside the home, mauled by the homeowners\u2019 dog, then tossed in the snow to die. The police then conspired to fabricate evidence and lie under oath to protect their own and frame Read, her defense alleged. Court documents say Read went looking the next morning for O\u2019Keefe in the snowstorm and found his body in the front yard of the Canton home. Prosecutors rejected that theory, presenting evidence the couple had a volatile relationship. Firefighters who responded the morning of January 29 to the site of O\u2019Keefe\u2019s body asked about his injuries and were told by Read, \u201cI hit him, I hit him,\u201d according to their testimony. Additionally, Read\u2019s vehicle had a broken taillight, and pieces of the taillight were found at the scene. Read\u2019s attorneys on Monday signaled they would not shy away from a retrial. \u201cNo matter how long it takes, no matter how long they keep trying, we will not stop fighting. We have no quit,\u201d\u00a0Alan Jackson, one of Karen Read\u2019s attorneys, said in video provided by CNN affiliate WCVB outside the courthouse. Prosecutors could rethink the case \u2026 Prosecutors\u2019 decision to quickly signal their intent to retry the case wasn\u2019t unexpected, said Rosanna Cavallaro, a professor of law at Suffolk University in Boston. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to be seen as thinking that they failed, or that they have nothing but a very strong case,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the reality is, of course, that what a mistrial means is that the jury could not agree, and they were not persuaded.\u201d But ahead of a status conference on July 22, prosecutors will be engaged in a post mortem of the case, said Daniel Medwed, a law professor at Northeastern University, and they will be asking themselves a series of questions. \u201cWhat worked, what didn\u2019t work? If they were to proceed again,\u201d he said, \u201cwould they choose the same charges? \u2026 Would they change their strategy in some ways? Where are places that they need to shore up their case, maybe through additional investigation?\u201d Perhaps, Medwed said, prosecutors will look back and feel they overreached charging Read with murder, which requires intent, and instead focus on the other charge. \u201cThey might just consider dropping the murder charge and going with manslaughter,\u201d he said. Indeed, Cavallaro said the indictment against Read and the charges stemming from it would not change. But prosecutors could offer another narrative that would make it easier for a second jury to convict Read on a lesser type of homicide than second-degree murder like manslaughter or reckless manslaughter. The stories heard by the jury were \u201cbinary\u201d and \u201cpolarized,\u201d she said: In prosecutors\u2019 telling, Read intended to kill O\u2019Keefe, while the defense argued she was innocent and framed. \u201cIt\u2019s possible the second time around, the government says, \u2018Maybe we need to give the jury this intermediate possibility that she didn\u2019t mean to kill him,\u2019\u201d Cavallaro said, in addition to alleging Read intended to murder O\u2019Keefe. \u201cIt captures the idea that a reasonable person would have been more careful, and because of your lack of care, your recklessness, a death occurred that you\u2019re responsible for,\u201d she added. \u201cThat behavior is punishable as a homicide, but not as a murder,\u201d she said. \u2026 or offer a plea deal Former Massachusetts Attorney General Martha Coakley indicated in an interview with WCVB that prosecutors could drop the most serious charge of second-degree murder, adding, \u201cThey can also seek to plea bargain, which is something that I\u2019m guessing they will at least talk about.\u201d \u201cIf I were defense counsel, you owe it to your client to talk and the prosecution could talk about whether they could reduce charges and reach some plea agreement,\u201d Coakley said. In jurors\u2019 final note to the judge before she declared a mistrial, they said \u201csome members\u201d believed the prosecutors had met the burden of proof, proving the charges beyond a reasonable doubt. But \u201cothers\u201d felt the evidence failed to meet that standard. Jurors\u2019 language signaled it was not a single holdout but multiple jurors who were unconvinced, Cavallaro said, which the defense would take as a win. \u201cGiven that,\u201d she asked, \u201cis there any temptation for (Read) to plead?\u201d Medwed echoed that idea, pointing out that Read\u2019s defense focused on her proclaimed innocence in O\u2019Keefe\u2019s death. He would be surprised if she was interested in pleading guilty to anything that would include admitting she caused O\u2019Keefe\u2019s death. State trooper\u2019s testimony appears to be key A key decision could be whether to present testimony from a lead investigator who had to apologize on the stand for sexist and offensive texts he sent about Read in a private group chat, according to WCVB. Massachusetts State Police Trooper Michael Proctor called her a \u201cwhack job,\u201d mocked her medical issues and told coworkers he found \u201cno nudes\u201d while searching her phone for evidence, the station reported. Proctor was relieved of duty Monday following the mistrial, state police Col. John Mawn said in a news release. \u201cThis follows our previous decision to open an internal affairs investigation after information about serious misconduct emerged in testimony at the trial,\u201d Mawn said, adding the investigation is ongoing. CNN has sought comment from the State Police Association of Massachusetts. An attorney for Proctor previously said he was cooperating with the internal inquiry and said his personal messages did not undermine the investigation into O\u2019Keefe\u2019s death. There\u2019s no evidence Proctor tampered with any evidence, Julie Grant, a Court TV anchor and a former federal prosecutor, told CNN\u2019s Sara Sidner Tuesday. But his behavior and comments were \u201cunprofessional.\u201d \u201cThe Massachusetts State Police \u2013 you have to wonder if they felt as if he had any role in this hung jury,\u201d she said. Still, experts who spoke to CNN saw Proctor\u2019s testimony as key to the commonwealth\u2019s case, which might force prosecutors to call on him despite the apparent baggage. \u201cHe\u2019s the lead investigator, which means that his performance, his work, his efforts are inherently relevant to the case,\u201d Medwed said, adding the defense would likely call the trooper to impeach the investigation even if prosecutors didn\u2019t. \u201cI just don\u2019t see how the government can avoid him as much as they\u2019d like to,\u201d Medwed said.

{"id": "2024_06_29_us_conservatives-14th-amendment-challenge-race-based-programs", "text": "The Supreme Court\u2019s decision to\u00a0gut affirmative action\u00a0in college admissions one year ago has opened the door for numerous legal challenges against race-based grant programs, internships and scholarships across the country. Many of those lawsuits are being filed by conservative groups who insist that it\u2019s unconstitutional to design and operate a program exclusively for a certain racial group. They argue that the programs\u00a0particularly disadvantage White\u00a0and Asian\u00a0Americans, by preventing them from obtaining the jobs, funding or opportunities that these programs offer to\u00a0other racial groups. Some lawsuits invoke the Equal Protection Clause of the\u00a014th\u00a0amendment\u00a0which was ratified after slavery was abolished and says no state may \u201cdeny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\u201d The amendment was notably cited in Justice Clarence Thomas\u2019\u00a0concurring opinion\u00a0in the landmark affirmative action ruling,\u00a0who described it as a \u201ccrowning accomplishment\u201d of Congress. Thomas\u00a0argued that the 14th\u00a0Amendment \u201censures racial equality with no textual reference to race whatsoever.\u201d \u201cIn the wake of the Civil War, the Framers of the Fourteenth Amendment charted a way out: a colorblind Constitution that requires the government to, at long last, put aside its citizens\u2019 skin color and focus on their individual achievements,\u201d he wrote. But some historians argue that the history of centuries of slavery and racism that ultimately led to the ratification of the 14thamendment is often lost in the conversations around\u00a0affirmative action. The amendment, they say, was never intended to be colorblind. Why was the 14th amendment passed? The 14th\u00a0amendment was ratified on July 9, 1868, to grant citizenship and equal protection of the law to anyone\u00a0\u201cborn\u00a0or naturalized\u00a0in the United States,\u201d\u00a0including formerly enslaved Black people. At the time, the passage of the amendment was necessary because millions of Black people were newly freed and their legal and civil rights had not been established. Eric\u00a0Foner,\u00a0a\u00a0historian and professor at Columbia University who specializes in the\u00a0Civil War, Reconstruction and slavery, said the 14th amendment enabled Black people to legally enjoy freedoms such as getting an education, owning land and riding street cars. Foner\u00a0also said the amendment was created to ensure that programs specifically for newly freed Black Americans were able to continue. One example, he said, was the\u00a0Freedman\u2019s Bureau, which was established in 1865 to provide aid such as food, clothing and medical services to formerly enslaved people. \u201cCertainly, this notion of equal protection of the law was both a general principal applied to everybody and a particular justification for assistance to Black people,\u201d\u00a0Foner\u00a0said. \u201cYou have to look at the broad historical context.\u201d But even after the amendment was ratified,\u00a0Jim\u00a0Crow\u00a0laws, segregation and racial violence prevented Black Americans from gaining equality. Some racial disparities persist today and now, more\u00a0than\u00a0150 years later, the same amendment that paved the way for programs that help many Black people is being used\u00a0as justification\u00a0to\u00a0dismantle them. How is it being interpreted in today\u2019s legal challenges? The 14th\u00a0amendment has been cited in several lawsuits filed by conservative groups challenging the constitutionality of programs specifically for people of color. Some of these legal challenges\u00a0successfully forced\u00a0defendants to open their programs to people of all races, either voluntarily or\u00a0through a court order. Earlier this year, legal strategist Edward Blum,\u00a0through his legal advocacy group the American Alliance for Equal Rights,\u00a0sued\u00a0the\u00a0director of the Smithsonian\u2019s National Museum of the American Latino and the director of the Institute of Museum and Library Services over an\u00a0internship program that was open only to Latino applicants,\u00a0saying it\u00a0violated the\u00a0US\u00a0Constitution. The\u00a0complaint\u00a0cited both the 14th\u00a0amendment and\u00a0the\u00a0Fifth\u00a0amendment while arguing that the internship program violated the right of\u00a0\u201cAmericans, like Plaintiff\u2019s members,\u201d to equal protection under\u00a0the law. When asked for comment about the settlement,\u00a0David Coronado, a spokesperson for the National Museum of the American Latino said in an email to CNN,\u00a0said the museum has now added language\u00a0to the program\u2019s website and scoring rubric\u00a0that\u00a0\u201cspells out what had been our practice already,\u201d\u00a0CNN previously reported. \u201cThe National Museum of the American Latino reaffirmed its longstanding commitment to equal opportunity for all internship applicants, regardless of race or ethnicity,\u201d Coronado said.\u00a0 In a statement to CNN this week, Blum said the 14th\u00a0amendment\u2019s equal protection clause \u201chas been interpreted to mean that individual Americans should never be treated differently because of their race.\u201d Blum said, in his view, \u201cany program or policy such as college admissions, fellowships, internships, grants, financial aid and employment that excludes someone because of their race is usually in violation of the 14th\u00a0Amendment.\u201d The\u00a0museum\u00a0settled with Blum\u00a0in March\u00a0and\u00a0now states\u00a0its internship program\u00a0is \u201cequally open\u00a0to students of all races and ethnicities.\u201d The 14th\u00a0amendment was also invoked in a\u00a0recent lawsuit\u00a0filed by\u00a0the conservative group\u00a0Judicial Watch against the city of Evanston, Illinois over a reparations program for Black residents\u00a0meant to correct past discriminatory housing practices.\u00a0Under the program, Black residents who lived in the city between 1919 and 1969 \u2013 as well as their direct descendants \u2013 can apply for up to $25,000 in housing assistance or a direct cash payment,\u00a0CNN previously reported. But\u00a0the lawsuit,\u00a0filed on behalf of six people whose parents or grandparents lived in Evanston during the outlined time period but do not identify as Black,\u00a0argues that solely limiting the cash payment to eligible Black Americans \u201cviolates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution\u201d because \u201cEvanston is discriminating against each member on the basis of the member\u2019s race.\u201d Tom Fitton, president of Judicial Watch, said the reparations program is a \u201cbrazen violation\u201d of the 14th\u00a0amendment. \u201cYou get equal protection of the law under our constitution irrespective of your race,\u201d Fitton told CNN in an interview earlier this month. \u201cThere are no exceptions for denying people equal protection of the law.\u201d Why are there clashing interpretations? David Blight, a history and African American studies professor at Yale University, said he believes the 14th\u00a0amendment was written in a way that leaves it open to different interpretations. Blight said while it was initially ratified to help formerly enslaved Black people,\u00a0the language in the amendment is vague. It\u2019s also unclear how it should be enforced, Blight said. This has allowed conservatives today to use it to their advantage in legal challenges against race-based programs, he said. \u201cThe 14th\u00a0amendment is, without any question, malleable,\u201d Blight said. \u201cIt can be twisted and used all kinds of ways and that\u2019s what has happened with affirmative action.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/29/us/conservatives-14th-amendment-challenge-race-based-programs/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/03/2024", "section": "us"}}

The White House announced Tuesday\u00a0that Biden\u00a0is expected to\u00a0meet with Democratic governors and congressional leaders Wednesday after\u00a0some\u00a0demanded a meeting with the president. Some officials have been turned off by the Biden campaign\u2019s dismissiveness over their concerns about the president\u2019s health. And earlier Tuesday, a Democratic member of Congress became the first to ask Biden to drop out of the race. The White House preempted the first questions from reporters by announcing Biden will appear in two high-profile events over the next week: an interview with ABC\u2019s George Stephanopoulos that will air in part on Friday and a solo news conference during the NATO summit in Washington next week. Such unscripted events are rare for the president, who by CNN\u2019s count lags behind his most recent predecessors in formal press conferences. Thursday\u2019s debate was the biggest audience Biden has had since his last round of debates against former President Donald Trump four years ago \u2013 exacerbating the shock some felt at his performance. Asked whether Biden regularly presents himself the way he did at the debate, Jean-Pierre evoked a speech that Biden gave in North Carolina the day after the debate: \u201cHe understands that he\u2019s not a young man,\u201d she said, adding that his focus is going to be on continuing \u201cto deliver for the American people on the issues that they care about.\u201d In a deeply reported piece published Tuesday, The New York Times reported that people in the room with Biden have become increasingly concerned with how he has recently presented himself, describing the president as seeming confused at some points during two high-profile trips to Europe in recent weeks. Biden has increasingly indicated he is aware of the problems with his debate performance as the fallout within his own party has mounted. The president said during a fundraiser Tuesday that he \u201calmost fell asleep onstage\u201d during CNN\u2019s presidential debate last week, according to pool reports. \u201cI decided to travel around the world a couple of times \u2026 shortly before the debate \u2026 I didn\u2019t listen to my staff \u2026 and then I almost fell asleep onstage,\u201d Biden said during the fundraiser in Virginia on Tuesday evening. The remark was met with laughter from those in attendance, according to a recording of the president\u2019s remarks. Multiple reporters who were in the room said that they believed the \u201cfell asleep\u201d line appeared intended to be a joke and that Biden was trying to make light of the situation in a self-deprecating way, but it did not land, in their view. Jean-Pierre reiterated during the press briefing that Biden had been sick during the debate last week \u2013 adding that he still had a cold. The president did not take any cold medication prior to the debate, she said. \u201cI would not see this as an episode,\u201d Jean-Pierre said. \u201cI would see this as what it was and what we believe it to be \u2013 which is, it was a bad night.\u201d She added the administration is \u201cabsolutely not\u201d hiding information about the president\u2019s health or ability to do his job. Jean-Pierre also addressed recent reporting that Hunter Biden had been joining his father in recent White House meetings. NBC was the\u00a0first to report\u00a0on Hunter Biden\u2019s participation in the meetings. Jean-Pierre said the president\u2019s son, who was convicted last month on three felony gun charges,\u00a0returned to the White House with his father after spending the weekend at Camp David and \u201cwalked with him into\u201d a meeting to prepare for Biden\u2019s Monday night speech on the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Trump\u2019s immunity case. \u201cAnd he ended up spending time with his dad and his family that night. That is basically what happened,\u201d Jean-Pierre said. \u201cThey were together at Camp David. They came back together.\u201d Jean-Pierre also declined to engage with a question from CNN\u2019s MJ Lee on a CNN poll conducted following last week\u2019s debate showing Vice President Kamala Harris outpacing Biden in a hypothetical race against Trump. The poll shows Harris within striking distance of Trump in a hypothetical matchup: 47% of registered voters support Trump and 45% Harris, a result within the margin of error that suggests there is no clear leader under such a scenario. Jean-Pierre offered a confusing response referring the inquiry to the president\u2019s reelection campaign. \u201cWhat I can speak to, is the president\u2019s record. What I can speak to what he\u2019s been able to accomplish,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd the things that he\u2019s been able to do and get done \u2026 is actually in line with majority of Americans. And I think that\u2019s important to note, and again, I will say with age comes wisdom and experience. And that certainly it\u2019s something that the president brings.\u201d Harris batted down the idea of running in Biden\u2019s place during a brief interview with CBS Tuesday afternoon: \u201cLook, Joe Biden is our nominee. We beat Trump once and we\u2019re going to beat him again, period,\u201d she said. This story has been updated with additional reporting.

The\u00a0outage began on Wednesday, June 19,\u00a0after two cyber incidents halted the company\u2019s systems, which provide software to nearly 15,000 car dealerships across North America, according to CDK. Auto dealerships use CDK\u2019s software to manage everything from scheduling to records. The company said it is working actively to bring other applications live. It said it expects the Customer Relationship Management system to begin rolling out on July 4. The outage would have cost care dealerships millions of dollars more if it stretched on. According to an estimate by Anderson Economic Group, CDK\u2019s system collapse could result in approximately $944 million in direct losses due to business interruptions for affected car dealers if the outage lasted a full three weeks. It\u2019s an encouraging sign that operations can soon go back to normal. For days, CDK has said it had started restoring its software, but both car buyers and dealers remained at a standstill. It has suggested several times that a fix is in order, only to say then that its systems would remain out of commission for a while longer.

{"id": "2024_07_02_politics_biden-debate-performance-democrats", "text": "Defiance has become as much a part of Joe Biden\u2019s psychology as Delaware. But as the president and his inner circle dig in following his disastrous debate performance last week, a growing number of Democratic leaders are saying they want him to step aside for the good of the party \u2013 and the country. Democratic Rep. Lloyd Doggett of Texas was the first to break ranks. \u201cI represent the heart of a congressional district once represented by Lyndon Johnson.\u00a0Under very different circumstances, he made the painful decision to withdraw.\u00a0President Biden should do the same,\u201d Doggett said in his statement Tuesday. \u201cThere\u2019s a large and increasing group of House Democrats concerned about the president\u2019s candidacy, representing a broad swath of the caucus,\u201d another House Democratic lawmaker told CNN on condition of anonymity to speak candidly. \u201cWe are deeply concerned about his trajectory and his ability to win. We want to give him space to make a decision [to step aside], but we will be increasingly vocal about our concerns if he doesn\u2019t.\u201d Biden is expected to meet Wednesday with Democratic governors and congressional leaders, the White House said Tuesday. The announcement came after CNN reported that some governors expressed concerns about the president\u2019s debate performance. The governors, one source said, were worried about going public with their concerns out of fear it would lead to Biden digging in further. CNN talked to more than two dozen current and former Democratic officials, as well as donors and longtime Biden allies, all of whom spoke on condition of anonymity to avoid alienating Biden. Many of these people say they have already made up their minds that the president should quit his campaign, a decision some of them think he needs to announce this week. They have held off going to Biden directly, hoping he would make the decision himself, but patience is wearing thin, multiple Democrats told CNN, amid signs that Biden has taken no steps to seriously consider the mounting concerns.\u00a0He is poised to travel to swing states this weekend, aides said, a sign that he has no plans of changing course. On Tuesday, ABC News announced Biden will sit down with George Stephanopoulos for his first TV interview since the debate, with clips airing on Friday. Initially, there was hope that the president\u2019s family would convince him to step aside,\u00a0given how badly the debate went. However, at a Biden retreat Sunday at Camp David, it became apparent the president\u2019s family rallied around his decision to continue his campaign, blaming staff for his missteps. \u201cOne word you know about Biden: stubborn,\u201d said one senior Democratic official who has publicly supported Biden in the past but who privately thinks he needs to step aside. \u201cThey are trying to give him the space to realize what a disaster this is.\u201d And while the Biden campaign has insisted the debate was just a bad night for the 81-year-old president, the Democrats who want him to step aside say it was not a one-off incident that can be fixed. \u201cThis is not like Obama being rusty for a debate,\u201d said a senior Democratic official, referring to former President Barack Obama\u2019s lackluster performance in his first debate against Republican opponent Mitt Romney in 2012. \u201c[Biden] might be able to survive this if this was the only incident. But it won\u2019t be the only incident,\u201d said a senior Capitol Hill Democratic official. \u201cWe have to be honest with ourselves that it wasn\u2019t just a horrible night,\u201d Illinois Rep. Mike Quigley told Kasie Hunt on\u00a0\u201cCNN This Morning\u201d on Tuesday.\u00a0\u201cHe clearly has to understand, I think, what you\u2019re getting to here is that his decision not only impacts who\u2019s going to serve in the White House the next four years but who\u2019s going to serve in the Senate, who\u2019s going to serve in the House, and it will have implications for decades to come.\u201d During an interview on MSNBC on Tuesday, former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called on Biden to participate in multiple interviews with journalists in the aftermath of his debate performance. The California Democrat,\u00a0who emphasized it is Biden\u2019s decision\u00a0about whether to step aside,\u00a0said she has heard \u201cmixed\u201d responses to the debate from donors and others in her Democratic network. \u201cI\u00a0think\u00a0it\u2019s\u00a0a\u00a0legitimate\u00a0question\u00a0to\u00a0say,\u00a0is\u00a0this\u00a0an\u00a0episode\u00a0or\u00a0is\u00a0this\u00a0a\u00a0condition?\u201d Pelosi said, referring to Biden\u2019s debate performance. She quickly added that this was a legitimate question for former President Donald Trump as well, citing his\u00a0repeated lies\u00a0during the debate. Stakes have never been higher The stakes, already remarkable, were raised even higher after the Supreme Court on Monday ruled Trump is entitled to considerable immunity from prosecution, a development that some concerned Democrats say makes it more urgent for Biden to step aside. The decision hands the former president a significant legal win and \u201cmakes Trump even more dangerous,\u201d said one former elected Democratic official who has supported Biden for years but who now wants him to end his campaign. One Biden adviser argued that the decision, and the fears of how Trump might now feel emboldened to act if reelected, only strengthens Biden\u2019s argument for staying in, as what that adviser said still feels like the surest bet of beating Trump. Some\u00a0leading Democrats, including at least one high-ranking Biden administration official,\u00a0have already started discussing what they believe would be a painful process to replace Biden and\u00a0pick a new ticket. In addition to Vice President Kamala Harris, a handful of governors and lawmakers are waiting on the Democratic bench. With\u00a0just\u00a0six weeks until the\u00a0Democratic National Convention\u00a0and under 130 days until the election, they want to get started. Facing\u00a0the highest-stakes moment of his long career, Biden is doubling down. The president who still thinks of himself as the stuttering kid so poor he had to wear nuts and bolts as cufflinks to a ninth-grade dance is still holding on to hope that this can be the latest time he comes back after being written off. \u201cHe bets on himself, and he always takes the long view, and he is not a reactionary like a lot of these folks are,\u201d said one person with years of experience in Biden\u2019s orbit. However, Biden has not reached out to Democratic Party leaders himself to reassure them or to get feedback, something that many sources told CNN they found astounding given the fallout from the debate. \u201cThey\u2019re equating this moment to every moment they\u2019ve overcome before, and not realizing it\u2019s a totally different moment,\u201d a Democratic operative close to the campaign said in reference to Biden and his inner circle. During a fundraiser in the Hamptons on Saturday, Biden used a teleprompter, something at least one donor mentioned as troubling. Meanwhile, first lady Jill Biden stuck to the Biden family mythology of resilience while introducing her husband. \u201cJoe\u2019s mom used to say that God never gives us a cross too heavy to carry,\u201d she said. \u201cJoe isn\u2019t just the right person for the job; he\u2019s the only person for the job. \u2026 Joe\u2019s mom was right, there isn\u2019t a cross he can\u2019t bear, that he won\u2019t shoulder for our country and our democracy.\u201d Delaware Sen. Chris Coons, the closest of Biden\u2019s political allies, told CNN he would like to see the president counter the narrative of being too old and incompetent for the job by doing more public events, town halls and interviews. Ahead of the announcement of the ABC interview, White House advisers said Monday that Biden was considering a high-profile interview in the coming days to help prove his fitness for office, in hopes of showing his energetic North Carolina rally the day after debate was not simply a fluke. Campaign aides are also mapping out a more robust travel schedule to battleground states in July. Many leading Democrats doubt that Biden is up to that \u2014 and they see his secluded schedule since Sunday as evidence they are correct. That schedule is keeping to Biden\u2019s general mode. Using one metric: Biden has held 36 news conferences since taking office, compared with Trump\u2019s 64 by this point in his presidency, Barack Obama\u2019s 72 at this point in his, and George W. Bush\u2019s 82 by this point in his. Trump has also been out of public view since a post-debate rally in Virginia on Friday and has no schedule for the rest of the week. Anchors for a local television station announced that he at the last minute canceled an interview after the rally after aides asked for the questions in advance. He is expected to spend much of the next few days in New Jersey golfing. Even for some of those who are staying committed to Biden, a sense has settled in that there is little chance he would be able to make it through the four years that another term would entail.\u00a0The debate performance has so shaken Democrats that even stalwarts like Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse told local reporters back home in Rhode Island on Monday that he wants a fuller accounting of the president\u2019s health. From the West Wing to Wilmington While the high command of the Biden campaign on Monday tried to \u201ckeep reassuring everybody and absorbing people\u2019s worries,\u201d one adviser said, there has been a growing appreciation for the anger and concern many Democrats have expressed. \u201cThe seriousness of this is felt by people in the West Wing and in Wilmington,\u201d a different adviser added. Several Biden advisers told CNN the campaign is still working to assess the true fallout of the debate among voters in key battleground states, with an eye on whether Biden has fallen in a head-to-head matchup with Trump or whether the field of swing states has expanded.\u00a0A range of engaged senior Democrats cite Minnesota and Virginia as important gauges, as well as the Senate race in Michigan. House Democrats are deep into their own polling, assessing how much damage has been done. As dark as the mood is among some aides \u2014 including those who feel the wind knocked out of them after years of internalizing a related Biden mythology that he always delivers in a crunch \u2014 others are hoping to prove wrong people who never believed in him. Responding to The New York Times Editorial Board on Friday calling for Biden to drop out, one Biden aide reached out to CNN to offer this: \u201cThat sh*t is like jet fuel in my veins I love it.\u201d The New York Times did not endorse Biden in the 2020 Democratic primaries. No clear fix The same small, insular inner circle that has guided Biden to this point is handling the fallout. Few familiar with how the members of that circle work believe it would be possible to force any of them out. Still, top aides at the Biden campaign and the Democratic National Committee have spent the days since the debate on a constant churn of calls. Several people involved say that many of those calls have started badly but ended at least somewhat better. And the Biden campaign on Tuesday announced that June was its best fundraising month ever, with $127 million banked \u2014 with almost a third of that raised since the debate. Biden campaign chair Jen O\u2019Malley Dillon on Monday evening told members of the campaign\u2019s National Finance Committee that the team is \u201cclear-eyed, not pollyannish,\u201d two participants on the call told CNN.\u00a0She did not telegraph anything about Biden\u2019s plans other than full steam ahead. But after several previous calls with donors boiled over, the campaign restricted that Zoom call so that the only way to pose questions was to put them in a moderated chat. \u201cEvery time Joe Biden is counted out, he proves his doubters wrong. I have faith he\u2019ll do it this time too,\u201d said Andrew Weinstein, a longtime Biden supporter and donor. Phil Murphy, the New Jersey governor who called Biden the \u201ccomeback kid\u201d at a fundraiser he hosted with the president on Saturday night, said that at their dinner table they had a wide-ranging, coherent conversation that covered, by his telling, Ukraine, the Middle East, wage growth, job creation, dealing more effectively with corporations, and expanding prekindergarten and community college. \u201cHis life story, almost every step of the way \u2014 including through tragedy \u2014 is the story of a guy who\u2019s been counted out and succeeds against all expectations and all odds,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cAnd he\u2019s in another one of those moments.\u201d This story has been updated with additional details.

They\u2019ve even survived five mass extinctions, including the asteroid that wiped out 75% of life on the planet. But many species of these aquatic apex predators are now in danger of dying out forever.  \u201cSharks are in crisis globally,\u201d says the WWF. Overfishing (hunting for their meat, fins, and other parts before they can reproduce fast enough) is their biggest threat along with unintentionally getting caught in fishing gear and the effects of climate change.  Of the thousand known species of sharks and rays (sharks\u2019 closest living relatives), over a third of them are at risk of extinction. And since sharks are \u201cindicators of ocean health,\u201d as sharks go, so does the delicate balance of marine ecosystems.  Shark research From gathering data to educating the public to advocating for underwater life, many conservation groups are on a mission to protect these prehistoric creatures before they are lost to history.  Research is key to conservation. Scientists rely on this information to inform wildlife and habitat management and conservation plans while advocates use data to develop and recommend policy to public officials. This research can also be used for public safety purposes as well as to educate future generations that will inherit the planet. Often conducted in remote and dangerous environments, shark research requires time and money. But that work is paying off as researchers continually identify new species of sharks, such as those that can walk on the ocean floor and glow in the dark. These research-oriented organizations are exploring the world\u2019s reefs, seas, coastlines, and oceans to ultimately benefit shark conservation:   Shark conservation  Unfortunately for sharks, NOAA says, \u201cWhat makes them unique also makes them vulnerable.\u201d Some species of sharks, like great whites, are slow to reproduce: they can take decades to reach breeding age, have pregnancies last up to three years, and produce small litters. And warming waters are shifting some of their migration patterns beyond protected areas, putting them at risk of fishing. All of it is hurting their numbers. A 2021 report showed over the last 50 years, global shark and ray populations have fallen more than 70%.  \u201cIf we don\u2019t do anything, it will be too late,\u201d says biologist and study co-author Nick Dulvy. \u201cIt\u2019s much worse than other animal populations we\u2019ve been looking at,\u201d adding the downward trend for sharks is even steeper than those for elephants and rhinos, which are \u201ciconic in driving conservation efforts on land.\u201d While the study found we may approach a \u201cpoint of no return,\u201d there are encouraging signs that conservation efforts are starting to work for white sharks and hammerheads thanks to government bans, policies, and quotas.  There is still a long way to go, however, so many conservation organizations like these are dedicated to rescuing and protecting these vulnerable creatures:  Protecting the ocean   It\u2019s not just sharks that are vulnerable to deteriorating conditions in the water \u2013 the entire marine ecosystem is at risk due to unsustainable fishing practices, climate change, and pollution, which has reached \u201cunprecedented\u201d levels within the last 20 years.  The Great Pacific Garbage Patch, the largest concentration of ocean plastic in the world, is now twice the size of Texas. Scientists are seeing the highest ocean surface temperatures on record this year along with a \u201ctotally unprecedented\u201d marine heat wave in the north Atlantic Ocean. Researchers warn all coral reefs on Earth could die out by the end of the century.  Experts say it\u2019s not too late to reverse course, but the window to do so is shrinking. A report in the journal Nature found marine wildlife to be \u201cremarkably resilient\u201d and could recover by 2050 with urgent and widespread conservation interventions.

The six-man and six-woman jury in the trial of Read, who is accused of drunkenly driving into her police officer boyfriend and leaving him to die in January 2022, informed the court shortly after midday, saying, \u201cDespite our exhaustive review of the evidence and our diligent consideration of all disputed evidence, we have been unable to reach unanimous verdict.\u201d After hearing arguments from the prosecution and defense, Norfolk County Superior Court Judge Beverly Cannone asked the jury to continue to deliberate. \u201cLunch will be arriving shortly; when it comes, I\u2019d ask you to clear your heads, have lunch and begin your deliberations again,\u201d Cannone told the jurors. After the judge\u2019s order, the jury continued deliberating until shortly after 4 p.m. local time. Deliberations will resume Monday morning at 9 a.m., the judge announced. The jury has been deliberating Read\u2019s fate since midday Tuesday. The case has featured accusations of a vast police cover-up as well as allegations of improper conduct and sexist text messages from a lead investigator. The prosecution and defense both weighed in on the jury\u2019s note, asking the judge to consider different outcomes in her decision on what to tell the jury. \u201cIt is far, far, far too early in their deliberative process to even consider giving them any kind of Tuey-Rodriguez instruction or anything close to that,\u201d Norfolk County Assistant District Attorney Adam Lally said, referring to a special set of Massachusetts instructions that are read to a jury when jurors are unable to agree on a verdict. \u201cThe note doesn\u2019t really indicate affirmatively that they can\u2019t come to a conclusion, it just says they haven\u2019t come to a conclusion through their deliberative process at this time.\u201d Alternately, defense attorney David Yannetti argued the jury should be read the Tuey-Rodriguez criminal model instructions, indicating that they would like the court to proceed toward having a hung jury. \u201cThe word exhaustive is the word I think that\u2019s operative here,\u201d he told the judge. \u201cThey are communicating to the court that they\u2019ve exhausted all manner of compromise, all manner of persuasion, and they\u2019re at an impasse.\u201d The judge said she weighed both counsel\u2019s views in deciding to send the jury back to deliberate a verdict in the controversial case. The Tuey-Rodriguez instructions were not read to the jury. Case law cautions against reading the instruction prematurely. Read, 45, pleaded not guilty to charges of second-degree murder, vehicular manslaughter while intoxicated and leaving the scene of a collision resulting in death. If found guilty of second-degree murder, Read faces a maximum sentence of life in prison, according to\u00a0Massachusetts law. The body of her boyfriend, Boston Police Officer John O\u2019Keefe, was found bruised and battered in the snow on January 29, 2022, outside the home of a fellow Boston police officer in Canton, Massachusetts. Prosecutors have alleged Read and O\u2019Keefe, who had an at-times tumultuous relationship, got into an argument that night, and that she drunkenly backed into him and fled the scene, leaving him to die in the cold. \u201cWhat the constellation of the facts and the evidence ineluctably demonstrate here is that the defendant drove her vehicle in reverse at 24.2 miles per hour for 62.5 feet, struck Mr. O\u2019Keefe, causing those catastrophic head injuries, leaving him incapacitated and freezing him to death,\u201d prosecutor Adam Lally said in closing arguments Tuesday. In contrast, Read\u2019s defense has accused off-duty police inside that Canton home of fatally beating O\u2019Keefe, dumping his body on the lawn and then conspiring through fabricated evidence and false testimony to frame Read. \u201cLadies and gentlemen, there was a cover-up in this case, plain and simple,\u201d defense attorney Alan Jackson said. \u201cYou\u2019ll surely say to yourself, \u2018I don\u2019t want to believe it, I don\u2019t want to believe that could happen in our community,\u2019 but sadly over these past eight weeks you\u2019ve seen it right before your eyes.\u201d The closing arguments represented the end of a murder trial that has garnered interest both local and widespread, including accusations of witness tampering, a federal probe into the investigation, and groups of pink-wearing supporters chanting to \u201cFree Karen Read.\u201d The prosecution\u2019s case also has been hampered by a series of missteps and unusual investigative practices. Most notably, a lead investigator in the case, Massachusetts State Police Trooper Michael Proctor, admitted that he sent a series of sexist and offensive texts about Read in a private group chat, calling her a \u201cwhack job,\u201d mocking her medical issues and commenting to coworkers that he had found \u201cno nudes\u201d while searching her phone for evidence, CNN affiliate WCVB reported. Proctor apologized for the \u201cunprofessional\u201d comments on the stand, but the vulgar texts have been sharply criticized in and out of court, including from the governor. \u201cIt\u2019s completely unprofessional,\u201d Gov. Maura Healey told WCVB of the texts. \u201cIt does harm, frankly, to the dignity and the integrity of the work of men and women across the state police and law enforcement. So as a former attorney general and as governor, I am disgusted by that.\u201d This story has been updated with additional information.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/28/us/karen-read-murder-trial-jury/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/03/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "us_national-education-association-antisemistism", "text": "Several items being proposed at an upcoming education convention in Philadelphia\u00a0are raising concerns among a pro-Israel advocacy group about potential antisemitism and anti-Israel bias. Delegates of the\u00a0National Education Association (NEA), the largest teachers\u2019 union in the United States,\u00a0will meet at\u00a0the Pennsylvania Convention Center in Philadelphia\u00a0for their annual representative assembly from July 3 to 7. Two rallies are planned for Wednesday outside the convention hall, one by the Educators for Palestine group \u2013 which is made up of NEA members - and a counter rally by StandWithUs, a non-profit pro-Israel advocacy organization. StandWithUs has characterized several proposed agenda items being discussed as antisemitic. Although\u00a0the proposed agenda items\u00a0are typically confidential before being voted on at the representative assembly, Educators for Palestine have outlined several in their call to vote yes. CNN has not seen the proposed agenda items. The NEA did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for information on the\u00a0agenda items in question. Both groups aim to raise awareness among NEA delegates about several\u00a0agenda items that\u00a0reportedly\u00a0call for the NEA to\u00a0align itself with the \u201cBoycott, Divestment, and Sanctions\u201d movement against Israel, distinguish between antisemitism and anti-Zionism, and educate members about the Nakba, a term referring to the mass displacement of Palestinians during the 1948 Arab-Israeli war, according to information from both Educators for Palestine and StandWithUs. The past year has seen heightened tension in classrooms across the country, including incidents of antisemitism and anti-Palestinian hate, especially following an attack by Hamas on Israel in October. \u201cAs the largest teachers union in the United States, the NEA has a significant influence on educational policies and practices. Before and especially after the atrocities of October 7th, a number of local and state NEA union affiliates have been embroiled in major controversies regarding antisemitism and anti-Israel bias. In some cases, this has resulted in Jewish families moving their children to different school districts with a less hostile learning environment,\u201d a\u00a0release\u00a0from StandWithUs said. \u201cThe NEA must ensure a safe and inclusive environment for all educators and students, and maintain public trust in what is being taught in our classrooms. Passing antisemitic and anti-Israel resolutions would not only harm Jewish members, but also undermine the integrity of public education,\u201d David Smokler, director of K-12 educator outreach at StandWithUs, added. On the other hand, Educators for Palestine urge NEA delegates to vote yes on the agenda items, stating, \u201cAs educators, we must be open to educating each other, and learning from one another. We stand in solidarity with working class people around the world. Help us fight for a liberated Palestine, and a liberated people!\u201d A NEA spokesperson told CNN regarding the planned rallies, \u201cThe members of the\u00a0National Education Association\u00a0and delegates to its annual Representative Assembly are committed to educating and nurturing understanding in their students of every race, faith, and background.\u201d \u201cNEA has a deep history that is steeped in civil rights and advocating for racial and social justice. Over many decades, the delegates of the\u00a0NEA Representative Assembly\u00a0have adopted resolutions expressing our union\u2019s condemnation of war, terrorism, hate, and violence. The vast majority of NEA delegates, members, and our society want to see a peaceful and lasting solution to this conflict,\u201d their statement added.

{"id": "2024_07_02_economy_us-jolts-job-openings-layoffs-may", "text": "The number of available jobs in the US unexpectedly grew in May, signaling continued resilience in the nation\u2019s labor market. Job openings jumped higher to 8.14 million in May, from a downwardly revised 7.91 million in April, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 latest Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) report released Tuesday. Economists had expected openings would fall to 7.91 million, according to FactSet consensus estimates. Despite the uptick in job postings, which can be quite volatile, May\u2019s JOLTS report marked a significant milestone for the US labor market: The ratio of job openings to those who are unemployed fell to 1.22 available jobs per job seeker, matching the figure seen in February 2020, a month prior to the pandemic lockdowns that shocked the global economy. That ratio has been steadily moving lower since hitting a record 2.0 in March 2022, JOLTS data shows. \u201cThe report was another sign that the labor market is holding firm,\u201d Robert Frick, corporate economist with Navy Federal Credit Union, said in a statement issued Tuesday. \u201cSo far there are no indications that job growth will flag this year, so consumer spending power will continue to increase and the expansion looks solid.\u201d Industries seeing the biggest increase in openings included manufacturing (specifically durable goods) and government (federal, state and local). Those seeing the greatest pullback from April included real estate and leisure and hospitality, BLS data shows. Pendulum swings away from workers Other seasonally adjusted measures of labor turnover showed continued stability in the US jobs market, which has gradually cooled in recent months while remaining historically strong. The estimated number of hires moved up to 5.76 million from 5.62 million in April; layoffs and separations bounced higher to 1.65 million in May, up from 1.54 million; while the number of voluntary quits inched upward to 3.46 million from 3.45 million. While both hires and job openings rates (as a percentage of total employment) ticked higher for May, the quits rate and layoffs rate were unchanged. Economists have been closely watching the quits rate \u2014 which has held steady at 2.2% for seven months running \u2014 as it serves as a signal for workers\u2019 willingness to test the labor market\u2019s waters. When people switch jobs, that typically can correlate to bigger pay bumps, which in turn potentially could make it more difficult to rein in inflation. Job-switchers\u2019 pay raises have pared down significantly from the \u201cGreat Resignation\u201d period, according to a newly released analysis from Bank of America. Economists there analyzed internal customer data and found that median wage hikes are about half the size they were during the height of pandemic-era job changes. In fact, the median pay raises are just below 2019 levels, David Tinsley, senior economist at the Bank of America Institute, told CNN. \u201cPeople are still moving between jobs at a slightly faster rate than they were pre-pandemic \u2026 but the pay raises they\u2019re getting when they make those moves is a degree softer,\u201d he said. \u201cThat sort of suggests that the pendulum has swung slightly more in favor of firms and away from workers.\u201d Labor market steady or a turning point? The labor market appears to be at a crossroads, Nick Bunker, Indeed Hiring Lab\u2019s head of economic research, wrote in commentary posted Tuesday. \u201cThe words \u2018little changed\u2019 were repeated no fewer than a half dozen times in the May JOLTS release, and virtually every key indicator tracked showed limited notable movement, either up or down,\u201d Bunker wrote. \u201cThis short-run stability is a good thing. But the question remains if this period of calm can continue or if more unsteady times are on the horizon.\u201d \u201cThis current level of job openings is consistent with a healthy, sustainable and balanced market, but any continued declines below these current levels will quickly become more worrisome,\u201d he wrote. It may take an interest rate cut to ensure employers\u2019 demand for workers doesn\u2019t tumble too far, he added. Federal Reserve officials still broadly believe the job market remains on solid footing, which is allowing central banker to comfortably keep interest rates perched at a 23-year high as they await more evidence that inflation is under control. But some Fed officials have noted that the job market has lost momentum recently and that it\u2019s highly unclear whether it will continue to hold steady or weaken further. \u201cIf employment starts falling apart or if the\u00a0economy\u00a0begins to weaken, which you\u2019ve seen some warning signs, you\u2019ve got to balance that off with the progress you\u2019re making on the price front,\u201d Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee told Bloomberg TV on Tuesday during a conference hosted by the European Central Bank in Sintra, Portugal. \u201cThe unemployment rate is still quite low, but it has been rising,\u201d he said. More jobs data coming Friday In May, the US unemployment rate increased to 4%, a rate that hadn\u2019t been seen since January 2022. Still, job growth remained strong in May, coming in at an estimated net gain of 272,000. Economists largely expect that job gains cooled off in June. As of Tuesday, FactSet consensus estimates are for a 189,000 net gain.  First-time claims for unemployment benefits (considered a proxy for layoffs) have drifted higher in recent weeks, landing in line with pre-pandemic averages. \u201cThey\u2019re still low, historically speaking, but they are up between the May and June payroll survey reference months, so we do think we could see some slowdown in job growth over the month,\u201d Marisa DiNatale, head labor economist for Moody\u2019s Analytics, told CNN in an interview. The Bureau of Labor Statistics will release the latest jobs report at 8:30 a.m. ET on Friday.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/02/economy/us-jolts-job-openings-layoffs-may/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/03/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_07_01_us_jeffrey-epstein-grand-jury", "text": "Fort Lauderdale, Florida (AP) \u2014 Florida prosecutors heard graphic testimony about how the late millionaire and financier\u00a0Jeffrey Epstein\u00a0sexually assaulted teenage girls two years before they cut a plea deal, according to transcripts released Monday of the 2006 grand jury investigation. The transcripts were at the center of a court battle for about a decade after media investigations into Epstein\u2019s ties to the rich and the powerful seems to have allowed him to continue to rape and sex traffic teenagers without ever being sent to prison or serving a serious jail term. The judge\u2019s release of the approximately 150 pages came as a surprise as he had scheduled a hearing for next week on when and how to release them. Gov. Ron DeSantis had signed a bill in February allowing the release on Monday or any time thereafter that Circuit Judge Luis Delgado ordered. The transcripts show that the grand jury heard testimony that Epstein, who was then in his 40s, had raped teenage girls as young as 14 at his Palm Beach mansion. The teenagers testified and told detectives they were also paid to find him more girls. \u201cThe details in the record will be outrageous to decent people,\u201d Delgado wrote in his order. \u201cThe testimony taken by the Grand Jury concerns activity ranging from grossly unacceptable to rape \u2014 all of the conduct at issue is sexually deviant, disgusting, and criminal.\u201d After the grand jury investigation, Epstein cut a deal with South Florida federal prosecutors in 2008 that allowed him to escape more severe federal charges and instead plead guilty to state charges of procuring a person under 18 for prostitution and solicitation of prostitution. It\u2019s long been criticized as too lenient. He was sentenced to one and a half years in the Palm Beach County jail system, followed by a year of house arrest. He was required to register as a sex offender. That deal has been widely criticized as too lenient. According to the transcripts, Palm Beach Police Det. Joe Recarey testified in July 2006 that the initial investigation began when a woman reported in March 2005 that her stepdaughter who was in high school at the time said she received $300 in exchange for \u201csexual activity with a man in Palm Beach,\u201d Recarey testified. Another teenager, whose name was redacted in the transcript, told detectives that she was 17 years old when she was approached by a friend who said she could make $200 by providing a massage at Epstein\u2019s home. At the house, the teen was led to a room by an Epstein assistant, and a short time later, Epstein entered and demanded that she remove her clothes. She complied and started the massage. When Epstein tried touching her, she told him she was uncomfortable. Epstein then told her that he would pay her if she brought other \u201cgirls\u201d to his home. She agreed to do so, according to the October 2005 interview with detectives recounted by Recarey. \u201cAnd he told her, \u2018The younger, the better,\u2019\u201d Recarey said. When she brought over a 23-year-old friend, Epstein told her that the friend was too old. Over time, the teen brought six friends from her high school over to Epstein\u2019s home, including a 14-year-old girl, the detective said. The teen, who likened herself to Hollywood Madame Heidi Fleiss to detectives, explained that the girls understood what they were getting into. She received $200 every time she brought over a friend and a rental car paid by Epstein. \u201cThe more you did, the more money you made,\u201d the detective said the teen told him. \u201cShe explained that there was going to be a massage or some possible touching, and you would have to provide the massage either topless or naked.\u201d Epstein in 2018 was charged with federal sex trafficking\u00a0crimes in New York\u00a0\u2014 where he also had a mansion that was a scene of abuse \u2014 after the Miami Herald published a series of articles that renewed public attention on the case, including interviews with some victims who had been pursuing civil lawsuits against him.\u00a0Epstein\u00a0was 66 when\u00a0he killed himself\u00a0in a New York City jail cell in August 2019, federal officials say. Delgado in his order called Epstein \u201cthe most infamous pedophile in American history.\u201d \u201cFor almost 20 years, the story of how Jeffrey Epstein victimized some of Palm Beach County\u2019s most vulnerable has been the subject of much anger and has at times diminished the public\u2019s perception of the criminal justice system,\u201d Delgado wrote. \u201cEpstein is indeed notorious and infamous and is widely reported to have flaunted his wealth while cavorting with politicians, billionaires, and even British Royalty,\u201d he continued. \u201cIt is understandable that given those reports the public has a great curiosity about what was widely reported by news (agencies) as \u2018special treatment\u2019 regarding his prosecution.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/01/us/jeffrey-epstein-grand-jury/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/03/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_30_us_missouri-prison-guards-othel-moore-death", "text": "Five former corrections officers are facing\u00a0a combination of assault, manslaughter and murder charges\u00a0over the December 8 death of Othel Moore Jr., a former inmate at a maximum security prison in Jefferson City, Missouri,\u00a0according to newly released indictments. The officers were part of a Corrections Emergency Response Team (CERT), which are specially trained units designed to deal with violent prison situations, at the Jefferson City Correctional Center. A former inmate at the correctional center tells CNN he witnessed\u00a0officers create\u00a0the violent circumstances that killed the 39-year-old Moore, whose 2023 death forms part of an especially deadly year in Missouri prisons. \u201cI never watched anybody die before,\u201d Jordan Seller, 27, told CNN, as he explained the events leading to Moore\u2019s death began with what was supposed to be a routine search of the cells on the maximum-security prison block he shared with Moore. \u201cThey come in like a hundred deep, you know, and that\u2019s barely an exaggeration, you know, they try to come in and pull everybody out as fast as they can, search cells fast as they can and get out,\u201d Seller said. He and his cellmate had already been pulled out and put back in their cell when they noticed the commotion building around Moore\u2019s cell, Seller says. \u201cThe cell was surrounded by CO\u2019s,\u201d or corrections officers, Seller said and that Moore was pleading with them he had a medical lay-in and needed to be put in two pairs of handcuffs, essentially latched together with the outside rings on the wrist to ease tension on the shoulders being pulled back. Seller said they\u2019re commonly used for bigger inmates or those who may have trouble putting their hands behind their backs. Seller says the correctional officers refused to listen to Moore and began treating him as if he was non-compliant. The officers proceeded to pepper spray Moore, slam him to the ground and force him into a single pair of handcuffs, he says. \u201cHe can\u2019t see. He\u2019s spitting out mace, he\u2019s coughing, he can\u2019t breathe and he\u2019s telling them \u2018I\u2019m allergic to mace, you need to hurry up and get medical here,\u2019\u201d Seller said. Seller says he was looking up at the commotion from his cell on the lower floor of the prison block before Moore was brought down the stairs closer to him in a \u201creal aggressive\u201d manner. The correctional officers placed Moore\u00a0in \u201csome kind of chair-like contraption,\u201d according to Seller,\u00a0which the county prosecuting attorney has said was a restraint chair, sometimes used in corrections facilities. Seller says the prison guards began to place a spit mask on Moore, but Seller maintained he was only spitting out mace. \u201cOf course, he\u2019s refusing this because there\u2019s no reason for them to put a spit mask on,\u201d said Seller, who also says he witnessed this a few feet from his cell door. \u201cHe don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on. He can\u2019t see, you know, so they\u2019re grabbing on him trying to put something on his head. He\u2019s fighting it. Well, then they started shocking him with the shock glove.\u201d Seller then recounted what he believes were Moore\u2019s final moments, when the officers pulled out what appeared to be \u201can all-black motorcycle helmet, you know, darkened mask, all that,\u201d and put it on Moore\u2019s head. \u201cImmediately he\u2019s jumping, hopping, and you can hear him screaming, you know, \u2018Help! I can\u2019t breathe. I can\u2019t breathe, take it off. I can\u2019t breathe. I\u2019m, I\u2019m allergic to mace. I need help.\u2019 And then it gets worse and worse,\u201d Seller said. \u201cHe\u2019s jumping up and down shaking. And, you know, slowly, his screams are getting weaker and weaker,\u201d Seller said. \u201cI believe I watched him die before they even took him out the wing,\u201d he said. \u201cI watched the people that are supposed to be protecting me, kill somebody, literally killed them, you know? And that brought on such a fear, you know? The realization that these people can kill me and there\u2019s nothing I can do about it,\u201d said Seller. Moore was declared dead that day. What the indictment says When the arrests were made Friday, Cole County Prosecuting Attorney Locke Thompson largely corroborated to CNN Seller\u2019s eyewitness account of what happened to Moore, including the use of a \u201cspit mask and padded helmet.\u201d During a contraband sweep of the prison, Moore \u201cwas pepper sprayed twice during the operation before being placed in a spit hood, leg wrap, and restraint chair and transferred to a separate housing unit, where he was left in the hood, wrap, and restraint chair for approximately thirty minutes,\u201d the prosecutor said in a statement. \u201cMultiple witnesses heard Moore pleading with the corrections staff and telling them that he could not breathe\u201d before he was transferred to the prison hospital wing and pronounced dead, Thompson said. A statement of probable cause against the charged officers describing the incident said Moore \u201cshowed no aggression to any members of the CERT team during this process and was on video being compliant,\u201d and that Moore \u201cmade no threats to anyone.\u201d The use of a \u201cshock glove\u201d on Moore, as Seller described to CNN, was not mentioned by the prosecutor. Former corrections officers Justin Leggins, Jacob Case, Aaron Brown, Gregory Varner and Bryanne Bradshaw were all charged in this case. Leggins and Case were charged with second-degree murder and second-degree assault, in part for \u201crecklessly\u201d causing physical injury to Moore by pepper-spraying him in the face, according to court documents. Brown was charged with second-degree murder, and assault in the second degree, for \u201crecklessly\u201d causing serious physical injury to Moore by \u201cplacing a mask\u201d over Moore\u2019s face, which \u201cinhibited\u201d his ability to breathe, according to a joint felony complaint against the officers. Varner was charged with second-degree murder and assault in the second degree for \u201crecklessly\u201d causing \u201cserious physical injury\u201d to Moore by leaving him \u201cin a position which caused his asphyxiation,\u201d the complaint said. Bradshaw was charged with involuntary manslaughter in the second degree and is accused of negligently causing Moore\u2019s death by leaving him in a position that caused \u201casphyxiation,\u201d the complaint alleges. CNN has attempted to identify attorneys for each of the former officers arrested but has not been able to make contact. Leggins, Case and Brown had their charges read to them during arraignments in court Monday, Thompson told CNN. A judge refused to allow bond for those three defendants, The Associated Press reported Monday. Varner is scheduled to be arraigned Wednesday, Thompson told CNN. Bradshaw has been released from jail after paying bond, and has a court hearing scheduled for the end of July, Thompson told CNN on Monday. In response to the murder charges, the Missouri Department of Corrections said in a statement it \u201chas discontinued use of the restraint system in which Moore was held.\u201d Additionally, the statement said the department has begun using body-worn cameras in maximum-security prisons, starting with Jefferson City Correctional Center, to \u201cbolster both security and accountability.\u201d It also said 10 people involved in the incident have been terminated following internal and independent law enforcement investigations, including the five officers charged. The corrections department previously confirmed that the warden of the prison at the time of Moore\u2019s killing, Doris Falkenrath, was no longer with the department. Falkenrath was not among those arrested and not listed on the indictments filed Friday. Following the indictment, Othel Moore\u2019s family filed a federal civil lawsuit against the officers, the prison warden at the time of the killing and the previous director of the Missouri Department of Corrections, alleging, in part, that Moore is dead \u201cbecause of the actions, inactions, conscious disregard, willful and wanton, and depraved behavior\u201d of the then corrections officers. The suit also alleges the \u201cattack\u201d was not an isolated incident but the \u201cmanifestation of a barbarous pattern and practice, fostered by the highest-ranking members of the Missouri Department of Corrections.\u201d A spokesperson for the Missouri Department of Corrections told CNN the department won\u2019t comment on pending litigation. Attorneys Andrew M. Stroth and Steven Hart are among those representing Moore\u2019s family. In remarks to the press Friday following the announcement of the charges, Stroth said, \u201cThese charges are historic. These charges are unprecedented. When you hear about what happened, witnesses saw what happened, video evidence shows what happened. It\u2019s George Floyd 3.0 in a prison. Othel Moore, like George Floyd, was beaten. Othel was actually pepper sprayed, they put a spit mask on his face, they put him in the prone position face down. They shocked him with shock gloves. The entire time before his death was screaming. \u2018I can\u2019t breathe.\u2019\u201d Stroth told CNN: \u201cI\u2019ve reviewed hundreds of police cases, prison cases, this is one of the most egregious cases I have ever seen.\u201d \u2018We want transparency and accountability\u2019 It\u2019s also part of a worsening trend in the Missouri prison system. From 2012 to 2019, the average number of deaths, which includes natural deaths, hovered around 99 per year, according to state data obtained by CNN through a Missouri Sunshine Law request. From 2020 to 2023, the average number of deaths then climbed to 128 per year, a near 30 percent jump. There were fewer people incarcerated in Missouri in 2023 than at any time since at least 2012, according to state data. However, it was the prison system\u2019s deadliest year over that time period. Last year saw 137 prison deaths, with Othel Moore among them. Lori Curry, founder and executive director of the non-profit advocacy group Missouri Prison Reform, told CNN her group is regularly in touch with around 900 inmates, or \u201cresidents of prisons,\u201d as Curry described them, to use more humanizing language. Her organization also tracks deaths reported in prisons and based on the data they provided to CNN, \u201cwhat (the state) refer to as natural deaths\u201d was the most frequent listing as manner of death in their numbers over 2022 and 2023. However, Curry cast doubt on the state listings and attributes the rise in the number of deaths in recent years to \u201cdeclining healthcare, an increase in drugs and overdoses, and an increase of staffing shortages,\u201d she told CNN. She said her advocacy group quickly learned about the disturbing circumstances around Moore\u2019s killing. \u201cPeople in prisons notified us about the situation immediately,\u201d Curry said. She also believes\u00a0\u201cthe Department of Corrections needs to be more forthcoming\u201d about the information around this and that if lawyers, family and others were not so vocal about the case it would not have stayed in the spotlight. Curry founded Missouri Prison Reform in 2019 after launching an anonymous Twitter account where she reported stories relayed to her by inmates. Many years and many stories later, \u201cI\u2019ve been appalled at the things that have gone on in [Missouri] prisons,\u201d she told CNN. \u201cWe want transparency and accountability from our department of corrections,\u201d she added. Seller, who has seen the dynamic between guards and inmates up close, says he wants the same thing. \u201cI see police officers out here wearing body cameras all the time, you know, and it\u2019s required for their stops, arrests, all that. And I believe that\u2019s the only solution for the way that inmates are getting treated is that the CO\u2019s are required to wear body cameras,\u201d Seller told CNN. \u201cYou can\u2019t trust the people that are supposed to protect you,\u201d he said. \u201cThis has become such a big pandemic. I mean, I\u2019m calling it a pandemic, you know, and it\u2019s severe and it\u2019s a big problem.\u201d Seller was serving a six-year sentence after pleading guilty to second-degree rape in 2018, according to court records. State registry records also show the victim in that case was a minor. Seller did his time at a few prisons before being released from the Jefferson City Correctional Center in March. \u201cI did a lot of good for myself in there, a lot of soul searching,\u201d Seller said. He told CNN his reason for coming forward was simple: \u201cIt\u2019s something that\u2019s wrong, that needs to be addressed. Something needs to change,\u201d he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/30/us/missouri-prison-guards-othel-moore-death/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/03/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_07_02_media_biden-mental-fitness", "text": "President Joe Biden\u2019s White House repeatedly and aggressively shot down reports\u00a0on\u00a0the president\u2019s age and any possible limitations\u00a0on his ability to perform all the duties of his office. But after his shaky debate performance last week, in which Biden routinely struggled to\u00a0get his point across, some in the White House press corps say they wish they had pushed harder to tell the story. In June, when the Wall Street Journal published a\u00a0lengthy piece\u00a0on President Joe Biden\u2019s mental\u00a0state, the newspaper\u00a0got\u00a0slammed.\u00a0The White House, its allies, and\u00a0some in the media\u00a0\u2013\u00a0including CNN\u2019s Reliable Sources\u00a0\u2013\u00a0criticized the Journal for quoting mostly Republican political foes on the record, who had a clear political motive to damage Biden\u2019s image. No Democrats were quoted on the record making those allegations, and several Democrats complained their on-the-record quotes praising Biden\u2019s sharpness were not included. The\u00a0Journal defended its reporting at the time. Last week\u2019s debate on CNN laid bare many of the concerns the Journal\u2019s reporting had raised \u2013 that the president has good days and bad days but can sometimes seem to slip up. A New York Times report on Tuesday raised similar concerns by those who have recently been in the room with Biden. The Times reported Biden has more frequent \u201clapses,\u201d although at other times he appears sharp. After Biden\u2019s lackluster performance last week, some are questioning whether the White House press corps dropped the ball on fully covering Biden\u2019s limitations. Biden\u2019s\u00a0age issue is not secret or new. Nearly every media outlet has reported on\u00a0growing concerns about\u00a0Biden\u2019s age well before the debate. The White House in the past has complained that the coverage is disproportionate, and that the media is spending more time covering Biden\u2019s age than his accomplishments as president versus former President Donald Trump\u2019s lies. The media has faced accusations that it has not covered Biden\u2019s mental fitness more aggressively because it wants to prop up the campaign in some way \u2013 an accusation the White House reporters CNN spoke to denied. Several White House reporters\u00a0told CNN that\u00a0the\u00a0coverage\u00a0of Biden\u2019s age and his mental stamina\u00a0should have\u00a0pushed harder. They cited several difficulties in doing so before the debate \u2013 from the obvious political motivations of sources who either want to protect Biden\u2019s image or project a certain image, to the blowback from pursuing such reports, especially from the White House and Democrats. A difficult task Like all past presidents, Biden has good days and bad days. It\u00a0can be tricky to report on something as difficult to define as a person aging, when his opponent\u00a0is a convicted felon, who regularly lies and has threatened to use the government to go after his political opponents. Still, some reporters said the press corps\u00a0could\u00a0have done a better job\u00a0covering\u00a0Biden\u2019s physical and mental state. The failure of the media, one White House reporter said,\u00a0was\u00a0not\u00a0pushing more aggressively\u00a0into Biden\u2019s abilities after the release of the Robert Hurr report in February, which called Biden a \u201cwell-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.\u201d Biden\u2019s age was also a right-wing talking point for years, something the White House was quick to point out to reporters,\u00a0which\u00a0may have inadvertently turned off any serious investigation. For example, deceptively edited clips of Biden from the G7 spread widely by right-wing media figures were made to seem as though he was aimlessly \u201cwandering off\u201d from fellow world leaders when really, he was speaking to parachutists who had just landed during a demonstration. \u201cThe right-wing media was calling him senile from day one, and that wasn\u2019t true,\u201d the reporter said. \u201cThen whenever you report on the age you were in some ways solidifying, giving credence to some people that were actually of bad faith.\u201d All the White House reporters who spoke to CNN for this piece chose to speak anonymously so they could speak more freely about their relationship with the White House. Keeping the president at a distance Reporters said the White House has not made the press corps\u2019 job easy:\u00a0The White House has put up guardrails around Biden, they say, and\u00a0he does not engage in as many interviews or planned press conferences\u00a0as previous presidents. At those events,\u00a0the press might be able to gauge how he\u2019s doing on the spot, without prepared remarks. \u201cThey keep him at arm\u2019s length, and he rarely does extended interviews,\u201d the reporter said of the White House,\u00a0although he acknowledged Biden has started giving more interviews as of late. Biden has done fewer interviews and formal press conferences than his most recent predecessors, according to data compiled by\u00a0Martha Joynt Kumar,\u00a0professor emerita of political science at Towson University who chronicles the presidents\u2019 interactions with the press. But on quick and informal interactions with the press, like shouted questions on the way to his helicopter or plane, Biden\u00a0as of this week has had 588 interactions, Kumar reports, second only to Trump when compared to recent presidents. But those interactions are not the same as an extended press conference, reporters noted. On Tuesday, ABC News announced Biden would sit down with George Stephanopoulos for an interview, his first since the debate. The White House press shop has also been very \u201caggressive\u201d and \u201cfairly successful\u201d in mitigating coverage of concerns over the president\u2019s age,\u00a0said\u00a0another White House reporter who works for a different publication. \u201c[B]erating reporters who bring them reporting about age concerns, bemoaning that it\u2019s all anyone writes about (clearly, it\u2019s not) and often attacking pieces after they run,\u201d the reporter told CNN. \u201cI think that\u2019s left some folks to conclude that these stories are too painful to report or that they should pick their spots more. It\u2019s clear the age stories that have angered the White House (and the liberal Twittersphere) the most.\u201d Alex Thompson, a White House reporter for Axios, said on CNN the day after the debate that \u201cthe White House\u2019s response every single time\u00a0it\u00a0has come up for three-and-a-half years has been to deflect, to gaslight, to not tell the truth \u2013 not just to reporters, not just to other Democrats, but even at times to themselves about the president\u2019s limitations at his age.\u201d Still, this White House\u2019s recent conduct with reporters pales in comparison to Trump\u2019s team, which has done everything from revoking press access to reporters they disagree with, to calling reporters the \u201cenemy of the people.\u201d The White House declined to comment. Aging doesn\u2019t happen all at once Aging is also not a sudden moment.\u00a0That makes it trickier to report on. \u201cTo some extent, the decline has appeared to be gradual \u2014 hard to notice from day to day \u2014 and that\u2019s perhaps made it harder for reporters to determine when is the right moment to write something,\u201d one of the reporters said. Just a few days before the debate, Biden held a press conference at the G7 alongside Ukrainian President Vlodomyr Zelensky that passed off without anything of note in Biden\u2019s demeanor. But reporters pointed out (and have published stories noting) that the president has been using teleprompters at most big events, even fundraisers where in the past he might not have. He has also started to use the lower stairs to board Air Force One. Last year, The New York Times published a lengthy piece on the \u201ccomplicated reality of America\u2019s oldest president,\u201d which looked at some of those accommodations and concerns for his age, but also the moments where he showed stamina and vigor. Some reporters said that there has been a distinct change\u00a0within the last year, and that the press corps should have reported more aggressively on the accommodations made for the president. \u201cI think the press, most of the White House press, did suffer from a bit of lack of curiosity,\u201d one of the reporters said. Look who you\u2019re up against Biden\u2019s allies will often question coverage of the president\u2019s age, questioning why reporters focus on the president\u2019s age and mental lucidity and not on Trump\u2019s\u00a0\u2013\u00a0who, at 78,\u00a0was observed falling asleep during his hush money trial, has made his own major verbal flubs and bizarre statements, and regularly spouts complete falsehoods. \u201cIt makes sense to reflect on this now and ask whether we missed or, really, under-reported the story of Biden\u2019s age and decline. But it\u2019s complicated,\u201d one of the reporters said. \u201cThe fact that the political alternative to Biden is an authoritarian who sparked an insurrection and is a convicted felon does not mean that the press is failing American democracy to focus on Biden\u2019s obvious frailty.\u201d One of the reporters said the media can, and do, report on both. Biden\u2019s allies, however, say too much attention is placed on Biden\u2019s age and not on the threat Trump could pose to American democracy. But the reporters say they can, and should, do both. \u201cJust because you are reporting on Biden age, doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re not reporting on Trump\u2019s lies.\u00a0 I find that argument silly, and it seems one design towards like producing a certain outcome in the election, rather than like an honest reporting,\u201d one of the reporters said. The outlets that had received harsh blowback for their previous reports on Biden\u2019s lucidity now feel justified. A source familiar with the staff behind the Wall Street Journal\u2019s report said that when the piece first published, the reporters were approached by people with sympathy asking how they\u2019re doing \u201cas if something terrible had just happened,\u201d the source said. After the debate, the reporters started to get messages saying they were right.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/02/media/biden-mental-fitness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/03/2024", "section": "us"}}

{"id": "2024_07_01_us_maine-released-inmate-shootings", "text": "West Bath, Maine (AP) \u2014 A man who\u00a0confessed to killing his parents\u00a0and two of their friends and wounding three people in a highway shooting pleaded guilty to murder and other charges on Monday, and a judge sentenced him to the maximum term of life in prison. Joseph Eaton never provided a reason to law enforcement officials for the violent crimes he admitted committing in Maine last year, and he had no explanation for the victims\u2019 families and friends who spoke in court. Through written testimony read aloud, a woman described the horrific scene of blood and broken glass that confronted her in April 2023 when she found the crime scene where Eaton confessed to the fatal shootings. In a similar written statement, the father of one of\u00a0three people wounded\u00a0by bullets that Eaton fired on a highway spoke of his terror that day that his daughter would bleed out in his arms. She ultimately survived. A shooting survivor spoke of discovering 13 bullet holes in her car. Others said they experienced sleepless nights and nightmares as a result of Eaton\u2019s actions. \u201cHe killed the only four people in this world who actually loved and cared for him,\u201d said a distraught Kristina DeRaps, who is married to a nephew of one of the victims, Patti Eger. DeRaps called Eaton \u201ca selfish little boy.\u201d Eaton looked down at the defense table during much of the testimony. When he spoke, he said he was still in disbelief over his actions. \u201cI wake up every day regretting what I did,\u201d he said. Of his life sentence, he added, \u201cI honestly think I deserve worse. All I can say is, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d Law enforcement officials say Eaton, now 35, confessed to fatally shooting his parents, Eger and Eger\u2019s husband at the Egers\u2019 home in the rural town of Bowdoin. He also confessed to shooting at vehicles on Interstate 295 in Yarmouth. The crimes took place days after Eaton was released from a Maine prison for unrelated crimes. He has been\u00a0in jail since his latest arrest. Killed were David Eaton, 66; Eger and Cynthia Eaton, both 62; and Robert Eger, 72. Cynthia Eaton had picked her son up on April 14, when he was released from prison. Also killed was the Egers\u2019 dog, which led authorities to add animal cruelty to the list of charges against Joseph Eaton. Authorities believe Eaton delivered the fatal shots on April 17, 2023. The victims\u2019 bodies were found the following morning, on the same day authorities say he fired at cars on I-295 in Yarmouth, about 12 miles outside of Portland, Maine\u2019s biggest city. Eaton faced separate indictments because the attacks at the Bowdoin home and on the highway happened in different counties. At the time, Maine Public Safety Commissioner Michael Sauschuck called the shootings \u201can attack on the soul of our state.\u201d Months later, an Army reservist who lived in Bowdoin killed 18 people at two locations in the city of Lewiston, in what would become the state\u2019s deadliest mass shooting. An unsigned note found at the scene of the killings mentioned \u201csomeone being freed of pain and that the writer of the note wanted a new life,\u201d according to a criminal affidavit. Eaton told the Portland Press Herald newspaper in jailhouse interviews that he was not in control of his actions at the time of the shootings and didn\u2019t understand why he did it. All told, Eaton pleaded guilty on Monday to more than a dozen charges, including four counts of murder and aggravated attempted murder. He received the maximum penalty for each of them. Defense lawyer Andrew Wright said Eaton chose to plead guilty to take responsibility for his actions, believing it was the \u201creasonable and moral\u201d thing to do to bring the case to a conclusion. Outside the courthouse, Wright said he struggles to make sense of Eaton, who despite committing such violent crimes also struck him during their one-on-one interactions as \u201ca kind and compassionate and emotional and empathetic\u201d man. \u201cIt\u2019s a senseless act, that makes no sense to anyone involved,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a tragedy.\u201d Authorities say Eaton also has a criminal history in Florida and Kansas.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/01/us/maine-released-inmate-shootings/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/03/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_28_us_arizona-boulder-view-fire-maricopa-county", "text": "Residents in Maricopa County, Arizona, are able to return home Sunday after evacuation orders in areas impacted by the ongoing Boulder View Fire in the Sonoran Desert were downgraded \u2013 though some should continue to stay vigilant,\u00a0according to state fire officials. The Boulder View Fire, which ignited Thursday east of Carefree in Arizona\u2019s most populous county has burned through more than 3,700 acres and was 63% contained as of Sunday evening, according to an update on InciWeb on Sunday. \u201cContainment increased on the east side of the fire after it reached the Wildcat Fire-burned area and stopped spreading,\u201d according to InciWeb\u2019s Sunday update. The now fully contained Wildcat Fire started in May and scorched more than 14,000 acres.  Crews will continue structure protection efforts on Sunday and focus on \u201cimproving firelines\u201d around the Boulder View Fire, the update stated. In the meantime, fire officials announced they had lifted evacuation status in the affected area, though residents need to remain aware of dangerous conditions according to the state\u2019s \u201cReady, Set, Go!\u201d program. \u201cAreas in GO evacuate status were downgraded to SET while areas in SET status were returned to READY status on Saturday afternoon at 5 p.m.,\u201d the update Sunday said, referring to the three levels of preparedness used to guide residents ahead of and during evacuations. The \u201cReady\u201d status signifies being prepared and aware of hazards, while \u201cset\u201d encourages residents to be alert about significant danger in their area and to consider voluntarily evacuating. \u201cGo\u201d urges people to evacuate from imminent and life-threatening danger, according to the Arizona Emergency Information Network. An evacuation order went into effect Thursday night for residents along the southeast side of the fire, the Arizona Department of Forestry and Fire Management said in\u00a0a social media post. The department said at least 60 homes were evacuated Thursday. About 4.5 million people live in the county. \u201cIt definitely puts a little bit of a panic into your mind right away,\u201d a Scottsdale woman told CNN affiliate KPNX. \u201cWe made a plan. We have had a plan. We have lots of friends in the area that have trucks and trailers ready to go when we are.\u201d The woman, along with another resident, safely evacuated to another property in north Scottsdale where they have mares, pigs, goats and cats. They said watching the \u201corange flames over the north side of the houses\u201d put them \u201con edge\u201d as they watched from safety. The fire is burning as the nation grapples with a summer of more\u00a0extreme heat\u00a0\u2013 the deadliest form of weather globally and one making wildfires more likely and destructive. And with the planet warming due to fossil fuel pollution, the heat will only get\u00a0more frequent\u00a0and intense. \u201cWe\u2019ve evacuated our horses, and we\u2019ll get some more. I\u2019ll do it all night long if I have to,\u201d resident Chris Hull told CNN affiliate KNXV as he was fueling up his truck to haul more livestock. \u201cWhatever it takes.\u201d Fire activity in Maricopa County picked up late Thursday, forcing officials to shift crews to the southeast side of the fire to protect structures. The wildfire is also threatening \u201chigh voltage power lines and the Sonoran Desert,\u201d authorities said via InciWeb. \u201cIt\u2019s burning through grass and brush and has moved off of private land onto the Tonto National Forest,\u201d they said. Nearly 270 personnel have been assigned to the fire, according to Sunday\u2019s InciWeb update. \u201cCrews will especially focus on the southeast part of the fire due to residences at risk and prevailing winds as fire crews on the south and west sides of the fire will improve firelines and begin mop up,\u201d the update read. Chances of thunderstorms could \u201cmake firefighting efforts more complicated due to gusty winds and lightning strikes,\u201d according to the update.

The teenager, identified as Nyah Mway, was approached by three officers Friday night after he and another 13-year-old matched the descriptions of robbery suspects, according to a release from the Utica Police Department. Officers were patrolling the area to assist with two recent robbery investigations where \u201cthe suspects were described as Asian males who brandished a black in color firearm and forcibly demanded and stole property from victims,\u201d the release reads. \u201cBased on the listed identifying factors from the robbery, officers approached Nyah Mway and the other juvenile as they matched the robbery suspects\u2019 descriptions and were in the immediate vicinity of the previous robbery at nearly the same time of day,\u201d it continues.

Body camera footage released by police shows chaotic struggle The body camera footage released by police shows one officer saying he needs to pat down the two juveniles to make sure they don\u2019t have any weapons. Nyah Mway immediately flees in the video. Some of the footage was edited to insert a red circle around the replica gun and authorities froze the frames where the teen appears to point it at the officers. The officers believed it was a handgun, police said, but it was later determined to be a replica of a Glock 17 Gen 5 handgun with a detachable magazine, The Associated Press reported. The replica gun carried by the teen \u201cis in all aspects a realistic appearing firearm with Glock markings, signatures, detachable magazine, and serial numbers,\u201d Lt. Michael Curley, a police spokesperson, said via email to The Associated Press. \u201cHowever ultimately it fires only pellets or BB\u2019s.\u201d The police body camera video shows a chaotic scene. In the footage, Nyah Mway appears to point the replica handgun at police while he flees. The officers yell \u201cgun,\u201d and one police officer tackles and punches the teenager. As they are wrestling on the ground, another police officer fires a single shot. Bystanders scream at the police throughout the recordings, and at one point an officer yells back, \u201cWe\u2019re trying to save him right now!\u201d The other youth was detained in the back of a police vehicle and was not involved in the shooting, The Associated Press reported. The police department released the body camera videos following a public outcry as the shooting roiled Utica, a city with a population of 65,000. It is home to more than 4,200 people from Myanmar, according to The Center, a non-profit helping to resettle the refugees, The Associated Press reported. Nyah Mway, who local media reports said was an eighth grader at Donovan Middle School, was identified as a refugee born in Myanmar and a member of the Karen ethnic minority, The Associated Press reported. There are two ongoing, parallel investigations into the incident, according to police: one by the New York State Attorney General, and another by the Utica Police Department\u2019s Professional Standards Unit. Tensions run high during news conference A news conference about the incident ended early Saturday after tensions ran high. The conference was stopped several times after audience members audibly booed and interrupted the police chief and Utica Mayor Michael P. Galime. An interpreter struggled to speak over repeated audience outbursts. Members of the community, including the youth\u2019s family, were in attendance, The Associated Press reported. \u201cI know there\u2019s a lot of emotions in this room and a lot of upset people,\u201d the police chief said. \u201cBut you\u2019re asking us to be transparent \u2013 you\u2019re asking us to be transparent, and when you shout over us, it makes it very difficult to do so.\u201d A small group also staged a protest outside the Utica Police station Saturday night. One protester\u2019s sign reads \u201cJustice for Nyah Mway. Forever 13.\u201d Another protest took place Monday morning, according to CNN affiliate WKTV Galime met for more than two hours with members of the community on Sunday to discuss the shooting. It is \u201cextremely tragic\u201d to see a police stop end like this, the mayor said, adding the city has \u201cworked so hard to make sure we train, we understand, and we are completely objective in how we deal with our community.\u201d \u201cRight now, it feels that possibly the police did something out of anger and out of subjectivity. I know that we are doing everything we can to make sure our police departments and our whole government as whole truly treats everyone through objectivity,\u201d Galime said. During the meeting, community members asked questions and expressed their concerns on topics such as police procedures during stops and racism. \u201cThey would like to change right now, right away, but we understand that\u2019s something that cannot happen right now, right away,\u201d Lupway Doh, a leader of the Karen community, told CNN affiliate WKTV.
