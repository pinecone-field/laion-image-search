They\u2019ve even survived five mass extinctions, including the\u00a0asteroid\u00a0that wiped out 75% of life on the planet. But many species of these aquatic apex predators are now in danger of dying out forever. \u201cSharks are in crisis globally,\u201d says the\u00a0WWF.\u00a0Overfishing\u00a0(hunting for their meat, fins, and other parts before they can reproduce fast enough) is their biggest threat along with unintentionally getting caught in fishing gear and the effects of climate change. Of the thousand known species of sharks and rays (sharks\u2019 closest living relatives), over a third of them are at risk of\u00a0extinction. And since sharks are \u201cindicators of ocean health,\u201d as sharks go, so does the delicate balance of marine ecosystems. From gathering data to educating the public to advocating for underwater life, many conservation groups are on a mission to protect these prehistoric creatures before they are lost to history. Shark research Research is key to conservation. Scientists rely on this information to inform wildlife and habitat management and conservation plans while advocates use data to develop and recommend policy to public officials. This research can also be used for public safety purposes as well as to educate future generations that will inherit the planet. Often conducted in remote and dangerous environments, shark research requires time and money. But that work is paying off as researchers continually identify new species of sharks, such as those that can\u00a0walk on the ocean floor\u00a0and\u00a0glow in the dark. These research-oriented organizations are exploring the world\u2019s reefs, seas, coastlines, and oceans to ultimately benefit shark conservation: Shark conservation Unfortunately for sharks,\u00a0NOAA\u00a0says, \u201cWhat makes them unique also makes them vulnerable.\u201d Some species of sharks, like great whites, are slow to reproduce: they can take\u00a0decades\u00a0to reach breeding age, have pregnancies last up to three years, and produce small litters. And warming waters are\u00a0shifting\u00a0some of their migration patterns beyond protected areas, putting them at risk of fishing. All of it is hurting their numbers. A 2021 report showed over the last 50 years, global shark and ray populations have\u00a0fallen more than 70%. \u201cIf we don\u2019t do anything, it will be too late,\u201d says biologist and study co-author\u00a0Nick Dulvy. \u201cIt\u2019s much worse than other animal populations we\u2019ve been looking at,\u201d adding the downward trend for sharks is even steeper than those for elephants and rhinos, which are \u201ciconic in driving conservation efforts on land.\u201d While the study found we may approach a \u201cpoint of no return,\u201d there are encouraging signs that conservation efforts are starting to work for white sharks and hammerheads thanks to government bans, policies, and quotas. There is still a long way to go, however, so many conservation organizations like these are dedicated to rescuing and protecting these vulnerable creatures: Protecting the ocean It\u2019s not just sharks that are vulnerable to deteriorating conditions in the water \u2013 the entire marine ecosystem is at risk due to unsustainable fishing practices, climate change, and pollution, which has reached \u201cunprecedented\u201d levels within the last 20 years. The\u00a0Great Pacific Garbage Patch, the largest concentration of ocean plastic in the world, is now twice the size of Texas. Global ocean surface temperatures broke daily records for most of the last year. Researchers warn all coral reefs on Earth\u00a0could die out\u00a0by the end of the century, threatening wider ecological collapse. Experts say it\u2019s not too late to reverse course, but the window to do so is shrinking. A report in the journal\u00a0Nature\u00a0found marine wildlife to be \u201cremarkably resilient\u201d and\u00a0could recover by 2050 with urgent and widespread conservation interventions. Organizations like the ones below are committed to protecting the health of the entire ocean and all life within it: See the form below or click\u00a0here\u00a0to support these organizations\u2019 work and help save sharks before it\u2019s too late.", "source": "http://cnn.com/us/how-to-help-sharks-shark-week-iyw/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/04/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_07_03_business_noncompete-clause-federal-judge-ruling", "text": "A federal judge on Wednesday preliminarily delayed a ban on noncompete agreements from taking effect for a handful of employers on September 4. Unless the judge makes another ruling to the contrary before that date, the ban on noncompete agreements will go into effect for the majority of companies in the US. But they will learn later this summer if that still holds.  \u201cWhile this order is preliminary, the Court intends to rule on the ultimate merits of this action on or before August 30, 2024,\u201d wrote Judge Ada Brown of the US District Court for the Northern District of Texas. There is likely to be a concerted effort between now and the end of August to persuade the judge to block the ban nationwide, according to Jesse Coleman, a partner at the law firm Seyfarth Shaw in Houston, which represents SHRM, a human resource management association. The ban, which prohibits employers from enforcing noncompete clauses in most existing employment agreements and bans companies from including them in all future ones, was approved by the Federal Trade Commission in April. Within a day of the FTC approval, the agency was sued by Ryan LLC, a tax services and software provider based in Texas, and, separately, by the US Chamber of Commerce and other business groups. Wednesday\u2019s order limits the preliminary injunction to just the plaintiff (Ryan LLC) and the plaintiffs-intervenors, which are the US Chamber of Commerce, the Business Roundtable, the Texas Association of Business and the Longview Chamber of Commerce. However, it doesn\u2019t extend to the member companies of those groups. \u201c[T]he Court declines to extend injunctive relief to members of Plaintiff-Intervenors,\u201d the judge wrote. Even though the court indicates that it believes the FTC lacks the rulemaking authority to issue a noncompete ban, the judge declined to issue a nationwide ban for now, Coleman said.  Part of the reason, according to the order, appears to be that the plaintiffs-intervenors did not sufficiently brief the court on why a ban should be applied more widely. The FTC estimates that 30 million people \u2014 one in five US workers \u2014 are bound by a noncompete clause in their current jobs. For most of them, the agency asserts that such a clause restricts them from freely switching jobs, lowers wages, stifles innovation, blocks entrepreneurs from starting new businesses and undermines fair competition. The US Chamber of Commerce, in a statement, characterized the limited preliminary injunction as a win. \u201cThe FTC\u2019s blanket ban on noncompetes is an unlawful power grab that defies the agency\u2019s constitutional and statutory authority and sets a dangerous precedent where the government knows better than the markets. The U.S. Chamber will continue to hold the FTC accountable in court,\u201d said the group\u2019s chief counsel Daryl Joseffer. In response to the order, FTC spokesperson Douglas Farrar said, \u201cThe FTC stands by our clear authority, supported by statute and precedent, to issue this rule. We will keep fighting to free hardworking Americans from unlawful noncompetes, which reduce innovation, inhibit economic growth, trap workers, and undermine Americans\u2019 economic liberty.\u201d In the meantime, the court\u2019s order does not preclude the FTC from taking enforcement actions against noncompete agreements on a case-by-case basis.

{"id": "2024_07_03_us_replica-handgun-utica-police-shooting", "text": "Before an officer fatally shot Nyah Mway last week as he ran from law enforcement in upstate New York, the 13-year-old had pulled out what police said appeared to be a handgun. But it wasn\u2019t a real gun, authorities later discovered, they\u2019ve said \u2013 only one capable of firing pellets. Still, the firearm \u2013 which is entirely black, photos released by the Utica Police Department show \u2013 carried the same \u201cGlock markings, signatures, detachable magazine and serial numbers\u201d as a Glock 17 Gen 5 handgun, Utica Police spokesperson Lt. Michael Curley told The Associated Press. \u201cThis weapon in every facet resembles a real GLOCK handgun, in functionality, appearance, and design,\u201d he told CNN, adding it\u00a0\u201cfires .177 pellets.\u201d Nyah Mway apparently pointed the handgun at three officers while he ran away from them after dark, body camera footage released by Utica Police shows. The officers yelled \u201cgun,\u201d and one officer tackled and punched the teenager. As they wrestled on the ground, another officer fired a single shot, the video shows. The teen was taken to a local hospital where he died, police said. Imitation guns have led to unintended fatal consequences over the years, posing challenges for law enforcement who interpret them as real in a nation with more guns than people. Here\u2019s what we know about such items and some other cases: What imitation firearms are \u2013 and aren\u2019t Toy, look-alike and imitation firearms are devices that \u201chave the appearance, shape, and/or configuration of a firearm,\u201d according to the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the agency that enforces federal rules governing them. The term \u201clook-alike firearm\u201d includes:\u2022 Toy guns\u2022 Water guns\u2022 Replica nonguns\u2022 Airsoft guns firing nonmetallic projectiles Some other guns that don\u2019t fire live bullets, however, are not considered \u201clook-alike firearms.\u201d The term does not include:\u2022 Non-firing collector replica antique firearms\u2022 Traditional BB, paintball or pellet-firing air guns\u2022 Decorative, ornamental and miniature objects that have the appearance of a firearm and measure no more than 38 mm by 70 mm (excluding any gun stock length) In Utica,\u00a0police initially said Nyah Mway was holding\u00a0\u201ca replica GLOCK pellet gun.\u201d It appears a firearm with that description would not be considered a look-alike under the federal rule \u2013\u00a0although at night, it may have been virtually impossible for a police officer to know that. What regulations require of look-alikes While federal law does not govern the transfer, use or possession of imitation guns, according to the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, the way such items look when they\u2019re \u201cmanufactured and entered into commerce\u201d is regulated \u2013 to a degree \u2013 by the Consumer Product Safety Commission. Every look-alike firearm \u2013 that is: toy guns, water guns, replica nonguns and airsoft guns that fire nonmetallic projectiles \u2013 must either:\u2022 have a permanently affixed blaze orange plug inserted in the firearm\u2019s barrel\u2022 have a similar marking on the exterior of the barrel\u2022 be constructed entirely of transparent or translucent materials\u2022 or be covered in certain bright colors The rules \u2013 in place since 1989 \u2013 don\u2019t apply to non-firing replicas; BB, paintball or pellet guns; or decorative or mini firearms. They also do not cover \u201chow consumers use or enjoy their products,\u201d according to the commission. Under those rules, it appears the Consumer Product Safety Commission would not require the gun Nyah Mway was carrying to bear \u201clook-alike firearm\u201d markings, such as an orange plug or transparent or bright coverings, either because of its pellet projectiles or as a replica. Being able to buy a look-alike or imitation gun also can depend on the law. For example, while Amazon sells a variety of imitation firearms, the online marketplace won\u2019t ship airsoft guns, non-powdered weapons like BB guns, pellet guns, paintball guns and air rifles or toy guns to places with sales restrictions, its policy states. Amazon, Walmart and three other retailers announced a deal in 2015 with the then-attorney general of New York \u2013 where Nyah Mway was fatally shot \u2013 to stop selling realistic toy guns there. And Pennsylvania, Florida, Delaware and other states impose age restrictions on the possession, use or transfer of some non-powder guns, according to the Giffords Law Center. \u2018No one could reasonably tell the difference\u2019 Police across the United States shot 305 people brandishing non-powder and toy firearms between 2015 and 2023, according to a Giffords Law Center analysis of the Washington Post\u2019s Fatal Force database, which tracks fatal shootings of civilians by police. While police in Utica initially said Nyah Mway was holding\u00a0\u201ca replica GLOCK pellet gun,\u201d they later clarified the term \u201creplica\u201d was used to describe its physical condition because of its resemblance to a Glock handgun, the department told CNN on Tuesday. \u201cIn the future we will ensure that we utilize proper terminology so that there is no mistake in what we are trying to portray,\u201d Curley said. Imitation handguns in the hands of anyone \u2013 especially juveniles \u2013 pose many challenges for police departments across the country, Curley added. \u201cAs we see in this tragic incident, split second decisions have to be made when individuals are in possession of realistic looking weapons that are indistinguishable\u00a0from their real counterparts,\u201d he said. \u201cNo one could reasonably tell the difference between the two, much less in high stress situations where the item is being displayed.\u201d Imitation guns have led to other fatalities In New York \u2013 where Nyah Mway was shot and killed \u2013 at least 63 shootings, eight of them fatal, unfolded as a result of people mistaking imitation weapons for real ones, according to 2015 data from the state Office of the Attorney General. Beyond that, hundreds of crimes have been committed in New York City with imitation weapons, the office said. No new data was available on the issue, it told CNN this week. Just last month, a teenager with an airsoft gun was fatally shot by an armed man who \u201ctook it upon himself\u201d to conduct surveillance outside a sporting goods store in Washington state, according to court documents. The armed man \u201cassumed\u201d the teen and two others were about to commit a violent robbery, the prosecutor wrote. The man has been charged with murder. His attorneys say he was acting in self-defense, protecting himself and others. Several years before that, Antonio Arce, 14, was fatally shot by police in Tempe, Arizona, while holding what later was determined to be a replica 1911 airsoft gun he\u2019d just stolen from a truck reported to police as suspicious. The officer who fired was not criminally charged in Arce\u2019s death. And in 2014, Tamir Rice, 12, was shot and killed outside an Ohio recreation center when an officer opened fire after authorities mistook a black, toy airsoft pistol Tamir had for a real firearm. The US Justice Department in 2020 found insufficient evidence to support federal criminal charges against the former officer who fired his weapon at Rice.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/03/us/replica-handgun-utica-police-shooting/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/04/2024", "section": "us"}}

Soaring temperatures \u2013 which will continue into next week \u2013 have dried out already-parched vegetation, increasing the wildfire risk across the region. Gov. Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency for the area of the fire, clearing the path for additional resources, including the possibility of mobilizing the California National Guard to assist. The\u00a0governor\u2019s proclamation\u00a0cites \u201ccontinued high temperatures throughout the day and night, dry conditions, and strong winds\u201d that have increased the intensity and spread of the fire. A local emergency was also declared, and\u00a0evacuations were ordered\u00a0on Tuesday evening for some residents\u00a0in\u00a0the city of Oroville,\u00a0as the Thompson\u00a0Fire\u00a0continues to burn in\u00a0Butte County, according\u00a0to local officials. Cal Fire said the blaze has grown to more than 3,500 acres and was zero percent contained in an update around noon local time on Wednesday. Four firefighters battling the blaze have been injured, Cal Fire said. More than 1,400 firefighters are working to suppress the flames, along with eight helicopters and numerous air tankers, the agency said. Oroville is\u00a0about 65 miles\u00a0north\u00a0of Sacramento with a population of around 15,000. The town sits about 20 miles south of Paradise, where the catastrophic Camp Fire killed more than 70 people in 2018. Some of the residents impacted by that fire ended up relocating to Oroville. About 13,000 people in\u00a0Butte County, including northeastern parts of Oroville,\u00a0were ordered to evacuate,\u00a0according to the sheriff\u2019s office. The city of Oroville\u2019s July 4 fireworks celebration was canceled by California State Parks on Wednesday as firefighters continue to battle the fire, the department said in a news release. \u201cDue to the large evacuations and damages caused by the\u00a0Thompson Fire,\u00a0State Parks and partner agencies \u2026 have a large number of resources responding to protect the community and get everyone back home as quickly as possible,\u201d State Parks said. \u201cThese agencies also have employees with families displaced by these evacuations who are tirelessly assisting the community of Lake Oroville.\u201d Red flag warnings are in effect across the West, including in the fire zone, because of extreme heat, gusty winds and low humidity. Already high temperatures will only ramp up Wednesday as an exceptional, long-lasting heat wave begins. Oroville will see\u00a0record temperatures of 110 or more each of the next five days \u2013 Saturday may reach an all-time record high of 113 \u2013 making it that much harder for fire crews to fight the blaze. The\u00a0Basin Fire in Fresno County has\u00a0burned more than 13,000 acres and is currently only 26% contained. \u201cOutdoor burning and especially fireworks are\u00a0not\u00a0recommended,\u201d the\u00a0weather service\u00a0in\u00a0San Francisco warned ahead of the Independence Day holiday. Triple-digit temperatures across parts of US Nationwide, more than 150 million people across at least 22 states in parts of\u00a0the\u00a0Mid-South and West are under heat alerts. The heat wave is \u201cexceptionally dangerous and lethal,\u201d the weather service in San Francisco said, warning \u201can event of this scale, magnitude, and\u00a0longevity will likely rival anything we\u2019ve\u00a0seen\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0last\u00a018\u00a0years\u00a0for\u00a0inland areas.\u201d The heat began Tuesday across parts of\u00a0the\u00a0West, where numerous daily high temperature records were tied or broken: Some cities could swelter through multiple days of temperatures well above 100 degrees with some, including Sacramento, potentially\u00a0seeing a full week of highs over 105 degrees. Most of California outside of\u00a0the\u00a0immediate coastline is under excessive\u00a0heat\u00a0warnings. High temperatures from\u00a0the\u00a0upper 90s to as high as 115 degrees are possible. Las Vegas could\u00a0see\u00a0high temperatures all week over 110 degrees.\u00a0The\u00a0current record is 10 consecutive days set last\u00a0year. Death Valley\u00a0could\u00a0see\u00a0high temperatures at or above 120 degrees all week. Heat\u00a0is expected to spread to\u00a0the\u00a0Northwest and to parts of Arizona\u00a0including Phoenix by\u00a0the\u00a0weekend, where triple-digit temperatures are expected, with parts of Arizona\u00a0seeing highs above 110 degrees. A 10-year-old died Tuesday in Arizona after experiencing a heat-related emergency while hiking with family in South Mountain Park and Preserve, authorities said. First responders performed an active mountain rescue and airlifted the child to the hospital, where he later died, the Phoenix Police Department said. On Saturday, a 69-year-old hiker from Austin, Texas, died at the Grand Canyon, according to the National Park Service. Scott Sims became unconscious on the trail and attempts by bystanders and paramedics to resuscitate him were unsuccessful. Park rangers warn that summertime temperatures on the trail can reach over 120 degrees in the shade and advise not hiking during the day, between the hours of 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. Efforts to assist hikers can be delayed during the summer due to increased need and limited resources, the park service said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/03/us/thompson-fire-california-heat-wave/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/04/2024", "section": "us"}}

The NSP told CNN Tuesday that the victims were all Guatemalan and that they have all been released from area hospitals. A SWAT team was activated, and\u00a0\u201cat approximately 6:40\u00a0pm\u2026 made entry into the home where the gunfire had originated, 1810 Parkland Street, and located the occupant\u00a0deceased from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. The SWAT team located a shotgun near the suspect,\u201d\u00a0according to NSP. In a Saturday\u00a0news conference,\u00a0Colonel John A.

Crete Police Chief\u00a0Gary Young Jr. said at\u00a0the news conference authorities had previous\u00a0contact with the suspect as they had responded to \u201cseveral complaints since 2021\u201d\u00a0that he made. \u201cMost of them dealt with driving behavior,\u00a0not necessarily associated with the victims\u2019 house,\u00a0but cars driving too fast in the neighborhood, improper parking, nuisance properties, quality of life type issues,\u201d Young Jr. said, adding that the suspect complained \u201cgenerally about the neighborhood.\u201d Earlier this year, there was a \u201csingle report from the victims that the suspect had flipped them off, told them \u2018to go home\u2019 or \u2018back to where they came from,\u2019 and \u2018speak English.\u2019\u201d Young Jr. said at the time\u00a0the responding officer interviewed the family and the suspect, and the officer was\u00a0\u201cwilling to take it for prosecution\u2014the family declined.\u201d Based on interviews with the family Friday, Young Jr. said,\u00a0\u201cMy understanding is that additional contacts were made between the suspect and the family, and the family told them\u00a0that they would contact the police and that resolved the situation, so we had no further contact.\u201d When asked\u00a0if authorities believe there is a \u201cracial\u00a0component\u201d to the prior complaints Young Jr.\u00a0said\u00a0\u201cthere could be.\u00a0We don\u2019t know. Certainly, the context of \u2018go home\u2019 and \u2018speak English\u2019 lends itself to that.\u201d Authorities have yet to determine if the shooting is a hate crime, the NSP said in a statement Tuesday. \u201cAll of the injuries are consistent with shotgun blast injuries and, as you know, a shotgun disperses many pellets when a shotgun is discharged, which\u00a0that probably accounts for the large number of people who were struck,\u201d Bolduc said at the news conference. \u201cThat lends itself to the fact that we\u2019re dealing with injuries and not necessarily fatalities \u2026 but at this point we believe that all will survive.\u201d CNN\u2019s Jillian Sykes contributed to this report.

NBC announced on Wednesday it will use AI software to recreate Michaels\u2019 voice to deliver daily recaps of the Summer Games for subscribers of its Peacock streaming platform, a milestone for the use of AI by a major media company. The use of an AI voice for the Olympics comes as the technology has grown by leaps and bounds, particularly in its ability to create images, sound and text. That, in turn, has raised questions in creative industries, such as journalism, about how artificial intelligence can \u2013 or even should \u2013 be used. A new tool, called \u201cYour Daily Olympic Recap on Peacock,\u201d will enable 10-minute highlights packages, which can include events updates, athlete back stories and other related content personalized by subscriber preferences. The company said the highlights could be packaged in about 7 million different ways, pulled from 5,000 hours of live coverage in Paris, effectively making AI (the artificial intelligence, not the man) a significantly more efficient way to deliver personalized recaps.  \u201cWhen I was approached about this, I was skeptical but obviously curious,\u201d Michaels said in a press release. \u201cThen I saw a demonstration detailing what they had in mind. I said, \u2018I\u2019m in.\u2019\u201d A NBC spokesperson told CNN Michaels is being compensated for his involvement. Michaels, a long-time broadcaster, is currently the play-by-play sportscaster for Thursday Night Football on Amazon Prime. He\u2019s also known for his work on previous Olympics Games broadcasts for both NBC and ABC and for calling the Miracle on Ice Game at the 1980 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid, New York. NBC said the AI system was trained using prior NBC broadcast audio from Michaels. The company said a team of NBC Sports editors will review all of the content, including audio and clips, to make sure everything is factually accurate and names are pronounced correctly. The highlights tool will be available on Peacock via web browsers and iOS and iPadOS apps starting July 27.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/26/tech/al-michaels-ai-olympics/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/04/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_07_03_politics_kamala-harris-joe-biden", "text": "Vice President Kamala Harris\u2019 camp is digging in and dismissing calls for her to replace President Joe Biden on the ticket amid escalating calls for the president to step aside and new polling showing the vice president outpacing Biden in a hypothetical race against Donald Trump. The mandate among Harris campaign staff is to remain firm, stay in line and keep the focus on the Biden-Harris ticket, one source told CNN.\u00a0The vice president\u2019s staff received similar guidance in a virtual staff meeting Monday to follow the vice president\u2019s lead and keep heads down, another source told CNN. The internal marching orders echo the message Harris is taking on the trail. On Tuesday, Harris again\u00a0batted down the idea of running in Biden\u2019s place during a brief interview with CBS. \u201cLook, Joe Biden is our nominee. We beat Trump once and we\u2019re going to beat him again, period,\u201d she said. \u201cI am proud to be Joe Biden\u2019s running mate,\u201d she later added. The\u00a0latest CNN poll\u00a0conducted following last week\u2019s debate\u00a0shows\u00a0Harris\u00a0within striking distance of Trump in a hypothetical matchup: 47% of registered voters support Trump and 45%\u00a0Harris, a result within the margin of error that suggests there is no clear leader under such a scenario. Former Democratic Rep. Tim Ryan publicly called on Democrats to replace Biden with Harris. \u201cWe talk about President Biden\u2019s administration being the most successful administration in modern history. We brag about that. She was in the room. She was right there, three-and-a-half years, went through the campaign with him,\u201d Ryan told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper Tuesday. \u201cI think she would be able to talk about that much clearer than the president would be able to,\u201d Ryan added, referring to the administration\u2019s record. \u201cI think she would absolutely juice up the Democratic base.\u201d Democratic Rep. Katie Porter, meanwhile, didn\u2019t call on Biden to drop out of the race and stopped short of fully backing her fellow Californian, telling CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper on \u201cThe Lead\u201d that there should be \u201ca robust democratic process\u201d to determine the Democratic nominee should the president step back. The congresswoman said Harris \u201cwould be a very, very top contender in that process,\u201d but she signaled openness to other candidates, arguing the more \u201cqualified\u201d candidates there are in the race at that point, \u201cthe better for our democracy.\u201d The White House, Porter said, \u201cfumbled\u201d the strategy for damage control following the debate and she urged the president to \u201cget\u00a0out\u00a0there\u00a0and\u00a0earn\u00a0the\u00a0trust\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0American\u00a0people\u201d and not just contact top Democrats in Congress as Biden has done in recent days. In the immediate fallout from the debate,\u00a0Harris\u2019\u00a0staff\u00a0made phone\u00a0calls\u00a0to check in with Democratic officials, trying to reassure them, remind them of Biden\u2019s record and agenda and call on them to remain united, CNN previously reported. Sources close to the vice president have repeatedly maintained that she is fiercely loyal to Biden, arguing that her public statements since last week\u2019s CNN-hosted presidential debate reflect where she is. \u201cSome just don\u2019t understand the rules, some are stirring the pot and some have their own agenda,\u201d one source close to Harris said, when asked about calls for Harris to replace Biden on the ticket.\u00a0\u201cBut for her, there is one plan and focus and it starts with Joe Biden and this country.\u201d Biden and Harris have spoken multiple times since Thursday\u2019s debate, two sources familiar with the conversations said. And on Wednesday, the president is keeping his running mate intentionally close. The two had lunch in Biden\u2019s private dining room at the White House and made a joint appearance during a call with campaign staff in Wilmington. Harris has also been invited by the president and his advisers to join the meeting with governors, placing her in the same room as some of the very men and women who could become challengers \u2013 or, potential running mates of her own, should Biden end his bid for reelection and she becomes the Democratic nominee. The overarching message, a senior campaign adviser told CNN: \u201cHe\u2019s with her.\u201d Should Biden step aside, several party officials and advisers say plans are underway for Biden to immediately throw his support behind Harris, release his Democratic delegates and ask them to do the same. Former presidents and party leaders would follow suit, in hopes of avoiding a contentious fight to lead the Democratic ticket. \u201cWho would stand up against our historic vice president to be our nominee for president?\u201d a senior Democratic official told CNN, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive talks in advance of any formal decision from Biden. But Harris is going to great lengths to avoid being seen as getting ahead of the president. She told her team again Wednesday the timing of this decision \u201cis Biden\u2019s alone to make,\u201d one aide said. \u201cThe President is and will remain our party\u2019s nominee, and Vice President Harris is proud to be his running mate, and looks forward to serving at his side for four more years,\u201d Brian Fallon, a campaign spokesman, told CNN. \u201cReports suggesting they or the campaign are considering alternative scenarios are patently false.\u201d This story has been updated with additional reporting.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/03/politics/kamala-harris-joe-biden/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/04/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_07_03_politics_democrats-house-biden", "text": "In the days since President Joe Biden\u2019s disappointing debate performance, a number of Democrats running in competitive districts have expressed their fear to the Biden campaign and the White House that the president remaining at the top of the ticket not only hurts the party\u2019s chances of holding onto the presidency but also the coveted goal of winning back the House of Representatives from GOP control. The Democratic lawmakers have expressed their belief that Biden could suppress voter turnout, which will be the deciding factor in a number of key races, and therefore hurt their ability to win in November, according to multiple sources familiar with the conversations. Democratic Rep. Jared Golden, who represents\u00a0a largely rural district in Maine that twice backed former President Donald Trump, said Tuesday in an op-ed he expects Trump to win in November \u201cand I\u2019m OK with that.\u201d Washington state Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez said Tuesday she believes Biden will lose but stopped short of calling for him to drop out of the race. \u201cAbout 50 million Americans tuned in and watched that debate. I was one of them for about five very painful minutes. We all saw what we saw, you can\u2019t undo that, and the truth, I think, is that Biden is going to lose to Trump. I know that\u2019s difficult, but I think the damage has been done by that debate,\u201d Gluesenkamp Perez told CNN affiliate KATU when asked if Biden should remain in the race. In particular, Democrats in the most difficult general election matchups are feeling the heat. \u201cThe frontliners are not hesitating to tell the campaign how they feel,\u201d one Democratic lawmaker familiar with the conversations told CNN. \u201cThey are saying they are going to lose if they have to run with Joe Biden.\u201d Retiring Rep. Ann Kuster, who represents a hotly contested swing seat in New Hampshire, told CNN\u2019s Kasie Hunt she\u2019s been in touch with both the White House and Biden campaign \u201cabout concerns about the president\u2019s well-being are impacting house races, particularly challenging districts.\u201d \u201cIn order to respond to our constituents\u2019 concerns, we need to demonstrate that the president is fit not just for the job, but for the campaign,\u201d Kuster said. \u201cJoe Biden has always done the right thing for his country, so that\u2019s why I expect that this will get resolved. And that\u00a0Democrats will be united behind the ticket.\u201d Another House Democrat from a deep blue state told CNN on Wednesday the last 24 hours have started to feel different. The lawmaker\u00a0described the flood of messages from delegates and rank-and-file Democratic voters in the last 24 hours as all saying essentially the same thing: \u201cI love and respect the president, but it\u2019s time.\u201d This Democratic lawmaker said this was the first time since Biden\u2019s disastrous debate performance that delegates and rank-and-file Democratic voters expressed their desire for Biden to step aside. And another Democratic lawmaker said that their assessment of Biden\u2019s candidacy is that \u201cit\u2019s over, we are just waiting for the announcement. [Biden] is not there yet, will take a bit to get there, but it\u2019s over.\u201d Asked if Biden\u2019s interviews and events scheduled over the next few days could change that, the lawmaker did not think so. \u201cIt\u2019s about the data,\u201d this member said, noting that it is \u201cgetting worse.\u201d The lawmaker also said a full member call is being scheduled among Democrats on the Hill. As of Wednesday afternoon, the timing of the call had not been set. The White House tried to quell concerns Tuesday, with spokeswoman Karine Jean-Pierre opening her briefing saying:\u00a0\u201cFirst of all, I want to say, we understand the concerns. We get it. The president did not have a great night.\u201d She later added: \u201cWe\u2019re not taking away from what the American people saw.\u201d Asked whether Biden regularly presents himself the way he did at the debate, Jean-Pierre cited a speech that Biden\u00a0gave in North Carolina the day after the debate:\u00a0\u201cHe understands that he\u2019s not a young man,\u201d she said, adding that his focus is going to be on continuing \u201cto deliver for the American people on the issues that they care about.\u201d Asked about the Democratic concerns, Biden campaign spokesperson Lauren Hitt said: \u201cThe President has spoken personally with multiple elected officials on the Hill and across the battlegrounds since the debate.\u201d Rep. Suzan DelBene, a Washington state Democrat who chairs the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, remained emphatic in her support for Biden in a statement. \u201cThe stakes are incredibly high this election, for all of us. That hasn\u2019t changed after last week,\u201d DelBene said. \u201cThe choice this November is crystal clear: Democrats who want to govern responsibly versus extremist Republicans obsessed with tax breaks for billionaires, rolling back reproductive freedom, and defending Trump\u2019s attacks on our democracy. Our candidates are authentic leaders with proven records and I remain confident Democrats will retake the majority.\u201d Battle for control Democrats have an uphill battle to retain control of the Senate.\u00a0Republicans needs to pick up only one or two seats \u2014 depending on which party wins the White House \u2014 to flip control, and the races will come down to whether red-state Democrats can defy the partisan tilt of their states. But the House is a different story. Republicans control the\u00a0House\u00a0by a narrow margin and 17\u00a0of\u00a0those GOP lawmakers were elected in communities that backed Biden in 2020. The dysfunction that has overshadowed the current Republican majority has emphasized the pitfalls of razor-thin margins but underscores how even the lower chamber can serve as a roadblock to the White House. Another Democrat in contact with the Biden campaign said, \u201cI know that I and others are stressing the importance of flipping the House as a last firewall in the case of a Trump presidency.\u201d But the response Democrats are getting back is largely to hold tight until the president and his inner circle can assess the damage done and chart a path forward. \u201cThe Biden campaign has heard a lot of concern from strong supporters across the country but has asked for time to process and digest incoming polling data and to map out a strategy going forward\u201d one Democratic lawmaker told CNN. \u201cEveryone is standing by the president as his campaign works to assess the damage done,\u201d the lawmaker added. The prevailing line from the campaign continues to be that Biden had a bad debate night that should not diminish the record he has built up in his first term, particularly compared to the danger that Trump poses. Some Democrats, however, are not willing to wait. Democratic Rep. Lloyd Doggett of Texas on Tuesday\u00a0became\u00a0the first sitting Democratic member of Congress to call on Biden to withdraw from the presidential race,\u00a0\u00a0while a\u00a0growing number\u00a0of Democratic leaders are saying they want him to step aside for the good of the party \u2014 and the country. Getting out there The other prevailing sentiment lawmakers have been sharing with the campaign in recent days is their desire for the president to hold more events and media interviews if he is serious about putting his debate performance in the rearview mirror. Rep. Gregory Meeks, the top Democrat on House Foreign Affairs, acknowledged the day after the debate that it was a difficult night for Biden and said that the president should take steps to prove that he is capable of a second term by holding more town hall meetings and answering hard questions from the press. \u201cI think he\u2019s going to have to put himself out there more,\u201d Meeks told reporters. Rep. Bennie Thompson, the top Democrat on the House Homeland Security Committee, agreed. \u201cObviously, he needs to take his message to the public. I think his strategy should be continue to engage,\u201d Thompson said Friday. The White House said Tuesday Biden will participate in a campaign event Friday as well as an interview with ABC News. They also announced a news conference next week as part of the DC-hosted NATO summit. But the concern among the handful of Democrats, whom CNN granted anonymity to speak candidly, was whether more Biden appearances would help stop the drumbeat of anxiety about the president\u2019s ability to remain at the top of the ticket. \u201cIt will help if it proves he can be relaxed, freewheeling and fluent, but it will hurt if he\u2019s entirely scripted on the teleprompter and seemingly exhausted. It all depends on what the public sees,\u201d another Democratic lawmaker told CNN. Publicly standing by Biden Publicly, House Democratic leaders have stood behind Biden but have also pivoted the conversation to what they can control: winning back the House. House Democratic Leader Hakeem\u00a0Jeffries\u00a0told reporters \u201cwe are going to win the House in November\u201d when asked about his reaction to Biden\u2019s performance the day after the debate. Biden called Jeffries\u00a0as well as Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer on Wednesday, sources told CNN, the first time that Biden spoke with the Democratic leaders since the debate. House Democratic leadership are holding a call Wednesday, a source familiar told CNN. The day after the debate, Jeffries and former President Barack Obama held a fundraiser for the House Democratic campaign arm in New York, specifically focused on the need for Democrats to take back the House, and raised $3 million, according to a source familiar. In\u00a0a further\u00a0effort to tamp down concerns, Biden campaign also sent an email to the\u00a0chiefs of staff\u00a0for House Democratic members on Wednesday laying out the latest polling numbers and touting their recent $127 million fundraising\u00a0haul, a source\u00a0familiar shared with CNN.\u00a0The campaign said their polling reflected a steady race, noting that polls \u201care a snapshot in time\u201d and could fluctuate. The No. 3 Democrat in the House, Rep. Pete Aguilar, told CNN that Biden had a \u201ctough night\u201d at the debate but added \u201cit\u2019s all the more reason why I\u2019m going to work every day between now and November to flip the House.\u201d Meanwhile, old guard Democratic lawmakers Reps. Jim Clyburn and Nancy Pelosi also weighed in Tuesday, with Clyburn backing Biden but offering that, if he weren\u2019t at the top of the ticket, he would back Vice President Kamala Harris. Pelosi, the former House speaker, said it was a \u201clegitimate question\u201d for voters to ask whether Biden\u2019s debate performance last week was \u201cepisode\u201d or if it is \u201ca condition\u201d during an interview on MSNBC Tuesday. The former speaker also said that she has heard \u201cmixed\u201d responses to the debate from donors and other people in her Democratic network. \u201cSome are like, well, how can we subject the [nomination] process to what might be possible? And others are, \u2018Joe\u2019s our guy. We love him, we trust him.\u2019\u201d \u201cIt is going to be up to Joe Biden,\u201d she added. This story has been updated with additional developments.

Instead, the woman,\u00a0identified in public records by her initials \u201cTR,\u201d had been masquerading as her wife, Peggy Randolph, then a licensed clinical social worker, according to an investigative report from the Florida Department of Health. Randolph, who provided services to clients in Tennessee and Florida for her employer Brightside Health, helped her wife conduct online therapy sessions using her credentials while Randolph was seeing other patients in person, the report and a settlement agreement between Randolph and the state of Tennessee detailed. But Randolph\u2019s wife was not licensed or trained to provide any sort of counseling services,\u201d according to a settlement agreement between Randolph and the state of Tennessee. The couple\u2019s \u201ccoordinated effort\u201d to defraud patients came to light when Randolph was taking bereavement leave after her wife died, the documents stated. CNN tracked down an\u00a0online obituary\u00a0for 58-year-old Tammy Heath-Randolph that lists Peggy Randolph as the deceased\u2019s wife. Heath-Randolph (TR) died on February 11, 2023, just weeks before a patient complained to Brightside. Randolph \u201cdenies knowing\u201d\u00a0Heath-Randolph had been conducting therapy sessions using her Brightside Health Therapist Portal log-in credentials, the settlement agreement states. However, Brightside\u2019s internal investigation revealed Randolph had provided those credentials to her wife who \u201cwas seeing all her patients and had been for a long time,\u201d according to the Florida report. Randolph also received compensation for the sessions her wife conducted, the settlement agreement states. When\u00a0she was presented with a photograph showing Heath-Randolph with one of her clients, she acknowledged that she was her wife. Brightside Health took \u201cswift and decisive action\u201d once it learned of the breach, a statement provided to CNN. \u201cWe\u2019re extremely disappointed that a single provider was willing to violate the trust that Brightside and, most importantly, her patients had placed in her,\u201d the statement said. The impacted patients were fully reimbursed, Brightside Health said. The company also revoked Randolph\u2019s access to its software systems immediately after receiving notice of the incident and ended her contract, it said. Randolph worked for the company\u00a0from January 2021 until February 2023, according to the settlement, which says she was\u00a0\u201cassigned to provide therapy sessions to hundreds of clients.\u201d\u00a0It\u2019s unclear how many patients were seen by her wife during that time period. In an emailed statement, Brightside spokesperson Hannah Changi told KFF Health News that Brightside couldn\u2019t say how many patients were seen by Randolph\u2019s wife \u201cdue to the nature of the incident and ongoing legal proceedings.\u201d Randolph gave up her license voluntarily in both Florida and Tennessee and in May was ordered by the state of Tennessee to pay a $1,000 civil penalty within 12 months.

{"id": "2024_07_03_tech_elevenlabs-ai-celebrity-voices", "text": "Actress Judy Garland never recorded her voice to read an audiobook of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, but you\u2019ll soon be able to hear her rendition of the children\u2019s novel that inspired the movie nonetheless. Earlier this week, AI company ElevenLabs said it is bringing digitally produced celebrity voice-overs of deceased actors, including Garland, James Dean and Burt Reynolds, to its newly launched Reader app. The company said the app takes articles, PDF, ePub, newsletters, e-books or any other text on your phone and turns it into voice-overs.  \u201cWe deeply respect their legacy and are honored to have their voices as part of our platform,\u201d said Dustin Blank, head of partnerships at ElevenLabs. \u201cAdding them to our growing list of narrators marks a major step forward in our mission of making content accessible in any language and voice.\u201d The company said it made deals with the estates of the actors whose voices are being used, but did not share details about compensation. The effort shows the potential of artificial intelligence for Hollywood but also sets a precedent for licensing and working with estates. It also comes at a time when the technology has grown by leaps and bounds, particularly in its ability to create images, text and sound, making it easy for anyone to create a version of someone\u2019s voice saying something they never did. That, in turn, has raised questions in creative industries such as journalism and film about how artificial intelligence can \u2014 or even should \u2014 be used. ElevenLabs previously made headlines earlier this year when its tool was reportedly used to create a fake robocall from President Joe Biden urging people not to vote in New Hampshire\u2019s presidential primary. Copyright questions and authenticity The partnership with the stars\u2019 estates comes two months after ChatGPT-maker OpenAI came under fire after introducing a synthetic voice that was eerily similar to Scarlett Johansson\u2019s character in the film \u201cHer.\u201d Johansson said in a statement shared with CNN that she was \u201cshocked, angered and in disbelief\u201d that the company would use her likeliness likeness after she turned down a partnership opportunity with OpenAI. Although a person can\u2019t copyright their own voice, it\u2019s possible to copyright a recording, according to David Gunkel, a professor at the department of communications at Northern Illinois University who tracks AI in media and entertainment. The AI is trained on old recordings and those recordings are under copyright. \u201cElevenLabs\u2019 new partnerships are all well within the realm of what the law allows,\u201d he said. \u201cAn estate will get a considerable amount of money from licensing and agreements. It\u2019s not unlike a company negotiating a copyright deal to use a popular song by Queen in an ad. The record company also could in theory say no, no matter how much money they\u2019re offered.\u201d Bern Elliot, a vice president and analyst at market research firm Gartner, said AI models can now be trained on fewer audio recordings; very little is needed to capture tone, speech patterns and other elements, whether it\u2019s for a celebrity or an everyday person. \u201cThe bigger concern is determining what the owner of those recordings can or can\u2019t do to monetize the voice,\u201d he said. Media companies are also ramping up their use of AI for voiceovers. Last week, NBC announced it is bringing an AI-version version of famed sportscaster Al Michaels back to the Olympics this summer, in daily recaps on its Peacock streaming platform. An NBC spokesperson told CNN that Michaels is being compensated for his involvement. It\u2019s unclear, however, how AI versions of well-known voices will be received by mass audiences and if it will raise concerns around authenticity. \u201cWe don\u2019t know yet the supposed market for these types of things but you can already see with audiobooks that ones read by recognizable voices and celebrities are a hot commodity,\u201d Gunkel said. \u201cIf there\u2019s a way to have a celebrity do all kinds of content and not voice it themselves, that could open up the market even wider.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/03/tech/elevenlabs-ai-celebrity-voices/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/04/2024", "section": "us"}}

The Boulder View Fire, which ignited Thursday east of Carefree in Arizona\u2019s most populous county has burned through more than 3,700 acres and was 63% contained as of Sunday evening, according to an update on InciWeb on Sunday. \u201cContainment increased on the east side of the fire after it reached the Wildcat Fire-burned area and stopped spreading,\u201d according to InciWeb\u2019s Sunday update. The now fully contained Wildcat Fire started in May and scorched more than 14,000 acres.  Crews will continue structure protection efforts on Sunday and focus on \u201cimproving firelines\u201d around the Boulder View Fire, the update stated. In the meantime, fire officials announced they had lifted evacuation status in the affected area, though residents need to remain aware of dangerous conditions according to the state\u2019s \u201cReady, Set, Go!\u201d program. \u201cAreas in GO evacuate status were downgraded to SET while areas in SET status were returned to READY status on Saturday afternoon at 5 p.m.,\u201d the update Sunday said, referring to the three levels of preparedness used to guide residents ahead of and during evacuations. The \u201cReady\u201d status signifies being prepared and aware of hazards, while \u201cset\u201d encourages residents to be alert about significant danger in their area and to consider voluntarily evacuating. \u201cGo\u201d urges people to evacuate from imminent and life-threatening danger, according to the Arizona Emergency Information Network. An evacuation order went into effect Thursday night for residents along the southeast side of the fire, the Arizona Department of Forestry and Fire Management said in\u00a0a social media post. The department said at least 60 homes were evacuated Thursday. About 4.5 million people live in the county. \u201cIt definitely puts a little bit of a panic into your mind right away,\u201d a Scottsdale woman told CNN affiliate KPNX. \u201cWe made a plan. We have had a plan. We have lots of friends in the area that have trucks and trailers ready to go when we are.\u201d The woman, along with another resident, safely evacuated to another property in north Scottsdale where they have mares, pigs, goats and cats. They said watching the \u201corange flames over the north side of the houses\u201d put them \u201con edge\u201d as they watched from safety. The fire is burning as the nation grapples with a summer of more\u00a0extreme heat\u00a0\u2013 the deadliest form of weather globally and one making wildfires more likely and destructive. And with the planet warming due to fossil fuel pollution, the heat will only get\u00a0more frequent\u00a0and intense. \u201cWe\u2019ve evacuated our horses, and we\u2019ll get some more. I\u2019ll do it all night long if I have to,\u201d resident Chris Hull told CNN affiliate KNXV as he was fueling up his truck to haul more livestock. \u201cWhatever it takes.\u201d Fire activity in Maricopa County picked up late Thursday, forcing officials to shift crews to the southeast side of the fire to protect structures. The wildfire is also threatening \u201chigh voltage power lines and the Sonoran Desert,\u201d authorities said via InciWeb. \u201cIt\u2019s burning through grass and brush and has moved off of private land onto the Tonto National Forest,\u201d they said. Nearly 270 personnel have been assigned to the fire, according to Sunday\u2019s InciWeb update. \u201cCrews will especially focus on the southeast part of the fire due to residences at risk and prevailing winds as fire crews on the south and west sides of the fire will improve firelines and begin mop up,\u201d the update read. Chances of thunderstorms could \u201cmake firefighting efforts more complicated due to gusty winds and lightning strikes,\u201d according to the update.

{"id": "2024_06_28_us_karen-read-murder-trial-jury", "text": "The Massachusetts judge presiding over the Karen Read murder trial ordered the jury to continue deliberations after the jurors sent a note Friday saying they could not reach a unanimous verdict. The six-man and six-woman jury in the trial of Read, who is accused of drunkenly driving into her police officer boyfriend and leaving him to die in January 2022, informed the court shortly after midday, saying, \u201cDespite our exhaustive review of the evidence and our diligent consideration of all disputed evidence, we have been unable to reach unanimous verdict.\u201d After hearing arguments from the prosecution and defense, Norfolk County Superior Court Judge Beverly Cannone asked the jury to continue to deliberate. \u201cLunch will be arriving shortly; when it comes, I\u2019d ask you to clear your heads, have lunch and begin your deliberations again,\u201d Cannone told the jurors. After the judge\u2019s order, the jury continued deliberating until shortly after 4 p.m. local time. Deliberations will resume Monday morning at 9 a.m., the judge announced. The jury has been deliberating Read\u2019s fate since midday Tuesday. The case has featured accusations of a vast police cover-up as well as allegations of improper conduct and sexist text messages from a lead investigator. The prosecution and defense both weighed in on the jury\u2019s note, asking the judge to consider different outcomes in her decision on what to tell the jury. \u201cIt is far, far, far too early in their deliberative process to even consider giving them any kind of Tuey-Rodriguez instruction or anything close to that,\u201d Norfolk County Assistant District Attorney Adam Lally said, referring to a special set of Massachusetts instructions that are read to a jury when jurors are unable to agree on a verdict. \u201cThe note doesn\u2019t really indicate affirmatively that they can\u2019t come to a conclusion, it just says they haven\u2019t come to a conclusion through their deliberative process at this time.\u201d Alternately, defense attorney David Yannetti argued the jury should be read the Tuey-Rodriguez criminal model instructions, indicating that they would like the court to proceed toward having a hung jury. \u201cThe word exhaustive is the word I think that\u2019s operative here,\u201d he told the judge. \u201cThey are communicating to the court that they\u2019ve exhausted all manner of compromise, all manner of persuasion, and they\u2019re at an impasse.\u201d The judge said she weighed both counsel\u2019s views in deciding to send the jury back to deliberate a verdict in the controversial case. The Tuey-Rodriguez instructions were not read to the jury. Case law cautions against reading the instruction prematurely. Read, 45, pleaded not guilty to charges of second-degree murder, vehicular manslaughter while intoxicated and leaving the scene of a collision resulting in death. If found guilty of second-degree murder, Read faces a maximum sentence of life in prison, according to\u00a0Massachusetts law. The body of her boyfriend, Boston Police Officer John O\u2019Keefe, was found bruised and battered in the snow on January 29, 2022, outside the home of a fellow Boston police officer in Canton, Massachusetts. Prosecutors have alleged Read and O\u2019Keefe, who had an at-times tumultuous relationship, got into an argument that night, and that she drunkenly backed into him and fled the scene, leaving him to die in the cold. \u201cWhat the constellation of the facts and the evidence ineluctably demonstrate here is that the defendant drove her vehicle in reverse at 24.2 miles per hour for 62.5 feet, struck Mr. O\u2019Keefe, causing those catastrophic head injuries, leaving him incapacitated and freezing him to death,\u201d prosecutor Adam Lally said in closing arguments Tuesday. In contrast, Read\u2019s defense has accused off-duty police inside that Canton home of fatally beating O\u2019Keefe, dumping his body on the lawn and then conspiring through fabricated evidence and false testimony to frame Read. \u201cLadies and gentlemen, there was a cover-up in this case, plain and simple,\u201d defense attorney Alan Jackson said. \u201cYou\u2019ll surely say to yourself, \u2018I don\u2019t want to believe it, I don\u2019t want to believe that could happen in our community,\u2019 but sadly over these past eight weeks you\u2019ve seen it right before your eyes.\u201d The closing arguments represented the end of a murder trial that has garnered interest both local and widespread, including accusations of witness tampering, a federal probe into the investigation, and groups of pink-wearing supporters chanting to \u201cFree Karen Read.\u201d The prosecution\u2019s case also has been hampered by a series of missteps and unusual investigative practices. Most notably, a lead investigator in the case, Massachusetts State Police Trooper Michael Proctor, admitted that he sent a series of sexist and offensive texts about Read in a private group chat, calling her a \u201cwhack job,\u201d mocking her medical issues and commenting to coworkers that he had found \u201cno nudes\u201d while searching her phone for evidence, CNN affiliate WCVB reported. Proctor apologized for the \u201cunprofessional\u201d comments on the stand, but the vulgar texts have been sharply criticized in and out of court, including from the governor. \u201cIt\u2019s completely unprofessional,\u201d Gov. Maura Healey told WCVB of the texts. \u201cIt does harm, frankly, to the dignity and the integrity of the work of men and women across the state police and law enforcement. So as a former attorney general and as governor, I am disgusted by that.\u201d This story has been updated with additional information.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/28/us/karen-read-murder-trial-jury/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/04/2024", "section": "us"}}

{"id": "2024_07_02_us_karen-read-mistrial-what-happens-next", "text": "The murder trial of Karen Read ended in a mistrial Monday after jurors couldn\u2019t reach a unanimous verdict, prolonging a case that\u2019s divided a Massachusetts community amid allegations of a sweeping cover-up by police and investigative misconduct. While not an acquittal, the outcome was a boon for Read, who is accused of drunkenly driving into her then-boyfriend, Boston police officer John O\u2019Keefe, and leaving him to die on a snowy night in January 2022 outside a home in Canton, Massachusetts. The 45-year-old had pleaded not guilty to charges of second-degree murder, vehicular manslaughter while intoxicated and leaving the scene of a collision, and she faced up to life in prison if convicted. But prosecutors with the Norfolk District Attorney\u2019s Office failed to convince the jury of six men and six women beyond a reasonable doubt. Over the last two days of the five-day deliberations, jurors repeatedly informed the judge they were hopelessly deadlocked, saying in a final note on Monday their perspectives were \u201cstarkly divided.\u201d Now, prosecutors must decide whether to rethink their approach. As they reconsider their case, they may decide to present evidence differently in hopes of securing a conviction, or avoid a second trial altogether and offer a plea deal, legal experts said. \u201cThey\u2019re going to make an assessment about basically what went wrong,\u201d trial attorney Misty Marris told CNN. \u201cYou go back, and you do the diagnostic: Where does the evidence fail to meet those standards from the jury\u2019s perspective?\u201d Here\u2019s what could happen next: Prosecutors intend to retry the case In a brief statement Monday, the office of Norfolk County District Attorney Michael Morrissey said it plans to retry the case, which alleged Read and O\u2019Keefe had gotten into an argument the night of January 28, 2022, before she struck him with her SUV and fled the scene. The couple had been out drinking at two bars with friends, then went to the home of O\u2019Keefe\u2019s colleague for an after-party, court documents show. O\u2019Keefe was found the next morning bruised and battered in the snow outside the home in Canton. Read and her attorneys had, in turn, presented another theory: Read dropped O\u2019Keefe off, then left \u2013 while O\u2019Keefe was injured in a fight with off-duty officers inside the home, mauled by the homeowners\u2019 dog, then tossed in the snow to die. The police then conspired to fabricate evidence and lie under oath to protect their own and frame Read, her defense alleged. Court documents say Read went looking the next morning for O\u2019Keefe in the snowstorm and found his body in the front yard of the Canton home. Prosecutors rejected that theory, presenting evidence the couple had a volatile relationship. Firefighters who responded the morning of January 29 to the site of O\u2019Keefe\u2019s body asked about his injuries and were told by Read, \u201cI hit him, I hit him,\u201d according to their testimony. Additionally, Read\u2019s vehicle had a broken taillight, and pieces of the taillight were found at the scene. Read\u2019s attorneys on Monday signaled they would not shy away from a retrial. \u201cNo matter how long it takes, no matter how long they keep trying, we will not stop fighting. We have no quit,\u201d\u00a0Alan Jackson, one of Karen Read\u2019s attorneys, said in video provided by CNN affiliate WCVB outside the courthouse. Prosecutors could rethink the case \u2026 Prosecutors\u2019 decision to quickly signal their intent to retry the case wasn\u2019t unexpected, said Rosanna Cavallaro, a professor of law at Suffolk University in Boston. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to be seen as thinking that they failed, or that they have nothing but a very strong case,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the reality is, of course, that what a mistrial means is that the jury could not agree, and they were not persuaded.\u201d But ahead of a status conference on July 22, prosecutors will be engaged in a post mortem of the case, said Daniel Medwed, a law professor at Northeastern University, and they will be asking themselves a series of questions. \u201cWhat worked, what didn\u2019t work? If they were to proceed again,\u201d he said, \u201cwould they choose the same charges? \u2026 Would they change their strategy in some ways? Where are places that they need to shore up their case, maybe through additional investigation?\u201d Perhaps, Medwed said, prosecutors will look back and feel they overreached charging Read with murder, which requires intent, and instead focus on the other charge. \u201cThey might just consider dropping the murder charge and going with manslaughter,\u201d he said. Indeed, Cavallaro said the indictment against Read and the charges stemming from it would not change. But prosecutors could offer another narrative that would make it easier for a second jury to convict Read on a lesser type of homicide than second-degree murder like manslaughter or reckless manslaughter. The stories heard by the jury were \u201cbinary\u201d and \u201cpolarized,\u201d she said: In prosecutors\u2019 telling, Read intended to kill O\u2019Keefe, while the defense argued she was innocent and framed. \u201cIt\u2019s possible the second time around, the government says, \u2018Maybe we need to give the jury this intermediate possibility that she didn\u2019t mean to kill him,\u2019\u201d Cavallaro said, in addition to alleging Read intended to murder O\u2019Keefe. \u201cIt captures the idea that a reasonable person would have been more careful, and because of your lack of care, your recklessness, a death occurred that you\u2019re responsible for,\u201d she added. \u201cThat behavior is punishable as a homicide, but not as a murder,\u201d she said. \u2026 or offer a plea deal Former Massachusetts Attorney General Martha Coakley indicated in an interview with WCVB that prosecutors could drop the most serious charge of second-degree murder, adding, \u201cThey can also seek to plea bargain, which is something that I\u2019m guessing they will at least talk about.\u201d \u201cIf I were defense counsel, you owe it to your client to talk and the prosecution could talk about whether they could reduce charges and reach some plea agreement,\u201d Coakley said. In jurors\u2019 final note to the judge before she declared a mistrial, they said \u201csome members\u201d believed the prosecutors had met the burden of proof, proving the charges beyond a reasonable doubt. But \u201cothers\u201d felt the evidence failed to meet that standard. Jurors\u2019 language signaled it was not a single holdout but multiple jurors who were unconvinced, Cavallaro said, which the defense would take as a win. \u201cGiven that,\u201d she asked, \u201cis there any temptation for (Read) to plead?\u201d Medwed echoed that idea, pointing out that Read\u2019s defense focused on her proclaimed innocence in O\u2019Keefe\u2019s death. He would be surprised if she was interested in pleading guilty to anything that would include admitting she caused O\u2019Keefe\u2019s death. State trooper\u2019s testimony appears to be key A key decision could be whether to present testimony from a lead investigator who had to apologize on the stand for sexist and offensive texts he sent about Read in a private group chat, according to WCVB. Massachusetts State Police Trooper Michael Proctor called her a \u201cwhack job,\u201d mocked her medical issues and told coworkers he found \u201cno nudes\u201d while searching her phone for evidence, the station reported. Proctor was relieved of duty Monday following the mistrial, state police Col. John Mawn said in a news release. \u201cThis follows our previous decision to open an internal affairs investigation after information about serious misconduct emerged in testimony at the trial,\u201d Mawn said, adding the investigation is ongoing. CNN has sought comment from the State Police Association of Massachusetts. An attorney for Proctor previously said he was cooperating with the internal inquiry and said his personal messages did not undermine the investigation into O\u2019Keefe\u2019s death. There\u2019s no evidence Proctor tampered with any evidence, Julie Grant, a Court TV anchor and a former federal prosecutor, told CNN\u2019s Sara Sidner Tuesday. But his behavior and comments were \u201cunprofessional.\u201d \u201cThe Massachusetts State Police \u2013 you have to wonder if they felt as if he had any role in this hung jury,\u201d she said. Still, experts who spoke to CNN saw Proctor\u2019s testimony as key to the commonwealth\u2019s case, which might force prosecutors to call on him despite the apparent baggage. \u201cHe\u2019s the lead investigator, which means that his performance, his work, his efforts are inherently relevant to the case,\u201d Medwed said, adding the defense would likely call the trooper to impeach the investigation even if prosecutors didn\u2019t. \u201cI just don\u2019t see how the government can avoid him as much as they\u2019d like to,\u201d Medwed said.

As the president faced a growing number of calls Wednesday to\u00a0step aside as the party\u2019s presumptive presidential nominee, a former Biden aide said the president and the first lady would not make any significant decision without consulting the other. \u201cThey don\u2019t make significant decisions in any part of their lives without consulting the other. She is a trustworthy sounding board for him, he always wants to know what she thinks, what her opinion is,\u201d the aide said. The White House pushed back Wednesday evening on criticism around the first lady\u2019s role and responsibility as her husband tries to salvage his candidacy. \u201cThe President has plenty of political and policy advisors \u2013 that\u2019s never been her role,\u201d Elizabeth Alexander, deputy assistant to the president and communications director to the first lady, told CNN. \u201cAs much as any husband and wife team make decisions together that impact their lives, they absolutely do, but as she\u2019s said more times than I can count \u2013 politics is his lane. She supports his career and he supports hers.\u201d Alexander lamented the \u201cinherent tension\u201d that previous first ladies have endured that she believes is being amplified in this moment for Jill Biden. \u201cYou are supportive, but can\u2019t be so supportive that your motives are questioned,\u201d she said. \u201cSociety has put all first ladies, including Dr. Biden, in an impossible situation \u2013 with Twitter/X magnifying this on steroids in today\u2019s world.\u201d Asked whether Jill Biden is hiding a medical condition of her husband, she replied \u201cNo. An emphatic no.\u201d An ally of the president and first lady separately told CNN that all of the calls for Jill Biden to step up at this moment are ludicrous. \u201cIt\u2019s unfair to put the future of the Democratic Party on a spouse; she\u2019s not elected, not a professional political advisor; she\u2019s not a pollster, or a campaign manager,\u201d the source said. Biden, according to the source, will continue to be his biggest defender, saying: \u201cCall it being a Mama Bear or Philly Girl \u2013 she\u2019s tough, and of course defends her family.\u00a0Always will.\u201d A second former Biden aide said any decision on the president\u2019s future would not be made by the first lady alone, but rather the very small inner circle of family members \u2013 namely, this source said: Ashley Biden, Hunter Biden and Valerie Biden. Members of the Biden family are expected to be on hand for Fourth of July festivities at the White House. The president and the first lady are expected to speak together at an event in Philadelphia on Sunday and will spend the rest of the weekend at their home in Wilmington, Delaware. It is possible other family will join the couple in Delaware as well. The president huddled with his children and grandchildren at Camp David earlier this week, a long planned gathering to partake in a family photo shoot but one where the state of his presidential campaign arose. The family encouraged the president to stay in the race in the days after his halting debate performance, sources told CNN. After spending two days at Camp David, the president and first lady returned to the White House with Hunter Biden, his wife Melissa and son Beau. Hunter Biden accompanied his father as he met with staff to prepare for his speech on the Supreme Court\u2019s presidential immunity ruling. \u201cHunter\u00a0came back with him and walked with him into that meeting, that prep, that speech prep. And you know, and he ended up spending time with his dad and his family that night. That is basically what happened,\u201d White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Tuesday. \u201cThey were together at Camp David. They came back together.\u201d The president\u2019s son, who was recently found guilty on three felony gun charges, also attended a Medal of Honor ceremony at the White House Wednesday.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/03/politics/biden-family-first-lady-2024-race/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/04/2024", "section": "us"}}

The court records don\u2019t specify the felony charges against Porter. John Marzulli, a spokesperson for the US Attorney\u2019s Office for the Eastern District of New York, confirmed Wednesday the case was connected with four men who were recently arrested. The\u00a0NBA banned the Toronto Raptors player\u00a0in April for violating the league\u2019s gambling rules. An attorney for Porter, Jeff Jensen, didn\u2019t immediately respond Wednesday to a request for comment. In June, Long Phi Pham, a Brooklyn man, was charged with conspiring with three others to defraud a sports betting company by placing wagers on an NBA player who was later banned, according to a\u00a0federal complaint. Pham took part in a scheme to place \u201cunder prop\u201d bets on the player \u2013 determined by CNN at the time to be Porter \u2013 in January 26 and March 20 games, prosecutors allege. Court records allege Pham and the others knew the player would take himself out of games early claiming illness or injury, so the bettors would win their wagers. Court documents show Porter\u2019s criminal case is related to Pham\u2019s, in addition to cases against Ammar Awawdeh, Timothy McCormack and Mahmud Mollah. The latter three were not previously publicly named in the federal complaint. All four defendants waived their preliminary hearings, according to court filings. CNN has reached out to attorneys for Pham, Awawdeh, and Mollah for comment. Court filings didn\u2019t list an attorney representing McCormack.

{"id": "2024_07_03_us_mass-shootings-fourth-july-fbi-tips", "text": "Mass shooters generally don\u2019t just snap. Instead, they plot. And many outwardly display troubling signs along their pathway to violence. That assessment from the renowned profilers at the FBI\u2019s behavioral analysis units underpins a new effort by the bureau\u00a0to inform the public of key warning signs ahead of gatherings for the Fourth of July \u2013 a holiday period that researchers say tends to feature an increase in mass shootings. The FBI says that if people report seeing threat indicators that would-be shooters typically exhibit, they may very well prevent a massacre. What are the warning signs? \u201cYou have someone who may be more fixated on violence, maybe obsessively focusing on violent fantasies or ways to resolve their different challenges,\u201d said Karie Gibson, who leads one of the FBI\u2019s behavioral analysis units and holds a doctorate in psychology. \u201cThey may actually record or write a manifesto or an actual video or suicide note, to really want to take credit for this plan they are preparing to do.\u201d Noticeable shifts in behavior are also key. \u201cYou have somebody who, at one time in their life, was functioning in a way where they were handling the stress, and now we\u2019re seeing marked changes to that,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing that they have changes in their school performance or work performance; we\u2019re seeing that they are not participating in hobbies or areas of activities.\u201d For certain people, the \u201cpathway to violence, a lot of times, will begin with a grievance,\u201d Gibson said. \u201cIt can be a slight, it can be an injustice, it can be a wrong that has happened to them \u2013 it can be real or perceived.\u201d No single factor guarantees someone might commit a shooting, but when several concerning characteristics begin to manifest, it could be time to seek help, either from law enforcement, a principal or a supervisor, she said. \u2018Our best hope\u2019 \u201cFriends, family, teachers, classmates, workmates, and others similarly situated are our best hope,\u201d Katherine Schweit, mass shooting expert and former FBI executive, wrote in her book \u201cStop the Killing.\u201d These people often are best placed to pick up a phone and report concerns \u2013 but to make the correct move they may have to push themselves past any notion that they\u2019re not the ones who need to do it, Schweit warned. For example, she wrote, teachers may simply try to wait out a concerning student and pass them to the next grade. Parents ill-equipped to handle a struggling child may try to pass them off to another relative. Schweit wrote that those closest to a possible mass shooter might become desensitized to concerning conduct or may refuse to believe the end result could be an attack, but notes speaking up is critical to saving lives. \u201cWe have to accept a willingness to understand that what we see and hear may be a pattern of behaviors that might lead a person to act out violently,\u201d she wrote. \u2018Our worst week for shootings\u2019 Law enforcement statistics and independent researchers have continually pointed to summer months as a time of increased gun violence in the US. An especially violent period each year for both mass shootings and individual incidents: July 1-7. \u201cThat is always our worst week for shootings,\u201d said Mark Bryant, executive director of the Gun Violence Archive, a nonprofit that tracks gun deaths and injuries across America. Both CNN and the Gun Violence Archive define a mass shooting as an incident in which four or more people are shot, not including the shooter. July 4 itself accounted for more US mass shootings than any other single calendar day over roughly a decade, a 2023 CNN analysis of the Gun Violence Archive\u2019s mass shooting data since 2014 found. The day with the second most number of shootings was the day after \u2013 July 5. Over the past three years, 77 mass shootings happened collectively during the first week of July, Bryant said. \u201cThere are so many people in large groups during that period of time and it\u2019s usually extremely hot,\u201d Bryant said. \u201cYou\u2019ll find a difference in an area that is 95 degrees versus a place that is 65 degrees.\u201d That impact of heat on the rate of gun violence has been studied by academic researchers, who have noted how higher temperatures\u00a0can result in increased anger, agitation, and hostility. Other possible factors responsible for an uptick in violence around Independence Day include the consumption of alcohol at gatherings and the sheer number of guns now available in the US, which has often resulted in people attempting to settle disputes with firearms. Bryant says the odds are, \u201cwhen one gun comes out, other guns come out.\u201d More than \u2018mental illness\u2019 Although the FBI\u2019s behavioral analysts have long helped law enforcement agencies across the country prevent and solve crimes, the bureau ramped up its proactive approach to curbing gun deaths in 2018 following deadly mass shootings in Las Vegas and at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, Gibson said. That effort included building and supporting more than 150 federal, state, and local law enforcement threat assessment teams across the US to help stop the next mass shooter. As the initiative has progressed, the FBI has evolved to not just sharing information with law enforcement, but more proactively educating the public about the agency\u2019s behavioral research findings and warning signs. While a spate of mass killings in recent years has placed greater emphasis on the impact of mental health in driving certain acts of violence, a key finding of the FBI\u2019s examinations of active shooters across the nation has dispelled notions that all shooters are mentally ill, versus those individuals unable to handle the stresses of life, Gibson said. \u201cThis is lending towards really looking at how someone is coping with stress, how someone is managing their life when they\u2019re struggling,\u201d Gibson said. \u201cLet\u2019s help them, let\u2019s help get interventions, because it\u2019s more about that mental wellness issue that they\u2019re struggling with versus an actual mental illness.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/03/us/mass-shootings-fourth-july-fbi-tips/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/04/2024", "section": "us"}}

Messiah Young and Taniyah Pilgrim will\u00a0each\u00a0receive $1 million as part of the settlement. \u201cThe resolution of the civil case will allow these young people and their families to continue healing from this traumatic experience. It is important for them to help the community to remember that the fight to prevent police brutality continues,\u201d Mawuli Davis, Young\u2019s lawyer, told CNN. \u201cThis case has been a roller coaster of emotions for two innocent college students who were the victims of unjustifiable excessive force by officers of the APD (Atlanta Police Department). We pray this acts as a sign of change that the City will continue to step forward and do the right thing in civil rights cases,\u201d\u00a0Pilgrim\u2019s legal team said in a statement. Pilgrim and Young were in their vehicle in downtown Atlanta on May 30, 2020, when they were caught in traffic by protests sparked by George Floyd\u2019s death days before. The lawsuit claimed that while the students\u2019 car was stopped due to heavy traffic, they were approached by six Atlanta Police Department officers and told to open the door and get out of the vehicle. As Pilgrim turned to get out of the car, she was tased twice while still in the passenger\u2019s seat, according to the lawsuit. An officer then broke the window on Young\u2019s side and Young was also tased twice, while he was in the driver\u2019s seat, the lawsuit added. The incident was\u00a0captured on video by bystanders\u00a0and shared widely online. The students said they were out picking up food when they encountered the protests. Then Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms had called a citywide curfew to start at 9 p.m., but the students said in the lawsuit they were unaware of it. The incident happened around 9:40 p.m. that night, the lawsuit said. Young was charged with eluding police but the charges were dropped the next day. Pilgrim was never charged, according to the lawsuit. The students filed their lawsuit a year later in 2021, seeking unspecified damages and naming several individual officers, the city of Atlanta and Bottoms. CNN previously reported that four of the six Atlanta Police officers were fired. They were all\u00a0booked on charges\u00a0of aggravated assault, simple battery and criminal damage to property in the aftermath of the incident. Two of them had their terminations overturned and returned to the force. The Fulton County District Attorney\u2019s office didn\u2019t prosecute the officers involved in the incident, deciding their actions were justified. Chris Stewart, a lawyer for Pilgrim, said Tuesday there are no outstanding lawsuits. \u201cThank you for everyone that has supported us over the years. There\u2019s a lot of work to be done,\u201d Young said during a news conference Tuesday. \u201cThere\u2019s still blood on the streets of Atlanta. The idea of justice that was once lauded unfortunately crumbled to dust. We will keep pushing forward.\u201d \u201cThis situation occurred four years ago and it\u2019s a memory that I\u2019ve been wanting to forget. Unfortunately, it is etched into our memory. I\u2019m happy that this finally settled and I can close this chapter in my life,\u201d Pilgrim added. CNN\u2019s Tina Burnside and Devon Sayers contributed to this report.

{"id": "2024_06_08_us_rust-shooting-timeline-alec-baldwin", "text": "The actor Alec Baldwin and several crew members gathered in a church at a New Mexico ranch on October 21, 2021, to rehearse a scene from their upcoming Western film \u201cRust.\u201d Then came the unexpected gunshot. A promising cinematographer was killed, a director was wounded and a film production was left in shambles. Since that day\u2019s fatal shooting of 42-year-old Halyna Hutchins, the film\u2019s armorer and its assistant director have been convicted of criminal charges. And after some back-and-forth legal arguments, Baldwin soon is set to stand trial on charges of involuntary manslaughter. The details of what happened that day have been made public in affidavits, probable cause statements, interviews with the main participants and testimony at criminal trials. Here\u2019s a timeline of the on-set shooting and the resulting legal cases. The shooting May 29, 2020: Baldwin, the three-time Emmy winner for his roles on \u201c30 Rock\u201d and \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d was announced as producer and star of the Western feature film \u201cRust,\u201d based on a story by Baldwin and Joel Souza, Deadline reported. In the film, Baldwin plays a grizzled outlaw on the run from authorities with his 13-year-old grandson. October 6, 2021: Filming of \u201cRust\u201d began at Bonanza Creek Ranch, a movie set outside Santa Fe, New Mexico. October 20, 2021: Several crew members walked off set, citing safety concerns. One crew member stated there had been two accidental weapons discharges and a special effects mess-up that set off explosives around the crew between takes. October 21, 2021: Hannah Gutierrez Reed, the armorer for \u201cRust,\u201d loaded a prop six-shot revolver with what she believed were \u201cdummy\u201d rounds, a term for ammo that contains no explosive elements but appear to be real, according to investigators and her defense attorney. Baldwin and several crew members began rehearsing a scene in a rustic church on set before breaking for lunch. After the break, Baldwin, Souza, Hutchins and a few others returned to the church for rehearsal. Assistant director Dave Halls fetched a prop gun from a cart outside the church and yelled \u201ccold gun,\u201d indicating it was unloaded. He then handed the gun to Baldwin. Baldwin practiced a \u201ccross draw\u201d \u2013 pulling a gun from a holster on the opposite side of his body from his draw hand. The scene required him to point the gun toward the camera, helmed by Hutchins, Souza and a camera operator. Suddenly, they heard a loud bang. Hutchins stumbled backward, slumped to the floor clutching her stomach and said she couldn\u2019t feel her legs. Souza, who had been standing beside her, noticed blood on his shoulder. At 1:48 p.m., the crew reported the shooting to emergency responders. Hutchins was transported by air helicopter to the hospital and was pronounced dead at 3:37 p.m. Souza was treated at the hospital, and a projectile from a live round was removed from his back. Sheriff\u2019s deputies arrived to the scene and began investigating the series of events leading to the shooting. October 22, 2021: Baldwin released a statement calling the death a \u201ctragic accident\u201d and said he is fully cooperating with the police investigation. December 2, 2021: In an interview with ABC, Baldwin said he cocked the gun and let go of the hammer, and the gun then fired. He said he was aiming the gun just to the side of the camera toward Hutchins, as she instructed him to do. \u201cI would never point a gun at anyone and then pull the trigger, never,\u201d he said. The investigations August 14, 2022: FBI testing of the firearm found it could not be fired without pulling the trigger while the gun was cocked, according to a forensics report. The report noted the gun eventually malfunctioned during FBI testing after internal parts fractured, causing the gun to go off in the cocked position without pulling the trigger. August 20, 2022: In an interview with CNN, Baldwin\u00a0placed responsibility\u00a0for Hutchins\u2019 death on Gutierrez Reed, the film armorer and props assistant, and on assistant director Halls, who handed him the gun. October 5, 2022: The family of Hutchins and Baldwin reached an undisclosed settlement in a wrongful death lawsuit filed against the actor and others. As part of the settlement, Matthew Hutchins, the cinematographer\u2019s widower, was named an executive producer on \u201cRust.\u201d January 19, 2023: Prosecutors announced Baldwin and Gutierrez Reed will be charged with involuntary manslaughter in Hutchins\u2019 death. Halls, the assistant director, agreed to plead no contest to negligent use of a deadly weapon, the district attorney\u2019s office announced. The terms of that deal include six months of probation\u00a0and a suspended sentence, prosecutors said. January 31, 2023: Baldwin and Gutierrez Reed were formally charged with involuntary manslaughter. February 23, 2023: Baldwin pleaded not guilty to manslaughter charges and was released on personal recognizance. April 20, 2023: New Mexico special prosecutors dismissed the charges against Baldwin, citing \u201cnew facts\u201d in the case. \u201cThis decision does not absolve Mr. Baldwin of criminal culpability and charges may be refiled,\u201d they said. August 9, 2023: Gutierrez Reed pleaded not guilty to involuntary manslaughter and tampering with evidence. January 19: Baldwin was indicted by a grand jury on charges of involuntary manslaughter. January 31: Baldwin pleaded not guilty to involuntary manslaughter charges for the second time. February 22: The trial of film armorer Gutierrez Reed began. Prosecutors alleged her failures allowed six live bullets to make their way on set, and she did not make vital safety checks that would have caught the problem. Her defense blamed Baldwin for failing to follow common-sense gun safety rules and on the film\u2019s production team for creating a chaotic and unsafe environment. March 1: Souza, the director and screenwriter, testified about the moment he was shot on set while standing behind Hutchins. March 6: Gutierrez Reed was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter after jurors deliberated for nearly three hours. She was acquitted of a charge of evidence tampering. April 15: At her sentencing hearing, Gutierrez Reed said \u201cmy heart aches\u201d for Hutchins\u2019 family and friends, and she asked the judge to sentence her to probation. The judge criticized her statement and sentenced her to the maximum 18 months in prison, saying, \u201cYou alone turned a safe weapon into a lethal weapon.\u201d May 24: A New Mexico judge denied Baldwin\u2019s motion to dismiss the involuntary manslaughter indictment. Baldwin\u2019s attorneys had accused prosecutors of misconduct during the grand jury process. June 3: New Mexico prosecutors asked the court to grant use immunity to Gutierrez Reed and compel her to testify at Baldwin\u2019s trial, according to court documents. Gutierrez Reed invoked her Fifth Amendment right to silence in a pre-trial interview, and prosecutors said if she is not granted immunity then she would not be able to testify in the trial. Gutierrez Reed\u2019s attorney, Jason Bowles, told CNN he will oppose the motion. June 17: Prosecutors signal their intention to portray Baldwin as repeatedly flouting safety protocols on the movie set in the days before the fatal shooting, according to\u00a0a new court filing. Outlining evidence they intend to present, prosecutors highlighted repeated instances in which Baldwin allegedly acted dangerously between October 12 and October 21, 2021. One of\u00a0Baldwin\u2019s attorneys, Luke Nikas, had no comment about the prosecution\u2019s document, but referred CNN to the defense\u2019s most recent filing asking the court again to dismiss the indictment and accusing the prosecution of selected disclosure of evidence. June 21: Judge Mary Marlowe Sommer denied a defense motion asking the court to dismiss the involuntary manslaughter indictment. The defense argued the shooting death was an accident and Baldwin is \u201cnot criminally liable.\u201d The prosecution countered Baldwin is experienced in the movie business and knew he was handling a real gun. A separate motion to dismiss \u2013 in which Baldwin\u2019s team argued the gun used in the shooting was destroyed during forensic testing by the FBI, preventing the defense from recreating the testing \u2013 will be considered at a hearing next week. The judge also denied the prosecution\u2019s motion to grant use immunity to Gutierrez Reed to compel her to testify at Baldwin\u2019s trial. June 28: The court denied a motion to dismiss related to the gun that was destroyed during forensic testing. The court has yet to rule on a separate motion to dismiss, filed on June 24, claiming prosecutors failed to properly turn over evidence required by court procedure. The state rebutted the accusation in a June 27 filing. Separately, attorneys for Gutierrez Reed in a court filing on June 27 accused prosecutors of withholding evidence that would have favored the defendant during her manslaughter trial and requested she be released from prison,\u00a0Reuters\u00a0reported. According to the fling obtained by Reuters, prosecutors had a report from their own weapons experts that the gun used on set had \u201cunexplained toolmarks on critical surfaces of the trigger and sear.\u201d The evidence suggests the gun could have accidentally fired and could have led to her not being found guilty in the case, said Gutierrez\u2019s attorney, according to Reuters.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/08/us/rust-shooting-timeline-alec-baldwin/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/04/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_07_03_politics_joe-biden-2024-campaign-troubles", "text": "President Joe Biden has privately acknowledged that the next stretch of days are critical to whether he can save his reelection bid for president, making clear to an ally Tuesday that he understands what would prompt him to accept: \u201cIt\u2019s just not working.\u201d \u201cHe sees the moment. He\u2019s clear-eyed,\u201d this person told CNN. There is no ambiguity for the president\u00a0about\u00a0what\u00a0potential\u00a0series of events in the coming weeks would ultimately prompt him to acknowledge that his attempt to make amends\u00a0for last week\u2019s\u00a0disastrous debate on CNN aren\u2019t working, according to this ally. It would be a scenario in which \u201cthe polls are plummeting, the fundraising is drying up, and the interviews are going badly,\u201d\u00a0they\u00a0said. \u201cHe\u2019s not oblivious.\u201d In response to a request for comment, White House spokesman Andrew Bates said that \u201cit is false to suggest there is any openness to ending the campaign.\u201d In the days since Biden\u2019s stunningly halting debate showing, Democrats across the country have expressed grave concern. Some elected officials have even begun to publicly call on Biden to drop out for the good of the party. The New York Times reported separately on Wednesday that Biden acknowledged that he may not be able to save his campaign if he does not perform well in public events over the next several days. The White House and Biden\u2019s campaign have denied that reporting. In Tuesday\u2019s private conversation, Biden was also \u201cchastened\u201d as he \u201cblamed himself\u201d \u2013 not his staff \u2013 for the\u00a0debate performance. \u201cHe said: \u2018I have done way too much foreign policy,\u2019\u201d this person said. \u201cHe said to me: \u2018I have over done it. I did too much travel. I did too much back and forth. I did too much time change. I had a cold. That was a mistake.\u2019\u201d Biden\u00a0was referring to his back-to-back trips to France and Italy right before the debate,\u00a0even though he had nearly two weeks between his return on June 15 from Italy for the G7 meeting and the debate on June 27, according to a CNN review of his schedule. But as much as Biden suggested that the jet lag and exhaustion from his travels had been detrimental, he also signaled that he wanted to put the debate in the rearview mirror in his conversation with the ally. And at one point in their conversation, Biden asked this person for advice \u2013 and then there was silence, the person told CNN, as the president waited for input. But even in the highest levels of Biden\u2019s own administration, serious doubt is starting to set in about whether the president will be able to ride this one out. A senior Biden administration official speaking on the condition of anonymity told CNN that they\u00a0personally\u00a0view the current trend of the gradual erosion of support for Biden among Democrats as \u201cwaves crashing into the shore.\u201d \u201cFirst it\u2019s the donors. And then it\u2019s elected officials. Now it\u2019s going to be polling. It just breaks down the resistance,\u201d they said. \u201cThere\u2019s a group that started small and is getting bigger and bigger.\u201d The senior official said Biden would likely need some time to \u201creconcile\u201d the \u201cpull and the push\u201d as he navigates and digests the coming days and hears from those who believe he should dig in, as well as others who will tell him to step aside for the good of the party. Two sitting House Democrats have so far called on the president to abandon his reelection bid. Where Biden\u2019s family will end up is an important unknowable at the moment, the official added: \u201cI can\u2019t tell you how defiant the family is going to be, which is a big factor.\u201d The president\u00a0said\u00a0at a fundraiser in Virginia Tuesday night that going on two significant foreign trips right before the debate had been a bad idea. During that fundraiser, Biden joked that he \u201calmost fell asleep onstage\u201d during the debate last week and blamed his poor performance on his grueling travel schedule, according to pool reports. \u201cI decided to travel around the world a couple of times \u2026 shortly before the debate \u2026 I didn\u2019t listen to my staff \u2026 and then I almost fell asleep onstage,\u201d Biden said during the fundraiser. The remark was met with brief laughter from those in attendance, according to a recording of the president\u2019s remarks. Multiple reporters who were in the room said that they believed the \u201cfell asleep\u201d line appeared intended to be a joke and that Biden was trying to make light of the situation in a self-deprecating way, but it did not land, in their view. Since the debate,\u00a0Biden has faced one of the toughest stretches of his presidency\u00a0and\u00a0his reelection campaign is reeling.\u00a0Campaign officials are scrambling to calm donors who were shocked by Biden\u2019s\u00a0performance. The White House announced that Biden\u00a0is expected to\u00a0meet with Democratic governors and congressional leaders Wednesday after\u00a0some\u00a0demanded a meeting with the president. Some officials have been\u00a0turned off by the Biden campaign\u2019s dismissiveness over their concerns\u00a0about the president\u2019s health. On\u00a0Tuesday,\u00a0a Democratic member of Congress\u00a0became the first to\u00a0publicly\u00a0ask Biden to drop out of the race. Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris called into the Biden campaign\u2019s all-staff call on Wednesday, a source familiar with the call said. The source described it as a \u201cpep talk\u201d in which Biden and Harris detailed the stakes of the election. Biden reiterated that when\u00a0one gets\u00a0knocked down,\u00a0they need to get\u00a0back up, a familiar refrain from the past week, and said, \u201cLet\u2019s go win this,\u201d the source said. Biden \u201cacknowledged\u00a0the tough past few days and said unequivocally to his team he is running for reelection and he is going to beat Donald Trump,\u201d another source familiar with the call told CNN. \u201cI\u2019m in this race to the end and we\u2019re going to win because when Democrats unite, we will always win. Just as we beat Donald Trump in 2020, we\u2019re going to beat him again in 2024,\u201d Biden told his team, according to that source. Harris, who is dismissing calls to replace Biden, told the team that she will follow Biden\u2019s lead. \u201cWe will not back down. We will follow our president\u2019s lead. We will fight, and we will win,\u201d Harris said, according to the source. Biden concluded, according to the source: \u201cThere is no one I\u2019d rather be in this battle with than all of you. So, let\u2019s link arms. Let\u2019s get this done. You, me, the vice president. Together.\u201d White House chief of staff Jeff Zients held a less than 10-minute all-staff call to encourage his team to tune out the chatter and press ahead with their work even as questions about Biden\u2019s candidacy swirl, one source who participated in the call said. Keep your \u201cheads down, get things done, execution, execution, execution. Second, heads up \u2013 there\u2019s so much to be proud of and there\u2019s so much more we will do together under this president\u2019s leadership,\u201d Zients said, according to the source. \u00a0\u201cThis team can do anything and don\u2019t forget to have each other\u2019s backs.\u201d Zients, who did not take questions on the call, told staff that the \u201cstrong campaign team\u201d will focus on the reelection efforts while staff at the White House should focus on executing the work of the administration, the source said. Zients decided to convene a call with White House staff in part to acknowledge the challenges of the post-debate period, a White House official said. In a previous meeting with senior staff on Friday, Zients and senior adviser Anita Dunn spoke about the president\u2019s debate performance and the expected difficult period ahead, the official said. On Wednesday\u2019s call, Zients echoed the president, declaring, \u201cWhen you get knocked down, you get back up.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s what he is doing and that\u2019s what we all need to do,\u201d he said.

{"id": "2024_07_03_tech_google-ai-greenhouse-gas-emissions-environmental-impact", "text": "As Google has rushed to incorporate artificial intelligence into its core products \u2014 with sometimes less-than-stellar results \u2014 a problem has been brewing behind the scenes: the systems needed to power its AI tools have vastly increased the company\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions. AI systems need lots of computers to make them work. The data centers needed to run them, essentially warehouses full of powerful computing equipment, suck up tons of energy to process data and manage the heat all of those computers produce. The end result has been that Google\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions have soared 48% since 2019, according to the tech giant\u2019s annual environment report. The tech giant blamed that growth mainly on \u201cincreased data center energy consumption and supply chain emissions.\u201d Now, Google is calling its goal to reach net-zero emissions by 2030 \u201cextremely ambitious,\u201d and said the pledge is likely to be affected by \u201cthe uncertainty around the future environmental impact of AI, which is complex and difficult to predict.\u201d In other words: a sustainability push by the company \u2014 which once included the slogan \u201cdon\u2019t be evil\u201d in its code of conduct \u2014 has gotten more complicated thanks to AI. Google, like other tech rivals, has gone all-in on investing in AI, which is widely seen as the next major tech revolution that\u2019s poised to change how we live, work and consume information. The company has integrated its Gemini generative AI technology into some of its core products, including Search and Google Assistant, and CEO Sundar Pichai has called Google an \u201cAI-first company.\u201d But AI comes with a major downside: the power-hungry data centers that Google and other Big Tech rivals are currently spending tens of billions of dollars each quarter to expand in order to fuel their AI ambitions. Illustrating just how much more demanding AI models are than traditional computing systems, the International Energy Agency estimates that a Google search query requires 0.3 watt-hours of electricity on average, while a ChatGPT request typically consumes about 2.9 watt-hours. An October\u00a0study\u00a0from Dutch researcher Alex de Vries estimated that the \u201cworst-case scenario\u201d suggests Google\u2019s AI systems could eventually consume as much electricity as the country of Ireland each year, assuming a full-scale adoption of AI in their current hardware and software. \u201cAs we further integrate AI into our products, reducing emissions may be challenging due to increasing energy demands from the greater intensity of AI compute, and the emissions associated with the expected increases in our technical infrastructure investment,\u201d Google said in its report, published Monday. It added that data center electricity consumption is currently growing faster than it can bring carbon-free electricity sources online. Google said it expects its total greenhouse gas emissions to continue to rise before falling, as the company seeks to invest in clean energy sources, such as wind and geothermal energy, to power its data centers. The large amounts of water used as coolant needed to prevent data centers from overheating also presents a sustainability challenge. Google says it aims to replenish 120% of the freshwater it consumes in its offices and data centers by 2030; last year, it replenished just 18% of that water, although the amount was up sharply from 6% the year prior. Google is also among companies experimenting with ways to use AI to fight climate change. A 2019 Google DeepMind project, for example, trained an AI model on weather forecasts and historical wind turbine data to predict the availability of wind power, helping to increase the value of the renewable energy source for wind farmers. The company has also used AI to suggest more fuel-efficient routes to drivers using Google Maps. \u201cWe know that scaling AI and using it to accelerate climate action is just as crucial as addressing the environmental impact associated with it,\u201d Google said in the report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/03/tech/google-ai-greenhouse-gas-emissions-environmental-impact/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/04/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "us_national-education-association-antisemistism", "text": "Several items being proposed at an upcoming education convention in Philadelphia\u00a0are raising concerns among a pro-Israel advocacy group about potential antisemitism and anti-Israel bias. Delegates of the\u00a0National Education Association (NEA), the largest teachers\u2019 union in the United States,\u00a0will meet at\u00a0the Pennsylvania Convention Center in Philadelphia\u00a0for their annual representative assembly from Wednesday to Sunday. Two rallies were held Wednesday outside the convention hall, one by the Educators for Palestine group \u2013 which is made up of NEA members - and a counter rally by StandWithUs, a nonprofit pro-Israel advocacy organization. StandWithUs has characterized several proposed agenda items being discussed as antisemitic. Although\u00a0the proposed agenda items\u00a0are typically confidential before being voted on at the representative assembly, Educators for Palestine have outlined several in their call to vote yes. CNN has not seen the proposed agenda items. The NEA did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for information on the\u00a0agenda items in question. Both groups aim to raise awareness among NEA delegates about several\u00a0agenda items that\u00a0reportedly\u00a0call for the NEA to\u00a0align itself with the \u201cBoycott, Divestment, and Sanctions\u201d movement against Israel, distinguish between antisemitism and anti-Zionism, and educate members about the Nakba, a term referring to the mass displacement of Palestinians during the 1948 Arab-Israeli war, according to information from both Educators for Palestine and StandWithUs. The past year has seen heightened tension in classrooms across the country, including incidents of antisemitism and anti-Palestinian hate, especially following an attack by Hamas on Israel in October. \u201cAs the largest teachers union in the United States, the NEA has a significant influence on educational policies and practices. Before and especially after the atrocities of October 7th, a number of local and state NEA union affiliates have been embroiled in major controversies regarding antisemitism and anti-Israel bias. In some cases, this has resulted in Jewish families moving their children to different school districts with a less hostile learning environment,\u201d a\u00a0release\u00a0from StandWithUs said. \u201cThe NEA must ensure a safe and inclusive environment for all educators and students, and maintain public trust in what is being taught in our classrooms. Passing antisemitic and anti-Israel resolutions would not only harm Jewish members, but also undermine the integrity of public education,\u201d David Smokler, director of K-12 educator outreach at StandWithUs, added. On the other hand, Educators for Palestine urge NEA delegates to vote yes on the agenda items, stating, \u201cAs educators, we must be open to educating each other, and learning from one another. We stand in solidarity with working class people around the world. Help us fight for a liberated Palestine, and a liberated people!\u201d A NEA spokesperson told CNN regarding the rallies, \u201cThe members of the\u00a0National Education Association\u00a0and delegates to its annual Representative Assembly are committed to educating and nurturing understanding in their students of every race, faith, and background.\u201d \u201cNEA has a deep history that is steeped in civil rights and advocating for racial and social justice. Over many decades, the delegates of the\u00a0NEA Representative Assembly\u00a0have adopted resolutions expressing our union\u2019s condemnation of war, terrorism, hate, and violence. The vast majority of NEA delegates, members, and our society want to see a peaceful and lasting solution to this conflict,\u201d their statement added. About 50-100 people came to each rally. Many carried signs and some waved flags. A group of police officers with bicycles separated the groups. Samy El-Baroudi, a business teacher from Des Moines, Iowa, who told CNN he was an organizer of the Educators for Palestine rally, said the NEA has taken stands before as it did against apartheid and should for the Palestinian people. \u201cWe stood up against so many injustices across the world, why is this one different?\u201d he asked. El-Baroudi said he has proposed a new business item asking for the NEA to determine a concrete definition of \u201cgenocide,\u201d a word he said is probably one of the most misunderstood words in the English language. \u201cWe want to have an honest, fair conversation,\u201d he said. At the other rally, Smokler said some teachers are bringing biased and inappropriate materials into classrooms and telling children what to think and not how to think. A small group of radical extremists are trying to get their propaganda into new business items, he told CNN as he stood near a protester who held a sign that read, \u201cCritical thinking, Not indoctrination.\u201d He said the NEA should be focused on improving conditions for teachers and students, not geopolitics. The rallies remained peaceful and there appeared to be no arrests.

{"id": "2024_07_03_business_former-boeing-inspector-scrap-parts-assembly-lines", "text": "A former Boeing quality-control manager alleges that for years workers at its 787 Dreamliner factory in Everett, Washington, routinely took parts that were deemed unsuitable to fly out of an internal scrap yard and put them back on factory assembly lines\u00a0. In his first network TV interview, Merle Meyers, a 30-year veteran of Boeing, described to CNN what he says was an elaborate off-the-books practice that Boeing managers at the Everett factory used to meet production deadlines, including taking\u00a0damaged and improper parts from the company\u2019s scrapyard, storehouses and loading docks. A string of whistleblowers this year has raised allegations about Boeing factory lapses, including an official federal complaint\u00a0from a current employee\u00a0that Boeing hid potentially defective parts from Federal Aviation Administration inspectors, and that some of those parts likely ended up in planes. This all comes in the wake of a series of highly public safety issues that have rocked the company. Meyers\u2019 claims that lapses he witnessed\u00a0were intentional, organized efforts designed to thwart quality control processes in an effort to keep\u00a0up with demanding production schedules. Beginning in the early 2000s, Meyers says that for more than a decade, he estimates that about 50,000 parts \u201cescaped\u201d quality control\u00a0and were used to build aircraft. Those parts include everything from small items like screws to more complex assemblies like wing flaps. A single Boeing 787 Dreamliner, for example, has approximately 2.3 million parts. Most of the parts that were meant to be scrapped were often painted red to signify they were unsuitable for assembly lines, Meyers said. Yet, in some cases, that didn\u2019t stop them\u00a0 from being put into planes being assembled, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge problem,\u201d Meyers told CNN. \u201cA core requirement of a quality system is to keep bad parts and good parts apart.\u201d Airplanes are highly specified machines with much stricter safety standards than trains and cars. Their parts, materials and manufacturing processes are highly regulated. Meyers, whose job was to find quality problems at Boeing, says he believes he was forced out last year and says he was given a severance package that he is unable to discuss due to a privacy agreement he signed with Boeing. Based on conversations Meyers says he had with current Boeing workers in the time since he left the company, he believes that while employees no longer remove parts from the scrapyard, the practice of using other unapproved\u00a0parts in assembly lines continues. \u201cNow they\u2019re back to taking parts of body sections \u2013 everything \u2013 right when it arrives at the Everett site, bypassing quality, going right to the airplane,\u201d Meyers said. Company emails going back years show that Meyers repeatedly flagged the issue to Boeing\u2019s corporate investigations team, pointing out what he says were blatant violations of Boeing\u2019s safety rules. But investigators\u00a0routinely failed to enforce those rules, Meyers says, even ignoring \u201ceye witness observations\u00a0and the hard work done to ensure the safety of future passengers and crew,\u201d he wrote in an internal 2022 email provided to CNN. Meyers has also described his concerns about Boeing\u2019s quality issues to federal investigators, a Senate panel and the New York Times. In a statement to CNN, Boeing did not dispute Meyers\u2019 allegations. The company said it investigates \u201call allegations of improper behavior, such as unauthorized movement of parts or mishandling of documents,\u201d and makes improvements when appropriate. Swirl of controversy Meyers\u2019 allegations come as Boeing faces a swirl of controversy over its safety culture, including a criminal investigation into whether it misled the FAA over its 2017 certification of the 737 Max. A total of 346 people were killed in two 737 Max crashes in 2018 and 2019. As CNN reported over the weekend, the Justice Department is nearing an agreement with Boeing which would resolve potential criminal liability. In January, a door plug blew off of a 737 Max mid-flight, prompting a wave of intense scrutiny of the airplane manufacturer, including federal and congressional investigations. Boeing\u2019s CEO Dave Calhoun has announced he will step down by the end of this year. To address its safety issues, Boeing recently agreed to purchase supplier Spirit AeroSystems. Since January a number of whistleblowers have come forward with fresh allegations against Boeing. A current Boeing quality investigator, Sam Mohawk, also filed an official complaint last month reporting \u201ca number of non-compliant parts making their way back to the airplanes for installation.\u201d His complaint with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration was publicly released by a Senate subcommittee investigating Boeing. Mohawk\u2019s complaint said the issue of disappearing nonconforming parts continues.\u00a0\u201cBoeing is still losing parts to this day,\u201d his official complaint reads. A separate whistleblower, Richard Cuevas, last week made public his concerns that Boeing and its key supplier Spirit Aerosystems used compromised parts and made changes to \u201creduce bottlenecks in production and speed up production and delivery.\u201d Pulled from the scrapyard The pressure from Boeing management to keep assembly lines moving is no secret.\u00a0The 245-page House investigative report after the 737 Max fatal crashes dedicates an entire chapter to \u201cProduction Pressure.\u201d\u00a0After the January 5 door plug blowout on a 737 Max, the FAA capped\u00a0Boeing\u2019s production line speed. Meyers describes a pressure-packed environment at the Everett factory, where assembly teams competed with each other to find the parts they needed. Meyers alleges that after hours, workers would ask security guards to unlock doors and sneak parts out of supply rooms, or remove newly arrived components awaiting quality inspections by Meyers\u2019 team.\u00a0Similar parts destined for a different airplane model were ripe for the taking. At some point in the early 2000s, Boeing employees began also pulling parts from the company\u2019s scrapyard in Auburn, Washington, located about an hour south\u00a0of the nearly 100-acre factory building\u00a0where Dreamliners were assembled,\u00a0according to documentation\u00a0Meyers shared with CNN. Nonconforming parts end up in the reclamation yard, Meyers says, only after being\u00a0rejected by three departments:\u00a0Engineering, procurement, and quality. Meyers claims that by around 2002, employees at the reclamation yard became concerned that they would be considered responsible when scrap parts were later found on an aircraft.\u00a0So, they asked employees to sign for the removals \u2013 but their homemade form wasn\u2019t an official Boeing document, which meant the removal was never recorded in the company\u2019s quality management database. \u201cThese are bootleg forms that are not Boeing authorized,\u201d Meyers said.\u00a0\u201cThe procurement organization would go down to our scrap reclamation yard and intimidate the employees there and say we need these parts bad.\u201d Lack of enforcement Meyers says he repeatedly referred violations for investigation but found the company\u2019s efforts to look into them lacking. \u201cTheir investigations are about analyzing excuses by process violators, and not taking action against those committing compliance violations,\u201d Meyers wrote in a 2002 email to corporate HR at Boeing\u00a0. In its statement, Boeing said the quality team Meyers worked on \u201cplays an important role in identifying issues, improving processes, and strengthening compliance in our factories.\u201d \u201cWe appreciate employees who raise their voice and we have systems in place to encourage them to speak up confidentially or anonymously,\u201d the statement said. Meyers says his Boeing managers did not know how to handle employees who raised concerns, and said that after decades at the company he was ultimately given\u00a0a list of management grievances with his work, and offered a vague opportunity to improve \u2013 or take a cash payout and leave. \u201cI was given a list of things to correct \u2013 it was my behaviors and my practices as a manager,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cSo it looked like a personal improvement program \u2026 but it had a financial incentive with it \u2013 or you can take this money and quit.\u201d Meyers said he never intended to become a whistleblower but is now speaking with those who ask \u2013 including a Senate subcommittee probing Boeing \u2013 to generate momentum for change. \u201cHopefully we can get this company to heal and be what it was,\u201d he said.

{"id": "2024_07_02_us_leonard-peltier-denied-parole-fbi-killings", "text": "Leonard Peltier, the Indigenous activist convicted of the 1975 murders of two FBI agents, has been denied parole from federal prison, his attorney told CNN on Tuesday. Peltier, 79, has long maintained his innocence in the shooting deaths of agents Ronald A. Williams and Jack R. Coler. Peltier\u2019s legal team says they plan to appeal the parole board\u2019s decision. Coler and Williams were killed in a shootout June 26, 1975, while searching for a robbery suspect on the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota. In 1977, Peltier was found guilty of first-degree murder and sentenced to two consecutive life terms, though he denied shooting Coler and Williams. \u201cI didn\u2019t kill those agents, I didn\u2019t see who killed those agents, and if I did know, I\u2019m not telling. But I don\u2019t know. That\u2019s the point,\u201d Peltier told CNN correspondent Mark Potter in 1999. Peltier said he fired shots during the gunbattle but \u201cI know I didn\u2019t hit them. I know I didn\u2019t.\u201d The government built its case on ballistics evidence and witness accounts from people who were on the periphery of the shootout, including Native Americans, but no one actually saw the killings. As a leader of the American Indian Movement in the 70s, Peltier\u2019s conviction has long been polarizing. He has been denied parole before \u2013 in 2009, according to The Associated Press, and in 2017, President Barack Obama denied his clemency request. During Peltier\u2019s parole hearing last month, his failing health, age and nonviolent record during his nearly 50 years in prison were all highlighted. Peltier won\u2019t be eligible for another parole hearing until June 2026, a US Parole Commission spokesperson said. \u201cToday\u2019s announcement continues the injustice of this long ordeal for Leonard Peltier,\u201d Peltier\u2019s attorney, Kevin Sharp, said in a statement. \u201cThis decision is a missed opportunity for the United States to finally recognize the misconduct of the FBI and send a message to Indian Country regarding the impacts of the federal government\u2019s actions and policies of the 1970\u2019s.\u201d FBI Director Christopher Wray said the bureau is pleased the US Parole Commission \u201ccontinued to side with the facts.\u201d \u201cNo amount of prison time will ever change the facts\u00a0surrounding the murders of FBI Special Agents Coler and Williams,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cMr. Peltier has been afforded his rights and due process time and again, and repeatedly, the weight of the evidence has supported his conviction and his life sentence.\u201d Supporters of Peltier have said the evidence, including ballistics, produced at trial was unreliable; the FBI has categorically denied it fabricated evidence or coerced witnesses. Lynn Crooks, a prosecutor at Peltier\u2019s 1977 double-murder trial, told CNN in 1999 that they proved Peltier was a participant in the killings. \u201cWhoever was down there was essentially down there under the influence of Leonard\u00a0Peltier,\u201d he said. \u201cThey aren\u2019t down there to give aid and comfort to these two injured, dying men. They\u2019re down there to execute them, and that\u2019s exactly what they did.\u201d Peltier told CNN he was in bed at camp when he heard gunshots. \u201cAll of a sudden everybody said, \u2018Man, we\u2019re being attacked. We\u2019re being attacked,\u2019\u201d he said in 1999. \u201cI says, \u2018Oh, my God.\u2019 So I grabbed an old rifle and started running up to the house.\u201d He said he fired his gun after being fired upon. The FBI has said the agents were shot without provocation. The FBI Agents Association applauded the parole board\u2019s decision Tuesday, saying it \u201cupholds justice for our fallen colleagues and their families.\u201d \u201cThe FBIAA reaffirms its commitment to honoring the memory of Agents Coler and Williams, and Peltier\u2019s continued incarceration is necessary to ensure public safety and respect for the law,\u201d the association said in the statement. Nick Tilsen, president of Indigenous activist group NDN Collective, said, \u201cToday is a sad day for Indigenous Peoples and justice everywhere. The U.S. Parole Commission\u2019s denial of parole for Leonard Peltier, America\u2019s longest serving Indigenous political prisoner, is a travesty.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/02/us/leonard-peltier-denied-parole-fbi-killings/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/04/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_07_02_us_cincinnati-jewish-cemeteries-vandalism", "text": "(CNN) \u2014\u00a0Nearly 180 gravestones at two Jewish cemeteries in Cincinnati have been vandalized, according to the Jewish Cemeteries of Greater Cincinnati and the Jewish Federation of Cincinnati. Many of the gravestones \u2013 some dating back to the late 1800s \u2013 have been knocked face-down, with some cracked in half, at the Tifereth Israel and the Beth Hamedrash Hagadol cemeteries in the Covedale Cemetery complex, a news release on behalf of the Jewish Cemeteries of Greater Cincinnati, the Jewish Federation of Cincinnati and the Jewish Community Relations Council said. The vandalism is believed to have occurred between June 25 and July 1, the statement said, and was discovered Monday morning. The FBI, Cincinnati Police and Green Township of Hamilton County are investigating the incident but there are no known suspects, the release added. CNN has reached out to the FBI for comment. Capt. Mitch Hill of the Green Township Police Department told CNN Wednesday the investigation is ongoing and no new information is available. The vandalism comes amid a rise in antisemitic incidents across the nation. The\u00a0most recent data\u00a0from the Anti-Defamation League, which has tracked antisemitic incidents in the US since 1979, found a 140% increase from 2022 to 2023, with a \u201cdramatic\u201d increase taking place after the October 7 Hamas\u00a0attacks\u00a0on Israel. \u201cWe unequivocally condemn this act of hatred and desecration. Our hearts go out to the families affected by this senseless vandalism. The Jewish community in Cincinnati is resilient, and we are committed to repairing the damage and restoring the sanctity of these sacred spaces,\u201d the federation\u2019s release said. Sue Susskind, executive director of the Jewish Cemeteries of Greater Cincinnati, told CNN, \u201cUntil you walk that ground and feel it, I mean, it\u2019s horrendous. I\u2019ve never felt anything like that in my life.\u201d While the organization has not yet been able to identify all the graves affected, Susskind said law enforcement has now granted permission for the gravestones to be repaired and inspected. Some of the gravestones are so heavy, they will have to be lifted up by cranes, she said. Two monument companies have reached out and are willing to donate their services in restoring the vandalized stones, Susskind told CNN. First, they hope to identify names and pull reports from the Jewish Cemeteries database, Susskind said. For the older graves not in the system, the organization will have to \u201cgo on the ground and try to figure it out.\u201d CNN observed on Wednesday that at least six of the overturned graves were those of US veterans.  According to Susskind, families are currently allowed to enter the cemeteries and find their loved ones\u2019 gravestones before reporting if that gravestone is \u201cup or down\u201d in order to reduce the list of suspected impacted areas. Janson Becker is one resident who came to check on the gravestones of his parents and several other family members at Covedale Cemeteries. While his family\u2019s graves were safe, Becker told CNN he felt \u201ca combination of anger and sadness\u201d about what occurred, describing it as a \u201cfeeling of being violated.\u201d But Becker offered a hopeful message to the families affected, despite the negative feelings. \u201cYou can be angry about it. You can be sad about it. But be at peace about it because this is just a symbolic resting place. Your loved ones are in a better place,\u201d Becker said. \u201cSo, they\u2019re OK. We\u2019re the ones hurting.\u201d Becker said he hopes there will be justice for the perpetrators, but added it\u2019s not his place to decide what that justice will be. \u201cI think the odds of catching them are fairly slim, and if they don\u2019t get their justice here, then they have to go through their lifetime wondering what their justice is going to be when they meet their maker,\u201d Becker said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/02/us/cincinnati-jewish-cemeteries-vandalism/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/04/2024", "section": "us"}}
