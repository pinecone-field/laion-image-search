She was 86. \u201cAs a sister, aunt, cousin, neighbor, and friend to so many, she was beloved beyond words by countless others whose lives were improved by her presence,\u201d the statement from\u00a0Barack and Michelle Obama, Craig and Kelly Robinson, and their children said in part. \u201cShe passed\u00a0peacefully this morning, and right now,\u00a0none of us are\u00a0quite sure how exactly we\u2019ll move on without her,\u201d the statement said. Michelle Obama posted on social media, \u201cMy mom Marian Robinson was my rock, always there for whatever I needed. She was the same steady backstop for our entire family, and we are heartbroken to share she passed away today.\u201d \u201cThere was and will be only one Marian Robinson. In our sadness, we are lifted up by the extraordinary gift of her life. And we will spend the rest of ours trying to live up to her example,\u201d Barack Obama wrote on X. Robinson lived with the Obamas during their time at the White House and was often spotted at events with the first family, including handing\u00a0out goodie bags to trick-or-treaters\u00a0on Halloween. \u201cWe needed her. The girls needed her,\u201d the family\u2019s statement said of her move to Washington. \u201cAnd she ended up being our rock through it all.\u201d A native of Chicago \u2013 where she returned after the Obamas left the White House \u2013 Robinson was married to Fraser Robinson, and the pair had two children, Michelle and Craig. Fraser Robinson died in 1991 after a long struggle with multiple sclerosis. Marian Robinson was heavily involved in her kids\u2019 education, according to the statement. The family recalled Robinson as having taught \u201cher children to read at an early age, sitting together as they sounded out words on a page, giving them the strength and confidence to walk to school.\u201d They also highlighted her presence in a historic moment. \u201cOn Election Night in 2008, when the news broke that Barack would soon shoulder the weight of the world, she was there, holding his hand,\u201d the statement read. David Axelrod, former Obama senior adviser, remembered Robinson as \u201cjust a great lady.\u201d \u201cShe was a South Sider through and through,\u201d Axelrod, a CNN senior political commentator, told CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer on \u201cThe Situation Room\u201d on Friday, adding that during her time at the White House, \u201cshe did not take to the whole celebrity lifestyle.\u201d Instead, Axelrod said, \u201cshe would often slip out of the White House on her own and visit with friends. \u2026 She really wasn\u2019t looking for attention.\u201d Years after the unveiling of the Obamas\u2019 portraits at the Smithsonian\u2019s National Portrait Gallery in 2018, Michelle Obama recalled how impactful her mother\u2019s reaction had been when she took her to the museum after hours. \u201c(It was) quiet and (I was) watching my mom, Marian Robinson, sit at the base of my portrait and look up at it with such a level of awe,\u201d she said when the portraits were temporarily moved to Chicago. \u201cAnd for me, watching her see me in that way meant the world to me,\u201d Michelle Obama said.

{"id": "2024_05_30_us_minneapolis-incident-officers-injured", "text": "A Minneapolis officer hailed as a hero last year was killed by a gunman who ambushed the officer as he responded to the scene of another shooting, police said. Officer Jamal Mitchell, 36, was one of two people killed Thursday in a pair of shootings that also left four people wounded, authorities said. The gunman was also killed. Police initially responded to a call about two people shot at an apartment building in Minneapolis\u2019 Whittier neighborhood around 5:15 p.m. Thursday. When officers arrived, someone shot at them immediately, and the officers returned fire, Assistant Police Chief Katie Blackwell said. Mitchell and the suspect were killed and another officer was injured, Blackwell said. She said authorities later found three other civilians who had been shot, one of whom died at the scene. Among the four surviving injured, a Minneapolis police officer and a firefighter suffered non-life-threatening injuries, Blackwell said. The other two suffered life-threatening injuries, including a person who was shot in his vehicle and another who was found in an apartment, Minneapolis police said. \u2018A hero, a son, a father, a fianc\u00e9\u2019 was killed Just three days after he was sworn in to the police department in 2023, Mitchell rushed into a burning, smoke-filled house with another officer to rescue an elderly couple. The rookie Minneapolis cop told CNN he didn\u2019t hesitate to go in. \u201cWe\u2019re not trained to run into fires, but we are trained to put others\u2019 lives in front of ours,\u201d Mitchell told CNN last year. \u201cSo when we found out possibly that someone was in that house, we didn\u2019t second guess running in.\u201d In his final moments Thursday, the young officer responded to a shooting and tried to render first aid to those who had been injured, authorities said. One of the people he was trying to help turned out to be the gunman who would kill him, authorities said. \u201cMitchell was attempting to assist the individual that shot him,\u201d Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension Superintendent Drew Evans said. \u201cIt happened very fast \u2026 he ambushed him.\u201d Mitchell \u201cwas a hero, a son, a father, a fianc\u00e9 and an officer who is so deeply committed to protecting and serving,\u201d Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said. \u201cHe would run towards danger when the rest of us would run in the other direction,\u201d the mayor added. Even though he was a Minneapolis officer for less than two years, Mitchell made a profound impact on the department. \u201cI\u2019ve never met an officer that received an award on the third day on the job,\u201d Blackwell said. And the officer \u201cgave the ultimate sacrifice to protect and save the lives of others,\u201d Frey said. \u201cWe will honor his sacrifice. We will remember his name,\u201d the mayor said. \u201cWe will never forget what he did for the people of our city.\u201d Speaking early Friday morning, Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O\u2019Hara said, \u201cThere are not words to appropriately describe this tragedy.\u00a0It\u2019s the worst call a police chief can receive.\u201d O\u2019Hara says that he had known Mitchell personally. \u201cHe died a hero,\u201d the chief said. \u201cHe died doing what we asked him to do for the rest of us.\u201d The motive remains a mystery It\u2019s still unclear what prompted the gunfire that led to a shootout and two victims killed. Police said they believe they know who the suspect was, but homicide detectives were trying to determine the motive. Witness Reuben Molina was watching TV with his girlfriend in a third-floor apartment when he heard a \u201cbang.\u201d \u201cThen we heard it again and again and again in rapid succession, and then me and her were like, \u2018Oh, that\u2019s gunshots,\u2019\u201d Molina told CNN affiliate WCCO. He said he thought the sounds came from the floor below them. Molina said they left the apartment to see what was happening. He told WCCO he kept hearing gunshots and saw \u201cpeople shooting,\u201d but couldn\u2019t tell whether those opening fire were officers or civilians. It\u2019s not clear exactly how many officers exchanged fire with the suspect, as authorities have given differing accounts. \u201cWhen officers arrived, they received gunfire immediately and they exchanged gunfire,\u201d Blackwell said. But Evans said only one officer exchanged gunfire with the suspect. \u201cA second officer, I should note, arrived shortly after officer Mitchell was injured and shot and exchanged gunfire with the subject at that time,\u201d Evans said Thursday night. \u201cHe was injured in that gunfire exchange.\u201d Forensic scientists are collecting evidence, and the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension is working with Minneapolis police to help determine the circumstances surrounding the shooting deaths. CNN has reached out to the Minneapolis Police Department and the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension for more information. \u2018This cannot be the norm\u2019 Across the country, the US has suffered at least 180 mass shootings in just the first five months of this year, according to the\u00a0Gun Violence Archive. Like CNN, the archive defines a mass shooting as one in which four or more people are shot, not including the shooter. And in the first four months of this year, at least 136 officers have been shot in the line of duty \u2013 including 20 who were killed, according to the National Fraternal Order of Police. \u201cThis cannot be the norm,\u201d Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said Thursday night. \u201cIt\u2019s now happened four times in the last couple of months where we\u2019ve had public safety officers responding to the call that people make to 911, rushing into that situation, and in this case being ambushed and a loss of life for Officer Mitchell.\u201d And even though Minneapolis is \u201cstrong\u201d and \u201cresilient,\u201d the mayor said, \u201cWe got to do everything possible to make sure that these tragic events, this epidemic of gun violence, this kind of stuff never happens again.\u201d This is a developing story and will be updated.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/30/us/minneapolis-incident-officers-injured/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/01/2024", "section": "us"}}

{"id": "2024_05_31_tech_fcc-affordable-connectivity-program-acp-close", "text": "The Affordable Connectivity Program, which helped low-income Americans get online, is no more. On Friday, the US government announced the final closure of the broadly popular federal program, which has helped tens of millions of households afford internet service, after Republicans in Congress ignored calls by consumer advocates and Democratic lawmakers to approve more funding this spring. The program\u2019s lapse threatens to throw nearly 60 million Americans into financial distress,\u00a0CNN has reported. The program officially ends on June 1, said the Federal Communications Commission, which administered the Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP) to approximately 1 in 5 households\u00a0across the country and\u00a0on tribal reservations. The 2.5-year-old ACP provided eligible low-income Americans with a monthly credit off their internet bills, worth up to $30 per month and as much as $75 per month for households on tribal lands. The pandemic-era program was a hit with members of both political parties and served tens of millions of seniors, veterans and rural and urban Americans alike. Program participants received\u00a0only partial benefits\u00a0in May ahead of the ACP\u2019s expected collapse. \u201cThe Affordable Connectivity Program filled an important gap that provider low-income programs, state and local affordability programs, and the Lifeline program cannot fully address,\u201d said FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel in a statement, referring to the name of another, similar FCC program that subsidizes wireless and home internet service. \u201cThe Commission is available to provide any assistance Congress may need to support funding the ACP in the future and stands ready to resume the program if additional funding is provided.\u201d Some US lawmakers proposed bipartisan legislation to extend the ACP in the months leading up to the deadline. But the bills languished in the face of inaction by Republican leaders who showed little interest in engaging with the issue. President Joe Biden and Democratic lawmakers have\u00a0publicly blamed\u00a0GOP leadership for allowing the ACP to end. A spokesperson for House Speaker Mike Johnson didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment. On Friday, Biden reiterated his calls for Congress to pass legislation extending the ACP. He also announced a series of voluntary commitments by a handful of internet providers to offer \u2014 or continue offering \u2014 their own proprietary low-income internet plans.The list includes AT&T, Comcast, Cox, Charter\u2019s Spectrum and Verizon, among others. Those providers will continue to offer qualifying ACP households a broadband plan for $30 or less, the White House said, and together the companies are expected to cover roughly 10 million of the 23 million households relying on the ACP. The ACP was initially funded by Congress with a one-time budget of $14 billion. Biden has asked for $6 billion to continue the program and one bipartisan bill proposed renewing the ACP with $7 billion in additional funding. Kathryn de Wit, director of the Pew Charitable Trust\u2019s broadband access initiative, said reaching the deadline without a solution from Congress was a \u201cdisheartening\u201d outcome. \u201cWithout intervention, households participating in the program will immediately see their internet bills go up,\u201d de Wit said. \u201cWe know cost is a key barrier to connecting low-income families to the internet, so without ACP we can expect most participating households to either downgrade or drop their plans altogether.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/31/tech/fcc-affordable-connectivity-program-acp-close/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/01/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_05_28_us_braintree-amc-stabbing-suspect-tuesday", "text": "Jared Ravizza, the suspect linked to stabbings this weekend at a Massachusetts movie theater and a McDonald\u2019s,\u00a0also will face criminal charges in Connecticut in connection to a killing in the town of Deep River, authorities said Tuesday. Ravizza was arraigned Tuesday in Plymouth District Court on four charges stemming from the McDonald\u2019s attack Saturday evening, including armed assault with intent to murder, two counts of assault and battery with a dangerous weapon and indecent exposure. The prosecution filed a motion for Ravizza, 26, to be held without bail, alleging the defendant was tied to another stabbing Saturday of four girls at a Braintree movie theater, as well as facing pending charges in Connecticut related to a homicide. By Tuesday afternoon, Ravizza had appeared in court a second time, where a doctor who evaluated the defendant\u2019s mental health said Ravizza did not \u201cdemonstrate the rational capacity\u201d to work with a defense attorney. The court subsequently ordered Ravizza sent to Bridgewater State Hospital and ordered a further evaluation. Sean O\u2019Neill, an attorney for Ravizza, said he had no comment at this time. The victims at McDonald\u2019s and the movie theater all suffered non-life-threatening injuries, authorities previously said. Connecticut State Police on Tuesday morning said Ravizza will face criminal charges stemming from a homicide in Deep River, which was also discovered Saturday. State troopers, responding around 3:30 p.m. to a reported disturbance, discovered a man identified as Bruce Feldman, 70, outside a home on Maritone Lane in Deep River, Connecticut State Police said in a news release. He was pronounced dead at the scene. \u201cDuring the initial investigation, Troopers developed information indicating that a second individual, who was no longer at the scene, had been present\u201d at the address \u201cearlier in the day,\u201d the release said. \u201cThe second individual was identified as Jared Ravizza.\u201d The investigation in Deep River remains ongoing, it added. \u2018Unprovoked\u2019 theater stabbing preceded McDonald\u2019s attack The two other attacks unfolded later that evening, beginning around 6 p.m. Saturday at an AMC movie theater in Braintree, some 10 miles south of Boston. \u201cWithout saying anything and without any warning, (the assailant) suddenly attacked and stabbed the four young females. The attack appeared to be unprovoked,\u201d Braintree police said in a news release, noting the girls were taken to Boston hospitals. The suspect then fled in what appeared to be a black SUV, police said, and video footage allowed authorities to capture its license plate. Soon after, \u201ca vehicle matching the description was reportedly involved in (a) similar assault in Plymouth,\u201d Braintree police said. In that incident, reported about an hour after the movie theater attack, a 21-year-old woman and a 29-year-old man were stabbed at a McDonald\u2019s. Assistant District Attorney David Cutshall identified both victims as employees at Tuesday\u2019s arraignment, telling the court Ravizza allegedly entered the restaurant\u2019s drive through in a black Porsche, stepped out of the vehicle and publicly urinated. Ravizza was \u201cargumentative\u201d with a male employee, then allegedly stabbed the employee in the forearm with \u201cwhat appeared to be a long kitchen knife.\u201d Ravizza parked the car, Cutshall said, before going inside and allegedly stabbing the female employee in her arm. Both victims are in stable condition, Cutshall added. Minutes later, Massachusetts state troopers identified the vehicle and tried to pull it over, but the driver failed to stop, state police said previously. A chase ensued, and the vehicle eventually crashed in Sandwich, south of Plymouth. Suspect is a self-described philanthropist and business owner Meanwhile, more details about Ravizza\u2019s background are emerging, including the fact the defendant was arrested last month in Martha\u2019s Vineyard, accused of assault and battery of a family member and vandalism, according to court records at Edgartown District Court. Records show the case has not been adjudicated. Ravizza\u2019s father told officers Jared \u201chad just had a mental break and attacked him\u201d inside his home,\u00a0The Boston Globe\u00a0reported, citing a police report on file with the court. The report also said Ravizza allegedly wrecked the father\u2019s home office, according to The Boston Globe. Ravizza was sent to Martha\u2019s Vineyard Hospital for a mental health evaluation, but \u201cdid not meet their standards to be held,\u201d the Boston Globe reported, citing the report. Ravizza is a self-described philanthropist, professional skier, business owner and artist, according to Ravizza\u2019s social media pages and newspaper reports. According to Ravizza\u2019s business website, Ravizza owns a digital marketing and social media management agency called \u201cRavizza Jones,\u201d which is\u00a0registered in Massachusetts. On its website, the business is described as a \u201cleading global digital marketing & social media management agency representing leading companies, brands and individuals in digital media and online marketing.\u201d Media outlets\u00a0such as\u00a0the\u00a0Martha\u2019s Vineyard Times\u00a0and SNOW Magazine\u00a0have previously interviewed Ravizza, who recalled past\u00a0philanthropy, activism and career as a professional skier. In a 2021 article, the\u00a0Martha Vineyard\u2019s Times described Ravizza as a professional skier who created a global initiative as \u201ca resource for people with autism, disabilities, and illnesses\u201d and said Ravizza \u201cworks with adults and athletes, providing mentorship and exercise, among other things.\u201d \u201cWe spend a lot of time on the Vineyard, in Massachusetts, and I just want people to know the accessibility to me,\u201d Ravizza told\u00a0The Martha Vineyard\u2019s Times in 2021. \u201cI also hope this story will inspire someone to start an initiative of their own \u2026 maybe you\u2019re someone on the Vineyard and you want to start helping people,\u201d Ravizza said. The suspect\u2019s Instagram account also includes several photos of Ravizza driving around in expensive cars, including the\u00a0same kind of\u00a0Porsche Ravizza allegedly drove\u00a0from the AMC theater to the McDonald\u2019s.

Scott Peterson\u2019s latest bid for a new murder trial comes about 20 years after his conviction.

He was sentenced to death but that was later overturned and he was resentenced to life without parole. San Mateo County Superior Court Judge Elizabeth Hill said she was only making a determination about evidence, not if Peterson can have a new trial. The duct tape, approximately 15 inches long, \u201cwas found adhering to Laci\u2019s pants on her right thigh.\u201d According to the motion, \u201ca section of the duct tape that was folded over onto itself underwent DNA testing and the presence of human DNA was found, but no DNA profile could be obtained.\u201d On Wednesday, during the post-conviction DNA testing hearing, lawyers for the Los Angeles Innocence Project who had taken up Peterson\u2019s case in January presented evidence they argued was either never looked at or simply omitted from the trial. Of the 14 items requested for retesting, Judge Hill only granted one item - the duct tape found on Laci Peterson. Peterson\u2019s defense team requested\u00a0DNA testing on\u00a0stains found on a mattress discovered in the back of a burned-out van. The charred vehicle was found one day after Laci disappeared \u2013 roughly one mile from where the Petersons lived in Modesto. The lawyers also wanted to examine evidence from a burglary that happened across the street from the Peterson home. They claim Laci may have run into the burglars while they were committing a crime \u2013 a theory that suggests she was murdered because she witnessed the burglary. The judge denied requests for those items. The prosecution argued Scott Peterson is guilty and revisited evidence that led to his double murder conviction. \u201cWe were right then and we are right now, and \u2026 [it] is inappropriate for the defense to continue to try and find the things to drag this case out,\u201d said Dave Harris with the Stanislaus County District Attorney\u2019s office. \u201cThe state of California has a powerful interest in the finality of its judgements,\u201d Harris said. Peterson reported his pregnant wife missing from the couple\u2019s Modesto, California, home in December 2002. Less than four months later, the bodies of Laci and Conner were found washed up in the San Francisco Bay. In November 2004, after a nearly six-month trial, Peterson was found guilty of first-degree murder for Laci\u2019s death and second-degree murder for Conner\u2019s death. Prosecutors alleged that Peterson\u2019s motive for the murders was to escape married life and upcoming fatherhood. The jury recommended the death penalty, which Judge Alfred Delucchi followed. Following Governor Newsom\u2019s moratorium on executions in 2019, Peterson\u2019s death sentence was overturned by the California Supreme Court in 2020. A few months later, the California Supreme Court ordered the San Mateo County Superior Court to reexamine Peterson\u2019s murder convictions because a juror did not disclose involvement in other legal proceedings, including but not limited to \u201cbeing the victim of a crime.\u201d He was resentenced to life without parole in 2021. In 2023, Peterson\u2019s attorneys filed a\u00a0petition for a writ of habeas corpus in which they alleged \u201cviolations of state and federal constitutional rights and state statutory rights, including \u2026 a claim of actual innocence that is supported by newly discovered evidence.\u201d The Los Angeles Innocence Project, a nonprofit that works to exonerate people who are wrongly convicted, later announced it was investigating Peterson\u2019s \u201cclaim of actual innocence.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/29/us/scott-laci-peterson-trial-evidence-retest/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/01/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_05_31_us_chad-daybell-sentencing-death-penalty-decision", "text": "A day after delivering a guilty verdict in Chad Daybell\u2019s murder trial, an Idaho jury on Friday began deliberating whether he will face the death penalty for killing his first wife and two of his second wife\u2019s children. Daybell was convicted Thursday of first-degree murder and conspiracy charges in the deaths of his first wife, Tammy Daybell, and two of his second wife\u2019s children \u2013 16-year-old Tylee Ryan and 7-year-old Joshua \u201cJJ\u201d Vallow \u2013 in a case prosecutors claim was fueled by power, sex, money and apocalyptic spiritual beliefs. The sentencing phase of Daybell\u2019s trial began shortly after the guilty verdict was delivered, with state Judge Steven Boyce giving jurors preliminary instructions. Jurors began deliberating his fate Friday afternoon after hearing victim impact statements and contrasting portraits of the man from lawyers. In his opening statement to the jury on Friday, prosecutor Rob Wood asked them to consider aggravating factors that would make Daybell eligible for the death penalty. First, the three murders, he said, were committed for remuneration. Daybell was also convicted of insurance fraud stemming from life insurance policies that allegedly paid him money after his first wife\u2019s death. His second wife, as well as Daybell, also were convicted of grand theft because she continued to draw Social Security benefits for her children after their deaths. Additionally, Wood told the jury, the murders of the three victims were \u201cespecially heinous, atrocious or cruel, manifesting exceptional depravity.\u201d \u201cThis defendant exhibited utter disregard for human life,\u201d Wood added. \u201cThe defendant, by his conduct, whether such conduct was before, during or after the commission of the murders at hand, has exhibited a propensity to commit murder, which will probably constitute a continuing threat to society.\u201d The prosecutor concluded, \u201cIt is your decision whether one or more of these aggravators has been proven. And if it has been, you must decide if, under these circumstances, imposition of the death penalty would be just or unjust.\u201d The verdict came about a year after Daybell\u2019s second wife, Lori Vallow Daybell, was also convicted of the murder of her children and sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. She was also convicted of conspiring to kill Tammy Daybell. Vallow Daybell has\u00a0appealed her convictions\u00a0to the state Supreme Court, with her legal team raising the issue of whether she was mentally competent to stand trial. Authorities have said they\u00a0believe Tylee and JJ were killed in September 2019\u00a0\u2013 the month they were last reported to have been seen \u2013 and that Tammy Daybell was\u00a0found dead\u00a0in her Idaho home on October 19, 2019, a\u00a0few weeks before Chad Daybell married Vallow Daybell. Addressing the jury Friday, defense lawyer John Prior portrayed Daybell as a once \u201cquiet, reserved, shy young man\u201d who grew up in Springville, Utah, a small, tight knit \u201ctown of faith.\u201d Daybell, his lawyer said, met his first wife, Tammy, and they were married for 29 years, raising five \u201cwonderful\u201d children \u201cvery deep in their faith, very deep in their commitment to family.\u201d But Daybell\u2019s life changed in late 2018, Prior said, when he met Vallow Daybell, who had already been married multiple times. \u201cEverything that glitters is not gold,\u201d he told jurors. \u201cLori Vallow glittered. She was not gold. She was the trajectory that changed the plan\u2026 Chaos hits and all of these things start cascading and this thing becomes very complicated and difficult.\u201d Prior said the new relationship with Vallow was like \u201cthis bomb dropped\u201d on the life of \u201cthe small town boy from Springville.\u201d \u201cWe have to look back at that,\u201d he said. \u201cYou examine what Chad Daybell\u2019s past was prior to the bomb being dropped, the Lori Vallow bomb being dropped\u2026 If it wasn\u2019t for that trajectory coming in and changing the path, is this where we would be going? It\u2019s not where we\u2019d be going.\u201d \u2018There\u2019s a hole in my heart\u2019 Jurors also heard from relatives of the victims on Friday. \u201cIt makes me angry and it destroys me to know Tammy was treated how she was,\u201d Tammy Daybell\u2019s father, Ron Douglas, told jurors. \u201cI find it comforting to know that Tammy is resting peacefully in Utah, buried alone and near her beloved mother.\u201d Kay Woodcock spoke about her grandson JJ and her step niece Tylee. \u201cI sit here today and try and explain the immense pain that me and everyone in my family continues to endure daily,\u201d she said. \u201cBut how do I do that?\u201d \u201cI can tell you there have been too many situations in the past few years where we were slammed with the fact that JJ won\u2019t hit another milestone,\u201d she said of her grandson. \u201cThe constant question remains: Who would he have become? What kind of man would he have been?\u201d Woodcock remembered Tylee as \u201cthe most precious, blond-haired, blue-eyed little girl\u201d and an \u201cabsolute mama\u2019s girl.\u201d Woodcock added, breaking into tears: \u201cThere\u2019s a hole in my heart, in the hearts of every member of my family, that can never be filled and will remain for the rest of my life.\u201d Tylee\u2019s aunt, Annie Cushing, remembered her walking around the house singing with \u201cthe voice of an angel.\u201d \u201cTylee had her whole life ahead of her. She had dignity, she had dreams, she had goals. This defendant stole all of that,\u201d Cushing said. Kelsee Douglas, Tammy\u2019s sister-in-law, told jurors that \u201cpain, fractured relationships and unhealed wounds are all part of the aftermath\u201d of the murders. \u201cThis is the legacy of anguish and sorrow that will haunt our family for generations,\u201d she added. Tammy\u2019s brother, Michael Douglas, lamented that \u201cthe nightmare fodder I have been provided will last me a lifetime.\u201d Daybell declined to address the court after the victim impact statements. Law enforcement found the remains of Tylee and JJ on Chad Daybell\u2019s Fremont County property\u00a0in June 2020, authorities said. \u201cIt\u2019s a sad day. JJ would have been 12 years old,\u201d JJ\u2019s grandfather, Larry Woodcock, said after the verdict Thursday. Woodcock remembered the victims, and asked the same question, over and over. \u201cWhat did they accomplish? Nothing. What did they do? They destroyed families,\u201d Woodcock said of Daybell and Lori Vallow Daybell. But the defendants, Larry Woodcock said, could not destroy the memories relatives have of the victims. \u201cThey can\u2019t take that,\u201d he added, growing emotional at one point. When he heard the jury verdict in court, he said, he felt like he couldn\u2019t breathe. \u2018Sex, money and power\u2019 were key focuses in the trial During opening statements, the prosecutor and defense attorney painted contrasting portraits of the defendant. The state described him as a power-hungry and grandiose man who would stop at nothing for \u201cwhat he considered his rightful destiny.\u201d His defense lawyer portrayed Daybell as a religious man driven into an unfortunate relationship by a \u201cbeautiful, vivacious woman\u201d who knew \u201chow to get what she wants.\u201d \u201cTwo dead children buried in the defendant Chad Daybell\u2019s backyard,\u201d Wood said in his first words to the jury at the start of trial. \u201cThe next month his wife is found dead in their marital bed. Seventeen days after the death of his wife, Tammy Daybell, this defendant is\u00a0photographed laughing and dancing on a beach in Hawaii at his wedding to Lori Vallow, a woman who was his mistress and the mother of the children buried\u00a0in the graves on his property. Three dead bodies.\u201d When Daybell \u201chad a chance at what he considered his rightful destiny,\u201d Wood said, he \u201cmade sure that no person and no law would stand in his way.\u201d \u201cHis desire for sex, money and power led him to pursue those ambitions,\u201d the prosecutor added. \u201cAnd this pursuit\u00a0led to the deaths of his wife and Lori\u2019s two innocent children.\u201d Tammy Daybell was initially believed to have died in her sleep, and Chad Daybell remarried less than three weeks after her death in 2019. Prior said Daybell\u2019s life began to change after he met Vallow Daybell, a \u201cbeautifully stunning woman\u201d who \u201cstarts giving him a lot of attention\u201d and eventually lured him into an \u201cinappropriate\u201d and \u201cunfortunate\u201d extramarital relationship. Vallow Daybell\u2019s two children from a previous marriage were last seen on different days in September 2019. Tylee Ryan was a \u201cnormal, vibrant teenage girl\u201d who loved her friends and her little brother, JJ, was on the autism spectrum and required special care, according to Wood. In late November 2019, relatives asked police in Rexburg, Idaho,\u00a0to do a welfare check on JJ because they hadn\u2019t talked to him recently. Police didn\u2019t find him at the family\u2019s house but did see Vallow Daybell and Daybell, who said JJ was staying with a family friend in Arizona, according to authorities. When police returned with a search warrant the next day, the couple was gone. They were ultimately found in Hawaii in January 2020. In June 2020, law enforcement officials found the remains of Tylee and JJ on Daybell\u2019s property in Fremont County, Idaho. Vallow Daybell and Daybell were indicted on murder charges in May 2021. Tylee was believed to have been killed between September 8 and 9, 2019, and JJ between September 22 and 23, according to prosecutors. \u201cWe are filled with unfathomable sadness that these two bright stars were stolen from us, and only hope that they died without pain or suffering,\u201d the families of the children said in a statement after the remains were found.

The decision followed an internal investigation into the former deputy, Eddie Duran. This is the first time Duran\u2019s identity has been publicly disclosed since the shooting earlier this month. A separate criminal investigation into the deputy\u2019s actions is ongoing with the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. \u201cThe administrative investigation determined the deputy\u2019s use of deadly force was not objectively reasonable and therefore violated agency policy,\u201d a news release from the Okaloosa County Sheriff\u2019s Office stated. Deputies responded May 3 to an apartment after receiving a call for \u201ca disturbance in progress,\u201d Okaloosa Sheriff Eric Aden said in a previous statement. According to the internal investigation, a woman at the complex told the deputy about a disturbance in apartment 1401 she said was \u201cgetting out of hand.\u201d Body camera footage shows shortly after Roger Fortson opened the door of the apartment, the deputy in the video says \u201cstep back\u201d before firing his weapon. Fortson was standing in the doorway with his hands down and a firearm in his right hand. Five shots can be heard on the footage. Fortson was pronounced dead at a hospital. In an interview with investigators, Duran claimed Fortson\u2019s arm was \u201cslightly canted, meaning not straight down.\u201d He described it as being \u201cin a manner so that his arm is slightly up.\u201d But the investigation determined otherwise. According to the statement released with the internal affairs investigation, \u201cthe firearm was pointed at the ground sufficiently enough for the former deputy to clearly see the rear face of the rear sight,\u201d and \u201cthe investigation concluded that Mr. Fortson did not point the gun in the former deputy\u2019s direction.\u201d \u201cThis tragic incident should have never occurred,\u201d Aden said in a Friday release. \u201cThe objective facts do not support the use of deadly force as an appropriate response to Mr. Fortson\u2019s actions. Mr. Fortson did not commit any crime.

Tammy Daybell was initially believed to have died in her sleep. Law enforcement found the remains of Tylee and JJ on Chad Daybell\u2019s Fremont County property\u00a0in June 2020, authorities said. The jury was read its instructions Wednesday morning before closing arguments. During closing arguments, Chad Daybell\u2019s lawyer, John Prior, said there wasn\u2019t enough direct evidence against Daybell and others were responsible for the deaths. If convicted, Daybell could face the death penalty. Vallow Daybell was convicted by a jury\u00a0in May 2023 of the murder of her children and was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. She also was convicted of conspiring to kill Tammy Daybell. Vallow Daybell has\u00a0appealed her convictions\u00a0to the state Supreme Court, with her legal team raising the issue of whether she was mentally competent to stand trial. Jurors deliberated for just over two hours Wednesday and will resume at 8 a.m. Thursday. 2 children and a wife died weeks apart During opening statements, prosecutor Rob Wood\u00a0described Chad Daybell as a \u201cseemingly ordinary man\u201d who wrote books about the apocalypse, a person who \u201ccraves significance\u201d and worked as a sexton in a graveyard. \u201cTwo dead children buried in the defendant Chad Daybell\u2019s backyard,\u201d Wood said in his first words to the jury. \u201cThe next month his wife is found dead in their marital bed.

In October 2018, Chad Daybell and Vallow Daybell met at a religious conference in Utah and he began to craft an alternate reality where his \u201cobsession for glory was rooted in her adoration for him,\u201d Wood told jurors. Soon, Wood said, they viewed their spouses and even their children as \u201cobstacles\u201d that stood in their way. \u201cAnyone who opposed them were labeled sometimes as dark spirits or even zombies,\u201d the prosecutor said. During opening statements, Prior, the defense attorney, described his client as a religious man who wrote books about his faith, premonitions, good and evil, and the \u201ccoming of the end of things when his savior, in his mind, is going to come back.\u201d Prior said Daybell\u2019s life began to change after he met Vallow Daybell, a \u201cbeautifully stunning woman\u201d who \u201cstarts giving him a lot of attention\u201d and eventually lured him into an \u201cinappropriate\u201d and \u201cunfortunate\u201d extramarital relationship. Prior told the jury about Vallow Daybell\u2019s brother, Alex Cox, who died in December 2019, and his history of violence \u2013 including the shooting and killing of Vallow Daybell\u2019s former husband, Charles Vallow, in July\u00a02019. The Maricopa County medical examiner in Arizona said Cox died of natural causes,\u00a0CNN affiliate KPHO/KTVK\u00a0reported. \u201cAlex Cox was Lori\u2019s protector,\u201d Prior said. \u201cAlex Cox would do anything and everything to protect, aid and assist Lori Vallow \u2026 Whenever there was a problem or a threat to Lori Vallow, you will hear testimony that Alex Cox came to the rescue.\u201d DNA and forensics experts suggested Cox\u2019s fingerprint was found on plastic wrapped around JJ\u2019s body, Daybell\u2019s defense attorney said. No DNA or hair belonging to Chad Daybell was found with the children\u2019s bodies, and the exact cause of Tammy Daybell\u2019s death could not be determined, Prior said. Couple believed they were religious figures Chad Daybell and Vallow Daybell called themselves \u201cJames and Elaina\u201d and believed they were religious figures and had a system of rating people as \u201clight\u201d or \u201cdark,\u201d a prosecutor told jurors during Vallow Daybell\u2019s trial. The state accused the couple of using their \u201cdoomsday\u201d religious beliefs to justify the killings. In particular, Daybell and Vallow Daybell\u00a0exchanged texts about Tammy Daybell \u201cbeing in limbo\u201d and \u201cbeing possessed by a spirit named Viola,\u201d according to the indictment. People close to the couple\u00a0said they had been involved in strong religious ideologies. In addition, Daybell was connected to a religious\u00a0doomsday prepper website\u00a0which described itself as a \u201cseries of lecture events focusing on self-reliance and personal preparation.\u201d The publishers of the site said they decided to pull content featuring either Daybell or Vallow Daybell after the children\u2019s disappearance. The disappearance of the children made national headlines Vallow Daybell\u2019s two children from a previous marriage were last seen on different days in September 2019.

After Vallow Daybell\u2019s indictment and not guilty plea in 2021, a judge ruled she was incompetent to stand trial, but she was deemed fit to proceed with trial after spending nearly a year in a mental hospital. Vallow Daybell has maintained her innocence. When Vallow Daybell was sentenced last year, she denied having killed her children and cited religious texts and beliefs. She said she had spoken to Jesus, her children and her husband\u2019s wife after their deaths and said they were \u201chappy and extremely busy\u201d in heaven. \u201cJesus Christ knows that no one was murdered in this case,\u201d Vallow Daybell said. \u201cAccidental deaths happen, suicides happen, fatal side effects from medications happen.\u201d Judge Steven W. Boyce said at the sentencing hearing: \u201cI don\u2019t believe that any God in any religion would want to have this happen.\u201d The judge said she justified the killings \u201cby going down a bizarre, religious rabbit hole.

{"id": "2024_05_31_politics_kansas-city-chiefs-white-house", "text": "President Joe Biden on Friday congratulated the Kansas City Chiefs on their second Super Bowl victory in two years, joking, \u201cback to back \u2026 I like that.\u201d \u201cWhen the doubters question whether you could pull it off again \u2014\u00a0believe me, I know what that feels like,\u201d the president said, welcoming the team back to the White House. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s doubting you now.\u201d Biden also tried on a Chiefs helmet the team gifted him, prompting cheers from the players and the crowd. After the president wrapped up his remarks, he turned the mic over to tight end Travis Kelce, who recalled last year\u2019s White House visit, during which he jokingly attempted to give a speech at the podium before being ushered away by quarterback Patrick Mahomes. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to see you all yet again. I\u2019m not gonna lie, President Biden, they told me if I came up here I\u2019d get tased, so I\u2019m gonna go back to my spot,\u201d Kelce said Friday. The visit carried an underlying level of tension not often felt at championship celebrations at the White House. It\u2019s been only a few weeks since Chiefs kicker Harrison Butker, who joined the team\u2019s visit to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, criticized Biden, who is Catholic, and other unnamed Catholic leaders for \u201cpushing dangerous gender ideologies onto the youth of America\u201d \u2014 an apparent reference to transgender rights. His commencement address at Benedictine College contained other controversial statements, such as calling Pride Month a \u201cdeadly sin,\u201d bemoaning diversity and equity initiatives, and suggesting women find more fulfillment from getting married and having children than from their careers. \u201cI want to speak directly to you briefly because I think it is you, the women, who have had the most diabolical lies told to you,\u201d Butker, who is also Catholic, said during the speech. Butker\u2019s criticism of Biden and the backlash to his speech led to speculation that the kicker \u2014 who wore a tie with an anti-abortion phrase on it to the White House last year \u2014 would skip this year\u2019s event. Some of Butker\u2019s high-profile teammates have distanced themselves from his opinions even as they say they embrace the three-time Super Bowl champion as a person. Kelce said last week that he doesn\u2019t agree with \u201cjust about any\u201d of Butker said but that the kicker is \u201ca great person and a great teammate.\u201d Mahomes told reporters Butker was a \u201cgood person,\u201d despite \u201cnot necessarily agreeing\u201d with his comments. The NFL has also distanced itself from Butker\u2019s comments, saying through a spokesperson that his views are \u201cnot those of the NFL as an organization.\u201d Butker is not backing down from his comments. Taylor Swift, the global superstar who is dating Kelce, wasn\u2019t expected at the White House on Friday as she continues the Europe leg of her long-running \u201cEras Tour.\u201d Swift\u00a0played a show in Madrid on Thursday night and is traveling on to Lyon, France, this weekend. The White House visit capped a particularly high-profile season for the Chiefs after Swift and Kelce went public with their relationship early in the season. It ended in an accomplishment that hadn\u2019t been done in two decades by an NFL team \u2014 a back-to-back Super Bowl championship, the fourth in Chiefs history and the third in the last five years. The celebrations in Kansas City were tragically brief. On February 14, one person was killed and 20 others were injured in a\u00a0mass shooting\u00a0just moments after the team\u2019s celebratory rally. Two men were charged with murder in the shooting, which started after a confrontation between two groups of people. In his remarks Friday, Biden said that \u201cas a country, we have to do more to stop these tragic shootings before they happen.\u201d Kelce, who had already racked up a storied career that will likely send him to the Hall of Fame when he eventually follows his brother, Jason, into retirement, became a celebrity outside the world of football thanks to his relationship with Swift. While his performance on the field dropped off as compared with his incredible 2022 season, he still played well enough to be rewarded with a contract extension that made him the highest-paid tight end in the league. For Mahomes, the Super Bowl victory over the San Francisco 49ers in Las Vegas cemented the Texas Tech alum as one of the greatest quarterbacks in the game\u2019s history, even though he\u2019s just six years into his career and is not yet 30 years old. He said last year\u2019s visit to the Oval Office was one of the highlights of his career. \u201cI mean, I\u2019ve never been to Washington, DC \u2013 I\u2019ve never even got to see from the outside, seeing the\u00a0White\u00a0House\u00a0or any of the monuments or memorials,\u201d\u00a0Mahomes\u00a0told reporters at the time. \u201cAnd so, to be able to be here and see that, and see the history of this great nation that we have, it was really cool for me to just be here and be in the moment, and I don\u2019t think I could ever really imagine it being as cool as it was.\u201d CNN\u2019s Nikki Carvajal, Donald Judd, AJ Willingham, Piper Hudspeth Blackburn, Matias Grez and Keith Allen contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/31/politics/kansas-city-chiefs-white-house/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/01/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_05_31_politics_rudy-giuliani-election-fraud-disbarment", "text": "Donald Trump\u2019s former lawyer Rudy Giuliani is one step closer to being disbarred. The professional responsibility board in Washington, DC, recommended Friday that the ex-New York mayor and federal prosecutor lose his law license because of his involvement in a bogus 2020 election fraud lawsuit. Giuliani\u2019s law license had already been suspended due to his work boosting Trump\u2019s false assertions about his electoral loss. It is up to the DC Court of Appeals to decide\u00a0whether\u00a0to permanently disbar\u00a0Giuliani. \u201cWe conclude that disbarment is the only sanction that will protect the public, the courts, and the integrity of the legal profession, and deter other lawyers from launching similarly baseless claims in the pursuit of such wide-ranging yet completely unjustified relief,\u201d the attorney discipline board wrote Friday. The opinion follows a trial-like proceeding held by a hearing committee of the board in late 2022, which weighed the ethics charges brought by the DC Bar\u2019s disciplinary counsel. Giuliani was accused of violating attorney conduct rules with a lawsuit filed in Pennsylvania that sought to throw out more than 1 million votes in the state, which President Joe Biden won in 2022. The disciplinary board on Friday agreed with the committee\u2019s findings that Giuliani had likely broken\u00a0the rules. \u201cWe agree with the Hearing Committee that the Pennsylvania litigation was based \u2018only on speculation, mistrust, and suspicion,\u2019\u201d the opinion said. The board concluded that Giuliani had put forward \u201cno facts to support the claims he made and his opinion that election impropriety occurred does not meet the requirements for filing a lawsuit.\u201d Ted Goodman, Giuliani\u2019s spokesperson, said in a statement the \u201crecommendation comes as no surprise as partisan Democrats continue to destroy the credibility of the American justice system all in an effort to beat President Trump and to hold onto power.\u201d Giuliani is one of several attorneys who face professional misconduct proceedings for aiding Trump\u2019s election reversal schemes. Earlier this week, attorney Jenna Ellis\u00a0saw her Colorado law license\u00a0suspended for three years because of her guilty plea in the criminal 2020 election interference case brought in Georgia. John Eastman, who engineered a plot to disrupt Congress\u2019 certification of the 2020 election results, was found\u00a0by a California Bar court judge to have committed\u00a0\u201cexceptionally serious ethical violations,\u201d\u00a0and his license is suspended while the proceedings over whether he should be disbarred move forward.

{"id": "2024_05_31_economy_job-market-for-college-grads", "text": "It\u2019s almost laughable at this point when Bryn Savidge gets a job rejection email. \u201cIt\u2019s like they\u2019re all using the same AI algorithm to say, \u2018Write this person a rejection letter,\u2019\u201d said Savidge, who graduated from Kenyon College, a small liberal arts college 50 miles from Columbus, Ohio, with a major in environmental science. A classic refrain is \u201cWe can tell you really want to change the world, but we\u2019ve gone for more qualified candidates,\u201d she said. \u201cThey always add an environmental quip.\u201d After applying to over 100 jobs at environmental consulting firms, law firms, nonprofit organizations and think tanks since last fall, Savidge hasn\u2019t received a single full-time offer. But she is relieved to have at least secured a summer internship at an environmental science publication. On paper, the job market looks like it\u2019s hardly ever been better. The unemployment rate has stayed under 4% for more than two years, the longest stretch of time since the early 1960s. And there are more than 8 million jobs, which exceeds the number of openings before the pandemic. But zooming in on the job market for recent college graduates paints the economy in a much less rosy light. The unemployment rate for bachelor\u2019s degree recipients aged 20 to 29 is above 12%, an almost four percentage point increase from a year ago, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data. That essentially means applicants like Savidge are competing with more people for the same position compared to a year, said Kory Kantenga, LinkedIn\u2019s head of economics for the Americas. \u201cWhile securing that first job tends to be challenging, it is especially hard now given the slowdown in the labor market over the last two years,\u201d he said. Kantenga sees the job market for college grads as \u201can acute barometer for the temperature of the overall market for workers with college degrees.\u201d When college grads are having more difficulty getting jobs compared to prior years, that could signal there\u2019s a greater slowdown happening in the economy. Since employers tend to value workers with more experience, college grads could be getting passed over by people who were laid off from prior jobs, he said. \u2018What are you going to do for your job search today?\u2019 Angela Mangione said she receives a text almost every day from her father saying something like, \u201cGood morning! What are you gonna do for your job search today?\u201d Mangione, who graduated from Colgate University with a major in international relations, said many of her classmates have already signed leases for new places for jobs they\u2019re about to start. But she\u2019s living back home in Buffalo, New York, doing just about everything she can to get a job. \u201cI just don\u2019t hear back [from jobs] until months later when I\u2019ve basically forgotten about it telling me I was rejected,\u201d she told CNN. Initially, she applied for jobs in management consulting but said a lot of positions have been frozen amid an industry-wide hiring slowdown. She\u2019s now focusing her efforts on campaign jobs, particularly on the Biden campaign, and having more conversations with alumni to continue to build her network. A bit of luck goes a long way Although Moises Brito had a high GPA and led Chapman University\u2019s Accounting Society chapter, among other extracurricular activities, he\u2019s not discounting the role luck played in his career. The internship he got with Deloitte two summers ago came through a cold apply. Not long after he applied, a Deloitte recruiter happened to show up at an Accounting Society networking event. \u201cI assume that he really enjoyed talking to me because I got an interview shortly after,\u201d said Brito, who double majored in business administration and accounting. Originally he was offered the internship for the summer of 2023. But because of a change of plans, a recruiter offered him the position a year earlier, going into his junior year. The next summer he returned to Deloitte for another internship, and at the end was offered a full-time position in the audit department. That position, however, doesn\u2019t start until September. To cover his expenses until then, he applied for summer internships at other accounting firms in Orange County, California, where he is based. But he encountered what Savidge and\u00a0Mangione have been experiencing: lots and lots of ghosting. In the end, luck struck again and he managed to secure a six-week internship at a local firm.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/31/economy/job-market-for-college-grads/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/01/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_05_25_us_primate-escape-walterboro-south-carolina", "text": "An escaped monkey recently recovered in South Carolina was not captured alive, a county official said Thursday, several days after an earlier statement said the \u201cattempts to capture\u201d the animal \u201cwere successful.\u201d \u201cI can confirm that the monkey was not captured alive,\u201d Colleton County Deputy Administrator Meagan Utsey told CNN, referring to Bradley, a 15-year-old macaque who escaped from his home in Walterboro, South Carolina, 48 miles west of Charleston. \u201cColleton County initially assisted the owner in his search for the missing animal; however, no Colleton County personnel or resources were involved in this incident,\u201d Utsey said. \u201cWe have no information related to what happened except what the owner has shared with us.\u201d On Monday, Colleton County Animal Services said in a news release that \u201cattempts to capture Bradley were successful,\u201d citing the monkey\u2019s owner. The release did not say how the monkey was captured or where it was found, but animal services expressed gratitude \u201cfor the public\u2019s support\u201d in finding him. \u201cWe so appreciate the community\u2019s support for animal welfare,\u201d the release said. The Colleton County Sheriff\u2019s Office had advised residents in a Facebook post last Friday a primate was loose somewhere in the Walterboro area. The sheriff\u2019s office said the animal\u2019s owner was attempting to capture it and called in assistance. The monkey had lived in Walterboro for the past six years, according to animal services. \u201cAnimal Control and the Sheriff\u2019s Office have received numerous tips as to Bradley\u2019s location but because of the attention this situation has caused on social media and news channels, people who are trying to get a look at Bradley are sadly hampering the owner\u2019s efforts to catch him,\u201d said animal services director Laura Clark. Professionals were hired to help reunite Bradley with his owner, Clark added. An image taken by Walterboro resident Tiffany Edenfield seems to show the primate standing in the grass. It has a red face, similar to some species of baboon and macaque monkeys. One Walterboro resident, Kordell Brabham, didn\u2019t believe his grandmother at first when she said she had spotted a \u201cmonkey\u201d in the yard. \u201cNana, I think you need to go inside, it may be a little too hot out here for you,\u201d Brabham said he told her. But soon after, he spotted the animal his grandmother was talking about. In a video shared with CNN, the escapee can be seen walking on top of a shed. Brabham was shocked and said the first thought running through his mind was, \u201cdon\u2019t get too close, that\u2019s a monkey.\u201d The animal eventually climbed down from the shed and went into a nearby yard, Brabham said. Residents had been advised not to approach the primate, which the sheriff\u2019s office said \u201ccould be stressed,\u201d and only to report sightings. \u201cPlease monitor your pets while they are outside as a precaution,\u201d the sheriff\u2019s office added. The sheriff\u2019s office had received a report of the primate \u201cattempting to attack a resident\u2019s dog in a yard,\u201d according to South Carolina news station WLTX. It\u2019s unclear how the animal got loose or came to live in Walterboro, a city of over 5,000 people. South Carolina law says it\u2019s illegal to purchase or possess great apes \u2013 chimpanzees, gorillas and orangutans. But it is legal to keep other wild animals as pets, according to the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control. Smaller primates like monkeys and baboons seem to fall outside the state\u2019s law on possessing wildlife. CNN has reached out to officials for more information.

{"id": "2024_05_31_us_appeal-to-heaven-flag-meaning-cec", "text": "Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito has been criticized for\u00a0a flag flown at his New Jersey vacation house\u00a0that has ties to both the American Revolution and far-right ideologies. The \u201cAppeal to Heaven\u201d flag, as it is commonly called, also stands outside of House Speaker Mike Johnson\u2019s office in the Capitol building and has been\u00a0proudly displayed\u00a0by other\u00a0Republican lawmakers. It has also appeared among crowds at far-right rallies and at the January 6 Capitol insurrection. Like many flags and historical symbols, the Appeal to Heaven flag has multiple meanings and has been used in differing capacities. The\u00a0flag served as a naval ensign\u00a0in Massachusetts until 1971, and until recently, flew outside San Francisco\u2019s city hall alongside other historic flags. Here\u2019s a look at its long history, and why it is controversial for some people now. What is \u2018An Appeal to Heaven?\u2019 The Appeal to Heaven flag, or \u201cPine Tree\u201d flag, features a green pine tree on a white field, with the words \u201cAn Appeal to Heaven\u201d in black text above it. It was originally commissioned under\u00a0George Washington\u2019s leadership\u00a0of the Continental Army during the Revolutionary War, a history that Alito, Johnson and others point to when defending their own use of the flag against claims of right-wing extremist views. The phrase \u201cAn Appeal to Heaven\u201d comes from a passage of British philosopher John Locke\u2019s \u201cSecond Treatise on Government\u201d that outlines his interpretation of\u00a0a people\u2019s right to revolution: \u201cAnd where the body of the people, or any single man, is deprived of their right, or is under the exercise of a power without right, and have no appeal on earth, then they have a liberty to appeal to heaven, whenever they judge the cause of sufficient moment.\u201d As for the pine tree, it became a symbol of American resistance after the\u00a0Pine Tree Riot, one of several clashes between American colonists and British royal powers that led to the American Revolution. The pine tree\u00a0retained this meaning of resistance, and has appeared on some\u00a0state flags\u00a0and\u00a0seals. The pine tree is also still a beloved regional symbol in New England. A similar flag \u2014 with a green pine in a white canton on a red field \u2014 is flown throughout the region. How the flag came to be associated with far-right politics The Appeal to Heaven flag is now also associated with American far-right movements and supporters of former President Donald Trump. The flag has appeared at Trump rallies, and it appeared among crowds at the January 6 insurrection. It is also ingrained into the\u00a0rhetoric of Christian Nationalism. However, its gradual integration into far-right politics actually started far before the Trump era \u2014 and its significance during the American Revolution is a key reason why. \u201cThis flag is part of a broader effort by the far right to recall the principles of the American Revolution and import them into antidemocratic efforts,\u201d says\u00a0Jemar Tisby, an author and professor at Simmons College in Kentucky who studies Christian nationalism. The American Revolution, Tisby says, is seen by these groups as a \u201crighteous rebellion against an unjust, intrusive government,\u201d and thus a fertile ground from which to reap symbols and ideologies for their current political aims. This theme can be traced back to the emergence of the\u00a0tea party movement\u00a0(another homage to the American Revolution), the conservative political movement that took root in the early days of President Barack Obama\u2019s first term around 2009. The Tea Party movement called for a reduction in government influence, but was also closely related to far-right populism and\u00a0racial animus\u00a0in response to Obama\u2019s election to office. It greatly influenced the Republican party and was\u00a0leveraged by Trump\u00a0during his victorious 2016 presidential campaign. Around this time another Revolutionary-era flag, the Gadsden flag, also began to see a resurgence. Depicting a black snake on a yellow background with the words \u201cDon\u2019t Tread on Me,\u201d the Gadsden flag is now a common symbol among libertarian and conservative groups \u2014 and it, too, is often flown\u00a0during far-right gatherings. In 2015, the Appeal to Heaven flag was given another boost in popularity by Dutch Sheets, an influential conservative Christian author and pastor. Sheets organized a nationwide tour that year called \u201cAn Appeal to Heaven\u201d during which he specifically linked the flag, and the American Revolution, to concepts of Christian nationalism. At a\u00a0tour stop in Ohio in 2015, Sheets invoked the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision on same-sex marriage and ongoing political battles about abortion rights. \u201cIt\u2019s not settled law until God says it\u2019s settled law and we\u2019re going to change these things,\u201d Sheets said. \u201cThere\u2019s got to be a hope that comes. If we appeal to heaven, he can turn this thing around.\u201d This, Tisby says, is another way the flag\u2019s message can be co-opted by Christian nationalists. \u201cThis is why the Appeal to Heaven flag is also a symbol of White Christian nationalism, because it links their cause to God\u2019s will as an appeal to heaven or a higher power,\u201d he says. \u201cThat way, the movement appears to transcend political earthly authority, and becomes a divine right.\u201d Recent events have shed new light on the flag\u2019s meanings Until recently, the Appeal to Heaven flag was relatively unknown in the public consciousness. When the\u00a0Associated Press\u00a0asked Speaker Mike Johnson about the one displayed outside his office, he said he wasn\u2019t aware the flag was associated with far-right politics or the \u201cStop the Steal\u201d movement. \u201cPeople misuse our symbols all the time. It doesn\u2019t mean we don\u2019t use the symbols anymore,\u201d he said. Alito said the flag seen flying outside his vacation home was selected by his wife and was an homage to George Washington. \u201cI was not aware of any connection between that historic flag and the \u2018Stop the Steal Movement,\u2019 and neither was my wife,\u201d\u00a0Alito told lawmakers\u00a0in a letter stating his refusal to recuse from cases involving the 2020 presidential election or the January 6 insurrection. \u201cShe did not fly it to associate herself with that or any other group, and the use of an old historic flag by a new group does not necessarily drain that flag of all other meanings.\u201d Alito is also under scrutiny for an\u00a0upside-down American flag\u00a0that was spotted outside his home in early 2021 \u2014 a universal symbol of a country in crisis. Alito said this, too, was his wife\u2019s decision. However, the polarizing recent history of the Appeal to Heaven flag is starting to become known. This week, the city of San Francisco made the decision to remove an \u201cAppeal to Heaven\u201d flag that flew alongside several other flags over City Hall. \u201cThis flag was originally used during the American Revolutionary War, flown by George Washington\u2019s cruisers, and is associated with the early quest for American independence,\u201d San Francisco Recreation and Parks communications manager Daniel Montez told CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s since been adopted by a different group \u2014 one that doesn\u2019t represent the city\u2019s values, so we made the decision to swap it with the American flag.\u201d CNN\u2019s Josh Du Lac contributed to this story.\u00a0", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/31/us/appeal-to-heaven-flag-meaning-cec/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/01/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_05_31_tech_threats-doxxing-trump-jurors", "text": "On online forums that have previously been linked to mass shootings,\u00a0people are threatening\u00a0violence and attempting to publicly identify the 12 New York jurors who on Thursday decided to convict former President Donald Trump. The calls for retribution began immediately after the verdict was announced. Experts who track online extremism told CNN the volume of violent rhetoric in the last 24 hours is\u00a0as high as it was after the FBI\u2019s search\u00a0of Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago property in August 2022. \u201cHope these jurors face some street justice,\u201d one anonymous user on a pro-Trump forum wrote. Another suggestively asked, \u201cWouldn\u2019t [it] be interesting if just one person from Trump\u2019s legal team anonymously leaked the names of the jurors?\u201d Anonymity is supposed to add a layer of protection for jurors doing their civic duty. Once reserved only for cases involving violent criminal enterprises, the practice is becoming more common. The judge in the Trump New York trial\u00a0issued an order in March\u00a0agreeing with prosecutors that most information about the jurors would be sealed. Trump\u2019s lawyers did not disagree, according to the order. Overnight, however, anonymous internet users on sites that are known havens of hate and harassment began\u00a0sharing names, home addresses and other personal information belonging to people they say might have been members of the jury,\u00a0a practice known as doxxing. This form of amateur online sleuthing can lead to real-life security issues. For example, a commonly used tactic called \u201cswatting\u201d involves a caller making a bogus crime report intended to trigger a massive law enforcement response to a target\u2019s residence. In the past, people whose personal information have been shared online in this way have been misidentified and sometimes have nothing at all to do with the issue at hand. \u201cUnfortunately, social media has given rise to a whole generation of amateur sleuthing that lacks journalism standards and ethics, leading to countless examples of mistaken identities and wrongful accusations,\u201d Ben Decker, the CEO of Memetica, a threat analysis company, told CNN Friday. \u201cWhile the sleuthers themselves face few, if any, consequences, the victims of these accusations become the targets of violent threats both on and offline,\u201d he added. Violent rhetoric targeting other people involved in the case, including the presiding judge, the district attorney and journalists who reported on the case, was identified by researchers at Advance Democracy, a nonprofit organization that conducts public-interest research, the group\u2019s president, Daniel Jones, told CNN Friday. Last summer, purported names, photographs and home addresses of grand jurors in Fulton County, Georgia, circulated on the far-right internet after the grand jury voted to indict Trump. Similarly, after the FBI search of Mar-a-Lago in 2022, a Florida court removed information, including the office address, of a federal magistrate judge from its website, after internet users began targeting the judge, claiming the judge had signed off on the search warrant. The volume of violent online rhetoric seen on anti-government and extremists forums in the 24 hours since Trump\u2019s conviction is as high as it was in the wake of the FBI\u2019s\u00a0search\u00a0of Mar-a-Lago property in August 2022, according to John Cohen, former acting undersecretary for intelligence and analysis at the Department of Homeland Security. The Institute for Strategic Dialogue (ISD), a nonprofit that tracks extremism, released data Friday showing that about 9,300 online postings mentioned civil unrest within a day of the Trump conviction, compared to 9,900 unrest-related posts after the Mar-a-Lago search. In September 2019, after House Democrats announced Trump\u2019s first impeachment inquiry and Trump quoted a pastor on Twitter warning of a \u201cCivil War-like fracture\u201d in the country if Trump was removed from office, unrest-related online posts numbered nearly 20,000, according to ISD. \u201c[F]alse and misleading narratives surrounding the verdict [have] the potential to serve as a catalyst for individual acts of violence and other illegal activity, while also continuing to increase distrust in our democratic institutions,\u201d ISD analysts wrote. Days after the FBI searched Mar-a-Lago in August 2022, an armed man who had directed increasingly violent online rhetoric at the FBI\u00a0tried to breach\u00a0the bureau\u2019s Cincinnati office and was killed in an armed standoff with FBI agents. Some of the violent language in the last 24 hours is \u201ca direct illustration of what concerns law enforcement as we get closer and closer to the election,\u201d Cohen said, calling it \u201ca harbinger of what\u2019s to come.\u201d Foreign intelligence services and terrorist groups will likely try to amplify the online vitriol in the coming days and weeks, he added.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/31/tech/threats-doxxing-trump-jurors/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/01/2024", "section": "us"}}

The criticism stemmed from the long and winding road ever since four University of Idaho students \u2013 Goncalves, Ethan Chapin, Xana Kernodle and Madison Mogen \u2013 were fatally stabbed in the overnight hours of November 13, 2022, at a home just off the school\u2019s main campus in Moscow. Kohberger, a Washington State University graduate student in criminology, was arrested in the killings on December 30, 2022, in his home state of Pennsylvania. A\u00a0not guilty plea was entered on his behalf one year ago this month, and his\u00a0attorneys have indicated the 29-year-old intends to present an alibi as part of his defense. Prosecutors have said they will seek the death penalty. The progression of the case has been slowed by a series of pre-trial motions and hearings, and a trial date still has not been set. Latah County Judge John Judge said in April he wants a \u201chearing at least every month,\u201d noting the importance of \u201ccleaning up\u201d the legal proceedings. The hearings largely fall into a few different buckets. One relates to the defense attorneys\u2019 access to evidence, particularly how the prosecution used investigative genetic genealogy in building the case. A second set of hearings concerns Kohberger\u2019s proposed alibi for his innocence. Third, there have be a number of hearings related to a gag order that restricts what the parties can publicly say about the case. Here\u2019s a timeline of some of the notable pre-trial hearings and decisions so far: June 9, 2023: A coalition of media organizations and the family of a murder victim came to court to challenge the gag order placed on the parties in the case. June 23, 2023: The judge denied both requests but issued a revised gag order that allows the parties to discuss topics that do not have a \u201csubstantial likelihood of materially prejudicing or otherwise influencing the outcome of the case.\u201d August 2, 2023: Kohberger\u2019s attorneys said they would\u00a0use an alibi defense but couldn\u2019t pin down their client\u2019s specific location on the night of the killings because he was \u201cdriving during the late night and early morning hours.\u201d \u201cMr.\u00a0Kohberger\u00a0is not claiming to be at a specific location at a specific time; at this time there is not a specific witness to say precisely where Mr.\u00a0Kohberger\u00a0was at each moment of the hours\u201d of the attacks, his attorneys said in a court filing. October 26, 2023: The judge denied a\u00a0request to dismiss the grand jury indictment after the defense argued there was an error in the grand jury instructions. December 18, 2023: The judge denied a second motion to dismiss the indictment after the defense argued prosecutors failed to comply fully with state rules on jury selection and the jury questionnaire. February 28, 2024: Defense attorney Anne C. Taylor asked the court to allow three defense experts and others to view the investigative genetic genealogy evidence, which has been sealed, to understand the full timeline of how police began to focus on Kohberger. Genetic genealogy is a practice that blends DNA analysis in the lab with genealogical research, such as tracing a person\u2019s family tree. In this case, investigators found a single source of male DNA on the button snap of a leather knife sheath left at the crime scene,\u00a0according to a probable cause affidavit. FBI investigators loaded the DNA profile to public genealogy sites to search for a match and then sent a tip to investigate Kohberger, according to a prosecution court filing. The judge declined to give the defense investigators extended access to the investigative genetic genealogy, saying he would rather the experts already approved to view the material give justification for digging deeper. April 4, 2024: The judge criticized Kohberger\u2019s defense attorney, saying she commissioned phone surveys to potential jurors that could hinder Kohberger\u2019s ability to get a fair trial. However, Taylor said the judge violated her client\u2019s right to due process by ordering a stop to the anonymous survey without hearing the defense\u2019s side first. April 17, 2024: Kohberger\u2019s defense lawyers filed a court document saying they plan\u00a0to offer a cell phone tower and radio frequency expert to partially corroborate\u00a0his proposed alibi that he was out driving west of Moscow\u00a0on the night of the slayings. April 19, 2024: The judge allowed surveys conducted with potential jurors to continue \u201cwithout modification\u201d after temporarily pausing them. April 29, 2024: The prosecution asked the court to deny Kohberger the opportunity to add to his alibi and to preclude anyone other than the defendant to testify as to his whereabouts on the night of the murders. May 2, 2024: Kohberger\u2019s defense had asked for an upcoming evidentiary hearing with witnesses be made public, while the prosecution asked that it be sealed. The judge ruled that it will be closed to the public. May 23, 2024: Taylor, the defense attorney, questioned a Moscow police detective about the preparation of visual cell phone logs and methods for searching for certain videos. The testimony was related to two motions to compel prosecutors to share discovery with the defense, but the contents of the motions are sealed, so it was not clear what they were requesting. May 30, 2024: The Moscow police detective leading the investigation and a defense expert in cell phone location data testified that the defense has not received some key evidence in the case. Cpl. Brett Payne, the lead investigator on the case, testified he and other investigators collected thousands of hours of video surveillance as they tried to locate a white Hyundai Elantra connected to the suspect. The videos are saved on various thumb drives, but there is no central inventory of the videos, he testified. He also said investigators did not see on any of the videos the Elantra going south from Moscow toward Pullman, Washington, in the early morning hours after the killings. The probable cause affidavit used in the case alleges Kohberger drove south toward Pullman after he committed the four killings. Sy Ray, an expert on cell phone geolocation data, testified that he has not been provided the underlying AT&T source data and list of nearby cell towers that was used by detectives to create a map of Kohberger\u2019s movements with his cell phone. Based on the data he had received, he believed some statements in the records were not accurate, and he said the missing data could be helpful to the defense. \u201cBecause of the piecemealing of the data, because of the missing data, because of data that I\u2019m reviewing that is incredibly inaccurate, everything that is missing is absolutely to the benefit of the defense right now,\u201d he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/30/us/kohberger-idaho-killings-pretrial-hearings/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/01/2024", "section": "us"}}

The \u201cGoon Squad\u201d was the name a group of deputies gave themselves because of their willingness to use excessive force and not report it, federal prosecutors said in court documents. Some of the messages\u00a0discuss brutalizing and demeaning suspects, as well as exchanging disturbing crime scene photos\u00a0and pictures of \u201crotting corpses,\u201d\u00a0the report said. In one exchange from a 2022 domestic violence\u00a0arrest,\u00a0then-Deputy Hunter Elward wrote, \u201cDid you Tase him in the face!?\u201d Fellow Goon Squad member Daniel Opdyke asked if they had shocked the\u00a0man in the anus. Another deputy said the suspect would have \u201cgotten more lovings,\u201d\u00a0seeming to indicate\u00a0they held back because of potential witnesses,\u00a0saying, \u201cAll the neighbors were outside watching.\u201d Chat members\u00a0also\u00a0\u201cdiscussed taking nude pictures of a woman they had arrested,\u201d the Times reported. Another exchange discusses\u00a0deputies\u00a0getting \u201cpoints\u201d for shooting someone. The \u201creporting on a WhatsApp group chat is believed to contain information from a former deputy\u2019s private cell phone. Since we cannot compel any employee to turn over his / her private cell phone data, we have requested the full private text thread from the New York Times for use in an internal review and analysis,\u201d\u00a0an attorney for the Rankin County Sheriff\u2019s Office said in\u00a0a statement to CNN. \u201cThere are three individuals who remain employed with this Department that were added to this private group chat by a former deputy, and none are alleged to have violated someone\u2019s constitutional rights or committed any criminal act,\u201d\u00a0the statement said. Former deputies and Goon Squad members\u00a0Elward, Opdyke and Jeffrey\u00a0Middleton all participated in the chat reviewed by the Times\u00a0and Mississippi Today. Former Deputy Brett McAlpin is also mentioned in one exchange,\u00a0according to the report. McAlpin, Middleton, Elward and Opdyke, along with former Deputy Christian\u00a0Dedmon\u00a0and Richland police officer Joshua Hartfield have all pleaded guilty to the sexual assault and kidnapping of two innocent Black men, Michael Jenkins and Eddie Parker, in Rankin County\u00a0in January 2023.\u00a0They are serving concurrent state and federal prison sentences. The planning of the assaults on Jenkins and Parker took place on WhatsApp, according to the Department of Justice. It is unclear if the group chat\u00a0referenced by the Justice Department is the same as\u00a0the one\u00a0on which the Times and Mississippi Today reported. CNN has not obtained the full group chat that was described in the report. One member of the group chat, who no longer works for the sheriff\u2019s\u00a0department,\u00a0called his messages \u201cabsolutely all jokes,\u201d\u00a0in an interview with the New York Times. Neither the department nor Sheriff Bryan\u00a0Bailey\u00a0\u201cknew of the existence of \u2018a shift of officers who called themselves the \u2018Goon Squad\u2019 until a bill of information was filed in federal court,\u201d the\u00a0sheriff\u2019s office\u00a0statement said. The statement continues, \u201cIt was also around this time we learned that the five former deputies coordinated their criminal activity via private text messaging, presumably in an attempt to avoid detection by this Department and Sheriff Bailey.\u201d In March, after the sentencing of\u00a0the former law enforcement officers, CNN spoke with attorney Jeff Reynolds, who represents Opdyke.\u00a0Reynolds noted\u00a0Opdyke\u00a0cooperated in the case by\u00a0sharing the WhatsApp encrypted text messages. \u201cThe explanation by some that they were just\u00a0\u2018joking\u2019\u00a0about torturing people in their what they thought were secret WhatsApp texts rings hollow given the multiple incidents of torture that have now been documented,\u201d\u00a0Reynolds\u00a0said Wednesday in a statement to\u00a0CNN about the\u00a0latest report. CNN has reached out to attorneys of the other Goon Squad members alleged to have taken part in the chat for comment but has not received a response. Malik Shabazz, the lead attorney for Jenkins and Parker, said the\u00a0\u201clatest revelations regarding the Rankin County Mississippi\u00a0\u2018Goon Squad\u2019\u00a0text messages are not surprising at all.\u201d \u201cFor years, the lawlessness of Rankin County deputies, especially the night shift, had become notorious to residents.\u00a0Michael Jenkins and Eddie Parker were not shot and tortured in a vacuum.\u00a0There will be much more to come,\u201d\u00a0Shabazz said. \u201cIt was just unbelievable,\u201d Angela English,\u00a0president of the NAACP Rankin\u00a0County\u00a0chapter,\u00a0told CNN, speaking about the report. \u201cWhat I\u00a0have read is extremely disturbing \u2026 we will not give up the fight.\u201d Mary Asa Lee,\u00a0communications\u00a0director for Mississippi Attorney General Lynn Fitch, told CNN in an email the office does not \u201ccomment on open investigations.\u201d The office of US Attorney for the Southern District of Mississippi Todd Gee also declined to comment on the current investigation.

After years of sporadic vandalism reports, a sergeant noticed some similarities in the incidents and began to dig deeper. \u201cWhat we had here was more than just random acts of vandalism,\u201d police Lt. Robert Chivas told CNN. Investigators determined a person \u201cbroke windows, windshields and almost stuck people with ball bearings\u201d over the years, police said in an online post. King is accused of carrying out the acts and has been charged with five counts of felony vandalism and two counts of misdemeanor vandalism, according to the criminal complaint from the Los Angeles County District Attorney\u2019s Office. He has pleaded not guilty. \u201cDuring the course of our investigation and surveillance, we did observe Mr. King commit a crime, which was firing a ball bearing from the sling shot,\u201d Chivas said. Ball bearings and a slingshot were also found in King\u2019s home during a May 23 search that resulted in his arrest, police said. King has been released from custody on his own recognizance, according to the district attorney\u2019s office. He is scheduled to reappear in court on June 17. CNN has sought comment from King and the Los Angeles County Public Defender\u2019s Office, which is representing him. It is unclear if King knew any of the victims personally, and the motive behind the alleged incidents remains unknown, Chivas said. Fabiola Madrigal Rodriguez moved to the Azusa neighborhood about eight months ago and noticed one of her garage windows was damaged \u2013 a repair that could set her back about $500, she told CNN.

{"id": "2024_05_30_us_michigan-state-trooper-samuel-sterling-murder-charge", "text": "A Michigan State Police detective has been charged with murder after investigators say he fatally struck a fleeing suspect with an unmarked SUV last month near Grand Rapids, state prosecutors announced. Detective Sgt. Brian Keely on April 17 tried to arrest the suspect, 25-year-old Samuel Sterling, but Sterling fled and was chased by law enforcement officers by vehicle and on foot, according to the Michigan Department of the Attorney General. As Sterling was running through a fast food restaurant parking lot in the suburb of Kentwood, the detective \u2013 driving an unmarked SUV \u2013 turned and struck Sterling with the vehicle, prosecutors said. Sterling fell to the ground and began yelling and groaning about pain in his back, body-worn police camera footage shows. He was taken to a hospital where he died from his injuries, the attorney general\u2019s office said. Keely, 50, has been charged with one count of second-degree murder, which carries a life sentence, as well as an alternative charge of involuntary manslaughter, Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel announced Tuesday. Alternative charges are typically lesser charges brought by prosecutors as a backup in case they can\u2019t prove the most serious offense. \u201cDetective Sergeant Keely\u2019s actions that day were legally, grossly negligent and created a very high risk of death or great bodily harm, which could have otherwise been prevented,\u201d Nessel said. Keely was suspended from his position following the incident, Michigan State Police Director Col. James Grady II said last month. CNN has sought comment from state police on his employment status following the murder charge. The case comes amid a national push for greater scrutiny of police use of force, especially against people of color. Grady announced in April the agency would investigate the fatal collision and acknowledged the pain many in the community were grappling with. \u201cAs an African American male and a father, it\u2019s not lost on me that this is the death of another young African American male following an interaction with police,\u201d Grady said. After the charges against Keely were announced, Sterling family attorney Ven Johnson said, \u201cWe applaud and appreciate Attorney General Dana Nessel for doing the right thing based on the overwhelming evidence that Keely\u00a0broke the law when he ran over Samuel Sterling.\u201d Keely\u2019s attorney, Marc Curtis, said in a release, \u201cIt is unfortunate that in this time of political correctness,\u00a0Michigan\u2019s Attorney General has chosen to ignore the facts of this incident and rely on political pressure.\u201d Video shows moment SUV hits Sterling On May 10, state police announced the investigation was complete and all evidence had been turned over to the attorney general\u2019s office. That same day, the agency released an edited compilation of body-worn and dashboard camera footage of the incident. The footage shows at least one officer chasing Sterling on foot into a Burger King parking lot when a large grey SUV veers into the lot and hits Sterling, appearing to pin him against the restaurant wall. After the SUV reverses away from him, several officers converge on Sterling and order him to put his hands behind his back. Sterling repeatedly screams, \u201cMy back,\u201d and groans in pain. After his hands are cuffed in front of him, Sterling continues to complain that his back and entire body hurt. \u201cDon\u2019t move man,\u201d an officer says. Officers ask him where he feels pain and repeatedly tell him not to move until emergency medical personnel arrive. Another officer says, \u201cWe don\u2019t want you to move your back.\u201d Sterling\u2019s family was \u201cstunned and appalled\u201d when they watched the footage, their attorney said in a\u00a0statement to CNN affiliate\u00a0WWMT. \u201cNo one person should be able to appoint themselves as judge, jury and executioner, yet deaths from\u00a0police\u00a0brutality and excessive force continue to occur too often. We will continue to seek justice for his family and hold accountable those responsible for his death,\u201d Johnson said. While the basic standard is that law enforcement officers can only use deadly force against a suspect if they pose an imminent threat of death or serious injury, this case presents an unusual set of circumstances, said CNN\u2019s Chief Law Enforcement and Intelligence Analyst John Miller. \u201cThe case will hinge on several factors: Would a reasonable person with Keely\u2019s police training believe that hitting Sterling with the car would have a likelihood of causing serious injury or death? Was that use of force reasonable under the circumstances?\u201d he said. The law requires officers to consider the \u201ctotality of circumstances,\u201d Miller noted. \u201cFor instance, in the case of chasing a burglary suspect or shoplifter, deadly force should not be used to stop them,\u201d Miller said.\u00a0\u201cBut if police located a serial killer or an armed active shooter who was running away and their escape posed an imminent threat to others that they might attack or kill, the use of deadly force to stop them could be justified.\u201d At the time of the encounter, law enforcement officers representing multiple departments, including the US Marshals Service, \u201cwere working a fugitive arrest operation\u201d in an attempt to arrest Sterling, who \u201cwas wanted on multiple warrants,\u201d Grady\u00a0said\u00a0in April. Authorities did not reveal the nature of the charges. Keely\u2019s attorney said Sterling\u2019s loss of life is \u201ctragic and can never be replaced\u201d but argued his death was \u201can accident that could have been avoided had Mr. Sterling simply turned himself in\u201d before a task force was assigned to catch him. \u201cThis accident could have also been avoided if Mr. Sterling would have simply complied with the commands of the Detectives,\u201d Curtis said. Keely will be arraigned in Kentwood district court, though the date has not been set.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/30/us/michigan-state-trooper-samuel-sterling-murder-charge/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/01/2024", "section": "us"}}

The Georgia man, Mark Andrews,\u00a0said in his 2022 lawsuit\u00a0that\u00a0\u201c2000 Mules,\u201d a film and book by far-right activist\u00a0Dinesh D\u2019Souza contained a string of bogus claims about the 2020 election, leading to\u00a0threats of violence against him and his family. Andrews said the film, which\u00a0has been repeatedly\u00a0promoted by Donald Trump and widely circulated in right-wing media as\u00a0supposed proof that the 2020 election was stolen,\u00a0had severely damaged his reputation. \u201cIt was never our intent that the publication of the 2000 Mules film and book would harm Mr. Andrews,\u201d Salem said in a\u00a0Friday statement. \u201cWe apologize for the hurt the inclusion of Mr. Andrews\u2019 image in the movie, book, and promotional materials have caused Mr. Andrews and his family.\u201d \u201cWe have removed the film from Salem\u2019s platforms, and there will be no future distribution of the film or the book by Salem,\u201d the right-wing company added. The apology from Salem came as part of a larger settlement to the lawsuit filed by Andrews. A representative for Protect Democracy, a nonprofit group that sued Salem on behalf of Andrews, did not comment on the terms of the settlement. Neither did a representative for Salem. Salem operates a national talk radio\u00a0network,\u00a0distributing the\u00a0programs\u00a0of several prominent pro-Trump personalities such as Charlie Kirk and Sebastian Gorka, to\u00a0more than 2,700 affiliates.\u00a0It also\u00a0owns dozens of Christian-format radio stations\u00a0and the right-wing political website\u00a0Townhall. In the \u201c2000 Mules\u201d film,\u00a0Andrews was featured\u00a0on video\u00a0with his face blurred\u00a0depositing\u00a0his ballot, along with those belonging to his family, into a drop box in what the film purported was a so-called \u201cmule\u201d operation. \u201cWhat you are seeing is a crime,\u201d a voiceover from D\u2019Souza\u00a0declared. \u201cThese are fraudulent votes.\u201d Salem said in its Friday statement that it \u201crelied on representations\u201d that D\u2019Souza\u00a0had\u00a0made. \u201cWe have learned that the Georgia Bureau of Investigation has cleared Mr. Andrews of illegal voting activity in connection with the event depicted in 2000 Mules,\u201d the company said. In the aftermath of the 2020 election, Trump\u2019s media allies promoted false claims that the election had been stolen by then-candidate Joe Biden. While the claims were false, polls have indicated that the lies were effective, convincing the majority of the Republican Party that Biden\u2019s election was illegitimate. Those election lies, however, have\u00a0led to legal consequences for outlets that promoted the claims,\u00a0with right-wing media companies\u00a0facing\u00a0a slew of costly lawsuits stemming from their coverage of the 2020 election.\u00a0Last month,\u00a0the pro-Trump network One America News\u00a0settled a lawsuit\u00a0brought by voting technology company Smartmatic over the outlet\u2019s promotion of lies about the 2020 election.

{"id": "2024_05_31_politics_bob-menendez-trial-halal-monopoly", "text": "A key witness in the federal corruption trial of Sen. Bob Menendez testified Friday that the New Jersey Democrat told him to \u201cstop interfering\u201d when he raised concerns about a newfound food industry monopoly by a constituent of the senator\u2019s. Ted McKinney, a former US Department of Agriculture official, said he learned in April 2019 that Egypt had de-listed seven halal certifiers in the US from approving meat exports and replaced them with a sole certifier, IS EG Halal. That company is owned by Wael Hana, Menendez\u2019s constituent and alleged co-conspirator in the case. Menendez and Hana, along with New Jersey businessman Fred Daibes and Menendez\u2019s wife, Nadine, are accused of engaging in a bribery scheme and acting as foreign agents for the Egyptian government. All four have pleaded not guilty. McKinney was a much-anticipated witness in the trial of Menendez, Hana and Daibes in federal court in New York, as prosecutors have pointed to his phone call with Menendez as evidence that the senator worked to keep the monopoly in place in exchange for bribes from Hana. The senator\u2019s wife is set to go on trial in July. McKinney testified that he was very concerned with the monopoly decision, as IS EG Halal had no experience in the industry and the transition, which would happen in only a week, would affect US competition and Egyptian consumers. \u201cWe had never seen or heard anything like this in my history in the agriculture industry and in the foreign agricultural services,\u201d McKinney testified. On May 1, 2019, the date that had been set by Egypt to go live with the monopoly, McKinney said he called the Egyptian ambassador to the US to find a solution that would not disrupt the flow of exports entirely. After not hearing back from the ambassador, McKinney elevated the urgency and emailed Mona Mehrez, an Egyptian deputy minister of agriculture, referring to the monopoly as a \u201cdraconian decision.\u201d He said he did not hear back from the Egyptian ambassador or Mehrez, but he did hear from one US senator in late May. \u201cI will never forget those words,\u201d McKinney testified of his phone call with Menendez, saying the senator told him to \u201cstop interfering with my constituent.\u201d McKinney said he knew exactly whom Menendez was referring to: Hana\u2019s IS EG Halal. McKinney said he understood the message to be: \u201cLet lie the fact that there was now one\u201d certifier. Menendez spoke in a \u201cserious\u201d and sometimes \u201ccurt\u201d tone, McKinney testified, adding that he didn\u2019t recall the senator saying \u201cplease\u201d during the phone call. McKinney said that he tried to explain to Menendez why his team wanted to stop the monopoly and that Menendez interrupted him, with the conversation ending shortly afterward. McKinney said he alerted three people on his staff to the call and prepared a follow-up email he would send Menendez to further explain his position. The \u201csole reason,\u201d McKinney said, that he never sent the email was because he learned of an FBI investigation into the senator. He put the word out within the USDA to stand down because \u201cit was in the hands of the FBI at this point.\u201d Puzzlement and frustration over Hana\u2019s arrangement with the Egyptian government did not begin at McKinney\u2019s desk, as\u00a0James Bret Tate, then a diplomat based in Cairo with a focus on US agricultural interests, testified earlier in the trial. Tate gave a detailed account of how he came to realize that Hana\u2019s new company had obtained its monopoly.

On Friday, the body of Jesse Haugen, 41, of Cambridge, Minnesota was found by crews near Curtain Falls, according to a news release from the St. Louis County Sheriff\u2019s Office obtained by CNN affiliate KBJR. Search and rescue crews continue to search for the second\u00a0canoeist, Reis Grams, 40, of Lino Lakes, Minnesota. He has been missing for nearly two weeks. The St. Louis County Sheriff\u2019s Office was first dispatched to Iron Lake near the border of Canada at 7:21 p.m. on May 18, according to a news release. Two canoes had gone over Curtain Falls in the Boundary Waters Canoe Area, the sheriff\u2019s office said. One canoeist was badly injured and two were missing. Shortly after midnight, a helicopter was used to rescue one injured person and one uninjured person, according to the sheriff\u2019s office. The injured person was flown to a hospital with \u201cserious but not life-threatening injuries,\u201d the sheriff\u2019s office said. \u201cFriends, two families and a wide circle of friends are devastated tonight by the events at Curtain Falls,\u201d the St. Louis County Rescue Squad said in a Facebook post Sunday evening.

Rescuers worked all evening \u201cuntil it was too dark to see, and are sleeping on the ground tonight\u201d to continue searching first thing in the morning, the post said. The search effort includes remotely-operated vehicles and drones, according to the sheriff\u2019s office. \u201cCurtain Falls is extremely difficult to access, and we are depending heavily on our aviation partners to transport equipment, supplies, and personnel in and out of the backcountry,\u201d added the rescue group.

{"id": "2024_05_30_us_jury-deliberations-murder-trial-chad-daybell", "text": "Chad Daybell was found guilty Thursday of\u00a0first-degree murder and conspiracy charges in the deaths of his first wife and two children of his second wife in a case Idaho prosecutors claim was fueled by power, sex, money and apocalyptic spiritual beliefs. Daybell could face the death penalty. Daybell had pleaded not guilty to the charges in the\u00a0deaths of his first wife, Tammy Daybell, and the children of his second wife, Lori Vallow Daybell -\u2013 16-year-old Tylee Ryan and 7-year-old Joshua \u201cJJ\u201d Vallow. Wearing a light blue shirt and yellow tie, Daybell showed no emotion as the verdict was read just after 2 p.m. local time. Authorities have said they\u00a0believe Tylee and JJ were killed in September 2019\u00a0\u2013 the month they were last reported to have been seen \u2013 and that Tammy Daybell was\u00a0found dead\u00a0in her Idaho home on October 19, 2019, a\u00a0few weeks before Chad Daybell married Lori Vallow Daybell. Tammy Daybell was initially believed to have died in her sleep. Law enforcement found the remains of Tylee and JJ on Chad Daybell\u2019s Fremont County property\u00a0in June 2020, authorities said. The state is seeking the death penalty. That phase of the case began Thursday afternoon, with Judge Steven Boyce giving jurors preliminary instructions. Proceedings were to resume Friday morning. After the verdict, JJ\u2019s grandfather, Larry Woodcock, told reporters, \u201cIt\u2019s a sad day. JJ would have been 12 years old, guys. For what?\u201d Woodcock remembered the victims, and asked the same question, over and over. \u201cWhat did they accomplish? Nothing. What did they do? They destroyed families,\u201d Woodcock said of Daybell and Lori Vallow Daybell. But the defendants, Woodcock said, could not destroy the memories relatives have of the victims. \u201cThey can\u2019t take that,\u201d he added, growing emotional at one point. When he heard the jury verdict in court, he said, he felt like he couldn\u2019t breathe. Deliberations began Wednesday and lasted for a little more than two hours. Deliberations resumed just after 8 a.m. local time on Thursday. After deliberating about two hours, the jury asked the court for a missing instruction related to the first-degree murder count in the death of Tammy Daybell. They resumed deliberations shortly after receiving the instruction from the court. Idaho prosecutors claim the killings were fueled by power, sex, money and apocalyptic spiritual beliefs. The prosecutors wrote in a court document that each homicide was \u201cespecially heinous, atrocious or cruel, manifesting exceptional depravity.\u201d Defense attorney John Prior in closing arguments Wednesday said there wasn\u2019t enough direct evidence against Daybell and others were responsible for the deaths. His wife, Vallow Daybell, was\u00a0convicted by a jury\u00a0in May 2023 of the murder of her children and was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. She also was convicted of conspiring to kill his former wife, Tammy Daybell. Vallow Daybell has\u00a0appealed her convictions\u00a0to the state Supreme Court, with her legal team raising the issue of whether she was mentally competent to stand trial. \u2018Sex, money and power\u2019 were key focuses in the trial During opening statements, the prosecutor and defense attorney painted contrasting portraits of the defendant. The state described him as a power-hungry and grandiose man who would stop at nothing for \u201cwhat he considered his rightful destiny.\u201d His defense lawyer portrayed Daybell as a religious man driven into an unfortunate relationship by a \u201cbeautiful, vivacious woman\u201d who knew \u201chow to get what she wants.\u201d \u201cTwo dead children buried in the defendant Chad Daybell\u2019s backyard,\u201d prosecutor Rob Wood said in his first words to the jury. \u201cThe next month his wife is found dead in their marital bed. Seventeen days after the death of his wife, Tammy Daybell, this defendant is\u00a0photographed laughing and dancing on a beach in Hawaii at his wedding to Lori Vallow, a woman who was his mistress and the mother of the children buried\u00a0in the graves on his property. Three dead bodies.\u201d When Daybell \u201chad a chance at what he considered his rightful destiny,\u201d Wood said, he \u201cmade sure that no person and no law would stand in his way.\u201d \u201cHis desire for sex, money and power led him to pursue those ambitions,\u201d the prosecutor added. \u201cAnd this pursuit\u00a0led to the deaths of his wife and Lori\u2019s two innocent children.\u201d Tammy Daybell was initially believed to have died in her sleep, and Chad Daybell remarried less than three weeks after her death in 2019. Prior, the defense attorney, said Daybell\u2019s life began to change after he met Vallow Daybell, a \u201cbeautifully stunning woman\u201d who \u201cstarts giving him a lot of attention\u201d and eventually lured him into an \u201cinappropriate\u201d and \u201cunfortunate\u201d extramarital relationship. Vallow Daybell\u2019s two children from a previous marriage were last seen on different days in September 2019. Tylee Ryan was a \u201cnormal, vibrant teenage girl\u201d who loved her friends and her little brother JJ, who was on the autism spectrum and required special care, according to Wood. In late November 2019, relatives asked police in Rexburg, Idaho,\u00a0to do a welfare check on JJ because they hadn\u2019t talked to him recently. Police didn\u2019t find him at the family\u2019s house but did see Vallow Daybell and Daybell, who said JJ was staying with a family friend in Arizona, according to authorities. When police returned with a search warrant the next day, the couple was gone. They were ultimately found in Hawaii in January 2020. In June 2020, law enforcement officials found the remains of Tylee and JJ on Daybell\u2019s property in Fremont County, Idaho. Vallow Daybell and Daybell were indicted on murder charges in May 2021. Tylee was believed to have been killed between September 8 and 9, 2019, and JJ between September 22 and 23, according to prosecutors. \u201cWe are filled with unfathomable sadness that these two bright stars were stolen from us, and only hope that they died without pain or suffering,\u201d the families of the children said in a statement after the remains were found. During the preliminary hearing, Wood said Daybell helped hide evidence. \u201cThose bodies were concealed, one of them was destroyed, they were located on Chad Daybell\u2019s property,\u201d Wood said. Prior, however, argued the state didn\u2019t \u201ccome close\u201d to having enough evidence to prove Daybell concealed the bodies of JJ or Tylee. \u201cThere\u2019s been no indication of any evidence that this act took place on the night of the 22nd or 23rd, or whatever day it was,\u201d Prior said. Couple believed they were religious figures During opening statements, Wood\u00a0described Chad Daybell as a \u201cseemingly ordinary man\u201d who wrote books about the apocalypse, a person who \u201ccraves significance\u201d and worked as a sexton in a graveyard. In October 2018, Chad Daybell and Vallow Daybell met at a religious conference in Utah and he began to craft an alternate reality where his \u201cobsession for glory was rooted in her adoration for him,\u201d Wood told jurors. Soon, Wood said, they viewed their spouses and even their children as \u201cobstacles\u201d that stood in their way. \u201cAnyone who opposed them were labeled sometimes as dark spirits or even zombies,\u201d the prosecutor said. During opening statements, Prior described his client as a religious man who wrote books about his faith, premonitions, good and evil, and the \u201ccoming of the end of things when his savior, in his mind, is going to come back.\u201d  Chad Daybell and Vallow Daybell called themselves \u201cJames and Elaina\u201d and believed they were religious figures and had a system of rating people as \u201clight\u201d or \u201cdark,\u201d a prosecutor told jurors during Vallow Daybell\u2019s trial. The state accused the couple of using their \u201cdoomsday\u201d religious beliefs to justify the killings. In particular, Daybell and Vallow Daybell\u00a0exchanged texts about Tammy Daybell \u201cbeing in limbo\u201d and \u201cbeing possessed by a spirit named Viola,\u201d according to the indictment. People close to the couple\u00a0said they had been involved in strong religious ideologies. In addition, Daybell was connected to a religious\u00a0doomsday prepper website\u00a0called \u201cPreparing a People,\u201d which described itself as a \u201cseries of lecture events focusing on self-reliance and personal preparation.\u201d The publishers of the site said they decided to pull content featuring either Daybell or Vallow Daybell after the children\u2019s disappearance. Defense points to Vallow Daybell\u2019s brother Prior told the jury about Vallow Daybell\u2019s now-deceased brother, Alex Cox, who\u00a0died in December 2019, and his history of violence \u2013 including the shooting and killing of Vallow Daybell\u2019s former husband, Charles Vallow, in July\u00a02019. The Maricopa County medical examiner in Arizona said Cox died of natural causes,\u00a0CNN affiliate KPHO/KTVK\u00a0reported. \u201cAlex Cox was Lori\u2019s protector,\u201d Prior said. \u201cAlex Cox would do anything and everything to protect, aid and assist Lori Vallow \u2026 Whenever there was a problem or a threat to Lori Vallow, you will hear testimony that Alex Cox came to the rescue.\u201d DNA and forensics experts suggested Cox\u2019s fingerprint was found on plastic wrapped around JJ\u2019s body, Daybell\u2019s defense attorney said.  No DNA or hair belonging to Chad Daybell was found with the children\u2019s bodies, and the exact cause of Tammy Daybell\u2019s death could not be determined, Prior said. How it compares to Vallow Daybell\u2019s trial After Vallow Daybell\u2019s indictment and not guilty plea in 2021, a judge ruled she was incompetent to stand trial, but she was deemed fit to proceed with trial after spending nearly a year in a mental hospital. Vallow Daybell has maintained her innocence. When\u00a0Vallow Daybell was sentenced last year, she denied having killed her children and cited religious texts and beliefs. She said she had spoken to Jesus, her children and her husband\u2019s wife after their deaths and said they were \u201chappy and extremely busy\u201d in heaven. \u201cJesus Christ knows that no one was murdered in this case,\u201d Vallow Daybell said. \u201cAccidental deaths happen, suicides happen, fatal side effects from medications happen.\u201d Judge Steven W. Boyce said at the sentencing hearing: \u201cI don\u2019t believe that any God in any religion would want to have this happen.\u201d The judge said she justified the killings \u201cby going down a bizarre, religious rabbit hole. And clearly you are still down there.\u201d Vallow Daybell has\u00a0appealed her convictions\u00a0to the state Supreme Court, with her legal team raising the issue of whether Vallow Daybell was mentally competent to stand trial.

Michelle Troconis, the ex-girlfriend of Fotis Dulos, who was charged with his wife\u2019s\u00a0murder\u00a0but\u00a0died by an apparent suicide\u00a0in January 2020 before he went to trial, was also sentenced to five years of probation for her involvement in the disappearance and murder of Jennifer Dulos. Troconis was found guilty in March of one count of conspiracy to commit murder, one count of hindering prosecution, two counts of conspiracy to commit tampering with physical evidence and two counts of tampering with physical evidence. She had pleaded not guilty. After Troconis received her sentence, her attorney told the court they intended to appeal. Troconis had dated Fotis Dulos, who was charged with murder, felony murder and kidnapping before he was found dead in January 2020. Jennifer Dulos\u00a0was last seen in May 2019\u00a0after dropping her children off at school. Friends reported her missing after she failed to show up for appointments and had no communication with them for 10 hours.\u00a0She was in the middle of a contentious divorce and custody battle with Fotis Dulos at the time of her disappearance, CNN has previously reported. Despite her body never being found, Dulos was officially pronounced dead through a declaration of death by a Connecticut judge in October 2023, a court document shows. She likely suffered a combination of\u00a0\u201ctraumatic, blunt-force injuries,\u201d\u00a0according to the state\u2019s chief medical examiner. Authorities found a bloodlike stain in three places on her vehicle, which was parked in her garage in New Canaan. Her DNA was found in the stains and on the garage wall and door. Both Fotis Dulos and Troconis were previously arrested on suspicion of evidence tampering in the disappearance. They pleaded not guilty to evidence tampering after investigators found a \u201cbloodlike substance\u201d with Jennifer Dulos\u2019 DNA in a truck he had access to the day she disappeared. Jennifer Dulos had told officials she was afraid of him before her disappearance, according to court documents obtained by CNN. \u201cI know that filing for divorce and filing this motion will enrage him,\u201d she said, according to the documents. \u201cI know he will retaliate by trying to harm me in some way.\u201d \u2018She was the best mom\u2019 During Troconis\u2019 sentencing Friday, Dulos\u2019 loved ones were present in court and gave emotional victim impact statements. \u201cThe day Jennifer disappeared, I knew something terrible had happened,\u201d Gloria Farber, Jennifer\u00a0Dulos\u2019 mother, said during her victim impact statement. \u201cI loved Jennifer since the day she was born,\u201d Melissa Farber, Jennifer\u00a0Dulos\u2019 sister, said during her victim impact statement. \u201cI miss Jennifer\u2019s intelligence, her soft, sweet voice, and the sound of her laughter.

Tibet Ergul and his co-defendant Chance Brannon used a Molotov cocktail in March 2022 to damage a Planned Parenthood clinic in Costa Mesa, a city in Orange County, California, because it provided reproductive health services, the US Attorney\u2019s Office for the Central District of California said\u00a0in a news release. Another man, Xavier Batten, was recently sentenced for allegedly advising the pair on how to use the Molotov cocktail. \u201cThis defendant\u2019s hatred toward others led him to plotting and carrying out violence,\u201d said United States Attorney Martin Estrada. \u201cWe will not allow bigoted intolerance to divide us. My office will continue to aggressively investigate and prosecute crimes motivated by hate in order to keep our community safe.\u201d They also planned to attack an electrical substation with firearms or a Molotov cocktail \u201cto debilitate Orange County\u2019s power grid,\u201d the release said. At another point, Ergul had sent Brannon a letter saying: \u201cThe rifle is in a box in my room waiting to be used in the upcoming race war,\u201d according to the US Attorney\u2019s Office. And in the summer of 2023, Ergul and Brannon discussed and researched how to attack the Dodger Stadium parking lot or electrical room on a night celebrating LGBTQ pride, including by using a device that could be detonated remotely, Ergul said in his plea agreement. Ergul pleaded guilty on February 29 to one felony count of conspiracy to damage an energy facility and one misdemeanor count of intentional damage to a reproductive health services facility, the release said. In addition to the prison sentence, Ergul is also required to pay $1,000 in restitution. Ergul\u2019s attorney Sheila Mojtehedi said in an email to CNN that her client \u201cappreciates the government and the Court\u2019s consideration.\u201d \u201cHe looks forward to closing this chapter and moving on with his life,\u201d Mojtehedi said. \u201cMr. Ergul chose violence and destruction while targeting a wide array of innocent victims with whom he disagreed ideologically, putting their lives at risk,\u201d said Amir Ehsaei, the Acting Assistant Director in Charge of the FBI\u2019s Los Angeles Field Office, in a statement. The sentence will \u201cprevent further acts of violence by Mr. Ergul,\u201d said Special Agent in Charge Todd Battaglia of the NCIS Marine West Field Office. How the alleged firebombing happened Ergul and Brannon, who at the time was an active-duty US Marine, \u201cwanted to make a statement about abortion, scare pregnant women away from obtaining abortions, deter doctors, staff, and employees at the clinic from providing abortions, and intimidate the clinic\u2019s patients,\u201d the release said. They allegedly assembled the Molotov cocktail in Ergul\u2019s garage on March 12, 2022. On the morning of March 13 \u2013 disguised in dark clothing, masks, hoods and gloves \u2013 the two allegedly ignited the Molotov cocktail and threw it at the clinic\u2019s entrance, starting a fire. Because of the damage, the clinic was forced to temporarily close and reschedule approximately 30 patient appointments, according to the release. Ergul said in his plea agreement that in June 2022 \u2013 following the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to overturn\u00a0Roe v. Wade \u2013 he and Brannon planned to use a second Molotov cocktail to attack another Planned Parenthood clinic, but they abandoned their plan after seeing law enforcement near the clinic, according to the attorney\u2019s office. Ergul has been in federal custody since June 2023, and was the final defendant to be sentenced in the case. Last month, Brannon was\u00a0sentenced\u00a0to nine years in federal prison for his role. He pleaded guilty in November 2023 to one count of conspiracy, one count of malicious destruction of property by fire and explosives, one count of possession of an unregistered destructive device and one count of intentionally damaging a reproductive health services facility in violation of the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act. On May 13, Batten, 21, of Florida, was sentenced to 3.5 years in federal prison for advising Ergul and Brannon on how to construct the Molotov cocktail used in the Planned Parenthood attack. He had pleaded guilty on January 19 to one count of possession of an unregistered destructive device and one count of intentional damage to a reproductive health services facility.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/30/us/man-convicted-in-2022-firebombing-of-planned-parenthood-clinic-gets-6-years-in-prison/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/01/2024", "section": "us"}}
