A 26-year-old man was bitten by a shark off New Smyrna Beach, Florida, on Friday, the second shark bite reported on the Florida beach during the Independence Day holiday week. The man, visiting from Sarasota, was bitten around 4:15 p.m. Friday on his left foot while floating in an inner tube in water 5 feet deep, according to Tamra Malphurs, interim director for Volusia County Beach Safety Ocean Rescue. He was transported to the hospital for further treatment. This bite came almost 24 hours after a 21-year-old from Ohio was bitten at New Smyrna Beach while playing football in knee-deep water Thursday afternoon,\u00a0according to Volusia County Beach Safety Ocean Rescue. Both men\u2019s injuries were not life-threatening, Malphurs said. In Texas, four people encountered a shark as they took to the waters off South Padre Island on the Independence Day holiday. \u201cDetails at this time indicate that two people were bitten and two people encountered the shark but were not seriously injured,\u201d the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department said in a statement. The two bite victims were taken to Valley Regional Medical Center in Brownsville, where one is being treated and the other has been flown out for further treatment, the department said. The third person was injured \u2013 but not seriously \u2013 while trying to assist one of the bite victims, the department told CNN. It is unclear exactly how they were hurt. Another beachgoer said they felt a shark brush against them as it swam by, the department said. \u201cShark encounters of this nature are not a common occurrence in Texas,\u201d the statement noted. \u201cWhen bites from sharks do occur, they are usually a case of mistaken identity by sharks looking for food.\u201d Earlier, Texas Parks and Wildlife Department Game Warden Captain Chris Dowdy told CNN affiliate KRGV at least four shark-related incidents had been reported at South Padre Island. The attacks were likely associated with the same shark, which later swam to open waters, he said. Two off-duty Border Patrol agents from the Search, Trauma and Rescue Unit pulled one of the victims out of the water and applied a tourniquet to their leg, according to a US Customs and Border Protection official. \u201cOur hearts and prayers are with the injured and their families, and we hope for a speedy recovery,\u201d South Padre Island Mayor Patrick McNulty said. One of the attacks was reported to the South Padre Island Police Department at 11 a.m., the city\u2019s Public Information Officer Nikki Soto told CNN. Officers provided immediate treatment and transported the male victim to a hospital, Soto said. South Padre Island Beach authorities have been patrolling the shoreline and using drones to watch for the shark, she said. Nereyda Bazaldua told CNN her daughter was one of those bitten Thursday. Bazaldua said her two teenage daughters were in shallow, knee-deep water near the shore playing on boogie boards when they began screaming, \u201cShark!\u201d When her 18-year-old daughter Victoria came out of the water, Bazaldua said she \u201ccould see some blood coming down her leg,\u201d Bazaldua said. Thankfully, she said, Victoria\u2019s injuries were minor. \u201cThe shark pushed into her, five to six of his teeth scratched her leg,\u201d Bazaldua said. \u201cThe wounds aren\u2019t deep.\u201d She said the shark lingered in the water for 20 to 30 minutes before moving along. \u201cWe never saw the shark \u2018til he was right there with them,\u201d Balzadua said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t choppy water, and the seas were calm. He showed up out of nowhere.\u201d A Texas Department of Public Safety helicopter flew low over South Padre Island and used deterrence measures to keep the shark from getting close to shore after the encounters, a spokesperson said. \u201cThe Texas Department of Public Safety\u2019s Aircraft Division responded to South Padre Island to assist local authorities with a shark attack,\u201d Lt. Chris Olivarez said. Olivarez shared with CNN video taken from the helicopter that showed a shark lurking in the waters and swimming against the waves Thursday afternoon. \u201cDPS remained on scene until the shark was no longer a threat,\u201d Olivarez said. According to the International Shark Attack File, run out of the University of Florida, there have been fewer than 10 shark bites reported in Texas since 2012. This places the Lone Star State behind Florida, which has had 259 reported bites; Hawaii, which has had 76; South Carolina, which has had 45; North Carolina, which has had 31; and California, which has had 29. South Padre Island is about 100 miles from Padre Island National Seashore, at the opposite end of what used to be one continuous island, according to the National Park Service. Padre Island (also known as North Padre Island) is the longest stretch of undeveloped barrier island in the world, with 70 miles of protected coastline, the park service said. It divides the Gulf of Mexico from the Laguna Madre.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/04/us/south-padre-island-shark-bites/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/07/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_07_04_us_fireworks-july-4-essay-cec", "text": "My pregnant mom was certain she knew how things would go that night. It was late afternoon, but she already had movie tickets in her pocket. I wasn\u2019t due for another month. And my parents were excited to see \u201cStar Trek II: The Wrath of Khan\u201d in a few hours. But I surprised my family with a different sort of spectacle. My mom\u2019s water broke while she was washing the dishes that day. And I made my entrance on July 4, just after 10 p.m., when surely a few fireworks were still lighting up the Chicago sky. The idea that I burst into the world during the event\u2019s finale is a bit of family lore I\u2019ve always loved retelling. For decades, the beauty and fun of fireworks were deeply intertwined with the way I saw my country and myself. To me, these were facts as indisputable as the wetness of water or the blueness of the sky. But I see things differently now. And that\u2019s something I never expected. Fireworks were a huge part of my \u20184th of July Baby\u2019 identity Growing up, it\u2019s not an overstatement to say no one loved going to see July 4 fireworks more than I did. Yes, it was a bit of a blow to my only-child, millennial mentality to learn at a young age that all the festivities that day weren\u2019t just for me. But I quickly learned to love sharing my 4th of July birthday with America. It\u2019s amazing for most of your loved ones to have the day off on your birthday, and for everyone around you to be celebrating. Gifts emblazoned with American flags became a beloved part of my birthday repertoire, from earrings to T-shirts to teddy bears. I loved flaunting my patriotism. As a toddler, I learned to belt out \u201cGod Bless America,\u201d \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner\u201d and, of course, \u201cI\u2019m a Yankee Doodle Dandy.\u201d More than anything, I loved going with my family to watch the fireworks. There was nothing like the feeling of seeing colors burst into the sky as the symphony played the triumphant finale of the 1812 Overture. The boom of the cannons was thrilling. And the way those extra sparkly golden fireworks crackled gave me the good kind of goosebumps. Even when it was clear the show had ended, I\u2019d look upward toward the wisps of smoke in the atmosphere and hope there might still be more. As I grew older and life got busier, my birthday celebrations became more muted. Sometimes I\u2019d have to work. Sometimes there wasn\u2019t time to plan a party. But no matter, what, I\u2019d have one requirement. \u201cAll I want is to see at least one firework in the sky,\u201d was a refrain I repeated many times when asked how I planned to celebrate. On my 35th birthday, that\u2019s just what I said. And my boyfriend granted that wish, taking me to see a lovely firework display in a town square outside Atlanta. We watched children playing with sparklers and listened to a concert band play as dusk fell. It was as idyllic an American night as anyone could have imagined. But the next day I\u2019d learn that a family I knew had a very different experience that night, only a few miles away. It was their first July 4 in America I first met Abdalla Munye and his family in January 2017, days after the Trump administration\u2019s travel ban went into effect. Abdalla, his wife Habibo and seven children who made the journey with them had only been living in the US for a few days. These Somali refugees were supposed to be starting their new lives, but instead found themselves at a press conference, sobbing in front of strangers. Because of the travel ban, they feared they might never see their daughter, Batulo, again. Officials had booked her on a separate flight a few days after theirs, and the surprise travel ban left her stranded in a refugee camp in Kenya. I spent weeks alongside the family, chronicling how the travel ban affected them. When courts blocked the policy and Batulo finally made it to the US nearly a month later, I was with them at the Atlanta airport and was able to share the story of their reunion with millions of people. Knowing that moment would mark the end of one journey and the beginning of another, we stayed in touch, and I kept visiting them for months so I could tell the story of their first year in America. That\u2019s when an unexpected conversation we had opened my eyes to a reality I\u2019d never considered. I visited Abdalla and his family the day after my birthday, on July 5, 2017, and I still remember how struck I was by what he said. I\u2019d expected him to tell me his family had spent their first Independence Day in America having a cookout, or maybe watching a parade, or gazing in wonder as beautiful fireworks illuminated the sky. But when I asked how their July 4 had been, Abdalla said they\u2019d spent the night hiding in the dark in their apartment, afraid to go outside. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d I asked, naively. Abdalla told me the sounds they\u2019d heard outside made them think of the night when their oldest daughter had been raped and murdered. Memories of war and bloodshed and tragedy raced through his mind. He\u2019d been taught in his refugee orientation that July 4 was a time for celebration in the United States, but he couldn\u2019t believe that\u2019s what was unfolding around them. For Abdalla, there was only one possibility. The dangers they\u2019d fled had found them here, too. In my steno pad, I jotted down Abdalla\u2019s description of the experience. \u201cIt sounded,\u201d he said, \u201clike Somalia.\u201d What a series of panicked text messages reminded me Six months later, on New Year\u2019s Eve, I got a series of frantic WhatsApp message from Abdalla that I\u2019ll never forget. Hello! This is Abdalla how are you doing I hope u doing good, how is the weather today does it change like Somalia we had some booms in our area what is going on we almost to run, don\u2019t forget when u are running tell us too to run on our side. At first, I was puzzled by what he\u2019d written. Then I thought back to our conversation in July. New Year\u2019s revelry was frightening his family the same way Independence Day festivities had. He was asking me what I was hearing on the other side of town. And he wanted me to alert him if I was fleeing, so his family would be able to escape in time, too. I tried writing a brief explanation to reassure him. And I sent a photo of fireworks, too. Abdalla\u2019s English had improved so much since his arrival, but he was still learning. I hoped the image would calm his fears and clarify any confusion in case something had gotten lost in translation. \u201cHere people sometimes celebrate the New Year with fireworks\u2026you don\u2019t need to run! How are you doing?\u201d His response made it clear he was unconvinced. Am fine but u say that it sounds like booms it\u2019s not the way u think. And it is night and why are they booming night time. \u201cIt is just a tradition for some people. \u2026 I know it is scary to hear,\u201d I wrote. \u201cHopefully it will stop soon and you can get some rest.\u201d Ok let us pray to God in the morning to wake up peacefully with kids. The idea that fireworks had inspired this exchange was a sobering reminder that\u2019s stuck with me ever since. By the time my next birthday rolled around, so much had changed in my life. I\u2019d moved to the Washington, DC area, and it had been months since I\u2019d spoken with Abdalla and his family. I watched fireworks with my fianc\u00e9 from an apartment rooftop, and I laughed as I heard my friend\u2019s son gleefully shouting, \u201cHi, fireworks!\u201d as they lit up the horizon. But in my mind, I heard Abdalla\u2019s voice, too, even though he was hundreds of miles away. The way I celebrate July 4 has changed I have thought about my conversations with Abdalla and his family many times over the years. The visual beauty of fireworks still wows me. But every July 4, I now find myself closing my eyes for a few moments, and hearing how those same sounds could so easily be a very different kind of explosion. I think about how lucky I have been to live my whole life without a shred of doubt that the boom of a firework was a sound of celebration. And I think about how so many others have stories like Abdalla\u2019s. The UN refugee agency estimates there are now more 117 million forcibly displaced people in the world \u2014 roughly equal to a third of the entire US population. I think back on my mom, washing the dishes 42 years ago, with movie tickets in her pocket and no doubt in her mind about what that July 4 had in store. Until everything changed in an instant. So many times, we are so certain about our futures, only to find out something unexpected awaits us. That\u2019s the beauty and the terror of living. Abdalla never expected people in his own family to be killed as armed groups ravaged the Somali countryside. He never expected to be forced by war to flee his home. He never expected a US president\u2019s decision would throw his life into chaos. He never expected to end up on the other side of the world, hiding in his apartment with the lights off in the place where he thought he\u2019d be safe. I don\u2019t speak with Abdalla as regularly as I once did when writing about his family. But I try to stay in touch with people who\u2019ve trusted me to help share their stories. It\u2019s been more than seven years since we first met, and Abdalla and I still exchange text messages every so often. He sent me photos of Batulo\u2019s wedding. After my own daughter was born a few years ago, I sent him pictures of our family, too. He wrote to me recently to ask how my daughter was doing. And I asked him about his family and their plans for July 4 this year. They now live in Kentucky, where Abdalla works for Amazon sorting clothing returns. These days, Abdalla says his family is more prepared for July 4. \u201cWe are used to it,\u201d he says. \u201cIn America we see people celebrating it. And we also changed.\u201d America is their country now, too. And Abdalla says his family has grown accustomed to watching their neighbors lighting fireworks. \u201cThat is how we celebrate with them,\u201d he says. But still, his family stays inside to be safe, watching from behind the windows of their home. I haven\u2019t had a chance to make plans for my birthday this year. But I\u2019m hoping to see at least one firework in the sky. When I do, I\u2019ll think of Abdalla and his family, and I\u2019ll think of this country \u2014 our country \u2014 and how lucky we are to share it.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/04/us/fireworks-july-4-essay-cec/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/07/2024", "section": "us"}}

Foster County Emergency Management Director Andrew Kirking told CNN 911 was notified about the train derailment in the small town of Bordulac, about 140 miles northwest of Fargo, between 3:30 a.m. and 4 a.m. local time. Kirking said the train was carrying \u201cintact hazardous materials,\u201d so authorities have been monitoring air quality near the incident. Between 25 and 30 cars derailed. The North Dakota Department of Environmental Quality told CNN the train was carrying anhydrous ammonia, sulfur and methanol. Anhydrous ammonia, a gas widely used as a nitrogen-based fertilizer, can be extremely dangerous in high quantities, triggering explosions and causing dehydration and severe burns in humans, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In a\u00a0Facebook post, the department said it is monitoring the remediation and cleanup of the derailment. Kirking added local crews, including the Carrington Fire Department, regional hazardous material officials and Canadian Pacific also responded to the scene. Crews will work through the night Friday to extinguish the fires, cool the rail cars and remove hazardous material from them, Kirking said in a statement. They\u2019re also preparing the site for heavy equipment to remove the rail\u00a0cars. The county is working to keep residents safe, stabilize the incident and minimize environmental impact, Kirking said Friday night. Canadian Pacific Kansas City, the train operator, said in a statement provided Friday to CNN the company \u201cis continuing its comprehensive, coordinated response\u201d to the derailment in collaboration with local officials. The statement continued: \u201cCPKC response crews, including senior officers from our operations, environmental and hazardous materials teams, are on scene coordinating closely with emergency response officials. The safety of the public and emergency responders is CPKC\u2019s first priority.\u201d Crews are trying to bridge a gap over a bog to fight the fires and get heavy equipment to move the train cars, Kirking told CNN. They used two pumping trailers to douse the derailed\u00a0cars, he said. \u201cOur objective is to get the fire out in the next 12 to 18 hours,\u201d Kirking said. \u201cWe are starting to get a little water on it right now.\u201d Kirking said getting the train cars removed will be a bit more tedious and will likely take more than a week or two. He said all residents within a one-mile radius of the derailment were notified of the incident and potential hazards. Consequently, Kirking said, they have issued a voluntary evacuation. The cause of the derailment is still under investigation, he said, adding the engineer and conductor were the only people on board the train and they escaped safely. \u201cRight now, based on the elevation, we think that the spill material can be contained around those railroad tracks and will not impact any water source,\u201d Kirking said. Kirking said it is too early to tell if the hazardous material has leaked into any waterways, but an environmental crew is coming out to set up to prevent any pollution. In a\u00a0post on X, the National Transportation Safety Board said it is investigating the derailment.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/05/us/north-dakota-train-derailment/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/07/2024", "section": "us"}}

Elizabeth Wolf, 42,\u00a0who\u00a0was arrested on May 19 in connection with the accusations in the Dallas-area city of Euless, had been charged with attempted capital murder of a person under 10 years old and injury to a child, but was released after posting bail. During a subsequent bond hearing on June 27, her bond for the attempted capital murder charge was increased to $1 million,\u00a0and she was taken back into custody, Euless police Capt. Brenda Alvarado told CNN Tuesday. Wolf still was in custody Tuesday, inmate records showed. The incident is being investigated as a hate crime, Alvarado said. The Tarrant County district attorney\u2019s office has received the case for filing and the matter remains under investigation, police said. CNN has sought comment from Wolf\u2019s attorney.

{"id": "2024_07_06_media_biden-stephanopoulos-interview-campaign", "text": "ABC News\u2019 George Stephanopoulos had a tall task on Friday: Press President Joe Biden on his age, his acuity and the future of his reelection campaign. It was one of the most anticipated interviews of his career. Stephanopoulos mostly lived up to the challenge, asking rapid-fire, biting questions that did not let Biden off the hook. Although there was no single standout moment, Stephanopoulos challenged Biden\u2019s denialism about the political damage the president did to himself during his disastrous debate performance last week. Behind his questions, viewers got a sense of Stephanopoulos\u2019 frustration, which is shared by the entire White House press corps. Many of the journalists who cover Biden every day are seething; angry at what some say is a White House that has deceived them, and has kept the president from interacting in an open format with the press. In the interview, Biden\u2019s first since the CNN debate last month, Stephanopoulos kept the questions going at a fast clip. He was measured but persistent, clearly aware of the deeply personal and sensitive issues at hand. But he also sometimes seemed almost in disbelief at Biden\u2019s answers. \u201cDo you really believe that you\u2019re not behind right now?\u201d he asked Biden, questioning him again and again over polling. \u201cJust when you look at the reality though, Mr. President,\u201d he implored again. Stephanopoulos pressed Biden the most on whether he has had, and whether he would agree to a neurological and cognitive evaluation, asking him about it five times in a row. At some point Stephanopoulos painted a stark reality for the president. \u201cIt\u2019s been a two-man race for several months. Inflation has come down. In those last few months, (Trump has) become a convicted felon. Yet, you\u2019re still falling further behind,\u201d he said. And then an even more brutally honest take. \u201cMr. President, I\u2019ve never seen a president (at) 36% approval get reelected,\u201d he said. The interview only lasted about 22 minutes and was aired unedited. So any and all pauses, stumbles and even some production issues (like a\u00a0camera losing focus when Biden leaned forward) were bared for all to see. Although the interview did not necessarily have any earth-shattering moments, it was important for the Biden campaign to try to halt the negative whirlpool around it. Stephanopoulos was asking questions not just for ABC and the American public, but also for an entire White House press corps that\u2019s been urgently requesting access to the president and a press conference \u2014 thus far to no avail. Praise for Stephanopoulos Stephanopoulos was widely praised by fellow journalists. \u201cI think Stephanopoulos\u2019s questions are mostly good and tough so far,\u201d Jonah Goldberg, editor-in-chief of The Dispatch, wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter. Josh Jamerson, deputy politics editor at the Wall Street Journal, wrote, \u201cGeorge Stephanopoulos, incredibly impressive interviewer tonight. Not grandstanding at all. Just straight-forward questions.\u201d And New York Times reporter Kenneth Vogel noted Stephanopoulos was \u201cpersistent & tough, but not mean.\u201d \u201cHis toughest questions were delivered with empathy,\u201d Vogel added. The interview \u2014 while important \u2014 will likely do little to quell the crisis in the Democratic Party over Biden\u2019s candidacy, but also little to quell the frustration of the White House press corps, which has been demanding a press conference with the president. Biden has given the fewest press conferences of any modern president, although he rates highly for number of quick informal questions and answers with reporters. Stephanopoulos knows intimately well what the White House needed to do with this interview, having been on the other side as a communications director for former President Bill Clinton. During the 1992 presidential campaign, after reports surfaced that then-candidate Clinton had had a mistress, both Bill and Hillary Clinton sat for a \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview to air after the Super Bowl. Writing in his memoir years later, Stephanopoulos recalled: \u201cWe bet a whole campaign on a single interview.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/06/media/biden-stephanopoulos-interview-campaign/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/07/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_07_06_business_electric-nascar-race-car-unveiled", "text": "NASCAR racing is all about loud, fast cars burning gas and rubber around a track. But on Saturday, NASCAR unveiled something different: an all-electric SUV that has twice as much horsepower as any of their current gas guzzlers. It\u2019s a sign of just how far electric vehicles have come that even a sport better known for its adherence to tradition is entertaining embracing the technology \u2013 even if, for now, the new car is just a prototype. In some ways, it looks like what you\u2019d expect from NASCAR. It\u2019s colorful with big wheels and a wing on the back to help the vehicle hold the road at high speeds. But, if NASCAR is known for anything, it\u2019s the loud V8 internal combustion engines that power the race car. NASCAR executives insist they have no plans to turn away from fuel-burning power any time soon. \u201cThe combustion engine is our core product, and that will remain so for the coming future,\u201d said Riley Nelson, NASCAR\u2019s head of sustainability. But this vehicle, a fully drivable prototype, provides a way for NASCAR to gauge fan interest in electric cars. The racing crossover has three electric motors \u2014 one driving the front wheels and two the back \u2014 capable of producing a maximum of 1,300 horsepower, almost double the horsepower of NASCAR\u2019s current gasoline-powered race cars. Some passionate NASCAR fans will, no doubt, reject the very idea of electric racing, said John Probst, NASCAR\u2019s senior vice president of racing development. That\u2019s why NASCAR wants to make it very clear that gasoline-burning race cars are in no immediate danger of extinction. This is also an opportunity to open minds to what could be something exciting in the future. NASCAR\u2019s own research with fans indicated that many are curious to know more about electric vehicles and could see EV racing as a way to learn about them, he said. Once fans see the speed and excitement of an electric cars, which can be more powerful and faster than gas cars, he thinks even the most anti-EV fans will drop some of their objections. The NASCAR EV prototype was built in cooperation with ABB, a company that\u2019s involved in building electric vehicle infrastructure, such as power equipment for chargers. ABB is also heavily involved in Formula E, the electric racing series affiliated with Formula 1. Involvement in racing like this hopefully generates interest in EVs and shows what they\u2019re capable of, said Michael Plaster, ABB\u2019s executive vice president for electrification in the US. The hope is that exciting track performance can sell electric cars. NASCAR introduced a broader initiative last year to reduce its overall net carbon emissions to zero by 2035. Racing itself represents only a small part of the organization\u2019s overall carbon emissions, said Nelson. For now, most of that initiative has to do with reducing emissions from office space, transportation and operations at the 15 NASCAR-owned tracks. \u201cThe pilot programs that we\u2019ve implemented within operations of our core business, and then also the events, has been going really well,\u201d she said, \u201cand we know where we need to go but we\u2019re still in the early stages of this journey.\u201d Currently, NASCAR cars run on fuel that is 85% gasoline and 15% ethanol but, in the next few years, NASCAR plans to announce a more sustainable racing fuel that can still be burned in loud V8 engines. The original idea behind NASCAR, the National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing, was that it was supposed to involve cars similar to what Americans drive on the road. With many changes over the years, modern NASCAR race cars bear little resemblance to the Toyotas and Chevrolets that typical Americans own. This time, designers wanted to maintain that resemblance between the race car and the vehicles fans drive, which are, increasingly, SUVs. Today, traditional cars \u2014 as opposed to SUVs, trucks or vans \u2014 make up less than 20% of US auto sales, according to Cox Automotive. \u201cWe actually have the opportunity to evaluate not just the battery electric part, but then also the crossover vehicle part,\u201d said Probst. \u201cSo, it may be that one or both of these will become something in the future for us.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/06/business/electric-nascar-race-car-unveiled/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/07/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_07_06_economy_summer-job-market-teens", "text": "Your kid\u2019s summer camp is likely fully staffed. The ice cream store near you probably doesn\u2019t have a \u201chelp wanted\u201d sign up. But your local swimming pool or nearby beach could probably use a lot more lifeguards to keep it fully open this summer. \u201cTeens are coming back in. They\u2019re more engaged in the job market than their much older brothers and sisters,\u201d said Paul Harrington, a labor economist at Rhode Island College who coauthors an annual report on the teen summer job outlook. The shift is a refreshing change after the pandemic drove many teens away from working during their summer breaks. And yet, lifeguards are in much shorter supply. More teens want to work The share of teenagers who are looking for work or who are currently working, also referred to as the teen labor force participation rate, has been steadily increasing. Heading into the summer, the labor force participation rate for people ages 16 to 19 was 37.4%, according to fresh data from the June jobs report released on Friday. That\u2019s close to the highest level it\u2019s been since 2009. Eric Brotherson, human resources manager at Glenwood Caverns Adventure Park, an amusement park located in the heart of the Colorado Rockies, is witnessing that firsthand. \u201cHiring right now is way better than it was a year ago,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re in a good spot.\u201d The park aims to employ around 250 people each summer, which in recent years has been a big challenge, Brotherson said. That prompted him to start recruitment efforts for this summer much earlier than in prior years. A little trick he\u2019s learned is to always text applicants before calling them. \u201cWe found that so many young applicants don\u2019t have a voicemail or don\u2019t check them,\u201d he said. But when he texts them notifying them that he\u2019ll be calling soon to interview them, they almost always pick up, he noted. Pay increases are certainly helping Andy Pritikin, owner and director of Liberty Lake Day Camp in Bordentown, said in prior summers some staff he greeted at orientations before camp started were nowhere to be found on the first day of camp. After the pandemic caused a spike in mental health problems, particularly for cooped-up teens and 20-year-olds, Pritikin said many parents he heard from told their kids to prioritize their mental health by doing things they enjoy, like going away with friends or relaxing at the beach rather than working. \u201cNow I\u2019m seeing parents pushing their kids to work again,\u201d said Pritikin, who employs around 350 staff members each summer. This year, he said, \u201cthere are no staffing issues at all.\u201d But pay increases are also playing a role. Even though he can\u2019t match the wages at service and retail jobs, which have spiked since the pandemic, he has steadily increased pay. Ten years ago, high school-aged camp staff made around $1,000 for an entire summer. Now most are making close to $2,100, not including tips. Overall, inflation-adjusted median weekly pay for teens ages 16 to 19 grew from $289 in 2019 to $336 in 2023, a 13% increase, according to estimates Harrington and his coauthors of the teen summer job outlook report made using government data. On a percentage basis, those gains outpace what all other age groups 20 years and up saw during the summer from 2023 to 2019. The gains have come as employers have become more desperate to hire workers, due to persistent shortages in the labor market. But wages in the overall labor market have started to slow as more positions get filled. Still, even with the wage gains teens have seen, many of them could be taking jobs this summer out of financial necessity. \u201cTeens may be helping out their own households in many cases, saving for the high cost of college,\u201d Andrew Challenger, senior vice president of Challenger, Gray & Christmas, an outplacement and business research firm, said in a recent statement. He\u2019s forecasting that 1.3 million teens will be employed this summer. That would amount to 300,000 more teen workers compared to last summer, but is still slightly below the average over the past decade. Even with pay bumps, some shortages persist Nationwide, hiring an ample number of lifeguards to staff beaches, pools and waterparks has continued to be a major challenge. Last year, over 300,000 pools were closed or operating at a limited capacity due to a lifeguard shortage, according to the American Lifeguard Association. New York City has had a particularly hard time hiring lifeguards over the last few summers \u2014 and this year isn\u2019t looking much better. That\u2019s despite offering returning lifeguards a $1,000 bonus if they stay on through August 25 as well as raising hourly wages to $22, a 3% increase from last summer and a 13% increase from 2022. Additionally, in order to attract more workers, the city eased the requirements this year for lifeguards staffing the shallowest pools. But heading into the July 4 weekend, just 750 lifeguards were working across 50 public pools and eight beaches in New York City. That\u2019s well below the 1,000 lifeguards the city estimates it needs to fully staff those beaches and pools. However, it\u2019s more than there were at the same time last year, New York City Mayor Eric Adams told reporters at a press conference earlier in the week. To contend with the shortage, the city has opted to close off sections of beaches and pools rather than closing some locations entirely, Gregg McQueen, a spokesperson for the city\u2019s parks department, told CNN. \u201cWe adjust the available swimming space based on daily lifeguard headcount. We\u2019ll always open as much swimming space as possible,\u201d McQueen said. Adams has been advocating for expediting work licenses for migrants and asylum-seekers to ease lifeguard shortages. \u201cIt makes no sense that we have jobs that are available, could be filled, and we\u2019re not allowing employees to fill them,\u201d he said. But, nationally, the pay raises going to lifeguards are likely enticing more people to get certified, said Tom Gill, vice president of the United States Lifesaving Association, a nonprofit organization that certifies agencies that hire lifeguards at beaches. \u201cThere is not an agency I am aware of that has not raised their pay rate in the last two years substantially,\u201d Gill said. But he acknowledged that raises alone are not enough to combat the shortage of lifeguards. \u201cLifeguard agencies are facing competition that does not involve physical standards, intense training and the responsibility of the lives of thousands of swimmers in a dynamic environment daily,\u201d he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/06/economy/summer-job-market-teens/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/07/2024", "section": "us"}}

And the PTSD from the Camp Fire kicked in instantly, especially with how big the cloud of smoke was,\u201d Penick said. The Camp Fire was the\u00a0deadliest wildfire in California\u2019s history. Before the Maui fires, it was the deadliest wildfire in the US in more than a century as well, according to the\u00a0National Fire Protection Association. On Tuesday around 2:30 p.m. PT, Penick packed up her things in Oroville with her 5-year-old son, her fianc\u00e9 and her fianc\u00e9\u2019s two kids. The family is among the thousands of residents evacuated as the Thompson Fire continues to burn in Butte County, just about 20 miles south of Paradise. \u201cBy then, you could just see the cloud of smoke right there behind my house.

Our three dogs, our dog crates, all the dog food, my kids\u2019 favorite toys, all their diapers and wipes, their favorite bedding, their chairs.\u201d After the Camp Fire, Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E) reached an\u00a0$11 billion settlement with insurance companies and admitted it\u00a0was\u00a0\u201cprobable\u201d that its equipment started the 2018 Camp Fire. Penick is one of the people who received settlement money. She\u00a0has received one payment so far, and she used it to pay for her car and the rent on her Oroville house in advance,\u00a0she told CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s scary. It\u2019s sad. I\u2019ve worked hard to try and find this house. And the fact that the Camp Fire is the only way that I got this house with that settlement, and for it to just be gone again would just be devastating to me,\u201d she said. Penick also just found out she\u2019s pregnant, just like she was when she had to flee the Camp Fire in 2018. \u201cI was almost seven and a half months pregnant with my son Andrew. And he\u2019s five now,\u201d\u00a0she recalled.\u00a0\u201cAnd there was five of us, two dogs and a cat \u2026 and not one of us had a car. And so we were walking, and we walked for almost a mile. And some guy in a big white truck named Butch, he picked us up and he put us in the bed of his truck. Seeing my big old pregnant belly, he said \u2018get in.\u2019\u201d She found out her house burned down about six or seven weeks later. She had lived in Paradise her entire life. When they went back to visit the house, there wasn\u2019t much left. \u201cI found a little porcelain teacup that I had, that was buried underneath some stuff that didn\u2019t really break \u2013 the handle broke, but the cup didn\u2019t,\u201d\u00a0she said.\u00a0\u201cAll my baby stuff, my original ultrasounds from my pregnancy were burned.

An attorney for Porter, Jeff Jensen, didn\u2019t immediately respond Wednesday to a request for comment.

Officers found seven victims suffering from gunshot wounds shortly before 3 a.m. after receiving calls of an active shooter at a home on Ridgecrest Drive in Florence, southwest of Cincinnati, Ohio, Florence Police Department Chief Jeff Mallery said during a Saturday afternoon news conference. Mallery identified the four gunshot victims as Shane Miller, 20; Hayden Rybicki, 20; Delaney Eary, 19; and Melissa Parrett, 44. Parrett, the homeowner, was hosting her son\u2019s 21st birthday party when the shooting occurred, Mallery said.

The infant has been referred to as \u201cAngel Baby Doe\u201d by the Johnson County Sheriff\u2019s Office since her body was discovered on November 18, 2001. The child was found wrapped in a jacket with her umbilical cord still attached off the side of a road between the towns of Alvarado and Burleson, Texas, south of Fort Worth, the Texas Attorney General\u2019s Office said in a news release Monday. Authorities say she was born alive and likely outside of a medical facility. A person living in the area found the baby as they picked up cans along the side of the road, according to the release. The child died after authorities say the mother, later identified in September 2023 through DNA samples as Shelby Stotts, failed to receive prompt medical care after giving birth and failing to clamp the child\u2019s umbilical cord, which \u201ccaused the child to bleed to death,\u201d the attorney general\u2019s office stated. Stotts was indicted on a second-degree manslaughter charge in relation to Angel Baby Doe\u2019s death, the release stated. CNN was unable to locate contact information for an attorney representing Stotts. Prior to identifying Stotts, investigators had looked into several persons of interest over the past two decades in an attempt to identify the abandoned deceased child. \u201cVarious leads and tips have come in during those years, yet none have revealed her identity,\u201d the Johnson County Sheriff\u2019s Office shared in a 2021 Facebook post about the case. The previously cold case was revived in June 2021 after the Johnson County Sheriff\u2019s Office submitted evidence to forensic genetic genealogy company Othram, according to the release. The company\u2019s team developed a DNA profile for the baby and conducted extensive genetic genealogy research that provided law enforcement with new leads in the case, according to Othram. \u201cUsing this new information, a follow-up investigation was conducted leading investigators to potential relatives of the infant,\u201d the company said in a news release. The investigation led to Stotts being identified as the baby\u2019s mother. \u201cAfter more than twenty years, we are closer to securing justice for Angel Baby Doe and ensuring that the person responsible for this tragedy is held accountable,\u201d Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said in a release.

Soaring temperatures \u2013 which will continue into next week \u2013 have dried out already-parched vegetation, increasing the wildfire risk across the region. Gov.

The\u00a0governor\u2019s proclamation\u00a0cites \u201ccontinued high temperatures throughout the day and night, dry conditions, and strong winds\u201d that have increased the intensity and spread of the fire.

One of the people who evacuated Tuesday was Arielle Penick, 24, who also left her home from Paradise during the deadly 2018 Camp Fire.

About 13,000 people in\u00a0Butte County, including northeastern parts of Oroville,\u00a0were ordered to evacuate,\u00a0according to the sheriff\u2019s office. Oroville is\u00a0about 65 miles\u00a0north\u00a0of Sacramento with a population of around 15,000. The town sits about 20 miles south of Paradise, where the Camp Fire killed more than 70 people in 2018. Some of the residents impacted by that fire ended up relocating to Oroville. The city of Oroville\u2019s July 4 fireworks celebration was canceled by California State Parks on Wednesday as firefighters continue to battle the fire, the department said in a news release. \u201cDue to the large evacuations and damages caused by the\u00a0Thompson Fire,\u00a0State Parks and partner agencies \u2026 have a large number of resources responding to protect the community and get everyone back home as quickly as possible,\u201d State Parks said. \u201cThese agencies also have employees with families displaced by these evacuations who are tirelessly assisting the community of Lake Oroville.\u201d Red flag warnings are in effect across the West, including in the fire zone, because of extreme heat, gusty winds and low humidity.

Park rangers warn that summertime temperatures on the trail can reach over 120 degrees in the shade and advise not hiking during the day, between the hours of 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. Efforts to assist hikers can be delayed during the summer due to increased need and limited resources, the park service said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/03/us/thompson-fire-california-heat-wave/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/07/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_07_03_us_kansas-school-district-justice-department-settlement", "text": "The largest public school district in Kansas has agreed to revise its disciplinary practices as part of a settlement with the US Justice Department, resolving a federal civil rights investigation that determined its educators engaged in a pattern of discrimination against Black and disabled students. As part of the settlement agreement, which the Justice Department announced Tuesday, the Wichita Public Schools district will implement changes to end its use of seclusion, reform its restraint practices and refrain from referring students to law enforcement while dealing with routine school discipline matters, the department said in a news release. Black students in the district faced harsher, more severe disciplinary action than White students who engaged in \u201csimilar conduct and had similar backgrounds and disciplinary histories,\u201d the agency found. Insubordination was the most common offense for which the district disciplined Black students at a higher rate. The agency called the pattern \u201cespecially stark\u201d when it came to disciplining Black girls, whose behavior was \u201crepeatedly characterized using stereotypical terms like \u2018attitude\u2019 or \u2018drama,\u2019\u201d the release said. Black girls were also frequently and unnecessarily excluded from the school environment for \u201cperceived insubordination\u201d as well as dress code violations at some middle schools, the agreement said. During the period covered by the investigation, students with disabilities were subjected to 98% of the district\u2019s roughly 3,000 restraints and seclusions, and at least 44 students received 20 or more, the release said; one student was restrained or secluded at least 144 times, including 99 seclusions that lasted over 15 hours. Investigators visited the district\u2019s special schools for students with behavioral disabilities and discovered \u201cinferior facilities devoid of furniture, educational equipment and the kinds of decor commonly found in schools, and staff who could not meet the needs of students,\u201d the release stated. By the start of the next school year this fall, the district is required to create an Office of Behavior Management Support and Oversight to monitor restraint practices, ensuring compliance with the agreement, the settlement document says. As part of the new policy, educators can only restrain students when they pose an imminent danger of serious physical harm to themselves or others, it said. The district must also write a new code of conduct policy that will \u201cstandardize dress code policies and create a behavior intervention protocol\u201d to prevent discrimination in disciplining students, among other measures, the department said. It will provide counseling, as well as compensatory education to students who experienced repeated seclusion, according to the agreement. Nationally, Black students experience more restraints and seclusions At a Tuesday news conference, Kelly Bielefeld, the school district\u2019s superintendent, said the investigation started in spring 2022, adding: \u201cWe don\u2019t know what may have prompted the initial inquiry, but I can tell you that we can, and we must create a more equitable school district.\u201d The Justice Department has conducted similar investigations into school districts across the nation, including one completed in 2021 that revealed Black and Asian American Students at the Davis School District in Utah were harassed for years and officials deliberately ignored complaints from parents and students. The department\u2019s Educational Opportunities Section, part of its civil rights division, has been investigating and resolving complaints of improper seclusion of students with disabilities in public schools. According to a 2023\u00a0report\u00a0from the US Department of Education\u2019s Office for Civil Rights, \u201capproximately 52,800 K-12 students were physically restrained, mechanically restrained, and/or placed in seclusion at schools,\u201d during the 2020-2021 school year. While Black students made up 15% of K-12 public school enrollment during the same year, the report found they accounted for 21% of students physically restrained, 42% of the students restrained using a device or equipment, and 19% of students secluded. Boys, Black students, students of two or more races and students with disabilities were also more likely to be restrained,\u00a0the report said. \u201cBlack students inside our nation\u2019s public schools should not have to face discipline or a referral to law enforcement because of their race. And students with disabilities should not have to experience the trauma of seclusion or improper restraint,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights Kristen Clarke. \u201cSchools in our communities should not be a place of fear or mistrust.\u201d CNN\u2019s Chandelis Duster and Nia Mclean contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/03/us/kansas-school-district-justice-department-settlement/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/07/2024", "section": "us"}}

The warnings were lifted as the area readied for an influx of visitors for the Fourth of July, including the annual fireworks display on the National Mall. The Army Corps of Engineers said the advisory was prompted by elevated cloudiness in the water supply caused by increases in algae blooms in the Potomac River. \u201cUpon observing the increase in algae and resulting turbidity today, Washington Aqueduct staff implemented additional mechanical and chemical treatment solutions to help meet system water supply demands and (Environmental Protection Agency) standards,\u201d the Army Corps said in a statement.

Turbidity can indicate the presence of organisms including bacteria, viruses and parasites that can cause nausea, cramps, diarrhea and headaches. Infants, young children, older adults and people with compromised immune systems may be at greater risk, DC Water said.

{"id": "us_national-education-association-antisemistism", "text": "Several items being proposed at an upcoming education convention in Philadelphia\u00a0are raising concerns among a pro-Israel advocacy group about potential antisemitism and anti-Israel bias. Delegates of the\u00a0National Education Association (NEA), the largest teachers\u2019 union in the United States,\u00a0will meet at\u00a0the Pennsylvania Convention Center in Philadelphia\u00a0for their annual representative assembly from Wednesday to Sunday. Two rallies were held Wednesday outside the convention hall, one by the Educators for Palestine group \u2013 which is made up of NEA members - and a counter rally by StandWithUs, a nonprofit pro-Israel advocacy organization. StandWithUs has characterized several proposed agenda items being discussed as antisemitic. Although\u00a0the proposed agenda items\u00a0are typically confidential before being voted on at the representative assembly, Educators for Palestine have outlined several in their call to vote yes. CNN has not seen the proposed agenda items. The NEA did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for information on the\u00a0agenda items in question. Both groups aim to raise awareness among NEA delegates about several\u00a0agenda items that\u00a0reportedly\u00a0call for the NEA to\u00a0align itself with the \u201cBoycott, Divestment, and Sanctions\u201d movement against Israel, distinguish between antisemitism and anti-Zionism, and educate members about the Nakba, a term referring to the mass displacement of Palestinians during the 1948 Arab-Israeli war, according to information from both Educators for Palestine and StandWithUs. The past year has seen heightened tension in classrooms across the country, including incidents of antisemitism and anti-Palestinian hate, especially following an attack by Hamas on Israel in October. \u201cAs the largest teachers union in the United States, the NEA has a significant influence on educational policies and practices. Before and especially after the atrocities of October 7th, a number of local and state NEA union affiliates have been embroiled in major controversies regarding antisemitism and anti-Israel bias. In some cases, this has resulted in Jewish families moving their children to different school districts with a less hostile learning environment,\u201d a\u00a0release\u00a0from StandWithUs said. \u201cThe NEA must ensure a safe and inclusive environment for all educators and students, and maintain public trust in what is being taught in our classrooms. Passing antisemitic and anti-Israel resolutions would not only harm Jewish members, but also undermine the integrity of public education,\u201d David Smokler, director of K-12 educator outreach at StandWithUs, added. On the other hand, Educators for Palestine urge NEA delegates to vote yes on the agenda items, stating, \u201cAs educators, we must be open to educating each other, and learning from one another. We stand in solidarity with working class people around the world. Help us fight for a liberated Palestine, and a liberated people!\u201d A NEA spokesperson told CNN regarding the rallies, \u201cThe members of the\u00a0National Education Association\u00a0and delegates to its annual Representative Assembly are committed to educating and nurturing understanding in their students of every race, faith, and background.\u201d \u201cNEA has a deep history that is steeped in civil rights and advocating for racial and social justice. Over many decades, the delegates of the\u00a0NEA Representative Assembly\u00a0have adopted resolutions expressing our union\u2019s condemnation of war, terrorism, hate, and violence. The vast majority of NEA delegates, members, and our society want to see a peaceful and lasting solution to this conflict,\u201d their statement added. About 50-100 people came to each rally. Many carried signs and some waved flags. A group of police officers with bicycles separated the groups. Samy El-Baroudi, a business teacher from Des Moines, Iowa, who told CNN he was an organizer of the Educators for Palestine rally, said the NEA has taken stands before as it did against apartheid and should for the Palestinian people. \u201cWe stood up against so many injustices across the world, why is this one different?\u201d he asked. El-Baroudi said he has proposed a new business item asking for the NEA to determine a concrete definition of \u201cgenocide,\u201d a word he said is probably one of the most misunderstood words in the English language. \u201cWe want to have an honest, fair conversation,\u201d he said. At the other rally, Smokler said some teachers are bringing biased and inappropriate materials into classrooms and telling children what to think and not how to think. A small group of radical extremists are trying to get their propaganda into new business items, he told CNN as he stood near a protester who held a sign that read, \u201cCritical thinking, Not indoctrination.\u201d He said the NEA should be focused on improving conditions for teachers and students, not geopolitics. The rallies remained peaceful and there appeared to be no arrests.

Instead, the woman,\u00a0identified in public records by her initials \u201cTR,\u201d had been masquerading as her wife, Peggy Randolph, then a licensed clinical social worker, according to an investigative report from the Florida Department of Health. Randolph, who provided services to clients in Tennessee and Florida for her employer Brightside Health, helped her wife conduct online therapy sessions using her credentials while Randolph was seeing other patients in person, the report and a settlement agreement between Randolph and the state of Tennessee detailed. But Randolph\u2019s wife was not licensed or trained to provide any sort of counseling services,\u201d according to a settlement agreement between Randolph and the state of Tennessee. The couple\u2019s \u201ccoordinated effort\u201d to defraud patients came to light when Randolph was taking bereavement leave after her wife died, the documents stated. CNN tracked down an\u00a0online obituary\u00a0for 58-year-old Tammy Heath-Randolph that lists Peggy Randolph as the deceased\u2019s wife. Heath-Randolph (TR) died on February 11, 2023, just weeks before a patient complained to Brightside. Randolph \u201cdenies knowing\u201d\u00a0Heath-Randolph had been conducting therapy sessions using her Brightside Health Therapist Portal log-in credentials, the settlement agreement states. However, Brightside\u2019s internal investigation revealed Randolph had provided those credentials to her wife who \u201cwas seeing all her patients and had been for a long time,\u201d according to the Florida report. Randolph also received compensation for the sessions her wife conducted, the settlement agreement states. When\u00a0she was presented with a photograph showing Heath-Randolph with one of her clients, she acknowledged that she was her wife. Brightside Health took \u201cswift and decisive action\u201d once it learned of the breach, a statement provided to CNN. \u201cWe\u2019re extremely disappointed that a single provider was willing to violate the trust that Brightside and, most importantly, her patients had placed in her,\u201d the statement said. The impacted patients were fully reimbursed, Brightside Health said. The company also revoked Randolph\u2019s access to its software systems immediately after receiving notice of the incident and ended her contract, it said. Randolph worked for the company\u00a0from January 2021 until February 2023, according to the settlement, which says she was\u00a0\u201cassigned to provide therapy sessions to hundreds of clients.\u201d\u00a0It\u2019s unclear how many patients were seen by her wife during that time period. In an emailed statement, Brightside spokesperson Hannah Changi told KFF Health News that Brightside couldn\u2019t say how many patients were seen by Randolph\u2019s wife \u201cdue to the nature of the incident and ongoing legal proceedings.\u201d Randolph gave up her license voluntarily in both Florida and Tennessee and in May was ordered by the state of Tennessee to pay a $1,000 civil penalty within 12 months.

{"id": "2024_07_06_business_six-flags-cedar-fair-merger-rollercoaster", "text": "Six Flags this week completed an $8 billion merger with rival Cedar Fair to create the largest amusement park operator in the United States. Together, they operate 42 amusement and water parks across 17 states. The success of the deal will determine the future of these amusement parks, and diehard rollercoaster fans are watching carefully. Some are optimistic that the condition of Six Flags\u2019 parks will improve. Others worry it will become more expensive to get into their favorite parks. Many amusement park fans are passionate about the parks\u2019 design and history and notice the smallest of changes. For now, each park in the new company will keep its old branding and name. But fans fear the parks could lose their nostalgic elements and become a sea of corporate sameness. \u201cThere\u2019s apprehension,\u201d said Bill Kneass, who has been a Six Flags season passholder on and off (but mostly on) for 30 years, twisting through Nitro and Wonder Woman rides at Six Flags Great Adventure in New Jersey. Kneass goes to the park with his sons and his friends. He also goes by himself sometimes to take in the roar of the coasters or find quieter spots around the park gardens. He highlights each visit with a trip to see the engraved brick he bought on a park pathway to commemorate Six Flags\u2019 50th\u00a0anniversary. \u201cIf the new Six Flags can find a way to honor the history of their parks and bring in new attractions for all types of enthusiasts, they\u2019re poised for success,\u201d he said. Chris Miller, who runs a YouTube channel about amusement parks called Coaster Conquest and co-hosts the Theme Park Stan podcast, is \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d about the merger. \u201cI am hopeful that joining forces will help bring a variety of different new rides to parks that don\u2019t normally see updates,\u201d he said. But he is \u201cworried that the cost of an all-park season pass will be super expensive\u201d because of less competition. He also worries the \u201cbeautiful\u201d Cedar Fair parks will lose their distinct identities and become more like Six Flags. \u201cI hope they keep the parks as they are,\u201d he said. The new company, Six Flags Entertainment Corp., does not anticipate making any major changes at the park level, said spokesperson Gary Rhodes. Fans also should not expect any \u201cimmediate changes\u201d to prices, ticket options or season passes. \u201cWe expect this combination will enable us to deliver even more engaging and entertaining experiences to guests,\u201d he said. Six Flags struggles The two companies are joining to compete with destination parks such as Disney and Universal and to use their new scale to drive down costs with vendors and suppliers. People come from around the world to go to Disney parks, while Six Flags and Cedar Fair are regional attractions. Cedar Fair controls 51% of the new company, and Six Flags owns 49%. The company, with the stock ticker FUN, will be led by Cedar Fair CEO Richard Zimmerman. Six Flags has struggled in recent years, going through various management changes and strategies. Its stock has dropped 40% over the past five years. Six Flags hiked ticket prices in 2022, raising the average price of admission to $35.99 from $28.73. The move caused a 26% drop in annual attendance It was part of Six Flags\u2019 \u201cpremiumization\u201d plan to bring in fewer people to parks but get them to spend more. CEO Selim Bassoul complained in 2022 that Six Flags had turned into \u201ccheap day care centers\u201d for teenagers and said the company wanted to \u201cmigrate\u2026a little bit from what I call the Kmart, Walmart to maybe the Target customer.\u201d The shifting strategies impacted the experience at the park, Kneass said. Six Flags, he noticed, focused on adding thrill rides and overlooked smaller rides for kids and families and other park activities, such as evening entertainment and shows. Staffing at the park and customer service also became inconsistent. \u201cSix Flags can feel a bit disjointed,\u201d he said. \u201cFinances were more important than the guest experience.\u201d Attendance at Cedar Fair, which operates its flagship Cedar Point park in Sandusky, Ohio; Knott\u2019s Berry Farm in Buena Park, California; and other parks, outperformed Six Flags last year. Analysts and fans consider Cedar Fair a stronger manager of day-to-day park operations than Six Flags. That gives fans like Matt Kaiser, who runs the 23,000-member Facebook group Great Adventure Connoisseurs, optimism. \u201cA lot of people used to Six Flags parks are happy that they\u2019re merging and look forward to Cedar Fair behind the wheel,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople tend to think Cedar has better service.\u201d Potential changes The amusement park industry faces significant volatility, including the rising threat of extreme weather driven by climate change. Six Flags has said it\u2019s adding more shaded structures, water misters, splash zones and air-conditioned areas to contend with extreme heat. Merging makes the two companies less dependent on any one park or region if weather forces them to shut down. \u201cThey\u2019re so strategically laid out across the United States. There\u2019s not a lot of overlap,\u201d said Dennis Speigel, the chief executive of consulting firm International Theme Park Services. \u201cIf you take those parks and meld them together, you have tremendous marketing opportunities.\u201d Park enthusiasts could see other changes, including new season pass options and loyalty programs that give passholders access to more parks, said Chris Woronka, an analyst at Deutsche Bank. Retaining and growing season passholders is critical because they make up more than half of annual attendance for Cedar Fair and Six Flags\u2019 parks. The new company may also combine its intellectual property licenses at parks to design new themed rides and attractions. Six Flags has a deal with Warner Bros. Discovery for the rights to DC Comics and Looney Tunes characters, and Cedar Fair has the rights to Peanuts and Snoopy characters. (CNN is owned by Warner Bros. Discovery.) It could mean, for example, that Looney Tunes rides are featured at both brands of parks. Halloween has become a primary visiting time for theme park fans, and there could be changes to these events. Cedar Fair hosts Halloween Haunt and Six Flags hosts Fright Fest. But Michael Musil, who lives in Bay Village, Ohio, and is a longtime Cedar Point visitor, worries that Cedar Point will suffer. \u201cSix Flags is going to corporatize it and budget out everything and end up with this very sanitized, fixed version of the amusement park,\u201d he said. \u201cThat might be great for the bottom line, but it would be boring.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/06/business/six-flags-cedar-fair-merger-rollercoaster/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/07/2024", "section": "us"}}

CNN reporting later clarified that it was the Biden campaign that handled the interview. Blackwell pointed out that both Lawful-Sanders and Earl Ingram, host of \u201cThe Earl Ingram Show\u201d in Milwaukee who also interviewed the president this week, asked Biden \u201cessentially the same questions.\u201d A Biden campaign spokesperson on Saturday did not deny that the campaign provided questions but said that \u201cWe do not condition interviews on acceptance of these questions.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not at all an uncommon practice for interviewees to share topics they would prefer. These questions were relevant to the news of the day \u2013 the president was asked about this debate performance as well as what he\u2019d delivered for black Americans,\u201d spokesperson Lauren Hitt said in a statement. The Biden campaign said later Saturday it will no longer suggest questions to interviewers. \u201cWhile interview hosts have always been free to ask whatever questions they please, moving forward we will refrain from offering suggested questions,\u201d a source familiar with the Biden booking operation told CNN. The radio interviews came at a critical moment for Biden\u2019s political future as a growing number of elected officials, Democratic donors and supporters express deep concerns about his age and capacity to serve a second term as president. Biden on Friday also took questions from pool reporters and sat with ABC News\u2019 George Stephanopoulos for a 22-minute interview focused entirely on his age and fitness for office. He will again field questions from reporters during the NATO summit in Washington next week. Biden, who has faced enormous scrutiny this week, made some stumbles during his conversation with Lawful-Sanders. \u201cI\u2019m proud to be, as I said, the first vice president \u2013 first Black woman \u2013 to serve with a Black president, proud to have been involved with the first Black woman on the Supreme Court,\u201d he said during the interview, which taped Wednesday and aired Thursday. Reached for comment Thursday night, a Biden campaign spokesperson slammed the \u201cabsurdity\u201d of criticism of the president\u2019s missteps. \u201cIt was clear what President Biden meant when he was talking about his historic record including a record number of appointments to the federal bench,\u201d spokesperson Ammar Moussa said. Lawful-Sanders\u2019 remarks came after a Biden campaign social media account on Monday shared video of a local news anchor in Virginia saying Donald Trump\u2019s campaign backed out of an interview after asking for questions in advance. The interview was scheduled to take place around the former president\u2019s rally in Chesapeake, Virginia, the day after the debate. \u201cWe wanted to hear more from Trump tonight. Our Mike Gooding was scheduled to interview the former president after the rally,\u201d WVEC anchor Dan Kennedy said. \u201cBut just about 15 minutes ago the Trump team canceled on Mike Gooding after asking us what our questions would be for the former president, telling Mike that there was no more time and that the former president only wanted to talk about last night\u2019s debate.\u201d In a social media post sharing the video, the Biden campaign derided Trump for backing out of the interview, writing, \u201cA paranoid and overwhelmed Trump cancels his TV interview after asking the reporter what questions they planned on asking.\u201d When asked by CNN on Saturday whether Trump backed out of the interview, the former president\u2019s campaign ignored the claim and instead slammed Biden for allegedly providing questions to interviewers in advance. \u201cPresident Trump held a rally in Virginia and afterwards participated in local interviews that spanned numerous topics, not just related to the debate,\u201d campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung said. \u201cMeanwhile, Joe Biden and his campaign are bullying media into asking pre-screened and approved questions and trying to pass it off like it\u2019s normal behavior.

Approximately $24 million of the $26 million were for punitive damages, but a judge\u00a0later cut\u00a0that\u00a0amount to $350,000, meaning the eight plaintiffs were going to receive only $43,750 each. However, according to court documents, restoring more than $2 million of the slashed amount means each plaintiff will receive approximately $350,000. A three-judge panel of the Richmond-based 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals\u00a0found a state law which caps the total dollar amount\u00a0of punitive damages each person can receive to $350,000, court documents show. In Monday\u2019s opinion, Chief Judge Albert Diaz wrote, \u201c\u2026 we vacate the district court\u2019s order to the extent that it reduces the jury\u2019s punitive damages to $350,000 for all plaintiffs under the Virginia punitive damages cap. And we remand with instructions that the district court apply the cap instead on a per-plaintiff basis.\u201d Before the \u201cUnite the Right\u201d rally began, counter-protestors clashed with white nationalists and other right-wing groups which prompted local officials to declare the rally an \u201cunlawful assembly\u201d and the governor declared a state of emergency,\u00a0CNN previously reported. About two hours later, James Alex Fields Jr., a white supremacist from Maumee, Ohio, intentionally drove his car into a crowd of counter-protesters, killing one woman and injuring dozens more. Fields is serving a life sentence for murder and hate crimes. Fields\u2019 lawyer was not immediately\u202favailable for comment. When the defendants requested the court ask the Supreme Court to question the $350,000 rule, the 4th Circuit panel rejected it and said the law was \u201cclear enough to predict how Virginia\u2019s high court would rule.\u201d \u201cOver two years ago, the jury used its $24 million punitive damages award to send an unmistakable message to the defendants and to the public about the outrageous misconduct that took place in Charlottesville, Virginia,\u201d Diaz wrote in the 3-0 ruling. \u201cWhile the law compels us to reduce the award, it\u2019s long past time for that message to be delivered.\u201d CNN reached out to the defendants\u2019\u00a0lawyers who were not immediately available for comment.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/03/us/unite-the-right-victims-damages-reaj/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/07/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_07_04_us_blaze-bernstein-killing-conviction", "text": "A California man was convicted of murder with a hate crime enhancement Wednesday for the 2018 stabbing death of a gay University of Pennsylvania student. Samuel Woodward, 26, was found guilty of first-degree murder plus the enhancement in the killing of Blaze Bernstein, a gay, Jewish college sophomore who was home visiting his family in Southern California on winter break when he went missing. Authorities scoured the area for him and found his body a week later in a shallow grave at a nearby park. The question during the monthslong trial was not whether Woodward killed Bernstein but why, and the circumstances under which it happened. During closing arguments, prosecutor Jennifer Walker emphasized Woodward\u2019s affiliation with a violent, anti-gay, neo-Nazi extremist group known as Atomwaffen Division. \u201cThis is a person focused on hate,\u201d Walker said. \u201cNot following, not being led by, influenced by, victimized by Atomwaffen \u2014 seeking it out.\u201d With the hate crime enhancement, Woodward could face a sentence of life without parole. Ken Morrison, Woodward\u2019s attorney, sought at trial to show his client did not plan to kill Bernstein and did not hate anyone, in an effort for a conviction to be on a lesser charge such as second-degree murder or manslaughter. Morrison, who plans to appeal after sentencing, said the judge made some key rulings that denied \u201cjurors the ability to consider evidence critical to a fair trial.\u201d Bernstein\u2019s family said in a statement no verdict could \u201cerase the pain of losing our son and the agony of waiting all of these years without resolution,\u201d ABC News reported. \u201cHe was an amazing human and humanitarian and a person we were greatly looking forward to having in our lives, seeing wondrous things from him as his young life unfolded,\u201d the family said. \u201cFrom this funny, articulate, kind, intelligent, caring and brilliant scientist, artist, writer, chef and son, there will never be anyone quite like him.\u201d Woodward and Bernstein previously attended the same high school in Orange County and connected via a dating app in the months before the attack, according to testimony at trial. Woodward said he picked up Bernstein and went to a nearby park, and he repeatedly stabbed Bernstein after trying to grab a cellphone he feared had been used to photograph him. Prosecutors said Woodward joined Atomwaffen Division and repeatedly targeted gay men online by reaching out to them and then abruptly breaking off contact while keeping a hateful, profanity-laced journal of his actions. They said Woodward showed an interest in carrying out violent acts in the weeks before the killing and reached out to Bernstein online. \u201cHate will never be tolerated here in Orange County \u2014 and instead of a symbol to be revered by other haters, he is a symbol of how society will never tolerate those who terrorize the most vulnerable members of our society,\u201d county District Attorney Todd Spitzer said Wednesday in a statement. Morrison, the defense lawyer, told jurors Woodward faced challenges in his personal relationships due to a long-undiagnosed autism spectrum disorder and was confused about his sexuality after growing up in a politically conservative and devout Catholic family where his father openly criticized homosexuality. The case took years to go to trial after questions arose about Woodward\u2019s mental state and following multiple changes in defense attorneys. Woodward was deemed competent to stand trial in late 2022. Bernstein, who was 19 at the time, disappeared in January 2018 after he went out at night with Woodward to a park in Lake Forest, about 45 miles southeast of Los Angeles. After Bernstein missed a dentist appointment the next day, his parents found his glasses, wallet and credit cards in his bedroom and tried to contact him, but he did not respond to texts or calls. Authorities launched an exhaustive search and said Bernstein\u2019s family scoured his social media and saw he had communicated with Woodward on Snapchat. Authorities said Woodward told the family Bernstein had gone off to meet a friend in the park that night and did not return. Days later, Bernstein\u2019s body was found\u00a0in the shallow grave. He had been repeatedly stabbed in the face and neck. Authorities said they searched Woodward\u2019s family home in Newport Beach and found a folding knife with a bloodied blade in his room. They also found a black Atomwaffen mask with traces of blood and a host of anti-gay, antisemitic and hate group materials, prosecutors said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/04/us/blaze-bernstein-killing-conviction/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/07/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_07_06_politics_biden-abc-interview-analysis", "text": "President Joe Biden\u2019s struggle to prove he\u2019s got the strength and cognitive capacity for a second term is becoming an excruciating personal and national ordeal. Watching a visibly aged Biden answer frank questions Friday about his health on primetime television \u2013 which would normally remain between a patient and their doctor \u2013 felt like an affront to presidential dignity. It was sad to see a person who\u2019s respected and beloved by many Americans suffer such a plight. And it would be a hard heart that did not empathize with Biden as he confronts the painful human realities of aging in the most public manner imaginable. Yet Biden\u2019s position, his shocking presidential debate performance and his defiant refusal to contemplate its implications for his reelection campaign, mean he\u2019s forcing the country to have the conversation. The political tide may be turning against Biden, but the interview underscored his deep pride in a presidency that it took him nearly half a century to achieve. And he\u2019s not close to giving up his lifelong mantra to stand up and fight when he\u2019s knocked down \u2013 a factor that will exacerbate the Democratic Party\u2019s dilemma. While his interview performance was far stronger than the president\u2019s often incoherent showing at the CNN debate in Atlanta, that\u2019s not saying much. It did not contain any new disasters that would push him immediately out of the race. But it equally did little to quell the storm assailing his campaign and raised fresh intrigue about his health amid increasing signs his Democratic power base is beginning to crack. It\u2019s becoming clear that the president, his party and the country are slipping inexorably into a political crisis that raises the extraordinary possibility that a presumptive nominee could be pushed aside weeks before his party\u2019s national convention and four months before one of the most critical elections in history. The threats to Biden\u2019s prospects are quickly mounting. Two more Democratic congressman Friday called on the president to cede the nomination to a younger candidate. Virginia Sen. Mark Warner moved forward with an effort to get Senate Democrats on the same page about Biden\u2019s future and is reaching a place where he thinks it\u2019s time for Biden to suspend his campaign, a source familiar with his efforts told CNN. And House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries scheduled a virtual meeting with ranking party committee members as he faces increasing pressure from his conference over Biden\u2019s position, a Democratic lawmaker said. A test set by the campaign Biden\u2019s campaign had scheduled the interview with ABC News to try to prove that the president\u2019s stumbling debate performance last week was an aberration and to shut down growing doubts about his position as his party\u2019s 2024 nominee. He appeared more composed and fluent than at the CNN debate. He made a far more robust argument for his own successes in office and more effectively prosecuted a case against Trump than he did in the debate. And he dug in deeper despite calls by a handful of a Democratic lawmakers for him to fold his reelection bid and the growing panic among many others yet to break cover. He also dismissed concerns about his health, insisting that he was not frailer than before. \u201cCan I run the 100 (in) 10 flat? No, but I\u2019m still in good shape,\u201d Biden said. \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody\u2019s more qualified to be president or win this race than me,\u201d Biden said in the interview conducted in swing state Wisconsin. \u201cIf the Lord Almighty came down and said, \u2018Joe, get out of the race,\u2019 I\u2019d get out of the race,\u201d Biden said, but added: \u201cThe Lord Almighty\u2019s not coming down.\u201d But Biden\u2019s admission that he felt \u201cterrible\u201d in the days before his clash with the Republican presumptive nominee Donald Trump only posed new questions about his health. Those questions come at a time of growing anxiety that he\u2019s well enough at 81 to shoulder the exhausting demands of the presidency and the strain of a reelection bid. Biden compounded those doubts by seeming unsure about whether he\u2019d watched a playback of the debate \u2013 \u201cI don\u2019t think so, no,\u201d he said when asked if he\u2019d watched the event \u2013 and other moments in which he trailed off in some sentences. And he added yet another explanation for his poor debate performance to add to his allies\u2019 claims he was overloaded with facts by staff, jet-lagged and suffering from a cold. The president said Trump\u2019s insistence on speaking even though his microphone was muted had put him off. Asked whether he was the same man who took office three years ago, Biden deflected by offering a litany of his achievements. \u201cIn terms of successes, yes,\u201d he said. \u201cI also was the guy who put together a peace plan for the Middle East that may be coming to fruition. I was also the guy that expanded NATO. I was also the guy that grew the economy. All the individual things that were done were ideas I had or I fulfilled. I moved on.\u201d The president was adamant that the debate was a only \u201ca bad night\u201d for which he took responsibility. But more than a week after the event, and amid rising fear among Democrats about his prospects in November and the possibility of what it will mean for democracy if Trump wins a second term, one thing is becoming increasingly clear. One bad night on such a high-profile stage before millions of viewers may be all it takes to irretrievably damage the campaign of president who will be 82 two weeks after Election Day, who large majorities of Americans worry is unfit to serve and who is asking the country to keep him in office until January 2029. Americans are worried about the next four years, not the last three Biden and his supporters warn that his painful 90 minutes on stage in Atlanta should not overshadow the achievements of his time in office. And they say that the threat posed by Trump and his autocratic instincts and vow to dedicate a second presidency to \u201cretribution\u201d far outweigh concerns over Biden\u2019s capacity. But the question that millions of Americans are asking has less to do with a review of Biden\u2019s first-term legacy and is more about whether he can function for four more grueling White House years. The interview also begged the question of whether the president is fully aware of the corrosive impact of the debate on confidence among Democrats over his chances of beating Trump. He quarreled with ABC News\u2019 George Stephanopoulos over polling that showed him slipping further behind the former president nationally and in swing states. The interview was one of a series of events, including the Friday rally and a planned news conference at the NATO summit next week in Washington, that the campaign has held up as moments to prove Biden\u2019s fitness. But Democratic Rep. Brad Sherman of California told CNN that the president needed to do a prolonged and live television interview unlike the recorded one on ABC. Other members are demanding the president get out far more to prove his stamina, even though the campaign on Friday promised an \u201caggressive\u201d program of events in July. But that pledge did not stop the growing demands for Biden to step aside. \u201cPresident Biden has done enormous service to our country, but now is the time for him to follow in one of our founding father, George Washington\u2019s, footsteps and step aside to let new leaders rise up and run against Donald Trump,\u201d\u00a0Massachusetts Rep. Seth\u00a0Moulton\u00a0told Boston radio station WBUR in an interview that went out before the ABC interview aired. And\u00a0Illinois Rep. Mike\u00a0Quigley\u00a0said Biden\u2019s continued presence in the race has \u201calmost no hope of succeeding.\u201d \u201cI would say Mr. President, your legacy is set. We owe you the greatest debt of gratitude. The only thing you can do now to cement that for all-time and prevent utter catastrophe is to step down and let someone else do this,\u201d\u00a0Quigley told MSNBC.\u00a0He later added on CNN: \u201cWhat we need right now \u2013 and what I think takes a spine \u2013 is to step aside and recognize the president of the United States doesn\u2019t have the vigor necessary to overcome the deficit here and it\u2019s going to affect us all.\u201d Massachusetts Gov.\u00a0Maura\u00a0Healey did not go quite so far but said in a statement to CNN that Biden needed to \u201ccarefully evaluate whether he remains our best hope to defeat Trump. Whatever President Biden decides, I am committed to doing everything in my power to defeat Donald Trump.\u201d The agonizing over Biden\u2019s fate is especially painful for Democrats because many of them believe that the president has done a good job in reviving the post-Covid-19 economy, powering job growth, harnessing US allies overseas and passing big-ticket infrastructure and climate change plans. But increasingly, it seems as though the fear of a Trump term may be overwhelming satisfaction with Biden\u2019s achievements. To temper such worries, Biden used the rally to pivot from questions about his age to try to refocus attention on what he\u2019d actually done in office. \u201cI keep seeing all\u00a0those stories about I\u2019m being too\u00a0old,\u201d he said. \u201cLet me say something. I wasn\u2019t too\u00a0old\u00a0to create over 15 million new jobs. To make sure 21 million Americans are insured under the Affordable Care Act. Was I too\u00a0old\u00a0to release student debt for nearly 5 million Americans? Too\u00a0old\u00a0to put the first Black woman on the Supreme Court in the United States of America?\u201d After the debate, Biden\u2019s every word is under intense scrutiny and risks bolstering a critical narrative about his age and mental acuity after he seared an image of a struggling, president diminished by age in the mind of viewers. So, one fatalistic statement in the ABC interview about how he\u2019d feel next January if Trump won is likely to inflame concerns of many Democrats about his mindset, his understanding of his situation and what will happen in November. \u201cI\u2019ll feel as long as I gave it my all and I did the goodest job as I know I can do, that\u2019s what this is about,\u201d Biden said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/06/politics/biden-abc-interview-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/07/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_07_05_politics_maura-healey-joe-biden", "text": "Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey issued a statement Friday urging President Joe Biden to \u201ccarefully evaluate\u201d whether he remains the Democratic Party\u2019s best hope to defeat Donald Trump in the 2024 election. \u201cPresident Biden saved our democracy in 2020 and has done an outstanding job over the last four years. I am deeply grateful for his leadership,\u201d Healy said in a statement to CNN. \u201cAnd I know he agrees this is the most important election of our lifetimes. The best way forward right now is a decision for the president to make. Over the coming days, I urge him to listen to the American people and carefully evaluate whether he remains our best hope to defeat Donald Trump. Whatever President Biden decides, I am committed to doing everything in my power to defeat Donald Trump.\u201d Healey was one of the Democratic governors who met with Biden on Wednesday seeking reassurance over the future of the president\u2019s reelection campaign. With her statement, Healey became the first sitting Democratic governor publicly call on Biden to think about stepping aside \u2013 a significant departure from the public statements of support other governors in the meeting issued. It comes as cracks have begun to appear in Biden\u2019s coalition. Four Democrats in Congress \u2013 Rep. Lloyd Doggett of Texas, Rep. Ra\u00fal Grijalva of Arizona Rep. Seth Moulton of Massachusetts and Rep. Mike Quigley of Illinois \u2013 have asked Biden to bow out. Those calls were signs of the unsteadiness of Democratic support for their top candidate. Some of the president\u2019s comments during Wednesday\u2019s meeting left participants frustrated. Biden told the governors that he needed more sleep and planned to stop scheduling late-night events. He also made a joke that didn\u2019t go over well with some of the them: \u201cI\u2019m fine \u2013 I don\u2019t know about my brain, though.\u201d Biden campaign officials and top surrogates have spent the week since his disastrous debate performance trying to soothe the anxieties of major donors, voters and other down-ballot Democrats. But Biden himself was slow to call party leaders, including House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer. His Wednesday meeting with the governors came after some of them expressed frustration with not having heard from the president. But while Doggett and Grijalva were the first fractures in Biden\u2019s coalition, the vast majority of party leaders remain behind him. Several of the governors who attended Wednesday\u2019s meeting released statements firmly in support of the president. \u201cI heard three words from the President \u2013 he\u2019s all in. And so am I. Joe Biden\u2019s had our back. Now it\u2019s time to have his,\u201d\u00a0California Gov. Gavin Newsom\u00a0said in a statement after the meeting. Michigan Gov. Gretchen\u00a0Whitmer said in a tweet that Biden \u201cis our nominee. He is in it to win it and I support him.\u201d CNN reported earlier this week that Biden sees the next few days as key to his political survival. Among the key events are a campaign rally in Wisconsin Friday afternoon and another event in Pennsylvania on Sunday, along with a high-profile interview on Friday with ABC\u2019s George Stephanopoulos.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/05/politics/maura-healey-joe-biden/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/07/2024", "section": "us"}}

{"id": "2024_07_02_us_karen-read-mistrial-what-happens-next", "text": "The murder trial of Karen Read ended in a mistrial Monday after jurors couldn\u2019t reach a unanimous verdict, prolonging a case that\u2019s divided a Massachusetts community amid allegations of a sweeping cover-up by police and investigative misconduct. While not an acquittal, the outcome was a boon for Read, who is accused of drunkenly driving into her then-boyfriend, Boston police officer John O\u2019Keefe, and leaving him to die on a snowy night in January 2022 outside a home in Canton, Massachusetts. The 45-year-old had pleaded not guilty to charges of second-degree murder, vehicular manslaughter while intoxicated and leaving the scene of a collision, and she faced up to life in prison if convicted. But prosecutors with the Norfolk District Attorney\u2019s Office failed to convince the jury of six men and six women beyond a reasonable doubt. Over the last two days of the five-day deliberations, jurors repeatedly informed the judge they were hopelessly deadlocked, saying in a final note on Monday their perspectives were \u201cstarkly divided.\u201d Now, prosecutors must decide whether to rethink their approach. As they reconsider their case, they may decide to present evidence differently in hopes of securing a conviction, or avoid a second trial altogether and offer a plea deal, legal experts said. \u201cThey\u2019re going to make an assessment about basically what went wrong,\u201d trial attorney Misty Marris told CNN. \u201cYou go back, and you do the diagnostic: Where does the evidence fail to meet those standards from the jury\u2019s perspective?\u201d Here\u2019s what could happen next: Prosecutors intend to retry the case In a brief statement Monday, the office of Norfolk County District Attorney Michael Morrissey said it plans to retry the case, which alleged Read and O\u2019Keefe had gotten into an argument the night of January 28, 2022, before she struck him with her SUV and fled the scene. The couple had been out drinking at two bars with friends, then went to the home of O\u2019Keefe\u2019s colleague for an after-party, court documents show. O\u2019Keefe was found the next morning bruised and battered in the snow outside the home in Canton. Read and her attorneys had, in turn, presented another theory: Read dropped O\u2019Keefe off, then left \u2013 while O\u2019Keefe was injured in a fight with off-duty officers inside the home, mauled by the homeowners\u2019 dog, then tossed in the snow to die. The police then conspired to fabricate evidence and lie under oath to protect their own and frame Read, her defense alleged. Court documents say Read went looking the next morning for O\u2019Keefe in the snowstorm and found his body in the front yard of the Canton home. Prosecutors rejected that theory, presenting evidence the couple had a volatile relationship. Firefighters who responded the morning of January 29 to the site of O\u2019Keefe\u2019s body asked about his injuries and were told by Read, \u201cI hit him, I hit him,\u201d according to their testimony. Additionally, Read\u2019s vehicle had a broken taillight, and pieces of the taillight were found at the scene. Read\u2019s attorneys on Monday signaled they would not shy away from a retrial. \u201cNo matter how long it takes, no matter how long they keep trying, we will not stop fighting. We have no quit,\u201d\u00a0Alan Jackson, one of Karen Read\u2019s attorneys, said in video provided by CNN affiliate WCVB outside the courthouse. Prosecutors could rethink the case \u2026 Prosecutors\u2019 decision to quickly signal their intent to retry the case wasn\u2019t unexpected, said Rosanna Cavallaro, a professor of law at Suffolk University in Boston. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to be seen as thinking that they failed, or that they have nothing but a very strong case,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the reality is, of course, that what a mistrial means is that the jury could not agree, and they were not persuaded.\u201d But ahead of a status conference on July 22, prosecutors will be engaged in a post mortem of the case, said Daniel Medwed, a law professor at Northeastern University, and they will be asking themselves a series of questions. \u201cWhat worked, what didn\u2019t work? If they were to proceed again,\u201d he said, \u201cwould they choose the same charges? \u2026 Would they change their strategy in some ways? Where are places that they need to shore up their case, maybe through additional investigation?\u201d Perhaps, Medwed said, prosecutors will look back and feel they overreached charging Read with murder, which requires intent, and instead focus on the other charge. \u201cThey might just consider dropping the murder charge and going with manslaughter,\u201d he said. Indeed, Cavallaro said the indictment against Read and the charges stemming from it would not change. But prosecutors could offer another narrative that would make it easier for a second jury to convict Read on a lesser type of homicide than second-degree murder like manslaughter or reckless manslaughter. The stories heard by the jury were \u201cbinary\u201d and \u201cpolarized,\u201d she said: In prosecutors\u2019 telling, Read intended to kill O\u2019Keefe, while the defense argued she was innocent and framed. \u201cIt\u2019s possible the second time around, the government says, \u2018Maybe we need to give the jury this intermediate possibility that she didn\u2019t mean to kill him,\u2019\u201d Cavallaro said, in addition to alleging Read intended to murder O\u2019Keefe. \u201cIt captures the idea that a reasonable person would have been more careful, and because of your lack of care, your recklessness, a death occurred that you\u2019re responsible for,\u201d she added. \u201cThat behavior is punishable as a homicide, but not as a murder,\u201d she said. \u2026 or offer a plea deal Former Massachusetts Attorney General Martha Coakley indicated in an interview with WCVB that prosecutors could drop the most serious charge of second-degree murder, adding, \u201cThey can also seek to plea bargain, which is something that I\u2019m guessing they will at least talk about.\u201d \u201cIf I were defense counsel, you owe it to your client to talk and the prosecution could talk about whether they could reduce charges and reach some plea agreement,\u201d Coakley said. In jurors\u2019 final note to the judge before she declared a mistrial, they said \u201csome members\u201d believed the prosecutors had met the burden of proof, proving the charges beyond a reasonable doubt. But \u201cothers\u201d felt the evidence failed to meet that standard. Jurors\u2019 language signaled it was not a single holdout but multiple jurors who were unconvinced, Cavallaro said, which the defense would take as a win. \u201cGiven that,\u201d she asked, \u201cis there any temptation for (Read) to plead?\u201d Medwed echoed that idea, pointing out that Read\u2019s defense focused on her proclaimed innocence in O\u2019Keefe\u2019s death. He would be surprised if she was interested in pleading guilty to anything that would include admitting she caused O\u2019Keefe\u2019s death. State trooper\u2019s testimony appears to be key A key decision could be whether to present testimony from a lead investigator who had to apologize on the stand for sexist and offensive texts he sent about Read in a private group chat, according to WCVB. Massachusetts State Police Trooper Michael Proctor called her a \u201cwhack job,\u201d mocked her medical issues and told coworkers he found \u201cno nudes\u201d while searching her phone for evidence, the station reported. Proctor was relieved of duty Monday following the mistrial, state police Col. John Mawn said in a news release. \u201cThis follows our previous decision to open an internal affairs investigation after information about serious misconduct emerged in testimony at the trial,\u201d Mawn said, adding the investigation is ongoing. CNN has sought comment from the State Police Association of Massachusetts. An attorney for Proctor previously said he was cooperating with the internal inquiry and said his personal messages did not undermine the investigation into O\u2019Keefe\u2019s death. There\u2019s no evidence Proctor tampered with any evidence, Julie Grant, a Court TV anchor and a former federal prosecutor, told CNN\u2019s Sara Sidner Tuesday. But his behavior and comments were \u201cunprofessional.\u201d \u201cThe Massachusetts State Police \u2013 you have to wonder if they felt as if he had any role in this hung jury,\u201d she said. Still, experts who spoke to CNN saw Proctor\u2019s testimony as key to the commonwealth\u2019s case, which might force prosecutors to call on him despite the apparent baggage. \u201cHe\u2019s the lead investigator, which means that his performance, his work, his efforts are inherently relevant to the case,\u201d Medwed said, adding the defense would likely call the trooper to impeach the investigation even if prosecutors didn\u2019t. \u201cI just don\u2019t see how the government can avoid him as much as they\u2019d like to,\u201d Medwed said.

He\u00a0was additionally charged with three counts\u00a0of\u00a0manslaughter in the\u00a0second degree,\u00a0three counts\u00a0of\u00a0vehicular manslaughter in the\u00a0second degree,\u00a0and\u00a0one count\u00a0of\u00a0aggravated\u00a0vehicular\u00a0assault, according\u00a0to\u00a0a criminal complaint from the\u00a0Manhattan District Attorney\u2019s\u00a0Office.

A group celebrating the holiday was struck by the gray Ford F-150 when it ran through an intersection and into Corlears Hook Park at about 9 p.m. Hyden was driving at \u201ca high rate of speed when he failed to navigate the road and struck 11 pedestrians\u201d inside the park, police say. Hyden, who told police he had a few alcoholic drinks, was found at the scene of the crash \u201cnext to the driver\u2019s side door, bloodied with no shirt or shoes,\u201d the complaint said. Police said Hyden, who was stumbling on his feet, had bloodshot eyes and a \u201cstrong odor of alcoholic beverage on his breath and clothing,\u201d the complaint says. Pedestrians who witnessed the\u00a0incident\u00a0told an\u00a0officer that Hyden was the\u00a0only person sitting in the\u00a0driver\u2019s seat when the\u00a0truck\u00a0crashed\u00a0and\u00a0there were no other passengers in the\u00a0vehicle, according\u00a0to\u00a0the\u00a0complaint.

Many of the gravestones \u2013 some dating back to the late 1800s \u2013 have been knocked face-down, with some cracked in half, at the Tifereth Israel and the Beth Hamedrash Hagadol cemeteries in the Covedale Cemetery complex, a news release on behalf of the Jewish Cemeteries of Greater Cincinnati, the Jewish Federation of Cincinnati and the Jewish Community Relations Council said. The vandalism is believed to have occurred between June 25 and July 1, the statement said, and was discovered Monday morning. The FBI, Cincinnati Police and Green Township of Hamilton County are investigating the incident but there are no known suspects, the release added. \u201cThe FBI Cincinnati Field Office, the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of Ohio, and the Justice Department\u2019s Civil Rights Division are working with local law enforcement partners to investigate the damage to gravestones at Tifereth Israel Cemetery and the Beth Hamedrash Hagadol Cemetery,\u201d The FBI said Thursday. \u201cWe encourage anyone with information about this vandalism to contact the FBI.\u201d Capt. Mitch Hill of the Green Township Police Department told CNN Wednesday the investigation is ongoing and no new information is available. \u201cThe vandalism of nearly 200 graves at two Jewish cemeteries near Cincinnati is despicable. This is Antisemitism and it is vile,\u201d President Joe Biden stated in a post on X Wednesday, \u201cI condemn these acts and commit my Administration to support investigators in holding those responsible accountable to the full extent of the law.\u201d The vandalism comes amid a rise in antisemitic incidents across the nation. The\u00a0most recent data\u00a0from the Anti-Defamation League, which has tracked antisemitic incidents in the US since 1979, found a 140% increase from 2022 to 2023, with a \u201cdramatic\u201d increase taking place after the October 7 Hamas\u00a0attacks\u00a0on Israel. \u201cWe unequivocally condemn this act of hatred and desecration. Our hearts go out to the families affected by this senseless vandalism. The Jewish community in Cincinnati is resilient, and we are committed to repairing the damage and restoring the sanctity of these sacred spaces,\u201d the federation\u2019s release said. Sue Susskind, executive director of the Jewish Cemeteries of Greater Cincinnati, told CNN, \u201cUntil you walk that ground and feel it, I mean, it\u2019s horrendous. I\u2019ve never felt anything like that in my life.\u201d While the organization has not yet been able to identify all the graves affected, Susskind said law enforcement has now granted permission for the gravestones to be repaired and inspected. Some of the gravestones are so heavy, they will have to be lifted up by cranes, she said. Two monument companies have reached out and are willing to donate their services in restoring the vandalized stones, Susskind told CNN. First, they hope to identify names and pull reports from the Jewish Cemeteries database, Susskind said. For the older graves not in the system, the organization will have to \u201cgo on the ground and try to figure it out.\u201d CNN observed on Wednesday that at least six of the overturned graves were those of US veterans.  According to Susskind, families are currently allowed to enter the cemeteries and find their loved ones\u2019 gravestones before reporting if that gravestone is \u201cup or down\u201d in order to reduce the list of suspected impacted areas. Janson Becker is one resident who came to check on the gravestones of his parents and several other family members at Covedale Cemeteries. While his family\u2019s graves were safe, Becker told CNN he felt \u201ca combination of anger and sadness\u201d about what occurred, describing it as a \u201cfeeling of being violated.\u201d But Becker offered a hopeful message to the families affected, despite the negative feelings. \u201cYou can be angry about it.

{"id": "2024_07_06_us_gender-affirming-vocal-coach-cec", "text": "Think about all the ways you show the world who you are. How you dress, how you look, what you prefer to be called, who you spend your time with, even how you sound \u2014 they all convey your specific identity. When transgender people are exploring ways to share their true selves with the world, they often think about these things on a deeper level. Something as simple as the voice they were born with may not sound or feel right. It may not reflect the real them. This is where gender-affirming vocal coaches come in. These professionals have backgrounds in speech therapy, vocal performance or other types of vocal practices, and use their expertise to help people change the quality of their voices in a safe and sustainable way. For some transgender,\u00a0nonbinary\u00a0or gender nonconforming people, a new voice is a gateway to a new kind of self-expression. What does a gender-affirming voice coach do? Kevin Dorman is the owner of\u00a0Prismatic Speech Services\u00a0in Greensboro, North Carolina. Their path to the highly specialized world of gender-affirming vocal coaching began with a love of performance, and at the suggestion of their high school theater teacher, they took up speech language pathology in college. After exploring their own gender identity, Dorman realized a few years later that they were trans. The pieces started falling into place for Dorman. \u201cAt the same time, I was taking a voice disorders class, and there was just a single bullet point on there about gender-affirming voice work,\u201d they told CNN. \u201cBut that was enough for me to look out on my own and seek further education.\u201d There are different approaches to gender-affirming vocal work. In the sphere of speech language pathology, it\u2019s viewed similarly to the way one would treat voice disorders. Practitioners may also have backgrounds in areas like vocal performance. \u201cTransgender vocal training, as it\u2019s sometimes called, sprung up from a marriage of speech pathologists, singing teachers, theater specialists and their techniques. So it\u2019s this really fascinating blend of science and art,\u201d Dorman explained. Dorman begins by asking each client their goals, and how they want to sound, and then shows them how to use their voice differently by adjusting factors like pitch and tone. In addition to helping to align voices and identities \u2014 possibly avoiding unpleasant questions or interactions \u2014 gender-affirming vocal coaching can also help people move more comfortably through the world, confident enough to do things that seemed too fraught to attempt before. \u201cWe want to know what sounds best to you, what feels most empowering, what helps you participate in activities of daily life that other people take for granted, like being comfortable ordering at a drive-thru or calling a doctor\u2019s office or talking to neighbors,\u201d Dorman said. What it means to change your voice Voice actor Alexis Vandom always had fun with her voice, even as a child. When she began transitioning as an adult, she sought training from several specialized voice coaches to feminize the way she sounded. It was a years-long process with physical and emotional challenges. \u201cI first largely had to focus on getting out of my own way,\u201d Vandom told CNN. \u201cLike many trans femme folks out there, voice training sometimes in and of itself would generate additional dysphoria. I learned to give myself the grace and the space to develop the voice over time.\u201d Since Vandom had a natural ability and interest in voice work, she was able to combine things she learned about voice acting with things she learned specifically about vocal feminization. However, despite her experience, the lingo of speech pathology and singing techniques sometimes went over her head. She hopes more accessible language around gender-affirming voice coaching will develop as the practice evolves. Some vocal practices, she says, have fallen out of favor because they could be damaging to the voice long-term. Overtaxing the larynx, for instance, could cause\u00a0vocal tension dystonia, a speech and swallowing disorder. \u201cInstead, many coaches these days may focus on developing muscle memory exercises, so the voice can come naturally and without strain,\u201d she said. In addition to receiving professional training, Vandom also sought out tutorials on YouTube and advice from others with an interest in voice skills. This is a route a lot of trans people go if they can\u2019t afford or find a trained vocal coach. Other professionals CNN spoke with\u00a0cautioned such tutorials could cause damage if used improperly, but for many, Vandom said, it\u2019s the most accessible option. \u201cFor me, changing my voice wasn\u2019t just about my identity. It was a matter of safety. I lived in the South at the time, and I think trans folks who live in places that are especially hostile are moved to develop their voice so they can have interactions without feeling unsafe.\u201d Bryce Chambers, who has an acting and singing background, said he knows a lot of fellow trans people who do work on their own voice without the help of a professional. He was lucky to be connected to a voice coach after college who helped\u00a0 him lower and darken his voice by encouraging diaphragmatic breathing and throat positioning, among other techniques. They weren\u2019t specifically a gender-affirming voice coach, but knew the processes needed to accomplish Chambers\u2019 specific goals. \u201cAny singer or an actor needs to take care of their voice over many years,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cSo concerns about trans or nonbinary people changing their voice in a healthy way are valid but not unique. Lots of people have a need to practice vocal hygiene, staying hydrated and taking vocal rest if they need it.\u201d The fact is, Chambers said, if a transgender person feels the need to change their voice \u2014 whether for personal, social or safety reasons, they\u2019re going to do it. \u201cTrans folk have been altering their voices for as long as they\u2019ve been around, I\u2019m sure,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe some of the processes aren\u2019t ideal, but it\u2019s better than nothing. I just hope we continue to see progress in the field.\u201d How someone changes their voice Anna Freya began her career studying vocal performance, and now teaches both\u00a0singing and gender-affirming vocal methods\u00a0in the Seattle area. When working with the voice, Freya stresses there are many ways to adjust how the throat, mouth, lips and tongue make different sounds. \u201cPitch and pitch range, that is very important,\u201d she said. \u201cThe quality of the voice; bright versus dark; that\u2019s also important. The anatomy and physiology of the voice matters, and in different ways than conventional singing. It\u2019s almost like reverse engineering, looking at the elements of how the voice sounds and which ones need to be swapped out or put together in a different configuration to get a different result.\u201d This work can get very technical, and it carries some of the challenges of other vocal training styles. For instance, to get a brighter, more feminine sound, Freya may encourage clients to reposition their voicebox, or larynx \u2014 something that, short of sticking a hand down one\u2019s throat, is accomplished by communicating how certain things in the throat feel or sound when the client adjusts them, and what muscles are working. \u201cBut so much of sounding feminine in that particular example, or sounding any certain way, is also about how you pronounce things and the cadence of the voice,\u201d Freya said. Dorman takes a similar approach. \u201cThe way that I like to think about it is, we\u2019re modifying the breath flow through the throat, through the larynx where pitch is produced, and then everything above that, like the size and shape of the access area between the mouth and the nose,\u201d they said. \u201cThat\u2019s resonance. And then through that work we can get to a darker, warmer resonance, or a brighter, buzzier, brassier resonance.\u201d Since this kind of coaching is meant to be for life, gender-affirming vocal coaches also place a huge importance on healthy vocal hygiene so clients don\u2019t damage their vocal mechanisms over time or get into uncomfortable habits. This includes practical advice like staying hydrated and avoiding certain actions that tax the voice \u2014 like yelling. Then, there is the larger question of what sounds are associated with gender. \u201cThere\u2019s not just one way to sound feminine. There\u2019s not just one way to sound masculine. And there\u2019s little guidelines on what androgynous even should sound like, so it\u2019s our job to help our clients figure out what they feel empowered by,\u201d Dorman said. \u201cCertainly there are many clients who come in with a specific goal of, say, getting gendered correctly in public. But the problem is, gender is a much more dynamic process. It\u2019s not static, it\u2019s an exchange of information, so everyone comes to conversations with different concepts of what is feminine and masculine.\u201d Why the work is important When Dorman started working with gender-affirming vocal methods, it was 2016 \u2014 just a few years after they noticed conversations about gender identity really opening up in the US.\u00a0There wasn\u2019t a lot there in terms of specific research, networking or practice. \u201cSince then, it has grown so much as more trans people learn that it is an avenue of transition that\u2019s possible, and thankfully the care and diversity of providers have increased over the years,\u201d they said. Both Dorman\u2019s\u00a0and Freya\u2019s clients currently pay from $50 to $100 a session, which they know isn\u2019t affordable for everyone.\u00a0When looking toward the future, they said they hope the field of gender-affirming vocal work increases in both the academic sense, with more specific research and training, and in the visible sense, with more providers offering services and finding ways to lessen the financial burden. Freya, who is a lesbian, says gender-affirming work is a skill she can offer to her wider LGBTQ community. \u201cIt was a matter of, \u2018I can help people that have greater disadvantage within the greater LGBT community.\u2019 I feel very fiercely about that,\u201d she said. \u201cIf I can further LGBTQ acceptance in society with my skills and my intelligence, why would I not do that? Especially if I can help others do the same, and then we\u2019re all leveraging off of each other\u2019s experience and expertise.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/06/us/gender-affirming-vocal-coach-cec/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/07/2024", "section": "us"}}
